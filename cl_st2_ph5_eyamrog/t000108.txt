Title: Osteoclasts recycle via osteomorphs during RANKL-stimulated bone resorption


Abstract: Summary

Osteoclasts are large multinucleated bone-resorbing cells formed by the fusion of monocyte/macrophage-derived precursors that are thought to undergo apoptosis once resorption is complete. Here, by intravital imaging, we reveal that RANKL-stimulated osteoclasts have an alternative cell fate in which they fission into daughter cells called osteomorphs. Inhibiting RANKL blocked this cellular recycling and resulted in osteomorph accumulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that osteomorphs are transcriptionally distinct from osteoclasts and macrophages and express a number of non-canonical osteoclast genes that are associated with structural and functional bone phenotypes when deleted in mice. Furthermore, genetic variation in human orthologs of osteomorph genes causes monogenic skeletal disorders and associates with bone mineral density, a polygenetic skeletal trait. Thus, osteoclasts recycle via osteomorphs, a cell type involved in the regulation of bone resorption that may be targeted for the treatment of skeletal diseases.

Section: Introduction

The skeleton provides the scaffold to support body weight, enable body movement, protect vital organs, and control mineral homeostasis while also providing the location for hematopoiesis. Accordingly, it is a dynamic organ that is continuously remodeled throughout life in response to diverse environmental stimuli. At the microscopic level, remodeling is achieved by the coordinated action of osteoclasts that resorb old bone and osteoblasts that form new bone, activities that are coupled in both time and space ( Hattner et al., 1965 27. Hattner, R. ∙ Epker, B.N. ∙ Frost, H.M. Suggested sequential mode of control of changes in cell behaviour in adult bone remodelling Nature. 1965; 206 :489-490 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Osteoclasts are specialized cells formed by the fusion of committed monocyte/macrophage hematopoietic lineage precursor cells ( Boyle et al., 2003 11. Boyle, W.J. ∙ Simonet, W.S. ∙ Lacey, D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation Nature. 2003; 423 :337-342 Crossref Scopus (5326) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ikeda and Takeshita, 2016 30. Ikeda, K. ∙ Takeshita, S. The role of osteoclast differentiation and function in skeletal homeostasis J. Biochem. 2016; 159 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). The importance of osteoclasts in bone homeostasis and human health is evidenced by the diseases in which osteoclast formation and function is dysregulated, such as Paget’s disease, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and metastatic cancer ( Novack and Teitelbaum, 2008 59. Novack, D.V. ∙ Teitelbaum, S.L. The osteoclast: friend or foe? Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3 :457-484 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notwithstanding the pivotal role of osteoclasts in health and disease, the biology of this cell type, particularly their life cycle in vivo , remains elusive.
Bone is opaque and has a high refractive index, making it difficult to image bone cells in live animals. Tracking osteoclast cell formation and fate in their native environment in vivo has proved demanding. As a result, advances in understanding osteoclast biology have largely been gained through study in vitro . This has been driven by the discovery that osteoclast-like cells could be generated by culture of bone marrow cells in the presence of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone ( Takahashi et al., 1988 67. Takahashi, N. ∙ Yamana, H. ∙ Yoshiki, S. ... Osteoclast-like cell formation and its regulation by osteotropic hormones in mouse bone marrow cultures Endocrinology. 1988; 122 :1373-1382 Crossref Scopus (706) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, in vitro studies have contributed much to our understanding of the cellular origin of osteoclasts and the factors required for osteoclast formation and function, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), also known as colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) ( Udagawa et al., 1990 70. Udagawa, N. ∙ Takahashi, N. ∙ Akatsu, T. ... Origin of osteoclasts: mature monocytes and macrophages are capable of differentiating into osteoclasts under a suitable microenvironment prepared by bone marrow-derived stromal cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87 :7260-7264 Crossref Scopus (882) PubMed Google Scholar ), and what is now regarded as the critical osteoclast factor, the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) ( Boyce and Xing, 2007 10. Boyce, B.F. ∙ Xing, L. Biology of RANK, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin Arthritis Res. Ther. 2007; 9 :S1 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yasuda et al., 1998 79. Yasuda, H. ∙ Shima, N. ∙ Nakagawa, N. ... Osteoclast differentiation factor is a ligand for osteoprotegerin/osteoclastogenesis-inhibitory factor and is identical to TRANCE/RANKL Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :3597-3602 Crossref Scopus (3678) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, it has been shown that osteoclasts may undergo apoptosis as a pathological response to bisphosphonates ( Hughes et al., 1995 28. Hughes, D.E. ∙ Wright, K.R. ∙ Uy, H.L. ... Bisphosphonates promote apoptosis in murine osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10 :1478-1487 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ), estrogen ( Nakamura et al., 2007 58. Nakamura, T. ∙ Imai, Y. ∙ Matsumoto, T. ... Estrogen prevents bone loss via estrogen receptor alpha and induction of Fas ligand in osteoclasts Cell. 2007; 130 :811-823 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (842) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mechanical force ( Kobayashi et al., 2000 43. Kobayashi, Y. ∙ Hashimoto, F. ∙ Miyamoto, H. ... Force-induced osteoclast apoptosis in vivo is accompanied by elevation in transforming growth factor beta and osteoprotegerin expression J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15 :1924-1934 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, this has led to the dogma that osteoclasts are terminally differentiated cells that undergo apoptosis after a short lifespan of ∼2 weeks ( Manolagas, 2000 50. Manolagas, S.C. Birth and death of bone cells: basic regulatory mechanisms and implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of osteoporosis Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21 :115-137 Crossref Scopus (2118) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this has been challenged by a recent parabiosis study that showed osteoclasts are longer lived with a lifespan of around 6 months ( Jacome-Galarza et al., 2019 33. Jacome-Galarza, C.E. ∙ Percin, G.I. ∙ Muller, J.T. ... Developmental origin, functional maintenance and genetic rescue of osteoclasts Nature. 2019; 568 :541-545 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Two-photon microscopy, by imaging fluorescence excitation at near-infrared wavelengths that penetrate deep inside living tissues, has been used to image osteoclast precursors ( Ishii et al., 2009 31. Ishii, M. ∙ Egen, J.G. ∙ Klauschen, F. ... Sphingosine-1-phosphate mobilizes osteoclast precursors and regulates bone homeostasis Nature. 2009; 458 :524-528 Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ishii et al., 2010 32. Ishii, M. ∙ Kikuta, J. ∙ Shimazu, Y. ... Chemorepulsion by blood S1P regulates osteoclast precursor mobilization and bone remodeling in vivo J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 :2793-2798 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), osteoclastic bone resorption ( Kikuta et al., 2013 42. Kikuta, J. ∙ Wada, Y. ∙ Kowada, T. ... Dynamic visualization of RANKL and Th17-mediated osteoclast function J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :866-873 PubMed Google Scholar ; Maeda et al., 2016 49. Maeda, H. ∙ Kowada, T. ∙ Kikuta, J. ... Real-time intravital imaging of pH variation associated with osteoclast activity Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 :579-585 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), and osteoclast-osteoblast interactions in vivo ( Furuya et al., 2018 24. Furuya, M. ∙ Kikuta, J. ∙ Fujimori, S. ... Direct cell-cell contact between mature osteoblasts and osteoclasts dynamically controls their functions in vivo Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :300 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). These pioneering experiments were performed by visualizing cells expressing fluorescent reporters in the calvarium, a non-weight bearing flat bone formed by intramembranous ossification, that can be imaged via gaps in the cranial sutures in the bregma. Despite these studies, there have been no studies to date that have imaged osteoclast formation and fate in vivo in weight-bearing long bones formed by endochondral ossification.
To address this, we developed an alternative, minimally invasive system for longitudinal real-time imaging of cellular dynamics in the tibia of mice ( Lawson et al., 2015 45. Lawson, M.A. ∙ McDonald, M.M. ∙ Kovacic, N. ... Osteoclasts control reactivation of dormant myeloma cells by remodelling the endosteal niche Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8983 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tibia, unlike the calvaria, is a weight-bearing bone formed by endochondral ossification. It is a site of hematopoiesis and active bone turnover and models many of the bones that are commonly associated with skeletal disease. We leveraged knowledge that osteoclasts are formed by the fusion of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to generate mixed bone marrow irradiation chimeras in which osteoclasts are marked by the simultaneous expression of two independent fluorescent reporters. This high-fidelity system for imaging osteoclast dynamics allowed us to visualize the behavior of these cells in the steady state upon activation with soluble RANKL (sRANKL) and upon inhibition with osteoprotegerin-Fc fusion protein (OPG:Fc), a reversible inhibitor of RANK signaling. These studies reveal an unexpected cell fate in which osteoclasts recycle by fissioning into smaller more motile cells, which we have termed osteomorphs, and then fusing to form osteoclasts in a different location. Osteomorphs were shown by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to be a distinct cell type that differs from both osteoclasts and macrophages. Deletion of osteomorph upregulated genes in mice resulted in abnormal structural and functional bone phenotypes. Furthermore, human orthologs of osteomorph upregulated genes were associated with skeletal dysplasias and bone mineral density (BMD) in the UK Biobank study. Furthermore, we show that OPG:Fc treatment results in accumulation of osteomorphs that are able to reassemble rapidly into large activated osteoclasts upon OPG:Fc withdrawal, resulting in bone loss. These findings mirror the accelerated bone loss and spontaneous fractures recently described following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks RANK/RANKL signaling. Osteoclast recycling therefore not only provides a paradigm for understanding the behavior and fate of these cells in their physiological niche in vivo but also a framework for understanding skeletal diseases associated with dysregulated bone resorption and the effects of drugs used to treat them.

Section: Results

The expression of genes such as Ctsk (encoding cathepsin K) and Acp5 (encoding tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, TRAP) have been used to mark osteoclasts for in vivo studies. However, expression of these genes is not restricted to osteoclasts ( https://www.immgen.org ), and off-target expression may confound analysis ( Han et al., 2019 26. Han, Y. ∙ Feng, H. ∙ Sun, J. ... Lkb1 deletion in periosteal mesenchymal progenitors induces osteogenic tumors through mTORC1 activation J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :1895-1909 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Winkeler et al., 2012 78. Winkeler, C.L. ∙ Kladney, R.D. ∙ Maggi, Jr., L.B. ... Cathepsin K-Cre causes unexpected germline deletion of genes in mice PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e42005 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). This led us to develop an alternative high-fidelity system for marking osteoclasts in vivo using their physical and functional properties. We generated mixed bone marrow chimeras in which lethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with a 1:1 or 1:4 mix of bone marrow cells from separate donors where the cells singly express either a green or red fluorescent protein ( Figure 1 A). In this system, osteoclasts that form from the fusion of monocyte/macrophage lineage cells from the two donor lines are double-labeled red and green. We used Lysm Cre/+ . Tdtomato LSL/LSL mice (in which myeloid lineage cells expressing LYSM are red due to expression of tdTomato) and either Blimp-1 Egfp/+ . Rag-1 −/− mice (in which osteoclasts and natural killer cells are green due to expression of GFP) or Csf1r Egfp/+ mice (in which CSF1R + cells are green due to expression of GFP) as donor bone marrow ( Figure 1 A). Osteoclasts were identified as large LYSM + BLIMP1 + or LYSM + CSF1R + cells located adjacent to the endosteal bone surface in mosaic-tiled images of the tibia of recipient mice ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ). These LYSM + CSF1R + double-labeled cells were multinucleated and expressed cathepsin K, a key enzyme expressed by osteoclasts, and >90% had resorbed fluorescently labeled bisphosphonate from bone, confirming they were osteoclasts ( Figures 1 C–1E). While these cells shared similarities with in vitro generated osteoclasts ( Figure 1 F) ( Arnett and Dempster, 1986 5. Arnett, T.R. ∙ Dempster, D.W. Effect of pH on bone resorption by rat osteoclasts in vitro Endocrinology. 1986; 119 :119-124 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ; Boyce, 2013 9. Boyce, B.F. Advances in osteoclast biology reveal potential new drug targets and new roles for osteoclasts J. Bone Miner. Res. 2013; 28 :711-722 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vesely et al., 1992 74. Vesely, P. ∙ Boyde, A. ∙ Jones, S.J. Behaviour of osteoclasts in vitro: contact behaviour of osteoclasts with osteoblast-like cells and networking of osteoclasts for 3D orientation J. Anat. 1992; 181 :277-291 PubMed Google Scholar ), they were exceptional for their stellate appearance with multiple cellular processes contacting neighboring cells to form an interconnected network across the endosteum ( Figure 1 B). Although we cannot exclude the presence of migrating cells in the network, “branching” osteoclasts have been described in glutaraldehyde-fixed specimens ( Jones and Boyde, 1977 35. Jones, S.J. ∙ Boyde, A. Some morphological observations on osteoclasts Cell Tissue Res. 1977; 185 :387-397 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), where the cellular architecture is preserved prior to tissue processing. Intravital imaging over 2 h revealed remarkable stability in the size, dendritic morphology, and localization of these osteoclasts in the steady state ( Figures 1 G–1I; Video S2 ). Thus, osteoclasts in vivo differ from osteoclasts generated in vitro in their stellate appearance and extensive cell-to-cell contacts.

Time stamp is hh:mm:ss. The next part of the video, in contrast, shows osteoclast recycling 3 weeks after OPG:Fc withdrawal. Osteoclasts are large and undergo iterative cycles of cell fission and fusion, as shown by the cell fate mapping. Time stamp is hh:mm:ss.
Since the RANKL/RANK/OPG signaling system is the physiological master regulator of osteoclast biology and bone resorption, we chose to manipulate this system to determine its impact on osteoclast dynamics. Soluble RANKL-stimulated osteoclasts were highly dynamic and underwent morphological changes, which began within 20 min of sRANKL administration by retracting their cellular processes ( Figures 2 A–2D; Video S3 ). In this activated state, osteoclasts migrated toward each other and appeared to undergo cell fusion to form larger cells ( Figure 2 E and 2F; Videos S3 and S4 ). A limitation of two-photon imaging through intact cortical bone is the need to trade off the detection of weak signals from fine cellular processes with the saturation of strong signals from cell bodies. Therefore, to confirm that the cells do fuse, we performed in vitro live cell imaging by confocal microscopy. This also showed the fusion of multinucleated osteoclasts to form even larger polykaryons ( Figures 2 G and 2H; Video S4 ; Jansen et al., 2012 34. Jansen, I.D. ∙ Vermeer, J.A. ∙ Bloemen, V. ... Osteoclast fusion and fission Calcif. Tissue Int. 2012; 90 :515-522 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, sRANKL-stimulated osteoclasts are larger and more active than steady-state osteoclasts, both in vivo and in vitro .

In long-term intravital imaging experiments, we also observed that large sRANKL-stimulated osteoclasts often fissioned into smaller daughter cells ( Figures 3 A–3C; Video S5 ). These cells were larger than 5 μm in diameter and freely motile, suggesting that they were live. Analysis of time-lapse images confirmed they represented true cell fission events ( Video S5 ). Fission was not accompanied by changes to the level of interaction with macrophages ( Figure 3 D). In vitro live-cell imaging showed similar cell fission events, and these nucleated daughter cells were motile ( Figures 3 E and 3F; Video S5 ).

We next sought to exclude the possibility that this represented apoptosis. We did not detect spontaneous apoptosis in >130 h of intravital imaging, so we developed a system to induce osteoclast apoptosis in vivo . The bisphosphonate clodronate is reported to induce osteoclast apoptosis in vitro and in vivo ( Hughes et al., 1995 28. Hughes, D.E. ∙ Wright, K.R. ∙ Uy, H.L. ... Bisphosphonates promote apoptosis in murine osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10 :1478-1487 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ; Selander et al., 1996 65. Selander, K.S. ∙ Mönkkönen, J. ∙ Karhukorpi, E.K. ... Characteristics of clodronate-induced apoptosis in osteoclasts and macrophages Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50 :1127-1138 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, we could not detect apoptosis following clodronate treatment. We therefore used localized delivery of two-photon laser pulses ( Chtanova et al., 2014 16. Chtanova, T. ∙ Hampton, H.R. ∙ Waterhouse, L.A. ... Real-time interactive two-photon photoconversion of recirculating lymphocytes for discontinuous cell tracking in live adult mice J. Biophotonics. 2014; 7 :425-433 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) to induce osteoclast apoptosis in vivo by phototoxicity ( Figure 3 G; Video S6 ). Irradiation of osteoclasts resulted in fragmentation of the cell into multiple smaller subcellular components <5 μm in diameter. These fragments were rounded, non-motile, and eventually disappeared, possibly due to engulfment and digestion by macrophages. Thus, while the total volume of daughter cells was preserved and similar to the volume of the parental cell in osteoclast fission ( Figure 3 H), in apoptosis the total volume of fragments decreased to zero ( Figure 3 I). Moreover, while osteoclast fission was immunologically “silent’” ( Figures 3 A and 3D; Video S5 ), apoptosis was accompanied by an influx of monocytes/macrophages, which scanned and interacted with debris at a higher rate than in cell fission ( Figures 3 G and 3J; Video S6 ). These data establish that in vivo , in response to sRANKL, osteoclasts undergo fission to produce daughter cells in a process that is distinct from apoptosis.

Time stamp is hh:mm:ss.
We next sought to determine the fate of the daughter cells. Tracking showed they not only migrated away from the parent polykaryon, but they also fused with neighboring osteoclasts and in some cases with each other ( Figures 4 A–4C; Video S7 ). Thus, daughter cells were “recycled” into larger polykaryons. This cellular recycling was also observed in vitro . Recycling events were visualized by cell fate mapping trees ( Figure 4 C; Figure S1 ) and fission and fusion of recycling cells lead us to name them “osteomorphs” to distinguish them from osteoclasts.

Since sRANKL induced osteoclast recycling, we next determined the impact of therapeutic inhibition on this process. This was achieved by administering OPG:Fc, the decoy receptor for RANKL, which inhibits RANK signaling, and then withdrawing it (OPG:W). This was compared to mice treated with vehicle, sRANKL, or OPG:Fc alone. The number of fission, fusion, and recycling events were quantified and visualized using cell fate maps ( Figure S1 ). Osteoclast recycling was not observed in the steady state ( Figures 1 G–1I; Figure S1 ; Video S2 ). Mice treated with sRANKL underwent cycles of fission and fusion when imaged for up to 7 h ( Figures 4 A–4F; Video S7 ). Treatment with OPG:Fc inhibited osteoclast recycling ( Figure S1 ; Video S8 ). However, 3 weeks after OPG:Fc was withdrawn, osteoclasts underwent cycles of fission and fusion similar to that seen in mice treated with sRANKL ( Figures 4 D–4F; Figure S1 ; Video S8 ). Analysis of the frequency of events showed that in the absence of treatment, fusion and fission was not detected in the 7 h analysis timeframe. In contrast, sRANKL treatment was associated with 1.08 ± 0.37 fusion and 0.61 ± 0.18 fission events/h. This was inhibited with OPG:Fc (fusion 0.02 ± 0.02/h, fission 0.07 ± 0.07/h) but increased following OPG:Fc withdrawal (fusion 0.48 ± 0.20/h, fission 0.81 ± 0.15/h) ( Figure 4 G). In this timeframe, 19.38% ± 8.71% of cells underwent cell fusion and 9.88% ± 3.62% of cells underwent cell fission events in sRANKL-treated mice, suggesting this is a common phenomenon ( Figure 4 H). OPG:Fc treatment reduced the cells undergoing fusion and fission to untreated control levels (fusion 0.44% ± 0.44%, fission 1.33% ± 1.33%). Strikingly, OPG:W increased the proportions of cells undergoing fusion and fission to proportions seen with sRANKL treatment (fusion 10.60% ± 7.12%, fission 15.20% ± 6.14%) ( Figure 4 H; Figure S1 ). Thus, osteoclast recycling is regulated by RANKL signaling in vivo .

Time stamp is hh:mm:ss.
Since RANKL regulates osteoclast recycling, we sought to quantify the effect of sRANKL, OPG:Fc, and OPG:W on the number, morphology, and network connections between double-labeled cells that have taken up bisphosphonate ( Figures 5 A–5D). OPG:Fc treatment induced the loss of large aspherical cells >10,000 μm 3 and a shift in the distribution of the cell volume and sphericity, such that overall cells were smaller and more rounded ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Network analysis showed that these cells did not form the extensive interconnected networks of cells >1,000 μm in length seen in steady-state conditions and in sRANKL-treated mice ( Figures 5 C and 5D). This suggests that OPG:Fc inhibits RANKL-dependent fusion, resulting in the accumulation of osteomorphs.
To determine the consequence of this osteomorph accumulation, we longitudinally analyzed mice treated with OPG:Fc for 2 weeks and then for a further 15 weeks after OPG:Fc withdrawal. Serum TRAP 5b was suppressed during OPG:Fc treatment and rebounded upon OPG:W ( Figure 5 E). This was matched by an initial increase, peaking at 8 weeks, and subsequent decrease in BMD ( Figure 5 F). These changes were paralleled by changes in bone microarchitecture ( Figures 5 G and 5H; Figure S2 ). OPG:Fc treatment was associated with a significant decrease in TRAP + osteoclasts, and cessation of OPG:Fc treatment was followed by a corresponding rebound increase in TRAP+ osteoclasts ( Figures 5 I and 5J). These data suggest that accumulation of osteomorphs in a recycling pool may contribute to the accelerated bone loss and pathological vertebral fractures observed in a subset of patients who have discontinued denosumab therapy ( Anastasilakis et al., 2017a 2.

OPG:Fc withdrawal resulted in an increase in osteoclastic activity with increased numbers of large polykaryons >10,000 μm 3 with low sphericity ( Figures 5 A and 5B) and a corresponding increase in the number of networks and total networks with lengths >1,000 μm ( Figures 5 C and 5D). These changes resembled those observed in mice treated with sRANKL and suggested that OPG:Fc treatment increased the reservoir of osteomorphs that are poised to fuse and reassemble into bone resorbing osteoclasts upon drug withdrawal. To test this, we isolated bone marrow cells from OPG:Fc-treated mice and cultured them in vitro with M-CSF and sRANKL ( Figure 6 A). The same number of bone marrow cells isolated from OPG:Fc-treated mice generated more TRAP + osteoclasts than cells from vehicle-treated mice. These TRAP + cells were able to form resorption pits on dentine slices ( Figure 6 B). To show that this was due to the increase in osteomorphs, we set out to identify cells that co-expressed green and red fluorescence from the bone marrow of chimeric mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) ( Figure 6 C). Since osteoclasts generated from the fusion of green and red cells were double labeled, we reasoned that osteomorphs generated by the fission of these osteoclasts would retain expression of fluorescent proteins and also be double labeled. Furthermore, since osteomorphs were motile, we reasoned that they could be recovered from the bone marrow. Consistent with this notion, double-labeled cells can be detected in the blood of mixed chimeras, indicating that they are able to detach from bone and recirculate ( Figure S3 ). Analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) showed that double-labeled cells were zoledronic acid positive (ZOL + ), suggesting they were derived from osteoclasts that had resorbed bone and taken up bisphosphonate bound to the bone surface ( Figure 6 D). We next sorted these LYSM + CSF1R + (TOM + GFP + ) putative osteomorphs using stringent singlet gates to exclude doublets and dead cells ( Figure S3 ). Double-labeled cells were sorted, co-cultured unlabeled osteoclasts ( Figure 6 E), and also seeded onto the calvarial bone for ex vivo culture ( Figure 6 F). These experiments showed that putative osteomorphs were able to undergo cell fusion and form multinucleated cells that resorb bone and take up bisphosphonate. Thus, osteomorphs derived from osteoclast fission are able to fuse into mature bone resorbing osteoclasts.
To cross-validate the existence of osteomorphs and identify the genes that define the osteomorph cell state, we performed scRNA-seq. We hypothesized that single-positive LYSM + CSF1R neg and LYSM neg CSF1R + are monocyte/macrophage precursors, triple-positive LYSM + CSF1R + ZOL + cells from the bone marrow are osteomorphs, and triple-positive cells from the bone surface are osteoclasts ( Figure S3 ). We first analyzed the cells from marrow to determine if triple-positive osteomorphs were distinct from the single-positive cells. Analysis of Egfp and Tdtomato gene expression showed that green cells expressed Egfp but not Tdtomato , red cells expressed Tdtomato but not Egfp , and triple-positive cells expressed both fluorescent reporters ( Figure S3 ). Unsupervised dimensionality reduction of differentially expressed genes by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) revealed that red-only and green-only single-positive cells clustered together and were distinct from triple-positive cells (with a cophenetic coefficient for k = 2 of 0.9953, indicating near-perfect clustering of the data into two groups) ( Figure 7 A). Similarly, when all six sorted cell populations were analyzed, single-positive cells clustered together away from triple-positive cells, regardless of whether they were positioned in the marrow or bone surface (with a cophenetic coefficient for k = 2 of 0.9962, indicating near-perfect clustering into two groups) ( Figure 7 B). Analysis of canonical osteoclast genes ( Nfatc1 , Tnfrsf11a , Csf1r , Acp5 , Ctsk , and Atp6v0d2 ) revealed that they were expressed by triple-positive, but not single-positive, cells from both sites ( Figure 7 C). These data suggest that triple-positive cells from bone are osteoclasts and related to triple-positive cells from the marrow.
To discover hidden classes of cells within the dataset, we next asked if a model in which k = 3 also fitted the data. This analysis showed that triple-positive cells from bone (osteoclasts) clustered in one group, triple-positive cells from marrow (osteomorphs) clustered in a second group, and single-positive cells from both bone and marrow clustered together in a third group (with cophenetic coefficient for k = 3 of 0.9875, indicating extremely good clustering of the data into three groups) ( Figure 7 D). These three cell clusters can be visualized by their expression of metagenes 1, 2, and 3 ( Figure 7 E). Comparison of triple-positive marrow osteomorphs to single-positive macrophage precursors revealed 581 upregulated genes ( Table S1 ). 430 of the 581 (74%) genes upregulated by triple-positive marrow osteomorphs were also upregulated by triple-positive osteoclasts, indicating overlap in their gene expression profile ( Figure 7 F; Table S1 ). On the other hand, these 430 genes comprised only 23% of the 1,885 genes upregulated by triple-positive bone osteoclasts compared to single-positive macrophage precursors, suggesting that expression of a large number of these genes has been downregulated in marrow osteomorphs ( Figure 7 F). Osteoclasts expressed higher levels of Ctsk and Atp6v0d2 than osteomorphs ( Figure 7 C). Interestingly, 151 of the 581 (26%) genes upregulated by osteomorphs were not upregulated by osteoclasts ( Figure 7 F). This suggests that these two triple-positive cell populations, while similar on one level, are distinct on another. These data demonstrate that osteomorphs in the marrow, derived from the fission of osteoclasts on bone, are transcriptionally distinct from osteoclasts and macrophages.
To cross-validate the scRNA-seq data, we performed FACS analysis of a number of osteomorph upregulated genes that encode cell-surface proteins ( Figure S3 ). This confirmed that AXL, CD11b, CCR3, VCAM1, CD74, and CADM1 are expressed at higher levels on the surface of osteomorphs than macrophages. These markers may therefore be useful to identify osteomorphs in non-chimeric mice and humans.
To determine the role of osteomorph upregulated genes in bone biology, we screened mice with single gene deletions that have undergone skeletal phenotyping by our Origin of Bone and Cartilage Disease (OBCD) program ( Freudenthal et al., 2016 23. Freudenthal, B. ∙ Logan, J. ∙ Croucher, P.I. ..., Sanger Institute Mouse Pipelines Rapid phenotyping of knockout mice to identify genetic determinants of bone strength J. Endocrinol. 2016; 231 :R31-R46 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of the 581 upregulated osteomorph genes, detailed phenotyping was available for 40 mouse lines in which one or both copies of the gene had been deleted ( Figure 7 G; Table S2 ). Seventeen (42.5%) of these lines had structural and/or functional phenotypes. Six of the 17, cellular adhesion molecule 1 ( Cadm1 ), lamin A/C ( Lmna ), leptin receptor gene-related protein ( Leprot ), myosin VIIA ( Myo7a ), NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 2 ( Nsun2 ), and solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1 ( Slco2b1 ) were in genes with an established role in the skeleton ( Figure 7 G; Bassett et al., 2012 7. Bassett, J.H. ∙ Gogakos, A. ∙ White, J.K. ..., Sanger Mouse Genetics Project Rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 100 knockout mice identifies 9 new genes that determine bone strength PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002858 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other 11 were in genes not previously annotated in the Gene Ontology (GO) or Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) databases to have skeletal terms or bone phenotypes, suggesting they may be regulators of skeletal function. Two of the 11 genes (bisphosphoglycerate mutase, Bpgm , and F-box protein 7, Fbxo7 ) were significantly upregulated in osteomorphs but not in osteoclasts compared to macrophages. Structural and functional data for three examples of the 17 genes are shown: the DEAD-box helicase 56 (Ddx56 ), an ATP-dependent RNA helicase; Myo7a , a motor protein associated with Usher syndrome type 1B in humans ( Weil et al., 1995 76. Weil, D. ∙ Blanchard, S. ∙ Kaplan, J. ... Defective myosin VIIA gene responsible for Usher syndrome type 1B Nature. 1995; 374 :60-61 Crossref Scopus (898) PubMed Google Scholar ); and the WD repeat domain 89 gene ( Wdr89 ), a microtubule-associated protein involved in brain development and autophagy ( Kannan et al., 2017 39. Kannan, M. ∙ Bayam, E. ∙ Wagner, C. ..., Sanger Mouse Genetics Project WD40-repeat 47, a microtubule-associated protein, is essential for brain development and autophagy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E9308-E9317 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 7 H–7J; Table S2 ). Ddx56 +/− mice had reduced femoral BMC, decreased trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), reduced femoral maximum load and stiffness, and reduced vertebral BMC and stiffness ( Figures 7 H–7J; Table S2 ). Myo7a −/− had reduced femoral length and cortical thickness and decreased maximum load and femoral stiffness, whereas, Wdr89 −/− had reduced femoral and vertebral BMC, femoral structural parameters, including BV/TV, Tb.Th, and trabecular separation but not functional parameters ( Figures 7 H–7J; Table S2 ). Detailed skeletal phenotyping for the other 14 mouse lines are documented in Table S2 . These data indicate that osteomorph upregulated genes play an important structural and functional role and include genes not previously known to affect the skeleton.
Analysis of 520 human orthologs of genes that define osteomorphs in the ISDS Nosology and Classification of Skeletal Disorders database ( Mortier et al., 2019 57. Mortier, G.R. ∙ Cohn, D.H. ∙ Cormier-Daire, V. ... Nosology and classification of genetic skeletal disorders: 2019 revision Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2019; 179 :2393-2419 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that 22 osteomorph genes cause monogenic skeletal dysplasia (1.5-fold enrichment, p = 0.03) ( Table S3 ). Osteomorph genes were not uniformly involved but enriched in specific groups including the “Osteopetrosis and related disorders group” (5.2-fold enrichment, p = 0.02), “Lysosomal storage diseases with skeletal involvement group” (5.3-fold, p = 2 × 10 −3 ), and the “Osteolysis group” (10-fold, p = 3 × 10 −3 ) ( Table S3 ).
To determine whether variants in human orthologs of osteomorph genes were enriched for genes associated with bone homeostasis in humans, we performed Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) competitive gene set analysis on 378,484 unrelated white European adults from the UK Biobank Study who had measures of quantitative ultrasound derived heel estimated BMD (eBMD) ( Bycroft et al., 2018 13. Bycroft, C. ∙ Freeman, C. ∙ Petkova, D. ...

Morris, J.A. ∙ Kemp, J.P. ∙ Youlten, S.E. ..., 23andMe Research Team An atlas of genetic influences on osteoporosis in humans and mice Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :258-266 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene-based tests of association detected significant gene-wide associations between eBMD and 71 of 520 osteomorph human orthologs (P MULTI < 2.6 × 10 −6 ; Figure 7 K; Table S3 ). Notably, two of these genes, Cadm1 and Plxnb2 (plexin-B2), were deleted in mice in the OBCD database and shown to have skeletal phenotypes ( Table S2 ). Furthermore, mutations in six of genes also caused monogenic skeletal disorders ( IARS2 , DNMT3A , MMP14 , ARSB , TBXAS1 , and CSF1R ) in humans ( Table S3 ). Despite these associations, competitive gene set analysis suggested that the set of osteomorph genes, as a whole, was not enriched for eBMD-associated genes. In summary, our analysis shows that osteomorph genes cause monogenic skeletal diseases and that some of these genes are also strongly associated with eBMD, indicating that osteomorph genes play a role in the pathogenesis of both rare monogenic and common polygenic skeletal diseases like osteoporosis.

Section: Discussion

Cell-to-cell fusion is a fundamental biological process that is involved in reproduction, development, and repair in multicellular organisms. Certain cells, such as skeletal muscle cells, exist in a fused multinucleated state to efficiently and synchronously carry out their function. Other cells, such as monocyte/macrophage lineage cells, are able to carry out their phagocytic function in a mononuclear state and only fuse under specific conditions when this is inadequate. For example, in granulomas, macrophages form multinucleated giant cells that attempt to “wall off” and contain intracellular pathogens, such as mycobacteria, and chronic irritants, such as foreign bodies, that cannot be eradicated or degraded ( Anderson, 2000 4. Anderson, J.M. Multinucleated giant cells Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7 :40-47 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). In bone, monocyte/macrophage lineage cells fuse to form osteoclasts that resorb mineralized bone. It has been shown that multinucleation is required for efficient bone resorption ( Pereira et al., 2018 60. Pereira, M. ∙ Petretto, E. ∙ Gordon, S. ... Common signalling pathways in macrophage and osteoclast multinucleation J. Cell Sci. 2018; 131 :jcs216267 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and number of nuclei has been linked to bone resorption pit surface occupied by individual osteoclasts ( Boissy et al., 2002 8. Boissy, P. ∙ Saltel, F. ∙ Bouniol, C. ... Transcriptional activity of nuclei in multinucleated osteoclasts and its modulation by calcitonin Endocrinology. 2002; 143 :1913-1921 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with the intravital imaging of in vivo osteoclast dynamics in this study, which showed that osteoclasts resorb bone under steady-state conditions as shown by their uptake of fluorescent bisphosphonates. Stimulation with sRANKL promoted the fusion of these osteoclasts to form even larger polykaryons, potentially to increase their resorptive capacity.
The intravital imaging also revealed osteoclasts undergoing cell fission, in which large polykaryons separated into smaller daughter cells. This superficially resembles apoptosis, which has been reported in osteoclasts in response to external stressors, such as bisphosphonates ( Hughes et al., 1995 28. Hughes, D.E. ∙ Wright, K.R. ∙ Uy, H.L. ... Bisphosphonates promote apoptosis in murine osteoclasts in vitro and in vivo J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10 :1478-1487 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ), estrogen ( Hughes et al., 1996 29. Hughes, D.E. ∙ Dai, A. ∙ Tiffee, J.C. ... Estrogen promotes apoptosis of murine osteoclasts mediated by TGF-beta Nat. Med. 1996; 2 :1132-1136 Crossref Scopus (720) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mechanical force ( Kobayashi et al., 2000 43. Kobayashi, Y. ∙ Hashimoto, F. ∙ Miyamoto, H. ... Force-induced osteoclast apoptosis in vivo is accompanied by elevation in transforming growth factor beta and osteoprotegerin expression J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15 :1924-1934 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Apoptosis has been demonstrated in situ in histological sections by TUNEL staining ( Akiyama et al., 2005 1. Akiyama, T. ∙ Miyazaki, T. ∙ Bouillet, P. ... In vitro and in vivo assays for osteoclast apoptosis Biol. Proced. Online. 2005; 7 :48-59 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in vivo by laser scanning confocal microscopy in zebrafish ( Chatani et al., 2011 15. Chatani, M. ∙ Takano, Y. ∙ Kudo, A. Osteoclasts in bone modeling, as revealed by in vivo imaging, are essential for organogenesis in fish Dev. Biol. 2011; 360 :96-109 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). These, together with in vitro studies of osteoclast cell fate, have led to the current dogma that the fate of an osteoclast is to die by apoptosis following completion of its bone resorbing activity ( Boyce, 2013 9. Boyce, B.F. Advances in osteoclast biology reveal potential new drug targets and new roles for osteoclasts J. Bone Miner. Res. 2013; 28 :711-722 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our direct visualization of osteoclast dynamics in vivo did not reveal a single example of apoptosis in over 130 h of real-time intravital imaging. Only following deliberate induction of apoptosis by laser irradiation were apoptotic events captured in vivo . Notably, the morphological changes, subcellular size of the fragments, cellular dynamics, and tissue response during apoptosis were markedly different from those observed during cell fission. Accordingly, spontaneous osteoclast apoptosis is a rare event in vivo in contrast to the fission events, which were much more common.
Osteoclasts are able to migrate slowly over the surface of dentine slices and simultaneously resorb bone in vitro ( Søe and Delaissé, 2017 66. Søe, K. ∙ Delaissé, J.M. Time-lapse reveals that osteoclasts can move across the bone surface while resorbing J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :2026-2035 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the speed of resorbing osteoclasts in vitro is slow at <2 μm/min ( Kanehisa and Heersche, 1988 37. Kanehisa, J. ∙ Heersche, J.N. Osteoclastic bone resorption: in vitro analysis of the rate of resorption and migration of individual osteoclasts Bone. 1988; 9 :73-79 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). Actively resorbing osteoclasts induced by sRANKL are polykaryons that may be too large to migrate coordinately and efficiently over the bone surface in vivo . The disassembly of osteoclasts by fission into smaller, more motile cells in one resorption pit may thus allow them to migrate more efficiently and then rapidly reassemble by fusion into functional osteoclasts at another site. Such a scenario would be consistent with the proposal that “primary” osteoclasts at the tip of the cutting cone can undergo fission followed by fusion with “secondary” osteoclasts in the reversal-resorption surface bone remodeling units ( Lassen et al., 2017 44. Lassen, N.E. ∙ Andersen, T.L. ∙ Ploen, G.G. ... Coupling of Bone Resorption and Formation in Real Time: New Knowledge Gained From Human Haversian BMUs J. Bone Miner. Res. 2017; 32 :1395-1405 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these scenarios, asymmetric distribution of cell adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, and cytoskeletal proteins may contribute to cells budding off and moving in opposite directions, as we observed. Furthermore, separation of large polykaryons into smaller osteomorphs may allow them to persist and survive for extended periods of time until they are required again. This may explain the accumulation of osteomorphs in mice treated with OPG:Fc, and their rapid fusion to form actively resorbing osteoclasts upon OPG:Fc withdrawal. Studies examining interactions between osteoclasts, osteomorphs, osteoblasts, and osteocytes may reveal further insights into the cellular dynamics of bone turnover.
From a bioenergetic perspective, the recycling of osteoclasts during bone resorption conserves the energy cost of committing resources to recruiting precursors from the circulation and differentiating them into osteoclasts on the bone surface, resources which would otherwise be lost if osteoclasts underwent apoptosis. Moreover, when apoptosis was induced by two-photon photoablation, we observed an influx of macrophages to clear apoptotic debris, which is a further energy expenditure. Osteoclast recycling, and long-term retention of osteomorphs, represents an energy-efficient and rapid mechanism for osteoclast regeneration. Indeed, it was recently shown that osteoclasts were maintained by iterative fusion with circulating monocytic cells and that this resulted in longer-than-expected lifespan ( Jacome-Galarza et al., 2019 33. Jacome-Galarza, C.E. ∙ Percin, G.I. ∙ Muller, J.T. ... Developmental origin, functional maintenance and genetic rescue of osteoclasts Nature. 2019; 568 :541-545 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with our data and suggests that the fusion of osteomorphs with osteoclasts may also contribute to this increased lifespan.
Osteomorphs are formed by the fission of osteoclasts into smaller, more motile daughter cells that retain the ability to fuse to form functional osteoclasts. In contrast to osteoclasts that are attached to bone, osteomorphs are found in the bone marrow and blood. scRNA-seq analysis showed that osteomorphs, osteoclasts, and macrophage precursors were transcriptionally distinct cell states. The transcriptome of osteomorphs, compared to macrophages, was characterized not only by the upregulated expression of a number of canonical osteoclast genes (such as Acp5 ) but also genes not previously associated with osteoclasts (such as Bpgm and Fbxo7 ). Thus, osteomorphs are a cell type distinct from osteoclasts and their macrophage precursors.
Detailed phenotypic analysis of 40 mouse lines generated by the OBCD program showed that osteomorph upregulated genes have important roles in bone structure and function. Notably, 11 of the 17 gene knockout mice have not been previously annotated in the GO or MGI databases to have skeletal terms or bone phenotypes. Two of these ( Bpgm and Fbxo7 ) were upregulated in osteomorphs but not osteoclasts, highlighting the potential of studying osteomorphs to reveal genes and pathways involved in bone homeostasis and disease. BPGM deficiency causes a rare human disease characterized by compensatory erythrocytosis due to a left shift in the haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve ( Rosa et al., 1978 63. Rosa, R. ∙ Prehu, M.O. ∙ Beuzard, Y. ... The first case of a complete deficiency of diphosphoglycerate mutase in human erythrocytes J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62 :907-915 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be interesting to determine if these patients also have a skeletal phenotype. Moreover, Fbxo7 has been shown to positively regulate bone morphogenetic protein signaling ( Kang and Chung, 2015 38. Kang, J. ∙ Chung, K.C. The F-box protein FBXO7 positively regulates bone morphogenetic protein-mediated signaling through Lys-63-specific ubiquitination of neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE (NRAGE) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72 :181-195 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing a potential mechanism for the skeletal phenotype in Fbxo7 knockout mice. The clinical significance of osteomorphs to human disease is further exemplified by the finding that 23 osteomorph upregulated genes were involved in the pathogenesis of rare monogenic skeletal dysplasias and 71 were associated with eBMD. Together, these data indicate that osteomorphs and their genes may be implicated in the pathogenesis of rare monogenic skeletal dysplasias and common polygenic bone diseases such as osteoporosis.
A consequence of osteoclast recycling is that it allows a committed pool of cells to be maintained during periods of inactivity that are primed to respond rapidly to changing conditions. Indeed, inhibition of cell fusion by OPG:Fc disrupted recycling and resulted in the accumulation of osteomorphs, which were available to rapidly fuse and generate active osteoclasts following OPG:Fc withdrawal. While the scRNA-seq data showed osteomorphs expressed Acp5 mRNA, we did not detect the accumulation of small osteomorphs with TRAP enzyme activity in the bone marrow by histomorphometry. This may suggest that while osteomorphs do not express TRAP protein at baseline, they are poised to express the protein when they are required to resorb bone again. This separation between Acp5 gene and TRAP protein expression has also been described in osteocytes ( Youlten et al., 2020 83. Youlten, S.E. ∙ Kemp, J.P. ∙ Logan, J.G. ... Osteocyte Transcriptome Mapping Identifies a Molecular Landscape Controlling Skeletal Homeostasis and Susceptibility to Skeletal Disease bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Regardless, osteoclast recycling provides a mechanism to explain the recent emergence of a rebound phenomenon, in which some patients have been reported to develop accelerated bone loss and rebound vertebral fractures 3–16 months after cessation of anti-RANKL treatment ( Anastasilakis et al., 2017a 2. Anastasilakis, A.D. ∙ Polyzos, S.A. ∙ Makras, P. ...

Int. 2018; 29 :41-47 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be interesting to see if aberrant osteoclast recycling underlies skeletal diseases such as Paget’s disease and giant cell tumors, where there may be dysregulated cell fission/fusion cycles. Osteoclast recycling therefore not only provides a paradigm for understanding the behavior of these cells in their physiological niche in vivo but also a framework for understanding drug effects on bone homeostasis. Our study has revealed a suite of genes upregulated by osteomorphs, many of which have not been previously known to be involved in bone resorption. The bone phenotypes when these genes are deleted in mice and their role in monogenic skeletal dysplasias and association with eBMD confirm the important role of osteomorphs in bone homeostasis and disease and mark them as a valuable resource for future drug discovery.

C57BL/6J mice were either from the Australian Resources Centre (Canning Vale, WA) or Australian BioResources (Moss Vale, NSW). All mice were bred and maintained on a C57BL/6J background under specific-pathogen free (SPF) conditions. Animal experiments were performed at the Garvan Institute Biological Testing Facility. All animal holding areas in both facilities are maintained within a constant temperature of 21.4þC with humidity range to avoid animal stress and to minimize experimental variability. Lighting mimics 12 h day/night cycles to stimulate circadian rhythms. For mixed bone marrow chimeras, 7-20 weeks-old female mice were used as donors and 7-12 weeks-old female mice were used as recipients. Bone marrow reconstitution was confirmed by FACS analysis of peripheral blood and imaging and FACS-based experiments were performed 8-14 weeks later.
C57BL/KaLwRijHsd (BKAL) female mice (Harlan, Netherlands) were obtained from the Australian BioResources (Moss Vale, NSW). All mice were bred and maintained on a C57BL/KaLwRijHsd background under specific-pathogen free conditions. Animal experiments were performed at the Garvan Institute Biological Testing Facility. All animal holding areas in both facilities are maintained within a constant temperature of 21.4þC with humidity range to avoid animal stress and to minimize experiment variability. Lighting in animal rooms ensures 12 h’ light and 12 h’ darkness with a dawn / dusk simulation. 8-10 week old female mice were used for OPG:Fc and sRANKL treatment studies.
The OBCD program performed high-throughput multiparameter skeletal phenotyping of mouse lines generated by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) as part of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) ( Bassett et al., 2012 7. Bassett, J.H. ∙ Gogakos, A. ∙ White, J.K. ..., Sanger Mouse Genetics Project Rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 100 knockout mice identifies 9 new genes that determine bone strength PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002858 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Experiments were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free unit under a 12 h’ light and 12 h’ dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food (Mouse Breeders Diet, LabDiets 5021-3, IPS, Richmond, USA). Mice underwent a standardized primary phenotype screen ( https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress ) ( de Angelis et al., 2015 18. de Angelis, M.H. ∙ Nicholson, G. ∙ Selloum, M. ..., EUMODIC Consortium Analysis of mammalian gene function through broad-based phenotypic screens across a consortium of mouse clinics Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :969-978 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Primary culture experiments were carried out in a certified PC2 laboratory. Cell viability were determined using trypan blue and an automated cell counter counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cells were maintained in a 5% CO 2 incubator at 37°C and experiments were conducted in a Class 2 BioSafety certified cabinet.
To generate osteoclast reporter mice, we lethally irradiated 7-12 weeks-old C57BL/6J recipient mice with 950-990 rads in split doses 6 h apart. Irradiated mice were rescued with 3-10 × 10 6 bone marrow cells from Lysm Cre/+ . Tdtomato LSL/LSL and Blimp-1 Egfp/+ . Rag1 −/− or Csf1r Egfp/+ mice in a ratio of 1:4 for Blimp-1 Egfp/+ . Rag1 −/− and 1:1 for Csf1r Egfp/+ donors. Chimeric mice were analyzed 8-14 weeks later following bone marrow reconstitution.
Recombinant GST-RANKL158–316 (sRANKL) was produced using a bacterial construct provided by Dr. F. Patrick Ross (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). For in vivo experiments, sRANKL was administered at a dose of 1mg/kg i.p daily for 3 days or 2mg/kg i.p once. OPG:Fc (Amgen Inc) was administered at a dose of 10mg/kg i.p. twice weekly for 2 weeks or as a single treatment. Control mice received saline. Clodronate was administered at a dose of 30mg/kg i.p up to 3 times a week.
Mice were injected via the tail vein with 50μl of either the quenched cathepsin K substrate (Cat K 680 FAST) 4 h before imaging, or the fluorescent inactive bisphosphonate OsteoSense 680EX (both from Perkin Elmer) 24 h before imaging. Intravital two-photon microscopy was performed on the tibia ( Lawson et al., 2015 45. Lawson, M.A. ∙ McDonald, M.M. ∙ Kovacic, N. ... Osteoclasts control reactivation of dormant myeloma cells by remodelling the endosteal niche Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8983 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were anaesthetized with 100mg/kg ketamine/5mg/kg xylazine and maintained on 1%–2% isoflurane supplemented with 100% oxygen. Mice were kept warm on a custom heated SmartStage (Biotherm) set to 38þC. An incision was made in the skin overlying the tibia and soft tissue resected. The exposed tibia was immobilised on a base of thermal conductive T-putty (Thermagon Inc.) and a waterproof seal made around the edges with silicone grease (Beckman Coulter). Imaging was performed on a Zeiss 7MP two-photon microscope (Carl Zeiss) powered by a Chameleon Vision II Ti-Sa laser (Coherent Scientific). Excitation wavelengths used were 870nm or 920nm to detect Cat K 680 FAST (Perkin Elmer) and OsteoSense 680EX and 920nm to detect tdTomato and GFP. Fluorescent images were acquired with a LBF 760 and BSMP 760 to enable detection of far-red signals. Non-descanned detectors were SP 485 (blue second harmonic), BP 500-550 (GFP), BP 565-610 (tdTomato) and BP 640-710 (Alexa Fluor 680). 425 × 425 × 150 μm imaging volumes were acquired with a W Plan-Apochromat 20 × /1.0 DIC (UV)Vis-IR water immersion objective at a resolution of 0.83 μm/pixel. Optical sections were acquired at 2-3 μm z-step intervals and time lapse images were acquired every 20-90 s intervals. Individual mice were imaged for up to 8 h. For induction of apoptosis, laser photoablation was performed with localized irradiation of a small region of interest (ROI) at 840nm with real-time registration of the photoconverted red signal ( Chtanova et al., 2014 16. Chtanova, T. ∙ Hampton, H.R. ∙ Waterhouse, L.A. ... Real-time interactive two-photon photoconversion of recirculating lymphocytes for discontinuous cell tracking in live adult mice J. Biophotonics. 2014; 7 :425-433 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Raw image files were imported into Imaris (Bitplane). All images were processed with a weighted Gaussian filter. In some cases, individual TIFF generated frames were then processed with a blind deconvolution program written in MATLAB following processing to avoid the ringing effect of deconvolution. The PSF of the image frame was retrieved during the deconvolution process. Files were reassembled in Imaris and further thresholds and filters applied where necessary. When required, sample motion in time series data were corrected using the open source package Galene ( Warren et al., 2018 75. Warren, S.C. ∙ Nobis, M. ∙ Magenau, A. ... Removing physiological motion from intravital and clinical functional imaging data eLife. 2018; 7 :e35800 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). The three dimensional sample motion within each stack relative to a reference stack in the middle of the time series was estimated using an approach based on the Lucas-Kanade framework ( Baker and Matthews, 2004 6. Baker, S. ∙ Matthews, I. Lucas-Kanade 20 Years On: A Unifying Framework International Journal of Computer Vision. 2004; 56 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (2432) Google Scholar ), accounting for the microscope scan pattern. The displacement at 500 reference points evenly spaced through the data was iteratively refined using a trust-region algorithm, minimizing the difference between the current and reference frame. For alignment, only the stationary SHG or far-red channels were used. The data in each channel was resampled correcting for the motion to produce a time series aligned with the reference frame. Large volume datasets were broken up into smaller files and analyzed separately and subsequently reassembled. Cell fate mapping trees were generated by a blinded observer manually tracking each cell frame-by-frame, across multiple movies. Analysis of cell fate mapping trees allowed the number of fission and fusion events (/h) and the proportion of cells undergoing fission or fusion events (%) in each treatment group to be measured. Time-lapse images were exported, compiled and annotated in AfterEffects (Adobe), and movies converted using MacX Video Converter Pro v6.0.2, (Digiarty Software). For static data generation, each image analyzed was from an individual mouse. Surfaces generated based on the red signal in cells that co-express red, green and OsteoSense 680 in a semi-automated manner using the Create Surface function in Imaris, under the supervision of a blinded observer, to quantify their sphericity and volume. Data were exported into R and the MASS package ( Venables and Ripley, 2013 73. Venables, W.N. ∙ Ripley, B.D. Modern applied statistics with S-PLUS Springer Science & Business Media, 2013 Google Scholar ) was used to calculate the 2D kernel density estimation, data visualized using the ggplot2 package ( Wickham, 2016 77. Wickham, H. ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis Springer, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ) in R. The FilamentTracer module in Imaris was used to quantify observable cell processes and networks formed by cell-cell contracts with neighboring cells. While this tool may include migrating cells in a network with osteoclasts, direct examination showed these events were rare relative to the scale of the networks and did not affect the overall result. Contacts between LYSM + mononuclear/macrophage cells and LYSM + CSF1R + osteoclasts were manually tracked through individual frames by a blinded observer.
Primary mouse bone marrow macrophages were cultured directly on glass-bottom culture dishes (35mm Petri dish, 10mm microwell with no. 0 cover glass) (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA) under osteoclastogenic conditions (100ng/mL RANKL and 25ng/mL M-CSF) for a period of 4 to 7 days. Prior to imaging, osteoclasts were incubated with wheat germ agglutinin, Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugate (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or OsteoSense 680EX Fluorescent Imaging Agent (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and Hoechst 33258 (bis-benzimide) (Molecular Probes Eugene, OR, USA) according to manufacturers’ instructions. Osteoclasts were imaged using the NIKON A1Si confocal microscope equipped with 20x (dry) and 60x (oil) immersion lenses (Nikon, Melville, NY, USA) under controlled atmospheric conditions (37°C and 5% CO 2 /air) in a Tokai Hit Stage Top incubator (INUG2E-TIZ, Fujinomiya-shi, Shizuoka-ken, Japan). Frames were captured every 2 or 10 min for 2 h or overnight using NIS-C Elements software (Nikon). Cell surface areas and cumulative cell trajectories were analyzed using FIJI and the MtrackJ plug-in ( Meijering et al., 2012 53. Meijering, E. ∙ Dzyubachyk, O. ∙ Smal, I. Methods for cell and particle tracking Methods Enzymol. 2012; 504 :183-200 Crossref Scopus (1089) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Faxitron Ultrafocus DXA, Hologic, USA) was performed weekly or fortnightly on anaesthetised mice under 3%–5% inhaled isoflurane. Analysis of the hind limb was performed using Vision DXA (Hologic, USA) using a manually drawn region of interest encompassing the left hind limb to quantify Bone mineral density (BMD).
Bones were scanned with a μCT scanner (Model 1172, Skyscan) at 50kV, 200mA with a 0.5mm aluminum filter using a pixel size of 4.3 μm. Images were acquired every 0.4þ through 180þ and analyzed with NRecon and CTAn software (Skyscan). 3D models were generated using the Drishti-2 tool ( Limaye, 2012 47. Limaye, A. Drishti: a volume exploration and presentation tool Proceedings of SPIE Optical Engineering + Applications (SPIE). 2012; 8506 Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar ).
To identify osteoclasts, femora from mice were fixed in 4% PFA and decalcified in 0.34M EDTA before being processed to paraffin blocks. 5μm thick sections were stained for TRAP ( Lawson et al., 2015 45. Lawson, M.A. ∙ McDonald, M.M. ∙ Kovacic, N. ... Osteoclasts control reactivation of dormant myeloma cells by remodelling the endosteal niche Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8983 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ). Osteomeasure (Osteometrics) was used to quantify osteoclast and osteoblast parameters on endosteal surfaces using standard methods. Analysis of osteoclast parameters on trabecular bone was quantified as number of TRAP+ multinucleated cells per unit area as mature trabecular bone surfaces were difficult to define due to retention of primary spongiosa bone in mice treated with OPG:Fc.
Serum collected by retro-orbital bleeds, under isoflurane anesthesia, throughout animal phases were stored at −70þ C and then assessed for TRAP levels using the MouseTRAP (TRAcP 5b) ELISA kit (Immunodiagnostic System Ltd) following manufacturers guidelines.
Bone marrow cells were harvested from the mouse long bones by flushing with MEM, then cultured in 6mm diameter culture wells containing dentine slices (a kind gift of Dr Damian Myers, the University of Melbourne, Australia) in MEM/FBS with 25 ng/mL of M-CSF (University of Queensland Protein Expression Facility, St Lucia, Australia) and 0, 20 and 50ng/mL of recombinant RANKL (Oriental Yeast Company, Tokyo, Japan) in quintuplicate replicate cultures. Cells were cultured for 6 days; medium and mediators were replaced on day 3. Cells were then fixed and stained for TRAP ( Quinn et al., 1999 62. Quinn, J.M. ∙ Morfis, M. ∙ Lam, M.H. ... Calcitonin receptor antibodies in the identification of osteoclasts Bone. 1999; 25 :1-8 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Osteoclasts (defined as TRAP+ multinucleated cells containing 3 3 nuclei) were then counted by brightfield microscopy (Leica DM4000). Imaging guide lines were scored onto the dentine surface using a scalpel and the whole surface scanned using a Leica DM6000 PowerMosaic to produce a high resolution (x20) tiled image. To detect and image the resorption pits, cells were removed from the dentine surface using chloroform/methanol extraction (3:1) than rubbed face down on smooth paper to remove attached debris. The dentine was then dehydrated through industrial methylated spirits and allowed to air-dry on Whatman paper then mounted on double-sided carbon tape and coated with 15 nm of carbon using a benchtop carbon coater (Agar Scientific). Disc surfaces were imaged in high vacuum (< 1 pascal) using a Vega scanning electron microscope (Tescan UK, Cambridge) software v4.2.24.0, and 4-quadrant back-scattered electron detector with software v1.1 (Deben, UK). Dentine slices were imaged then using the ImageSnapper automated image acquisition plug-in at a working distance of 15 mm with a 20 kV electron beam at 138–2000x magnification, with 3x frame averaging at scan speed 5. Images of the stained cells and SEM images of the pits on the same surface were then merged and carefully aligned using the scored guide lines in Adobe Photoshop.
LYSM + CSF1R + double-labeled cells were FACS sorted from the bone marrow chimeric mice and incubated in vitro in glass bottom 16mm diameter wells at ∼4 × 10 4 cells per well containing unlabelled primary osteoclasts and stimulated to form osteoclasts with 100ng/mL sRANKL and 25ng/mL M-CSF in αMEM medium containing 10% FBS (with Glutamax and HEPES). Microscopy was performed at x20 on a Leica DMI 6000 SP8 microscope. Sorted LYSM + CSF1R + cells were also plated onto established explant calvaria from 3- to 4-day-old Balb/C mice in 24-well plate wells with αMEM media. To enhance recycling osteoclast growth on calvaria, primary osteoclasts from C57BL/6J were differentiated on the calvaria cultures for 3-4 days with RANKL and M-CSF as above. 18,000 or 40,000 recycling cells were plated in 80 μL neat FCS onto each calvarium and left to attach at 37þC for 4 h before adding 0.5ml αMEM with 200ng/mL RANKL and 25ng/mL M-CSF in αMEM media. Cells were incubated for 6 days with media change at day 3 before staining with Hoechst (1:20,000 in PBS) and OsteoSense 680 (1:10,000 in PBS) and imaged in 10mm culture plates in PBS. Fluorescent images were acquired with a LBF 760 and BSMP 760 to enable detection of far-red signals. Non-descanned detectors were SP 485 (blue second harmonic), BP 500-550 (GFP), BP 565-610 (tdTomato) and BP 640-710 (Alexa Fluor 680). 425 × 425 × 150 μm imaging volumes were acquired with a W Plan-Apochromat 20 × /1.0 DIC (UV)Vis-IR water immersion objective at a resolution of 0.83 μm/pixel. Optical sections were acquired at 2 μm z-step intervals.
Bone marrow chimeric mice were injected with 3 doses of AF647-Zol (BioVinc, Pasadena, CA, USA) over 7 days prior to analysis. Mice were sacrificed, long bones were harvested and soft tissue was removed. Cells in the bone marrow were flushed from the long bones with PBS. Cells adherent to the bone were isolated from the remaining marrow-depleted bone fraction through two rounds of enzymatic digestion with collagenase A (2mg/mL) and dispase (2mg/mL) for 15 min at 37°C. Red blood cell lysis was performed using ammonium chloride prior to isolation of individual cells for flow cytometric analysis and FACS sorting.
Expression of osteomorph markers were assessed on viable bone marrow cells by multicolor flow cytometry (FACSymphony; BD Biosciences, North Ryde, Australia). Cells collected from the bone and marrow fractions were incubated in (1:200) Fc-block for 10mins and subsequently stained for 30mins on ice in the dark with the indicated antibodies. Cells were washed in FACS buffer (2% FCS in PBS) and stained with DAPI before analysis.
Individual single-positive (LYSM + CSF1R neg ZOL neg or LYSM neg CSF1R + ZOL neg ) and triple-positive cells (LYSM + CSF1R + ZOL + ) were FACS sorted from the marrow and bone surface of mixed irradiation bone marrow chimeras as above into 384-well plates containing 3μl of deposition buffer (0.9% Superase-In RNase Inhibitor (20 U/μl); 0.9% RNasin® Plus RNase Inhibitor 40 U/μl; Nuclease-free water; 0.05% 10x GeneAmp PCR buffer without MgCl). cDNA was generated and amplified for 22 cycles using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara Bio) and steps were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol at half reaction volumes ( Khoo et al., 2019 41. Khoo, W.H. ∙ Ledergor, G. ∙ Weiner, A. ... A niche-dependent myeloid transcriptome signature defines dormant myeloma cells Blood. 2019; 134 :30-43 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Libraries were generated using NexteraXT library prep kit (Illumina) using 1ng of input. Subsequent steps were performed according to manufacturer’s instruction at half reaction volumes.
Library pools were paired-end sequenced at 2x150 base pair on an Illumina NextSeq500 platform.
Library pools were de-multiplexed with the standard Illumina pipeline. Reads were trimmed twice by cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 51. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads 17 Google Scholar ) to remove NexteraXT indexes and SMARTer 3¢ CDS primer IIA and 5¢ IIA oligonucleotide sequences. Trimmed reads were mapped to mouse genome (mm10) reference library with the addition of Egfp , Tdtomato and ERCC spike-in control references. Alignments were performed using STAR 2.4.1 ( Dobin et al., 2013 21. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25615) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expression count quantitated using RSEM ( Li and Dewey, 2011 46. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13399) PubMed Google Scholar ) using default parameters.
Noise reduction, highly variable genes determination and differential gene expression (DGE) analyses were performed using BASiCS package ( Vallejos et al., 2015 71. Vallejos, C.A. ∙ Marioni, J.C. ∙ Richardson, S. BASiCS: Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing Data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004333 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vallejos et al., 2016 72. Vallejos, C.A. ∙ Richardson, S. ∙ Marioni, J.C. Beyond comparisons of means: understanding changes in gene expression at the single-cell level Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :70 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) in R.
To determine the osteomorph upregulated genes, DGE analysis was performed by comparing LYSM + CSF1R + ZOL + populations from the marrow fraction to the combined single-positive (LYSM + CSF1R neg and LYSM neg CSF1R + ) populations from the bone and marrow fraction.
Highly variable genes identified within the datasets were clustered using non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) algorithm ( Moran et al., 2018 55. Moran, I. ∙ Nguyen, A. ∙ Khoo, W.H. ... Memory B cells are reactivated in subcapsular proliferative foci of lymph nodes Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :3372 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ) using NMF package in R ( Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2010 25. Gaujoux, R. ∙ Seoighe, C. A flexible R package for nonnegative matrix factorization BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :367 Crossref Scopus (863) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Anonymized left lower limb and tail samples from 16-week-old female wild-type and knockout mice were stored in 70% ethanol at 4þC, and randomly assigned to batches for rapid-throughput analysis (n = 2-6 mice per line). Overall, 19 skeletal parameters were determined for each individual mouse studied. Depending on the precise genetic background of the mutant line, parameters were compared to reference data obtained from either 320 16-weeks-old wild-type C57BL/6NTac female mice or 99 16-weeks-old wild-type C57BL/6Dnk female mice ( Table S2 ). Coefficients of variation for each skeletal parameter were: femur BMC (2.0%) and length (2.1%); vertebra BMC (2.1%) and length (2.3%); trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (18.5%), trabecular number (7.3%), trabecular thickness (7.9%) and trabecular spacing (8.3%); cortical bone thickness (4.3%), internal diameter (6.0%) and BMD (4.0%); femur yield load (13.2%), maximum load (10.0%), fracture load (29.0%), stiffness (13.7%) and energy dissipated before fracture (26.7%); and vertebra yield load (13.0%), maximum load (10.3%) and stiffness (13.3%).
Following removal of soft tissue digital X-ray images were recorded at a 10 μM resolution using a Faxitron MX20 operating at 26kV (Qados, Cross Technologies plc, Sandhurst, Berkshire, UK). All lower limb and caudal vertebrae 6 and 7 were imaged with 1mm diameter steel, aluminum and polyester standards. Bone lengths and relative bone mineral content (BMC) were determined as previously described ( Bassett et al., 2012 7. Bassett, J.H. ∙ Gogakos, A. ∙ White, J.K. ..., Sanger Mouse Genetics Project Rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 100 knockout mice identifies 9 new genes that determine bone strength PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002858 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, lengths were determined using ImageJ calibrated with an X-ray image of a digital micrometre. To determine relative BMC, 2368x2340 16-bit DICOM images were converted to 8-bit Tiff images in ImageJ. This process used the modal gray level of the polyester standard to define gray level zero and the modal gray level of the steel standard to define gray level 255 in the final Tiff image. Increasing gradations of mineralization density were represented in 16 equal intervals by applying a pseudocolor lookup table. For each sample the median gray level (0-255) of the femur and caudal vertebrae 6 and 7 was determined.
Cortical and trabecular parameters were determined using a Scanco uCT50 (Scanco medical, Zurich, Switzerland). Samples were scanned at 70kV, 200 μA, with a 0.5mm aluminum filter, 1 s integration time, no averaging, and images captured every 0.36° though 180° rotation. Reconstructions, ROI selection and analyses were performed using Scanco software. Trabecular bone parameters (Trabecular bone volume BV/TV, trabecular number Tb.N, Trabecular thickness Tb.Th, and trabecular spacing Tb.Sp) were calculated from scans performed at a voxel resolution of 5 μm in a 1mm region of the trabecular compartment beginning 100 μm proximal to the distal femoral growth plate. Cortical bone parameters (Cortical thickness Ct.Th, Internal endosteal diameter, and BMD) were calculated from scans performed at voxel resolution of 10 μm in a 1.5mm long region of mid-shaft cortical bone centered 56% along the length of the femur distal to the femoral head.
Biomechanical testing was undertaken using an Instron 5543 load frame (Instron Limited, High Wycombe, UK). Femur strength and toughness (yield load, maximum load, fracture load, stiffness, % energy dissipated prior to fracture) were derived from destructive three-point bend testing using a 50-N load cell and custom mounts with rounded supports. Femurs were positioned horizontally with their anterior surface upward between two mounting points with a span of 8mm. Load was applied vertically to the mid-shaft with a constant rate of displacement of 0.03mm/second until fracture. The biomechanical properties of caudal vertebrae 6 and 7 (yield load, maximum load and stiffness) were derived from compression testing using a 500-N load cell and two custom anvils. Individual vertebrae were bonded in vertical alignment to the lower custom anvil using cyanoacrylate glue and load was applied vertically at a constant rate of displacement of 0.03 mm/s until approximately 1mm of displacement had occurred ( Bassett et al., 2012 7. Bassett, J.H. ∙ Gogakos, A. ∙ White, J.K. ..., Sanger Mouse Genetics Project Rapid-throughput skeletal phenotyping of 100 knockout mice identifies 9 new genes that determine bone strength PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002858 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To establish known associations of osteomorph genes to bone, genes defining osteomorphs were queried in the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), Mouse Genome Informatics, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. World Wide Web (URL: http://www.informatics.jax.org , March 2020 release; accessed November 2020) and Gene Onotologies (GO) retrieved from the ENSEMBL database ( Yates et al., 2020 80. Yates, A.D. ∙ Achuthan, P. ∙ Akanni, W. ... Ensembl 2020 Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 :D682-D688 PubMed Google Scholar ) using BiomaRt in R (Ensembl release 101, August 2020; accessed November 2020). String matching was performed using a list of bone-related terms (“bone,” “skele,” “osteo,” “chondro,” “cartil,” “clast,” “tooth,” “odont,” “dentin,” “joint,” “limb,” “ossif,” “suture,” “digit”) and further refinement to remove “cytoskeleton” and “muscle” strings from the descriptions from the MGD and GO databases to identify known bone-related associations to the osteomorph upregulated genes.
Fisher’s exact test of independence was used in conjunction with ISDS Nosology and Classification of Skeletal Disorders database ( Mortier et al., 2019 57. Mortier, G.R. ∙ Cohn, D.H. ∙ Cormier-Daire, V. ... Nosology and classification of genetic skeletal disorders: 2019 revision Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2019; 179 :2393-2419 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ) to investigate whether human orthologs of osteomorph defining genes were enriched for genes that cause monogenic skeletal disorders. The following parameters were used: (A) Successes in sample - the number of differentially expressed mouse genes that defined osteomorphs and that map to unique human orthologs that cause one or more skeletal disorders (either total or within each individual nosology-defined skeletal disorder groups). (B) Sample size - the number of differentially expressed mouse genes that defined osteomorphs within the population of genes for which gene expression was observed in any cell type, and that map to unique human orthologs. (C) Successes in population - the number of mouse genes for which expression was observed in any cell type, and that map to unique human orthologs that cause one or more skeletal disorders (either total or within each individual nosology-defined skeletal disorder groups). (D) Population - the number of mouse genes that are expressed in any cell type and that map to unique human orthologs. Estimates of enrichment were obtained using the online Hypergeometric p value calculator ( https://systems.crump.ucla.edu/hypergeometric ).
Unique mouse ENSEMBL – human ENSEMBL orthologs of all protein-coding genes were mapped using BiomaRt in R (Ensembl release 75 - February 2014). MAGMA competitive gene-set analysis ( de Leeuw et al., 2015 19. de Leeuw, C.A. ∙ Mooij, J.M. ∙ Heskes, T. ... MAGMA: generalized gene-set analysis of GWAS data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004219 Crossref Scopus (1560) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to investigate whether human orthologs of osteomorph defining genes were on average more strongly associated with quantitative ultrasound derived heel eBMD, than all other protein coding genes in the human genome.
MAGMA analysis was performed on a sample of 378,484 unrelated white European subjects (54% female, plink1.9 / 2 ( Chang et al., 2015 14. Chang, C.C. ∙ Chow, C.C. ∙ Tellier, L.C. ... Second-generation PLINK: rising to the challenge of larger and richer datasets Gigascience. 2015; 4 :7 Crossref Scopus (6020) PubMed Google Scholar ) pairwise kinship co-efficient < 0.044) from the UK Biobank Study (UKB) ( Bycroft et al., 2018 13. Bycroft, C. ∙ Freeman, C. ∙ Petkova, D. ... The UK Biobank resource with deep phenotyping and genomic data Nature. 2018; 562 :203-209 Crossref Scopus (3686) PubMed Google Scholar ) that had valid eBMD measures and high-quality genome-wide HRC and 1000G/UK10K imputed data from the January 2018 release [(i.e., ∼17M genetic variants with an information quality score > 0.9, minor allele frequency > 0.05%, minor allele count > 1, genotyping hard call rate > 0.95, and weak evidence of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 1x10 −6 )]. Details of how eBMD was defined and criteria for including individuals in the study are detailed in the original publications ( Kemp et al., 2017 40. Kemp, J.P. ∙ Morris, J.A. ∙ Medina-Gomez, C. ... Identification of 153 new loci associated with heel bone mineral density and functional involvement of GPC6 in osteoporosis Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1468-1475 Crossref Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morris et al., 2019 56. Morris, J.A. ∙ Kemp, J.P. ∙ Youlten, S.E. ..., 23andMe Research Team An atlas of genetic influences on osteoporosis in humans and mice Nat. Genet. 2019; 51 :258-266 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gene-based tests of association were conducted in MAGMA (v1.08) ( de Leeuw et al., 2016 20. de Leeuw, C.A. ∙ Neale, B.M. ∙ Heskes, T. ... The statistical properties of gene-set analysis Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :353-364 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) using imputed individual level genotype data for the analyses involving eBMD. Analyses involving eBMD were further adjusted for age, sex, genotyping array, and ancestry informative principal components 1 – 20. Gene-based tests of association encompassed a multi-model approach in which the association results from different gene analysis models were combined to produce an aggregate p value corresponding to the strength of evidence of association between each protein coding gene (+2kb upstream/1kb downstream) and eBMD. The three association models included: a principal components regression model, a SNP-wise mean χ2 model [ i.e . test statistic derived as the sum of −log(SNP p value) for all SNPs that intersect the gene region of interest], and SNP-wise top χ2 model [(test statistic derived as the sum of −log(SNP p value) for top SNP in the region of interest)]. The aggregate approach was chosen as it yields a more even distribution of statistical power and sensitivity over a wider range of different genetic architectures. Importantly, due to incomplete genotyping coverage (i.e., no genetic variants were present in some genes), and gene level associations could only be estimated for 520 / 549 mappable osteomorph orthologs and 11,500 / 12,278 mappable orthologs with background expression and 16,754 / 18,184 of all mappable mouse – human orthologs.
Competitive gene set analysis was used to determine whether human orthologs of the 520 osteomorph defining genes was on average more strongly associated with eBMD than the all other protein coding genes in the genome. The analysis was conducted using default settings, and accounted for several confounding factors including: gene size, gene density (i.e., representing the relative level of Linkage Disequilibrium between SNPs in the gene) and the inverse of the mean minor allele count in the gene (i.e., to correct for potential power loss in very low minor allele count SNPs), as well the log value of these three factors.
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software (GraphPad) or in R. All data are presented as box-and-whisker plots with the mean with the whiskers representing ± 1.5 times of inter-quartile range. We used Mann-Whitney test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons.
