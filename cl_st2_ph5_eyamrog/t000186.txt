Section: ABSTRACT

The original hygiene hypothesis proposed that certain diseases derive from low levels of early-life microbial exposure. Since then, the hypothesis has been applied to numerous inflammatory, autoimmune, and allergic conditions. The changes in hygiene linked to these diseases include numerous changes in biotic exposure and lifestyle. To this end, some scholars have called for abandonment of the term or have suggested alternate labels, e.g., the old friends hypothesis. However, neither of these terms encompasses the complexity of plasticity in immune response and host–parasite/commensal interactions that influence these conditions. Here, I review this complexity, with particular regard to the factors affecting immunological strategies, the development of tolerance, immune dysfunction, and ecological interactions among organisms. I discuss the biotic factors that affect immune plasticity and how these interact with abiotic factors such as nutrition, as well as how transgenerational exposures may affect immune plasticity. Finally, I review the general features of diseases linked to biotic exposures.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Organisms walk a tightrope when responding to infections. Misdirected or exaggerated immune responses can result in damage to the self, energetic costs, and unnecessary illness. Suppressed immune response allows pathogens to replicate unchecked, potentially leading to death or compounded future immune costs. Thus, immune responses must be tightly regulated but variable, responding to and anticipating demands on the basis of information gleaned from the environment.
One such environmental cue that biases the development of immunity is childhood exposure to pathogens and parasites. In particular, practices that limit exposure to infections, i.e., hygiene and sanitation, have received considerable attention as effectors of immunological functioning, particularly as hygiene and sanitation have become much more effective in recent centuries than they are likely to have ever been in the remainder of our five to seven–million-year tenure as hominins. This idea is known as the hygiene hypothesis . The first published use of this phrase was by David Barker, who observed that cases of appendicitis rose following the introduction of piped water to a town in North Wales ( Barker et al. 1988 , Barker & Morris 1988 ). He had proposed the idea at least three years earlier, suggesting that a lack of exposure to childhood illnesses, especially among the wealthy, led to a decrease in immune responsiveness to infections ( Barker 1985 ). Even still, many sources credit Strachan (1989) for originating the hygiene hypothesis, when he noted a connection between household size and hay fever and suggested that this connection might be related to exposure to infections through contact with older siblings. 1
More recent formulations have further refined these ideas and elaborated on mechanisms. The old friends hypothesis turns the focus away from hygiene, per se, to focus instead on coevolved human–microbe interactions ( Rook & Brunet 2005 , Rook et al. 2017 ). One criticism of the original hygiene hypothesis is that it was interpreted by many to imply that exposure to childhood infectious diseases played a critical role in limiting allergy ( Bloomfield et al. 2016 , Hunter 2020 ). The old friends hypothesis instead proposes that development of the microbiome, infection with ubiquitous helminth species, and exposure to nonpathogenic microbes from the environment are the critical factors affecting immune regulation and the development of disease.
Ideas from the old friends and hygiene hypotheses have since been applied to numerous conditions, including multiple sclerosis ( Fleming et al. 2019 , Wasko et al. 2020 ), systemic lupus erythematosus ( Bach 2018 ), inflammatory bowel disease ( Panelli et al. 2020 ), allergies ( Liu 2015 , Yazdanbakhsh et al. 2002 ), Alzheimer's disease ( Angelucci et al. 2019 , Fox et al. 2013 ), cardiovascular disease ( Gurven et al. 2016 ), type 2 diabetes ( de Ruiter et al. 2017 , Gurven et al. 2016 ), autism ( Becker 2007 , Velasquez-Manoff 2013 ), and depression ( Breslau et al. 2009 , Maes 2011 ). Current formulations of the hygiene hypothesis and old friends hypothesis lean heavily on the idea of mismatch: the idea that we have stone age immune systems that misbehave in modern, evolutionarily novel environments. Mismatch is critical, but there is a broader way to examine and make predictions about how the immune system will respond under different conditions. The field of ecological immunology ( ecoimmunology ) examines variation in immune function and the environmental factors contributing to this variation ( Demas & Nelson 2012 ; Graham et al. 2011 ; Martin et al. 2011 ; McDade 2003 , 2005a ). One way that ecoimmunology examines plasticity is by hypothesizing about and investigating the functional design of immunological reaction norms. These hypotheses allow for predictions about how biotic and abiotic factors should affect immunity. Ecoimmunology in an anthropological context also allows us to think more broadly about the definitions of what constitutes “normal” immune function ( Wiley 2021 , Wiley & Cullin 2020 ), rather than relying only on studies conducted among American and European populations living in evolutionarily novel circumstances (e.g., Blackwell et al. 2016 , McDade 2003 ).
In this review, I discuss how the hygiene hypothesis fits within this broader framework of life history theory (LHT) and ecoimmunology. I first discuss the core principles that link environmental exposure to immune plasticity and immune-related disease. I then discuss how biotic, abiotic, and multigenerational factors feed into these mechanisms. Finally, I discuss how these factors lead to disease primarily through two pathways: dysregulated inflammation and mistargeted immune responses. Figure 1 summarizes this overall picture and can serve as a guide through this review.

Section: PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS

Ecoimmunology falls within the broader framework of LHT, which is itself best thought of as a subset of evolutionary theory. LHT examines how organisms have evolved to allocate limited resources, such as energy, nutrients, and time, to competing demands such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance ( Charnov 1991 ; Stearns 1976 , 1992 ). LHT gets its name because allocation decisions are related to the timing of life history events such as the length of the juvenile period, the timing of reproduction, and the rate of senescence. LHT originally dealt primarily with how natural selection resulted in differences among species, but it has also been used extensively to examine the evolution of individual plasticity and corresponding phenotypic differences among members of the same species ( Blackwell et al. 2010 , 2016 ; Gurven et al. 2017 ; Kuzawa et al. 2020 ; McDade 2005b ; Urlacher et al. 2018 ; but for cautions, see Sear 2020 , Stearns & Rodrigues 2020 ).
Life history allocation problems are central to understanding plasticity in immune responses. Energy budgets are constrained, at least over long periods of time ( Pontzer 2018 , Thurber et al. 2019 ), and immune responses are costly. For example, fighting an infection raises basal metabolic rates ( Lochmiller & Deerenberg 2000 , Muehlenbein et al. 2010 ), and immune responses often necessitate reductions in other costly allocations, such as growth and reproduction ( Blackwell et al. 2010 , McDade 2003 , Sheldon & Verhulst 1996 , Urlacher et al. 2018 ).
Different types of immune function can also be seen as trading off with one another. The immune system has two major components, innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is immunity governed by genetically encoded signals, which respond to cues of infection or injury that have remained constant throughout our evolutionary history. In contrast, adaptive immunity learns to respond to newly encountered cues of infection and retains a memory of those cues encountered during one's lifetime. Innate and adaptive immunity work in concert; e.g., innate responses are required to initiate adaptive responses. However, organisms still differ in relative allocations to innate and adaptive responses; innate responses are generally seen as acting faster but causing more somatic collateral damage, whereas adaptive responses act slower and require more long-term investment but cause less collateral damage ( Martin et al. 2008 , McDade et al. 2016 ).
Naïve T cells can differentiate into a number of different classes, including Th1 (type 1 helper T cells), Th2 , Th17 , and regulatory T cells ( Tregs ). Th1 and Th17 cells are generally seen as proinflammatory, whereas Th2 cells promote antibody responses and Tregs facilitate immunological tolerance ( Eisenstein & Williams 2009 , Lee 2018 , Maizels & Yazdanbakhsh 2003 , Tesmer et al. 2008 ). Because these develop from common precursors and to some extent have antagonistic effects, they can also be seen as trading off with one another. However, any immune response will require some coordinated action from T cells of multiple classes, so trade-offs are best seen as shifts in the relative balance among different kinds of response rather than changes in kind.
At the ultimate level, these trade-offs probably emerge in part because of limitations in resource availability. However, these trade-offs also represent different strategies for dealing with infections, so resource constraints are likely not the entire picture. LHT generally deals with energetic trade-offs for simplicity, but trade-offs of other sorts, such as those between different strategies, can also be conceptualized within this framework.
Trade-offs are relevant for understanding the hygiene and old friends hypotheses because factors such as pathogen exposure affect these trade-offs, and in turn ecoimmunological allocations affect health and disease outcomes. I return to these topics with specific examples later in this review.
One particular trade-off that is likely to have implications for disease is between tolerance and resistance . In the ecological sense, resistance is the ability to fight off an infection, whereas tolerance is the ability to withstand an infection without suffering fitness costs ( Graham et al. 2011 , Kutzer & Armitage 2016 ). In theory, a host might be both tolerant of and resistant to an infection. However, in practice, these aspects seem to trade off ( Jackson et al. 2014 , Råberg et al. 2007 ) because tolerance, in the ecological sense, likely involves immunological tolerance, which is the moderation of an immune response to an antigen ( Medzhitov et al. 2012 ). Hosts are good at resisting when they mount a strong immune response against an infection. However, this strong immune response tends to cause immunopathology and is energetically costly. Hosts are best at tolerating when they limit their immune responses to those necessary to keep an infection from worsening, thereby minimizing both pathology caused by the parasite and immunopathology ( Figure 2 ).

At the mechanistic level, immunological tolerance develops in two primary ways. The first, called central tolerance, develops when T and B cells are produced. These cells are screened in the thymus or bone marrow, respectively, and any cells that react to self-antigens are deleted in order to avoid autoimmunity ( Nemazee 2017 , Parham 2015 ). The second mechanism, peripheral tolerance, involves the suppression of T and B cell responses in the periphery. One primary mechanism for peripheral tolerance is the development of Tregs, which, true to their name, regulate the responses of other cells to particular antigens ( Belkaid & Rouse 2005 , Zelenay et al. 2005 ). There are trade-offs between immunity and self-tolerance, such that the specificity and sensitivity of responses must be tuned to attack as many pathogens as possible, while limiting autoimmunity.
Immunological tolerance (or the lack thereof) is clearly implicated in autoimmune disorders ( Knochelmann et al. 2018 , Lee 2018 ) as well as the maintenance of commensal microbiomes ( Kehrmann et al. 2020 , Pandiyan et al. 2019 ). However, tolerance and resistance, in the ecological sense, are also likely to be central to the hygiene and old friends hypotheses because these can be thought of as strategies for dealing with infections, which are likely to be plastic and responsive to environmental and developmental influences. In general, tolerance is favored when infections are repeated or chronic, and in utero or early-life exposure may strongly influence the development of tolerance toward a particular organism (A.D. Blackwell, submitted manuscript). The development of tolerance toward, for example, a particular helminth species may be key to interacting with these as commensals rather than as parasites.
Trade-offs are just one way to think about plasticity in immune responses. Trade-offs are mediated by evolved reaction norms that, although they may misfire in the case of evolutionary mismatches, at least follow the logic of natural selection and were selected for because they produced adaptive outcomes in the past. However, apart from misfires, another type of dysfunction is also possible: the outcome of the development or education of the immune system. All kinds of development require input from the environment. Physical and cognitive systems develop abnormally without environmental stimuli ( Bergström et al. 1999 , Maurer et al. 2005 ). These systems evolved under conditions in which environmental input was ubiquitous, and thus there was never selection on normal development in the absence of environmental stimuli. The immune system is likely no different. Having evolved under conditions in which exposures to non-self-antigens were ubiquitous, the systems regulating immunity expect this input and develop abnormally when deprived. For example, mice raised to be germ-free show a number of immunological defects and modifications, both in the intestine and systemically ( Macpherson & Harris 2004 ), and also show increased phenotypic characteristics related to irritable bowel disease, allergic asthma, and other inflammatory disorders ( Olszak et al. 2012 , Rook 2012 ).
In addition to interactions with hosts, microbes, parasites, viruses, and other infections interact with one another, both directly and indirectly. These interactions are best thought of in terms of ecology, with the host as the ecosystem.
Helminth infections are associated with increased microbiome diversity ( Lee et al. 2014 ) and affect the balance of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut ( Giacomin et al. 2016 ). Helminth infections are also associated with reduced odds of infection with the pathogenic protozoa giardia ( Blackwell et al. 2013 ). The mechanisms for these effects are not fully known but are thought to involve effects on the immune system, including the induction of Tregs, as well as direct interactions, because these parasites occupy the same physical spaces in the gut ( Blackwell et al. 2013 ).
In this review, I have distinguished between host immune responses and ecological interactions between commensals and pathogens as principles for the hygiene hypothesis. However, in truth, the line between these is fuzzy at best. The host and, in particular, the host immune system represent the habitat for these organisms, and, like many organisms, commensals and pathogens modify their environments to further their own fitness interests. When it comes to the immune effects of infections, it is often difficult to distinguish between host response and parasite manipulation ( Maizels & McSorley 2016 ). Moreover, in many cases, particularly for organisms with long coevolutionary relationships with humans, immune modifications likely represent compromises between these extremes.
Ecoimmunology falls within the broader framework of LHT, which is itself best thought of as a subset of evolutionary theory. LHT examines how organisms have evolved to allocate limited resources, such as energy, nutrients, and time, to competing demands such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance ( Charnov 1991 ; Stearns 1976 , 1992 ). LHT gets its name because allocation decisions are related to the timing of life history events such as the length of the juvenile period, the timing of reproduction, and the rate of senescence.

When it comes to the immune effects of infections, it is often difficult to distinguish between host response and parasite manipulation ( Maizels & McSorley 2016 ). Moreover, in many cases, particularly for organisms with long coevolutionary relationships with humans, immune modifications likely represent compromises between these extremes.

Section: ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

The first section of this review focuses on general principles for understanding how immune function varies with environmental exposures. In this section, I discuss more specific examples of environmental exposures and how these are linked to changes in the factors above.
The core premise of the hygiene and old friends hypotheses is that exposure to microbes, parasites, and other infections early in life helps produce or maintain a healthy and well-adjusted immune system. Thus, both exposure and lack of exposure to biotic factors are key to each of these hypotheses.
A key early hypothesis about how infectious disease exposure might protect against allergy is the Th1/Th2 hypothesis. Allergic responses are mediated largely by Th2 responses characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), whereas viral infections require Th1 responses. The thinking was that exposure to infectious disease might shift immunity away from Th2 toward Th1 responses, reducing allergy. This hypothesis has generally fallen out of favor, owing in part to evidence that it is not Th2 responses, per se, that cause allergy, but rather mistargeted Th2 responses ( Rook 2009 ). If the full range of human variation is considered, elevated Th2 responses and, in particular, elevated IgE might better be perceived as the normative or ancestral state ( Figure 3 ). IgE, in particular, functions in defense against macroparasites, including endoparasites such as helminths and ectoparasites such as insects. These parasites may have been so ubiquitous in the past that we have evolved dependencies for them. Helminths release substances that shift host immune function further toward a Th2 response and also induce Tregs, which moderate host immune responses against the parasite ( Maizels & McSorley 2016 , Maizels & Yazdanbakhsh 2003 ). These manipulations facilitate parasite survival. Some Th2 responses may help the host resist further colonization by additional parasites, aiding the host but also allowing the original parasite to keep the host to itself. However, to the extent that host and parasite interests are misaligned, hosts evolve countermeasures against parasite manipulation. This process results in an arms race and an evolved dependency in the sense that when the parasite pressure on immunity is released, the host immune response is likely to overshoot because it is no longer being countered ( Lynch et al. 1993 ).

Connecting back to our principles above, these interactions involve trade-offs between branches of immunity as well as the development of tolerance in both the immunological and ecological senses. Evolved dependencies are likely to evolve as a form of tolerance because tolerance often involves shifts in allocations to compensate for the presence of the pathogen. For example, increases in Treg cells reduce resistance to a helminth infection but may also help limit immunopathology from failed attempts at clearance. Changes in IgE and natural killer cell counts may help restrain a helminth infection without killing it. These changes may facilitate parasite survival but also facilitate host tolerance.
Contrary to elements proposed in some early versions of the hygiene hypothesis, exposure to infectious crowd diseases is unlikely to improve health overall. Some evidence indicates that latent herpesvirus infections such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus can reduce the risk of allergy and atopy. However, these and other viral infections may increase susceptibility to other infections such as HIV and have been associated with increases in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders ( Parker et al. 2021 ), including systemic lupus erythematosus and atherosclerosis ( White et al. 2012 ). In the long term, infectious diseases, particularly those that are intracellular, such as viral infections, can cause negative health outcomes through increases in thymic output, turnover in naïve T cells, and eventual accumulation of senescent T cells, which are cells that lose responsiveness after undergoing too many cycles of replication ( Nikolich-Žugich 2008 , Permar et al. 2003 , Sansoni et al. 2008 ). Depletions such as these may have little effect early in life but cumulatively accelerate immunosenescence and susceptibility to infection late in life ( Effros 2005 , Pawelec & Derhovanessian 2011 , Targonski et al. 2007 ).
This point is important because it speaks to many misconceptions and misapplications of the hygiene hypothesis. Anti-vaccination movements are sometimes predicated on the idea that natural exposure to infectious diseases such as measles can have long-term benefits. But in general, infectious diseases are likely to cause more cumulative damage than they are to provide benefits and are not protective against inflammatory and other disorders ( Rook et al. 2017 ).
Helminth infections also have a downside. Mild parasite loads are often asymptomatic, but high parasite loads are associated with anemia, stunted growth, cognitive impairments, and nutritional deficiencies ( Anderson et al. 2020 , Blackwell 2016 , Briggs et al. 2016 , Hotez et al. 2008 ). Over the long term, chronic helminth infections may be associated with depletion of CD4+ helper T cells and expansion of natural killer cells ( Blackwell et al. 2016 , Borkow et al. 2000 , Kalinkovich et al. 1998 , Tsegaye et al. 2003 ). Thus the effects of biotic factors almost always involve trade-offs between beneficial and detrimental effects.
In addition to biotic factors, a number of abiotic factors also impact immune regulation. Though not strictly part of the hygiene or old friends hypotheses, these factors are also evolutionarily novel and tend to covary with hygiene and sanitation. Moreover, interactions between these factors and exposures are likely important for many health outcomes.
Key among these are the impacts of nutrition and obesity. Nutrition likely has direct effects, for example the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties of some foods ( Alcock et al. 2012 , Johnson et al. 2021 , Shivappa et al. 2014 ), but also has indirect effects through the accumulation of adipose tissue, which produces inflammatory cytokines ( Yudkin et al. 1999 ). This accumulation is itself influenced by early-life malnutrition and infection and may be an adaptive response that evolved to create a reservoir of visceral fat to be mobilized for fighting infections ( Urlacher et al. 2016 , Wells & Cortina-Borja 2013 , West-Eberhard 2019 ). Obesity is therefore influenced by biotic factors such as exposure to parasites and microbiome regulation ( Tilg & Kaser 2011 ) and also interacts with other biotic factors to influence disease outcomes. For example, the severity of COVID-19 may be determined by an interaction among obesity, past infection exposure, and current coinfection with helminths and commensals (see the sidebar titled COVID-19 and the Hygiene and Old Friends Hypotheses; Figure 4 ).

COVID-19 AND THE HYGIENE AND OLD FRIENDS HYPOTHESES
As SARS-CoV-2 began circulating around the globe in 2019, researchers quickly hypothesized about how coinfections and past immunological experience might influence COVID-19. Serious COVID-19 disease is characterized by a cytokine storm, a dysregulated release of proinflammatory cytokines that results in excessive migration of inflammatory cells to lung tissue, causing lung injury and respiratory distress ( Ye et al. 2020 ). Given the role of the cytokine storm, researchers proposed that helminths might protect against complications from COVID-19, given their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties ( Cepon-Robins & Gildner 2020 , Hays et al. 2020 , Parker et al. 2021 , Schneider-Crease et al. 2021 , Wolday et al. 2021b ). A study from Ethiopia supports this prediction ( Wolday et al. 2021a ). Patterns in global COVID-19 deaths provide further evidence, with much lower levels of mortality in central Africa and India than were expected ( Chatterjee et al. 2021 , Mbow et al. 2020 ). Helminths are probably not the entire picture, particularly given high death rates in parts of South America. Additional studies have suggested that malaria infection may shorten COVID-19 recovery ( Mahajan et al. 2021 , Panda et al. 2020 ). Obesity is also a risk factor for severe COVID-19, and rates of obesity are much lower in central Africa, India, and Southeast Asia than they are in the Americas and Northern Eurasia ( Bentham et al. 2017 ). Adipose tissue promotes inflammation, but SARS-CoV-2 may further accentuate inflammation by directly infecting adipose tissue ( Martínez-Colón et al. 2021 ). Taken together, these factors may help explain why COVID-19 has had very different mortality rates across the world.
Changes in reproductive life histories are similarly likely to interact with biotic exposures to influence disease phenotypes. Patterns of low fertility in many industrialized nations result in novel hormone levels in women and novel pregnancy-related patterns of immune regulation, which may interact with hygiene to exacerbate autoimmune related disorders ( Natri et al. 2019 ). Estrogen induces Treg cells, which are critical for pregnancy ( La Rocca et al. 2014 , Tai et al. 2008 ) but also critical for tolerance reactions to self-antigens, as well as commensals. Industrialized populations are exposed to an array of hormone-mimicking chemicals that have been hypothesized to affect immune regulation along with low fertility ( Ahmed 2000 , Chalubinski & Kowalski 2006 , Thompson et al. 2015 ).
The timing of exposure to biotic factors is likely to be important for later development of disease. There may be critical periods in immune function development that influence not only the later development of disease, but the effect of later-life exposures to microbes and parasites. Studies of immigrants suggest childhood exposures, particularly before puberty, have lifelong effects. Asian and Caribbean immigrants to England who immigrated before the age of 15 were at higher risk of multiple sclerosis ( Dean & Elian 1997 ), whereas those who immigrated before age five were at higher risk of asthma ( Kuehni et al. 2007 ). Immigrants from Bangladesh to the United Kingdom who immigrated after age eight had lower C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, than did those who immigrated earlier or among second-generation immigrants ( Begum et al. 2021 ). Similar patterns are seen for hormonal profiles, which are likely also influenced by early-life pathogen exposure ( Magid et al. 2018 , Núñez-de la Mora et al. 2007 ).
A life-course analysis of IgE levels in three populations with different parasite exposures indicates that immune profiles diverge very early, as elevated IgE was seen in toddlers in high-parasite areas and children reached adult levels of high IgE by age seven ( Blackwell et al. 2011 ). Studies of immigrants from high- to low-pathogen environments show that IgE levels fall somewhat but remain elevated relative to those native to the low-pathogen area for at least a decade ( Iancovici Kidon et al. 2005 ). In germ-free mice, some of the immunological abnormalities are reversed by colonization with intestinal bacteria, whereas other characteristics are exacerbated or unaltered ( Macpherson & Harris 2004 , Rook 2012 ).
In addition to critical periods, transgenerational effects on immune development are also documented (A.D. Blackwell, submitted manuscript). During pregnancy and in breastmilk, mothers transmit immunological information to infants, including antibodies ( Borghesi et al. 2014 , Pentsuk & van der Laan 2009 ), antigen bound to antibodies ( May et al. 2009 ), and maternal immune cells ( Harrington et al. 2017 , Kinder et al. 2015 , Maloney et al. 1999 ). These induce long-term alterations in immune responses, including the induction of tolerance toward pathogens and commensals ( Harrington et al. 2017 , Maizels & Lawrence 1991 , Malhotra et al. 2006 ).
The presence of critical periods and transgenerational effects means that the effects of parasite or microbe exposure will not be the same for everyone. For example, when individuals who were never exposed to parasites in childhood are infected with helminths, they may mount a strong resistant response, possibly resulting in an immunological outcome opposite of that which was desired. This finding may help explain why clinical trials for helminth therapy have proven equivocal, despite robust associations with helminth infections in population studies ( Helmby 2015 ). Similar effects may also complicate microbiome restoration effects, for example following C-section delivery ( Wilson et al. 2021 ).
The core premise of the hygiene and old friends hypotheses is that exposure to microbes, parasites, and other infections early in life helps produce or maintain a healthy and well-adjusted immune system. Thus, both exposure and lack of exposure to biotic factors are key to each of these hypotheses.
A key early hypothesis about how infectious disease exposure might protect against allergy is the Th1/Th2 hypothesis. Allergic responses are mediated largely by Th2 responses characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), whereas viral infections require Th1 responses. The thinking was that exposure to infectious disease might shift immunity away from Th2 toward Th1 responses, reducing allergy. This hypothesis has generally fallen out of favor, owing in part to evidence that it is not Th2 responses, per se, that cause allergy, but rather mistargeted Th2 responses ( Rook 2009 ). If the full range of human variation is considered, elevated Th2 responses and, in particular, elevated IgE might better be perceived as the normative or ancestral state ( Figure 3 ). IgE, in particular, functions in defense against macroparasites, including endoparasites such as helminths and ectoparasites such as insects. These parasites may have been so ubiquitous in the past that we have evolved dependencies for them. Helminths release substances that shift host immune function further toward a Th2 response and also induce Tregs, which moderate host immune responses against the parasite ( Maizels & McSorley 2016 , Maizels & Yazdanbakhsh 2003 ). These manipulations facilitate parasite survival. Some Th2 responses may help the host resist further colonization by additional parasites, aiding the host but also allowing the original parasite to keep the host to itself. However, to the extent that host and parasite interests are misaligned, hosts evolve countermeasures against parasite manipulation. This process results in an arms race and an evolved dependency in the sense that when the parasite pressure on immunity is released, the host immune response is likely to overshoot because it is no longer being countered ( Lynch et al. 1993 ).

Connecting back to our principles above, these interactions involve trade-offs between branches of immunity as well as the development of tolerance in both the immunological and ecological senses. Evolved dependencies are likely to evolve as a form of tolerance because tolerance often involves shifts in allocations to compensate for the presence of the pathogen. For example, increases in Treg cells reduce resistance to a helminth infection but may also help limit immunopathology from failed attempts at clearance. Changes in IgE and natural killer cell counts may help restrain a helminth infection without killing it. These changes may facilitate parasite survival but also facilitate host tolerance.
Contrary to elements proposed in some early versions of the hygiene hypothesis, exposure to infectious crowd diseases is unlikely to improve health overall. Some evidence indicates that latent herpesvirus infections such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus can reduce the risk of allergy and atopy. However, these and other viral infections may increase susceptibility to other infections such as HIV and have been associated with increases in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders ( Parker et al. 2021 ), including systemic lupus erythematosus and atherosclerosis ( White et al. 2012 ). In the long term, infectious diseases, particularly those that are intracellular, such as viral infections, can cause negative health outcomes through increases in thymic output, turnover in naïve T cells, and eventual accumulation of senescent T cells, which are cells that lose responsiveness after undergoing too many cycles of replication ( Nikolich-Žugich 2008 , Permar et al. 2003 , Sansoni et al. 2008 ). Depletions such as these may have little effect early in life but cumulatively accelerate immunosenescence and susceptibility to infection late in life ( Effros 2005 , Pawelec & Derhovanessian 2011 , Targonski et al. 2007 ).
This point is important because it speaks to many misconceptions and misapplications of the hygiene hypothesis. Anti-vaccination movements are sometimes predicated on the idea that natural exposure to infectious diseases such as measles can have long-term benefits. But in general, infectious diseases are likely to cause more cumulative damage than they are to provide benefits and are not protective against inflammatory and other disorders ( Rook et al. 2017 ).
Helminth infections also have a downside. Mild parasite loads are often asymptomatic, but high parasite loads are associated with anemia, stunted growth, cognitive impairments, and nutritional deficiencies ( Anderson et al. 2020 , Blackwell 2016 , Briggs et al. 2016 , Hotez et al. 2008 ). Over the long term, chronic helminth infections may be associated with depletion of CD4+ helper T cells and expansion of natural killer cells ( Blackwell et al. 2016 , Borkow et al. 2000 , Kalinkovich et al. 1998 , Tsegaye et al. 2003 ). Thus the effects of biotic factors almost always involve trade-offs between beneficial and detrimental effects.
In addition to biotic factors, a number of abiotic factors also impact immune regulation. Though not strictly part of the hygiene or old friends hypotheses, these factors are also evolutionarily novel and tend to covary with hygiene and sanitation. Moreover, interactions between these factors and exposures are likely important for many health outcomes.
Key among these are the impacts of nutrition and obesity. Nutrition likely has direct effects, for example the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties of some foods ( Alcock et al. 2012 , Johnson et al. 2021 , Shivappa et al. 2014 ), but also has indirect effects through the accumulation of adipose tissue, which produces inflammatory cytokines ( Yudkin et al. 1999 ). This accumulation is itself influenced by early-life malnutrition and infection and may be an adaptive response that evolved to create a reservoir of visceral fat to be mobilized for fighting infections ( Urlacher et al. 2016 , Wells & Cortina-Borja 2013 , West-Eberhard 2019 ). Obesity is therefore influenced by biotic factors such as exposure to parasites and microbiome regulation ( Tilg & Kaser 2011 ) and also interacts with other biotic factors to influence disease outcomes. For example, the severity of COVID-19 may be determined by an interaction among obesity, past infection exposure, and current coinfection with helminths and commensals (see the sidebar titled COVID-19 and the Hygiene and Old Friends Hypotheses; Figure 4 ).

COVID-19 AND THE HYGIENE AND OLD FRIENDS HYPOTHESES
As SARS-CoV-2 began circulating around the globe in 2019, researchers quickly hypothesized about how coinfections and past immunological experience might influence COVID-19. Serious COVID-19 disease is characterized by a cytokine storm, a dysregulated release of proinflammatory cytokines that results in excessive migration of inflammatory cells to lung tissue, causing lung injury and respiratory distress ( Ye et al. 2020 ). Given the role of the cytokine storm, researchers proposed that helminths might protect against complications from COVID-19, given their anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties ( Cepon-Robins & Gildner 2020 , Hays et al. 2020 , Parker et al. 2021 , Schneider-Crease et al. 2021 , Wolday et al. 2021b ). A study from Ethiopia supports this prediction ( Wolday et al. 2021a ). Patterns in global COVID-19 deaths provide further evidence, with much lower levels of mortality in central Africa and India than were expected ( Chatterjee et al. 2021 , Mbow et al. 2020 ). Helminths are probably not the entire picture, particularly given high death rates in parts of South America.

Section: CONDITIONS LINKED TO HYGIENE

Having considered the environmental influences and mechanisms of immune regulation, we can now review some of the conditions that have been linked to hygiene and other trappings of modernity and suggest how these conditions are connected, despite having very disparate etiologies and symptomatologies. The conditions fall into two overlapping categories: inflammatory conditions and conditions linked to mistargeted immunity.
Allergy and asthma are the quintessential examples of mistargeted immunity, as these are immune responses against benign substances. Allergy and asthma are linked to hygiene primarily through effects on Th2 responses, which in the presence of infections are likely preoccupied by actual parasites, moderated via Treg activity, or both ( Maizels 2005 , Yazdanbakhsh et al. 2002 ). Food allergies may follow a similar pathway, though in some cases food allergens are similar or identical to antigens in macroparasites (for example, tropomyosin, the dominant allergic antigen in shellfish, is conserved across many invertebrates) ( Lopata et al. 2016 , Tyagi et al. 2015 ). Thus, the fact that certain immune responses react to these stimuli in the absence of their intended target makes sense. Autoimmune reactions also involve immune reactions against inappropriate antigens. These are usually kept in check through the mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance, but peripheral tolerance may require maintenance of a state of partial desensitization through chronic stimulation of innate immune signaling pathways ( Bach 2018 ). Peripheral tolerance is also important in pregnancy ( Burt 2013 , Jiang et al. 2014 , Saito et al. 2007 ) because a mother must tolerate an antigenically distinct fetus. Disruptions of fetal tolerance are implicated in difficulty conceiving, fetal loss, and preeclampsia ( La Rocca et al. 2014 , Redman et al. 1999 ), which may explain why infection with certain helminth species has been associated with increased odds of conception ( Blackwell 2016 , Blackwell et al. 2015 ).
A more general class of syndromes influenced by hygiene and sanitation are the inflammatory disorders, which also involve mistargeted immunity but in a more general, systemic sense in which nonspecific responses are elevated. These include chronic diseases of modernity such as cardiovascular disease ( Gurven et al. 2016 ), atherosclerosis ( Wolfs et al. 2014 ), inflammatory bowel disease ( Panelli et al. 2020 ), metabolic syndrome ( Wiria et al. 2014 , 2015 ), type 2 diabetes ( de Ruiter et al. 2017 , Gurven et al. 2016 ), and depression ( Breslau et al. 2009 ). These conditions are united by a systemic elevation of inflammatory signaling molecules such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) as well as the activation of macrophages and other lymphocytes. In addition to being affected by biotic factors, many of these diseases are affected by obesity and other contributors to a chronic inflammatory state. In some cases, immune responses may be activated to attack antigens, which are neither self nor pathogen; for example, in atherosclerosis, fatty plaques form in the arteries, which are attacked by macrophages, causing arterial damage and scarring as a by-product ( Gurven et al. 2016 ). The development of this disease requires both the fatty plaques and the elevated inflammatory activation as well as a lack of proper targets (i.e., pathogens) for activated macrophages to attack; inflammation alone is not sufficient ( Gurven et al. 2009 ). Alzheimer's disease similarly appears to involve an interaction between the formation of β-amyloid plaques in the brain (the cause of which is poorly understood) and the immune response to these plaques ( Angelucci et al. 2019 , Fox et al. 2013 ).

Section: CONCLUDING REMARKS

The terms hygiene hypothesis and old friends hypothesis do not fully capture the range of interactions among microbe/parasite exposure, immune functioning, and disease. In this review, I have shown a small piece of this complexity and applied the general principles of life history trade-offs, tolerance/resistance trade-offs, and dysfunction to understand the different kinds of effects that exposures might have on immune function. I have highlighted some of the commonalities among conditions tied to these hypotheses and discussed examples of the kinds of biotic and abiotic factors that are likely to influence immune regulation. So as not to lose the forest for the trees, I have avoided many of the finer details of each condition mentioned. These details are covered in many of the references cited. Future work will likely be inspired by the general principles but will also require careful investigation of the nuanced mechanisms. Analogously, the phrases hygiene hypothesis and old friends hypothesis can be criticized for oversimplifying; however, they remain useful because they are easy to understand and easy to use as mental tools for generating new inferences.
