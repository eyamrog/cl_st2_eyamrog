Title: E-cigarette use among adults in China: findings from repeated cross-sectional surveys in 2015–16 and 2018–19


Abstract: Summary


Abstract_Section: Background

The use of e-cigarettes among adults is increasing globally. Since 2018, policies in China have restricted e-cigarette use; however, little information is available on the national trend in e-cigarette use before regulations were implemented. Therefore, we sought to estimate the trend in e-cigarette use in China before policy implementation and explored associated factors.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We assessed two nationally representative cross-sectional datasets from the China Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance (CCDNS) surveys initiated in 2015 (June, 2015, to May, 2016) and 2018 (August, 2018, to June, 2019). The surveys were done at 298 national disease surveillance points in 31 provinces in mainland China, and used a multistage, stratified, cluster-randomised sampling design, recruiting community-based Chinese adults aged 18 years and older. Within the standard CCDNS survey, face-to-face questionnaire interviews were used to collect self-report data on e-cigarette use in the preceding 30 days. E-cigarette users were those who self-reported e-cigarette use on 1 day or more in the past 30 days. Prevalence estimates of past 30-day e-cigarette use were weighted to represent the Chinese adult population accounting for the complex sampling design. Populations for the years 2015–16 and 2018–19 were standardised with the 2010 population census to gain comparable estimates. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, urban or rural residence, household income, occupation, and education level were applied to identify factors associated with the likelihood of e-cigarette use among the total population, ever smokers (current and former), and never smokers across both surveys.

Abstract_Section: Findings

Our study included 189 306 Chinese adults from the 2015 survey (100 405 [53·0%] women; mean age 43·6 years [SD 14·6]) and 184 475 Chinese adults from the 2018 survey (102 373 [55·5%] women; mean age 43·4 years [13·9]). The weighted prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use among Chinese adults increased from 1·3% (95% CI 1·1–1·5%) in 2015–16 to 1·6% (95% CI 1·4–1·8%) in 2018–19 (an increase of 0·3% [95% CI 0·1–0·6]; Rao-Scott χ 2 p=0·0086). Based on weighted proportion data, e-cigarette users were predominantly men (97·4% [95% CI 96·7–98·1] in 2015–16 and 97·0% [95·4–98·6] in 2018–19) and current conventional smokers (93·0% [90·7–95·2] in 2015–16 and 96·2% [95·1–97·3] in 2018–19). Across both surveys, the odds of e-cigarette use were significantly associated with obesity (odds ratio 1·6 [95% CI 1·3–2·1]; p=0·0007), awareness of smoking hazards (1·2 [1·0–1·4]; p=0·022), and smoking status (in current smokers, 135·2 [87·7–208·6]; and in former smokers, 33·5 [21·3–52·7]; p<0·0001). Among current smokers, the odds were increased with daily cigarette consumption (2·1 [1·5–2·8]; p<0·0001), smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day (1·8 [1·5–2·3]; p<0·0001), and an attempt to quit smoking (within the past 12 months, 1·9 [1·5–2·4]; and before the past 12 months, 1·5 [1·3–1·9]; p<0·0001). In never smokers, the odds were increased in those aware of the hazards of smoking (2·4 [1·2–4·7]; p=0·011).

Abstract_Section: Interpretation

E-cigarette use in China remains low but has increased substantially between 2015 and 2019. Our study identified increased e-cigarette use among subpopulations, and use patterns, that warrant further attention from public health policy makers in China.

Section: Introduction

E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that electronically heat a solution to create an inhalable aerosol, which can contain nicotine. E-cigarettes are promoted as a smoking cessation device, as a potentially less harmful way to self-administer nicotine than conventional cigarettes. Evidence from high-income countries suggests that e-cigarettes are increasing rapidly in popularity, particularly in young populations. However, with reports of e-cigarette-associated lung injury in 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that youths, young adults, and women who are pregnant should not use e-cigarettes or vaping products that contain nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol.

Although China produced about 80% of the world's e-cigarettes in 2015, the prevalence of e-cigarette use among youth and adults was low among the Chinese population. The China data of the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in 2015 showed that 40·5% of the population aged 15 years and older had heard of e-cigarettes, and 3·1% had tried e-cigarettes at least once in their lifetime. Furthermore, the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project in China revealed that the percentage of smokers who had heard of e-cigarettes increased from 29% (wave 3 survey; 2009) to 60% (wave 5 survey; 2014) and the percentage of smokers who had tried e-cigarettes at least once increased from 2% (wave 3 survey; 2009) to 11% (wave 5 survey; 2014). However, the sample sizes of previous studies has limited the power to generalise results across urban and rural areas.
Since 2018, China implemented a strict national regulation policy to protect youth from e-cigarette use, and banned online selling of e-cigarettes on Nov 1, 2019. Cities in mainland China—for instance, Shenzhen and Chengdu—have also revised tobacco control regulations to include e-cigarettes. However, knowledge remains limited regarding the characteristics of e-cigarette users and trend in e-cigarette use in China before the regulations were implemented.
In the present study, to provide important baseline data, we sought to establish the trend in e-cigarette use in China before policy implementation, and explore associated factors, using cross-sectional data from the 2015 and 2018 China Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance (CCDNS) surveys.

Section: Methods

We used two cross-sectional datasets of the CCDNS surveys initiated in 2015 (data collection from June, 2015, to May, 2016) and 2018 (August, 2018, to June, 2019). The CCDNS study was designed to assess the national profile of chronic diseases, related risk factors, and nutritional status among residents in 31 provinces of mainland China, via 298 national disease surveillance points. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC; Beijing, China) has been organising consecutive surveys every 3–5 years since 2004. The CCDNS study uses a multistage stratified cluster-randomised sampling design ( appendix 2 p 2 ) and eligible participants are community-based Chinese residents aged 18 years and older who have been living in their current residence for at least 6 months in the 12 months before the survey. Exclusion criteria are: living for less than 6 months with the selected family in the preceding 12 months, currently not living at home, pregnancy, patients with stroke or other severe diseases that limit mobility, current hospitalisation, and having cognitive, language, or mental disorders that prevent participation. The CCDNS study was approved by the institutional review board of China CDC (approval number 201519-A) and the ethical review committee of the National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC (approval number 201819). All participants of the CCDNS study consented in writing.
China CDC designed the standardised CCDNS study protocol, provided centralised training to provincial and local CDC staff, and developed an encrypted information collection and management platform that integrated sampling, questionnaire administration, identity verification, quality control, sample transportation, laboratory results upload, and progress monitoring. Trained local CDC staff reported sampling information, did face-to-face questionnaire interviews and physical measurements, collected blood and urine samples, and did on-site haemoglobin tests and site-centralised blood glucose tests. They administered questionnaires using portable application devices that recorded the interview process for data quality control, uploaded data to the encrypted platform, and recorded the transportation status of blood and urine samples from the site to a central laboratory via a WeChat-based mini-application. Provincial CDC staff provided secondary training to the local CDC staff, approved the sampling process, and supervised the data quality process by site visits, physical measurement calibration, and examining the interview recordings. The stringent quality control measures have been described previously.
CCDNS 2015 was the first of the surveillance surveys to introduce e-cigarette-related questions in the face-to-face questionnaire on smoking behaviour ( appendix 2 pp 3–4 ). CCDNS 2015 and 2018 defined past 30-day e-cigarette users as those who self-reported e-cigarette use on 1 day or more in the past 30 days. Frequent e-cigarette use was defined as use on 20 days or more in the past 30 days. Questionnaire design for conventional cigarette smoking status referred to the GATS, and therefore categorised participants as ever smokers (current and former smokers) and never smokers. Current smokers were classified into daily smokers and occasional smokers ( appendix 2 pp 3–4 ). Awareness of smoking hazards was defined as those who answer yes to the question, “To your knowledge, can smoking cause the following diseases? Stroke, heart attack, lung cancer”. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was assessed among current smokers. We defined obesity as a body-mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater using WHO criteria. Urban residency was defined as living in urban subdistricts and rural residency as living in rural townships. Education status was defined as primary or less, secondary level, and tertiary level. Occupation was defined as office, shop, or non-manual work; agricultural work; factory, construction, or manual work; retired; and unemployed. Annual household income was defined by quartiles of household income in 2015, with cutoff points of ¥15 000, ¥30 000, and ¥60 000. E-cigarette awareness was defined as those who answer yes to the question, “Have you ever heard about the electronic cigarette?” We compared the prevalence of e-cigarette use by education and annual household income levels between urban and rural residents in 2015–16 and 2018–19. We also compared age-specific e-cigarette use and awareness between overall and current smokers in 2015–16 and 2018–19.
Weighted proportions of the study sample, prevalence of e-cigarette use, and prevalence of e-cigarette awareness were calculated accounting for the complex sampling weight, stratification, and clusters. Populations for the years 2015–16 and 2018–19 were standardised with the 2010 population census of the National Bureau of Statistics of China to gain comparable estimates. The weighted prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use and daily e-cigarette use was estimated in the total population and in subgroups classified by age, sex, urban or rural residency, education level, occupation, annual household income, smoking status, awareness of smoking hazards, and obesity, for the years 2015–16 and 2018–19. Weighted proportions of e-cigarette users were assessed by sex, daily and frequent e-cigarette use, conventional cigarette use, and former and never smoker status. The Taylor series linearisation method was used to estimate variance. The Rao-Scott χ 2 test was used to compare prevalence rates between the years. Unweighted frequencies of e-cigarette use are also reported to represent the study sample. Multiariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of the odds of past 30-day e-cigarette use with conventional cigarette smoking status, awareness of smoking hazards, obesity, cigarette use pattern (frequency and quantity), and attempts to quit smoking. Four models were built to assess factors applicable among the total population, ever smokers (current and former), and never smokers, combining the populations of both surveys. All models were adjusted for age, sex, urban or rural residence, household income, occupation, and education level.
Sensitivity analyses of weighted prevalence rates were done to compare the prevalence distribution of e-cigarette use with regard to analysed factors between participants with and without a BMI measurement ( appendix 2 pp 8–9 ).
The sampling scheme and exclusion of individuals are shown in appendix 2 (p 2) . Participants who did not answer questions related to smoking or e-cigarette use were excluded and we did not impute missing data. All p values were two-tailed and 0·05 was the threshold for statistical significance. All analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4) and data was visualised in R software (version 4.0.0).

Section: Results

Our study included 189 306 participants of the CCDNS 2015 survey, and 184 475 participants of the CCDNS 2018 survey; the characteristics of the study population are shown in table 1 (overall response rate: 95·8% in 2015–16 and 94·8% in 2018–19; calculation shown in appendix 2 [p 5] ). Across both surveys, 83 participants (<0·1%) did not answer questions related to e-cigarette use or smoking status and were excluded from the eligible study population. The mean age of participants in 2015–16 was 43·6 years (SD 14·6), and 100 405 (53·0%) were women; mean age in 2018–19 was 43·4 years (13·9), and 102 373 (55·5%) participants were women.
In 2015–16, the estimated weighted prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use was 1·3% (95% CI 1·1–1·5) among the Chinese adult population ( table 1 ). Weighted prevalence was higher in men (2·5% [2·2–2·8]) than in women (0·1% [0·0–0·1]). Additionally, prevalence of e-cigarette use was highest in people aged 18–29 years, in urban residents, in those with secondary or tertiary education status, in those with highest annual income (>¥60 000), in factory, construction, and manual workers, and in the population with obesity. Awareness of smoking hazards was also associated with a slightly higher prevalence of e-cigarette use than no awareness. In terms of smoking status, the highest prevalence of e-cigarette use was estimated among ever smokers (3·8% [3·4–4·3]), current smokers (4·4% [3·8–5·0]), and daily smokers (4·6% [3·9–5·2]).
E-cigarette use in 2018–19 followed a similar pattern. However, use among the Chinese adult population increased to 1·6% (95% CI 1·4–1·8%), representing an increase in prevalence of 0·3% (95% CI 0·1–0·6; p=0·0086) from 2015–16 to 2018–19. Significant increases in e-cigarette use between 2015–16 and 2018–19 were also observed in people aged 18–29 years and 40–49 years, in men, in urban residents, in those with a primary or lower education level, in factory, construction, and manual workers, agricultural workers, and unemployed people, and in those with the lowest annual income or those unwilling to disclose income. E-cigarette use significantly increased among ever smokers, current smokers, and daily smokers from 2015–16 to 2018–19 ( table 1 ), with results replicated for daily e-cigarette use ( appendix 2 pp 6–7 ). Those aware of smoking hazards, and the populations with and without obesity also showed significant increases in e-cigarette use ( table 1 ). Figure 1 shows the age-specific prevalence of use and awareness of e-cigarettes by year and sex among the total population and current smokers. Among the total population, awareness of e-cigarettes increased from 2015–16 to 2018–19 in men and women across all age groups.
Figure 2 shows urban and rural disparities in the prevalence of e-cigarette use by education and annual household income levels in China in 2015–16 and 2018–19. In urban areas, e-cigarette use among people with a secondary or tertiary education was more prevalent than in those with a primary education or less; however, in rural areas, prevalence was similar between people with a tertiary education and those with a primary education or less, and highest in people with a secondary education ( figure 2A ). In 2015–16, e-cigarette use increased with annual household income in both urban and rural areas ( figure 2B ). However, in 2018–19, those with the lowest household income (≤¥15 000) showed high use of e-cigarettes versus other income groups in urban and rural areas ( figure 2B , table 1 ).
In 2018–19, 97·0% (95% CI 95·4–98·6) of e-cigarette users were men ( table 2 ). 96·2% (95·1–97·3) of the e-cigarette users were current conventional smokers, and 89·9% (87·4–92·4) used conventional cigarettes daily. An estimated 2·3% (1·6–3·0) of e-cigarette users were former smokers, while 1·5% (0·7–2·4) had never smoked. In 2015–16, e-cigarette users were predominantly men (97·4% [95% CI 96·7–98·1]) and current conventional smokers (93·0% [90·7–95·2]). Rates of conventional smoking (23·8% [19·2–28·3], daily smoking (86·8% [83·8–89·8]), former smoker status (4·8% [2·7–6·8]), and never smoker status (2·3% [1·5–3·1]) in e-cigarette users were similar to rates in 2018–19. The proportion of individuals using e-cigarettes on a daily basis increased from 23·8% (19·2–28·3) in 2015–16 to 26·7% (21·6–31·8) in 2018–19, which aligned with the increase in use among current smokers ( appendix 2 p 7 ).
In our multivariable regression analysis of the total population of both surveys, e-cigarette use was significantly associated with obesity (odds ratio 1·6 [95% CI 1·3–2·1]; p=0·0007), awareness of smoking hazards (1·2 [1·0–1·4); p=0·022), and smoking status (in current smokers, 135·2 [87·7–208·6]; and in former smokers, 33·5 [21·3–52·7]; p<0·0001) after adjusting for age, sex, urban or rural residency, household income, occupation, and education level ( table 3 ). Among current smokers, e-cigarette use was significantly associated with obesity (1·6 [1·2–2·0]; p=0·0005), daily use of cigarettes (2·1 [1·5–2·8]; p<0·0001), smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day (1·8 [1·5–2·3]; p<0·0001), and an attempt to quit smoking (within the past 12 months, 1·9 [1·5–2·4]; and before the past 12 months, 1·5 [1·3–1·9]; p<0·0001). Among never smokers, the odds of e-cigarette use were increased in those aware of the hazards of smoking (2·4 [1·2–4·7]; p=0·011) and those with obesity (2·4 [1·3–4·5]; p=0·0058; table 3 ).
Patterns of e-cigarette use were generally similar between participants with and without BMI data across 2015–16 and 2018–19, with some variation according to region, occupation, household income, education level, and smoking status (pp 8–9). Proportions of e-cigarette users from 2015 to 2019 among former smokers and never smokers are shown in appendix 2 (pp 10–11) . In e-cigarette users who were former smokers, the majority had a primary or lower level of education in 2018–19; whereas, most former smokers who used e-cigarettes had a secondary or tertiary level of education in 2015–16. The proportion of e-cigarette use among former smokers who were aware of the hazards of conventional smoking decreased from 2015–16 to 2018–19 ( appendix 2 p 10 ). In 2015–16 and 2018–19, most e-cigarette users who had never smoked were men, aged 18–44 years, and used e-cigarettes occasionally. The proportion of never smokers who were aware of the hazards of conventional smoking markedly increased from 2015–16 to 2018–19 ( appendix 2 p 11 ).

Section: Discussion

To our knowledge, this large-scale study is the first to report on the prevalence of e-cigarette use and trend in use during recent years on a national level in China. Our study also provides valuable baseline data for evaluations of the effect of the regulations on e-cigarettes in China. On the basis of two, nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys of the Chinese population, we estimated the prevalence of e-cigarette use to have increased from 1·3% to 1·6% during 2015–19. Applying our weighted prevalence values to the 2010 Chinese population gives an estimated 16·9 million Chinese adults who were using e-cigarettes in 2018–19, of whom 16·2 million were current smokers and more than a quarter of a million were never smokers.
Our study showed that the patterns of e-cigarette use in China differed to those in other countries. Firstly, although prevalence increased, e-cigarette use in 2018–19 was still lower than the reported prevalence in some developed countries, such as France (3·7% in 2017), the UK (4·7% in 2017), and the USA (3·2% in 2016). However, given the population size of China, we estimate 3·35 million individuals to have started using e-cigarettes in the adult population, among whom 3·20 million were men and 0·15 million were women. Therefore, the prevalence of e-cigarette use in China should be monitored in the future. Secondly, in contrast to results in Sweden and the USA, Chinese populations with a high level of education or within the highest income bracket were the most likely to use e-cigarettes. The positive education and income gradients observed in our study imply that public knowledge remains low regarding the health hazards of nicotine or substances that might be contained in e-cigarettes. These patterns can also be explained by targeting of an early e-cigarette product at high-income individuals in China and exporting overseas to establish the brand as a luxury product. However, our study also found that from 2015 to 2019, individuals with the lowest household income increased their use of e-cigarettes. This increase among people with low socioeconomic status could exacerbate health disparities.
Some patterns of e-cigarette use in China were similar to those in other countries. Firstly, the prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use was higher among young adults aged 18–29 years than other age groups, and the prevalence of use among young adults increased, from 2·0% in 2015–16 to 2·7% in 2018–19. Similar to perceptions in other countries, e-cigarettes have gained popularity among adolescents and young adults in China. Secondly, our study showed high levels of dual-use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes among e-cigarette users in China. Therefore, the interaction or confounding effect of former or current cigarette use should be considered in future observational studies exploring the health effects of e-cigarettes. Thirdly, e-cigarette use was rare among individuals who had never smoked conventional cigarettes. Of 373 781 participants sampled across the country, only 83 e-cigarette users had never smoked. However, our study showed that never smokers who were aware of the hazards of smoking or who were obese were more likely to use e-cigarettes. Fourthly, obesity increased the odds of e-cigarette use. This finding might reflect attitudes among e-cigarette users in China and also the industry patents applied which were suggestive of weight loss. This pattern has also been observed among adolescents in the USA. Finally, our study shows that e-cigarettes are attractive to current smokers who want to quit smoking, and to frequent smokers who smoked daily, particularly those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day. However, evidence remains inconclusive on the association between e-cigarette use and successful cessation of conventional smoking. Therefore, those attempting to stop smoking are encouraged to visit smoking cessation clinics. A debate is ongoing on whether e-cigarettes serve predominantly to expose never smokers to nicotine, or to help current smokers stop smoking. Regulation of e-cigarettes could affect the health of up to 16·9 million in China. Therefore, public health communities should give increased attention to the short-term and long-term health effects of e-cigarette use and its regulation.
Importantly, our study raises a public health concern for young adults in China. The prevalence of e-cigarette use among adults aged 18–29 years increased from 2015 to 2019. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that young adults should not use e-cigarettes or vaping products that contain nicotine or tetrahydrocannabinol. The current regulations in China on e-cigarette sales and promotion were only designed to protect youth. Given the steady increase in conventional cigarette smoking among young women in China and the unclear evidence regarding the effect of e-cigarettes on fetal brain development, health policy makers and public health practitioners should invest in prevention and control plans.
Several limitations need to be noted. Firstly, our study, similar to other observational studies, was unable to distinguish the e-cigarette device, the substance being vaped, and the amount and type of exposure due to the constrained question design. This lack of distinction limited the ability of our study to evaluate health effects and infer causality. Secondly, social desirability bias or recall bias could be a limitation because e-cigarette use status was self-reported, and data on ever use or past use of e-cigarettes were not collected. The initiation date of e-cigarette use was also not requested, and thus we were unable to determine the order of initiation of conventional cigarette and e-cigarette use. Thirdly, the survey was designed for Chinese residents aged 18 years and older. Consequently, it underrepresents the younger population. The increase in e-cigarette use and awareness among current female smokers aged 18–29 years needs to be interpreted with caution due to the limited sample size. Fourthly, the prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use was higher than the current use estimated with the question “Do you currently use electronic cigarettes on a daily basis, less than daily, or not at all?”, which was included in GATS. GATS reported the prevalence of current e-cigarette use in China to be 0·5% in 2015–16 and 0·9% in 2018–19 among people aged 15 years and older. Although this increasing trend was also observed in our study, past 30-day e-cigarette use also captured a fraction of people who had tried e-cigarettes but were not self-deemed as a current user.
In conclusion, among adults in China in 2018–19, the estimated overall prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use was 1·6%, which represented an increase of 0·3% from 2015–16. The factors associated with e-cigarette use were male sex, young age, high-level education and high income status, conventional smoking, and obesity. Future studies and surveys on e-cigarette use in China will be crucial to improve understanding of the trends and potential effects of regulations.
