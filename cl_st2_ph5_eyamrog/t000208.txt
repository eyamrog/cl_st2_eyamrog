Section: Abstract

A dentate mandible and proximal femur of Mesopithecus pentelicus Wagner, 1839 are described from the Shuitangba lignite mine in Zhaotong Prefecture, northeastern Yunnan Province, China. The remains were retrieved from sediments just below those that yielded a juvenile Lufengpithecus cranium and are dated at about ∼6.4 Ma. The mandible and proximal femur were found in close proximity and are probably of the same individual. The lower teeth are metrically and morphologically closely comparable with those of confirmed M. pentelicus from Europe, and on this basis, the specimen is assigned to this species. The anatomy of the proximal femur indicates that the Shuitangba Mesopithecus was a semiterrestrial quadruped that engaged in a range of mostly arboreal activities, including walking, climbing, and occasional leaping, with an abducted hip joint. The Shuitangba Mesopithecus is dentally typical for the genus but may have been more arboreal than previously described for M. pentelicus. M. pentelicus is well known from late Miocene (MN 11–12) sites in Europe and southwest Asia. Its estimated average rate of dispersal eastward was relatively slow, although it could have been episodically more rapid. The presence of a colobine , only slightly lower in the same section at Shuitangba that produced Lufengpithecus , is one of the only two well-documented instances of the near or actual co-occurrence of a monkey and ape in the Miocene of Eurasia. At Shuitangba, M. pentelicus occupied a freshwater-margin habitat with beavers, giant otters, swamp rabbits, and many aquatic birds. The presence of M. pentelicus in southwest China near the end of the Miocene further attests to the ecological versatility of a species long recognized as widespread and adaptable. The modern colobines of Asia, some or all of which are probable descendants of Mesopithecus , have gone on to inhabit some of the most highly seasonal and extreme habitats occupied by nonhuman primates.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Mesopithecus pentelicus Wagner, 1839 was one of the first nonhuman fossil primate species to be recognized and described, from a cranial fragment recovered from the site of Pikermi (MN 12, Greece), near Athens, in the early nineteenth century ( Koufos, 2009a ). The genus Mesopithecus has been well known since the study of Gaudry (1862) . Since then, abundant remains including associated partial skeletons have been found at the classic Pikermi ravine and at other sites in Greece, as well as at sites across the breadth of southern and eastern Europe and from Russia, Iran, and Afghanistan ( Delson, 1973 ; Jablonski, 2002 ; Alba et al., 2015 ).
More than 150 years after its first discovery, M. pentelicus today represents one of the most geographically widespread and common nonhuman primate fossil species. The taxonomy of Mesopithecus has been partially revised by many scholars including Delson (1973 , 1975a) , Heintz et al. (1981) , de Bonis et al. (1990 , 1997) , Hohenegger and Zapfe (1990) , Kullmer and Doukas (1995) , Koufos et al. (2003) , and Pradella and Rook (2007) . The most complete exposition of the biology of Mesopithecus published to date is the monograph of Zapfe (1991) , devoted to specimens of M. pentelicus from Pikermi. Most accounts describe M. pentelicus as a medium-sized, semiterrestrial, and relatively unspecialized colobine monkey ( Delson, 1973 ; Zapfe, 1991 ; Youlatos, 2003 ; Youlatos and Koufos, 2010 ; Youlatos et al., 2012 ; Alba et al., 2015 ). Highly conservative in skeletal and dental morphology across space and time, Mesopithecus presents a mixture of typical cercopithecid and colobine characteristics. The presence of ancestral features such as moderate molar flare, a slightly reduced thumb, and, in several specimens of M. pentelicus , a shallow medial groove for the ‘flexor tibialis’ muscle on the astragalus denotes that Mesopithecus is among the most conservative members of the subfamily Colobinae, warranting a position as a stem colobine that existed before the split between the African Colobini and Asian Presbytini, or, in consideration also of biogeography , as being more closely related to Asian colobines (tribe Presbytini; Szalay and Delson, 1979 ; Strasser and Delson, 1987 ; de Bonis et al., 1990 ; Andrews et al., 1996 ). In a study of the phyletic relationships of the Asian colobines, Jablonski (1998) assumed the position of Mesopithecus to be that of a basal presbytinan. This study reinforced the likely basal position of Mesopithecus in Asian colobine evolution and showed that many of the anatomical features that unify the so-called odd-nosed colobines are shared ancestral characteristics from a Mesopithecus -like ancestor ( Jablonski, 1998 ).
Viewed from an ecomorphological perspective, Mesopithecus was a ‘jack-of-all-trades’ monkey, able to navigate a wide variety of substrates and terrains, eat a wide variety of foods, and tolerate a wide range of altitudes, temperatures, and rainfall regimes ( Pradella and Rook, 2007 ; Merceron et al., 2009 ; Koufos, 2009a ; Youlatos and Koufos, 2010 ). In anatomy and in locomotor and feeding habits, M. pentelicus probably resembled most closely the modern Hanuman langur, Semnopithecus entellus . Hanuman langurs are remarkable for their broad distribution, morphological variability, and versatility in locomotor regimes, diets, and social structures ( Bishop, 1979 ; Roonwal, 1981 ; Sayers and Norconk, 2008 ). This remarkable diversity and adaptability has been the focus of detailed studies of the species' locomotion ( Ripley, 1967 ) and diet ( Makwana, 1977 ; Srivastava, 1991 ; Sayers and Norconk, 2008 ) throughout its range.
Recent genetic and morphological studies indicate that Semnopithecus is polyphyletic ( Osterholz et al., 2008 ; Karanth et al., 2010 ; Nag et al., 2011 ). These results suggest the importance of conducting detailed studies of the morphological diversity, evolutionary relationships, and taxonomy of Mesopithecus . Mesopithecus was widely distributed in Eurasia in the late Miocene. Most European occurrences have been classified as M. pentelicus , with only distinctly smaller and larger morphs recognized as separate species or subspecies. A small colobine originally classified as Semnopithecus monspessulanus from early Pliocene deposits near Montpellier, France ( Gervais, 1849 ), is clearly a species of Mesopithecus ( Delson, 1973 ); it overlapped minimally or not at all with M. pentelicus in time and space and may represent a dwarfed descendant lineage that originated by allopatric speciation or a vicariant event ( Delson, 1973 , 1994 ; Andrews et al., 1996 ; Koufos, 2009b ; Alba et al., 2015 ). A larger species, Mesopithecus delsoni , has been recognized from Greece ( de Bonis et al., 1990 ), but is considered by many a junior synonym for a large morph of M. pentelicus . This suggestion was first made by Delson (1994) , was later reinforced with metrical comparisons ( Andrews et al., 1996 ), and is discussed fully elsewhere ( Alba et al., 2015 ). Colobine fossils assigned to Mesopithecus are also known from latest Miocene strata of the Pakistani Siwaliks. First described in the late 19th century ( Lydekker, 1878 ), specimens now assigned to Mesopithecus or cf. Mesopithecus sp. are part of a collection of fragmentary jaws and isolated teeth of colobines that have been classified into different genera and species over more than a century ( Szalay and Delson, 1979 ; Barry, 1987 ; Harrison and Delson, 2007 ; Khan et al., 2020 ). In a preliminary description, Harrison and Delson (2007) assigned a collection of colobine fossils from the Pakistani Siwaliks to Mesopithecus sivalensis ( Lydekker, 1878 ), as a new taxonomic combination. The morphology of M. sivalensis was likened to Mesopithecus monspessulanus because of its small size ( Harrison and Delson, 2007 ), but the material has not yet been fully described. Two of the specimens from this collection had secure locality information, permitting ages to be estimated at 6.3 Ma and between 6.5 and 5.3 Ma, respectively ( Barry, 1987 ). A new collection of fossil colobine dentate jaw fragments and teeth from the Pakistani Siwaliks at Hasnot has recently been described and assigned to cf. Mesopithecus sp. These remains probably represent M. sivalensis ; their age ranges from 7.9 to 7.1 Ma ( Khan et al., 2020 ).
Here, we describe new specimens of M. pentelicus from the site of Shuitangba (27⁰19′41.8″N, 103⁰44′13.7″E; Fig. 1 ) near Zhaotong in Yunnan Province of southwestern China, marking the easternmost occurrence of Mesopithecus to date. We also discuss the significance of these fossils for our understanding of primate dispersals and paleoecology in the late Miocene. The colobine specimens described in this article are a mandible of a female and a proximal femur, likely associated with the mandible. A left calcaneus, from slightly lower in the section, is described in a separate article ( Ji et al., 2020 ). Download: Download high-res image (3MB) Download: Download full-size image Figure 1 . Map showing the location of Shuitangba relative to the main topographic features of eastern Asia. Shuitangba is located in the tectonically active Zhaotong Basin, which has been affected by uplift of the Himalayas.
Shuitangba is a lignite mine that has yielded copious fossils of mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish ( Jablonski et al., 2014 ) as well as plentiful invertebrates and plants. It is located in the Zhaotong Basin, an ‘island’ of late Miocene to Pliocene lacustrine or swampy clays, silts, peaty clays, and lignites within a complexly deformed and metamorphosed series of Paleozoic deposits belonging to the Yunnan-Guizhou-Hubei fold belt ( Zhang et al., 1989 ). The sediments of Shuitangba include water-lain silts, conglomerates, and poorly compressed lignites termed the Zhaotong Formation ( Dai and Chou, 2007 ). Among the notable mammals discovered at Shuitangba and published so far are a hominoid , cf. Lufengpithecus lufengensis ( Ji et al., 2013 ), the oldest occurrence of the gomphotheriid Sinomastodon ( Wang et al., 2016 ), a new species of giant otter, Siamogale melilutra ( Wang et al., 2018 ), and Nesolagus longisinuosus , an early record of the extant swamp rabbit ( Flynn et al., 2019 ).

Section: Methodology, Results

Standard measurements of the mandible, mandibular dentition, and proximal femur from Shuitangba and of comparable specimens from Pikermi were taken using digital calipers, accurate to 0.01 mm. These measurements are defined and described elsewhere ( Jablonski and Leakey, 2008a ). Buccolingual and mesiodistal measurements of all teeth were taken. For the molars, buccolingual measurements were taken across the mesial (trigonid) and distal (talonid) lophids and across the waist of the lower molars. The degree of buccal flare of the molars was visually assessed and described. Measurements of the fossil teeth and mandible were compared with those taken from species of living colobines in previous studies ( Jablonski, 1995 ; Jablonski et al., 2008 ; Jablonski and Leakey, 2008b ). Measurements of the proximal femur, including femoral neck-shaft angle (NSA), were compared with those taken from samples of living colobines and cercopithecines, with additional data from Ting (2001) . The relative projection of the femoral greater trochanter was calculated following Frost and Delson (2002) . Bivariate scatterplots of selected molar and mandibular dimensions illustrate where the Shuitangba mandibular specimen falls relative to clusters of other taxa. Box-and-whisker plots show how the Shuitangba proximal femur compares with other select cercopithecoids in femoral NSA and relative projection of the femoral greater trochanter.
To better understand the paleobiogeography and paleoecology of Mesopithecus , the geographical occurrences of all representatives of the genus with their respective estimated chronometric ages and likely European Mammal Neogene (MN) stages were compiled from the literature ( Eronen and Rook, 2004 ; Koufos, 2009b ; Alba et al., 2015 ). We recognize the imprecision of some of these estimates because of uncertainties and controversies surrounding the provenience and ages of many specimens, including many of the M. pentelicus specimens from older collections. An estimate of the average rate of dispersal of Mesopithecus from Europe to China, calculated as the spread rate in km/yr, was based on estimated distances from an equal-distance projection. For this calculation, the following sites and ages were used: (1) oldest unequivocal occurrence of M. pentelicus — Ravin des Zouaves-5 in Macedonia, Greece, from early Turolian (MN 11) deposits of around 8.2 Ma ( Koufos, 2003 ; Eronen and Rook, 2004 ). The Wissberg tooth, long mooted as the oldest occurrence of Mesopithecus (Vallesian, ?MN 09; Tobien, 1986 ), appears to lack reliable identification and provenience ( Andrews et al., 1996 ; Rook, 1997 ; Koufos, 2019 ). Because of the persistent lack of confidence in the nature and circumstances of this find, it was rejected as the earliest occurrence of Mesopithecus ; (2) occurrences of M. pentelicus at Maragheh, Iran, and Molayan, Afghanistan, from middle Turolian (MN 12) deposits of about 7.5 Ma (for both places; Delson, 1973 ; Heintz et al., 1981 ; Sen, 1998 ; Alba et al., 2015 ); and (3) the Shuitangba Mesopithecus at MN 13 equivalent, about 6.4 Ma. We recognize that our acceptance of the Maragheh mandible as M. pentelicus is not universal (as per Delson, 1973 ; Heintz et al., 1981 ; and de Bonis et al., 1990 ), but our visual comparisons support the tentative assignment of the mandible to M. pentelicus and the use of the specimen as a valid point in development of a scenario of dispersal. In addition to calculation of the dispersal rates for the direct, point-to-point distances, a second set of dispersal rates was calculated based on a more geographically tenable dispersal route south of the eastern Paratethys Sea, north of the Zagros Mountains, south of the main Himalayan front and the southern end of the Hengduan Mountains , and finally north to the Zhaotong Basin. We appreciate that estimates of average dispersal rates and proposed putative dispersal routes based on the aforementioned occurrences are hypothetical and constitute only suggested scenarios of deployment.

The Mesopithecus fossils from Shuitangba described here comprise a nearly complete mandible of a female (ZT-2009-0528) and a proximal femur (ZT-2010-0065). The fossils are housed in the Department of Paleoanthropology of the Yunnan Cultural Relics and Archaeology Institute in Kunming, China.

The mandible and proximal femur were recovered in late 2009 and early 2010 from sediments which are spatially and stratigraphically close to those that produced the hominoid cranium ( Ji et al., 2013 ). Both were retrieved from the middle of the peaty clay layer (layer 10) at a depth of about 11 m from the top of the natural outcrop ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 ). The sedimentary layer bearing the mandible and femur is ∼2 m below the layer containing the hominoid, making these remains slightly older than the hominoid. The close physical and stratigraphic proximity and comparable preservation of the mandible and femur suggest that the two specimens are from the same adult individual.

The location of the Mesopithecus colobine fossils in the lithostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic context of Shuitangba is indicated by the ‘+’ sign. Geochronological determinations at Shuitangba were based on correlations between the borehole core located near the site (a–c) and the Shuitangba excavation itself (e–g), respectively. Columns (a) and (g): lithology; (b): inclination; (c) and (e): magnetic polarity zonation; (d): geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS; Cande and Kent, 1995 ) to show correlation and following agreed temporal revisions ( Gradstein et al., 2004 ), as described elsewhere ( Jablonski et al., 2014 ); (f): VGP latitudes. The hatched area in (c) indicates an interval with no data. The hominoid-bearing layer in the outcrop indicated by a solid star in (g) corresponds to the layer in the core indicated by the empty star shown in (a), which plots at the base of chron C3An.1n. The correlation between the stratigraphic sequence in the core and at the site itself was established on the basis of a distinctive lignite-peaty clay-lignite triplet associated with the hominoid, indicated by solid arrows. Note that the GPTS used in this figure ( Gradstein et al., 2004 ) and in previously published reports of fossil mammals from Shuitangba ( Ji et al., 2013 ; Jablonski et al., 2014 ) differs slightly from the newer GPTS referred previously in the text ( Hilgen et al., 2012 ).
This mostly complete specimen is nearly fully dentate, lacking only the incisors ( Figure 4 , Figure 5 ). The teeth are very lightly worn. The bone of the left side of the mandible is complete except for the gonial margin and what would have been a slightly raised crest for the insertion of the medial pterygoid. Compression and crushing of the right side of the mandible after death or during fossilization resulted in a buckling of the mandible in the rightmost portion of the symphysis and an inferior displacement of the right corpus. Fortunately, this compression did not affect the morphology of the left side of the mandible. The symphysis itself, however, was compressed and deformed near the midline by the displacement of the right corpus, rendering the symphysis unmeasurable. The bone of the right ramus was present when the specimen was found, but could not be satisfactorily reconstructed. The specimen as reconstructed lacks most of the right ramus except for the coronoid process and the rampart connecting it to the corpus. Three mental foramina are arrayed along the left corpus, with the middle foramen being the largest; four are seen on the right, but the most anterior is the largest. A small nutrient foramen lies below the furcation of the roots of the M 2 on both sides. On the left side, a further, large nutrient foramen is situated on the corpus at the level of the anterior margin of the coronoid process. The high level of vascularization suggests the presence of prominent facial vibrissae ( Van Horn, 1970 ). The symphysis is not strongly buttressed, and its long axis is steeply inclined. The corpus of the mandible is deep throughout, and the ramus is nearly upright. The gonial regions on both sides are damaged, but the more complete left side shows no sign of having been enlarged or inflated to accommodate the insertion of an enlarged superficial masseter muscle. The surface of the ramus is smooth; a faintly indented line indicates the most anterior insertion of the superficial masseter. The insertion area of the deep masseter is marked by a shallow but well-marked fossa below the coronoid process. The coronoid process is broad and bears a rounded superior outline. The top of the coronoid is slightly higher than the top of the condyle. At the base of the coronoid process where the corpus meets the ramus, a slightly raised tubercle marks the insertion of the temporalis tendon. The condyle is long and elliptical in shape. The lateral side was slightly damaged, but has been repaired. The articular surface is present on the superior aspect only; the anterior edge of the articular surface is sharply defined. The incisive alveoli on the left side are well preserved and indicate that the lower incisors were slightly procumbent. The I 1 root was larger than that of the I 2 , likely indicating the same size relationship in the crowns. Download: Download high-res image (479KB) Download: Download full-size image Figure 4 .

The dentition is very similar in details of shape to that described by Zapfe (1991) for M. pentelicus , with minor differences. In this description, we follow the standard terminology for the names of cusps and crests of cercopithecoid teeth developed by Kay (1977) and Szalay and Delson (1979) .
The lower canine is small, low crowned, narrow, and vertically implanted, with a strongly recurved tip, as in most colobines. The apex of the cusp shows only the slightest indication of wear. The cusp apex is only moderately higher than the level of the P 3 , P 4 , or molars. The mesiolingual edge of the tooth arcs inferiorly toward the slightly raised lingual cingulid thence distally to form a low talonid. The shape of the canine and P 3 indicates that the specimen was a female.
The P 3 is a narrow tooth with a moderately long and strongly developed mesiobuccal flange. In mesiodistal length and in the development of the mesiobuccal flange, it differs from the female M. pentelicus described and figured by Zapfe (1991 ; fig. 18). The mesiobuccal flange shows no evidence of wear caused by canine honing. There is a small mesial fovea anterior to the flange on the lingual surface. The protoconid is strongly supported on its buccal aspect by a stout crest, which extends further lingually and becomes rugose and bifid at the lingual cingulid. The lingual cingulid extends distally to form a slightly upturned heel, which confines the small distal basin. There is no metaconid.
The P 4 bears a protoconid and a slightly taller metaconid connected by a protocristid. The metaconid shows slight wear, exposing a pinpoint of dentine. The distal margins of the two cusps fall sharply; on the buccal aspect, this creates the appearance of a slight mesiobuccal flange. The protocristid runs transversely to divide the tooth into a smaller trigonid and a larger talonid basin. The talonid basin is flat. There is no evidence of other cusps.
The high crowns of the C 1 –P 4 complex imply a similar configuration of the C 1 –P 4 , with the large mesial honing surface of the P 3 suggesting a relatively large female C 1 .
The M 1 is a subquadrate, straight-sided, strongly bilophodont tooth. The protolophid and hypolophid are distinct, of nearly equal breadth, and divided by a narrow, deep trigonid basin. The buccal cusps show moderate wear, with that of the hypoconid being more marked. There is no dentine exposure on the lingual cusps. The protocristid and ‘crest a’ (following Szalay and Delson, 1979 ; or the lateral anterior tranverse cristid) are moderately worn. The mesial shelf is short. The distal fovea is very small and deep; the distal shelf is short. The median buccal cleft is narrow. The cusp relief is relatively low, and neither the buccal nor the lingual notches are deeply excavated. The protolophid exhibits very slight buccal flare, but this is absent in the hypolophid. The degree of buccal flare was not measured but was carefully assessed visually and noted.
The M 2 is very similar to the M 1 except that the tooth is slightly larger in all dimensions. The conformation of the mesial shelf, talonid basin, and distal fovea are the same as for the M 1 , and there is slight buccal flare. Dentine is exposed on the buccal cusps only, and the protocristid and crest a are slightly worn.
The M 3 shows a protolophid that is slightly broader than the hypolophid. The entoconid and hypoconid are smaller and of lower relief than the metaconid and protoconid. There is slight apical wear on the tips of the latter cusps. The hypoconulid is large and centrally placed. On the left side, the hypoconulid exhibits evidence of possible slight antemortem damage: a small chip is missing from the distobuccal aspect of the cusp, and the enamel surface is stained. Following the same pattern as the M 1 and M 2 , the mesial shelf is short, and the protolophid and hypolophid are separated by a deep, narrow talonid basin. The distal fovea is a short, shallow pocket confined by the mesial surface of the hypoconulid. The tooth is narrow and straight sided and exhibits only slight buccal flare of the protolophid.

The specimen is a partial right femur, broken before fossilization just above the midshaft ( Fig. 6 ). Breakage of the bone appears to have occurred after natural maceration ; the fracture is concussive and may have been caused by animal trampling. The proximal diaphysis was broken during recovery of the specimen, but this was completely repaired, and the pieces were reapposed. The femoral head is large and globular, and the articular surface has an unusual shape. Specifically, the posterior aspect is extended laterally and slightly posteriorly toward the greater trochanter and the center of the intertrochanteric fossa. It is also slightly abbreviated inferiorly, in the direction of the lesser trochanter, and is punctuated by a large and deeply excavated fovea capitis. The most superior aspect of the fovea is defined by a sharp lip. The fovea is ovate, with a pronounced posterior extension. The femoral neck is thick, short, and heavily buttressed, with stout bony ramparts extending between the neck and each of the trochanters. The neck is wide relative to the diaphysis. The greater trochanter is wide and large, but extends only slightly superior to the head. The lesser trochanter is prominent but low; it rises from a broad base on the posteromedial aspect of the shaft below the neck. The distinct, leaf-shaped facet for the insertion of the iliopsoas atop the lesser trochanter bears a distinct, linear, midline tendinous inscription. The intertrochanteric fossa is a deeply excavated and elongated pit, bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest. The intertrochanteric crest does not extend to the lesser trochanter. The surface of the greater trochanter is rugose and bears well-defined attachment areas for the hip abductors. An incised and well-marked linea aspera marks the posterior aspect of the shaft. This is separated into discontinuous proximal and distal segments. Download: Download high-res image (394KB) Download: Download full-size image Figure 6 . Proximal femur, right side, ZT-2010-0065.

In the size and shape of individual teeth, the tooth rows, and the mandible itself, ZT-2009-0528 is closely comparable with specimens of female M. pentelicus from Pikermi, to the extent that the specimen could easily become ‘lost’ in a collection of M. pentelicus ( Fig. 5 ). More generally, diagnosis of fossil colobine specimens based on dental remains is difficult because of great similarities at the subfamilial level ( Takai et al., 2015 ). Metrical comparisons alone are inadequate because differentiation of fossil colobines at the genus and species levels relies on identification of subtle features of morphology that are difficult to quantify. Our comparative study is a preliminary one, in which we have relied on visual comparisons more than metrical analyses. Review of Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 shows that the dimensions of the individual mandibular teeth and tooth rows of ZT-2009-0528 fall within the ranges of females of the smaller extant Asian colobines, most consistently Trachypithecus spp. and Simias concolor . The dental dimensions of the Shuitangba fossil are more similar to those of M. monspessulanus and are smaller than those of most M. pentelicus . The same holds for the width-to-length ratio of the individual molars, as illustrated in Figure 7 . The lower molars of ZT-2009-0528 and of Mesopithecus spp. are characterized by deep lingual and buccal notches and clefts between the lophids ( Zapfe, 1991 ). The M 1 is broad and exhibits some buccal flare, like those of Rhinopithecus , Presbytis , and Nasalis but in contrast to those of African colobines ( Zapfe, 1991 ). The M 3 bears a relatively large and slightly buccally offset hypoconulid, with a triangular outline as viewed occlusally. The size and placement of hypoconulids in Mesopithecus is variable, but in most specimens, the hypoconulid is simple, pointed, and large ( Zapfe, 1991 ; Takai et al., 2015 ).

With respect to mandibular dimensions, the condyle of ZT-2009-0528 is narrow relative to its length ( Fig. 8 , upper pane). The mandibular ramus is high relative to the thickness of the corpus at the M 2 ( Fig. 8 , lower pane). In both of these indices, ZT-2009-0528 falls within the clusters for the smaller Asian colobines ( Presbytis spp., Trachypithecus spp., and S. concolor ).

Mandibular condyle width is the mediolateral dimension of the condyle; mandibular condyle length is the anteroposterior dimension. The condyle of the Shuitangba fossil mandible is narrow relative to its length (upper pane). The mandibular corpus is high relative to the thickness of the corpus at the M 2 (lower pane). In both indices, the Shuitangba specimen falls within the clusters for the smaller Asian colobines. ZT = Zhaotong.
The most complete descriptions of the teeth and mandibles of M. pentelicus are those of Zapfe and colleagues ( Hohenegger and Zapfe, 1990 ; Zapfe, 1991 ), but Zapfe himself noted that the mandible of M. pentelicus was less diagnostic than the cranium. The relative lack of attention paid to the mandibles and mandibular dentition of Mesopithecus is apparent in the diagnoses of the species, which emphasize upper facial and postcranial features more than the morphology of the mandible and dentition ( de Bonis et al., 1990 ; Koufos, 2009a ). We appreciate the seriousness and irony of this problem. Mesopithecus remains have been recognized in the fossil record and discussed at length for over a century, but there exists neither a complete comparative study of the dentition nor a detailed diagnosis of the genus and included species from dental or other skeletal elements. We recognize the importance of this omission and the need for correction, but a complete revision of the genus Mesopithecus , including its evolutionary relationships and taxonomy, is an undertaking beyond the scope of this report.
With regard to the mandibular morphology of Mesopithecus , Delson (1973) noted that the constant height of the corpus anteroposteriorly between the alveolar plane and inferior margin was a consistent and distinctive feature of the specimens of the genus. The height of the corpus varies between the sexes within the Pikermi sample and changes through adulthood with tooth wear, but the parallel orientation of the alveolar and inferior margins of the corpus is constant. The thickness and height of the symphysis, as well as the expression of the genial fossa and symphyseal shelf, also vary by sex and according to the degree of tooth wear during adulthood. In the morphology of the mandibular corpus, symphysis, and gonial region, ZT-2009-0528 and M. pentelicus more closely resemble Rhinopithecus and Pygathrix among the Asian colobines than Semnopithecus , Presbytis , and Trachypithecus , in which the orientation of the alveolar and inferior margins of the corpus diverges posteriorly into an enlarged gonial region. Because of the dimensional similarities of the molars of M. monspessulanus to ZT-2009-0528, a comparison of the mandibular morphologies of the two morphs is of particular interest. The mandibular corpus of ZT-2009-0528 is shallower, the mandibular symphysis is thinner, and the planum alveolare is shorter than the (probably male) specimens of M. monspessulanus described from Villafranci d’Asti (see Fig. 1 in Pradella and Rook, 2007 ). In the absence of knowledge of the range of morphological variation, including the nature and degree of sexual dimorphism in the Shuitangba Mesopithecus and M. monspessulanus , the assignment of the former to M. monspessulanus cannot be ruled out. We consider this assignment unlikely, however, because the differences in symphyseal depth, thickness, and apparent cross-sectional area between M. pentelicus and M. monspessulanus males denote difference in patterns of force transmission across the symphysis ( Panagiotopoulou and Cobb, 2011 ) between the two species that would be expected to be observed in the females. Based on this inference, the mandibular morphology of M. monspessulanus females would be relatively robust compared with that of M. pentelicus females. With the mandibular symphysis of ZT-2009-0528 being very similar to that of many M. pentelicus females, we infer that the Shuitangba M. pentelicus was a relatively small-toothed variant of the species.
The lower canine of ZT-2009-0528 closely resembles that of female M. pentelicus and other female Asian colobines in exhibiting a narrow and vertically implanted crown with a recurved tip and low talonid. The P 3 of ZT-2009-0528 is the most distinctive of the mandibular teeth. It is mesiodistally long and falls outside the range of female M. pentelicus in this dimension ( Table 2 ). The protoconid has a low vertical relief, but a long, sloping, and robust mesiobuccal flange ( Delson, 1975a ). The caniniform buccal surface of the P 3 in ZT-2009-0528 is noteworthy because this configuration is common in female Mesopithecus ( Fig. 5 c). The relatively large size of the canines and P 3 s of female M. pentelicus has been recognized previously ( Hohenegger and Zapfe, 1990 ; Zapfe, 1991 ). The considerable variation in the degree of sexual dimorphism in the canine complex within and among Asian and African colobine species has been documented but remains inadequately explained ( Leutenegger, 1976 ; Leutenegger and Kelly, 1977 ; Lucas, 1982 ; Plavcan et al., 1995 ; Hayes et al., 1996 ; Koyabu and Endo, 2009 ). The P 4 is more typical of female M. pentelicus in mesiodistal length, but echoes the morphology of the P 3 in the development of the mesiobuccal flange. Delson (1973) noted that the development of a mesiobuccal flange on the P 4 is more characteristic of colobines than of cercopithecines.
The molars of Mesopithecus are often referred to only as ‘typical colobine’ ( Koufos et al., 2004 ). Subtle differences in molar morphology can be discerned among colobines, however, and these have taxonomic and functional significance. Benefit (1993) illustrated that metaconid height and mesial notch depth, the depth and shape of the median lingual and median buccal notches, and size and placement of the hypoconulid differ slightly between colobine taxa. Features such as shearing crest length, height, and orientation ( Benefit, 2000 ; Teaford et al., 2008 ; Takai et al., 2015 ), which are more clearly related to dietary properties and dental function, may also be taxonomically informative. The most useful morphological characterization, comparison, and differential diagnosis of the molars of Asian colobines were provided by Takai and colleagues (see Table 4 in Takai et al., 2015 ). They emphasize the morphology of the buccal clefts and lingual notch, the orientation of the lophids, and the size of the hypoconulid. In the expression of the buccal clefts and lingual notch, the molars of ZT-2009-0528 are typical of M. pentelicus in exhibiting shallow mesial buccal clefts, narrow and groove-like median buccal clefts, absent distal buccal clefts on the M 1 and M 2 , and a very shallow distal buccal cleft on the M 3 . The lingual notch of ZT-2009-0528 is V-shaped, as in M. pentelicus and most living Asian colobines. Like M. pentelicus , the lophids of ZT-2009-0528 are transversely oriented, rather than being slightly or very obliquely oriented as in other Asian colobines. The hypoconulid of ZT-2009-0528 is large and only slightly buccally offset. Both Delson and Zapfe noted the range in expression of the hypoconulid of M. pentelicus , with some smaller individuals lacking the cusp altogether ( Delson, 1975a ; Zapfe, 1991 ). ZT-2009-0528 was a relatively small monkey, but in the large size and more central placement of the hypoconulid, it is more typical of larger specimens of M. pentelicus and larger Asian langurs.
In functionally salient measures of the proximal femur, femoral NSA, and relative projection of the greater trochanter ( Figure 9 , Figure 10 ), the Shuitangba proximal femur ZT-2010-0065 falls within the range of values for M. pentelicus . In femoral NSA, ZT-2010-0065 and M. pentelicus fall on the low end of the range for extant colobines, but in the middle of the range for P. hamadryas and Erythrocebus patas . In the relative projection of the greater trochanter, ZT-2010-0065 and M. pentelicus fall within the ranges of most extant colobines and Lophocebus albigena , but below those for Macaca fascicularis and P. hamadryas .

The documented occurrences of Mesopithecus are summarized in Table 6 by estimated chronometric age (when available) and MN age. This summary follows that of Alba et al. (2015) , with some additions and modifications. Because of the controversy surrounding the earliest mooted occurrence of Mesopithecus from Wissberg, Germany, we have taken the oldest and most well-documented occurrences of Mesopithecus to be those from central and southeastern Europe. We also hypothesize that the direction of primary dispersal was from west to east. The dispersal of Mesopithecus appears to have been slow by mammalian standards ( Table 7 ). The fastest rate calculated for Mesopithecus , based on a ‘nonstop’ dispersal from Greece to Pakistan in the late Miocene, was approximately 0.01 km/yr ( Table 7 ). This rate is comparable with the estimated rate of mammalian species range shifts during the relative stability of the Holocene and is slower than that observed during periods of climatic change, such as at the end of the Pleistocene, or during the spread of invasive species in recent times ( Jaksic et al., 2002 ; Williams and Blois, 2018 ).

Dispersal rates of mammals depend on many factors, including the anatomy and physiology of the dispersing organisms and the ecology of the habitats into which they are dispersing. Because of these uncertainties, great ranges of variation are associated with the dispersal rates of primates in the past ( Antón et al., 2002 ). The distribution map of Mesopithecus through time ( Fig. 11 ) shows that the late Miocene (MN 11–12, designated as ‘Early’) saw the greatest expansion of the genus' distribution, from a putative center of dispersal in southern Europe through much of central Europe and eastward into Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Further apparent expansion occurred in the terminal Miocene and earliest Pliocene (MN 13–14, designated as ‘Middle’ in Fig. 11 ), with dispersal throughout southwestern Europe and eastward into southwestern China at Shuitangba. The presence of three Early localities that encircle nearly all the Middle and Late localities in Europe may, however, denote that the entire ring was occupied during the Early phase and that the later localities do not represent further expansion of the genus' range in the Middle and Late periods, but merely the presence of only younger sites within the periphery. It must also be noted that assignment to Mesopithecus of the fossils from the aforementioned three Early localities has been questioned (Eric Delson, personal communication), and the remains may be nonprimate. The Middle period marks the attainment of the largest range for the genus. In the early to mid-Pliocene (MN 15–16; ‘Late’ in Fig. 11 ), the distribution of Mesopithecus appears to retract to central Europe, including one occurrence in southern Great Britain. Note, however, that this interpretation is dependent on the presence of well-sampled localities of the appropriate age in the regions that appear to have been abandoned. Delson, 1973 , Delson, 1975a , Delson, 1975b discussed some of these issues in light of changing paleoenvironments of Mio-Pliocene Europe.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Mesopithecus is a generalized monkey, but uncertainty over its taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships remains. Some workers have cited evidence of the unreduced thumb of Mesopithecus as supporting its position as a stem colobine, preceding the divergence of Asian and African colobines ( Frost et al., 2015 ). Current knowledge of the developmental biology of the mammalian limb skeleton provides evidence that use of relative digit length as a cardinal feature for deciding evolutionary affinities is problematic. Within the preaxial domain of the developing primate limb, the relative lengths of the components of digit I (the thumb of the forelimb) are determined by variation in the dose of hox genes ( Zákány et al., 1997 ; Montavon et al., 2008 ; Hamrick, 2012 ). In a system in which morphology is determined by dose response, repeated evolution of digit reduction would be expected, including in ateline and colobine primates ( Reno et al., 2008 ). In light of this knowledge, attaching special taxonomic significance to an unreduced or a reduced thumb seems unwarranted because thumb reduction probably occurred independently in African colobines and some Asian colobines. This information is evidence that Mesopithecus is more likely to be a stem presbytinan and not a stem colobine.
In reviewing the morphology of the mandible, lower teeth, and femur of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus , we have concluded that the specimens are best accommodated in the range of variation of M. pentelicus from Pikermi. For this reason, the Shuitangba specimens are most suitably assigned at present to that species. Put another way, there is no morphological feature of these specimens that argues for their placement in another or a new taxon or that varies sufficiently from well-documented specimens of M. pentelicus to warrant any qualification to the species-level assignment (e.g., to M. cf. pentelicus ). We cannot rule out a possible assignment of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus to M. monspessulanus , but we view the shared possession of small and narrow molars as insufficient cause for doing so. We acknowledge that it has not been possible for us to do full morphological comparisons of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus with M. monspessulanus and that assignment of the Shuitangba monkey to M. pentelicus requires substantially expanding the dental size range of the species. On the basis of the fossils in hand, the Shuitangba Mesopithecus is best viewed as a small regional variant of M. pentelicus . Pending a more complete revision of the genus Mesopithecus, assignment of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus to M. pentelicus is the more conservative and parsimonious option because this species is the most geographically widespread and time-transgressive of the known species of the genus ( Delson, 1975a , b ; Alba et al., 2014 ). Geochronological and biogeographical factors strictly unrelated to morphologically based taxonomy also argue against an assignment of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus to M. monspessulanus.
It is likely that M. pentelicus varied considerably in its appearance over the expanse of its geographic and temporal range. Many extant species, subspecies, and putative hybrids of catarrhine primates (e.g., guenons, macaques, langurs, gibbons , chimpanzees, and gorillas) are distinguished from one another on the basis of soft-tissue anatomy and pelage, including coloration of the skin and hair. These features are difficult, if not impossible, to assess directly from fossil bones and teeth ( Ackermann, 2010 ), and their relevance to classification is largely a matter of personal taste. The late Miocene M. pentelicus of central and southern Europe may have looked superficially different from its conspecifics in southwestern China, but the differences in the preserved skeleton and dentition are minimal. A recent review has highlighted the complex taxonomic problems posed by relatively minor morphological and genetic variation in the extant Hanuman (gray) langur, Semnopithecus ( Nag et al., 2011 ). This group has been recognized as one species with multiple (up to 14) subspecies, or various numbers of species and constituent subspecies, primarily on the basis of pelage variation. Coat colors are highly variable among closely related primates, often because of minor variations in environmental conditions within the range of a single species ( Nag et al., 2011 ), and do not constitute barriers to reproduction. Across its geospatial range, M. pentelicus was probably highly variable in its pelage, but less variable in its skeleton and dentition. It may be that regional populations of Mesopithecus gave rise to different clades of Eurasian colobines, including some now extinct. This hypothesis needs to be tested as part of a comprehensive examination of the evolutionary history and biogeography of the genus in the context of modern, especially Asian, colobine diversity.
The geological section at Shuitangba is approximately 16-m thick, with sediments spanning the interval from ∼6.7 to 6.0 Ma ( Zhang et al., 2016 ). In light of the stratigraphic position of the Mesopithecus fossils in the Shuitangba section and estimated rate of sediment accumulation, an age of ∼6.4 Ma can be assigned to the Mesopithecus mandible and proximal femur ( Jablonski et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2019 ). The calcaneus may be slightly older than the mandible and femur. The dates of the Shuitangba section are based on a borehole sequence described elsewhere ( Jablonski et al., 2014 ), in which the reverse polarity zone R4, corresponding to C3An.1r, occurs in the upper part of the peaty clay layer. Although the reverse chron C3An.1r is absent in the natural outcrop, we inferred that its corresponding layer would be in the middle-upper part of the outcrop section. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the layer bearing the Mesopithecus mandible and femur is near the C3An.2n-to-C3An.1r transition, which is dated at 6.436 Ma in ATNTS2012 ( Hilgen et al., 2012 ). The age of the Yunnan Mesopithecus falls within the same range as that of most European occurrences of M. pentelicus , that is, in MN 13, between ca. 7.0 and 5.3 Ma ( Alba et al., 2015 ).
A preliminary study of the micromammals from the site revealed an inventory similar to that of Lufeng ( Storch and Qiu, 1991 ; Storch and Ni, 2002 ), which is dated between 6.9 and 6.2 Ma ( Dong and Qi, 2013 ), but containing more derived species of murine, bamboo rats ( Miorhizomys ), beavers, and the large mole shrew Anourosorex, all suggesting a slightly younger age for Shuitangba than Lufeng.
The functional significance of the proximal femur of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus is difficult to interpret, especially in the absence of the acetabulum of the pelvis, distal femur, and most of the remainder of the distal hind limb . Further relevant information on hind limb morphology in the Shuitangba Mesopithecus is contained in Ji et al. (2020) describing calcaneal morphology.
The posterior extension of the femoral head onto the neck is one of the most distinctive features of the Shuitangba proximal femur. This feature is observed in many living and fossil primates and close primate relatives. In plesiadapiforms, the posterior extension of the femoral head occurs in conjunction with a posteriorly offset fovea capitis and a lack of projection of the greater trochanter ( Bloch and Boyer, 2007 ). These features, along with a large and deeply excavated intertrochanteric fossa , which accommodated strong lateral rotators and abductors of the hip joint, have been interpreted to indicate abducted and laterally rotated hip postures that promote mobility of the hip ( Bloch and Boyer, 2007 ). This same suite of features is seen in the Shuitangba proximal femur. Ford (1988 , 1990) noted that posterior extension of the articular surface of the femoral head in platyrrhines is observed in species with varying locomotor and postural adaptations and suggested that a commonality is that it consistently facilitates lateral rotation of the hip joint. She found that the feature was most pronounced in habitual leapers, in which lateral rotation of the hip joint accompanies an abducted femur. The presence of an extended articular surface in some leaping primates, including Presbytis melalophos (see Fleagle, 1977 , Ford, 1980 ), suggests that the Shuitangba Mesopithecus may have engaged in at least occasional arboreal leaping. The morphology of the articular surface of the femoral head, the thickness of the femoral neck, the near-perpendicular orientation of the neck to the shaft, and the large size and small relative projection of the greater trochanter are characteristics consistently found in leaping cercopithecoids and platyrrhines ( Runestad Connour et al., 2000 ; Walker, 2005 ).
Overall, the proximal femoral morphology of ZT 2010-0065 suggests committed, but not obligate, arboreality consistent with a locomotor classification of semiterrestrial quadrupedalism. The femoral NSA of M. pentelicus falls in the more arboreal end of the range of M. pentelicus , but within the ranges of extant monkeys that exhibit a mixture of terrestrial and arboreal quadrupedalism ( Fig. 9 ). As mentioned previously, the slight relative projection of the femoral greater trochanter ( Fig. 10 ) indicates a wide range of hip joint motion associated with arboreality. Most interpretations of the posture and ocomotion of M. pentelicus have emphasized the locomotor versatility of the species ( Zapfe, 1991 ; Youlatos and Koufos, 2010 ; Youlatos et al., 2012 ). The mixture of traits of the proximal femur of the Shuitangba Mesopithecus indicates that it was adept at walking and occasionally leaping through the trees and that it was also an agile walker on the ground, exhibiting a varied locomotor habitus comparable with that of the gray langur, S. entellus , today. Functional interpretation of the Shuitangba calcaneus reinforces the interpretation of the monkey as semiterrestrial, being mostly an agile arboreal quadrupedal walker and occasional leaper that also engaged in some terrestrial walking ( Ji et al., 2020 ). The reader is encouraged to consult the articles of Youlatos (2003) and Youlatos and Koufos (2010) for more detailed information on the probable locomotor and postural repertoire of Mesopithecus .
The average dispersal rates of Mesopithecus, of 0.01 km/yr or less, are within the ranges calculated previously for Mesopithecus and for the other well-known long-distance cercopithecoid dispersers, Macaca and Theropithecus ( Antón et al., 2002 ). An average value does not, however, bear a necessary relationship to the actual progress of dispersal. This could have happened in a single burst: a species may have been restricted to one place for some time and then quickly dispersed to another. The actual pattern and timing of dispersal can only be determined from multiple well-dated sites along the route of progress, and we lack these for Mesopithecus .
A study of the plant remains, clay mineralogy , and geochemistry indicates a climate at Shuitangba that was mildly warm and humid under the influence of the Asian monsoon, with warm and wet summers and cool and dry winters ( Zhang et al., 2016 ; Huang et al., 2017 ; Li et al., 2019 ). The sedimentology and taphonomy of Shuitangba indicate that the site was a shallow freshwater lake or swamp environment in which animal remains were deposited and minimally transported ( Jablonski et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2019 ). Changes in the water level are indicated by the repeated intercalation of shelly and nonshelly layers throughout much of the section. Standing fresh water was surrounded by a complex vegetation community, which is well represented by numerous seeds, pollen grains, leaves, and wood ( Huang et al., 2015 , 2017 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). These remains provide a glimpse of the complex habitat and vegetational structure of late Miocene Shuitangba containing mixed broad-leaved trees, lianas , herbs, and shrubs surrounding a lake with floating aquatic plants .
The avian and nonprimate mammal fauna of Shuitangba also supports an interpretation that the site represents a continuously wet freshwater-margin environment, as evidenced by copious fossils of waterfowl and remains of beavers, giant otters, and swamp rabbits ( Zhang et al., 2013 ; Jablonski et al., 2014 ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Flynn et al., 2019 ). The recent recognition of the swamp rabbit, Nesolagus , at Shuitangba and Lufeng is consistent with a wet, swamp-margin environment ( Flynn et al., 2019 ).
A recent study of the putative diet of Lufengpithecus at Shuitangba revealed the presence of edible nuts and seeds including hickory ( Carya ) and hazelnut ( Corylus ; Huang et al., 2015 ; Huang et al., 2017 ). These materials would have been good sources of protein and energy for Mesopithecus. Studies of dental microwear of Mesopithecus specimens from eastern Europe show features consistent with a diet including hard and brittle foods such as nuts and seeds ( Merceron et al., 2009 ).
We embarked on a reconstruction of the putative appearance of M. pentelicus at Shuitangba because of the central importance of Mesopithecus to our understanding of colobine evolution. The Asian colobines today comprise the odd-nosed monkeys ( Rhinopithecus , Pygathrix , Nasalis , and Simias ), the gray langurs ( Semnopithecus ) , and the remaining langurs and leaf monkeys ( Trachypithecus and Presbytis ). The many morphological similarities between Mesopithecus and the Asian colobines and the estimated timing of divergence of the Asian colobine lineages ( Roos et al., 2011 ; Liedigk et al., 2012 ; Ledevin and Koyabu, 2019 ) suggest that populations of Mesopithecus became isolated in South and East Asia during the late Miocene. These populations may, in turn, have given rise to the Semnopithecus -odd-nosed colobine and Trachypithecus-Presbytis clades in quick succession. The precise nature of the lineage-splitting events and their taxonomic implications for Mesopithecus are beyond the scope of this article, but the descendants of Mesopithecus would appear to live on in southern, eastern, and Southeast Asia today. As such, they are informative concerning the reconstruction of pelage in the Shuitangba Mesopithecus .
The living Asian colobine species exhibit a great diversity of pelage patterns and colors, and one of the most important considerations in developing a reconstruction of the integument of Mesopithecus was that the pelage not be so extreme in the nature and pattern of color so as to preclude the evolution of the complex patterns of color and hypertrichy seen in the Asian colobine descendants of Mesopithecus today. The colorful interpretation of M. pentelicus from Shuitangba created by Mauricio Antón ( Fig. 12 ) is an artist's reconstruction that takes account of the developmental fields which probably influenced the animal's pelage pattern. It is also consistent with the coats of monkeys living in closed, humid forests ( Caro, 2005 ; Bradley and Mundy, 2008 ). The appearance of M. pentelicus at Pikermi and other more open-habitat settings probably was lighter overall, with less marked color differentiation of the coat by developmental region, as shown in other reconstructions ( Zapfe, 1991 ; Koufos et al., 2003 ).

One of the most intriguing aspects of the Shuitangba primate fauna is that it records the presence of a hominoid and a cercopithecoid in closely adjacent strata of the same section of terminal Miocene sediments. This is only the second well-documented near or actual co-occurrence of an ape and a monkey in the Miocene of Eurasia, the other being at the late Miocene site of Maragheh in Iran ( Ataabadi et al., 2016 ; Suwa et al., 2016 ). At Maragheh, the hominoid and cercopithecoid fossils were found in the same layer, dating to ∼7.6 Ma ( Ataabadi et al., 2016 ; Sawada et al., 2016 ) and thus represent a definitive co-occurrence, at least within the constraints of time resolution applied to any single sedimentary horizon. Another potential instance of co-occurrence is found in Bulgaria, where a hominoid premolar was recovered from the latest Miocene (Turolian) site of Azmaka, which also produced Mesopithecus ( Spassov and Geraads, 2008 ; Spassov, 2009 ; Spassov et al., 2012 ). However, the hominoid was found by a private collector, so neither its provenance nor its stratigraphic position can be verified, while the Mesopithecus material was found some distance from the area that was said to have produced the hominoid ( Spassov, 2009 ).
The co-occurrence of an ape and monkey at Shuitangba and Maragheh, and perhaps Azmaka, speaks to the ability of apes and monkeys to cohabit in environments that are favorable to both, as was the case at several locations throughout the Miocene of East Africa ( Grossman et al., 2014 ) and in both central Africa and Southeast Asia today. Nevertheless, it has been proposed based on a tabulation of overall species numbers in broad temporal increments ( Andrews, 1981 ; Temerin and Cant, 1983 ) that, over the course of the Miocene, monkeys competitively displaced apes over much of the Old World, resulting in highly reduced ape species numbers and relic distributions, a hypothesis recently revived by Hunt (2016) . However, the dramatic reduction in the number of ape species and the concurrent contraction in their overall range, as well as the near absence of ape and monkey co-occurrence across Eurasia throughout the Miocene, is instead likely due to a combination of environmental factors affecting apes and barriers to dispersal, either biotic or physical, affecting monkeys.
The fossil record demonstrates that apes became extinct during the late Miocene over much of Eurasia owing to changing environmental conditions ( Nelson, 2007 ; Merceron et al., 2010 , 2013 ; Casanovas-Vilar et al., 2011 ) before the dispersal of monkeys from Afro-Arabia, to which the latter had been restricted since the Oligocene. Continuous sections in Eurasia that record both hominoids and cercopithecoids (Axios Valley, Greece; Chalkidiki Peninsula [Nikiti], Greece; Baccinello, Italy; Siwaliks, Pakistan) all reveal that cercopithecoid fossils postdate the last occurrence of hominoids and are elements of broader faunal turnover ( Rook et al., 2000 ; Barry et al., 2002 ; Koufos et al., 2003 , 2016 ; Koufos, 2006b ; Casanovas-Vilar et al., 2011 ). However, as is evident from the noted instances of ape and monkey co-occurrences near the end of the Miocene, apes did persist in parts of southern and southeastern Europe ( Güleç et al., 2007 ; Rook et al., 2011 ; Spassov et al., 2012 ; Kaya et al., 2016 ; Fuss et al., 2017 ; Böhme et al., 2017 ; Agustí et al., 2020 ) and southwestern Asia ( Suwa et al., 2016 ; Mirzaie Abaadi et al., 2016 ) after monkeys expanded into Eurasia. A precise date for the earliest appearance of Eurasian monkeys cannot be established, with the earliest reliable date being ca. 8.2 Ma at Ravin des Zouaves-5, Greece ( Koufos, 2009a ; Alba et al., 2015 ). Apparently earlier records of monkeys are the roughly contemporaneous localities of Nikiti 2 in Greece and Grebeniki 1 in Ukraine, estimated by biochronology to be between 8.7 and 8.3 Ma ( Koufos et al., 2016 ). Apes persisted until ca. 7.2 Ma in southeastern Europe ( Böhme et al., 2017 ) and until ∼6.7 Ma in insular Italy ( Rook et al., 2011 ; Rook, 2016 ). Thus, although temporal overlap between apes and monkeys in these regions likely lasted on the order on one million years or more (longer if including insular Italy), known instances of co-occurrence are limited to the three noted previously, with one of these only a possibility. Therefore, interactions between apes and monkeys over this long time interval and continent-wide expanse appear to have been, at most, uncommon and seemingly rare. Given this rarity, and the fact that apes had become extinct over much of their previous range in Eurasia before the appearance of monkeys, there is no support for the argument that monkeys displaced apes in Eurasia (or elsewhere) as Andrews (1981) and Hunt (2016) have hypothesized only by referencing relative abundances in the two groups over broad swathes of time but without consideration of the particulars of time or geography.
Interestingly, the conditions of possible or actual monkey and ape co-occurrence in southeastern Europe and southwest Asia on the one hand and southwest China on the other hand were fundamentally different in ways that attest to the biological flexibility and broad tolerances of Mesopithecus . In contrast to other Miocene apes and extant apes, those in the latest Miocene of southeastern Europe and southwest Asia were able to exist in habitats that are unfavorable to the majority of apes, but that are easily tolerated by monkeys. These were likely characterized by the related factors of heightened or more prolonged seasonality, a more open vegetation structure, and more extreme cold-season temperatures ( Merceron et al., 2013 ; Ataabadi et al., 2016 ; Böhme et al., 2017 ), although there are indications that the localities preserving late-surviving apes in southeastern Europe (Azmaka; Pyrgos, Greece; Çorakyerler, Turkey) were somewhat wetter and/or more humid than the surrounding areas and this part of Europe as a whole ( Kaya et al., 2016 ; Böhme et al., 2017 ). In contrast, the habitat at Shuitangba was typical of the less intensely seasonal, more densely forested habitats in which apes thrive ( Jablonski et al., 2000 , 2014 ; Huang et al., 2017 ) but which monkeys are also able to exploit. Thus, toward the close of the Miocene in Eurasia, monkeys came to live alongside apes in some of the areas and habitats, where the latter persisted when the belated dispersal of monkeys from Afro-Arabia finally brought them into the Eurasian landmass.
The establishment of M. pentelicus in Yunnan by about 6.4 Ma was made possible because a suitable habitat for dispersal existed across southern Eurasia through the late Miocene. This habitat was probably a mixture of woodlands and more open biomes, the latter supporting a larger fraction of open country — preferring bovids and equids ( Janis, 1993 ; Eronen et al., 2009 ; Mirzaie Ataabadi, 2010 ). The dispersal of Mesopithecus occurred during a period of dramatic changes to species composition, diversity, and the ecological structure that occurred as a result of vegetation changes in Eurasian terrestrial ecosystems at the end of the Miocene ( Badgley et al., 2008 ; Mirzaie Ataabadi, 2010 ; Madern and van den Hoek Ostende, 2015 ). The reasons for the arrival of Mesopithecus into southwest China 1.5 million years after its appearance in South Asia cannot be explained by the absence of an appropriate habitat, however, and may be due to other paleogeographic factors such as the accessibility of the Zhaotong Basin. At Shuitangba, the newly arrived colobine entered an at least partly wet, swampy forest ecosystem and appears to have coexisted there in a partly enclosed, forested basin with the old forest denizen, Lufengpithecus . The success of Mesopithecus in Eurasia and at Shuitangba was made possible by its notable dietary flexibility and locomotor versatility. M. pentelicus is often characterized as a large, semiterrestrial colobine monkey, but this simplistic characterization does not do justice to what was the species' likely behavioral range and adaptability. Its postcranial morphology, like that of living S. entellus ( Ripley, 1967 ), probably permitted versatile quadrupedalism that rendered it equally at home on the ground or in the trees. This locomotor versatility would have been matched by considerable dietary flexibility and an ability to harvest and digest a wide variety of plant foods, thanks to the likely presence of foregut fermentation ( Stewart, 1999 ; Schienman et al., 2006 ), an aspect of colobine morphology and physiology that warrants further elaboration.
Foregut fermentation was a key innovation that provided colobines with an advantage in highly seasonal environments with plant foods of mixed quality. Mammals with foregut fermentation exhibit enhanced production of the enzymes lysozyme and pancreatic ribonuclease in the gut, making it possible for energy and protein building blocks to be derived from low-quality and sometimes toxic plant foods. Studies of the genetic basis of lysozyme and pancreatic ribonuclease production in colobine monkeys and ruminant artiodactyls have demonstrated that foregut fermentation evolved convergently in the two lineages ( Messier and Stewart, 1997 ; Stewart, 1999 ; Schienman et al., 2006 ). In foregut fermenting mammals, bacteria in the forestomach detoxify and ferment ingested plant material, thereby liberating short-chain fatty acids that serve as an energy source. Lysozyme in the true stomach breaks down the bacterial fermenters , thus liberating their constituent proteins and nucleic acids for use. Pancreatic ribonuclease in the small intestine then further breaks down the cell contents of the bacteria, making available nitrogen and phosphorus to be used in protein synthesis . The evolution of these mechanisms has been described in a series of pioneering articles by Stewart and colleagues ( Messier and Stewart, 1997 ; Stewart, 1999 ), with foregut fermentation shown conclusively to have originated in the ancestral colobine lineage 10–15 million years ago ( Schienman et al., 2006 ). The separate origins of this metabolic system in African and Asian colobines are unlikely in light of the complexity of the anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology involved. We can reasonably infer that Mesopithecus possessed foregut fermentation and that this ability contributed to its survival and success in a variety of Eurasian environments. Possession of a ruminant gut also has allowed Mesopithecus to neutralize toxic allelochemicals occurring in the leaves and seeds of its diet and to be largely free of requirements for drinking water ( Waterman et al., 1980 ; Van Soest, 1982 ; Cork, 1996 ). M. pentelicus was the epitome of a primate generalist, with digestive and locomotor systems capable of adapting to a wide variety of environmental circumstances from forest to woodland to grassland and every ecotone in between. The discovery of Mesopithecus at Shuitangba extends the known range of habitats in which the genus is found, which gives an even fuller appreciation of its ecological flexibility.
