Title: Investigating predatory publishing in political science: a corpus linguistics approach


Abstract: Abstract

This article explores the application of corpus linguistics methods in dealing with an underexplored area concerning predatory publishing, with a focus on lexical bundles and formulaicity. Using a comparative approach, the study employs two corpora of more than 1,6 million words, consisting of 220 research articles drawn from two comparable journals in the field of political science , one predatory and one top-ranking. The results show that writers publishing in the top-ranking journal use a more limited range of lexical bundles with a higher frequency, giving further evidence for the highly formulaic nature of the genre. The two groups of writers also display different preferences for lexical bundles with particular functions and/or forms. While the top-ranking journal articles feature more disciplinary-specific bundles with noticeable variation across the main sections of the research article, the predatory journal articles highlight in particular a set of common-core lexical bundles typical of general academic language use. Our findings also demonstrate the potential of lexical bundles in revealing the amount of scientific information research articles contain as well as the level of scientific literacy of the authors.

Section: 1. Introduction

In recent years, predatory publishing has become a much-debated topic within academia. A working definition of this term is provided by Grudniewicz et al. (2019, p. 211) as follows: “Predatory journals and publishers are entities that prioritize self-interest at the expense of scholarship and are characterized by false or misleading information, deviation from best editorial and publication practices, a lack of transparency, and/or the use of aggressive and indiscriminate solicitation practices.” Indeed, predatory publishing is a complex, multifaceted and multi-layered development in academic publishing. As a result, the phenomenon has now been investigated from a range of different angles, and its general characteristics have been well documented (cf. Eriksson and Helgesson 2017 ). In particular, some key features of predatory publishing have generated concern because of the fraudulent nature of the practices that these publishers frequently engage in. Such malpractices include: lack of proper peer-review ( Stromberg 2014 ), plagiarism ( Martin and Martin 2016 ), manipulation of metrics (e.g. providing fake journal impact factors) ( Shamseer et al. 2017 ), concealing author processing charges ( Djuric 2015 ), lack of retraction policies ( Umlauf and Mochizuki 2018 ), providing false claims of journal/publisher location ( Kurt 2018 ), hijacking names and websites of established journals ( Dadkhah et al. 2016 ), and spamming authors to attract as many article submissions as possible ( Lewinski and Oermann 2018 ; Author & Other 2019).
In addition to describing the practices predatory publishers engage in, much of the debates about this phenomenon tend to concentrate on meta-data analyses, including large-scale mapping of the geographic origin of outlets of this kind and of authors who publish in them (cf. Shen and Björk 2015 ; Xia et al. 2015 ). In their overview study, Shen and Björk (2015) manage to document the exponential increase of predatory publishers: from 53,000 articles in 2010 to 420,000 in 2014, published by an estimated number of 8,000 journals. In terms of the location of publishers and origin of authors, Shen and Björk find that Asia and Africa are over-represented regions in this kind of publications. The latter is emphasised by Xia et al. (2015 : 1406), who find that those who publish in predatory journals tend to be “young and inexperienced researchers from developing countries”. As a result, there is a commonly widespread assumption in the literature on predatory publishing that most of those who publish in these journals are naïve victims that simply fall prey of the marketing tactics employed by these presses. So far, however, little attention has been paid to the content of articles published in predatory journals, an aspect that has indeed been pointed out as important in order to better understand the phenomenon ( Eriksson and Helgesson 2017 ). The present study is an attempt to fill the gap by addressing the topic of predatory publishing from a linguistic perspective.
Our previous study ( Soler and Wang, 2019 ) is one of the few that addresses the topic of predatory publishing from a linguistic perspective. By means of a keyword analysis, the study reveals that words of general English are over-represented in articles drawn from a predatory journal in political science whereas those from a top-ranking counterpart feature research-related keywords. To delve further into the content of predatory journal articles, the present study shifts attention away from individual words and focuses on recurrent word combinations, as they are often associated with frequently occurring meanings in a given discourse community (e.g., Hyland 2008a ; Durrant 2017 , 2019).

Section: 2. Lexical bundles and formulaicity in academic writing

Lexical bundles refer to recurrent word combinations in written or spoken discourse, regardless of their structural and semantic unity (e.g., it is important to, one of the, if you look at ) ( Biber et al. 1999 ). Many of them can be regarded as formulaic either in the sense of grammatical irregularity and/or semantic opacity (e.g., suffice it to say, shed light on) or simply because they are the normal ways of saying things in a given situation - judged by frequency of occurrence (e.g., is found to, it is possible that ) ( Wray 2008 ). The fact that they can be identified automatically in large samples of language and often have definable functions makes them particularly promising in studying formulaicity of texts ( Durrant 2017 : 166). By formulaicity, it means that language is replete with word strings that habitually appear together which seem to be treated as unanalysed entities ( Sinclair 1991 ). From a psycholinguistic point of view, retrieving such ready-made word strings, or chunks, whole from memory at the time of use, rather than generating novel expressions each time, help reduce processing and storage demands ( Miller 2011 ). At the same time, the prevalence of chunks in language can be accounted for by human beings’ desire to sound like others in a given community ( Wray 2002 , 2008).
Academic discourse represents a type of “socially situated practice” ( Hyland 2012 : 60), and as noted by Wells (1992) , each academic discipline constitutes a way of making sense of human experience that has evolved over generations and, as a result, each has formed its own particular practices and modes of discourse. In other words, academic communication depends, to a large extent, on shared experience and conceptual fluency, thereby making the use of formulaic language particularly relevant ( Kecskes 2010 ). Indeed, empirical observations have shown that academic writing is marked by a high degree of formulaicity and fixedness of usage patterns (e.g., Pérez-Llantada 2014 ; Wang, 2018 ).
Over the last decade, corpus studies have revealed that lexical bundles, one type of formulaic language, are particularly prevalent in academic discourse. They play an important role in distinguishing different academic genres (e.g., Biber et al. 2004 ; Wang, 2017 ) and disciplines (e.g., Hyland 2008a ; Durrant 2017 ; Gilmore and Miller 2018 ) in terms of meaning-shaping, stance-taking, and discourse-building, to mention a few of their functions. In addition, lexical bundles have proved useful in distinguishing writers or speakers with different levels of proficiency and expertise (e.g., Hyland 2008b ; Chen and Baker 2010 ; Ädel and Erman 2012 ). In general, the use of formulaic language is often seen as a feature that identifies members of a given discourse community who normally conform to “conventional ways of expressing frequently occurring meanings” in the community ( Durrant 2019 : 212). As mentioned earlier, the authors who publish in predatory journals tend to be early-career researchers from developing countries ( Xia et al. 2015 ). No such assumption is made in the present study, however, as it does not involve interviewing the authors whose articles are examined (cf. Section 3 ). In particular, we make no assumption as regards the language proficiency of the writers contributing to the predatory journal. In other words, we do not assume that they are less proficient language users (as language learners or novice writers) than those publishing in more prestigious outlets. What we set out to do is to investigate what lexical bundles can tell us about features that characterise their writing.
Although scientific research articles have received much scrutiny in terms of formulaic language use, they are often treated as a specific genre in its entirety. As Biber and Conrad (2019) suggest, even within the same genre, there can be more specialised registers (i.e., text varieties) characterising the constituent sections with different communicative purposes. Hitherto, little is known about the commonalities and differences in the use of formulaic language across the sections of a research article. Shahriari (2017) is one of the first attempts to compare lexical bundles across the Introduction, Method, and Results sections of research articles published in the field of applied linguistics . The study shows considerable in-text variation within these three sections – a promising aspect for further investigation that will be taken up in the present study.
To sum up, in this article, we follow up on our previous study ( Soler and Wang, 2019 ) in a corpus-based investigation of linguistic features that characterise research articles published in a predatory journal in the discipline of political science . In order to find out what features that are typical of a text variety, it is necessary to use a comparative approach ( Biber and Conrad (2019) ). Therefore, we also involve research articles from a top-ranking journal in the same field as a basis of comparison. Focusing on lexical bundles, we aim to answer the following research questions: RQ1. What are the similarities and differences between the predatory and top-ranking journal articles under investigation, as reflected by lexical bundles in terms of their frequencies, forms and functions? RQ2. To what extent does the use of such bundles vary across the main sections of the research article in the two sets of data?

Section: 3. Data and procedure

Before we present the data, a few words about our choice of discipline are in order. We chose to focus on the field of political science for several reasons. First of all, this is a discipline that has not been extensively studied in terms of formulaic language use. The compilation and analysis of a specialised corpus in this field will add to the growing body of research on disciplinary writing. Additionally, we have access to expert informants of the field, who are of great value when it comes to the selection of journals and the interpretation of some results.
One of the journals selected for the present investigation is an open-access journal, published since 2011, accessed and discovered by us in April 2018. It is regarded as predatory since it is not included in the relevant indexing databases (e.g. Directory of Open Access Journals), and its publisher is included in the latest list of alleged predatory publishers by Beall (2017), a list he developed on the basis of the recommendations from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). In addition, the journal also satisfies 14 out of 25 items in the list of criteria characterising predatory journals devised by Eriksson and Helgesson (2017 : 165), a more precise indicator of its predatory-like nature. Some of the relevant points in Eriksson and Helgesson's list include: the journal is not indexed in well-established electronic databases, it provides an unrealistic (and misleading) impact factor calculation (based on Google Scholar), and it engages in email invitations (with unrealistic time-frames leading to publication) sent to authors with an expertise outside the journal's remit.
The comparison journal, published now for more than sixty years, has been consistently ranked among the top journals in the field (ISI Journal Citation Reports); it is published by a well-known and prestigious academic publishing house, and it is the flagship journal associated with a reputed scientific association in political science. In the article, we refer to the alleged predatory journal as PJPS (Predatory Journal in Political Science), and the top-ranking journal with the acronym TRJPS (Top-Ranking Journal in Political Science).The two journals are comparable in terms of aims and scope, i.e. both are generalistic, and cover a relatively broad spectrum of subfields and topics within political science, from comparative politics to political theory . Finally, the status of the two journals was checked with two expert informants in the field, who confirmed that: (a) they had never heard of the predatory journal before we asked them about it, and (b) they did recognise the top-ranking journal as one of the key journals in political science.
Considering changes over time in academic writing (e.g., Hyland and Jiang 2018 ), the selection of articles was limited to the most recent time period, namely, the 2000s. 220 research articles were then randomly selected by a research assistant from this period to ensure that we have a representative sample of texts from each journal. 1
As it turned out, the authors involved in the TRJPS corpus were predominantly based at universities in the USA (often Ivy League universities), as opposed to a great diversity evident among the authors contributing to the PJPS corpus. Unlike in some previous studies (e.g., Xia et al. 2015 ; Shen and Björk 2015 ) which found that the majority of authors publishing in predatory journals come from developing countries, institutions in both developing and developed countries were involved in the present study. In fact, over 40 per cent of the articles in the PJPS corpus were produced by authors based at various institutions from North American and European countries, with the USA topping the list (24 out of 110). The top two developing countries involved were China (10) and Nigeria (7) (see Soler and Wang, 2019 for more details). Note that where the authors were based does not tell us anything about their first language (L1) backgrounds. There may well be native and non-native speakers of English in both groups of authors. Both corpora have single- and co-authored articles, although the top-ranking journal has more co-authored articles than single-authored ones (65 vs. 45), whereas the contrary is true for the predatory journal articles (74 single-authored vs 36 co-authored).
As shown in Table 1 , the corpora consist of over 1.6 million running words, excluding reference lists and contents in tables and figures. Table 1 presents the word counts of the two corpora. Altogether, 1,541,882 words were subjected to the present investigation. The PJPS articles are in general shorter than those in the TRJPS corpus. Table 1 . Data used for the study Corpora Years No. of articles Running words Words used for this study Mean (in words) PJPS 2011-2018 110 653,997 623,158 5,665 TRJPS 2001-2018 * 110 1,065,960 918,724 8,352 ⁎ The TRJPS corpus covers a slightly longer time span than does the PJPS corpus as PJPS is a newer journal.
The articles were marked up for sections, including Abstract, Introduction, Background, Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgement, Footnote, and Supporting information, following the structure of the majority of research articles drawn from the top-ranking journal. Some of the sections such as Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion can be found in almost all the articles under investigation. Some may be absent or not clearly marked out and were thus manually identified. In the present study, the Introduction section was considered containing the rationale of the study in question and often some metatext about the organisation of the article; the Background section may include any of the following: theoretical background (namely literature review), research questions or hypotheses, and historical development of a given issue/phenomenon; the Methods section normally contains research design, data selection, methodological framework, or statistical models; the Results and Discussion section presents the results as well as an analysis based on specific data involved; the Conclusion section sums up the study and may or may not include a discussion of the limitations and directions for future research.
Fig. 1 shows the percentages of words that the sections account for in each corpus. As can be seen, the articles in the two corpora are quite similar in terms of Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusion. The Methods sections in the TRJPS articles, however, constitute a considerably larger proportion than that in the PJPS counterparts, which have longer Results and Discussion sections, instead. This suggests that the authors involved in the two corpora may tackle their articles somewhat differently: the authors of the latter in general devoted less attention to methodological issues while paying more emphasis on their results and discussion than did those of the former.

Frequency and dispersion are the main criteria used in the literature to retrieve lexical bundles (see, for instance, Ädel and Erman 2012). It is known that lexical bundles of different lengths vary in frequency of occurrence ( Biber et al. 1999 ; Biber et al. 2004 ), and the actual cut-off points, which are often arbitrarily set ( Hyland 2008a ; Bestgen 2020 ), range from 10 (e.g., Biber et al. 1999 ) to 20 (e.g., Cortes 2004 ; Hyland 2008a ) and 40 times per million words (e.g., Biber et al. 2004 ), depending on the size of data as well as the length of bundles in question. Given the relatively small size of the data involved in the present study, we decided to focus on 3-word bundles, which would yield an optimum number of bundles that are sufficiently representative of the corpora but are also manageable for manual sifting and categorisation . The frequency threshold was set to be 16 per million words (raw occurrences >= 15 in the TRJPS corpus and >= 10 in the PJPS corpus), occurring in at least ten different articles in each corpus. As some 3-word bundles are part of longer formulaic sequences (for instance, on the other and the other hand are both part of a 4-word bundle on the other hand ), to make it easier to clean up and classify the retrieved bundles, the same frequency and dispersion threshold was also used to retrieve 4- and 5-word bundles. As expected, using the same threshold, 4- and 5-word bundles retrieved are minimal, and all of them have various shorter configurations.
WordSmith Tools (6.0) ( Scott 2015 ) was used to retrieve lexical bundles under consideration. They were then manually sifted through to remove overlapping items with the same frequencies. For instance, the two bundles mentioned above ( on the other, the other hand ) were removed from the final list, with only on the other hand left. Concordances were checked to ensure that two or more word strings indeed overlap with each other before the removal of the less complete one(s). Note that some of the bundles on the final lists may appear to be overlapping with each other, such as more likely to (387 instances) and are more likely to (171 instances) drawn from the TRJPS corpus. At the first glance, one may assume that more likely to is part of the longer sequence are more likely to , but a close look at the concordance lines revealed that apart from the overlapping sequences (a proportion of more likely to are indeed part of the longer sequence are more likely to ), the former can also form other formulaic patterns with other words (e.g., be significantly/relatively/generally/far/N times more likely to, seems/becomes/should be/may be more likely to ) and was therefore treated as a bundle in its own right.
The bundles that remained were classified into five broad syntactic forms as illustrated in Table 2 , and nine functional categories following the framework in Table 3 , which was developed on the basis of Biber et al. (2004) , Cortes (2004) , and Hyland (2004 , 2008a). Briefly, research-oriented bundles make reference to physical or abstract entities or activities involved in research. Text-oriented bundles help achieve cohesion of a text, including conventional transition signals, structuring signals (used to refer to information in other parts of the text), and framing signals (used to signal causative or other interferential relations between different elements in the discourse). Participant-oriented bundles are used to express the writer's attitudes or to interact with the readers. Table 2 . Lexical bundles classified according to their syntactic forms.

It is important to emphasise that the concordances lines were checked to identify the function of a given bundle. Take we estimate the as an example. Taken out of context, it seems to be a P1 bundle. But estimate occurs quite frequently in the top-ranking journal articles. In most cases, it is more related to their research procedure (similar to hypothesizing or calculating) rather than the writer's attitude or evaluation; see Example (1). The same can be said of the bundle to estimate the in Example (2). This is why both bundles were treated as R3 bundles. 1) Representing this effect substantively , we estimate that , for a country receiving $20 million in aid from the EU, a $5 million increase causes a 0.40 increase on the CIRI Human Empowerment Index, with a 95% CI of [0.01, 0.80] . (TRJPS105) 2) The respondents' expressions of their own positions on each roll-call vote allow us to estimate the average number of bills on which they take a liberal or conservative position .(TRJPS22)
It is not uncommon that a lexical bundle has more than one function (e.g., Biber et al. 2004 ; Cortes 2015 ). It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to assign a specific function to each one of the instances, given their sheer number. We therefore decided to follow previous studies such as Chen and Baker (2010) and Ädel and Erman (2012) in assigning one function (the main function as identified in the concordance) to each bundle type. Some clausal fragments and incomplete verb phrases without a clear function, such as that it is, has been the, and do not, were put under an additional category (‘indeterminate’).
The initial inter-rater agreement rate was 78%, which was then improved to 100% through subsequent discussions and close contextual analyses of concordance lines in question.

Section: 4. Results and discussion

This section is divided into three parts. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 present the quantitative results regarding the frequencies of lexical bundles in the two corpora as well as the distribution of different forms and functions. Section 4.3 complements the quantitative results with an in-depth analysis of some of the most frequent bundles in each corpus. Section 4.4 discusses in-text variation in the two corpora.
Table 4 presents both raw token frequencies of the lexical bundles retrieved and sifted through. We also include type frequencies to give a sense of the range of bundles involved in each corpus. Table 4 . Type and token frequencies of lexical bundles in the two corpora. Empty Cell TRJPS PJPS Empty Cell No. of bundles (tokens) No. of bundles (types) TRJPS 44,849 1,326 PJPS 28,366 1,047
The log-likelihood test was conducted for the token frequencies and the two corpora were found to be statistically different (LL=85.38, p < 0.0001). Simply put, the TRJPS articles employed more lexical bundles than the PJPS ones. This result seems to be consistent with a general observation made in the literature despite different methodological approaches, namely that formulaicity is often associated with more successful or expert writing (e.g., Cortes 2004 ; Hyland 2008b ; Pérez-Llantada 2014 ; Wang, 2018 ). However, the comparison based on the overall numbers of bundles should be treated with great caution as the results can be influenced by many factors including different corpus sizes as well as the lengths and topical diversity of individual texts (e.g., Bestgen 2017 , 2020; Pan et al. 2020 ). Therefore, it would be too hasty to draw any conclusion about the differences or commonalities between the two corpora without an in-depth investigation of what types of bundles were used by the two sets of writers and how.
Table 5 presents the distribution of lexical bundles of different syntactic structures across the two corpora and Table 6 the functional distribution. Unlike Table 5 , which is based on tokens, Table 6 reports type frequencies. This is because we only assigned one function for each bundle type, although some bundles may have more than one function. Assigning the same function to all the instances of a single bundle would therefore have inflated certain functions. Table 5 . Structural distribution (Tokens) with standardised residuals ( R ).

As can be seen in Table 5 , about 60 per cent of all the bundles retrieved from the TRJPS corpus are NPs and PPs, corroborating Biber et al.’s (1999) finding about academic prose in general. These two structural types also dominate the 3- to 5-word bundles in the PJPS corpus, but with an even higher percentage (close to 70). The results of the Chi-square test show that the distribution of the structural types between the corpora is statistically different ( p <0.001) 2 , contributed mainly by PPs and VPs. That is to say, the main difference between the two corpora in the distribution of the major syntactic forms lies in the higher proportion of PPs in PJPS as well as that of VPs in TRJPS.
In terms of functional distribution, as Table 6 shows, the significant difference between the two corpora ( p < 0.001) is contributed mainly by the categories of time/place/personal references (R1) and transition signals (T1), which stand out in the PJPS corpus, with the cells’ observed frequencies being greater than expected frequencies. The top-ranking counterpart, by contrast, features bundles of two other research-oriented categories: research procedure or terminology (R3) and explanation or reasoning (R4), as well as structuring signals (T2) and stance markers (P1). These categories, together with the main structural forms that stand out in comparison as summarised above, will be discussed in more detail in the next section in association with the most frequent lexical bundles occurring in the data.

Out of the most frequent 50 lexical bundles in each corpus, 20 are shared by both. Most of these bundles (e.g., in terms of, on the other hand, the fact that, as a result, as well as ) are frequent in other academic disciplines (see, for instance, Hyland 2008a ; Durrant 2017 ). Those that occur exclusively on the PJPS list contain more items that can also be found on Durrant's (2017) list of bundles distinctive of Humanities and Social Sciences in general: part of the, the concept of, the process of, it is not, the importance of, the basis of, the form of . The high frequency of such bundles suggests that the PJPS articles are also highly formulaic, in the sense of general academic language use in Humanities and Social Sciences. Note that Durrant's study is based on university students’ writing, which, as Wang, 2018 notes, represents a more interpretative (argumentative) and less empiricist or discipline-specific genre than that of published research articles. The commonalities between the frequent lexical bundles occurring in the PJPS articles and those in Durrant's data may be taken as reflecting a resemblance between the two in terms of either level or genre, or both. Those that occur particularly frequently in PJPS feature PPs and R1 (time/place/personal reference) bundles such as of the state, of the united, of the world, in the world, the US and, the middle east , and the united nations. As Soler and Wang, 2019 discuss, while issues related to the USA are at the centre of attention for the top-ranking journal articles, the PJPS articles cover a range of target countries and areas. Some of these places are multi-word units, hence the high frequency of bundles such as the middle east and the united nations.
The frequent occurrence of bundles such as of the world, in the world as well as of the political, political and economic, and the development of suggests the use of rather general or sweeping statements in the argumentation. Take the bundle the development of as an example. First of all, it occurs more frequently in the predatory journal articles than in the top-ranking counterparts (108 vs. 28 instances). In addition, the bundle is followed by a wide range of NPs in PJPS such as philosophy, state, strategy, politics, ideology, communities, belief gaps, policy, potential, human rights, technology, judgement . No clear collocational pattern can be discerned; rather it seems to be an all-purpose expression with no clear or specific meaning. In Examples (3) and (4), for instance, what the development of does is to state a general idea, leaving the precise meaning to the reader's interpretation. We have no clear idea what exactly about the private sector or the discipline gets developed. In Example (5), the meaning of the development of overlaps with that of increase and could be considered redundant. 3) Following many years of economic crisis, the post 1978 open-door policy has opened spaces for market actors and fuelled the development of the private sector. The private sector has quickly developed in China. The unleashing of market forces has led to unprecedented period of economic growth which has in turn boosted the legitimacy of the government. (PJPS28) 4) The story of IR has always been narrated in terms of a series of great debates – debates through which all analysts and scholars have explained the development of the discipline. (PJPS76) 5) Meanwhile, as the development of the Middle Eastern concessions increased, the United States oil production began to decrease in ratio to its increased consumption. (PJPS09)
In the TRJPS corpus, the same bundle is followed most often (11 out of 28) by NPs entailing research methods as in Example (6). Similar noun collocates include analogues, estimation, techniques, measures, and framework . Otherwise, what follows tends to be more specific, such as one specific aspect of political tolerance ( the democratic value ) in Example (7), followed by a quote explaining what the development of the democratic value refers to 6) Unique features of Early Day Motions, however, have inhibited the development of methods using EDMs to estimate legislator positions along the conventional left-right dimension of British politics. (TRJPS85) 7) For example, Duch and Gibson argue that antidemocratic ideas may not signal danger to the development of the democratic value of political tolerance: “political tolerance seems to be facilitated where citizens are exposed to a wide range of political ideas – even seemingly antidemocratic ideas – and where these ideas are accorded legitimacy by at least some segments of the population” (1992, 267). (TRJPS50)
Those that occur exclusively on the TRJPS list in Table 7 , by contrast, have little in common with Durrant's (2017) findings about university student writing or Hyland's (2008a: 12, Table 6 ) lists of frequent bundles in four other disciplines (Biology, Electrical Engineering, Applied Linguistics , Business Studies). The following, in particular, stand out in the discipline of political science when compared with the results of Durrant (2017) and Hyland (2008a) : those that involve likely ( more likely to, are more likely, are more likely to, likely to be, less likely to, are likely to ), the effect(s) of, the dependent variable, the status quo, roll call votes. Such bundles also contribute to the prevalence of the functions of R3 (research procedure/topic) and P1 (stance markers) in the TRJPS corpus. Examples (8)-(12) illustrate the use of bundles involving likely in the TRJPS corpus. Variable forms of ( be ) ( more/less ) likely ( to / than ) are used to hedge all kinds of propositions, including the author's own interpretation of the results (8), hypotheses (9, 10), and previous findings (11, 12). 8) Our results show that those who were marginally ineligible are more likely to vote in subsequent elections than marginal eligibles. (TRJPS01) 9) If we know that the legislator agrees with her party, we expect her to be more likely to cast a vote. (TRJPS06) 10) Following Gupta and Newberry, we assume that most of the variation in effective tax rates caused by characteristics like the extent of foreign operations or natural resource involvement is absorbed by firm - fixed effects , since those variables are likely to be persistent. (TRJPS57) 11) Where party labels are comparatively less important for elections, parties are less likely to have written rules regarding the delegation of speaking time. (TRJPS07) 12) Sniderman and Carmines have not tested ideological differences in the underpinnings of racial resentment, but they do find that liberals are more likely than conservatives to oppose racial policies on prejudicial grounds. (TRJPS38)
The frequent use of we find that as in Example (13), together with a range of other bundles in the TRJPS corpus (e.g., we show that, we would expect, we argue that, we expect that ), also contributes to the high proportion of P1 bundles featuring the top-ranking journal articles. 13) Third, we find that participation in institutions in one issue area can have effects in another. (TRJPS52)
The use of the first person pronoun we can also be found in R3 bundles: we focus on, we use the, we control for, and we estimate the. Apart from the pronoun we , what these bundles have in common is the use of the simple present tense and the active voice. As mentioned in Section 3 , the top-ranking journal has more co-authored articles than single-authored ones (65 vs. 36). In a way, this could have contributed to the frequent occurrence of we- bundles in the TRJPS corpus. However, not only are we- bundles rarely seen in the PJPS corpus 3 , but the list of retrieved bundles contains no single item with the first-person singular pronoun I . Therefore, the number of authors seems an irrelevant factor in explaining the difference between the two corpora in this respect.
Rather, it seems that the writers contributing to the PJPS corpus preferred other usage patterns. Take the word find; when it is associated with the function of reporting results, it occurs more often in the passive voice and mixed tenses, as in Examples (14)-(16). 14) Considering that the participants for this study represented a cross section of the Nigerian civil society, it is pertinent to note that what was found in this study tells more about the Nigerian political system. (PJPS59) 15) If one employs the Alford class voting index, the same trend is found , as class voting is down from 58 to –4 in Denmark,… (PJPS110) 16) In the March wave of the survey, partial support was found for H3a, as liberal blog-reading predicted both traditional and online political activities (ß = .19, p < .001; ß = .24, p < .001, respectively);… (PJPS64)
The wide variety of usage patterns makes a marked contrast with the formulaic pattern we find that in the TRJPS corpus. Admittedly, as different journals may have different stylistic guidelines as regards the choice of tense and voice, the seemingly regular usage pattern as observed in the TRJPS corpus may simply be a result of the journal's style guide. In that sense, the lack of such a pattern in the predatory journal articles may not necessarily mean insufficient experience or unawareness of disciplinary conventions on the writers’ part, but rather the lack of relevant requirements from the journal. However, according to our expert informants, that is unlikely to be the case. They recognised the usage pattern in the TRJPS articles and interpreted it as a way for authors in their field to take responsibility for what they write and claim. While this may well be a convention that is specific to the discipline, which the authors of the PJPS articles seemed not fully aware of, more journals need to be involved in future research to substantiate or refute the claim.
Finally, an additional set of bundles that stands out in the TRJPS corpus, represented by in this article and in the first , is associated with text-structuring signals (T2). As Examples (17) and (18) illustrate, the authors contributing to the top-ranking journal seemed to be fond of using such locational metatext, providing navigation signals in their communication with the reader. 17) In this article we have undertaken the first comprehensive cross-national study of variations in personal vote-earning attributes (PVEA). (TRJPS42) 18) Turning to state enforcement of the CWA, again of primary interest are the coefficients on the strategic interaction terms, which are presented in the first row of Table 3 . (TRJPS56)
Other examples include of this article, in this section, as shown in, in the appendix, in the next/previous section, to the left/right of, in the top, the remainder of, is as follows, as noted above .
The most frequent lexical bundles across the main sections of the research article (Abstract, Introduction, Background, Methods, Results and Discussion, Conclusion) can be found in Appendixes I - VI . As the sections are fairly small after division and differ greatly from each other in size, the following observations were made based on those lists rather than statistical comparison across the sections and the corpora, which would require much more data. Nevertheless, the lists of most frequent bundles identified in the individual sections did point to some differences between the two corpora in terms of in-text variation that are worth further exploration in future research. In what follows, we summarise our observations.
In terms of lexical bundle types, there appears to be less variation across the sections of the PJPS articles. A set of common-core bundles can be seen in almost all the sections: as well as, in order to, as a result, the fact that, in terms of, such as the, based on the . In addition, there are in other words, due to the, at the same time, the concept of which occur in at least three of the sections.
In the TRJPS corpus, only more likely to, the effect(s) of and the united states occur frequently in all the sections. At the same time, each section contains a number of bundles that appear to be specific to that section. For instance, the Introduction section features textual signals such as in this article as well as stance markers involving self-mention: we show that, we find that, we argue that , suggesting that it is not uncommon for the author to present the main finding(s) or argument(s) already in the Introduction, as in Example (19). 19) In both approaches, we find that preregistration has positive and significant effects on young voters’ participation rates. (TRJPS01)
Such a tendency cannot be observed, at least not through lexical bundles, in the introductions of the PJPS articles. Instead, it is more common for the authors to formulate the purpose of the study in this section. In addition, expressions such as this paper or this article tend to be used instead of we .
The Background section in the TRJPS articles highlights various forms of likely: more likely to, likely to be, are more likely, are likely to, are more likely to, less likely to, is likely to, the likelihood of, be more likely to , suggesting a rather tentative nature in the discussion of the literature . No bundles really stand out as specific to this section in the PJPS corpus.
The Methods section in the TRJPS corpus, again, yielded a large number of section-specific bundles, particularly VPs or clausal fragments to do with research procedure or presupposition : to control for, to account for, to estimate the, to test the, we use the, we assume that. In comparison, very few bundles of the same function can be found in the PJPS counterpart (e.g., used in this, respondents were asked, to measure the ) .
The Results section in the TRJPS articles contains more research-related terminology (e.g., the dependent variable, standard errors in parentheses, robust standard errors, the co-efficient on, in the model ) and evaluative expressions (e.g., consistent with the, support for the, and statistically significant ). Again, no section-specific bundles were found in the PJPS counterpart.
Bundles involving self-mention occur frequently again in the Conclusions of the TRJPS articles: in this article, our understanding of, of this article, of this study, our results suggest that . As Examples (20) and (21) show, the bundle of this article is often associated with a reiteration of the purpose of the study in the conclusion. When the word article is replaced by study as in Examples (22) and (23), it is commonly used with the results of the given study, followed by a sort of evaluation, or its scope in relation to the limitation of the study. The bundle our understanding of , as in Example (24), is typically used in connection with the contribution of the study. The first person pronoun our in this case also serves to engage the reader. 20) The main purpose of this article has been to show that convergence need not be expected in party competition. (TRJPS16) 21) The second major focus of this article was the design of international agreements when incentives to lie complicate cooperation. (TRJPS49) 22) The results of this study are also interesting when considered in light of recent evidence of the ideological basis of decision making by European constitutional courts... (TRJPS100) 23) These questions are beyond the scope of this study , but they point to the variety of implications of our model. (TRJPS07) 24) Although we believe our experimental results contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of public opinion about foreign affairs, they are also open to a number of potential critiques suggesting directions for future research. (TRJPS108)
The above bundles are all absent on the corresponding PJPS list, which features another set of stance markers instead: the most important, the importance of, it would be, it can be, it is possible, seem to be, it is necessary to, need to be, the need for. 25) I came to the conclusion that the degree of ethnic heterogeneity is by far the most important explanatory variable. (PJPS70) 26) So, to understand how xenophobia affects redistribution, it is necessary to explore on which beliefs xenophobia is based . (PJPS86) 27) Islamic Revolution Foundation, …., and holy shrines are the most important centers of economic power in the country that are active in order to protect economic discipline and help the legitimacy of the system. (PJPS41) 28) The most important areas that the Security Council develop international peace and security during the Cold War and the beginning of the millennium were human rights and humanitarian violations, terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and environmental issues . (PJPS23)
As Examples (25) and (26) show, the importance of the findings in the PJPS articles was often formulated rather directly and forcefully by the use of bundles such as the most important and it is necessary to. Such statements of importance could also be found in the conclusions of the TRJPS articles, of course, but the idea seemed to be often packaged in a more subtle or varied way as demonstrated by the use of expressions such as interesting, implications, contribute to in Examples (22)-(24). Examples (27) and (28) show that it is not only the importance of the findings of the study that is emphasised in the conclusions of the PJPS articles; quite often we can also see a general statement of the importance of the research territory , mirroring a step that is commonly taken in the introduction of the research article ( Swales 1990 ).

Section: 4. Conclusion

In this study, we set out to investigate what lexical bundles can inform us of disciplinary writing in two distinct journals in the field of political science (one predatory, one top-ranking). To recapitulate, we can say that, first of all, the articles in both corpora are formulaic to a great extent, but there are some differences in the types of bundles used. We acknowledge that the quantitative comparisons between the two corpora may have been affected by a range of factors such as the different sizes of the corpora involved. In order to be comparable with previous research, we opted for the conventional way of using the log-likelihood and Chi-square tests for analysing frequencies. However, as Bestgen (2020) suggests, there are issues with comparing lexical bundles across corpora of different sizes and more research is needed before we can obtain an accurate picture.
That said, we also want to emphasise that most of our findings are based on an qualitative analysis of individual lexical bundles with a relatively high frequency as well as wide distribution in each corpus. What is particularly noteworthy about the top-ranking journal articles is that even those that are semantically transparent and syntactically flexible expressions seem to have their more or less uniform usage patterns. The authors’ preference of such patterns may be taken as indicating the highly formulaic nature of the given genre, corroborating other studies such as Pérez-Llantada (2014) and Wang, 2018 . Admittedly, the choice of tense and voice in those patterns could be a result of the stylistic guidelines of the journal involved. Although our expert informants were doubtful about that possibility, more journals (both predatory and more prestigious ones) need to be involved in future research to substantiate or refute the claim that the usage patterns of those semantically and syntactically ‘regular’ expressions do reflect disciplinary conventions and can help distinguish more experienced writers from those who are probably yet to be fully socialised into the community.
In addition, other findings from our study point more clearly to differences in terms of scientific information of the articles as well as the level of scientific literacy of the authors. For instance, the articles in the top-ranking journal feature in particular lexical bundles associated with stance making, demonstrating an element of evaluative criticism, which is either lacking or manifested in less formulaic ways in the predatory journal articles. In contrast, bundles related to time/place/personal reference, often in the form of PPs, stand out in the latter, reflecting a wide variety of target areas covered in the research. The top-ranking journal articles also see more disciplinary-specific bundles associated with research procedure and logical reasoning in particular. All these differences seem to suggest either the research article genre is less rigid in the predatory journal, in the sense of a general lack of attention to methodological issues, or the scientific quality is somewhat lacking in the research reported in its articles. Finally, although our study is essentially exploratory in nature, we can see clear differences across sections regarding the choice of lexical bundles in the top-ranking journal articles, which in turn seems to be associated with different purposes and functions of the individual sections, some of which are likely to be discipline-specific, such as presenting the research findings in the introduction and a tendency to hedge heavily when discussing the literature. Again, such in-text variation seems to be missing in the predatory journal articles, which yielded more common-core lexical bundles used indiscriminately across all the sections.
The above is particularly relevant in light of current discussions on predatory publishing. Indeed, it has been reported that the lack of quality (or at least the thin quality) of the papers published in predatory journals is often one defining trait of this kind of publishing ( Eriksson and Helgesson 2017 : 164-165; see also Xia 2014 ). Previous research focusing on the (lack of) quality in predatory publishing has tended to concentrate on the poor rigor of the peer-review process in this kind of outlets (e.g. Oermann et al. 2018). And while it has also been noted that more work is needed that examines in more detail the degree to which articles in predatory journals contain scientific information, as well as the level of scientific literacy of authors publishing in them ( Ezinwa Nwagwu and Ojemeni 2015 : 23), few studies so far have gone down to analyse the linguistic levels of work published in predatory journals.
We would argue that the present study begins to address that gap, showing that lexical bundles can be rather revealing about the amount of scientific information articles in predatory journals include, as well as the level of scientific literacy of authors who submit and publish their work in such journals. In particular, the comparative approach taken here allows us to point to features of formulaicity concerning, for instance, those less salient formulaic expressions, disciplinary practices, and in-text variation, which help distinguish research articles published in different outlets that, in this case, lie at the two ends of status spectrum. Predatory publishing is a complex phenomenon and, as such, we hope for future work to continue paying attention to it from a range of complementary angles, including textual-linguistic and socio-material, as we do believe this complementarity is key in understanding the complexity of this phenomenon .
