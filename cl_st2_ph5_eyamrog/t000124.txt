Section: Abstract

The centromere represents a single region in most eukaryotic chromosomes. However, several plant and animal lineages assemble holocentromeres along the entire chromosome length. Here, we compare genome organization and evolution as a function of centromere type by assembling chromosome-scale holocentric genomes with repeat-based holocentromeres from three beak-sedge ( Rhynchospora pubera , R. breviuscula , and R. tenuis ) and their closest monocentric relative, Juncus effusus . We demonstrate that transition to holocentricity affected 3D genome architecture by redefining genomic compartments, while distributing centromere function to thousands of repeat-based centromere units genome-wide. We uncover a complex genome organization in R. pubera that hides its unexpected octoploidy and describe a marked reduction in chromosome number for R. tenuis , which has only two chromosomes. We show that chromosome fusions, facilitated by repeat-based holocentromeres, promoted karyotype evolution and diploidization. Our study thus sheds light on several important aspects of genome architecture and evolution influenced by centromere organization.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Most eukaryotes are monocentric, meaning that their centromeres are restricted to single regions on each chromosome. These centromeric regions can range from kilobases (kbs) to megabases (Mbs) in length and comprise often specific repeats ( Gohard et al., 2014 28. Gohard, F.H. ∙ Zhiteneva, A.A. ∙ Earnshaw, W.C. Centromeres eLS, 2014 Chichester https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/9780470015902.a0005785.pub2 Crossref Google Scholar ). Holocentromeres, by contrast, consist of multiple centromeric units distributed along the poleward surface of metaphase chromosomes, extending from one telomere to the other, and are thus typically visible as a line on each chromatid ( Heckmann et al., 2013 37.

Holocentromeres are dispersed point centromeres localized at transcription factor hotspots eLife. 2014; 3 :e02025 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Holocentromeres are hypothesized to stabilize chromosomal fragments and fusions that favor karyotype rearrangements and speciation ( Mandrioli and Manicardi, 2020 57. Mandrioli, M. ∙ Manicardi, G.C. Holocentric chromosomes PLOS Genet. 2020; 16 :e1008918 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), directly influencing chromosome evolution ( Schubert and Lysak, 2011 85. Schubert, I. ∙ Lysak, M.A. Interpretation of karyotype evolution should consider chromosome structural constraints Trends Genet. 2011; 27 :207-216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that holocentromeres have evolved independently several times in different plant and animal lineages ( Escudero et al., 2016 21.

Aside from their function in cell division, centromeres have an evolutionarily conserved role in determining large-scale genome architecture and chromatin composition ( Muller et al., 2019 66. Muller, H. ∙ Gil, Jr., J. ∙ Drinnenberg, I.A. The impact of centromeres on spatial genome architecture Trends Genet. 2019; 35 :565-578 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Centromeres in monocentric chromosomes influence the distribution of genes, euchromatin- and heterochromatin-specific post-translational histone modification domains, transposable elements (TEs), and meiotic crossovers ( Fernandes et al., 2019 23.

However, genome organization and chromatin composition of organisms with holocentric chromosomes is poorly understood, and it is likely that holocentric species differ markedly from the monocentric paradigm.
The beak-sedge Rhynchospora pubera (Cyperaceae, sedges) has repeat-based holocentromeres ( Marques et al., 2015 59. Marques, A. ∙ Ribeiro, T. ∙ Neumann, P. ... Holocentromeres in Rhynchospora are associated with genome-wide centromere-specific repeat arrays interspersed among euchromatin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :13633-13638 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), as do other species from the same genus ( Costa et al., 2021 14. Costa, L. ∙ Marques, A. ∙ Buddenhagen, C. ... Aiming off the target: recycling target capture sequencing reads for investigating repetitive DNA Ann. Bot. 2021; 128 :835-848 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ribeiro et al., 2017 81.

Centromeric and non-centromeric satellite DNA organisation differs in holocentric Rhynchospora species Chromosoma. 2017; 126 :325-335 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). R. pubera holocentromeres are associated with a single tandem-repeat family (the centromeric 172-bp unit Tyba repeat) and the centromeric retrotransposon of Rhynchospora ( CRRh ), giving rise to thousands of small centromere units across the genome ( Marques et al., 2015 59. Marques, A. ∙ Ribeiro, T. ∙ Neumann, P. ... Holocentromeres in Rhynchospora are associated with genome-wide centromere-specific repeat arrays interspersed among euchromatin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :13633-13638 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lack of a Rhynchospora reference genome has, however, hampered detailed studies about its intriguing centromere organization.
Here, we combined genomic and chromatin analyses to elucidate genomic adaptations related to different centromere organizations. We report the full characterization of a holocentric genome containing thousands of repeat-based centromere units. We show that this centromere organization influences the 3D genome architecture by redefining the extent of genomic compartments due to the lack of centromere clustering. Strikingly, despite substantial genome restructuring, the epigenetic regulation of centromere units in beak-sedges resembles that of monocentric centromeres, as in Arabidopsis thaliana ( Naish et al., 2021 69. Naish, M. ∙ Alonge, M. ∙ Wlodzimierz, P. ... The genetic and epigenetic landscape of the Arabidopsis centromeres Science. 2021; 374 :eabi7489 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation suggests evolutionarily conserved epigenetic regulation of repeat-based centromeres in both monocentric and holocentric organisms. We further reveal that chromosome fusions facilitated by repeat-based holocentromeres reduce chromosome number and can act as an alternative to diploidization after genome doubling without the need for genome downsizing. Our work sheds light on the role of centromeres in overall genome organization and chromosome evolution.

Section: Results

To identify the genomic adaptations related to the transition to holocentricity, we constructed chromosome-scale reference genomes using PacBio HiFi sequencing and Dovetail Omni-C (DNase-based Hi-C) for three holocentric Rhynchospora species, R. pubera (n = 5; haploid nuclear genome size [1C] = 1.61 Gb), R. breviuscula (n = 5; 1C = 415 Mb), and R. tenuis (a plant with the fewest known chromosomes; n = 2; 1C = 394 Mb) ( Castiglione and Cremonini, 2012 9. Castiglione, M.R. ∙ Cremonini, R. A fascinating island: 2n=4 Plant Biosyst. 2012; 146 :711-726 Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar ; Vanzela et al., 1996 98. Vanzela, A.L.L. ∙ Guerra, M. ∙ Luceño, M. Rhynchospora tenuis Link (Cyperaceae), a species with the lowest number of holocentric chromosomes Cytobios. 1996; 88 :219-228 Google Scholar ), as well as their closest monocentric relative, the rush J. effusus (n = 21; 1C = 271 Mb) ( Guerra et al., 2019 32. Guerra, M. ∙ Ribeiro, T. ∙ Felix, L.P. Monocentric chromosomes in Juncus (Juncaceae) and implications for the chromosome evolution of the family Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 2019; 191 :475-483 Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar ; ( Figures 1 , 2 , S1 A, and S1B; Table S1 ; STAR Methods ).
J. effusus showed a typical monocentric configuration of chromatin interaction within A (euchromatin) and B (heterochromatin) compartments, including some degree of a telomere-to-centromere axis ( Figures 2 A and 2B; see Hoencamp et al., 2021 39. Hoencamp, C. ∙ Dudchenko, O. ∙ Elbatsh, A.M.O. ... 3D genomics across the tree of life reveals condensin II as a determinant of architecture type Science. 2021; 372 :984-989 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The concept of chromosome arms does not apply to holocentric species, as centromeres are ubiquitous. Consequently, we observed no large-scale compartmentalization or telomere-to-centromere axes, as evidenced by the chromatin configuration capture (Hi-C) contact matrices of our three Rhynchospora species ( Figures 2 C, 2D, S1 A, and S1B). Further quantification of intrachromosomal ( cis ) and interchromosomal ( trans ) chromatin contacts revealed a significantly higher ratio (p < 4.04e−05) of cis versus trans interactions in all Rhynchospora species compared with the monocentric J. effusus ( Figure S1 C). Thus, holocentric beak-sedges are characterized by higher intrachromosomal spatial genome organization and lack of centromere clustering.
The distribution of genomic features differed markedly between holocentric Rhynchospora and monocentric J. effusus ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Rhynchospora had a uniform distribution of genes, transcriptional activity, Tyba centromeric repeats, TEs, and DNA methylation ( Figures 2 F, S1 D, and S1E). By contrast, J. effusus genes were concentrated toward telomeric regions, while TEs and tandem repeats clustered toward centromeric regions ( Figure 2 E). Genome-wide gene distribution and transcriptional activity were positively correlated, while repeat distribution was positively correlated with overall DNA methylation levels ( Figure 2 E). Genome-wide CpG methylation (mCpG) was lower in R. pubera than in J. effusus , whereas CHG methylation was higher and CHH methylation was the same in both species ( Figures S1 F and S1G). Thus, transition to holocentricity likely affects 3D genome architecture by redefining the extents of genomic compartments and their relationships to each other.
We analyzed the sequence organization and chromatin structure of the Rhynchospora repeat-based holocentromeres. The contiguity of our assemblies, coupled with the short array size of centromeric Tyba repeats, allowed us to resolve mostly complete Tyba arrays in the three Rhynchospora genomes. While total number and amount of Tyba arrays increased with chromosome size ( Figures 3 A and 3B), the density of arrays decreased ( Figure 3 C). Average array sizes of 20.3, 20.5, and 19.8 kb, and average spacing between two consecutive arrays of 368, 492, and 424 kb were found in R. breviuscula , R. pubera , and R. tenuis , respectively ( Figures 3 D and 3E). These results confirm a similar overall organization of centromeric Tyba repeats among the three Rhynchospora species. In common with monocentric centromeric repeats ( Kasinathan and Henikoff, 2018 41. Kasinathan, S. ∙ Henikoff, S. Non-B-form DNA is enriched at centromeres Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35 :949-962 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also found a high frequency of dyad symmetries in the Tyba consensus sequences of all three Rhynchospora species ( Figure 3 F).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) confirmed the highest enrichment of centromeric histone H3 (CENH3) for the Tyba repeats and lower enrichment for CRRh throughout the entire R. pubera and R. breviuscula genomes ( Figures 4 A–4C and S1 H; Table S2 ). We detected 2,753 and 995 CENH3-binding regions (hereafter CENH3 domains) evenly distributed across the five chromosomes of R. pubera and R. breviuscula , respectively. In both species, length, density, and spacing of CENH3 domains followed a similar pattern to the number of Tyba arrays detected ( Figures 3 A–3E). Considering that one CENH3 domain is equivalent to one centromere unit, on average, each R. pubera chromosome carried 600 centromere units (1.88 domains/Mb), while the smaller chromosomes of R. breviuscula carried 200 centromere units each on average (2.69 domains/Mb) ( Figures 3 A–3C). Thus, genome/chromosome size may be negatively correlated with centromere unit density in beak-sedges. Genome-wide there was a significant association between CENH3 domains and Tyba repeats for both species (p < 0.05), confirming that Tyba repeats are the main CENH3-binding sites. Therefore, repeat-based holocentromeres are likely to be conserved and associated with Tyba repeats in beak-sedges.
In the monocentric J. effusus , the histone mark H3K4me3, which is euchromatin specific, showed dispersed labeling along chromosome arms, while H3K9me2 (heterochromatin specific) was concentrated at pericentromeric regions and co-localized with chromocenters in interphase ( Figure S1 I). By contrast, in the holocentric R. pubera , both euchromatin- and heterochromatin-specific histone marks were intermingled all along the chromosomes with a constant density even toward the subtelomeric and central chromosomal regions ( Figures 4 A–4C). Locally, H3K4me3 was mostly highly enriched at the promoter regions of protein-coding genes, whereas H3K9me2 was enriched on small heterochromatic islands, typically resembling TEs ( Figure 4 C). H3K4me3 was depleted at CENH3 domains, while H3K9me2 showed residual enrichment. We noticed a slight increase in H3K9me2 enrichment flanking CENH3 domains relative to the core region, mimicking the pericentromeric chromatin composition in monocentromeres ( Figure 4 C).
Irrespective of centromere type, gene bodies were highly enriched for mCpG in both R. pubera and J. effusus , with a sharp decrease at promoters and terminal regions. Methylation in the CHH and CHG contexts was much lower for the gene bodies than for intergenic regions ( Figures 4 D and 4E), as previously reported for other plants ( Feng et al., 2020 22. Feng, S. ∙ Zhong, Z. ∙ Wang, M. ... Efficient and accurate determination of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana with enzymatic methyl sequencing Epigenetics Chromatin. 2020; 13 :42 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, despite the differences in chromosome organization, both the Tyba repeats in R. pubera and tandem repeats in centromeric regions of J. effusus chromosomes were highly enriched for mCpG at levels similar to those for TEs ( Figures 4 D and 4E). mCHG was sharply enriched flanking CENH3-binding regions in R. pubera , resembling the H3K9me2 pattern ( Figure 4 C). We obtained a similar pattern for mCHG at centromeric repeats in J. effusus ( Figures 2 D, 4 D, and 4E). TEs showed the highest enrichment for mCHG and mCHH, while Tyba repeats displayed lower levels of mCHH, similar to genes ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Our results argue for the presence of a pericentromere-like chromatin state around the ends of centromere units in Rhynchospora that may mark the borders for CENH3 loading.
A typical centromere unit in R. pubera comprised a single Tyba array surrounded by genes and TEs ( Figure 4 F). We detected CENH3 domains all along the chromosomes, even in Tyba arrays located near telomeres like those at both ends of R. pubera chromosome 2 ( Rp Chr2) ( Figures 4 F and 4G), confirming the telomere-to-telomere centromere activity of holocentric chromosomes. Notably, we observed an enrichment for H3K4me3 and actively transcribed genes close to centromere units, with an average distance of 6.3 kb ( Figures 4 H and 4I). We identified 313 genes that showed at least a 1-base-pair (bp) overlap with CENH3 domains. We even detected actively transcribed genes with typical H3K4me3 enrichment inside CENH3 domains ( Figure 4 H), a characteristic only rarely observed in monocentric organisms ( Mizuno et al., 2011 65. Mizuno, H. ∙ Kawahara, Y. ∙ Wu, J. ... Asymmetric distribution of gene expression in the centromeric region of rice chromosome 5 Front. Plant Sci. 2011; 2 :16 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schotanus et al., 2021 84. Schotanus, K. ∙ Yadav, V. ∙ Heitman, J. Epigenetic dynamics of centromeres and neocentromeres in Cryptococcus deuterogattii PLoS Genet. 2021; 17 :e1009743 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both CENH3 association and transcription were frequently reduced in genic regions inserted into centromere units, compared with genic regions residing outside the core centromere unit ( Figure 4 H), reflecting the precise regulation of chromatin composition of the R. pubera genome. CRRh was frequently inserted into Tyba arrays enriched for CENH3, but also H3K9me2 and some level of H3K4me3, suggesting a different epigenetic regulation of this retroelement compared with Tyba repeats ( Figure 4 I). Our results thus point to fine-scale epigenetic regulation of genomes with repeat-based holocentromeres.
Tyba repeats in R. pubera can be flanked by TCR1 and TCR2 repeats, suggesting that some Tyba arrays are part of larger repetitive elements ( Marques et al., 2015 59. Marques, A. ∙ Ribeiro, T. ∙ Neumann, P. ... Holocentromeres in Rhynchospora are associated with genome-wide centromere-specific repeat arrays interspersed among euchromatin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :13633-13638 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). The consensus full-length TCR1 element contained a Tyba array with a 5′ sequence of approximately 4.8-kb and a 136-bp 3′ sequence. The element possessed no open reading frame (ORF) and lacked terminal repeats, and its 5′ and 3′ ends harbored the ATC and CTAGT sequence motifs, respectively, suggesting that TCR1 is a nonautonomous Helitron TE ( Thomas and Pritham, 2015 97. Thomas, J. ∙ Pritham, E.J. Helitrons, the eukaryotic rolling-circle transposable elements Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), from the same family as a fully autonomous Helitron element ( Helitron-27 ) in the R. pubera genome. Despite sharing conserved terminal sequences, TCR1 and Helitron-27 exhibited no similarities in their internal regions. We identified three intact copies of the autonomous Helitron-27 in the genome with high mutual similarity ( Table S3 ), each encoding a full Helitron helicase (1,340 amino acids), indicating that TCR1 and Helitron-27 elements are still capable of transposition. We further identified an additional 322 full-length elements ( Table S3 ) with both TCR1 termini as well as Tyba and another 146 partial elements with the 3′-terminal sequence and containing Tyba within the upstream 500-bp region. We conclude that at least 468 Tyba -containing loci in the genome resulted from the transposition activity of TCR1 elements. The full-length TCR1 sequences were 6.9–49.6 kb (24.8 kb average), containing 1.2–31.3 kb from Tyba (15.7 kb average). In many TCR1 elements, Tyba arrays were split into multiple segments due to insertions of other sequences, showing that multiple Tyba loci can originate from a single TCR1 insertion ( Figures 4 J and 4K). Importantly, a comparison of TCR1 and CENH3 domains revealed that the vast majority (98.7%) of full-length TCR1 elements are embedded within or overlap with the centromere units ( Table S2 ).
Helitron s with boundaries similar to TCR1 / Helitron-27 were present in R. tenuis and R. breviuscula ; however, all but one of the full-length elements in these two genomes lacked Tyba . The sole exception was a single element from R. breviuscula (Chr1:69162288–69195619) with 5′ and 3′ boundary sequences characteristic of this Helitron family as well as a Tyba array; however, the remaining sections lacked any similarity to the TCR1 of R. pubera . These results suggest that Tyba was amplified as a part of a TCR1 Helitron only in the genome of R. pubera .
The TCR2 element was found to be a miniature inverted-repeat TE (MITE) and ranged from 672 to 1,235 bp, likely originated from the DNA transposon MuDR with shared similarity (up to 97%) in the terminal inverted repeats. All 158 full-length TCR2 elements identified in the R. pubera genome were in Tyba arrays, but none were characterized by Tyba insertions. Thus, TCR2 elements did not contribute to the dispersal of Tyba in the R. pubera genome.
The R. pubera genome is 4 times larger than that of its closely related species, despite sharing the same ancestral chromosome number (ACN) ( x = 5) ( Burchardt et al., 2020 4. Burchardt, P. ∙ Buddenhagen, C.E. ∙ Gaeta, M.L. ... Holocentric karyotype evolution in Rhynchospora is marked by intense numerical, structural, and genome size changes Front. Plant Sci. 2020; 11 :536507 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ribeiro et al., 2018 80. Ribeiro, T. ∙ Buddenhagen, C.E. ∙ Thomas, W.W. ... Are holocentrics doomed to change? Limited chromosome number variation in Rhynchospora Vahl (Cyperaceae) Protoplasma. 2018; 255 :263-272 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 A). One explanation for this pronounced genome expansion would be a sudden and massive proliferation of repeat elements. However, we observed no accumulation of repeats when comparing repeat abundance profiles among closely related Rhynchospora species ( Figure S2 A). Thus, a different process must be responsible for the large genome size in R. pubera .
Completeness assessment of the R. pubera genome by calculating the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCOs) score revealed a surprisingly high level of gene duplications (96.0% duplicated BUSCOs) ( Figure S2 B). Annotation of the genome yielded far more high-confidence gene models (91,363) in R. pubera compared with the other species ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Table S1 ), confirming the high level of gene duplication ( Figure S2 C). Self-synteny analysis revealed that the R. pubera genome comprises two large syntenic blocks in four copies across the five chromosomes ( Figure S3 A). The larger syntenic block, named Block1, corresponded to the entire Rp Chr4 and Rp Chr5 and contributed to a large fraction of both Rp Chr1 and Rp Chr2. We identified the smaller block, named Block2, twice in an inverted arrangement in Rp Chr3, as well as in Rp Chr1 and Rp Chr2 ( Figure S3 A).
The distribution of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) for coding sequences over the intragenomic syntenic blocks in R. pubera had a large peak indicative of recent and successive whole-genome duplication (WGD) events. An additional small peak was also observed, indicating an ancient WGD ( Figure S3 B). By filtering out the sequences showing the lowest Ks values, we determined that Block1 from Rp Chr1 shows higher sequence identity to Rp Chr4, which we renamed Block1A1 and Block1A2, respectively. Similarly, Block1 from Rp Chr2 showed higher sequence identity to Rp Chr5, which were thus named Block1B1 and Block1B2, respectively ( Figures S3 B and S3C). We confirmed the relationships of the four Block1 copies by comparative phylogenetic analysis ( Figure S3 D). A similar analysis of Block2 copies was inconclusive ( Figures S3 C and S3E). Using k-mer analysis, which provides information on genome size, ploidy, and genome structure through scrutiny of heterozygous k-mer pairs ( Ranallo-Benavidez et al., 2020 78. Ranallo-Benavidez, T.R. ∙ Jaron, K.S. ∙ Schatz, M.C. GenomeScope 2.0 and Smudgeplot for reference-free profiling of polyploid genomes Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1432 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ), we detected a higher incidence of homozygous and duplicated k-mers, favoring an autopolyploidy genome model for R. pubera ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Importantly, this analysis accurately determined the diploid heterozygous state of R. breviuscula and R. tenuis ( Figure S4 ). Thus, R. pubera has an auto-octoploid genome shaped by two rounds of genome doubling explaining its large genome size. Post-polyploid genome shuffling events considerably reduced the chromosome number to n = 5.
To explore the genome duplications seen in R. pubera , we compared its genome with its close relative R. breviuscula , which has the same chromosome number but a genome that is one-quarter the size (415 Mb) ( Figure S2 A). Assessment of the R. breviuscula genome revealed a high level of completeness, with a BUSCO score of 98.3%, and little gene duplication (2.1%) ( Figures S2 B and S2C), confirmed by the absence of self-synteny ( Figure S1 D). Gene annotation yielded 24,354 high-confidence gene models ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Table S1 ), 4 times fewer than in the R. pubera genome, as expected. Synteny analysis between both genomes illustrated how each R. breviuscula chromosome ( Rb ) is present in four copies in the R. pubera genome ( Figure 5 A). Remarkably, Rp Chr1 and Rp Chr2 contained all five putative Rb s in end-to-end configurations. Rp Chr3 contained Rb 3 and Rb 4 copied twice in an inverted order, comprising Block2, while Rp Chr4 and Rp Chr5 contained Rb 1, R b 2, and Rb 5, comprising Block1A and Block1B, respectively ( Figure 5 A). Thus, R. breviuscula likely conserved the ancestral karyotype, while R. pubera restored the ACN ( x = 5) of its clade due to descending dysploidy, which was mediated by a complex chain of chromosome fusions, e.g., end-to-end fusions (EEFs), with 15 EEF junctions detected. Remarkably, each chromosome pair had a unique combination of ancestral chromosomes. We conclude that descending dysploidy involving a unique combination of chromosomes may be a strategy to avoid meiotic pairing issues that could potentially arise from autopolyploidy, thereby acting as a rapid route to diploidization facilitated by holocentricity.
Because we detected several EEFs in multiple copies in R. pubera , we assessed whether they were derived from the same rearrangement or if they arose from multiple independent events. All duplicated EEFs in the R. pubera genome, e.g., Rb2/ Rb 5, Rb 3/ Rb 4, Rb 1/ Rb 2, and Rb 1/ Rb 5 EEFs, share a fusion signature involving the same regions. This observation suggested that the Rb2/ Rb 5 and Rb 3/ Rb 4 EEFs, which are present 4 times in the R. pubera genome emerged only once—before the first WGD event ( Figures 5 C and S5 ). The Rb 1/ Rb 2 and Rb 1/ Rb 5 EEFs, which were found twice, likely emerged after the first WGD event. Finally, we found the Rb 1/ Rb 4, Rb2/ Rb 4, and Rb 3/ Rb 3 EEFs only once, suggesting that they occurred after the second WGD ( Figures 5 C and S5 ).
The Rb 3/ Rb 4 EEF, which forms Block2 in the R. pubera genome, was likely maintained as a duplicated fused chromosome after the first WGD, which might have allowed a longer period of tetrasomic inheritance. This hypothesis might explain the fact that the sequences of the four copies from Block2 cannot be distinguished from each other, in contrast to Block1.
We attempted to date the duplication events using a set of conserved genes shared among the four copies of Block1, which revealed the first WGD event as occurring around 3.8 million years ago (Mya) followed by a second WGD event around 2.1 Mya ( Figure S3 D). Based on this analysis, we deduced the origin and evolution of the R. pubera karyotype ( Figure 5 C). These results further support an autopolyploid origin for R. pubera and confirm a short interval between the two rounds of WGDs, indicating rapid chromosome number reduction in this species.
We carried out a number of analyses to determine the origin of the reduced karyotype in R. tenuis (n = 2). BUSCO analysis of its genome revealed high completeness (98.5% against the viridiplantae_odb10 dataset) and little duplication (3.7%) ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Gene annotation yielded 23,215 high-confidence gene models ( Figures 1 D and 1E). The absence of self-synteny in the R. tenuis genome ruled out large duplications ( Figure S2 E). Synteny comparison between R. tenuis and R. breviuscula genomes showed that again all Rb s were present in simple end-to-end configurations in the R. tenuis genome, explaining its karyotype by descending dysploidy from n = 5 to n = 2 ( Figure 5 A). Strikingly, we observed similar associations of syntenic Rb blocks as found in Block1 and 2 in both R. pubera and R. tenuis , where Rt Chr1 resembled Block1B and was composed of Rb2, Rb 5, and Rb 1, while Rt Chr2 resembled Block2, consisting of Rb 3 and Rb 4 ( Figure 5 A). However, the orientation of chromosome ends involved in the EEFs differed in the two instances, suggesting that the EEFs occurred independently ( Figure 5 C).
Despite their high chromosome number and centromere-type differences, J. effusus and the previously available genome for the sedge Carex littledalei (its homotypic synonym, Kobresia littledalei ) ( Can et al., 2020 7. Can, M. ∙ Wei, W. ∙ Zi, H. ... Genome sequence of Kobresia littledalei, the first chromosome-level genome in the family Cyperaceae Sci. Data. 2020; 7 :175 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed a typical diploid gene content and no evidence of any recent WGD, outside of a shared ancient WGD between sedges and rushes ( Figure S4 ). The J. effusus genome also revealed high completeness (100% viridiplantae_odb10 dataset) and little duplication (1.6%) ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Annotation of its genome yielded 18,942 high-confidence gene models ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Table S1 ). Synteny analysis further revealed that most J. effusus and C. littledalei chromosomes are present as highly collinear blocks across the five chromosomes of R. breviuscula , suggesting a high conservation of synteny although the group is ancient (78 Mya) ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Thus, neither the low nor the high chromosome numbers observed in many holocentric species necessarily reflect the absence or presence of recent polyploidy, respectively, and these numbers should be interpreted with caution in the absence of detailed genomic studies.
TEs can influence chromosomal rearrangements ( Lonnig and Saedler, 2002 51. Lonnig, W.E. ∙ Saedler, H. Chromosome rearrangements and transposable elements Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36 :389-410 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess their possible role in the EEFs observed in Rhynchospora genomes, we looked for enrichment of specific repeats at the ends of Rb s and near the junctions of EEFs in R. pubera and R. tenuis . We detected a high density of TEs in almost all subtelomeric regions of Rb s. These repeat-rich regions varied from 500 kb to 3 Mb in size, were mainly enriched for an LTR Ty3/Gypsy element of the Athila clade, were poorly enriched for genes, and lacked Tyba repeats ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S1 D). Notably, the R. breviuscula subtelomeric repeat-rich regions were largely missing at the junctions of fused chromosomes in both R. pubera and R. tenuis ( Figures 5 D and S6 ). Remarkably, we detected Tyba repeats exactly at the EEF junctions in 10 out of the 15 EEFs of R. pubera , while we observed a small 45S rDNA remnant array (with only five 18S-5.8S-26S units) in one EEF ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S6 A–S6G). In R. tenuis , we also identified a Tyba repeat array in one out of three EEF junctions ( Rb 3/ Rb 4 junction on Rt Chr2), while an interstitial telomeric site (536 bp) was detected at the Rb 5/ Rb 1 junction ( Figures 5 C and S6 H).
We used the duplicated genome copies of R. pubera to study cases of paralogous CENH3 domains and Tyba arrays. Of 660 groups of paralogous regions, 66% of the CENH3 domains were present in all four copies ( Table S5 ). We also identified 50 groups of paralogous regions in which the CENH3 domain was lost in one of the paralogs. Most cases (88%) were associated with Tyba loss ( Figures 6 A and S7 A) or a reduced size of the Tyba region in loci devoid of CENH3 signal compared with their paralogous regions bound by CENH3. We observed the likely inverse event, i.e., the gain of a new CENH3 domain, in groups of paralogous regions where we only identified the CENH3 domain in only one of the four paralogous regions. In the newly acquired CENH3 domain, there was either a new Tyba insertion, likely due to a new insertion of TCR1 ( Figures 6 B and S7 B), a Tyba expansion, or the insertion of a new TE (which was most frequent). However, the ChIP/input ratios within these potentially new CENH3 domains containing a new TE insertion (1.5) were significantly lower (p < 2.2.e−16) than the ChIP/input ratios in potentially new CENH3 domains associated with a new insertion of a Tyba element (4.1).

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Here, we report high-quality and contiguous chromosome-scale reference genomes for three species with repeat-based holocentromeres, R. pubera , R. breviuscula , and R. tenuis , and their closest monocentric relative, J. effusus . These newly assembled genomes provide a valuable resource for comparative biology and studies related to genome adaptation to different centromere types.
Repeat-based holocentromeres in beak-sedges comprise small islands (20–25 kb) of centromeric Tyba repeats, in which high mCpG, low H3K9me2, and depletion of H3K4me3 distinguish them from other holocentric genomes with and without repeat-based holocentromeres ( Cortes-Silva et al., 2020 13.

Steiner, F.A. ∙ Henikoff, S. Holocentromeres are dispersed point centromeres localized at transcription factor hotspots eLife. 2014; 3 :e02025 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). The association levels of H3K9me2 and mCHG at the core (low) and flanking (high) centromere units in R. pubera are strikingly similar to the recently reported A. thaliana centromeres ( Naish et al., 2021 69. Naish, M. ∙ Alonge, M. ∙ Wlodzimierz, P. ... The genetic and epigenetic landscape of the Arabidopsis centromeres Science. 2021; 374 :eabi7489 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also observed a similar pattern of mCHG methylation in monocentric J. effusus . Heterochromatinization of pericentromeres appears to be important for stabilizing the centromeric core, by preventing recombination between core repeats and stopping the spread of CENH3 into adjacent regions ( Achrem et al., 2020 1. Achrem, M. ∙ Szućko, I. ∙ Kalinka, A. The epigenetic regulation of centromeres and telomeres in plants and animals Comp. Cytogenet. 2020; 14 :265-311 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wong et al., 2020 101. Wong, C.Y.Y. ∙ Lee, B.C.H. ∙ Yuen, K.W.Y. Epigenetic regulation of centromere function Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2020; 77 :2899-2917 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, despite substantial genome restructuring, the epigenetic regulation of centromere units in beak-sedges resembles that in monocentric centromeres. This observation suggests an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic regulation of repeat-based centromeres in both mono- and holocentric organisms. We observed active genes close to and even within centromere units, which, although rare, is likely only possible with a plastic regulation of euchromatic and heterochromatic boundaries. We hypothesize that R. pubera achieves such a feat with a fine-scale epigenetic regulation of centromere units ( Figures 7 A and 7B).
Centromere units are regularly spaced (350–500 kb) in the Rhynchospora genomes, instead of randomly distributed. This specific spacing might point to a selection mechanism for establishing centromere units separated by an optimal spacing required to fold the chromatin during cell-cycle progression and for the recruitment of CENH3-positive nucleosomes to build the line-like holocentromere at metaphase ( Figure 7 B). In silico modeling based on polymer simulations of chromatin folding in holocentric chromosomes suggests that centromere units can act as anchors of loop extruders, facilitating the formation of line-like holocentromeres during chromosome condensation ( Câmara et al., 2021 6. Câmara, A.S. ∙ Schubert, V. ∙ Mascher, M. ... A simple model explains the cell cycle-dependent assembly of centromeric nucleosomes in holocentric species Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :9053-9065 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The repeat-based holocentromeres of the Rhynchospora species analyzed here are almost exclusively composed of Tyba repeats. We cannot conclude from the available data whether the accumulation of such repeats triggered the transition to holocentricity or whether CENH3 spreading preceded and/or also facilitated the subsequent expansion of holocentromeric repeats. However, we did demonstrate that a portion of Tyba arrays in R. pubera emerged in the genome as a result of the amplification of TCR1 -type Helitron s and that most (98.7%) full-length TCR1 elements possessing Tyba are associated with CENH3-bound chromatin. This either indicates that centromere units are at least partially determined genetically by the nucleotide sequence of Tyba or that TCR1 transposition involves the transfer of epigenetic centromere marks, e.g., CENH3, which remain associated with the new copy of the element. The presence of tandem repeats within Helitron s is common in both plants and animals ( Thomas and Pritham, 2015 97. Thomas, J. ∙ Pritham, E.J. Helitrons, the eukaryotic rolling-circle transposable elements Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), but TCR1 is unique because it possesses a centromeric satellite. The lack of Tyba repeats in TCR1 -related elements in R. breviuscula and R. tenuis suggests that Tyba was captured by TCR1 after the ancestors of R. pubera and the two other Rhynchospora species diverged.
It is conceivable, however, that the amplification and dispersal of Tyba occurred via mobilization by TEs earlier in the evolution of Rhynchospora and that the signatures of such events have long since been lost due to the accumulation of mutations, insertions and deletions, and DNA rearrangements. We also observed such changes in many TCR1 loci identified in the genome of R. pubera that contained either truncated TCR1 elements or full-length elements with nested insertions of other sequences ( Figures 4 K and 4L). The existence of a single TCR1/Helitron27 -related element in R. breviuscula that possesses Tyba but lacks overall similarity to TCR1 suggests that Tyba capture by Helitron s occurs recurrently in the evolution of Rhynchospora species and may result in waves of Tyba amplification via Helitron transposition.
Our results are consistent with dysploidy as the main driver of karyotype evolution in holocentric organisms ( Guerra, 2016 31. Guerra, M. Agmatoploidy and symploidy: a critical review Genet. Mol. Biol. 2016; 39 :492-496 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mayrose and Lysak, 2021 62. Mayrose, I. ∙ Lysak, M.A. The evolution of chromosome numbers: mechanistic models and experimental approaches Genome Biol. Evol. 2021; 13 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), where strong descending dysploidy restored the ACN ( x = 5) in R. pubera and reduced the chromosome number in R. tenuis . In both cases, the same ancestral chromosomes were fused independently either without ( R. tenuis ) or following WGDs ( R. pubera ). Such tolerance of extensive chromosomal rearrangements seems to underlie rapid karyotype evolution, eventually leading to chromosomal speciation ( Lucek et al., 2022 53. Lucek, K. ∙ Augustijnen, H. ∙ Escudero, M. A holocentric twist to chromosomal speciation? Trends Ecol. Evol. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lukhtanov et al., 2018 54. Lukhtanov, V.A. ∙ Dincă, V. ∙ Friberg, M. ... Versatility of multivalent orientation, inverted meiosis, and rescued fitness in holocentric chromosomal hybrids Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E9610-E9619 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Robertsonian translocations and chromosome fusions leading to descending dysploidy have been reported in some holocentric butterflies ( Cicconardi et al., 2021 11. Cicconardi, F. ∙ Lewis, J.J. ∙ Martin, S.H. ... Chromosome fusion affects genetic diversity and evolutionary turnover of functional loci but consistently depends on chromosome size Mol. Biol. Evol. 2021; 38 :4449-4462 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hill et al., 2019 38. Hill, J. ∙ Rastas, P. ∙ Hornett, E.A. ... Unprecedented reorganization of holocentric chromosomes provides insights into the enigma of lepidopteran chromosome evolution Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaau3648 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the incidence of EEFs as the sole mechanism of descending dysploidy in Rhynchospora is intriguing. Remarkably, meiotic pairing and segregation are not disturbed in the R. pubera genome ( Marques et al., 2016 60. Marques, A. ∙ Schubert, V. ∙ Houben, A. ... Restructuring of holocentric centromeres During meiosis in the plant Rhynchospora pubera Genetics. 2016; 204 :555-568 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that selection has produced a balanced set of fewer chromosomes. Since R. pubera underwent two rounds of WGD, descending dysploidy by EEFs would be a way to effectively create chromosomes with different combinations of ancestral syntenic blocks, reducing the risk of meiotic multivalent pairing without the need of rapid genome downsizing. EEFs in genomes with monocentric chromosomes are normally associated with the formation of typically unstable dicentric chromosomes but may represent a way for chromosomal rearrangements when coupled with concurrent centromere elimination as part of structural diploidization after WGDs ( Mandáková et al., 2010 55. Mandáková, T. ∙ Joly, S. ∙ Krzywinski, M. ... Fast diploidization in close mesopolyploid relatives of Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :2277-2290 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mandáková and Lysak, 2018 56. Mandáková, T. ∙ Lysak, M.A. Post-polyploid diploidization and diversification through dysploid changes Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2018; 42 :55-65 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murat et al., 2010 67. Murat, F. ∙ Xu, J.H. ∙ Tannier, E. ... Ancestral grass karyotype reconstruction unravels new mechanisms of genome shuffling as a source of plant evolution Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1545-1557 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). We argue that the prevalence of EEFs observed in R. pubera was facilitated by holocentricity, avoiding the deleterious effect of two centromeres after EEFs in monocentric species and likely promoting rapid structural diploidization.
In Rhynchospora , homologous non-sister chromatids are linked by terminal chromatin threads during inverted meiosis ( Cabral et al., 2014 5. Cabral, G. ∙ Marques, A. ∙ Schubert, V. ... Chiasmatic and achiasmatic inverted meiosis of plants with holocentric chromosomes Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :5070 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). EEFs may occur with high(er) frequency in scenarios where chromatids of nonhomologous chromosomes are erroneously connected via repeat-based chromatin threads. However, this notion does not exclude the possibility of EEFs occurring during interphase or mitosis. It is tempting to speculate that the repeat-rich regions observed at chromosome ends in R. breviuscula are involved in the formation of chromatin threads, which may act as substrates for ectopic recombination. Tyba repeats near these repeat-rich regions may be preferentially used as the site for recombination and may thus facilitate the occurrence of EEFs ( Figure 7 C). Alternatively, the recruitment of Tyba repeats as DNA templates to seal double-stranded breaks involved in EEFs may explain their pronounced association with EEFs ( Vu et al., 2017 99. Vu, G.T.H. ∙ Cao, H.X. ∙ Fauser, F. ... Endogenous sequence patterns predispose the repair modes of CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA double-stranded breaks in Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 2017; 92 :57-67 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The three Rhynchospora species analyzed in this study are characterized by repeat-based holocentromeres associated with Tyba repeats. However, some Rhynchospora species lack Tyba repeats ( Ribeiro et al., 2017 81. Ribeiro, T. ∙ Marques, A. ∙ Novák, P. ... Centromeric and non-centromeric satellite DNA organisation differs in holocentric Rhynchospora species Chromosoma. 2017; 126 :325-335 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ); thus, it is not clear whether repeat-based holocentromeres evolved in all species of the genus. Extending our approach to other holocentric species lacking Tyba -like repeats will certainly reveal new insights into the evolution of repeat-based holocentromeres. In addition, the presence of holocentric chromosomes in multiple genera of sedges as well as in closely related rushes (e.g., Luzula species), but not in Juncus , suggests that the transition to holocentricity occurred a long time ago (>60 Mya), which makes temporal tracking challenging. Indeed, our analyses of orthogroups did not identify a clear pattern related to different centromere types.

Plants from naturally occurring populations of R. pubera and R. tenuis growing in Curado (Recife), Northeastern Brazil, and R. breviuscula growing in Londrina (Paraná state), Southern Brazil were collected in 2013 and further cultivated under controlled greenhouse conditions (16h daylight, 26 °C, >70% humidity). As a monocentric outgroup an individual of the ornamental plant Juncus effusus var. spiralis was commercially obtained and cultivated under controlled greenhouse conditions (16h daylight, 20°C).
The genome size of 1C=1.6 Gb for the R. pubera accession sequenced here has been previously measured ( Marques et al., 2015 59. Marques, A. ∙ Ribeiro, T. ∙ Neumann, P. ... Holocentromeres in Rhynchospora are associated with genome-wide centromere-specific repeat arrays interspersed among euchromatin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :13633-13638 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, genome size estimations by flow cytometry were performed for the accessions of R. breviuscula and R. tenuis as well as for Juncus effusus var. spiralis . For that, roughly 0.5 cm 2 of young leaf tissue was chopped with a sharp razorblade in a Petri dish together with appropriate amounts of leaf tissue of the internal reference standard Raphanus sativus cv. Voran (2C=1.11 pg; Genebank Gatersleben, accession number: RA 34) using the ‘CyStain PI Absolute P’ nuclei extraction and staining kit (Sysmex-Partec). The resulting nuclei suspension was filtered through a 50-μm filter (CellTrics, Sysmex-Partec) and measured on a CyFlow Space flow cytometer (Sysmex-Partec). The absolute DNA content (pg/2C) was calculated based on the values of the G1 peak means and the corresponding genome size (Mb/1C) according to Dolezel et al. (2003) 17. Dolezel, J. ∙ Bartos, J. ∙ Voglmayr, H. ... Nuclear DNA content and genome size of trout and human Cytometry A. 2003; 51 :127-128 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar .
High-molecular-weight DNA was isolated from 1.5 g of material with a NucleoBond HMW DNA kit (Macherey Nagel). Quality was assessed with a FEMTO-pulse device (Agilent), and quantity was measured with a Quantus fluorometer (Promega).
Genomic DNA from R. breviuscula and R. alba were deep-sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 3000 in 150-bp paired-end mode. Alternatively, DNBseq short read sequencing (BGI Genomics, Hong Kong) of genomic DNA was performed for R. pubera , R. tenuis , and R. tenerrima . Available WGS short reads from R. cephalotes (SRX9381225), R. ciliata ( Ribeiro et al., 2017 81. Ribeiro, T. ∙ Marques, A. ∙ Novák, P. ... Centromeric and non-centromeric satellite DNA organisation differs in holocentric Rhynchospora species Chromosoma. 2017; 126 :325-335 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), R exaltata (SRX9381226), R. globosa ( Ribeiro et al., 2017 81. Ribeiro, T. ∙ Marques, A. ∙ Novák, P. ... Centromeric and non-centromeric satellite DNA organisation differs in holocentric Rhynchospora species Chromosoma. 2017; 126 :325-335 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), and C. littledalei (SRX5833125, SRX5833124) were used.
A HiFi library was then prepared according to the " Procedure & Checklist - Preparing HiFi SMRTbell® Libraries using SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 " manual with an initial DNA fragmentation by g-Tubes (Covaris) and final library size binning into defined fractions by SageELF (Sage Science). Size distribution was again controlled by FEMTO-pulse (Agilent). Size-selected libraries were then sequenced on a Sequel II device with Binding kit 2.0 and Sequel II Sequencing Kit 2.0 for 30 h ( Pacific Biosciences ). The numbers of SMRT cells for each species were as follows: R. pubera (3 cells), R. breviuscula (1 cell), R. tenuis (2 cells), and J. effusus (1 cell).
For each species, a single chromatin-capture library was prepared from 0.5 g fresh weight material input. All treatments were according to the recommendations of the kit vendor for plants (Omni-C, Dovetail). As a final step, an Illumina-compatible library was prepared (Dovetail) and paired-end 2 x 150 bp deep-sequenced on a HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) device for R. breviuscula , R. tenuis , and J. effusus . Alternatively, the R. pubera library was paired-end 2 x 150 bp deep-sequenced using DNBseq technology (BGI Genomics, Hong Kong).
ChIP DNA was quality-controlled using the NGS-assay on a FEMTO-pulse (Agilent); then, an Illumina-compatible library was prepared with the Ovation Ultralow V2 DNA-Seq library preparation kit (Tecan Genomics) and single-end 1 x 150-bp sequenced on a HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) device. For each library, an average of 20 millions reads were obtained.
To investigate the methylome space in R. pubera and J. effusus , the relatively non-destructive NEBNext® Enzymatic Methyl-seq Kit was employed to prepare an Illumina-compatible library, followed by paired-end sequencing (2 x 150 bp) on a HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) device. For each library, 10 Gb of reads were generated.
Total RNA from root, leaves, and flower buds was isolated from R. breviuscula . For R. tenuis , total RNA was isolated from flower buds only. For J. effusus , RNAseq data from the NCBI (accession numbers SRX2268676, SRX2268675, and SRX1639021) were used to complement its genome annotation. For R. pubera , total RNA was extracted from six different tissues (i.e., roots, young leaves, old leaves, stem, early flower buds, and late flower buds). Poly-A RNA was enriched from 1 μg total RNA using the NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module. RNAseq libraries were prepared as described in the NEBNext Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). A total of 11 cycles were applied to enrich library concentration. Sequencing was done at BGI Genomics (Hong Kong) with a BGISEQ-500 system in the DNBseq platform in paired-end mode 2 x 150 bp.
For the proper annotation of the complex R. pubera genome, total RNA was extracted from six different tissues (i.e., roots, young leaves, old leaves, stem, early flower buds and late flower buds) and quality-assessed by a Nanochip (Agilent Bioanalyser, Santa Clara, U.S.A.). Next, cDNA was synthesized according to the TeloPrime Version 2 kit (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria). We exchanged the Lexogen first-strand synthesis oligo-dT primer for the (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACT(30)VN-3') primer to introduce a 3' anchor base. Then, the optimal number of cycles was determined by qPCR (Viia7, Applied Biosystems) with the 1x Evagreen fluorochrome (Biotium, Fremont, U.S.A.), TeloPrime kit chemistry and 25% of the cDNA as input. The forward primer was FP from the TeloPrime kit, and the reverse primer was 5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC-3'. The residual cDNA was mass-amplified with an extended Lexogen FP primer by adding 16mer barcodes as recommended by PacBio at the 5' end and a cycle number by which 80% of the maximal fluorescence signal was reached. The PCR products were bead-purified (Pronex beads, Promega) followed by PacBio library preparation with the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, U.S.A.), and then quantity- (Quantus, Promega) and quality-assessed (Agilent Bioanalyser). Long-read sequencing was performed on a Sequel II sequencer with a Sequel II Binding kit 2.1, Sequel II Sequencing Kit 2.0 sequencing chemistry 2.0, and a single 8M SMRT cell ( Pacific Biosciences , Menlo Park, U.S.A.). The movie time was 30 h after a 2-h immobilization step and 2-h pre-extension step to adjust for high-fidelity (HiFi) sequencing.
Genome sizes of the three Rhynchospora species and J. effusus were also confirmed by k-mer frequency analysis with the findGSE tool ( Sun et al., 2018 94. Sun, H.Q. ∙ Ding, J. ∙ Piednoël, M. ... findGSE: estimating genome size variation within human and Arabidopsis using k-mer frequencies Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :550-557 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), after counting k-mers with Jellyfish ( Marçais and Kingsford, 2011 58. Marçais, G. ∙ Kingsford, C. A fast, lock-free approach for efficient parallel counting of occurrences of k-mers Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :764-770 Crossref Scopus (1643) PubMed Google Scholar ). High-coverage short reads were used as follows: R. pubera (60x), R. breviuscula (50x), and R. tenuis (130x). Since for J. effusus we did not have short-read data, we used our high-coverage HiFi PacBio reads (70x).
We used Smudgeplot ( Ranallo-Benavidez et al., 2020 78. Ranallo-Benavidez, T.R. ∙ Jaron, K.S. ∙ Schatz, M.C. GenomeScope 2.0 and Smudgeplot for reference-free profiling of polyploid genomes Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1432 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) to visualize and estimate the ploidy and structure of the sequenced genomes. This tool can infer ploidy directly from the k-mers present in sequencing reads by analyzing heterozygous k-mer pairs.
HiFi reads obtained by the sequencing process were subjected to assembly using the HiCanu function of Canu ( Nurk et al., 2020 73. Nurk, S. ∙ Walenz, B.P. ∙ Rhie, A. ... HiCanu: accurate assembly of segmental duplications, satellites, and allelic variants from high-fidelity long reads Genome Res. 2020; 30 :1291-1305 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), available at https://github.com/marbl/canu , for R. pubera with the following command line:
canu -assemble -p output.asm -d run1 genomeSize=1.6g maxThreads=40 useGrid=false -pacbio-hifi ∗ .fastq.
Alternatively, Hifiasm ( Cheng et al., 2021 10. Cheng, H.Y. ∙ Concepcion, G.T. ∙ Feng, X.W. ... Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly using phased assembly graphs with hifiasm Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :170-175 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), available at https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm , was used for the assembly of R. breviuscula , R. tenuis , and J. effusus with the following command:
hifiasm -o output.asm -t 40 reads.fq.gz.
Preliminary assemblies were evaluated for contiguity and completeness with BUSCO ( Seppey et al., 2019 87. Seppey, M. ∙ Manni, M. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (703) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We developed an optical mapping strategy to help resolve the complexity of the R. pubera genome. High-molecular-weight DNA was prepared from young leaves of R. pubera . A total of 3.15 million cell nuclei were purified by flow cytometry, pelleted by centrifugation (30 min at 300 g ), and embedded in four agarose plugs of 20-μL volume. The nuclear DNA was purified in the plugs as described by Šimková et al. (2003) 88. Šimková, H. ∙ Číhalíková, J. ∙ Vrána, J. ... Preparation of HMW DNA from plant nuclei and chromosomes isolated from root tips Biol. Plant. 2003; 46 :369-373 Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar with an increased concentration of proteinase K (1 mg/mL of lysis buffer). The proteinase- and RNase-treated DNA was isolated from the agarose gel, and the resulting 525 ng DNA was directly labeled at DLE-1 recognition sites following the standard Bionano Prep Direct Label and Stain (DLS) Protocol (Bionano Genomics, San Diego, USA) and analyzed on the Saphyr platform of Bionano Genomics. A total of 1.27 Tbp of single-molecule data with N50 of 236 kb, corresponding to effective coverage of 96.8x of the R. pubera genome, was used in de novo assembly by Bionano Solve 3.6.1_11162020, using a standard configuration file “optArguments_nonhaplotype_noES_noCut_DLE1_saphyr.xml” ( Table S6 ). A p-value threshold of 1e–11 was used to build the initial assembly, a p-value of 1e–12 was used for extension and refinement steps (five rounds), and a p-value of 1e–16 was used for final map merging. To improve the contiguity of the sequence assembly, an automatic hybrid scaffold pipeline integrated in Bionano Solve 3.6.1_11162020 was run with the de novo optical map assembly. The default DLE-1 Hybrid Scaffold configuration file was used with the “Resolve conflict” option for conflict resolution. The conflicts between sequences and the optical map were manually curated, and the pipeline was re-run using the modified conflict_cut_statu.txt file ( Table S7 ). The results obtained from the optical mapping scaffolding of the genome assembly of R. pubera were used as input for Omni-C scaffolding.
Dovetail Omni-C reads were first mapped using BWA ( Li and Durbin, 2009 50. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (25404) PubMed Google Scholar ) following the hic-pipeline available at https://github.com/esrice/hic-pipeline . Hi-C scaffolding was performed using SALSA2 ( Ghurye et al., 2019 27. Ghurye, J. ∙ Rhie, A. ∙ Walenz, B.P. ... Integrating Hi-C links with assembly graphs for chromosome-scale assembly PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1007273 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ), available at https://github.com/marbl/SALSA , with default parameters. After testing several minimum mapping quality values of bam alignments, final scaffolding was performed with MAPQ10. Several rounds of assembly correction guided by Hi-C contact maps and manual curation of scaffolds were performed to obtain the pseudomolecules.
The rather homozygous genome of J. effusus was estimated to be close to 1C=271 Mb ( Figure 1 ; Figure S4 C). Sequencing of J. effusus var. spiralis yielded 19 Gb of reads and an initial assembly of 258 Mb (79 × coverage, N 50 = 11 Mb, Figure 1 ), where 18 contigs corresponded to complete chromosomes. The assembly was further scaffolded to the expected 21 pseudomolecules (240 Mb), and unplaced contigs contained 18 Mb, corresponding to the complete haploid chromosome set of the species ( Figures 1 and 2 A). The sequencing of R. pubera , which is an inbred species, yielded 66 Gb of PacBio HiFi reads, and the initial assembly spanned 1.7 Gb (38 × coverage, N 50 = 11.2 Mb). After removing redundant sequences likely due to some small residual heterozygosity, the assembly closely matched its estimated haploid genome size ( Figures 1 and S3 F). A first scaffolding using optical mapping was followed by a second scaffolding using chromosome conformation capture (Omni-C, Dovetail™) of the genome assembly, which yielded five very large pseudomolecules (1.47 Gb, N 50 = 361 Mb), while unplaced contigs contained 141 Mb ( Figure 1 ). The sequencing of R. breviuscula yielded 30 Gb of PacBio HiFi reads, resulting in an initial assembly that was 813 Mb in length. In contrast to R. pubera , R. breviuscula is outbred, which resulted in an assembly of its diploid genome size showing a high level of heterozygosity confirmed by k-mer analysis ( Figures 1 and S4 A). We pruned the resulting large contigs to the single largest representative haplotype (75 × coverage, 421 Mb, N 50 = 11 Mb; Figure 1 ) and then oriented and ordered it into five pseudomolecules using Omni-C scaffolding comprising 370 Mb (N 50 = 71 Mb; Figure S1 A). Unplaced contigs contained 50 Mb ( Figure 1 ). The sequenced genome of R. tenuis yielded 45.9 Gb of PacBio HiFi reads resulting in an assembly of 770 Mb, which closely corresponds to its diploid genome size, showing a high level of heterozygosity ( Figures 1 and S4 B). We pruned the resulting large contigs to the single largest representative haplotype (120 × coverage, 395 Mb, N 50 = 19 Mb, Figure 1 ), which was oriented and ordered into two pseudomolecules of about 350 Mb (N 50 = 215 Mb; Figure S1 B). Unplaced contigs contained 47 Mb ( Figure 1 ).
Final Hi-C maps of R. pubera , R. breviuscula , R. tenuis , and J. effusus were generated by Juicer (v1.6) ( Durand et al., 2016 19. Durand, N.C. ∙ Robinson, J.T. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ... Juicebox provides a visualization system for Hi-C contact maps with unlimited zoom Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :99-101 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the sequencing data from DNase in situ Hi-C (Omni-C) experiments. Specifically, technical replicates were aligned and deduplicated and then the results of each replicate were merged by MEGA from Juicer.
The python version of Straw (strawC v0.0.9) ( Durand et al., 2016 19. Durand, N.C. ∙ Robinson, J.T. ∙ Shamim, M.S. ... Juicebox provides a visualization system for Hi-C contact maps with unlimited zoom Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :99-101 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (508) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to extract Hi-C counts from the illustrated Hi-C maps ( Figure 2 ; Figure S1 ) in 1-Mb resolution and with the normalization approach of Vanilla Coverage (VC). To represent the intra- and interchromosomal interactions in an intuitive manner, the cis Hi-C contact of a chromosome was quantified as the sum of all Hi-C counts within the chromosome per se , while trans Hi-C contacts referred to the sum of Hi-C counts between the designated chromosome and all other chromosomes. The final intra- and interchromosomal contacts for each single chromosome were normalized through the percentages of Hi-C counts over the sum of all Hi-C signals in the corresponding Hi-C map. It is also noteworthy that the infinite extracted Hi-C counts through Straw were replaced by the mean of all other finite counts within the extracted chromosomal pair.
ChIP experiments were performed following Reimer and Turck (2010) 79. Reimer, J.J. ∙ Turck, F. Genome-wide mapping of protein-DNA interaction by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip). Part A: ChIP-chip molecular methods Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 631 :139-160 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar , with adjustments for R. pubera and R. breviuscula . Unopened flower buds were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen until sufficient material was obtained. The samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 min and the chromatin was sonicated for 25 min. Then, 7–85 μL of sonicated chromatin was incubated with 2 ng of respective antibody overnight. Immunoprecipitation was carried out for rabbit anti- Rp CENH3, for R. pubera and R. breviuscula , and for rabbit anti-H3K4me3 (abcam, ab8580), and mouse anti-H3K9me2 (abcam, ab1220). Recombinant rabbit IgG (abcam, ab172730) and no-antibody inputs were used as controls. Two experimental replications were also maintained for all the combinations. After overnight incubation of chromatin with antibody, protein beads (anti-mouse: Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow, anti-rabbit: rProtein A Sepharose Fast Flow) were added to the chromatin-antibody mixture. The bound chromatin was finally eluted, de-crosslinked, precipitated, and sent for sequencing.
The synteny analysis shown in Figure 5 was performed using the MCscan pipeline implemented in the JVCI utility libraries ( Tang et al., 2008 95. Tang, H. ∙ Bowers, J.E. ∙ Wang, X. ... Synteny and collinearity in plant genomes Science. 2008; 320 :486-488 Crossref Scopus (700) PubMed Google Scholar ). For this analysis, CDS sequences of the longest transcript were used. Circular plots were drawn with the circos package ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 47. Krzywinski, M. ∙ Schein, J. ∙ Birol, I. ... Circos: an information aesthetic for comparative genomics Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1639-1645 Crossref Scopus (6130) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Self-synteny analyses shown in Figures S1 D, S1E, and S3 A were performed with SyMAP v. 5.0.6 ( Soderlund et al., 2006 91. Soderlund, C. ∙ Nelson, W. ∙ Shoemaker, A. ... SyMAP: A system for discovering and viewing syntenic regions of FPC maps Genome Res. 2006; 16 :1159-1168 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar , 2011 90. Soderlund, C. ∙ Bomhoff, M. ∙ Nelson, W.M. SyMAP v3.4: a turnkey synteny system with application to plant genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :e68 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Circular self-synteny plots were obtained with SyMAP or RIdeogram software ( Hao et al., 2020 35. Hao, Z. ∙ Lv, D. ∙ Ge, Y. ... RIdeogram: drawing SVG graphics to visualize and map genome-wide data on the idiograms PeerJ Comput. Sci. 2020; 6 :e251 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the synteny calculation blocks obtained from SyMAP.
A whole-genome alignment (WGA) between R. pubera , R. tenuis , R. breviuscula , J. effusus , and C. littledalei was generated using the Cactus pipeline (Version 1.0) ( Paten et al., 2011 74. Paten, B. ∙ Earl, D. ∙ Nguyen, N. ... Cactus: algorithms for genome multiple sequence alignment Genome Res. 2011; 21 :1512-1528 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to the alignment step, all nucleotide sequences were 20-kmer-softmasked to reduce complexity and facilitate construction of the WGA using the tallymer subtools from the genome tools package (Version 1.6.1) ( Kurtz et al., 2008 48. Kurtz, S. ∙ Narechania, A. ∙ Stein, J.C. ... A new method to compute K-mer frequencies and its application to annotate large repetitive plant genomes BMC Genomics. 2008; 9 :517 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cactus pipeline was run stepwise with the default settings described at https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus#running-step-by-step .
For the characterization of the regions involved in EEFs observed in R. pubera and R. tenuis , we first compared the synteny alignment between their genomes with R. breviuscula used as a reference in SyMAP. This allowed us to pin the putative regions around the borders of the fusion events. To gain insights about the order of fusion events in the complex genome of R. pubera we extracted all duplicated fusion regions and aligned them against themselves in SyMAP ( Figures 5 C and S5 ). This detailed analysis further allowed us to reconstruct the order of the fusion events and tracing the karyotype history of R. pubera based on the shared EEF signatures found in the genome.
In order, to identify the underlying sequences at the fusion regions, we loaded annotation features for genes, TEs, Tyba , rDNA and telomeric repeats on SyMAP aligments. This allowed us to detect the sequence types in the putative translocated regions. In R. pubera , we counted 15 potential EEF regions, of which 11 regions had a Tyba array right in the middle between two ancestral syntenic chromosomes of R. breviuscula . Further inspection and characterization of such regions were done by checking the genome coordinates and annotation features with Geneious ( Kearse et al., 2012 43. Kearse, M. ∙ Moir, R. ∙ Wilson, A. ... Geneious Basic: an integrated and extendable desktop software platform for the organization and analysis of sequence data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1647-1649 Crossref Scopus (12028) PubMed Google Scholar ), which revealed a remnant rDNA cluster involved in the EEF of two ancestral Rb 3 in the Rp Chr3. The other three regions did not show any specific sequence ( Figures 5 C and S6 A–S6G). Similar strategy was used to identify the underlying sequences within the three fusion events in R. tenuis chromosomes. In this species, we found a Tyba repeat underlying the fusion region between Rb 3/ Rb 4 in Rt Chr2 and a telomeric repeat between Rb 1/ Rb 5 in Rt Chr1, while the third fusion between had no specific sequence ( Figures 5 C and S6 H). Common to most fusion events we found that the very ends of R. breviuscula chromosomes, which are enriched for TEs are mostly missing in the fused chromosomes ( Figures 5 D and S6 ).
To identify ancient WGD events, we performed Synonymous (Ks) substitutions analysis on the fully annotated genomes with the SynMap2 ( Haug-Baltzell et al., 2017 36. Haug-Baltzell, A. ∙ Stephens, S.A. ∙ Davey, S. ... SynMap2 and SynMap3D: web-based whole-genome synteny browsers Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2197-2198 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ) available at CoGe webportal ( https://genomevolution.org/coge/SynMap.pl ).
Structural gene annotation was done combining de novo gene calling and homology-based approaches with RNAseq, IsoSeq, and protein datasets.
Using evidence derived from expression data, RNAseq data were first mapped using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 16. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (17570) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.7.8a) and subsequently assembled into transcripts by StringTie ( Kovaka et al., 2019 44. Kovaka, S. ∙ Zimin, A.V. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ... Transcriptome assembly from long-read RNA-seq alignments with StringTie2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :278 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.1.5, parameters -m 150-t -f 0.3). Triticeae protein sequences from available public datasets (UniProt, https://www.uniprot.org , 05/10/2016) were aligned against the genome sequence using GenomeThreader ( Gremme et al., 2005 30. Gremme, G. ∙ Brendel, V. ∙ Sparks, M.E. ... Engineering a software tool for gene structure prediction in higher organisms Inf. Software Technol. 2005; 47 :965-978 Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar ) (version 1.7.1; arguments -startcodon -finalstopcodon -species rice -gcmincoverage 70 -prseedlength 7 -prhdist 4). Isoseq datasets were aligned to the genome assembly using GMAP ( Wu and Watanabe, 2005 102. Wu, T.D. ∙ Watanabe, C.K. GMAP: a genomic mapping and alignment program for mRNA and EST sequences Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :1859-1875 Crossref Scopus (1350) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2018-07-04). All transcripts from RNAseq, IsoSeq, and aligned protein sequences were combined using Cuffcompare ( Ghosh and Chan, 2016 26. Ghosh, S. ∙ Chan, C.K. Analysis of RNA-seq data using TopHat and cufflinks Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1374 :339-361 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.2.1) and subsequently merged with StringTie (version 2.1.5, parameters --merge -m150) into a pool of candidate transcripts. TransDecoder (version 5.5.0; http://transdecoder.github.io ) was used to find potential open reading frames and to predict protein sequences within the candidate transcript set.
Ab initio annotation was initially done using Augustus ( Hoff and Stanke, 2019 40. Hoff, K.J. ∙ Stanke, M. Predicting genes in single genomes with AUGUSTUS Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2019; 65 :e57 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 3.3.3). GeneMark ( Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008 96. Ter-Hovhannisyan, V. ∙ Lomsadze, A. ∙ Chernoff, Y.O. ... Gene prediction in novel fungal genomes using an ab initio algorithm with unsupervised training Genome Res. 2008; 18 :1979-1990 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 4.35) was additionally employed to further improve structural gene annotation. To avoid potential over-prediction, we generated guiding hints using the above described RNAseq, protein, and IsoSeq datasets as described by Hoff and Stanke (2019) 40. Hoff, K.J. ∙ Stanke, M. Predicting genes in single genomes with AUGUSTUS Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2019; 65 :e57 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar . A specific Augustus model for Rhynchospora was built by generating a set of gene models with full support from RNAseq and IsoSeq. Augustus was trained and optimized using the steps detailed by Hoff and Stanke (2019) 40. Hoff, K.J. ∙ Stanke, M. Predicting genes in single genomes with AUGUSTUS Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2019; 65 :e57 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar .
To maximize uniformity across all annotated species, Augustus was also run in comparative annotation mode ( Nachtweide and Stanke, 2019 68. Nachtweide, S. ∙ Stanke, M. Multi-genome annotation with AUGUSTUS Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :139-160 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). The generated WGA served as sequence input together with the mapping of RNAseq data as described above.
All structural gene annotations were joined using EVidenceModeller ( Haas et al., 2008 34. Haas, B.J. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. ∙ Zhu, W. ... Automated eukaryotic gene structure annotation using EVidenceModeler and the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R7 Crossref Scopus (1230) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 1.1.1), and weights were adjusted according to the input source: ab initio (Augustus: 5, GeneMark: 2), homology-based (10), and comparative ab initio (7). Additionally, two rounds of PASA ( Haas et al., 2003 33. Haas, B.J. ∙ Delcher, A.L. ∙ Mount, S.M. ... Improving the Arabidopsis genome annotation using maximal transcript alignment assemblies Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :5654-5666 Crossref Scopus (917) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.4.1) were run to identify untranslated regions and isoforms using transcripts generated by a genome-guided TRINITY ( Grabherr et al., 2011 29. Grabherr, M.G. ∙ Haas, B.J. ∙ Yassour, M. ... Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :644-652 U130 Crossref Scopus (12057) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 2.13.1) assembly derived from Rhynchospora RNAseq data and the above described IsoSeq datasets.
We used BLASTP ( Altschul et al., 1990 2. Altschul, S.F. ∙ Gish, W. ∙ Miller, W. ... Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Crossref Scopus (69041) PubMed Google Scholar ) (ncbi-blast-2.3.0+, parameters -max_target_seqs 1 -evalue 1e–05) to compare potential protein sequences with a trusted set of reference proteins (Uniprot Magnoliophyta, reviewed/Swissprot, downloaded on 3 Aug 2016; https://www.uniprot.org ). This differentiated candidates into complete and valid genes, non-coding transcripts, pseudogenes, and transposable elements. In addition, we used PTREP (Release 19; http://botserv2.uzh.ch/kelldata/trep-db/index.html ), a database of hypothetical proteins containing deduced amino acid sequences in which internal frameshifts have been removed in many cases. This step is particularly useful for the identification of divergent transposable elements with no significant similarity at the DNA level. Best hits were selected for each predicted protein from each of the three databases. Only hits with an e-value below 10e–10 were considered. Furthermore, functional annotation of all predicted protein sequences was done using the AHRD pipeline ( https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD ).
Proteins were further classified into two confidence classes: high and low. Hits with subject coverage (for protein references) or query coverage (transposon database) above 80% were considered significant and protein sequences were classified as high-confidence using the following criteria: protein sequence was complete and had a subject and query coverage above the threshold in the UniMag database or no BLAST hit in UniMag but in UniPoa and not PTREP; a low-confidence protein sequence was incomplete and had a hit in the UniMag or UniPoa database but not in PTREP. Alternatively, it had no hit in UniMag, UniPoa, or PTREP, but the protein sequence was complete. In a second refinement step, low-confidence proteins with an AHRD-score of 3 ∗ were promoted to high-confidence.
BUSCO ( Seppey et al., 2019 87. Seppey, M. ∙ Manni, M. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (703) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 5.1.2.) was used to evaluate the gene space completeness of the pseudomolecule assembly and structural gene annotation with the ‘viridiplantae_odb10’ database containing 425 single-copy genes.
Orthogroup assignments ( Table S4 ) was performed with OrthoFinder ( Emms and Kelly, 2019 20. Emms, D.M. ∙ Kelly, S. OrthoFinder: phylogenetic orthology inference for comparative genomics Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :238 Crossref Scopus (1076) PubMed Google Scholar ). For GO term enrichment, a GO annotation file (gaf; 2.1) was built using all GO terms assigned by the functional annotations of R. pubera , R. breviuscula , R. tenuis , and J. effusus . GO term enrichment was performed by feeding GO terms of the shared orthologos into Ontologiser (ontologiser.de). P -values were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We used the UpSetR ( Conway et al., 2017 12. Conway, J.R. ∙ Lex, A. ∙ Gehlenborg, N. UpSetR: an R package for the visualization of intersecting sets and their properties Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :2938-2940 Crossref Scopus (928) PubMed Google Scholar ) package ( http://gehlenborglab.org/research/projects/upsetr/ ) to analyze how many orthogroups are shared between the five species or are unique to a single species.
To identify the overall repetitiveness of genomes we performed de novo repeat discovery with RepeatExplorer2 ( Novák et al., 2020 72. Novák, P. ∙ Neumann, P. ∙ Macas, J. Global analysis of repetitive DNA from unassembled sequence reads using RepeatExplorer2 Nat. Protoc. 2020; 15 :3745-3776 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) for nine species of Rhynchospora , C. littledalei , and J. effusus . We used a repeat library obtained from the RepeatExplorer2 analysis of Illumina paired-end reads. All clusters representing at least 0.005% of the genomes were manually checked, and the automated annotation was corrected if needed. Contigs from the annotated clusters were used to build a repeat library. To minimize potential conflicts due to the occasional presence of contaminating sequences in the clusters, only contigs with average read depths ≥ 5 were included and all regions in these contigs that had read depths < 5 were masked. Genome assemblies were then annotated using custom RepeatMasker (REF - Smit, AFA, Hubley, R & Green, P. RepeatMasker Open-4.0. 2013-2015 http://www.repeatmasker.org ) search with options -xsmall -no_is -e ncbi -nolow. Output from RepeatMasker was parsed using custom scripts ( https://github.com/kavonrtep/repeat_annotation_pipeline ) to remove overlapping and conflicting annotations.
Transposable element protein domains ( Neumann et al., 2019 70. Neumann, P. ∙ Novák, P. ∙ Hoštáková, N. ... Systematic survey of plant LTR-retrotransposons elucidates phylogenetic relationships of their polyprotein domains and provides a reference for element classification Mobile DNA. 2019; 10 :1 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) found in the assembled genomes were annotated using the DANTE tool available from the RepeatExplorer2 Galaxy portal. To find master Helitron elements related to TCR1 , we first searched the genome assembly for Helitron helicase-coding sequences using DANTE ( https://repeatexplorer-elixir.cerit-sc.cz/galaxy/ ) exploiting the REXdb database ( Neumann et al., 2019 70. Neumann, P. ∙ Novák, P. ∙ Hoštáková, N. ... Systematic survey of plant LTR-retrotransposons elucidates phylogenetic relationships of their polyprotein domains and provides a reference for element classification Mobile DNA. 2019; 10 :1 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Viridiplantae_version_3.0) and then manually identified boundaries of full-length Helitron elements. We identified 111 putative autonomous Helitron s and compared their terminal sequences with TCR1 . This revealed that TCR1 is most similar to the Helitron-27 , sharing 90% and 100% identity over 30-bp sequences at the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively ( Figures 4 J and 4K), meeting the criteria for classification of TCR1 and Helitron-27 into the same family ( Thomas and Pritham, 2015 97. Thomas, J. ∙ Pritham, E.J. Helitrons, the eukaryotic rolling-circle transposable elements Microbiol. Spectr. 2015; 3 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). To find TCR1 insertions in the R. pubera genome, we performed iterative blastn searches using 30-bp sequences from their 5’ and 3’ termini and consensus sequences of Tyba .
To obtain the average number of Tyba arrays for each Rhynchospora genome, we first removed spurious low-quality Tyba monomer annotations with less than 500 bp and merged with bedtools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 76. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (11075) PubMed Google Scholar ) all adjacent Tyba monomers situated at a maximum distance of 50 kb into individual annotations to eliminate the gaps that arise because of fragmented Tyba arrays. Length and distance between Tyba arrays were then calculated using bedtools. Bar plots of the average distance and unit length used to compare the Tyba arrays among the three Rhynchospora species were made in RStudio using ggplot2 ( Wickham, 2016 100. Wickham, H. ggplot2 : elegant graphics for data analysis Use R! Imprint Springer International Publishing, 2016 Google Scholar ) library available at https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2 .
Dyad simmetries detection was performed as reported in Kasinathan and Henikoff (2018) 41. Kasinathan, S. ∙ Henikoff, S. Non-B-form DNA is enriched at centromeres Mol. Biol. Evol. 2018; 35 :949-962 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar . We used EMBOSS palindrome ( Rice et al., 2000 82. Rice, P. ∙ Longden, I. ∙ Bleasby, A. EMBOSS: the European molecular biology open software suite Trends Genet. 2000; 16 :276-277 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) to detect perfect dyad symmetries in the Tyba consensus of the three Rhynchospora species with the following parameters:
-minpallen 4 -maxpallen 100 -gaplimit 20 -nummismatches 0 –overlap
Raw sequencing reads were trimmed by Cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 61. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) to remove low-quality nucleotides (with quality score less than 30) and adapters. Trimmed ChIPed 150-bp single-end reads were mapped to the respective reference genome with bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 49. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (24558) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters, where all read duplicates were removed and only the single best matching read was kept on the final alignment BAM file. BAM files were converted into BIGWIG coverage tracks using the bamCompare tool from deeptools ( Ramírez et al., 2016 77. Ramírez, F. ∙ Ryan, D.P. ∙ Grüning, B. ... deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W160-W165 Crossref Scopus (1768) PubMed Google Scholar ). The coverage was calculated as the number of reads per 50-bp bin and normalized by reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM). Plots of detailed chromosome regions showing multiple tracks presented in Figures 4 and 6 were done with pyGenomeTracks ( Lopez-Delisle et al., 2021 52. Lopez-Delisle, L. ∙ Rabbani, L. ∙ Wolff, J. ... pyGenomeTracks: reproducible plots for multivariate genomic datasets Bioinformatics. 2021; 37 :422-423 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ).
CENH3 domains were identified by comparing the ChIPed and input data using MACS3 ( Zhang et al., 2008 103. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (8144) PubMed Google Scholar ). The parameters for MACS3 included -B –broad –g 1470000000 –trackline. As an alternative method for detection of CENH3 domains, we compared input and ChIP using the epic2 program for detection of diffuse domains ( Stovner and Sætrom, 2019 93. Stovner, E.B. ∙ Sætrom, P. epic2 efficiently finds diffuse domains in ChIP-seq data Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4392-4393 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Parameters for epic2 included—bin-size 2000. Only CENH3 domains detected with both methods were kept for further analysis.
To determine the sizes and positions of centromere units, we merged with bedtools CENH3 peaks that were separated by less than 50 kb to eliminate the gaps that arise because of fragmented Tyba arrays or due to insertion of TEs. Small CENH3 domains of less than 1 kb were discarded. Length and distance between Tyba arrays and between CENH3 domains were then calculated using bedtools. Bar plots of the average distance and unit length used to compare CENH3 domains and Tyba arrays were made in RStudio using the ggplot library.
The obtained repeat annotation was used to evaluate the association of individual classes of repetitive sequences with the CENH3 domain in R. pubera . For each repeat type, we calculated the total abundance in the genome as a sum of repetitive element length and compared it with abundance of repetitive elements located within CENH3 domains. For each type of repetitive element, we calculated the observed/expected ratio using: 𝑂 ⁢ 𝐸 = ∑ ( 𝑅 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐻 ⁢ 3 ) ∑ ( 𝐿 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑁 ⁢ 𝐻 ⁢ 3 𝐿 𝐺 ) ⁢ 𝑅 𝐺 where R CENH3 is length of repeat located within CENH3 domains, L CENH3 is the length of CENH3-binding regions, L G is total genome size, and R G is total length of repeat type in the genome.
To identify groups of paralogous CENH3 domains within the blocks of homologous regions of R. pubera , we identified the two nearest paralogous genes on both sides of each CENH3 domain. Subsequently, the groups of four genes surrounding CENH3 domains were used to identify corresponding regions on the other homologous blocks where we checked for the presence of the CENH3 domain. Resulting groups of four homologous regions were manually inspected using dotplot ( Krumsiek et al., 2007 46. Krumsiek, J. ∙ Arnold, R. ∙ Rattei, T. Gepard: a rapid and sensitive tool for creating dotplots on genome scale Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :1026-1028 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the IGV browser ( Robinson et al., 2011 83. Robinson, J.T. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ∙ Winckler, W. ... Integrative genomics viewer Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :24-26 Crossref Scopus (7238) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To comparatively evaluate the DNA methylation context of a holocentric and monocentric genome, we applied enzymatic methyl-seq and used the Bismarck pipeline ( Krueger and Andrews, 2011 45. Krueger, F. ∙ Andrews, S.R. Bismark: a flexible aligner and methylation caller for bisulfite-Seq applications Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :1571-1572 Crossref Scopus (2332) PubMed Google Scholar ) to analyze the data using the standard pipeline described at https://rawgit.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/master/Docs/Bismark_User_Guide.html . Individual methylation context files for CpG, CHG, and CHH were converted to BIGWIG format and used as input track for overall genome-wide DNA methylation visualization with pyGenomeTracks.
Analysis of the enrichment of all ChIP treatment files was performed as follows: BAM files of each ChIP treatment were normalized to the ChIP Input BAM file by RPKM using bamCompare available from deeptools. The generated normalized BIGWIG files were used to calculate the level of enrichment associated with gene bodies, Tyba repeats, CENH3 domains, and TEs using computeMatrix scale-regions (parameters: --regionBodyLength 4000 –beforeRegionStartLength 2000 –afterRegionStartLength 2000) also available from deeptools. Finally, metaplots for all ChIPseq treatment files were plotted with plotHeatmap available from deeptools ( Ramírez et al., 2016 77. Ramírez, F. ∙ Ryan, D.P. ∙ Grüning, B. ... deepTools2: a next generation web server for deep-sequencing data analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W160-W165 Crossref Scopus (1768) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, coverage BIGWIG files of transcriptional activity (RNAseq) and all DNA methylation contexts were also used to calculated their enrichment on gene bodies, Tyba repeats, CENH3 domains, and TEs with computeMatrix and plotting with plotHeatmap.
To date the two rounds of duplication of the genome of R. pubera , a large tree of concatenated single copy genes was produced. For this analysis, each of the four homologous regions of R. pubera were separated and treated as a tip in the subsequent phylogeny reconstructions. Only coding sequences were used. We used BUSCO ( Poales dataset) ( Seppey et al., 2019 87. Seppey, M. ∙ Manni, M. ∙ Zdobnov, E.M. BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :227-245 Crossref Scopus (703) PubMed Google Scholar ) to look for conserved single-copy genes that are shared by all selected datasets. We performed this analysis in three different ways: solely the large syntenic block (Block1) of R. pubera , solely the smaller syntenic block (Block2) of R. pubera , and the two blocks combined. For the analyses, we included the following nine datasets: J. effusus , C. littledalei , R. tenuis , R. breviuscula , and the four homologous blocks of R. pubera . BUSCO analyses were run for all datasets; all the resulting single-copy genes were selected for each dataset. The single-copy genes shared among all datasets were used for the analyses: 841 for the larger Block1, 400 for the smaller Block2, and 1,204 for the two blocks combined. All genes were then aligned with MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 42. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (20153) PubMed Google Scholar ), trimmed with Trimal ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 8. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (4260) PubMed Google Scholar ), and concatenated into a single large multi-fasta alignment, and used as input for a ML tree built with IQ-tree2 ( Minh et al., 2020 64. Minh, B.Q. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ Chernomor, O. ... IQ-TREE 2: new models and efficient methods for phylogenetic inference in the genomic era Mol. Biol. Evol. 2020; 37 :1530-1534 Crossref Scopus (1807) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A molecular clock analysis was performed to explore genome evolution in Rhynchospora and related genera. Divergence times were estimated using BEAST v.1.10.4 ( Drummond and Rambaut, 2007 18. Drummond, A.J. ∙ Rambaut, A. BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7 :214 Crossref Scopus (9913) PubMed Google Scholar ) through the CIPRES Science Gateway fixing the tree topology from the Bayesian inference of the Rhynchospora concatenated 1,204 BUSCO gene alignment. Uncorrelated relaxed lognormal clock ( Drummond and Rambaut, 2007 18. Drummond, A.J. ∙ Rambaut, A. BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7 :214 Crossref Scopus (9913) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Birth-Death speciation model ( Gernhard, 2008 25. Gernhard, T. The conditioned reconstructed process J. Theor. Biol. 2008; 253 :769-778 Crossref Scopus (662) PubMed Google Scholar ) were applied. Two independent runs of 100,000,000 generations were performed, sampling every 10,000 generations. After removing 25% of samples as burn-in, the independent runs were combined and a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was constructed using TreeAnnotator v.1.10.4 ( Drummond and Rambaut, 2007 18. Drummond, A.J. ∙ Rambaut, A. BEAST: Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7 :214 Crossref Scopus (9913) PubMed Google Scholar ). To verify the effective sampling of all parameters and assess convergence of independent chains, we examined their posterior distributions in TRACER. The MCMC sampling was considered sufficient at effective sampling sizes (ESSs) equal to or higher than 200. The phylogeny was dated using both fossils and secondary calibration from published dated phylogenies. We chose three calibration points: i) Juncaceae/Cyperaceae divergence at 72.0 Mya ( Bremer, 2002 3. Bremer, K. Gondwanan evolution of the grass alliance of families (Poales) Evolution. 2002; 56 :1374-1387 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ); ii) a fossil for Carex at 37.8 MYA ( Smith et al., 2010 89. Smith, S. ∙ Collinson, M. ∙ Rudall, P. ... The Cretaceous and Palaeogene fossil record of Poales: review and current research Seberg, O. ∙ Petersen, G. ∙ Barfod, A. ... (Editors) Diversity, phylogeny, and evolution in monocotyledons. Proceedings of the fourth international conference on the comparative biology of the monocotyledons & the fifth international Aarhus University Press, 2010; 333-356 Google Scholar ), and iii) R. pubera / R. tenuis divergence at 32.0 Mya (Unpublished data).
Interphase nuclei were prepared using the air-drying method, after enzymatic digestion with 2% cellulase Onozuka and 20% pectinase Sigma ( Ribeiro et al., 2017 81. Ribeiro, T. ∙ Marques, A. ∙ Novák, P. ... Centromeric and non-centromeric satellite DNA organisation differs in holocentric Rhynchospora species Chromosoma. 2017; 126 :325-335 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Roots were fixed in Carnoy ethanol:acetic acid 3:1 (v/v) for 2 h and stored at –20 °C. The best slides were selected for FISH, performed as described by Pedrosa et al. (2002) 75. Pedrosa, A. ∙ Sandal, N. ∙ Stougaard, J. ... Chromosomal map of the model legume Lotus japonicus Genetics. 2002; 161 :1661-1672 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and the slides were counterstained with 2 μg/mL DAPI in Vectashield (Vector) mounting buffer. Juncus effusus interphase nucleus was hybridized with directly labeled (FAM)TTTAGGG(8)-telomeric probe and a directly labeled (CY3) probe for its most abundant satellite repeat, while R. breviuscula nucleus was hybridized with the same telomeric probe and directly labeled Tyba (CY3) oligo-probe.
Immunostaining was performed as described before by Marques et al. (2016) 60. Marques, A. ∙ Schubert, V. ∙ Houben, A. ... Restructuring of holocentric centromeres During meiosis in the plant Rhynchospora pubera Genetics. 2016; 204 :555-568 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar with some modifications. Roots or Anthers were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS buffer pH 7.5 (1.3 M NaCl, 70 mM Na2HPO4, 30 mM NaH2PO4) for 1 hr and 30 min and squashed in a drop of the same buffer. Then, the slides were washed in 1× PBS and blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Rabbit anti-H3K4me3 (abcam, ab8580), mouse anti-H3K9me2 (abcam, ab1220), and previously generated R. pubera rabbit anti-CENH3 ( Marques et al., 2015 59. Marques, A. ∙ Ribeiro, T. ∙ Neumann, P. ... Holocentromeres in Rhynchospora are associated with genome-wide centromere-specific repeat arrays interspersed among euchromatin Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :13633-13638 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used for immunostaining. The slides were counterstained with 2 mg/ml 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in Vectashield H-1000.
The chromosomal interactions between holo- and monocentric plant species were compared by the ratios of cis and trans Hi-C contacts, i.e., for each species, we quatified the ratios of cis and trans Hi-C counts for every chromosome and tested if they were significantly different across distinct species. For grouped comparison, we adopted the mutiple testing method of one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), specifically the Kruskal-Wallis ranked test with Holm-Bonferroni correction, because the compared values and ratios of intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts were different in length among various species and were not supported by evidence such as normality. Pair-wise significance analysis was conducted using Dunn’s post hoc test.
The Dunn’s test was used to compare pairwise distributions of values of interest between Tyba arrays and CENH3 domains size and spacing.
