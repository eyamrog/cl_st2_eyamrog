Section: Abstract

The NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat- (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is emerging to be a critical intracellular inflammasome sensor of membrane integrity and a highly important clinical target against chronic inflammation. Here, we report that an endogenous, stimulus-responsive form of full-length mouse NLRP3 is a 12- to 16-mer double-ring cage held together by LRR-LRR interactions with the pyrin domains shielded within the assembly to avoid premature activation. Surprisingly, this NLRP3 form is predominantly membrane localized, which is consistent with previously noted localization of NLRP3 at various membrane organelles. Structure-guided mutagenesis reveals that trans -Golgi network dispersion into vesicles, an early event observed for many NLRP3-activating stimuli, requires the double-ring cages of NLRP3. Double-ring-defective NLRP3 mutants abolish inflammasome punctum formation, caspase-1 processing, and cell death. Thus, our data uncover a physiological NLRP3 oligomer on the membrane that is poised to sense diverse signals to induce inflammasome activation.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that activate inflammatory caspases in response to infection or “damaged-self” signals ( Broz and Dixit, 2016 3. Broz, P. ∙ Dixit, V.M.

Activated caspase-1 in turn processes proinflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms, and all inflammatory caspases can cleave GSDMD, resulting in pore formation, cytokine release, and pyroptotic cell death ( Broz and Dixit, 2016 3. Broz, P. ∙ Dixit, V.M. Inflammasomes: mechanism of assembly, regulation and signalling Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 :407-420 Crossref Scopus (2338) PubMed Google Scholar ). The NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat- (LRR), and pyrin domain (PYD)-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) ( Figure 1 A) senses diverse stimuli, from bacterial toxins (e.g., nigericin) and extracellular ATP to particulate substances (e.g., uric acid crystals and amyloids) ( Liu et al., 2020 32.

Genetic mutations of NLRP3 cause serious auto-inflammatory disorders, including familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Muckle-Wells syndrome ( Hoffman et al., 2001a 22.

Association of NLRP3 with inflammation-driven human diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, and cancer, further underlies its importance as a clinical target ( Collison, 2019 7. Collison, J. Oncogenes and inflammasomes in lupus nephritis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2019; 15 :190 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hamarsheh and Zeiser, 2020 19. Hamarsheh, S. ∙ Zeiser, R.

Biol. 2018; 38 :2765-2779 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
NLRP3 belongs to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and LRR-containing protein (NLR) family. NBD is part of the NACHT domain that also contains helical domain 1 (HD1), winged helix domain (WHD), and helical domain 2 (HD2) ( Wang et al., 2021 67. Wang, L. ∙ Sharif, H. ∙ Vora, S.M. ... Structures and functions of the inflammasome engine J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2021; 147 :2021-2029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). Based on the paradigm established from other NLR proteins such as NLRC4, the inactive state of an NLR is monomeric, and a disk-like oligomer is formed via the NACHT and LRR domains upon inflammasome stimulation ( Wang et al., 2021 67. Wang, L. ∙ Sharif, H. ∙ Vora, S.M. ... Structures and functions of the inflammasome engine J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2021; 147 :2021-2029 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). The disk structure then brings together the effector domains to form a template for engaging the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a capase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) adaptor, which in turn recruits and activates caspase-1. Previously, we used extensive protein engineering to stabilize a monomeric form of PYD-deleted NLRP3 (ΔPYD) ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). This construct was then used to form a complex with NEK7, the centrosomal serine/threonine kinase that plays a scaffolding function in NLRP3 activation ( He et al., 2016 20. He, Y. ∙ Zeng, M.Y. ∙ Yang, D. ...

Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the physiological form of full-length NLRP3 in its native form remained unknown.
In this study, we found that endogenous full-length NLRP3 forms an inactive double-ring cage that is primarily membrane localized, which is consistent with previously reported localization of NLRP3 on various membranous organelles—from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria and Golgi ( Guo et al., 2018 17.

We showed that this cage structure is required to convert an NLRP3-activating stimulus to trans -Golgi network (TGN) dispersion, an established early event in NLRP3 activation ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4.

Virol. 2021; 95 e00826-20 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because dispersed TGN vesicles are further transported to the centrosome (also known as the microtubule-organizing center [MTOC]) to engage the centrosomal NEK7 and form the active NLRP3 inflammasome speck ( Li et al., 2017 31. Li, X. ∙ Thome, S. ∙ Ma, X. ... MARK4 regulates NLRP3 positioning and inflammasome activation through a microtubule-dependent mechanism Nat.

HDAC6 mediates an aggresome-like mechanism for NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasome activation Science. 2020; 369 :eaas8995 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), our studies uncovered the structural basis for this early step in the pathway that licenses NLRP3 activation.

Section: Results

To pursue structure determination of full-length NLRP3 in a physiological form, we stably reconstituted it with N-terminal FLAG and mScarlet tags into HEK293T cells, which do not express inflammasome proteins, and used the cytosolic extract for NLRP3 purification. Anti-FLAG affinity chromatography and FLAG-mScarlet tag removal followed by sucrose gradient revealed large NLRP3 species in heavy sucrose fractions (45%–55%) ( Figure 1 B). Although a small amount of endogenous NEK7 co-eluted with NLRP3, it was mainly in the light fractions, not the heavy fractions ( Figure 1 B). Negative-staining electron microscopy (EM) of the heavy fractions revealed 20- to 25-nm-sized oligomers of NLRP3 ( Figure 1 C) that should be inactive, as we did not stimulate the cells expressing them. Since NLRP3 can be stabilized by ADP and the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ) and deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) was successfully implemented to stabilize the apoptosome ( Zhou et al., 2015 73. Zhou, M. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Hu, Q. ... Atomic structure of the apoptosome: mechanism of cytochrome c- and dATP-mediated activation of Apaf-1 Genes Dev. 2015; 29 :2349-2361 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a plant resistosome ( Wang et al., 2019 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also performed purifications in the presence of these additives, which resulted in similar NLRP3 particles ( Figure 1 C). In addition, the same complexes were observed in the presence of N- or C-terminal tags, indicating that the tags did not interfere with the oligomeric NLRP3 arrangement ( Figure S1 A). We collected cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data on these samples. Two-dimensional classification of these datasets revealed that dATP gave most homogeneous complexes with finer details, as compared to samples in ADP + MCC950 or with no nucleotide ( Figure 1 D); an ATPase activity assay showed that dATP, like ATP, was hydrolyzed by NLRP3 ( Figure S1 B).
Cryo-EM structure determination by three-dimensional reconstruction uncovered striking NLRP3 double-ring cages ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S1 C, S1D, S2 , and S3 ). The ADP- and MCC950-containing sample gave rise to 6-, 7-, and 8-fold complexes with 12, 14, and 16 NLRP3 monomers, respectively ( Figures 1 E, S1 C, and S2 ). These three species are equally distributed indicating heterogeneity in the oligomerization. Despite being at relatively low resolutions (5.8, 7.7, and 9.5 Å for the 6-, 7-, and 8-fold cages, respectively), each NLRP3 monomer with the NACHT and LRR density was clearly recognizable. The 6-fold cage appeared circular from the top view and was refined with the 6-fold symmetry; the 7- and 8-fold cages appeared somewhat elliptical in shape, which disallowed symmetry averaging and thus influenced the resolutions of the complexes ( Figures 1 E and S1 C). The NLRP3 sample purified with dATP gave rise to the major class of a 6-fold double-ring cage structure at 4.2 Å resolution, which was used for model building ( Figures 1 F, S1 D, and S3 ). Local resolution estimation indicated lower resolutions at the NACHT domains, likely indicative of flexibility, as compared to the better resolved LRRs ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S1 C, and S1D). To our surprise, all NLRP3 maps showed presumed density of PYD—the only missing region—inside the NACHT-LRR cage ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S1 C, and S1D), though this domain of NLRP3 was least resolved (see below).
The final atomic model contains NACHT and LRR domains, and we did not model the PYD due to the absence of any specific features in its density. The NLRP3 cage is mainly formed by interactions between the curved LRRs in two interfaces, “face-to-face” and “back-to-back” ( Figures 2 A–2C), with ∼1,200 and ∼500 Å 2 buried surface areas, respectively, as determined by the PISA server ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 30. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (7666) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 A). Unlike active apoptosomes and NLRC4 oligomeric rings ( Dorstyn et al., 2018 12. Dorstyn, L. ∙ Akey, C.W. ∙ Kumar, S.

Cryo-EM structure of the activated NAIP2-NLRC4 inflammasome reveals nucleated polymerization Science. 2015; 350 :404-409 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ) in which the NACHT domains interact extensively, the NACHT domains in the NLRP3 cage are barely in contact. In addition, they assume an inactive conformation almost identical to those in the autoinhibited NLRC4 and the NLRP3–NEK7 complex structures ( Hu et al., 2013 24. Hu, Z. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Liu, P. ... Crystal structure of NLRC4 reveals its autoinhibition mechanism Science. 2013; 341 :172-175 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sharif et al., 2019 54.

Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ), with only a small, 5° rotation relative to the LRR domain ( Figure S4 B), which most probably emerges from the “pulling” on the NACHT domains by PYD-PYD interactions.
The larger “face-to-face” interface in the NLRP3 cage is formed by charged and polar residues interacting in agreement with charge complementarity ( Figures 2 B, S4 C, and S4D). The smaller “back-to-back” interface is less charged, with involvement of many hydrophobic residues ( Figures 2 C, S4 C, and S4E). Mutational analysis revealed that both interfaces are crucial for the double-ring cage formation. Three structure-guided mutants from the “face-to-face” interface (LRRm1: W830A_Y858C; LRRm2: N1008R_R1009E_E1010R_R1013E; and LRRm3: R771E_W773T_R776E) and two from the “back-to-back” interface (LRRm4: D809R_F810A_R813E and LRRm5: H781E_Q782R_F785A) exhibited notable shifts in the sucrose gradient toward lighter fractions in comparison with wild-type (WT) NLRP3 and were impaired in NLRP3 double-ring cage formation shown by negative-staining EM ( Figures 2 D, S5 A, and S5B). Only one mutant, K970E_ Q1001R_ F1029A (LRRm6) from the “face-to-face” interface, showed a similar migration pattern as WT NLRP3 and retained the ability to form the double-ring cage ( Figures 2 D, S5 A, and S5B). Surprisingly, deletion of PYD (ΔPYD) was also sufficient to disrupt the NLRP3 double-ring structure ( Figures 2 D, S5 A, and S5B), indicating that PYDs interact and stabilize the complex despite exhibiting only weak density.
The “face-to-face” interface in the double-ring cage overlaps with the NEK7-binding surface, and superposition of the NLRP3-NLRP3 complex with the NLRP3−NEK7 complex indicates a steric clash between NEK7 and an LRR ( Figure 2 E). We thus wondered whether NEK7 competes with cage formation. To address this question, we incubated excess recombinant NEK7 with the purified NLRP3 cage followed by sucrose gradient. This experiment showed that NEK7 addition resulted in a decrease of the peak for the NLRP3 cage and induced the appearances of smaller NLRP3 species ( Figures 2 F and S5 C), which suggested that NEK7 competed and partly dissociated the double-ring cage, as also supported by negative-staining EM ( Figure 2 G). However, NEK7 is a centrosomal kinase and resides predominately on the MTOC in interphase cells ( Kim et al., 2007 28. Kim, S. ∙ Lee, K. ∙ Rhee, K. NEK7 is a centrosomal kinase critical for microtubule nucleation Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 360 :56-62 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Magupalli et al., 2020 34.

Thus, NLRP3 may not engage NEK7 in resting cells; it colocalized with NEK7 once it was trafficked to the MTOC upon inflammasome stimulation ( Li et al., 2017 31. Li, X. ∙ Thome, S. ∙ Ma, X. ...

NLRP3 activation and mitosis are mutually exclusive events coordinated by NEK7, a new inflammasome component Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :250-258 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ) was likely largely due to the cell lysis when proteins from different compartments encounter each other. We hypothesize that this spatial separation of NLRP3 and NEK7 in the resting state serves as one of the mechanisms to avoid premature activation of NLRP3. Of note, NEK7 interaction is not the only requirement for NLRP3 inflammasome formation; a conformational change to an active conformation in the NLRP3 NACHT domain also needs to occur at a certain step after stimulation ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ...

Adv. 2021; 7 :eabf4468 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) to allow the assembly of an oligomeric, active NLRP3−NEK7 inflammasome at the MTOC.
Although the NACHT domain conformation of the NLRP3 monomer within the double-ring cage suggests that the observed oligomeric complex is inactive ( Figure S4 B), the extra density ( Figures S1 C and S1D) and the role of the PYD in double-ring cage formation ( Figure 2 D) imply a possibility that the cage contains oligomerized PYD and might be capable of initiating ASC PYD filament assembly. Therefore, we investigated whether NLRP3 cages could induce ASC PYD oligomerization using fluorescence quenching of Alexa 488-labeled ASC PYD upon filament formation ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S5 D–S5F). ASC PYD alone exhibited a low oligomerization rate in the absence of any nucleator. When mixed with NLRP6 PYD-NACHT or NLRP3 PYD-NACHT shown previously to nucleate its filament formation ( Lu et al., 2014 33. Lu, A. ∙ Magupalli, V.G. ∙ Ruan, J. ...

Shen, C. ∙ Lu, A. ∙ Xie, W.J. ... Molecular mechanism for NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2052-2057 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), ASC PYD exhibited increased initial rates of fluorescence quenching indicative of increased oligomerization in a manner dependent on NLRP6 PYD-NACHT concentrations (375 nM to 1 μM) ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S5D) or NLRP3 PYD-NACHT concentrations (600 nM to 3 μM) ( Figures S5 E and S5F). However, the same concentrations of the NLRP3 cages were unable to nucleate ASC PYD filament formation ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S5 E), confirming that the double-ring cage is inactive not only in its NACHT domain conformation, but also in its ability to nucleate ASC.
We attempted to fit the presumed PYD density inside the double-ring cavity with two short helical models of PYD filaments composed of 6, 7, or 8 subunits each in the 6-, 7-, or 8-fold NLRP3 double-ring cage ( Figures 3 C and 3D). There are two potential directions that the short helical segment could fit, with the C-terminal helices (H6) of the PYD oligomer pointing out or pointing in the cavity ( Figure 3 D). With the connectivity of the PYD to the NACHT domain, we chose to place the segments with H6 pointing out to connect more readily to the N terminus of the NACHT domain. Interestingly, directionality of oligomerization has been observed in the death fold family including for PYD ( David et al., 2018 10. David, L. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Ma, J. ...

Commun. 2021; 12 :2735 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the fitting we selected would place the elongating ends of the NLRP3 PYD segments (∼80 × 80 × 5 nm), which interact with ASC PYD , inside the cavity with the filaments straight along the symmetry axis or lying obliquely ( Figure 3 D). Given the narrow opening of the cage (∼5.5 nm), it is tempting to hypothesize that the helical PYD segments are trapped inside, explaining why these cages do not nucleate ASC PYD oligomerization. Together, these observations imply that the cage arrangement may serve as a mechanism to shield PYDs within the NACHT-LRR double ring, thus combining oligomerization and inactivity.
We noticed during the NLRP3 purification that most NLRP3 overexpressed in HEK293T cells were in the membrane pellet rather than the cytosolic extract ( Figure S5 G). Because NLRP3 has been shown to associate with various membranes ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4. Chen, J. ∙ Chen, Z.J.

A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2011; 469 :221-225 Crossref Scopus (4140) PubMed Google Scholar ), we performed NLRP3 purification from the membrane pellet after solubilizing it with the n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside detergent. Visualization of the purified protein using negative-staining EM revealed particles of similar size and shape as observed from the cytosolic extract ( Figure 4 A), suggesting that, despite not being an integral membrane protein, NLRP3 is mainly membrane bound, perhaps as a peripheral membrane protein. Because the cytosolic purification gave cleaner particles, likely due to less membrane contamination, we did not further pursue structure determination of the NLRP3 particles from the membrane purification.
We also examined the cytosolic versus membrane extracts of endogenous NLRP3 from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages (iBMDMs) and found a similar enrichment of NLRP3 in the membrane fraction in comparison with the cytosol fraction ( Figure 4 B). Furthermore, NLRP3 species from the membrane extract migrated mainly in the heavy sucrose fractions, though lighter NLRP3 species were also present ( Figure 4 C). Since we could not purify endogenous, tagless NLRP3, we used native PAGE followed by western blotting to estimate their oligomerization state. We observed that the NLRP3 membrane extract of LPS-treated iBMDMs, despite containing equal amount of NLRP3 with the cytosolic extract due to the loss of the protein during membrane solubilization, displayed a distinct band that ran at the similar position as purified NLRP3 oligomers ( Figure 4 D). By contrast, neither cytosolic nor membrane extract from NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs showed signals on the same anti-NLRP3 western blot. Thus, endogenous NLRP3 from iBMDMs is also mainly membrane bound, and the membrane-localized NLRP3 contains an NLRP3 oligomer similar in size to the purified NLRP3 cage from HEK293T cells.
Interestingly, the cytosolic fraction of LPS-treated WT iBMDMs contained a number of smaller NLRP3 species ( Figure 4 D). Since native PAGE separates proteins based on both mass and charge, we performed blue native PAGE analysis of this fraction, in which proteins are separated by mass ( Figure S5 H). Predominantly monomeric NLRP3 was observed, but dimeric NLPR3 was also present. Together, these data support that, unlike other inflammasome sensors that are cytosolic and monomeric before activation, NLRP3 likely exists in an equilibrium among smaller species and the physiological cage structure on membranes that may be poised to sense NLRP3-activating signals.
To investigate the membrane association of NLRP3, we used a lipid strip assay and found that the purified NLRP3 cage sample bound robustly to mono-, di-, and tri-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides (PtdIns) but not the unphosphorylated PtdIns, as well as phosphatidic acid ( Figure 4 E), similar to the previous data for short NLRP3 peptides ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4. Chen, J. ∙ Chen, Z.J. PtdIns4P on dispersed trans-Golgi network mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2018; 564 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, NLRP3 with its PYD removed showed reduced lipid binding, likely due to the loss of avidity in the interaction ( Figure 4 E) since the construct was monomeric ( Figure S5 I). We further addressed whether membrane association of NLRP3 is crucial for the cage formation using mutagenesis. Because the conserved polybasic region at the PYD to NACHT linker has been shown previously to mediate TGN association ( Figure 4 F) ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4. Chen, J. ∙ Chen, Z.J. PtdIns4P on dispersed trans-Golgi network mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2018; 564 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is predicted to be exposed on the outside of the cage structure ( Figure 3 D), we first mutated the conserved polybasic residues to alanines in the monomeric, PYD-deleted NLRP3 ( Figure 4 F). In comparison with the WT monomeric NLRP3, the linker mutant displayed an even more reduced binding ( Figure 4 E), consistent with the role of these linker residues. We also introduced the same linker mutations to full-length NLRP3. Importantly, although the polybasic region is not at the double-ring-forming interfaces, this linker mutant displayed markedly reduced formation of double-ring cages, shown by sucrose gradient profiles ( Figures 4 G and S5 J) and negative-staining EM ( Figure 4 H), indicating that membrane binding promotes NLRP3 cage formation.
To address whether the loss of interaction with membranes was responsible for the impaired double-ring cage formation in the full-length linker mutant, we targeted it to Golgi as a model membrane source by coupling it to a well-described Golgi-binding pleckstrin homology domain of oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP) ( Balla and Várnai, 2009 2. Balla, T. ∙ Várnai, P. Visualization of cellular phosphoinositide pools with GFP-fused protein-domains Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2009; Chapter 24 Unit 24.24 PubMed Google Scholar ). Native PAGE analysis revealed that the OSBP-tag restored the linker mutant for double-ring cage formation on the membrane, while the original linker mutant did not form any large complexes even on the membrane ( Figure S5 K). Further purification of the OSBP-tagged linker mutant (OSBP-linker mutant) from the membrane of reconstituted HEK293T cells revealed the similar double-ring cages as for the membrane-purified WT protein under negative-staining EM ( Figure 4 I; compare to Figure 4 A). We also generated an OSBP-tagged LRRm2 mutant and found that the mutant remained defective in cage formation ( Figure 4 I), indicating that the membrane localization per se is not sufficient and that the cage-forming interfaces are also required. We do not know whether association with a specific membrane or any membrane promotes cage formation. Nonetheless, these data suggest that membranes may serve as a scaffolding platform to promote NLRP3 cage formation. Of note, OSBP tagging did not interfere with function of the WT FLAG-mScarlet-NLRP3 ( Figure S6 A) and restored NLRP3 inflammasome activation of the linker mutant, but not the LRRm2 mutant (see below).
Because our NLRP3 cage is an inactive NLRP3 form, we tested its role in TGN dispersion into small vesicles, an early event previously observed for diverse NLRP3 stimuli and viral infection ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4. Chen, J. ∙ Chen, Z.J. PtdIns4P on dispersed trans-Golgi network mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2018; 564 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ; Daussy et al., 2021 9. Daussy, C.F. ∙ Monard, S.C. ∙ Guy, C. ... The Inflammasome Components NLRP3 and ASC Act in Concert with IRGM To Rearrange the Golgi Apparatus during Hepatitis C Virus Infection J. Virol. 2021; 95 e00826-20 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). In WT iBMDMs, but not NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs, nigericin treatment induced the dispersion of intact TGN from its perinuclear cap-like morphology shown by TGN38 immunofluorescence (IF) and generated NLRP3 inflammasome puncta at the MTOC ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S6 B, and S6C). This effect was validated by another NLRP3 antibody together with an anti-58K Golgi antibody in WT and NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs ( Figures S6 D–S6F) and channel controls ( Figures S6 G–S6I), although residual undispersed 58K Golgi staining remained upon nigericin stimulation due to its localization at both cis - and trans -Golgi. Stable expression of N-terminal mScarlet-tagged NLRP3 in NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs rescued TGN dispersion upon nigericin treatment ( Figure 5 C). Importantly, treatment with the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 ( Coll et al., 2015 5. Coll, R.C. ∙ Robertson, A.A.B. ∙ Chae, J.J. ... A small-molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome for the treatment of inflammatory diseases Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :248-255 Crossref Scopus (1947) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 6.

MCC950 closes the active conformation of NLRP3 to an inactive state Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :560-564 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ) prior to nigericin stimulation did not affect TGN dispersion while blocking NLRP3 activation ( Figures 5 D, S6 J, and S6K). These experiments confirmed that TGN dispersion is an upstream event in NLRP3 activation rather than a consequence of NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis. Moreover, the NLRP3 inflammasome puncta formed upon activation colocalized with the TGN38 marker ( Figures 5 A and 5C)—an effect also observed previously that is likely due to trafficking of TGN vesicles to the MTOC ( Magupalli et al., 2020 34. Magupalli, V.G. ∙ Negro, R. ∙ Tian, Y. ... HDAC6 mediates an aggresome-like mechanism for NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasome activation Science. 2020; 369 :eaas8995 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
To address the functional role of NLRP3 cage formation in NLRP3 activation, we reconstituted NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs with WT FLAG-mScarlet-NLRP3 and four representative cage-disrupting mutants—two at the larger “face-to-face” interface (LRRm2 and LRRm3), one at the smaller “back-to-back” interface (LRRm5), and one with ΔPYD—and imaged the cells for NLRP3, ASC, and 58K Golgi and Hoechst upon LPS priming or further nigericin stimulation ( Figures 5 E–5I). Mouse anti-58K Golgi was used instead of rabbit anti-TGN38 to allow simultaneous staining for ASC, which also utilized a rabbit antibody. In WT NLRP3-reconstituted NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs, TGN dispersed upon nigericin treatment, and the NLRP3 and ASC inflammasome specks also contained 58K Golgi ( Figure 5 E), further supporting the trafficking of TGN vesicles. In NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs reconstituted with the four cage-defective mutants, impaired TGN dispersion and defective inflammasome punctum formation were observed upon nigericin treatment ( Figures 5 F–5I). Of note, such impairment in TGN dispersion emerged solely from disruption of NLRP3 cage and did not correlate with lower expression levels of NLRP3 ( Figure S6 L). Indeed, even lower expressing NLRP3 with intact cage formation (e.g., WT NLRP3 or OSBP-linker mutant) was capable to induce TGN dispersion, while higher expressing cage-deficient mutants were defective in TGN dispersion.
We used OSBP-linked NLRP3 linker mutant and LRRm2 mutant to further dissect the role of the NLRP3 cage in NLRP3 activation. While the linker mutant, which was defective in cage formation ( Figure 4 H), also reduced TGN dispersion and inflammasome punctum formation ( Figure 5 J), the OSBP-linker mutant, which was able to form the cage structure ( Figure 4 I), mediated TGN dispersion and inflammasome punctum formation upon nigericin stimulation ( Figure 5 K). By contrast, OSBP did not rescue cage formation of the LRRm2 mutant ( Figure 4 I) and did not induce TGN dispersion and inflammasome punctum formation upon nigericin stimulation ( Figure S6 M). Thus, the double-ring cage structure is required for nigericin-induced TGN dispersion and NLRP3 activation.
Quantified percentages of cells with TGN dispersion upon nigericin stimulation from the microscopy images exceeded 90% for WT iBMDMs, NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs reconstituted with WT NLRP3 and NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs reconstituted with OSBP-linker mutant ( Figure 6 A). Importantly, pre-treatment of WT iBMDMs with MCC950 prior to NLRP3 activation did not reduce TGN dispersion ( Figure 6 A). 38% of the linker mutant-reconstituted iBMDMs exhibited TGN dispersion, and iBMDMs reconstituted with the remaining mutants showed even less TGN dispersion upon nigericin stimulation (≤18%) ( Figure 6 A). Further assessment of inflammasome activation from caspase-1 processing by western blotting ( Figure S7 A) and cell death by release of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ( Figure 6 B) was consistent with the degrees of TGN dispersion. Importantly, at least LRRm2 and LRRm5 retained similar NEK7 interaction as the WT ( Figure S7 B), further supporting that their defective functions are due to impaired ability to disperse TGN. Thus, TGN dispersion and inflammasome activation upon nigericin treatment is dependent on cage-forming NLRP3.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

In summary, our discovery of a double-ring cage structure of full-length NLRP3 sheds light on how the NLRP3 activation pathway may be organized. First, at its constitutive state without stimulation, NLRP3 is already mainly localized on membranes, and the membrane association acts as a scaffolding platform to promote the assembly of an inactive cage structure that is likely in equilibrium with inactive smaller species. This observation is consistent with a resting-state oligomer implicated previously by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ( Compan et al., 2012 8. Compan, V. ∙ Baroja-Mazo, A. ∙ López-Castejón, G. ... Cell volume regulation modulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation Immunity. 2012; 37 :487-500 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, the observed double-ring cage shields the signal transducing PYDs within the assembly and thus prevents premature ASC recruitment. This strategy of using a “cage” to restrict protein activity is a recurring theme in biology, e.g., in the DegP and the proteasome system in which the proteolytic activity is caged inside the oligomers ( Groll and Clausen, 2003 16. Groll, M. ∙ Clausen, T. Molecular shredders: how proteasomes fulfill their role Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13 :665-673 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 2008 25. Jiang, J. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Activation of DegP chaperone-protease via formation of large cage-like oligomers upon binding to substrate proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :11939-11944 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). We do not know exactly which membrane these NLRP3 cages reside; however, TGN membrane localization of NLRP3 is visible before nigericin stimulation ( Figure 5 ), and additional NLRP3 may be recruited to the TGN upon nigericin treatment as suggested previously ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4. Chen, J. ∙ Chen, Z.J. PtdIns4P on dispersed trans-Golgi network mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2018; 564 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because almost all NLRP3-activating stimuli converge to K + efflux ( Muñoz-Planillo et al., 2013 42. Muñoz-Planillo, R. ∙ Kuffa, P. ∙ Martínez-Colón, G. ... K + efflux is the common trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by bacterial toxins and particulate matter Immunity. 2013; 38 :1142-1153 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1570) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yaron et al., 2015 68. Yaron, J.R. ∙ Gangaraju, S. ∙ Rao, M.Y. ... K(+) regulates Ca(2+) to drive inflammasome signaling: dynamic visualization of ion flux in live cells Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6 :e1954 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is reasonable that a drop in intracellular K + concentration could enhance charged interactions and TGN recruitment of NLRP3.
Second, all cage-disrupting mutants of NLRP3 were defective in mediating TGN dispersion to stop the pathway at this early event common to many NLRP3 stimulations ( Chen and Chen, 2018 4. Chen, J. ∙ Chen, Z.J. PtdIns4P on dispersed trans-Golgi network mediates NLRP3 inflammasome activation Nature. 2018; 564 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). Though the exact mechanism of the NLRP3 cage-mediated TGN dispersion remains undiscovered, both inactive and presumed active NACHT conformations are compatible with the double-ring structure ( Figure 7 ), and NLRP3 does not require a conformational change in its NACHT domain to support TGN dispersion. Indeed, MCC950, which was shown to block inflammasome activation by keeping NLRP3 in a “closed” inactive conformation ( Coll et al., 2015 5. Coll, R.C. ∙ Robertson, A.A.B. ∙ Chae, J.J. ...

Biol. 2019; 15 :560-564 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not interfere with nigericin-induced TGN dispersion. On the other hand, gain-of-function NLRP3 disease mutants such as R258W (human R260W), which are supposed to be in an active conformation, require NEK7 to signal ( He et al., 2016 20. He, Y. ∙ Zeng, M.Y. ∙ Yang, D. ... NEK7 is an essential mediator of NLRP3 activation downstream of potassium efflux Nature. 2016; 530 :354-357 Crossref Scopus (880) PubMed Google Scholar ) and induce TGN dispersion when overexpressed in HEK293T cells without stimulation ( Tapia-Abellán et al., 2019 61. Tapia-Abellán, A. ∙ Angosto-Bazarra, D. ∙ Martínez-Banaclocha, H. ... MCC950 closes the active conformation of NLRP3 to an inactive state Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :560-564 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). During the preparation of this manuscript, a complementary preprint on human NLRP3 decamer cage in complex with MCC950 was released ( Hochheiser et al., 2021 21. Hochheiser, I.V. ∙ Pilsl, M. ∙ Hagelueken, G. ... Cryo-EM structure of the NLRP3 decamer bound to the cytokine release inhibitory drug CRID3 bioRxiv. 2021; 2021.2007.2022.453353 Google Scholar ). Together, these findings suggest that the inactive conformation of NLRP3 within the cage is compatible with its hypothesized role in TGN dispersion.
Third, we hypothesize that NLRP3 cage serves as a sensor coupling NLRP3-activating stimuli with NLRP3 transport on TGN vesicles to its activation center at the MTOC ( Li et al., 2017 31. Li, X. ∙ Thome, S. ∙ Ma, X. ... MARK4 regulates NLRP3 positioning and inflammasome activation through a microtubule-dependent mechanism Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15986 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ; Magupalli et al., 2020 34. Magupalli, V.G. ∙ Negro, R. ∙ Tian, Y. ... HDAC6 mediates an aggresome-like mechanism for NLRP3 and pyrin inflammasome activation Science. 2020; 369 :eaas8995 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Without TGN dispersion, there would have been no NLRP3-containing vesicles to transport. Thus, by controlling TGN dispersion, the NLRP3 cage licenses NLRP3 transport and subsequent activation. If NLRP3 gets transported to MTOC in the form of the double-ring cage, it is tempting to propose that once reaching the MTOC, the resident protein NEK7 might break the NLRP3 cage on TGN vesicles to enable further conformational rearrangement. However, we do not know when and where the NACHT domain changes to its active state that is likely needed for oligomerization of the NLRP3–NEK7 complex ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tapia-Abellán et al., 2021 62. Tapia-Abellán, A. ∙ Angosto-Bazarra, D. ∙ Alarcón-Vila, C. ... Sensing low intracellular potassium by NLRP3 results in a stable open structure that promotes inflammasome activation Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabf4468 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because several phosphorylation sites have been reported for NLRP3 ( Spalinger et al., 2016 57. Spalinger, M.R. ∙ Kasper, S. ∙ Gottier, C. ... NLRP3 tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 J. Clin. Invest. 2016; 126 :1783-1800 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stutz et al., 2017 58. Stutz, A. ∙ Kolbe, C.C. ∙ Stahl, R. ... NLRP3 inflammasome assembly is regulated by phosphorylation of the pyrin domain J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1725-1736 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2017 70. Zhang, Z. ∙ Meszaros, G. ∙ He, W.T. ... Protein kinase D at the Golgi controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2671-2693 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also mapped these residues onto the NLRP3 model ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Residues S3 in the PYD and Y858 in the LRR were shown to inhibit NLRP3 activation when phosphorylated ( Spalinger et al., 2016 57. Spalinger, M.R. ∙ Kasper, S. ∙ Gottier, C. ... NLRP3 tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 J. Clin. Invest. 2016; 126 :1783-1800 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stutz et al., 2017 58. Stutz, A. ∙ Kolbe, C.C. ∙ Stahl, R. ... NLRP3 inflammasome assembly is regulated by phosphorylation of the pyrin domain J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :1725-1736 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). S3 situates at a PYD-PYD interface in an NLRP3 filament model derived from the ASC PYD filament structure ( Lu et al., 2014 33. Lu, A. ∙ Magupalli, V.G. ∙ Ruan, J. ... Unified polymerization mechanism for the assembly of ASC-dependent inflammasomes Cell. 2014; 156 :1193-1206 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1011) PubMed Google Scholar ), and its phosphorylation may inhibit cage formation due to loss of the PYD-PYD interaction, as well as ASC recruitment ( Figure S7 C). Similarly, Y858 participates in the LRR-LRR interaction and its phosphorylation may disrupt the NLRP3 cage, TGN dispersion, and NLRP3 activation ( Figure S7 D). Residue S803 at the LRR was shown to be phosphorylated during priming but dephosphorylated during NLRP3 activation to enable NEK7 binding ( Niu et al., 2021 43. Niu, T. ∙ De Rosny, C. ∙ Chautard, S. ... NLRP3 phosphorylation in its LRR domain critically regulates inflammasome assembly Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :5862 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). S803 is located close to positively charged residues from the adjacent LRR (e.g., R1009), and the phosphorylation may stabilize NLRP3 cage to support TGN dispersion ( Figure S7 D). Consistent with the negative effects or the priming dependence of the phosphorylation events, mass spectrometry analysis found that our sample was not phosphorylated at Y858 or S803 ( Figure S7 E).
Finally, some reports suggested that certain LRR-lacking NLRP3 variants can also form active inflammasomes ( Hafner-Bratkovič et al., 2018 18. Hafner-Bratkovič, I. ∙ Sušjan, P. ∙ Lainšček, D. ... NLRP3 lacking the leucine-rich repeat domain can be fully activated via the canonical inflammasome pathway Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5182 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rahman et al., 2020 47. Rahman, T. ∙ Nagar, A. ∙ Duffy, E.B. ... NLRP3 Sensing of Diverse Inflammatory Stimuli Requires Distinct Structural Features Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :1828 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that the NLRP3 cage is formed mainly by LRR-LRR interactions, these NLRP3 variants should not form cages but may still reside on membranes due to their intact polybasic linker region. We hypothesize that they could form smaller active “speckles” on membranes upon stimulation, and that they bypass the transport on microtubules toward MTOC to engage NEK7 but rather rely on the relatively high concentration for their activation under overexpression conditions. Furthermore, NLRP3 in primed human monocytes with enhanced expression could be activated independently of NEK7 and without ASC speck formation at the MTOC ( Gaidt et al., 2016 14. Gaidt, M.M. ∙ Ebert, T.S. ∙ Chauhan, D. ... Human Monocytes Engage an Alternative Inflammasome Pathway Immunity. 2016; 44 :833-846 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmacke et al., 2019 52. Schmacke, N.A. ∙ Gaidt, M.M. ∙ Szymanska, I. ... Priming enables a NEK7-independent route of NLRP3 activation bioRxiv. 2019; 799320 Google Scholar ), together suggesting an alternative NEK7-independent NLRP3 pathway. Of note, we expect that the stimuli driving conformational changes in the NACHT domain of NLRP3 may be the same for all pathways. Although further studies are required to test our hypothesis, our findings here provide a mechanistic basis for future exploration of NLRP3 inflammasome trafficking and activation, as well as inform the development of new anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer treatments targeting this early stage of NEK7-dependent NLRP3 activation.
Our study provides insights to mechanism of NLRP3 activation; however, many questions remain. First, it is unclear how NLRP3 cages mediate dispersion of TGN. We expect that other factors connecting NLRP3 cages to the vesicle transporting machine have to be uncovered. Second, we do not know whether NLRP3 cages undergo major conformational changes on TGN-derived vesicles on its way to the MTOC. Structurally, NACHT domains can re-arrange into an open state within the NLRP3 cage, but further studies would be necessary to assess such changes. What we know is that TGN dispersion does not require NACHT rearrangement into an open conformation, given that MCC950 did not abolish TGN dispersion. However, whether NLRP3 cages arrive at the MTOC in the state presented in this study remains unknown. Third, we cannot exclude that other membrane-associated NLRP3 species traveling alongside NLRP3 cages play a role in NLRP3 activation after TGN dispersion. Furthermore, we do not know whether NLRP3 cages play a role in alternative NLRP3 activation pathways. Despite these limitations, our study opens up a new angle to view NLRP3 activation, and we hope that it will encourage future research on these important questions.

WT and NLRP3-knockout (NLRP3 −/− ) immortalized bone marrow–derived macrophages (iBMDMs) were a gift from Prof. K. A. Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA) ( Kalantari et al., 2014 27. Kalantari, P. ∙ DeOliveira, R.B. ∙ Chan, J. ... Dual engagement of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes by plasmodium-derived hemozoin and DNA during malaria Cell Rep. 2014; 6 :196-210 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293T cells and iBMDMs were cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), with L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. no: 10569-004), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. no: 16000-044) at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Cells reconstituted with pLenti CMVie-IRES-BlastR-based constructs were maintained with addition of 5 μg/ml and 1 μg/ml blasticidin (InvivoGen, Cat. no: ant-bl-05) for HEK293T and iBMDMs, respectively.
Full-length, PYD-deficient (aa 126-1033, ΔPYD) and LRR-deficient (aa 1-665, NLRP3 PYD-NACHT ) mouse and human NLRP3 were cloned into pLenti CMVie-IRES-BlastR (Addgene plasmid #119863). The resulting constructs were further modified by addition of N-terminal FLAG-tag followed by fluorescent protein mScarlet and Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site upstream of the NLRP3 gene. An additional N-terminal FLAG and pleckstrin homology domain of oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP) domain (aa 87–185) were added to selected constructs. Full-length mouse NLRP3 was also amplified with addition of N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal TEV sequences and cloned into an in-house modified pLV-eGFP vector, in which eGFP was replaced by mNeonGreen (mNG), for FLAG-NLRP3-TEV-mNG expression. Full length mouse NEK7 were cloned into a modified pET28a vector with an N-terminal 6 × His-SUMO tag followed by the Ulp1 protease site. Constructs encoding monomeric MBP-tagged NLRP3 NACHT-LRR (aa 134-1034) and containing human NLRP6 PYD-NACHT (aa 1-564) in pDB-His-MBP vector were described before ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shen et al., 2019 55. Shen, C. ∙ Lu, A. ∙ Xie, W.J. ... Molecular mechanism for NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2052-2057 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Monomeric MBP-tagged NLRP3 NACHT-LRR (aa 134-1034) was subcloned into pLenti CMVie-IRES-BlastR (Addgene plasmid #119863) with addition of N-terminal FLAG-tag. The S106C mutant of human ASC PYD (aa1-106) was cloned into an in-house modified pET28-MBP-TEV vector (Addgene, plasmid #69929), in which N-terminal His 6 tag was added for expression of proteins with a cleavable N-terminal His 6 -MBP-tag, based on previously described constructs ( Lu et al., 2014 33. Lu, A. ∙ Magupalli, V.G. ∙ Ruan, J. ... Unified polymerization mechanism for the assembly of ASC-dependent inflammasomes Cell. 2014; 156 :1193-1206 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1011) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ASC PYD S106C mutant was used for thiol-labeling by Alexa488. Point mutations were introduced with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol using Q5 High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (NEB) (see primer sequences in Table S1 ). NLRP3 mutants were named: LRRm1 for mouse W830A_Y858C and human W833A_Y861C, LRRm2 for mouse N1008R_R1009E_E1010R_R1013E and human N1011R_Y1012A_R1013E_S1016A, LRRm3 for mouse R771E_W773T_R776E and human R774E_W776A_R779E, LRRm4 for mouse D809R_F810A_R813E and human D812R_F813A_R816E, LRRm5 for mouse H781E_Q782R_F785A and human H784E_E785R_F788A, and LRRm6 for mouse K970E_ Q1001R_ F1029A and human K973E_F1032A.
For lentivirus preparation HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid containing the construct of interest, 750 ng psPAX2 packaging plasmid and 250 ng pMD2.G envelope plasmid (Addgene plasmids #12260 and #12259). On the following day the virus-containing medium was collected and filtered using 0.45 μm filter (Millipore Sigma, Cat. no: SLHVM33RS). Fresh HEK293T cells were infected by adding the lentivirus-containing medium to culture medium followed by 1 to 2 day incubation. iBMDMs NLRP3 −/− were infected with the spinfection protocol as follows. The cells were resuspended in the lentivirus-containing medium with addition of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. no: sc-134220) and centrifuged for 90 min at 2,500 g at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded, and infected cells were incubated in fresh medium for 48 h followed by the second round of spinfection. Positive cells expressing mScarlet-tagged constructs were selected by cell sorting at BD FACSAria Fusion or FACSAria II cell sorter equipped with 100 μm nozzle 20 psi or 85 μm nozzle 45 psi depending on the experiment. The sorted populations were gated to exclude dead and non-fluorescent cells.
Full-length mouse NEK7 was purified as described before ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). Full-length mouse NLRP3 was purified from 240 150 mm dishes of HEK293T cells stably expressing FLAG-mScarlet-tagged NLRP3. Trials with HEK293 suspension cells (293F and Expi293) did not yield well behaving NLRP3 proteins. Cells were harvested at 80%–90% confluency, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pelleted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, Cat. no: S8830) and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) shortly before usage. Cells were sonicated (3 s on, 8 s off, 3 min total on, 40% power, Branson), centrifuged at 42,000 RPM for 1 h (45 Ti fixed-angle rotor, Beckman), and the supernatant was used for affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, Cat. no: A2220) by gravity flow. For purification from the membrane, the pellet after sonication was resuspended in the same amount of the lysis buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside and incubated for 2 h. For a comparison of NLRP3 amount between cytosolic and membrane fractions in Figure S5 J equal volumes of supernatant and resuspended membrane pellet were loaded for a WB using anti-NLRP3 (1:2,000, Adipogen, Cat. no: AG-20B-0014-C100) antibody. Incubation with detergent was then followed by centrifugation at 21,000 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for affinity purification with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, Cat. no: A2220). The beads were washed with 50 column volumes (CV) of the same buffer and the protein was eluted with 100 μg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (ApexBio, Cat. no: A6001). The eluted protein was incubated with 0.5 mM ADP and 0.5 mM MCC950 (Millipore Sigma, Cat. no: 538120), 0.5 mM dATP or no additives for 30 min on ice, followed by incubation or not with TEV protease for 30 min at 30°C to remove the tag. For Figure S10 the elution was additionally incubated with 10 μM NEK7 for 5 h on ice. The mixture was loaded onto a step-gradient of 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% and 55% sucrose in 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, Cat. no: S8830) and 1 mM TCEP and centrifuged for 16 h at 40,000 rpm (MLS-50 swinging-bucket rotor, Beckman). Fractions of 750 μL were collected manually and NLRP3-containing fractions were merged and buffer-exchanged with Zeba™ spin desalting columns (Fisher Scientific, Cat. no: PI87771) equilibrated with the buffer containing 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM TCEP, supplemented with 0.2 mM of the same nucleotides or additives used prior to the sucrose gradient. NEK7 in these fractions was visualized by western blotting using mouse anti-NEK7 antibody (1:2,000, Santa Cruz, Cat. no: sc-393539) and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:2,000, Cell Signaling, Cat. no: 7076S).
For Figure S1 MBP-tagged NLRP3 NACHT-LRR was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system and purified as described previously ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ). One liter of Sf9 with density of 3x10 6 cells/ml was infected with 1% v/v of baculovirus. 48 h post-infection cells were collected and lysed by sonication (3 s on, 8 s off, 3 min total on, 40% power, Branson) in a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, Cat. no: S8830) and 1 mM TCEP shortly before usage. The lysate was centrifuged at 42,000 RPM for 1 h (45 Ti fixed-angle rotor, Beckman), and the supernatant was used for affinity chromatography with MBP beads by gravity flow. The protein was eluted with 10 mM maltose solution in the lysis buffer and further purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP.

One liter of 3x106 cells/ml was transfected with 1 mg plasmid using polyethylenimine (3 mg/l) as transfection reagent. 24 h post-transfection cells were supplemented with glucose (9 mL, 45%) and valproic acid (10 mL, 300 mM) and harvested 4 days after transfection. The construct was further purified as described for the full-length mouse NLRP3 without adding nucleotides.
NLRP6 PYD-NACHT protein was expressed and purified as described before ( Shen et al., 2019 55. Shen, C. ∙ Lu, A. ∙ Xie, W.J. ... Molecular mechanism for NLRP6 inflammasome assembly and activation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2052-2057 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, the protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) at 18°C overnight following the induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were lysed by sonication in 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 1 h (SA-600, Sorvall) and the supernatant was used for Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP.
ASC PYD with the S106C mutation was expressed as a His 6 -MBP fusion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) at 18°C overnight following the induction with 0.1 mM IPTG. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM TCEP and centrifuged at 40,000 RPM for 1 h (45 Ti fixed-angle rotor, Beckman). Supernatant was incubated with amylose beads pre-equilibrated in the same buffer for 1 h at 4°C and loaded onto a gravity flow column. The beads were washed with 50 CV of the same buffer and eluted with 50 mM maltose. The eluted protein was fluorescently labeled at the C106 thiol group by incubation with a 2-fold access of AlexaFluor 488 C 5 -maleimide (ThermoFisher, Cat. no: A10254) at 4°C overnight. The labeled protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM TCEP.
For negative staining 5 μl of NLRP3 sample was placed on a copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, cat. no: FCF400CU50), incubated for 1 min, washed twice with buffer containing 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl, stained with 2% uranyl formate for 30 s and air-dried. The images were collected at a Tecnai G2 Spirit BioTWIN Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) equipped with AMT 2k CCD camera at 49,000x magnification and 120 keV (HMS EM core facility).
A 4 μl drop containing NLRP3 complex was applied to a Lacey Carbon grid with ultrathin carbon support (Ted Pella, Cat. no: 01824G), incubated for 1-1.5 min, blotted for 3 s, plunged into liquid ethane, and flash frozen using a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV at 100% humidity and 4°C. Grid conditions were optimized during extensive screening at Pacific Northwest Center for Cryo-EM at Oregon Health & Science University (PNCC), the University of Massachusetts Cryo-EM Core (UMASS) and the Harvard Cryo-EM Center for Structural Biology (HMS) using FEI Talos Arctica (ThermoFisher) microscopes equipped with an autoloader (200 keV, Gatan K3 direct electron detector). Detailed cryo-EM data collection settings are summarized in Table S2 .
Final datasets were collected at HMS using a Titan Krios microscope (ThermoFisher) operating at 300 keV and equipped with a BioQuantum Imaging Filter (Gatan) and K3 direct electron detector (Gatan). Automated data collection was performed using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 38. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3221) PubMed Google Scholar ) software, and the movies were obtained in counting mode at 105,000x magnification (0.825 Å/pix). Data quality for each dataset was assessed with on-the-fly data processing algorithm designed by Shaun Rawson for HMS facility. For NLRP3 sample purified in the presence of ADP and MCC950 23,560 movies with 50 frames each were recorded at multiple defocus values from −0.8 to −2.5 μm and with multiple exposures per stage shift (5x4) introduced with image shift. Each movie was acquired at a dose rate 18.194 e/s per physical pixel and accumulated a total dose of 53.46 e/Å 2 over 2 s total exposure time. For NLRP3 sample purified in the presence of dATP 6,800 movies with 50 frames each were recorded at multiple defocus values from −0.8 to −2.4 μm and with multiple exposures per stage shift (5x4) introduced with image shift. Each movie was acquired at a dose rate 23.951 e/s per physical pixel and accumulated a total dose of 53.225 e/Å 2 over 1.51 s total exposure time.
Cryo-EM data processing software and support was provided by SBGrid consortium ( Morin et al., 2013 41. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software eLife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (683) PubMed Google Scholar ). Raw movies were corrected by gain reference and beam-induced motion and combined into a motion-corrected micrograph using the MotionCorr2 algorithm ( Zheng et al., 2017 71. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ). The defocus value for each micrograph was determined with CTFFIND4( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 48. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2867) PubMed Google Scholar ). Automated particle picking was performed with crYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 64. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (658) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a general model (optimized in HMS facility).
A dataset of NLRP3 purified in the presence of ADP and MCC950 yielded 1,376,027 particles picked by crYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 64. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (658) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were extracted with 2x binning resulting in 1.65 Å pixel size. Initial rounds of 2D classifications were performed in Relion3.1 ( Scheres, 2012 50. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zivanov et al., 2018 74. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ), after which the 2D classes were manually sorted into 6-fold, 7-fold and 8-fold species (190,566, 222,359 and 170,877 particles, respectively), imported into cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ) and processed separately. For each species 3 initial models were generated with ab initio reconstruction. The best model was then used for 3D classification after a 35 Å low-pass-filtering in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the heterogenous refinement mode for 3 or more outputs. The best 3D classes with the least particle distortion were merged and used for the non-uniform 3D refinement using symmetry D6 for a 6-fold double ring cage or C1 for 7- and 8-fold double ring cages, which resulted in final cryo-EM maps at 5.8 Å, 7.7 Å and 9.5 Å resolutions generated from 59,107, 174,967 and 108,875 particles, respectively. The described cryo-EM workflow for this dataset is also presented in Figure S2 with gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) for each map. Local resolution estimation was calculated with Local Resolution Estimation module in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ). Post-processing of a 6-fold double ring cage map was performed with DeepEMhancer ( Sanchez-Garcia et al., 2020 49. Sanchez-Garcia, R. ∙ Gomez-Blanco, J. ∙ Cuervo, A. ... DeepEMhancer: a deep learning solution for cryo-EM volume post-processing bioRxiv. 2020; 2020.2006.2012.148296 PubMed Google Scholar ).
A dataset of NLRP3 purified in the presence of dATP yielded 845,243 particles picked by crYOLO ( Wagner et al., 2019 64. Wagner, T. ∙ Merino, F. ∙ Stabrin, M. ... SPHIRE-crYOLO is a fast and accurate fully automated particle picker for cryo-EM Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :218 Crossref Scopus (658) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were extracted with no binning resulting in 0.825 Å pixel size. Further processing was performed in Relion 3.1 ( Scheres, 2012 50. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zivanov et al., 2018 74. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extracted particles were subjected to multiple 2D classifications until the classes appeared homogeneous. Initial model was built with de novo reconstruction, low-pass-filtered to 40 Å and used for subsequent multiple rounds of 3D classification and refinement. The refinement of the best class containing 122,941 particles using D6 symmetry resulted in a 4.3 Å map, which could be further improved up to 4.2 Å by multiple rounds of per-particle CTF refinement followed by 3D refinement in D6. Bayesian polishing or beam tilt CTF refinement did not result in any further improvement ( Zivanov et al., 2019 75. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W.

The atomic model was built using cryo-EM map obtained from the NLRP3 complex purified in the presence of dATP (4.2 Å). 12 molecules of NLRP3 NACHT-LRR without NEK7 from the structure of the NLRP3:NEK7 complex ( Sharif et al., 2019 54. Sharif, H. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Wang, W.L. ... Structural mechanism for NEK7-licensed activation of NLRP3 inflammasome Nature. 2019; 570 :338-343 Crossref Scopus (484) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PDB: 6NPY ) were first fit into the cryo-EM map using UCSF-Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45.

Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ) rigid body fit. From each chain NBD-HD1-WHD (aa 133-535) and LRR (aa 738-1034) segments were extracted. Residues corresponding to the mouse NLRP3 sequence different from the human model were mutated in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 13. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the rotamers were selected to position the side chains close to those from 6NPY NLRP3 model resulting in mouse NBD-HD1-WHD (aa 131-533) and LRR (aa 737-1033) fragments. HD2 (aa 534-736) segment was extracted from the AlphaFold prediction of mouse NLRP3 structure ( Jumper et al., 2021 26. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16923) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unstructured loops were removed in Coot ( Jumper et al., 2021 26. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16923) PubMed Google Scholar ) and all domains were fitted separately into the cryo-EM map in UCSF-Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to the modest resolution (4.2 Å) no further manual adjustments of the model were performed and the model was subjected to real-space refinement in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The final model represents a mouse NLRP3 dodecamer and includes residues Asp131-Trp1033 of each monomer. Interface analysis of the resulting model was performed with PISA ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 30. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (7666) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structure representations were generated using ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 15.

At 0 min and 1 h the sample was analyzed for concentrations of inorganic monophosphates with the ATPase/GTPase Activity Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no: MAK113-1KT) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
2 μM of Alexa488-conjugated His 6 -MBP-TEV-ASC PYD (S106C) was mixed with NLRP3 cage, NLRP6 PYD-NACHT or NLRP3 PYD-NACHT at different concentrations in buffer containing 30 mM HEPES at pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.2 mM dATP, in black round-bottom 384-well plate (Corning, Cat. no: 3820) with a 20 μl final volume. Reaction was initiated by addition of TEV protease at 0.5 mg/ml final concentration. Fluorescence was measured at 25°C using Synergy NEO HTS Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek) with excitation and emission wavelengths 420 nm and 485 nm, respectively. The initial linear intervals of the fluorescence curves were used to calculate the polymerization rate for each sample as relative fluorescence units (RFU)/minute.
Lipid binding assay with purified NLRP3 variants was performed using PIP strip (Echelon Biosciences, Cat. no: P-6001) according to manufacturer instructions. In short, the PIP strip membranes were blocked using 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h following by incubation with 30 μl NLRP3 FLAG-tagged proteins (0.5 μM) diluted in 3% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h. Next, the membranes were washed in PBS-T for 40 min and the bound proteins were visualized with anti-FLAG-HRP antibodies (1:10000 in PBS-T for 1h, Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no: A8592). All steps were performed at room temperature. All samples were analyzed at the same time under the same conditions.
HEK293T cells reconstituted with NLRP3 mutants and WT and NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs were seeded on 150 mm plates at 5x10 6 cells/plate. On the next day BMDMs were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS (Invivogen, Cat. no: tlrl-b5lps) for 3.5 h. Cells were collected, washed with PBS and resuspended in a buffer containing 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10% glycerol, followed by sonification (3 s on, 8 s off, 1 min total on, 40% power, Branson) and centrifugation at 36,000 rpm (MLA-50 fixed-angle rotor, Beckman) for 1 h. Membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer and protein extraction was performed by adding 1% n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (w/v) followed by incubation for 2 h and centrifugation at 21,000 g for 30 min. Supernatants were loaded on a 3%–12% Bis-Tris gel (ThermoFisher, Cat. no: BN1003BOX) and the Native PAGE was run at 100 V for 4 h at 4°C using Native PAGE running buffer (ThermoFisher, Cat. no: BN2001) without or with addition of a Coomassie Blue-G250 containing cathode buffer additive (ThermoFisher, Cat. no: BN2002) for native and blue native PAGE, respectively. NLRP3 and β-actin were visualized by western blotting using anti-NLRP3 (1:2,000, Adipogen, Cat. no: AG-20B-0014-C100) and anti-β-actin (1:2,000, Sigma Aldrich, Cat. no: A2228-100UL) primary antibodies, respectively, followed by anti-mouse-HRP (1:5,000, Cell Signaling, Cat. no: 7076S) secondary antibody.
Cytosolic and membrane extracts of LPS-treated WT iBMDMs were prepared as described in the previous section and were loaded onto a step-gradient of 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% and 50% sucrose in 30 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, Cat. no: S8830) and 1 mM TCEP and centrifuged for 16 h at 40,000 rpm (MLS-50 swinging-bucket rotor, Beckman). Fractions of 750 μL were collected manually and analyzed for the amount of NLRP3 by western blotting using anti-NLRP3 (1:2,000, Adipogen, Cat. no: AG-20B-0014-C100) antibody.
WT iBMDMs were seeded on 150 mm plates at 5x10 6 cells/plate and on the next day treated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Invivogen, Cat. no: tlrl-b5lps) for 3.5 h. Cells were collected, washed with PBS, resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 and 0.25 M Sucrose, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 g to remove nuclei and unlysed cells. The resulting supernatant (whole cell lysate) was further centrifuged at 21,000 g for 30 min resulting in a supernatant and a pellet enriched with cytosolic and membrane proteins, respectively. All fractions in correct proportions were analyzed for NLRP3 by western blotting using anti-NLRP3 (1:2,000, Adipogen, Cat. no: AG-20B-0014-C100) antibody.
WT iBMDMs, NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs or NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs reconstituted with mScarlet-tagged NLRP3 were seeded at 0.5x10 6 cells/well on a 12-well tissue culture plate and on the next day treated or not with 1 μg/ml LPS (Invivogen, Cat. no: tlrl-b5lps) for 3.5 h or with 1 μg/ml LPS for 2.5 h and additionally with 20 μM MCC950 (Millipore Sigma, Cat. no: 538120) for 1h followed by NLRP3 activation with 20 μM nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no: N7143-5MG) for 1 h. The medium was discarded and the whole cell lysates were prepared by adding SDS sample loading buffer (50 mM Tris at pH 7.5, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 150 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1.5 mM bromophenol Blue) directly to the cells. NLRP3, β-actin and cleaved caspase-1 p20 fragment were visualized by western blotting using anti-NLRP3 (1:2000, Adipogen, Cat. no: AG-20B-0014-C100), anti-β-actin (1:2,000, Sigma Aldrich, Cat. no: A2228-100UL) and anti-p20 of caspase-1 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Cat. no: 89332S) primary antibodies, respectively. Anti-mouse-HRP (1:5000, Cell Signaling, Cat. no: 7076S) and anti-rabbit-HRP (1:2,500, Cell signaling, Cat. no: 7074S) secondary antibodies were used.
Cell lines were plated on CELLview 4-compartment dishes (Greiner Bio-One), treated with 1 μg/ml LPS (Invivogen, Cat. no: tlrl-b5lps) for 3.5 h followed or not by NLRP3 activation with 20 μM nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no: N7143-5MG) for 1h with or without a pretreatment with 20 μM MCC950 (Millipore Sigma, Cat. no: 538120) for 1h prior to activation, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min at 4°C and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. Cells were incubated in PBS-Tween containing 3% BSA for 3 h, which minimized non-specific binding. After three washes with PBS-Tween, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. The following antibodies were used: rabbit monoclonal anti-NLRP3 (1:250, Abcam, Cat. no: ab272702), goat polyclonal anti-NLRP3 (1:100, Abcam, Cat. no: 4207), rabbit polyclonal anti-TGN38 (1:500, Novus Biologicals, Cat. no: NBP1-03495), rabbit polyclonal anti-TGN46 (1:500, Abcam, Cat. no: 50595), mouse monoclonal anti-58K Golgi (1:500, Novus Biologicals, Cat. no: NB600-412), sheep polyclonal anti-TGN38 (1:500, Novus Biologicals, Cat. no: NBP1-20263), rabbit polyclonal anti-ASC (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Cat. no: 67824) and mouse monoclonal anti-γ-tubulin (1:500, Abcam, Cat. no: ab11316). After incubation, cells were washed and incubated with AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, ThermoFisher, Cat. no: A27040) and/or Alexa488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:500, ThermoFisher, Cat. no: ab150113) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS (3 × 10 min) and then stained with Hoechst (1:500, Immunochemistry Technologies, Cat. no: 639). For negative controls we used rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, Cat. no: 2027), goat IgG (Santa Cruz, Cat. no: 2028) and sheep IgG (R&D, Cat. no: 5-001-A) at the same concentration for primary antibodies. Moreover, we performed staining with no primary antibodies as an additional control. Cells were imaged using a Nikon Ti inverted microscope fitted with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 Peltier cooled CCD camera and Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera equipped with Plan Apo 100x/1.4 Ph3, Plan Apo 60x/1.3 DIC and Plan Apo 40x/1.3 DIC objectives. Lumencor SpectraX LED illuminator was used. Chroma 49000 (DAPI), Chroma 29002 (green), Chroma 49008 (red) and Chroma 49011 (far red) filter cubes were used. Image analysis was performed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 51. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40013) PubMed Google Scholar ).
WT iBMDMs, NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs and NLRP3 −/− iBMDMs reconstituted with human WT and mutant mScarlet-NLRP3 were seeded at 2.5x10 6 cells/well on a 96-well tissue culture plate overnight. On the next day the cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS (Invivogen, Cat. no: tlrl-b5lps) for 3.5 h or with 1 μg/ml LPS for 2.5 h and additionally with 20 μM MCC950 (Millipore Sigma, Cat. no: 538120) for 1h followed or not by NLRP3 activation with 20 μM nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no: N7143-5MG) for 1.5 h. Cell supernatants were analyzed for LDH activity using the CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega, Cat. no: G1780).
All experiments were performed as triplicates and for the immunofluorescence and negative-staining EM imaging representative images were selected for display. For all the bar graphs, data were expressed as mean ± SD. Quantification of immunofluorescence imaging was performed by counting cells in 3 individual fields of views for each cell line. Quantification of protein amount in sucrose gradients fractions was performed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 51. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40013) PubMed Google Scholar ) and represented as sucrose gradient traces indicating relative amount of protein between sucrose fractions. A number of biological replicates (n) and precision measures (SD) are specified in each figure legend.
