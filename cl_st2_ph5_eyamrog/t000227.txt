Title: Comparing the Boxgrove and Atapuerca (Sima de los Huesos) human fossils: Do they represent distinct paleodemes?


Abstract: Abstract

The early Middle Pleistocene human material from Boxgrove (West Sussex, UK) consists of a partial left tibia and two lower incisors from a separate adult individual. These remains derive from deposits assigned to the MIS 13 interglacial at about 480 ka and have been referred to as Homo cf. heidelbergensis . The much larger skeletal sample from the Sima de los Huesos (Atapuerca, Spain) is dated to the succeeding MIS 12, at about 430 ka. This fossil material has previously been assigned to Homo heidelbergensis but is now placed within the Neanderthal clade. Because of the scarcity of human remains from the Middle Pleistocene and their morphological variability, this study assessed whether the Boxgrove specimens fit within the morphological variability of the homogeneous Sima de los Huesos population. Based on morphometric analyses performed against 22 lower incisors from Sima de los Huesos and published material, the data from the Boxgrove incisors place them comfortably within the range of Sima de los Huesos. Both assemblages present robust incisors distinct from the overall small recent Homo sapiens incisors, and Boxgrove also aligns closely with Homo neanderthalensis and some other European Middle Pleistocene hominins. Following morphological and cross-sectional analyses of the Boxgrove tibia compared to seven adult Sima de los Huesos specimens and a set of comparative tibiae, Boxgrove is shown to be similar to Sima de los Huesos and Neanderthals in having thick cortices and bone walls, but in contrast resembles modern humans in having a straight anterior tibial crest and a suggestion of a lateral concavity. Based on the patterns observed, there is no justification for assigning the Boxgrove and Sima de los Huesos incisors to distinct paleodemes, but the tibial data show greater contrasts and suggest that all three of these samples are unlikely to represent the same paleodeme.

Section: 1. Introduction

Despite the scarcity and fragmentary nature of the Middle Pleistocene (MP) hominin fossil record, recent studies have increased our knowledge of human evolution in Europe, revealing a complex picture of settlement patterns and population diversity. In particular, the morphological and metric variability observed among MP hominins, as well as the improved geochronological data available for key MP fossil localities (e.g., Nomade et al., 2011 ; Rink et al., 2013 ; Falguères et al., 2015 ; Daura et al., 2017 ; Demuro et al., 2019 ; Harvati et al., 2019 ), have led to much debate on the taxonomy of certain specimens, as well as on the origin of the Neanderthal lineage . Although a European origin and local evolution for the Neanderthals is supported by many researchers ( Dean et al., 1998 ; Hublin, 2009 ; Stringer, 2011 ; Arsuaga et al., 2014 ), debate remains about the anagenetic (linear) or cladogenetic (splitting) evolutionary origin of this clade ( Stringer, 2012 ; Arsuaga et al., 2014 ; Daura et al., 2017 ). Indeed, while some have argued that Neanderthals might have evolved out of Homo heidelbergensis in Europe ( Rightmire, 2008 ; Stringer, 2012 ), others have suggested that there were several populations (paleodemes) of hominins present in Europe throughout the MP, some of them evolving toward the classic Neanderthal morphology and others not ( Demuro et al., 2019 ). This latter hypothesis is based on the mosaic of primitive and derived features displayed in various MP samples, where Neanderthal autapomorphies do not seem to appear in the fossil record following a gradual and linear model ( Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2016 , 2018 ; Zanolli et al., 2018 ; Demuro et al., 2019 ). For instance, the near-contemporaneous southwestern European sites of Aroeira, Atapuerca-Sima de los Huesos (SH), and Arago yielded hominin fossils of differing morphologies, suggesting that high diversity within or between MP paleodemes likely characterized the region at the time, potentially due to complex population dynamics with varying levels of isolation and admixture ( Dennell et al., 2011 ; Arsuaga et al., 2014 ; Daura et al., 2017 ). Recent mitochondrial paleogenetic data also showed a complex pattern of population relationships through space and time during the MP, in particular between the Sima de los Huesos hominins, the Neanderthals, and the Denisovans ( Meyer et al., 2014 , 2016 ; Kuhlwilm et al., 2016 ). However, genomic data confirmed the SH population relationship with the Neanderthals.
Within the scarce and fragmentary MP hominin fossil record, the partial tibia and the two lower incisors from Boxgrove (West Sussex, UK) provide valuable data for the assessment of hominin morphological diversity, as these remains derive from deposits attributed to the cooling limb of the MIS 13 interglacial, at about 480 ka ( Preece and Parfitt, 2012 ; Whittaker and Parfitt, 2017 ). These fossils are younger than the key MP hominin mandible from Mauer, holotype of H. heidelbergensis ( Schoetensack, 1908 ), dated to about 609 ka (likely MIS 15; Wagner et al., 2010 ), and closer in age to the SH and Arago fossils, dated to MIS 12 ( Falguères et al., 2015 ; Demuro et al., 2019 ). Previous morphological ( Stringer et al., 1998 ) and biomechanical ( Trinkaus et al., 1999 ) studies of the Boxgrove 1 tibia highlighted similarities to other Pleistocene archaic Homo tibiae, particularly in its external morphology and overall robusticity ( Trinkaus, 2009 ), with diaphyseal strength and/or cold-adapted body proportions paralleling those of the Neanderthals. Morphological and metrical analyses of the Boxgrove 2 and 3 incisors ( Hillson et al., 2010 ) showed that these compared well with other European MP mandibular incisors, such as those in the Mauer mandible, with a robust crown and root (see Hillson et al., 2010 for further description). Based on the various characters observed on the Boxgrove hominin material, the remains have been referred to Homo cf. heidelbergensis ( Roberts et al., 1994 ; Stringer et al., 1998 ; Hillson et al., 2010 ), although the taxonomic status of H. heidelbergensis remains debated ( Stringer, 1983 , 2012 ; Mounier et al., 2009 ; Mounier and Caparros, 2015 ; Roksandic et al., 2018 ). In this article, we compare the dental and tibial morphology of the Boxgrove specimens to samples from the broadly contemporary assemblage from SH to assess morphological diversity in the European MP hominin fossil record and discuss the validity of assigning the Boxgrove and SH material to distinct paleodemes.
As the largest hominin collection currently available for the MP, the SH material has been extensively studied, allowing the analysis of intrapopulation variability ( Arsuaga et al., 1997 ; Lorenzo et al., 1998 ; Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2004 ; Gómez-Olivencia et al., 2007 ; Prado-Simón et al., 2012 ), and demonstrating that Neanderthal autapomorphies were present in all skeletal elements of this population ( Arsuaga et al., 2015 ; Quam et al., 2016 ; Rodríguez et al., 2016 ; Martín-Albaladejo et al., 2017 ; Pablos et al., 2017 ). As such, while these remains were previously assigned to H. heidelbergensis ( Arsuaga et al., 1997 ), they have since been placed within the Neanderthal clade based on both morphology and ancient DNA ( Arsuaga et al., 2014 ; Meyer et al., 2016 ), and are the earliest known paleodeme exhibiting clear Neanderthal features ( Demuro et al., 2019 ). The highly derived state of the SH population observed through such studies raised questions regarding the degree of intra- and interpopulation variability existing during the MP, and highlighted the need for further studies to assess whether the SH assemblage could be seen as representative of European MP populations, or whether it should be considered as a distinct paleodeme.
Although the morphology of lower incisors of extinct and extant Homo has been reported to be less discriminative for taxonomic purposes than that of posterior teeth ( Skinner et al., 2015 ; Martín-Francés et al., 2018 ; Zanolli et al., 2018 ; Lockey et al., 2020 ), methodological advances have permitted the study of dental tissue proportions and provide additional avenues to assist taxonomic assessment (e.g., Smith et al., 2003 , 2012 ; Olejniczak et al., 2008 ; Macchiarelli et al., 2013 ; Zanolli and Mazurier, 2013 ; Pan et al., 2016 ; Martín-Francés et al., 2018 , 2020 ). For instance, previous work has shown that the anterior dental tissue proportions and dimensions for Neanderthals are distinct from other extinct hominins and extant recent modern humans (RMH; Smith et al., 2012 ; Le Cabec et al., 2013 ; Buti et al., 2017 ), with the SH canines exhibiting a dental tissue proportion pattern typical of Neanderthals ( García-Campos et al., 2019 ). Evaluating and comparing the endostructure of the mandibular incisors from the Boxgrove and SH specimens can thus provide additional data to assess whether these hominins align with Neanderthals, RMH, or present unique patterns of dental tissue proportions or root dimensions.
Previous work has described the morphology of the Boxgrove tibia ( Stringer et al., 1998 ), highlighting its rounded and straight anterior crest, with only a suggestion of a lateral concavity, thus distinguishing it from that of Neanderthals. This study also provided an estimate of the articular length of Boxgrove 1 at 370 and 376 mm (mean = 373 mm). Because living bone responds to mechanical loading, especially during development, detailed analyses of long bone morphology and inner structure can thus indirectly inform us about the activity, sex, and size of individuals ( Ruff and Hayes, 1983 ; Ruff et al., 1993 , 1994 ). Cross-sectional shape and thickness, in particular, have been shown to reflect their robusticity and rigidity ( Ruff and Hayes, 1983 ; Ruff et al., 1993 ). In a cross-sectional analysis of the Boxgrove tibia ( Trinkaus et al., 1999 ), the authors noted some degree of deformation, which they corrected before deriving moments of area. However, although this method is suitable for nearly regular and concentric sections, the formulas they used to derive the moments of area have been suggested to potentially introduce errors when applied to other irregular and eccentric contours ( Nagurka and Hayes, 1980 ; Ruff and Leo, 1986 ; Ohman, 1993 ). Thus, we present a new virtual reconstruction of the Boxgrove 1 tibia and a revised estimate of the cross-sectional parameters, allowing for a new morphological analysis of this specimen and comparison of the Boxgrove tibia with seven almost complete tibia specimens from SH.
In this article, we compare the dental and tibial morphology of two important and approximately contemporaneous MP hominin samples. The first aim is to assess whether the crown and root dental tissue proportions and root linear measurements of the two Boxgrove lower incisors, and the morphology and cross-sectional parameters of the Boxgrove tibia, fall within the variation of the SH population, or if these specimens more likely belong to another European paleodeme, or even to another species. The second aim is to compare the Boxgrove and SH assemblages to previously published literature on MP hominins to assess morphological diversity in the European MP fossil record more generally. This allows us to discuss the validity of assigning the Boxgrove and SH material to distinct paleodemes, and to consider their significance within the larger MP debate on the dynamics of human evolution in Europe.
Boxgrove (West Sussex) is situated 50 m above sea level and about 10 km from the present-day coastline of the English Channel ( Fig. 1 A). The site was discovered in 1974, as a result of sand and gravel extraction in a quarry called Amey's Eartham Pit. Between 1974 and 1996, over 100 individual localities were excavated, and a high-resolution record of stone artifacts and fossilized mammal remains was recovered from a succession of buried land surfaces ( Roberts and Parfitt, 1999 ). The quarrying exposed early MP interglacial marine deposits, an overlying paleosol , and associated freshwater pond deposits that were covered by colluvial and mass-movement sediments during the ensuing cold stage.

Human remains (a tibia and two mandibular incisors) were recovered from site Q1/B (Quarry 1, excavation area B), also colloquially known as either the ‘Waterhole Site’ or the ‘Hominin Site’ ( Stringer et al., 1998 ; Hillson et al., 2010 ). The incisors are from the base of the freshwater deposits in an area that would have been dominated locally by freshwater pools formed by spring activity and wet grasslands backed to the north by a degrading cliff ( Roberts and Pope, 2009 ). These deposits contain dense accumulations of well-made flint handaxes, flake tools, and debitage from their manufacture ( Pope, 2002 ), intermingled with butchered large mammal remains ( Roberts and Parfitt, 1999 ). The tibia was recovered from overlying deposits associated with a colluvial channel and gelifluction flow.
The interglacial deposits have been dated primarily based on mammalian biostratigraphy. The mammal fauna includes a combination of large and small mammals that went extinct at the end of early MP (e.g., Stephanorhinus hundsheimensis , Praemegaceros cf. verticornis , Praemegaceros dawkinsi , Ursus deningeri , Pliomys episcopalis ) together with early forms of the living water vole ( Arvicola ) and narrowed-skulled vole ( Lasiopodomys gregalis ) that together characterize the latter part of the ‘Cromerian Complex’ correlated with MIS 13. The cold stage deposits are correlated with the major glacial period of MIS 12 ( Fig. 1 B; Preece and Parfitt, 2012 ). The Boxgrove hominin remains derive from deposits attributed to the cooling limb of the MIS 13 interglacial, at about 480 ka ( Preece and Parfitt, 2012 ; Whittaker and Parfitt, 2017 ).
The Sima de los Huesos cave site is located within the deep chambers of the Sierra de Atapuerca karst system, a small range of hills near Burgos in northern Spain, covering about 12 square kilometers in area, and rising about 1000 m above sea level ( Fig. 1 ; Arsuaga et al., 1997 ). It contains numerous karst cavities in Cretaceous limestone, many of which contain Pleistocene sediments. The first human remains at SH, associated with a large assemblage of cave bear ( U. deningeri ) fossils, were found in 1976, and the site has been under systematic excavation since 1984 ( Aguirre et al., 1975 ; Aguirre and de Lumley, 1977 ). More than 6500 hominin remains from some 29 individuals have been found in the excavated deposits, concentrated in a single lithostratigraphic level (LU6) alongside carnivore fossils and speleothem intraclasts ( Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2021 ). Analyses of the faunal assemblage suggested an early-to-mid MP age for the hominin-bearing layer ( Cuenca-Bescós et al., 1997 ; García et al., 1997 ; Arsuaga et al., 2014 ), which is consistent with recent chronological studies proposing an estimated age range between 427 ± 12 ka and 448 ± 15 ka for the SH hominins ( Arnold et al., 2014 ; Arsuaga et al., 2014 ; Demuro et al., 2019 ). Uranium-series dating of a cave raft speleothem deposited directly on a hominin cranium from LU-6 yielded a mean age of 434 + 36/–24 ka ( Arsuaga et al., 2014 ), whereas both single-grain TT-OSL ages for LU-5 and LU-6 and a Bayesian age-depth model built with published PIR-IR and TT-OSL chronologies from the level LU-6 provided a mean age of 448 ± 15 ka ( Arnold et al., 2014 ; Demuro et al., 2019 ). These results allow the attribution of the SH hominin remains to early MIS 11 or, more probably, to late MIS 12 ( Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005 ; Fig. 1 B). In 1998, a large and apparently unused amygdaloid handaxe manufactured from a pinkish quartzite was recovered from the main hominin fossil-bearing deposits ( Carbonell and Mosquera, 2006 ). It is the only artifact identified from SH so far ( Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2004 ; Carbonell and Mosquera, 2006 ).

Section: 2. Materials and methods

Incisors The Boxgrove dental sample comprises two mandibular permanent incisors tentatively assigned to H. heidelbergensis ( Hillson et al., 2010 ). Boxgrove 2 is a right lower central incisor (NHMUK PA EM 3567) exhibiting a wear grade 6 ( Molnar, 1971 ); the detached tip of the root (NHMUK PA EM 3567b) was found nearby, in a bulk sample recovered approximately 1 m away from the main portion of the incisor (NHMUK PA EM 3567a; Hillson et al., 2010 ). Boxgrove 3 (NHMUK PA EM 3568) is a left lower lateral incisor with a wear grade 7 ( Molnar, 1971 ). Both teeth have a large area of dentine exposed on the incisal surface surrounded by a thin enamel rim ( Fig. 2 ). The wear pattern and context of the finds in the same level and in close proximity to each other suggest they belong to the same individual ( Hillson et al., 2010 ).

The comparative dental material includes a total of 73 lower incisors belonging to Early and Middle Pleistocene hominins from Europe and a modern human sample ( Table 1 , Table 2 ): two incisors from Gran Dolina-TD6.2 ( Homo antecessor ; curated at the National Research Center on Human Evolution – CENIEH, Burgos, Spain), 22 from SH (curated at CENIEH), nine Homo neanderthalensis mandibular incisors from Krapina and Ehringsdorf (available on the open source information platform NESPOS; https://www.nespos.org ), and 40 RMH specimens from the forensic collection of the Anatomical Department of Escuela de Medicina Legal de Madrid (curated at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain; for a detailed description of this material see Lockey et al., Submitted for publication ). We also included published measurements for 244 teeth for crown and root dental tissue proportions and dimensions (see Supplementary Online Material [SOM] Table S1 for details). These include incisors from Tighenif ( Zanolli and Mazurier, 2013 ) dated to ca. 700 ka ( Geraads et al., 1986 ), from Atapuerca-Sima del Elefante (ATE9-1; Prado-Simón et al., 2011 ) in level TE9 dated to ca. 1.2 Ma, from Neanderthals from Las Palomas dated to <43,000–40,000 cal BP ( Walker et al., 2008 ; Bayle et al., 2017 ), and from Grotte du Portel in Ariège ( Brabant and Sahly, 1964 ) dated to OIS 3–4 ( Gardeisen, 1999 ). As part of these supplementary measurements, the SH sample was complemented with root length measurements taken by one of the authors (A.L.L.) from published photographs (Figs. 13 and 14 from Martinón-Torres et al., 2012 ) of 11 central and lateral incisors with complete roots. Published measurements for a sample of Neolithic and RMH from Bayle et al. (2017) were also included in the comparative data set, as well as 39 specimens from multiple taxa (fossil modern humans [FMH], RMH, Neanderthals) from Smith et al. (2012) , and 159 specimens from multiple taxa (FMH, RMH, Neanderthals, Homo erectus , ‘ Homo ergaster ,’ H. heidelbergensis , ‘ Homo georgicus ’) from Le Cabec et al. (2013) . The FMH sample comprises Homo sapiens specimens dated from MIS 2 and MIS 1. Table 1 . Sample composition of the central and lateral incisors, sample size, and sources of the comparative sample.

Tibiae The hominin tibia discovered at Boxgrove in 1993 (Boxgrove 1—NHMUK PA EM 3566) is a left tibial shaft lacking its proximal and distal ends. It consisted of four major proximal fragments and two distal fragments before repairing the breaks ( Roberts et al., 1994 ; Stringer et al., 1998 ; Trinkaus et al., 1999 ). Taphonomic modifications such as surface polish, incisions, grooves, and pits were observed, suggesting the impact of carnivore action, trampling, and/or pedoturbation on the preservation of the specimen ( Stringer et al., 1998 ). Boxgrove 1 was excavated from a locality approximately 10 m from the Boxgrove 2 incisor and in a stratigraphically higher level, making it unlikely that the tibia and incisors originate from the same individual ( Hillson et al., 2010 ). Boxgrove 1 presents a Homo -like tibial morphology, with features such as a diaphysis with rounded margins, mediolateral hypertrophy, a prominent tibial pilaster, and a relatively high level of diaphyseal robusticity ( Roberts et al., 1994 ; Stringer et al., 1998 ; Trinkaus et al., 1999 ). Age-at-death could not be determined precisely for the Boxgrove 1 individual, with histomorphometric age estimates suggesting old age ( Streeter et al., 2001 ) and ontogenetic growth pattern suggesting the specimen was a young adult ( Gosman et al., 2013 ). It cannot be demonstrated that the Boxgrove postcranial and dental fossils represent a single population, but this is our working assumption in this article.
The comparative sample used for cross-sectional analysis was composed of seven complete tibiae from SH (from Rodríguez et al., 2018 ), 41 tibiae from RMH from the medieval cemetery at the San Pablo Monastery in Burgos (Spain), and Neanderthal, Early and Middle Upper Paleolithic (UP), and MP modern human (EMH) specimens drawn from Trinkaus and Ruff (2012 ; see SOM Table S1 in Rodríguez et al., 2018 ), and published data on the Broken Hill tibia (NHMUK PA EM 691; Trinkaus, 2009 ). The SH sample used for comparison had previously been analyzed by Arsuaga et al. (2015) and Rodríguez et al. (2018) , highlighting morphological patterns similar to Neanderthal tibial specimens. These included rounder shaft sections than RMH, a relatively smaller medullar cavity, and very thick cortical bone along the shaft. For general shape comparisons, published data were used from Daka (Middle Awash, Ethiopia – BOU–VP-1/109; Gilbert, 2008 ), Broken Hill ( Trinkaus, 2009 ), ‘ H. georgicus ’ ( Lordkipanidze et al., 2007 ), Homo floresiensis ( Jungers et al., 2009 ), Neanderthals, and RMH.
Incisors The Boxgrove incisors were scanned using microcomputed tomography (μCT) with the HMX-ST 225 CT System (Nikon Metrology, Tring, UK) housed at the Imaging and Analysis Centre, Core Research Laboratories, at the Natural History Museum (London, UK) (see SOM S1 for details about the scanning parameters used for each sample). The fossil teeth from Atapuerca TD6 and SH were scanned with the Scanco Medical AG Micro-Computed Tomography 80, at the Microscopy and Micro Tomography Laboratory at CENIEH (Burgos, Spain). The RMH sample (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) was scanned using an X-ray ICTP-ELETTRA MicroCT system at the Multidisciplinary Laboratory of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. The Neanderthal sample was sourced from NESPOS databases ( Weniger et al., 2005 ). Image stacks were imported into Avizo v. 7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham) to create 3D models that allow for a semiautomatic threshold-based segmentation and minor manual editing to separate the different dental tissues (enamel, dentine, and pulp cavity).
As all incisors, central and lateral, present extensive enamel wear (>3 stage following Molnar, 1971 ), no reliable nor comparable data on 2D and/or 3D crown measurements can be provided. However, future studies may compare data on specimens showing similar degree of wear across hominin species, and therefore we performed the 2D and 3D measurements to be included as supplementary material (see SOM Table S2 and SOM Fig. S1 ).
For 2D measurements, firstly, we followed the methodology outlined by Smith et al. (2012) to obtain the 2D mesial plane of section where linear measurements would be taken. Using Amira v. 6.3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), the 3D model of the tooth was rotated to view the occlusal with the incisal edge set horizontally and the widest labiolingual diameter set vertically. Secondly, we located the central point of the incisal edge, and this point was set as the center of rotation. Finally, we created a 2D plane (slice) capturing the widest bicervical diameter resulting in the ideal plane of section. We used ImageJ v. 1.51 ( Abràmoff et al., 2004 ) to measure the enamel and dentine (including pulp) areas (in mm 2 ), and the enamel–dentine junction (EDJ) length (in mm). Following Martin (1985) , we calculated the average enamel thickness (AET = enamel area/EDJ length), the relative enamel thickness (RET = 100∗AET/(dentine area1/2)), and the percentage of dentine and pulp in the molar crown (Acdp/Ac = 100∗dentine area/total crown area in %; see SOM Table S2 ). For 3D measurements, we performed the segmentation of the dental tissues (enamel, dentine, and pulp) and assessed enamel volume thickness for the central and lateral incisors, using the Amira v. 6.3.0 semiautomatic tool, threshold-based segmentation, and manual correction. We used the protocol developed by Olejniczak et al. (2008) for the definition of the cervical plane; that is, the plane halfway between the most apical continuous ring of enamel and the plane containing the last hint of enamel. Following, we measured the volume of the enamel and dentine (including the pulp enclosed in the crown) in mm 3 and surface area of the EDJ (in mm 2 ). Finally, we calculated the 3D average enamel thickness (3D AET = enamel volume/surface area of the EDJ, in mm), 3D relative enamel thickness (3D RET = 100∗3D AET/(dentine volume 1/3) a scale-free measurement), and the percentage of dentine and pulp in the total crown volume (Vcdp/Vc = 100∗dentine volume/total crown volume in %; Kono, 2004 ; Olejniczak et al., 2008 ).
For root measurements, we divided the crown from the root at the cervical plane, following Le Cabec et al. (2013) . Landmarks were set at the greatest curvature on labial and lingual sides of the cemento-enamel junction, and a best-fit plane was then computed (least squares criterion). We used the Avizo v. 7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) ‘volume edit tool’ to measure the crown and root. For all incisor roots, both linear measurements and 3D volume data were extracted from well-preserved specimens and incisors that required reconstruction. The levels of damage for each tooth are reported in Table 2 . When required, minimal reconstructions of the root apex followed the method of Zanolli et al. (2018) based on the 2–3D geometric approach. The virtual stack of images was first oriented with the buccal surface toward the x-axis. The data set was realigned to have the longitudinal sections passing along the root main axis. Then, the most apical transversal section that still displayed a complete root outline was defined as the reference root section. Perpendicular longitudinal sections were then positioned to pass through the center of the reference root section. In lateral views, the root apex was estimated on the longitudinal sections. This process was replicated on the perpendicular longitudinal section. Based on the two reconstructed perpendicular sections appearing as a cross on the reference root section, the broken root outline was reconstructed. The same process was repeated on more apical transversal sections until the last point of the reconstructed longitudinal sections was reached. Interpolations then were used between the reconstructed transversal slices to reconstruct the missing root volume ( SOM Fig. S2 ).
We measured the root variables following Le Cabec et al. (2013) : maximum labiolingual crown diameter (CrLL, in mm); labiolingual cervical root diameter (RLL, in mm); mesiodistal cervical root diameter (RMD, in mm); cervical area (CA, mm 2 ); root length (RL, in mm); radicular dentine volume (RDV, mm 3 ); root pulp volume (RPV, mm 3 ); and total root volume (RV, mm 3 ; Table 3 ).

Tibiae Tomographic scanning of the Boxgrove tibia was carried out at the Imaging and Analysis Centre, Core Research Laboratories, at the Natural History Museum (London, UK), with an HMX-ST 225 CT System (Nikon Metrology, Tring, UK). Cross-sectional images of Boxgrove 1 were obtained in two different pieces, the distal and proximal shaft fragments (see SOM S1 for detail about the scanning parameters used for each sample). Tomographic scanning of the SH hominins and RMH specimens was performed at the University of Burgos (Spain), with a YXLON Compact X-Ray industrial multislice CT scanner. The CT images were visualized using the software package Mimics (Materialise NV, Belgium).
To assess tibial cross-sectional shape and thickness and, in turn, evaluate tibial robusticity and rigidity, a set of cross-sectional parameters was measured on the specimens: total subperiosteal area (TA); cortical subperiosteal area (CA, a measure of resistance to axial loads, Ruff et al., 1993 ); maximum (Imax), and minimum (Imin) second moments of area (to assess bending rigidity in the reference planes); polar second moment of area (J, an indication of resistance to torsion and a general reflection of overall rigidity); and section moduli at bone midshaft (to measure the bending and torsional strength; where Zp represents the cross-sectional torsional strength). Because of the difficulties in orienting incomplete specimens with confidence, only TA and CA, Imax, Imin, and J, were considered for the analysis of Boxgrove 1. Cortical area relative to TA (%CA) was used as a proxy for diaphyseal robusticity. Diaphyseal shape was examined using Imax and Imin.
Incisors For comparative analysis of the incisors, and due to having only two incisors from Boxgrove, we used the adjusted (or modified) Z-score, which allows for comparison between small and unbalanced samples using Student's inverse t distribution. In these Z-scores, the −1.0 to +1.0 interval comprises 95% of the variation in the reference sample ( Maureille et al., 2001 ; Scolan et al., 2012 ). Adjusted Z-scores were conducted on CA, RL, and RV (variables that captured the overall morphology) for the Boxgrove specimen, computed on the means and standard deviations of the Neanderthals and RMH groups. Qualitative assessment was conducted for all major root variables.
As both Boxgrove incisor roots required reconstruction, an interobserver error test was conducted by two of the authors (A.L.L and L.M.-F.) and Clément Zanolli. For total root volume, Boxgrove 2 had <1% difference, and Boxgrove 3 <2% difference ( SOM Table S3 ). Considering these low values, which are lower than the reported 4% threshold error (e.g., Zanolli et al., 2010 , 2018 ), our estimates from reconstructed roots therefore appear accurate. Because of the extensive crown wear, we provide descriptive statistics for the crown ( SOM Table S2 ) and a more in-depth analysis of the roots.
Tibiae To compare the robusticity pattern of the tibiae among the different groups or paleodemes used in this analysis, tibial diaphyseal strength should be assessed relative to the baseline loads placed upon it, with body mass being the main load that models bone shape during growth ( Ruff et al., 1993 ). Taking into consideration tibial sample size limitations for scaling to bone length and body mass, it is preferable (if possible) to carry out a standardization of J by the biomechanical length of the bone as a proxy for body size ( Ruff et al., 1993 ). As Boxgrove 1 is missing both epiphyses , we performed a virtual reconstruction using Mimics to estimate its biomechanical length and, in turn, estimate the individual's stature. For this, the different specimens (SH and RMH) were assessed to identify the specimen whose mid-diaphysis external robusticity was closest to that of Boxgrove. This individual was SH Tib-XII. The anteroposterior (AP) mid-diaphysis in Boxgrove is free of distortion, with an AP diameter of 39 mm ( Stringer et al., 1998 ). In comparison, the AP diameter of Tib-XII is 37.48 mm. Assuming the AP diameter vs. length proportions are similar in these two specimens, Tib-XII was scaled (enlarged) by 1.04 to estimate a probable articular length for the Boxgrove tibia. We then located and fixed the diaphyseal foramen and the midshaft in the Boxgrove specimen with that of the scaled Tib-XII tibia.
For cross-sectional analyses, sections at 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, and 80% of tibial biomechanical length levels were chosen following Ruff and Hayes (1983) and Trinkaus and Ruff (2012) . The analyses were performed using Moment-Macro ( https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/fae/mmacro.html ) in ImageJ v. 1.53k ( Abràmoff et al., 2004 ). Because the proximal and distal fragments that constitute Boxgrove 1 did not fit perfectly, with a narrower section in the refitted proximal portion compared to the distal portion, the four largest pieces of the proximal fragment were virtually separated before analysis to allow a reconstruction of the proximal shaft and obtain new results for the 65% and 80% cross-sections ( Fig. 3 ). Three different cross-sectional reconstruction approaches were tested to establish the most plausible one: 1) Boxgrove 1 physically reconstructed (PR) without virtual reconstruction; 2) two-dimensional reconstruction (2DR) of cross-section images fixing the edges; and 3) three-dimensional virtual reconstruction (3DR) of the Boxgrove 1 tibia following tibia distal diaphysis shape.

To provide a synthetic functional image through a visual representation of topographic thickness variation among Boxgrove, SH, and RMH, we performed a thickness analysis with Materialise 3-matic Medical (Materialise NV, Belgium). This software allows detection of differences in cortical thickness in absolute values in each specimen, so the differences in thickness of each bone are standardized by assigning an individual color scale—with minimum (green) and maximum thickness (red) values as the extremes of variation and yellow the mean value—that we can compare between individuals.
We also revisited the morphology and size of the Boxgrove 1 tibia to determine the affinities with those from the MP fossil record. For this assessment, we compared Boxgrove with the specimens selected from published literature (see Section 2.1 .), the seven nearly complete tibia specimens from SH, and the 41 RMH specimens that were used in order to be the model for the morphological comparison of Boxgrove 1 general external shape. Recent modern humans have different diaphyseal proportions compared to Neanderthals and SH specimens, being much less robust; for example, an RMH with an articular length of 370 mm will yield a diaphyseal diameter of ∼31 mm; Boxgrove is therefore 1.25 times more robust. Thus, to fit biomechanical length with diaphyseal dimensions, we chose an RMH specimen with that biomechanical length, scaling its diaphyseal diameters to that of Boxgrove 1.
To compare the Boxgrove 1 tibia with those of SH, RMH, and fossil samples from the literature ( Trinkaus and Ruff, 2012 ), the %CA and Imax/Imin indices were calculated. The combination of CA and TA reflects the differential subperiosteal deposition and endosteal resorption of bone, principally during development ( Trinkaus and Ruff, 2012 ). The Imax/Imin index reflects the general shape of the section in which values close to one have more circular sections, whereas values greater than one have oval sections, in which there is one shaft that supports much more load than another.
The polar second moment of area (J) provides both an indication of resistance to torsion and a general reflection of overall rigidity. As indicated earlier, J should be standardized by an estimate of body mass. Given the scarcity of tibial MP fossil remains and the absence of associated pelvic or femur remains with which to calculate body mass, it is preferable to use biomechanical tibial length, which we obtained from the virtual reconstruction as explained earlier. With those data, we performed a reduced major axis (RMA) regression of the natural logarithm of J vs. biomechanical tibial length, using RMH and UP specimens for the comparison. We chose to use RMA because our aim is to summarize the relationship between two variables rather than to generate a predictive model. Logarithm transformation of J and biomechanical tibial length was performed to minimize regression bias ( Ruff, 1995 ). In addition, stature was calculated using the Sjøvold (1990) formula, as used by Carretero et al. (2012) for SH and Neanderthal populations. The formula used in this article for the tibial material was as follows: Stature = 3.29 × TL + 47.34 ± 4.15 where, TL is the total length from the top of the lateral proximal condyle to the tip of the distal malleolus (proximal spines are not included), as defined by Martin and Saller (1957) in which TL is referred to as M1.

Section: 3. Results

Table 3 shows the descriptive measurements for the Boxgrove incisors and the comparative samples. Figure 4 shows the position of Boxgrove in relation to the comparative sample for CA relative to RV, and CrLL relative to RL. Boxgrove has a ratio of CA to RV similar to SH, as well as to EMH. Boxgrove has larger CA and RV compared to H. sapiens . The Boxgrove CA and RV are otherwise reduced relative to other extinct hominins. Boxgrove 2 and 3 have wide CrLL relative to RL compared to RMH, falling close to SH. Boxgrove and SH have smaller CrLL relative to RL in comparison to other extinct hominins. Boxgrove teeth share an intermediate position for RL and RV with SH, with longer and larger roots than RMH but shorter and smaller relative to other extinct hominins ( H. erectus , ‘ H. ergaster ,’ H. antecessor from Gran Dolina-TD6.2, H. heidelbergensis from Mauer, Neanderthals; Fig. 4 ; SOM Fig. S3 ) and the RV value of the Sima del Elefante I 2 (336.42 mm 3 taken from Prado-Simón et al., 2011 ). For the adjusted Z-scores ( Fig. 5 ; Table 4 ), Boxgrove 2 falls within the 95% limit of variation (confidence interval) of SH for RV and RL. Boxgrove 3 falls within the 95% limit of variation for SH CA and RV and RMH for RL. For other variables, Boxgrove 2 and 3 fall outside of the 95% limit of variation compared to Neanderthals, SH, or RMH. Overall, for root traits, the Boxgrove incisors show the greatest affinities with the SH specimens, although there is overlap among groups.

Owing to the severe crown wear of the Boxgrove incisors, we were unable to extract meaningful results, and no taxonomic signal was identified in the surviving parts of the crowns.
Boxgrove 1 is similar in diaphyseal proportions to the SH Tib-XII complete tibia ( Fig. 6 A; Table 5 ). Using Tib-XII as a model, virtual reconstruction of the Boxgrove tibia results in a biomechanical length of 370 mm, which is consistent with the lower estimate of Stringer et al. (1998) . Based on this estimate, stature was calculated, providing an estimate of 177.3 ± 4.15 cm for the stature of the Boxgrove individual. External measurements of Boxgrove 1 show that this specimen is the largest compared to all other studied samples ( Table 5 ).

(2015) .
With respect to shape, Boxgrove 1 is shown to have a more angular cross-section and its posterior face is flatter than in Neanderthals and SH, which are characterized by a section with an oval or amygdaloid morphology. In comparison, Daka (Middle Awash, Ethiopia: BOU-VP-1/109; Gilbert, 2008 ), Broken Hill ( Trinkaus, 2009 ), ‘ H. georgicus ’ ( Lordkipanidze et al., 2007 ), and H. floresiensis ( Jungers et al., 2009 ) share the straight and more angulated morphology observed in Boxgrove 1, in contrast to the patterns observed in SH and Neanderthal specimens. When using a modern human tibia with a biomechanical length of 370 mm as a model for Boxgrove 1, and a scaled diameter of 1.24, the Boxgrove tibia fits the shape of the modern human tibia almost perfectly ( Fig. 6 B), and presents a rounded and straight anterior border, as well as a flatter posterior surface than SH (See SI in Rodríguez et al., 2018 ).
Cross-sectional analysis When comparing the results from the present cross-sectional analysis ( Table 6 ; Fig. 7 ) with those of Trinkaus et al. (1999) , similar values were obtained for the distal fragment, but values diverge for the reconstructed proximal fragment. The two fragments differ in shape, with the distal portion having a less circular section than the proximal fragment, as expected. Two-dimensional reconstruction of cross-section images, fixing the fissures of the bone, and physical reconstructions fail because of the proximal fragment being narrower than expected for a human specimen, as noted by Trinkaus et al. (1999) . The 3D-reconstructed tibia sections of Boxgrove 1 shown in Table 6 are most similar to those reported by Trinkaus et al. (1999) . Table 6 .

When comparing the values obtained for TA, CA, Imax, Imin, J, %CA, and Imax/Imin for Boxgrove 1 with those of Neanderthals and SH, there are more similarities with H. neanderthalensis and SH than with Broken Hill or RMH ( Table 7 ; Figure 8 , Figure 9 ). Regarding cross-section cortical thickness %CA ( Fig. 8 ), Boxgrove 1 and other fossil humans have a relatively higher %CA and thicker bone cortices than RMH. Boxgrove 1 shares a similar distribution pattern with Broken Hill and Neanderthals, the 50% section having the thickest cortex. Boxgrove falls within the SH variability except at the 20% and 35% sections, where Boxgrove displays narrower cortices. This pattern is similar to that of Broken Hill, although this individual is thicker at every level. Regarding Imax/Imin ( Fig. 9 ), Boxgrove 1 shares a similar pattern with Neanderthals, SH, and MP modern humans (EMH), and differs from RMH and Broken Hill. Table 7 .

With respect to bone robusticity, the Boxgrove tibia is shown to be the most robust among all the comparative samples, at all section levels ( Fig. 10 ). In the original article ( Trinkaus et al., 1999 ), the authors calculated Z-scores relative to EMH for the comparison of the 50% LJ relative to the 35% LJ, and established that Boxgrove fits better with the Neanderthal tibial model than with UP modern humans, although the difference in shape was not significant. To validate this former analysis, the LJ values relative to biomechanical length were compared using an RMA analysis in which the reference line was that calculated for anatomically modern humans (i.e., RMH and UP specimens). Results show that Boxgrove plots above the regression line of anatomically modern humans, similarly to Neanderthal and the SH samples.

Wall thickness analysis The anterior crest, soleal line, and tibia pilaster are the thickest parts of the Boxgrove 1 tibia ( Fig. 11 A). In Figure 11 B, we observe a pattern more typical of RMH, where the greatest thickness is located in the tibial spine at midshaft, and is independent of wall thickness. Figure 11 illustrates the high relative thickness of the soleal line and tibial spine. Boxgrove 1 appears more similar to Tib-XII in terms of wall thickness, than to RMH ( Fig. 11 ).

Section: 4. Discussion

For extinct and extant late Homo , mandibular incisor morphology is extremely similar, except for a generally larger size in Neanderthals relative to RMH ( Bailey, 2006 ). Compared to molars ( Olejniczak et al., 2008 ; Skinner et al., 2015 ; Martín-Francés et al., 2018 , 2020 ; Lockey et al., 2020 ) incisors are less taxonomically discriminative. As shown in previous studies ( Lockey et al., 2020 ), we found that extreme wear also reduces the utility of crown dental tissue proportions for classification purposes.
The morphology of the roots firmly places Boxgrove within the range of variation of the SH sample. In all root traits, the Boxgrove incisors show greater robusticity than those in the RMH sample. Both SH and Boxgrove are within or below the lower ranges of other MP hominins for RL and RV, with slightly less robust roots. The pulp cavities of the Boxgrove incisors have mesiodistally flattened radicular canals ( Fig. 2 ); this interpretation is limited, however, by excess deposition of secondary dentine and the impact of excessive wear altering the pulp cavity morphology in both teeth. This radicular pulp cavity morphology conforms to the shape of the LI 2 from Sima del Elefante, Spain ( Prado-Simón et al., 2011 ) and the lower incisors from the Neanderthal individual from Regourdou, France ( Macchiarelli et al., 2013 ). This radicular pulp cavity does, however, differ from the Tighenif mandibular incisors, which are reported as having an ovoid cross-section ( Zanolli and Mazurier, 2013 ). The limited amount of comparative μ CT material for permanent mandibular incisors means that the potential of pulp shape for taxonomic and phylogenetic assessment is currently not possible statistically. We emphasize that if undertaken, wear should also be considered a factor impacting radicular pulp shape ( Philippas, 1961 ).
Turning to the root dimensions, Boxgrove shows higher similarities to the SH material. They are more gracile than the incisors of Mauer, Neanderthals, and any Early and Middle Pleistocene hominin studied here, and more robust than the RMH samples. In addition, Boxgrove and SH share a relatively narrower labiolingual root diameter as well as a shorter incisor root, which places them in an intermediate position between the RMH sample and other extinct hominins, including other European hominins such as Mauer and later Neanderthals. Notably, our adjusted Z-Scores strongly align Boxgrove and SH together for CA, RL, and RV relative to RMH and Neanderthals. Our study reveals that Boxgrove and SH are different from late Neanderthals, which share with other Early and Middle Pleistocene groups a more robust conformation. Our findings concur with those of Le Cabec et al. (2013) in that Neanderthals preserve the primitive condition, shared with other Early and Middle Pleistocene groups ( H. erectus : S7_50, ‘ H. ergaster ’: KNW-WT 1500, H. antecessor : Gran Dolina-TD6-2, H. heidelbergensis : Mauer). In this context, Boxgrove and SH would diverge from the primitive condition, supporting previous remarks on the high morphological variability in the MP and the possibility of more than one lineage coexisting during this period in Europe ( Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2018 ; Martínez de Pinillos et al., 2020 ).
The analysis of the lower incisors does not justify the separation of SH and Boxgrove into distinct paleodemes. However, it must be noted that mandibles and dentitions within the same specimen may show different signals ( Roksandic et al., 2011 ; Vialet et al., 2018 ). As an example, the Montmaurin mandible shows clear dental Neanderthal-like traits, whereas this pattern is less pronounced in the mandibular bone ( Vialet et al., 2018 ). In contrast, in the SH fossils, presumably older than Mountmaurin-La Niche, both the teeth and the mandibles show clear Neanderthal affinities ( Martinón-Torres et al., 2012 ; Arsuaga et al., 2014 ). Along the same line, the late MP specimen from Mala Balanica (Serbia) lacks Neanderthal apomorphies in both the mandible and the dentition ( Roksandic et al., 2011 ) and the Arago specimens, roughly contemporaneous with SH, show milder expressions of Neanderthal-like traits in both the mandible and the teeth ( Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2018 ). This mosaic of features within the same specimens reinforces the notion of high morphological variability during the MP of Europe ( Dennell et al., 2011 ). Overall, MP hominins from Europe show a general shared bauplan that suggests inclusion in the same clade, a clade from which the Neanderthal species would eventually emerge ( Rosas and Bermúdez de Castro, 1998 ; Bermúdez de Castro et al., 2016 , 2018 ). The closer similarities of the Boxgrove incisors to SH rather than to Gran Dolina-TD6 would support their grouping into the same evolutionary clade. It has been shown that the origin of some Neanderthal-like traits can be traced back to the European Early Pleistocene groups ( Martinón-Torres et al., 2019 ), and a recent study of the dental remains from Fontana Ranuccio and Visogliano (Italy) showed that a Neanderthal-like inner dental structure, distinct from that of modern humans, was already present in MP populations at least 430 to 450 ka ago ( Zanolli et al., 2018 ). However, with regard to the lower incisors, SH and Boxgrove show a more derived state, whereas Mauer and TD6 retain more primitive features. Nevertheless, establishing a species-level distinction among the MP specimens is difficult because of the scarcity and discontinuity of the fossil record. It is also important to recognize the limited utility of isolated teeth, particularly lower incisors, for taxonomic purposes.
Boxgrove 1 is part of the diaphysis of a left tibia, without the distal and proximal epiphyses , deriving from an individual with an estimated stature of 177.3 ± 4.15 cm, which is taller than Neanderthals and SH individuals ( Carretero et al., 2012 ). It differs from the RMH tibiae used for comparison in the present study, and is more similar to those of SH and Neanderthals in having thicker cortices and thicker bone walls in the anterior and posterior surfaces, a pattern shared with SH specimens. In relation to external morphology, it shows a strong and well-developed soleal line, indicating robust musculature attaching to that surface, plus a slight anteroposterior curvature. However, it is similar to modern humans in having a straight anterior tibial crest and the suggestion of a lateral concavity, which also fits with the plesiomorphic pattern, also present in Broken Hill, ‘ H. georgicus ,’ and H. floresiensis . These features might therefore be a set of primitive traits for the genus Homo .
Cortical distribution in Boxgrove 1 (%CA) is similar to the Broken Hill tibia ( Fig. 8 ). Diaphyseal shape pattern (Imax/Imin) is similar to those of SH, Neanderthals, and EMH ( Fig. 9 ), but different from RMH and UP humans. Bone robusticity is higher than in any other individual studied in the comparative sample, which could be due to a larger body size and/or a higher activity pattern, as the Imax/Imin index suggests. This index is likely related to activity patterns in those hominins ( Rodríguez et al., 2018 ), showing the active life of the Boxgrove 1 hominin.
Although the enhanced robusticity of the Boxgrove tibia could reflect a greater body mass and elevated activity levels, shape and surface feature contrasts between Boxgrove and SH suggest a level of population difference, whether recognized specifically or not. Thus, the Boxgrove tibial shaft shares with SH and Neanderthal traits that are absent in RMH, traits that are probably plesiomorphies linked to its robusticity. In addition, Boxgrove also lacks the SH and Neanderthal apomorphies in the curvature of the shaft and the morphology of the anterior tibial crest, which also points to its plesiomorphic status.

Section: 5. Conclusions

When the Boxgrove finds were made and described in the 1990s, there was much less material known and published from the MP of Europe, and the provisional assignment of the Boxgrove fossils to H. heidelbergensis was made more on chronological than morphological grounds. We are fortunately in a much better position now in terms of fossil material, but the intervening years have also led to a growing realization of the complexity of human evolution during the MP, with the apparent co-existence of different human lineages/species, and the taxonomically mosaic anatomies found in some of the fossils.
Compared with the clear similarities between Boxgrove and SH in the lower incisors, there is more basis for distinguishing the Boxgrove tibia at a population level in its particular combination of traits otherwise found in SH, Neanderthals, and modern humans. However, the primarily primitive morphology of the Boxgrove tibial shaft would fit that of the predicted last common ancestor for modern humans and Neanderthals (the last pre-split species). Based on the patterns observed here, there is no justification for assigning the Boxgrove and SH incisors to distinct paleodemes, but the tibial data show greater contrasts and suggest that these tibial specimens are unlikely to represent the same population. Thus, if the Boxgrove incisors and tibia represent a single population, their combination of traits suggests this paleodeme was distinct from the SH paleodeme.
