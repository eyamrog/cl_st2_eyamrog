Section: Abstract

How mis-regulated chromatin directly impacts human immune disorders is poorly understood. Speckled Protein 140 (SP140) is an immune-restricted PHD and bromodomain-containing epigenetic “reader,” and SP140 loss-of-function mutations associate with Crohn’s disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, the relevance of these mutations and mechanisms underlying SP140-driven pathogenicity remains unexplored. Using a global proteomic strategy, we identified SP140 as a repressor of topoisomerases (TOPs) that maintains heterochromatin and macrophage fate. In humans and mice, SP140 loss resulted in unleashed TOP activity, de-repression of developmentally silenced genes, and ultimately defective microbe-inducible macrophage transcriptional programs and bacterial killing that drive intestinal pathology. Pharmacological inhibition of TOP1/2 rescued these defects. Furthermore, exacerbated colitis was restored with TOP1/2 inhibitors in Sp140 −/− mice, but not wild-type mice, in vivo . Collectively, we identify SP140 as a TOP repressor and reveal repurposing of TOP inhibition to reverse immune diseases driven by SP140 loss.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Chromatin regulatory proteins are indispensable for both maintenance of immune cell identity and integration of environmental cues. In particular, recognition of dynamic posttranslational modifications on histones by chromatin “readers” is a critical step in this process ( Smale et al., 2014 67.

Dysregulated chromatin readers and aberrant chromatin architecture are central events in cancer ( Filippakopoulos et al., 2010 20. Filippakopoulos, P. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Picaud, S. ...

However, little is known about how altered chromatin readers may directly contribute to and facilitate tailored therapies for human immune diseases.
The complex immune disorders Crohn’s disease (CD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) result from both genetic susceptibility and environmental cues and, despite their clinical heterogeneity, share many identified genetic risk variants, suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms ( Cotsapas and Hafler, 2013 16.

Mutations within epigenetic reader, Speckled Protein 140 (SP140), is one such common genetic risk factor for these three immune diseases ( Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020 22.

Post-GWAS functional characterization of susceptibility variants for chronic lymphocytic leukemia PLoS One. 2012; 7 :e29632 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). SP140 belongs to the SP family consisting of SP100, SP110, and SP140L, which have high homology with autoimmune regulator (AIRE) ( Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020 22. Fraschilla, I. ∙ Jeffrey, K.L.

Sci. 1998; 23 :242-244 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). SPs all contain an N-terminal caspase activation recruitment domain (CARD) domain, an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and multiple “reader” modules including a SAND domain, a plant homeobox domain (PHD), and a bromodomain (BRD) ( Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020 22. Fraschilla, I. ∙ Jeffrey, K.L. The speckled protein (SP) family: immunity's chromatin readers Trends Immunol. 2020; 41 :572-585 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A), indicative of a role in chromatin regulation. Moreover, SP family members are components of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which are ill-defined subnuclear structures regulated by a variety of cellular stresses such as virus infection, interferon (IFN), and DNA damage, with implicated roles in many cellular processes, including gene repression and higher order chromatin organization ( Huoh et al., 2020 33.

Biol. 2010; 2 :a000661 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Of the SPs, SP140 expression is uniquely restricted to immune cells ( Bloch et al., 1996 10. Bloch, D.B. ∙ de la Monte, S.M. ∙ Guigaouri, P. ... Identification and characterization of a leukocyte-specific component of the nuclear body J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :29198-29204 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), with highest levels in activated macrophages and mature B cells ( Mehta et al., 2017 49.

Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Initial studies found SP140 to be critical for appropriate macrophage cytokine responses to bacteria or virus ( Ji et al., 2021 36. Ji, D.X. ∙ Witt, K.C. ∙ Kotov, D.I. ...

Karaky, M. ∙ Fedetz, M. ∙ Potenciano, V. ... SP140 regulates the expression of immune-related genes associated with multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases by NF-kappaB inhibition Hum. Mol. Genet. 2018; 27 :4012-4023 PubMed Google Scholar ; Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we recently demonstrated that SP140 acts as a co-repressor of lineage-inappropriate genes such as HOX in mature human macrophages, preferentially occupying promoters of these silenced genes within facultative heterochromatin regions marked by H3K27me3 to maintain macrophage identity and functional responses ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD-, MS-, and CLL-associated genetic variants of SP140 alter SP140 mRNA splicing and diminish SP140 protein ( Matesanz et al., 2015 46. Matesanz, F. ∙ Potenciano, V. ∙ Fedetz, M. ... A functional variant that affects exon-skipping and protein expression of SP140 as genetic mechanism predisposing to multiple sclerosis Hum. Mol.

Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we asked mechanistically how this immune chromatin reader normally acts and how perturbations lead to altered SP140 structure and function on chromatin and eventually immune disease, with the intent to identify therapeutic interventions.

Section: Results

To gain molecular insights into the normal function of SP140, we elucidated the SP140 interactome. We ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged human SP140 (FLAG-SP140) or FLAG-empty vector (FLAG-EV) in HEK293T cells ( Figure S1 A, related to Figure 1 ) and subsequently performed mass spectrometry on FLAG co-immunoprecipitants (coIPs). To efficiently discriminate confident interacting proteins from false-positive or contaminant proteins, the probability of bona fide protein-protein interactions was analyzed using the contaminant repository of affinity matrix (CRAPome) and significance analysis of interactome (SAINT) scores ( Mellacheruvu et al., 2013 50. Mellacheruvu, D. ∙ Wright, Z. ∙ Couzens, A.L. ... The CRAPome: a contaminant repository for affinity purification-mass spectrometry data Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :730-736 Crossref Scopus (1107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 A and S1 B; Table S1 , related to Figure 1 ). This approach identified the top significant interactors of SP140 to be: topoisomerases (TOP)1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), facilitates chromatin transactions (FACT) subunits SUPT16H and SSRP1, as well as the ATPase subunit of the imitation switch (ISWI) family of chromatin remodelers, switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 5 (SMARCA5, Figure 1 A). The top 1% of SP140 interacting partners (with false discovery rate [FDR], of less than 1%) broadly clustered under three functional groups ( Szklarczyk et al., 2019 69. Szklarczyk, D. ∙ Gable, A.L. ∙ Lyon, D. ... STRING v11: protein-protein association networks with increased coverage, supporting functional discovery in genome-wide experimental datasets Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D607-D613 Crossref Scopus (10989) PubMed Google Scholar ): “chromatin organization and DNA unwinding,” “RNA processing and splicing,” and “metabolic processes” ( Figure 1 B). Gene ontology (GO) analyses confirmed that the SP140 interactome was associated with “DNA topological change,” “nucleosome organization,” and “DNA unwinding” ( Figure S1 C, related to Figure 1 ).
We previously observed that SP140 represses chromatin accessibility in human macrophages ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ); hence, we explored SP140 interactions with chromatin organization and DNA unwinding proteins TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-PK SUPT16H, SSRP1, and SMARCA5. Through immunoprecipitation (IP) of FLAG in HEK293T expressing FLAG-SP140 or FLAG-EV and immunoblot of FLAG, we confirmed SP140 interacted with endogenous TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-PK, SUPT16H, SSRP1, and SMARCA5 ( Figure 1 C). Reciprocal IP of endogenous TOP1, TOP2A, DNA-PK, SUPT16H, SSRP1, and SMARCA5 and immunoblot of FLAG validated these interactions ( Figure S1 D, related to Figure 1 ). Moreover, IP of endogenous SP140 in human monocyte THP1 cells and primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) confirmed these interactions exist in relevant immune cells ( Figures 1 D and S1 E, related to Figure 1 ). SP140 complexes with TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-PK, SUPT16H, SSRP1, and SMARCA5 required structured DNA, since addition of the intercalating agent ethidium bromide (EtBr) disrupted their interactions ( Figures S1 F and S1G, related to Figure 1 ). Furthermore, the chromatin “reading” PHD and BRD of SP140 were also necessary for these protein-protein interactions ( Figure 1 E). However, the CARD domain, known for protein multimerization and localization of SP proteins to PML bodies ( Huoh et al., 2020 33. Huoh, Y.S. ∙ Wu, B. ∙ Park, S. ... Dual functions of Aire CARD multimerization in the transcriptional regulation of T cell tolerance Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1625 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ) was not required for SP140 interactions with TOPs ( Figure S1 H, related to Figure 1 ). In addition, SP140 has been previously identified to be a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) target ( Zucchelli et al., 2019 78. Zucchelli, C. ∙ Tamburri, S. ∙ Filosa, G. ... Sp140 is a multi-SUMO-1 target and its PHD finger promotes SUMOylation of the adjacent bromodomain Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2019; 1863 :456-465 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mutation of the top predicted SUMOylation site within SP140 (K762A), previously shown to disrupt SP140 SUMOylation ( Zucchelli et al., 2019 78. Zucchelli, C. ∙ Tamburri, S. ∙ Filosa, G. ... Sp140 is a multi-SUMO-1 target and its PHD finger promotes SUMOylation of the adjacent bromodomain Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2019; 1863 :456-465 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), had no impact on SP140 interaction with TOPs ( Figure S1 I, related to Figure 1 ). Thus, SP140 interaction with chromatin via its PHD and BRD reader domains is the primary driver of SP140-TOP complex formation. We next assessed whether TOPs or DNA-PK may be primary interacting proteins upon which the complex formed. Exposure of cells to TOP1 inhibitor Topotecan (TPT) or TOP2 inhibitor Etoposide (ETO, Figure S1 J, related to Figure 1 ) or siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of TOP1 or TOP2A resulted in a loss of SP140 and TOP interaction but did not affect SP140 interactions with DNA-PK, SUPT16H, or SMARCA5 ( Figure S1 K, related to Figure 1 ). Similarly, DNA-PK ( PRKDC ) siRNA led to partial loss of SP140 binding to TOP1, but all other interactions remained intact ( Figure S1 L, related to Figure 1 ). Thus, SP140 forms multiple distinct protein complexes, characteristic of flexible IDR-containing proteins that form phase-separated condensates ( Sabari et al., 2018 63. Sabari, B.R. ∙ Dall'Agnese, A. ∙ Boija, A. ... Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control Science. 2018; 361 :eaar3958 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, many of the SP140 interacting proteins we identified were previously found to interact with AIRE, which shares protein homology with SP140 ( Figure S2 A, related to Figure 1 ) ( Abramson et al., 2010 1. Abramson, J. ∙ Giraud, M. ∙ Benoist, C. ... Aire's partners in the molecular control of immunological tolerance Cell. 2010; 140 :123-135 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bansal et al., 2017 6. Bansal, K. ∙ Yoshida, H. ∙ Benoist, C. ... The transcriptional regulator Aire binds to and activates super-enhancers Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :263-273 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, although AIRE promotes transcription of peripheral-tissue antigens in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) ( Mathis and Benoist, 2009 47. Mathis, D. ∙ Benoist, C. Aire Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 :287-312 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ), our current working model is one in which SP140 functions as a transcriptional repressor. Consistent with this notion, the common SP140 and AIRE interacting partners included chromatin remodeling and DNA unwinding proteins (TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-PK, and SUPT16H), whereas transcriptional elongation machineries (PTEFb and BRD4) that enable transcription were exclusively associated with AIRE and not SP140 ( Figure S2 B, related to Figure 1 ). Furthermore, although SP140 and AIRE are generally expressed in different cell types ( Fraschilla and Jeffrey, 2020 22. Fraschilla, I. ∙ Jeffrey, K.L. The speckled protein (SP) family: immunity's chromatin readers Trends Immunol. 2020; 41 :572-585 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), we co-transfected AIRE and SP140 and found that SP140 and AIRE did not compete for binding of endogenous TOP1 or TOP2A ( Figure S2 C, related to Figure 1 ), suggesting that SP140 and AIRE interact with distinct pools of TOPs.
We next examined the consequence of disease risk loss-of-function SP140 on its ability to form the identified protein complexes. The genomic region containing SP140 was definitively associated with inflammatory bowel disease in one of the largest association studies that consisted of ∼15k CD, 11k Ulcerative Colitis, and ∼16k controls ( Jostins et al., 2012 37. Jostins, L. ∙ Ripke, S. ∙ Weersma, R.K. ... Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2012; 491 :119-124 Crossref Scopus (3643) PubMed Google Scholar ). It was identified as being primarily associated with CD, with an odds ratio for CD of 1.13 (95% CI, 1.089–1.18). In European-derived populations where this variant was identified, rs28445040, which encodes the splicing variant studied herein, has a minor allele frequency of ∼0.20 in patients with CD and ∼0.18 in controls. This variant of SP140 is at the start of exon 7 that changes the RNA from UCCU to UCUU ( Figures S3 A and S3B, related to Figure 1 ). UCUU is a known binding site of polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB), an established exon repressor during mRNA splicing ( Hamon et al., 2004 27. Hamon, S. ∙ Le Sommer, C. ∙ Mereau, A. ... Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein is involved in vivo in repression of a composite internal/3′ -terminal exon of the Xenopus alpha-tropomyosin Pre-mRNA J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :22166-22175 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xue et al., 2009 75. Xue, Y. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Wu, T. ...

Cell. 2009; 36 :996-1006 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). UCUU is also at the start of exon 11, possibly explaining why a significant elevation of an SP140 mRNA isoform lacking both exons 7 and 11 was observed with CD-associated SP140 mutations ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beyond a splicing defect, this synonymous polymorphism may also affect the rate of protein translation and stability ( Sauna and Kimchi-Sarfaty, 2011 64. Sauna, Z.E. ∙ Kimchi-Sarfaty, C. Understanding the contribution of synonymous mutations to human disease Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12 :683-691 Crossref Scopus (766) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 B, related to Figure 1 ). Indeed, we confirmed that fresh PBMCs taken from CD patients homozygous for SP140 mutations had equivalent amounts of SP140 exon 1 but significantly reduced levels of exon 7 ( Figure S3 C, related to Figure 1 ), indicative of exon 7 exclusion. Furthermore, lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LBLs) derived from CD patients bearing SP140 CD-associated mutations displayed a consistent loss of protein compared with controls ( Figure S3 D, related to Figure 1 ). We also converted these LBLs to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated the iPSCs into human M(IFNγ) macrophages to reveal that the diminished SP140 protein was apparent in SP140 mut macrophages ( Figure S3 E, related to Figure 1 ). We next examined the dominant interactors of endogenous SP140 in patient-derived LBLs by mass spectrometry and found that similar to observations in HEK293T and THP1 cells, the top SP140 interactors were chromatin remodeling and DNA unwinding proteins TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-PK, SUPT16H, and SSRP1, which was confirmed by coIP ( Figures 1 F and 1G). Importantly, these interactions were lost in patients homozygous for loss-of-function CD-associated genetic variants of SP140 (SP140 mut , Figures 1 F and 1G) that exhibited loss of SP140 protein. To confirm whether the loss of SP140 protein complexes was due to the total loss of SP140 or was specifically due to changes in the IDR where the excluded exons 7 and 11 normally code ( Figure S3 B), we constructed mutants of SP140 that lack exon 7, exon 11, or both exons 7 and 11, as observed in patients homozygous for SP140 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs28445040 ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as a mutant of SP140 lacking the entire IDR. We found that none of these locations of SP140 were required for SP140-TOP interactions, demonstrating that the loss of SP140-TOP interactions in CD patients bearing SP140 mutations is due to the total loss of SP140 protein rather than the remaining truncated SP140 lacking parts of the IDR ( Figure S3 F, related to Figure 1 ). Notably, there was not simply a loss of all SP140 interacting proteins in SP140 mut immune cells, but a re-wiring of the SP140 proteome was also observed. This included enhanced interactions between the remaining SP140 and proteins-associated RNA processing and splicing factors ( Figures S3 G and S3H, related to Figure 1 ) possibly skewing SP140 toward these functions. Together, these data reveal that SP140 interacts with essential DNA unwinding and chromatin remodeling proteins, and these complexes are disrupted with CD, MS, or CLL-risk SP140 loss of function.
The TOP enzymes TOP1 and TOP2A/B cleave one or both DNA strands, respectively, to resolve DNA topological constraints for replication, transcription, and chromatin organization ( Pommier et al., 2016 55. Pommier, Y. ∙ Sun, Y. ∙ Huang, S.N. ... Roles of eukaryotic topoisomerases in transcription, replication and genomic stability Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :703-721 Crossref Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ). For transcription, TOPs are required for the relief of torsional strain as a result of chromatin remodeling, nucleosome depletion at enhancers or promoters, as well as RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) pausing and elongation ( Pommier et al., 2016 55. Pommier, Y. ∙ Sun, Y. ∙ Huang, S.N. ... Roles of eukaryotic topoisomerases in transcription, replication and genomic stability Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17 :703-721 Crossref Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, in addition to RNA Pol II itself ( Baranello et al., 2016 7. Baranello, L. ∙ Wojtowicz, D. ∙ Cui, K. ...

Commun. 2016; 7 :10549 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). SP140 predominantly occupies facultative heterochromatin ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ); hence, we postulated that SP140 negatively regulates TOPs to prevent unsolicited transcription or chromatin decompaction at dynamic silent regions. Intriguingly, purified recombinant SP140 protein suppressed the ability of recombinant TOP1 to nick and unwind a supercoiled DNA substrate in vitro ( Figure 2 A). Furthermore, recombinant SP140 significantly decreased TOP2A decatenatory activity in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 B). Upon SP140 depletion in THP1 monocytes ( Figure 2 C) or primary human peripheral blood-derived macrophages ( Figure 2 E), we observed significantly increased TOP1 activity in nuclear lysates, both at baseline and upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation despite unchanged TOP1 protein levels ( Figures 2 D and 2F). Furthermore, comparative analysis of the different SP family members (SP100, SP110, SP140, and SP140L) in human monocytes revealed that TOP repression is unique to SP140 and its paralog, SP140L ( Figure S4 , related to Figure 2 ). Conversely, overexpression of SP140 in HEK293T cells suppressed nuclear TOP1 activity in a dose-dependent manner to levels of repression observed by TPT, an FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor that intercalates between cleaved DNA ends in the active site of the enzyme ( Vos et al., 2011 71. Vos, S.M. ∙ Tretter, E.M. ∙ Schmidt, B.H. ... All tangled up: how cells direct, manage and exploit topoisomerase function Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :827-841 Crossref Scopus (486) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 G and 2H). Importantly, immune cells bearing loss-of-function SP140 displayed significantly increased TOP1 activity that could be reversed with TPT administration ( Figures 2 I and 2J). Thus, our results identified SP140 as a suppressor of TOP1 and TOP2 activity and unmask a specific compromise in this hallmark function of SP140 in patients bearing CD-, MS-, and CLL-associated genetic variants of SP140.
Recruitment of TOP1 and TOP2 at gene regulatory elements leads to transcriptional-associated DNA breaks that activates DNA damage response pathways ( Puc et al., 2017 56. Puc, J. ∙ Aggarwal, A.K. ∙ Rosenfeld, M.G. Physiological functions of programmed DNA breaks in signal-induced transcription Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Certainly, TOP-mediated double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are required for transcription initiation and elongation ( Bunch et al., 2015 13. Bunch, H. ∙ Lawney, B.P. ∙ Lin, Y.F. ... Transcriptional elongation requires DNA break-induced signalling Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :10191 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ju et al., 2006 38. Ju, B.G. ∙ Lunyak, V.V. ∙ Perissi, V. ... A topoisomerase IIbeta-mediated dsDNA break required for regulated transcription Science. 2006; 312 :1798-1802 Crossref Scopus (711) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore assessed levels of phosphorylation of the Serine 139 residue of the histone variant H2AX (gamma-H2AX, γH2AX), as a specific and sensitive molecular marker of DSBs and transcriptional activation. CRISPR-mediated deletion of Sp140 in Cas9 transgenic mouse macrophages or siRNA-mediated KD of SP140 in THP1 human monocytes resulted in significantly higher levels of γH2AX ( Figures 3 A and 3B). The enhanced γH2AX observed in SP140 KD cells was not due to differences in DNA DSBs from canonical DNA damage as cell viability, cell cycle phases, and levels of phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) were unaffected by SP140 depletion ( Figure S5 , related to Figure 3 ), consistent with previous findings ( Kim et al., 2019 40. Kim, J.J. ∙ Lee, S.Y. ∙ Gong, F. ... Systematic bromodomain protein screens identify homologous recombination and R-loop suppression pathways involved in genome integrity Genes Dev. 2019; 33 :1751-1774 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, patient-derived LBLs bearing disease-associated SP140 loss-of-function variants displayed significantly increased γH2AX, which was concomitant with the amount of SP140 protein loss ( Figure 3 C). We next asked if gained γH2AX in the absence of SP140 was preferentially occurring at facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3, where SP140 chiefly resides ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, confocal microscopy of murine or human macrophages revealed that elevated γH2AX mostly occurred at the nuclear periphery upon SP140 deletion or KD ( Figures 3 D and 3E), where compacted H3K27me3+ facultative heterochromatin and low transcription activity is located ( Buchwalter et al., 2019 12. Buchwalter, A. ∙ Kaneshiro, J.M. ∙ Hetzer, M.W. Coaching from the sidelines: the nuclear periphery in genome regulation Nat. Rev. Genet. 2019; 20 :39-50 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, chromatin IP (ChIP) of γH2AX in primary human macrophages found a preferential gain of γH2AX at normally silenced loci HOXA7 , HOXB9, and FOXB1 , with unaltered γH2AX occupancy at the constitutively transcribed housekeeping gene, β-actin ( ACTB ) following siRNA-mediated KD of SP140 ( Figure 3 F). Thus, in the absence of SP140, transcriptional breaks and genome instability occur at normally silenced regions. To assess if levels of H3K27me3 influenced SP140 and TOP interactions, we treated macrophages with GSK343, an inhibitor of the H3K27me3 “writer” Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 Subunit Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2), and found that interactions between SP140 and TOP1 or TOP2A were diminished ( Figure 3 G) when H3K27me3 was reduced.
To gain insight into how SP140 prevents TOP activity, we assessed TOP1 and TOP2 association with chromatin when SP140 protein levels were perturbed using a previously established TOP chromatin association biochemical assay ( Dykhuizen et al., 2013 19. Dykhuizen, E.C. ∙ Hargreaves, D.C. ∙ Miller, E.L. ... BAF complexes facilitate decatenation of DNA by topoisomerase IIalpha Nature. 2013; 497 :624-627 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we found that SP140 shields TOP1 and 2 from association with chromatin, such that less TOP1 and TOP2 remained associated with chromatin after high salt wash in cells overexpressing SP140 compared with vector control cells ( Figure 4 A). Reduced binding of TOP1 or 2 to chromatin in the presence of SP140 would be expected to compromise function and could represent an inability of TOP1 or TOP2 to associate with substrate DNA. Moreover, TOP1 and TOP2A genome-wide occupancy in primary human macrophages, as assessed by cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag), revealed a preferential gain of both TOP1 and TOP2 at H3K27me3 rich regions upon KD of SP140 ( Figures 4 B–4D), such as developmentally silenced loci HOXA7 and FOXF1 ( Figure 4 E). Furthermore, GO biological processes and epigenomics roadmap signatures of the loci with enhanced TOP1 and TOP2A occupancy upon SP140 KD reflected those regulating cell fate and identity and associated with markers of heterochromatin, H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 ( Figures 4 F–4I). TOP1 can occupy transcriptionally silent regions, but this is reduced compared with transcriptionally active regions ( Baranello et al., 2016 7. Baranello, L. ∙ Wojtowicz, D. ∙ Cui, K. ... RNA polymerase II regulates topoisomerase 1 activity to favor efficient transcription Cell. 2016; 165 :357-371 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), and TOP2 acts to resolve facultative heterochromatin structure ( Miller et al., 2017 51. Miller, E.L. ∙ Hargreaves, D.C. ∙ Kadoch, C. ... TOP2 synergizes with BAF chromatin remodeling for both resolution and formation of facultative heterochromatin Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2017; 24 :344-352 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data reveal SP140 as gatekeeper of TOP activity by physically shielding TOP1 and TOP2 preferentially from these locations. Loss of SP140 leads to enhanced TOP interaction with heterochromatic regions, aberrantly increased chromatin accessibility ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) and depressed transcriptional activity and/or transcriptional potential at these normally silenced regions.
The ex vivo reversal of TOP activity with TPT provided proof of concept for use of TOP inhibitors in SP140-deficient cells. We therefore next explored the use of TOP inhibition to rescue defective innate immune transcriptional programs driven by loss of SP140 ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a key driver of disrupted immune-microbiome interactions in inflammatory bowel disease ( Blander et al., 2017 9. Blander, J.M. ∙ Longman, R.S. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ... Regulation of inflammation by microbiota interactions with the host Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :851-860 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ; Graham and Xavier, 2020 26. Graham, D.B. ∙ Xavier, R.J. Pathway paradigms revealed from the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2020; 578 :527-539 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). TOP1 inhibitor TPT is used clinically for treatment of small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer ( Horita et al., 2015 31. Horita, N. ∙ Yamamoto, M. ∙ Sato, T. ... Topotecan for relapsed small-cell lung cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of 1347 patients Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :15437 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas ETO is approved for treatment of refractory testicular tumor and small cell lung cancer ( Loehrer, 1991 45. Loehrer, Sr., P.J. Etoposide therapy for testicular cancer Cancer. 1991; 67 :220-224 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, lower doses of TOP inhibitors can successfully modulate microbe-inducible gene transcription and inflammation in vivo ( Ho et al., 2021 30. Ho, J.S.Y. ∙ Mok, B.W. ∙ Campisi, L. ... Top1 inhibition therapy protects against SARS-CoV-2-induced lethal inflammation Cell. 2021; 184 :2618-2632.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rialdi et al., 2016 61. Rialdi, A. ∙ Campisi, L. ∙ Zhao, N. ... Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as Aire-dependent immunological tolerance ( Bansal et al., 2017 6. Bansal, K. ∙ Yoshida, H. ∙ Benoist, C. ... The transcriptional regulator Aire binds to and activates super-enhancers Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :263-273 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment of SP140 KD primary human macrophages with TPT or ETO reduced inappropriate overexpression of HOXA9 and PAX5 at baseline ( Figures 5 A–5D) and also restored impaired transcription of cytokines IL6 or IL12B in response to LPS ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Moreover, KD of RNA splicing factors DDX27, DHX30, and NOP56, found to also interact with SP140, did not restore HOX or cytokine expression in SP140 KD macrophages ( Figures S6 A and S6B, related to Figure 5 ) indicating a specific reliance on TOPs for SP140 regulation of these transcripts. In addition, human SP140 KD macrophages displayed impaired antimicrobial activity toward CD-associated adherent invasive E. coli , C. rodentium , or S. typhimurium as assessed by gentamicin protection assays ( Figures 5 G–5I). This microbial killing defect in the absence of SP140 was downstream of depressed developmentally silenced genes such as HOXA9 ( Figure 5 J) and was also successfully rescued by TOP 1 or 2 inhibitors ( Figures 5 G–5I).
We next exposed PBMCs taken directly from CD patients bearing wild-type (WT) or CD-associated SP140 mutations to TPT or ETO. Fitting with enhanced TOP1 activity, more genes were responsive to TPT activity in SP140 loss-of-function cells than WT cells ( Figure 5 K), likely reflecting a new chromatin signature susceptible to TOP inhibition ( Rialdi et al., 2016 61. Rialdi, A. ∙ Campisi, L. ∙ Zhao, N. ... Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ) upon loss of SP140. TPT or ETO delivery suppressed inappropriate upregulation of multiple genes in SP140 mutant PBMCs including LINC000475 , RASIP1 , PHLDA2/3 , and PAX5/8 but, importantly, also restored expression of inducible cytokines including IL6, IL36G, IL12B, IL23A, TNF, and IL1A back to WT levels ( Figure 5 L). In fact, TPT or ETO rescued expression of ∼50% or ∼40% of aberrantly upregulated or downregulated genes in SP140 mutant CD patient PBMCs, respectively ( Figure 5 M). Importantly, the upregulated lineage-inappropriate genes in SP140 mutant PBMCs were those genes with a higher likelihood of being normally occupied by SP140 ( Figure 5 N; Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, downregulated genes such as inducible cytokines were less likely to be occupied by SP140, suggesting an indirect effect of SP140 loss of function on these genes ( Figure 5 N). Furthermore, those genes whose irregular expression was rescued by TPT or ETO in CD SP140 mutant PBMCs were more likely to be normally occupied by SP140 ( Figure 5 N). Similarly, TPT or ETO target genes in SP140 mutant PBMCs were also more likely to reside in heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 ( Figure 5 O). Consistently, unchecked TOP activity and rescue of this activity in SP140 mutant PBMCs from CD patients with TOP inhibition occurs at loci normally occupied and repressed by SP140 within facultative heterochromatin.
Defective innate immunity and bacterial killing by resident tissue macrophages is a hallmark feature of inflammatory bowel disease ( Graham and Xavier, 2020 26. Graham, D.B. ∙ Xavier, R.J. Pathway paradigms revealed from the genetics of inflammatory bowel disease Nature. 2020; 578 :527-539 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peloquin et al., 2016 54. Peloquin, J.M. ∙ Goel, G. ∙ Villablanca, E.J. ... Mechanisms of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :31-64 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sp140 −/− mice had significantly exacerbated DSS-colitis compared with WT controls, as measured by weight loss over time ( Figure 6 A), reduced colon length, and increased interleukin (IL)-6 and TNF in supernatants of colon explants ( Figures 6 A–6D). These results were confirmed by histological analysis ( Figure 6 E) and are consistent with previous data using shRNA-mediated Sp140 KD mice ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, administration of WT macrophages to Sp140 deficient animals was able to revert the exacerbated DSS-colitis, indicating that Sp140 deficiency specifically in macrophages is the major driver of colitis ( Figures 6 A–6E). We therefore next examined the ability of TOP1 or TOP2 inhibition to rescue these macrophage defects for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease associated specifically with loss of Sp140. Similar to primary human macrophages, Sp140 deficient-bone marrow-derived macrophages displayed impaired bacterial killing against E. coli , C. rodentium or S. typhimurium that was restored with addition of TPT, ETO, or their combination ( Figures 6 F–6H). Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of single or combined TPT and ETO (1 mg/kg each) delivered every other day significantly and specifically alleviated weight loss, rescued tissue architecture, edema and leukocyte infiltration, and reverted colon length in Sp140 −/− mice ( Figures 6 I–6K). In addition, markers of intestinal inflammation, including fecal lipocalin-2 and interleukin (IL)-6 and TNF in supernatants of colon explants of Sp140 −/− mice, were all restored with TOP inhibitor administration ( Figures 6 L–6N). TOP1 or TOP2 inhibitors had no effect on the severity of DSS-colitis in WT mice ( Figures 6 F–6N), further demonstrating an enhanced effectiveness of TOP inhibitors in the context of SP140 deficiency.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Mutations in chromatin reader SP140 are associated with at least three human immune-mediated diseases ( International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics et al., 2013 35.

Ipr1 gene mediates innate immunity to tuberculosis Nature. 2005; 434 :767-772 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ), directly implicating it in immunoregulation. Despite this, mechanistic insight into SP140 function in health or disease are limited. Here, we have identified a critical functional role for SP140 in the prevention of DNA accessibility and transcription by repressing and shielding TOPs at heterochromatin. Applying a combination of human genetics, proteomics, biochemistry, and utilization of primary immune cells from CD individuals and in vivo animal studies, our study highlights the power of examining human disease-associated mutations to advance mechanistic understanding of chromatin regulators in healthy and disease states. Thus, SP140 maintains inappropriate gene silencing stabilizing both immune cell identity and inducible innate immune transcriptional programs.
To define the SP140-interactome, we characterized the protein complexes associated with SP140 in HEK293T and patient LBL cells. The predominant protein interactors of SP140 were determined to be DNA unwinding and chromatin remodeling proteins including TOP1, TOP2A, TOP2B, DNA-PK, FACT components SUPT16H and SSRP1, as well as SMARCA5. We uncovered a prominent role of SP140 as a negative regulator of TOP1 and 2, and inhibition of either TOP restored derailed transcription due to SP140 loss. Our previous studies revealed SP140 occupancy significantly correlated with the facultative heterochromatin marker, H3K27me3, in primary human macrophages. Loss of SP140 led to increased chromatin accessibility and expression of inappropriate lineage genes such as homeobox ( HOX ) A9 that impair the functional response of differentiated macrophages ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, we propose a model in which SP140, through its recognition of modified histones by its PHD and BRD “reader” modules, interacts with DNA unwinding and chromatin remodeling proteins such as TOPs to shield them from, and prevent chromatin remodeling and transcription, at facultative heterochromatin. This function of SP140 maintains gene silencing and safeguards the differentiated immune cell state and appropriate responses to environmental cues. Notably, this function of SP140, is in contrast to the well-characterized and homologous chromatin reader, Aire which acts to promote transcription via TOPs ( Abramson et al., 2010 1. Abramson, J. ∙ Giraud, M. ∙ Benoist, C. ... Aire's partners in the molecular control of immunological tolerance Cell. 2010; 140 :123-135 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bansal et al., 2017 6. Bansal, K. ∙ Yoshida, H. ∙ Benoist, C. ... The transcriptional regulator Aire binds to and activates super-enhancers Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :263-273 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, SP140 is one of few endogenous proteins characterized to date that negatively regulate TOPs to the best of our knowledge ( Andersen et al., 2002 5. Andersen, F.F. ∙ Tange, T.Ø. ∙ Sinnathamby, T. ... The RNA splicing factor ASF/SF2 inhibits human topoisomerase I mediated DNA relaxation J. Mol.

AID-induced decrease in topoisomerase 1 induces DNA structural alteration and DNA cleavage for class switch recombination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :22375-22380 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings further reinforce the importance of chromatin regulatory proteins in silencing lineage-specifying transcription factor genes to maintain a functional cell state ( Becker et al., 2016 8. Becker, J.S. ∙ Nicetto, D. ∙ Zaret, K.S. H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin: barrier to cell fate changes Trends Genet. 2016; 32 :29-41 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further speculate that this SP140-dependent TOP regulation is a requirement in macrophages due to their unique mobility and responsiveness to stimuli while detecting and adapting to environmental cues.
Innate immune cells, especially intestinal macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), support microbial balance, barrier integrity, and tissue repair while maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Moreover, epigenetics is a major mechanism by which these cells integrate microbial and environmental cues to elicit these functions ( Amatullah and Jeffrey, 2020 3. Amatullah, H. ∙ Jeffrey, K.L. Epigenome-metabolome-microbiome axis in health and IBD Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2020; 56 :97-108 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, chromatin regulator Bap180/Baf180 (subunit of the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNFcomplex) acts as a conserved transcriptional repressor for maintenance of innate immune homeostasis in the intestine ( He et al., 2017 29. He, X. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Wang, M. ... Bap180/Baf180 is required to maintain homeostasis of intestinal innate immune response in Drosophila and mice Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :17056 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, histone deacetylase, (HDAC)3, is essential for integration of the host IEC response to diverse microbial and metabolic cues for intestinal homeostasis ( Alenghat et al., 2013 2. Alenghat, T. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Saenz, S.A. ...

Our studies now ascribe a function for epigenetic reader SP140 in chromatin-mediated gene silencing within innate immune cells for lineage-defining and inducible transcriptional programs that is critical in human immune-mediated disease. Defective innate immunity upon SP140 loss is consistent with multiple studies that revealed a dysfunctional innate immunity as a driver of impaired bacterial sensing and clearance and susceptibility to intestinal inflammation ( Burgueño and Abreu, 2020 14.

Indeed, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified loss-of-function mutations in multiple innate immune pathways (e.g., NOD2, ATG16L1, and AIM2) as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ( Graham and Xavier, 2020 26.

Sp140 deficiency was recently shown to result in elevated type I IFN in vivo leading to increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis and L. pneumophila infection ( Ji et al., 2021 36.

Role of the transcriptional regulator SP140 in resistance to bacterial infections via repression of type I interferons eLife. 2021; 10 Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar ). It is appealing to speculate that this elevated type I IFN is due to accumulating double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks ( Brzostek-Racine et al., 2011 11.

Although loss of SP140 resulted in unleashed TOP activity and impaired macrophage function, TOP inhibition effectively restored transcriptional homeostasis and protected SP140 −/− mice during DSS-colitis in vivo . Intriguingly, DSS-colitis in WT animals was unaffected by TOP inhibition, despite TOP inhibitors attenuating acute inflammation in models of sepsis and COVID ( Ho et al., 2021 30. Ho, J.S.Y. ∙ Mok, B.W. ∙ Campisi, L. ...

Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is established that a major determinant of action of TOP inhibitors is chromatin state ( Ho et al., 2021 30. Ho, J.S.Y. ∙ Mok, B.W. ∙ Campisi, L. ... Top1 inhibition therapy protects against SARS-CoV-2-induced lethal inflammation Cell. 2021; 184 :2618-2632.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rialdi et al., 2016 61.

Topoisomerase 1 inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation Science. 2016; 352 :aad7993 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we propose that in the context of SP140 deficiency, TOP inhibitors are specifically redirected to derepressed lineage inappropriate genes because of their enhanced chromatin accessibility and gained TOP occupancy. Furthermore, there are multiple examples where inhibition of innate immune components and cytokines has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in sepsis and other acute inflammation models but showed little effect, or even exacerbated, IBD in mouse models and in clinical trials ( Choy et al., 2020 15. Choy, E.H. ∙ De Benedetti, F. ∙ Takeuchi, T. ... Translating IL-6 biology into effective treatments Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2020; 16 :335-345 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ; Friedrich et al., 2019 23. Friedrich, M. ∙ Pohin, M. ∙ Powrie, F. Cytokine networks in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease Immunity. 2019; 50 :992-1006 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ), further emphasizing the importance of a functional innate response for intestinal homeostasis. More characterization of TOP inhibition directly in SP140-mutant CD patients will be important for establishing the clinical impact of our work.
Finally, there is significant interest by the global research community in developing small molecule inhibitors of chromatin readers. However, a poorly understood feature of many chromatin ‘readers’ is how specificity of function is achieved through their interaction in multi-protein complexes and how this can be leveraged for therapeutic benefit when their loss-of-function drives disease. Moreover, although oncogenic outcomes are frequently reported ( Filippakopoulos et al., 2010 20. Filippakopoulos, P. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Picaud, S. ... Selective inhibition of BET bromodomains Nature. 2010; 468 :1067-1073 Crossref Scopus (3237) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wan et al., 2020 72. Wan, L. ∙ Chong, S. ∙ Xuan, F. ...

ZMYND11 links histone H3.3K36me3 to transcription elongation and tumour suppression Nature. 2014; 508 :263-268 Crossref Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ), human immune pathologies resulting from mutated chromatin regulators are less defined. Collectively, this work expands our knowledge of the types of human diseases that are caused by “misreading” histone modifications. Furthermore, it reveals a mechanism-based strategy to rescue loss-of-function SP140 in human immune disease. CD remains incurable by surgical or therapeutic interventions; hence, future studies may examine a precision-guided approach of FDA-approved TOP inhibitors for the treatment of CD, and potentially MS and CLL patients with loss of SP140, as well as examine potential roles of SP140 in metabolism and RNA processing.
Interactions between SP140 and chromatin remodeling and DNA unwinding proteins such as TOPs were lost in SP140 mutant immune cells, but a gain of interactions between SP140 and multiple RNA processing-related proteins was observed. These results indicate that the loss of SP140 in immune disease does not just result in diminishment of the SP140 interactome but rather a functional rewiring of the SP140 interactome is apparent. The importance of RNA processing and how it may influence RNA splicing and generation of alternative transcripts in SP140-driven disease remains an important avenue to be investigated further. Aire, similarly, complexes with RNA processing proteins and influences alternative splicing of its target genes ( Abramson et al., 2010 1. Abramson, J. ∙ Giraud, M. ∙ Benoist, C. ... Aire's partners in the molecular control of immunological tolerance Cell. 2010; 140 :123-135 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, whether SP140 operates in a similar fashion in B cells, and if unleashed, TOP activity is a driver of CLL or MS upon SP140 loss of function warrants investigation. Future studies should also examine the role of other SP140 interactors identified in our mass spectrometry for regulation of transcription including chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 and the FACT complex. LPS-stimulated PBMCs from CD patients with WT or mutant SP140 were subjected to unbiased bulk-RNA-seq and blinded bioinformatic analysis, but sample size was limited to the MGH cohort. Additional experiments testing SP140 KD experiments were consistent with SP140 mutant data. Follow-up work should expand to more CD patient numbers from other patient cohorts and to SP140 loss-of-function patients of other ethnicities and explored in other diseases associated with SP140 loss-of-function mutations. Moreover, since CD-associated SP140 variants trigger altered mRNA splicing and splicing is cell-type dependent, it would be pertinent to examine which cell types, including macrophage subpopulations, within the intestine of SP140 mut patients lose SP140 protein most prominently.

Healthy human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 20-30 mL of blood buffy coats from human volunteers (Blood Components Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital). All patient blood samples were collected under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) from patients that were enrolled in the “Prospective Registry in IBD Study at Massachusetts General Hospital (PRISM, IRB# FWA00003136) and genotyped by CD-risk SP140 SNPs rs28445040 and rs6716753 Study research coordinators obtained consent and medical history and data was confirmed by review of the electronic medical record. Patient metadata is provided in Table S2 . Briefly, mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation of PBS-diluted buffy coat/blood (1:2) over Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). The PBMC layer was carefully removed and washed 3 times with PBS. In order to differentiate into macrophages, PBMCs were re-suspended in X-VIVO medium (Lonza) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and incubated at 37 o C, 5% CO 2 for 1h to adhere to the tissue culture dish. After 1h, adherent cells were washed 3 times with PBS and differentiated in complete X-VIVO medium containing 100 ng/mL human M-CSF (Peprotech) for 7 days at 37 o C, 5% CO 2 . On day 4, cultures were supplemented with one volume of complete X-VIVO medium containing 100 ng/mL human M-CSF. 1 million PBMCs or mature macrophages were plated and pretreated with DMSO, topotecan (100nM) or etoposide (25μM) for 1 hour prior to 0.1mg/mL LPS treatment for 4 hours.
All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions according to the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), and all animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by the MGH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and in compliance with appropriate ethical regulations. For all experiments, age-matched (8-10 week) female mice Sp140 knockout or wildtype controls were used.
HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM media (Life Technologies) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% heat-inactivated Hyclone fetal bovine serum (FBS, GE Healthcare). THP-1 human monocytes were maintained in RPMI media (Life Technologies) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% heat-inactivated Hyclone fetal bovine serum (FBS, GE Healthcare).
Full-length cDNA encoding human SP140 was amplified from LPS-stimulated primary human peripheral blood derived macrophages. A plasmid expressing SP140 was made by cloning the purified SP140 cDNA into the p3xFLAG-CMV-10 vector (Addgene) using Gateway techniques (Invitrogen). SP140 mutants lacking DNA binding SAND domain (amino acids 580-661, SP140ΔSAND), or chromatin reading Plant homeobox domain (amino acids 690-736 PHD, SP140ΔPHD), Bromodomain (amino acids 746-865, SP140ΔBromo), or CARD domain (amino acids 22-138, SP140ΔCARD), Intrinsically Disordered Region (amino acids 219-413, SP140 ΔIDR), Exon 7 (amino acids 222-247, SP140ΔExon 7), and Exon 11 (amino acids 353-386, SP140ΔExon 11) were generated by overlap-extension PCR using Phusion HF polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Human SP140 K762A point mutations were introduced via site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange II (Agilent). HA-Aire plasmid was obtained from Sun Hur (Boston Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School).
THP-1 human monocytes or mature primary human peripheral blood derived macrophages were transfected with control (D-001810-10-05, Dharmacon) or SP140 (L-016508-00-0005, Dharmacon) SMARTpool siRNA (100nM) using HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen) or RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) for 48 hours followed by 4 hour LPS treatment (0.1mg/mL). HEK293T cells were used for knockdown experiments with 100nM of Topoisomerase 1 siRNA (siGENOME SMARTpool Human TOP1, M-005278-00-0005, Dharmacon), Topoisomerase 2a siRNA (siGENOME SMARTpool Human TOP2A, M-004239-02-005, Dharmacon), DNA-PK siRNA (siGENOME SMARTpool Human PRKDC, M-005030-01-0005, Dharmacon) and Control (siGENOME Non-Targeting siRNA Pool #1, D-001206-13-05). For double knockdown experiments, primary human peripheral blood derived macrophages were incubated with additional siRNAs: HOXA9 (Human HOXA9 siRNA, L-006337-00-005, Dharmacon) DDX27 (Human DDX27, L-013635-01-0005, Dharmacon), DHX30 (Human DHX30, L-017196-01-0005) and NOP56 (Human NOP56, L-019143-01-005, Dharmacon).
Immortalized Cas9 overexpressing bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages were a kind gift from Dr. Kate Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts Medical School). Mouse guide RNA sequences against SP140 were designed using Broad Institute’s sgRNA design algorithm ( https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design ). Guide 1 (TGTTGGGGAACATATGACAC) and Guide 2 (AAGGAAAAATTCAAACAAGG) sequences were cloned into lentiGuide-puro plasmid (Addgene, #52963), transformed in Stbl3 bacteria (Invitrogen, C7373-03), and subsequently purified with Qiagen Miniprep Kit. LentiGuide-Puro empty vector (control) or SP140 gRNA cloned plasmids were then co-transfected into HEK293T cells with the packaging plasmids pVSVg (AddGene 8454) and psPAX2 (AddGene 12260) for generation of lentivirus particles. Cas9 immortalized macrophages were transduced with lentivirus particles and 48 hours later treated with puromycin. Single cell clones were subsequently picked and grown.
Human induced pluripotent stem cell lines (hiPSC), derived from three patients with Crohn’s Disease (CD) homozygous for the CD-associated minor allele of the rs28445040 variant in SP140 (SP140 mut ) and from three healthy controls (HC) homozygous for the major allele (SP140 wt ) were produced through reprogramming of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). HiPSC lines were then differentiated into CD14+ monocytes and validated via FACS analysis. Harvested monocytes were further cultured and differentiated into M0 macrophages by adding M-CSF for 7 days, and then polarized to M1 macrophages with IFNγ.
Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LBL) collected by the NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium from three patients with Crohn’s Disease (CD) homozygous for the CD-associated minor allele of the rs28445040 variant in SP140 (SP140 mut ) and from three healthy controls (HC) homozygous for the major allele (SP140 wt ) were obtained from the NIDDK Central Repository ( https://repository.niddk.nih.gov ).

LBL reprogramming was performed as described by Kumar et al. (27375745). Briefly, 1x10 6 cells were nucleofected with four episomal reprogramming plasmids (pCE-hUL, pCE-hSK, pCE-hOCT3/4, and pCE-mp53DD) using the Amaxa® Human Monocyte Nucleofector® Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After an 8-12 hours recovery period in complete media (RPMI1640-GlutaMAX™ (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% FBS (Sigma Aldrich) and 1% P/S (Wisent), the cells were transferred to Matrigel® (Corning) coated plates in TeSR™-E7™ (STEMCELL™ Technologies) reprogramming media. Cell were then cultivated for 13 to 15 days, and when hiPSC-like colonies started to appear, the growth media was changed to Stemflex (Gibco™). Colonies were tested for TRA-1-60 expression between days 20 and 22, and four TRA-1-60 colonies were picked and expanded for each cell lines. Each hiPSC cell line was then further sub-cloned by sorting of single cells into single wells of Matrigel®-coated 96-well plates containing Stemflex media supplemented with 1X Revitacell (Gibco™) using a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) cell sorter. Media was changed every 3-4 days and the amount of Revitacell was reduced to 1/2X after 6 days. Each well was investigated for the emergence of colonies derived from single cells and 2 sub-clones of each cell line were selected, characterized, and expanded for further studies after 11-12 days.
Each hiPSC sub-clonal line was then tested for the absence of genomic integration of the four plasmids used for LBL-hiPSC reprogramming via a PCR amplification of plasmid DNA using HotStarTaq Plus DNA Polymerase (Qiagen). The hiPSC lines were also tested for the expression of pluripotency markers NANOG, SOX2 and POU5F1 by RT-qPCR amplification. Finally, the capacity of each of these sub-clonal hiPSC lines to differentiate into the three germ layers was assessed using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Functional Identification Kit (R&D Systems) following manufacturer’s instructions.
The differentiation of hiPSC lines into monocytes was performed as described by Yanagimachi, M. D. et al. (23573196). Briefly, 30 colonies obtained using the ReLeSR™ solution (STEMCELL™ Technologies) were seeded in a 100mm Petri dish containing mTeSR1 STEMCELL™ Technologies) medium. At Day 0, BMP4 (Sigma Aldrich, 80 ng/mL) was added to the mTeSR1 medium. Between Days 4 and 5, medium was changed to Stempro®-34 SFM (1X) (Gibco™) supplemented with VEGF (Sigma Aldrich, 80 ng/mL), bFGF (Sigma Aldrich, 25 ng/ml), and SCF (Sigma Aldrich, 100 ng/mL) to promote the development of hemoangiogenic progenitors. On Days 6 and 7, the cytokine cocktail was changed to SCF (50 ng/mL), IL-3 (R&D systems, 50 ng/mL), TPO (Thrombopoietin) (Sigma Aldrich, 5 ng/mL), M-CSF (Sigma Aldrich, 50 ng/mL), and Flt-3 ligand (Sigma Aldrich, 50 ng/mL) for the generation of hematopoietic cells. Finally, the cytokine cocktail was changed to Flt-3 ligand (50 ng/mL), GM-CSF (Sigma Aldrich, 25 ng/mL), and M-CSF (50 ng/mL) between Days 13 and 15 to drive the monocytic lineage-directed differentiation. Following that, free floating monocytes were harvested from the supernatant and the medium was changed every 3-4 days. Monocytes were first visualized using H&E staining. Briefly, 50,000 monocytes were collected and laid on a polarized microscope slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to dry completely. Then, slides were fixed and stained following manufacturer’s instructions (Hema 3™ Manual Staining System and Stat Pack, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The production of CD14+ monocytes was confirmed through FACS analysis. Briefly, a minimum of 50,000 cells were harvested from the supernatant of monocyte differentiation cultures and washed in cold sorting buffer. Cells were blocked by incubating 20 μL of FcR Blocking Reagent (MACS Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 min at 4°C prior to antibody staining. The antibody used was the BV421 Anti-Human CD14 (Clone M5E2) (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with the antibody 30 min at 4°C and then washed twice with cold sorting buffer. Cells were filtered using 70μM Pre-Separation Filters (MACS Miltenyi Biotec). Control was made with the appropriated isotype control and viability was assessed by 7-AAD staining solution (BD Biosciences). CD14+ staining was measured on a FACS Aria Fusion and analyzed using FlowJo™ software.
The differentiation of harvested monocytes into M1 macrophages was performed as described by Yanagimachi, M. D. et al. (23573196). Briefly, 300,000 CD14+ monocytes were plated in a 24-well plate and cultured for 7 days in RPMI1640-GlutaMAX™ (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS and M-CSF (100ng/ml). Differentiated M0 macrophages were visualized using H&E staining. For this purpose, 100,000 CD14+ monocytes were plated in Cell Imaging Coverglass (Eppendorf). On Day 7, cells were fixed and stained with the Hema 3™ Manual Staining System and Stat Pack, following manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequent polarization of macrophages was achieved via the addition of IFNγ (20 ng/ml) to the media for 24h followed by 4h of LPS (Lippopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli O111:B4, Sigma Aldrich, 100ng/ml) treatment to activate the M1 macrophages. The differentiation of CD14+ monocytes into M1 macrophages was confirmed through FACS analysis. Briefly, a minimum of 100,000 M1 macrophages were harvested using Stempro Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at 37°C and washed in cold sorting buffer. Cells were blocked by incubating 20 μL of FcR Blocking Reagent (MACS Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 min at 4°C prior to antibody staining. The antibody used was the BUV737 Anti-Human HLA-DR (Clone G46-6) (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with the antibody 30 min at 4°C and then washed twice with cold sorting buffer. Cells were filtered using 70μM Pre-Separation Filters (MACS Miltenyi Biotec). Control was made with the appropriated isotype control and viability was assessed by 7-AAD staining solution (BD Biosciences). HLA-DR+ staining was measured on a FACS Aria Fusion and analyzed using FlowJo™ software.
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digest (Qiagen)according to manufacturer’s instruction. 100ng-1μg RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcription using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR reactions were run with cDNA template in the presence of 0.625μM forward and reverse primer and 1x solution of iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Quantification of transcript was normalized to the indicated housekeeping gene. A complete list of primer sequences is provided in STAR Methods chart.
HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-Empty Vector (FLAG-EV) and FLAG-SP140 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 hours. Lysates were incubated with FLAG M2 (Sigma, F3165) antibody and immunoprecipitated protein was run on a 4-12% Tris-Bis. Gel and stained with Silver Stain (Thermo Fisher) and gel sections were cut and sent for in-gel digestion, micro-capillary LC/MS/MS, analysis, protein database searching and data analysis at the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School). Mass Spec of lymphoblastoid cells (LBLs) carrying SP140 wildtype or SP140 loss-of-function variants (homozygous for rs7423615, Coriell Institute of Medical Research) was performed on endogenous SP140 immunoprecipitated from 1mg of nuclear lysates with SP140 antibody (Sigma).
Cells were washed in PBS and gently lysed by resuspension in a freshly prepared and chilled sucrose lysis buffer (320 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 3 mM CaCl 2 , 2mM magnesium acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1% protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). Cells were incubated in this buffer for 15 minutes on ice followed by centrifugation at 500 g for 15 minutes at 4 o C to pellet isolated nuclei. Supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was removed and the remaining nuclear pellet was mixed in a nuclei sonication buffer (500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1% protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) followed by incubation on ice for 5 minutes. Next, the nuclei were lysed in this buffer by sonication for 10 seconds. Insoluble debris from this lysate was removed by centrifugation at 21000 g for 20 minutes at 4 o C and remaining supernatant was taken as nuclear fraction protein.
For chromatin fractionation, 1x10 7 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 200μL of Buffer A (10mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50mM NaCl, 0.5M sucrose, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM dithiothreitol, 1% NP40 and protease inhibitor (Roche)). The cells were incubated on ice for 5 min and subsequently nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The cytoplasmic fraction was removed and the pellet was washed once with Buffer A then lysed in 200μL of Buffer B (10mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 150mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 1mM dithiothreitol, 1% NP40 and protease inhibitor mixture), followed by 10-min incubation on ice. Soluble nuclear proteins were separated from chromatin by centrifugation (5,000 r.p.m., 5min). The pellet was solubilized using sonication in Buffer C (10mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1mM EDTA, 1% NP40 and 1mM dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor with either 150mM NaCl, 300nM NaCl or 600nM NaCl) and the association of different proteins to chromatin was analyzed using Western blotting.
HEK293T cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes and transfected with 25μg FLAG-Empty Vector (FLAG-EV) and FLAG-SP140 plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 hours after transfection, nuclear extracts were isolated from cells. Alternatively, nuclear extracts from 10 million THP1 monocyte, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or LBL cells were used for endogenous SP140 IPs. 500μg of nuclear lysate was incubated with SP140 antibody (Sigma) for pulldown overnight at 4 o C. This was followed by addition of Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and incubation for 4 hours at 4 o C with rotation. The bead slurry was then magnetized, the unbound fraction removed, and the beads subjected to a series of increasingly harsh salt-based washes. The beads were boiled at 90°C for 10 minutes in a reducing sample buffer to elute bound protein and the elution was used for probing of co-IP interactors by Western blotting. Eluted proteins were run on a 3-8% Tris Acetate Gel (Invitrogen) or 4-12% Tris Bis gel (Invitrogen), transferred onto PVDF membrane, blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS/0.1% Tween at room temperature for 1h, and then incubated with the indicated primary antibody in 3% BSA TBS/0.1% Tween overnight at 4°C. To assess DNA dependence of co-IP interactors, ethidium bromide was added at a concentration of 1mg/mL to 500μg of nuclear lysate and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes on ice prior to addition of antibody for pulldown as described previously. Salt-based wash solutions were also supplemented with 100μg/mL ethidium bromide. As before, beads were boiled and eluted protein was used for probing of interactors by Western blot.
Potential sumoylation sites on SP140 protein were predicted and ranked through GPS-SUMO web interface tool http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/index.php which is based off published algorithms ( Ren et al., 2009 60. Ren, J. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Jin, C. ...

GPS-SUMO: a tool for the prediction of SUMOylation sites and SUMO-interaction motifs Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W325-W330 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ). Position 762 with a significant P-value was used for subsequent mutagenesis.
Full length human recombinant SP140 protein was commercially produced by BPS Bioscience using a HEK293T expression system. Recombinant Topoisomerase I and II were purchased from Topogen. Nuclear lysates were obtained from control or SP140 knockdown THP-1 cells or primary human peripheral blood-derived macrophages, HEK overexpressing FLAG SP140 or SP140 protein domain mutants, or lymphoblastoid cells (LBLs) carrying wildtype or SP140 genetic variants (homozygous for rs7423615) and Topoisomerase I activity was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Topoisomerase I activity assay kit, TopoGen). Briefly, nuclear lysates were incubated with supercoiled plasmid (pHOT) DNA substrate, and reaction buffer (10mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 1mM EDTA, 0.15M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.1mM Spermidine, 5% glycerol) for 30 minutes at 37°C. The reaction was stopped using a “Stop” Buffer (0.125% Bromophenol Blue, 25% glycerol, 5% Sarkosyl) and samples were treated with proteinase K (50μg/mL) and Ribonuclease A (Roche) for 30 minutes at 37°C to remove contaminating proteins and RNA. The reaction mixture, along with supercoiled and relaxed controls, were then run on a 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium Bromide for 20 minutes, de-stained in distilled water, and imaged for photodocumentation. Bands were quantified using Image Studio Lite (Licor Biosciences) and ratios were calculated with relaxed over supercoiled quantified data. Topoisomerase II activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Topoisomerase II activity assay kit, TopoGen). Briefly, recombinant SP140 protein was incubated with recombinant TOP2A protein, catenated plasmid kinetoplast DNA (from insect C fasciculate ) substrate, reaction buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl pH 8, 1.5M NaCl, 100mM MgCl2, 5mM Dithiothreitol, 300μg/mL BSA) for 30 minutes at 37°C. The reaction was stopped using a “Stop” Buffer (0.125% Bromophenol Blue, 25% glycerol, 5% Sarkosyl). The reaction mixture, along with catenated and decatenated circular and linear controls, were then run on a 1% Ethidium Bromide agarose gel, destained in distilled water, and imaged for photodocumentation. Bands were quantified using Image Studio Lite (Licor Biosciences) and ratios were calculated with decatenated relaxed and nicked DNA over catenated quantified data.
Macrophages were fixed as single cell suspensions in 4% formaldehyde. Fixed cells were then permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 and blocked in 1% BSA/0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. Cells were then incubated with 1:500 γH2AX antibody (Abcam), followed by washing and collection in FACS buffer (1% FBS in PBS) for flow cytometry. Annexin V and propidium iodide for cell death analysis was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions (Alexa Fluor® 488 annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit, Thermofisher). Cell cycle analysis was performed with ethanol fixed cells and stained in PBS with 50μg/mL Propidium Iodide and 100μg/mL RNase A. All flow cytometry data was collected on LSRII (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar).
Control or SP140 siRNA-mediated knockdown THP1 or CRISPR-mediated Sp140 null mouse immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 mins and subsequently permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA/PBST and stained with 1:500 γH2AX antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4°C. The samples were subsequently washed the next day and incubated with secondary antibody at 1:1000 (AlexaFluor 488, Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature, following which cells were washed and coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides with Prolong Diamond anti-fade mountant (Invitrogen). Multiple representative images were obtained on a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 800 Airyscan). Images were quantified using ImageJ ( Schneider et al., 2012 65. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43944) PubMed Google Scholar ) by measuring fluorescence intensity across the diameter of a nucleus of 25 cells. Quantified data were binned to normalize different sized cells and plotted as a lineplot with Python showing average intensity from one periphery of the cell to the other periphery.
Ten million naïve or LPS-stimulated (0.1mg/mL for 4 hours) human peripheral blood-derived macrophages were cross-linked and processed using truChIP kit (Covaris Inc), as described in detail before( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Input fraction was saved (10%), and the remaining sheared chromatin was used for ChIP with γH2AX antibody (Abcam) or an immunoglobulin G isotype control (Abcam) in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl in 1Å∼ Covaris D3 buffer) at 4°C, rotating overnight, followed by incubation with Dynabeads Protein G (Life Technologies) for 4 hours. The chromatin-bead-antibody complexes were then washed sequentially with three wash buffers of increasing salt concentrations and TE buffer. Chromatin was eluted using 1% SDS in Tris-EDTA. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation with ribonuclease A (Roche) for 1 hour at 37°C, followed by an overnight incubation at 65°C with Proteinase K (Roche). DNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). DNA was used for ChIP qPCR using primers in Key Resources Table . ChIP data across different donors was normalized to γH2AX ChIP of control sample of each donor.
RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (with on-column DNase I digest) and samples were eluted in 40μL RNase-free water. Sample concentration and quality was measured using the HighSensitivity RNA TapeStation kit for the TapeStation Bioanalyzer (Agilent). After confirming the RNA was of sufficient quality using the RIN e metric, 100ng of RNA was taken from each sample and made up to 50μL in RNase-free water. mRNA was enriched for and used to prepare libraries using the NEBnext Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module (NEB E7490S) and NEBnext Ultra II RNA library prep kit (NEB E7770S). Briefly, poly(A)-tailed RNA was isolated by coupling with Oligo d(T) magnetic beads followed by a series of washes to remove unbound RNA. This coupling was repeated for a total of two selection steps. Finally, beads were resuspended in a mix of random primers and First Strand Synthesis Buffer and boiled for 10 minutes to fragment selected mRNA. First Strand Enzyme mix was added to the fragmented RNA-buffer elution and thermal cycled for preparation of cDNA. The second strand was synthesized in a similar manner, using the respective buffers and enzymes. Double-stranded cDNA was selected for using SPRI size selection magnetic beads, end prepped, and ligated with unique adapters for multiplexing. This ligation mixture was PCR cycled to amplify cDNA and libraries were purified using a series of SPRI size selection steps. Finally, library size and purity were confirmed using the High Sensitivity D1000 Tapestation kit on Tapestation Bioanalyzer. Multiplexed samples were submitted for paired-end sequencing on NovaSeq S2 (Genomics Platform, Broad Institute), resulting in 14-52 million mapped reads per sample. Reads were mapped using the STAR aligner ( Dobin et al., 2013 18. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the hg19 assembly of the human genome. Read counts for individual transcripts were obtained using HTSeq ( Anders et al., 2015 4. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13500) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the Ensembl gene annotation (GRCh37 release 75) ( Yates et al., 2016 76. Yates, A. ∙ Akanni, W. ∙ Amode, M.R. ... Ensembl 2016 Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D710-D716 Crossref Scopus (1092) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential expression analysis was performed using the EdgeR package ( McCarthy et al., 2012 48. McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. Differential expression analysis of multifactor RNA-Seq experiments with respect to biological variation Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :4288-4297 Crossref Scopus (3388) PubMed Google Scholar ), and differentially expressed genes were defined based on the criteria of >2-fold change in normalized expression value. For probability density distribution analysis of differential genes, ChIP signal enrichments at promoters were calculated by counting reads in the region defined by ±3 kb from the TSS. Read counts were normalized to reads per million (RPM), and the enrichment was calculated as the ratio of RPM in ChIP divided by the RPM in input chromatin (control) and was converted to log 2 scale. The probability density distribution was computed and plotted with standard R package. SP140 ChIP-seq in primary human macrophages was previously generated in our lab ( Mehta et al., 2017 49. Mehta, S. ∙ Cronkite, D.A. ∙ Basavappa, M. ... Maintenance of macrophage transcriptional programs and intestinal homeostasis by epigenetic reader SP140 Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaag3160 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) and H3K27me3 analysis included ChIP-seq obtained in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (ENCODE accession: ENCSR553XBX, ENCSR866UQO, ENCSR390SFH. An average of these three studies was used).
To profile H3K27me3 levels in control primary human macrophages, we performed optimized version of Mint-ChIP3 ( van Galen et al., 2016 70. van Galen, P. ∙ Viny, A.D. ∙ Ram, O. ... A multiplexed system for quantitative comparisons of chromatin landscapes Mol. Cell. 2016; 61 :170-180 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), as described before. Briefly, 100,000 cells were lysed and digested with 300 units of micrococcal nuclease (MNase, NEB) for 15 mins. T7 Adapter Ligation was subsequently performed and quenched. All samples were pooled and then equally split for primary antibody (H3K27me3 and H3 Antibody) overnight incubation at 4C. Protein G Dynabeads were added the next morning and incubated for 4 hours at 4 o C. Following low salt RIPA, high salt RIPA, LiCl and TE washes, the beads were eluted and digested at 63 o C for 1 hour. The beads were cleaned up using AMPure SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter). In vitro transcription of eluted DNA to RNA was performed using NEB HiScribe T7 kit for 2 hours and subsequently treated with DNase at 37 o C for 15 mins. RNA was isolated using Silane beads (Thermofisher). RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and subsequently cleaned up with AMpure SPRI beds. The purified DNA was then used for Library PCR with Illumina barcoded primers to Enrich Adapter-Modified DNA Fragments. Samples were submitted for sequencing on HiSeq (Genomics Platform, Broad Institute). MINT ChIP reads were aligned to the hg19 genome using BWA version 0.7.15, technical replicates were pooled together. bigWig files were generated using the deepTools bamCoverage command, normalized using CPM, and with bin size of 50, and smooth length of 100. Normalized bigWig files were used to calculate intensities at promoters from the Ensembl gene annotation (GRCh37 release 75) using the deepTools multiBigwigSummary command, with a BED file obtained by extending the TSS by +/- 3000 bp.
CUT&Tag was performed according to Epicypher protocol. Briefly, nuclei were isolated from 100,000 primary human macrophages and bound to activated magnetic concanavalin A beads (Epicypher). The bound nuclei were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 o C. The next day, the beads were washed and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody for 0.5 hour at room temperature. This was followed by washing and incubation with the protein A/G conjugated Tn5 (CUTANA pAG-Tn5, Epicypher) enzyme for one hour at room temperature. The enzyme bound beads were then washed, and then tagmentation reaction was performed for 1 hour at 37 o C. The reaction was stopped with TAPS buffer containing EDTA, released with SDS buffer, and quenched with 0.67% Triton X-100 solution. The released DNA was cleaned up using Monarch DNA PCR Clean Kit (NEB) and eluted in TE buffer. Library was constructed using universal i5 and barcoded i7 primers and non-hot start CUTANA® High Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (Epicypher). DNA was cleaned and size selected using 1.3x AMPure beads and visualized on Agilent Bioanalyzer system. Samples were submitted for sequencing on the NovaSeq_SP_100 (Genomics Platform, Broad Institute). Paired-end sequencing reads were aligned to hg19 human reference genome using bwa version 0.7.17 ( Li and Durbin, 2009 44. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32751) PubMed Google Scholar ). diffBind R package ( Ross-Innes et al., 2012 62. Ross-Innes, C.S. ∙ Stark, R. ∙ Teschendorff, A.E. ... Differential oestrogen receptor binding is associated with clinical outcome in breast cancer Nature. 2012; 481 :389-393 Crossref Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for the analysis of differential regions between knockdown and control samples at promoter regions (+/- 3kb proximity of transcription start sites). Differential regions were determined based on the cutoffs of > 2-fold change of read density and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01. Heatmaps and metaplots of CUT&Tag signal densities were generated using deepTools ( Ramírez et al., 2014 59. Ramírez, F. ∙ Dündar, F. ∙ Diehl, S. ... deepTools: a flexible platform for exploring deep-sequencing data Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :W187-W191 Crossref Scopus (1828) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Primary human macrophages or bone marrow derived macrophages (1x 10 6 ) plated in 12-wellplates were infected with live adherent invasive E. coli, C. rodentium, and S. typhimurium at a 1:10 with spin infection for 10 mins and incubation for 20 mins. Cells were washed three times with 1x PBS and provided medium containing 100 μg/mL gentamicin for 1 hour. Cells were washed again with 1x PBS and lysed with 0.1% Triton x-100 in 1x PBS following 1, 2 or 3 hours for E. coli, C. rodentium and S. typhimurium , respectively. Serially diluted cell lysates were plated on LB agar plates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were determined after 24 hours of incubation at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
All mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions according to the National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), and all animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by the MGH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and in compliance with appropriate ethical regulations. For all experiments, age-matched mice Sp140 knockout or wildtype controls were randomized and allocated to experimental group, with 6-12 mice per group. No statistical method was used to determine sample size. Mice were administered 2.5% Dextran Sodium Sulfate Salt (DSS, MW = 36,000-50,000 Da; MP Biomedicals) in drinking water ad libitum for 7 days (freshly prepared every other day), followed by regular drinking water for 5 days. For macrophage transfer experiments, 7 day mature bone marrow derived macrophages were injected (1x10 6 , i.v.) one day before DSS administration and Day 4 post DSS. For topoisomerase inhibition experiments, mice were administered DMSO (control), topotecan (Sigma) or etoposide (Sigma) by intraperitoneal injection (i.p. 1mg/kg) starting on day 1 and administered every other day until mice were sacrificed on day 12. Colon length was measured and Day 9 fecal samples were homogenized in PBS, spun down and supernatants were collected and assayed for Lipocalin-2 by ELISA, according to manufacturer’s instructions (R&D). For cytokine measurements, day 12 colon tissue (excised approximately 1 cm) was washed in PBS and then placed in a 24 well plate containing 1mL of RPMI medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C and IL-6 and TNF levels were assessed by ELISA, according to manufacturer’s instructions (R&D).
Results are shown as mean ± s.e.m. Visual examination of the data distribution as well as normality testing demonstrated that all variables appeared to be normally distributed. Comparisons and statistical tests were performed as indicated in each figure legend. For comparisons of two groups, two-tailed unpaired t tests were used, except where indicated. For comparison of multiple groups, one-way ANOVA was used. Statistical analyses were performed in the GraphPad Prism 8 software. The P values denoted throughout the manuscript highlight biologically relevant comparisons. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant, denoted as ∗ P <0.05, ∗∗ P <0.01, ∗∗∗ P <0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ P <0.0001 for all analyses.
