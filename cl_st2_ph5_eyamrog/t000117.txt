Section: Abstract

The anterior insular cortex (aIC) plays a critical role in cognitive and motivational control of behavior, but the underlying neural mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that aIC neurons expressing Fezf2 (aIC Fezf2 ), which are the pyramidal tract neurons, signal motivational vigor and invigorate need-seeking behavior through projections to the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). aIC Fezf2 neurons and their postsynaptic NTS neurons acquire anticipatory activity through learning, which encodes the perceived value and the vigor of actions to pursue homeostatic needs. Correspondingly, aIC → NTS circuit activity controls vigor, effort, and striatal dopamine release but only if the action is learned and the outcome is needed. Notably, aIC Fezf2 neurons do not represent taste or valence. Moreover, aIC → NTS activity neither drives reinforcement nor influences total consumption. These results pinpoint specific functions of aIC → NTS circuit for selectively controlling motivational vigor and suggest that motivation is subserved, in part, by aIC’s top-down regulation of dopamine signaling.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

An extensive body of literature from human studies indicates that the insular cortex (IC), especially the anterior IC (aIC), plays a pivotal role in integrating interoceptive and exteroceptive information into cognitive and motivational control of behavior ( Craig, 2009 12.

The neurobiology of interoception in health and disease Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2018; 1428 :112-128 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, human neuroimaging studies show that the aIC is more activated during intrinsically motivating tasks than non-motivating ones ( Lee and Reeve, 2013 37. Lee, W. ∙ Reeve, J.

Cues associated with drugs of abuse activate the IC in addicted individuals, with the activity positively correlated with self-reported craving ( Bonson et al., 2002 5.

In parallel, it has been reported that individuals with insular lesions have reduced energy or drive ( Manes et al., 1999 47. Manes, F. ∙ Paradiso, S. ∙ Robinson, R.G.

Furthermore, aIC dysfunction is associated with mood disorders including depression ( Etkin, 2010 18. Etkin, A. Functional neuroanatomy of anxiety: a neural circuit perspective Curr. Top. Behav.

These studies strongly suggest a role of the aIC in motivation-related processes.
Studies in rodents have revealed detailed, yet divergent functions of the IC ( Gogolla, 2017 25. Gogolla, N. The insular cortex Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :R580-R586 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vincis and Fontanini, 2016 78. Vincis, R. ∙ Fontanini, A. A gustocentric perspective to understanding primary sensory cortices Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2016; 40 :118-124 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, IC neurons are involved in processing gustatory information ( Chen et al., 2011 6. Chen, X. ∙ Gabitto, M. ∙ Peng, Y. ...

Effects of cue-triggered expectation on cortical processing of taste Neuron. 2012; 74 :410-422 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). IC neurons are also involved in processing valence information, because activation of aIC neurons, for instance, produces positive valence and appetitive response ( Peng et al., 2015 56. Peng, Y. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Jin, H. ... Sweet and bitter taste in the brain of awake behaving animals Nature. 2015; 527 :512-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2018 79. Wang, L. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Peng, Y. ... The coding of valence and identity in the mammalian taste system Nature. 2018; 558 :127-131 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, activation of aIC neurons can also produce negative valence and aversive response ( Wu et al., 2020 80. Wu, Y. ∙ Chen, C. ∙ Chen, M. ... The anterior insular cortex unilaterally controls feeding in response to aversive visceral stimuli in mice Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :640 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, inhibition of IC neurons ( Contreras et al., 2007 11. Contreras, M. ∙ Ceric, F. ∙ Torrealba, F. Inactivation of the interoceptive insula disrupts drug craving and malaise induced by lithium Science. 2007; 318 :655-658 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ; Forget et al., 2010 21.

Psychiatry. 2010; 68 :265-271 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), or specific inhibition of aIC neurons ( Venniro et al., 2017 77. Venniro, M. ∙ Caprioli, D. ∙ Zhang, M. ...

Nonetheless, given that learning, valence, and motivation are dissociable processes ( Berke, 2018 3. Berke, J.D. What does dopamine mean? Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :787-793 Crossref Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ; Berridge et al., 2009 4. Berridge, K.C. ∙ Robinson, T.E. ∙ Aldridge, J.W.

Shuvaev, S.A. ∙ Tran, N.B. ∙ Stephenson-Jones, M. ... Neural Networks With Motivation Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2021; 14 :609316 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is unclear how the IC orchestrates such divergent functions and how the IC controls motivation.
It is possible that the functional divergence is a manifestation of cell type heterogeneity. Indeed, studies on the IC have thus far targeted largely unspecified populations, which are highly heterogeneous ( Dikecligil et al., 2020 14. Dikecligil, G.N. ∙ Graham, D.M. ∙ Park, I.M. ... Layer- and Cell Type-Specific Response Properties of Gustatory Cortex Neurons in Awake Mice J. Neurosci. 2020; 40 :9676-9691 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maffei et al., 2012 45. Maffei, A. ∙ Haley, M. ∙ Fontanini, A. Neural processing of gustatory information in insular circuits Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2012; 22 :709-716 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). For projection neurons alone, there are hundreds of transcriptomic types ( Tasic et al., 2018 75. Tasic, B. ∙ Yao, Z. ∙ Graybuck, L.T. ... Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas Nature. 2018; 563 :72-78 Crossref Scopus (920) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yao et al., 2021 82.

Zhang, X. ∙ Guan, W. ∙ Yang, T. ... Genetically identified amygdala-striatal circuits for valence-specific behaviors Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :1586-1600 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, even neurons projecting to the same target can have opposing functions ( Zhang et al., 2021 84. Zhang, X. ∙ Guan, W. ∙ Yang, T. ... Genetically identified amygdala-striatal circuits for valence-specific behaviors Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :1586-1600 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, neuronal type identity in combination with connectivity specificity may determine the functions of different insular populations.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that aIC neurons projecting to the brainstem nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) regulate motivational processes. The only cortical neurons that directly project to the brainstem are the large pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in layer 5B ( Chen et al., 2019 8. Chen, X. ∙ Sun, Y.C. ∙ Zhan, H. ...

Neurosci. 2015; 18 :170-181 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar ), which have distinct genetic identity, connectivity, and physiological properties compared with neighboring neurons ( Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013 28.

Therefore, we used a genetic strategy combined with viral tools to target aIC PT neurons, as well as neurons along the aIC → NTS circuit. This approach allowed us to pinpoint highly specific functions of this circuit in motivational control.

Section: Results

Because PT neurons are specified by the master transcription factor forebrain expressed zinc finger 2 (Fezf2) ( Harris and Shepherd, 2015 29. Harris, K.D. ∙ Shepherd, G.M. The neocortical circuit: themes and variations Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :170-181 Crossref Scopus (661) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lodato et al., 2014 43. Lodato, S. ∙ Molyneaux, B.J. ∙ Zuccaro, E. ... Gene co-regulation by Fezf2 selects neurotransmitter identity and connectivity of corticospinal neurons Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1046-1054 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used a Fezf2 - CreER knockin mouse driver—that expresses the inducible Cre recombinase (CreER) under the control of endogenous Fezf2 promoter—to target PT neurons in the aIC. We injected the aIC of Fezf2 - CreER mice with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing GFP in a Cre-dependent manner ( Figure S1 A), followed by tamoxifen induction. We observed dense axon fibers originating from the labeled aIC PT neurons—hereafter referred to as aIC Fezf2 neurons—in brainstem areas (including the NTS and parabrachial nucleus [PBN]) and the thalamus ( Figures S1 B–S1F). There were also moderate to sparse fibers in forebrain areas, including the striatum, parasubthalamic nucleus, amygdala, and posterior IC ( Figures S1 G–S1K).
To examine the afferents of aIC Fezf2 neurons, we specifically infected these neurons with a rabies virus system ( Figures S1 L and S1M), which revealed that aIC Fezf2 neurons receive prominent monosynaptic inputs from various sources, including the motor, somatosensory and prefrontal cortices, and insula itself ( Figures S1 N, S1O, and S1V); these neurons also receive strong inputs from the basolateral amygdala, thalamus, olfactory areas, hippocampal formation ( Figures S1 P–S1S and S1V), and midbrain and hindbrain areas, especially the dorsal raphe nucleus and PBN ( Figures S1 T–S1V).
Next, we characterized the in vivo response properties of aIC Fezf2 neurons. We infected these neurons with the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6 ( Chen et al., 2013 7. Chen, T.W. ∙ Wardill, T.J. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity Nature. 2013; 499 :295-300 Crossref Scopus (4320) PubMed Google Scholar ) and implanted a gradient-index (GRIN) lens into the aIC ( Figures 1 A and S2 A). This approach allowed imaging aIC Fezf2 neuron activities—represented as GCaMP6 signals—at cellular resolution through the GRIN lens in behaving mice ( Figure 1 B; Video S1 ).
We first examined how individual neurons responded to sweet and bitter tastes by providing the mice with sucrose and quinine solutions. Many neurons were excited, whereas others were inhibited during consumption of the two liquids ( Figures S2 B and S2C), with the excited and inhibited neurons intermingled with no obvious spatial clustering ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Notably, a large population was excited by both sucrose and quinine, whereas another population was inhibited by both tastants ( Figures S2 B, S2C, and S2F). Because the licking rate of mice exhibited apparent variability across trials ( Figure 1 C), a phenomenon known to reflect fluctuating motivation ( Berditchevskaia et al., 2016 2. Berditchevskaia, A. ∙ Cazé, R.D. ∙ Schultz, S.R. Performance in a GO/NOGO perceptual task reflects a balance between impulsive and instrumental components of behaviour Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :27389 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined if this variability was reflected in neural activity. Remarkably, the responses of a substantial fraction of neurons (∼40% of 369 neurons imaged in 5 mice) scaled up or down with the licking rates during consumption ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Indeed, the neuronal response amplitudes showed either positive or negative trial-by-trial correlations with licking rates, regardless of whether the sucrose or quinine solution was consumed ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S2 G). In contrast, during baseline period (when liquid was unavailable), the activity of only few (∼8.67%) of these neurons was correlated with mice’s spontaneous licking ( Figure S2 H). These results suggest that a major population of aIC Fezf2 neurons represent the strength or vigor of licking, rather than taste or the movement associated with licking.
If aIC Fezf2 neurons represent action vigor, then their response should be dependent upon the animal’s motivational state. To test this prediction, we trained these mice in a reward-seeking task, in which a sound (conditioned stimulus [CS]) predicted that a liquid reward (unconditioned stimulus [US]) would be delivered, but only if the mice licked the spout during a response window following the CS ( Figures 1 H, 1L, and 1P). We imaged the CS- and US-evoked responses of aIC Fezf2 neurons while the mice transitioned between low and high levels of motivational drive under three distinct conditions. First, mice were kept thirsty and trained to lick for the delivery of a sucrose solution ( Figure 1 H). Well-trained thirsty mice showed increased anticipatory licking upon CS presentation; however, after free drinking was provided, the CS could no longer evoke licking, indicating that the mice were quenched ( Figure 1 I). We imaged aIC Fezf2 neuron activity across thirsty and quenched states ( Figures S2 I and S2J). When the mice were thirsty, a substantial population of neurons responded to the CS, with one subset showing excitation and the other showing inhibition ( Figures 1 J, S2 I, and S2J). Interestingly, both the excitatory and inhibitory responses followed characteristic ramping trajectories, starting from CS onset and reaching a peak or trough, respectively, upon US delivery ( Figures 1 J and S2 J). However, such responses completely disappeared once the mice were quenched ( Figures 1 J, 1K, S2 I, and S2J).
Second, the mice were kept thirsty and learned that the CS predicted a small drop (3 μL) of sucrose in one block, but the same CS predicted a large drop (12 μL) of sucrose in another block of trials ( Figure 1 L, M). We imaged the activity of aIC Fezf2 neurons across the two blocks ( Figures S2 K–S2M), which presumably engaged with different levels of motivation. In both blocks, many neurons showed either excitatory or inhibitory response to the CS, but the response in the large-reward block was much larger than that in the small-reward block ( Figures 1 N, 1O, S2 K, and S2L). However, the CS-evoked licking was comparable in the two blocks, although the US-evoked licking in the large-reward block was more vigorous ( Figures 1 M and S2 M). These results suggest that aIC Fezf2 neuron response reflects alterations in motivation levels preceding the occurrence of apparent motor changes.
Third, the mice were subject to a sodium-deficiency condition ( Lee et al., 2019 39. Lee, S. ∙ Augustine, V. ∙ Zhao, Y. ... Chemosensory modulation of neural circuits for sodium appetite Nature. 2019; 568 :93-97 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tindell et al., 2009 76. Tindell, A.J. ∙ Smith, K.S. ∙ Berridge, K.C. ... Dynamic computation of incentive salience: “wanting” what was never “liked” J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :12220-12228 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) and learned that CS predicted the delivery of a high-sodium solution (500 mM NaCl) ( Figure 1 P), which is repellent to animals under normal conditions. The mice readily licked the spout following CS presentation ( Figure 1 Q), reflecting a homeostatic need for sodium. As expected, the mice stopped responding to the CS after recovery from the deficiency ( Figure 1 Q). Remarkably, under sodium-deficiency, many aIC Fezf2 neurons showed robust excitatory (27%) or inhibitory (29%) responses to sodium or the CS predicting sodium delivery, which were completely abolished after the mice had recovered from the deficiency ( Figures 1 R, 1S, S2 N, and S2O).
To determine if the same neurons are involved in processing changing homeostatic demands, we tracked individual neurons across thirsty ( Figure 1 H) and sodium-deficiency ( Figure 1 P) states. Among the traceable neurons, a large fraction of those excited by sucrose solution when mice were thirsty (10 out of 18) were also excited by high-sodium when the mice were under sodium-deficiency ( Figure S2 P).
These results show that aIC Fezf2 neuron response is potently modulated by action vigor, homeostatic demand, and the values of expected outcomes. In particular, these neurons represent the anticipation of outcomes that meet the changing needs of animals, even if the outcome—such as the high-sodium—is expected to be unpleasant. Thus, aIC Fezf2 neurons integrate the learned, predictive signals with the information about homeostatic needs to represent anticipation and motivational vigor.
To further investigate how aIC Fezf2 neurons acquire anticipatory signals and participate in establishing motivated actions, we sought to image the activity of these neurons during learning in a “go/no-go” task ( Figure 2 A). In the “go” trials of this task, a sound (CS SU ) indicated that sucrose would be delivered, but only if mice licked the spout during a decision window (“hit”). In the “no-go” trials, another sound (CS QU ) announced that quinine would be delivered, but mice could avoid it by withholding licking in the decision window (“correct rejection” [CR]) ( Figure 2 A).
We imaged the activity of aIC Fezf2 neurons at different stages of training ( Figures 2 B–2D and S2 Q). By examining the activity of all the neurons in hit and CR trials, we found that initially very few neurons responded to CS; however, training dramatically increased the neurons showing excitatory response to CS SU and had a trend to increase the neurons showing inhibitory response to CS SU ( Figures 2 E, 2F, S2 R, and S2S). Training also increased sucrose-responsive neurons, especially those showing inhibitory response ( Figures 2 E and 2F). Very few neurons responded to CS QU throughout training ( Figure 2 E).
Interestingly, training markedly increased the number of neurons responsive to both CS SU and sucrose (excitation, p = 2.03 × 10 −10 , inhibition, p = 2.62 × 10 −5 , χ 2 test) ( Figure 2 F). Consistent with this observation, population analysis revealed that training led to an increase in similarity between the response to CS SU and sucrose, quantified as a decrease in Mahalanobis distance between the ensemble representations of the two stimuli ( Figure 2 G). These results indicate that training fundamentally modifies the responsiveness of aIC Fezf2 neurons, such that the response to the reward cue becomes matched with that to the actual reward.
To further examine how the response of aIC Fezf2 neurons evolves during learning, we projected their population activity along the axes that optimally separated the anticipatory response in different trial types ( Figure S2 T). Robust predictive and ramping signals developed during training, such that the hit and CR trials became better separated at the late than early stage ( Figure S2 T). Consistently, training increased the difference between CS ensemble representations in hit and CR trials ( Figures S2 U and S2V). Furthermore, the CS population response can be used to decode go and no-go trials, with decoding accuracy dependent on learning ( Figures S2 W and S2X). These results suggest that learning induces robust anticipatory response in aIC Fezf2 population, which is specific for reward and can be used to instruct or invigorate reward-seeking behavior.
If aIC Fezf2 neurons act to invigorate behaviors, then their anticipatory activities are expected to occur earlier than, correlate with, and be required for motivated behaviors. To test these predictions, we first examined the relationship between neuronal and behavioral response in the reward-seeking task or the go/no-go task, during the time window when thirsty or sodium-depleted mice were anticipating sucrose or NaCl solution, respectively ( Figures 1 L, 1P, and 2 A). Indeed, timing analysis revealed that most CS-excited neurons responded earlier than licking onset ( Figures S3 A, S3B, S3E, S3F, S3I, and S3J). Furthermore, trial-by-trial analysis showed that the response amplitudes of major aIC Fezf2 populations correlated with licking rates ( Figures S3 C, S3D, S3G, S3H, S3K, and S3L). These results are consistent with the notion that aIC Fezf2 neurons may provide signals that motivate or invigorate reward-seeking actions.
Next, to determine the causal relationship between aIC Fezf2 neurons and motivational actions, we sought to specifically inhibit these neurons during anticipation with optogenetics ( Figures 2 H–2Q). For this purpose, we expressed a light-sensitive neuronal inhibitor GtACR2 ( Govorunova et al., 2015 26. Govorunova, E.G. ∙ Sineshchekov, O.A. ∙ Janz, R. ... NEUROSCIENCE. Natural light-gated anion channels: A family of microbial rhodopsins for advanced optogenetics Science. 2015; 349 :647-650 Crossref Scopus (464) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mahn et al., 2018 46. Mahn, M. ∙ Gibor, L. ∙ Patil, P. ... High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4125 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), or mCherry (as a control), selectively in aIC Fezf2 neurons and implanted optical fibers above the infected areas for light delivery ( Figures 2 H and 2I). These mice were subsequently trained in the go/no-go task ( Figure 2 A). At the late stage of training, we delivered blue light into the aIC during the time window between CS onset and US onset, in randomly selected trials ( Figures 2 J–2L).
Strikingly, the photostimulation in the GtACR2 mice caused a dramatic reduction in anticipatory licking in go trials, resulting in decreased hit rate ( Figures 2 J–2L). These mice were not affected by the laser in no-go trials, but this was because licking was rare in these trials to begin with. As expected, the mCherry mice were not affected by the laser in either go or no-go trials ( Figure 2 L). Interestingly, once the GtACR2 mice had started licking in a “continuous licking” task, the photostimulation had no effect on the on-going licking behavior ( Figures 2 M and 2N). Thus, inhibiting aIC Fezf2 neurons impairs the anticipatory licking needed for obtaining reward, but does not affect the motor program underlying licking behavior.
To determine if aIC Fezf2 neurons are required specifically for licking, or generally for reward-seeking actions, we designed a “run-for-reward” (RFR) task in which mice needed to run upon CS presentation to obtain water reward ( Stephenson-Jones et al., 2020 70. Stephenson-Jones, M. ∙ Bravo-Rivera, C. ∙ Ahrens, S. ... Opposing Contributions of GABAergic and Glutamatergic Ventral Pallidal Neurons to Motivational Behaviors Neuron. 2020; 105 :921-933.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 O). Once mice learned the task, we optogenetically inhibited aIC Fezf2 neurons during the window between CS onset and US onset in randomly selected trials ( Figure 2 O). This manipulation markedly reduced running velocity, leading to reduced performance in this task ( Figures 2 P and 2Q). Again, laser illumination in the aIC had no effect on the mCherry mice ( Figure 2 Q). Thus, aIC Fezf2 neurons are essential for promoting running to obtain reward.
We also examined whether inhibiting aIC Fezf2 neurons could influence valence processing, general body movements, or consumption. We found that, in a real-time place preference or aversion (RTPP/A) test, inhibition of aIC Fezf2 neurons did not cause preference or aversion; neither did it affect animals’ movement ( Figures S4 A–S4E). In addition, inhibiting aIC Fezf2 neurons did not affect ad libitum sucrose consumption ( Figures S4 F and S4G).
Together, these results indicate that aIC Fezf2 neuron activity is required for the volitional aspect of reward-seeking actions but is dispensable for motor functions or consumption.
aIC Fezf2 neurons send dense projections to the NTS ( Figures S1 A and S1B), consistent with previous observations that the IC sends long-range direct projections to the NTS ( Jin et al., 2021 32. Jin, H. ∙ Fishman, Z.H. ∙ Ye, M. ... Top-Down Control of Sweet and Bitter Taste in the Mammalian Brain Cell. 2021; 184 :257-271.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shipley, 1982 66. Shipley, M.T. Insular cortex projection to the nucleus of the solitary tract and brainstem visceromotor regions in the mouse Brain Res. Bull. 1982; 8 :139-148 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we tested if the functions of aIC Fezf2 neurons we observed are conveyed through aIC Fezf2 → NTS pathway. We first examined the composition of aIC projections to the NTS. More than 90% of NTS-projecting aIC neurons were Fezf2 -expressing ( Fezf2 + ) ( Figures 3 A–3D), demonstrating that aIC → NTS projections originate predominately from aIC Fezf2 neurons.
We then probed aIC Fezf2 → NTS function with optogenetics. To this end, we bilaterally infected aIC Fezf2 neurons with an AAV expressing the light-gated cation channel ChR2, or GFP, and implanted optical fibers in the NTS above the axons originating from the infected neurons ( Figures 3 E and 3F). These mice underwent training in the go/no-go task ( Figure 3 G). At the late stage of training, we delivered blue light pulses into the NTS during the window between CS onset and US onset in randomly selected trials ( Figures 3 E–3H).
Remarkably, the photostimulation in the ChR2 mice caused an increase in licking rate following CS presentation in not only go trials, but also no-go trials ( Figures 3 H and 3I). As a result, the CR rate was reduced; the hit rate was increased, although without reaching significance due to a ceiling effect (p = 0.09) ( Figure 3 J). Interestingly, before training in the task, the photostimulation did not induce any licking following either the go or the no-go tone, even though the mice were thirsty ( Figure 3 K). Moreover, after these mice were well trained but quenched, the photostimulation also failed to promote licking in the task ( Figure 3 L). The GFP mice were not affected by the laser ( Figure 3 J). These results suggest that aIC Fezf2 → NTS activity invigorates the learned, anticipatory licking response to obtain a homeostatic need; however, it does not override satiety signals or autonomously activate the motor program to generate licking.
To determine if aIC Fezf2 → NTS is only involved in licking, we trained mice to perform the RFR task described above ( Figure 2 O), and optogenetically activated their aIC Fezf2 → NTS during the anticipation window ( Figures 3 M–3P). This manipulation markedly increased the velocity of anticipatory running and led to improved performance ( Figures 3 M and 3N). However, the same manipulation did not promote running before these mice were trained in the task ( Figure 3 O); it also failed to promote anticipatory running after the same mice were fully trained but quenched ( Figure 3 P). Laser illumination in the NTS had no effect on the GFP mice ( Figure 3 N). Thus, the results in the RFR and go/no-go tasks together demonstrate that aIC Fezf2 → NTS activity is capable of promoting different forms of volitional actions, on the condition that such actions have been learned and the outcome is homeostatically needed. In other words, aIC Fezf2 → NTS activity invigorates “need seeking,” but does not override homeostasis or automatically lead to action generation.
Next, we tested mice in a progressive-ratio (PR) task ( Figures 3 Q–3U). In this task, the effort required for thirsty mice to attain water increased progressively, and the breakpoint at which the mice stopped responding was used as a measure of motivation ( Figure 3 Q). In some sessions, we optogenetically activated aIC Fezf2 → NTS. This manipulation significantly increased the breakpoint and the total number of reward-seeking actions ( Figures 3 R–3U). Thus, aIC Fezf2 → NTS activation promotes the effort an animal spends in pursuing reward.
Notably, we found that optogenetically activating this pathway did not induce appetitive (or aversive) responses, neither did it affect animals’ locomotion in the RTPP/A test ( Figures S4 H–S4L). Activating this pathway also failed to support self-stimulation ( Figures S4 M–S4O). To test whether aIC Fezf2 → NTS activation promotes consumption, we activated the aIC Fezf2 → NTS pathway in hungry or thirsty mice in the presence of food or water, respectively. The activation did not increase food or water intake ( Figures S4 P and S4Q). In a separate test, activating this pathway also did not affect ad libitum sucrose consumption ( Figures S4 F and S4R). These results show that aIC Fezf2 → NTS activity does not produce valence, affect movement, or influence food and liquid consumption.
Together, these results strongly suggest that aIC Fezf2 → NTS carries out the invigoration function of aIC Fezf2 neurons and promotes the effort of motivational actions.
Next, we systematically examined the effects of aIC Fezf2 → NTS activation in well-trained mice performing the reward-seeking task ( Figures 4 A–4G). We found that in a quenched state, activating aIC Fezf2 → NTS did not induce anticipatory licking that would lead to water delivery ( Figures 4 A–4C, 4F, and 4G, leftmost). In contrast, in a thirsty state, activating this pathway dramatically increased the rate of anticipatory licking for either water or a sucrose solution, and even for a NaCl solution (300 mM), albeit to a lower level ( Figures 4 D and 4F). As a result, the performance in these sessions was improved ( Figure 4 G). The activation also potently promoted anticipatory licking for Ensure (a liquid food) when the mice were hungry ( Figures 4 E–4G, rightmost). However, the activation failed to increase anticipatory licking in sessions in which quinine was the US, or when no US was delivered (i.e., in extinction), even if the mice were thirsty ( Figures 4 D, 4F, and 4G). These results thus confirm that aIC Fezf2 → NTS function depends on homeostatic needs and further suggest that it depends on the perceived values of outcomes under on-going homeostatic demands.
To monitor the endogenous function of aIC Fezf2 → NTS pathway, we selectively imaged the activity of the NTS-projecting subpopulation of aIC Fezf2 neurons. Because essentially all NTS-projecting neurons in the aIC (aIC NTS ) are Fezf2 + ( Figures 3 A–3D), we labeled aIC NTS neurons with GCaMP6 for the imaging, by injecting the NTS of wild-type mice with a retrograde AAV expressing Cre, and injecting the aIC of the same animals with the AAV expressing GCaMP6 Cre-dependently ( Figure 5 A). We imaged the activity of aIC NTS neurons as we did for aIC Fezf2 neurons ( Figures 5 A and 5B).
Like aIC Fezf2 neurons, aIC NTS neurons showed excitatory or inhibitory response to sucrose and quinine that scaled up or down with the licking rates of the mice ( Figures S5 A–S5C). Moreover, the response amplitudes of many neurons showed positive or negative correlations with the licking rates during liquid consumption ( Figures S5 D and S5E) but not during baseline periods ( Figure S5 F). Interestingly, compared with aIC Fezf2 neurons, a much larger fraction of aIC NTS neurons showed excitatory response to sucrose (aIC NTS , 34.5%; aIC Fezf2 , 19.5%) or to both sucrose and quinine (aIC NTS , 14%; aIC Fezf2 , 8.4%) ( Figures S5 G and S5H).
In the reward-seeking task in which the size of reward was variable, the anticipatory response—either excitatory or inhibitory—of many aIC NTS neurons in big-reward trials was larger than that in small-reward trials ( Figures 5 C–5G). Furthermore, the anticipatory neuronal response preceded and correlated with mice’s licking action ( Figures 5 H–5K). Notably, compared with aIC Fezf2 neurons imaged in the same task ( Figure S3 D), a much greater fraction of aIC NTS neurons showed such correlative responses (aIC NTS , 79.2%; aIC Fezf2 , 36%) ( Figure 5 L). In addition, although the anticipatory response of either aIC Fezf2 or aIC NTS could be used to classify between small- and big-reward trials, aIC NTS was better in decoding performance ( Figure 5 M). These results together indicate that the aIC NTS subpopulation is more enriched with the anticipation or vigor signals than the larger aIC Fezf2 population and thus may convey these signals to the NTS.
To determine whether the anticipation signals in aIC Fezf2 or aIC NTS neurons are conveyed to the NTS, we monitored the activity of the NTS neurons receiving direct synaptic inputs from the aIC—termed NTS Recipient neurons. To target NTS Recipient neurons, we bilaterally injected the aIC of wild-type mice with an anterograde transsynaptic AAV1-Cre ( Zingg et al., 2017 86. Zingg, B. ∙ Chou, X.L. ∙ Zhang, Z.G. ... AAV-Mediated Anterograde Transsynaptic Tagging: Mapping Corticocollicular Input-Defined Neural Pathways for Defense Behaviors Neuron. 2017; 93 :33-47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ) and injected the NTS of the same animals with the Cre-dependent GCaMP6 AAV ( Figures S5 I and S5J). Optical fibers were subsequently implanted into the NTS, above the infected NTS Recipient neurons ( Figures S5 I and S5J).
We recorded the bulk activities of NTS Recipient neurons in these mice with fiber photometry, at different stages of training in the go/no-go task ( Figures S5 K–S5M). At the early stage of training, NTS Recipient neurons showed little response following CS presentations in either the go or no-go trials ( Figures S5 N, S5O, and S5R). However, at the late stage, these neurons displayed ramping-up activities following CS presentations until sucrose was delivered in the go trials ( Figures S5 P–S5S). In contrast, such anticipatory response was absent in the no-go trials. Thus, the anticipation response of NTS Recipient neurons, which bears characteristics of that of aIC Fezf2 neurons, emerges during learning, paralleling the establishment of need-seeking behavior.
To determine if the anticipatory activity of NTS Recipient neurons is required for need-seeking behavior, we specifically inhibited these neurons during anticipation in mice performing the go/no-go task ( Figures 6 A–6E). Strikingly, this manipulation caused a dramatic decrease in the anticipatory licking in go trials, resulting in impaired performance ( Figures 6 C–6E). In contrast, the inhibition had no effect on the on-going licking behavior in the continuous licking task ( Figures 6 F and 6G).
Furthermore, in the RFR task, inhibition of NTS Recipient neurons during anticipation markedly reduced the anticipatory running and performance ( Figures 6 H and 6I). However, inhibiting these neurons did not induce aversion or preference or any change in movement in the RTPP/A test ( Figures S4 S–S4W); it also did not affect ad libitum sucrose consumption ( Figures S4 F and S4X). Together, these results demonstrate that NTS Recipient activity is essential for the anticipatory control of different forms of goal-directed actions but dispensable for motor function or consumption.
To map the downstream targets that may mediate the function of NTS Recipient neurons, we labeled these neurons with GFP ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Notably, we found dense GFP-labeled axon fibers in dopamine areas including the retrorubral field (RRF)—that is populated by the A8 dopaminergic neuron group ( Figure S6 C) ( Fu et al., 2012 22. Fu, Y. ∙ Yuan, Y. ∙ Halliday, G. ... A cytoarchitectonic and chemoarchitectonic analysis of the dopamine cell groups in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and retrorubral field in the mouse Brain Struct. Funct. 2012; 217 :591-612 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar )—and the visual tegmental relay zone (VTRZ), a brain region located next to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) ( Figure S6 D). In both areas, the axon fibers were in close proximity to dopamine neurons ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Axon fibers were also observed in the thalamus ( Figure S6 E) and PBN ( Figure S6 F). Thus, NTS Recipient neurons can potentially influence dopamine neuron function through their direct projections to the RRF or VTRZ or through an indirect pathway via the PBN ( Figure S6 G).
Dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is involved in the modulation of action vigor ( Floresco, 2015 20. Floresco, S.B.

Dissociable dopamine dynamics for learning and motivation Nature. 2019; 570 :65-70 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we examined whether aIC Fezf2 → NTS can regulate NAc dopamine release. We bilaterally expressed ChR2 in aIC Fezf2 neurons and also expressed a genetically encoded dopamine sensor DA2m ( Sun et al., 2018 72. Sun, F. ∙ Zeng, J. ∙ Jing, M. ...

Sun, F. ∙ Zhou, J. ∙ Dai, B. ... Next-generation GRAB sensors for monitoring dopaminergic activity in vivo Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :1156-1166 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ) in NAc neurons of the same mice. Optical fibers were subsequently implanted in the NTS and NAc for photostimulation and fiber photometry, respectively ( Figures 7 A and 7B).
We trained these mice to perform the go/no-go task while recording dopamine release in the NAc with photometry. In randomly selected trials, we moderately photostimulated aIC Fezf2 → NTS during the anticipation period ( Figures 7 C and 7D). In the absence of the stimulation (“no laser”), dopamine release increased and decreased following CS in go and no-go trials, respectively ( Figures 7 E–7I). Interestingly, the stimulation (“laser”) further enhanced the increase in dopamine release in go trials, and prevented the decrease in dopamine release in no-go trials ( Figures 7 E, 7G, and 7I).
The observed enhancement of dopamine release was unlikely secondary to an increase in licking, because activating aIC Fezf2 → NTS did not affect licking in no-go trials, but still enhanced dopamine release ( Figure 7 H and 7I). Furthermore, we selected “no-laser” and “laser” go trials with similar anticipatory licking rates ( Figure 7 J; STAR Methods ). Analysis on such licking rate-matched go trials still showed that aIC Fezf2 → NTS activation was accompanied by an increase in dopamine release ( Figures 7 K and 7L). In the GFP control mice, shining light in the NTS had no effect ( Figures 7 M and 7N).
Finally, we repeated the activation when the mice were quenched, which failed to affect dopamine release in either go or no-go trials ( Figures 7 O–7Q). These results together indicate that aIC Fezf2 → NTS promotes dopamine release in the NAc but only when the outcome is homeostatically needed.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

The aIC Fezf2 → NTS circuit exhibited several distinctive features. First, aIC Fezf2 → NTS function strictly depended upon homeostatic needs. This circuit does not mediate the conventional reward-seeking function, which typically drives positive reinforcement and overconsumption ( Berridge et al., 2009 4. Berridge, K.C. ∙ Robinson, T.E. ∙ Aldridge, J.W. Dissecting components of reward: ‘liking’, ‘wanting’, and learning Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9 :65-73 Crossref Scopus (1284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rather, it carries out a “need-seeking” function that is engaged only when a goal is homeostatically needed. Second, the response of a large fraction of aIC Fezf2 or aIC NTS neurons did not represent sweet or bitter taste. Third, aIC Fezf2 → NTS only invigorated learned actions, but did not influence movement per se. Fourth, a stable set of aIC Fezf2 neurons participated in processing changing homeostatic needs. Our results altogether suggest that the aIC Fezf2 → NTS circuit constitutes a common neural substrate that integrates learned, predictive signals with the information about fluctuating homeostatic needs to encode and regulate the motivational vigor of need-seeking behaviors.
Our results that inhibition or activation of neurons along the aIC Fezf2 → NTS pathway potently suppresses or heightens, respectively, motivational vigor without influencing food or fluid consumption or affecting valence processing indicate that the function of this circuit is remarkably specialized. These results provide plausible explanations for the observations that patients with insular lesions have reduced motivational vigor or decreased addictive behaviors but have normal food intake and the pleasure of eating ( Manes et al., 1999 47.

Damage to the insula disrupts addiction to cigarette smoking Science. 2007; 315 :531-534 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that vigor is a core manifestation of motivation ( Niv et al., 2007 53. Niv, Y. ∙ Daw, N.D. ∙ Joel, D. ...

Insular and hippocampal gray matter volume reductions in patients with major depressive disorder PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e102692 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that regulating activity in the nodes along aIC → NTS circuit could be a viable approach to achieve bidirectional and precise control of vigor and effort, and hence this circuit represents a potential therapeutic target for treating vigor- or effort-related symptoms prevalent among individuals affected by depression or drug addiction.
Our in vivo imaging results revealed the existence of two distinct functional types among aIC Fezf2 or aIC NTS neurons, with one exhibiting excitatory response and the other showing inhibitory response during the anticipation and consumption of homeostatically needed substances. However, our optogenetic manipulation did not discriminate between these two types and especially did not unravel the role of the neurons with inhibitory response. The recently developed technologies for simultaneous optogenetics and imaging at single-cell resolution ( Emiliani et al., 2015 16. Emiliani, V. ∙ Cohen, A.E. ∙ Deisseroth, K. ... All-Optical Interrogation of Neural Circuits J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :13917-13926 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ) may prove to be useful in addressing this issue.

Male and female mice (2-4 months old) were used for all the experiments. All mice were bred onto a C57BL/6J background. Mice were housed in groups of 2-5 under a 12 h light/dark cycle (8 a.m. to 8 p.m. light), with food and water available ad libitum before being used for experiments. All behavioral experiments were conducted during the light cycle. Littermates were randomly assigned to different groups prior to experiments. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and performed in accordance to the US National Institutes of Health guidelines in an AAALACi accredited facility.

Brains were extracted and further fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by cryoprotection in a 30% PBS-buffered sucrose solution for 36-48 h at 4°C. Coronal sections (50 μm) were cut using a freezing microtome (Leica SM 2010R, Leica). Sections were first washed in PBS (5 min), incubated in PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and then washed with PBS (3 × 5 min). Next, sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBST for 30 min at RT and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed with PBS (3 × 5 min) and incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies at RT for 2 h. In some experiments (as indicated in Figures and Supplementary Figures), sections were washed twice in PBS, incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Invitrogen, catalog number D1306) (0.5μg/ml in PBS) for 2 min. After washing with PBS (3 × 5 min), sections were mounted onto slides with Fluoromount-G (eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA). Images were taken using an LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The primary antibodies used were: chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs, catalog number GFP1020; dilution 1:1000), rabbit anti-RFP (Rockland, catalog number 600-401-379; dilution 1:1000), rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Millipore, catalog number AB152; dilution 1:1000). Appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used depending on the desired fluorescence colors.
The following adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) were produced by the University of North Carolina vector core facility (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA): AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP, AAV9-CAG-Flex-GFP. The AAV1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6f-WPRE-SV40, AAV1-hSyn-SIO-stGtACR2-FusionRed and AAV-Ef1a-mCherry-IRES-Cre (retrograde) ( Fenno et al., 2014 19. Fenno, L.E. ∙ Mattis, J. ∙ Ramakrishnan, C. ... Targeting cells with single vectors using multiple-feature Boolean logic Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :763-772 Crossref Scopus (366) PubMed Google Scholar ) were produced by Addgene (Watertown, MA, USA). The AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGh (anterograde trans -synaptic) was packaged by UPenn Vector Core (Philadelphia, PA, USA). The AAV9-hSyn-DA2m was packaged by Vigene Biosciences (Rockville, MD, USA). The following viruses, which are components of the rabies viral tracing system, were produced by HHMI Janelia Research Campus: AAV2/9-CAG-Flex-mKate-T2A-TVA, AAV2/9-CAG-Flex-mKate-T2A-N2c-G, Rbv-CVS-N2c-ΔG-GFP (the modified rabies virus). All viral vectors were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use.
All surgery was performed under aseptic conditions and body temperature was maintained with a heating pad. Standard surgical procedures were used for stereotaxic injection and implantation as previously described ( Xiao et al., 2020 81. Xiao, X. ∙ Deng, H. ∙ Furlan, A. ... A Genetically Defined Compartmentalized Striatal Direct Pathway for Negative Reinforcement Cell. 2020; 183 :211-227.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (1%–2% in a mixture with oxygen, applied at 1.0 L/min), and head-fixed in a stereotaxic injection frame, which was linked to a digital mouse brain atlas to guide the targeting of different brain structures (Angle Two Stereotaxic System, myNeuroLab.com ). Lidocaine was injected subcutaneously into the head and neck area as a local anesthetic.
We first made a small cranial window (1-2 mm 2 ) above the target brain region. To prepare mice for the GRIN lens imaging experiments, we lowered a glass micropipette (tip diameter, ∼5 μm) containing the AAV1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6f-WPRE-SV40 viral solution to reach the aIC at two dorsoventral positions (coordinates: 1.6 mm anterior to Bregma, 3.1 mm lateral from midline, 1.9 mm and 2.1 mm vertical from brain surface). About 0.25 μL of viral solution was delivered at each injection site (in total 0.5 μl) with pressure applications (5-20 psi, 5-20 ms at 1 Hz) controlled by a Picospritzer III (General Valve) and a pulse generator (Agilent). The rate of injection was ∼20 nl/min. The pipette was left in place for 10 min following the injection, and then slowly withdrawn. In the experiment to image NTS-projecting aIC (aIC NTS ) neurons, we additionally injected the AAV-Ef1a-mCherry-IRES-Cre (retrograde) into the NTS (coordinates: 6.55 mm posterior to Bregma, 1.37 mm lateral from midline, and 3.8 mm vertical from brain surface). One week later, we performed the second surgery to implant a GRIN lens (diameter, 0.6 mm; length, 7.3 mm; Inscopix). The lens was slowly (∼100 μm/min) lowered to the aIC (coordinates: 1.6 mm anterior to Bregma, 3.1 mm lateral from midline, 1.7 mm vertical from brain surface), and subsequently secured to the skull by using C&B-Metabond (Parkell, catalog number S380). A metal head-bar (for head restraint) was then mounted onto the skull with black dental cement (Ortho-Jet). We waited for ∼4 weeks before starting the imaging experiments in these mice.
To prepare mice for the optogenetic experiments, we first injected the targets in both hemispheres with viruses, and subsequently implanted optic fibers above the injection locations or axon terminal fields. A head-bar was also mounted for head restraint. Viruses were injected at a volume of ∼0.3 μl at each site, and were allowed ∼4 weeks for expression. Viral injection was performed at the following stereotaxic coordinates for the aIC: 1.6 mm anterior to Bregma, 3.1 mm lateral from midline, 2.0 mm ventral from cortical surface; NTS: 6.55 mm posterior to Bregma, 1.37 mm lateral from midline, 3.8 mm ventral from cortical surface. Coordinates for optic fiber implantation were as follows: aIC: 1.6 mm anterior to Bregma, 3.1 mm lateral from midline, 1.65 mm ventral from cortical surface; NTS: 6.55 mm posterior to Bregma, 1.5 mm lateral from midline, 3.6 mm ventral from cortical surface with a 3° angle; and PBN: 5.3 mm posterior to Bregma, 1.9 mm lateral from midline, 2.2 mm ventral from cortical surface with a 14.85° angle. The optic fibers (core diameter, 200 μm; length, 3 mm (for aIC and PBN) or 4.5 mm (for NTS); NA, 0.22; Newdoon, Hangzhou, China; or Inper, Hangzhou, China) used for the photostimulation transmitted light with > 90% efficiency when tested before implantation.
To monitor the neural activity of NTS neurons receiving inputs from aIC (the NTS Recipient ) using fiber photometry, we injected the aIC with ∼0.3 μl of the anterograde trans -synaptic AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGh, and injected the NTS with ∼0.3 μl of AAV1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6f-WPRE-SV40 at the coordinates described above. An optic fiber (core diameter, 200 μm; length, 4.5 mm; NA, 0.37; Newdoon, Hangzhou, China; or Inper, Hangzhou, China) was inserted 0.2 mm above the injection site in the NTS.
For the in vivo opto-photometry experiment, Fezf2-CreER mice were injected with ∼0.3 μl AAV5-Ef1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP into the aIC and ∼0.3 μl AAV9-hSyn-DA2m into the NAc core (coordinates: 1.3 mm anterior to Bregma, 0.8 mm lateral from midline, 3.8 mm ventral from cortical surface). Optical fibers for photoactivation were implanted in the NTS at coordinates described above. Optical fibers for fiber photometry were implanted 0.2 mm above the injection site in the NAc.
To retrogradely label PBN- and NTS-projecting neurons in the IC of the same mice, we unilaterally injected ∼0.2 μl CTB-555 solution (0.1% in PBS) into the PBN (coordinates: 5.3 mm posterior to Bregma, 1.9 mm lateral from midline, 2.63 mm ventral from cortical surface with a 14.85° angle) and ∼0.2 μl CTB-647 solution (0.1% in PBS) into the NTS in C57BL/6J mice. Mice were sacrificed 5 days after the injection to allow retrograde labeling of projection neurons.
For anterograde tracing of aIC Fezf2 neurons, we unilaterally injected ∼0.2 μl of AAV9-CAG-Flex-GFP into the aIC in Fezf2-CreER mice. For anterograde tracing of NTS Recipient neurons, ∼0.3 μl of AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGh was injected into the aIC, and ∼0.3 μl of AAV9-CAG-Flex-GFP was injected into the NTS. We waited about 3-4 weeks before perfusing the mice.
Retrograde tracing of monosynaptic inputs onto aIC Fezf2 neurons was accomplished using a previously described method ( Reardon et al., 2016 59. Reardon, T.R. ∙ Murray, A.J. ∙ Turi, G.F. ...

Zhang, X. ∙ Guan, W. ∙ Yang, T. ... Genetically identified amygdala-striatal circuits for valence-specific behaviors Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :1586-1600 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first injected the aIC of Fezf2-CreER mice with a mixture of AAV-Flex-mKate-T2A-TVA and AAV-Flex-mKate-T2A-N2c-G (1:2 volume: volume ratio; ∼0.3 μl in total) that express the following components in a Cre-dependent manner: a fluorescent reporter mKate, TVA (which is a receptor for the avian virus envelope protein EnvA), and the rabies envelope glycoprotein (G). Three weeks later, mice were injected in the same location with Rbv-CVS-N2c-ΔG-GFP (∼0.3 μl), a rabies virus that is pseudotyped with EnvA, lacks the envelope glycoprotein, and expresses GFP. This rabies strain has been shown to have enhanced retrograde trans -synaptic transfer and reduced neurotoxicity ( Reardon et al., 2016 59. Reardon, T.R. ∙ Murray, A.J. ∙ Turi, G.F. ... Rabies Virus CVS-N2c(ΔG) Strain Enhances Retrograde Synaptic Transfer and Neuronal Viability Neuron. 2016; 89 :711-724 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Brain tissue was prepared one week after the rabies virus injection for histological examination. This method ensures that the rabies virus exclusively infects cells expressing TVA. Furthermore, complementation of the modified rabies virus with the envelope glycoprotein in the TVA-expressing cells allows the generation of infectious particles, which then can trans -synaptically infect presynaptic neurons.
All Fezf2-CreER mice underwent tamoxifen induction to activate the Cre-dependent expression of genes of interest. Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number T5648) was dissolved in corn oil at a concentration of 20 mg/ml, by constant shaking for 24 hours at room temperature in a container protected from light. Aliquots (1 mL each) were stored at 4°C. Tamoxifen induction was performed via intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.1 mg/g of body weight, once every 2 days for a total of 3 times. For virally driven gene expression, the first induction was performed one day after surgery. All mice were closely monitored throughout the course of tamoxifen injections and the post-injection period.
Thirsty mice were trained to perform a reward-seeking task, in which a sound (CS, 1 s in duration) predicted that a 200-mM sucrose solution (US) would be available for the mice to consume from a spout, but only if the mice licked the spout during a response window (2 s in duration) following CS presentation. Such trials were counted as “hit” trials. To assess how changes in thirst state influence behavioral and neural activity, we first conducted one session of the imaging experiment on mice performing the task in a thirsty state. Each mouse acquired 8 μl of the sucrose solution in every hit trial. At the end of the first session, we provided each of the mice with 2 mL of the sucrose solution. We then conducted a second session of imaging on these mice (which were all quenched).
To assess how reward size affects behavioral and neural activity, we performed the imaging experiment on thirsty mice performing the task in two blocks of trials in each session. In one block, a big reward (12 μl of sucrose solution) was delivered in each hit trial; in the other block, a small reward (3 μl of sucrose solution) was delivered in each hit trial. The same CS was used in both blocks. The sequence of the blocks was counterbalanced in different sessions.
To assess how sodium deficiency affects behavioral and neural activity, we induced a sodium-depletion state in the mice, and used a high concentration (500 mM) of NaCl solution instead of the sucrose solution as the US in the reward-seeking task. To induce the sodium-depletion state, furosemide (Sigma, catalog number F4381) was administered to mice via intraperitoneal injection (50 mg /kg of body weight), as previously described ( Lee et al., 2019 39. Lee, S. ∙ Augustine, V. ∙ Zhao, Y. ... Chemosensory modulation of neural circuits for sodium appetite Nature. 2019; 568 :93-97 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tindell et al., 2009 76. Tindell, A.J. ∙ Smith, K.S. ∙ Berridge, K.C. ... Dynamic computation of incentive salience: “wanting” what was never “liked” J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :12220-12228 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mice were subsequently placed on a sodium-deficient diet (Bio-serv, catalog number F7730) and had free access to distilled water. These mice were trained to lick for the NaCl solution in the reward-seeking task. We conducted one session of imaging on these mice performing the task. Each mouse acquired 5 μl of the NaCl solution in every hit trial. After this experiment, the mice were allowed to recover for at least 4 days on a normal diet. We conducted a second session of imaging on these mice after the recovery.
Water restricted mice were trained in an auditory go/no-go task under head restraint, as previously described ( Xiao et al., 2020 81. Xiao, X. ∙ Deng, H. ∙ Furlan, A. ... A Genetically Defined Compartmentalized Striatal Direct Pathway for Negative Reinforcement Cell. 2020; 183 :211-227.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Training started with habituation, during which mice received water reward by licking the water spout (2 μl for each lick). No auditory stimulus was presented. Once mice reliably licked the spout (for 2-3 days), they were subjected to the go/no-go training that included “go trials” and “no-go trials.” In go trials, an auditory stimulus (the “go tone,” 1 s in duration) was delivered, followed by a delay period (the “response window,” 1 s duration in optogenetics experiments and 2 s duration in imaging experiments). Licking during the response window was rewarded with a drop (5 μl) of a 200-mM sucrose solution. In no-go trials, a different auditory stimulus (the “no-go tone,” 1 s) was delivered, followed by a response window (same duration as that in go trials). Licking during the response window resulted in the delivery of a drop (5 μl) of a 5-mM quinine solution. The go trials and no-go trials were randomly interleaved. During the inter-trial interval, brief suction (500 ms in duration) near the spout was applied to remove any residual solution from the previous trial. For analysis, trials were sorted into go trials and no-go trials. In the optogenetics experiments, trials were further sorted into laser-on and laser-off trials. Laser illumination was delivered during the time window from tone onset to US onset in 20% of randomly selected trials. The laser illumination was 10 mW measured at the tip of optic fibers. For optogenetic activation, the laser pulses were 20 Hz with a 10-ms pulse width. For optogenetic inhibition, continuous illumination was applied. A correct response during a go trial (“hit”) occurred when the mouse successfully licked the spout during the response window and subsequently received the sucrose. A correct response during a no-go trial (“correct rejection”) occurred when the mouse successfully withheld lick response during the response window and thus avoided the delivery of quinine. Licking in no-go trials (false alarm, FA) resulted in the delivery of quinine. The performance was quantified as hit rate (number of hits / number of go trials) and correct rejection rate (number of correct rejections / number of no-go trials). Behavioral d-prime ( d’ ) was computed as follows: 𝑑 ′ = 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( 𝑃 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ) − 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁡ ( 𝑃 𝐹 ⁢ 𝐴 ) where norminv is the inverse of the cumulative normal function. Values of Hit and FA rate were truncated between 0.01 and 0.99, setting the maximum d’ to 4.65.
This task was designed to train mice to actively run on a wheel to pursue reward. Mice were first habituated to running on a wheel under head-restraint for 2-4 days (one session per day, each lasting 30∼45 min). Mice were subsequently subjected to training in which they were presented with a 1 s 3-kHz tone followed by a 1 s response window. If mice ran above a threshold speed (8 cm/s) during the response window, they would receive 8 μL of water delivered through a spout. Such trials were counted as “hit” trials. Otherwise mice would receive nothing. Mice were trained one session per day. The inter-trial interval was randomly variable between 10 to 16 s.
Water restricted mice were placed in a chamber equipped with a water port. Mice were first trained to poke into the port for water reward on a “fixed ratio 1” (FR1) schedule for 2 days, during which every nose-poke leads to a reward (5 μl of water). Following the FR1 training, the schedule was changed to FR4 for 2 days, which required the mice to poke the port 4 times with a maximal inter-poke-interval of 2 minutes in order to receive the reward. Next, the schedule was changed to FR10 for 1 day. Finally, mice were tested with a progressive ratio (PR) schedule in which the number of nose-pokes required to obtain one reward followed a geometric progression according to a function: 𝑁 𝑗 = 2 0 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑗 / 2 0 − 2 0 where j is the trial number. The function was modified on the basis of previous studies ( Hodos, 1961 31. Hodos, W. Progressive ratio as a measure of reward strength Science. 1961; 134 :943-944 Crossref Scopus (881) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richardson and Roberts, 1996 60. Richardson, N.R. ∙ Roberts, D.C. Progressive ratio schedules in drug self-administration studies in rats: a method to evaluate reinforcing efficacy J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 66 :1-11 Crossref Scopus (1092) PubMed Google Scholar ). Before the PR schedule, mice were tested in an FR10 session. For the optogenetic activation during PR, mice received 10 Hz photostimulation (10-ms pulses; 4 s laser on periods with 2 s laser off intervals; power, 10 mW; λ = 473 nm) during the entire PR session (60 min).
The structure of the task in each session is similar to that of the reward-seeking task described above. In each trial of the task, a sound (CS, 1 s in duration) was presented, followed by a response window (1 s in duration). Licking during the response window led to distinct outcomes in different sessions. In each training session, water-restricted mice were trained to lick during the response window to obtain one of the following outcomes: water, 200 mM sucrose, 300 mM NaCl, or 5 mM quinine. Mice obtained 8 μL of the respective solution in each hit trial. In the test session, mice were first presented with 30 trials to remind them of the specific outcome, then tested with photoactivation of aIC Fezf2 →NTS pathway in 20% of randomly selected trials. The photoactivation was applied in the time window between CS onset and US onset (λ = 473 nm; power, 10 mW measured at the tip of optic fibers; 20 Hz with a 10-ms pulse width). For the extinction session, previously well-trained mice received extinction training in which licking during the response window no longer resulted in any outcome. For the quenched condition, well-trained mice were given free access to water before the test and then tested in a session where water was the outcome. For the test with Ensure (Ensure Original Nutrition Powder, Abbott), mice were food restricted to 85% of free-feeding body weight, and then tested in a session where Ensure was the outcome (10 μL (0.015 calories) on each hit).
Freely moving mice were initially habituated to a two-sided chamber (23 × 33 × 25 cm; made from Plexiglas) for 10 min, during which their baseline preference for the left or right side of the chamber was assessed. During the first test session (10 min), we assigned one side of the chamber (counterbalanced across mice) as the photostimulation side, and placed the mice in the non-stimulation side to start the experiment. Once the mouse entered the stimulation side, photostimulation, generated by a 473 nm laser (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century, Shanghai, China), was immediately turned on, and was turned off as soon as the mouse exited the stimulation side. In the second test session (10 min) we repeated this procedure but assigned the other side of the chamber as the stimulation side. For optogenetic activation, the photostimulation parameters were 10-ms pulse width, 20-Hz frequency, 10-mW power measured at fiber tips. For optogenetic inhibition, the photostimulation was 10-mW constant illumination. The mice were videotaped during the test with a CCD camera interfaced with Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technologies), which was also used to control the laser stimulation and extract behavioral parameters (position, time, distance and velocity).
Freely moving mice were placed in a chamber equipped with two ports. Poking nose into one of the ports (the active port) triggered photostimulation (10-ms pulses, 20 Hz, 10 mW; λ = 473 nm) for 2 s in the NTS, whereas poking into the other port (the inactive port) did not trigger photostimulation. Mice were allowed to freely poke the two ports in 1-hour sessions, with the designation of active port in each session being counterbalanced.
Food or liquid intake was assessed in the home cage, where mice were individually housed. Mice were first food or water deprived for 24 hours. Their subsequent food or water intake in a 1-hour period was assessed. For optogenetic activation in this experiment, the photostimulation was 4 s trains of light pulses (10-ms pulse width, 20-Hz frequency, and 10-mW power measured at optical fiber tips) interleaved with 4 s light-off intervals. For optogenetic inhibition, the photostimulation was 4 s constant light illumination (10 mW) periods interleaved with 4 s light-off intervals. The light was generated by a 473 nm laser (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century, Shanghai, China). Experiments were conducted during the light-cycle, between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.
To monitor liquid intake at a finer temporal resolution, we trained thirsty mice to obtain sucrose solution from a bottle in a chamber. These mice were subsequently tested in sessions containing laser-on and laser-off blocks. Each session contained 3 laser-off blocks and 3 laser-on blocks, with each block lasting 3 min. Each session started from either a laser-on or a laser-off block, with the two types of blocks interleaved with each other. For optogenetic activation in the light-on blocks, the photostimulation parameters were 10-ms pulse width, 20-Hz frequency, 10-mW power. For optogenetic inhibition in the light-on blocks, the photostimulation was constant light illumination (10-mW power). The light was generated by a 473 nm laser (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century, Shanghai, China).
Water deprived mice were trained to lick a spout to obtain a sucrose solution (200 mM). Each lick triggered the delivery of 0.3 μL of the solution. It took mice 4-7 days to achieve stable licking, the criterion of which was 10-min of continuous licking without any gap longer than 10 s. The mice were subsequently tested in the optogenetic manipulation experiments.
Stimulus playback and trial control were performed via a Bpod/PulsePal open-source Arduino-based system (Sanworks, Stony Brook, NY, USA). Custom-written scripts in MATLAB based on Bpod commands were used to control the delivery of CS and US and record behavioral responses, including licking events, poking events and running velocity. Pure tones (70 dB; the CS) with different frequencies were generated as sine wave. The tones were uploaded to the audio adaptor board using the Bpod control system. The amount of liquid (the US) was controlled by fast solenoid valves (Lee Company). A metal spout was placed in front of the mouth of an animal for liquid delivery. In experiments which required delivery of sucrose and quinine, we used two tubes (one for each solution) epoxied together to avoid mixing of tastants. The spout also served as part of a custom “lickometer” circuit, which registered a lick event each time a mouse completed the circuit by licking the spout. The licking events were recorded and analyzed using custom scripts written in MATLAB. We used a rotary encoder (YUMO-E6B2-CWZ3E-1024; SparkFun Electronics) to detect and record real-time running velocity. The rotary encoder was attached to a running wheel and connected with a microcontroller (Arduino UNO R3; SparkFun Electronics). The running wheel (diameter, 14 cm; width, 8 cm) was made using a 3D printer (MakerBot Replicator 2; MakerBot). The microcontroller converted the digital inputs from the rotary encoder into analog signals reflecting running velocity, which was in turn recorded and analyzed with custom scripts written in MATLAB.
All imaging experiments were conducted on awake behaving mice under head-restraint in a dim, sound attenuated box. A one-photon imaging system modified from an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) with a 10 X objective (NA 0.3; Olympus, Cat. Number MPLFLN10x) was used to monitor GCaMP6 signals in behaving mice through the implanted GRIN lenses. The light source for imaging was a single-wavelength LED system (λ = 470 nm; https://www.coolled.com/ ) connected to the epifluorescence port of the Olympus BX51 microscope. The output power of the LED was set to 0.1-0.3 mW and was kept constant for the same subject across all imaging sessions. During imaging, the focus of the objective was adjusted such that the best dynamic fluorescence signals were at the focal plane. Visible landmarks, such as GCaMP6-expressing neurons and blood vessels, were used to help identify the same field of view (FOV) across different imaging sessions.
GCaMP6 fluorescence signals were captured with a monochrome CCD camera (pco.pixelfly, digital 14 bit CCD camera, image sensor ICX285AL) mounted onto the Olympus BX51. A custom Imaging Acquisition software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments) was used to interface the camera with a dedicated desktop computer and record the GCaMP6 signals at a frame rate of 10 frames/s. To synchronize imaging with behavioral events, Imaging Acquisition was triggered with a TTL (transistor-transistor logic) signal from the Bpod State Machine (Sanworks) used for behavioral control. During imaging, the timestamps of different events, including the trigger signals sent to Imaging Acquisition, CS onset, US onset and licking events, were all recorded with Bpod.
For imaging data processing and analysis, we first used Inscopix Data Processing software (v.1.2.0., Inscopix) to spatially down-sample all the raw images by a factor of 4 to reduce file size, and to correct the image stack for motion artifacts. The motion-corrected images were cropped to remove post-registration borders and margin areas. The pre-processed image stack was exported as a .tif file. Next, we used the extended constrained non-negative matrix factorization optimized for one-photon imaging (CNMF-E) ( Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016 57. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Soudry, D. ∙ Gao, Y. ...

We used the output C_raw, which corresponds to a scaled version of ΔF, for further analysis.
To determine whether a neuron was significantly (p < 0.05) excited or suppressed by a stimulus, and thus can be classified as being “responsive” to the stimulus, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the mean ΔF values in a period immediately after stimulus onset (the durations of which are indicated in figure legends) with those in the 4 s baseline period in all the trials imaged. For further analyses, such as the population analyses, we used z-scores to represent the dynamic activities in each neuron. To obtain the temporal z-scores for a neuron, we first obtained the mean activity trace for the neuron by averaging the fluorescence signals (ΔF) at each time point across all trials, and then computed the z-scores as (F(t) – F mean )/F SD , where F(t) is the ΔF value at time t, F mean , and F SD are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the ΔF values over a 4 s baseline period.
To assess the temporal relationship between the onset of behavioral licking response and the onset of neuronal response, for each neuron, we calculated the z-scored neuronal activity at each time point and averaged the values across all trials; for the licking response, we calculated the licking rate at each time point (bin = 50 ms) and averaged the values across all trials. Next, we applied the change-point analysis ( Gallistel et al., 2004 23. Gallistel, C.R. ∙ Fairhurst, S. ∙ Balsam, P. The learning curve: implications of a quantitative analysis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :13124-13131 Crossref Scopus (410) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paton et al., 2006 54. Paton, J.J. ∙ Belova, M.A. ∙ Morrison, S.E. ... The primate amygdala represents the positive and negative value of visual stimuli during learning Nature. 2006; 439 :865-870 Crossref Scopus (725) PubMed Google Scholar ) on these data to determine the time point at which the neuronal or behavioral response significantly changed (i.e., the change-point) following the presentation of CS. We repeated this for all neurons showing excitatory responses and calculated the difference between behavioral and neuronal change-points as the response delay for each neuron.
To analyze the trial-by-trial correlation between licking and neuronal responses, we first calculated the mean licking rate and the mean activity (z-scored) of each neuron during a specified time window (i.e., CS, US or baseline period) in each trial. We subsequently calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two measures.
To test for spatial clustering of neurons with specific response properties at a relatively fine scale (tens of microns), we calculated pairwise distances between all neurons. We then examined the distribution of distances between neurons that were either similar or different in their response type(s) (i.e., excited by sucrose versus inhibited by sucrose).
To identify and track the same individual cells from images acquired in different imaging sessions, we performed cell registration as previously described ( Sheintuch et al., 2017 65.

Commun. 2018; 9 :5195 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used a probabilistic method which automatically registered cells across multiple imaging sessions and estimated the registration confidence for each registered cell. Briefly, we first used the CNMF-E analysis to generate the spatial footprints for all cells imaged in a reference session (e.g., sodium-depletion or early-learning session). We then repeated this process for the cells imaged in a target session (e.g., recovery from sodium-depletion or late-learning session). We used the footprints from the reference session as a reference map, and aligned with this map the footprints from the target session by correcting for translation and rotation differences between different sessions. We subsequently calculated the probability of a given pair of cells, each from one of the two imaging sessions, to be the same cell (P same ) based on their spatial correlation and centroid distance. A pair of cells is considered to have the same identity if P same > 0.95. The centroid distance between a pair of cells deemed to have the same identity is generally small (≤6.5 μm).
To assess the relationship between aIC Fezf2 population activity and different trial types in the go/no-go task, we used a previously described ‘coding direction’ analysis ( Allen et al., 2019 1.

A Genetically Defined Compartmentalized Striatal Direct Pathway for Negative Reinforcement Cell. 2020; 183 :211-227.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). For a population of n neurons, we found an n × 1 vector in the n dimensional activity space that maximally separated the response vectors in two types of trials. We term this vector “coding direction ( cd ).” To obtain the cd of Hit and CR trials, for each neuron we first computed the average z-scored response in the two types of trials, r Hit and r CR , which are n × 1 response vectors that describe the population response at each time point, t . We then computed the difference in the mean response vectors, cd t = r Hit – r CR . We averaged the values of cd t from CS onset to US onset to obtain a single cd . For a population of n neurons, this yielded an n × 1 vector. The projection of population activity in Hit and CR trials along the cd was obtained as cd T r Hit and cd T r CR , respectively.
To quantify learning-induced changes in the similarity between neuronal responses at population level, we performed population vector analysis as previously described ( Rozeske et al., 2018 62. Rozeske, R.R. ∙ Jercog, D. ∙ Karalis, N. ... Prefrontal-Periaqueductal Gray-Projecting Neurons Mediate Context Fear Discrimination Neuron. 2018; 97 :898-910.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Li, 2018 83. Zhang, X. ∙ Li, B. Population coding of valence in the basolateral amygdala Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5195 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we created a series of n -dimensional (n = number of neurons) activity vectors for the responses (z-scored) of individual neurons at each time point. Therefore, the ensemble neuronal response at a particular time point is represented by a vector with a dimension equal to the total number of neurons in that ensemble. We computed the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between the vectors as a measure of the similarity between ensemble neuronal representations. For example, the MD between the ensemble representations to CS and US in hit trials in the go/no-go task is defined as: 𝑀 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁡ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑆 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 , 𝑈 ⁢ 𝑆 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ) = √ ( 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑆 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ) − 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝑈 ⁢ 𝑆 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ) ) 𝑇 ∗ 𝑆 − 1 ⁢ ( 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑆 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ) − 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑉 ⁡ ( 𝑈 ⁢ 𝑆 𝐻 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ) ) where PV(CS Hit ) and PV(US Hit ) are the individual and mean population vectors of responses to CS and US, respectively, in hit trials. S –1 is the inverse of the covariance matrix. The responses in a 3 s time window immediately after CS or US onset in the hit trials of the go/no-go task was used to generate the population vectors. The MD takes into account the differences in the means of the two sets of ensemble responses as well as their covariances.
For data visualization purpose, we used principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and projected the population vectors onto a two-dimensional space.
We performed population decoding analysis using the linear support vector machine (SVM) in MATLAB (fitcsvm) to determine whether the types of trials could be predicted on the basis of the trial-by-trial population activities of aIC Fezf2 or aIC NTS neurons acquired in each session. We used the activities of all the simultaneously imaged neurons in each session to perform the population decoding analysis. To compare decoding accuracy between aIC Fezf2 and aIC NTS neurons, we pooled all the aIC Fezf2 or aIC NTS neurons and randomly sampled a certain number of neurons from each population to perform the population analysis (iteration: 100 times). First, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) on the matrix of z-scored trial-by-trial neuronal activities. We used the first two or three PCs to represent the population activity in each trial. We subsequently used a subset of the low dimensional trial-by-trial neuronal activity data as the training dataset to train a classifier with linear kernel function (‘linear’) for two-class decoding (e.g., classifying large-reward block and small-reward block). Finally, we validated the classifier by using the ‘predict’ function to classify the trial-by-trial neuronal activities in the test dataset. Activities from randomly selected 75% of trials of each type were used to train the classifier, and activities from the remaining 25% of trials of each type were used to test decoding accuracy. To generate the shuffled data, we randomly reassigned a trial type to each of the trial-by-trial neuronal activities. We then followed the same procedure as that used for classifying the actual data to decode the shuffled data. We repeated this classification process 1,000 times for both the actual test dataset and the shuffled data, and calculated the average accuracy as the decoding accuracy.
To record the activities of NTS Recipient neurons or dopamine release in nucleus accumbens in vivo in behaving animals, we used a commercial fiber photometry system (Neurophotometrics Ltd., San Diego, CA, USA) to measure GCaMP6 or DA2m signals through an optical fiber implanted in the NTS or NAc core. A patch cord (fiber core diameter, 200 μm; Doric Lenses) was used to connect the photometry system with the implanted optical fiber. The intensity of the blue light (λ = 470 nm) for excitation was adjusted to a low level (20∼50 μW) at the tip of the patch cord. Emitted fluorescence was bandpass filtered and focused onto the sensor of a CCD camera. Photometry signals and behavioral events were aligned based on an analog TTL signal generated by the Bpod. Mean values of signals from a region of interest were calculated and saved by using Bonsai software (Bonsai), and were exported to MATLAB for further analysis.
To correct for photobleaching of fluorescence signals (baseline drift), a bi-exponential curve was fit to the raw fluorescence trace and subtracted as follows: 𝐹 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑤 _ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁡ ( 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁡ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 , 𝐹 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑤 , ′ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 2 ′ ) 𝐹 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑤 _ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 = 𝐹 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑤 − 𝐹 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑤 _ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 𝐹 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑤 _ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 After baseline drift correction, the fluorescence signals were z-scored relative to the mean and standard deviation of the signals in a time window −4 to 0 s relative to CS onset.
For the simultaneous optogenetic stimulation and photometry experiments, the mice received photostimulation in the NTS in the window between CS onset and US onset (3 s duration) in 33% of randomly selected trials, while we recorded DA2m fluorescence signals in NAc core using fiber photometry. The photostimulation parameters were 20-Hz pulse frequency, 10-ms pulse width, 5-mW power, 473-nm wavelength.
To identify pairs of laser-off and laser-on go trials with comparable lick rates, we first calculated the average lick rate from CS onset to US onset for each trial. We then searched all the laser-off trials for trials having the lick rates within 10% ± the rate of a laser-on trial. Of these, we then selected the laser-off trial that had a lick rate nearest to that of the laser-on trial. We compared the DA2m signals in such “matched” laser-off and laser-on trials. We used a lower power of laser for the stimulation to minimize the effect on licking, and thus increase the number of laser-on trials with lick rates comparable to those in laser-off trials.
Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB or a commercial software (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software, CA). The statistical test used for each comparison is indicated when used. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to check for main effects and interactions in experiments with repeated-measures and more than one factor. When main effects or interactions were significant, we did the planned comparisons according to experimental design (for example, comparing laser on and off conditions). All comparisons were two tailed. Threshold for significance was placed at ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. The box-and-whisker plots indicate median, first and third quartiles, and min and max values. All data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless stated otherwise.
