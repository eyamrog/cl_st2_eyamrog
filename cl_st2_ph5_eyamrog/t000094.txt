Section: Abstract

The evolutionary features and molecular innovations that enabled plants to first colonize land are not well understood. Here, insights are provided through our report of the genome sequence of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum , a member of the Zygnematophyceae, the sister lineage to land plants. The genome has a high proportion of repeat sequences that are associated with massive segmental gene duplications, likely facilitating neofunctionalization. Compared with representatives of earlier diverging algal lineages, P. margaritaceum has expanded repertoires of gene families, signaling networks, and adaptive responses that highlight the evolutionary trajectory toward terrestrialization. These encompass a broad range of physiological processes and protective cellular features, such as flavonoid compounds and large families of modifying enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, assembly, and remodeling. Transcriptome profiling further elucidated adaptations, responses, and selective pressures associated with the semi-terrestrial ecosystems of P. margaritaceum , where a simple body plan would be an advantage.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

One of the most momentous evolutionary events in the history of life on Earth is thought to have occurred approximately 600 million years ago (mya) ( Morris et al., 2018 90. Morris, J.L. ∙ Puttick, M.N. ∙ Clark, J.W. ... The timescale of early land plant evolution Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E2274-E2283 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ), when a single lineage of freshwater algae developed the capacity to colonize land ( Delwiche and Timme, 2011 34. Delwiche, C.F. ∙ Timme, R.E. Plants Curr. Biol. 2011; 21 :R417-R422 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). These pioneering oxygenating autotrophs had a profound effect on the atmosphere and geochemical composition of the soil ( Delwiche and Cooper, 2015; Rensing, 2018 33. Delwiche, C.F. ∙ Cooper, E.D. The evolutionary origin of a terrestrial flora Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :R899-R910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar 113. Rensing, S.A. Great moments in evolution: the conquest of land by plants Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2018; 42 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) and paved the way for an explosion of land plant diversification. Green plants (Viridiplantae) are comprised of the chlorophyte algae and the monophyletic group Streptophyta, which consists of land plants (embryophytes) and charophyte algae ( Figure 1 A). There is now considerable molecular evidence that the late divergent charophyte group Zygnematophyceae includes the closest relatives of land plants ( Cheng et al., 2019; Leebens-Mack et al., 2019 21. Cheng, S. ∙ Xian, W. ∙ Fu, Y. ... Genomes of subaerial Zygnematophyceae provide insights into land plant evolution Cell. 2019; 179 :1057-1067.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Leebens-Mack, J.H. ∙ Barker, M.S. ∙ Carpenter, E.J. ..., One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative One thousand plant transcriptomes and the phylogenomics of green plants Nature. 2019; 574 :679-685 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this might be considered somewhat counterintuitive as members of the Zygnematophyceae exhibit a notably simpler body plan (e.g., unicells and filaments) than the multicellular, branched members of the Charophyceae or Coleochaetophyceae and also undergo sexual reproduction via conjugation rather than oogamy.
Extant charophytes have a remarkable range of body plans, even though fossil evidence suggests that they represent only a small proportion of the variation that existed previously ( Feist et al., 2005 44. Feist, M. ∙ Liu, J. ∙ Tafforeau, P. New insights into Paleozoic charophyte morphology and phylogeny Am. J. Bot. 2005; 92 :1152-1160 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). This morphological diversity and its underlying developmental machinery provide a rich set of opportunities to elucidate adaptations that might have been critical for the invasion of land. Here we present the genome and transcriptomes of the unicellular desmid Penium margaritaceum , an archetype of the Zygnematophyceae with the simplest of body plans ( Figure 1 B). P. margaritaceum has an architecturally complex land plant-like cell wall ( Domozych et al., 2007; 2014; Sørensen et al., 2011 38. Domozych, D.S. ∙ Serfis, A. ∙ Kiemle, S.N. ... The structure and biochemistry of charophycean cell walls: I. Pectins of Penium margaritaceum Protoplasma. 2007; 230 :99-115 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Domozych, D.S. ∙ Sørensen, I. ∙ Popper, Z.A. ...

Sørensen, I. ∙ Pettolino, F.A. ∙ Bacic, A. ... The charophycean green algae provide insights into the early origins of plant cell walls Plant J. 2011; 68 :201-211 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and secretes mucilaginous polysaccharides ( Figures 1 C and 1D), which might be associated with its adaptation to living in transient wetlands that experience frequent drying. In this study, we sought to identify suites of genes and processes that facilitate adaptation to an ephemeral semi-terrestrial life style and determine whether the relatively simple morphology of P. margaritaceum is associated with genome features, such as reductionism, compared with that of other charophyte lineages that have more complex multicellular body plans. We further investigated the responses of P. margaritaceum to a range of abiotic stresses to elucidate the adaptations that enable tolerance of the environmental challenges imposed by terrestrial habitats.

Section: Results

We generated a total of 954 Gb Illumina paired-end and 433 Gb mate-pair sequences ( Table S1 A) representing 201× and 92× coverage, respectively, of the haploid genome of P. margaritaceum with an estimated size of 4.7 Gb ( Data S1 A). Assembly of these sequences resulted in 332,786 scaffolds with a cumulative size of 3.661 Gb and an N50 of 116.1 kb. The assembly captured most of the k-mers in the Illumina reads, and low-frequency k-mers representing sequencing errors were absent ( Data S1 A). In addition, the mapping rates of genomic and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads against the assembly were 97.5% and 96.8%, respectively ( Table S1 B). The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequency distribution on the 100 longest scaffolds was consistent with a haploid genome ( Data S1 A). The mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes were also fully assembled and comprised 95,332 and 145,411 nucleotides, respectively ( Data S1 B).
The assembly contains a large proportion (80.6%) of repeat sequences ( Table S1 C), particularly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and simple repeats ( Figure 2 A). Unlike land plants and most other green algae, in which gypsy is the predominant LTR retrotransposon family, the P. margaritaceum genome has a large proportion of copia retrotransposons, which are rare in other late-divergent charophytes and absent from Chara braunii ( Nishiyama et al., 2018 97. Nishiyama, T. ∙ Sakayama, H. ∙ de Vries, J. ... The Chara genome: secondary complexity and implications for plant terrestrialization Cell. 2018; 174 :448-464.e24 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). An estimation of divergence time indicated that the copia expansion in the P. margaritaceum genome was relatively recent, around 2.1 mya ( Figure 2 B). Retrotransposons carrying tyrosine recombinases, such as the Dictyostelium intermediate repeat sequence (DIRS) and Ngaro families, which are found in some chlorophyte and charophyte genomes, are not present in the zygnematophycean algae P. margaritaceum and Spirogloea muscicola or in land plants ( Figure 2 A). However, DIRS retrotransposons are found in another zygnematophycean alga, Mesotaenium endlicherianum , suggesting separate secondary losses in some of the Zygnematophyceae and the embryophyte lineage.
We predicted 52,333 high-confidence protein-coding genes in the P. margaritaceum genome, of which 99.3% were supported by RNA-seq data or by homologs in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. An assessment of gene space completeness using BUSCO ( Simão et al., 2015 121. Simão, F.A. ∙ Waterhouse, R.M. ∙ Ioannidis, P. ... BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness with single-copy orthologs Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3210-3212 Crossref Scopus (2893) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated a low rate of missing genes (8.25%) but a relatively high fragmented gene rate (21.45%). To inform the annotation, we performed transcriptome sequencing with Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) technology, which generated 52,134 full-length transcripts consisting of 73,813 isoforms. These PacBio transcripts, together with 145,267 representative transcripts assembled from RNA-seq data, were used to build a master gene set by integration with the high-confidence gene models. The final master gene set consisted of 53,262 genes. The missing and fragmented gene rates of the master gene set were 2.31% and 13.20%, respectively, and the complete BUSCO rate was 84.49% ( Table S1 D). This master gene set was used for downstream analyses.
Orthologous genes among P. margaritaceum and 17 representative species spanning the green plant lineage were identified. Phylogenetic analysis of low-copy orthologous groups confirmed the close relationship between Zygnematophyceae and land plants and revealed divergence times deep within the Zygnematophyceae lineage. P. margaritaceum diverged from M . endlicherianum ~496 mya, predating a proposed crown origin of embryophytes (473 mya) ( Figure 3 A; Table S1 E). The P. margaritaceum genome has not undergone any recent whole-genome duplications (WGDs) ( Data S1 C), which were also not evident in other sequenced charophytes except S. muscicola , whose genome experienced a recent triplication event ( Cheng et al., 2019; Nishiyama et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020 21.

Wang, S. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Li, H. ... Genomes of early-diverging streptophyte algae shed light on plant terrestrialization Nat. Plants. 2020; 6 :95-106 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, substantial segmental gene duplications were found in P. margaritaceum , which is consistent with the high transposable element (TE) abundance, given that massive segmental gene duplications are often present in organisms with a high TE content ( Panchy et al., 2016 102. Panchy, N. ∙ Lehti-Shiu, M. ∙ Shiu, S.-H. Evolution of gene duplication in plants Plant Physiol. 2016; 171 :2294-2316 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We looked for evidence of morphological and physiological adaptations and key traits associated with terrestrialization through the reconstruction of gene family evolution, focusing on gene family expansions ( Figure 3 A; Table S1 F). No such expansions were found (p < 0.05) between the common ancestor of the Viridiplantae and that of the streptophytes. However, bursts of gene family expansion were evident, coinciding with the emergence of various charophyte lineages. A particularly large number of expanded gene families (124, p < 0.05) was detected in the common ancestor of the Zygnematophyceae and land plants ( Figure 3 A). Most of these, and the gene families involved in the previous bursts, are functionally associated with responses to stresses such as water deprivation, cold, bacteria, and oxidative stress as well as production and signaling of the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA), auxin (AUX), ethylene (ETH), and jasmonic acid (JA). Other substantially expanded gene categories are related to protein phosphorylation and cell wall organization ( Table S1 G).
The P . margaritaceum genome encodes 935 transcription factors (TFs) and 454 transcriptional regulators (TRs) ( Tables S1 H and S1I), which are substantially more than in chlorophytes (125–221 and 136–280, respectively) or most other charophytes (97–649, 160–495). Although there appears to be a general trend between morphological complexity and the size of the TF and/or TR (TF/TR) infrastructure in land plants ( Wilhelmsson et al., 2017 139. Wilhelmsson, P.K.I. ∙ Mühlich, C. ∙ Ullrich, K.K. ... Comprehensive genome-wide classification reveals that many plant-specific transcription factors evolved in streptophyte algae Genome Biol. Evol. 2017; 9 :3384-3397 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), exceptions have been reported for some chlorophyte algae ( De Clerck et al., 2018; Prochnik et al., 2010 28. De Clerck, O. ∙ Kao, S.-M. ∙ Bogaert, K.A. ... Insights into the evolution of multicellularity from the sea lettuce genome Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :2921-2933.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar 108. Prochnik, S.E. ∙ Umen, J. ∙ Nedelcu, A.M. ... Genomic analysis of organismal complexity in the multicellular green alga Volvox carteri Science. 2010; 329 :223-226 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are similar exceptions among charophyte algae because P. margaritaceum and S. muscicola , unicellular members of the Zygnematophyceae, have considerably more TF/TRs than the multicellular, branched C. braunii ( Figure S1 ). However, it is notable that, in some cases, the portfolio of TF/TRs is dominated by a major expansion in one or a few families, as exemplified by the large size of the trihelix TF family in C. braunii or the GRAS family in P. margaritaceum ( Table S1 H). Thus, secondary reductions in structural complexity, as in the unicellular P. margaritaceum , are not necessarily accompanied by reductions in total TF/TR complements, and key drivers of maintaining or expanding the regulatory infrastructure might be factors associated with adaptation to specific habitats and ecological niches. The GRAS, NAC, LOB, bZIP, basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH), WRKY, and ERF families, all of which have been associated with abiotic stress responses in embryophytes, showed large expansions in the Zygnematophyceae, most notably in P. margaritaceum and S. muscicola , compared with those in other algal lineages ( Figure 3 B). Moreover, the GRAS and BBR-BPC TF families, as well as specific subfamilies of the bHLH, WRKY, NAC, and ERF families, showed evidence of having originated in the common ancestor of the Zygnematophyceae and land plants ( Data S2 A–S2D). For example, the P. margaritaceum genome encodes 34 proteins that are orthologs of the DREB subfamily of ERF TFs, but corresponding orthologs are not present in algae other than the Zygnematophyceae ( Data S2 D). In land plants, these regulatory proteins are involved in responses to abiotic stresses such as cold, dehydration, salinity, and heat ( Agarwal et al., 2017 1. Agarwal, P.K. ∙ Gupta, K. ∙ Lopato, S. ... Dehydration responsive element binding transcription factors and their applications for the engineering of stress tolerance J. Exp. Bot. 2017; 68 :2135-2148 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Eight TF families were found to be present only in embryophytes, consistent with land plant innovations. Conversely, examples of secondary losses of TF families have been suggested among the Zygnematophyceae, with five families in P. margaritaceum and five and four in S. muscicola and M. endlicherianum , respectively, that were specifically absent from those species ( Table S1 H).
Among the P. margaritaceum TF families, a notable feature is the remarkably large size of the GRAS family (291; Figure 3 B). GRAS genes are present in land plants and some Zygnematophyceae ( Delaux et al., 2015; Engstrom, 2011 32. Delaux, P.-M. ∙ Radhakrishnan, G.V. ∙ Jayaraman, D. ... Algal ancestor of land plants was preadapted for symbiosis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :13390-13395 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Engstrom, E.M. Phylogenetic analysis of GRAS proteins from moss, lycophyte and vascular plant lineages reveals that GRAS genes arose and underwent substantial diversification in the ancestral lineage common to bryophytes and vascular plants Plant Signal. Behav. 2011; 6 :850-854 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and might originally have been acquired from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ( Cheng et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2012 21. Cheng, S. ∙ Xian, W. ∙ Fu, Y. ... Genomes of subaerial Zygnematophyceae provide insights into land plant evolution Cell. 2019; 179 :1057-1067.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 146.

Bacterial GRAS domain proteins throw new light on gibberellic acid response mechanisms Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :2407-2411 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). In land plants, they have functionally diversified to regulate processes that are inherent to complex multicellular body plans and three-dimensional architecture, including meristem development, cell division, and expansion in roots and shoots, vascular development, and seed maturation, as well as stress responses ( Bolle, 2004; Ma et al., 2010 12.

The salt- and drought-inducible poplar GRAS protein SCL7 confers salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana J. Exp. Bot. 2010; 61 :4011-4019 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). This functional divergence has been hypothesized to occur after terrestrialization because algal GRAS proteins form a monophyletic clade located outside of the land plant group ( Hernández-García et al., 2019 54. Hernández-García, J. ∙ Briones-Moreno, A. ∙ Dumas, R. ... Origin of gibberellin-dependent transcriptional regulation by molecular exploitation of a transactivation domain in DELLA proteins Mol. Biol. Evol. 2019; 36 :908-918 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in a comparative analysis that included transcriptome ( Hernández-García et al., 2019 54. Hernández-García, J. ∙ Briones-Moreno, A. ∙ Dumas, R. ... Origin of gibberellin-dependent transcriptional regulation by molecular exploitation of a transactivation domain in DELLA proteins Mol. Biol. Evol. 2019; 36 :908-918 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and genome data, we found that GRAS proteins from P. margaritaceum and other Zygnematophyceae aligned into three groups, two of which cluster with land plant GRAS subfamilies ( Figure 3 C). This suggests that the GRAS family expanded in the common ancestor of the Zygnematophyceae and land plants, consistent with the results of Cheng et al. (2019) 21. Cheng, S. ∙ Xian, W. ∙ Fu, Y. ... Genomes of subaerial Zygnematophyceae provide insights into land plant evolution Cell. 2019; 179 :1057-1067.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar . Although the balance of evidence suggests that it also originated in this ancestor, definitive evidence has yet to be presented ( Cheng et al., 2019; Cooper and Delwiche, 2016 21. Cheng, S. ∙ Xian, W. ∙ Fu, Y. ...

A wide range of algal lineages, including charophytes, are capable of synthesizing and responding to classical plant hormones, but their physiological roles in algae are typically not well characterized ( Holzinger and Pichrtová, 2016; Ju et al., 2015; Lu and Xu, 2015; Ohtaka et al., 2017 55.

Primitive auxin response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the charophyte alga Klebsormidium nitens Plant Physiol. 2017; 174 :1621-1632 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, the published charophyte genomes do not encode the complete set of orthologs of land plant hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways ( Cheng et al., 2019; Hori et al., 2014; Nishiyama et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020 21.

Wang, S. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Li, H. ... Genomes of early-diverging streptophyte algae shed light on plant terrestrialization Nat. Plants. 2020; 6 :95-106 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 ; Table S1 J; Data S2 E–S2V). We investigated the genome of P. margaritaceum for evidence of evolutionary innovations associated with the F-box-mediated (AUX, JA, gibberellins [GA], and strigolactone [SL]) and two-component (cytokinin [CK] and ETH) signaling pathways as well as the ABA, salicylic acid (SA) and brassinosteroid (BR) pathways ( Figure 4 ).
In addition to the absence of a canonical AUX biosynthetic pathway, P. margaritaceum and the other charophytes do not have F box genes that cluster with the land plant AUX receptor TIR1 or its paralog COI1 , which encodes a JA receptor ( Table S1 J; Data S2 F) ( Bowman et al., 2019 14. Bowman, J.L. ∙ Briginshaw, L.N. ∙ Fisher, T.J. ... Something ancient and something neofunctionalized-evolution of land plant hormone signaling pathways Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2019; 47 :64-72 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Land plant AUX signaling involves binding of the TR AUX/IAA to the co-repressor TOPLESS, TIR1, and AUX REPSONSE FACTOR (ARF) TFs through its I, II, and PB1 domains, respectively ( Leyser, 2018 70. Leyser, O. Auxin Signaling Plant Physiol. 2018; 176 :465-479 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). C. braunii has two AUX/IAA proteins, and both lack domains I and II, whereas one of the two P. margaritaceum AUX/IAA proteins has prototypes of both domains ( Table S1 J; Data S2 G). This is reflected in a phylogenetic tree where the C. braunii AUX/IAA proteins cluster within a monophyletic clade formed by non-canonical AUX/IAAs, which lack domains I and II, whereas the P. margaritaceum homologs and land plant canonical AUX/IAAs are derived from a common ancestor ( Data S2 G). Notably, the other two sequenced Zygnematophyceae, S. muscicola and M. endlicherianum , do not have AUX/IAA genes, indicating a secondary loss in these species. ARFs are ancient, predating formation of a canonical AUX signaling network, and are categorized in land plants into three classes (A, B, and C). The evolutionary history of the ARF family has not yet been fully resolved with the support of genome sequences ( Martin-Arevalillo et al., 2019; Mutte et al., 2018 85. Martin-Arevalillo, R. ∙ Thévenon, E. ∙ Jégu, F. ... Evolution of the auxin response factors from charophyte ancestors PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008400 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar 91. Mutte, S.K. ∙ Kato, H. ∙ Rothfels, C. ... Origin and evolution of the nuclear auxin response system eLife. 2018; 7 :e33399 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chlorokybus atmophyticus , C. braunii , and M. endlicherianum have a single C-ARF, whereas P. margaritaceum has two ARFs that cluster with land plant A/B-ARFs ( Data S2 H). Homology modeling revealed a high degree of protein structure conservation between the two P. margaritaceum ARFs and ARF1 (B-ARF) from the model land plant Arabidopsis thaliana , particularly in proximity to the dimerization domain ( Data S2 H). A/B-ARFs were also found in other Zygnematophyceae, but not in early divergent charophytes ( Data S2 H). This supports a model where the C class originated in a basal charophyte prior to emergence of A/B-ARF genes ( Martin-Arevalillo et al., 2019 85. Martin-Arevalillo, R. ∙ Thévenon, E. ∙ Jégu, F. ... Evolution of the auxin response factors from charophyte ancestors PLoS Genet. 2019; 15 :e1008400 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) and where secondary losses of C-ARFs have occurred sporadically within charophyte lineages.
The classical BR steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway includes DET2 and four members of the CYP85 clade of cytochrome P450 enzymes ( Bak et al., 2011 3. Bak, S. ∙ Beisson, F. ∙ Bishop, G. ... Cytochromes p450 Arabidopsis Book. 2011; 9 :e0144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). DET2 orthologs are found widely in algae and land plants, but the four CYP85 enzymes are specific to vascular plants ( Data S2 S and S2T). BR regulates gene expression and plant development through a receptor kinase-mediated signal transduction pathway ( Kim et al., 2009 62. Kim, T.-W. ∙ Guan, S. ∙ Sun, Y. ... Brassinosteroid signal transduction from cell-surface receptor kinases to nuclear transcription factors Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11 :1254-1260 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ), and three of the five kinases, including the BR receptors BRI1 and BAK1, are only present in land plants ( Figure 4 ; Table S1 J). However, contrary to a recent report that BSKs were an embryophyte innovation ( Li et al., 2019 76. Li, Z. ∙ Shen, J. ∙ Liang, J. Genome-wide identification, expression profile, and alternative splicing analysis of the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase (BSK) family genes in Arabidopsis Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 :E1138 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found orthologs of BSK kinases ( Data S2 U) as well as BZR TFs ( Data S2 V) in P. margaritaceum and the two other Zygnematophyceae but not in C. braunii or early divergent charophytes. This suggests that these important components of the BR signaling circuitry, which governs cell elongation, interaction with other hormone networks, light signaling, and stress responses in land plants ( Ren et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2010 111. Ren, H. ∙ Willige, B.C. ∙ Jaillais, Y. ...

The colonization of terrestrial habitats by embryophytes has been dependent on the ability to synthesize complex cell walls that provide biomechanical support and protection against environmental stresses. Land plant primary walls are comprised of a core scaffolding of cellulose microfibrils embedded within matrices of interconnecting pectin and hemicellulose polysaccharides together with glycoproteins ( Burton et al., 2010; Dehors et al., 2019; Popper et al., 2011 15.

However, immunological and biochemical studies suggest that the capacity to synthesize many of the polysaccharides of extant embryophyte walls evolved prior to the ancestral land plant, during divergence of the charophyte algae ( Sørensen et al., 2011 122.

Consistent with this idea, among the most remarkable examples of gene families showing expansion in P. margaritaceum are those encoding carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes; Cantarel et al., 2009 18. Cantarel, B.L. ∙ Coutinho, P.M. ∙ Rancurel, C. ... The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for Glycogenomics Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :D233-D238 Crossref Scopus (3507) PubMed Google Scholar ) of the glycosyl hydrolase (GH), glycosyl transferase (GT), carbohydrate esterase (CE), and polysaccharide lyase (PL) classes as well as carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) and auxiliary activities (AAs) ( Figure 5 A; Table S1 K). CAZy enzymes are involved in diverse aspects of carbohydrate chemistry, including intracellular glycoconjugates, but notably include many that might be functionally associated with cell walls. As a general trend, the CAZy gene family sizes are smaller in chlorophytes and in the earlier-diverging charophytes Mesostigma viride and C. atmophyticus . The abundance of GH, GT, and PL genes in P. margaritaceum is particularly striking, and in the case of GTs and PLs there are more than in any of the green plant lineages. The large sizes of the classes typically reflect expansions within individual gene families ( Figure 5 A). Particularly prominent examples include pectinases such as the GH28 polygalacturonase and PL1 pectate lyase families and GH16 (xyloglucan transglycosylase/hydrolase [XTH] and endo-glucanase 16) enzymes, as well as the expansin family of cell wall-loosening proteins ( Cosgrove, 2015 26. Cosgrove, D.J. Plant expansins: diversity and interactions with plant cell walls Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2015; 25 :162-172 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is not included in the CAZy grouping ( Table S1 L). Given that P. margaritaceum is unicellular, the particularly large size of these protein families is not explained by heterogeneity in wall architecture associated with different cell types or body plan complexity. Rather, it might reflect duplication and neofunctionalization, resulting in differences in enzyme activities and properties.
Additionally, the high-level grouping of members in CAZy gene families can mask the emergence of novel enzymatic activities within distinct subgroups. Indeed, many GH and PL families are known to be “polyspecific,” encompassing several related but distinct substrate specificities ( Lombard et al., 2010; Viborg et al., 2019 77. Lombard, V. ∙ Bernard, T. ∙ Rancurel, C. ... A hierarchical classification of polysaccharide lyases for glycogenomics Biochem. J. 2010; 432 :437-444 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar 133.

Chem. 2019; 294 :15973-15986 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). GH16 is one such family, in which a unique subfamily of mixed-function plant endo-glucanases (comprising clades EG16 and EG16-2) has recently been delineated as a sister group to the XTHs ( Behar et al., 2018; Eklöf et al., 2013; McGregor et al., 2017 8. Behar, H. ∙ Graham, S.W. ∙ Brumer, H.

The presence of EG16-2 homologs in P. margaritaceum (12 genes), M. endlicherianum (3), S. muscicola (8), and Klebsormidium nitens (6) ( Figure 5 B; Data S2 W), is concordant with the early evolution of this endo-glucanase subfamily ( Behar et al., 2018 8. Behar, H. ∙ Graham, S.W. ∙ Brumer, H. Comprehensive cross-genome survey and phylogeny of glycoside hydrolase family 16 members reveals the evolutionary origin of EG16 and XTH proteins in plant lineages Plant J. 2018; 95 :1114-1128 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the GH16 family composition suggests that XTHs originated in the last common ancestor of the Zygnematophyceae and land plants.
Another critical innovation for terrestrial plant life has been elaboration of specific cell wall types with other classes of structural polymers to provide additional biophysical attributes for structural support and barrier properties. Examples include the phenylpropanoid polymer lignin in xylem vessel walls and deposition of the structurally related lipid polyesters cutin and suberin, examples of which are found in the hydrophobic cuticle of epidermal cells and the endodermis of roots, respectively ( Fich et al., 2016; Renault et al., 2019 45. Fich, E.A. ∙ Segerson, N.A. ∙ Rose, J.K.C. The plant polyester cutin: biosynthesis, structure, and biological roles Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2016; 67 :207-233 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar 112. Renault, H. ∙ Werck-Reichhart, D. ∙ Weng, J.-K. Harnessing lignin evolution for biotechnological applications Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2019; 56 :105-111 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). Algae do not have true cuticles, but a search for homologs of genes that are known in A. thaliana to be associated with extracellular polyesters and hydrophobic wax compounds revealed traces in P. margaritaceum and other later-diverging charophytes of cuticle biosynthetic, transport, and assembly frameworks ( Table S1 M). These encode enzymes involved in intracellular biosynthesis as well as transporters and secreted proteins that have been linked to extracellular lipid trafficking and cuticle assembly ( Yeats and Rose, 2013 143. Yeats, T.H. ∙ Rose, J.K.C. The formation and function of plant cuticles Plant Physiol. 2013; 163 :5-20 Crossref Scopus (499) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, homologs of cutin synthase (CUS) and BODYGUARD (BDG), which contribute to cuticle assembly in land plants, are present in K. nitens and P. margaritaceum , and BDG was also found in M. endlicherianum . However, other gene families that are central to cuticle formation are unique to land plants; the single exception is a distant homolog of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 6 (GPAT6) ( Data S2 X). The quantitative and qualitative changes in cuticle-associated genes from chlorophytes to land plants is marked by a transition phase from earlier- to later-diverging charophytes ( Table S1 M). The phylogenetic distribution of these genes is consistent with stepwise expansion and neofunctionalization of ancient core lipid biosynthetic machinery to synthesize structural lipid precursors in conjunction with systems for their secretion. There is no evidence in P. margaritaceum or other charophytes of primordial cutin and suberin polyesters, and although wax-like lipid deposits have been reported in the cell walls of K. nitens ( Kondo et al., 2016 65. Kondo, S. ∙ Hori, K. ∙ Sasaki-Sekimoto, Y. ... Primitive extracellular lipid components on the surface of the charophytic alga Klebsormidium flaccidum and their possible biosynthetic pathways as deduced from the genome sequence Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7 :952 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), assembly of extracellular hydrophobic polymers was likely a land plant innovation.
There are parallels between the origins of cuticles and suberized walls and the evolution of lignin, which is deposited in the secondary walls of specific tissues and cell types in land plants to provide structural reinforcement and protection against pathogens and to limit water diffusion ( Terrett and Dupree, 2019; Zhong et al., 2019 130. Terrett, O.M. ∙ Dupree, P. Covalent interactions between lignin and hemicelluloses in plant secondary cell walls Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2019; 56 :97-104 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar 151. Zhong, R. ∙ Cui, D. ∙ Ye, Z.-H. Secondary cell wall biosynthesis New Phytol. 2019; 221 :1703-1723 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lignin is synthesized through the phenylpropanoid pathway, and although lignin or lignin-like compounds have been reported in non-vascular plants, including charophytes, some of these likely resulted from misidentification of polyphenols, and true lignin is specific to vascular plants ( Weng and Chapple, 2010 138. Weng, J.-K. ∙ Chapple, C. The origin and evolution of lignin biosynthesis New Phytol. 2010; 187 :273-285 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). The P. margaritaceum genome does not have genes that provide a canonical core phenylpropanoid pathway ( Table S1 N), including the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) at the entry point, which has been proposed previously to have been acquired by land plants through HGT ( Emiliani et al., 2009 42. Emiliani, G. ∙ Fondi, M. ∙ Fani, R. ... A horizontal gene transfer at the origin of phenylpropanoid metabolism: a key adaptation of plants to land Biol. Direct. 2009; 4 :7 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, PAL homologs are present in K. nitens and C. braunii , and other core phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes show a similar “patchwork” distribution among K. nitens , C. braunii , and the Zygnematophyceae ( de Vries et al., 2017 29. de Vries, J. ∙ de Vries, S. ∙ Slamovits, C.H. ... How embryophytic is the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids and their derivatives in streptophyte algae? Plant Cell Physiol. 2017; 58 :934-945 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 N). This suggests a complex evolutionary history in the production of soluble lignin-like compounds in charophytes, some of which are incorporated into the cell wall ( Sørensen et al., 2011; Weng and Chapple, 2010 122. Sørensen, I. ∙ Pettolino, F.A. ∙ Bacic, A. ... The charophycean green algae provide insights into the early origins of plant cell walls Plant J. 2011; 68 :201-211 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar 138. Weng, J.-K. ∙ Chapple, C. The origin and evolution of lignin biosynthesis New Phytol. 2010; 187 :273-285 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Development in charophytes and early land plants of mechanisms to secrete and assemble phenolic and aliphatic compounds likely gave rise to an increasingly diverse palette of protective extracellular biopolymers. Subsets of these paved the way for formation of the lignin, cutin, and suberin polymers that are found in the walls of extant land plants ( Niklas et al., 2017; Philippe et al., 2020; Renault et al., 2019 96. Niklas, K.J. ∙ Cobb, E.D. ∙ Matas, A.J. The evolution of hydrophobic cell wall biopolymers: from algae to angiosperms J. Exp. Bot. 2017; 68 :5261-5269 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar 106. Philippe, G. ∙ Sørensen, I. ∙ Jiao, C. ... Cutin and suberin: assembly and origins of specialized lipidic cell wall scaffolds Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2020; 55 :11-20 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 112. Renault, H. ∙ Werck-Reichhart, D. ∙ Weng, J.-K. Harnessing lignin evolution for biotechnological applications Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2019; 56 :105-111 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Neo- and subfunctionalization of catalytically promiscuous enzymes, including those in the ancient shikimate pathway ( Niklas et al., 2017 96. Niklas, K.J. ∙ Cobb, E.D. ∙ Matas, A.J. The evolution of hydrophobic cell wall biopolymers: from algae to angiosperms J. Exp. Bot. 2017; 68 :5261-5269 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), would provide metabolic plasticity, which is associated with the evolution and functional diversification of phenylpropanoid compounds. However, the absence in the genome of P. margaritaceum and other charophytes of clear candidates for key steps in the pathway leading to various phenylpropanoid compound classes suggests the existence of cryptic activities and novel enzymes. A notable example is flavonoids, which were originally thought to only exist in land plants but have been identified in a few divergent algal lineages ( Yonekura-Sakakibara et al., 2019 144. Yonekura-Sakakibara, K. ∙ Higashi, Y. ∙ Nakabayashi, R. The origin and evolution of plant flavonoid metabolism Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 :943 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among other functions, flavonoids provide protection against UV radiation, which would have been a major challenge for the first land plants. We identified multiple classes of flavonoids in P. margaritaceum by mass spectrometry ( Data S3 A–S3D), consistent with the presence of biosynthetic routes that are commonly found in land plants ( Figure S2 ). P. margaritaceum has homologs of 4-coumarate:coenzyme A (CoA) ligase (4CL) and, most notably, homologs of chalcone synthase (CHS), which acts at the entry to the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Paradoxically though, P. margaritaceum has neither PAL nor a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) in the same cytochrome P450 subfamily (CYP73A) as the C4H genes of land plants ( Yonekura-Sakakibara et al., 2019 144. Yonekura-Sakakibara, K. ∙ Higashi, Y. ∙ Nakabayashi, R. The origin and evolution of plant flavonoid metabolism Front. Plant Sci. 2019; 10 :943 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S1 N). Thus, in P. margaritaceum , there is no clear mechanism to synthesize cinnamic acid and coumaric acid, which are intermediates in formation of the coumaroyl-CoA substrate for CHS ( Figure S2 ). Some of the genes functioning downstream of CHS, such as chalcone isomerase (CHI) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), which lead to the spectrum of flavonoid compounds, are also absent. There are similar absences in the genomes of the other two zygnematophycean species examined here. Whether these apparently missing steps are catalyzed by proteins in the same superfamilies as those of extant land plants but are more distantly related, or whether they represent alternative biosynthetic routes to the same products, remains an open question.
To gain further insights into the molecular processes and adaptations that allow P. margaritaceum to tolerate the severe physiological challenges imposed by its ephemeral habitat, we conducted transcriptome profiling of responses to two archetypal terrestrial environmental factors associated with a terrestrial habitat, desiccation (DE) and high light (HL), as well as a combination of the two (HLDE). HL had no notable effect on cellular or chloroplast morphology, but DE, and to a lesser degree HLDE, induced asymmetric cell elongation and disruption of the characteristic lobed chloroplast architecture ( Figure 6 A). DE and HLDE treatments also caused substantial accumulation of starch in the chloroplast as well as the formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles, some of which showed evidence of autophagy ( Data S4 A). Starch degradation and biosynthesis have been observed as abiotic stress responses in different plant taxa ( Thalmann and Santelia, 2017 131. Thalmann, M. ∙ Santelia, D. Starch as a determinant of plant fitness under abiotic stress New Phytol. 2017; 214 :943-951 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in land plants, autophagy is associated with stress tolerance, recycling of organelles and macromolecules, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ( Signorelli et al., 2019 120. Signorelli, S. ∙ Tarkowski, L.P. ∙ Van den Ende, W. ... Linking autophagy to abiotic and biotic stress responses Trends Plant Sci. 2019; 24 :413-430 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A major structural and behavioral effect of all three treatments was production of large quantities of mucilage ( Figure 6 B). Many zygnematophycean algae secrete large amounts of extracellular polysaccharide mucilage through their cell walls, creating an extensive hydroscopic sheath. This material, also referred to as extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), has many functions that would provide an evolutionary advantage in semi-terrestrial habitats: anti-DE, a matrix for conjugation, a biofilm for communication with other microorganisms that might also facilitate HGT, and a propulsion mechanism where secretion from one pole of the cell allows directional gliding motility ( Domozych and Domozych, 2008 36. Domozych, D.S. ∙ Domozych, C.R. Desmids and biofilms of freshwater wetlands: development and microarchitecture Microb. Ecol. 2008; 55 :81-93 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mucilage production, which results in cell gliding behaviors ( Videos S1 and S2 ), increased substantially within a few minutes of applying the HL, DE, and HLDE treatments ( Figures 6 C and 6D; Data S4 B). Under DE and HLDE conditions, the EPS trails were more densely packed, leading to cell aggregation. This might be beneficial to an ephemeral alga whose short active growth period in the summer is defined by HL and drying conditions in shallow wetlands. The tight packing of EPS trails and cells would provide a means of enhancing water retention in a hydroscopic mass in desiccating environments.
Consistent with the degree of the morphological and cytological changes, transcriptome profiling of P. margaritaceum revealed a greater response to DE than to the other two treatments ( Figure 6 E; Data S4 C). Most of the DE-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 78% of the upregulated and 71% of the downregulated) were DE specific. HL had the least effect on transcript profiles, whereas combined treatment had an intermediate effect. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs ( Tables S2 A–S2F; Data S4 D) showed that the predominant categories of genes upregulated by all three treatments are related to carbohydrate metabolism. HL treatment caused induction of genes involved in central carbon metabolism, whereas photosynthesis-related pathways and associated chloroplast-related genes were significantly downregulated. This is consistent with suppression of photosynthesis to prevent cellular damage caused by HL-induced ROS, as occurs in land plants ( Rossel et al., 2007 116. Rossel, J.B. ∙ Wilson, P.B. ∙ Hussain, D. ... Systemic and intracellular responses to photooxidative stress in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2007; 19 :4091-4110 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). Complex networks of P. margaritaceum genes were identified as being regulated by DE or HL, including members of the GRAS family. This TF family had the greatest number of DEGs under DE (50 induced and 66 repressed), whereas none was differentially expressed under HL, indicating an ancestral role in abiotic stress responses. In addition, 20 of the 34 P. margaritaceum DREB TFs ( Data S2 D), which are only found in the Zygnematophyceae and land plants, were responsive to DE (5 upregulated and 15 downregulated), further suggesting a role in adaptations to increasingly terrestrial habitats.
One of the most prominent transcriptome responses was a major upregulation by DE of genes annotated as being involved in polysaccharide metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis ( Figure 6 F; Table S2 A). These include members of various GT classes, glycan synthases, and transglycosylases that function in the synthesis of diverse land plant cell wall polymers, including cellulose, xylan, and pectins. It might be expected that the transcriptome profiles reflect the biosynthesis of the mucilage that was induced in large quantities. An analysis of the polysaccharides in the mucilage secreted after HL or DE treatments ( Tables S3 A and S3B) revealed that they are quite distinct from those of the P. margaritaceum cell wall ( Sørensen et al., 2011 122. Sørensen, I. ∙ Pettolino, F.A. ∙ Bacic, A. ... The charophycean green algae provide insights into the early origins of plant cell walls Plant J. 2011; 68 :201-211 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and showed compositional differences in response to different treatments. These gene sets might provide useful targets for future studies of the biosynthesis and function of the mucilage polymers.
The transcriptome profiles also suggested that substantial cell wall remodeling occurred in response to DE. Large proportions of several of the families associated with cell wall loosening and degradation (48%, 77%, 68%, and 58% of GH28, PL, GH16, and expansin genes, respectively) were upregulated in DE-stressed cells. Congruent with upregulation of GH28 and PL pectinase genes, immunological analysis with a monoclonal antibody (JIM5) that recognizes the pectin polymer homogalacturonan (HG), showed that application of DE or HLDE stress caused major changes in the pectin architecture at the site of wall expansion at the isthmus zone ( Figure S3 A). This was confirmed by ultrastructural observations, which revealed that the HG lattice was significantly reduced, leaving the inner cellulosic wall layer ( Figures S3 B and S3C). This alteration most likely compromises the structural integrity of the wall, resulting in the unusual shapes of cells grown under these stress conditions. These results add to growing evidence that abiotic stresses such as DE cause remodeling of the cell wall in charophytes ( Herburger and Holzinger, 2015; Holzinger and Pichrtová, 2016 53. Herburger, K. ∙ Holzinger, A. Localization and quantification of callose in the streptophyte green algae Zygnema and Klebsormidium: correlation with desiccation tolerance Plant Cell Physiol. 2015; 56 :2259-2270 PubMed Google Scholar 55. Holzinger, A. ∙ Pichrtová, M. Abiotic stress tolerance of charophyte green algae: new challenges for omics techniques Front. Plant Sci. 2016; 7 :678 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ) and land plants ( Tenhaken, 2015 129. Tenhaken, R. Cell wall remodeling under abiotic stress Front. Plant Sci. 2015; 5 :771 Crossref Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). The major expansion of cell wall-modifying protein families in P. margaritaceum , together with their upregulation and turnover of their substrates in response to DE, highlights the importance of a structurally dynamic and robust primary cell wall under the changing osmotic conditions associated with habitats such as transient wetlands. The cell wall gene upregulation further suggests that these examples of wall modification are adaptive responses. These might be related to facilitating conjugation and mucilage secretion or specific changes in architecture that are biomechanically advantageous, but this remains to be determined. In this regard, the functions of specific cell wall genes can be addressed through transgenic approaches that have been developed for P. margaritaceum ( Sørensen et al., 2014 123. Sørensen, I. ∙ Fei, Z. ∙ Andreas, A. ... Stable transformation and reverse genetic analysis of Penium margaritaceum: a platform for studies of charophyte green algae, the immediate ancestors of land plants Plant J. 2014; 77 :339-351 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A previous study ( de Vries et al., 2018 30. de Vries, J. ∙ Curtis, B.A. ∙ Gould, S.B. ... Embryophyte stress signaling evolved in the algal progenitors of land plants Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E3471-E3480 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ) examined the effects of HL and cold stress on the transcriptomes of representatives of different streptophyte algal lineages. Direct comparisons of those results with outcomes of the HL and DE treatments reported here are limited by substantial differences in the treatment types, durations, and strengths. However, both sets of transcriptome data highlight the central role played by the plastid in diverse stress responses ( Tables S2 A, S2D, and S2E), and collectively they reveal distinct suites of genes that are regulated over hour-long versus multiple-day timescales. This lays the groundwork for future studies to elucidate the networks of short and longer-term adaptive responses to the multiple abiotic stresses inherent in terrestrialization.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Approximately 600 mya, a common ancestor of the modern-day Zygnematophyceae and Embryophyta evolved a set of traits that enabled the process of terrestrialization. This led to the colonization of interstitial environments, such as ephemeral freshwater pools that experience periodic DE, and true terrestrial habitats. Subsequent evolutionary “tuning” gave rise to the great diversity of land plants that has ultimately transformed the natural history and biogeochemistry of the planet. A long-standing question in plant biology is the nature of the key evolutionary novelties and the adaptive traits that allowed the first colonizers to survive the challenges of life on land; notably DE, UV radiation, and the need for biomechanical support. Answers lie in comparative studies of early-diverging land plant lineages and members of their sister group, the zygnematophycean algae.
The P. margaritaceum genome sequence has the hallmarks of a dynamic source of genetic innovation, with abundant TEs and the emergence or major expansion of gene families and regulatory systems that are associated with terrestrialization. These include a large compendium of regulatory TF families and components of phytohormone signaling networks that govern stress-induced changes in cell morphology and physiology. We also identified UV-absorbing flavonoid compounds and a range of land plant-like cellular responses to light and DE. The genome provides evidence of extensive machinery for synthesis, secretion, and remodeling of the polysaccharide cell wall, much of which originated prior to the ancestral land plant. This is exemplified by the substantially expanded repertoire of genes involved in the metabolism of pectins. These apparently ancient macromolecules contribute to cell expansion and cell differentiation as well as to the formation of the middle lamella that mediates intercellular adhesion, allowing tissue and organ formation in embryophytes ( Zamil and Geitmann, 2017; Cosgrove, 2014 25. Cosgrove, D.J. Re-constructing our models of cellulose and primary cell wall assembly Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2014; 22 :122-131 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar 145. Zamil, M.S. ∙ Geitmann, A. The middle lamella-more than a glue Phys. Biol. 2017; 14 :015004 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, although most terrestrial plant life requires more extensive deposition of hydrophobic biopolymers to reinforce the walls of specialized cells, the origins of their building blocks can increasingly be traced back to aquatic ancestors.
It is important to note that all zygnematophycean taxa are believed to be derived from multicellular ancestors ( Delwiche and Cooper, 2015 33. Delwiche, C.F. ∙ Cooper, E.D. The evolutionary origin of a terrestrial flora Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :R899-R910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the lineage today is represented by a diverse assemblage of both multicellular (i.e., filamentous forms) and unicellular (e.g., the desmids) taxa. The unicellular morphology of P. margaritaceum represents a major evolutionary secondary reduction that affords significant advantages to life in semi-aquatic or subaerial habitats. Small size, rapid cell division, simple conjugation-based sexual reproduction, and the ability to withstand DE-based stress, together with the synthetic machinery to secrete water-retaining mucilage, provide a more efficient means to survive in shallow wetlands than the multicellular body plans and complex reproductive strategies of other late-divergent charophytes.
It has been proposed that the common ancestor of land plants and the Zygnematophyceae might have acquired additional genetic capacity through HGT from soil bacteria ( Cheng et al., 2019 21. Cheng, S. ∙ Xian, W. ∙ Fu, Y. ... Genomes of subaerial Zygnematophyceae provide insights into land plant evolution Cell. 2019; 179 :1057-1067.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other mechanisms of major gene expansion are apparent in different lineages of the Zygnematophyceae, such as whole-genome triplication in S. muscicola ( Cheng et al., 2019 21. Cheng, S. ∙ Xian, W. ∙ Fu, Y. ... Genomes of subaerial Zygnematophyceae provide insights into land plant evolution Cell. 2019; 179 :1057-1067.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) and massive segmental duplication in P. margaritaceum . Importantly, the three zygnematophycean species compared here diverged deep within the lineage more than 500 mya, and since then, secondary losses and gains of traits have occurred as they adapted to their unique subaerial and/or semi-terrestrial habitats. Thus, although the genetic framework and structural and physiological features that set in motion one of the great transitions of life on Earth are coming into focus, sequencing of additional genomes will be necessary to elucidate the variation within the Zygnematophyceae and the nature of their last common ancestor with embryophytes.

Penium margaritaceum Brébisson (Skidmore isolate #8 of the Skidmore College Culture Collection - Texas) was isolated from shallow wetland, Saratoga Springs, NY, 12866, USA (Latitude 43.34N, Longitude 73.61W) and maintained in sterile 100 mL liquid cultures of Woods Hole (WH) medium ( Nichols, 1973 95. Nichols, H.W. Growth media-freshwater Stein, J.R. (Editor) Handbook of phycological methods: culture methods and growth measurements Cambridge University Press, New York, 1973; 39-78 Google Scholar ) supplemented with soil extract WHS obtained from Carolina Biological (North Carolina, USA), pH 7.2 at 18 ± 2°C in a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark with 74 μmol photons m −2 s −1 Photosynthetic Photon Flux of cool white fluorescent light. Subcultures were made every 10 days and 10- to 14-day-old cultures were used for all experiments.
For the control and high light (HL) treatments, cultures were maintained in 50 mL aliquots of WHS in sterile 150 × 15 mm plastic Petri dishes. Cultures (5 mL; 2,000 cells mL −1 ) were added to each dish, which was then sealed with surgical tape and placed under HL (150 μmol photons m −2 s −1 , 18 ± 2°C), or control (74 μmol photons m −2 s −1 , 18 ± 2°C) conditions. For the desiccation (DE) treatment, 150 × 15 mm plastic Petri dishes were filled with 50 mL of WHS containing 2% agarose (Sigma, USA) and allowed to cool. Two sterile 80-mm diameter cellulose sheets (AA Packaging, USA) were added to each plate and 1 mL of concentrated cell culture (~5,000 cells mL −1 ) was spread onto the sheets. The plates were then sealed and placed under control conditions or HL to produce high light plus desiccation (HLDE) conditions. Cells from the three treatments or the control were collected after 14 days by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min, the pellets washed three times by resuspension in sterile WHS, shaking and centrifugation, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. For DE experiments, the cells were scraped off the cellulose sheets and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Three biological replicates were performed for each treatment or control.
Cells grown in liquid culture under control or stress conditions were washed three times with WHS, centrifuged (400 × g for 1 min) and the cell pellet was gently resuspended in WHS (1,000 cells mL −1 ± 50). Samples (200 μL) were placed in the center of a single-welled polytetrafluoroethylene printed slide (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) and mixed with 50 μL of a 100 μg/mL solution of Fluoresbrite Plain YG 0.5 μm Microspheres, or with 0.5 μm Polybead Polystyrene Microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). The mixed suspensions were covered with a 22 × 22 mm glass coverslip and imaged with either light microscopy (LM; Olympus BX-60 or IX-83 equipped with both wide field fluorescence and differential interference contrast optics), or confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Olympus Fluoview 1200 CLSM). Single images or Free Run time lapse video clips were acquired with Olympus DP-73 cameras. For some experiments, the slides were placed in a moisture chamber comprising a glass Petri dish with a layer of wet filter paper. The chambers were placed under the control and HL conditions for various periods of time and then viewed with LM or CLSM. To image the mucilage in DE cultures, cell aggregates were removed from the surface of desiccation cultures, placed on the slides as above and a drop of 0.5 mg/mL Fluoresbrite bead solution was placed on the cell aggregate. The coverslip was then added and the slide viewed with LM or CLSM. To visualize starch, cell pellets were resuspended in growth medium and stained for 5 min with 1% v/v iodine then washed before imaging.

For scanning electron microscopy imaging (SEM), cells were collected by centrifugation, placed on nitrocellulose paper attached to a JEOL Cryostub (JEOL, USA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen then imaged with a JEOL 6480 LV SEM under low vacuum conditions (10 kv, spot size 30).
Cells were grown for 14 days in sterile 125-mL flasks containing 75 mL of WHS under the conditions described above. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA for Illumina RNA-Seq was extracted as previously described ( Wan and Wilkins, 1994 134. Wan, C.Y. ∙ Wilkins, T.A. A modified hot borate method significantly enhances the yield of high-quality RNA from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) Anal. Biochem. 1994; 223 :7-12 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and for Iso-Seq was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, USA). The quality of RNA was checked using an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent, USA). For genomic DNA extraction, nuclei were isolated from the cell pellets as described in Raimundo et al. (2018) 110.

Isolation and manipulation of protoplasts from the unicellular green alga Penium margaritaceum Plant Methods. 2018; 14 :18 Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar as this yielded far better-quality preparations. DNA quality was checked using a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and an Agilent BioAnalyzer (Agilent, USA).
Five paired-end genomic libraries were constructed, of which three were prepared with the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Prep kit, one with the Illumina Genomic DNA Sample Prep kit and one with the Kapa Hyper kit (Kapa Biosystem, USA). Three mate-pair libraries were constructed using the Illumina Nextera Mate Pair Library Prep kit with insert sizes ranging between 2-4 kb, 5-7 kb and 8-10 kb, respectively. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system in paired-end mode.
Strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries were constructed for stressed and control samples as previously described ( Zhong et al., 2011 150. Zhong, S. ∙ Joung, J.-G. ∙ Zheng, Y. ... High-throughput illumina strand-specific RNA sequencing library preparation Cold Spring Harb. Protoc. 2011; 2011 :940-949 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system in paired-end mode. The Iso-Seq library was constructed following the standard SMRT bell construction protocol (Pacific Biosciences, USA) and sequenced using two SMRT cells on the PacBio Sequel platform (v2.0 chemistry).
Long reads produced by the PacBio Sequel platform were processed using modules in the SMRTLink package (v5.1; PacBio), to generate full-length refined consensus isoforms. Circular consensus sequences (CCS) were obtained using the ‘ccs’ module with parameters “–minPredictedAccuracy=0.75, MinFullPasses =0 and–minLength=100.” CCS containing poly(A) signal, 5′ and 3′ adapters were then identified, and the adapters and poly(A) sequences were trimmed to create full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads. The retained FLNC reads were iteratively classified into clusters to build the consensus sequences, which were then polished by Quiver ( Chin et al., 2013 22. Chin, C.-S. ∙ Alexander, D.H. ∙ Marks, P. ... Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :563-569 Crossref Scopus (2263) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the minimum accuracy rate set to 0.99. Base errors in the polished isoforms were further corrected by Illumina RNA-Seq reads using LoRDEC v0.8 ( Salmela and Rivals, 2014 118. Salmela, L. ∙ Rivals, E. LoRDEC: accurate and efficient long read error correction Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :3506-3514 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ) with kmer length set to 19. The LoRDEC-corrected isoforms were used to reconstruct the coding regions of the P. margaritaceum genome using Cogent v3.5 ( https://github.com/Magdoll/Cogent ). To build gene clusters, all the isoforms were aligned to the P. margaritaceum coding genome (the collection of coding sequences generated by Cogent) by minimap2 with parameters “-ax splice -uf” ( Li, 2018 71. Li, H. Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3094-3100 Crossref Scopus (753) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the resulting alignments were then processed by cDNA_Cupcake ( https://github.com/Magdoll/cDNA_Cupcake ) to collapse isoforms.
Illumina RNA-Seq reads were processed with Trimmomatic v0.32 ( Bolger et al., 2014 11. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (14636) PubMed Google Scholar ) to remove adaptor and low-quality sequences. Reads aligned to the ribosomal RNA database ( Quast et al., 2013 109. Quast, C. ∙ Pruesse, E. ∙ Yilmaz, P. ... The SILVA ribosomal RNA gene database project: improved data processing and web-based tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D590-D596 Crossref Scopus (7141) PubMed Google Scholar ) were discarded. The remaining cleaned reads were subjected to Trinity ( Grabherr et al., 2011 50. Grabherr, M.G. ∙ Haas, B.J. ∙ Yassour, M. ... Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :644-652 Crossref Scopus (8987) PubMed Google Scholar ) for de novo assembly with the minimum kmer coverage set to two. To remove redundancy, Trinity assembled contigs were further clustered by iAssembler ( Zheng et al., 2011 148. Zheng, Y. ∙ Zhao, L. ∙ Gao, J. ... iAssembler: a package for de novo assembly of Roche-454/Sanger transcriptome sequences BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :453 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a sequence identity cutoff of 97%.
Genomic paired-end reads were processed to remove adaptors and low-quality bases using Trimmomatic v0.32 ( Bolger et al., 2014 11. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (14636) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters “TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10:1:TRUE SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 MINLEN:40.” Mate-pair reads were cleaned with the ShortRead package ( Morgan et al., 2009 89. Morgan, M. ∙ Anders, S. ∙ Lawrence, M. ... ShortRead: a bioconductor package for input, quality assessment and exploration of high-throughput sequence data Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2607-2608 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ) to remove the junction adaptor sequences and the trailing bases.
To assemble the genome, we first searched for optimal k-mer size. Since the P. margaritaceum genome is highly repetitive, large k-mer size can help resolve repetitive regions but with a trade-off of increasing the number of unique k-mers, which requires more computational resources. For P. margaritaceum genome assembly, memory efficiency was a major bottleneck for most of the popular assemblers we tried, including MaSuRCA ( Zimin et al., 2013 152. Zimin, A.V. ∙ Marçais, G. ∙ Puiu, D. ... The MaSuRCA genome assembler Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :2669-2677 Crossref Scopus (441) PubMed Google Scholar ), SPAdes ( Bankevich et al., 2012 4.

Biol. 2012; 19 :455-477 Crossref Scopus (8111) PubMed Google Scholar ), ALLPATHS-LG ( Gnerre et al., 2011 48. Gnerre, S. ∙ Maccallum, I. ∙ Przybylski, D. ... High-quality draft assemblies of mammalian genomes from massively parallel sequence data Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :1513-1518 Crossref Scopus (1051) PubMed Google Scholar ), ABYSS 2.0 ( Jackman et al., 2017 57. Jackman, S.D. ∙ Vandervalk, B.P. ∙ Mohamadi, H. ... ABySS 2.0: resource-efficient assembly of large genomes using a Bloom filter Genome Res. 2017; 27 :768-777 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) and w2rap-contigger ( Clavijo et al., 2017 23. Clavijo, B.J. ∙ Venturini, L. ∙ Schudoma, C. ... An improved assembly and annotation of the allohexaploid wheat genome identifies complete families of agronomic genes and provides genomic evidence for chromosomal translocations Genome Res. 2017; 27 :885-896 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). All of them failed after running days to weeks on a 1 Tb memory machine and some even failed on a 3 Tb memory cluster. The final genome assembly was generated by SOAPdenovo2 v2.04 ( Luo et al., 2012 81. Luo, R. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Xie, Y. ... SOAPdenovo2: an empirically improved memory-efficient short-read de novo assembler Gigascience. 2012; 1 :18 Crossref Scopus (2507) PubMed Google Scholar ) on a 1 Tb memory machine with kmer size set to 127. The redundant contigs were removed using BLASTn ( Camacho et al., 2009 16. Camacho, C. ∙ Coulouris, G. ∙ Avagyan, V. ... BLAST+: architecture and applications BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :421 Crossref Scopus (5797) PubMed Google Scholar ) (coverage ≥ 90% and identity ≥ 99%) and the remaining unique contigs were assembled into scaffolds using the built-in module of SOAPdenovo2, with all reads from the mate-pair and paired-end libraries (parameters ‘-F -u’). Gaps in the resulting scaffolds were filled using GapFiller v1-10 ( Nadalin et al., 2012 92. Nadalin, F. ∙ Vezzi, F. ∙ Policriti, A. GapFiller: a de novo assembly approach to fill the gap within paired reads BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13 :S8 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ) with all paired-end reads.
Additional steps were taken to improve the contiguity and gene space of the assembly. First, the genome was also assembled successfully by MEGAHIT v1.1.1-2-g02102e1 ( Li et al., 2015 74. Li, D. ∙ Liu, C.M. ∙ Luo, R. ... MEGAHIT: an ultra-fast single-node solution for large and complex metagenomics assembly via succinct de Bruijn graph Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1674-1676 Crossref Scopus (852) PubMed Google Scholar ) using discrete k-mer sizes (121, 139, 159, 179, 199, 219, 239 and 249). Although the overall quality of the MEGAHIT assembly (contig N50: 498bp; scaffold N50: 696 bp) was not better, some long contigs were used for further scaffolding or gap filling of the SOAPdenovo2 assembly. MEGAHIT contigs > 2 kb were used in a BLAST search against the SOAPdenovo2 assembly (identity > 99%; minimal HSP length > 100 bp). Gapped scaffolds uniquely spanned by MEGAHIT sequences were filled, or replaced if they were contained by MEGAHIT sequences. When one MEGAHIT contig was aligned to two SOAPdenovo2 scaffolds, and the two alignments in the MEGAHIT contig did not overlap, the SOAPdenovo2 scaffolds were joined with gaps (100 Ns) if the anchors were located on each contig at the termini and were ≥ 100 nucleotides. Second, the genome assembly was further improved with assistance of PacBio full-length transcripts and Illumina de novo assembled transcripts. The transcripts were aligned to the genome assembly using GMAP v2017-10-12 ( Wu and Watanabe 2005 140. Wu, T.D. ∙ Watanabe, C.K. GMAP: a genomic mapping and alignment program for mRNA and EST sequences Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :1859-1875 Crossref Scopus (1051) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters “–min-identity=0.95–max-intronlength-middle 50000 -L 100000.” If a transcript was uniquely mapped to two scaffolds and the alignments met the following criteria, the two scaffolds were joined with gaps (100 Ns): a) individual alignment length > 100 bp; b) total alignments should cover > 80% of the transcript; and c) alignments on the scaffolds should be located within 5 kb of the closest terminus. Consequently, 3,971 scaffolds (∼111 Mb) were successfully connected. Lastly, transcripts not covered by the SOAPdenovo2 assembly but with solid homologs in the NCBI protein database were mapped to the MEGAHIT assembly, and the aligned MEGAHIT contigs, if not redundant, were added to the SOAPdenovo2 assembly.
To correct base errors in the assembly, the variants were called with all paired-end reads. Briefly, cleaned reads were aligned to the assembly using BWA 0.7.15-r1140 ( Li and Durbin 2009 72. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (18571) PubMed Google Scholar ) and valid alignments (mapping quality ≥ 40; properly paired) were used for SNP calling by FreeBayes v1.2.0 ( Garrison and Marth 2012 47. Garrison, E. ∙ Marth, G. Haplotype-based variant detection from short-read sequencing arXiv. 2012; arXiv:1207.3907 https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3907 Google Scholar ) with parameters “-q 0 -F 0.2 -p 1.” The variants were filtered by BCFtools ( Narasimhan et al., 2016 93. Narasimhan, V. ∙ Danecek, P. ∙ Scally, A. ... BCFtools/RoH: a hidden Markov model approach for detecting autozygosity from next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :1749-1751 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the stringent criteria “QUAL>30 & TYPE='snp' & AO/DP >0.5 & DP≥30 & DP≤300 & MQM>30 & SAF>1 & SAR>1 & RPR>1 & RPL>1.” The resulting high-confidence variants were used for base correction of the assembly. The assembly was further checked for redundancy as described above. Scaffolds with BLASTn hits (E-value < 1e-5) from non-eukaryotic organisms were manually examined to exclude contamination.
To assess the quality of the assembled genome, Illumina genomic and RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the assembly with Bowtie 2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 68. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (16135) PubMed Google Scholar ) and STAR v2.1 ( Dobin et al., 2013 35. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (9538) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. K-mer based analysis were carried out with KAT V2.4.1 ( Mapleson et al., 2017 84. Mapleson, D. ∙ Garcia Accinelli, G. ∙ Kettleborough, G. ... KAT: a K-mer analysis toolkit to quality control NGS datasets and genome assemblies Bioinformatics. 2017; 33 :574-576 Crossref Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). Completeness of gene-space representation was evaluated using BUSCO ( Simão et al., 2015 121. Simão, F.A. ∙ Waterhouse, R.M. ∙ Ioannidis, P. ... BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness with single-copy orthologs Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3210-3212 Crossref Scopus (2893) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the ‘Eukaryota odb9’ dataset.
Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were identified from the P. margaritaceum genome assembly using LTRharvest v1.5.9 ( Ellinghaus et al., 2008 41. Ellinghaus, D. ∙ Kurtz, S. ∙ Willhoeft, U. LTRharvest, an efficient and flexible software for de novo detection of LTR retrotransposons BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9 :18 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters ‘-minlenltr 100 -maxlenltr 6000 -mindistltr 1500 -maxdistltr 25000 -mintsd 5 -maxtsd 5 -motif tgca -vic 10’) and LTRdigest ( Steinbiss et al., 2009 126. Steinbiss, S. ∙ Willhoeft, U. ∙ Gremme, G. ... Fine-grained annotation and classification of de novo predicted LTR retrotransposons Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37 :7002-7013 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), and miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs) were identified using MITE-Hunter v11-2011 ( Han and Wessler, 2010 52. Han, Y. ∙ Wessler, S.R. MITE-Hunter: a program for discovering miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements from genomic sequences Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38 :e199 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameter ‘-n 30’. The identified LTRs and MITEs were used to mask the P. margaritaceum genome using RepeatMasker (v4.0.7; http://www.repeatmasker.org ), and the unmasked genomic sequences were analyzed by RepeatModeler (v1.0.11; http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html ) to identify novel transposable elements (TEs). All identified repeat sequences were searched against the Swiss-Prot database ( https://www.uniprot.org:443/ ) using BLASTx with an E-value cutoff of 1e-10, and repeats matching non-TE proteins in the database were excluded. To annotate the repeats, we used a modified approach similar to that implemented in the RepeatClassifier module of RepeatModeler. First, we ran the RepeatClassifier on all identified repeats to get a summary statistic of BLASTx matches against a TE protein dataset provided by RepeatMasker. Repeats were categorized based on the classification of best hits (E-value < 1e-3 and alignment length > 150 nucleotides or 50 residues). The unclassified repeats were scanned by RepeatMasker with all eukaryotic TEs from the Repbase database ( Bao et al., 2015 6. Bao, W. ∙ Kojima, K.K. ∙ Kohany, O. Repbase Update, a database of repetitive elements in eukaryotic genomes Mob. DNA. 2015; 6 :11 Crossref Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ) (version 20170127). Best hits, with alignments > 200 nucleotides, were kept for TE family assignment. Simple repeat annotation was performed with an independent run of the TRF program v 4.09 with parameters: “2 7 7 80 10 50 2000 -h -f -d -m 1 -l 10” ( Benson, 1999 9. Benson, G. Tandem repeats finder: a program to analyze DNA sequences Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27 :573-580 Crossref Scopus (3910) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Full-length LTR sequences were aligned with MAFFT v7.313 ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 61. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (12620) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters: “–maxiterate 1000–localpair,” and the genetic distance was estimated using the EMBOSS distmat program ( Rice et al., 2000 115. Rice, P. ∙ Longden, I. ∙ Bleasby, A. EMBOSS: the European molecular biology open software suite Trends Genet. 2000; 16 :276-277 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the Kimura method. The insertion time ( T ) of the LTR retrotransposons was calculated according to the formula T = K /2 r , where K is the genetic distance and r is the nucleotide substitution rate, which was estimated to be 7.0 × 10 −9 substitutions per site per year in A. thaliana ( Ossowski et al., 2010 99.

Protein-coding genes were predicted from the P. margaritaceum genome using the MAKER-P pipeline v2.31.10 ( Campbell et al., 2014 17. Campbell, M.S. ∙ Law, M. ∙ Holt, C. ...

Three ab initio predictors, GeneMark-ES v3.51 ( Lomsadze et al., 2005 78. Lomsadze, A. ∙ Ter-Hovhannisyan, V. ∙ Chernoff, Y.O. ... Gene identification in novel eukaryotic genomes by self-training algorithm Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :6494-6506 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ), SNAP v2006-07-28 ( Korf, 2004 67. Korf, I. Gene finding in novel genomes BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5 :59 Crossref Scopus (979) PubMed Google Scholar ) and AUGUSTUS v3.3 ( Stanke et al., 2006 125. Stanke, M. ∙ Tzvetkova, A. ∙ Morgenstern, B. AUGUSTUS at EGASP: using EST, protein and genomic alignments for improved gene prediction in the human genome Genome Biol. 2006; 7 :S11.1-S11.8 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), were incorporated in the MAKER-P pipeline. Proteomes of 18 plant species across the Viridiplantae were used to identify protein homology. To prepare the transcript evidence, RNA-Seq reads were assembled using Trinity v2.6.6 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 50. Grabherr, M.G. ∙ Haas, B.J. ∙ Yassour, M. ... Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :644-652 Crossref Scopus (8987) PubMed Google Scholar ) under both de novo and genome-guided modes. The two resulting assemblies, as well as an additional source of transcript structures obtained from StringTie v1.3.3b ( Pertea et al., 2015 104. Pertea, M. ∙ Pertea, G.M. ∙ Antonescu, C.M. ... StringTie enables improved reconstruction of a transcriptome from RNA-seq reads Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1723) PubMed Google Scholar ), which used RNA-Seq alignments to the P. margaritaceum genome by HISAT2 v2.1 ( Kim et al., 2015 63. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (4116) PubMed Google Scholar ), were supplied to the PASA pipeline v2.2.0 ( Haas et al., 2003 51. Haas, B.J. ∙ Delcher, A.L. ∙ Mount, S.M. ... Improving the Arabidopsis genome annotation using maximal transcript alignment assemblies Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31 :5654-5666 Crossref Scopus (636) PubMed Google Scholar ) to build a comprehensive transcriptome assembly. Protein-coding regions of the PASA assembly were predicted by TransDecoder ( https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki ) and confirmed through homology search against the Pfam ( Bateman et al., 2004 7. Bateman, A. ∙ Coin, L. ∙ Durbin, R. ... The Pfam protein families database Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :D138-D141 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and Uniref ( Suzek et al., 2015 128. Suzek, B.E. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Huang, H. ..., UniProt Consortium UniRef clusters: a comprehensive and scalable alternative for improving sequence similarity searches Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :926-932 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ) protein databases. PASA predicted gene structures were used as a training set for AUGUSTUS and also served as an independent prediction considered by the MAKER-P pipeline. The Trinity assemblies, combined with 29,220 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the NCBI nucleotide database, were fed to the MAKER-P pipeline as transcript evidence.
The final MAKER-P gene models were compared to the Pfam database to exclude those containing TE-related domains. Genes with expression value RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads) ≥ 1 in combined RNA-Seq data or having at least one valid hit in the nr, Pfam, InterPro, or PANTHER databases were classified as high-confidence genes, whereas the rest of the predicted genes were grouped into a low-confidence gene set.
To further improve gene completeness, a master gene set was created by incorporating PacBio full-length transcripts and Trinity assembled transcripts into the high-confidence (HC) gene set. Transcript sequences were subjected to SeqClean ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/seqclean ) for polyA tail trimming and rRNA sequence removal. Coding regions of the transcripts were identified by TransDecoder, and only those with coding sequences > 90 nucleotides were kept. CD-HIT ( Fu et al., 2012 46. Fu, L. ∙ Niu, B. ∙ Zhu, Z. ... CD-HIT: accelerated for clustering the next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :3150-3152 Crossref Scopus (2228) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to cluster the coding sequences to remove redundancies. Coding sequences of Trinity assembled transcripts were removed if they shared > 90% identity with Iso-Seq isoforms. The remaining coding sequences were mapped to the P. margaritaceum genome using GMAP ( Wu and Watanabe 2005 140. Wu, T.D. ∙ Watanabe, C.K. GMAP: a genomic mapping and alignment program for mRNA and EST sequences Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :1859-1875 Crossref Scopus (1051) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters “-n 0 -z sense force.” According to the alignments, HC genes predicted from the P. margaritaceum genome were replaced with corresponding coding transcripts if all the following criteria were met: a) alignment between the transcript and the HC gene covered > 80% of the HC coding region; b) the length of coding sequence of the transcript was at least 1.1 times of that of the HC gene; c) length of the transcript coding sequence should not exceed 1.5 times of the average length of the top 10 protein homologs in the GenBank non-redundant (nr) database (to avoid chimeric transcripts); and d) the transcript in question contained the longest coding sequence in the locus.
Some transcripts did not align to the genome or the alignments were located in intergenic regions. To identify likely protein-coding genes from these transcripts, we assessed their coding potential using CPC ( Kong et al., 2007 66. Kong, L. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ye, Z.-Q. ... CPC: assess the protein-coding potential of transcripts using sequence features and support vector machine Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W345-9 Crossref Scopus (1080) PubMed Google Scholar ) and discarded those annotated as non-coding transcripts. We also excluded the remaining transcripts without any protein homologs in Viridiplantae species, and those whose predicted protein sequences were considered to be too long (≥1.5 times the average length of their homologs) or too short (≤0.5 times the average length of their homologs). In addition, transcripts encoding TE-related Pfam domains were removed. For the remaining transcripts, we only included the longest transcript for each locus into the master gene set.
To annotate genes in the master list, their protein sequences were compared to the GenBank nr database, the A. thaliana proteome and the UniProt database using BLASTp with an E-value cutoff of 1e-5. The protein sequences were also compared to the InterPro database using InterProScan v5.29-68.0 ( Jones et al., 2014 58. Jones, P. ∙ Binns, D. ∙ Chang, H.-Y. ... InterProScan 5: genome-scale protein function classification Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1236-1240 Crossref Scopus (2286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene ontology (GO) annotations were obtained using Blast2GO v5.2.4 ( Götz et al., 2008 49. Götz, S. ∙ García-Gómez, J.M. ∙ Terol, J. ... High-throughput functional annotation and data mining with the Blast2GO suite Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36 :3420-3435 Crossref Scopus (2145) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the BLASTp results from the GenBank nr database and output from the InterProScan. Functional descriptions were integrated and assigned to the genes using AHRD (v3.3.3; https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD ). Enzyme Commission (EC) information was acquired from the Blast2GO analysis. Pathway analysis was performed using the online annotation server BlastKOALA ( Kanehisa et al., 2016 60. Kanehisa, M. ∙ Sato, Y. ∙ Morishima, K. BlastKOALA and GhostKOALA: KEGG tools for functional characterization of genome and metagenome sequences J. Mol.

Araport11: a complete reannotation of the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome Plant J. 2017; 89 :789-804 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), were included for comparative genomics analysis ( Figure 3 A). Orthologous groups among these species were built using OrthoMCL v2.0.9 ( Li et al., 2003 73. Li, L. ∙ Stoeckert, Jr., C.J. ∙ Roos, D.S. OrthoMCL: identification of ortholog groups for eukaryotic genomes Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2178-2189 Crossref Scopus (3295) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameters “E-value < 1e-5; alignment coverage > 40%; inflation value 1.5.” To infer the species phylogeny, we retrieved sequences from low-copy orthologous groups, defined as those with ≤ 3 gene copies in each species and at most two species with multi-copy genes, or missing genes. This yielded a total of 410 orthologous groups. Each orthologous group was aligned separately using MAFFT with the linsi strategy ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 61. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (12620) PubMed Google Scholar ) and gaps in the alignment were trimmed using trimAl ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 19. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (2548) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameter “-automated1.” A Maximum likelihood phylogeny was inferred by IQ-TREE ( Nguyen et al., 2015 94. Nguyen, L.-T. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... IQ-TREE: a fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32 :268-274 Crossref Scopus (4058) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v1.6.7) with concatenated alignments and the best-fitting model LG+F+I+G4, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Molecular dating was carried out by MCMCTree in the PAML package version 4.9h ( Yang, 2007 141. Yang, Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24 :1586-1591 Crossref Scopus (6299) PubMed Google Scholar ). The divergence time of Angiospermae (246.6-195.4 Mya), Tracheophyta (450.8-430.4 Mya), Embryophyta (515.5-469.0 Mya), Streptophyta (875.4-637.4 Mya) and Viridiplantae (968.0-676.7 Mya) were used as calibration points according to Morris et al. (2018) 90. Morris, J.L. ∙ Puttick, M.N. ∙ Clark, J.W. ... The timescale of early land plant evolution Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E2274-E2283 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar . We repeated molecular dating by applying ten different combinations of any two of the calibration points and derived the mean and standard error of divergence time at each node from the replicates ( Table S1 E). For gene family evolution analysis, we used 11,904 orthologous groups with genes present in at least two algal species and two land plants. Modeling of gene family size was performed by CAFE ( De Bie et al., 2006 27. De Bie, T. ∙ Cristianini, N. ∙ Demuth, J.P. ... CAFE: a computational tool for the study of gene family evolution Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :1269-1271 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v4.2) and the gene birth and death rate (λ) was estimated with orthologous groups that were conserved in at least 17 (out of 18) species. Orthologous groups with family-wide p < 0.05 were defined as rapidly evolving gene families whereas, the Viterbi p (< 0.05) was used to identify branches with gene families significantly expanded or contracted compared with their last common ancestor.
WGD can be inferred from the Ks (synonymous substitution rate) values of paralogous genes ( Vanneste et al., 2013 132. Vanneste, K. ∙ Van de Peer, Y. ∙ Maere, S. Inference of genome duplications from age distributions revisited Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :177-190 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore possible WGD in P. margaritaceum , we calculated Ks for each pair of P. margaritaceum genes within the same orthologous groups. Ks values > 2 were excluded from the analysis due to saturation. We fitted the Ks values with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) implemented in mclust R package ( Scrucca et al., 2016 119. Scrucca, L. ∙ Fop, M. ∙ Murphy, T.B. ... mclust 5: Clustering, classification and density estimation using Gaussian finite mixture models R J. 2016; 8 :289-317 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify possible WGD signatures. GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes all the data points are generated from a mixture of a number of Gaussian distributions with unknown components. However, model selection on the optimal number of GMM components is prone to overfitting, so we performed significant zero crossing (SiZer) and significant convexity (SiCon) analysis implemented in the R package ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/feature/index.html ) to check the authenticity of the components at a significance level of 0.05.
The transcription factors, transcriptional regulators and protein kinases in P . margaritaceum and other selected species were identified and classified based on the rules of the iTAK pipeline v1.7 ( Zheng et al., 2016 149. Zheng, Y. ∙ Jiao, C. ∙ Sun, H. ... iTAK: a program for genome-wide prediction and classification of plant transcription factors, transcriptional regulators, and protein kinases Mol. Plant. 2016; 9 :1667-1670 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify homologous genes, protein sequences from P. margaritaceum and other selected species were searched against A. thaliana protein database using BLASTp (E-value ≤ 1e-5 and coverage of A. thaliana genes ≥ 30%), and genes with the best hit to the targeted A. thaliana genes or their potential paralogs, which were defined by BLASTp under the criteria of E-value ≤ 1e-5 and reciprocal coverage ≥ 35%, were preserved as candidate homologous genes. For some gene families, the homologs were identified based on the specific protein domains that were searched by HMMER3 ( Mistry et al., 2013 88. Mistry, J. ∙ Finn, R.D. ∙ Eddy, S.R. ... Challenges in homology search: HMMER3 and convergent evolution of coiled-coil regions Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e121 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ) with parameter “–cut-ga,” or classified based on the iTAK results ( http://itak.feilab.net/ ; specified in Table S1 J). For hormone pathway genes, protein sequences of all the A. thaliana genes as well as the homolog candidates in other species were aligned using MAFFT with the linsi strategy ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 61. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (12620) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the maximum likelihood phylogeny for each family was constructed by IQ-TREE ( Nguyen et al., 2015 94. Nguyen, L.-T. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... IQ-TREE: a fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32 :268-274 Crossref Scopus (4058) PubMed Google Scholar ) with automatic model selection and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The final homologs were inferred from the built phylogeny of individual gene families.
The CAZY families were identified using dbCAN2 ( Zhang et al., 2018 147. Zhang, H. ∙ Yohe, T. ∙ Huang, L. ... dbCAN2: a meta server for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W95-W101 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ), and unless indicated the default thresholds (E-value < 1e-15 and coverage > 35%) were used to delineate each gene family.
BLASTp was used to search the proteomes of P. margaritaceum , M. endlicherianum , S. muscicola , C. braunii , K. nitens , C. atmophyticus and M. viride with sequences from a GH16 sequence database ( http://bioinfo.bti.cornell.edu/lab/GH16.fasta.gz ) as queries, including laminarinases, agarases, porphyranases, carrageenases, MLGases, chitin transglycosylases, EG16s and XTHs. The resulting sequences were analyzed manually and candidates were analyzed using SignalP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ ) and TargetP ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/ ), and compared to the NCBI conserved domain database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi ). The identified GH16s were also aligned with other GH16 sequences and the presence of conserved EG16 and XTH motifs was noted. For the GH16 phylogeny, several representatives of each GH16 group were aligned with all non-fragment P. margaritaceum sequences (n = 41), M. endlicherianum (n = 6), S. muscicola (n = 17), C. braunii (n = 6), K. nitens (n = 12), C. atmophyticus (n = 5) and M. viride (n = 1) sequences and GH7 cellulases (as the outgroup), then trimmed. To generate the tree, RAxML-HPC2 ( Stamatakis 2014 124. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (12231) PubMed Google Scholar ) on XSEDE was used on the CIPRES portal ( http://www.phylo.org ), with the JTT amino acid substitution model, which ran for 360 rapid bootstraps.
The protein structure of Arabidopsis ARF1 (PDB accession number 4LDX ) was used as the template for structure modeling of P. margaritaceum ARF proteins using SWISS-MODEL ( Waterhouse et al., 2018 137. Waterhouse, A. ∙ Bertoni, M. ∙ Bienert, S. ... SWISS-MODEL: homology modelling of protein structures and complexes Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W296-W303 Crossref Scopus (1867) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. The target and template sequences were aligned using MAFFT with the linsi strategy and the protein structure was visualized using Chimera (version 1.13.1) ( Pettersen et al., 2004 105. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (19985) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cleaned RNA-Seq reads were used to quantify expression of P. margaritaceum master genes in each sample using Salmon v0.9.1 (quasi mode; -k 31) ( Patro et al., 2017 103. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (1349) PubMed Google Scholar ). Raw counts were normalized to fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments (FPKM). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treated and control samples were identified using the DESeq2 package ( Love et al., 2014 79. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (14606) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01 and fold-change > 2 were considered to be DEGs. GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed using BiNGO ( Maere et al., 2005 83. Maere, S. ∙ Heymans, K. ∙ Kuiper, M. BiNGO: a Cytoscape plugin to assess overrepresentation of gene ontology categories in biological networks Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :3448-3449 Crossref Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Flavonoids were extracted from P. margaritaceum cell culture pellets according to Ye et al. (2015) 142. Ye, J. ∙ Hu, T. ∙ Yang, C. ... Transcriptome profiling of tomato fruit development reveals transcription factors associated with ascorbic acid, carotenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0130885 PubMed Google Scholar . Freeze-dried samples were homogenized with a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN), extracted overnight at 4°C with 80% methanol then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was retained and the pellet re-extracted with 80% methanol for 1 h and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were pooled and dried using a speed-vac then reconstituted in 120 μL of solvent (40 μL MeOH + 80 μL H2O) prior to analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using a Thermo Scientific Vanquish UHPLC system (mobile phase A, water with 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase B, methanol with 0.1% formic acid), with a Thermo Scientific Hypersil Gold column (2.1 × 150mm, 1.9μm) operating at 45°C with a flow rate of 200 μL min −1 . Separation of compounds was carried out with gradient elution profile: 0 min, A:B 99.5:0.5; 1 min, A:B 90:10; 10 min, A:B 70:30, 18 min, A:B 50:50, 22 min, A:B 1:99; total 30 min. The injection volume was 2 μL.
MS and MS n data were collected with a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid mass spectrometer. Flavonoids were identified using the automated iterative precursor exclusion method of the Acquire X workflow (four iterative runs of the pooled sample). The MS 2 (30 K FWHM at m/z 200) spectra were collected for precursor ions detected in the survey MS scan within a 1.2 s cycle time. Higher order MS n (3–4) (30 K FWHM at m/z 200) spectra were collected only when the instrument detected the sugar neutral loss based on MS 2 and/or MS 3 data. Flavonoids were identified and annotated by searching MS n tree raw data files against mzCloud spectra library using Mass Frontier 8.0. The identified list (full or partial MS n spectral tree data matching MS n spectra of flavonoid references in the mzCloud library) plus an existing database with 6,549 flavonoid structures were used for database search in Compound Discoverer 3.1 software (Thermo Scientific). The putative identified flavonoids by were further analyzed for structure annotation by the FISh ranking tool (Mass Frontier 8.0).
Mucilage (EPS) was isolated from cultures as described in Domozych et al. (2005) 37. Domozych, D.S. ∙ Kort, S. ∙ Benton, S. ... The extracellular polymeric substance of the green alga Penium margaritaceum and its role in biofilm formation Biofilms. 2005; 2 :129-144 Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar and freeze-dried. Polysaccharide composition and linkage analyses were performed by the carbohydrate analytical service of the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia ( https://www.ccrc.uga.edu/services ).
