Section: Abstract

Voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.5 generates cardiac action potentials and initiates the heartbeat. Here, we report structures of Na V 1.5 at 3.2–3.5 Å resolution. Na V 1.5 is distinguished from other sodium channels by a unique glycosyl moiety and loss of disulfide-bonding capability at the Na V β subunit-interaction sites. The antiarrhythmic drug flecainide specifically targets the central cavity of the pore. The voltage sensors are partially activated, and the fast-inactivation gate is partially closed. Activation of the voltage sensor of Domain III allows binding of the isoleucine-phenylalanine-methionine (IFM) motif to the inactivation-gate receptor. Asp and Ala, in the selectivity motif DEKA, line the walls of the ion-selectivity filter, whereas Glu and Lys are in positions to accept and release Na + ions via a charge-delocalization network. Arrhythmia mutation sites undergo large translocations during gating, providing a potential mechanism for pathogenic effects. Our results provide detailed insights into Na v 1.5 structure, pharmacology, activation, inactivation, ion selectivity, and arrhythmias.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Cardiac sodium channels generate the up-stroke of the cardiac action potential by activating rapidly in response to membrane depolarization and conducting Na + inward across the membrane ( Catterall and Maier, 2015 12. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Maier, S.K.G. Voltage-gated sodium channels and the electrical excitability of the heart Zipes, D.J. ∙ Jalife, J. (Editors) Cardiac Electrophysiology: From Bench to Bedside Saunders/Elsevier, 2015 Google Scholar ). The rate of rise of the action potential, which depends on rapid activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, controls the rate and homogeneity of propagation of the action potential through cardiac tissue ( Catterall and Maier, 2015 12. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Maier, S.K.G. Voltage-gated sodium channels and the electrical excitability of the heart Zipes, D.J. ∙ Jalife, J. (Editors) Cardiac Electrophysiology: From Bench to Bedside Saunders/Elsevier, 2015 Google Scholar ). Voltage-gated sodium channel 1.5 (Na v 1.5) is the predominant sodium channel expressed in myocardial cells ( Fozzard and Hanck, 1996; Rogart et al., 1989 22. Fozzard, H.A. ∙ Hanck, D.A. Structure and function of voltage-dependent sodium channels: comparison of brain II and cardiac isoforms Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76 :887-926 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar 69.

USA. 1989; 86 :8170-8174 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dysfunction of Na V 1.5 owing to mutations or pathophysiological conditions causes life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias ( Liu et al., 2003b 47. Liu, H. ∙ Clancy, C. ∙ Cormier, J. ... Mutations in cardiac sodium channels: clinical implications Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 2003; 3 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), which are terminated and prevented by treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs ( Sampson and Kass, 2011 71. Sampson, K.J. ∙ Kass, R.K. Antiarrhythmic Drugs Brunton, L. ∙ Chabner, B.A. ∙ Knollman, B. (Editors) Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics McGraw-Hill, 2011; 815-848 Google Scholar ). Although other voltage-gated sodium channels are expressed in the heart, they are unable to compensate for dysfunction of Na V 1.5, which highlights the importance of this sodium channel in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.
Voltage-gated sodium channels in eukaryotes consist of a high molecular weight pore-forming α-subunit of ∼2,000 amino acid residues containing four homologous domains ( D I– D IV) ( Catterall, 1984, 2000; Noda et al., 1984 10.

Primary structure of Electrophorus electricus sodium channel deduced from cDNA sequence Nature. 1984; 312 :121-127 Crossref Scopus (1048) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each domain of the α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane helices organized in two functional modules. The first four segments (S1–S4) form the voltage-sensing module (VS), whereas the last 2 segments (S5 and S6) and a P loop between them form the pore module (PM). The VS and PM are connected by the α-helical S4-S5 linker. The intracellular linker connecting D III and D IV serves as the fast inactivation gate, which closes the pore within 1–2 ms after opening. In contrast, prokaryotic sodium channels are composed of four identical subunits, which are similar in structure to one domain of the eukaryotic α-subunits, and there is no structural equivalent of the fast inactivation gate ( Payandeh et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2001 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Ren, D. ∙ Navarro, B. ∙ Xu, H. ... A prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel Science. 2001; 294 :2372-2375 Crossref Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Most eukaryotic sodium channels contain one or two auxiliary β-subunits ( Isom et al., 1994; O’Malley and Isom, 2015 36. Isom, L.L. ∙ De Jongh, K.S. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated ion channels Neuron. 1994; 12 :1183-1194 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar 59. O’Malley, H.A. ∙ Isom, L.L. Sodium channel β subunits: emerging targets in channelopathies Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :481-504 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). β1 and β3 bind to the α-subunit by noncovalent interactions, whereas β2 and β4 are linked by a disulfide bond. The β-subunits are composed of an extracellular Ig-like domain and a single transmembrane segment. They regulate channel voltage dependence, gating kinetics, cell-surface localization, and density.
High-resolution crystal structures of bacterial sodium channels and cryoelectron microscopic (cryo-EM) structures of eukaryotic sodium channels from nerve and skeletal muscle reveal similar architectures ( Catterall et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2018, 2019; Payandeh et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2019 13. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Zheng, N. The chemical basis for electrical signaling Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :455-463 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar 60.

The central pore is formed by the PMs of the four subunits or domains. The four VSs are positioned on the periphery of the PM in approximately square symmetry, and they are activated in these structures, placing the S4 segment containing the gating charges in an outward position. We used voltage-shifting mutations and disulfide crosslinking to trap the resting state of the bacterial sodium channel Na V Ab at 0 mV and determined its structure by cryo-EM ( Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 88. Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ McCord, E. ... Resting-state structure and gating mechanism of a voltage-gated sodium channel Cell. 2019; 178 :993-1003.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Major changes in the conformation of the VS, the S4-S5 linker, and the intracellular activation gate were observed. These studies have given important insights into the structure and function of sodium channels.
To discover the key structural features of Na V 1.5 and relate them to the structural basis for its physiological function and its dysfunction in cardiac arrhythmias, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of the rat Na v 1.5 α-subunit at 3.2–3.5 Å resolution. Our experiments provide a blueprint for understanding cardiac sodium channel structure, pharmacology, activation, inactivation, sodium selectivity, and disease mutations.

Section: Results, Discussion, Conclusion

Na V 1.5 is composed of ∼2,000 amino acid residues with large intracellular N and C termini and large intracellular segments that connect the four domains ( Catterall et al., 2017; Fozzard and Hanck, 1996; Rogart et al., 1989 13. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Zheng, N. The chemical basis for electrical signaling Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :455-463 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Fozzard, H.A. ∙ Hanck, D.A. Structure and function of voltage-dependent sodium channels: comparison of brain II and cardiac isoforms Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76 :887-926 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Rogart, R.B. ∙ Cribbs, L.L. ∙ Muglia, L.K. ... Molecular cloning of a putative tetrodotoxin-resistant rat heart Na + channel isoform Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :8170-8174 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). These intracellular segments, which are predicted to be structurally flexible, were not observed in previous cryo-EM structures of sodium channels ( Pan et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2017, 2019 60. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.4 in complex with β1 Science. 2018; 362 :eaau2486 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Shen, H. ∙ Zhou, Q. ∙ Pan, X. ... Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution Science. 2017; 355 :eaal4326 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar 74. Shen, H. ∙ Liu, D. ∙ Wu, K. ... Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to optimize expression and homogeneity of rat Na v 1.5, constructs with truncated N and C termini and shortened inter-domain linkers were screened by expression as fusion proteins with GFP and detection by fluorescence size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) ( Goehring et al., 2014 25. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (433) PubMed Google Scholar ). Constructs were selected that have combined truncations and deletions, improved homogeneity and expression, and high voltage-activated Na + conductance. One of these Na V 1.5 constructs with deletions in DI-DII (Leu462-Gly658), DII-DIII (Ser1069-Pro1189), and the C terminus (Leu1898-Val2019) was selected for further electrophysiological and structural studies.
This well-structured core transmembrane construct of rat Na V 1.5 (rNa v 1.5 C ) was expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and analyzed by whole-cell voltage clamp ( Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012 92. Yarov-Yarovoy, V. ∙ DeCaen, P.G. ∙ Westenbroek, R.E. ... Structural basis for gating charge movement in the voltage sensor of a sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E93-E102 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ; STAR Methods ). These recordings revealed typical inward sodium currents in response to depolarizing stimuli ( Figure S1 A). Proteolytic cleavage of cytoplasmic loops shifts activation curves of mammalian sodium channels negatively ( Bennett, 2001 7. Bennett, E.S. Channel cytoplasmic loops alter voltage-dependent sodium channel activation in an isoform-specific manner J. Physiol. 2001; 535 :371-381 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, we found that rNa v 1.5 C has a substantial negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation (−50 mV) compared to native rat Na v 1.5, suggesting that activated/inactivated states are favored ( Figure S1 A).
rNa v 1.5 C was expressed at high levels in the cell line HEK293S GnTI − , which limits N-linked glycosylation ( Reeves et al., 2002 67. Reeves, P.J. ∙ Callewaert, N. ∙ Contreras, R. ... Structure and function in rhodopsin: high-level expression of rhodopsin with restricted and homogeneous N-glycosylation by a tetracycline-inducible N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-negative HEK293S stable mammalian cell line Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :13419-13424 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). After solubilization, affinity purification, and two rounds of size-exclusion chromatography, a peak of protein containing only the 230-kDa rNa V 1.5 C α subunit was collected for structural studies ( Figures S1 D and S1E). Detailed descriptions of protein expression, purification, cryo-EM imaging, and data processing are presented in STAR Methods .
We imaged rNa v 1.5 C by cryo-EM ( Figures S1 F, S1G, and S2 A) and constructed a 3D map to an overall resolution of 3.5 Å ( Figure 1 A), based on the gold standard Fourier shell correlation criterion ( Figures S2 B–S2D; Henderson et al., 2012 31. Henderson, R. ∙ Sali, A. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Outcome of the first electron microscopy validation task force meeting Structure. 2012; 20 :205-214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). The PM in the center of the structure has higher resolution, approaching 3.3 Å, while the four VSs have slightly lower resolution ( Figure S2 B). The high-quality electron density map allowed us to build an atomic model for rNa v 1.5 C containing D I (missing a short extracellular loop Ala298-Asn303), D II (missing the sequence Leu799-Leu805 between S3 and S4), D III, D IV, and the D III- D IV linker ( Figures 1 A–1D and S3 ). We observed weak electron density on the intracellular side of D I-VS representing the N terminus ( Figure 1 A). In a different protein sample prepared with 0.5 mM flecainide, the resolution of the rNa v 1.5 C -flecainide complex was improved to 3.24 Å ( Figures 2 A, S4 , S5 , and S6 ). No electron density was found for loops between D I and D II, D II and D III, or the CTD containing the EF-hand like domain, suggesting that these segments are disordered or mobile.
Similar to other sodium channel structures, the four domains are assembled in a domain-swapped arrangement ( Figure 1 B). The structure of rNa v 1.5 C can be superimposed well with the human Na v 1.7 α-subunit ( Shen et al., 2019 74. Shen, H. ∙ Liu, D. ∙ Wu, K. ... Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.3 Å over 1,153 Cα atoms in the core region, consistent with high sequence similarity (75.5% identity). The transmembrane region also overlays well with the bacterial sodium channel Na V Ab (Cα RMSD of 3.2 Å for D I) ( Payandeh et al., 2011 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ), illustrating the strong structural conservation of the VS and PM in sodium channels from bacteria to man. Strong electron density is observed for five Asn-linked glycosylation sites and 16 lipid or detergent molecules ( Figures 1 B, S3 E, and S3F). Three of these specifically bound lipid molecules are also observed in Na V 1.4 ( Pan et al., 2018 60. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.4 in complex with β1 Science. 2018; 362 :eaau2486 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ), and two are conserved in Na V Ab as well ( Payandeh et al., 2011 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ), highlighting the potential functional significance of these conserved lipid moieties and their binding sites.
Despite high overall similarity with other sodium channels, there are key differences in the binding sites for the auxiliary Na V β-subunits in rNa v 1.5 C . In contrast to sodium channels from brain and skeletal muscle, no β subunits were observed in biochemical studies of cardiac sodium channels ( Gordon et al., 1988; Lombet and Lazdunski, 1984 28. Gordon, D. ∙ Merrick, D. ∙ Wollner, D.A. ... Biochemical properties of sodium channels in a wide range of excitable tissues studied with site-directed antibodies Biochemistry. 1988; 27 :7032-7038 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Lombet, A. ∙ Lazdunski, M. Characterization, solubilization, affinity labeling and purification of the cardiac Na + channel using Tityus toxin gamma Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141 :651-660 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ), and co-expression of the β-subunit increases expression but does not modulate the kinetics or voltage dependence of Na V 1.5 ( Makita et al., 1994; Qu et al., 1995 49. Makita, N. ∙ Bennett, Jr., P.B. ∙ George, Jr., A.L. Voltage-gated Na + channel beta 1 subunit mRNA expressed in adult human skeletal muscle, heart, and brain is encoded by a single gene J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 :7571-7578 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Qu, Y. ∙ Isom, L.L. ∙ Westenbroek, R.E. ... Modulation of cardiac Na + channel expression in Xenopus oocytes by beta 1 subunits J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 :25696-25701 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our hands, co-expressed Na V β1 and Na V β2 do not stably associate with Na V 1.5. These studies indicate that Na V β-subunits do not interact with Na V 1.5 as strongly as with sodium channels in nerve and skeletal muscle. In comparison to Na V 1.7, ( Figures 1 C and 1D, magenta), we found unexpectedly that Asn319 has unambiguous density for an N-linked carbohydrate moiety, which would clash with β sheet 2 and β sheet 3 of the Ig-like domain of the β1-subunit for its binding to the Na v 1.7 ( Figures 1 E, top panel, and S3 F). The amino acid sequence near Asn319 (Asn-Gly-Thr) encodes a typical core N-linked glycosylation site. Sequence alignment of Asn319 indicates that it is a unique glycosylation site among Na v channels (Na v 1.1–Na v 1.9; Figure S7 A, blue arrow). Moreover, a hydrogen-bond between Tyr304 (α-subunit) and Glu48 (β1-subunit) that supports binding of the β1 subunit in Na v 1.7 is also missing in Na v 1.5, where the equivalent position is occupied by Leu316 ( Figure S7 A, red arrow). These structural changes suggest why Na v 1.5 cannot form the same regulatory interface with Na V β subunits as other Na V α subunits.
Unlike β1, the Na V β2 subunit forms a disulfide bond with the α-subunit of neuronal sodium channels ( Isom et al., 1995; O’Malley and Isom, 2015 37. Isom, L.L. ∙ Ragsdale, D.S. ∙ De Jongh, K.S. ... Structure and function of the β 2 subunit of brain sodium channels, a transmembrane glycoprotein with a CAM motif Cell. 1995; 83 :433-442 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar 59. O’Malley, H.A. ∙ Isom, L.L. Sodium channel β subunits: emerging targets in channelopathies Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :481-504 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surprisingly, we found that the disulfide bond-forming Cys895 from Na v 1.7 ( Shen et al., 2019 74. Shen, H. ∙ Liu, D. ∙ Wu, K. ... Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) is replaced by Leu869 in Na v 1.5 ( Figures 1 D, tan, 1 E, bottom panel, and S7 B, cyan arrow). This Cys residue is conserved in all other Na V channels except Na v 1.8, which has Ala822 at the same position ( Figure S7 B, cyan arrow). This finding indicates that the β2 subunit does not form a disulfide linkage at this position with either the Na v 1.5 or Na v 1.8 α subunit. Together with the placement of a blocking glycosyl moiety in the binding site for the β1 subunit, these results establish a structural basis for reduced binding and modulation of Na V 1.5 by β subunits.
The classic sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) binds in the outer mouth of the ion selectivity filter (SF) and blocks the pore ( Hille, 1975b; Terlau et al., 1991 35. Hille, B. The receptor for tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin. A structural hypothesis Biophys. J. 1975; 15 :615-619 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar 83.

Its characteristic low affinity for Na V 1.5 channels (2 μM) compared to sodium channels in nerve and skeletal muscle (4–10 nM) is a hallmark of sodium channel pharmacology, determined primarily by substitution of a single amino acid residue ( Figure S7 C; Fozzard and Hanck, 1996; Sivilotti et al., 1997 22. Fozzard, H.A. ∙ Hanck, D.A. Structure and function of voltage-dependent sodium channels: comparison of brain II and cardiac isoforms Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76 :887-926 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Sivilotti, L. ∙ Okuse, K. ∙ Akopian, A.N. ... A single serine residue confers tetrodotoxin insensitivity on the rat sensory-neuron-specific sodium channel SNS FEBS Lett. 1997; 409 :49-52 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). The overall structure of the SF of rNa v 1.5 C is nearly identical to that of Na v 1.7, which has a high affinity for TTX ( Figures 1 F and S7 C). However, rNa v 1.5 C shows clear density for Cys374 and Arg377 on the extracellular side of Asp373 ( Figure 1 G), in positions where Na v 1.7 has Tyr362 and Asn365 ( Shen et al., 2019 74. Shen, H. ∙ Liu, D. ∙ Wu, K. ... Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tyr362 helps TTX bind tightly to Na v 1.7 through a π-π stacking interaction, which is missing in Na V 1.5 ( Figure 1 G). The lack of this key interaction reduces the binding affinity of rNa v 1.5 C for TTX by up to 500-fold ( Sunami et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2012 82. Sunami, A. ∙ Glaaser, I.W. ∙ Fozzard, H.A. A critical residue for isoform difference in tetrodotoxin affinity is a molecular determinant of the external access path for local anesthetics in the cardiac sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :2326-2331 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Walker, J.R. ∙ Novick, P.A. ∙ Parsons, W.H. ... Marked difference in saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin affinity for the human nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channel (Na v 1.7) [corrected] Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :18102-18107 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, this residue is the structural determinant that differentiates the TTX-insensitive sodium channels (Na v 1.5 and Na v 1.8–Na v 9) with a Cys or Ser from the TTX-sensitive channels (Na v 1.1–Na v 1.4, Na v 1.6, and Na v 1.7) with a Tyr or Phe. Our rNa v 1.5 C structure shows that this amino acid substitution does not alter local protein conformation but eliminates a key side chain interaction with bound TTX by removing the aromatic side chain.
Class I antiarrhythmic drugs terminate and prevent cardiac arrhythmias by blocking cardiac sodium channels in a complex state-dependent manner ( Sampson and Kass, 2011 71. Sampson, K.J. ∙ Kass, R.K. Antiarrhythmic Drugs Brunton, L. ∙ Chabner, B.A. ∙ Knollman, B. (Editors) Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics McGraw-Hill, 2011; 815-848 Google Scholar ). They are divided into three classes (IA, IB, and IC) based on their rates of binding and unbinding, which determine their clinical uses ( Sampson and Kass, 2011 71. Sampson, K.J. ∙ Kass, R.K. Antiarrhythmic Drugs Brunton, L. ∙ Chabner, B.A. ∙ Knollman, B. (Editors) Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics McGraw-Hill, 2011; 815-848 Google Scholar ). The class IC antiarrhythmic drug flecainide ( Figure 2 B) blocks cardiac sodium channels and is widely used to treat atrial arrhythmias, including the increasingly common problem of atrial fibrillation ( Anno and Hondeghem, 1990; Konzen et al., 1990; Sampson and Kass, 2011 2. Anno, T. ∙ Hondeghem, L.M. Interactions of flecainide with guinea pig cardiac sodium channels. Importance of activation unblocking to the voltage dependence of recovery Circ. Res. 1990; 66 :789-803 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Konzen, G. ∙ Reichardt, B. ∙ Hauswirth, O.

Sampson, K.J. ∙ Kass, R.K. Antiarrhythmic Drugs Brunton, L. ∙ Chabner, B.A. ∙ Knollman, B. (Editors) Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics McGraw-Hill, 2011; 815-848 Google Scholar ). Flecainide blocks rNa V 1.5 C with IC 50 = 16.6 μM when tested with depolarizing stimuli at 100 Hz ( Figure S1 B). The EC 50 was increased to 108 μM when single stimuli were applied at 0.2 Hz ( Figure S1 C), consistent with state-dependent block of open and inactivated rNa V 1.5 C , as observed for native Na V 1.5. Flecainide binds in the central cavity of rNa V 1.5 C , just on the intracellular side of the SF ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Its piperidine ring lies across the top of the central cavity, hindering exit of Na + from the SF ( Figures 2 C and 2D). The positively charged piperidine nitrogen points upward toward the inner exit from the SF and the hydrophobic edge of the piperidine ring extends toward the phenyl side chain of Phe1762 in the IVS6 segment ( Figure 2 C). This binding pose for flecainide is consistent with previous structure-function studies of Na V 1.5 ( Liu et al., 2003; Ragsdale et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2003 46. Liu, H. ∙ Atkins, J. ∙ Kass, R.S.

Phe1762 may interact more strongly with the bound drug in the fully inactivated state observed in Na V Ab, in which two S6 segments move toward the pore axis ( Payandeh et al., 2012 63.

The wall of the central cavity of Na V channels is penetrated by four fenestrations that lead inward from the lipid bilayer between two PM ( Pan et al., 2018; Payandeh et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2019 60.

The two hydrophobic trifluoroethyoxy tails of flecainide latch onto the inner end of the fenestration between the PM in D II and D III ( Figures 2 C and 2E). Flecainide can enter the central cavity through the fenestration and bind to its receptor site in Na V Ab ( Gamal El-Din et al., 2018 24. Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Lenaeus, M.J. ∙ Zheng, N. ... Fenestrations control resting-state block of a voltage-gated sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :13111-13116 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flecainide may access its binding site by entering through the fenestration between D II and D III in the PM of Na V 1.5 ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Entry is also possible through other fenestrations, including D III- D IV, as suggested by molecular modeling studies based on Na V 1.4 ( Nguyen et al., 2019 55. Nguyen, P.T. ∙ DeMarco, K.R. ∙ Vorobyov, I. ... Structural basis for antiarrhythmic drug interactions with the human cardiac sodium channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2945-2954 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the D II- D III fenestration is the largest, and the D III- D IV fenestration is significantly smaller in rNa V 1.5 C .
Na V 1.5 and the Na V β subunits are molecular targets for mutations that cause cardiac arrhythmias ( Kapplinger et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2003b; O’Malley and Isom, 2015 41.

Sodium channel β subunits: emerging targets in channelopathies Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2015; 77 :481-504 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are over 400 disease mutations of human Na v 1.5 (UniProt database), including 230 mutations in Brugada syndrome type-1 (BS1), 153 in long QT syndrome type-3 (LQT3), nine in progressive familial heart block type-1A (PFHA1A), five in sick sinus syndrome 1 (SSS1), and ten in atrial fibrillation type-10 (ATFB10) ( Liu et al., 2003b 47. Liu, H. ∙ Clancy, C. ∙ Cormier, J. ... Mutations in cardiac sodium channels: clinical implications Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 2003; 3 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our high-resolution structure of rNa v 1.5 C provides a structural template for these disease mutations ( Figure 3 ). The mutations are distributed in every structural component, but they are especially common in conserved regions of the VS, SF, activation gate, and fast inactivation gate. The structural basis for pathogenic effects of these mutations is considered in the sections below.
The S4 segment in the VS contains 4 to 8 repeats of a positively charged amino acid residue flanked by two hydrophobic residues ( Catterall et al., 2017; Numa and Noda, 1986 13. Catterall, W.A. ∙ Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Zheng, N. The chemical basis for electrical signaling Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :455-463 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Numa, S. ∙ Noda, M. Molecular structure of sodium channels Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1986; 479 :338-355 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is exposed to aqueous clefts on its extracellular and intracellular ends, and it is sealed to prevent transmembrane movement of water and ions at the narrow (∼5 Å) hydrophobic constriction site (HCS) ( Figures 1 B and 4 A–4D, yellow). The steep voltage dependence of activation results from outward movement of the positive gating charges ( Figures 4 A–4D, blue) in the S4 segment across membrane electric field through the HCS. This charge movement was first measured as a small capacitive gating current in the squid giant axon ( Armstrong and Bezanilla, 1973 3. Armstrong, C.M. ∙ Bezanilla, F. Currents related to movement of the gating particles of the sodium channels Nature. 1973; 242 :459-461 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chemical labeling, disulfide crosslinking, and gating pore current studies directly detected the outward movement of the S4 segments and their gating charges during activation ( DeCaen et al., 2008, 2009, 2011; Gamal El-Din et al., 2014; Yang et al., 1996; Yang and Horn, 1995 16.

Molecular basis of charge movement in voltage-gated sodium channels Neuron. 1996; 16 :113-122 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previous bacterial and mammalian sodium channel structures have captured activated states of the VS, which are most stable at 0 mV ( Pan et al., 2018; Payandeh et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2019 60. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.4 in complex with β1 Science. 2018; 362 :eaau2486 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar 62.

However, recent determination of the structure of the Na v Ab, captured in the resting state, revealed the structural basis for gating charge movement, and supported the “sliding helix” model for VS activation, in which the gating charges move through the HCS under the influence of the electric field and exchange ion pair interactions with the intracellular negative cluster (INC) and extracellular negative cluster (ENC) of negatively charged amino acid residues ( Figures 4 A–4D, red; Wisedchaisri et al., 2019; Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012 88.

As expected from its negative voltage dependence of activation ( Figure S1 A), all four VSs in rNa v 1.5 C are in activated states ( Figures 4 A–4D, left panels). The VS of D I closely resembles the activated state of Na V Ab ( Figure S7 D; Payandeh et al., 2011 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ) and other mammalian sodium channels ( Pan et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2019 60. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.4 in complex with β1 Science. 2018; 362 :eaau2486 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar 74.

The D I gating charges R1–R3 point up toward the extracellular side above the HCS, and both R2 and R3 interact with the ENC. K4 is on the intracellular side of the HCS, stabilized by interaction with the INC ( Figure 4 A, left panel). Similar to D I, gating charges R1–R3 of the D II VS are also on the extracellular side of the HCS, but their outward translocation is less than in D I. R1 and R2 interact with the ENC, but R3 is just above the HCS, and K4 is still on the intracellular side of the HCS ( Figure 4 B, left panel). In contrast, the VS of D III is more activated. Four gating charges (K1–R4) are on the extracellular side of the HCS and both R3 and R4 have moved far enough outward to interact with the ENC. R5 is located in the HCS forming a π-cation interaction with Phe1252 ( Figure 4 C, left panel). Four gating charges in D IV (R1–R4) are on the extracellular side of the HCS, while R5 and R6 are on the intracellular side interacting with the INC ( Figure 4 D, left panel). In addition, two more conserved positively charged residues (Lys1643 and Arg1646) that continue the S4 helix on the intracellular side of the HCS and could potentially serve as gating charges K7 and R8 ( Figure S7 E). In our structure, R8 serves as the C-cap, directed toward S4 helix dipole to stabilize the helical conformation ( Figure S7 E). These additional potential gating charges indicate that S4 of D IV VS could undergo larger outward movement during depolarization.
Recent structure determination of the resting state of Na V Ab ( Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 88. Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ McCord, E. ... Resting-state structure and gating mechanism of a voltage-gated sodium channel Cell. 2019; 178 :993-1003.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ) allows us to view the conformational change associated with activation of the four VSs of Na V 1.5. We generated a resting state model for each VS of Na v 1.5 C by aligning the amino acid sequence of each individual VS with the VS of Na V Ab and using MODELER to determine the best fit structure of the VS of Na v 1.5 C ( Figures 4 A–4D, right panels). We found that two gating charges from each VS of Na v 1.5 C moved inward through the HCS, consistent with the Na v Ab resting state structure. These results suggest that the gating charge movements observed in the transition to the resting state in Na V Ab also apply to Na V 1.5.
In contrast to bacterial sodium channels, whose VSs are identical and activate stochastically, the four VSs in eukaryotic sodium channels are nonequivalent and activate sequentially ( Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002 15. Chanda, B. ∙ Bezanilla, F. Tracking voltage-dependent conformational changes in skeletal muscle sodium channel during activation J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our rNa v 1.5 C structure reveals the asymmetric conformation of the four VS that leads to sequential voltage-dependent activation. Fluorescent labeling and gating pore current studies showed that the S4 segment in the VS of D IV moves five-fold slower than the other three S4 segments ( Capes et al., 2013; Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002; Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2013 9. Capes, D.L. ∙ Goldschen-Ohm, M.P. ∙ Arcisio-Miranda, M. ... Domain IV voltage-sensor movement is both sufficient and rate limiting for fast inactivation in sodium channels J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 142 :101-112 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Chanda, B. ∙ Bezanilla, F. Tracking voltage-dependent conformational changes in skeletal muscle sodium channel during activation J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120 :629-645 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Goldschen-Ohm, M.P. ∙ Capes, D.L. ∙ Oelstrom, K.M. ... Multiple pore conformations driven by asynchronous movements of voltage sensors in a eukaryotic sodium channel Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :1350 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). During depolarization, the VS of D I, D II, and D III move S4 quickly outward to activate the channel, and subsequently full activation of the D IV VS induces a conformational change that leads to fast inactivation. D I VS and D II VS also recover quickly from inactivation, whereas D III VS and D IV VS recover more slowly. Because D III VS and D IV VS have more gating charges than D I VS and D II VS, translocating these additional gating charges across the HCS may be the rate limiting step for their S4 movement.
To understand better how mutations in the VS cause arrhythmias, we compared the positions of the affected amino acid residues in our activated state structure of Na V 1.5 C with their positions in the modeled resting state of the VS of Na V 1.5 C . We found that 18 of 24 mutations in the S3 and S4 segments that we examined moved greater than 4 Å between the resting and activated state conformations ( Table 1 ). Mutations of these amino acid residues that move substantially during activation and deactivation of the voltage sensor likely cause dysfunction by altering the normal conformational changes that are required for VS function. Moreover, the six residues with arrhythmia mutations that moved smaller distances might perturb movement of the VS by altered interactions of their mutant side chains with neighboring amino acid residues that do undergo substantial movements during VS function.
Mutations of Arg gating charges in Na V 1.4 cause pathogenic gating pore current in hypokalemic and normokalemic periodic paralysis owing to leak of ions through the mutant VS ( Sokolov et al., 2007, 2008; Struyk and Cannon, 2007 77. Sokolov, S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Gating pore current in an inherited ion channelopathy Nature. 2007; 446 :76-78 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Sokolov, S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Depolarization-activated gating pore current conducted by mutant sodium channels in potassium-sensitive normokalemic periodic paralysis Proc. Natl. Acad.

A Na + channel mutation linked to hypokalemic periodic paralysis exposes a proton-selective gating pore J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130 :11-20 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). The hole in the center of the VS that conducts pathogenic gating pore current in the mutants was visualized by X-ray crystallography of Na V Ab, revealing an aqueous conducting pathway 2–3 Å in diameter ( Jiang et al., 2018 39. Jiang, D. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Ing, C. ... Structural basis for gating pore current in periodic paralysis Nature. 2018; 557 :590-594 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nine VS mutations in Na V 1.5 convert a gating charge Arg to another uncharged residue and therefore are candidates to conduct gating pore current ( Moreau and Chahine, 2018 53. Moreau, A. ∙ Chahine, M. A new cardiac channelopathy: from clinical phenotypes to molecular mechanisms associated with Nav1.5 gating pores Front. Cardiovasc. Med. 2018; 5 :139 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two of these mutant channels have been shown to conduct substantial gating pore current by direct electrophysiological measurements ( Moreau et al., 2015 54. Moreau, A. ∙ Gosselin-Badaroudine, P. ∙ Boutjdir, M. ... Mutations in the voltage sensors of domains I and II of Nav1.5 that are associated with arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy generate gating pore currents Front. Pharmacol. 2015; 6 :301 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). We introduced the mutation Arg225Pro (R225P) at the position of R3 in our rNa V 1.5 C structure (R226P in rat) and examined the resulting model with MOLE2 to detect water-filled space. As for HypoPP mutations, we found that the pathogenic arrhythmia mutation R226P does indeed make a conductive hole 2.2 Å in diameter through the VS in D II of rNa V 1.5 C ( Figures 4 G and 4H). As expected from electrophysiological studies, this conduction pathway through the mutant VS is open in the activated state but not in the resting state ( Figures 4 G and 4H). These results define the structural basis for pathogenic gating pore current in cardiac arrhythmias.
The intracellular activation gate formed by the intracellular ends of the S6 transmembrane segments controls sodium channel opening and closing, which are coupled to voltage-dependent conformational changes in the VS through the S4-S5 linker, as we observed by comparing the resting and open states of Na V Ab ( Wisedchaisri et al., 2019 88. Wisedchaisri, G. ∙ Tonggu, L. ∙ McCord, E. ... Resting-state structure and gating mechanism of a voltage-gated sodium channel Cell. 2019; 178 :993-1003.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our rNa v 1.5 C structure has a partially open pore, with a water-accessible diameter inside the activation gate of 5.6 Å calculated by MOLE2 ( Figures 5 A and 5B). When compared with the open-state structure of Na v Ab, which has a water-accessible diameter of 8.0 Å, the 5.6 Å opening of the activation gate of rNa v 1.5 C would not be wide enough to allow uninterrupted diffusion of hydrated Na + . Movements of the S4-S5 linkers of D II, D III, and D IV toward the center of the activation gate also indicate that the gate is not fully open ( Figure 5 B).
In order to investigate the closed pore structure of the rNa v 1.5 C , a resting state pore model was generated by MODELER based on the resting state structure of Na v Ab. The resting-state model showed dramatic shifts of the S4-S5 linkers toward the pore axis, which contracts the activation gate. As a consequence, the gate is completely sealed by the side chains of a ring of hydrophobic residues (Val413, Leu941, Ile1471, and Ile1773) ( Figure 5 C). This closed and sealed model of the resting state has no aqueous space for water or ions to penetrate the closed activation gate.
Cardiac sodium channels are inactivated within 1–2 ms after opening. Fast inactivation of sodium channels decreases Na + influx and allows potassium channels to activate and repolarize the membrane potential. This mechanism is very important for generating repeated action potentials to drive the heartbeat at a consistent frequency. Mutagenesis studies indicated that an isoleucine-phenylalanine-methionine (IFM) motif located in the D III- D IV linker is responsible for fast inactivation of eukaryotic sodium channels ( West et al., 1992 87. West, J.W. ∙ Patton, D.E. ∙ Scheuer, T. ... A cluster of hydrophobic amino acid residues required for fast Na + -channel inactivation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1992; 89 :10910-10914 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ), through interactions with amino acid residues in the S4-S5 linkers in D III and D IV and the intracellular ends of the S5 and S6 segments of D IV ( Kellenberger et al., 1996; McPhee et al., 1994, 1995, 1998; Smith and Goldin, 1997 43.

Site-directed fluorescent labeling and gating-pore current studies suggested that fast inactivation is coupled with the movement of D III and D IV gating charges and causes immobilization of those gating charges ( Capes et al., 2013; Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002 9.

In our rNa v 1.5 C structure, the D III- D IV linker, which is responsible for fast inactivation, packs in parallel with D IV S4-S5 linker, and the IFM motif dips into a pocket formed by D III S6 and D IV S5 and S6 ( Figure 5 A). The IFM motif is well resolved with unambiguous electron density ( Figure 5 D). Remarkably, its structure closely resembles the structure of the IFM motif determined by NMR analysis in solution ( Rohl et al., 1999 70. Rohl, C.A. ∙ Boeckman, F.A. ∙ Baker, C. ... Solution structure of the sodium channel inactivation gate Biochemistry. 1999; 38 :855-861 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that its fold is highly stable. IFM penetrates into a compact hydrophobic pocket ∼8 Å deep formed by the S4-S5 linker from D IV, S5 from D III, and S5 and S6 from D IV ( Figure 5 E), in close agreement with mutagenesis studies ( Kellenberger et al., 1996; McPhee et al., 1994, 1995, 1998; Smith and Goldin, 1997 43.

Besides the hydrophobic interaction inside this pocket, additional interactions from both ends stabilize binding of the IFM motif. At its C terminus, Asn1661, the carbonyl oxygens of Phe1488 and Thr1490, and the carbonyl oxygen of Gln1320 form two hydrogen bonds ( Figures 5 F and 5G). Interactions with a cluster of hydrophobic residues further stabilize binding of the D III- D IV linker to the D IV S4-S5 linker ( Figure 5 F). At its N terminus, Asn1474 and Gln1478 from D III S6 interact with carbonyl oxygens of Gly1338 and Ala1328, respectively ( Figure 5 G). Mutations of those interacting residues disrupt binding of the IFM motif, which in turn affect sodium channel inactivation. For instance, the single mutation Asn1661Ala or the double mutations Phe1650Ala and Leu1659Ala almost completely abolish fast inactivation ( McPhee et al., 1994, 1995, 1998; Smith and Goldin, 1997 50.

The sequential activation of the four VSs in mammalian sodium channels finishes with activation of D IV VS, which is thought to be the main driving force for fast inactivation ( Capes et al., 2013; Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2013 9. Capes, D.L. ∙ Goldschen-Ohm, M.P. ∙ Arcisio-Miranda, M. ... Domain IV voltage-sensor movement is both sufficient and rate limiting for fast inactivation in sodium channels J. Gen.

Multiple pore conformations driven by asynchronous movements of voltage sensors in a eukaryotic sodium channel Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :1350 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). D III VS, which is activated third in sequence, is also involved in fast inactivation, and its gating charges are stabilized in their outward positions by fast inactivation. By comparing the VS of rNa v 1.5 C D III with the activated VS of Na v Ab, we found that the gating charges of rNa v 1.5 C D III VS have moved further outward than those of Na v Ab, thereby lifting S4-S5 linker of D III more outward with respect to the intracellular membrane surface ( Figure 4 E) and opening a tight binding pocket for the IFM motif. Thus, D III VS must be activated to move its S4-S5 linker into the proper position for binding the IFM motif. The binding energy of the IFM motif would stabilize this activated state of the D III VS, revealing why movement of the gating charges of D III VS is slower than D I and D II during recovery from inactivation ( Capes et al., 2013; Goldschen-Ohm et al., 2013 9. Capes, D.L. ∙ Goldschen-Ohm, M.P. ∙ Arcisio-Miranda, M. ... Domain IV voltage-sensor movement is both sufficient and rate limiting for fast inactivation in sodium channels J. Gen.

Our rNa v 1.5 C structure shows the IFM motif binding to the pocket on the periphery of the activation gate, which is consistent with the structures of human Na v 1.2, Na v 1.4, and Na v 1.7 ( Pan et al., 2018, 2019; Shen et al., 2019 60. Pan, X. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structure of the human voltage-gated sodium channel Na v 1.4 in complex with β1 Science. 2018; 362 :eaau2486 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar 61.

Structures of human Na v 1.7 channel in complex with auxiliary subunits and animal toxins Science. 2019; 363 :1303-1308 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ). Those similar structures demonstrate a conserved mechanism for fast inactivation. Moreover, the close interactions of the IFM motif detailed here for rNa v 1.5 C ( Figures 5 D–5G) suggest that the inactivation gate is in an inactivating conformation because it interacts directly with several amino acid residues in the “inactivation gate receptor” whose mutation disrupts fast inactivation ( McPhee et al., 1994, 1995, 1998; Smith and Goldin, 1997 50. McPhee, J.C. ∙ Ragsdale, D.S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ... A mutation in segment IVS6 disrupts fast inactivation of sodium channels Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Interaction between the sodium channel inactivation linker and domain III S4-S5 Biophys. J. 1997; 73 :1885-1895 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inactivation is evidently triggered by outward movement of the gating charges of D III and D IV VS, which move the IFM motif into the binding pocket ( Kellenberger et al., 1996 43. Kellenberger, S. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Catterall, W.A. Movement of the Na + channel inactivation gate during inactivation J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :30971-30979 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ) and decouple the D III S4-S5 linker from D IV S6. In rNa v 1.5 C , we observe that the D III S4-S5 linker shifts significantly toward the center of the activation gate, compared with the other three S4-S5 linkers ( Figures 5 A and 5B). In this position, the activation gate cannot open wide enough for free conductance of hydrated Na + ( Chakrabarti et al., 2013 14. Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Ing, C. ∙ Payandeh, J. ... Catalysis of Na + permeation in the bacterial sodium channel Na( V) Ab Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11331-11336 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our structure suggests that Na V 1.5 C is in an intermediate inactivated state because the fast inactivation gate is not as far open as observed in the Na V Pas channel from cockroach ( Shen et al., 2017 73. Shen, H. ∙ Zhou, Q. ∙ Pan, X. ... Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution Science. 2017; 355 :eaal4326 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the pore is not yet as completely closed as in the inactivated state of Na V Ab ( Payandeh et al., 2012 63. Payandeh, J. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Scheuer, T. ... Crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel in two potentially inactivated states Nature. 2012; 486 :135-139 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ).
LQT3 and other cardiac arrhythmias are often caused by mutations that slow or prevent fast inactivation ( Li et al., 2018 45. Li, W. ∙ Yin, L. ∙ Shen, C. ... SCN5A Variants: Association With Cardiac Disorders Front. Physiol. 2018; 9 :1372 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). LQT3 mutants are most often located in the inactivation gate or its receptor ( Figure 3 ). Given their short lengths, it is surprising that 11 arrhythmia mutations are located in the S4-S5 linkers in D I, D III, and D IV ( Figure 3 ). Nine of these mutations cause LQT3 by impairing fast inactivation. Our structure of Na V 1.5 gives clear insight into the mechanism of action of these mutations ( Figures 5 E–5G). These amino acid substitutions would impair the close fit of the IFM motif into its receptor site by altering the collar of S4-S5 segments that form the receptor. The LQT3 mutant Ile1662Val (Ile1660Val in hNa v 1.5) may cause reduced amplitude of sodium current because the IFM motif binds deeper and makes recovery from fast inactivation more difficult.
Mutations in the inactivation gate itself also cause LQT3. For example, Phe1475Cys (Phe1473Cys in hNa v 1.5) alters the key Phe in the IFM motif ( Figures 5 D and 5E) and causes slowed and incomplete inactivation and increased persistent sodium current ( Bankston et al., 2007 4. Bankston, J.R. ∙ Yue, M. ∙ Chung, W. ... A novel and lethal de novo LQT-3 mutation in a newborn with distinct molecular pharmacology and therapeutic response PLoS ONE. 2007; 2 :e1258 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). The nearby ATFB10 mutant Gln1478Lys (Gln1476Lys in hNa v 1.5; Figure 5 G) also accelerates recovery from fast inactivation, due to decreased affinity for IFM ( Dichgans et al., 2005 19. Dichgans, M. ∙ Freilinger, T. ∙ Eckstein, G. ... Mutation in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1A in familial hemiplegic migraine Lancet. 2005; 366 :371-377 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ). The original LQT3 triple mutation, ΔKPQ(1507–1509), causes a three-residue in-frame deletion downstream of the inactivation gate and dramatically impairs fast inactivation ( Bennett et al., 1995 8. Bennett, P.B. ∙ Yazawa, K. ∙ Makita, N. ... Molecular mechanism for an inherited cardiac arrhythmia Nature. 1995; 376 :683-685 Crossref Scopus (808) PubMed Google Scholar ). This deletion mutation of rNa v 1.5 C is located in the flexible loop following the highly conserved α-helix in the D III -D IV linker ( Figures 1 B and 3 C), which would shorten the loop by 13 Å and significantly limit the movement of IFM during cycles of activation followed by fast inactivation in the repeated cardiac action potentials necessary to trigger the heartbeat.
The location of the SF was first revealed by mapping the binding site for TTX ( Noda et al., 1989; Terlau et al., 1991 57. Noda, M. ∙ Suzuki, H. ∙ Numa, S. ... A single point mutation confers tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin insensitivity on the sodium channel II FEBS Lett. 1989; 259 :213-216 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar 83.

Mutagenesis studies identified amino acid residues from equivalent positions in the four domains, Asp373-Glu901-Lys1421-Ala1713 (DEKA), as the key determinants of Na + selectivity ( Favre et al., 1996; Heinemann et al., 1992; Sun et al., 1997 21. Favre, I. ∙ Moczydlowski, E. ∙ Schild, L. On the structural basis for ionic selectivity among Na + , K + , and Ca 2+ in the voltage-gated sodium channel Biophys. J. 1996; 71 :3110-3125 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Heinemann, S.H. ∙ Terlau, H. ∙ Stühmer, W. ... Calcium channel characteristics conferred on the sodium channel by single mutations Nature. 1992; 356 :441-443 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Sun, Y.M. ∙ Favre, I. ∙ Schild, L. ... On the structural basis for size-selective permeation of organic cations through the voltage-gated sodium channel. Effect of alanine mutations at the DEKA locus on selectivity, inhibition by Ca 2+ and H + , and molecular sieving J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110 :693-715 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Na V Ab, this highly charged site at the extracellular entry to the SF, termed the high field strength site (HFS), is formed by four Glu177 side chains. This site interacts first with permeating Na + and catalyzes partial dehydration of the conducted ion ( Chakrabarti et al., 2013 14. Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Ing, C. ∙ Payandeh, J. ... Catalysis of Na + permeation in the bacterial sodium channel Na( V) Ab Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11331-11336 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the rNa v 1.5 C structure, the DEKA motif stands in the center of the pore, forming a similar HFS ( Figures 6 A and 6B). The conformations of the four Cα atoms form a nearly 4-fold symmetrical square, similar to the conformation of the HFS in Na V Ab ( Payandeh et al., 2011 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the difference in side chains makes the site in rNa v 1.5 C asymmetric. The high local resolution for the SF structure allows us to build a reliable atomic model of these side chains ( Figure 6 B). Unambiguous density for Lys1421 shows the side chain pointing inward, deep into the SF as a pinch point ( Figures 6 B–6D). This position for the side chain of Lys1421 is surprising, as it seems likely that cation permeation would be blocked if a full positive charge were located in this position. The electron density for the distal end of the side chain of Glu901 is not as well resolved, which suggests side chain flexibility. This conformational flexibility of Glu901 may allow it to function via the “side chain-dunking” mechanism of Na + permeation observed in molecular dynamics studies of Na V Ab, in which rotation of the corresponding Glu177 side chains at a single torsion angle allowed their negative charges to “dunk” in concert with movement of Na + through the SF ( Chakrabarti et al., 2013 14. Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Ing, C. ∙ Payandeh, J. ... Catalysis of Na + permeation in the bacterial sodium channel Na( V) Ab Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11331-11336 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Compared to the approximately square orifice of the SF of Na V Ab ( Payandeh et al., 2011 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ), which has van der Walls dimensions of 4.6 × 4.6 Å, rNa v 1.5 C has a rectangular SF with van der Walls dimensions of 3.0 × 4.6 Å ( Figures 6 B and 6C). These dimensions are remarkably close to the model developed from classic studies of selective permeation of inorganic and organic cations, which suggested 3.1 × 5.1 Å ( Hille, 1971, 1972, 1975a 32. Hille, B. The permeability of the sodium channel to organic cations in myelinated nerve J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58 :599-619 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Hille, B. The permeability of the sodium channel to metal cations in myelinated nerve J. Gen. Physiol. 1972; 59 :637-658 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Hille, B. Ionic selectivity, saturation, and block in sodium channels. A four-barrier model J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66 :535-560 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to the four Glu177 residues that form the HFS in Na V Ab, the Asp373 and Glu901 side chain positions are more inward in Na V 1.5, and the other half of the negatively charged tetrad is replaced by Lys1421 and Ala1713 on the opposite side of the SF. However, the HFS of Na v 1.5 is extended inward by the side chains of Glu376, Asp904 and Asp1716 ( Figure 6 D), which may act together with Asp373 and Glu901 to form the asymmetric HFS of Na V 1.5.
A remarkable panel of 71 arrhythmia mutations target the PM and SF ( Figure 3 ). Most of these mutations cause Brugada syndrome ( Figure 3 , red), which is thought to arise from heterozygous loss of function of Na V 1.5 by impairing its folding and functional expression ( Baroudi et al., 2001, 2002 5. Baroudi, G. ∙ Pouliot, V. ∙ Denjoy, I. ... Novel mechanism for Brugada syndrome: defective surface localization of an SCN5A mutant (R1432G) Circ. Res. 2001; 88 :E78-E83 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 6. Baroudi, G. ∙ Acharfi, S. ∙ Larouche, C. ... Expression and intracellular localization of an SCN5A double mutant R1232W/T1620M implicated in Brugada syndrome Circ. Res. 2002; 90 :E11-E16 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mutations in key amino acid residues in the PM may also cause loss of function by impairing ion conductance through an otherwise structurally normal Na V 1.5 channel protein. We found eight Brugada syndrome mutations in the SF itself, and our structure gives clear insights into the likely pathogenic mechanism for five of them.
Two Brugada syndrome mutations are likely to have local structural effects that impair ion conductance. The mutation Trp375Gly removes the large indole side chain from this highly conserved Trp residue, whose backbone carbonyl is crucial in stabilizing the SF structure by forming a network of hydrogen bonds around the HFS ( Payandeh et al., 2011 62. Payandeh, J. ∙ Scheuer, T. ∙ Zheng, N. ... The crystal structure of a voltage-gated sodium channel Nature. 2011; 475 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that this mutation alters the square shape of the four Cα atoms that form the backbone corners of the SF. The nearby mutation Met370Lys replaces a hydrophobic side chain with a hydrophilic one in a buried hydrophobic pocket. This mutation may also alter the precise local folding of the SF.
Even more strikingly, we found that the key SF DEKA signature residue Lys1421 in D III is actually a target for Brugada syndrome mutation (Lys1421Glu) ( Kapplinger et al., 2010 41. Kapplinger, J.D. ∙ Tester, D.J. ∙ Alders, M. ... An international compendium of mutations in the SCN5A-encoded cardiac sodium channel in patients referred for Brugada syndrome genetic testing Heart Rhythm. 2010; 7 :33-46 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (601) PubMed Google Scholar ). As our structure reveals, this residue plays a key role in forming the HFS in the SF of Na V 1.5, and functional studies show that it is essential for selective sodium conductance ( Favre et al., 1996; Heinemann et al., 1992 21. Favre, I. ∙ Moczydlowski, E. ∙ Schild, L. On the structural basis for ionic selectivity among Na + , K + , and Ca 2+ in the voltage-gated sodium channel Biophys. J. 1996; 71 :3110-3125 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Heinemann, S.H. ∙ Terlau, H. ∙ Stühmer, W. ... Calcium channel characteristics conferred on the sodium channel by single mutations Nature. 1992; 356 :441-443 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar ). It occupies a unique dunked position deep in the SF in our structure, and we propose that it has a unique function as a coordinating ligand for Na + through delocalization of its positive charge by formation of a charge transfer complex, as developed in more detail in the following section. Our structure predicts that mutation of Lys1421 to Glu, as in Brugada syndrome, would create an ion coordination site for Ca 2+ in the SF and thereby cause a loss of function by competing with sodium conductance, as was shown in mutagenesis studies of Na V 1.4 ( Heinemann et al., 1992 30. Heinemann, S.H. ∙ Terlau, H. ∙ Stühmer, W. ... Calcium channel characteristics conferred on the sodium channel by single mutations Nature. 1992; 356 :441-443 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, our structure defines the molecular basis for Na V 1.5 dysfunction caused by this Brugada syndrome mutation at the atomic level. The adjacent Gly is the target of the Brugada syndrome mutation Gly1422Arg. This mutation in D III places the large positively charged Arg side chain squarely in the aqueous ion conduction pathway and would surely reduce or prevent sodium conductance. Finally, the Brugada syndrome mutation Thr1711Arg in D IV has a similar effect to Gly1422Arg in D III by placing a positively charged Arg side chain in the aqueous ion conduction pathway in the SF, thereby reducing or blocking sodium conductance.
It is surprising that bacterial channels have a HFS formed by four negatively charged Glu side chains, whereas vertebrate sodium channels have a signature sequence of DEKA at the HFS. Is there a common mechanism that mediates conduction in both cases? Our previous crystal structure of Na v Ab and correlated molecular dynamics simulations suggested that hydrated Na + is partially dehydrated by the HFS formed by four Glu177 residues and further that Glu177 side chains rotate around a single torsion angle and “dunk” with permeating Na + ( Chakrabarti et al., 2013 14. Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Ing, C. ∙ Payandeh, J. ... Catalysis of Na + permeation in the bacterial sodium channel Na( V) Ab Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11331-11336 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most common modes of Na + conductance have two dunking Glu177 carboxyl groups ( Chakrabarti et al., 2013 14. Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Ing, C. ∙ Payandeh, J. ... Catalysis of Na + permeation in the bacterial sodium channel Na( V) Ab Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11331-11336 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the structure of the SF in Na V 1.5 C , Lys1421 is in a dunked conformation, as if it interacts with permeating Na + . How is that possible? Detailed analysis of the pKa values of Lys residues in different positions in a known protein structure demonstrated large decreases in pKa of the Lys –NH 2 group to values as low at pH 5.3 in nonaqueous environments and in environments with nearby hydrogen bond acceptors, which are comparable to the pKa values of carboxyl groups ( Isom et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2017 38. Isom, D.G. ∙ Castañeda, C.A. ∙ Cannon, B.R. ... Large shifts in pKa values of lysine residues buried inside a protein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :5260-5265 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Wu, X. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Brooks, B.R. Origin of pK a shifts of internal lysine residues in SNase studied via equal-molar VMMS simulations in explicit water J. Phys. Chem. B. 2017; 121 :3318-3330 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the SF itself, there are no free water molecules and many surrounding hydrogen bond acceptors ( Figures 6 B–6E). Therefore, we propose that Lys1421 side chain dunked deep in the SF forms a complex in which its positive charge is delocalized by interaction of all three NH 3 + protons with nearby backbone carbonyl groups of Thr1419, Thr1711, and Ser1712 ( Figure 6 E). Remarkably, despite the presence of Lys1421, the surface of the SF in this region is uniformly electronegative ( Figure S7 F, red). This delocalization of the –NH 3 + charge may allow the unpaired electrons of the N atom to serve as a specific coordinating ligand of Na + , consistent with the unique requirement for Lys at this position for Na + selectivity ( Favre et al., 1996; Heinemann et al., 1992; Sun et al., 1997 21. Favre, I. ∙ Moczydlowski, E. ∙ Schild, L. On the structural basis for ionic selectivity among Na + , K + , and Ca 2+ in the voltage-gated sodium channel Biophys. J. 1996; 71 :3110-3125 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Heinemann, S.H. ∙ Terlau, H. ∙ Stühmer, W. ... Calcium channel characteristics conferred on the sodium channel by single mutations Nature. 1992; 356 :441-443 Crossref Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar 81. Sun, Y.M. ∙ Favre, I. ∙ Schild, L. ... On the structural basis for size-selective permeation of organic cations through the voltage-gated sodium channel. Effect of alanine mutations at the DEKA locus on selectivity, inhibition by Ca 2+ and H + , and molecular sieving J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110 :693-715 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on these considerations, we propose a unified model for SF function in prokaryotes and eukaryotes in which Na + is conducted in concert with dunking of the side chain of Glu901 followed by formation of a unique charge-delocalization complex with Lys1421 in eukaryotes. This model retains the side-chain dunking mechanism of prokaryotic sodium channels and explains the extraordinary importance for Lys1421 in determining the Na + selectivity of eukaryotic sodium channels, because only charged Na + would have small enough size and sufficiently high field strength to join the charge delocalization complex formed by Lys1421 and engage in an energetically favorable coordination with it. Consistent with this model, Li + is also highly permeant and has a similar high field strength surrounding its positively charged nucleus, whereas the larger alkali metal cations K + , Rb + , and Cs + are not highly permeant and do not have a high-field-strength positive charge. Thus, this model for sodium selectivity would bring together several unexpected aspects of sodium permeation, the side-chain dunking mechanism of the prokaryotic SF, and the unique structure of the eukaryotic SF.
The Na V 1.5 channel has unique physiological roles and stands alone on a branch of the dendrogram of related sodium channel proteins ( Goldin et al., 2000 26. Goldin, A.L. ∙ Barchi, R.L. ∙ Caldwell, J.H. ... Nomenclature of voltage-gated sodium channels Neuron. 2000; 28 :365-368 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (675) PubMed Google Scholar ). Even heterozygous disease mutations in Na V 1.5 can be lethal, indicating that other sodium channels cannot compensate for loss of its unique functions. Despite these specific functional requirements, our structure of Na V 1.5 C is highly similar to other sodium channels in the transmembrane core. Based on this detailed structure, we have elucidated the molecular basis for several specific functions of Na V 1.5.
The interaction sites for Na V β subunits are strikingly altered in Na V 1.5 C . An Asn residue with N-linked carbohydrate chain attached is substituted for a key amino acid residue in the interaction site for the β1 subunit. Differential glycosylation of this site has the potential for controlling modulation of sodium channel expression and function by β1 and β3 subunits. Similarly, the highly conserved Cys that forms a disulfide bond with the β2 and β4 subunits is replaced by Leu869. The lack of disulfide-bond formation is likely to make binding of β2 and β4 much less stable.
The characteristic low affinity for block of Na V 1.5 by TTX is a hallmark of sodium channel pharmacology. The Na V 1.5 C structure shows that the Cys374 residue that is substituted for aromatic residues in Na V 1.5 does not change the local conformation but fails to make a productive molecular interaction with bound TTX because of steric constraints. The loss of interactions between TTX and the aromatic side chains at this position is likely to be responsible for the 500-fold reduction of TTX-binding affinity in Na V 1.5.
Our results give a detailed, high-resolution view of the receptor site for antiarrhythmic drugs. Flecainide binds to a platform at one side of the central cavity and blocks sodium permeation directly. Binding of its piperidine nitrogen to the Lys1421 charge delocalization complex at the inner end of the SF would prevent conductance of Na + . This platform may mediate binding of other class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, most of which have a large hydrophobic ring structure similar to flecainide. The class IA antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., procainamide) and the class IB antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., lidocaine) are smaller and less hydrophobic; therefore, it is likely that they occupy only a portion of the flecainide-binding surface. The comparatively high affinity and slow binding kinetics that are the hallmark of block by flecainide and other class IC drugs likely reflect their interaction with this larger binding surface.
The four VSs in the rNa V 1.5 C are all in partially or fully activated conformations, because each of them has moved at least two gating charges outward with respect to their positions in our resting state model of Na V 1.5. The outward position of the gating charges is most prominent for the VS in D III because four gating charges are located outside the HCS. This outward movement of the S4 segment in D III is coupled to conformational changes in the S4-S5 linker that forms the receptor site for the IFM motif in the fast inactivation gate. In the resting state model of Na V 1.5, the interaction site for the inactivation gate is blocked by the intracellular end of the S4 segment in D III and the S4-S5 linker connecting D III and D IV, but it is available and occupied by the IFM motif of the inactivation gate in our structure of Na V 1.5 C . These structural results reveal the molecular basis for coupling of activation to fast inactivation in atomic detail.
The structure of the SF in rNa V 1.5 C reveals crucial insights into the mechanism of Na + conductance and selectivity. The image of the side chain of Lys1421 in a dunked conformation deep in the SF leads directly to a model of cation permeation that combines two key elements: dunking of the side chain of Glu901, in analogy to the model proposed for bacterial sodium channels from molecular dynamics analysis ( Chakrabarti et al., 2013 14. Chakrabarti, N. ∙ Ing, C. ∙ Payandeh, J. ... Catalysis of Na + permeation in the bacterial sodium channel Na( V) Ab Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11331-11336 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ), plus interaction with the unique charge-delocalization complex of the amino group of Lys1421 and its neighboring hydrogen bond acceptors. As illustrated in Figure S7 F, the positive charge of Lys1421 is completely transferred to the three backbone carbonyls with which it forms hydrogen bonds, leaving a negative surface for interaction with conducted cations. This is a stable configuration in our structure, but the side chain of Lys1421 may move outward and then re-dunk in concert with Na + permeation. Among alkali metal cations, only Li + and Na + have sufficient charge density to replace a proton as a ligand of a primary NH 2 group. Thus, this model explains the unique requirement for Lys1421 in order to achieve high Na + selectivity and fits well with the high conductance of Li + in sodium channels.
Finally, the structure of rNa V 1.5 C provides key insights into the mechanism of action of arrhythmia mutations. We find that many mutations located in the VS affect amino acid residues that move substantially during activation. Changing these amino acid residues is likely to disrupt activation and/or deactivation by altering structural interactions that are essential for normal VS movement. Arrhythmia mutations that cause gating pore currents generate a transmembrane hole in the VS, like corresponding mutations in Na V 1.4 that are pathogenic in periodic paralysis ( Jiang et al., 2018 39. Jiang, D. ∙ Gamal El-Din, T.M. ∙ Ing, C. ... Structural basis for gating pore current in periodic paralysis Nature. 2018; 557 :590-594 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). This finding elucidates the mechanism of arrhythmogenesis by these mutations at the atomic level. We find that mutations that alter amino acid residues in the fast inactivation gate and its receptor disrupt close interactions between the IFM motif and its binding partners in the S4-S5 linkers in D III and D IV and the intracellular end of the S6 segment in D I. Similarly, mutation of the key SF residue Lys1421 to Glu may cause loss of function by inducing a calcium binding site in a blocking position in the SF. Future experiments may allow structure-based diagnosis and drug development for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias based on this structural information.

E. coli GC10 was cultured at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin for plasmid DNA extraction. E. coli DH10Bac was cultured at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin sulfate, 7 μg/mL gentamicin and 10 μg/mL tetracycline for bacmid production.
Sf9 ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) insect cells were maintained in Grace’s Insect Medium and supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin at 27°C and passaged at 80%–95% confluence for baculovirus production. HEK293S GnTI - ( Homo sapiens ) mammalian cells were maintained and infected on cell culture plates in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO 2 for electrophysiology.
All experiments were performed at room temperature (21-24°C). HEK293S GnTI - cells were held at −140 mV and 50-ms pulses were applied in 10 mV increments. Holding leak potential was set to −140 mV. Extracellular solution contains in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Intracellular solution: 35 NaCl, 105 CsF, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Glass electrodes had a resistance 2-3 MΩ. Currents resulted from applied pulses were filtered at 5 kHz with a low-pass Bessel filter, and then digitized at 20 kHz. Voltage commands were generated using Pulse 8.5 software (HEKA, Germany) and ITC18 analog-to-digital interface (Instrutech, Port Washington, NY).
The full-length rat Nav1.5 gene was cloned into pEG_BacMam vector, with a recombinant human rhinovirus (RHV 3C) protease site, eGFP and a DYKDDDK FLAG peptide fused at its C terminus. Non-structured loop deleted constructs were screened by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) ( Kawate and Gouaux, 2006 42. Kawate, T. ∙ Gouaux, E. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography for precrystallization screening of integral membrane proteins Structure. 2006; 14 :673-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (541) PubMed Google Scholar ) for improved expression level and thermostability. The plasmid was transfected into DH10Bac competent cells to make baculovirus for transduction of HEK293S GnTI − cells (ATCC). HEK293S GnTI− cells were cultured in FreeStyle 293 expression medium (ThermoFisher Scientific) within 8% CO 2 37°C incubator shaking at 130 rpm. 30 mL of P3 baculovirus was added to 800 mL medium when cell density reached 2.5-3.0 × 10 6 cells per mL. 10 mM sodium butyrate was added to cell culture 8 hours after and cells were cultured for another 48 h at 30°C with 8% CO 2 before harvesting.
For each purification, 6 L of transfected cells were harvested and washed with buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH = 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol (buffer A). Washed cells were collected by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000xg for 1 h, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A supplemented with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.2% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate Tris salt (CHS, Anatrace), 5 mM lidocaine, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), and agitated for 1.5 h at 4°C. The supernatant was separated by ultra-centrifugation at 100,000xg for 35 min, then incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and agitated for 1 h at 4°C. The resin was re-loaded to a column and washed 5 times with buffer A supplemented with 0.06% glycol-diosgenin (GDN, Anatrace) and 2 mM lidocaine in a total volume of 100 ml. The rNa V 1.5 C protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 0.06% GDN, 2 mM lidocaine and 100 μg/ml Flag peptide (Bio Basic). The eluted protein was concentrated and loaded onto a Superose-6 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 25 mM imidazole pH = 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM lidocaine and 0.006% GDN. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ∼500 μL at 1 mg/ml and mixed with 50 μM ProTx II overnight. The mixture was then re-loaded to Superose-6 column within the same buffer. Finally, peak fractions were concentrated to 50 μL at 4.5 mg/ml.
For rNa V 1.5 C -flecainide complex purification, the sample was purified similarly with some modifications. First, no lidocaine was used throughout the purification. Second, the sample was mixed with purified human FGF12b and incubated overnight at 4°C. Third, the solutions for the second gel filtration contained 0.5 mM flecainide. Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to 50 μL at 5.5 mg/ml.
Three microliters of purified sample was applied to glow-discharged holey gold grids (UltraAuFoil, 300 mesh, R1.2/1.3), and blotted for 3.0 - 3.5 s at 100% humidity and 4°C before being plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using an FEI Mark IV Vitrobot. All data were acquired using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300kV, a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter with a slit width of 20eV. A total of 7,626 movie stacks for rNa V 1.5 C -ProTxII and 5,049 movie stacks for rNa V 1.5 C -flecainide were automatically collected using Leginon ( Suloway et al., 2005 80. Suloway, C. ∙ Pulokas, J. ∙ Fellmann, D. ... Automated molecular microscopy: the new Leginon system J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151 :41-60 Crossref Scopus (1234) PubMed Google Scholar ) at a nominal magnification of 130,000x with a pixel size of 0.528 Å (super-resolution mode). Defocus range was set between −1.0 and −2.5 μm. The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each stack was exposed for 8.4 s with 42 frames with a total dose of 60 e - /Å 2 .
The movie stacks were motion corrected with MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 94. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ), binned 2- fold, and dose weighted, yielding a pixel size of 1.056 Å. Defocus value of each aligned sum were estimated with Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 93. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ). For rNa V 1.5 C -ProTxII and rNa V 1.5 C -FGF12b-flecainide respectively, 7,427/4,890 micrographs with CTF fits better than 6 Å were used for particle picking. A total of 2,188,972/2,369,854 particles were automatically picked in RELION2.0 ( Scheres, 2012 72. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ). After several rounds of 2D classification, 590,667/1,164,667 good particles were selected and subjected to one class global angular search 3D classification with an angular search step at 7.5°, using the low-pass filtered cryoEM map of Na V Pas as an initial model. Each of the last five iterations was further subjected to four-class local angular search and 3D classification with an angular search step at 3.75°. After combining particles from the best 3D classes and removing duplicated particles, 293,629/733,541 particles were subjected to per-particle CTF estimation by Gctf followed by Bayesian polishing. The polished particles were subjected to a final three-class multi-reference 3D classification. The best class containing 106,104/513,604 particles was imported into cisTEM ( Grant et al., 2018 29. Grant, T. ∙ Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. cis TEM, user-friendly software for single-particle image processing eLife. 2018; 7 :e35383 Crossref Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ) for refinement. A protein-only mask was used to avoid over-fitting of the detergent micelles. Several iterative global and local refinement improved protein density of the map. For the rNa V 1.5 C -ProTxII map, only weak density for ProTxII was observed on DI-VS, which was not sufficient to build a model. For the rNa V 1.5 C -FGF12b-flecainide map, weak density at the C terminus was observed, but it was not sufficient to build a model for the CTD or FGF12b. The final map was sharpened in cisTEM by applying a B-factor of −60. Local resolution was estimated by MonoRes ( Vilas et al., 2018 84. Vilas, J.L. ∙ Gomez-Blanco, J. ∙ Conesa, P. ... MonoRes: Automatic and accurate estimation of local resolution for electron microscopy maps Structure. 2018; 26 337-344 e334 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). A diagram of data processing is presented in Figures S2 and S5 .
The structure of human Na V 1.4 (PDB code: 6AGF ) α-subunit was fitted into the cryo-EM density map of rNa V 1.5 C in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 64. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33470) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then the model was manually rebuilt in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 20. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20217) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently refined in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18497) PubMed Google Scholar ). The model versus map FSC curve was calculated by Phenix.mtriage. Statistics for cryo-EM data collection and model refinement are summarized in Table S1 .
Current–voltage (I–V) relationships were recorded in response to voltage steps ranging from −150 to + 50 mV in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of −150 mV. Conductance-voltage (G–V) curves were calculated from the corresponding (I–V) curves. Pulses were generated and currents were recorded using Pulse software controlling an InstruTECH ITC18 interface (HEKA). Data were analyzed using Igor Pro 6.37 (WaveMetrics). G-V curves were fit with a simple two-state Boltzmann Equation 1/(1+exp(V 1/2 -V p )/ k ) in which V p is the stimulus potential, V 1/2 is the half-activation voltage, and k is the slope factor. Concentration-response curve was fit with a Hill equation ( base +( max-base )/(1+K A /[L]) n ), where K A is flecainide concentration producing 50% block and [L] is the free unbound flecainide, and n is the Hill coefficient. The best fit gives a Hill coefficient n = 0.75.
Protein concentrations were calculated by an A280 extinction coefficient of 258,015 M -1 cm -1 from a spectrophotometer. Global resolution estimation of the cryo-EM density maps were based on the Fourier Shell Correlation criterion.
