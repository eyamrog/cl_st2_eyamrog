Section: Abstract

The most aggressive B cell lymphomas frequently manifest extranodal distribution and carry somatic mutations in the poorly characterized gene TBL1XR1 . Here, we show that TBL1XR1 mutations skew the humoral immune response toward generating abnormal immature memory B cells (MB), while impairing plasma cell differentiation. At the molecular level, TBL1XR1 mutants co-opt SMRT/HDAC3 repressor complexes toward binding the MB cell transcription factor (TF) BACH2 at the expense of the germinal center (GC) TF BCL6, leading to pre-memory transcriptional reprogramming and cell-fate bias. Upon antigen recall, TBL1XR1 mutant MB cells fail to differentiate into plasma cells and instead preferentially reenter new GC reactions, providing evidence for a cyclic reentry lymphomagenesis mechanism. Ultimately, TBL1XR1 alterations lead to a striking extranodal immunoblastic lymphoma phenotype that mimics the human disease. Both human and murine lymphomas feature expanded MB-like cell populations, consistent with a MB-cell origin and delineating an unforeseen pathway for malignant transformation of the immune system.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are the most common class of lymphomas ( Beham-Schmid, 2017 10. Beham-Schmid, C. Aggressive lymphoma 2016: revision of the WHO classification Memo. 2017; 10 :248-254 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and likely represent a heterogeneous group of diseases arising from different immune system processes. Gene expression profiling studies classified DLBCLs into two major subtypes: germinal center B cell (GCB) and activated B cell (ABC)-DLBCLs. GCB-DLBCLs reflect the transcriptional signature of B cells that are transiting through the germinal center (GC) reaction ( Wright et al., 2003 109. Wright, G. ∙ Tan, B. ∙ Rosenwald, A. ... A gene expression-based method to diagnose clinically distinct subgroups of diffuse large B cell lymphoma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9991-9996 Crossref Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). GCs form transiently in response to T cell-dependent antigens and are composed of rapidly proliferating B cells that simultaneously undergo immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation (SHM). After transiting to a T cell-rich GC “light zone,” GCB expressing the highest affinity immunoglobulins undergo plasma cell (PC) differentiation, while others transition to forming memory B cells (reviewed in Cyster and Allen, 2019 22. Cyster, J.G. ∙ Allen, C.D.C. B Cell Responses: Cell Interaction Dynamics and Decisions Cell. 2019; 177 :524-540 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). ABC-DLCBLs are described as manifesting a “post-GC” transcriptional signature, and evidence of chronic active B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation is linked to somatic mutations in the BCR and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways ( Phelan et al., 2018 82. Phelan, J.D. ∙ Young, R.M. ∙ Webster, D.E. ... A multiprotein supercomplex controlling oncogenic signalling in lymphoma Nature. 2018; 560 :387-391 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wright et al., 2003 109. Wright, G. ∙ Tan, B. ∙ Rosenwald, A. ... A gene expression-based method to diagnose clinically distinct subgroups of diffuse large B cell lymphoma Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :9991-9996 Crossref Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the cell of origin (COO) and mechanisms of malignant transformation of ABC-DLBCLs remain poorly understood. From a clinical perspective, this is problematic, because these are among the most incurable and aggressive lymphomas ( Beham-Schmid, 2017 10. Beham-Schmid, C. Aggressive lymphoma 2016: revision of the WHO classification Memo. 2017; 10 :248-254 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ).
DLBCLs were more recently classified into putative distinct entities based on constellations of genetic lesions ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reddy et al., 2017 84. Reddy, A. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Davis, N.S. ... Genetic and Functional Drivers of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Cell. 2017; 171 :481-494 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitz et al., 2018 90. Schmitz, R. ∙ Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ... Genetics and Pathogenesis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :1396-1407 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two independent studies identified a novel genetically defined ABC-DLBCL subtype (“MCD” or “Cluster 5 [C5]” lymphomas) associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes, somatic activating mutations of MYD88 , CD79B , and recurrent mutation of the poorly characterized gene TBL1XR1 ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitz et al., 2018 90. Schmitz, R. ∙ Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ... Genetics and Pathogenesis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :1396-1407 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). TBL1XR 1 mutations are likely founder events, based on variant allele frequency ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). From the clinical and biological perspective, a striking feature of these lymphomas is their unusual extranodal distribution ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitz et al., 2018 90. Schmitz, R. ∙ Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ... Genetics and Pathogenesis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :1396-1407 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), invading sites like the CNS and testes ( Chapuy et al., 2016 15. Chapuy, B. ∙ Roemer, M.G. ∙ Stewart, C. ... Targetable genetic features of primary testicular and primary central nervous system lymphomas Blood. 2016; 127 :869-881 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gonzalez-Aguilar et al., 2012 31. Gonzalez-Aguilar, A. ∙ Idbaih, A. ∙ Boisselier, B. ... Recurrent mutations of MYD88 and TBL1XR1 in primary central nervous system lymphomas Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18 :5203-5211 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neither GCB nor PC normally home to these tissues, raising questions about the pathogenesis and origin of these tumors within the complex milieu of the immune system.
Congenital missense mutations in TBL1XR1 similar to those in lymphoma have also been linked to early-childhood developmental disorders, such as Pierpont syndrome ( Heinen et al., 2016 37. Heinen, C.A. ∙ Jongejan, A. ∙ Watson, P.J. ... A specific mutation in TBL1XR1 causes Pierpont syndrome J. Med. Genet. 2016; 53 :330-337 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laskowski et al., 2016 54. Laskowski, R.A. ∙ Tyagi, N. ∙ Johnson, D. ..., DDD Study Integrating population variation and protein structural analysis to improve clinical interpretation of missense variation: application to the WD40 domain Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25 :927-935 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggestive of TBL1XR1’s broad biological relevance. From the biochemical standpoint, TBL1XR1 is a core component of the SMRT/NCOR1 transcriptional repressor complexes ( Yoon et al., 2003 111. Yoon, H.G. ∙ Chan, D.W. ∙ Huang, Z.Q. ... Purification and functional characterization of the human N-CoR complex: the roles of HDAC3, TBL1 and TBLR1 EMBO J. 2003; 22 :1336-1346 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). These complexes also contain HDAC3, which enables the complex to repress transcription ( Hatzi et al., 2013 35. Hatzi, K. ∙ Jiang, Y. ∙ Huang, C. ... A hybrid mechanism of action for BCL6 in B cells defined by formation of functionally distinct complexes at enhancers and promoters Cell Rep. 2013; 4 :578-588 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Little is known about the exact role of TBL1XR1, which has been alternatively described as (1) enhancing the functionality ( Tomita et al., 2004 103. Tomita, A. ∙ Buchholz, D.R. ∙ Shi, Y.B. Recruitment of N-CoR/SMRT-TBLR1 corepressor complex by unliganded thyroid hormone receptor for gene repression during frog development Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24 :3337-3346 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), or (2) driving the disassembly ( Perissi et al., 2004 81. Perissi, V. ∙ Aggarwal, A. ∙ Glass, C.K. ... A corepressor/coactivator exchange complex required for transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and other regulated transcription factors Cell. 2004; 116 :511-526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ) of these complexes. Whichever the case, it is notable that in GCB the majority of SMRT/NCOR1 complexes are bound and recruited by the transcriptional repressor BCL6 ( Hatzi et al., 2013 35. Hatzi, K. ∙ Jiang, Y. ∙ Huang, C. ... A hybrid mechanism of action for BCL6 in B cells defined by formation of functionally distinct complexes at enhancers and promoters Cell Rep. 2013; 4 :578-588 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is essential for GC formation. Indeed, most recurrent mutations in DLBCL directly or indirectly enhance BCL6 functionality (reviewed in Hatzi and Melnick, 2014 34. Hatzi, K. ∙ Melnick, A. Breaking bad in the germinal center: how deregulation of BCL6 contributes to lymphomagenesis Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20 :343-352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), a driving force on which most of these tumors rely for their survival ( Cardenas et al., 2016 11. Cardenas, M.G. ∙ Yu, W. ∙ Beguelin, W. ... Rationally designed BCL6 inhibitors target activated B cell diffuse large B cell lymphoma J. Clin. Invest. 2016; 126 :3351-3362 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cerchietti et al., 2010 14. Cerchietti, L.C. ∙ Ghetu, A.F. ∙ Zhu, X. ... A small-molecule inhibitor of BCL6 kills DLBCL cells in vitro and in vivo Cancer Cell. 2010; 17 :400-411 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). TBL1XR1 mutations are thus highly intriguing, given their potential to affect SMRT/NCOR1 complexes, as well as BCL6, and the complete lack of information on how this might play out from the molecular and biological perspectives. Herein, we explore the mechanism of action of TBL1XR1 mutations, their impact on the humoral immune response, and whether they provide critical insight into the origin and immunological nature of aggressive extranodal MCD/C5 DLBCLs.

Section: Results

TBL1XR1 somatic mutations occur in ∼5%–10% of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma (FL) cases, mainly as heterozygous missense alleles ( Figure 1 A). In line with recent studies ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitz et al., 2018 90. Schmitz, R. ∙ Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ... Genetics and Pathogenesis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :1396-1407 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), our analysis of three independent DLBCL cohorts confirmed that mutations occur more frequently in ABC-DLBCL ( Table S1 ; Data S1 A), are highly enriched in the MCD subtype ( Data S1 B), and often co-occur with MYD88 mutations ( Data S1 C). TBL1XR1 mutations largely occur within its WD40 domain ( Figures 1 A and 1B) and affect aromatic residues exposed on the same surface of the barrel structure ( Figure 1 B) that are predicted to mediate protein-protein interactions (PPI) ( Wang et al., 2015 105. Wang, Y. ∙ Hu, X.J. ∙ Zou, X.D. ... WDSPdb: a database for WD40-repeat proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :D339-D344 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Faced with the lack of a clear hotspot, we decided to model the D370Y allele in mice given it occurs both in lymphomas and congenital developmental disorders ( Laskowski et al., 2016 54. Laskowski, R.A. ∙ Tyagi, N. ∙ Johnson, D. ..., DDD Study Integrating population variation and protein structural analysis to improve clinical interpretation of missense variation: application to the WD40 domain Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25 :927-935 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggestive of its biological relevance. The Tbl1xr1 locus was engineered for conditional expression of D370Y ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Because TBL1XR1 MUT lymphomas are derived from GC or post-GC B cells ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ), we crossed Tbl1xr1 D370Y mice to the C γ 1Cre strain ( Casola et al., 2006 12. Casola, S. ∙ Cattoretti, G. ∙ Uyttersprot, N. ... Tracking germinal center B cells expressing germ-line immunoglobulin gamma1 transcripts by conditional gene targeting Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :7396-7401 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ) to restrict D370Y expression to (pre)GCB and GC-derived cells. Sorted GCB manifested the correct Tbl1xr1 genotype ( Figure S1 C) and showed no difference in overall Tbl1xr1 mRNA or protein abundance ( Figures S1 D and S1E).
Given a previous report suggesting that TBL1XR1 might limit SMRT functionality ( Perissi et al., 2004 81. Perissi, V. ∙ Aggarwal, A. ∙ Glass, C.K. ... A corepressor/coactivator exchange complex required for transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and other regulated transcription factors Cell. 2004; 116 :511-526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that TBL1XR1 MUT would further enhance the activity of BCL6-SMRT complexes. We immunized Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT (D370Y/WT) or Tbl1xr1 WT/WT (wild-type [WT]) mice with the T cell-dependent antigen sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and sacrificed them at the peak of the GC reaction. Unexpectedly, although B cell abundance remained unaltered in D370Y/WT mice ( Figure 1 C; Data S1 D and S1E), these animals showed significant decrease in the absolute number (p value = 0.0008; Data S1 E) and proportion (p value = 0.0006; Figure 1 D) of FAS + GL7 + GCB. Similar results were observed gating GCB as FAS + CD38 − ( Data S1 F). Animals showed no disruption of splenic architecture ( Figure 1 E). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for B cells (B220) and GCB (peanut agglutinin, PNA) revealed normal follicular structures with smaller GCs in D370Y/WT mice, but conserved GC numbers per spleen ( Figures 1 F–1H). Dark zone (DZ) centroblasts (CB) and light zone (LZ) centrocytes (CC) ratios were similar to WT ( Data S1 G).
Although D370Y/WT GC were smaller, it is possible that these GCB could be fitter when in direct competition. We performed mixed chimera experiments where equal numbers of Cd45.2;Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT or Cd45.1/2;Tbl1xr1 WT/WT bone marrow (BM) cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated syngeneic recipients. Following immunization, the relative proportions of Cd45.1 and Cd45.1/2 B220 + cells were roughly equal, but D370Y/WT GCB manifested significant disadvantage compared to WT ( Figure 1 I), regardless of the initial ratio of transferred cells ( Data S1 H). Immunization with hapten-protein conjugates yielded similar results ( Data S1 I). Observations were also not dependent on the Cd45 allelic variant, because identical results were obtained with Cd45.1;Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT ( Data S1 J).
To study the possibility of a premature/delayed GC burst as explanation for the reduced GC size, we crossed D370Y/WT mice to include a Rosa26lox-stop-loxYFP ( Rosa26YFP ) allele, which reports on Cre activity ( Figure 1 J; Data S1 K). D370Y/WT mice presented reduced GCB abundance at all time points ( Figure 1 K; Data S1 L), and GCs completely resolved by day 25. Collectively, these data indicate that Tbl1xr1 mutation impairs, rather than enhances, the GC reaction (perhaps by hindering BCL6 function), while maintaining normal kinetics.
The absence of a clear hotspot suggests that TBL1XR1 mutations behave as loss-of-function (LOF). Along these lines, focal TBL1XR1 deletions are also detected in DLBCL patients ( Data S1 M) ( Schmitz et al., 2018 90. Schmitz, R. ∙ Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ... Genetics and Pathogenesis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :1396-1407 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), albeit at lower frequency than missense mutations. We then generated a C γ 1Cre -inducible Tbl1xr1 knockout (KO) mouse ( Figures S1 F–S1I) and again observed that although total B cell abundance was unchanged ( Figures S1 J and S1L), there was significant GCB reduction in immunized Tbl1xr1 KO/KO (KO/KO) mice ( Figures S1 K and S1L; Data S1 N). There was no disruption of splenic architecture or lymphoid follicles ( Figure S1 M), although there was significant reduction in GC size, but not GC number ( Figures S1 N–S1P). Mixed chimera experiments confirmed that KO/KO GCB are at disadvantage against WT ( Figure S1 Q). The kinetics of the GC reaction in KO/KO mice were similar to WT, but were again consistently hypoplastic ( Figure S1 R). Finally, KO/KO GCs showed normal ratios of LZ-DZ GCB ( Data S1 O).
The fact that KO/KO phenocopies D370Y/WT supports the idea that Tbl1xr1 mutations confer LOF and suggests mutations may have a dominant negative (DN) character. Along these lines, GC formation appeared normal in heterozygous Tbl1xr1 KO/WT mice ( Figure 1 L) and did not recapitulate the phenotype induced by D370Y/WT, which instead was virtually identical to KO/KO. This strongly suggests that TBL1XR1 mutants function as DN LOF alleles.
Apoptosis is prevalent in the GC, with up to half GCBs dying every 6 h ( Mayer et al., 2017 63. Mayer, C.T. ∙ Gazumyan, A. ∙ Kara, E.E. ... The microanatomic segregation of selection by apoptosis in the germinal center Science. 2017; 358 :eaao2602 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). D370Y/WT manifested similar frequency of apoptotic/dead cells to WT GCB, by AnnexinV/DAPI FC ( Figure 2 A; Data S1 P) or TUNEL staining ( Figure 2 B). Similar findings were observed for KO/KO ( Figure S2 A). On the other hand, there was significant reduction in D370Y/WT GCB positive for the proliferation marker PCNA ( Figure 2 C). Abundance of T follicular helper cells (T FH ), which express CD40 ligand and induce GCB proliferation, was comparable in mutant and WT mice ( Figure S2 B). To assess for intrinsic defects in response to CD40 stimulation, we performed ex vivo activation of mixed D370Y/WT and WT naive B (NB) cells in organoid cultures ( Béguelin et al., 2017 9. Béguelin, W. ∙ Rivas, M.A. ∙ Calvo Fernández, M.T. ... EZH2 enables germinal centre formation through epigenetic silencing of CDKN1A and an Rb-E2F1 feedback loop Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :877 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 C). D370Y/WT and WT B cells acquired GC surface markers to approximately the same extent ( Figure S2 D), without significant differences in proliferation rate ( Figure S2 E). Hence, proliferation of D370Y/WT B cells is not impaired when given unrestricted CD40 stimulation.
To assess cell-cycle kinetics, we tested ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation in immunized D370Y/WT or WT mice. In line with PCNA staining, EdU + GCB were significantly depleted in D370Y/WT ( Figure 2 D), with a significant increase in GCB at the G0-1 stage, and reciprocal reduction in S and G2/M ( Figure 2 E). Similar results were observed for KO/KO ( Figures S2 F and S2G). As an orthogonal approach, D370Y/WT animals were crossed with R26-Fucci2aR reporter mice ( Figure 2 F; Data S1 Q). In line with previous studies ( Stewart et al., 2018 98. Stewart, I. ∙ Radtke, D. ∙ Phillips, B. ... Germinal Center B Cells Replace Their Antigen Receptors in Dark Zones and Fail Light Zone Entry when Immunoglobulin Gene Mutations are Damaging Immunity. 2018; 49 :477-489 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), most CC in WT mice were at G0-1, and D370Y/WT had no significant impact on cell-cycle distribution ( Figure 2 G). As expected, WT CB showed high abundance of G2/M cells and fewer cells in G0-1 ( Figure 2 H). In contrast, D370Y/WT CB manifested significant reduction in the proportion of G2/M and late M cells, as well as increase in G0-1 ( Figure 2 H). BCL6 represses cell-cycle checkpoint genes in GCB ( Hatzi and Melnick, 2014 34. Hatzi, K. ∙ Melnick, A. Breaking bad in the germinal center: how deregulation of BCL6 contributes to lymphomagenesis Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20 :343-352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), but D370Y/WT or KO/KO CC showed no induction of these genes ( Figure S2 H), suggesting that proliferation effects are driven by a different mechanism. Impairment in proliferation largely explains the reduced abundance of GCB in Tbl1xr1 mutant and KO/KO mice.
Although most DLBCL mutations engineered in mice induce GC hyperplasia ( Béguelin et al., 2013 8. Béguelin, W. ∙ Popovic, R. ∙ Teater, M. ...

Histone demethylase LSD1 is required for germinal center formation and BCL6-driven lymphomagenesis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :86-96 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), the Tbl1xr1 phenotype was opposite and counter-intuitive as a lymphoma lesion. To gain mechanistic insight, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in sorted D370Y/WT GCB. Unsupervised analysis revealed that D370Y/WT induces a distinct transcriptome ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Supervised analysis identified a D370Y/WT specific signature (|log 2 FC| > 1.5; false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05), skewed toward gene de-repression ( Figure 3 A; Table S2 ). Pathway analysis revealed enrichment for ABC-DLBCL associated signatures ( Figure 3 B; Table S2 ), as well as pathways involved in chemotaxis, immune cytokine, and NF-κB signaling, all of which are repressed in GCB by BCL6-SMRT ( Figure 3 B). Accordingly, we observed significant enrichment for genes repressed through BCL6-SMRT enhancer binding, genes induced by BCL6 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and CREBBP target genes (CREBBP normally reverses BCL6-SMRT effects in the LZ) ( Jiang et al., 2017 43. Jiang, Y. ∙ Ortega-Molina, A. ∙ Geng, H. ... CREBBP Inactivation Promotes the Development of HDAC3-Dependent Lymphomas Cancer Discov. 2017; 7 :38-53 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 B). This suggests that TBL1XR1 plays a critical role in supporting the function of the BCL6-SMRT complex. Repression of EBI2 ( GPR183 ) and S1PR1 by BCL6 is largely responsible for GCB confinement to lymphoid follicles ( Arnon et al., 2013 3. Arnon, T.I. ∙ Horton, R.M. ∙ Grigorova, I.L. ... Visualization of splenic marginal zone B-cell shuttling and follicular B-cell egress Nature. 2013; 493 :684-688 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pereira et al., 2009 80. Pereira, J.P. ∙ Kelly, L.M. ∙ Xu, Y. ... EBI2 mediates B cell segregation between the outer and centre follicle Nature. 2009; 460 :1122-1126 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas they reactivate in cells exiting the GC. D370Y/WT GCB upregulated Gpr183 and S1pr1 ( Figures 3 A, S3 C, and S3D), raising the possibility that TBL1XR1 MUT drive GCB to manifest post-GC phenotypes.
D370Y/WT GCB showed upregulation of Cd38 ( Figures 3 A and S3 C), a gene that in mice is upregulated in MB, but not in PC ( Oliver et al., 1997 77. Oliver, A.M. ∙ Martin, F. ∙ Kearney, J.F. Mouse CD38 is down-regulated on germinal center B cells and mature plasma cells J. Immunol. 1997; 158 :1108-1115 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Ridderstad and Tarlinton, 1998 85. Ridderstad, A. ∙ Tarlinton, D.M. Kinetics of establishing the memory B cell population as revealed by CD38 expression J. Immunol. 1998; 160 :4688-4695 PubMed Google Scholar ). Upregulation of CD38 is also a feature of precursor MBs (preMB) in the GC ( Laidlaw et al., 2017 53. Laidlaw, B.J. ∙ Schmidt, T.H. ∙ Green, J.A. ... The Eph-related tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-B1 marks germinal center and memory precursor B cells J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :639-649 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). PreMB were alternatively defined as LZ GCB with augmented expression of CCR6 ( Suan et al., 2017 99. Suan, D. ∙ Krautler, N.J. ∙ Maag, J.L.V. ... CCR6 Defines Memory B Cell Precursors in Mouse and Human Germinal Centers, Revealing Light-Zone Location and Predominant Low Antigen Affinity Immunity. 2017; 47 :1142-1153 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), a receptor upregulated in D370Y/WT and KO/KO GCB ( Figures 3 A, 3C, S3 C, and S3E). A third study defined preMB as cell-cycle arrested interleukin (IL)-9R + GCB ( Wang et al., 2017b 107. Wang, Y. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ Yan, J. ... Germinal-center development of memory B cells driven by IL-9 from follicular helper T cells Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), traits present in D370Y/WT and KO/KO mice ( Figures 3 A, 3D, S2 G, S3 C, and S3F). Accordingly, we observed enrichment of the D370Y/WT signature among transcriptional profiles of preMB cells in these reports ( Figures 3 E, S3 G, and S3H).
Immunophenotypic analysis of D370Y/WT GCs revealed marked and significant increase in preMB at all studied time points (p value = 0.0045) ( Figures 3 F and S3 I), and also with independent antigens ( Figure S3 J). PreMB expansion was also seen for KO/KO ( Figure 3 G; Data S1 R), but not for Tbl1xr1 KO/WT ( Data S1 S), supporting that TBL1XR1 mutations act as DN LOF. Given that D370Y/WT and KO/KO GCB showed significant Il9r upregulation, which plays a role in MB formation ( Wang et al., 2017b 107. Wang, Y. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ Yan, J. ... Germinal-center development of memory B cells driven by IL-9 from follicular helper T cells Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested whether IL-9 blockade would rescue the observed phenotype ( Figure 3 H). Strikingly, blockade of IL-9R function reverted the KO/KO-driven preMB expansion ( Figure 3 I). Although total B cells were not affected by IL-9 blockage ( Figure 3 J), there was partial rescue of GC impairment in KO/KO mice ( Figure 3 K), concomitant with increased GCB proliferation ( Data S1 T). Hence, preMB expansion downstream of TBL1XR1 deficiency remains dependent on key MB signaling pathways.
We next explored whether preMB expansion translated into bias toward MB. D370Y/WT GCB transcriptome showed strong enrichment for MB gene signatures, but no enrichment for PC genes ( Figures 4 A and 4B) ( Luckey et al., 2006 60. Luckey, C.J. ∙ Bhattacharya, D. ∙ Goldrath, A.W. ... Memory T and memory B cells share a transcriptional program of self-renewal with long-term hematopoietic stem cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :3304-3309 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement, GCB expression of the master PC TF BLIMP1 was not affected by Tbl1x1 mutation or loss ( Figures S4 A and S4B). To confirm these findings, we used a mixed chimera approach with Rosa26YFP;Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT versus Rosa26YFP;Tbl1xr1 WT/WT cells to track GC and post-GC cells ( Figure 4 C; additional mice were administered CD40-blocking antibodies). D370Y/WT splenocytes revealed a lower percentage of YFP + cells ( Figure 4 D). As expected, most YFP + cells corresponded to GCB (B220 + CD138 − GL7 + FAS + ), which were reduced in the D370Y/WT compartment ( Figures 4 E and S4 C; Data S1 U). On the other hand, D370Y/WT cells showed significant increase in MB (B220 + CD138 − FAS -/lo GL7 − CD38 + IgD − ), and a concomitant reduction in plasmablasts (PB) (B220 + CD138 + ) and PC (B220 − CD138 + ) ( Figures 4 E and S4 C). Experiments with Rosa26YFP;Tbl1xr1 KO/KO mice yielded the same phenotype ( Figures S4 D and S4E).
GCB with intermediate affinity BCRs tend to become MB cells after T cell help, whereas high-affinity GCBs receive strong T cell help, causing GCBs to differentiate into PCs or recycle to the DZ ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 94. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD40-blocking antibodies in mixed chimeras ( Figure 4 C) led to profound reduction in GCBs, as expected ( Baumjohann et al., 2013 7. Baumjohann, D. ∙ Preite, S. ∙ Reboldi, A. ... Persistent antigen and germinal center B cells sustain T follicular helper cell responses and phenotype Immunity. 2013; 38 :596-605 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ), to the point where differences in YFP + cell abundance among D370Y/WT and WT were lost ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Reduction of CD40 input drove the majority of the remaining D370Y/WT GC-derived B cells to the MB compartment. In contrast, the majority of residual WT cells were IgD + activated B cells (“aB”) that presumably had not yet entered the GC reaction. No PCs were identified in this setting from D370Y/WT, suggesting that the MB cell fate is hardwired into the mutant B cells ( Figure 4 G).
Because PC formation is a rather late event in the GC ( Weisel et al., 2016 108. Weisel, F.J. ∙ Zuccarino-Catania, G.V. ∙ Chikina, M. ... A Temporal Switch in the Germinal Center Determines Differential Output of Memory B and Plasma Cells Immunity. 2016; 44 :116-130 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ), we evaluated whether commitment bias was also detectable at later time points. To this end, used an adoptive transfer system to quantify antigen-specific MB and PC 24 days after immunization ( Figure 4 H; Data S1 V). Assessment of NP-specific populations again showed that D370Y/WT biased cell fate toward MB, at the expense of PC ( Figure 4 H). Finally, assessment of long-lived PC (LLPC) in the BM, 70 days after immunization of Rosa26YFP;Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT mice, revealed that although the abundance of total LLPC was unaltered, D370Y/WT had less GC-derived LLPC than WT mice ( Figure 4 I).
TBL1XR1 is a core component of the SMRT/NCOR1 complex, which in GCB is recruited to chromatin by BCL6 ( Hatzi et al., 2013 35. Hatzi, K. ∙ Jiang, Y. ∙ Huang, C. ... A hybrid mechanism of action for BCL6 in B cells defined by formation of functionally distinct complexes at enhancers and promoters Cell Rep. 2013; 4 :578-588 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that TBL1XR1 is also present in chromatin-bound BCL6 complexes, by RIME- liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) ( Figure S5 A; Table S3 ). Interaction of endogenous TBL1XR1 with the SMRT/HDAC3 complex and BCL6 was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) ( Figure S5 B). In other systems, TBL1XR1 can have SMRT-independent functions ( Li and Wang, 2008 56. Li, J. ∙ Wang, C.Y. TBL1-TBLR1 and beta-catenin recruit each other to Wnt target-gene promoter for transcription activation and oncogenesis Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10 :160-169 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore performed proximity ligation-mass spectrometry (BioID) for TBL1XR1 WT interacting partners in GC-derived cell lines ( Figure S5 C). The majority of significantly interacting proteins for TBL1XR1 WT were restricted to components of the SMRT complex ( Figure 5 A; Table S3 ). In addition to these, only BCL6 and another BTB-domain containing TF (BACH2), appeared as significant hits ( Figure 5 A), largely ruling out alternative functions for TBL1XR1 WT in GC-derived B cells.
To assess whether TBL1XR1 mutations alter its interactome, we conducted additional assays modeling one of the most recurrent DLBCL mutations (TBL1XR1 Y446S ) ( Figure 1 A). Surprisingly, although the interaction with SMRT/HDAC3 complex was preserved, the only significant change in the TBL1XR1 MUT interactome was ∼6-fold gain of interaction with BACH2, at the expense of BCL6 ( Figure 5 B). Similar results were obtained in an ABC-DLBCL cell line ( Figures 5 C and S5 C; Table S3 ) and in HEK293 cells (not shown). Assessment of three independent TBL1XR1 mutants by coIP confirmed gain of interaction with BACH2 ( Figure 5 D) and loss of interaction with BCL6 ( Figure S5 D) without alteration of total protein levels ( Figures S5 D and S5E).
In accordance with these data, genes de-repressed in D370Y/WT GCB in vivo , matched those repressed by BCL6 ( Figure 5 E). Because Tbl1xr1 mutation did not affect BCL6 expression levels ( Figure S5 F), this suggested interference at the functional level. To test this, we crossed D370Y/WT mice to the IμBcl6 strain, which constitutively expresses BCL6 in GCB and manifests GC hyperplasia ( Cattoretti et al., 2005 13. Cattoretti, G. ∙ Pasqualucci, L. ∙ Ballon, G. ... Deregulated BCL6 expression recapitulates the pathogenesis of human diffuse large B cell lymphomas in mice Cancer Cell. 2005; 7 :445-455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, IμBcl6 mice manifested GC hyperplasia after immunization ( Figures 5 F and 5G; Data S1 W), which, in the presence of the Tbl1xr1 D370Y , was rescued back to the levels of the WT control ( Figures 5 F and 5G). As reported above in a WT background, IμBcl6-Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT GCB manifested a preMB-like transcriptome ( Table S4 ; Data S1 X) and actual preMB expansion ( Data S1 Y). In agreement with our biochemical data, we observed enrichment for a BACH2-driven signature in IμBcl6-Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT GCB ( Figure 5 H) and significant depletion of the BCL6 program ( Figure 5 I). BACH2 is reported to be a key TF in MB formation ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 94. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our data suggest that TBL1XR1 mutations mistarget the SMRT complex to BACH2, thus inducing preferential transcriptional rewiring toward MB, while preventing PC formation by maintaining BACH2 repression of BLIMP1 ( Data S1 Z) ( Huang et al., 2014 40. Huang, C. ∙ Geng, H. ∙ Boss, I. ... Cooperative transcriptional repression by BCL6 and BACH2 in germinal center B-cell differentiation Blood. 2014; 123 :1012-1020 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ochiai et al., 2006 75. Ochiai, K. ∙ Katoh, Y. ∙ Ikura, T. ... Plasmacytic transcription factor Blimp-1 is repressed by Bach2 in B cells J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :38226-38234 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Transcriptional profiling of KO/KO GCB likewise enriched both preMB and IμBcl6-Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT signatures ( Figures S5 G and S5H; Table S4 ). More importantly, it recapitulated the upregulation of BCL6 targets ( Figure 5 J), and engagement of BACH2-driven program ( Figure 5 K). KO/KO did not affect BCL6 expression in GCB ( Figure S5 I) but was able to rescue BCL6-induced hyperplasia in IμBcl6 GCs ( Figure 5 L). To assess SMRT/HDAC3 shuttling at the biochemical level, we developed TBL1XR1-KO variants of a GC-derived lymphoma cell line using CRISPR.Cas9 ( Figure S5 J). Similar to primary GCB, these clones showed impaired proliferation ( Figure S5 K). Notably, TBLXR1-KO resulted in loss of BCL6-SMRT/HDAC3 interaction and gain in BACH2-SMRT/HDAC3 Co-IP ( Figure S5 L). TBL1XR1 is thus critical for the preferential association of SMRT with BCL6 in GCBs, and its LOF induces preferential interaction with BACH2 ( Data S1 AA), thus explaining the GC impairment and MB cell fate bias.
MB reentry into the GC has been proposed as a putative mechanism of GC-derived lymphomagenesis ( Sungalee et al., 2014 101. Sungalee, S. ∙ Mamessier, E. ∙ Morgado, E. ... Germinal center reentries of BCL2-overexpressing B cells drive follicular lymphoma progression J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 :5337-5351 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given our findings, we postulated that Tbl1xr1 mutation might generate aberrant MBs with capacity for preferential reentry into new GCs. To explore whether D370Y/WT MBs persisted over time, we immunized mice with NP-CGG and sacrificed long after GC resolution, which revealed long-lasting expansion of NP-specific MB in spleen and BM ( Figures 6 A and 6B; Data S1 BB–S1CC). A subset of non-class switched MB cells in humans is proposed to re-seed GCs upon recall, while switched MB differentiate into Ig-secreting cells ( Dogan et al., 2009 25. Dogan, I. ∙ Bertocci, B. ∙ Vilmont, V. ... Multiple layers of B cell memory with different effector functions Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10 :1292-1299 Crossref Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ). D370Y/WT and KO/KO GCB showed significant restriction in class-switch recombination (CSR), with a relative increase in IgM + and reduction in IgG1 + cells ( Figures 6 C and S6 A). This was not due to delayed kinetics, because later time points showed similar isotype representation ( Figure S6 B), nor was it due to an impairment in Aicda induction ( Figures S6 C–S6E). The CSR restriction was also evident in GC-derived MB, tracked with the Rosa26YFP reporter ( Figures 6 D and S6 F; Data S1 EE). In accordance with surface Ig profiles, NP-OVA immunized D370Y/WT and KO/KO mice showed impaired IgG1 antibody responses ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Still, affinity maturation was not significantly affected ( Figures S6 I and S6J), nor were there differences in Ig SHM burden between D370Y/WT and WT GCB ( Figure S6 K), further suggesting that AID activity was not compromised.
In mice, CD80 − PDL2 − MBs, which are mostly IgM + , show a higher capacity for GC reentry, while CD80 + PDL2 + MB are generally class-switched, and tend to differentiate into PC ( Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014 115. Zuccarino-Catania, G.V. ∙ Sadanand, S. ∙ Weisel, F.J. ... CD80 and PD-L2 define functionally distinct memory B cell subsets that are independent of antibody isotype Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :631-637 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Profiling of donor-derived antigen-specific MB cells (CD45.1 + CD138 − B220 + IgD − NP + ) from an adoptive transfer system revealed that D370Y/WT MB were significantly over-represented in the CD80 − PDL2 − population ( Figure 6 E). Most D370Y/WT MB were also IgM + , further confirming a CSR restriction ( Figure S6 L).
Results above suggest that TBL1XR1 MUT might predispose MB for GC reentry upon recall. To test this, we conducted secondary adoptive transfer experiments ( Figure 6 F), where sorted D370Y/WT or WT antigen-specific MB were transferred in equal numbers into μMT recipient mice, along with OT-II memory T cells to boost MB recall ( Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014 115. Zuccarino-Catania, G.V. ∙ Sadanand, S. ∙ Weisel, F.J. ... CD80 and PD-L2 define functionally distinct memory B cell subsets that are independent of antibody isotype Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :631-637 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). μMT mice lack mature B cells and antigen-specific antibodies ( Kitamura et al., 1991 47. Kitamura, D. ∙ Roes, J. ∙ Kühn, R. ... A B cell-deficient mouse by targeted disruption of the membrane exon of the immunoglobulin mu chain gene Nature. 1991; 350 :423-426 Crossref Scopus (1459) PubMed Google Scholar ), allowing specific detection of those coming from transferred cells. Recall was assessed 3.5 days after immunization of recipients, to exclude confounding factors such as differences in GC expansion that might occur later on. D370Y/WT transferred cells (NP + CD45.1 + ) ( Figure S6 M) persisted largely as B220 + ( Figure 6 G) and over 70% of these were FAS + GL7 + ( Figure 6 H). The relative total abundance of GCB was almost 2-fold higher in animals transferred with mutant MB than those receiving WT MB ( Figure 6 H), indicating that D370Y/WT favors MB reentry into new GC reactions. In contrast, ∼50% of the WT cells downregulated B220 ( Figure 6 G), consistent with PC differentiation, as evidenced by CD138 upregulation in some of these ( Figure 6 I). Terminal differentiation of D370Y/WT MB into PC was practically null at the assessed time point ( Figure 6 I). In agreement, only WT MB led to a detectable secretory recall response in the form of high-affinity IgG1/Lambda Ig ( Figure 6 J). These data suggest that TBL1XR1 MUT causes aberrant expansion of persisting MB and provides the first evidence that a lymphoma mutation can drive preferential reentry of putative clonal precursor cells into subsequent immune reactions.
Because TBL1XR1-driven transformation may require GC reentry over an extended period of time, incompatible with mice lifespan ( Sungalee et al., 2014 101. Sungalee, S. ∙ Mamessier, E. ∙ Morgado, E. ... Germinal center reentries of BCL2-overexpressing B cells drive follicular lymphoma progression J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 :5337-5351 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used CD19cre to increase the frequency of mature B cells carrying Tbl1xr1 alterations. This did not affect B cell development ( Data S1 EE–S1GG) and recapitulated the Cγ1Cre phenotype ( Figures S7 A–S7D). Because C5/MCD carry near-uniform 18q gain and high BCL2 levels ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wright et al., 2020 110. Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ∙ Phelan, J.D. ... A Probabilistic Classification Tool for Genetic Subtypes of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma with Therapeutic Implications Cancer Cell. 2020; 37 :551-568.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ), we further crossed our animals with VavP - Bcl2 mice ( Ogilvy et al., 1999 76. Ogilvy, S. ∙ Metcalf, D. ∙ Print, C.G. ... Constitutive Bcl-2 expression throughout the hematopoietic compartment affects multiple lineages and enhances progenitor cell survival Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :14943-14948 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ) to phenocopy this effect. We generated cohorts of VavP-Bcl2;CD19Cre;Tbl1xr1 KO/KO and VavP-Bcl2;CD19Cre;Tbl1xr1 WT/WT mice and immunized them periodically to make sure they generated GCs ( Figure 7 A). Mice were sacrificed at a time point when VavP-Bcl2 animals show pre-tumoral lymphoproliferation ( Egle et al., 2004 27. Egle, A. ∙ Harris, A.W. ∙ Bath, M.L. ... VavP-Bcl2 transgenic mice develop follicular lymphoma preceded by germinal center hyperplasia Blood. 2004; 103 :2276-2283 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although all KO/KO animals had developed macroscopic tumors at necropsy, most with extranodal localization such as kidney, lung, liver, and intestines ( Figure 7 B), no masses were found in controls. Splenic hyperplasia was evident in all animals but was exacerbated in KO/KO ( Figure 7 C). Splenocytes in the control group had the expected representation of T cells (CD3 + ) and B cells (B220 + ) ( Figure 7 D) but a massive over-representation of GCB ( Figure 7 E). In contrast, KO/KO manifested an expansion of B220 − cells ( Figure 7 D). The few remaining B220 + KO/KO cells lacked GCB markers for the most part but showed relative expansion of (pre)MB populations ( Figures 7 F and 7G; Data S1 HH–S1II). B220 − KO/KO cells, in turn, expressed higher, albeit variable, levels of CD138 than the controls ( Figure 7 H). Both groups showed comparable levels of mature B cells in their BM, suggesting the phenotype was not linked to an early-stage developmental impairment ( Data S1 JJ–S1KK).
Histological analysis of lymphoid and other tissues in KO/KO mice revealed predominantly large and highly atypical immunoblasts, often with large and irregularly shaped nuclei and a moderate amount of cytoplasm, mimicking the appearance of human extranodal ABC-DLBCLs ( Figure S7 E). In the spleen, these cells were seen predominantly outside the follicles in the red pulp, disrupting the splenic architecture ( Figure 7 I). These cells also extensively infiltrated and distorted many tissues including liver ( Figure 7 J) and kidneys ( Figure 7 K). Consistent with this extranodal scenario, lymph nodes (LN) were only focally involved. Immunoblastic cells in KO/KO specimens were virtually all Ki67 + and many stained for CD138 ( Figures S7 F and S7G), consistent with the notion that TBL1XR1 loss results in a post-GC lymphoma phenotype. In comparison, the overall architecture of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and lung was relatively intact for Tbl1xr1 WT/WT ( Figures 7 I–7K), although LNs showed variable sinusoidal expansion by smaller infiltrating lymphocytes. Analysis of tissues yielded sporadic, small, focal lymphocytic infiltrates linked to blood vessels ( Figures 7 J and 7K) in the LN, spleen, and BM that rarely affected tissue architecture ( Figure 7 I and not shown). IHC revealed infiltrates were composed of T and B cells, as well as PC ( Figures S7 F and S7G). Ki67 stain was low for small plasmacytoid cells/plasma cells and lymphoid cells and higher in the few larger cells ( Figures S7 F and S7G). To assess whether the disease translated into accelerated lethality, we conducted a survival study in an additional cohort of mice, immunized to induce GC formation ( Figure 7 L). The study revealed that KO/KO mice died of their disease significantly sooner than WT ( Figure 7 M).
Human C5/MCD DLBCLs show the highest AID footprint ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting they originate from GC-transitioned cells. We examined Ig SHM in our KO/KO mouse lymphomas, to exclude that these derived from extrafollicular responses. Sequencing of intron J H 4 revealed significant SHM burden in tumors that was absent in Acida KO/KO GCB used as controls ( Figure 7 N). We then performed targeted sequencing of a region in the Pim1 locus frequently impacted by off-target AID activity ( Liu et al., 2008 58. Liu, M. ∙ Duke, J.L. ∙ Richter, D.J. ... Two levels of protection for the B cell genome during somatic hypermutation Nature. 2008; 451 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ), because PIM1 mutations are a hallmark of C5/MCD tumors and frequently co-occur with TBL1XR1 mutations ( Data S1 C). Notably, KO/KO tumors accumulated more mutations than VavP-Bcl2 controls ( Figure 7 O). Strikingly, the highest rate of off-target mutations was detected in extranodal tumors from KO/KO mice ( Figure 7 O). To further confirm that these lymphomas could arise from GCB, we generated C γ 1Cre;VavP-Bcl2;Tbl1xr1 KO/KO mice. These mice again showed extensive extranodal infiltrates, composed of a heterogeneous mixture of lymphocytic and immunoblastic populations ( Figure S7 H), with a higher percentage of B220 + cells than the CD19Cre variant ( Figure S7 I). Hence, the more homogeneous plasmacytic-like presentation in CD19Cre mice is not required for transformation or extranodal dissemination of malignant B cells but might instead represent a later or alternative stage in disease progression. These data are consistent with TBL1XR1 driving MCD/C5 pathogenesis by inducing MB cell reentry into successive GC reactions.
If MB served as COO for C5/MCD lymphomas, we would expect to find phenotypic evidence in clinical specimens. In humans, CD38 is expressed in GCB and PC, but lost in MB ( Arpin et al., 1995 4. Arpin, C. ∙ Déchanet, J. ∙ Van Kooten, C. ... Generation of memory B cells and plasma cells in vitro Science. 1995; 268 :720-722 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Performing IHC in a DLBCL patient's cohort ( Arthur et al., 2018 5. Arthur, S.E. ∙ Jiang, A. ∙ Grande, B.M. ... Genome-wide discovery of somatic regulatory variants in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4001 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed that although ∼40% of all TBL1XR1 WT DLBCLs were CD38 + , only ∼10% of TBL1XR1 MUT cases were CD38 + (p = 0.03) ( Figure S7 J). We further subclassified ( Wright et al., 2020 110. Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ∙ Phelan, J.D. ... A Probabilistic Classification Tool for Genetic Subtypes of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma with Therapeutic Implications Cancer Cell. 2020; 37 :551-568.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ) tumors in this cohort and observed significant and striking differences between MCD cases (0% CD38 + ) and non-MCD ABC-DLBCL cases (∼30% CD38 + ) (p = 0.01) ( Figure 7 P).
To further support the notion that C5/MCD reflects a MB COO, we conducted CyTOF on patients from an independent DLBCL cohort ( Table S6 ) ( Nissen et al., 2019 72. Nissen, M.D. ∙ Kusakabe, M. ∙ Wang, X. ... Single Cell Phenotypic Profiling of 27 DLBCL Cases Reveals Marked Intertumoral and Intratumoral Heterogeneity Cytometry A. 2019; Published online October 22, 2019 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells from reactive LN specimens were used to define B cell subpopulations. In these samples, GCB were identified as CD10 hi CD38 hi , whereas MB showed lower levels of these markers and distinctive CD27 upregulation ( Figure 7 Q) ( Agematsu et al., 2000 1. Agematsu, K. ∙ Hokibara, S. ∙ Nagumo, H. ... CD27: a memory B-cell marker Immunol. Today. 2000; 21 :204-206 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). GCB-DLBCL cases, included as controls, mapped to GCB reference populations (not shown). In contrast, ABC-DLBCL tumors carrying TBL1XR1 and MCD/C5 canonical mutations narrowly recapitulate the surface marker profile of MB cells ( Figure 7 R). The MB profile was also observed in MCD DLBCLs without TBL1XR1 mutations ( Figure 7 S), consistent with the notion that MCD tumors arise from MB, albeit through distinct mutational trajectories. Collectively, we find that TBL1XR1 LOF drives expansion of aberrant MB cells with enhanced tendency to reenter GC reactions, ultimately resulting in canonical post-GC extranodal ABC-DLBCL with MB-like features and revealing the manner in which these tumors arise naturally from the humoral immune response.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Here, we show how TBL1XR1 mutations result in transcriptional re-wiring of GCB cells to drive lymphomagenesis. A previous report noted TBL1XR1 interaction with BCL6 in a lymphoma cell line, using mass spectrometry ( Miles et al., 2005 65. Miles, R.R. ∙ Crockett, D.K. ∙ Lim, M.S. ... Analysis of BCL6-interacting proteins by tandem mass spectrometry Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4 :1898-1909 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed that TBL1XR1 forms complexes with BCL6 at the chromatin level, and its interactome is largely confined to the SMRT complex and the TFs BCL6 and BACH2. In GCB, BCL6-SMRT complexes transiently poise enhancers controlling terminal differentiation, immune synapse signaling, and cell-cycle checkpoint genes, thus enabling proliferative bursts ( Hatzi et al., 2013 35. Hatzi, K. ∙ Jiang, Y. ∙ Huang, C. ... A hybrid mechanism of action for BCL6 in B cells defined by formation of functionally distinct complexes at enhancers and promoters Cell Rep. 2013; 4 :578-588 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 2017 43. Jiang, Y. ∙ Ortega-Molina, A. ∙ Geng, H. ... CREBBP Inactivation Promotes the Development of HDAC3-Dependent Lymphomas Cancer Discov. 2017; 7 :38-53 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, the GC reaction in Tbl1xr1 LOF mice was significantly impaired, and GCB showed upregulation of BCL6 targets. Whereas Bcl6 -KO completely abrogates GC formation ( Hatzi and Melnick, 2014 34. Hatzi, K. ∙ Melnick, A. Breaking bad in the germinal center: how deregulation of BCL6 contributes to lymphomagenesis Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20 :343-352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), Tbl1xr1 LOF effects are reminiscent of the milder effects observed in mice carrying NCOR/SMRT LOF mutations that disrupt interaction with HDAC3 ( Jiang et al., 2017 43. Jiang, Y. ∙ Ortega-Molina, A. ∙ Geng, H. ...

The difference in severity between BCL6 versus TBL1XR1/SMRT complex deficiency phenotype is likely due to SMRT/HDAC3-independent BCL6 functions such as interaction with BCOR and LSD1 ( Hatzi et al., 2019 36. Hatzi, K. ∙ Geng, H. ∙ Doane, A.S. ... Histone demethylase LSD1 is required for germinal center formation and BCL6-driven lymphomagenesis Nat.

TBL1XR1’s lack of enzymatic activity has largely hindered efforts to elucidate its function. Still, one study proposed that TBL1XR1 acts as a repressor/coactivator exchange factor for hormone receptors ( Perissi et al., 2004 81. Perissi, V. ∙ Aggarwal, A. ∙ Glass, C.K. ... A corepressor/coactivator exchange complex required for transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors and other regulated transcription factors Cell. 2004; 116 :511-526 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this model, TBL1XR1 recruited UbcH5 and the 19S proteasome, leading to SMRT degradation. This finding was not reproduced by later studies ( Huang et al., 2009 39. Huang, W. ∙ Ghisletti, S. ∙ Perissi, V. ... Transcriptional integration of TLR2 and TLR4 signaling at the NCoR derepression checkpoint Mol.

TBLR1 regulates the expression of nuclear hormone receptor co-repressors BMC Cell Biol. 2006; 7 :31 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our own data show that in B cells, TBL1XR1 MUT had no effect on SMRT protein levels. Furthermore, our analysis of TBL1XR1 interactome failed to identify ubiquitin or proteasome machinery. In agreement with this, acute CD40L signaling (a differentiation cue for GCB) evicts SMRT from chromatin, without affecting its stability ( Polo et al., 2008 83. Polo, J.M. ∙ Ci, W. ∙ Licht, J.D. ... Reversible disruption of BCL6 repression complexes by CD40 signaling in normal and malignant B cells Blood. 2008; 112 :644-651 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Rather than altering SMRT turnover, TBL1XR1 mutation or KO instead shift SMRT complex from BCL6 to BACH2, resulting in transcriptional reprogramming.
WD40 domains function as PPI or protein-DNA interaction motifs, mainly through aromatic residues on the surface of the β-propeller (reviewed in Jain and Pandey, 2018 42. Jain, B.P. ∙ Pandey, S. WD40 Repeat Proteins: Signalling Scaffold with Diverse Functions Protein J. 2018; 37 :391-406 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, these TBL1XR1 residues are the most frequently mutated in DLBCL. Structural studies show that TBL1XR1 forms tetramers and binds SMRT through its N-terminal domain ( Oberoi et al., 2011 74. Oberoi, J. ∙ Fairall, L. ∙ Watson, P.J. ... Structural basis for the assembly of the SMRT/NCoR core transcriptional repression machinery Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18 :177-184 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2002 113. Zhang, J. ∙ Kalkum, M. ∙ Chait, B.T. ... The N-CoR-HDAC3 nuclear receptor corepressor complex inhibits the JNK pathway through the integral subunit GPS2 Mol. Cell. 2002; 9 :611-623 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is largely spared by mutations. Hence, WD40 mutations would not be predicted to disrupt TBL1XR1-SMRT interaction. Accordingly, a study on Pierpont syndrome found that the interaction between TBL1XR1 Y446C (a mutant also found in DLBCL) and SMRT/HDAC3, was maintained in vitro ( Heinen et al., 2016 37. Heinen, C.A. ∙ Jongejan, A. ∙ Watson, P.J. ... A specific mutation in TBL1XR1 causes Pierpont syndrome J. Med. Genet. 2016; 53 :330-337 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fact that TBL1XR1 MUT remains within the SMRT complex suggests that the WD40 plays a critical role in facilitating preferential association with BCL6, because TBL1XR1 KO yields a similar effect, both from the biological and biochemical standpoints. Importantly, the overall structure of the SMRT complex has not been resolved, but it will be necessary to understand how the holo-complex associates with BCL6 in the chromatin context and why TBL1XR1 LOF switches the conformation of the complex to favor binding to BACH2.
During the humoral immune response, B cells can transition to MB and PC phenotypes, with implications for formation of clonal precursor cells. Previous studies suggested a role for IL-9R signaling ( Wang et al., 2017b 107. Wang, Y. ∙ Shi, J. ∙ Yan, J. ... Germinal-center development of memory B cells driven by IL-9 from follicular helper T cells Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :921-930 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), or the relative level of BCR affinity for antigen ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 94. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), as factors driving GCB into the (pre)MB compartment. In the case of TBL1XR1 LOF, preMB expansion is caused by switching the SMRT complex to BACH2 and away from BCL6. This situation is different from simple de-repression of BCL6 target genes, which can enable differentiation to either PC or MB cell fate ( Diehl et al., 2008 23. Diehl, S.A. ∙ Schmidlin, H. ∙ Nagasawa, M. ... STAT3-mediated up-regulation of BLIMP1 Is coordinated with BCL6 down-regulation to control human plasma cell differentiation J.

Kuo, T.C. ∙ Shaffer, A.L. ∙ Haddad, Jr., J. ... Repression of BCL-6 is required for the formation of human memory B cells in vitro J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :819-830 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laidlaw et al., 2017 53. Laidlaw, B.J. ∙ Schmidt, T.H. ∙ Green, J.A. ... The Eph-related tyrosine kinase ligand Ephrin-B1 marks germinal center and memory precursor B cells J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :639-649 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reason for this is explained by the critical role of BACH2 in driving B cells toward the MB lineage ( Shinnakasu et al., 2016 94. Shinnakasu, R. ∙ Inoue, T. ∙ Kometani, K. ... Regulated selection of germinal-center cells into the memory B cell compartment Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :861-869 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the fact that PC master TF BLIMP1 is repressed both by BCL6 and BACH2 ( Ochiai et al., 2006 75. Ochiai, K. ∙ Katoh, Y. ∙ Ikura, T. ... Plasmacytic transcription factor Blimp-1 is repressed by Bach2 in B cells J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :38226-38234 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tunyaplin et al., 2004 104. Tunyaplin, C. ∙ Shaffer, A.L. ∙ Angelin-Duclos, C.D. ... Direct repression of prdm1 by Bcl-6 inhibits plasmacytic differentiation J. Immunol. 2004; 173 :1158-1165 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, in the TBL1XR1 LOF setting, BLIMP1 and the PC fate remain suppressed through the actions of BACH2-SMRT complexes. Notably, Il9r is a direct target gene of BLIMP1, and BLIMP1 LOF results in upregulation of Il9r transcripts ( Minnich et al., 2016 66. Minnich, M. ∙ Tagoh, H. ∙ Bönelt, P. ... Multifunctional role of the transcription factor Blimp-1 in coordinating plasma cell differentiation Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :331-343 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, transcriptional profiling of T cells from Bach2- KO mice revealed reduced levels of Il9r and increased levels of Prdm1 ( Geng et al., 2019 30. Geng, J. ∙ Wei, H. ∙ Shi, B. ... Bach2 Negatively Regulates T Follicular Helper Cell Differentiation and Is Critical for CD4 + T Cell Memory J. Immunol. 2019; 202 :2991-2998 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we found that Il9r plays an important role in mediating TBL1XR1 LOF-induced acquisition of preMB phenotypes. Beyond IL-9R, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how a switch to BACH2-driven programs might normally take place during the GC. In this view, somatic mutations of TBL1XR1 simply exaggerate this effect, locking GC cell fate into the preMB pathway and expanding the population of pre-malignant MB cells, setting the stage for post-GC extranodal DLBCL lymphomagenesis.
Mutations affecting TBL1XR1 associate with activating mutations in the BCR and TLR pathways ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schmitz et al., 2018 90. Schmitz, R. ∙ Wright, G.W. ∙ Huang, D.W. ... Genetics and Pathogenesis of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :1396-1407 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), to define a group of aggressive extranodal post-GC lymphomas. Our finding that Tbl1xr1 mutations disrupt canonical BCL6 transcriptional programs to drive GCB toward a post-GC/preMB stage is consistent with a MB COO for MCD/C5 DLBCLs. In agreement with this, lymphomas in KO/KO animals recapitulated canonical histological features of the human tumors, such as immunoblastic morphology, diffuse infiltration of extranodal tissues, and sparing of lymphoid follicles ( Kashyap et al., 2011 45. Kashyap, R. ∙ Rai Mittal, B. ∙ Manohar, K. ... Extranodal manifestations of lymphoma on [ 18 F]FDG-PET/CT: a pictorial essay Cancer Imaging. 2011; 11 :166-174 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The extrafollicular pattern may be linked to expression of MB-associated migratory chemokines induced by TBL1XR1 MUT , as part of the MB cell program. Indeed, the transcriptional profile of D370Y/WT GCB showed enrichment for post-GC-derived lymphoma transcriptomes and associated features, such as NF-κB/CD40 activation. An additional canonical MCD/C5 trait observed in our models was restriction in CSR ( Lenz et al., 2007 55. Lenz, G. ∙ Nagel, I. ∙ Siebert, R. ... Aberrant immunoglobulin class switch recombination and switch translocations in activated B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :633-643 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ), with Tbl1xr1 mutant and KO/KO cells remaining largely as IgM + . The selective preference for IgM expression could reflect possible benefits for the growth of post-GC lymphomas. We hypothesize that the increase in IgM + GC-derived populations is due to the strong bias introduced by TBL1XR1 alterations toward the generation/expansion of immature MB with a high capacity to reenter the GC reaction. Most strikingly, both our Tbl1xr1 -deficient murine lymphomas and primary human ABC-DLBCLs manifest an increased fraction of malignant cells with MB phenotype and a heavy burden of AID-induced on-target and off-target SHM. Importantly, this MB phenotype is observed in ABC-DLBCLs beyond those with TBL1XR1 mutations, suggesting that there are additional mutational trajectories that favor this novel MB-cell associated malignant transformation pathway.
Tbl1xr1 mutations not only skew GC output toward MB, but also suppressed formation of Ab-secreting cells upon recall. Along these lines, it is notable that extinction of the BACH2 program is normally required for PC differentiation of MB ( Kometani et al., 2013 49. Kometani, K. ∙ Nakagawa, R. ∙ Shinnakasu, R. ... Repression of the transcription factor Bach2 contributes to predisposition of IgG1 memory B cells toward plasma cell differentiation Immunity. 2013; 39 :136-147 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). Persistent BACH2-driven transcriptional programming in TBL1XR1 MUT MB could then explain the impairment in forming PC. Most strikingly, TBL1XR1 MUT MB cells showed an increased tendency to reenter new GC reactions. Cyclic reentry of BCL2-overexpressing MB into the GC reaction has been proposed to originate FLs ( Sungalee et al., 2014 101. Sungalee, S. ∙ Mamessier, E. ∙ Morgado, E. ... Germinal center reentries of BCL2-overexpressing B cells drive follicular lymphoma progression J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124 :5337-5351 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Presumably, these BCL2-overexpressing cells self-sustain and persist for long periods of time. However, we find that TBL1XR1 MUT expressly skew GC cell fate to produce the class of MB cells that are most prone to reenter the GC reaction, thus serving as clonal precursor cells to aggressive C5/MCD DLBCLs. The fact that TBL1XR1 mutations in these lymphomas appear as early clonal events ( Chapuy et al., 2018 16. Chapuy, B. ∙ Stewart, C. ∙ Dunford, A.J. ... Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B cell lymphoma are associated with distinct pathogenic mechanisms and outcomes Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :679-690 Crossref Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ) further supports a model where TBL1XR1 MUT MB engage in successive rounds of GC reactions, eventually acquiring further hits in other genes (as shown here for Pim1 ) that further accelerate malignant transformation. This would likely explain the canonical complex phenotype of these tumors where they manifest an aberrant and heterogeneous composite of features reflecting aspects of MB, PB, and GCB. These results point to the need for surveillance studies in humans to identify precursor clonal cells at risk for transformation to these aggressive and incurable forms of DLBCL, much in the way current studies are attempting to predict which patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate prognosis are at risk for development of acute leukemia. The fact that this process is dependent on the SMRT/HDAC3 complex points to the potential for newly reported selective HDAC3 inhibitors ( Mondello et al., 2020 68. Mondello, P. ∙ Tadros, S. ∙ Teater, M. ... Selective Inhibition of HDAC3 Targets Synthetic Vulnerabilities and Activates Immune Surveillance in Lymphoma Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :440-459 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ) as therapeutic agents for these clonal disorders. Perhaps combining such compounds with blockade of IL-9R signaling could further potentiate their activity. The recent discovery that auto-immune disorders like Sjogren’s disease are driven by MB cells harboring canonical MCD mutations ( Singh et al., 2020 95. Singh, M. ∙ Jackson, K.J.L. ∙ Wang, J.J. ... Lymphoma Driver Mutations in the Pathogenic Evolution of an Iconic Human Autoantibody Cell. 2020; 180 :878-894 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2017a 106. Wang, J.Q. ∙ Jeelall, Y.S. ∙ Humburg, P. ... Synergistic cooperation and crosstalk between MYD88 L265P and mutations that dysregulate CD79B and surface IgM J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2759-2776 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) point to the further potential medical impact of such therapeutic interventions.

Conditional Tbl1xr1 -D370Y mice were generated by inGenious Targeting Laboratory Inc. (Ronkonkoma, NY, USA), using an inversion and deletion approach ( Figure S1 A). To achieve the conditional activation of the D370Y mutation, WT LoxP and mutant Lox66/Lox71 (RE/LE mutants) sites were used. In brief, the genomic sequence from Tbl1xr1 exon 11 to exon 12, and their flanking sequences, were duplicated and flanked by Lox66 and Lox71 sites. The specific point mutation GAC > TAC (D > Y) was introduced into the duplicated exon 12. Then, the Lox66/71 flanked sequence was inserted into intron 12, in the reverse direction. A 5′ WT LoxP site was inserted upstream of exon 11. An FRT-flanked Neomycin selection cassette was inserted immediately upstream of the Lox66/71 flanked inversion sequence. Embryonic stem (ES) cells were electroporated with this homologous targeting construct, and stable G418 clones were derived. Targeted iTL IC1 (C57BL/6) ES cells were microinjected into BALB/c blastocysts. Resulting chimeras with a high percentage of black coat were further screened by PCR, and mated to C57BL/6J R26:FLPe mice, to remove the Neomycin cassette. Founder mice were further backcrossed for at least 10 generations into the C57BL/6J background.
Conditional Tbl1xr1 -KO mice were obtained by microinjection of targeted JMB8A3.N1 Tbl1xr1 tm1a(EUCOMM)Hmgu ES cells (clone HEPD0744_3_E01; EUCOMM program) into C57BL/6-albino blastocytes, and implantation into pseudo-pregnant foster C57BL/6-albino recipients (stock 000058; The Jackson Laboratory). Procedures were carried out by the Mouse Genetic - Transgenic Core Facility at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York, NY, USA). Resulting chimeras with a high percentage of black coat were further screened by PCR, and mated to C57BL/6J R26:FLPe mice, to remove the FRT-flanked lacZ-Neomycin resistance cassette. Founder mice were further backcrossed for at least 10 generations into the C57BL/6J background.
All mouse experiments were conducted using aged and sex-matched specimens. Experiments were designed to include male and female specimens in all groups, and no sex-based influence/bias was detected in the observations made in this work. Unless stated otherwise in the text, all animals were 8 to 12 weeks of age at the time of experimentation.
The DLBCL cell line OCI-Ly1 (CVCL_1879; male origin) was grown in Iscove Modified Dulbecco Media (12440061; ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin G/streptomycin; U2932 (CVCL_1896; female origin) cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (10-040-CV; Corning; Corning, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin G/streptomycin, L-glutamine, and HEPES; HEK293T cells (CVCL_0063; female origin) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (11965-092; ThermoFisher Scientific), supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin G/streptomycin. Murine 40LB cells ( Nojima et al., 2011 73. Nojima, T. ∙ Haniuda, K. ∙ Moutai, T. ... In-vitro derived germinal centre B cells differentially generate memory B or plasma cells in vivo Nat. Commun. 2011; 2 :465 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ) (male origin) were grown in DMEM media with 10% FBS. All cells were grown in incubators at 37C, in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Cell line authentication testing was performed at IDEXX BioResearch ( https://www.idexxbioresearch.com/cellcheck ), using methods recommended by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI ASN-0002-2011). The cell lines were confirmed to be of human origin and tested for evidence of cross-species contamination (mouse, rat, Chinese hamster and African Green monkey). Short tandem repeat (STR) testing was performed and the genetic profile obtained was compared to the established cell line profile to confirm the cell lines are consistent with the established profile. These cell lines were also routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination in the laboratory.
TOP10, Stbl3 and DH5α E. Coli cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) were cultured in autoclave-sterilized Luria Bertani broth (BP1426-2; Fisher Scientific), in a MaxQ 8000 orbital shaker (ThermoFisher Scientific) set at 200rpm and 37°C.

Clinic-pathological characteristics of these cases are detailed in the original publication. Further details on somatic mutations in these cases are summarized in Table S5 .
To induce GC formation, age- and sex-matched mice were immunized intraperitoneally at 8 to 12 weeks of age with either 0.5ml of a 2% sheep SRBC suspension in PBS (Cocalico Biologicals; Reamstown, PA, USA), or 100 μg of the highly substituted hapten NP (NP 16 to NP 32 ) conjugated to the carrier protein ovalbumin (OVA), or CGG (Chicken Gamma Globulin), or KLH (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin; all from Biosearch Technologies; Novato, CA, USA) absorbed to Imject Alum Adjuvant (77161; ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA) at a 1:1 ratio. In the experiments where T FH interactions were blocked in vivo , mice received and i.v. injection of 100μg anti-CD40L antibody (clone MR-1, BE0017; BioXCell; West Lebanon, NH, USA) or control IgG antibody (BE0091; BioXCell) 4 days after SRBC immunization, and a second dose of antibody 2 days later. In the experiments where IL-9 was blocked in vivo , mice received a single i.v. injection of 200μg anti-IL-9 antibody (clone 9C1, BE0181; BioXCell) or control IgG2a antibody (BE0085; BioXCell) 7 days after SRBC immunization. In these experiments, littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups. In experiments where GC cell cycle distribution was assessed, animals received an i.v. injection of 1mg EdU (E10187; ThermoFisher Scientific), 1h before euthanasia.
Bone marrow cells were harvested from the tibia and femur of 8-12 weeks old donor mice. After treatment with red blood cell lysis solution (158904; QIAGEN; Germantown, MD, USA), cells were mixed at the indicated ratios, and 1-2 million cells were injected into the tail vein of lethally irradiated C57BL/6J host mice (2 doses of 450rad, on a Rad Source Technologies RS 2000 Biological Research X-ray Irradiator). Transplanted mice were used for experiments 6-8 weeks after transplant, to allow for full engraftment. With the exception of mice euthanized at specific time points, all mice involved in lymphomagenesis studies were monitored until any one of several criteria for euthanizing were met, including severe lethargy, more than 10% body weight loss, and palpable splenomegaly that extended across the midline, in accordance with our Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved animal protocol (protocol #2011-0031).
For NB cell adoptive transfers, total splenocytes were harvested from 8-12 weeks old B1-8hi donor mice ( Cd45.1 or Cd45 .1/2 ), and mature B cells were isolated using negative selection with CD43 magnetic beads (130-049-801; Miltenyi Biotec; Somerville, MA, USA). The percentage of NP-binding cells in this population was determined by FC (see below), and a number of mature B cells corresponding to 2-3x10 5 NP-binding B cells was injected i.v. into C57BL/6J recipient mice ( Cd45.2 ). Recipient animals were immunized with an NP-conjugate 16h after cell transfer, and euthanized for analysis at the stated time points.
Antigen-specific MB cells for transfer experiments were generated following the protocol above, and splenic NP-binding MB cells were FACS-sorted three months, or more, after immunization of recipient mice with NP-CGG or NP-KLH. Splenic memory T cells (MT; CD3+CD4+CD44+CD62L-) were FACS-sorted from OT-II mice, 10 days after immunization with 100μg OVA peptide (#A5503, Sigma-Aldrich; San Luis, MO, USA). For re-call experiments, 8x10 3 MB and 4x10 4 MT cells were injected i.v. into μMT recipient mice ( Cd45.2 ). Recipient animals were immunized with NP-OVA 16h after transfer, and euthanized for analysis 3.5 days after immunization.

NIP-haptenated FITC was obtained from M.J. Shlomchik (University of Pittsburg, PA, USA) ( Anderson et al., 2007 2. Anderson, S.M. ∙ Tomayko, M.M. ∙ Ahuja, A. ... New markers for murine memory B cells that define mutated and unmutated subsets J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :2103-2114 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). For S1PR1 staining, a biotinylated goat anti-rat secondary antibody was used (112-065-167; dilution 1:1000, Jackson Immunoresearch; West Grove, PA, USA). For AID staining, a goat anti-mouse IgG cross-adsorbed secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647, was used (A21235, dilution 1:300; Thermo Scientific). To detect surface IL-9R expression, cells were incubated with 8 ng/μl recombinant IL-9 (219-19; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) on ice for 60min, washed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 30min, and then stained with APC anti-IL-9 (RM9A4, dilution 1:250; BioLegend) on ice. As the negative control, incubation with IL-9 was omitted. Ghost Dye Violet 510 (13-0870; Tonbo Biosciences; San Diego, CA, USA) or DAPI (D1306; ThermoFisher Scientific) were used for the exclusion of dead cells. For intracellular markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (00-5523-00; ThermoFisher Scientific). PE-conjugated AnnexinV (556421, dilution 1:100; BD Biosciences) in AnnexinV binding buffer (BD Biosciences) was used to identify apoptotic cells. For cell cycle assessment, EdU incorporation was detected using the Click-iT Plus AF488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (C10633; ThermoFisher Scientific). Proliferation rates were assessed in cell lines using the CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (C34554; ThermoFisher Scientific), and in primary cultures using the eBioscience Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor 670 (65-0840-85; ThermoFisher Scientific), according to the vendor’s protocol. Data were acquired on BD FACS Canto II or BD Fortessa flow cytometer analyzers, and analyzed using FlowJo software package (TreeStar).
When B cell populations were sorted, single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were pre-enriched in B cells using positive selection with anti-B220 magnetic microbeads (130-049-501; Miltenyi Biotec), or negative selection with the EasySep Mouse B Cell Isolation Kit (19854; StemCell Technologies,). The stated populations were then isolated using a BD FACSAria II or a BD Influx sorter (BD Biosciences).
For analysis of T cell dependent antibody production, mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg NP-CGG or NP-OVA or NP-KLH, ratio 16-32, in alum (1:1). Serum from each animal was collected before immunization, and on the stated days after immunization. Titers of low and high-affinity isotype-specific antibodies to NP were measured in plates coated with NP 28 -BSA or NP 8 -BSA, respectively, using the SBA Clonotyping System (5300-05; Southern Biotechnology; Birmingham, AL, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Results were assessed by spectrophotometric measurement of absorbance at 405nm using a Biotek Synergy Neo Alpha Plate Reader (BioTek; Winooski, VT, USA). Background readings of absorbance in negative control wells were A 450 < 0.050.
Mice organs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue processing and staining were done by the Laboratory of Comparative Pathology (MSKCC). Briefly, five micron-sections were deparaffinized and heat antigen-retrieved in citrate buffer pH = 6.4, and endogenous peroxidase (HRP) activity was blocked by treating the sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Indirect immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-species-specific biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by avidin–horseradish peroxidase or avidin-AP, and developed by Vector Blue or DAB color substrates (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA USA). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The following primary antibodies were used: biotin-conjugated anti-B220 (550286; BD Biosciences), anti-CD3 (ab16669; Abcam; Cambridge, UK), anti-PNA (B1075; Vector Laboratories), anti-CD138 (553712; BD Biosciences), and anti-KI67 (12202; Cell Signaling Technology; Danvers, MA, USA). TUNEL staining was carried out as previously described ( Gavrieli et al., 1992 29. Gavrieli, Y. ∙ Sherman, Y. ∙ Ben-Sasson, S.A. Identification of programmed cell death in situ via specific labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119 :493-501 Crossref Scopus (8883) PubMed Google Scholar ). IHC on human specimens was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPET) biopsies of 341 DLBCL cases within the cohort as described previously ( Ennishi et al., 2017 28.

NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (21916) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to quantify GC and TUNEL + cell/areas. CD38 staining was semiquantitatively assessed on tumor cells using HistoScore (HS = IxP): intensity (I = [1-3]) and percentage of positive cells (p = [0-100]). Specimens with HS > 50 were defined as CD38 positive.
Experiments using the organoid culture system were performed as previously described ( Béguelin et al., 2017 9. Béguelin, W. ∙ Rivas, M.A. ∙ Calvo Fernández, M.T. ... EZH2 enables germinal centre formation through epigenetic silencing of CDKN1A and an Rb-E2F1 feedback loop Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :877 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, splenic B cells were obtained from naive animals through negative selection, using the EasySep Mouse B Cell Isolation Kit in accordance with manufacturer’s protocol. Feeder 40LB cells ( Nojima et al., 2011 73. Nojima, T. ∙ Haniuda, K. ∙ Moutai, T. ... In-vitro derived germinal centre B cells differentially generate memory B or plasma cells in vivo Nat. Commun. 2011; 2 :465 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ) were grown in DMEM media with 10% FBS and, at the time of experiment, were mitotically inhibited through incubation in cell culture complete medium containing 0.01 mg/ml Mitomycin C (MO503, Sigma-Aldrich,) at 37 °C for 55 min before the encapsulation. For organoid fabrication, gelatin stock solution was freshly prepared by mixing gelatin powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI-1640 medium followed by sterilization using syringe filter. Cells were mixed with warmed 5% gelatin stock solution and diluted accordingly using cell culture medium. Silicate nanoparticles (SiNP) with 25–30 nm in diameter and 1 nm in thickness were obtained from Southern Clay Products Inc. (Gonzales, TX, USA). A 3% hydrogel SiNP suspension was freshly prepared before the encapsulation procedure by mixing SiNP powder with deionized water and vortexing the resulting solution, followed by filtration through 0.22μm syringe filters immediately before use. Organoids were fabricated in 96-well plates by first adding 10 μl of 3% hydrogel SiNP followed by injecting 10 μl cell-containing gelatin solution into the initial SiNP droplet, and then mixing the entire hydrogel through repeated pipetting. Each organoid contained 50,000 B cells and 80,000 40LB cells. Organoids were cured for ∼10 min before the addition of RPMI media with 10% FBS and penicillin G/streptomycin, containing 50 ng/ml murine recombinant IL-4 (404-ML; R&D Systems) and 25ng/ml murine recombinant IL-21 (594-ML; R&D Systems) and were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell culture medium was renewed every 3 days.
To generate TBL1XR1 -KO clones using CRISPR, cell lines were electroporated using an Amaxa Nucleofector Unit and the SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit (PBC2-22500; Lonza; Basel, Switzerland), to incorporate a recombinant Cas9 nuclease (Alt-R® S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3, 1081058), a TBL1XR1 -targeting Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA ( TBL1XR1 _1 crRNA: 5′-GAU AUG GCU UUC UAU ACC AAG UUU UAG AGC UAU GCU-3′; TBL1XR1 _2 crRNA: 5′-UAU UGG UCG ACC AUC AAA CAG UUU UAG AGC UAU GCU-3′), and an Alt-R® CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA (1075927; all from Integrated DNA Technologies; Coralville, IA, USA), following vendor’s recommendations. Forty-eight hours after electroporation, cells were single-cell plated into 96 well plates, and allowed to grow for at least 2 weeks. Resulting clones were screened by WB, and positive clones were further verified by Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA. Clones expressing parental-like levels of TBL1XR1, and WT DNA sequences, were used as congenic controls for experiments.
TBL1XR1 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from HEK293T cells, and a Linker-His_Tag-V5_Tag sequence was added downstream by PCR (5′- GGCAGCAGCGGCCATCATCACCATCACCACGGTAAGCCTATCCCTAACCCTCTCCTCGGTCTCGATTCTACG-3′). The TBL1XR1-V5 insert was cloned into the pSBtet-GP backbone (#60495; Addgene; Watertown, MA, USA; ( Kowarz et al., 2015 50. Kowarz, E. ∙ Löscher, D. ∙ Marschalek, R. Optimized Sleeping Beauty transposons rapidly generate stable transgenic cell lines Biotechnol. J. 2015; 10 :647-653 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) using the SfiI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs; Ipswich, MA, USA). TBL1XR1 point mutations (D370Y, Y395H and Y446S) were introduced using the QuikChange II XL Site-directed mutagenesis kit (200521; Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA, USA), and verified by Sanger sequencing. OCI-Ly1 cells were nucleofected to incorporate the different pSBtet-GP-TBL1XR1-V5 plasmids, along with a construct coding for the SB100X transposase [pCMV(CAT)T7-SB110; #34879, Addgene] ( Mátés et al., 2009 62. Mátés, L. ∙ Chuah, M.K. ∙ Belay, E. ... Molecular evolution of a novel hyperactive Sleeping Beauty transposase enables robust stable gene transfer in vertebrates Nat. Genet. 2009; 41 :753-761 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were selected with Puromycin for 7 days, and incorporation of the construct was validated by FC for GFP. To induce TBL1XR1-V5 expression, cells were stimulated with Doxycycline (DOX) 1μg/ml for 48h in complete growth media.
TBL1XR1 or eGFP ORF were cloned into the pLIX_403 backbone (#41395; Addgene; David Root (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA), downstream of FLAG-BirA(R118G) ORF (#36047; Addgene) ( Roux et al., 2012 87.

Cell Biol. 2012; 196 :801-810 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ), using the Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme mix (11791020; ThermoFisher Scientific). TBL1XR1 -Y446S mutation was introduced using the QuikChange II Site-directed mutagenesis kit, and verified by Sanger sequencing. Lentivirus were produced in HEK293T cells co-transfected with pCMV-VSV-G and pCMV-dR8.91 plasmids, and then concentrated using PEG-it (LV810A-1; System Biosciences; Palo Alto, CA, USA). OCI-Ly1 and U2932 cells were infected and cultured for 48h, and then selected with Puromycin for 7 days. To induce expression of the FLAG-BirA-fusion proteins, cells were stimulated with DOX 1μg/ml for 24h. Incorporation of the construct was validated by WB for BirA ( Figure S5 C), or FC for eGFP.
Expression of FLAG-BirA-fusion proteins in OCI-Ly1 and U2932 cells was induced by treatment with Doxycycline 1μg/ml for 24h, after which biotin 50μM (B4501; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the media for additional 24h. Cell pellets were washed twice with PBS, and lysed in modified RIPA lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1:500 protease inhibitor cocktail (11873580001; Sigma-Aldrich), 1:100 Benzonase nuclease (E1014-5KU; Sigma-Aldrich), at 4°C for 1h, and sonicated for 30 s at 35% power to disrupt visible aggregates. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000rpm for 30min, and clarified supernatants were incubated with 30μL packed pre-equilibrated streptavidin-Sepharose beads (GE17-5113-01; GE Healthcare Life Sciences; Chicago, IL, USA) at 4°C for 3h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed six times with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate pH = 8.3, and treated with TPCK trypsin (V5111; Promega Corporation; Madison, WI, USA). The supernatant, containing tryptic peptides, was collected and lyophilized. Peptides were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid.
LC-MS/MS was conducted using a 120min reversed-phase buffer gradient running at 150nL/min (column heated to 40°C) on a Proxeon EASY-nLC pump in-line with a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). A parent ion scan was performed in the Orbitrap, using a resolving power of 60000. Simultaneously, up to twenty of the most intense peaks were selected for MS/MS (minimum ion count of 1000 for activation) using standard CID fragmentation. Fragment ions were detected in the LTQ. Dynamic exclusion was activated such that MS/MS of the same m/z (within a 10ppm window, exclusion list size 500) detected three times within 45 s were excluded from analysis for 30 s. For protein identification, Proteowizard was used to convertraw files to .mzXML, and searched using X!Tandem ( Craig and Beavis, 2004 21. Craig, R. ∙ Beavis, R.C. TANDEM: matching proteins with tandem mass spectra Bioinformatics. 2004; 20 :1466-1467 Crossref Scopus (1780) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kessner et al., 2008 46.

Search parameters specified a parent MS tolerance of 15ppm and an MS/MS fragment ion tolerance of 0.4Da, with up to two missed cleavages allowed for trypsin. Oxidation of methionine and ubiquitylation of lysine residues were allowed as variable modifications. Data were analyzed using a trans-proteomic pipeline via the ProHits software suite ( Liu et al., 2010 59. Liu, G. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Larsen, B. ... ProHits: integrated software for mass spectrometry-based interaction proteomics Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :1015-1017 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proteins identified with a ProteinProphet cut-off value 0.80 (corresponding to FDR < 1%) were analyzed with SAINT Express ( Choi et al., 2011 17. Choi, H. ∙ Larsen, B. ∙ Lin, Z.Y. ... SAINT: probabilistic scoring of affinity purification-mass spectrometry data Nat. Methods. 2011; 8 :70-73 Crossref Scopus (359) PubMed Google Scholar ). Four control runs of Flag-BirA-eGFP were used for comparative purposes. The control runs were collapsed to the two highest spectral counts for each hit. Prey identified with ≥ 2 spectral counts in each of the two replicates with a SAINT ≥ 75% were considered significant. Known common contaminants (CRAPome Database v1.1 for Jurkart cells) ( Mellacheruvu et al., 2013 64. Mellacheruvu, D. ∙ Wright, Z. ∙ Couzens, A.L. ... The CRAPome: a contaminant repository for affinity purification-mass spectrometry data Nat.

Protein extracts for IP experiments were obtained using the Nuclear Complex Co-IP Kit (54001; Active Motif; Carlsbad, CA, USA). For IP experiments, 500-1000ug of nuclear protein extracts were incubated ON with V5-Tag magnetic beads (M16711; MBL International Corporation; Woburn, MA, USA), or with the indicated primary antibodies [BCL6 (sc-858) and HDAC3 (sc-11417) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA); NCOR2 (06-891) from Sigma Aldrich; BACH2 (ARP39513_P050) from Aviva Systems Biology (San Diego, CA, USA); Rabbit anti-mouse control IgG (ab46540) from Abcam], followed by a 2h incubation with Protein A Dynabeads (10001D; ThermoFisher Scientific). Whole cell lysates or IP products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane (1620177; Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, CA, USA), and probed with the indicated primary antibodies [BCL6 (sc-7388), HDAC3 (sc-376957) and β-ACTIN (sc-47778) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; NCOR2 (PA1-843) from ThermoFisher Scientific; BACH2 (ARP39513_P050); TBL1XR1 (H00079710-M01) from Abnova (Taipei City, Taiwan); BirA (BID-CP-100) from BioFront Technologies (Tallahassee, FL, USA)]. Membranes were then incubated with a corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). Protein signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (RPN2232; GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
RIME experiments ( Mohammed et al., 2016 67. Mohammed, H. ∙ Taylor, C. ∙ Brown, G.D. ... Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins (RIME) for analysis of chromatin complexes Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :316-326 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) in OCI-Ly1 cells were performed by Active Motif, using an anti-BCL6 antibody (sc-858), or an isotype-matched IgG control (ab46540). Biological duplicates were prepared for each immunoprecipitation. Known common contaminants (CRAPome Database v1.1 for Jurkart cells) were removed from the final protein list.
Genomic DNA was extracted using: a) the QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (QE09050; Epicenter; Madison, WI, USA), for human cell lines; b) the Puregene Gentra cell kit (158388; QIAGEN), for mouse cell suspensions; c) the DirectPCR Lysis Reagent (101-T; Viagen Biotech; Los Angeles, CA, USA), for mouse tails. Total RNA was extracted from cell suspensions using Trizol LS (10296010; ThermoFisher Scientific) and RNeasy Mini Kit (74106; QIAGEN), with DNase treatment. RNA concentration was determined using Qubit Fluorometric Quantification (ThermoFisher Scientific) and integrity was verified using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
PCR-based genotyping of the Tbl1xr1 -D370Y allele was done on genomic DNA extracted from mouse tail tissues, using the GoTaq® DNA Polymerase (M3001; Promega Corporation). Primers were designed to flank the distal LoxP site located between Tbl1xr1 exons 10 and 11, in the targeted allele ( Figures S1 A and S1B) (Forward: 5′-AAC GAG AAG CCA AGG TTC CAG TTC-3′; Reverse: 5′-GAT GCA AAG GTG TTG TTG CTC TGC-3′). PCR program: [2′: 95C] x1, [30”: 95C, 30”: @55C, 45”: 72C] x35, [5′: 72C] x1. PCR-based validation of exon 5 excision in Tbl1xr1 KO/KO mice was done on genomic DNA from sorted GCB. Primers were designed to target Tbl1xr1 exon 5 ( Figure S1 G) (Forward: 5′-TAT CCT CAG CGG TGG GTT AC-3′; Reverse: 5′-GCC AGT AGG GGT TGC TGA TA-3′). PCR program: [2′: 95C] x1, [1’: 95C, 1’: @52C, 2′: 72C] x35, [5′: 72C] x1. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and visualized using SYBR Safe DNA stain (S33102; ThermoFisher Scientific).

Pim1 locus was amplified from genomic DNA using the primers from Liu et al. (2008) 58. Liu, M. ∙ Duke, J.L. ∙ Richter, D.J. ... Two levels of protection for the B cell genome during somatic hypermutation Nature. 2008; 451 :841-845 Crossref Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar : Fwd: 5′-TTC GGC TCG GTC TAC TCT G-3′; Rev: 5′-GGA GGG AAA AGT GGG TCA TAC-3′. PCR program: [2′: 95C] x1, [1’: 95C, 1’: @65C, 1’: 72C] x25, [15’: 72C] x1. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (28704; QIAGEN). Purified products were then cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing (K457501; ThermoFisher Scientific), following manufacturer instructions. Plates were grown ON at 37C, and bacteria colony sequencing was performed by GENEWIZ, using the T7 universal sequencing primer (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3′). Only good-quality sequence was considered, as determined by inspection of the chromatograms. Mutation mismatch counts were calculated from Sanger sequencing using the sangerseqR ( Hill et al., 2014 38. Hill, J.T. ∙ Demarest, B.L. ∙ Bisgrove, B.W. ... Poly peak parser: Method and software for identification of unknown indels using sanger sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products Dev. Dyn. 2014; 243 :1632-1636 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Biostrings (R package version 2.54.0) packages. As a negative control for SHM, genomic DNA extracted from sorted Acida KO/KO GCB was used as PCR template.
Sorted GCB or tumor cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500μL DNA cell lysis buffer (100mM Tris pH 8.8, 200mM NaCl, 5mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS) containing 0.2mg/mL proteinase K and incubated at 56°C overnight. 500μL isopropanol and 40μg glycogen was added to precipitate DNA. The mixture was incubated at 4°C for 20 minutes followed by centrifugation for 20 minutes at 20,000 x g and 4°C. The pellet was washed with 1mL 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 20,000xg and 4°C. The pellet was resuspended with 20μL DEPC-H2O and incubated at 37°C for 40 minutes. JH4 intron sequences were amplified from germinal center B cell genomic DNA by PCR using J H 4 forward primer (5′-GGA ATT CGC CTG ACA TCT GAG GAC TCT GC-3′), JH4 reverse primer (5′-GAC TAG TCC TCT CCA GTT TCG GCT GAA TCC-3′) ( Jolly et al., 1997 44. Jolly, C.J. ∙ Klix, N. ∙ Neuberger, M.S. Rapid methods for the analysis of immunoglobulin gene hypermutation: application to transgenic and gene targeted mice Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25 :1913-1919 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (M0530L: New England BioLabs). PCR program: [3′: 98C] x1, [30”: 98C, 1’: 72C] x39, [10’: 72C] x1. PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the 1.2kb band extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. The amplicon was ligated into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector and transformed into One Shot TOP10 chemically competent E. coli (K280002; ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Clones were sequenced using the bacterial colony Sanger sequencing service provided by Eton Bioscience (Union, NJ, USA) and JH4 sequencing primer (5′-CCA TAC ACA TAC TTC TGT GTT CC-3′). As a negative control for SHM, genomic DNA extracted from sorted Acida KO/KO GCB was used as PCR template. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (EMBL-EBI) included in Biopython package ( Cock et al., 2009 20. Cock, P.J. ∙ Antao, T. ∙ Chang, J.T. ... Biopython: freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology and bioinformatics Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1422-1423 Crossref Scopus (1419) PubMed Google Scholar ) and analyzed for mutations using Python 3 script.
Library preparation, sequencing and post-processing of the raw data was performed at the Epigenomics Core at Weill Cornell Medicine. Samples that passed the quality control (RNA Integrity Number ≥ 8) were subjected to library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq stranded-mRNA sample kits (Illumina; San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer. Briefly, poly A+ RNA was purified from 100 ng of total RNA with oligo-dT beads. Purified mRNA was fragmented with divalent cations at elevated temperature, to ∼200 bp. Following dscDNA synthesis, the double stranded products are end repaired, followed by addition of a single ‘A’ base and then ligation of the Illumina TruSeq adaptors. The resulting product was amplified with 15 cycles of PCR. Libraries were validated using the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer and Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay (Q33120; ThermoFisher Scientific). Each library was made with a unique Index sequence and libraries were pooled for sequencing. The pool was clustered at 6.5pM on a single end read flow cell and sequenced for 50 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to obtain ∼50 M reads per sample. Single-end sequencing (SE50), for the Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT GCB profiling, or paired end-sequencing (PE50x2) for the IμBcl6 - Tbl1xr1 D370Y/WT and Tbl1xr1 KO/KO GCB profiling, were performed on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer. Primary processing of sequencing images was done using Illumina’s Real Time Analysis software (RTA) as suggested by Illumina. CASAVA 1.8.2 software was used to perform image capture, base calling, demultiplexing samples and generation of raw reads and respective quality scores. Sequencing results were aligned to mm10 using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 24. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (8577) PubMed Google Scholar ) and annotated to RefSeq using the R subread package ( Liao et al., 2014 57. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (3501) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the EdgeR package GLM ( Robinson et al., 2010 86. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (11879) PubMed Google Scholar ) with thresholds of fold-change > 1.5 and p < 0.05, adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Hierarchical clustering was performed using Euclidean distance of log FPKM values of genes within the top 5th percentile of standard deviation across replicates and Ward’s minimum variance. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the GSEA algorithm, as described in ( Subramanian et al., 2005 100. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (16287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pathway analysis was performed using PAGE algorithm ( Goodarzi et al., 2009 32. Goodarzi, H. ∙ Elemento, O. ∙ Tavazoie, S. Revealing global regulatory perturbations across human cancers Mol. Cell. 2009; 36 :900-911 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Diagnostic pre-treatment LN biopsies from patients with DLBCL, or non-malignant “reactive” LN (rLN) were acquired from the lymphoma tumor bank at the BC Cancer Agency. All samples were obtained with informed consent and according to protocols approved by the BCCA Research Ethics Board, and were selected based on sufficient numbers of viable cells for CyTOF analysis (2 million per sample).
Vials of frozen cells were rapidly thawed from liquid nitrogen to 37°C using a water bath, and cell suspensions were washed with RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used immediately after thawing and were incubated in cisplatin for 15 minutes to label dead cells, then washed thoroughly in PBS+2%FCS. Cell pellets were then incubated with Fc Receptor Blocking Solution (422302; BioLegends) for 10 minutes to inhibit non-specific binding of antibodies, before the addition of a master mix of metal-conjugated antibodies at optimal concentrations for 30 minutes. The relevant antibodies used for the current analysis are; CD10-156Nd (HI10a; Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA, USA), CD27-167Er (L128; Fluidigm), CD38-172Yb (HIT2; Fluidigm) and CD44-171Yb (IM7; Fluidigm).
Samples were bar-coded with the Cell-ID 20-plex Pd kit (#201060; Fluidigm) as per manufacturer’s instructions before being pooled together for analysis to ensure consistent acquisition. Batch effects were accounted for using a spike-in staining control of rLN cells. Pooled suspensions were then spiked with DVS normalization beads to account for technical drift during acquisition, and acquired on a Fluidigm CyTOF 2 instrument. After acquisition, samples were normalized based on bead signal intensity and de-multiplexed to distinguish individual samples using published tools ( https://github.com/nolanlab/bead-normalization , https://github.com/nolanlab/single-cell-debarcoder ).
Viable cells were gated in FlowJo based on negative staining for cisplatin, and all subsequent analysis was performed using R. Malignant tumor cells were identified as previously described ( Nissen et al., 2019 72. Nissen, M.D. ∙ Kusakabe, M. ∙ Wang, X. ... Single Cell Phenotypic Profiling of 27 DLBCL Cases Reveals Marked Intertumoral and Intratumoral Heterogeneity Cytometry A. 2019; Published online October 22, 2019 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Isolated malignant cells and manually-defined germinal center B cells and memory B cells were then pooled together for principal component analysis.
Exome sequencing on samples ( Table S6 ) was carried out using genomic DNA extracted from DLBCL samples using QIAGEN reagents. Exome libraries were created using IDT exome capture kits, and samples were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (PE_2x125). Somatic SNV/indel variants were identified using the intersection of calls predicted by VarScan (version 2.3.6) ( Koboldt et al., 2012 48. Koboldt, D.C. ∙ Zhang, Q. ∙ Larson, D.E. ... VarScan 2: somatic mutation and copy number alteration discovery in cancer by exome sequencing Genome Res. 2012; 22 :568-576 Crossref Scopus (2007) PubMed Google Scholar ), Strelka (version 1.0.13) ( Saunders et al., 2012 88. Saunders, C.T. ∙ Wong, W.S. ∙ Swamy, S. ... Strelka: accurate somatic small-variant calling from sequenced tumor-normal sample pairs Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1811-1817 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MuTect (version 1.1.4) ( Cibulskis et al., 2013 18. Cibulskis, K. ∙ Lawrence, M.S. ∙ Carter, S.L. ... Sensitive detection of somatic point mutations in impure and heterogeneous cancer samples Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :213-219 Crossref Scopus (1954) PubMed Google Scholar ). All variants were annotated using SnpEff (version 4.2) ( Cingolani et al., 2012 19. Cingolani, P. ∙ Platts, A. ∙ Wang, L. ... A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3 Fly (Austin). 2012; 6 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (3209) PubMed Google Scholar ) and filtered for effects predicted to have an impact at the protein level (nonsynonymous, stop-gained, splice site, UTR). Variants were further filtered to remove potential germline SNPs if the variant: (i) had a GMAF score > 1% or (ii) was present in dbSNP (version 137) ( Sherry et al., 2001 93. Sherry, S.T. ∙ Ward, M.H. ∙ Kholodov, M. ... dbSNP: the NCBI database of genetic variation Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29 :308-311 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and not COSMIC (version 68) ( Tate et al., 2019 102. Tate, J.G. ∙ Bamford, S. ∙ Jubb, H.C. ... COSMIC: the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D941-D947 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). All tumors were paired against a pooled control that was constructed from 10 normal samples, to account for sequencing noise.
