Section: Abstract

Neural migration is a critical step during brain development that requires the interactions of cell-surface guidance receptors. Cancer cells often hijack these mechanisms to disseminate. Here, we reveal crystal structures of Uncoordinated-5 receptor D (Unc5D) in complex with morphogen receptor glypican-3 (GPC3), forming an octameric glycoprotein complex. In the complex, four Unc5D molecules pack into an antiparallel bundle, flanked by four GPC3 molecules. Central glycan-glycan interactions are formed by N-linked glycans emanating from GPC3 (N241 in human) and C-mannosylated tryptophans of the Unc5D thrombospondin-like domains. MD simulations, mass spectrometry and structure-based mutants validate the crystallographic data. Anti-GPC3 nanobodies enhance or weaken Unc5-GPC3 binding and, together with mutant proteins, show that Unc5/GPC3 guide migrating pyramidal neurons in the mouse cortex, and cancer cells in an embryonic xenograft neuroblastoma model. The results demonstrate a conserved structural mechanism of cell guidance, where finely balanced Unc5-GPC3 interactions regulate cell migration.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Context-dependent signaling networks formed by different cell surface proteins direct brain development. Guidance receptors of the Uncoordinated-5 family (Unc5A–D) have emerged as key players in navigating cells and axons ( Hong et al., 1999 44. Hong, K. ∙ Hinck, L. ∙ Nishiyama, M. ...

A ligand-gated association between cytoplasmic domains of UNC5 and DCC family receptors converts netrin-induced growth cone attraction to repulsion Cell. 1999; 97 :927-941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unc5D receptors guide neurons during radial migration, a key process that is required for the formation of functionally distinct cortical layers ( Miyoshi and Fishell, 2012 74. Miyoshi, G. ∙ Fishell, G.

In this process, pyramidal neurons born from germinal layers are initially multipolar, as they move from the subventricular zone (SVZ) through the intermediate zone (IZ). In the upper IZ, these neurons transition to a bipolar morphology and attach to fibers of apical progenitor (AP) cells, enter the cortical plate (CP), and settle in their appropriate layer ( Tabata and Nakajima, 2003 108. Tabata, H. ∙ Nakajima, K. Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :9996-10001 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Unc5D is one of few molecular receptors known to regulate the switch from multipolar to bipolar migration. Altering Unc5D expression disrupts multipolar to bipolar transition, delays cortical migration, and affects layering of the mouse cortex ( Miyoshi and Fishell, 2012 74. Miyoshi, G. ∙ Fishell, G. Dynamic FoxG1 expression coordinates the integration of multipolar pyramidal neuron precursors into the cortical plate Neuron. 2012; 74 :1045-1058 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). Netrin expression is low during radial migration, but FLRT2 is shed from cells in the CP, and prevents premature migration of Unc5D-expressing neurons ( Yamagishi et al., 2011 128. Yamagishi, S. ∙ Hampel, F. ∙ Hata, K. ... FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons EMBO J. 2011; 30 :2920-2933 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unc5 receptors consist of two extracellular immunoglobulin domains (Ig1–2), two extracellular thrombospondin-like domains (TSP1–2), a single transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal intracellular supramodule, which contains a ZO-1/Unc5 (ZU5), an Unc5/PIDD/Ankyrin (UPA), and a death domain (DD) ( Figure 1 A). We previously solved the ectodomain structure of human Unc5A isoform 1, which lacks TSP1 ( Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), and rat Unc5D Ig1-Ig2-TSP1 in complex with FLRT2 and Latrophilin 3 ( Jackson et al., 2016 49. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 , 11184 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ). The structures revealed a linear arrangement of Unc5 Ig and TSP domains. FLRT binds at the N-terminal Ig1 domain. The crystal structure of the Unc5B ZU5-UPA-DD is also known and revealed a closed, autoinhibitory configuration ( Wang et al., 2009 119. Wang, R. ∙ Wei, Z. ∙ Jin, H. ...

In agreement with previous findings ( Verschueren et al., 2020 114. Verschueren, E. ∙ Husain, B. ∙ Yuen, K. ... The Immunoglobulin Superfamily Receptome Defines Cancer-Relevant Networks Associated with Clinical Outcome Cell. 2020; 182 :329-344.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we show that Unc5 receptors directly and functionally interact with the morphogen receptor glypican-3 (GPC3). All glypicans share a similar architecture: a structured N-terminal extracellular core domain, followed by a C-terminal linker region of ∼80 amino acids ( Kim et al., 2011 53.

Cell Biol.). 2003; 163 :625-635 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cleavage of this site results in the formation of two fragments that remain covalently attached ( de Cat et al., 2003 21. de Cat, B. ∙ Muyldermans, S.Y. ∙ Coomans, C. ...

Cell Biol.). 2003; 163 :625-635 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ). The C-terminal linker carries a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that tethers the protein to the cell surface, and is an attachment site for heparan sulfate (HS) glycans ( David et al., 1990 26. David, G. ∙ Lories, V. ∙ Decock, B. ... Molecular cloning of a phosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan from human lung fibroblasts JCB (J.

Structures to show how these proteins interact with GPC3 have not been reported.
Mutations in GPC3 cause Simpson-Golabi-Behmel overgrowth syndrome (SGBS), a genetic disorder that presents with visceral and skeletal abnormalities and an increased risk of cancer ( Cano-Gauci et al., 1999 15.

SGBS patients also display mild/moderate intellectual deficiencies and malformations of cortical development ( Barkovich et al., 2012 6. Barkovich, A.J. ∙ Guerrini, R. ∙ Kuzniecky, R.I. ...

The expression of Unc5 receptors is affected in a variety of cancers ( Mehlen and Guenebeaud, 2010 70. Mehlen, P. ∙ Guenebeaud, C. Netrin-1 and its dependence receptors as original targets for cancer therapy Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2010; 22 :46-54 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ), and is of prognostic value in neuroblastoma, where it drives tumor cell ability to migrate and/or survive ( Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2009 28.

Overexpression of the dependence receptor UNC5H4 inhibits cell migration and invasion, and triggers apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell Tumour Biol. 2014; 35 :5417-5425 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recently developed the first relevant in vivo xenograft model, by grafting human neuroblastoma cells arising from the sympathoadrenal lineage of the neural crest into the equivalent site in chick embryos ( Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2017 29.

Using this model, we demonstrated that neuroblastoma cells exploit semaphorin3c/neuropilin/plexin signaling, and use exogenous signals such as olfactomedin 1, for metastatic dissemination and to navigate a stereotypical migration pathway, which resembles that seen in patients ( ben Amar et al., 2022 3. ben Amar, D. ∙ Thoinet, K. ∙ Villalard, B. ...

GPC3 is widely expressed in embryonal tumors ( Ortiz et al., 2019 79. Ortiz, M.v. ∙ Roberts, S.S. ∙ Glade Bender, J. ... Immunotherapeutic Targeting of GPC3 in Pediatric Solid Embryonal Tumors 2019 Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar ) and was detected in a subset of aggressive neuroblastoma samples ( Dong et al., 2020 30.

Here, we present crystal structures that reveal a striking GPC3:Unc5D (4:4) octameric arrangement. Structured glycan-glycan interactions link C-mannosylated Unc5D tryptophans to an N-linked glycan on GPC3. Protein-protein interactions are formed along the concave face of GPC3 and all three N-terminal domains of Unc5D. We use mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations to characterize these interfaces, and present mutants that no longer interact. Anti-GPC3 nanobodies disrupt or enhance Unc5-binding. In vitro , we show that Unc5-GPC3 signaling elicits a repulsive cellular response. In the developing mouse cortex, we find that AP cells present GPC3 that acts as a ligand for neuronal Unc5D. We also show that Unc5/GPC3 signaling is essential for the collective migration of neural-crest derived neuroblastoma cells to their target sympathoadrenal derivatives.

Section: Results

We solved crystal structures of GPC3 residues 32–483 (hGPC3 core ) and murine GPC3 residues 31–482 (mGPC3 core ). Human and murine GPC3 sequences are 94% identical and the two structures are similar (Cα root-mean-square deviation, RMSD Cα = 0.54 Å for 353 aligned atoms; Figures 1 B and S1 A). Compared to previously solved structures of fly DLP and human GPC1, GPC3 has a more curved shape ( Figure 1 C). Superposition of hGPC1 ( Awad et al., 2015 5. Awad, W. ∙ Adamczyk, B. ∙ Örnros, J. ... Structural aspects of N-glycosylations and the C-terminal region in human glypican-1 J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :22991-23008 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and hGPC3 core results in an RMSD Cα = 8.87 Å (for 358 aligned atoms). We modeled glycans on two predicted N-glycosylation sites (N124 and N241 in hGPC3, Figure 1 B, N123 and N240 in mGPC3) into evident electron density ( Figure S1 B). Crystallographic details are summarized in Table S1 .
During an unbiased enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ( Ozgul et al., 2019 80. Ozgul, S. ∙ von Daake, S. ∙ Kakehi, S. ... An ELISA-Based Screening Platform for Ligand-Receptor Discovery Methods Enzymol. 2019; 615 :453-475 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ranaivoson et al., 2019 88.

A Proteomic Screen of Neuronal Cell-Surface Molecules Reveals IgLONs as Structurally Conserved Interaction Modules at the Synapse Structure. 2019; 27 :893-906.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we confirmed the interaction of Unc5D with FLRT2 and FLRT3 and identified GPC3 as a ligand for Unc5D ( Figure S1 C). We confirmed the interaction using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments with purified ectodomains ( Figure S1 D). To produce complex crystals, we mixed hGPC3 core , mGPC3 core or murine GPC3 residues 31–488 (mGPC3 488 ) with Rattus norvegicus Unc5D residues 32–307 (rUnc5D IgIgTSP ). The complexes crystallized in two different space groups ( Table S1 ) with different crystal packing. Strikingly, all three datasets revealed an octameric assembly ( Figures 1 D–1I, S1 E, and Video S1 ). The center of the octamer is formed by four Unc5D molecules that are aligned in a “head-to-tail” antiparallel bundle. Two GPC3 molecules wrap around each end of the Unc5 tetramer. Each GPC3 chain interacts with three Unc5 chains, forming interfaces with the Ig1/Ig2 domains of two Unc5 molecules, and with a TSP1 domain of a third Unc5 molecule ( Figures 1 D–1I).
We performed native mass spectrometry to assess the stoichiometry of the complex outside a crystal lattice. Wild type (WT) GPC3 protein did not give clean signals using this method. We speculated that this may be due to a mixture of cleaved and uncleaved protein in our samples, which is only partially processed at the conserved furin-like convertase site in the C-lobe. To produce a more homogeneous sample for mass spectrometry, we introduced two-point mutations in the furin cleavage site (R355A, R358A). Mixed with rUnc5D IgIgTSP , we revealed masses corresponding to the octamer and its subfragments: 1:1 Unc5D-Gpc3 dimers (93 kDa), 2:2 tetramers (185 kDa) and the full 4:4 octamer (370 kDa) ( Figure 2 A). Each peak was subjected to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to validate the peak components ( Figures S1 F–S1H). These results support our structural conclusions.
The octameric arrangement of the complex involves three main interfaces, in which the highly sequence-conserved concave surface of GPC3 core contacts the three N-terminal domains of Unc5: Ig1, Ig2, and TSP1 ( Figure S1 I). SPR experiments show that both the Ig domains alone, or the TSP domains alone, are not sufficient for detectable binding to GPC3 ( Figures 2 B–2E). This arrangement contrasts with that of Unc5-FLRT complexes, where a single interface forms between the FLRT leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain and Unc5 Ig1 ( Jackson et al., 2016 49. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 , 11184 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ; Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement with our conclusions, the human isoform 1 of Unc5A, which lacks TSP1 and therefore incudes only Ig1, Ig2, and TSP2 (hUnc5A iso1 ), is unable to bind GPC3 ( Figure S1 J). Unc5 sequence alignments show that conserved GPC3-binding residues are missing in this isoform ( Document S1 ). To better characterize the protein-protein binding interfaces, we performed 500 ns of molecular dynamics simulations of the hGPC3 core -rUnc5D IgIgTSP complex. Averaged stable interactions at the main interfaces ( Figures 2 F–2H) are shown in Figures 2 I and 2J. Equivalent data for each copy in the octamer is shown in Figures S2 A–S2C.
Interface 1 is located at the C lobe of GPC3 and interfaces with the Ig1 and Ig2 domains of Unc5D, burying a surface of ∼690 Å 2 (mGPC3 complex) or ∼640 Å 2 (hGPC3 complex). Charge complementarity of the interface is provided by hGPC3 (R120, E143, E147, D151, D160, D165) and rUnc5D (R118, E122, D123, R156, K157) ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 A). The largest interface, 2, is formed between the Unc5D TSP1/Ig2 domains and the M lobe of GPC3, burying ∼1440 Å 2 (mGPC3 complex) or ∼1330 Å 2 (hGPC3 complex) of protein surface. Hydrophobic residues line both sides: rUnc5D I170, A281, P282, L283, F288, and hGPC3 L157, L235. Hydrophobic interactions are complemented by hydrogen bonding and charged interactions, such as hGPC3 E238, which interacts with the backbone of rUnc5D A281 ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 B). Interface 3 involves the N lobe of GPC3 and contains many charged and hydrogen-bonding interactions ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 C). The interacting surfaces are contributed by distinct patches on Unc5D, located on Ig1 and Ig2. The buried surface is ∼390 Å 2 (mGPC3 complex) or ∼360 Å 2 (hGPC3 complex). Within the octameric arrangement, the antiparallel Unc5D chains also form interactions between themselves, especially at the Ig2 domains: the buried surface amounts to ∼900 Å 2 and ∼840 Å 2 for the major antiparallel packing interactions within the Unc5 bundle.
Recent work showed that the TSP domains of Unc5 receptors are C-mannosylated at tryptophan residues W 1 and W 2 of the consensus sequence W 1 xxW 2 xxW 3 ( Shcherbakova et al., 2019 103. Shcherbakova, A. ∙ Preller, M. ∙ Taft, M.H. ... C-mannosylation supports folding and enhances stability of thrombospondin repeats Elife. 2019; 8 :e52978 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). We revisited our 2.4 Å-resolution published crystallographic data for hUnc5A iso ( Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) and noticed evidence for C-mannosylation (Trp245 and Trp248), Figures S2 D and S2E. We purified hUnc5A iso1 , hUnc5B IgIgTSP (residues 26–303), mUnc5C IgIgTSP (residues 40–317), and rUnc5D IgIgTSP from HEK293T cells. Mass spectrometry shows that the first two tryptophan residues (W 1 and W 2 ) were C-mannosylated in all Unc5 homologues tested ( Figures S2 F–S2I). In agreement with these results, we observed electron density for these glycans in the crystallographic maps.
N-linked glycan chains are flexible and usually not defined in crystal structures unless they are held in place by specific interactions. The electron density maps calculated for the GPC3-Unc5D complexes revealed extra density extending from hGPC3 N241, one of the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, toward the center of the complex. This glycan packs closely against C-mannosylated tryptophans 253 and 256 of rUnc5D TSP1 ( Figures 2 K–2N). We sought to remove this glycan in vitro to test its function. Attempts to remove it using endoglycosidases (EndoF1 or PNGase F) were not successful, as the glycan remained uncleaved. We therefore mutated the site (N241Q) to produce a hGPC3 protein that lacks a glycan at this position. The resulting mutant protein was readily expressed and secreted by HEK293 cells. A cell-based binding assay and SPR experiments showed that the N241Q mutant had lost affinity for Unc5A–D ( Figures 3 A–3D, S3 A, and S3B). To be consistent with previously used nomenclature we will refer to this mutant as GPC3 UG , with UG standing for “non-Unc5-binding GPC3”, throughout the rest of this manuscript. To produce non-GPC3 mutants of Unc5, we used an established approach where an artificial N-linked glycosylation site is engineered to disrupt protein-interaction ( Jackson et al., 2015 48.

These Unc5 mutants contain a mutation in binding interface 2 (A277N + L279T in hUnc5B) and still bind the canonical ligand FLRT2 but not GPC3 ( Figures 3 B and 3 S3 C). In analogy to previous nomenclature, we call the resulting non-GPC3 binding mutants: Unc5 GU .
The geometry of the octameric complex begs the question whether these proteins interact on the surface of the same cells “ in cis ” or across cells “ in trans ”. We used an established cell aggregation assay using K562 cells ( Berns et al., 2018 9. Berns, D.S. ∙ DeNardo, L.A. ∙ Pederick, D.T. ... Teneurin-3 controls topographic circuit assembly in the hippocampus Nature. 2018; 554 :328-333 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pederick et al., 2021 83.

Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) to assess “ trans ” interactions. The protein constructs used in this assay are “full length” and therefore anchored at the cell surface. We found that Unc5D-expressing cells bind and aggregate with GPC3-expressing cells in vitro ( Figures 3 E and 3F). The cells did not aggregate when we replaced the WT proteins with either rUnc5D GU or hGPC3 UG . Conversely, the non-FLRT binding rUnc5D (rUnc5D FU ; Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) causes aggregation with GPC3-expressing cells, confirming that the affected binding sites are distinct ( Figures 3 E and 3F), as supported also by the structural data. Next, we co-expressed Unc5D and GPC3 on the same population of cells to test whether in cis binding interferes with the trans interaction, as seen for other receptors ( Carvalho et al., 2006 19. Carvalho, R.F. ∙ Beutler, M. ∙ Marler, K.J.M. ... Silencing of EphA3 through a cis interaction with ephrinA5 Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9 :322-330 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that cells co-expressing rUnc5D and hGPC3 did not aggregate ( Figures 3 G and 3H), indicating that in cis -interaction silences trans binding. In agreement with this finding, co-expression of WT rUnc5D + hGPC3 UG on one cell population and WT hGPC3 + rUnc5D GU on the other population led to aggregation, showing that in cis interaction, rather than just co-expression, is required for silencing. In cis silencing can occur due to sequestering of binding surfaces on the cell surface, or due to inhibition of cell surface presentation of complexed proteins. We quantified the expression of the receptors using western blot analysis of whole cells and by cell surface immunostaining. The results demonstrated that co-expression does not prevent cell surface presentation of the receptors ( Figures S3 D–S3H). Taken together, the data suggest a mechanism by which the interaction can occur in cis or in trans . However, when the proteins bind in cis , then silencing of trans interaction occurs by occupying the available interaction sites.
To generate additional tools for the functional characterization of the interaction, we characterized two llama-derived heavy-chain antibody-derived nanobodies, which bind to murine and human GPC3 core ( Figures 4 A–4C). Pull-down data suggests that one nanobody enhances complex formation between GPC3 and Unc5B (Nano glue ), while another inhibits it (Nano break ) ( Figure 4 D). We confirmed these results for Unc5A–D using SPR experiments ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S4 A–S4F). The pull down and SPR results also show that Nano break has an overall weaker affinity compared to Nano glue . Consistent with the protein-binding studies, cell-cell aggregation assays showed that the addition of nanobody Nano break , and not Nano glue , inhibits Unc5D-GPC3 mediated cell-cell adhesion ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Of note, we did not observe enhanced aggregation with Nano glue in this assay, which may be due to the strong aggregation phenotype observed, also in absence of the nanobody.
Unc5 receptors are known for their repulsive signaling in neuronal cell guidance ( Round and Stein, 2007 92. Round, J. ∙ Stein, E. Netrin signaling leading to directed growth cone steering Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamagishi et al., 2011 128. Yamagishi, S. ∙ Hampel, F. ∙ Hata, K. ... FLRT2 and FLRT3 act as repulsive guidance cues for Unc5-positive neurons EMBO J. 2011; 30 :2920-2933 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess if GPC3-Unc5 interaction is mediating contact-repulsion, we used stripe assays with cells known to express Unc5 receptors endogenously ( Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2009 28. Delloye-Bourgeois, C. ∙ Fitamant, J. ∙ Paradisi, A. ... Netrin-1 acts as a survival factor for aggressive Neuroblastoma J. Exp.

Wang, H. ∙ Zhang, B. ∙ Gu, M. ... Overexpression of the dependence receptor UNC5H4 inhibits cell migration and invasion, and triggers apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell Tumour Biol. 2014; 35 :5417-5425 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were plated on alternating stripes containing purified GPC3 core and the mutant GPC3 coreUG . In these assays, cortical neurons preferentially migrated on the mutant protein stripes, demonstrating that GPC3 core elicits a repulsive effect via an Unc5-dependent mechanism ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Interestingly, when given the choice between GPC3 core (WT or mutant) and neutral Fc protein, the neurons were strongly repelled by both WT and the mutant protein. This suggests that unknown additional GPC3-receptors, who do not depend on the Unc5-GPC3 interaction, also cause repulsion from GPC3 core ( Figures S4 G and S4H). Further, we tested HeLa, N2A, and SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines in stripe assays. As observed for the neurons, these cells preferred to grow on mutant, rather than WT, GPC3 protein ( Figure 4 J). We also tested the effects of nanobodies in these stripe assays. We tetramerized the nanobodies via a biotinylated linker and streptavidin to increase their affinity and potency. For N2A, SY5Y, and HeLa cells, the addition of nanobodies to the culture medium tended to enhance (Nano glue ) or decrease (Nano break ) cell repulsion from WT GPC3-containing stripes ( Figure 4 K), consistent with their functions to increase or decrease GPC3-Unc5 interactions, respectively. We attempted this assay with cortical neurons, however the addition of Nano glue led to immobilization of neurons on the stripe surface and we were unable to quantify any migratory behavior (not shown). As for N2A, SY5Y, and HeLa cells, addition of Nano break reduced the preference of neurons for GPC3 coreUG over GPC3 core . We conclude that the GPC3-Unc5 interaction mediates contact-repulsion in these assays and may contribute to cellular navigation in cortical and neuroblastoma cells.
Glypicans show specific patterns of expression during CNS development, with five out of six known glypicans (GPC1–4 and GPC6) expressed at earlier stages of brain development ( Ford-Perriss et al., 2003 35. Ford-Perriss, M. ∙ Turner, K. ∙ Guimond, S. ... Localisation of specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans during the proliferative phase of brain development Dev Dyn. 2003; 227 :170-184 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in neural stem cells ( Oikari et al., 2016 78. Oikari, L.E. ∙ Okolicsanyi, R.K. ∙ Qin, A. ... Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans as novel markers of human neural stem cell fate determination Stem Cell Res. 2016; 16 :92-104 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). In situ hybridization (ISH) for GPC3 showed restricted expression to the germinal layers, predominantly at the ventricular zone (VZ) where AP cells are located from embryonic days (E)13.5 to E17.5 ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S5 A–S5C). Unc5D showed strong expression in areas enriched in young/migrating neurons (SVZ/IZ) as reported previously ( Miyoshi and Fishell, 2012 74. Miyoshi, G. ∙ Fishell, G. Dynamic FoxG1 expression coordinates the integration of multipolar pyramidal neuron precursors into the cortical plate Neuron. 2012; 74 :1045-1058 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ; Takemoto et al., 2011 109.

These results were confirmed by co-staining with the neuronal marker Ctip2 and the AP marker Pvim ( Figure 5 C). Analysis using data from two single-cell RNA-seq databases showed that Unc5D is enriched in migrating neurons, whereas GPC3 is expressed predominantly in AP cells, from E13.5 to E17.5 ( Florio et al., 2015 34. Florio, M. ∙ Albert, M. ∙ Taverna, E. ... Human-specific gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and neocortex expansion Science. 2015; 347 :1465-1470 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 D) ( di Bella et al., 2021 8. di Bella, D.J. ∙ Habibi, E. ∙ Stickels, R.R. ... Molecular logic of cellular diversification in the mouse cerebral cortex Nature. 2021; 595 :554-559 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 5 E,5F, S5 D, and S5E). Distribution analysis using categorized clusters showed that 66% of Unc5D-positive cells are migrating neurons, whereas 57% of GPC3+ cells are APs at E15.5 ( Figure 5 G). Pull-down experiments using Nano glue in E15.5 mouse cortex lysate led to enrichment of GPC3 protein. Moreover, Unc5D co-immunoprecipitated with GPC3, suggesting that the two proteins interact, at least in the context of this experiment ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Consistent with the expression data, we found that GPC3 protein is present in the germinal zone, mainly where the AP cell bodies are located within the VZ, and to a lower extent in the IZ and CP, where the pattern resembles that of AP fibers and their endfeet ( Figure 5 J). Based on these results, we developed a working model in which migrating neurons expressing Unc5D interact with GPC3 present in AP cells ( Figure 5 K).
To study the effects of Unc5-GPC3 binding on cortical neuron migration, we used in-utero electroporation (IUE) at E13.5. We previously showed that the overexpression of signaling-deficient, but otherwise active, receptor fragments is an effective way of interfering with endogenous interactions ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we over-expressed rUnc5D IgIgTSP in migrating neurons ( Figure 6 A). Consistent with the role of Unc5D in radial migration, expression of the secreted ectodomain produced a strong delay in neuronal migration ( Figures 6 A and 6B). The accumulation observed in the IZ resembles the phenotype seen when full length Unc5D is over-expressed in migrating neurons ( Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamagishi et al., 2011 128.

This effect was partially rescued when using the mutant Unc5D IgIgTSPGU ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S6 A), confirming that the migration delay is at least partially due to interaction with GPC3. In an alternative approach to reduce interactions, we knocked down endogenous GPC3 in E13.5 cortices using the small hairpin RNA (shRNA) target sequence in the pCAG-miR30 vector system ( Matsuda and Cepko, 2007 67. Matsuda, T. ∙ Cepko, C.L. Controlled expression of transgenes introduced by in vivo electroporation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104 :1027-1032 Crossref Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 B). We used the pCAG-BLBP vector ( Shariati et al., 2013 101. Shariati, S.A.M. ∙ Lau, P. ∙ Hassan, B.A. ... APLP2 regulates neuronal stem cell differentiation during cortical development J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :1268-1277 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to visualize the targeted AP cells and measured the distribution of WT neurons labeled with a mCherry reporter ( Gurtan et al., 2012 39. Gurtan, A.M. ∙ Lu, V. ∙ Bhutkar, A. ... In vivo structure-function analysis of human Dicer reveals directional processing of precursor miRNAs RNA. 2012; 18 :1116-1122 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 C). Analysis at E16.5 showed reduced migration of neurons along the fibers deficient for endogenous GPC3 protein ( Figures 6 C and 6D). We also over-expressed secreted Nano break and Nano glue using the same IUE approach ( Figure S6 C). Both Nano break and Nano glue over-expression caused significant delays in migration to the upper CP ( Figures 6 E and 6F). When categorizing the neurons based on their morphologies ( Figures S6 D–S6E), we did not observe differences between Nano glue and Nano break -overexpressing neurons and GFP controls ( Figure S6 F). Moreover, these neurons contain the differentiation marker Satb2 ( Figures S6 G and S6H), suggesting that the nanobodies affect the migration, but not the morphology/differentiation, of the cells. Taken together, these results show that Unc5-GPC3 interactions regulate cortical migration in vivo .
The phenotypes observed in cortical migration, together with the widely documented roles of Unc5 and GPC3 in cancer, led us to investigate whether Unc5/GPC3 interaction plays a role in neuroblastoma cell migration. We analyzed the expression of GPC3 and Unc5 in published single cell RNA-seq data from 16 different neuroblastoma patient samples ( Dong et al., 2020 30. Dong, R. ∙ Yang, R. ∙ Zhan, Y. ... Single-Cell Characterization of Malignant Phenotypes and Developmental Trajectories of Adrenal Neuroblastoma Cancer Cell. 2020; 38 :716-733.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unsupervised clustering of patients’ cell data led to a segregation of tumor cells from those of the stroma ( Figures 7 A and 7 S7 A). The fraction of tumor cells expressing at least one Unc5 receptor was higher in the tumor cell cluster as compared to other cell types ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Endothelial cells also highly express Unc5 receptors, especially Unc5B, as shown by others ( Larrivée et al., 2007 54. Larrivée, B. ∙ Freitas, C. ∙ Trombe, M. ... Activation of the UNC5B receptor by Netrin-1 inhibits sprouting angiogenesis Genes Dev. 2007; 21 :2433-2447 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2004 62. Lu, X. ∙ le Noble, F. ∙ Yuan, L. ... The netrin receptor UNC5B mediates guidance events controlling morphogenesis of the vascular system Nature. 2004; 432 :179-186 Crossref Scopus (438) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, although GPC3 was detected in a fraction of tumor cells, its expression was more frequent (29%) in fibroblastic cells of the tumor microenvironment ( Figure 7 A). As found for the patient tumor cells, different neuroblastoma cell lines also expressed Unc5 receptors and some GPC3 ( Figure 7 B). We selected the SY5Y cell line to further study potential roles of GPC3-Unc5 interactions in neuroblastoma cell migration. GPC3 and Unc5 receptor proteins have been detected in these cells at the protein level ( Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2009 28. Delloye-Bourgeois, C. ∙ Fitamant, J. ∙ Paradisi, A. ... Netrin-1 acts as a survival factor for aggressive Neuroblastoma J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :833-847 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Heidler et al., 2018 43.

Human-specific GPC3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the expression of GPC3 by 71% (±11%, 48 h after transfection) ( Figure S7 D). In a Transwell assay, GPC3 siRNA-transfected cells migrated less compared to mock-transfected cells ( Figure S7 E), suggesting a role for GPC3 signaling in these cells. SY5Y cells also readily over-expressed transfected constructs, such as our secreted nanobodies ( Figure S7 F). We used our previously established in vivo model for neuroblastoma ( Delloye-Bourgeois et al., 2017 29. Delloye-Bourgeois, C. ∙ Bertin, L. ∙ Thoinet, K. ... Microenvironment-Driven Shift of Cohesion/Detachment Balance within Tumors Induces a Switch toward Metastasis in Neuroblastoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :427-443.e8 e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 7 C–7H and S7 G). Neuroblastoma cells are engrafted within the avian pre-migratory trunk neural crest and migrate following a stereotypical ventral migratory path to the developing sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. There, they express characteristic tumor features, forming tumor masses before undergoing secondary metastatic-like dissemination. Compared to embryos engrafted with scramble small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected SY5Y, GPC3 siRNA-transfected cells formed tumor masses almost exclusively outside the proximal and distal sympatho-adrenal (SA) territories ( Figures 7 C and 7D). In addition to being mistargeted, a high proportion of cells were dispersed rather than integrated in the collective migration flow. These isolated cells were either delayed within the stereotyped ventral migratory route or mislocated outside of the neural crest stream. The results suggest that interfering with the neuroblastoma source of GPC3 disrupts cell migration and targeting to the primary tumor site. Next, we over-expressed wild-type rUnc5D lglgTSP and the mutant r Unc5D lglgTSPGU in SY5Y cells prior to grafting. Both conditions resulted in an increase of isolated cells and tumor masses outside SA territories, suggesting that r Unc5D lglgTSP has GPC3-independent functions in this system. However, the experiments also demonstrated that r Unc5D lglgTSP WT protein promotes the formation of tumors in the most distal targets, resulting in tumor masses also below the dorsal aorta, in the developing adrenal gland and in enteric ganglia. Few individual cells were found in proximal SA derivatives ( Figures 7 E and 7F). In contrast, over-expression of r Unc5D lglgTSPGU enhanced the mistargeting of tumor masses and cells out of SA territories. The results demonstrated that Unc5-GPC3 interaction directs neuroblastoma collective migration, and that the “off-target” positions we revealed by overexpressing the mutant, must be caused by other interactions. We complemented these data by over-expressing secreted Nano break or Nano glue ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Expression of Nano break led to a modified migratory pattern: only a few isolated cells reached the sympatho-adrenal target derivatives, with most tumor masses formed outside. This phenotype is comparable to that found in the siRNA knockdown experiments described above. Interestingly, not only the nanobody-transfected SY5Y cells exhibited abnormal migratory and targeting patterns, but also the untransfected cells present in these grafting experiments. This suggests that Nano break has both autocrine and paracrine effects on the collectivity of migrating neuroblastoma cells. Conversely, we found that grafted cells expressing Nano glue had “enhanced” migratory properties, resulting in a preferential localization of tumor masses in the most distal trunk neural crest territories, similar to the over-expression of rUnc5D IgIgTSP . This was also reflected by the smaller number of cells that failed to reach the primary tumor site, and that these tumors were highly condensed. These results agree with the SY5Y in vitro stripe results presented in Figure 4 K, where Nano glue enhances the Unc5-GPC3 dependent cell response, while Nano break reduces it. Taken together, the results show that modifying the strength of GPC3-Unc5 interaction determines cancer cell migration properties and tumor targeting in the model presented.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Individual receptor-ligand interactions are embedded within complicated cell surface interactomes as most receptors bind multiple ligands. A variety of complexes are formed, depending on which binding partners are available. They drive many different context-dependent signaling pathways and cellular responses. This structural/functional complexity has hampered progress with understanding where specific signaling interactions act in vivo . Here, we have employed an integrated structure-function approach that uses engineered mutant proteins and nanobodies to focus on the interaction between Unc5 receptors and GPC3. The structural data shows that these proteins form an unexpectedly large multimeric complex, with four copies of each molecule arranged in a pseudo-symmetric arrangement. Interestingly, multimeric extracellular complexes that go beyond simple (1:1) receptor:ligand interactions are emerging for a range of important morphogen and guidance receptors, for example, FLRT/Lphn/Teneurin ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ...

Neuropilins lock secreted semaphorins onto plexins in a ternary signaling complex Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19 :1293-1299 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). This study and previous data also show how Unc5 engages in different complexes (with netrin, GPC3, FLRT, FLRT/Lphn), suggesting that a balance between different signaling configurations is dictated by the molecular composition of the environment. We found that under the harsh conditions of a native mass spectrometry experiment, the GPC3/Unc5D octamer partially disintegrates into smaller subcomponents that include 2:2 and 1:1 complexes. These presumably weaker assemblies could also have functions, perhaps at initial stages of complex formation ( Figures 2 A and S1 F–S1H). A comparison of different Unc5 structures also reveals unexpected similarities. For example, the antiparallel packing of Unc5D in the GPC3-mediated complex is reminiscent of the arrangement in the Unc5D/Latrophilin3/FLRT2 complex, despite the different complex architectures and stoichiometries ( Figures S7 I and S7J). This antiparallel conformation may present a specific functional state of Unc5D; for example, it may cause distancing of the intracellular signaling domains in cis or allow an antiparallel trans interaction of Unc5D across different cells.
Post-translational glycan modifications such as C-mannosylation are emerging critical factors in receptor biology. For example, C-mannosylation and N-linked fucosylation are involved in mediating RTN4/NoGo receptor interaction with the adhesion GPCR BAI in synapse formation and neuron-glia interaction ( Wang et al., 2021 118. Wang, J. ∙ Miao, Y. ∙ Wicklein, R. ... RTN4/NoGo-receptor binding to BAI adhesion-GPCRs regulates neuronal development Cell. 2021; 184 :5869-5885.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interleukin-21 receptor is stabilized by an N-linked glycan that packs against mannosylated tryptophans ( Hamming et al., 2012 42. Hamming, O.J. ∙ Kang, L. ∙ Svensson, A. ... Crystal structure of interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) bound to IL-21 reveals that sugar chain interacting with WSXWS motif is integral part of IL-21R J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :9454-9460 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Enzymatic C-mannosylation of Unc5 receptors by DPY19L1 is required for effective folding and stability of Unc5 TSP domains ( Shcherbakova et al., 2017 102. Shcherbakova, A. ∙ Tiemann, B. ∙ Buettner, F.F.R. ... Distinct C-mannosylation of netrin receptor thrombospondin type 1 repeats by mammalian DPY19L1 and DPY19L3 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114 :2574-2579 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 103. Shcherbakova, A. ∙ Preller, M. ∙ Taft, M.H. ... C-mannosylation supports folding and enhances stability of thrombospondin repeats Elife. 2019; 8 :e52978 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show here that these C-mannosylated trytophans are also involved in GPC3-binding. Unc5 C-mannosylation plays a role in C.elegans neuroblast migration ( Buettner et al., 2013 13. Buettner, F. ∙ Ashikov, A. ∙ Tiemann, B. ... C. elegans DPY-19 is a C-mannosyltransferase glycosylating thrombospondin repeats Mol Cell. 2013; 50 :295-302 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the interacting hGPC3 N-linked glycan shown here ( Figures 2 K–2N) is not conserved in C.elegans. This suggests that the complex may not form in C.elegans , or assemble differently, perhaps involving Unc-40/DCC, which binds LON-2/GPC3, and affects Unc5 signaling ( Blanchette et al., 2015 10. Blanchette, C.R. ∙ Perrat, P.N. ∙ Thackeray, A. ... Glypican is a modulator of netrin-mediated axon guidance PLoS Biol. 2015; 13 :e1002183 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Nanobodies are increasingly used to modulate protein functions, including also in clinical usage ( Yang and Shah, 2020 129. Yang, E.Y. ∙ Shah, K. Nanobodies: Next Generation of Cancer Diagnostics and Therapeutics Front. Oncol. 2020; 10 :1182 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) due to their small, compact, monovalent and rigid structure, and deep tissue penetration. Here we presented Nano glue and Nano break to modulate Unc5-GPC3 interactions in vitro/vivo in monovalent form, or as tetrameric streptavidin-complexes, with enhanced binding capacities.
Neural crest-like neuroblastoma and cortical radial migration are established paradigms of cellular migration, with distinct characteristics: neuroblastoma cells undergo collective migration following a typical path through the embryonic tissue, whereas radial migration from the intermediate zone to the cortical plate relies on interactions of individual neurons with AP scaffolds. Neuroblastoma cells express varying levels of GPC3 and Unc5 receptors, with further Unc5 and GPC3 expressed in their environment. Young cortical neurons express mainly Unc5D receptors, while AP cells express GPC3 ( Figures S7 K–S7N). In the cortex, we find that modulating GPC3-Unc5 interaction leads to impaired radial migration. This is reminiscent of previous studies showing that any alteration to the finely balanced adhesive or repulsive forces has a detrimental impact on the migration of these neurons ( Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that the reduction of Unc5-GPC3 interactions between APs and neurons removes a repulsive force that otherwise helps the neurons detach from their scaffold as they move forward, and thereby causes migration delays. This would be consistent with studies showing that removal of other repulsive guidance factors, such as the Latrophilin-Teneurin/FLRT interaction also delays radial migration ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analogous results have been obtained with other major guidance and adhesion systems, where cell migration is reduced by modulating adhesion or repulsion. Indeed, increased integrin-mediated adhesion ( Haage et al., 2020 40. Haage, A. ∙ Wagner, K. ∙ Deng, W. ... Precise Coordination of Cell-ECM Adhesion Is Essential for Efficient Melanoblast Migration during Development Development. 2020; 147 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) or reduced Eph-EphrinB contact repulsion reduce cell motility ( Rohani et al., 2011 91. Rohani, N. ∙ Canty, L. ∙ Luu, O. ... EphrinB/EphB signaling controls embryonic germ layer separation by contact-induced cell detachment PLoS Biol. 2011; 9 , e1000597 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inhibiting fibronectin-integrin adhesion ( Ramos and DeSimone, 1996 87. Ramos, J.W. ∙ DeSimone, D.W. Xenopus embryonic cell adhesion to fibronectin: position-specific activation of RGD/synergy site-dependent migratory behavior at gastrulation J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134 :227-240 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) or increasing EphB-ephrinB repulsion ( Wen and Winklbauer, 2017 123. Wen, J.W. ∙ Winklbauer, R. Ingression-type cell migration drives vegetal endoderm internalisation in the Xenopus gastrula Elife. 2017; 6 :e27190 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) also impairs cell migration.
Unexpectedly, stabilizing the Unc5-GPC3 interaction artificially with Nano glue reduced radial migration in vivo . We hypothesize that stabilizing the interaction interfered with the release mechanism from the GPC3-presenting scaffolds in neurons. This would be consistent with the lack of neural migration observed in stripe assays in the presence of Nano glue .
Unlike cortical neurons, many cancer cells display collective migration ( te Boekhorst et al., 2016 11. te Boekhorst, V. ∙ Preziosi, L. ∙ Friedl, P. Plasticity of Cell Migration In Vivo and In Silico Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32 :491-526 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Piacentino et al., 2020 84. Piacentino, M.L. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Bronner, M.E. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and different migration strategies as viewed from the neural crest Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2020; 66 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our neuroblastoma model, GPC3-Unc5 signaling seems to act as a switch that determines cellular cohesion. Enhancing the interaction potentiates collective migration, whereas reducing it broke the migrating cell stream up. Cancer cells can reversibly switch from collective to individual migration mode for optimal adaptation to their context ( te Boekhorst et al., 2016, 2022 11. te Boekhorst, V. ∙ Preziosi, L. ∙ Friedl, P. Plasticity of Cell Migration In Vivo and In Silico Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2016; 32 :491-526 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar 12. te Boekhorst, V. ∙ Jiang, L. ∙ Mählen, M. ... Calpain-2 regulates hypoxia/HIF-induced plasticity toward amoeboid cancer cell migration and metastasis Curr. Biol. 2022; 32 :412-427.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Modulation of GPC3-Unc5 interactions could thus contribute to mediating such opportunistic migration plasticity. The precise mechanism of neural crest cell targeting is poorly understood, however our results suggest that GPC3-Unc5 interaction plays a role: reducing the interaction led to the premature stopping and forming of tumors, while enhancing the interaction resulted in migration beyond typical target areas. Some cells even migrated further, along a path normally taken by the enteric neural crest to target the developing gut. In analogy with the cortical migration paradigm, we find that GPC3-Unc5 signaling must be finely balanced to achieve effective collective migration and correct targeting, possibly because it could otherwise interfere with the perception of extracellular target recognition signals.
GPC3 and Unc5 are embedded within complex protein surface interactomes. For example, Unc5 receptors bind FLRTs ( Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Latrophilins ( Jackson et al., 2016 49. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 , 11184 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ). Given that these receptors are present in specific cortical cell populations ( Seiradake et al., 2014 99. Seiradake, E. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Nagel, D. ... FLRT Structure: Balancing Repulsion and Cell Adhesion in Cortical and Vascular Development Neuron. 2014; 84 :370-385 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), there could be competition for the formation of different Unc5-signalling hubs. GPC3 could be interacting with receptors other than Unc5, as suggested by our in vitro stripe data. For example, GPC3 binds Wnts ( Capurro et al., 2005 17. Capurro, M.I. ∙ Xiang, Y.Y. ∙ Lobe, C. ... Glypican-3 promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by stimulating canonical Wnt signaling Cancer Res. 2005; 65 :6245-6254 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ) and promotes canonical Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling ( Castillo et al., 2016 20. Castillo, L.F. ∙ Tascón, R. ∙ Huvelle, M.A.L. ... Glypican-3 induces a mesenchymal to epithelial transition in human breast cancer cells Oncotarget. 2016; 7 :60133-60154 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ), whose activation can provoke premature cortical migration ( Woodhead et al., 2006 127. Woodhead, G.J. ∙ Mutch, C.A. ∙ Olson, E.C. ... Cell-autonomous beta-catenin signaling regulates cortical precursor proliferation J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :12620-12630 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wnt also regulates neural crest migration, as does Latrophilin2 in different model organisms ( Becker and Wilting, 2018 7. Becker, J. ∙ Wilting, J. WNT signaling, the development of the sympathoadrenal-paraganglionic system and neuroblastoma Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75 :1057-1070 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yokote et al., 2019 130. Yokote, N. ∙ Suzuki-Kosaka, M.Y. ∙ Michiue, T. ... Latrophilin2 is involved in neural crest cell migration and placode patterning in Xenopus laevis Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2019; 63 :29-35 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). FLRT2 is expressed from early developmental stages in the trunk mesenchyme ( Haines et al., 2006 41. Haines, B.P. ∙ Wheldon, L.M. ∙ Summerbell, D. ... Regulated expression of FLRT genes implies a functional role in the regulation of FGF signalling during mouse development Dev. Biol. 2006; 297 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, structure-guided mutants and specific functional nanobodies enabled us to focus on the Unc5-GPC3 interaction, despite the presence of other ligands. Many remaining questions could be answered using these tools; for example, regarding the roles of Unc5 and GPC3 in other tissues such as lungs, kidneys ( Iglesias et al., 2008 47. Iglesias, B.v. ∙ Centeno, G. ∙ Pascuccelli, H. ... Expression pattern of glypican-3 (GPC3) during human embryonic and fetal development Histol.

Freitas, C. ∙ Larrivée, B. ∙ Eichmann, A. Netrins and UNC5 receptors in angiogenesis Angiogenesis. 2008; 11 :23-29 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ng et al., 2009 77.

Biol. 2009; 335 :208-215 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Unc5-GPC3-dependent mechanisms we found in neuroblastoma migration could apply to other disseminating cancers, given that GPC3 is an oncofetal protein expressed by many pediatric solid embryonal tumors ( Ortiz et al., 2019 79. Ortiz, M.v. ∙ Roberts, S.S. ∙ Glade Bender, J. ... Immunotherapeutic Targeting of GPC3 in Pediatric Solid Embryonal Tumors 2019 Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar ) and adult cancers ( Li et al., 2018 57. Li, N. ∙ Gao, W. ∙ Zhang, Y.-Z. ...

Shimizu, Y. ∙ Suzuki, T. ∙ Yoshikawa, T. ... Next-Generation Cancer Immunotherapy Targeting Glypican-3 Front Oncol. 2019; 10 Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar ).
Drawing conclusions across different levels of “resolution” (protein structures, cells, tissues) is challenging and relies on tools such as mutant proteins or functional nanobodies. Although these enable us to target specific protein-binding surfaces, we cannot rule out that other ligands use the same surfaces for binding and therefore could also be affected. We have mitigated this risk by targeting Unc5 and GPC3 individually in different experiments. A further limitation is that over-expression of proteins in vivo could lead to artifacts. We have used our mutants as controls to assess for such effects. Indeed, we found that there are interactions beyond those between Unc5-GPC3, for example in the stripe assays. We have shown that enhancing or inhibiting Unc5-GPC3 interaction impairs neuronal migration without affecting neuron morphology or differentiation. However, we have not measured the migration speed in these conditions. In the neuroblastoma model, the distribution and expression levels of endogenous and over-expressed proteins were not quantified. As above, we did not visualize the speed of migration directly, but inferred it from cell localization.

All mice (C57BL/6 background) were housed with a 12h:12h light:dark cycle and food/water available ad libitum . All animal experiments were used in accordance with the ethical guidelines (Declaration of Helsinki and NIH, publication no. 85-23, revised 1985, European Community Guidelines, and approved by the local ethical committee (University of Barcelona, 225/17 and Generalitat de Catalunya, 404/18).
Naked Neck strain embryonated eggs were obtained from a local supplier (Elevage avicole du Grand Buisson, Saint Maurice sur Dargoire, France). Laying hen’s sanitary status was regularly checked by the supplier according to French laws. Eggs were housed at 18°C until use. They were then incubated at 38.5°C in a humidified incubator until the desired developmental stage, i.e, HH14 for the graft step (54 h of incubation).

Media were each supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 25 U/mL Penicillin Streptomycin (Gibco), 2.5 μg/mL Amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich). K562 suspension cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% L-Glutamine. HEK293T and HEK293S cells were cultures in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5% L-Glutamine and 5% Non-Essential Amino Acids. Cell lines were maintained in sterile conditions in a 37°C, 5% CO2-incubator.
Neurons were dissociated from cortices of E15.5 embryos and cultured on stripes. Neurons were cultured for 1 day in vitro at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27. Neurons were used for stripe assays and were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by immunostaining.
We coned constructs of human GPC3 (cDNA clone BC035972) (hGPC3, residues 1–580; hGPC3 core , residues 32–483, UG mutant, N241Q), mouse GPC3 (Uniprot ID: Q8CFZ4 ) (mGPC3 ecto , residues 31–559; mGPC3 488 , residues 31–488; mGPC3 core , residues 31–482), mouse Unc5A (Uniprot ID: Q8K1S4 ) (mUnc5A ecto , residues 1–359), mouse Unc5B (Uniprot ID: Q8K1S3 ) (mUnc5B, residues 26–934; mUnc5B ecto , residues 26–362), into the Age1-Kpn1 or EcoR1-Kpn1 cloning site of vectors from the pHLSec family ( Aricescu et al., 2006 4.

A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1243-1250 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ). For protein purification, we used pHLSec vectors which also code for a C-terminal 6xHis-tag, for SPR we used a C-terminal Avi-tag. We used previously published rUnc5D constructs and derivatives thereof as indicated in the text ( Jackson et al., 2015 48. Jackson, V. ∙ del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero, M. ...

For cell binding and functional assays, full length constructs were used, either cloned into a pHLSec vector that encodes an intracellular mVenus, or the pCAGIG vector (Addgene; Matsuda and Cepko, 2004 66. Matsuda, T. ∙ Cepko, C. Electroporation and RNA interference in the rodent retina in vivo and in vitro Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004; 101 :16-22 Crossref Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ), for visualisation. pCAGIG was modified to express mCherry instead of GFP, for certain experiments, and is then referred to as pCAGIC. For the nanobody expression and purification in WK6, Nano glue and Nano break in pADL-23c vector were used. Nanobodies were cloned into pHLsec C-terminal Avi-tag, for biotinylation in HEK293T cells. They were subcloned in the pCAGIG vector with the pHLSec-derived secretion signal, for in vivo experiments. For the ELISA experiments, human Unc5D (residues 33–379, Uniprot ID: Q6UXZ4 ) and human GPC3 (residues 25–563, Uniprot ID: P51654 ) were cloned into a modified pCMV6-XL4 vector in frame with an N-terminal FLAG and C-terminal human Fc or alkaline phosphatase fragments.
An ELISA-based assay was used to identify novel ligands for Unc5D-AP. The experiment was done in duplicate. Twenty μL of a solution at 3 μg/mL of mouse anti-AP in 1X PBS was added to each well of 96-well plates using an automated multichannel pipette (Viaflo Assist, Integra), sealed and incubated overnight at 4C. The following day, the plate was washed once with PBS and 1% casein was added as a blocking agent, which was removed after 1 h at room temperature using an automated microplate washer (HydroSpeed, Tecan). Next, to each well, 20 μL of Unc5D-AP conditioned medium, containing 2 μL of monoclonal mouse anti-human IgG1-HRP was added using an automated plate copier (Viaflo96, Integra) along with 20 μL of culture medium from 95 different ecto-Fc prey proteins. Plates were sealed and incubated for 4 h at room temperature in the dark. Plates were subsequently washed, and 35 μL 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA HRP substrate was added using an automated multichannel pipette (Viaflo Assist, Integra); after 1 h incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 650 nm was recorded with a microplate Spectramax i3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Finally, plates were scanned to obtain matching images of the 650 nm reading. A positive control (known interactors NRXN/NLGN1) was used ( Ozgul et al., 2019 80. Ozgul, S. ∙ von Daake, S. ∙ Kakehi, S. ... An ELISA-Based Screening Platform for Ligand-Receptor Discovery Methods Enzymol. 2019; 615 :453-475 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Recombinant protein expression and purification were performed as described ( Aricescu et al., 2006 4. Aricescu, A.R. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Jones, E.Y. A time- and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production in mammalian cells Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2006; 62 :1243-1250 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seiradake et al., 2015 100. Seiradake, E. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Lu, W. ... Production of cell surface and secreted glycoproteins in mammalian cells Methods Mol. Biol. 2015; 1261 :115-127 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, adherent HEK293T or GnTI-deficient HEK293S cells were transiently transfected with the relevant plasmids using polyethylenimine (PEI) and grown for 5–10 days. Cell culture media were filtered to remove dead cells and buffer-exchanged to phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing also 250 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5). Conditioned media were passed through HisTrap HP columns (GE Healthcare), washed with buffer supplemented with 40 mM imidazole and bound proteins were eluted using 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole. The eluate was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 16/60 (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 200 mM NaCl.
Nanobodies were expressed in E. coli strain WK6., grown at 37°C in Terrific Broth until an OD600 = 0.8. Expression was induced with 150 μM IPTG and incubation at 21°C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000xg, 15 min). Cell pellets were resuspended and incubated in ice-cold 20% sucrose, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA buffer for 20 min. The cell suspension was clarified by centrifugation (10.000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). After the supernatant collection, cell pellets were resuspended and incubated in ice-cold 30 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgSO4 buffer for 20 min. The cell suspension was clarified by centrifugation (10.000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). The supernatant was filtered, supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM Imidazole and passed through HisTrap HP columns. The column was washed with 200 mL wash buffer (30 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole) and the protein was eluted in elution buffer (30 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole). Elution was loaded onto a Superdex200 16/600 HiLoad column in 20 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl.
For protein biotinylation in HEK293 cells, protein constructs in pHLsec C-terminal Avi-tag were co transfected with a vector encoding BirA (biotin ligase). Cell culture medium was supplemented with 100mM biotin. Proteins were purified as previously, but in ice-cold conditions. For the nanobody-streptavidin complexes, streptavidin (Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate, Thermo Fisher Scientific, or Streptavidin from Streptomyces avidinii , Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with an excess of biotinylated nanobodies, incubated overnight at 4°C and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 200 16/60 (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 200 mM NaCl.
Proteins that were expressed in GnTI-deficient HEK293S cells were used for crystallisation trials. Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method at 18°C by mixing the protein solution and crystallization solution in a 1:1 ratio. Purified hGPC3 core was concentrated to 5.3 mg/mL, and crystals were obtained using crystallization solution 1 (20% ethylene glycol, 10% w/v PEG 8000, 0.1 M Tris/BICINE (pH 8.5) and 0.02 M of amino acids (L-Na-glutamate, alanine, glycine, lysine-HCl, and serine)). Crystals of mGPC3 core were obtained by concentrating the protein to 9.9 mg/mL in the presence of 100 mM NDSB256 and using crystallization solution 2 (0.2 M ammonium nitrate and 20% w/v PEG3350). Crystals of the complex hGPC3 core and rUnc5D IgIgTSP were obtained by mixing the two proteins in a 1:1 M ratio and concentrating them to 5.8 mg/mL. The protein solution was then mixed with crystallisation solution 1. Crystals of the mGPC3 488 and rUnc5D IgIgTSP complex were obtained by mixing the two proteins in a 1:1 M ratio, concentrating to 7.1 mg/mL and mixing with 15% w/v PEG 3000, 20% v/v 1, 2, 4-butanetrol, 1% w/v NDSB 256, 0.1 M Gly-Gly/AMPD (pH 8.5) and 0.2 M of amino acids (DL-arginine HCl, DL-threonine, DL-histidine HCl H 2 O, DL-5-hydroxylysine HCl, trans -4-hydroxyl-L-proline).
Crystals of hGPC3 core , hGPC3 core /rUnc5D IgIgTSP and mGPC3 core /rUnc5D IgIgTSP were flash-cooled in their original crystallization condition. Crystals of mGPC3 core were cryoprotected by adding 20% v/v glycerol to the original crystallization solution. All diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron at 100K. Data was integrated using DIALS (via XIA2)( Winter et al., 2013, 2018 125. Winter, G. ∙ Lobley, C.M.C. ∙ Prince, S.M. Decision making in xia2 Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2013; 69 :1260-1273 Crossref Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar 126. Winter, G. ∙ Waterman, D.G. ∙ Parkhurst, J.M. ... DIALS : implementation and evaluation of a new integration package Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2018; 74 :85-97 Crossref Scopus (498) PubMed Google Scholar ), and integrated intensities were merged and scaled using programs from the CCP4 package ( Winn et al., 2011 124. Winn, M.D. ∙ Ballard, C.C. ∙ Cowtan, K.D. ... Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :235-242 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data of hGPC3 core /rUnc5D IgIgTSP was also processed with Staraniso ( Vonrhein et al., 2018 116. Vonrhein, C. ∙ Tickle, I.J. ∙ Flensburg, C. ... Advances in automated data analysis and processing within autoPROC, combined with improved characterisation, mitigation and visualisation of the anisotropy of diffraction limits using STARANISO Acta Crystallogr A Found Adv. 2018; 74 :a360 Crossref Google Scholar ). The structures were solved by molecular replacement (MR) using the models of h/mGPC3 core , rUnc5D IgIgTSP ( Jackson et al., 2016 49. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 , 11184 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ) and PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 68.

Initial phases of mGPC3 core were obtained by MR using the central lobe of GPC1 and DLP structures ( Awad et al., 2015 5. Awad, W. ∙ Adamczyk, B. ∙ Örnros, J. ...

A. 2011; 108 :13112-13117 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed iterative cycles of model building and refinement in Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 58. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.v. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (1937) PubMed Google Scholar ). Manual model building was performed in Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 31. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (23389) PubMed Google Scholar ), and models were all atom refined using REFMAC ( Murshudov et al., 2011 75. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Skubák, P. ∙ Lebedev, A.A. ... REFMAC5 for the refinement of macromolecular crystal structures Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr. 2011; 67 :355-367 Crossref Scopus (6011) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 58.

Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (1937) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the complexes, we used high-resolution models of individual components as targets, non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), TLS and secondary structure restraints. The quality of the final models was assessed by MolProbity ( Davis et al., 2007 27. Davis, I.W. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Chen, V.B. ... MolProbity: all-atom contacts and structure validation for proteins and nucleic acids Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W375-W383 Crossref Scopus (3030) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the CCP4i2 validation task ( Potterton et al., 2018 86. Potterton, L. ∙ Agirre, J. ∙ Ballard, C. ... CCP4i2: the new graphical user interface to the CCP4 program suite Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2018; 74 :68-84 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). Superpositions were done with Super-Pose ( Maiti et al., 2004 65. Maiti, R. ∙ Van Domselaar, G.H. ∙ Zhang, H. ... SuperPose: a simple server for sophisticated structural superposition Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 :W590-W594 Crossref Scopus (500) PubMed Google Scholar ).
N-glycans were built into positive omit electron density using the Coot N-linked carbohydrate building tool ( Emsley and Crispin, 2018 32. Emsley, P. ∙ Crispin, M. Structural analysis of glycoproteins: building N-linked glycans with Coot Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2018; 74 :256-263 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), then corrected manually where obvious discrepancies between map and model were encountered. The mannosylated tryptophans showed extra omit density consistent with this modification, which has been recently shown to force the mannoside moiety into a 1 C 4 conformation (an inverted chair) to keep the alpha linkage in a clash-avoiding equatorial conformation. In order to increase the observation to parameter ratio and restrain the mannoside’s ring conformation individually, external restraints for both N- and C-glycosylation were generated using the MKIV version of the Privateer software ( Agirre et al., 2015 2. Agirre, J. ∙ Iglesias-Fernández, J. ∙ Rovira, C. ... Privateer: software for the conformational validation of carbohydrate structures Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :833-834 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Restraints for the MAN-TRP covalent linkages were created using the AceDRG software ( Long et al., 2017 61. Long, F. ∙ Nicholls, R.A. ∙ Emsley, P. ... AceDRG: a stereochemical description generator for ligands Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2017; 73 :112-122 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) through its CCP4i2 interface ( Potterton et al., 2018 86. Potterton, L. ∙ Agirre, J. ∙ Ballard, C. ... CCP4i2: the new graphical user interface to the CCP4 program suite Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol. 2018; 74 :68-84 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycans were iteratively refined using the REFMAC5 software and validated by Privateer software ( Agirre et al., 2015 2. Agirre, J. ∙ Iglesias-Fernández, J. ∙ Rovira, C. ... Privateer: software for the conformational validation of carbohydrate structures Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :833-834 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To simulate the hGPC3-rUnc5D complex, we followed essentially the same protocol as previously described to refine the structures of X-ray crystallography-derived complexes ( Jackson et al., 2016 49. Jackson, V.A. ∙ Mehmood, S. ∙ Chavent, M. ... Super-complexes of adhesion GPCRs and neural guidance receptors Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 , 11184 Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar ; del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Missing residues were modeled using MODELLER ( Webb and Sali, 2016 122. Webb, B. ∙ Sali, A. Comparative Protein Structure Modeling Using MODELLER Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2016; 54 5.6.1.6.1-5.6.37.6.37 Crossref Scopus (1483) PubMed Google Scholar ). As the purpose of this simulation was to identify protein-protein interactions, we removed the glycan parts. The proteins were solvated in TIP3P water with 150 mM NaCl. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS 2020 ( Abraham et al., 2015 1. Abraham, M.J. ∙ Murtola, T. ∙ Schulz, R. ... GROMACS: High performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers SoftwareX. 2015; 1–2 :19-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) with the AMBER14SB force field ( Maier et al., 2015 64. Maier, J.A. ∙ Martinez, C. ∙ Kasavajhala, K. ... ff14SB: Improving the Accuracy of Protein Side Chain and Backbone Parameters from ff99SB J Chem Theory Comput. 2015; 11 :3696-3713 Crossref Scopus (5110) PubMed Google Scholar ). The system was first energy minimized and then equilibrated following a two steps procedure of constant temperature followed by constant pressure equilibrations ( Lemkul, 2019 55. Lemkul, J. From Proteins to Perturbed Hamiltonians: A Suite of Tutorials for the GROMACS-2018 Molecular Simulation Package [Article v1.0] Living J Comput Mol Sci. 2019; 1 :5068 Crossref Google Scholar ). The 500 ns of production were run at 310 K and 1 bar in an NPT ensemble, using the velocity-rescaling thermostat ( Bussi et al., 2007 14. Bussi, G. ∙ Donadio, D. ∙ Parrinello, M. Canonical sampling through velocity rescaling J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126 , 014101 Crossref Scopus (9287) PubMed Google Scholar ) coupled with the Parrinello–Rahman barostat ( Parrinello and Rahman, 1981 82. Parrinello, M. ∙ Rahman, A. Polymorphic transitions in single crystals: A new molecular dynamics method J. Appl. Phys. 1981; 52 :7182-7190 Crossref Scopus (11752) Google Scholar ). To focus only on residue side chains movements, we keep the proteins backbone constrained while side chains were allowed to move freely during the course of the simulation. We used MDAnalysis ( Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011 73. Michaud-Agrawal, N. ∙ Denning, E.J. ∙ Woolf, T.B. ... MDAnalysis: A toolkit for the analysis of molecular dynamics simulations J. Comput. Chem. 2011; 32 :2319-2327 Crossref Scopus (1380) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform hydrogen bond analysis as previously described ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Jupyter notebook used to perform such an analysis is available at: https://github.com/MChavent/Hbond-analysis . Briefly, we used a donor-acceptor distance cut-off of 3.0 Å and a cut-off angle of 120°. The hydrogen bond stability was defined as the percentage of the simulated time in which a residue forms stable hydrogen-bonds with its partner.
The models of membrane-bound GPC3 and Unc5D ( Figures S7 L and S7M) were produced using structures presented here, and Alpha-fold models of the hGPC3 C-terminal region and the rUnc5D TSP2 and transmembrane domains ( Jumper et al., 2021 52. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (5816) PubMed Google Scholar ; Varadi et al., 2022 113.

AlphaFold Protein Structure Database: massively expanding the structural coverage of protein-sequence space with high-accuracy models Nucleic Acids Res. 2022; 50 :D439-D444 Crossref Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar ). To position the Unc5D TSP2 domain, we ran 100 ns of atomistic simulations on the Alpha-fold model containing Ig2+TSP1+TSP2 (as described above) without constraints. While the Ig1 -TSP1 linkage was stable in these simulations, we observed that the TSP2 domain explored a range of positions relative to TSP1, possibly due to the presence of a proline residue in the linker between TSP1 and TSP2. We extracted 7 representative structures from the molecular dynamics trajectory, shown superposed in Figure S7 K. We used the Multi-Seq VMD plugin ( Roberts et al., 2006 89. Roberts, E. ∙ Eargle, J. ∙ Wright, D. ... MultiSeq: unifying sequence and structure data for evolutionary analysis BMC Bioinf. 2006; 7 :382 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ) and VMD ( Humphrey et al., 1996 45. Humphrey, W. ∙ Dalke, A. ∙ Schulten, K., Dalke A., Schulten K. VMD: Visual molecular dynamics J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (39018) PubMed Google Scholar ) to superimpose via the TSP1 domains for this figure. Missing linkers for Unc5D and GPC3 were added using MODELLER ( Webb and Sali, 2016 122. Webb, B. ∙ Sali, A. Comparative Protein Structure Modeling Using MODELLER Curr Protoc Bioinformatics. 2016; 54 5.6.1.6.1-5.6.37.6.37 Crossref Scopus (1483) PubMed Google Scholar ). We added heparan sulfate glycans and GPI anchors using the CHARMM-GUI glycan modeller ( Park et al., 2019 81. Park, S.-J. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Qi, Y. ... CHARMM-GUI Glycan Modeler for modeling and simulation of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates Glycobiology. 2019; 29 :320-331 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Equilibrium binding experiments were performed at 25°C using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) using PBS +0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 (pH 7.5) or 20mM Tris +200mM NaCl +0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20 (pH 7.5) as running buffers. Glypican, Unc5 or nanobody constructs were biotinylated enzymatically at a C-terminal Avi-Tag and coupled to a streptavidin-coated CM5 chip. Protein analytes were injected over the chip in 2-fold dilution series for 500 s, followed by at least 25 s dissociation time. The regeneration buffer used was 2 M MgCl 2 . Data were analyzed using the BI-Aevaluation software. Indicative K D and R max values were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting of a 1:1 Langmuir interaction model (bound = (R max x C)/(K D + C), where C is analyte concentration calculated as monomer.
HEK293T cells grown on coverslips were transfected using mVenus-tagged construct with 3 μg of DNA and 9 μL of PEI. Eighteen hours after transfections, cells were incubated with buffer (HBSS with 1% BSA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)) for 30 min on ice, and then with buffer containing 0.5 μg purified His-tagged protein per coverslip that was previously pre-clustered (20 min at room temperature) with anti-His (mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 1:2 (protein:antibody) ratio for 60 min on ice. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min, and then washed using PBS supplemented with 50 mM ammonium chloride. Cells were then incubated in the dark with anti-mouse-Cy3 in a 1:7.5 (protein:antibody) ratio in buffer for 60 min on ice. The cells were washed with PBS, stained with DAPI (0.1 μg/mL) and mounted using Immu-Mount. Imaging for data analysis was done with a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope. Analysis was performed in ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 94. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 2012 Crossref Scopus (30895) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schneider et al., 2012 95. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (35614) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the co-localisation tool. The co-localisation area of red pixels (soluble protein) with green pixels (cell-bound protein) was normalised against the area of cell-bound protein and converted into a percentage. For the statistical analysis we used a one-way ANOVA test, with a Tukey’s post-hoc test in Graphpad Prism (version 9 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, https://www.graphpad.com ). Significance was determined when p < 0.5.
Unliganded mGPC3 core and rUnc5D IgIgTSP were concentrated separately to 10 μM, dialyzed against 1M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.5) overnight at 4°C, and injected at 3 μM concentration. The mGPC3 core(R355A/R358A) - rUnc5D IgIgTSP complex was concentrated to 15 μM (assuming a 4:4 stoichiometry) and dialyzed against 200mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) and injected at 3.3 μM concentration. The protein samples were loaded into in-house prepared gold-coated capillary needles (Harvard Apparatus) and were injected directly to the mass spectrometer. The experiments were performed using a Q-Exactive UHMR Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Typically, 3 μL of protein solution was electrosprayed from gold-coated capillaries. The instrument parameters for MS are as follows: 1.2 kV capillary voltage, S-lens RF 200%, quadrupole selection from 1,500 to 20,000 m / z range, in-source trapping energy (0-20V), nitrogen UHV pressure of 6.07 × 10 −10 mbar and capillary temperature of 100 °C. The resolution of the instrument was 17,500 at m / z = 200 (transient time of 64 ms). The noise level was set at 3 rather than the default value of 4.64. For MS/MS analysis, collisional activation in the HCD cell was provided (0–300 V). Calibration of the instruments was performed using a 10 mg/mL solution of cesium iodide in water. Data were analyzed using the Xcalibur 4.1 (Thermo Scientific).
Tryptophan mannosylation was verified by LC-MS/MS. 5 μg of each protein (1 mg/mL) was diluted to a final volume of 100 μL in denaturing buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate). The sample was reduced with DTT (2 μL of 200 mM solution in denaturing buffer) at 56°C for 25 min, followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide (4 μL of 200 mM solution in denaturing buffer) at room temperature for 30 min. Alkylation was quenched by further addition of 2 μL of DTT solution. The samples were further diluted 3-folds using 50 mM Ammonium Acetate buffer. Trypsin was added to the sample in 1:50 (Enzyme: Protein (w/w)) ratio. The sample was incubated at 37°C for 16 h. Next day, the digested sample was divided into two fractions. One of the fraction was quenched using 10% Formic acid solution. To the other fraction, AspN was added in 1:20 (Enzyme: Protein (w/w)) ratio. The sample was incubated further at 37°C for 4 h after which it was quenched using 10% Formic acid solution. Resulting peptides were analyzed on an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher) connected to an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). The peptides were trapped on an guard column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75 μm × 2 cm, nano viper, C18, 3 μm, 100 Å, Thermo Fisher) using solvent A (0.1% Formic acid, water). The peptides were separated on an Acclaim PepMap analytical column (75 μm × 150 mm, RSLC C18, 3 μm, 100 Å) using a linear gradient (length: 90 min, 6%–45% solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 80% acetonitrile, 20% water), flow rate: 300 nL/min). The separated peptides were electrosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode using data-dependent acquisition with a 3 s cycle time. Precursors and products were detected in the Orbitrap analyzer at a resolving power of 60,000 and 30,000 (@ m / z 200), respectively. Precursor signals with an intensity >1.0 x 10 −4 and charge state between 2 and 7 were isolated with the quadrupole using a 0.7 m / z isolation window (0.5 m / z offset) and subjected to MS/MS fragmentation using higher-energy collision induced dissociation (30% relative fragmentation energy). MS/MS scans were collected at an AGC setting of 1.0 x 10 4 or a maximum fill time of 100 ms and precursors within 10 ppm were dynamically excluded for 30 s.
Raw data files were processed using MaxQuant software (Version 1.6.3.4), having in-built Andromeda search engine ( Cox and Mann, 2008 24. Cox, J. ∙ Mann, M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26 :1367-1372 Crossref Scopus (9262) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cox et al., 2011 25. Cox, J. ∙ Neuhauser, N. ∙ Michalski, A. ... Andromeda: A peptide search engine integrated into the MaxQuant environment J. Proteome Res. 2011; 10 :1794-1805 Crossref Scopus (3489) PubMed Google Scholar ). The peak lists were searched against individual Unc and common contaminant proteins. Carbamidomethylation was kept as fixed modification whereas acetylation (protein N-term), oxidation (methionine), and hexose (tryptophan) were used as variable modifications. Protein and peptide false discovery rate was kept at 1%. Trypsin and AspN were set as the protease and up to four missed cleavages were allowed.
Antibodies to hGPC3 core were raised in a llama by intra-muscular immunization with purified protein using Gerbu LQ#3000 as the adjuvant. Immunisations and handling of the llama were performed under the authority of the project license PA1FB163A (University of Reading, UK). Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and VHH complementary DNAs were generated by RT-PCR. The pool of VHH-encoding sequences was amplified by two rounds of nested PCR and cloned into the SfiI sites of the phagemid vector pADL-23c as previously described ( Huo et al., 2021 46. Huo, J. ∙ Mikolajek, H. ∙ le Bas, A. ... A potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralising nanobody shows therapeutic efficacy in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19 Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :5469 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Electrocompetent E. coli TG1 cells were transformed with the recombinant pADL-23c vector, and the resulting TG1 library stock was infected with M13K07 helper phage to obtain a library of VHH-presenting phages. Phages displaying VHHs specific for hGPC3 core were enriched via two rounds of bio-panning on biotinylated hGPC3 core , and individual phagemid clones were picked. VHH-displaying phages were recovered by infection with M13K07 helper phage and tested for binding to hGPC3 core by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Phage binders were ranked according to the ELISA signal and grouped by CDR3 sequence identity.
K562 suspension cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% L-Glutamine. The cells were harvested by a 3 min spin at 200g, washed with PBS, spinned again and resuspended in R buffer (Neon transfection system). Cells at a concentration of 2x10 7 cells/ml were transfected with control pCAGIG/gCAGIC plasmids, or those coding for Unc5 or GPC3 constructs using the Neon transfection system for electroporation (Settings: 1450V, 3 pulses, 10 ms). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested, passed through a 40 μm cell-strainer and used at a concentration of either 2 x 10 5 cells/ml or 4 x 10 5 cells/ml in aggregation media (Neurobasal-A media supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, 4% B-27 and 20 mM HEPES). For the competition experiments, different amounts of nanobodies (5, 10 and 50 μg) were added at this stage. Cells were then left to aggregate at 37°C, 5% CO 2 and 250 rpm for 90 min. After the incubation, cells were diluted in 2 mL of PBS and imaged in a 6-well plate using a Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope. Images presented were obtained using Inverted DeltaVision widefield microscope at 37°C. The total area of cells and the total area of the aggregates for each picture were calculated using the Analyze particle tool in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 94. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 2012 Crossref Scopus (30895) PubMed Google Scholar ). The threshold used to distinguish cells and aggregates was determined at 1284 μm 2 (>3/4 cells). For the statistical analysis we used a one-way ANOVA test, with a Tukey’s post-hoc test in GraphPad Prism (version 9 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, https://www.graphpad.com ). Significance was determined when p < 0.5.
For surface staining, K562 cells were harvested 24 h after electroporation and cooled to 4°C. The cells were then incubated with blocking buffer: HBSS with 1% BSA and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) for 30 min. For Unc5D expressing cells, cells were incubated with anti-HA (mouse; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody that was pre-clustered with secondary antibody-Cy5 for 40 min (ratio 1:7.5 for primary:secondary antibody). For GPC3 expressing cells, cells were incubated anti-FLAG (rabbit; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody that was pre-clustered with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 647 for 40 min (1:7.5 ratio). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA, DAPI-stained, washed and resuspended in 30% sucrose/PBS. Cells were then deposited onto microscope slides using a homemade cytospin ( Sisino et al., 2006 105. Sisino, G. ∙ Bellavia, D. ∙ Corallo, M. ... A homemade cytospin apparatus Anal. Biochem. 2006; 359 :283-284 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Imaging was performed using an Inverted DeltaVision widefield microscope with CCD. Colocalization for the surface quantification was performed using ImageJ/Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 94. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 2012 Crossref Scopus (30895) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schneider et al., 2012 95.

For the total amount of protein, K562 cells expressing the desired constructs were harvested 24 h after electroporation, lysed by sonication (2 pulses of 5 s), and analyzed on SDS-page/western blot with mouse anti-His, rabbit anti-FLAG, mouse anti-HA or mouse anti-Actin. For the statistical analysis we used a one-way ANOVA test, with a Tukey’s post-hoc test in GraphPad Prism (version 9 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA, https://www.graphpad.com ). Significance was determined when p < 0.5.
Whole cell extract was isolated using RIPA buffer (150mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCL pH7.35, 1% DOC, 1% NP40) supplemented with protein inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). The concentration of isolated proteins was determined using Bradford assays (Bio-Rad). Western Blot analysis was performed using the following primary antibodies: anti-GPC3 (1/1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Unc5D (1/1000, R&D systems), anti-g-tubulin (1/1000, Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-mouse IgG HRP (1/10,000, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-goat IgG HRP (1/10,000, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as secondary antibodies.
Single Cell RNASeq of human neuroblastoma tumor samples were exploited from Dong et al. (2020) 30. Dong, R. ∙ Yang, R. ∙ Zhan, Y. ... Single-Cell Characterization of Malignant Phenotypes and Developmental Trajectories of Adrenal Neuroblastoma Cancer Cell. 2020; 38 :716-733.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; GEO ID: GSE137804 ) public dataset. Raw sequencing data were processed following the partially published method details, explaining the different UMAP obtained in the present study. The R package Seurat (v4.0.1) was used to calculate the quality control metrics. To filter out low quality cells, we kept all cells with at least 200 detected genes and less than 10% of mitochondrial genes. Doublet cells were removed with the R package DoubletFinder (v2.0.3). To merge all samples without biasing the analysis with batch effects, while preserving the biological variation, we applied Seurat integration and re-computed a clustering based on the corrected matrix. Single RNAseq data for cortex samples were obtained from the published NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with accession numbers GSE65000 ( Florio et al., 2015 34. Florio, M. ∙ Albert, M. ∙ Taverna, E. ... Human-specific gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and neocortex expansion Science. 2015; 347 :1465-1470 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar )and GSE153164 ( di Bella et al., 2021 8. di Bella, D.J. ∙ Habibi, E. ∙ Stickels, R.R. ... Molecular logic of cellular diversification in the mouse cerebral cortex Nature. 2021; 595 :554-559 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used the same UMAP coordinates and metadata information with the cluster categorization provided by the authors.
Control siRNA (siRNA scr) (siRNA Universal Negative Control #1 SIC001) and human GPC3 siRNA (NM_004484; SASI_Hs01_00205845) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used at a concentration of 50 nM pCAGIG vectors encoding for nanobodies or Unc5D IgIgTSP constructs were used at a concentration of 2 μg/mL. For siRNA and plasmids transfection, cells were transfected with JetPrime according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (PolyPlus).

Chick embryos of interest were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Embryos were embedded in 7.5% gelatin and 15% sucrose in PBS to perform 20 μm transverse cryosections. Permeabilization and saturation of sections were performed in PBS with 3% BSA and 0.5% Triton. The following primary antibodies were applied to sections: anti-HNK1 mouse IgM (1/50, 3H5, DSHB), anti-GFP rabbit IgG (1/500, Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-mitochondria mouse IgG (1/500, Millipore) and the following secondary antibodies: Alexa 647 anti-mouse IgM (1/500, Thermo Fisher Scientific); Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG (1/500, Thermo Fisher Scientific), Alexa 555 anti-mouse IgG (1/500, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Slices were imaged with a confocal microscope (Olympus, FV1000, X81) using a 10× objective. The position of isolated cells and tumor masses was pointed on a reference image for each slice in which tumor cells could be detected, using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 94.

Transfected SY5Y cells were plated on the porous filter of the upper chamber of transwell culture dishes (8 μm pore size; BD Falcon, NJ, 5 x 10 4 cells/ml). The cells were then incubated for 60 h in a 37°C, 5% CO2-incubator. Cells retained on the upper face of the membrane were scrubbed using cotton swabs. The transwell culture dishes were then fixed with with 4% PFA for 30 min, before washing with 3 successive PBS-baths and mounting in Mowiol. Migrating cells were counted using a confocal microscope (Olympus, FV1000, X81).
We prepared the stripe assays essentially as previously described ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ...

50 μg/mL of Fc recombinant protein, GPC3 core or GPC3 coreUG , were mixed with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-hFc antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. Proteins were injected into matrices (90 μm width) (17,546,017) and placed on 60 mm dishes, resulting in red fluorescent stripes. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, dishes were washed with PBS and matrices removed. Dishes were coated with 50 μg/mL Fc or GPC3 coreUG protein mixed with 120 μg/mL anti-hFc (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min at 37°C and washed with PBS. Stripes were further coated with 20 μg/mL Laminin in PBS for at least 2 h and washed with PBS. Cortical neurons (E15.5) were cultured on the stripes in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Gibco). For testing the effects of nanobodies, neurons were cultured in medium containing 50 μg/mL streptavidin Alexa 594 (CN), Strep-Nano break or Strep-Nano glue . After 24 h neurons were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Neurons were washed and incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-beta-III tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) after 20 min permeabilization in 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cy2 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat#111-225-144) was used to visualize the tubulin signal. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before mounting. The numbers of beta-III-tubulin-positive (green) pixels on red or black stripes were quantified with ImageJ (version 1.53f) ( Schneider et al., 2012 95. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (35614) PubMed Google Scholar ) using a custom-made automatic macro that is available upon request.
For cell lines, 50 μg/mL of GPC3 core protein was mixed with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-hIgG antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS. Protein was injected into matrices (90 μm width) (17,546,017) and placed on 60 mm dishes, resulting in red fluorescent stripes. After 30 min incubation at 37°C, dishes were washed with PBS and matrices removed. Dishes were coated with 50 μg/mL GPC3 coreUG protein mixed with 120 μg/mL anti-hFc (Jackson) for 30 min at 37°C and washed with PBS. HeLa, SY5Y or N2A cells were cultured on the stripes in 2% FBS medium, with 50 μg/mL Strep-Nano break or Strep-Nano glue , or without nanobody (control). After 16 h cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before mounting and imaging. The number of DAPI positive pixels on red or black stripes was quantified.
Embryonic brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight. 10 μm Cryo-sections were pre-treated using the RNAscope Universal Pretreatment Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). RNA In Situ Hybridizations (ISH) were performed using the RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The target genes (Unc5D and GPC3) are listed in the Key resources table . Sections were immunostained using mouse anti-Pvim ⅓00 (Abcam), rat anti-Ctip2 1/600 (Abcam) or rabbit anti-Satb2 (Abcam) in combination with the Alexa Fluor 488-, 555-, and 647-conjugated mouse/rat/rabbit secondary antibodies (Abcam; 1/400). Both primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, PBS. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before mounting. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 20x, 40× objective and 2 Airy disk pinhole, and processed with ImageJ software.
In utero electroporation was performed at E13.5 with anesthetized C57BL/6 mice as previously described ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNA plasmids were used at 2 μg/μL and mixed with 1% fast green (Sigma-Aldrich, final concentration 0.2%). Plasmids were injected into the ventricle with a pump-controlled micropipette. After injection, six 50 ms electric pulses were generated with electrodes confronting the uterus above the ventricle. The abdominal wall and skin were sewed, and the mice were kept until E16.5 embryonic stage.
To knockdown GPC3 by shRNA in vivo , we used the best out of 3 different tested target regions embedded in the in the pCAG-miR30 vector, with the following sequence: GCCGAAGAAGGGAACTGATTC. This shRNA was validated in HEK293T cells, by co-transfection with GPC3 followed by western blotting. pCAGGS-mCherry ( Gurtan et al., 2012 39. Gurtan, A.M. ∙ Lu, V. ∙ Bhutkar, A. ... In vivo structure-function analysis of human Dicer reveals directional processing of precursor miRNAs RNA. 2012; 18 :1116-1122 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to visualise electroporated cells. Secreted versions of Unc5D extracellular domains (Unc5DIgIgTSP and Unc5DIgIgTSPGU) as well as the nanobodies (Nanoglue and Nanobreak) were cloned into the pCAGIG vector. The expression of all constructs was validated by expression in HEK293T cells and analyzed on western blots.
Pull-down experiments were performed as previously described ( del Toro et al., 2020 112. del Toro, D. ∙ Carrasquero-Ordaz, M.A. ∙ Chu, A. ... Structural Basis of Teneurin-Latrophilin Interaction in Repulsive Guidance of Migrating Neurons Cell. 2020; 180 :323-339.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fresh E15.5 mouse cortices were homogenized for 1 min at 4°C with an electric homogenizer using the following lysis buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich 04,693,132,001). Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. Supernatant was collected and protein was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Biorad, 5,000,001). 1.5 mg of protein at a final concentration of 2 μg/μL in lysis buffer (volume: 750 μL) was used for each pull-down. Control pull-down contained lysate and 40ul of high-capacity streptavidin agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 20,357, 50% w/v), whereas the nanobody condition contained the same beads plus 2μg of biotinylated Nano glue . Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C under rotatory agitation. The next day, agarose beads were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm and washed three times (first wash with 400 μL of lysis buffer, second wash with 1:1 (v/v) lysis buffer:PBS, last wash only PBS). Pulled-down samples were processed for mass spectrometry (MaxQuant run, Proteomic facility, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany). Volcano plots were generated using the DEP package in R-studio.
Pull-down experiments to investigate the effects of Nano glue and Nano break on the Unc5 – GPC3 interaction were performed by coupling biotinylated hGPC3 core to high-capacity streptavidin agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 20,357) after incubation of the beads with the biotinylated protein for 1 h hUnc5B Ecto was mixed with nanobody in 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 M ratios in 20mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 200mM NaCl, 1% BSA and incubated with hGPC3 core -coated strep beads for 3 h. Beads were washed with 20mM Tris-HCL, pH7.5, 200mM NaCl and the proteins were eluted with SDS-containing gel-loading buffer supplemented with 5% beta-mercaptoethanol. Samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE.
Nano glue and Nano break cloned into pCAGIG (Control) plasmids were electroporated at E13.5. After 3 days, embryonic brains were collected, fixed in 4% PFA overnight and vibratome cut into 75μm sections. Single cell morphology was reconstructed and analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.53) as described previously ( Namba et al., 2014 76. Namba, T. ∙ Kibe, Y. ∙ Funahashi, Y. ...

Regulation of Cerebral Cortex Folding by Controlling Neuronal Migration via FLRT Adhesion Molecules Cell. 2017; 169 :621-635.e16 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). For single cell morphology analysis in the lateral cortex was used after maximum projection of a z stack representing 50-60um (one image per 5um). Single cell morphology from GFP-expressing neurons was reconstructed and analyzed using ImageJ (version 1.49). 15–20 neurons per cortical layer (upper CP, lower CP and IZ) were quantified per section (2-3 sections per brain and three independent brains per condition).
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, employing a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test ( Figures 4 J, 5D, 6D, S4 J, and S7 E) or chi-square contingency analysis ( Figures 7 D, 7F, and 7H) when comparing two groups or multiple groups distribution, and one-way ANOVA test with Tukey’s post hoc analysis when comparing multiple groups ( Figures 3 B, 3F, 3H, 4 H, 4K, 6 B, 6F, S3 B, S3H, S4 H, S6 F, and S6H). p values represent ∗p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗p ≤ 0.001 and ∗∗∗∗p ≤ 0.0001. All data are presented as the mean ± SEM, whisker plots or dot plots. All sample sizes and definitions are provided in the figure legends.
