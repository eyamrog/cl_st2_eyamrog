Section: Abstract

Although mutations in mitochondrial-associated genes are linked to inflammation and susceptibility to infection, their mechanistic contributions to immune outcomes remain ill-defined. We discovered that the disease-associated gain-of-function allele Lrrk2 G2019S (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) perturbs mitochondrial homeostasis and reprograms cell death pathways in macrophages. When the inflammasome is activated in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages, elevated mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) directs association of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) to mitochondrial membranes. Mitochondrial GSDMD pore formation then releases mtROS, promoting a switch to RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis. Consistent with enhanced necroptosis, infection of Lrrk2 G2019S mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis elicits hyperinflammation and severe immunopathology. Our findings suggest a pivotal role for GSDMD as an executer of multiple cell death pathways and demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction can direct immune outcomes via cell death modality switching. This work provides insights into how LRRK2 mutations manifest or exacerbate human diseases and identifies GSDMD-dependent necroptosis as a potential target to limit Lrrk2 G2019S -mediated immunopathology.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Despite a growing appreciation for mitochondria as critical regulators of antimicrobial defenses and cell death ( Riley and Tait, 2020; West and Shadel, 2017 61. Riley, J.S. ∙ Tait, S.W. Mitochondrial DNA in inflammation and immunity EMBO Rep. 2020; 21 , e49799 Crossref Scopus (454) PubMed Google Scholar 84. West, A.P. ∙ Shadel, G.S. Mitochondrial DNA in innate immune responses and inflammatory pathology Nat Rev Immunol. 2017; 17 :363-375 Crossref Scopus (666) PubMed Google Scholar ), we still know very little about how mitochondrial perturbations drive protective or pathogenic immune responses in the context of actual human disease. Mutations in mitochondrial-related genes involved in processes ranging from mitophagy (PARK2, PARL, and PINK1) to fission and fusion of the mitochondrial network (OPA1 and MFN2) have been repeatedly linked to chronic inflammation and susceptibility to infection with pathogens like Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which cause leprosy and tuberculosis, respectively ( Patrick and Watson, 2021 57. Patrick, K.L. ∙ Watson, R.O. Mitochondria: powering the innate immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection Infect. Immun. 2021; 89 e00687–e00620 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). One notable mitochondrial-associated gene with poorly understood connections to inflammation and immunity is leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2 is a multiple domain-containing protein that functions both as a GTPase and a kinase ( Anand and Braithwaite, 2009 3. Anand, V.S. ∙ Braithwaite, S.P.

Function and dysfunction of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2): Parkinson's disease and beyond BMB Rep. 2015; 48 :243-248 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because mutations in LRRK2 constitute the greatest known genetic component of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) ( Goldwurm et al., 2005 20. Goldwurm, S. ∙ Di Fonzo, A. ∙ Simons, E.J. ...

In non-CNS cells, LRRK2 has been linked to intracellular membrane trafficking through RAB phosphorylation ( Steger et al., 2016 73. Steger, M. ∙ Tonelli, F. ∙ Ito, G. ...

We do not fully understand why mutations in LRRK2 upset the immune milieu to trigger inflammatory disorders like Crohn’s disease ( Derkinderen and Neunlist, 2018 12. Derkinderen, P. ∙ Neunlist, M.

Our recent study of LRRK2 knockout macrophages suggested that LRRK2 controls innate immunity via maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis ( Weindel et al., 2020 83. Weindel, C.G. ∙ Bell, S.L. ∙ Vail, K.J. ... LRRK2 maintains mitochondrial homeostasis and regulates innate immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis eLife. 2020; 9 :e51071 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). Motivated by these findings, we looked to the gain-of-function LRRK2 G2019S allele as a model to elucidate how mitochondrial mutations impact innate immune and infection outcomes. The LRRK2 G2019S mutation is surprisingly prevalent in humans. In Ashkenazi Jews and North Africans, the allele accounts for a significant proportion of PD ( Khan et al., 2005 33. Khan, N.L. ∙ Jain, S. ∙ Lynch, J.M. ... Mutations in the gene LRRK2 encoding dardarin (PARK8) cause familial Parkinson's disease: clinical, pathological, olfactory and functional imaging and genetic data Brain. 2005; 128 :2786-2796 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ozelius et al., 2006 56.

Med. 2006; 354 :424-425 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). LRRK2 G2019S is also associated with overall increased risk of certain cancers ( Agalliu et al., 2015 1. Agalliu, I. ∙ San Luciano, M. ∙ Mirelman, A. ... Higher frequency of certain cancers in LRRK2 G2019S mutation carriers with Parkinson disease: a pooled analysis JAMA Neurol. 2015; 72 :58-65 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), and there is growing interest in how this allele influences infection and inflammation ( Herbst and Gutierrez, 2019 25. Herbst, S. ∙ Gutierrez, M.G. LRRK2 in Infection: friend or foe? ACS Infect. Dis. 2019; 5 :809-815 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shutinoski et al., 2019 71.

Med. 2019; 11 :eaas9292 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, in studies of mice and flies, we describe an ancient connection between LRRK2’s role in mitochondrial homeostasis and immunity and report that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) renders Lrrk2 G2019S mitochondria susceptible to gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore formation that leads to necroptotic cell death.

Immunofluorescence (IF) confocal microscopy revealed increased mitochondrial fragmentation in Lrrk2 G2019S cells compared with WT ( Figure 1 A).

To quantitatively measure mitochondrial fragmentation in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, we developed a strategy to measure mitochondrial size differences down to the sub-micron level via flow cytometry. Polystyrene beads of 1, 2, and 4 μm were used to create a gating strategy, whereby the size of MitoTracker green (MTG)-stained mitochondria could be compared with the size of bead standards using the forward scatter (FSC) optical detector ( MacDonald et al., 2019 46.

Single organelle analysis to characterize mitochondrial function and crosstalk during viral infection Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :8492 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 C, S1 A, and S1B). Consistent with DRP1 hyperactivation, we measured more “small” mitochondria (<1 μm) and fewer “large” mitochondria (>4 μm) in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs compared with WT ( Figure 1 D). Importantly, treatment with low concentrations of the DRP1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 (10 μM) significantly reduced mitochondrial fragmentation in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages ( Figures 1 C and 1D), without impacting total mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ( Figure S1 C), supporting a role for pDRP1 in promoting mitochondrial hyper-fission in these cells.
Because mitochondrial fragmentation can alter membrane potential ( Liesa and Shirihai, 2013 37. Liesa, M. ∙ Shirihai, O.S. Mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of nutrient utilization and energy expenditure Cell Metab. 2013; 17 :491-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (981) PubMed Google Scholar ), we measured mitochondrial membrane depolarization in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages using two cell-permeant dyes: tetramethylrhodamine (TMRE), which is sequestered in healthy, negatively charged mitochondria, and JC-1, which exists as red aggregates in healthy mitochondria and green cytosolic monomers that increase as mitochondrial membrane potential is lost. TMRE fluorescence intensity and JC-1 aggregates were both decreased in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, indicating mitochondrial membrane depolarization ( Figures 1 E and 1F). JC-1 aggregates were further reduced in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages following treatment with the complex I inhibitor, rotenone + ATP ( Figure 1 G).
The mouse genotype used for the majority of our studies is B6.Cg-Tg(Lrrk2 ∗ G2019S)2Yue/J, which overexpresses Lrrk2 G2019S on a BAC ( Li et al., 2007 36. Li, X. ∙ Tan, Y.C. ∙ Poulose, S. ... Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/PARK8 possesses GTPase activity that is altered in familial Parkinson’s disease R1441C/G mutants J. Neurochem. 2007; 103 :238-247 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an important control, we measured no differences in TMRE in BMDMs isolated from B6.Cg-Tg(Lrrk2)6Yue/J mice, which overexpress WT LRRK2 on a BAC, and matched B6 controls ( Figure S1 D). We also measured mitochondrial membrane potential in BMDMs isolated from B6.Cg- Lrrk2 tm1.1Hlme /J mice (a.k.a. Lrrk2 G>S/+ ), in which the G2019S mutation has been engineered into the LRRK2 genomic locus. We detected a subtle but statistically significant decrease in TMRE in Lrrk2 G>S/+ BMDMs ( Figures S1 E and S1F). These data argue that the G2019S mutation and not LRRK2 protein abundance is the main driver of mitochondrial depolarization in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages.
Several labs have successfully used LRRK2 G2019S -expressing flies as a model to study LRRK2 function ( Cording et al., 2017 11. Cording, A.C. ∙ Shiaelis, N. ∙ Petridi, S. ...

Neurosci. 2009; 29 :11257-11262 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether expression of hLRRK2 influences mitochondrial homeostasis in an evolutionarily conserved fashion, we generated transgenic flies that express hLRRK2 alleles in the fat body, a tissue that controls energy metabolism and plays a major role in innate immunity in insects ( Anand et al., 2012 2. Anand, P. ∙ Cermelli, S. ∙ Li, Z. ...

Mammalian lipid droplets are innate immune hubs integrating cell metabolism and host defense Science. 2020; 370 eaay8085 Crossref Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ). Visualizing lipid droplets (Nile red) and mitochondria (anti-ATP5A) in flies expressing hLRRK2, hLRRK2-G2019S, and hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M (a kinase dead allele; Lin et al., 2010 39. Lin, C.H. ∙ Tsai, P.I. ∙ Wu, R.M. ... LRRK2 G2019S mutation induces dendrite degeneration through mislocalization and phosphorylation of tau by recruiting autoactivated GSK3ss J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :13138-13149 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), we discovered that mitochondrial network density was decreased by the hLRRK2 and hLRRK2-G2019S alleles but unaltered in the fat body of flies expressing the kinase dead allele ( Figure 1 H; green). Lipid droplets, which store triacylglycerols and serve as a fuel source for mitochondrial OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation), were larger in hLRRK2 and hLRRK2-G2019S flies compared with those expressing hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M or controls ( Figure 1 H; red). Flies expressing hLRRK2 alleles via a ubiquitous promoter displayed similar phenotypes ( Figure S3 I, mock). These findings suggest that Lrrk2 G2019S alters mitochondrial homeostasis and energetics in macrophages ex vivo and at an organismal level, in evolutionarily distant animals.
Based on our previous work ( Weindel et al., 2020 83. Weindel, C.G. ∙ Bell, S.L. ∙ Vail, K.J. ... LRRK2 maintains mitochondrial homeostasis and regulates innate immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis eLife. 2020; 9 :e51071 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that fragmented, depolarized mitochondria could impact basal levels of inflammatory mediators in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages ( Figure 2 A). However, we measured no differences in expression of Ifnb1 transcripts, IFN-β protein, or interferon stimulated gene (ISG) transcripts in WT versus Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs at rest ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Protein levels of key IFN signaling molecules were also comparable between the two genotypes ( Figures S2 A and S2B), as were levels of Ifnb1 and ISG expression when cells were treated with a panel of innate agonists ( Figures S2 C and S2D) or infected with Mtb, an intracellular bacterial pathogen that activates IRF3 via cGAS-dependent cytosolic DNA sensing (4 h) ( Figure S2 E; Collins et al., 2015 9. Collins, A.C. ∙ Cai, H. ∙ Li, T. ...

Wassermann, R. ∙ Gulen, M.F. ∙ Sala, C. ...

The cytosolic sensor cGAS detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA to induce Type I interferons and activate autophagy Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17 :811-819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other pro-inflammatory cytokines were similarly expressed in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages at 4 h post-Mtb infection ( Figure S2 F). We concluded that Lrrk2 G2019S does not promote chronic engagement of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors nor does it significantly alter the ability of BMDMs to activate inflammatory gene expression following innate immune stimuli.
Mitochondrial instability is also a well-known trigger of several regulated cell death pathways ( Figure 2 A; Tait and Green, 2013 75. Tait, S.W. ∙ Green, D.R. Mitochondrial regulation of cell death Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a008706 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs are prone to regulated cell death, we infected WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs with Mtb (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 5) and measured propidium iodide (PI) incorporation over time. Over a 48 h Mtb infection, a higher percentage of Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs were PI+ compared with WT controls ( Figure 2 D). This cell death was MOI-dependent ( Figure S2 H) and concomitant with uptake of Mtb bacilli ( Figures S2 I and S2J). Since we did not observe significant differences in Mtb colony-forming units (CFUs) in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs ( Figure S2 G), we do not believe that enhanced cell death is due to differences in bacterial replication.
Several cell death modalities are simultaneously engaged during Mtb infection of macrophages, including apoptosis, pyroptosis (via the NLRP3 [ Dorhoi et al., 2012 15. Dorhoi, A. ∙ Nouailles, G. ∙ Jörg, S. ... Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is uncoupled from susceptibility to active tuberculosis Eur. J.

Roca, F.J. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L.

TNF induces pathogenic programmed macrophage necrosis in tuberculosis through a mitochondrial-lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum circuit Cell. 2019; 178 :1344-1361.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). To pinpoint the type of cell death that Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs are prone to, we treated cells with agonists to stimulate specific cell death modalities. Apoptosis triggers like etoposide, and ABT737 did not elicit more cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S cells; if anything, fewer Lrrk2 G2019S cells were PI+ after these treatments ( Figures S2 K and S2L). However, cell death was notably enhanced in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs post-stimulation of the AIM2 inflammasome via either LPS or Pam3CSK4 priming (3 h), followed by transfection with the synthetic dsDNA sequence poly dA:dT ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 M). Direct stimulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome recapitulated this phenotype ( Figures 2 G and S2 N). In response to nigericin, maximal cell death occurred rapidly, creating a narrow window in which to capture Lrrk2 G2019S -dependent cell death enhancement. To stimulate the NLRP3 inflammasome in a more biologically relevant fashion, we infected WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs with the intracellular bacterial pathogens Mycobacterium marinum (MOI 5) and Listeria monocytogenes (MOI 2) and again observed higher % cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Engagement of the NLRC4 inflammasome during Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection also caused significantly higher cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs in a SPI-1-dependent fashion ( Figure 2 J). Cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs triggered by LPS/polydA:dT or Mtb infection was caspase dependent ( Figure 2 K) and, in the case of Mtb infection, could be rescued by treating cells with the NLRP3 inhibitor dapansutrile ( Figure 2 L). We measured no significant increase in inflammasome-mediated cell death in BMDMs overexpressing WT LRRK2 ( Figures 2 M and S2 O), but Lrrk2 G>S/+ knockin (KI) BMDMs were exquisitely sensitive to multiple cell death triggers ( Figures 2 N–2Q and S2 P). Importantly, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity with the highly potent and selective inhibitor GNE-9605 rescued cell death in the Lrrk2 G2019S Tg BMDMs ( Figure 2 R). These data argue that activation of the AIM2, NLRP3, or NLRC4 inflammasomes is necessary and sufficient to elicit enhanced cell death of Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs and strongly implicate Lrrk2 G2019S kinase activity in this cell death.
As another canonical readout of AIM2 inflammasome activation, we measured IL-1β release in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs. Despite exhibiting enhanced caspase-1-dependent cell death following inflammasome activation ( Figure 2 K), Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs release markedly less IL-1β post-AIM2 stimulation and at 24 h post-Mtb infection ( Figure 2 S). To begin to explain the reduced IL-1β release in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, we tested if upregulation of inflammasome components was reduced. We measured no significant differences in expression of pyroptotic cell death mediators ( Figure S2 Q) or inflammasome associated cytokines ( Il18 and Il1b ; Figure S2 R) in resting WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs. Pro-IL-1β protein levels and ASC speck formation were also comparable ( Figures 2 T and S2 S). Therefore, although inflammasome activation triggers enhanced cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, this death is not concomitant with enhanced release of pyroptotic inflammatory mediators, suggesting that Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs die via an alternative cell death modality.
We hypothesized that underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs ( Figure 1 ) reprograms cell death signaling downstream of inflammasome activation to cause non-pyroptotic cell death. To define how mitochondrial homeostasis is altered by inflammasome activation in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential at 2 h post-LPS/poly dA:dT treatment by flow cytometry. Resting Lrrk2 G2019S and Lrrk2 G>S/+ BMDMs showed reduced TMRE fluorescence intensity that was further reduced by LPS/poly dA:dT treatment ( Figures 3 A and S3 A), indicative of AIM2-dependent mitochondrial depolarization. AIM2-mediated depolarization was accompanied by accumulation of mtDNA in the cytosol of Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages ( Figures 3 B and 3C). Consistent with enhanced cytosolic mtDNA release, levels of type I IFN transcripts were higher in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages at 4–5 h post-AIM2 activation ( Figures 3 D and S3 B) and at 24 h post-Mtb infection ( Figure 3 E). Another mitochondrial damage-associated molecular pattern (mtDAMP) with connections to both inflammasome activation and cell death is mtROS. To define the repertoire of free radicals in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs during AIM2 inflammasome activation, we used the fluorogenic probe cellROX and the mitochondrial-targeted superoxide indicator mitoSOX. Signal from both probes was significantly higher in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages at 2 h post-LPS/poly dA:dT treatment ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Because genes in the oxidative stress-responsive NRF2 regulon were not differentially expressed in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs ( Li and Kong, 2009 35. Li, W. ∙ Kong, A.N. Molecular mechanisms of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response Mol. Carcinog. 2009; 48 :91-104 Crossref Scopus (668) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 C), we hypothesized that mitochondrial defects were responsible for increased mtROS production in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs.
To test whether altered mitochondrial respiration could contribute to mtROS accumulation in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, we assayed their oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Although basal metabolic capacity was similar between WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, spare capacity and maximal respiration were elevated in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs during macrophage activation, both in the context of LPS treatment alone ( Figures S3 D and S3E) and following LPS/polydA:dT treatment ( Figures 3 H and 3I). This suggests that Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs fail to undergo the well-characterized “Warburg shift” ( Kelly and O'Neill, 2015 32. Kelly, B. ∙ O'Neill, L.A. Metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells in innate immunity Cell Res. 2015; 25 :771-784 Crossref Scopus (1152) PubMed Google Scholar ) and instead continue to rely on OXPHOS following macrophage activation. OCR defects were evident only during initial macrophage metabolic reprogramming; WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs treated with LPS for 24 h underwent the OXPHOS-to-glycolysis transition normally ( Figure S3 F). No differences in glycolytic capacity (ECAR) between WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs were observed in response to any stimulus ( Figures S3 G and S3H). We propose that the failure of Lrrk2 G2019S mitochondria to metabolically reprogram from OXPHOS to glycolysis places additional demands on the electron transport chains of fragmented mitochondria and contributes to elevated ROS levels ( Figures 3 F and 3G).
We next asked whether mitochondria similarly fail to respond to immune stimuli in hLRRK2-G2019S-expressing flies. Flies were orally infected with the bacterial entomopathogen strain Pseudomonas entomophila ( P.e .) alongside mock-infected controls. After 20 h of infection, we visualized mitochondria and lipid droplets in the fat body as in Figure 1 H. An expected increase in mitochondrial density, demonstrative of the increased demand for energy output upon infection ( Zhao and Karpac, 2021 89. Zhao, X. ∙ Karpac, J. Glutamate metabolism directs energetic trade-offs to shape host-pathogen susceptibility in Drosophila Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :2428-2444.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), was evident in WT and hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M-expressing Drosophila , but little to no change was observed in the density of the mitochondrial network in hLRRK2- and hLRRK2-G2019S-expressing flies ( Figures 3 J, 3K, S3 I, and S3J). Likewise, lipid droplet size and number qualitatively decreased in response to P.e. infection in WT and hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M flies but remained unchanged in flies expressing hLRRK2 and hLRRK2-G2019S. We also measured significantly higher numbers of lipid droplets in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages during Mtb infection ( Figure 3 L), suggesting that LRRK2’s role in regulating cellular energy homeostasis during bacterial infection is evolutionarily conserved.
To link defects in mitochondrial homeostasis with Lrrk2 G2019S cell death, we measured PI incorporation after AIM2 activation in cells treated with the nucleoside analog 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (ddC) for 5 days to deplete mitochondria/mtDNA ( Figure 3 M). Although mtDNA depletion was sufficient to rescue inflammasome-mediated cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, it did not significantly impact PI incorporation in WT cells ( Figure 3 N). This argues that mitochondrial metabolism and/or mtDNA release uniquely contributes to inflammasome-triggered cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages.
We next sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for uncoupling caspase-1-dependent inflammasome-triggered cell death and IL-1β release in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages. In addition to promoting cleavage of pro-IL-1β upon inflammasome activation, caspase-1 also cleaves GSDMD to form N-GSDMD ( He et al., 2015 23. He, W.T. ∙ Wan, H. ∙ Hu, L. ... Gasdermin D is an executor of pyroptosis and required for interleukin-1beta secretion Cell Res. 2015; 25 :1285-1298 Crossref Scopus (1676) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2015 69.

Cleavage of GSDMD by inflammatory caspases determines pyroptotic cell death Nature. 2015; 526 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (4209) PubMed Google Scholar ), which oligomerizes to form pores that translocate IL-1β out of the cell and cause pyroptosis ( Ding et al., 2016 14. Ding, J. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Liu, W. ... Pore-forming activity and structural autoinhibition of the gasdermin family Nature. 2016; 535 :111-116 Crossref Scopus (1825) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mulvihill et al., 2018 52. Mulvihill, E. ∙ Sborgi, L. ∙ Mari, S.A. ... Mechanism of membrane pore formation by human gasdermin-D EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e98321 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Orning et al., 2019 55. Orning, P. ∙ Lien, E. ∙ Fitzgerald, K.A. Gasdermins and their role in immunity and inflammation J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :2453-2465 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if GSDMD contributes to Lrrk2 G2019S -dependent cell death, we measured PI incorporation after AIM2 stimulation in the presence of two inhibitors of GSDMD pore formation: disulfiram and necrosulfamide. Both were sufficient to return PI incorporation in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages to WT levels ( Figures 4 A and 4B), as was siRNA knockdown of GSDMD ( Figures 4 C and S4 A). A simple explanation for GSDMD driving Lrrk2 G2019S -dependent cell death is that N-GSDMD forms more pores in the plasma membrane of Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, leading to more pyroptosis. However, if this were the case, one would expect more IL-1β release, which we did not observe ( Figure 2 S). Therefore, we hypothesized that GSDMD contributes to Lrrk2 G2019S -dependent cell death via an alternative mechanism. Recent studies demonstrate that gasdermins can traffic to the mitochondria during NLRP3 inflammasome activation to enhance inflammasome activity via GSDMD-mediated mitochondrial stress and mtDAMP release ( Rogers et al., 2019 64. Rogers, C. ∙ Erkes, D.A. ∙ Nardone, A. ... Gasdermin pores permeabilize mitochondria to augment caspase-3 activation during apoptosis and inflammasome activation Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1689 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if GSDMD’s interaction with the mitochondrial network is altered in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, we used IF microscopy to assess GSDMD colocalization (red, anti-GSDMD) with mitochondria (green, anti-TOM20) after AIM2 activation. Significant accumulation of GSDMD at the mitochondria following AIM2 stimulation was seen in both WT and Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs, with higher levels on Lrrk2 G2019S mitochondria via microscopy ( Figures 4 D and S4 B) and biochemical cellular fractionation ( Figures 4 E and S4 C). Having linked lower mitochondrial membrane potential and excessive mtROS production to cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs ( Figures 3 A and 3G), we asked if GSDMD contributed to these defects by treating cells with the GSDMD inhibitor disulfiram during AIM2 activation. Remarkably, disulfiram treatment was sufficient to return both Lrrk2 G2019S BMDM mitochondrial membrane potential ( Figures 4 F and 4G) and cellular ROS ( Figure 4 H) to WT levels. These data indicate that AIM2 stimulation triggers N-GSDMD mitochondrial association, leading to membrane depolarization and ROS accumulation, and that this occurs preferentially in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages.
We next investigated the extent to which inflammasome-triggered N-GSDMD mitochondrial association occurs in WT macrophages. Using flow cytometry, we measured GSDMD mitochondrial association by co-staining isolated mitochondria with MitoTracker and anti-GSDMD antibodies after AIM2 activation. We detected an increase in GSDMD association with mitochondria 2 h after AIM2 activation, which was dependent on GSDMD’s ability to form pores ( Figure 5 A). We also observed GSDMD-dependent mitochondrial membrane depolarization in WT BMDMs following AIM2 stimulation ( Figure 5 B), although notably, with slower kinetics than previously observed in Lrrk2 G2019S cells (4 versus 2 h). To directly address the capacity of N-GSDMD to damage mitochondria, we created a minimal in vitro system. Briefly, N-GSDMD was generated by combining recombinantly expressed full-length GSDMD with the catalytically active mouse CASP11 (residues 100–373, wtCASP11) or a catalytically dead form of the same protein (C254A; mutCASP11) ( Figures 5 C and S5 A). Only wtCASP11 was capable of cleaving GSDMD, and it cleaved similar amounts of GSDMD in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S mitochondrial preparations ( Figures 5 D and S5 B). Incubation of mitochondria isolated from WT BMDMs with GSDMD/wtCASP11 depolarized 81.6% of mitochondria in 1 h ( Figure 5 E). Comparing WT and Lrrk2 G2019S depolarization under similar conditions (30-min incubation), we measured 48.3% depolarization in mitochondrial isolated from Lrrk2 G2019S samples versus 30.8% in WT mitochondria ( Figure 5 F). These data demonstrate that N-GSDMD is necessary and sufficient to depolarize mitochondrial membranes upon inflammasome activation. To begin to define what makes Lrrk2 G2019S mitochondria susceptible to GSDMD association and pore formation, we treated WT BMDMs with menadione, which generates mtROS via redox cycling ( Loor et al., 2010 43. Loor, G. ∙ Kondapalli, J. ∙ Schriewer, J.M. ... Menadione triggers cell death through ROS-dependent mechanisms involving PARP activation without requiring apoptosis Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2010; 49 :1925-1936 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tao et al., 2020 76. Tao, L. ∙ Lemoff, A. ∙ Wang, G. ... Reactive oxygen species oxidize STING and suppress interferon production eLife. 2020; 9 :e57837 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment of WT macrophages with menadione (25 μM) was sufficient to generate ROS ( Figure S5 C) and promote N-GSDMD association with mitochondria via biochemical fractionation ( Figures 5 G and S5 D) and flow cytometric analysis of GSDMD+ isolated mitochondria ( Figure 5 H). These findings suggest that mtROS is the main driver of GSDMD mitochondrial association after inflammasome activation in macrophages.
Collectively, our data suggest that Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages die via activation of a non-pyroptotic cell death pathway, driven by mtROS-dependent N-GSDMD pore formation in the mitochondrial network. mtROS has been previously implicated in necroptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death in which RHIM domain-containing proteins RIPK1/RIPK3 activate the pore-forming protein MLKL downstream of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic stimuli ( Figure 6 A; Fulda, 2016 19. Fulda, S. Regulation of necroptosis signaling and cell death by reactive oxygen species Biol. Chem. 2016; 397 :657-660 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shindo et al., 2013 70. Shindo, R. ∙ Kakehashi, H. ∙ Okumura, K. ... Critical contribution of oxidative stress to TNFalpha-induced necroptosis downstream of RIPK1 activation Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 436 :212-216 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2020 88. Zhang, X. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Liu, Q. ... mtDNA-STING pathway promotes necroptosis-dependent enterocyte injury in intestinal ischemia reperfusion Cell Death Dis. 2020; 11 :1050 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we set out to determine whether Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs die via necroptosis following inflammasome activation. pMLKL accumulated in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages after AIM2 stimulation ( Figure 6 B) and during Mtb infection ( Figure 6 C), and MLKL, RIPK1, and RIPK3 were each necessary to enhance cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages following AIM2 stimulation ( Figures 6 D–6F, S6 A, and S6B). This was not due to differences in necroptotic protein expression between WT and Lrrk2 G2019S cells ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Lrrk2 G2019S cell death was independent of caspase-8 and did not exhibit hallmarks of apoptosis ( Figures S6 E and S6F), arguing against involvement of the newly described PANoptosome ( Samir et al., 2020 66. Samir, P. ∙ Malireddi, R.K.S. ∙ Kanneganti, T.D. The PANoptosome: a deadly protein complex driving pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (panoptosis) Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2020; 10 :238 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although siRNA knockdown of the necroptosis adapter ZBP1 significantly enhanced cell death in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages ( Figure 6 G), this death could be rescued by RIPK3 inhibition ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Knocking down the TLR4 adapter TRIF ( Meylan et al., 2004 50. Meylan, E. ∙ Burns, K. ∙ Hofmann, K. ... RIP1 is an essential mediator of toll-like receptor 3-induced NF-kappa B activation Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 :503-507 Crossref Scopus (690) PubMed Google Scholar ) resulted in a similar phenotype ( Figures 6 H and S6 I). These data suggest that adapters like ZBP1 and TRIF do not directly promote Lrrk2 G2019S cell death but do likely regulate the pools of available necroptosis mediators like RIPK3.
Previous studies have shown that activated RIPK3 promotes aerobic respiration, leading to ROS production through pyruvate dehydrogenase activation ( Yang et al., 2018 85. Yang, Z. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... RIP3 targets pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to increase aerobic respiration in TNF-induced necroptosis Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :186-197 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test how RIPK3 activation contributes to mtROS following inflammasome activation, we measured cellROX after AIM2 stimulation in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S cells with and without GSK872 treatment. Although inhibiting RIPK3 was sufficient to return ROS levels in Lrrk2 G2019S cells to those of WT ( Figure 6 I), this rescue was incomplete, likely due to GSDMD-mediated damage sustained by the mitochondria following AIM2 stimulation. Importantly, treatment with the mtROS scavenger/necroptosis inhibitor Necrox-5 completely rescued Lrrk2 G2019S cell death following AIM2 stimulation ( Figure 6 J) and treatment of WT BMDMs with menadione induced cell death following AIM2 stimulation in a RIPK3-dependent fashion ( Figure 6 K). Finally, RIPK3 inhibition restored IL-1β release in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs to that of WT cells following AIM2 activation ( Figure 6 L). This suggests that IL-1β release is disrupted in Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs via competition between necroptotic cell death (pMLKL pore formation = no IL-1β release) and pyroptotic cell death (GSDMD pore formation = IL-1β release). Together, our data argue that mtROS is the main driver of a pyroptosis-to-necroptosis shift in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages and provide evidence for a RIPK3-mediated feedforward loop that enhances mtROS production and cell death.
Having measured a defect in the ability of hLRRK2-G2019S-expressing D. melanogaster to upregulate mitochondrial dynamics during infection with P.e . ( Figures 3 J and 3K), we asked whether flies exhibit increased susceptibility to pathogen challenge. Briefly, flies were orally infected with P.e . for 20 h, and survival was monitored for 10–11 days ( Figure 7 A). Fat body expression of both hLRRK2 and hLRRK2-G2019S (CGGal4>) or ubiquitous expression of hLRRK2-G2019S (DaGal4>) correlated with decreased fly survival, whereas hLRRK2-K1906M expression provided protection ( Figure 7 B). These phenotypes correlated with bacterial burdens at 20 h post-infection ( Figure S7 A). Additionally, inflammatory gene expression ( Drs , Atta , and Dipt ), which we have linked to P.e . susceptibility ( Zhao and Karpac, 2021 89. Zhao, X. ∙ Karpac, J. Glutamate metabolism directs energetic trade-offs to shape host-pathogen susceptibility in Drosophila Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :2428-2444.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), was higher in hLRRK2-G2019S flies ( Figures 7 C and S7 B), suggesting that LRRK2 expression and kinase activity correlate with hyperinflammation and hypersusceptibility to bacterial infection in Drosophila .
To further translate our findings to models of human disease, we asked whether Lrrk2 G2019S mice have altered circulating immune cell populations. Building on earlier work ( Li et al., 2007 36. Li, X. ∙ Tan, Y.C. ∙ Poulose, S. ... Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/PARK8 possesses GTPase activity that is altered in familial Parkinson’s disease R1441C/G mutants J. Neurochem. 2007; 103 :238-247 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Moehle et al., 2015 51. Moehle, M.S. ∙ Daher, J.P. ∙ Hull, T.D. ... The G2019S LRRK2 mutation increases myeloid cell chemotactic responses and enhances LRRK2 binding to actin-regulatory proteins Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24 :4250-4267 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), we measured populations of immune cells in blood isolated from WT and Lrrk2 G2019S mice by flow cytometry. We found that although Lrrk2 G2019S and WT mice have similar numbers of circulating immune cells ( Figures S7 C, S7E, and S7F), certain Lrrk2 G2019S myeloid populations modestly upregulate inflammatory mediators like TNF-α in response to TLR stimulation ( Figures 7 D and S7 D).
Cell death modality usage is a key determinant of Mtb infection outcomes, with apoptotic macrophage cell death generally being anti-bacterial and necrosis being pro-bacterial ( Srinivasan et al., 2014 72. Srinivasan, L. ∙ Ahlbrand, S. ∙ Briken, V. Interaction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with host cell death pathways Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4 :a022459 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test our prediction that Lrrk2 G2019S mice would exhibit exacerbated pathogenesis in response to Mtb infection, we used a low dose aerosol infection model to administer approximately 100 Mtb bacilli per mouse to a cohort of littermate age-matched male and female WT and Lrrk2 G2019S mice, sacrificing mice at days 21 and 77 ( Figure 7 E). Bacterial burdens were dramatically higher in the lungs and spleens of Lrrk2 G2019S mice at day 77, with a moderate but significant increase seen in Lrrk2 G2019S lungs as early as day 21 ( Figure 7 F). Lrrk2 G>S/+ (KI) mice were similarly permissive to Mtb replication, with higher CFUs in the lung at day 77 post-infection ( Figure 7 G). Gross examination revealed extensive inflammatory nodules within the lungs of Lrrk2 G2019S Tg mice compared with WT controls at days 21 and 77 ( Figure 7 H). Lungs from Lrrk2 G2019S mice trended toward greater inflammatory infiltrates at day 21, and by day 77, Lrrk2 G2019S lungs were almost completely obscured by coalescing inflammatory cell infiltrates ( Figure 7 I). Qualitatively, the lungs of Lrrk2 G>S/+ KI mice also exhibited signs of exacerbated inflammation ( Figure S7 G). Increased granulomatous nodules and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) were seen in Lrrk2 G2019S lungs by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining ( Figures 7 J and 7K), and enhanced neutrophil recruitment (CD45 + B220 − CD11b + Ly6G + ) was measured in Lrrk2 G2019S lungs at day 21 post-infection by flow cytometry ( Figure 7 L). Consistent with higher neutrophil recruitment, pro-inflammatory cytokine transcripts were higher in the lungs of Lrrk2 G2019S and Lrrk2 G>S/+ Mtb-infected mice at early and late infection time points ( Figures 7 M, S7 I, and S7K). ISG transcripts were also higher in the lungs of Lrrk2 G2019S and Lrrk2 G>S/+ mice during Mtb infection ( Figures S7 J and S7K), paralleling Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs following AIM2 activation ex vivo ( Figure S3 B). Previous studies have shown that accumulation of necroptosome proteins is indicative of necroptosis ( Liu et al., 2018 40. Liu, S. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Choi, H.M.C. ... Lysosomal damage after spinal cord injury causes accumulation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins and potentiation of necroptosis Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :476 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 38. Lim, J. ∙ Park, H. ∙ Heisler, J. ... Autophagy regulates inflammatory programmed cell death via turnover of RHIM-domain proteins eLife. 2019; 8 :e44452 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). We measured significantly higher levels of RIPK1 and RIPK3 by immunoblot in lung homogenates from Mtb-infected Lrrk2 G2019S mice at day 21 ( Figure 7 N). Although circulating levels of many soluble immune mediators were similar in WT and Lrrk2 G2019S Mtb-infected mice ( Figure S7 L), Lrrk2 G2019S Mtb-infected mice had high IL-6 and low IL-1α serum levels ( Figure 7 O), consistent with cells favoring necroptotic over pyroptotic cell death ( Di Paolo and Shayakhmetov, 2016 13. Di Paolo, N.C. ∙ Shayakhmetov, D.M. Interleukin 1alpha and the inflammatory process Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :906-913 Crossref Scopus (387) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, release of circulating cell-free mtDNA was enhanced in Lrrk2 G2019S mice at days 21 and 63 post-Mtb infection, indicating higher levels of mitochondrial stress ( Figures S7 M and S7N). These findings suggest that Mtb infection triggers more necroptosis in the lungs of Lrrk2 G2019S mice, leading to local hyperinflammation, immunopathology, and poor infection outcomes.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Cellular surveillance of mitochondrial integrity is a key checkpoint in the control of programmed cell death and release of inflammatory mediators. Here, we provide evidence that inflammatory phenotypes attributed to the human disease-associated allele Lrrk2 G2019S are due in large part to cell death modality switching driven by altered mitochondrial homeostasis. Specifically, our data support a model whereby mtROS licenses N-GSDMD to switch between a plasma membrane-associated executioner of pyroptosis to a mitochondrial-associated initiator of necroptosis. We report that upon bacterial infection of Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages, inflammasome activation proceeds normally, with caspase-1 cleaving GSDMD and pro-IL-1β. However, instead of forming pores in the plasma membrane to elicit IL-1β release and pyroptotic cell death, GSDMD is recruited to the mitochondria by excess ROS generated by overuse of the electron transport chain. At the mitochondria, N-GSDMD pores cause additional damage, leading to release of mtDAMPs and activation of RIPK1/RIPK3. RIPK3, likely through activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase ( Yang et al., 2018 85. Yang, Z. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... RIP3 targets pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to increase aerobic respiration in TNF-induced necroptosis Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :186-197 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), amplifies mtROS production, further enhancing RIPK and MLKL activation and triggering necroptosis.
These data lend additional support to an emerging model whereby flexible usage of cell death proteins evolved as a host adaptation against intracellular pathogens that suppress or subvert cell death pathways ( Fritsch et al., 2019 18.

It is tempting to speculate that although cells evolved flexible cell death pathways as a response to intracellular pathogens, these switches are also tripped by mitochondrial damage and mtDAMP release due to the ancient bacterial origins of the mitochondrion. Although balancing the distribution of GSDMD between mitochondrial and plasma membranes seems like a good way to modulate cell death outcomes, we still do not why N-GSDMD evolved to associate with mitochondria in the first place. It is possible that GSDMD forms pores in mitochondria to amplify cell death signals via release of cytochrome c ( Rogers et al., 2019 64. Rogers, C. ∙ Erkes, D.A. ∙ Nardone, A. ... Gasdermin pores permeabilize mitochondria to augment caspase-3 activation during apoptosis and inflammasome activation Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1689 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ) or to limit transcriptional upregulation of genes that promote cellular proliferation by releasing mtDNA and stimulating cGAS/STING ( Huang et al., 2021 29. Huang, Y.L. ∙ Zhang, G.H. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... Expression levels of caspase-3 and gasdermin E and their involvement in the occurrence and prognosis of lung cancer Cancer Rep. 2021; Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). It is also possible that GSDMD association with mitochondria is a carry-over from the Rickettsial origins of mitochondria, as N-GSDMD can bind to and kill bacteria in in vitro cultures ( Ding et al., 2016 14. Ding, J. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Liu, W. ... Pore-forming activity and structural autoinhibition of the gasdermin family Nature. 2016; 535 :111-116 Crossref Scopus (1825) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Despite having connected LRRK2-dependent mtROS production to GSDMD-dependent necroptosis, the precise mechanistic contribution LRRK2 kinase activity to Lrrk2 G2019S cell death is still not entirely clear. One intriguing possibility is that LRRK2, sometimes annotated as RIPK7, promotes necroptosis by acting as a receptor interacting protein (RIP) kinase family member itself ( Rideout and Re, 2017 60. Rideout, H.J. ∙ Re, D.B. LRRK2 and the “LRRKtosome” at the crossroads of programmed cell death: clues from RIP kinase relatives Adv. Neurobiol. 2017; 14 :193-208 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such activity could help explain how hLRRK2-G2019S controls hyperinflammation and susceptibility to bacterial infection in Drosophila , where GSDMD and pyroptosis are not conserved. Across insect genomes, one can identify innate immune receptors, adaptors, and transcription factors that encode RHIM-like motifs but lack kinase domains (e.g., PGRP-LE/LC, IMD, and Relish) ( Chan et al., 2015 8. Chan, F.K. ∙ Luz, N.F. ∙ Moriwaki, K. Programmed necrosis in the cross talk of cell death and inflammation Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :79-106 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is conceivable that LRRK2 acts as an evolutionarily conserved kinase bridge, modulating phosphorylation and activity of RHIM-containing innate immune proteins in insects as well as in mammals.
As mutations in LRRK2 are notoriously associated with both inherited and sporadic PD, it will be important to translate our findings to cells in the CNS. A growing literature supports a key role for necroptosome components in promoting inflammatory cell death in the CNS ( Iannielli et al., 2018 31. Iannielli, A. ∙ Bido, S. ∙ Folladori, L. ... Pharmacological inhibition of necroptosis protects from dopaminergic neuronal cell death in Parkinson's disease models Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :2066-2079 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oñate et al., 2020 54. Oñate, M. ∙ Catenaccio, A. ∙ Salvadores, N. ... The necroptosis machinery mediates axonal degeneration in a model of Parkinson disease Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27 :1169-1185 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yuan et al., 2019 86. Yuan, J. ∙ Amin, P. ∙ Ofengeim, D. Necroptosis and RIPK1-mediated neuroinflammation in CNS diseases Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2019; 20 :19-33 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ). We propose that cell death modality reprogramming is a major way in which mutations in genes like LRRK2 trigger and/or exacerbate multiple human diseases.
Our study reports that Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages are prone to cell death following inflammasome activation via GSDMD-mediated necroptosis. Although our findings are consistent with mtROS directing GSDMD to form pores on mitochondrial membranes, it is possible that other functions of LRRK2 related to mitophagy, endolysosomal trafficking, lysosome acidification, etc., also contribute to cell death. To date, we have only studied cell death phenotypes in BMDMs. Other immune cells may respond differently to infection and/or inflammasome stimulation. We already have some evidence of this, as circulating myeloid cells generate higher levels of inflammatory mediators like TNF-α following LPS treatment but Lrrk2 G2019S BMDMs do not. Because necroptosis does not carry a clear immune signature, it is difficult to definitively connect the cell death phenotypes we observe in Lrrk2 G2019S macrophages with hypersusceptibility and hyperinflammation during Mtb infection in vivo , especially given that Lrrk2 G2019S mice harbor increased bacterial loads. Generation of mouse lines that express Lrrk2 G2019S in a Mlkl −/− , Ripk1 −/− , or Ripk3 −/− genetic background will help clarify the mechanisms through which Lrrk2 G2019S -mediated necroptosis alters infection outcomes in vivo .

Lrrk2 G2019S mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Lrrk2 ∗ G2019S)2Yue/J, also known as FLAG-LRRK2-G2019S, stock # 012467 were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Femurs from Lrrk2 Tg WT mice (B6.Cg-Tg(Lrrk2)6Yue/J) were kindly provided by Dr. Malu Tansey at the University of Florida. Lrrk2 G2019S KI mice B6.Cg-Lrrk2tm1.1Hlme/J also known as LRRK2 G2019S knock-in, stock # 030961 were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Both Lrrk2 G2019S and G2019S KI mice are maintained with filial breeding on a C57BL6/J background and fed 4% standard chow. All mice used in experiments were compared to age- and sex- matched controls. Littermates were used for experiments. Mice used to generate BMDMs were males between 10-16 weeks old. For in vivo infection male and female mice were infected with Mtb at 10-12 weeks. Embryos used to make primary MEFs were 14.5 days post-coitum. All animals were housed, bred, and studied at Texas A&M Health Science Center under approved Institutional Care and Use Committee guidelines.
The Erdman strain was used for all M. tuberculosis infections. Low passage lab stocks were thawed for each experiment to ensure virulence was preserved. M. tuberculosis was cultured in roller bottles at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 10% OADC (BD Biosciences), 0.5% glycerol (Fisher), and 0.1% Tween-80 (Fisher) or on 7H10 plates. All work with M. tuberculosis was performed under Biosafety level 3 containment using procedures approved by the Texas A&M University Institutional Biosafety Committee.
Low passage glycerol lab stocks of M. marinum were grown in 7H9 broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 10% OADC (BD Biosciences), 0.5% glycerol (Fisher), and 0.1% Tween-80 (Fisher). Cultures were grown at 30 °C shaking in the dark.
Low passage glycerol lab stocks of L. monocytogenes strain 10304s were streaked onto BHI agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight.
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (SL1344) was obtained from Dr. Denise Monack, Stanford. S. T. stocks were streaked out on LB agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight.
w1118 and DaGal4 were obtained from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center. CGGal4 was provided by C. Thummel. UAS-hLRRK2, UAS-hLRRK2-G2019S and UAS-hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M were provided by C. Elliott (University of York). All flies were reared on standard yeast and cornmeal-based diet at 25 °C and 65% humidity on a 12 hr light/dark cycle, unless otherwise indicated. The standard lab diet (cornmeal-based) was made with the following protocol: 14 g Agar/165.4 g Malt Extract/ 41.4 g Dry yeast/ 78.2 g Cornmeal/ 4.7 mL propionic acid/ 3 g Methyl 4-Hydroxybenzoate/ 1.5 L water. In order to standardize metabolic results, 50 virgins were crossed to 10 males and kept in bottles for 2-3 days to lay eggs. Wet folded filters (GE healthcare, CAT No.10311843) were inserted in bottles after parental flies were removed. Progeny of crosses were collected for 3-4 days after initial eclosion. Collected progeny were then transferred to new bottles and allowed to mate for 2 days (representing unique populations). The following progeny, approximately 20 female flies, were then separated into each vial (before mock or oral infection treatment) for 10 days at 25 °C and 65% humidity on a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Post-mated female flies were used for all experiments due to sensitivity to Pseudomonas entomophila ( P.e. ) infection. The UAS-hLRRK2, UAS-hLRRK2-G2019S, UAS-hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M, CGGal4, and DaGal4 transgenic lines were backcrossed 10 times into the control strain w1118 background, continued backcrossing was performed every 6-8 months to maintain isogeneity. Details on the original generation of the hLRRK2, hLRRK2-G2019S, and hLRRK2-G2019S-K1906M transgenic flies, and the protein expression levels of each allele, can be found in Cording et al. (2017) 11.

Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were differentiated from BM cells isolated by washing mouse femurs with 10 mL DMEM 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 400 rcf and resuspended in BMDM media (DMEM, 20% FBS (Millipore), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Lonza), 10% MCSF conditioned media (Watson lab)). BM cells were counted and plated at 5x10 6 cells per 15 cm non-TC treated dishes in 30 mL complete BMDM media. Cells were fed with an additional 15 mL of BMDM media on day 3. Cells were harvested on day 7 with 1X PBS EDTA (Lonza). For ddC depletion of mitochondrial DNA BMDMs were treated with 10 μM ddC on day 3 and 5 of differentiation. Cells were harvested on day 7 of culture. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from embryos. Briefly, embryos were dissected from yolk sacs, washed 2 times with cold 1X PBS, decapitated, and peritoneal contents were removed. Headless embryos were disaggregated in cold 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Lonza) and incubated on ice for 20 min., followed by incubation at 37 °C for an additional 20 min. Cells were then DNase treated with 4 mL disaggregation media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 μg/mL DNASE I (Worthington)) for 20 min at 37 °C. Supernatants were isolated and spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in complete MEF media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate), and plated in 15 cm TC-treated dishes 1 dish per embryo in 25 mL of media. MEFs were allowed to expand for 2-3 days before harvest with trypsin 0.05% EDTA.
Multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each bacterial infection is listed by experiment in the figure legends. For M. tuberculosis infection, the inoculum was prepared by growing bacteria to log phase (OD600 0.6-0.8). Bacterial cultures were spun at low speed (500 rpm) for 5 min to remove clumps. Bacteria were then pelleted with a spin at 3000 rpm 5 min and washed with 1X PBS this step was repeated twice. Resuspended bacteria were briefly sonicated and spun at low speed once again to further remove clumps. The bacteria were diluted in DMEM (Hyclone) + 10% horse serum (Gibco) in vitro infections, or 1X PBS in vivo infections. For in vitro infections plates containing bacteria and cells were spun for 10 min at 1000 rpm to synchronize infection. Following the spin fresh media was added to cells along with inhibitors of interest See “cell stimulation with innate immune agonist” for concentrations.
For M. marinum infection, the inoculum was prepared by growing bacteria to log phase (OD600 0.6-0.8). Bacterial cultures were spun at 2700 rcf for 10 min and washed in 1X PBS. Bacteria were pulled through a syringe with a 26 gauge needle 3 times to create single cell suspension. Bacteria were then centrifuged twice for 2 min at 2000 rcf to remove clumps. The bacteria were diluted in DMEM (Hyclone) + 10% horse serum (Gibco) and added to cells. Bacterial/cell plates were then spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min to synchronize infections after which fresh cell culture media was added. For cell death infection assays with M. marinum cells were incubated at 32°C.
For L. monocytogenes infection, the inoculum was prepared by growing bacteria in BHI overnight at 37 °C. The following morning, cultures were diluted 1:5 in fresh BHI, grown to log phase (OD600 0.5-1.0) at 37 °C 2-3 hrs. Upon reaching mid-log phase, 1 mL of bacteria were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 3 min and washed twice with 1X PBS. Bacteria were diluted in DMEM (Hyclone) and added to cells. spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min then incubated for 10 min at 37°C prior to adding fresh media and proceeding with downstream assays.
For S. Typhimurium infection overnight cultures of bacteria were grown in LB broth containing 0.3 M NaCl and grown at 37 °C until they reached an OD600 of 0.9. On the day of infection cultures were diluted 1:20. Once cultures had reached mid-log phase (OD600 0.6-0.8) 2-3 hrs, 1 mL of bacteria were pelleted at 5000 rpm for 3 min and washed twice with 1X PBS. Bacteria were diluted in DMEM (Hyclone) and added to cells. Bacteria/cells were spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min then incubated for 10 min at 37°C prior to adding fresh media and proceeding with downstream assays.
On day 5 of differentiation BMDMs were reseeded at 0.35x10 6 cells/ well in triplicate in 12-well non-tissue culture treated plates. The following day media was replaced with 500 μL fresh BMDM media 30 min prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using Fugene SI reagent and 10 μM of siRNA stock against either Gsdmd (s87492), Zbp1 (s233871), Trif (s98708), or Mlkl (s92952). For a negative control, Silencer® Select Negative Control #1 (4390843) was used. Cells were incubated for 24 hrs in transfection media, then allowed to rest for 48h at 37 °C prior to downstream survival experiments.
BMDMs were plated in 96-well half area plates at 2.5x10 4 cells/well, 12-well plates at 5x10 5 cells/well, 6-well plates at 1x10 6 cells/well. To analyze upregulation of ISGs and NFkB associated genes, cells were stimulated for 4 hrs. with 1 μM CL097 (InvivoGen), 100 ng/mL LPS (InvivoGen), 100 ng/mL Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen). Cells were transfected for 4 hrs. with 1 μg/mL ISD (Watson lab), 1 μg/mL poly I:C (InvivoGen), 1 μg/mL cGAMP (InvivoGen) using lipofectamine reagent (Thermo Fisher). Cells were transfected for 4 hrs with 1 μM CpG 2395 (IDT) using Gene Juice (EMD Millipore). To analyze AIM2 inflammasome activation, cells were stimulated with either 10 ng/mL LPS (InvivoGen) or Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen), for 3 hrs followed by 1 μg/mL poly dA:dT (InvivoGen) transfection with lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher) at a 3:1 ratio. To analyze NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cells were stimulated with either 10 ng/mL LPS (InvivoGen) or Pam3CSK4 (InvivoGen), for 3 hrs followed by 25 μM nigericin (ThermoFisher). For rescue assays cells were treated at the time of LPS priming with 100 μM AC-YVAD-CMK (InvivoGen), 25 μM dapansutrile (Cayman Chemicals), 1 μM GNE9605 (Cayman Chemicals), 50 μM Z-IETD-FMK (BD biosciences), 10 μM necrostatin-1 (Calbiochem), 10 μM GSK2982772 (Cayman Chemicals), 1 μM GSK872 (Cayman Chemicals), 25 μM Necrox-5 (Cayman chemicals), 25 μM menadione (Sigma), or 1 hr before AIM2 activation 1 μM disulfiram (Sigma), 20 μM necrosulfamide (EMD millipore).
BMDMs were plated in 96-well half area clear bottom plates (Corning) at 2.5x10 4 cells/well in 50 μL of media using a multichannel pipette. After adherence to plate (approximately 1-2 hrs), an additional 25 μL of media was added to each well containing cells. The following day media was removed and 10 ng/mL LPS was added along with respective inhibitor if applicable (see paragraph above for inhibitor details). When performing cell death assays, just prior to 3 hrs post LPS stimulation 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (ThermoFisher) was added to each well and exposure/focus was calibrated at 4X magnification on either a Lionheart plate reader or Cytation 5 (BioTek). total cell numbers were determined using NucBlue (Thermo Fisher) (2 drops per mL) in 1X PBS with a subset of the plated cells. For ROS assays, to detect cellular oxidation cellROX green (ThermoFisher) was used. Cells were stained for 30 min in 5 μM cellROX green in culture media at 37 °C. To detect mitochondrial superoxide mitoSOX (ThermoFisher) was used. Cells were stained for 10 min in 5 μM mitoSOX in 1X PBS 2% FBS at 37 °C. For image analysis Gen 3.5 software (BioTek) was used. Dead cells were counted by PI staining of nucleus. Mean fluorescence intensity was calculated from images taken at 10X magnification by creating a mask around NucBlue staining nuclei. A secondary mask was extended for the signal of interest (cellROX (FITC-channel) or mitoSOX (RFP-channel)) 10 μM around each nucleus.
For mammalian tissue and cells, RNA was isolated using Direct-zol RNAeasy kits (Zymogen). cDNA was synthesized with Bio-Rad iScript Direct Synthesis kits (BioRad) per manufacturer’s protocol.

Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 rcf for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in 1X PBS 2% FBS 200 nM MitoTracker green (Invitrogen) and allowed to stain for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once with PBS 2% FBS and were resuspend in ice cold mitoFLOW buffer containing 300 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1X Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. Lysis was performed by vortexing cells for 3 min followed by removal of debris by centrifugation at 400 rcf for 5 min at 4 °C. For antibody labeling samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rcf for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspend in 50 μL blocking buffer (5% BSA in mitoFLOW buffer),and incubated on ice for 15 min.

Ex vivo stimulation and analysis of PBMCs by flow cytometry was performed essentially as described in: Lei et al.( Lei et al., 2021 34. Lei, Y. ∙ Guerra Martinez, C. ∙ Torres-Odio, S. ... Elevated type I interferon responses potentiate metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and accelerated aging in mtDNA mutator mice Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabe7548 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized and whole blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes. Red blood cells were subjected to 2 rounds of lysis with 1X ACK lysis buffer. Leukocytes were then stimulated in RPMI+10% FBS containing LPS (1 μg/mL) in the presence of protein transport inhibitors brefeldin A and monensin for 4 hrs. Ghost Dye 710 (Tonbo) was used as a live dead stain. Fc receptors were blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 Fc shield (2.4G2, 70-0161, Tonbo), and cells were stained with antibodies against surface proteins CD3 (APC-fire, BioLegend), CD11b (APC Cy7, Tonbo), CD19 (BV605, BioLegend), Ly6C (BV650, BioLegend), MHCII (BV711, BioLegend), Ly6G (PE, Tonbo ), F4/80 (PerCP- C5.5, Tonbo). Permeabilization of cells was achieved with Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Kit (TNB-0607-KIT, Tonbo), and cells were stained with antibodies against intracellular TNF-α (PEC7, BioLegend). Flow cytometry was performed on a 5-laser Cytek Aurora, and Flow-Jo software was used for post-acquisition analysis.
For ex vivo analysis of lung cell populations on day 21 post Mtb infection, the inferior lobe was isolated and washed in 1X PBS followed by mincing and digestion for 1 hr in Dispase (5 U/ml) at 37 °C. Following digestion tissue was passed through 70 μm filters to achieve single cell suspensions. Live dead staining was performed using Ghost dye 510 (Tonbo). Fc receptors were blocked using CD16/CD32 monoclonal antibody (eBiosciences). Cells were stained with antibodies against surface proteins CD11b (BV421, BD Biosciences), CD11c (BV605, BioLegend), CD45 (BV785, BioLegend), CD170 (eFluor-488, eBiosciences), MHCII (PE, BD Biosciences), Ly6G (PerCP-Cy5.5, eBiosciences), Ly6C (APC, eBiosciences), CD206 (APCeFLuor-700 eBiosciences), B220 (APCeFluor-780, eBiosciences).

Cell counts were based on live single cells (Ghost low/- ) in 200 μL or 1/3 lung lobe. Flow cytometry was performed on the LSR Fortessa X20, and Flow-Jo software was used for post-acquisition analysis.
BMDMs were plated in 10 cm dishes at 1x10 7 . The next day, plates were treated with LPS and poly dA:dT as indicated. To harvest, cells were lifted with 1X PBS EDTA. Cells were washed and resuspended in 5 mL 1X PBS. Total DNA was isolated from 2% of resuspended cells and treated with 25 mM NaOH. The samples were boiled for 30 min then neutralized with 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0. The remainder of the cell suspension was pelleted at 3000 rcf for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 500 μL cytosolic lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50 μg/mL digitonin, 10 mM EDTA) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were spun down at 1000 rcf to pellet intact cells and nuclei that were then used for obtaining the membrane fraction. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and spun down at 15000 rcf to remove additional organelle fragments and transferred to a fresh tube. Cytosolic protein was obtained by transferring 10% of supernatant to a fresh tube with 4X sample buffer + DTT and boiled for 5 min. Cytosolic DNA was isolated from the remaining supernatant by mixing an equal volume of 25:24:1 phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol, vigorously shaken and centrifuged for 10 min at ∼21130 rcf (max speed). The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and DNA was precipitated by mixing with 300 mM sodium acetate 10 mM MgCl 2 and 1 μL glycogen and 3 volumes of 100% ethanol. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation at max speed for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet is washed with 1 mL of cold 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 5 min at max speed. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air dried for approximately 10 min. The pellet is resuspended with 200 μL EB. For the mitochondrial membrane fraction, the pellet of intact cells previously collected was resuspended in 500 μL membrane lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40), vortexed then centrifuged for 3 min at 7000 rcf. 50 μL of the cleared lysate was transferred to a fresh tube and received 4X sample buffer + DTT. Western blot analysis was used to check for contaminating mitochondrial proteins in the cytosolic fraction compared to the membrane fraction. qPCR was performed using total DNA diluted 1:100 and cytosolic DNA diluted 1:2 and measured Tert , 16s , ND4 and DLoop . The total and cytosolic reactions were normalized to Tert to control for variation in cell numbers.
MEFs were seeded at 1x10 5 cells/well on glass coverslips in 24-well dishes. BMDMs were seeded at 3x10 5 cells/well on glass coverslips in 24-well dishes. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at RT and then washed three times with PBS. Coverslips were incubated in primary antibody diluted in PBS + 5% non-fat milk + 0.1% Triton-X (PBS-MT) for 3 hrs. Primary antibodies used in this study were phospho-MLKL (Ser358) (D6H3V) (Cell Signaling Technology, #91689; 1:200), GSDMD [EPR20859] (Abcam, ab219800, 1:100), and TOM20 (clone 2F8.1; Millipore Sigma, MABT166, 1:100).Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen, 1:500, or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen, 1:1000) and DAPI (1:10,000) diluted in PBS-MT for 1 hr. Coverslips were washed twice with 1X PBS and twice with deionized water and mounted on glass slides using Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen). Z-stack images were obtained using an Olympus IX83 inverted confocal microscope equipped with 60X oil immersion objective. Quantifications were performed using Fiji ImageJ. Images were opened as separate channels and z-stacks were converted to maximum intensity projections. Each channel was thresholded such that the region of interest was masked, and then particles (nuclei) counted and the region of interest (GSDMD) measured. For LipidTOX assays fixed coverslips were washed gently three times with 1X PBS and incubated in DAPI (1:10,000) for five minutes. Coverslips were washed again gently three times with 1X PBS. LipidTOX neutral stain was diluted 1:1000 in 1X PBS. Cells were incubated with LipidTOX for 30 min in the dark at RT and mounted on microscope slides for imaging. Images were taken on the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope at 60X. Quantification of lipid droplets was conducted manually. For annexin-V staining for cell death, cells on coverslips were infected with mCherry M. tuberculosis (Erdman) at MOI 2 for 24 and 48 hrs. Cells were washed 1X in cold PBS and incubated with 1.25 μL FITC annexin V-FITC (Biolegend Cat.640906) in cold annexin binding buffer (Biolegend Cat. 422201) for 15 min at RT in the dark. Cells were washed 1X with RT annexin binding buffer and fixed in cold 4% PFA in annexin binding buffer for 10 min. Cells were washed 2X with 1X PBS at RT, washed with DAPI-PBS, and mounted onto slides. Images were taken on Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope at 60X. Quantification of Mtb and Annexin V positive cells was conducted manually.
Prior to downstream analysis, mitochondria were isolated using a Mitochondria/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (ab65320). Briefly, 5x10 6 BMDMs were lifted on 10 cm plates using 1X PBS-EDTA and pelleted at 600 rcf for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in 500 μL 1X Cytosolic Extraction Buffer Mix provided by the kit without DTT or Protease Inhibitors and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized on ice with 100 passes using the tight-fitting pestle B to lyse the cells followed by differential centrifugation. Homogenate was centrifuged at 700 rcf for 10 min at 4 °C to clear un-lysed cells and nuclei. The supernatant was collected and placed into a fresh tube and centrifuged at 10,000 rcf for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected into a fresh tube and 4X sample buffer with 5 mM DTT was added. The pellet was either resuspended in 1X PBS for flow cytometry or lysed in sample buffer with 5 mM DTT for western analysis.
Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 1X RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, with the addition of 1 U/mL Benzonase to degrade genomic DNA. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 hr at RT in LiCOR Odyssey blocking buffer or TBS with 5% BSA. Blots were incubated overnight at RT with the following antibodies: ACTB (Abcam, 1:2000), DRP1 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000); pDRP1 Ser616 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), pDRP1 Ser637 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000),TFAM (Millipore, 1:1000), VDAC1 (Protein Tech, 1:1000). Membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 hrs at RT prior to imaging on a LiCOR Odyssey Fc Dual-Mode Imaging System. For protein isolated from lung, lung tissues were homogenized using Fisherbrand™ Disposable Tissue Grinders with 200 μl 1X PBS containing 20X proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce). Samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and spun for 1 hr at 10,000 rcf at 4 °C. Following spin, 200 μl of supernatants were transferred to tubes containing 20X SDS. Samples were boiled for 10 min. Protein concentrations were measured using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After the BCA, 50 μg of protein was run on Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free precast gels and transferred onto a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membrane. Following blocking for 1 hr in 5% BSA/TBS, primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA/TBST and probed overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with the secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 for 2 hrs prior to imaging on a LI-COR Odyssey FC Imaging System. Primary antibodies used were α-RIP1 (Cell Signaling Technology #3493), α-RIP3 (Cell Signaling Technology #95702), and α-IL-1β (Cell Signaling Technology #12507) α-IFNβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology # sc-57201)
The cDNAs encoding human and mouse GSDMD were inserted into a modified pET28(a) vector with an N-terminal Avi-His6-SUMO-tag. The proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 in regular LB medium (BD). When OD600 reached 1.0, the cells were induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and cultured overnight at 16 °C. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Then, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 by sonication on ice. After centrifugation at 4 °C, 16000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants containing the target proteins were loaded onto a nickel-NTA column equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After washing the column with 200 mL washing buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5), the target proteins were eluted with the elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5). The Avi-His6-SUMO tag was cleaved using SUMO protease at 4 °C overnight and removed using a nickel-NTA column. Human and mouse GSDMD were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex200 (16/60 GL) column (GE Healthcare) in a running buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, at pH 7.5.
To express inactive mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain (residue 100 to 373), it was cloned into a modified pET28(a) vector with an N-terminal His6-SUMO-tag. Cys254 in the active site of caspase-11 was mutated to alanine. Asp285 was replaced with a thrombin cleavage site with the sequence LVPRGS. The inactive mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain was expressed and purified using the same protocol used for GSDMD. After purification on a Superdex200 column, the inactive mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain was incubated with thrombin at 4 °C overnight and further purified on a Superdex200 column in the same running buffer as for GSDMD. To generate active mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain (residue 100 to 373), it was cloned into a modified pET28(a) vector with an N-terminal His6-SUMO-tag and a C-terminal His6-tag. There is a thrombin recognition site LVPRGS between His6- and SUMO- tag. Asp285 was replaced with a thrombin cleavage site. The His6-SUMO-mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain-His6 protein was expressed in E.coli BL21 and purified by nickel-NTA column using the same protocol used for GSDMD. The eluted protein from nickel-NTA column was incubated with SUMO protease and thrombin at 4 °C overnight. The active mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain-His6 protein was purified by a nickel-NTA column and SUMO-tag was removed. Then, it was further purified on a Superdex200 column in the same running buffer as for GSDMD.
All the proteins were stored in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, at pH 7.5. To test if the active mouse caspase-11 catalytic domain protein can cleave GSDMD or not, GSDMD was diluted into the reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 3 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20, 10 mM DTT, pH 7.5. The final concentration of GSDMD was 0.5 mg/ml and the ratio of GSDMD and caspase-11 was 10:1 (w/w). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
All infections were performed using procedures approved by Texas A&M University Institutional Care and Use Committee. The Mtb inoculum was prepared as described above. Age- and sex-matched mice were infected via inhalation exposure using a Madison chamber (Glas-Col) calibrated to introduce 100-200 CFUs per mouse. For each infection, approximately 5 mice were euthanized immediately, and their lungs were homogenized and plated to verify an accurate inoculum. Infected mice were housed under BSL3 containment and monitored daily by lab members and veterinary staff. At the indicated time points, mice were euthanized, and tissue samples were collected. Blood was collected in serum collection tubes, allowed to clot for 1-2 hrs at RT, and spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min to separate serum. Serum cytokine analysis was performed by Eve Technologies. Organs were divided to maximize infection readouts (CFUs: left lobe lung and ½ spleen; histology: 2 right lung lobes and ¼ spleen; RNA: 1 right lung lobe and ¼ spleen). For histological analysis organs were fixed for 24 hrs in neutral buffered formalin and moved to ethanol (lung, spleen). Organs were further processed as described below. For cytokine transcript analysis, organs were homogenized in Trizol, and RNA was isolated as described below. For CFU enumeration, organs were homogenized in 5 ml PBS + 0.1% Tween-80, and serial dilutions were plated on 7H10 plates. Colonies were counted after plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 weeks.
Lungs and spleens fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin followed by 70% ethanol were subjected to routine processing, embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or acid-fast stain (Diagnostic BioSystems). A board certified veterinary pathologist performed a masked evaluation of lung sections for inflammation using a scoring system: score 0, none; score 1, up to 25% of fields; score 2, 26-50% of fields; score 3, 51-75% of fields; score 4, 76-100% of fields. To quantify the percentage of lung fields occupied by inflammatory nodules, scanned images of at least 2 sections of each lung were analyzed using Fiji ImageJ (NIH) to determine the total cross-sectional area of inflammatory nodules per total lung cross sectional area( Schindelin et al., 2012 67. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Sera was analyzed by Eve Technologies: Mouse Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 13-plex Secondary Panel (MD13). Briefly, sera was isolated following decapitation in Microtainer serum separator tubes (BD Biosciences) followed by sterile filtration 2 times with Ultrafree-MC sterile filters, 10 min at 10,000 rpm (Millipore Sigma). For analysis sera was prediluted 1:1 to a final volume of 100 μL in 1x PBS pH 7.4 and assayed/analyzed in duplicate.
Serum samples from untreated, day 21 or day 63 infected mice were boiled for 10 min and DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Cat # 69504), following the protocol for nonnucleated blood. 100 uL of boiled serum was used for all samples. A standard curve was generated by pooling all samples and serial diluting by a factor of 5 while the sample DNA was diluted 1 to 10. mtDNA was measured by qPCR amplifying DLoop.
Bacterial entomopathogen strain P.e. was grown in LB medium at 29°C, shaking at 200 rpm overnight. Fresh bacterial cultures were generated daily. The liquid cultures were poured into a sterile centrifuge flask and centrifuged at 4000 rcf at 4 °C for 15 min. The liquid LB medium was removed from the centrifuge flask, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in a small amount of LB medium. The final bacteria concentration (of the resuspended pellet, OD600=50-60 for P.e. ) was adjusted by diluting with additional LB medium. Bacterial cultures were routinely genotyped for accuracy and reproducibility of experiments.
To prepare the inoculum, 2.5% and 5% sucrose (in sterile water) were prepared fresh. The 5% sucrose solution was mixed with an equal volume of bacteria solution (at OD600=50-60 for P.e. ) to create the solution used for oral infection (feeding). NOTE: This OD were used for all experiments except for survival analysis. 10 day-old mated female flies (20 per vial) were transferred to a fly food vial containing filter paper completely covering the food. Filter paper was soaked with a solution consisting of either 185 μL bacterial oral infection mix (for infections) or 2.5% sucrose solution, for unchallenged (mock) controls. Flies were always infected at 3:00 - 4:00 pm to ensure diurnal reproducibility, and subsequently incubated at 25 °C and 65% humidity on a 12 hr light/dark cycle for required infection times (16-20h for P.e. ) while feeding.
For fat body/adipose immunostaining, carcass was dissected (with all eggs and intact intestines removed) in 1X PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with 1X PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (1X PBST) and then blocked in blocking buffer (5% BSA in 1X PBST) for 1h. Primary antibodies; anti-ATP5A (ab14748, 1:500, Abcam) was applied overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with Alexa Flour-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, 1:500), and fresh Nile Red solution (1 μL 0.004% Nile Red Solution in 500 μL 1X PBS) with Hoechst (DAPI; 1:500), overnight at 4 °C, followed by rinsing with 1X PBS. Confocal images were collected using a Nikon Eclipse Ti confocal system (utilizing a single focal plane) and processed using the Nikon software and Adobe Photoshop. ATP5A Staining intensity was quantified using ImageJ. The image scale was set according the image size (Analyze > set scale). The ATP5A signal was marked using freehand selection tools. The area of marked signal was measured using the measure tool (Analyze > measure). At least 3-5 individual fat body whole images (using a global scale) were measured and averaged.
Mock-treated or P.e . infected flies were sterilized with 70% ethanol and washed with sterile 1X PBS along with dissecting forceps and dissecting dish. Midguts from flies were then dissected individually in 1X PBS. Each gut was homogenized using a sterile pestle in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes containing 200 μL 1X PBS. Homogenates were diluted 1:1000 with 1X PBS. 50 μL of the diluted homogenates were plated on LB plates and incubated at 29 °C overnight. The number of bacterial colonies (colony forming units; CFUs) in each plate were counted (only counting separated, well defined single colonies). At least 10 individual guts were measured for each treatment. Colonies derived from midgut dissections were routinely genotyped (using P.e. specific primers) for accuracy and reproducibility of experiments. All plates from mock-treated controls were negative for bacterial colonies. CFU/fly for every plate was calculated using the following formulas: CFU/ml = ((total number of colonies on a plate) ∗ (dilution factor (1000)) / (plated volume: 0.05ml). CFU/fly = ((CFU/ml) ∗ total volume Eppendorf tube: 0.2ml)) / (number of flies per condition: 1 gut).
Flies were infected with P.e. at OD600=30-40 as described above and kept at 25 °C for 16 hrs. After overnight feeding (flies were always orally infected at 3:00 - 4:00 pm), bacterial infected flies were transferred from bacterial infection vials to vials containing standard lab food. Flies were transferred every day to a fresh vial for the first two days, and every two days after, and dead flies were counted (and removed) when changing vials.
All data are representative of two or more independent experiments with n=3 or greater unless specifically noted in the figure legends. For all quantifications, n represents the number of biological replicates, either number of wells containing cells, number of mice, or number of flies. Error bars represent SEM. For in vitro assays, statistical significance was determined using either a two-tailed Student’s unpaired T test, one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s post hoc test, or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. For in vivo mouse infections, significance was determined using a Mann-Whitney U test based on the assumption that samples (mice) followed a non-normal distribution. The specific statistical test used to determine significance for each experiment is listed at the end of the figure legends. All calculations of significance were determined using GraphPad Prism 7 Software expressed as P values The threshold for significance was determined by a p value of < 0.05, and annotated as ∗ = p<0.05, ∗∗ = p<0.01, ∗∗∗ = p<0.001. For in vivo infection mouse experiments, we estimated that detecting a significant effect requires two samples to differ in CFUs by 0.7e∧10. Using a standard deviation of 0.3e∧10 for each population, we calculated that a minimum size of 4 age- and sex-matched mice per group per time point is necessary to detect a statistically significant difference by a t-test with alpha (2-sided) set at 0.05 and a power of 80%. Therefore, we used a minimum of 4 mice per genotype per time point to assess infection-related readouts.
