Title: FBXO44 promotes DNA replication-coupled repetitive element silencing in cancer cells


Abstract: Summary

Repetitive elements (REs) compose ∼50% of the human genome and are normally transcriptionally silenced, although the mechanism has remained elusive. Through an RNAi screen, we identified FBXO44 as an essential repressor of REs in cancer cells. FBXO44 bound H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at the replication fork and recruited SUV39H1, CRL4, and Mi-2/NuRD to transcriptionally silence REs post-DNA replication. FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition reactivated REs, leading to DNA replication stress and stimulation of MAVS/STING antiviral pathways and interferon (IFN) signaling in cancer cells to promote decreased tumorigenicity, increased immunogenicity, and enhanced immunotherapy response. FBXO44 expression inversely correlated with replication stress, antiviral pathways, IFN signaling, and cytotoxic T cell infiltration in human cancers, while a FBXO44-immune gene signature correlated with improved immunotherapy response in cancer patients. FBXO44/SUV39H1 were dispensable in normal cells. Collectively, FBXO44/SUV39H1 are crucial repressors of RE transcription, and their inhibition selectively induces DNA replication stress and viral mimicry in cancer cells.

Section: Introduction

Repetitive elements (REs) maintain genomic stability and chromosome architecture and drive human genome evolution and diversity ( Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007 59. Slotkin, R.K. ∙ Martienssen, R. Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8 :272-285 Crossref Scopus (1485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Major types of REs in humans include interspersed LTR-based endogenous retroviruses (ERVs; 8% of genome) and non-LTR-based short- and long-interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs and LINEs, respectively; 35% of genome). Other REs include DNA transposons (3% of genome) and tandemly arrayed simple repeats, such as satellite and telomeric repeats (3% of genome) that result from improper replication ( Ishak et al., 2016 26. Ishak, C.A. ∙ Marshall, A.E. ∙ Passos, D.T. ... An RB-EZH2 Complex Mediates Silencing of Repetitive DNA Sequences Mol.

Repeat DNA in genome organization and stability Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2015; 31 :12-19 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). The regulatory sequences of several REs, such as LTRs, have been co-opted through evolution as cis -regulatory promoter/enhancer elements to control gene regulatory networks involved in development, inflammatory response, and fertility, among other processes ( Chuong et al., 2017 12. Chuong, E.B. ∙ Elde, N.C. ∙ Feschotte, C. Regulatory activities of transposable elements: from conflicts to benefits Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18 :71-86 Crossref Scopus (815) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thompson et al., 2016 62. Thompson, P.J. ∙ Macfarlan, T.S. ∙ Lorincz, M.C.

Cell. 2016; 62 :766-776 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Transposable elements and tandem repeats promote replication fork stalling and non-allelic recombination events between homologous repeats, thus posing a major threat to genome integrity ( Konkel and Batzer, 2010 33. Konkel, M.K. ∙ Batzer, M.A. A mobile threat to genome stability: The impact of non-LTR retrotransposons upon the human genome Semin. Cancer Biol. 2010; 20 :211-221 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Padeken et al., 2015 45. Padeken, J. ∙ Zeller, P. ∙ Gasser, S.M. Repeat DNA in genome organization and stability Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2015; 31 :12-19 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). To counteract these adverse effects, REs are normally transcriptionally silenced in somatic cells through repressive epigenetic modifications that are thought to include DNA methylation (5-methyl-cytosine) and nucleosome modifications, including deacetylation, trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3), and trimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me3) ( Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007 59. Slotkin, R.K. ∙ Martienssen, R. Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8 :272-285 Crossref Scopus (1485) PubMed Google Scholar ). These repressive modifications are facilitated by multiple, functionally redundant enzymes. For example, H3K9me3 modifications can be mediated by histone methyltransferases (HMTs) SETDB1, G9a (EHMT2), SUV39H1, and SUV39H2. However, mechanistic details regarding how REs are silenced in human cells, especially in relation to the maintenance of repressive modifications through DNA replication cycles, have not been fully elucidated.
Compromised RE silencing can activate their transcription, potentially leading to the accumulation of cytosolic double-stranded (ds)RNA and dsDNA replication intermediates that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) RIG-I/MDA5 and cGAS, respectively, which normally function to detect exogenous pathogens ( Jones et al., 2019 28. Jones, P.A. ∙ Ohtani, H. ∙ Chakravarthy, A. ... Epigenetic therapy in immune-oncology Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :151-161 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kassiotis and Stoye, 2016 30. Kassiotis, G. ∙ Stoye, J.P. Immune responses to endogenous retroelements: taking the bad with the good Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16 :207-219 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). RIG-I and MDA5 activate mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), whereas cGAS stimulates a signaling cascade that activates stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING). Activation of either pathway stimulates IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3/7-dependent transcription of IFN stimulatory genes (ISGs) that initiate IFN-driven antiviral immune responses. Robust stimulation of these pathways can also trigger regulated cell death (RCD) ( Vanpouille-Box et al., 2018 67. Vanpouille-Box, C. ∙ Demaria, S. ∙ Formenti, S.C. ... Cytosolic DNA Sensing in Organismal Tumor Control Cancer Cell. 2018; 34 :361-378 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies have shown that induction of RE transcription in cancer cells beyond a threshold level of tolerance through treatment with DNA demethylating agents or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors augments the effectiveness of antitumor therapies, including immunotherapy ( Ishak et al., 2018 27. Ishak, C.A. ∙ Classon, M. ∙ De Carvalho, D.D. Deregulation of Retroelements as an Emerging Therapeutic Opportunity in Cancer Trends Cancer. 2018; 4 :583-597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, tumor-specific RE silencing mechanisms that can be effectively targeted for treatment have not been identified.
Based on this background, we undertook a discovery effort to identify novel regulators of REs in cancer cells through a genetic screen for potential modifiers of the key histone modification, H3K9me3.

Section: Results

To identify H3K9me3 regulators in cancer cells, we performed a cell image-based RNA interference (RNAi) screen that detected changes in levels of H3K9me3 and phosphorylated (p)-RPA32 T21 (DNA replication stress marker) in a panel of cancer cell lines ( Figure 1 A) ( Rantala et al., 2011 47. Rantala, J.K. ∙ Makela, R. ∙ Aaltola, A.R. ... A cell spot microarray method for production of high density siRNA transfection microarrays BMC Genomics. 2011; 12 :162 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the top hits, short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown (KD) of FBXO44 decreased chromatin-associated H3K9me3 modifications and increased p-RPA32 T21 levels ( Figures 1 B–1D). FBXO44 is a member of the F-box protein family that shares a function as substrate recognition factors for the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF)-type ubiquitin ligase ( Skaar et al., 2013 58. Skaar, J.R. ∙ Pagan, J.K. ∙ Pagano, M. Mechanisms and function of substrate recruitment by F-box proteins Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14 :369-381 Crossref Scopus (515) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fractionation experiments detected FBXO44 in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and bound to chromatin ( Figure 1 E). Immunoprecipitation (IP) verified FBXO44 interacted with histone H3 in chromatin fractions ( Figure 1 F). Immunoblotting confirmed that FBXO44 KD reduced chromatin-associated H3K9me3, and to a lesser extent H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 modifications ( Figure 1 G). H3K27me3, H3K36me3, and H3K79me2 modifications were unaffected. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that FBXO44 was highly enriched at repetitive DNA (94.6%) and heterochromatin (2.4%), with little binding at promoters, enhancers, or transcribed regions (<3% total) ( Figure 1 H; Table S1 ). Specifically, FBXO44 binding localized to various RE subtypes ( Figure 1 I). FBXO44 chromatin binding sites strongly co-localized with H3K9me3, and much less with H3K27me3 or H3K4me3 modifications, across the genome and specifically at REs ( Figures 1 J–1M and S1 A; Table S2 ). ChIP experiments confirmed enrichment of FBXO44 bound at various subfamilies of satellite repeats (MajSAT, mcBox, and SATIII), SINE/LINEs (Alu and L1), and ERV (HERV-K) ( Figure 1 N). FBXO44 targeting diminished H3K9me3 modifications at these REs ( Figures 1 M, 1O, and S1 A). qRT-PCR analysis showed that FBXO44 KD activated the transcription of various RE subfamilies ( Figures 1 P and S1 B), including REs that displayed decreased H3K9me3 level in FBXO44 KD cells, indicating they were direct targets of FBXO44. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) confirmed the upregulated expression of various REs in FBXO44 KD cells ( Figure S1 C; Table S3 ). Of note, the RE subtypes activated by FBXO44 KD partially overlapped with those activated by targeting histone H3K4 demethylase, LSD1 ( Figure S1 D) ( Sheng et al., 2018 54. Sheng, W. ∙ LaFleur, M.W. ∙ Nguyen, T.H. ... LSD1 Ablation Stimulates Anti-tumor Immunity and Enables Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2018; 174 :549-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these findings demonstrate that FBXO44 co-localized with H3K9me3 modifications and was essential for RE transcriptional silencing in cancer cells.
Protein mass spectrometry analysis revealed that FBXO44 interacted with several chromatin modifiers/remodelers previously implicated in heterochromatin assembly ( Figure 2 A; Table S4 ), including components of Mi-2/NuRD (GATAD2A/B, CHD4, MBD2, MTA1-3, and HDAC1-2), CTBP transcriptional co-repressor (PRMT5, MEP50, and WIZ), and polycomb repressor complex (PRC2)/EED-EZH2 (EED) ( Kadoch et al., 2016 29.

Mi-2/NuRD complex function is required for normal S phase progression and assembly of pericentric heterochromatin Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22 :3094-3102 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ). FBXO44 also interacted with the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase (DDB1 and CUL4B), as well as DDB1 and CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) RBBP4 and RBBP7, which was implicated in regulation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in human cells ( Higa et al., 2006 23. Higa, L.A. ∙ Wu, M. ∙ Ye, T. ... CUL4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase interacts with multiple WD40-repeat proteins and regulates histone methylation Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :1277-1283 Crossref Scopus (355) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hu et al., 2012 25. Hu, H.L. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Ji, Q.H. ... CRL4B Catalyzes H2AK119 Monoubiquitination and Coordinates with PRC2 to Promote Tumorigenesis Cancer Cell. 2012; 22 :781-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) confirmed FBXO44 interacted with components of Mi-2/NuRD and CRL4, as well as RBBP4/7 ( Figures 2 B and S2 A). Moreover, FBXO44 interacted with H3K9me3 methyltransferase SUV39H1 ( Figure 2 B). To determine if FBXO44 cooperated with SUV39H1, CRL4 RBBP4/7 , and Mi-2/NuRD in RE silencing, we targeted each enzyme/complex component and analyzed H3K9me3 levels and RE transcription. Targeting SUV39H1 or CUL4B, or co-KD of Mi-2/NuRD components GATAD2A+B, decreased total chromatin-associated H3K9me3 modifications, comparable to FBXO44 KD ( Figure 2 C). ChIP experiments showed targeting SUV39H1, CUL4B, GATAD2A+B, or RBBP4+7 decreased H3K9me3 modifications at various REs, similar to FBXO44 KD ( Figure 2 D). These KD cells also activated RE transcription comparable to FBXO44 KD cells ( Figure 2 E). Of note, although IP experiments demonstrated that FBXO44 interacted with CUL1 in chromatin fractions ( Figure 1 F), ChIP experiments showed CUL4B, but not CUL1, was enriched at REs ( Figure S2 B). Further, CUL1 KD did not activate RE transcription ( Figure S2 C). Collectively, these results suggest FBXO44 serves a CUL1-independent function by cooperating with SUV39H1, CRL4 RBBP4/7 , and Mi-2/NuRD to transcriptionally silence REs in cancer cells.
Next, we characterized FBXO44’s molecular interactions with SUV39H1, CRL4 RBBP4/7 , and Mi-2/NuRD. CoIP experiments showed that endogenous SUV39H1 interacted with CRL4 components, CUL4B and DDB1, and these interactions were FBXO44-dependent ( Figure 2 F). However, FBXO44 KD did not affect CRL4 complex assembly ( Figure 2 G). Interaction of FBXO44 and SUV39H1 depended on Mi-2/NuRD components GATAD2A+B, although interaction between FBXO44 and GATAD2B was SUV39H1-independent ( Figures 2 H and 2I). FBXO44 consists of an N-terminal F-box domain and C-terminal F-box-associated domain (FBA), which presumably binds substrates. ChIP experiments showed that expression of an siRNA-resistant cDNA encoding F-box deleted FBXO44 (ΔF-FBXO44) that did not interact with CUL1 but appropriately localized in cells ( Figures S2 D and S2E), could not compensate for FBXO44 in mediating H3K9me3 modifications at REs in FBXO44 KD cells ( Figure 2 J). CoIP experiments revealed that ΔF-FBXO44 interacted with histone H3.1, CUL4B/DDB1, and RBBP4/7, but not GATAD2B or SUV39H1 ( Figures S2 F–S2J). Together, these data suggest that FBXO44 functions as an adaptor protein, with its FBA domain mediating interactions with chromatin and CRL4 RBBP4/7 and N-terminal F-box-containing region required for interaction with SUV39H1 and Mi-2/NuRD.
As FBXO44 targeting decreased the interaction of SUV39H1, CUL4B, and Mi-2/NuRD with chromatin, a phenotype rescued by expression of an siRNA-resistant FBXO44 cDNA ( Figure 2 K), we hypothesized that FBXO44 might recruit these enzymes to REs to initiate transcriptional silencing. FBXO44 KD prevented recruitment of SUV39H1, CUL4B, RBBP4/7, and Mi-2/NuRD (GATAD2A/B and CHD4) to REs in ChIP experiments ( Figure 2 L). Targeting RBBP4+7 inhibited recruitment of SUV39H1, CUL4B, and GATAD2A/B, but not FBXO44 ( Figure S2 K). CUL4B reduction prevented SUV39H1 and GATAD2A/B recruitment, although FBXO44 was unaffected ( Figure S2 L). Further, targeting GATAD2A+B inhibited SUV39H1 recruitment, but not FBXO44 or CUL4B ( Figure S2 M). In contrast, SUV39H1 KD had no effect on FBXO44, CUL4B, RBBP4/7, or GATAD2A/B recruitment to REs ( Figure S2 N). These data suggest that FBXO44 functions upstream of SUV39H1, CRL4 RBBP4/7 , and Mi-2/NuRD in RE silencing. In support of this, introduction of ΔF-FBXO44 into FBXO44 KD cells promoted recruitment of RBBP4/7, but not SUV39H1, to REs ( Figure 2 M). ChIP experiments also demonstrated that FBXO44 KD diminished mono-ubiquitylation of H2AK119 at REs ( Figure S2 O), a repressive chromatin modification mediated, in part, by CRL4 ( Hu et al., 2012 25. Hu, H.L. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Ji, Q.H. ... CRL4B Catalyzes H2AK119 Monoubiquitination and Coordinates with PRC2 to Promote Tumorigenesis Cancer Cell. 2012; 22 :781-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mass spectrometry revealed that FBXO44 interacted with several DNA replication proteins, including PCNA, CHAF1A/B, and MCM7 ( Figure 2 A; Table S4 ). In addition, FBXO44 accumulated in the nucleus in S phase ( Figure 3 A). CoIP experiments also showed that FBXO44 preferentially interacted with DNA replication-associated histone H3.1, relative to histone H3.3 ( Figure 3 B), which is deposited by a DNA synthesis-independent pathway ( Tagami et al., 2004 61. Tagami, H. ∙ Ray-Gallet, D. ∙ Almouzni, G. ... Histone H3.1 and H3.3 complexes mediate nucleosome assembly pathways dependent or independent of DNA synthesis Cell. 2004; 116 :51-61 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1047) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that FBXO44 could coordinate RE silencing with DNA replication and investigated FBXO44’s interaction with chromatin as a function of DNA replication by aniPOND analysis ( Leung et al., 2013 37. Leung, K.H.T. ∙ Abou El Hassan, M. ∙ Bremner, R. A rapid and efficient method to purify proteins at replication forks under native conditions Biotechniques. 2013; 55 :204-206 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). FBXO44 specifically interacted with newly replicated chromatin and dissociated within 60 min following DNA replication ( Figure 3 C). To identify the potential trigger for FBXO44 chromatin binding, we performed in vitro binding assays using recombinant FBXO44 and synthetic H3K9me3-, H3K9me1-, or un-modified nucleosomes revealing that FBXO44 selectively bound to H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes ( Figure 3 D), consistent with ChIP-seq data that showed FBXO44 co-localized with H3K9me3 modifications in cells ( Figures 1 J–1M and S1 A). A modified aniPOND experiment demonstrated that FBXO44 bound H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes of newly replicated chromatin ( Figure 3 E). Together, these results demonstrate that FBXO44 bound H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at the replication fork to initiate RE silencing post-DNA replication ( Figure 3 F).
FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD increased the level of p-RPA32 T21 in cancer cells, indicating DNA replication stress ( Figure S3 A). FBXO44 KD cells also accumulated in S phase and displayed reduced EdU incorporation ( Figures 3 G and 3H). Furthermore, FBXO44 KD activated the DNA replication checkpoint, as indicated by increased p-ATR S428 and p-CHK1 S345 ( Figure 3 I). Targeting FBXO44/SUV39H1, GATAD2A+B, CUL4B, or RBBP4+7 increased γH2AX, indicating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) ( Figures 3 I and S3 B) and activated p53 expression ( Figure 3 I). FBXO44 KD-induced γH2AX was enriched at REs compared to randomly selected control genes, on ChIP analysis ( Figure 3 J). Thus, FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition promotes DNA replication stress and DSBs in cancer cells.
FBXO44/SUV39H1 targeting induced the accumulation of cytosolic dsRNA and dsDNA in cancer cells ( Figures 4 A and 4B). IP of the cytosolic dsRNA and RNase A protection experiments revealed that FBXO44 KD cells contained dsRNA generated from various REs subtypes ( Figures 4 C and S4 A). FBXO44 KD cells also contained cytosolic dsDNA generated from these RE subtypes ( Figure 4 D). Accordingly, RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS and cGAS-STING antiviral pathways were activated in FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD cells ( Figures 4 E, S1 B, and S4 B). FBXO44 KD cells also displayed increased p-IRF3 S386 , a modification that stimulates IRF3 nuclear translocation and activity ( Li and Chen, 2018 39. Li, T. ∙ Chen, Z.J. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway connects DNA damage to inflammation, senescence, and cancer J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :1287-1299 Crossref Scopus (775) PubMed Google Scholar ), and increased IRF7 expression ( Figure 4 E) ( Honda et al., 2006 24. Honda, K. ∙ Takaoka, A. ∙ Taniguchi, T. Type I inteferon gene induction by the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors Immunity. 2006; 25 :349-360 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1051) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transfection of cytosolic dsRNA or dsDNA isolated from FBXO44 KD cells activated MAVS or STING transcription, respectively, in recipient cells ( Figure 4 F). FBXO44 KD cells also exhibited increased micronuclei that stained positive for cGAS and γH2AX compared to control cells on immunofluorescence (IF) analysis ( Figure 4 G), consistent with their generation via genomic instability ( Mackenzie et al., 2017 43. Mackenzie, K.J. ∙ Carroll, P. ∙ Martin, C.A. ... cGAS surveillance of micronuclei links genome instability to innate immunity Nature. 2017; 548 :461-465 Crossref Scopus (1113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bakhoum et al., 2018 6. Bakhoum, S.F. ∙ Ngo, B. ∙ Laughney, A.M. ... Chromosomal instability drives metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response Nature. 2018; 553 :467-472 Crossref Scopus (943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these data suggest that cytosolic dsRNA and dsDNA generated from REs, as well as DNA replication stress, contribute to activate antiviral pathways in FBXO44 KD cells.
Consistently, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of FBXO44 KD RNA-seq data revealed positive regulation of defense response, activation of innate immune response, and inflammatory response among the most upregulated gene expression pathways in FBXO44 KD cells ( Figures 4 H and 4I; Table S5 ). FBXO44 KD increased the expression of many ISGs in RNA-seq ( Figure S4 C; Table S5 ). We confirmed that FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD activated the expression of IFN-α/β and several ISGs, including chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10, by qRT-PCR ( Figures 4 E, S1 B, and S4 B). FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD enhanced the secretion of IFN-β, CCL5, and CXCL10 ( Figure 4 J), which promote intratumoral infiltration of effector T cells ( Jones et al., 2019 28. Jones, P.A. ∙ Ohtani, H. ∙ Chakravarthy, A. ... Epigenetic therapy in immune-oncology Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :151-161 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ; Topper et al., 2017 64. Topper, M.J. ∙ Vaz, M. ∙ Chiappinelli, K.B. ... Epigenetic Therapy Ties MYC Depletion to Reversing Immune Evasion and Treating Lung Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1284-1300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). None of the protein-coding genes bound by FBXO44 and harboring H3K9me3 modifications were antiviral genes or ISGs on ChIP-seq ( Table S2 ), indicating the induced antiviral pathways and ISGs were indirect effects of FBXO44 targeting. In support of these data, transfection of cytosolic dsRNA or dsDNA isolated from FBXO44 KD cells activated IFN-β expression in recipient cells ( Figure 4 F). Next, we investigated the importance of antiviral pathways in inducing IFN in FBXO44 KD cells. FBXO44 KD induced the expression of IFN-α/β in cancer cell lines that failed to activate either MAVS or STING, indicating stimulation of either dsRNA or dsDNA sensing pathway was sufficient to trigger the antiviral response ( Figure S1 B). Co-targeting of MAVS+STING in FBXO44 KD cells rescued the induced IFN-β ( Figure 4 K). Similarly, simultaneous targeting of IRF3+IRF7 rescued the induced IFN-β in FBXO44 KD cells more efficiently than KD of IRF3 or IRF7 alone ( Figure S4 D). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition promotes cytosolic accumulation of dsRNA and dsDNA that trigger RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS and cGAS-STING antiviral pathways and IFN signaling in cancer cells.
GSEA analysis of FBXO44 KD cellular RNA-seq data identified several upregulated immune-related gene expression pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and antigen processing cross presentation ( Figure 4 L). FBXO44 KD increased expression of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, which encode the IFN-γ receptor, and decreased IFN-γ signaling inhibitor PTPN2, indicating potentially augmented responses to immune cell-derived IFN-γ ( Figure 4 E). Given that FBXO44 KD associated with enhanced antigen processing and presentation, we analyzed the effects on cancer cell immunogenicity. FBXO44 KD induced ∼40 cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) on RNA-seq data ( Figure 4 M; Table S5 ), including MAGE-A and SSX family members that are immunotherapy targets in human cancers ( Gjerstorff et al., 2015 20. Gjerstorff, M.F. ∙ Andersen, M.H. ∙ Ditzel, H.J. Oncogenic cancer/testis antigens: prime candidates for immunotherapy Oncotarget. 2015; 6 :15772-15787 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). FBXO44 KD increased SSX1 protein expression on IF analysis ( Figure S4 E). In orthogonal experiments, FBXO44 KD enhanced SSX1 surface expression on flow cytometry ( Figure S4 F). Similarly, FBXO44 KD cells increased expression of several natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands, including ULBP2, which was enhanced on the cell surface ( Figures 4 M, S4 E, and S4F). Thus, FBXO44 inhibition promotes cancer cell immunogenicity in vitro .
Activation of IFN signaling and genomic instability can promote cellular proliferation arrest and apoptosis ( Sheng et al., 2018 54. Sheng, W. ∙ LaFleur, M.W. ∙ Nguyen, T.H. ...

Recolin, B. ∙ van der Laan, S. ∙ Tsanov, N. ... Molecular mechanisms of DNA replication checkpoint activation Genes (Basel). 2014; 5 :147-175 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). In preclinical studies, efficient FBXO44 KD diminished the proliferation of all cancer cell lines tested ( Figure 5 A), including patient-derived glioblastoma cultures (GSC1517 and GSC1552) enriched in cancer stem cells (CSCs), accompanied by increased apoptosis ( Figure 5 B). Consistent with reduced proliferation, FBXO44 KD downregulated cancer-associated gene expression pathways, including cell cycle, cell division, and DNA replication, on RNA-seq ( Figures 4 H and S5 A). FBXO44 KD also decreased the fraction of breast cancer cells that expressed CSC markers (CD24 − CD44 + ) and inhibited tumorsphere formation of breast cancer and glioblastoma cells ( Figures 5 C and S5 B). FBXO44 KD decreased cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro ( Figure 5 D). Co-targeting of MAVS+STING partially rescued the decreased proliferation of FBXO44 KD cells in vitro ( Figure 5 E). In addition, the S phase accumulation and decreased viability of FBXO44 KD cells were partially rescued by co-KD of MAVS+STING ( Figures 5 F and S5 C). In contrast, co-KD of MAVS+STING failed to rescue the induced γH2AX in FBXO44 KD cells ( Figure S5 D).
To assess whether this epigenetic regulatory pathway could potentially be targeted for cancer treatment, we focused on SUV39H1 and its chemical inhibitor F5446 ( Lu et al., 2019 41. Lu, C. ∙ Yang, D. ∙ Klement, J.D. ... SUV39H1 Represses the Expression of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Effector Genes to Promote Colon Tumor Immune Evasion Cancer Immunol. Res. 2019; 7 :414-427 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). F5446 treatment reduced chromatin-associated H3K9me3 ( Figure S5 E) and activated the expression of various REs and IFN signaling in cancer cells ( Figures S5 F and S5G), similar to SUV39H1 KD ( Figure S4 B). F5446 treatment also reduced the survival of cancer cell lines and patient-derived glioblastoma cultures ( Figure 5 G).
To establish the potential of a therapeutic index for FBXO44/SUV39H1, we examined the role of FBXO44/SUV39H1 in RE silencing in normal cells. FBXO44 KD did not affect the proliferation of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) or primary astrocytes ( Figure 5 H), nor increased the expression of REs, MAVS/STING, or IFN-β ( Figure S5 H), or increased γH2AX ( Figure S5 I). In addition, F5446 treatment minimally affected HMEC and astrocyte viability ( Figure 5 G). HMECs and astrocytes displayed decreased H3K9me3 levels and FBXO44/SUV39H1 binding at REs compared to cancer cell lines on ChIP ( Figures S5 J–S5L), supporting cancer cell-specific effects of FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition on RE transcription.
FBXO44 KD decreased metastatic seeding of cancer cells to the lung, brain, and bone in immunodeficient mice ( Figures S6 A–S6C). FBXO44 KD also decreased orthotopic mammary tumor growth ( Figures S6 D–S6F). Co-targeting of MAVS+STING only partially rescued the decreased tumor growth induced by FBXO44 KD, consistent with in vitro data showing it could not fully rescue the anti-proliferation effect of FBXO44 KD cells ( Figure 5 E). Thus, FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition decreases cell-autonomous tumor growth in mice only partially dependent on MAVS/STING signaling.
Considering the activation of IFN signaling, we next examined whether inhibition of tumor cell-intrinsic FBXO44/SUV39H1 influenced the tumor immune microenvironment. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were applied to diminish FBXO44 or SUV39H1 expression in mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells to levels that activated REs, IFN-α/β, and ISGs, but permitted tumor growth, thus mimicking pharmacological inhibition in cancer treatment ( Figures 6 A and S6 G). FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD increased the intratumoral abundance of CD8 + T and natural killer (NK) cells ( Figure 6 B). The CD8 + /Treg cell ratio and number of IFN-γ + CD8 + T cells also increased in FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD tumors, indicating a functional immune response ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis confirmed enhanced infiltration of CD8 + T and NK cells in FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD tumors ( Figure 6 D). FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD also enhanced PD-L1 and H-2Kd MHC class I alloantigen surface expression on 4T1 tumor cells in vivo ( Figure 6 E), corroborating in vitro qRT-PCR data ( Figures 4 E, S1 B, S4 B, S5 F, S5G, and S6 G), demonstrating enhanced immunogenicity in vivo and potentially circumventing a major pathway of cancer cell immune evasion, consistent with other studies using DNA methylation or LSD1 inhibitors ( Chiappinelli et al., 2015 11. Chiappinelli, K.B. ∙ Strissel, P.L. ∙ Desrichard, A. ... Inhibiting DNA Methylation Causes an Interferon Response in Cancer via dsRNA Including Endogenous Retroviruses Cell. 2015; 162 :974-986 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1219) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sheng et al., 2018 54. Sheng, W. ∙ LaFleur, M.W. ∙ Nguyen, T.H. ... LSD1 Ablation Stimulates Anti-tumor Immunity and Enables Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2018; 174 :549-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-targeting of MAVS+STING rescued the increased intratumoral infiltration of CD8 + , NK, and IFN-γ + CD8 + cells and enhanced PD-L1 and H-2Kd MHC class I alloantigen surface expression on tumor cells induced by FBXO44 KD ( Figures S6 H–S6J), consistent with in vitro data showing the induced IFN-β expression in FBXO44 KD cells was dependent on MAVS+STING ( Figure 4 K).
FBXO44 inhibition induced IFN signaling, enhanced cancer cell immunogenicity, and increased intratumoral infiltration of CD8 + T cells; phenotypes associated with a favorable response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy ( Jones et al., 2019 28. Jones, P.A. ∙ Ohtani, H. ∙ Chakravarthy, A. ... Epigenetic therapy in immune-oncology Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :151-161 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ; Keenan et al., 2019 31. Keenan, T.E. ∙ Burke, K.P. ∙ Van Allen, E.M. Genomic correlates of response to immune checkpoint blockade Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :389-402 Crossref Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate whether targeting tumor cell-intrinsic FBXO44/SUV39H1 could overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy, we treated immunocompetent mice bearing 4T1 cell-derived control, FBXO44 KD, or SUV39H1 KD mammary tumors with either anti-PD-1 or isotype immunoglobulin G (IgG) control antibodies ( Figure 6 F). As expected, 4T1 control tumors were refractory to anti-PD-1 treatment ( Bertrand et al., 2017 7. Bertrand, F. ∙ Montfort, A. ∙ Marcheteau, E. ... TNF alpha blockade overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 in experimental melanoma Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :2256 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD tumors displayed enhanced sensitivity. Mice bearing FBXO44/SUV39H1 KD tumors treated with anti-PD-1 therapy exhibited increased survival compared to control mice ( Figure 6 G). Co-targeting of MAVS+STING rescued the enhanced antitumor response to anti-PD-1 therapy and increased survival induced by FBXO44 KD ( Figures S6 K and S6L). Thus, targeting tumor cell-intrinsic FBXO44/SUV39H1 enhanced immunogenicity and ICB therapy response in a MAVS/STING-dependent manner, in addition to anti-proliferative and anti-tumorigenic effects.
Next, we evaluated the effects of pharmacologically targeting SUV39H1 on tumor growth and immunotherapy response. F5446 treatment inhibited mammary tumor growth in immunocompromised mice in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 6 H–6J). F5446-treated tumors exhibited a dose-dependent increase in γH2AX and cleaved caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis ( Figure 6 K). Consistent with the observed effects in vitro ( Figures S5 F and S5G), F5446-treated tumors upregulated expression of REs, IFN-α/β, and ISGs ( Figure 6 L). In addition, F5446 treatment enhanced the sensitivity of 4T1 tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy, resulting in increased mouse survival ( Figures 6 M–6O).
To investigate whether FBXO44 associated with human tumorigenesis and therapeutic responses, we interrogated public cancer transcriptomic data, revealing FBXO44 overexpression in many human cancer types compared to normal adjacent tissues ( Figure 7 A). FBXO44 was expressed at low levels in normal breast tissues and increased with tumor stage ( Figure 7 B). High FBXO44 expression correlated with poor patient outcome in several major cancer types ( Figure 7 C).
Next, we interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to determine if FBXO44 expression associated with the tumor immune microenvironment in cancer patients. Pan-cancer analysis showed that FBXO44 expression inversely correlated with gene expression signatures of CD8 + T and NK cell infiltration and antigen processing and presentation ( Figures 7 D and S7 A; Table S6 ). FBXO44 expression inversely correlated with innate immune system, cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, RIG-I/MDA5-mediated induction of IFN-α/β pathways, and regulation of IFN-γ signaling, among other immune-related processes ( Figures 7 E, 7F, and S7 B), confirming our results from in vitro and mouse models. Specifically, FBXO44 expression strongly anti-correlated with antiviral mechanism by IFN stimulated genes and interferon signaling in various human cancers ( Figure 7 G; Table S7 ). FBXO44 expression also strongly anti-correlated with activation of ATR in response to replication stress ( Figure S7 C; Table S7 ), consistent with activation of the DNA replication checkpoint in FBXO44 KD cells in vitro ( Figure 3 I).
To investigate the clinical relevance of FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition for cancer immunotherapy, we created a FBXO44-immune gene signature and evaluated its predictive value across multiple public cancer immunotherapy datasets, including anti-PD-1 and tumor-infiltrating T cell (TIL) therapies ( Figure S7 D). Responders to immune therapies expressed higher levels of the FBXO44-immune gene signature than non-responders across most of the datasets ( Figures 7 H, 7I, and S7 E), suggesting that FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition sensitizes cancers to immunotherapy.

Section: Discussion

During replication of heterochromatin, parental H3K9me3-modified H3-H4 tetramers are evicted ahead of the replication fork and randomly re-deposited along with newly synthesized tetramers onto sister chromatids, resulting in a half reduction in H3K9me3 modifications and potential transcriptional activation of these regions ( Allshire and Madhani, 2018 4.

Proliferation-dependent and cell cycle-regulated transcription of mouse pericentric heterochromatin J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179 :411-421 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we demonstrated that FBXO44 functions as an epigenetic “reader” that binds H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at the replication fork and recruits an enzymatic complex that includes SUV39H1 to rapidly reassemble heterochromatin and transcriptionally silence REs to avoid potentially adverse effects on genome integrity. SUV39H1’s interaction with chromatin and REs in cancer cells depended on FBXO44 and, indirectly, through its interaction with Mi-2/NuRD, as co-targeting of GATAD2A+B inhibited SUV39H1 recruitment. This epigenetic regulatory complex is similar to the DIM-5/7/9-CUL4-DDB1 complex (DCDC) in Neurospora crassa , in which the scaffold protein DIM-7 targets H3K9me3 methyltransferase DIM-5 and CUL4-DDB1-DIM-9(DCAF) to heterochromatic domains ( Gessaman and Selker, 2017 18. Gessaman, J.D. ∙ Selker, E.U. Induction of H3K9me3 and DNA methylation by tethered heterochromatin factors in Neurospora crassa Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

DNA Methylation and Normal Chromosome Behavior in Neurospora Depend on Five Components of a Histone Methyltransferase Complex, DCDC PLoS Genet. 2010; 6 :e1001196 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the proposed role for FBXO44 in DNA replication-coupled RE silencing, H3K9me3 modifications primarily occur in S phase ( Alabert et al., 2015 3. Alabert, C. ∙ Barth, T.K. ∙ Reveron-Gomez, N. ...

A model for mitotic inheritance of histone lysine methylation EMBO Rep. 2012; 13 :60-67 Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar ), concomitant with FBXO44’s translocation to the nucleus. In addition, SUV39H1 was found enriched at nascent chromatin using a quantitative proteomics approach ( Alabert et al., 2014 2. Alabert, C. ∙ Bukowski-Wills, J.C. ∙ Lee, S.B. ... Nascent chromatin capture proteomics determines chromatin dynamics during DNA replication and identifies unknown fork components Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16 :281-293 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, CRL4 is intricately involved in DNA replication and repair ( Abbas and Dutta, 2011 1. Abbas, T. ∙ Dutta, A. CRL4Cdt2: master coordinator of cell cycle progression and genome stability Cell Cycle. 2011; 10 :241-249 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cooperates with SUV39H1 in H3K9me3-mediated repression of Igfbp3 in cancer cells ( Yang et al., 2015 71. Yang, Y. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Qiu, R. ... CRL4B promotes tumorigenesis by coordinating with SUV39H1/HP1/DNMT3A in DNA methylation-based epigenetic silencing Oncogene. 2015; 34 :104-118 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). FBXO44 and CRL4 functionally cooperate in proteasomal degradation of regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2) ( Sjogren et al., 2015 57. Sjogren, B. ∙ Swaney, S. ∙ Neubig, R.R. FBXO44-Mediated Degradation of RGS2 Protein Uniquely Depends on a Cullin 4B/DDB1 Complex PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0123581 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although FBXO44/SUV39H1 were essential for RE silencing in cancer cells, FBXO44/SUV39H1 levels were decreased at REs and FBXO44/SUV39H1 targeting did not activate RE transcription in normal cells. The cancer cell-specific role of FBXO44/SUV39H1 in RE silencing could be attributed to the decreased levels of DNA methylation at RE in human cancers ( Anwar et al., 2017 5. Anwar, S.L. ∙ Wulaningsih, W. ∙ Lehmann, U. Transposable Elements in Human Cancer: Causes and Consequences of Deregulation Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017; 18 :e974 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ehrlich, 2002 16. Ehrlich, M. DNA methylation in cancer: too much, but also too little Oncogene. 2002; 21 :5400-5413 Crossref Scopus (1300) PubMed Google Scholar ) and/or absence of compensatory H3K9me3 modification pathways. Alternatively, FBXO44/SUV39H1-mediated RE silencing could be uniquely required for rapidly proliferating cells to prevent DNA replication stress and genome instability that could result from the progressive loss of H3K9me3 with each DNA replication cycle. Consistent with this, SUV39H1/2 promotes H3K9me3 modifications at intact LINE and ERV sequences in rapidly dividing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), although LINE silencing is largely governed by DNA methylation in somatic cells ( Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014 8.

The profile of repeat-associated histone lysine methylation states in the mouse epigenome EMBO J. 2005; 24 :800-812 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data demonstrate that FBXO44/SUV39H1 are crucial suppressors of DNA replication stress and IFN signaling in cancer cells ( Figure 7 J). FBXO44/SUV39H1 targeting restricted cancer cell autonomous growth and stimulated antitumor T cell immunity. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of FBXO44/SUV39H1 targeting on cancer cells were partially rescued by MAVS+STING KD, suggesting the induced DNA replication stress and DSBs in these cells likely contribute to these phenotypes. However, the increased IFN-β expression and enhanced CD8 + and NK cell intratumoral infiltration induced by FBXO44 KD were dependent on these antiviral pathways. The triggers that activated antiviral pathways in FBXO44 KD cancer cells were cytosolic dsRNA and dsDNA, at least partially generated from various RE subtypes, and genomic instability. In contrast, the anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells treated with low-dose DNA methylation inhibitor or LSD1 inhibitor are thought to be mediated through reactivation of ERVs and stimulation of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS ( Chiappinelli et al., 2015 11. Chiappinelli, K.B. ∙ Strissel, P.L. ∙ Desrichard, A. ...

LSD1 Ablation Stimulates Anti-tumor Immunity and Enables Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2018; 174 :549-563 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as IRF7 ( Roulois et al., 2015 50. Roulois, D. ∙ Loo Yau, H. ∙ Singhania, R. ... DNA-Demethylating Agents Target Colorectal Cancer Cells by Inducing Viral Mimicry by Endogenous Transcripts Cell. 2015; 162 :961-973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (976) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition could promote a more robust viral mimicry in cancer cells compared to these agents.
The majority of patients with solid tumors do not receive long-term benefit from ICB therapy. Mechanisms of resistance include decreased CD8 + T cell abundance and defective IFN signaling or antigen presentation ( Tumeh et al., 2014 66. Tumeh, P.C. ∙ Harview, C.L. ∙ Yearley, J.H. ...

Resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy through inactivation of antigen presentation Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :1136 Crossref Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ). FBXO44/SUV39H1 targeting sensitized normally refractory cancer cells to anti-PD-1 therapy. Therefore, FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibitors could potentially convert “cold” tumors, which are poorly immunogenic and non-responsive to immunotherapy, to “hot” ( Sharma et al., 2017 53. Sharma, P. ∙ Hu-Lieskovan, S. ∙ Wargo, J.A. ... Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3421) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, SUV39H1 targeting reactivated expression of effector genes in tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells in a pre-clinical mouse cancer model indicating reprogramming of T cell exhaustion ( Lu et al., 2019 41. Lu, C. ∙ Yang, D. ∙ Klement, J.D. ... SUV39H1 Represses the Expression of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Effector Genes to Promote Colon Tumor Immune Evasion Cancer Immunol. Res. 2019; 7 :414-427 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), a phenotype also observed with DNA methylation inhibitor treatment ( Ghoneim et al., 2017 19. Ghoneim, H.E. ∙ Fan, Y. ∙ Moustaki, A. ... De Novo Epigenetic Programs Inhibit PD-1 Blockade-Mediated T Cell Rejuvenation Cell. 2017; 170 :142-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (529) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, our study demonstrates that FBXO44 promotes DNA replication-coupled transcriptional silencing of RE in cancer cells. Moreover, FBXO44/SUV39H1 are crucial suppressors of DNA replication stress and IFN signaling in cancer cells. FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibitors could have widespread application in cancer treatment, as stand-alone anti-cancer therapies and enhancers of immunotherapy response.

All cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in recommended culture media. Specifically, MDA-MB-231, BT-549, MCF7, A549, and H446 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Corning), HEK293T, HEK293FT, and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (Corning), MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured in MEM (Corning), U2OS and HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A (Corning). The above media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. Patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) were obtained ( Xie et al., 2018 69. Xie, Q. ∙ Wu, T.P. ∙ Gimple, R.C. ... N(6)-methyladenine DNA Modification in Glioblastoma Cell. 2018; 175 :1228-1243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cultured in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #11360070) supplemented with B27 without vitamin A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A3353501), EGF, and bFGF (20 ng/mL each; R&D Systems), sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #11360070), and GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 35050061). HMECs (Lonza, #CC-2551) were cultured in MEGM BulletKit Medium (Lonza, #CC-3150). Primary astrocytes were cultured in Astrocyte Medium (ScienCell, #1801). All cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . The cell cultures were authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis.
Mice were maintained under pathogen free conditions in 14 hr light / 10 hr dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All animal handling and procedures used were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of SBP or UCSD. For intracardiac injections, 10 5 MDA-MB-231-luc cells transduced with lentivirus expressing non-targeting or FBXO44 shRNA were resuspended in 100 μL DPBS and injected into the left ventricle of 6-week old female athymic nude mice (Envigo no. 069) anesthetized with isoflurane. Metastatic seeding was monitored weekly by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 μL of 30 mg/mL D-Luciferin (Xenogen no. XR-1001) 10 min prior to imaging using the IVIS Spectrum Xenogen Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). Images were analyzed using Living Image 3.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences). For ex vivo imaging of tissues, mice were injected with D-Luciferin prior to euthanasia, tissues harvested and placed in 24-well tissue culture plates containing 1 mL of 0.3 mg/mL D-Luciferin and imaged. Organs/tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. For orthotopic injections of NSG mice, 3 × 10 6 MDA-MB-231-luc cells were suspended in 100 μL of PBS and injected into the mammary fat pads of 4- to 6-week-old female mice. For F5446 drug treatments, mice were randomly divided into 3 groups at day 12. The mice were administered vehicle (10% Cremophor EL in PBS) or F5446 at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight via i.p. injection on days 12, 14, 17, 19, 21 and 24 post-inoculation of cells. Tumor size was measured every 4-5 days (long diameter and short diameter) with a caliper and tumor volume calculated as 0.5 × length × width × width. Mice were imaged weekly to monitor tumor growth and metastasis in vivo using an IVIS Spectrum Xenogen Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences). All mice were euthanized at day 25 except 3 mice were taken out from each group for tumor IHC staining of γH2AX and cleaved caspase 3 and quantitative RT-PCR analysis at day 21. For 4T1 tumor experiments, 10 5 4T1 cells were inoculated into the mammary fat pads of 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory). Tumor size was measured twice weekly. After 22 days, mice were euthanized and portions of each tumor processed for flow cytometry and histological analysis. For antibody treatments, mice were administered 200 μg rat IgG2a isotype control (BioXCell no. BP0089) or anti-PD-1 (BioXCell no. BP0273) antibody via i.p. injection on days 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23 post-inoculation of 4T1 cells. For combination treatments, mice were administered vehicle (10% Cremophor EL in PBS) or F5446 at 10 mg/kg body weight via i.p. injection on days 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22 post-inoculation of cells and administered 200 μg rat IgG2a isotype (control) or anti-PD-1 antibody via i.p. injection on days 15, 17, 19, 21, and 23 post-inoculation of 4T1 cells. Mouse survival was monitored with tumor volume exceeding 2000 mm 3 , weight loss >20%, and decreasing behavioral conditions considered as endpoints.
Plasmid transfections were performed using jetPRIME transfection reagent (Polyplus) for HEK293T and HEK293FT cells and Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for all other cell lines, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Lentiviruses were generated using HEK293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and vectors pLenti CMV Puro DEST (Addgene plasmid no. 17452), pLiX_402 (Addgene plasmid no. 41394), or pLKO.1 (Addgene plasmid no. 10878) using standard techniques. Single and multiple viral transductions were performed in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich).
The quantitative image-based H3K9me3 regulator screen was performed using a cell-spot microarray approach ( Rantala et al., 2011 47. Rantala, J.K. ∙ Makela, R. ∙ Aaltola, A.R. ...

For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.01% SDS) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μg/mL Aprotinin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, 1 μg/mL Pepstatin). Lysates were briefly sonicated, clarified, then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk or BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) at 25°C for 1 hr, followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3 × 10 min in TBST and incubated with species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) for 1 hr at 25°C. After 3 × 10 min washes in TBST, membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent before being exposed to film or ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad). For IP, cells were lysed in IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) with inhibitors (50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μg/mL Aprotinin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, 1 μg/mL Pepstatin) followed by sonication and centrifugation to clear insoluble debris. Lysates were then incubated with protein G agarose beads and IgG antibody of the same species as the IP antibody for 2 hr at 4°C to reduce non-specific binding. The cleared lysates were then incubated with IP antibody overnight at 4°C. Specifically, for Flag IP, 5 μg of anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich no. F7425) was used for 2500 μg of protein lysate. For Myc IP, anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling Technology no. 2276) was used at 1:1000 dilution. For FBXO44 IP, 5 μL of anti-FBXO44 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich no. HPA003363) was used for 10 6 cells. For CUL4B IP, 2 μg of anti-CUL4B antibody (Proteintech no. 12916-1-AP) was used for 2500 μg of protein lysate. For SUV39H1 IP, anti-SUV39H1 antibody (Millipore no. 05-615) was used at 1:100 dilution. Beads were washed with IP buffer, boiled in 1x SDS gel loading buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis as described above.

RNase protection assay was performed as described previously ( Roulois et al., 2015 50. Roulois, D. ∙ Loo Yau, H. ∙ Singhania, R. ... DNA-Demethylating Agents Target Colorectal Cancer Cells by Inducing Viral Mimicry by Endogenous Transcripts Cell. 2015; 162 :961-973 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (976) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Total RNA from MDA-MB-231 cells (2 × 10 6 ) transfected with control or 2 different FBXO44 siRNAs was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN no. 74134) and 4 μg of total RNA dissolved in 49.5 μL RNase protection buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 350 mM NaCl). Then 0.5 μL RNase A (10 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich no. R6513) was added and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 37°C. dH 2 O was added to the control sample. dsRNA was isolated and denatured at 95°C for 5 min. Reverse transcription was carried out using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quantabio no. 95048) and qPCR reactions performed using primers listed in the “qPCR analyses” section. dsRNA enrichment for selected REs was calculated by (RE/GAPDH) RNase A / (RE/GAPDH) control .
PolyA + RNA was isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module and barcoded libraries made using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). Libraries were pooled and single end sequenced (1 × 75) on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using the High Output V2 Kit (Illumina). Read data was processed in BaseSpace ( https://basespace.illumina.com:443/ ). Reads were then aligned to the Homo sapiens genome (hg19) using STAR aligner ( https://code.google.com/archive/p/rna-star ) with default settings. Differential transcript expression was determined using the Cufflinks Cuffdiff package ( https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/cufflinks ). GSEA was performed on pre-ranked gene lists upon FBXO44 KD using gene set permutation for statistical testing. GSEA results were visualized using Enrichment Map in Cytoscape. For analysis of RE expression from RNA-seq data, reads were mapped to the Homo sapiens genome (hg19) using Bowtie 2 and assigned to REs using RepEnrich2 with the recommended parameters ( https://github.com/nerettilab/RepEnrich2 ) ( Criscione et al., 2014 13. Criscione, S.W. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Thompson, W. ...

For Flag and FBXO44 ChIP experiments, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25°C and reactions stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M for 5 min at 25°C. Cells were rinsed 3x with PBS and re-suspended in ChIP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 μg/mL Aprotinin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin). Specifically, lysates prepared from 10 6 cells in 130 μL lysis buffer were introduced into microsonication tubes (Covaris no. 520045). For H3K9me3 ChIP experiments, native ChIP was performed. Cells were harvested and washed with cold PBS and native chromatin extracted using a commercial chromatin extraction kit (Abcam no. ab117152). For H2AK119ub native ChIP, 1 μL of anti-H2AK119ub antibody (Cell Signaling Technology no. 8240) was used for 10 6 cells. For all ChIP experiments, DNA was fragmented by sonication in a S220 Focused-Ultrasonicator (Covaris) for 7 min (Duty cycle- 5%, Intensity- 4, Cycles/Burst- 200). After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted 1:10 by adding ChIP dilution buffer (Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 μg/mL Aprotinin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin), 5% saved for input, and the remaining lysate pre-cleared for 2 hr with 15 μl protein G agarose before overnight incubation with the indicated antibody. Specifically, for Flag ChIP, 2.5 μL of anti-Flag antibody (Cell Signaling Technology no. 14793) was used for 10 6 cells. For FBXO44 ChIP, 5 μL of anti-FBXO44 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich no. HPA003363) was used for 10 6 cells. For SUV39H1 ChIP, 6 μL of anti-SUV39H1 antibody (Millipore no. 05-615) was used for 10 6 cells. For γH2AX ChIP, 4 μL of anti-γH2AX antibody (Abcam no. 2893) was used for 10 6 cells. For H3K9me3 ChIP, the ChIPAb + Trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys9) kit (Millipore no. 17-10242) was used, typically with 1 μL of anti-H3K9me3 antibody for 10 6 cells. Bound material was recovered after incubation with 15 μL of protein G beads at 4°C. Beads were then washed sequentially with low salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl), high salt buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl), LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 0.25 M LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CH630, 1% Na deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) and TE (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1], 1 mM EDTA). Elution was performed by adding 200 μL of freshly prepared elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO 3 ) to 15 μL protein G beads and rotating the sample for 15 min at 25°C. After centrifugation, the chromatin IP and input were reverse-cross-linked by adding 5M NaCl (4 μL for input and 8 μL for IP sample) and incubated overnight at 65°C, and then DNA extracted using the Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN no. 28704). Primers used included

For ChIP-seq, libraries were made using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). Libraries were pooled and single end sequenced (1 × 75) on an Illumina NextSeq 500 using the High Output V2 kit (Illumina). Read data was processed in BaseSpace ( https://basespace.illumina.com:443/ ). ChIP-seq reads were then aligned to the Homo sapiens genome (hg19) using Bowtie 2 with default parameters, which allows multiple alignment. Peaks were called using Partek software with default parameters. The midpoint of each estimated fragment by Partek and its location on the genome was calculated. The genome was divided into non-overlapping windows of the default 100 bp. An aligned read was considered to be located in a window if the midpoint of its estimated fragment was within the window. The number of midpoints in each window was counted and an empirical distribution of window counts was created. A zero-truncated negative binomial model was fit to the distribution, and a peak was determined based on the FDR (0.001, default) calculated from the model. Overlapping enriched windows were merged into regions and reported. For analysis of REs from ChIP-seq data, a list of FBXO44 peaks associated with REs was created by intersecting FBXO44 binding peaks with RE loci obtained from RepeatMasker, which was used in the downstream analysis. Reads were mapped and assigned to the FBXO44-associated REs using RepEnrich2 with the recommended parameters ( https://github.com/nerettilab/RepEnrich2 ). The resulting counts for REs were analyzed by the edgeR package to obtain CPM values. The H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data in MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from GEO: GSE87169 ( Lee et al., 2016 36. Lee, J.J. ∙ Kim, M. ∙ Kim, H.P. Epigenetic regulation of long noncoding RNA UCA1 by SATB1 in breast cancer BMB Rep. 2016; 49 :578-583 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). The BigWig files were obtained using deeptools bamCoverage command with–normalizeUsing CPM. The heatmap and profile plots for ChIP-seq data were performed by deeptools plotHeatmap and plotProfile in the scale-regions mode. Venn diagrams were obtained using VennDiagram package. The ChIP-seq binding signal from BAM files was visualized in The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).
Equal amounts of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 10 6 ) transfected with control or 2 different FBXO44 siRNAs were harvested and washed with cold PBS. Cytoplasmic fractions were extracted from the cells after the nuclear fraction was removed through centrifugation using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif no. 40010) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cytoplasmic fraction (390 μL solution) was combined with 25 μL 5M NaCl, then treated with 8 μL RNase A/T1 Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. EN0551) for 30 min at 37°C prior to DNA extraction using the Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN no. 28704). The amount of indicated RE DNA in cytosol were determined using qPCR primers in “ ChIP and ChIP-seq ” section and normalized based on gapdh level.
Control or FBXO44 KD MDA-MB-231 cells (4.5 × 10 6 ) were harvested and cytoplasmic fractions extracted using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif no. 40010) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An equal volume of 70% ethanol (350 μL) was added to the cytoplasmic fractions and then RNA isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN no. 74134). The total RNA was dissolved with 38 μL RNase-free H 2 O. Then 2 μL total RNA was used as input and the remainder divided into 2 tubes (18 μL in each). J2 antibody (Scicons no. 10010200) and normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz no. sc-2025) were conjugated (2 μg per pulldown) to 20 μL protein G agarose (Millipore no. 16-266) by rotation for 2 hr at 4°C. To each tube containing total RNA, 1 μL of RNase A (10 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich no. R6513) was added and then mixed with 1 mL IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 125 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by incubation with conjugated protein G agarose beads for 2 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed 3x with IP buffer and incubated in 50 μL proteinase K digestion solution (1x TE, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, and 1 μL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. AM2546)) for 20 min at 45°C. After centrifugation, the eluate (50 μL) was added to 300 μL Buffer RLT Plus from the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN no. 74134) and RNA isolated. The final product containing dsRNA was denatured at 95°C for 5 min, followed by reverse transcription and qPCR reactions using the primers in “ qPCR analyses ” section.
Preparation of cytoplasmic fractions of cultured cells was performed and cytoplasmic DNA extracted using the Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN no. 28704) after incubation with RNase A/T1 Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. EN0551) as detailed in the “Cytoplasmic DNA isolation and qPCR analyses” section. For dsRNA extraction, the cytoplasmic fraction was used for total RNA isolation using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN no. 74134) and total RNA digested with RNase A solution to preserve dsRNA as detailed in the “RNase protection assay” section. The concentrations of cytoplasmic dsRNA and DNA were measured using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the cytoplasmic DNA re-transfection assay, 1 μg cytoplasmic DNA was digested with 1 μL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. EN0521) or 1 μL H 2 O (mock digestion) in 10 μL reaction mixture for 30 min at 37°C prior to re-transfection into MDA-MB-231 cells with 1.5 μL Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfection of 0.8 μg poly (dA:dT) (InvivoGen no. tlrl-patn) was used as a positive control. For cytoplasmic dsRNA re-transfection, 1 μg of dsRNA was digested with 1 μL RNase III (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. AM2290) or 1 μL H 2 O (mock digestion) in 5 μL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37°C prior to re-transfection into MDA-MB-231 cells with 1.5 μL Lipofectamine 2000. Transfection of 0.8 μg poly (I:C) (InvivoGen no. tlrl-pic) was used as positive control. After 72 hr, RNA was isolated and qPCR reactions performed using primers in “ qPCR analysis ” section.
For IF analyses, cells were grown on laminin-coated coverslips (neuVitro no. GG-12-laminin), washed twice with cold PBS, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25°C followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. To detect chromatin associated H3K9me3, cells were fixed with chilled methanol for 5 min at −20°C. After 3 × 10 min washes in PBS, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 120 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% milk, 2% BSA) overnight at 4°C.

Cells were washed 3 × 10 min with KCMT buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.5], 120 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. A-21441) or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled anti-mouse (Cell Signaling Technologies no. 8890) antibodies at 1:500 dilution for 1 hr at 25°C. After 3 × 10 min washes with KCMT buffer, cells were stained with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. D1306), coverslips mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories no. H-1000), and slides examined by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Inverted TE300) or confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 710 NLO). IHC analysis of normal breast and breast carcinoma specimens (Novus Biologicals no. NBP2-30212) were performed by antigen retrieval and blocking endogenous peroxidase activity using the BOND RX automated IHC system (Leica) followed by staining with anti-FBXO44 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich no. HPA003363) at 1:200 dilution. IHC staining was performed using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (Leica no. DS9800) and images scanned using Aperio ScanScope AT2 (Aperio Technologies). FBXO44 staining intensity was quantified using Aperio software. For analysis of mouse lung specimens, lungs were removed and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hr and paraffin embedded. Serial sections cut at 5 μm thickness were stained with hematoxylin (Leica no. 3801560) for 4 min followed by eosin (Leica no. 3801600) for 30 s. Slides were then dehydrated, cleaned, and mounted with Cytoseal 60 mounting media (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. 8310-4). Tissue sections were scanned using Aperio ScanScope AT2. For MDA-MB-231-luc and 4T1 tumors, staining was performed as above using the BOND RX automated IHC system (Leica) with anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology no. 9664; 1:300 dilution), anti-γH2AX (Cell Signaling Technology no. 80312; 1:200 dilution), anti-CD45 (BD no. 550539; 1:50 dilution), anti-CD8a (Thermo Fisher Scientific no. 14-0808-82; 1:50 dilution), and NK Cell Marker (ANK61) (Santa Cruz no. sc-59340; 1:50 dilution) antibodies.
For direct western blotting, chromatin was extracted using a commercial kit (Abcam no. ab117152), sonicated in RIPA buffer, and dissolved in 4x SDS loading buffer. For chromatin fractionation experiments, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.34 M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 μg/mL Aprotinin, 1 μg/mL Leupeptin, 1 μg/mL Pepstatin) and incubated on ice for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 1,300 x g for 5 min. The cytoplasmic supernatant was then collected. The nuclei pellet was washed once in buffer A and lysed in buffer B (3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, with protease/phosphatase inhibitors described above) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min, the nucleoplasmic supernatant was collected. The insoluble chromatin pellet was then washed once with buffer B and centrifuged as described above. The chromatin pellet was then resuspended in RIPA buffer for 20 min at 4°C and sonicated extensively to release chromatin-bound proteins. After centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min, chromatin-associated proteins were collected for electrophoresis.
For analysis of FBXO44 in whole cell extract (WCE), Flag-FBXO44 was introduced into Flp-In TREx-HeLa cells (ThermoFisher Scientific no. R78007) and FBXO44 protein complexes affinity purified. For analysis of FBXO44 in chromatin fractions, MDA-MB-231 (control) or MDA-MB-231-Flag-FBXO44 cells were enriched in S phase by double thymidine block (two sequential 2 mM overnight incubations) and released into normal medium for 3 hr and harvested, washed 2x with cold PBS, and chromatin isolated. Chromatin was dissolved in 2 mL IP buffer and sonicated until the solution cleared. After centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatants were collected and adjusted to 3 mL with IP buffer and pre-cleared by incubation with 10 μL of normal rabbit IgG and 60 μL of protein G agarose beads for 2 hr at 4°C. The supernatants were then incubated with 12.5 μL of anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich no. F7425) overnight at 4°C. After 3 × 10 min washes with IP buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted 3x with 150 μL of Flag peptide elution buffer (Sigma-Aldrich no. FLAGIPT1). Trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich no. T0699) was then added to the eluents to a final concentration of 20% and incubated on ice for 1 hr. After centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 25 min at 4°C, pellets were washed with 500 μl of ice-cold acetone. After another centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 25 min at 4°C, the pellets were air-dried in a fume hood for 30 min and stored at −20°C.

A rapid and efficient method to purify proteins at replication forks under native conditions Biotechniques. 2013; 55 :204-206 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), with modifications. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells (∼8.5 × 10 7 ) were cultured in medium containing 10 μM EdU for 30 min and then harvested or chased with medium containing 10 μM thymidine for 60 min and harvested. Nuclei were isolated by addition of nuclear extraction buffer. Biotin-azide click reactions were performed on a rotator for 1 hr at 4°C, and 50 μL of streptavidin beads (Cell Signaling Technology no. 3419) were used for streptavidin capture for each sample. Beads were washed 3 × 10 min and boiled in 1x SDS gel loading buffer prior to electrophoresis. For aniPOND analysis of FBXO44 binding to H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes, MDA-MB-231-Flag-FBXO44 cells (∼1.7 × 10 8 ) were incubated with 10 μM EdU for 30 min, harvested, subjected to biotin-azide click reactions, and chromatin sonicated prior to IP with IgG or anti-Flag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich no.

For migration assays, 4 × 10 4 MDA-MB-231 cells in 40 μl of medium containing 0.5% FBS were plated into the upper chambers of 24-well inserts with 8 μm pores (Trevigen no. 3484-024-01). Bottom wells contained 360 μL of medium supplemented with 10% PBS. After 24 hr, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 20 min. Non-migrating cells that remained in the upper chamber were gently removed using a cotton swab and cells that migrated to the bottom chambers were stained with 1% crystal violet. Invasion assays were performed using well inserts pre-coated with basement membrane (medium density). For both experiments, cells that migrated to the bottom chambers were quantified by imaging 4 randomly selected fields.
For MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 tumorsphere assays, 2.5 × 10 3 cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were plated into 6-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning no. 3471) containing 500 μL of complete MammoCult Human Medium (STEMCELL Technologies no. 05620). Tumorspheres were counted after 10 days using a light microscope. For GSC tumorsphere assays, 1 × 10 5 cells expressing the indicated shRNAs were plated into regular 6-well plates containing Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 without vitamin A, EGF, bFGF, sodium pyruvate, and GlutaMAX. Tumorspheres were counted 6 days after plating for Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis ( http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/ ). All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Apoptotic cells were detected using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences no. 556547) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were analyzed on an LSR Fortessa instrument (BD PharMingen). For breast CSC quantifications, cells were stained with anti-CD24-APC and anti-CD44-PE antibodies using the Breast Cancer Stem Cell Isolation Kit (MagCellect no. MAGH111).

The pan-cancer gene expression and patient annotation datasets of TCGA were retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) of the National Cancer Institute ( https://gdc.cancer.gov/ ) ( Thorsson et al., 2018 63. Thorsson, V. ∙ Gibbs, D.L. ∙ Brown, S.D. ... The Immune Landscape of Cancer Immunity. 2018; 48 :812-830 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sample-wise gene set activities of different pathways were calculated in GSVA using the “ssGSEA” method, and signature scores of different types of immune cells were calculated in GSVA using the “z-score” method. Spearman correlation and multiple testing corrections were done in R 3.5. GSEA analysis was performed using the GSEA v3.0 desktop application.
The FBXO44-immune gene signature was defined as genes whose expression were upregulated at least 1.5 fold in FBXO44 knockdown RNA-seq, and also belonged to 6 sets of immune response related gene sets enriched in GSEA analysis, including “GO_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE,” “GO_ACTIVATION_OF_INNATE_IMMUNE_RESPONSE,” “GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_DEFENSE_RESPONSE,” “GO_POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_LEUKOCYTE_MIGRATION,” “KEGG_CYTOKINE_CYTOKINE_RECEPTOR_INTERACTION” and “REACTOME_ANTIGEN_PROCESSING_CROSS_PRESENTATION.” The immunotherapy datasets for anti-PD1 therapy and adoptive cell transfer of TILs were analyzed from these studies ( Harel et al., 2019 22.

The processed protein or RNA expression data were retrieved from the publication or Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE91061 and GSE100797). The FBXO44-immune gene signature score was calculated in each dataset using the “z-score” method in GSVA. The difference of signature score between responders and non-responders were tested using unpaired Student’s t test.
The information about statistical details and methods is indicated in the figure legends, text, or methods. Statistical significance tests, including unpaired Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, Spearman correlation test and normality test, were performed using R or Graphpad Prism software, as denoted in each analysis. Data are presented as mean ± SEM for a minimum of three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated. For box-and-whisker plots, the box indicates interquartile range (IQR), the line in the box indicates the median, the whiskers indicate points within Q3+1.53IQR and Q1-1.53IQR and the points beyond whiskers indicate outliers. Q1 and Q3, the first and third quartiles, respectively. All statistical tests were two-tailed. p < 0.05 of the two tail was taken to indicate statistical significance unless otherwise specified.
