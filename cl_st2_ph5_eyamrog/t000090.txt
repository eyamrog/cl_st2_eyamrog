Title: A Prion Epigenetic Switch Establishes an Active Chromatin State


Abstract: Summary

Covalent modifications to histones are essential for development, establishing distinct and functional chromatin domains from a common genetic sequence. Whereas repressed chromatin is robustly inherited, no mechanism that facilitates inheritance of an activated domain has been described. Here, we report that the Set3C histone deacetylase scaffold Snt1 can act as a prion that drives the emergence and transgenerational inheritance of an activated chromatin state. This prion, which we term [ ESI + ] for expressed sub-telomeric information, is triggered by transient Snt1 phosphorylation upon cell cycle arrest. Once engaged, the prion reshapes the activity of Snt1 and the Set3C complex, recruiting RNA pol II and interfering with Rap1 binding to activate genes in otherwise repressed sub-telomeric domains. This transcriptional state confers broad resistance to environmental stress, including antifungal drugs. Altogether, our results establish a robust means by which a prion can facilitate inheritance of an activated chromatin state to provide adaptive benefit.

Section: Introduction

Phenotypic diversification without genetic change is critical for development, cell type specification, and environmental responsiveness. This idea is encapsulated in the concept of epigenetics ( Waddington, 1942 101. Waddington, C.H. The epigenotype Int. J. Epidemiol. 1942; Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar ): patterns of altered gene function that can be passed through cellular divisions in the absence of changes to genetic sequence ( Holliday and Pugh, 1975; Nanney, 1958; Riggs, 1975, 1996 38.

Such epigenetic memory is most closely associated with imprinted DNA methylation ( Calarco et al., 2012; Dickies, 1962; Kazachenka et al., 2018; Padmanabhan et al., 2013; Radford et al., 2012 10.

Of these mechanisms, those governing transmission of repressive histone marks through cellular division are the most completely understood. After DNA replication, modified parental histones are dispersed between daughter strands ( Petryk et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018a 72. Petryk, N. ∙ Dalby, M. ∙ Wenger, A. ... MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication Science. 2018; 361 :1389-1392 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar 111. Yu, C. ∙ Gan, H. ∙ Serra-Cardona, A. ... A mechanism for preventing asymmetric histone segregation onto replicating DNA strands Science. 2018; 361 :1386-1389 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Marks on parental histones are then read and written to neighboring newly deposited histones on both the parent and nascent strand ( Moazed, 2011 64. Moazed, D. Mechanisms for the inheritance of chromatin states Cell. 2011; 146 :510-518 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). This read-write mechanism establishes silent, typically heterochromatic domains that can be stable for dozens of cellular divisions ( Gottschling et al., 1990; Grewal and Klar, 1996 30. Gottschling, D.E. ∙ Aparicio, O.M. ∙ Billington, B.L. ...

Chromosomal inheritance of epigenetic states in fission yeast during mitosis and meiosis Cell. 1996; 86 :95-101 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, inheritance of activated chromatin states has only been achieved by deleting endogenous regulatory elements ( Cavalli and Paro, 1998, 1999 13. Cavalli, G. ∙ Paro, R.

Cavalli, G. ∙ Paro, R. Epigenetic inheritance of active chromatin after removal of the main transactivator Science. 1999; 286 :955-958 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ) or inhibiting silencing effector proteins ( Ekwall et al., 1997; Pillus and Rine, 1989 26. Ekwall, K. ∙ Olsson, T. ∙ Turner, B.M. ... Transient inhibition of histone deacetylation alters the structural and functional imprint at fission yeast centromeres Cell. 1997; 91 :1021-1032 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar 74. Pillus, L. ∙ Rine, J. Epigenetic inheritance of transcriptional states in S. cerevisiae Cell. 1989; 59 :637-647 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (253) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this way, activated states do not appear to be heritable via a read-write mechanism, and for this reason some have argued that they are not bona fide epigenetic states ( Reinberg and Vales, 2018 81. Reinberg, D. ∙ Vales, L.D. Chromatin domains rich in inheritance Science. 2018; 361 :33-34 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is unknown whether an alternative mechanism exists for the inheritance of activated chromatin.
A less well-studied form of epigenetics arises from the self-templating conformations of prion proteins. First described as the cause of infectious spongiform encephalopathies ( Prusiner, 1982 75. Prusiner, S.B. Novel proteinaceous infectious particles cause scrapie Science. 1982; 216 :136-144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), prions and prion-like proteins are now known to play diverse, physiological roles across life ( Fioriti et al., 2015; Halfmann et al., 2012; Krüttner et al., 2012; Majumdar et al., 2012; Stephan et al., 2015; Yuan and Hochschild, 2017 27.

Yuan, A.H. ∙ Hochschild, A. A bacterial global regulator forms a prion Science. 2017; 355 :198-201 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas chromatin-bound information segregates with chromosomes, prion conformers are transmitted independently and are passed through both mitotic and meiotic divisions ( Harvey et al., 2018 35. Harvey, Z.H. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Jarosz, D.F. Protein-based inheritance: epigenetics beyond the chromosome Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :195-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). This property led to the discovery that prions can act as epigenetic elements ( Cox, 1965; Patino et al., 1996; Wickner, 1994; Young and Cox, 1971 20. Cox, B.S. Ψ, A cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppressor in yeast Heredity. 1965; 20 :505-521 Crossref Google Scholar 70. Patino, M.M. ∙ Liu, J.J. ∙ Glover, J.R. ...

Extrachromosomal elements in a super-suppression system of yeast I. A nuclear gene controlling the inheritance of the extrachromosomal elements Heredity. 1971; 26 :413-422 Crossref Google Scholar ). Dozens have since been identified including numerous regulators of chromatin-based epigenetics—histone modifiers and chromatin remodelers—many of which are conserved across Eukarya ( Alberti et al., 2009; Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Halfmann, R. ∙ King, O. ...

Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the extraordinary stability of prion conformational conversion, this enrichment led us to investigate whether the intersection between chromatin and prion biology could stabilize the inheritance of active chromatin states encoded by histone modifications.
Here, we report that one such protein, the Set3C histone deacetylase scaffold Snt1 (NCOR1 in humans), drives a mitotically and meiotically stable protein-based epigenetic element: a prion. We term this prion “[ ESI + ]” for expressed sub-telomeric information, where the brackets and plus sign signify non-Mendelian, cytoplasmic patterns of inheritance and capitals and italics denote dominance in genetic crosses. We identify a mechanism for its regulation, demonstrating that phosphorylation of Snt1 in response to prolonged cell cycle arrest is sufficient for induction. Once engaged, [ ESI + ] pervasively activates transcription of otherwise repressed, sub-telomeric loci, driven by synergism between Set3C’s recruitment of RNA pol II and coincident exclusion of repressor-activator site binding protein (Rap1). Finally, expressed information in [ ESI + ] cells confers resistance to multiple stresses, including antifungal drugs used clinically, providing strong adaptive value. Altogether, our results suggest that prion conformational switching is a robust means by which an active chromatin state can be established and transmitted from one generation to the next, expanding adaptive opportunities.

Section: Results

Because they are driven by heritable changes in protein conformation rather than genetic sequence, prion-driven traits do not follow the rules of Mendelian genetics. Pioneering studies in yeast have established defining characteristics of fungal prions ( Wickner et al., 2006 106. Wickner, R.B. ∙ Edskes, H.K. ∙ Shewmaker, F. How to find a prion: [URE3], [PSI+] and [beta] Methods. 2006; 39 :3-8 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ): (feature 1) overexpression of the causal protein increases the frequency of prion acquisition; (feature 2) traits driven by the prion can be eliminated by transient perturbation of molecular chaperones; (feature 3) they have non-Mendelian inheritance patterns, (feature 4) can be transmitted via cytoplasm alone, and (feature 5) require continuous presence of the causal protein. In addition to these genetic features, there are a number of biochemical characteristics: (feature 6) an altered conformation of the protein in [ PRION + ] cells ( Edskes et al., 1999; Patino et al., 1996 25. Edskes, H.K. ∙ Gray, V.T. ∙ Wickner, R.B. The [URE3] prion is an aggregated form of Ure2p that can be cured by overexpression of Ure2p fragments Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :1498-1503 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Patino, M.M. ∙ Liu, J.J. ∙ Glover, J.R. ... Support for the prion hypothesis for inheritance of a phenotypic trait in yeast Science. 1996; 273 :622-626 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and (feature 7) the capacity of this altered conformation to template natively folded protein of the same type ( Glover et al., 1997 29. Glover, J.R. ∙ Kowal, A.S. ∙ Schirmer, E.C. ... Self-seeded fibers formed by Sup35, the protein determinant of [PSI + ], a heritable prion-like factor of S. cerevisiae Cell. 1997; 89 :811-819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, the strongest “sufficiency test” for a prion is (feature 8) transformation of naive cells with aggregates generated from heterologously expressed and purified protein ( Tanaka et al., 2004; Tanaka and Weissman, 2006 91. Tanaka, M. ∙ Weissman, J.S. An efficient protein transformation protocol for introducing prions into yeast Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412 :185-200 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 92. Tanaka, M. ∙ Chien, P. ∙ Naber, N. ... Conformational variations in an infectious protein determine prion strain differences Nature. 2004; 428 :323-328 Crossref Scopus (617) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We previously found that transient overexpression of SNT1 , a subunit of the Set3C histone deacetylase complex, created a zinc-resistance trait stable over many hundreds of mitotic divisions (feature 1), but could be eliminated by transient chaperone inhibition (feature 2) ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 15. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Byers, J.S. ∙ Jones, S. ... Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Still, this phenotype (known as [ ESI + ]) differed somewhat from archetypal fungal prions. Snt1 does not harbor Q/N-rich domains often found in amyloid prions ( Figure S1 A). Consistent with this, propagation of the state depended on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 15. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Byers, J.S. ∙ Jones, S. ... Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), rather than Hsp70 or Hsp104, and Snt1 did not form visible amyloid fibers ( Figure S1 B).
To investigate whether [ ESI + ] is a prion, we examined its genetic behavior. First, we tested whether the zinc-resistance trait was non-Mendelian. We crossed isogenic naive and [ ESI + ] parents to naive mating partners, induced meiosis, isolated haploid progeny, and scored their zinc resistance. All meiotic progeny inherited zinc resistance (feature 3) ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 C), in contrast to the expectation of exactly 50% for a genetic mutant (p < 0.008 by binomial test). We next asked whether this trait was transmissible through cytoplasm alone by using a karyogamy-deficient kar1-1 mutant that prevents nuclear fusion after mating ( Conde and Fink, 1976; Wickner et al., 2006 19. Conde, J. ∙ Fink, G.R. A mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective for nuclear fusion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1976; 73 :3651-3655 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 106. Wickner, R.B. ∙ Edskes, H.K. ∙ Shewmaker, F. How to find a prion: [URE3], [PSI+] and [beta] Methods. 2006; 39 :3-8 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed a series of genetic crosses, introducing [ ESI + ] to kar1-1 cells ( Figure S1 D), and then selected buds from these heterokaryons that had wild-type nuclei, but mixed cytoplasm. All “cytoductants” that received [ ESI + ] cytoplasm acquired zinc resistance ( Figure S1 E), but control recipients that received naive cytoplasm did not (feature 4). Finally, we tested whether the conformation of Snt1 was altered in [ ESI + ] cells. Because of its low abundance (200–400 molecules per cell), we performed limited proteolysis on immunoprecipitated Snt1 from naive and [ ESI + ] cells as a fiducial for conformational change. Whereas Snt1 from naive cells was almost entirely degraded by proteinase K over the course of an hour, we observed minimal degradation of Snt1 from [ ESI + ] cells (feature 6) ( Figures 1 C and S1 F). We also extended this assay by seeding naive lysates with small amounts of [ ESI + ] lysate in vitro ( Figure 1 D). In these experiments, the proteolysis kinetics of the seeded myc-tagged Snt1 became nearly identical to [ ESI + ] type strains ( Figure 1 E). Thus, the conformational change could be templated to a natively folded protein (feature 7). Collectively, these data establish that [ ESI + ] has many genetic and biochemical hallmarks of prion biology.
The strongest evidence for prion-based inheritance is transformation. We thus examined whether Snt1 expressed in E. coli and aggregated in vitro could transform naive cells to become [ ESI + ]. We expressed Snt1 as a recombinant His-tagged fusion protein and then lysed the bacteria, digested all nucleic acids, and isolated Snt1 by using nickel affinity chromatography. Snt1 eluted over an increasing gradient of imidazole and, after elution, proceeded to form visible aggregates within 1–2 h ( Figure 1 F). After washes with 4M guanidine hydrochloride, Snt1 remained aggregated ( Figure 1 G).
Next, we asked whether these Snt1 aggregates could convert naive yeast to [ ESI + ]. We prepared naive cells for transformation by spheroplasting and then introduced either Snt1 aggregates or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a control ( Figure 1 H). Co-transformation with a LEU2 carrier plasmid identified the small number of cells that uptook extracellular material. We plated transformations to single colonies on selective medium and passaged colonies for >100 generations to dilute the original Snt1 aggregates. We then tested whether these colonies acquired [ ESI + ]-associated zinc resistance. Many did (9 of 48, or ~19% from Snt1 aggregate transformations; feature 8) ( Figure 1 I). No such behavior emerged in control colonies that were transformed with BSA ( Figure 1 I).
We next investigated whether these protein transformants had other defining features of [ ESI + ]. First, we repeated Snt1 aggregate transformations in an snt1 Δ recipient strain. We observed no zinc resistance, suggesting that constant presence of Snt1 is needed for propagation of [ ESI + ] (feature 5) ( Figure S1 G). Second, we asked whether the zinc resistance of wild-type Snt1 aggregate transformants could be eliminated by transient Hsp90 inhibition; it can in [ ESI + ] type strains ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 15. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Byers, J.S. ∙ Jones, S. ... Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). We passaged zinc-resistant protein transformants on media containing a low dose of radicicol, a selective inhibitor of Hsp90 ( Jarosz and Lindquist, 2010 43. Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Lindquist, S. Hsp90 and environmental stress transform the adaptive value of natural genetic variation Science. 2010; 330 :1820-1824 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then restored Hsp90 function by passaging these cells in rich medium without the drug. This regimen eliminated zinc resistance of Snt1 protein transformants ( Figure 1 J), just as it did in [ ESI + ] cells. Our observations establish that [ ESI + ] fulfills all defining features of prion proteins: it is both proteinaceous and infectious—a mitotically and meiotically heritable epigenetic state linked to an altered, self-templating conformation of Snt1.
An argument for the adaptive value of prions is their ability to switch in response to environmental stimuli ( Lancaster and Masel, 2009 55. Lancaster, A.K. ∙ Masel, J. The evolution of reversible switches in the presence of irreversible mimics Evolution. 2009; 63 :2350-2362 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, aside from indirect stress-dependent changes in chaperone activity ( Tyedmers et al., 2008 97. Tyedmers, J. ∙ Madariaga, M.L. ∙ Lindquist, S. Prion switching in response to environmental stress PLoS Biol. 2008; 6 :e294 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ), the molecular mechanisms regulating switching remain largely unclear. Like many prion proteins, Snt1 harbors extensive predicted, intrinsically disordered regions in addition to its eponymous well-folded Swi3, Ada2, N-Cor, and TFIIIB (SANT) domains and a domain of unknown function ( Figure 2 A). Phosphorylation of disordered proteins can induce large conformational shifts ( Bah et al., 2015 4. Bah, A. ∙ Vernon, R.M. ∙ Siddiqui, Z. ... Folding of an intrinsically disordered protein by phosphorylation as a regulatory switch Nature. 2015; 519 :106-109 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Snt1 harbors numerous phosphorylation sites within its putative disordered regions ( Figure 2 A), leading us to investigate whether phosphorylation could influence [ ESI + ].
We took advantage of prior observations that prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest via nocodazole induces Snt1 phosphorylation by Cdc28 (CDK1 in humans) ( Holt et al., 2009 40. Holt, L.J. ∙ Tuch, B.B. ∙ Villén, J. ... Global analysis of Cdk1 substrate phosphorylation sites provides insights into evolution Science. 2009; 325 :1682-1686 Crossref Scopus (560) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed this finding by phospho-protein-impeding gel electrophoresis (“phostag”) and immunoblot ( Figure 2 B). After releasing nocodazole-treated cells and passaging them for another ~100 generations in the absence of drug, we noted frequent emergence of stable zinc resistance ( Figure 2 C). No such behavior occurred in untreated controls. To estimate the frequency of induction, we repeated this experiment, introducing single-cell bottlenecks by plating to individual colonies. The majority of these colonies (> 50%) acquired stable zinc resistance ( Figure S2 A). To rule out general effects of cell cycle perturbation, we arrested naive cells in S-phase with hydroxyurea. This treatment affected neither Snt1 phosphorylation nor zinc resistance ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Thus, phosphorylation of Snt1 driven by prolonged G2/M arrest is linked to the emergence of a stable zinc resistance phenotype.
We next asked whether this phenotype was due to [ ESI + ]. First, we repeated the nocodazole induction in snt1 Δ cells, and observed no increase in zinc resistance ( Figure 2 C), establishing dependence on Snt1. Second, we subjected immunoprecipitated Snt1 derived from single-colony nocodazole-induced isolates to proteolysis ( Figure S2 A). Among zinc-resistant colonies, we commonly observed delayed Snt1 degradation, closely matching [ ESI + ] type strains ( Figure 2 D). Thus, nocodazole arrest can induce an altered, heritable Snt1 conformation resembling [ ESI + ]. We did not, however, observe Snt1 phosphorylation in [ ESI + ]-type strains ( Figure S2 B), suggesting that the modification is not needed to maintain the prion.
As a final test of whether Snt1 phosphorylation could trigger [ ESI + ], we generated single phosphomimetic (S/T→D) variants at annotated phosphorylation sites within Snt1. We episomally expressed the mutant proteins for ~25 generations, eliminated the expression vector by counterselection, and propagated them for another ~25 generations ( Figure 2 E). This propagation diluted the cytoplasm by ~10 7 -fold, minimizing the potential effect of any remaining phosphomimic protein. Transient ancestral exposure to very low amounts of wild-type Snt1 or an empty vector control did not induce [ ESI + ] and neither did a phosphomimetic mutation (S481D) at the sole site within Snt1’s ordered domain ( Figure 2 F). In contrast, transient ancestral expression of phosphomimetic variants at multiple sites within Snt1’s disordered regions gave rise to heritable zinc resistance ( Figure 2 F). Induction of the trait was not due to differences in Snt1 abundance, as the variants were expressed similarly ( Figure S2 C). Although other physiological circumstances might also promote [ ESI + ] induction, our results suggest that Snt1 phosphorylation linked to G2/M spindle checkpoint arrest by nocodazole can trigger the prion.
In addition to Snt1, Set3C is composed of Set3 (a catalytically inactive SET-domain containing protein) and Hos2 (a class I histone deacetylase), which represses genes primarily via H4 deacetylation ( Kim and Buratowski, 2009; Kim et al., 2012 49. Kim, T. ∙ Buratowski, S.

Kim, T. ∙ Xu, Z. ∙ Clauder-Münster, S. ... Set3 HDAC mediates effects of overlapping noncoding transcription on gene induction kinetics Cell. 2012; 150 :1158-1169 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ) or activates them through RNA pol II recruitment ( Wang et al., 2002 103. Wang, A. ∙ Kurdistani, S.K. ∙ Grunstein, M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast Science. 2002; 298 :1412-1414 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first investigated global changes to histone acetylation in [ ESI + ] cells, observing markedly higher pan-acetyl-histone-H4 (H4ac) and modestly elevated pan-acetyl-histone-H3 (H3ac) signal (3.1-fold H4ac, 1.9-fold H3ac, p < 0.01 for both) compared with those in naive cells ( Figure S3 A). To investigate the consequences, we performed messenger RNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) with spike-in controls, providing a linear range spanning more than five orders of magnitude and found no systematic biases between naive and [ ESI + ] cells ( Figure S3 B). Consistent with increased histone acetylation, we observed increases in the abundance of ~1,000 transcripts in [ ESI + ] cells (~15% of open reading frames [ORFs]) ( Figure 3 A). Notably, this included many metal-stress-response genes (e.g., YCF1 , SVF1 , HAL9 , and FRE1 ), providing a logical explanation for zinc resistance in [ ESI + ] cells.
To investigate the mechanism underlying this large change in expression, we compared the transcription in [ ESI + ] to loss of Set3C function (Set3CΔ; snt1 Δ, set3 Δ, and hos2 Δ). There was extensive overlap between all three Set3C deletion strains and [ ESI + ] ( Figure S3 C), confirming that they are functionally linked. However, as has been seen for other prions ( Malovichko et al., 2019 62. Malovichko, Y.V. ∙ Antonets, K.S. ∙ Maslova, A.R. ... RNA sequencing reveals specific transcriptomic signatures distinguishing effects of the [ SWI + ] prion and SWI1 deletion in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genes (Basel). 2019; 10 :212 Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar ), the majority of the transcriptional changes were not explained by deletion of constituent proteins. Indeed, the transcriptional changes in Set3CΔ were more modest than those in [ ESI + ] cells, and 62, 204, and 360 transcripts were upregulated in snt1 Δ, set3 Δ, and hos2 Δ, respectively ( Figures 3 B–3D). Thus, changes in gene expression in [ ESI + ] cannot be explained by simple loss of Set3C repressive function.
Because Set3C has also previously been implicated in gene activation, we investigated whether transcript upregulation in [ ESI + ] cells was due to activation by Snt1 and Set3C. Set3C is most closely associated with H4 acetylation ( Kim and Buratowski, 2009 49. Kim, T. ∙ Buratowski, S. Dimethylation of H3K4 by Set1 recruits the Set3 histone deacetylase complex to 5′ transcribed regions Cell. 2009; 137 :259-272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recruits RNAPII to activate genes ( Wang et al., 2002 103. Wang, A. ∙ Kurdistani, S.K. ∙ Grunstein, M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast Science. 2002; 298 :1412-1414 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H4ac, RNAPII, and Snt1, examining the results at the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes upregulated in [ ESI + ] cells. Consistent with Set3C-driven gene activation, increased transcript abundance was directly linked to elevated RNAPII and H4ac at TSSs ( Figure 3 E). This was not because of a loss of Snt1 binding; we observed slightly increased Snt1 binding surrounding the +1 nucleosome of [ ESI + ] upregulated TSSs ( Figure 3 E). Further, activation was coincident with an apparent loss of deacetylase activity, as measured by elevated H4ac ( Figure 3 E). This likely explains why the [ ESI + ] gene expression profile is most similar to hos2 Δ ( Figure S3 C), the principle histone deacetylase of Set3C.
Beyond simple gene regulation, Set3C functions in silencing antisense and alternative transcripts ( Kim et al., 2012 50. Kim, T. ∙ Xu, Z. ∙ Clauder-Münster, S. ... Set3 HDAC mediates effects of overlapping noncoding transcription on gene induction kinetics Cell. 2012; 150 :1158-1169 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as repressing meiotic transcripts ( Pijnappel et al., 2001 73. Pijnappel, W.W. ∙ Schaft, D. ∙ Roguev, A. ... The S. cerevisiae SET3 complex includes two histone deacetylases, Hos2 and Hst1, and is a meiotic-specific repressor of the sporulation gene program Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2991-3004 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also investigated whether [ ESI + ] influenced these functions. Indeed, we observed RNAPII and H4ac at the transcription end site (TES) of upregulated ORFs ( Figures S3 D and S3E) or apparently alternative TSSs ( Figures 3 E and S3 F) in [ ESI + ] cells. [ ESI + ] upregulated genes were likewise enriched for factors involved in meiosis (e.g., IME1 and SPO11 ; p < 10 −29 , Fisher’s exact test). These gene expression changes had a clear functional consequence: [ ESI + ] cells sporulated more efficiently than genetically identical naive cells ( Figure S3 G). Together with our other genomic observations, these data establish that transcriptional upregulation in [ ESI + ] cells is linked to gene activation by Snt1 and Set3C.
Although many genes differentially expressed in [ ESI + ] cells were logically linked to known Set3C functions, hundreds of others were not. We searched for shared features that might suggest an explanation. Notably, transcripts upregulated by [ ESI + ] were ~10-fold less abundant in naive cells than the transcriptome-wide average (p < 10 −4 , Mann-Whitney test) and the degree of upregulation was anticorrelated with abundance in naive cells (ρ ≈−0.641) ( Figure 4 A). Further, we noticed that many of transcripts were located within the large (~50 kb), repressive, Hda1-affected sub-telomeric (HAST) domains ( Robyr et al., 2002 84. Robyr, D. ∙ Suka, Y. ∙ Xenarios, I. ... Microarray deacetylation maps determine genome-wide functions for yeast histone deacetylases Cell. 2002; 109 :437-446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) (p < 10 −16 , KS test) ( Figure 4 B). Consistent with [ ESI + ]-dependent activation being a gain of function, Set3C deletion mutants did not show the same enrichment ( Figure 4 B).
These domains are very weakly expressed and thus susceptible to technical variation. We thus performed a phenotypic assay for sub-telomeric repression ( Gottschling et al., 1990 30. Gottschling, D.E. ∙ Aparicio, O.M. ∙ Billington, B.L. ... Position effect at S. cerevisiae telomeres: reversible repression of Pol II transcription Cell. 1990; 63 :751-762 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1080) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this assay, a URA3 selectable marker is integrated in a sub-telomeric domain subject to position effect variegation. Thus, with weaker the repression of sub-telomeres, a greater fraction of cells can grow on medium lacking uracil. [ ESI + ] cells had a nearly 2-fold increase in the fraction of Ura + colonies ( Figure 4 C), confirming that the prion activates otherwise repressed, sub-telomeric domains.
We next investigated whether de-repression of sub-telomeres was directly linked to changes in histone acetylation and RNAPII binding, examining the distribution of increased H4ac and RNAPII in [ ESI + ] cells. Mirroring our gene-level analyses, sub-telomeric de-repression was linked to both increased H4ac (p = 0.01097, Cuzick’s Test) ( Figure 4 D) and elevated RNAPII recruitment (p = 6.34 × 10 −7 , Cuzick’s Test) ( Figure 4 E), consistent with pervasive activation in the region via Set3C-dependent RNAPII recruitment ( Kim et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2002 50. Kim, T. ∙ Xu, Z. ∙ Clauder-Münster, S. ... Set3 HDAC mediates effects of overlapping noncoding transcription on gene induction kinetics Cell. 2012; 150 :1158-1169 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar 103. Wang, A. ∙ Kurdistani, S.K. ∙ Grunstein, M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast Science. 2002; 298 :1412-1414 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, in keeping with Set3C’s preference for H4, we did not observe the same biased distribution for H3ac (p = 0.15, Cuzick’s Test) ( Figure 4 F). Thus, [ ESI + ] pervasively activates the expression of sub-telomeric genes.
Sub-telomeres in S. cerevisiae also harbor two specialized loci of heterochromatin that are more tightly silenced ( Bühler and Gasser, 2009; Loo and Rine, 1994 9. Bühler, M. ∙ Gasser, S.M. Silent chromatin at the middle and ends: lessons from yeasts EMBO J. 2009; 28 :2149-2161 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Loo, S. ∙ Rine, J. Silencers and domains of generalized repression Science. 1994; 264 :1768-1771 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ): the homothallic mating loci HML α and HMR a. These loci contain additional copies of yeast mating type information and are located ~10 and 25 kb from the chromosome end, respectively. Sub-telomeres are silenced by coordination of the silent information regulator (SIR) complex directly adjacent to telomeric repeats (~4 kb from chromosome ends) ( Bühler and Gasser, 2009; Strahl-Bolsinger et al., 1997; Thurtle and Rine, 2014 9. Bühler, M. ∙ Gasser, S.M. Silent chromatin at the middle and ends: lessons from yeasts EMBO J. 2009; 28 :2149-2161 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Strahl-Bolsinger, S. ∙ Hecht, A. ∙ Luo, K. ... SIR2 and SIR4 interactions differ in core and extended telomeric heterochromatin in yeast Genes Dev. 1997; 11 :83-93 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 94. Thurtle, D.M. ∙ Rine, J. The molecular topography of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :245-258 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) within the larger HAST domains ( Robyr et al., 2002 84. Robyr, D. ∙ Suka, Y. ∙ Xenarios, I. ... Microarray deacetylation maps determine genome-wide functions for yeast histone deacetylases Cell. 2002; 109 :437-446 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the homothallic mating loci, an additional layer of silencing is achieved through sequence-dependent recruitment of SIR to silencer elements ( Loo and Rine, 1994 59. Loo, S. ∙ Rine, J. Silencers and domains of generalized repression Science. 1994; 264 :1768-1771 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given that HML α and HMR a fall within the HAST domain where we observed activation by [ ESI + ], we wondered whether they might also be activated. In [ ESI + ] cells, we observed increased transcript abundance via mRNA-seq for both HML α and HMR a ( Figure 5 A), and this was also driven by Set3C-dependent gene activation ( Figure S4 A). As an orthogonal measure, we examined HML α silencing in [ ESI + ] cells by using a sensitive reporter ( Dodson and Rine, 2015 22. Dodson, A.E. ∙ Rine, J. Heritable capture of heterochromatin dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae eLife. 2015; 4 :e05007 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) where Cre is placed within the tightly silenced HML α. Its transient expression converts a lox-flanked reporter locus from red fluorescent protein (RFP) to green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression ( Figure 5 B), producing stable GFP + colony sectors. In this assay, [ ESI + ] colonies exhibited increased sectoring (p < 0.02) ( Figures 5 C and 5D), albeit weaker in magnitude than loss of SIR (e.g., sir1 Δ and sir2 Δ) ( Figures 5 C and 5D), suggesting that activation of this locus might be SIR independent. As an additional test, we used an established reporter ( Huang et al., 2006 41. Huang, J. ∙ Brito, I.L. ∙ Villén, J. ... Inhibition of homologous recombination by a cohesin-associated clamp complex recruited to the rDNA recombination enhancer Genes Dev. 2006; 20 :2887-2901 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) to examine expression of the ribosomal DNA locus, which is silenced exclusively by Sir2 ( Guarente, 2000 32. Guarente, L. Sir2 links chromatin silencing, metabolism, and aging Genes Dev. 2000; 14 :1021-1026 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with an SIR-independent mechanism, we observed no difference in the silencing of the rDNA locus in [ ESI + ] cells ( Figure S4 B).
A hallmark of de-repressed heterochromatin in budding yeast is decreased mating efficiency due to expression of inappropriate mating pheromones. Consistent with partial loss of HMLα and HMRaR silencing, [ ESI + ] cells mated less efficiently than naive (~2-fold) ( Figure 5 E). Curing [ ESI + ] by transient Hsp90 inhibition restored normal mating efficiency ( Figure 5 E). [ ESI + ] thus reduces heterochromatic repression at the homothallic mating loci and sub-telomeres alike, leading to a partial loss of mating independently of SIR.
Given Set3C’s role in gene activation ( Wang et al., 2002 103. Wang, A. ∙ Kurdistani, S.K. ∙ Grunstein, M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast Science. 2002; 298 :1412-1414 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested whether localization of Set3C components to sub-telomeres could explain enrichment for [ ESI + ]’s activation of them. In naive cells, Snt1 and the Set3C catalytic subunit Hos2 weakly bound sub-telomeres ( Figures 6 A–6C and S5 A–S5D), consistent with reports that Set3C indirectly affects sub-telomeric loci ( Kim and Buratowski, 2009; Pijnappel et al., 2001 49. Kim, T. ∙ Buratowski, S. Dimethylation of H3K4 by Set1 recruits the Set3 histone deacetylase complex to 5′ transcribed regions Cell. 2009; 137 :259-272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Pijnappel, W.W. ∙ Schaft, D. ∙ Roguev, A. ... The S. cerevisiae SET3 complex includes two histone deacetylases, Hos2 and Hst1, and is a meiotic-specific repressor of the sporulation gene program Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2991-3004 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, in [ ESI + ] cells, sub-telomeric binding of both Snt1 and Hos2 increased substantially ( Figures 6 A–6C). This coincided with increased H4ac and RNAPII occupancy ( Figure 6 A). Thus, [ ESI + ] coordinates Set3C subunits to activate gene expression. Enhanced binding was not due to increased expression of Set3C components; neither Snt1 nor Hos2 were differentially expressed in [ ESI + ] cells (adjusted p value [p adj ] > 0.2 and 0.8, respectively).
However, increased Set3C binding was not restricted to sub-telomeric HAST domains ( Figures S5 A–S5D), but instead occurred genome-wide. We thus searched for potential interactions that could explain the sub-telomeric enrichment among genes activated by [ ESI + ]. We focused on Rap1 for several reasons. First, synthetic lethal genetic interactions have been reported between RAP1 and both SNT1 and HOS2 ( Usaj et al., 2017 98. Usaj, M. ∙ Tan, Y. ∙ Wang, W. ... TheCellMap.org: a web-accessible database for visualizing and mining the global yeast genetic interaction network G3 (Bethesda). 2017; 7 :1539-1549 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, Rap1, which is conserved from yeast to mammals, has numerous context-dependent roles in activating and repressing transcription that mirror the specificity of [ ESI + ] ( Shore, 1994; Shore and Nasmyth, 1987 86. Shore, D. RAP1: a protean regulator in yeast Trends Genet. 1994; 10 :408-412 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar 87. Shore, D. ∙ Nasmyth, K. Purification and cloning of a DNA binding protein from yeast that binds to both silencer and activator elements Cell. 1987; 51 :721-732 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ): it contributes to silencing sub-telomeres and HML α/ HMR a by supplementing Sir1-dependent recruitment of SIR, but has no effect on repression of the heterochromatic ribosomal DNA array ( Kennedy et al., 1994 48. Kennedy, B.K. ∙ Austriaco, Jr., N.R. ∙ Guarente, L. Daughter cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from old mothers display a reduced life span J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127 :1985-1993 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, transcripts upregulated upon Rap1 depletion ( Candelli et al., 2018; Kubik et al., 2015 11. Candelli, T. ∙ Challal, D. ∙ Briand, J.B. ... High-resolution transcription maps reveal the widespread impact of roadblock termination in yeast EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e97490 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Kubik, S. ∙ Bruzzone, M.J. ∙ Jacquet, P. ... Nucleosome stability distinguishes two different promoter types at all protein-coding genes in yeast Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :422-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) overlap significantly with those upregulated in [ ESI + ] cells (24% of upregulated transcripts, p < 0.00015, hypergeometric test). Finally, even though Rap1 has activating and repressing functions genome-wide, Rap1 depletion leads to concentrated upregulation in sub-telomeres in a ~50 kb domain adjacent to chromosome ends, just as we observed in [ ESI + ] cells ( Figure S5 E).
To investigate the potential relationship between Rap1 and [ ESI + ], we performed ChIP-seq against Rap1. In naive cells, Rap1 pervasively bound both telomeric repeats and sub-telomeres ( Figures 6 A and 6D), consistent with its role in controlling transcription in the region. In [ ESI + ] cells, by contrast, Rap1 binding strongly decreased in the sub-telomeric regions where we observed gene activation and increased Set3C binding ( Figures 6 A and 6D). However, its essential function in binding to telomeric repeats was unaffected ( Figures 6 A and S5 E–S5I). This implies that [ ESI + ] separates the function of these two binding contexts, preserving Rap1’s essential role in maintaining genome stability ( Palladino et al., 1993; Shore, 1994 68. Palladino, F. ∙ Laroche, T. ∙ Gilson, E. ... SIR3 and SIR4 proteins are required for the positioning and integrity of yeast telomeres Cell. 1993; 75 :543-555 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar 86. Shore, D. RAP1: a protean regulator in yeast Trends Genet. 1994; 10 :408-412 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Rap1’s activation functions throughout the genome were also reduced by [ ESI + ]. Transcripts downregulated in Rap1 hypomorphs overlapped strongly with those in [ ESI + ] cells (60.6%, p < 10 −90 , hypergeometric test). In genes that are Rap1-activated via upstream activating sequences (UASs) ( Brindle et al., 1990; Shore and Nasmyth, 1987 7. Brindle, P.K. ∙ Holland, J.P. ∙ Willett, C.E. ... Multiple factors bind the upstream activation sites of the yeast enolase genes ENO1 and ENO2: ABFI protein, like repressor activator protein RAP1, binds cis-acting sequences which modulate repression or activation of transcription Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10 :4872-4885 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 87. Shore, D. ∙ Nasmyth, K. Purification and cloning of a DNA binding protein from yeast that binds to both silencer and activator elements Cell. 1987; 51 :721-732 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (406) PubMed Google Scholar ), binding was lost in [ ESI + ] cells, and expression of the downstream ORFs was reduced ( Figure S5 J–S5L). Importantly, RAP1 was not differentially expressed in [ ESI + ] cells (log 2 fold change = 0.79, p adj = 0.067). Further, de-repression is highly unlikely to be linked to loss of SIR, as the domain of de-repression and loss of Rap1 binding extended far beyond SIR bound domains (~25 kb versus ~4 kb from chromosome ends for SIR) ( Strahl-Bolsinger et al., 1997; Thurtle and Rine, 2014 90. Strahl-Bolsinger, S. ∙ Hecht, A. ∙ Luo, K. ... SIR2 and SIR4 interactions differ in core and extended telomeric heterochromatin in yeast Genes Dev. 1997; 11 :83-93 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 94. Thurtle, D.M. ∙ Rine, J. The molecular topography of silenced chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genes Dev. 2014; 28 :245-258 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). These data support a model where Set3C’s increased binding to chromatin interferes with Rap1 binding and transcriptional function.
We next investigated epistatic interactions between Rap1 and the prion. Although Rap1 overexpression was toxic, we were able to reduce Rap1 amounts by using two approaches. First, we used an inducible Rap1 “Anchor Away” hypomorph ( Kubik et al., 2015 52. Kubik, S. ∙ Bruzzone, M.J. ∙ Jacquet, P. ... Nucleosome stability distinguishes two different promoter types at all protein-coding genes in yeast Mol. Cell. 2015; 60 :422-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). With normal amounts of Rap1, [ ESI + ] cells grew much better than naive controls in the presence of zinc ( Figure 6 E). By contrast, when we mildly reduced Rap1 amounts, we saw that naive cells phenocopied [ ESI + ] and also grew well in zinc ( Figure 6 E). When we performed the same perturbation in [ ESI + ] cells, their growth in zinc was unaffected ( Figure 6 E), suggesting that Rap1 was already inhibited in them. As an orthogonal measure, we performed an analogous experiment by using CRISPRi, selecting a guide that reduced Rap1 amounts ( Figure S5 M) but did not significantly affect growth. The outcome was essentially identical; reduction of Rap1 amounts phenocopied [ ESI + ] ( Figure S5 N). Altogether, our data suggest that Set3C interferes with Rap1 binding in [ ESI + ] cells.
Finally, we wondered whether [ ESI + ] might confer an adaptive advantage. The sub-telomeres are one of the most rapidly evolving and genetically diverse regions of the S. cerevisiae genome ( Peter et al., 2018 71. Peter, J. ∙ De Chiara, M. ∙ Friedrich, A. ... Genome evolution across 1,011 Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates Nature. 2018; 556 :339-344 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), harboring numerous stress response elements ( Brown et al., 2010 8. Brown, C.A. ∙ Murray, A.W. ∙ Verstrepen, K.J. Rapid expansion and functional divergence of subtelomeric gene families in yeasts Curr. Biol. 2010; 20 :895-903 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our mRNA-seq dataset included a number of differentially expressed genes that have been associated with resistance to multiple stresses, including antifungal drugs used clinically ( Hoepfner et al., 2014; Vandenbosch et al., 2013 36. Hoepfner, D. ∙ Helliwell, S.B. ∙ Sadlish, H. ... High-resolution chemical dissection of a model eukaryote reveals targets, pathways and gene functions Microbiol.

Genomewide screening for genes involved in biofilm formation and miconazole susceptibility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae FEMS Yeast Res. 2013; 13 :720-730 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ) and natural products such as rapamycin ( Hoke et al., 2008; Parsons et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2005 37. Hoke, S.M. ∙ Guzzo, J. ∙ Andrews, B. ...

USA. 2005; 102 :7215-7220 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We examined the response of [ ESI + ] cells to these conditions. [ ESI + ] cells grew robustly relative to their isogenic naive counterparts in multiple stressors, including first-line triazole antifungals (fluconazole and clotrimazole) ( Figures 7 A–7C) and rapamycin ( Figure 7 D). Two lines of evidence suggest that these phenotypes are directly linked to [ ESI + ]. First, resistance to fluconazole was cured by transient Hsp90 inhibition ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Second, many Snt1 aggregate transformants were also resistant to fluconazole ( Figure 7 E). [ ESI + ]-associated resistance to these pharmacological agents are unlikely to be explained by simple upregulation of ERG11 , the target of azole drugs, or TOR1 , the target of rapamycin (neither were substantially upregulated in [ ESI + ] cells; log 2 fold change 0.33 and 0.66; p adj > 0.75 and 0.03, respectively). Rather, our data suggest that resistance is likely derived from the large number of stress-responsive genes located in sub-telomeric domains and upregulated by [ ESI + ] (e.g., YMR326C , YNL324W , YOR345C , YOR379C, YOL152W , YOR351C , YAL067C , and YCL074W ). Regardless, these data demonstrate that the heritably altered gene expression of [ ESI + ] cells gives rise to multiple adaptive traits.

Section: Discussion

Our results establish that a protein-based epigenetic element—the [ ESI + ] prion—can act to drive the transgenerational inheritance of an activated chromatin state ( Figure 7 F). Whereas in naive cells Set3C has a mix of activating and repressing functions, in the prion state it pervasively binds the genome, activating otherwise repressed sub-telomeric genes via interference with Rap1 function and RNA pol II recruitment. Expression of these otherwise repressed domains reveals expression of transcripts that drives a transcriptional program that is often adaptive, fueling resistance to antifungal drugs and other stressors.
Establishment of distinct functional domains of chromatin is essential for development, cell type specification, and response to environmental inputs. Whereas silent heterochromatin can be transmitted across cellular division, it has been argued that activated chromatin states cannot ( Reinberg and Vales, 2018 81. Reinberg, D. ∙ Vales, L.D. Chromatin domains rich in inheritance Science. 2018; 361 :33-34 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). The crux of this argument is that, unlike canonical silent histone marks (e.g., H3K9me2/H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), active marks such as histone acetylation do not have readers that can nucleate their re-establishment after genome duplication. Our data suggest that active chromatin can be inherited, but by an entirely different mechanism. Rather than a read-write paradigm, feedback encoded in a self-templating, regulated conformational switch of the Set3C chromatin modifying complex can be transmitted across cell divisions, establishing an activated domain in each subsequent generation. Notably, we and others have reported that a number of other chromatin-associated proteins also have prion-like properties ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016a; Du et al., 2008 15. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Byers, J.S. ∙ Jones, S. ... Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar 23.

Genet. 2008; 40 :460-465 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that this robust feedback mechanism might be broadly employed to stabilize epigenetic states across generations.
Environmental stimuli can bolster prion gain and loss ( Holmes et al., 2013; Jarosz et al., 2014a; Tapia and Koshland, 2014 39. Holmes, D.L. ∙ Lancaster, A.K. ∙ Lindquist, S. ... Heritable remodeling of yeast multicellularity by an environmentally responsive prion Cell. 2013; 153 :153-165 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar 44. Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Brown, J.C.S. ∙ Walker, G.A. ... Cross-kingdom chemical communication drives a heritable, mutually beneficial prion-based transformation of metabolism Cell. 2014; 158 :1083-1093 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar 93. Tapia, H. ∙ Koshland, D.E. Trehalose is a versatile and long-lived chaperone for desiccation tolerance Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :2758-2766 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet aside from general changes to protein homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms by which this might be achieved have remained largely enigmatic ( Harvey et al., 2018 35. Harvey, Z.H. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Jarosz, D.F. Protein-based inheritance: epigenetics beyond the chromosome Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :195-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that a specific molecular event—phosphorylation of Snt1 within its intrinsically disordered domains upon prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest—causes cells to acquire [ ESI + ]. However, constitutive phosphorylation is not needed for [ ESI + ] to persist once this modification has faded from the population. Our results imply that phosphorylation might bias the conformational ensemble of Snt1 toward a self-templating fold proficient for seeding. Once this conformation is established, self-templating is sufficient to continue propagating [ ESI + ]. Although the structural basis for this observation remains as an exciting avenue of future investigation, these results provide a robust molecular means by which prions might be engaged by transient stimuli.
Development requires the establishment of discrete cell states. In this arena, the idea of bi-stability—two states separated by cooperativity and hysteresis—has proved a powerful concept ( Xiong and Ferrell, 2003 108. Xiong, W. ∙ Ferrell, Jr., J.E. A positive-feedback-based bistable ‘memory module’ that governs a cell fate decision Nature. 2003; 426 :460-465 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bi-stability is an all-or-nothing response, where once a threshold of activity is achieved, rapid and complete conversion to an alternate state occurs. The autonomous feedback inherent to prion-based conformational switching furnishes a robust means for achieving this behavior ( Harvey et al., 2018 35. Harvey, Z.H. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Jarosz, D.F. Protein-based inheritance: epigenetics beyond the chromosome Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :195-202 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the pervasive role of phosphorylation within disordered sequences in signaling and the link between Snt1 and Cdk1, our results hint that prion-based conformational conversion could be far more integral to normal biology than previously appreciated.
Our data provide a striking example of how prion-based phenotypic bi-stability can be adaptive in fluctuating environments. [ ESI + ] allows cells to record a past cell cycle insult, mounting a transcriptional response that makes them better able to survive in stressful conditions precisely when they are most ill-suited to their environment. Further, if all else fails, they can more rapidly differentiate into a stress-resistant spore. The ability to disengage the prion, via modest changes in Hsp90 chaperone activity, is likewise critical as, in haploids, [ ESI + ] renders cells less able to mate because of collateral expression of the homothallic mating loci.
Prions allow cells to rewire their metabolism ( Jarosz et al., 2014a; Jarosz et al., 2014b 44. Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Brown, J.C.S. ∙ Walker, G.A. ... Cross-kingdom chemical communication drives a heritable, mutually beneficial prion-based transformation of metabolism Cell. 2014; 158 :1083-1093 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Jarosz, D.F. ∙ Lancaster, A.K. ∙ Brown, J.C.S. ... An evolutionarily conserved prion-like element converts wild fungi from metabolic specialists to generalists Cell. 2014; 158 :1072-1082 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) and even alter the way they translate proteins ( True et al., 2004; True and Lindquist, 2000 95. True, H.L. ∙ Lindquist, S.L. A yeast prion provides a mechanism for genetic variation and phenotypic diversity Nature. 2000; 407 :477-483 Crossref Scopus (507) PubMed Google Scholar 96. True, H.L. ∙ Berlin, I. ∙ Lindquist, S.L. Epigenetic regulation of translation reveals hidden genetic variation to produce complex traits Nature. 2004; 431 :184-187 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that the scope of prion conformational conversion is greater still, heritably altering chromatin state and consequently transcription, one of the earliest steps of decoding the genome. Given that the chromatin domains most strongly affected by [ ESI + ] are among the most polymorphic in the genome ( Peter et al., 2018 71. Peter, J. ∙ De Chiara, M. ∙ Friedrich, A. ... Genome evolution across 1,011 Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates Nature. 2018; 556 :339-344 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results provide a strong argument for the power of this protein-based form of epigenetics to spark heritable diversification of phenotypic landscapes.
It has been proposed that prion conformational conversion might be a mechanism by which distinct activity states of proteins or complexes can be established from the same assembly of peptides ( Chakravarty et al., 2019; Jarosz and Khurana, 2017 17. Chakravarty, A.K. ∙ Smejkal, T. ∙ Itakura, A.K. ... A non-amyloid prion particle that activates a heritable gene expression program Mol.

Specification of physiologic and disease states by distinct proteins and protein conformations Cell. 2017; 171 :1001-1014 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the context of chromatin, histone deacetylase complexes, including Set3C, often play dual roles as either activators or repressors ( Nusinzon and Horvath, 2005 66. Nusinzon, I. ∙ Horvath, C.M. Histone deacetylases as transcriptional activators? Role reversal in inducible gene regulation Sci. STKE. 2005; 2005 :re11 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Kim and Buratowski, 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Pijnappel et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2002 49. Kim, T. ∙ Buratowski, S.

Wang, A. ∙ Kurdistani, S.K. ∙ Grunstein, M. Requirement of Hos2 histone deacetylase for gene activity in yeast Science. 2002; 298 :1412-1414 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that [ ESI + ] can disambiguate these opposing functions. Whereas in naive cells Set3C has a mixture of activities during times of environmental fluctuation ( Kim et al., 2012 50. Kim, T. ∙ Xu, Z. ∙ Clauder-Münster, S. ... Set3 HDAC mediates effects of overlapping noncoding transcription on gene induction kinetics Cell. 2012; 150 :1158-1169 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), in [ ESI + ] cells a new function in activating sub-telomeric HAST domains emerges that is stable over long biological timescales. Given the ubiquity of seemingly contradictory transcriptional roles, and prion-like domains, in chromatin-associated proteins ( Alberti et al., 2009; Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Halfmann, R. ∙ King, O. ...

Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), it seems possible that self-templating conformational conversion might commonly tune the functions of such proteins and complexes.
A growing body of work suggests that prion-like conformational conversion might be common both within proteomes ( Alberti et al., 2009; Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 2.

Yuan, A.H. ∙ Hochschild, A. A bacterial global regulator forms a prion Science. 2017; 355 :198-201 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). We and others have found that prion proteins in the S. cerevisiae proteome are highly enriched in factors important for gene control: chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and RNA binding proteins. Further, the orthologs of many fungal prions are also predicted to be disordered across eukaryotes, including the human Snt1 ortholog NCOR1, which is part of the NCOR-SMRT histone deacetylase ( Yang and Seto, 2008 109. Yang, X.J. ∙ Seto, E. The Rpd3/Hda1 family of lysine deacetylases: from bacteria and yeast to mice and men Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :206-218 Crossref Scopus (841) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many retain self-templating properties ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 15. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Byers, J.S. ∙ Jones, S. ... Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). From this vantage point and given the strong inducibility and stress resistance of [ ESI + ], we anticipate that adaptive protein self-assembly might be commonly integrated into networks of chromatin-templated processes.

All experiments were performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The vast majority of experiments were performed in the BY4741 background acquired from GE Dharmacon. For select experiments using reporter strains, W303 or S288C were used, as noted in the Key Resources table. Deletion and GFP fusion strains were obtained from libraries deposited in GE Dharmacon and were verified by PCR and immunoblot of the modified locus. All yeast strains were stored long-term in glycerol stocks at −80°C, and all passaging was performed predonminantly on either YPD agar or broth at 30°C. For experiments requiring episomal expression, CSM drop-out media (agar or broth) was used for selection and maintenance. For heterologous protein expression, Escherichia coli LOBSTR-BL21(DE3)-RIL was used. Culturing of these strains was performed in LB media supplemented with chloramphenicol and ampicillin at 37°C.
Yeast transformation was performed by either electroporation or heat shock using standard protocols ( Guthrie and Fink, 1991 33. Guthrie, C. ∙ Fink, G. Guide to yeast genetics and molecular biology Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 :1-863 PubMed Google Scholar ). For generation of myc-tagged strains, one-step PCR amplification was performed to generate a 13xmyc-kanMX6 product with flanking homology, which was then introduced to the appropriate strain and locus by homologous recombination of the linear PCR product via standard heat shock transformation ( Bähler et al., 1998 5. Bähler, J. ∙ Wu, J.Q. ∙ Longtine, M.S. ... Heterologous modules for efficient and versatile PCR-based gene targeting in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Yeast. 1998; 14 :943-951 Crossref Scopus (1546) PubMed Google Scholar ). For curing of [ ESI + ] by transient Hsp90 inhibition, this was done similarly to as previously described ( Chakrabortee et al., 2016a 15. Chakrabortee, S. ∙ Byers, J.S. ∙ Jones, S. ... Intrinsically disordered proteins drive emergence and inheritance of biological traits Cell. 2016; 167 :369-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, strains were passaged through 2–3 single-cell bottle-necks on YPD agar containing 5 μM radicicol. Hsp90 function was then restored by passaging once on YPD prior to phenotyping.
Site directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent) on a clone of Snt1 in the Gateway-compatible pDONR221 backbone. After sequence verification, expression clones were generated in Advanced Gateway Library plasmids ( Alberti et al., 2007 1. Alberti, S. ∙ Gitler, A.D. ∙ Lindquist, S. A suite of Gateway cloning vectors for high-throughput genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 2007; 24 :913-919 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ) using standard Gateway cloning methods. All other cloning was performed by Gibson assembly ( Gibson et al., 2009 28. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (3748) PubMed Google Scholar ) using standard protocols.
Growth curves were generated by continuously monitoring OD 600 of cultures grown under the indicated stress conditions. For these experiments, yeast culture was performed in either 96- or 384-well plates, at 30°C with shaking, on a Biotek Eon plate reader. To minimize desiccation, all assays were performed in Nunc Edge plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with humidification. Growth parameters were calculated in R using the Growthcurver package ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/growthcurver/vignettes/Growthcurver-vignette.html ).
After diploids were generated by mating and auxotrophic selection, sporulation was induced by growing yeast to saturation at 30°C in pre-sporulation media (0.8% yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto-peptone, 10% dextrose, 100 mg/L adenine sulfate). Cultures were washed briefly in sterile water and resuspended in one volume enriched sporulation medium (10 g/L potassium acetate, 1 g/L yeast extract, 0.5 g/L dextrose, 0.1 g/L supplement). The supplement consisted of a mixture of 1:1:5 (by mass) of uracil, histidine, and leucine. Sporulation was performed at 25°C for 2 days, and then at 30°C for 3 days (5 days in total). Cultures were then analyzed morphologically to determine the fraction of tetrads as a fraction of the total cell population.
A gateway compatible plasmid was designed for protein expression such that any open reading frame of choice could be N-terminally linked to a His 10 -Smt3 tag and C-terminally to a SNAP tag. Full-length Snt1 was cloned into this expression plasmid and subsequently transformed into E. coli LOBSTR-BL21(DE3)-RIL cells. A 6-L culture expressing Snt1 was grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol until the OD 600 reached ~0.8. The culture was then adjusted to 1 mM IPTG and incubated for 5 h at 37°C with continuous shaking. The cultures were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 2 mL of E buffer ( Logie and Peterson, 1999; Pijnappel et al., 2001 58. Logie, C. ∙ Peterson, C.L. Purification and biochemical properties of yeast SWI/SNF complex Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304 :726-741 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Pijnappel, W.W. ∙ Schaft, D. ∙ Roguev, A. ... The S. cerevisiae SET3 complex includes two histone deacetylases, Hos2 and Hst1, and is a meiotic-specific repressor of the sporulation gene program Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2991-3004 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) (20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 350 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 × Roche Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor). Each culture was then frozen in small pellets (~1 mm diameter) by extrusion into liquid nitrogen. Cryogenic lysis was performed in a Retsch CryoMill planetary ball mill (Verder Scientific, Haan, Germany). Briefly, after all grinding jars and components were cooled in liquid nitrogen, lysis was performed using six cycles of 3 min at 15 Hz, with 2 min of additional cooling in liquid nitrogen between cycles. The resultant lysates were then diluted by the addition of 15 mL of binding buffer per liter of starting cultures, and then thawed on ice. While thawing, benzonase (Sigma Aldrich, E1014-25KU; 1 μl) was added to completely digest all nucleic acids. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 × g at 4°C. The soluble extract was mixed for 1 h with 12 mL of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN) that had been equilibrated in buffer E. The resin was recovered by gentle centrifugation and then washed three times with 12 mL of buffer E. The column was washed serially with 12 mL of buffer E with 25 and 50 mM imidazole, and then bound proteins were eluted stepwise in 12 mL aliquots of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mM imidazole in buffer E. The elution profile was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The 200 mM imidazole eluate fractions rapidly formed visible aggregates, which we subsequently purified by washing overnight with E buffer containing 4 M urea. The subsequent aggregate, which was gel-like, was confirmed to contain the protein of interest (His 10 -Smt3-Snt1-SNAP) by both immunoblot against the SNAP tag, as well as mass spectrometry.
Protein transformations were performed as previously reported ( Chakravarty et al., 2019 17. Chakravarty, A.K. ∙ Smejkal, T. ∙ Itakura, A.K. ... A non-amyloid prion particle that activates a heritable gene expression program Mol. Cell. 2019; 77 :251-265 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mid-exponential cultures of naive BY4741 and snt1Δ strains were washed with sterile water and 1 M sorbitol. The cell pellets were finally resuspended in SCE buffer (1M sorbitol, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 100 mM Na-Citrate pH 5.8). This resuspensate was then adjusted to 0.55 – 1.83 U/mL of Zymolyase®-100T (amount depended on genetic background) and incubated at 37°C for 10–15 min to make spheroplasts. These spheroplasts were pelleted by a gentle spin, washed with 1M sorbitol, and resuspended in STC buffer (1 M sorbitol, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Tris pH 7.5) by a gentle tap on the culture tube walls. All subsequent steps involving liquid transfer of these spheroplasts were done with 1 mL pipette tips that had been blunted by cutting with a sterile razor blade. These spheroplasts were incubated with salmon sperm DNA, carrier plasmid with a LEU2 marker (pAG415-GPD-ccdB, ( Alberti et al., 2007 1. Alberti, S. ∙ Gitler, A.D. ∙ Lindquist, S. A suite of Gateway cloning vectors for high-throughput genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 2007; 24 :913-919 Crossref Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Snt1-SNAP protein or BSA (at 1 μM) at room temperature for 30 min. Fusion was induced in these spheroplasts by adding 9 volumes of PEG buffer (20% (w/v) PEG 8000, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5) and incubating at room temperature for 30-60 min. These reaction conditions concomitantly generated Snt1 condensates from full-length protein. These spheroplasts were collected and finally resuspended in 250 μl of SOS buffer (1M sorbitol, 7 mM CaCl 2 , 0.25% yeast extract, 0.5% bactopeptone) by pipetting with cut pipette tips. This mixture was incubated at 30°C for 3 h after which these cells were plated on a SD-Leu solid media that had been supplemented with 1.2 M sorbitol. After plating, these cells were overlaid with a soft agar (0.8% agar) of an otherwise identical composition and the plates were incubated at 30°C for 5 days.
Mating frequencies for naive and [ ESI + ] cells were measured essentially as described by Guthrie and Fink ( Guthrie and Fink, 1991 33. Guthrie, C. ∙ Fink, G. Guide to yeast genetics and molecular biology Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194 :1-863 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, query strains were exposed to a vast excess of cells of the opposite mating type, and then incubated at 30°C for ~5 h. Cells were then plated onto diploid-selective growth medium and then colony forming units were quantified and normalized to the number of colonies that developed from identical cultures that were not subjected to mating.
SDS-PAGE separation was performed on commercially available Tris/Glycine (Bio-Rad) or MOPS (GenScript) systems using standard methods. For phosphoprotein-impeding electrophoresis (“Phostag”, Wako Chemicals), separations were performed on commercially available polyacrylamide gels containing Zn 2+ that coordinate phosphorylated residues to slow their migration through the matrix. After separation, metal ions were stripped from the gel by washing three times for 10 min in 10 mM EDTA, pH 8. Immunoblotting was performed by transfer to a 0.2 μm PVDF membrane using a Bio-Rad Transblot Turbo. Membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk dissolved in TBS T . Antibodies, described in the text or below, were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence following incubation with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP conjugates (Bio-Rad catalog no. 1706515 and 1706516, respectively), which were diluted 1:3,000 in blocking buffer. Anti-PGK1 (Invitrogen catalog no. 459250) was used as a loading control in assays of whole cell lysates.
Histones were isolated from acid-extracted nuclei as described previously ( Edmondson et al., 1996 24. Edmondson, D.G. ∙ Smith, M.M. ∙ Roth, S.Y. Repression domain of the yeast global repressor Tup1 interacts directly with histones H3 and H4 Genes Dev. 1996; 10 :1247-1259 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cultures were grown to saturation in YPD. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed briefly in sterile water, resuspended in buffer (0.1 mM Tris pH 9.4, 10 mM DTT), and incubated at 30°C with shaking for 15 min. Cells were then washed once with S1 buffer (1 M sorbitol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and resuspended in S1 buffer, and 1/25 th volume of 10 mg/mL Zymolyase 100T (Sunrise Science Products) in S1 buffer was added. Cultures were then incubated for 30 min at 30°C. An equal volume of ice-cold S2 buffer (1 M Sorbitol, 20 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl 2 ) was added, and the cells were collected by centrifugation. Cells were then washed three times in 1 mL A buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5% NP-40, 75 mM NaCl, 1 × Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail), with incubation on ice for 15 min for the first two washes and 5 min for the last. Cells were then washed once in B buffer (40 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 0.4 M NaCl, and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail), incubated on ice for 10 min, collected by centrifugation, and washed once more briefly with buffer B. Finally, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 mL 0.4 N H 2 SO 4 , and incubated on ice for 30 min with periodic vortexing. Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and the resultant supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and TCA precipitated. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-H3 (1:5,000; Abcam 1791); anti-H4 (1:1,000; Abcam 10158); anti-H3 pan-acetyl (1:1,000; Upstate 06-599); anti-H4 pan-acetyl (1:1,000; Upstate 06-866). All antibodies were previously validated elsewhere ( Kim and Buratowski, 2009 49. Kim, T. ∙ Buratowski, S. Dimethylation of H3K4 by Set1 recruits the Set3 histone deacetylase complex to 5′ transcribed regions Cell. 2009; 137 :259-272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Total RNA was extracted from diploid yeast strains grown to mid-exponential phase (OD 600 ~0.5) using a standard hot acid phenol protocol followed by chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Afterward, RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and quantified on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Further quality control and ribosomal RNA evaluation was performed by analysis on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 Nano RNA assay at the Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility (Stanford). For library generation, ERCC spike-in controls (Invitrogen) were added, and total RNA was reverse-transcribed by on-bead polyA-tail priming with Superscript IV (Invitrogen), and then fragmented on a Covaris E220 to a size range of 200–400 bp. Fragmented cDNA was end-repaired and A-tailed, and dual-index sequencing adaptors were ligated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit.
Prepared libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility using paired-end reads. Quality control of the data was performed using FastQC (Babraham Institute). Transcript-level quantification against the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 288C reference genome assembly R64 available from ENSEMBL was performed using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 6. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (1634) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 60. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (13133) PubMed Google Scholar ) in R, in which all subsequent data manipulation was performed. Significantly differentially regulated transcripts were called using the multiple-hypothesis corrected p value calculated using DESeq2’s default settings, Benjamini-Hochberg, which approximates the false discovery rate (FDR). Overlap between differential expression of datasets generated by this study and by others was performed using a hypergeometric test. All other analyses were performed with sequencing-depth-normalized coverage maps generated by aligning reads to the same reference genome using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 56. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (15128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genome-wide per-basepair coverage was calculated using BEDtools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 76. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (7033) PubMed Google Scholar ). The density of upregulation was calculated by creating ~1 kb bins across all chromosomes, and then calculating the ratio of increased to decreased counts.
Chromatin isolation was performed using a protocol adapted from Kuras and Struhl ( Kuras and Struhl, 1999 53. Kuras, L. ∙ Struhl, K. Binding of TBP to promoters in vivo is stimulated by activators and requires Pol II holoenzyme Nature. 1999; 399 :609-613 Crossref Scopus (397) PubMed Google Scholar ). One-half liter of diploid cells were grown to mid-exponential phase per ChIP to be performed, and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 1 h before collection by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in FA lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1X Roche Complete Protease Inhibitors) with 0.5% SDS added, and then lysed using acid-washed glass beads for 15 min at 50 Hz. Chromatin was then precipitated by ultracentrifugation at 237,000 x g for 30 min, then resuspended in 1 mL FA lysis buffer with 0.1% SDS. Chromatin suspension was then fragmented to predominant final DNA length of ~150-200 bp in a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator, and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. 10% of the resultant chromatin preparations was reserved as input controls.
Pan-acetyl H3 (H3ac), pan-acetyl H4 (H4ac), and RNA Pol II ChIPs were performed using antibody-coupled Protein G Dynabeads (antibodies used, respectively: Upstate 06-599, Upstate 06-866, and Active Motif 39097). After precipitation overnight in FA buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 275 mM NaCl, H3ac and H4ac precipitations were washed once with FA buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 500 mM NaCl, once with buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 750 mM NaCl, once with wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and once with TE before being eluted in TE with 1% SDS at 65°C. Snt1-myc, Rap1-myc, and Hos2-myc precipitations were all performed with c-Myc affinity agarose (Sigma-Aldrich A7470) blocked with 2% BSA. After precipitation overnight in FA buffer with 0.1% SDS and 275 mM NaCl, all were washed once with FA buffer with 0.1% SDS and 275 mM NaCl, once with the same buffer but with 500 mM NaCl, one with wash buffer, and once with TE before being eluted in TE with 1% SDS at 65°C.
After elution, proteinase K was added (final concentration 0.2 mg/mL) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h before crosslink reversal at 65°C overnight. Precipitants were then cleaned using a standard phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by isopropanol precipitation overnight. DNA was then resuspended in DEPC-treated water, and then the concentration was measured by Qubit spectrophotometer. Libraries for sequencing were then generated using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit, and sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility.
Quality control of ChIP-seq libraries was performed using FastQC (Babraham Institute), as with RNA-seq libraries. Reads were then aligned to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 288C reference genome assembly R64 available from ENSEMBL using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 56. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (15128) PubMed Google Scholar ), and genome-wide per-basepair coverage was calculated using BEDtools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 76. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (7033) PubMed Google Scholar ). Coverage calculations were then normalized for sequencing depth, and then ChIP libraries were normalized by per-basepair coverage of parallelly sequenced input chromatin libraries. Chromosome-wide binding density as a function of distance from telomeres was calculated as the ratio of ChIP-enriched (log 2 ChIP/Input >0) to ChIP-depleted (log 2 ChIP/Input < 0) across ~1 kb bins. For differential binding densities, a similar calculation was performed on differential coverage tracks (log 2 [ ESI + ] − log 2 Naive).
The Cre-Reported Altered States of Heterochromatin (CRASH) assay was conducted essentially as described by Dodson and Rine ( Dodson and Rine, 2015 22. Dodson, A.E. ∙ Rine, J. Heritable capture of heterochromatin dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae eLife. 2015; 4 :e05007 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Naive and [ ESI + ] CRASH haploids were grown in medium lacking tryptophan and supplemented with G418 (200 mg/L). The OD 600 of each culture was measured, and ~20 cells of each strain were spread onto thin SD-Trp, 1% agar plates. Each plate was imaged with a Leica M205 FA.
Immunoprecipitation of Snt1 was performed on diploid cells harboring a genomically integrated fusion of a C-terminal 13xmyc-kanMX6 tag at one allele of the appropriate locus. Ability of the tagged version to hold both naive and [ ESI + ] conformers was confirmed by growth assay. For each immunoblot, 1 L of mid-exponentially grown cells (OD 600 ~0.5) were grown in either rich (YPD) or selective (synthetic complete drop-out medium). The cultures were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer ( Logie and Peterson, 1999; Pijnappel et al., 2001 58. Logie, C. ∙ Peterson, C.L. Purification and biochemical properties of yeast SWI/SNF complex Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304 :726-741 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Pijnappel, W.W. ∙ Schaft, D. ∙ Roguev, A. ... The S. cerevisiae SET3 complex includes two histone deacetylases, Hos2 and Hst1, and is a meiotic-specific repressor of the sporulation gene program Genes Dev. 2001; 15 :2991-3004 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) (20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 350 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 × Roche Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor). Each culture was then frozen in small pellets (~1 mm diameter) by extrusion into liquid nitrogen. Cryogenic lysis was performed in a Retsch CryoMill planetary ball mill (Verder Scientific, Haan, Germany). Briefly, after all grinding jars and components were cooled in liquid nitrogen, lysis was performed using six cycles of 3 min at 15 Hz, with 2 min of additional cooling in liquid nitrogen between cycles. The resultant lysates were then diluted by the addition of 4.5 mL of binding buffer per liter of starting cultures, and then thawed on ice. Lysates were then clarified by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C.
c-Myc agarose affinity gel (40 μl per liter of starting culture; Sigma-Aldrich A7470) was blocked prior to use, and then added to clarified lysates, which were incubated for 2 h with rotation at 4°C. Beads were collected by gentle centrifugation and washed four times with binding buffer, and then precipitates were eluted by boiling in loading dye and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Blots were probed with either anti-c-Myc (Abcam ab32) at 1:1,000 dilutions.
Limited proteolysis was performed on immunoprecipitated protein from native lysates. Lysis was performed as described in the previous section. For seeding experiments, 5% by mass of unlabeled [ ESI + ] lysate was added to similarly prepared naive lysates derived from Snt1-13xmyc strains, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation. Total lysate from both naive and [ ESI + ] cells (20 mg/sample) was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4°C on c-Myc agarose affinity gel (40 μl) previously blocked with 2% BSA in E buffer at 4°C for 2 h. The affinity gel was then washed four times with proteinase K buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.5, 1 mM DTT), and the beads were resuspended in 40 μl of proteinase K buffer and divided into 10 μl aliquots; 10 μl of proteinase K buffer supplemented with 50 pg of proteinase K was added directly to each aliquot of bead slurry. Reactions were carried out at 37°C and quenched by the addition of 20 μl of 5 × SDS loading dye followed by boiling at 95°C. Analysis was then performed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described in the previous section.
All CRISPRi knockdowns were performed using a one-vector system in which Mxi1 is used to silence dCas9-targeted transcripts ( Smith et al., 2016 88. Smith, J.D. ∙ Suresh, S. ∙ Schlecht, U. ... Quantitative CRISPR interference screens in yeast identify chemical-genetic interactions and new rules for guide RNA design Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :45 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Guide sequences for Rap1 were designed using the Yeast CRISPRi database ( http://lp2.github.io/yeast-crispri/ ). We tested several guides of varying strength, the majority of which were extremely toxic to the cells. Thus, we settled on a modestly acting guide that gave a downregulation of > 50% as verified by imaging of Rap1-GFP strains. For shuffle control, the sequence 5′- TAATTTTCGGACACGACTTA-3′ was used, whereas 5′-GGGTGTTGAAGAAATGATTG-3′ was used for Rap1-targeting. Complete CRISPRi constructs were generated via Gibson assembly of single-stranded DNA oligos PCR-amplified with universal adaptors into Not I-digested empty vector. Knockdown of ORFs was induced via addition of anhydrotetracycline (ATc; final concentration 250 ng/mL) to strains grown in CSM-Ura liquid medium.
Throughout the manuscript, n generally refers to the number of clonal isolates for a specific strain and condition, unless otherwise noted in the appropriate figure legend (i.e., where a replicate refers to separate induction events, rather than just clonal isolates). For all figures, replicates are noted in the legend, and where possible and appropriate, all points for all replicates are plotted. Unless otherwise stated in the appropriate figure legends, all t tests were 2-tailed, unpaired, and assuming equal variance and calculated using GraphPad Prism v. 7. All other statistical tests were performed in R and are noted in the appropriate figure legend. Generally, the average was calculated as the mean, and expressed with the standard error, unless otherwise noted in figure legends. For growth curve quantifications, the empirical area under the curve (AUC) metric was used, and was normalized to naive, wild-type strains grown concurrently to standardize experiments. For all claims of statistical significance, a critical threshold of 0.05 was used for unadjusted p values. For mRNA-seq, the threshold was set to the DESeq2 default of 0.1 Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p value. For disorder propensity calculations, DISOPRED2 ( Ward et al., 2004 104. Ward, J.J. ∙ Sodhi, J.S. ∙ McGuffin, L.J. ... Prediction and functional analysis of native disorder in proteins from the three kingdoms of life J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337 :635-645 Crossref Scopus (1402) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. No statistical methods were used to determine sample size, and no data were excluded.
