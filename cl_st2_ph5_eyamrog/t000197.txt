Section: ABSTRACT

The philosophy of Charles S. Peirce, and in particular his theory of signs (semiotic), has seen increasing interest within archaeological theory over the past 20 years. This article reviews Peirce's most influential ideas within archaeology, directs readers to where in Peirce's voluminous works they can find these ideas, and discusses how each of them has been applied by archaeologists to a variety of different research topics. In addition to the semiotic, these ideas include Peirce's metaphysical doctrine of synechism; his methodological pragmatism; abductive logic; and the phenomenological concepts of firstness, secondness, and thirdness. Finally, I discuss two research areas—materiality and paleolithic archaeology—in which a combination of Peirce's ideas has led to important new insights.

Section: INTRODUCTION

In this article, I discuss the applications of the philosophy of Charles S. Peirce in archaeological theory. In particular, I focus on Peirce's theory of signs, or semiotic 1 , and on the archaeological literature within the last 20 years. I aim to show that Peirce's ideas have widespread utility for archaeologists, giving us new ways of approaching diverse topics such as meaning, habit, mind, materiality, and agency.
Peirce was a nineteenth- and twentieth-century American philosopher and is credited with founding the philosophical tradition of pragmatism. Over the course of his life, he produced an astonishing amount of written material, of which his most famous is his theory of signs. This semiotic can be contrasted with the better-known semiology of Ferdinand de Saussure. Peirce's ideas have enjoyed considerable attention within cultural and linguistic anthropology, especially as articulated by Michael Silverstein and his followers.
Yet within archaeology, Peirce's ideas were used only occasionally throughout the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., Deacon 1997 ; Gardin 1992 ; Graves-Brown 1995 ; Herzfeld 1992 ; Hodder 1987 , 1989 ; Parmentier 1997 ). This sporadic usage became a flood after Preucel & Bauer's (2001) seminal article, which laid out a compelling case for the superiority of Peirce's semiotic over Saussure's account of signs and showed its application to archaeological interpretation. Each author quickly expanded this argument in subsequent publications ( Bauer 2002a , b ; Capone & Preucel 2002 ), and, in 2006, Preucel published Archaeological Semiotics , a book that considered Saussurean and Peircean approaches to signs in more detail, reviewed previous archaeological literature and its relation to these approaches, and laid out two extensive case studies that applied a Peircean semiotic approach. Since that time, interest in Peirce's ideas has dramatically increased among archaeologists working on diverse time periods, areas of the world, archaeological materials, and aspects of human social life. This article focuses on these more recent works, and readers interested in earlier applications of Peirce in archaeology are encouraged to refer to Preucel (2006) .
It is widely acknowledged that Peirce's works are voluminous and difficult to read. Below, I outline what I see as the key aspects of Peirce's philosophy as they apply to archaeology. For the ease of the reader, I have noted where these ideas can be found in Peirce's own writing. In doing so, I have endeavored to restrict myself to the fewest number of volumes possible: All but one reference comes from Volume 2 of The Essential Peirce (1998) , published by the Peirce Edition Project. I have also provided archaeologists’ translations of these concepts to render them more accessible. After reviewing each of these concepts and its application to archaeology individually, I discuss two research areas—materiality and paleolithic archaeology—in which scholars have brought a number of Peirce's ideas together to reach new insights.

Section: PEIRCE'S PHILOSOPHY: METAPHYSICS, METHODOLOGY, LOGIC, AND PHENOMENOLOGY

Peirce's theory of signs does not stand in isolation from his other philosophical ideas. Before reviewing the semiotic, this section considers other elements of Peirce's philosophy and their applications in recent archaeological literature.
A useful starting place is Peirce's doctrine of synechism. 2 Contrasting synechism with materialism, idealism, and dualism, Peirce defines it as “the tendency to regard everything as continuous” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 1). He continues, “I carry the doctrine so far as to maintain that continuity governs the whole domain of experience in every element of it” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 1). This doctrine puts Peirce at odds with the subject/object divide that forms the basis of Cartesian philosophy ( Preucel 2006 , p. 49). To reinforce this point, Peirce asserts that “the synechist will not admit that physical and psychical phenomena are entirely distinct…but will insist that all phenomena are of one character, though some are more mental and spontaneous and others more material and regular” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 2).
The doctrine of synechism is relevant to recent archaeological approaches to materiality, which have similarly sought to break down divisions between the human subject and the material world (see the section titled Peirce, Materiality, and Language). For example, Cipolla (2018 , pp. 64–65) notes the similarities between the doctrine of synechism and assemblage theory, the notion that people and things exist as social assemblages, with neither human nor object taking precedence. The doctrine also applies to material engagement theory, a recent paradigm within cognitive archaeology that sees the human mind not as coterminous with the brain, but rather as made up of a network of interactions between people and materials (see Iliopoulos 2019 , Martel 2020 , Watts 2008 ) (see the section titled Peirce and the Paleolithic).
This doctrine of synechism underlies Peirce's more well-known concepts. It rejects the division between functional and ideational interpretations of the material record, instead seeing them as a continuous whole ( Knappett 2011 , p. 217; Parmentier 1997 ; Watts 2008 , p. 190).
Peirce is regarded as the father of the American philosophical tradition known as pragmatism. 3 Peirce saw pragmatism as a methodological stance rather than a metaphysical one ( Peirce 1998 , pp. 400–1) and described it as such: “[C]onsider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings we conceive the object of our conception to have: then, our conception of those effects is the whole of our conceptions of the object” (p. 135). Preucel (2006 , p. 49) explains that pragmatism “is a method for investigating the meaning of concepts by envisioning their practical consequences.” In other words, pragmatism focuses methodologically on the observable effects of ideas ( Cipolla 2013 , p. 19).
Although later pragmatic philosophers, especially William James, attributed the origins of their ideas to Peirce, there were some important differences between them. Peirce acknowledged the existence of an external world or “truth,” which ultimately constrains interpretation, but argued that we can access it only through our own mediated experience of it. Later pragmatists, by contrast, rejected this external truth altogether (see Bauer 2013a , p. 182). As Preucel (2006 , p. 51) notes, this distinction may seem subtle, but it is in fact “the difference between scientific realism and social constructivism.” This disagreement led Peirce to later critique James for misunderstanding his ideas and to rename his own views “pragmaticism” to distinguish them ( Peirce 1998 , p. 334; Bauer 2013b , note 6).
Adopting a Peircean pragmatic approach in archaeology, therefore, requires neither that we reject the reality of the past, nor that we view a human interpreter as an ontological necessity (versus Harris & Cipolla 2017 , p. 126). And yet, it acknowledges that past events are interpretable only through their observable effects. This focus on effects is especially appropriate in a discipline such as archaeology, which is characterized by evidential scarcity ( Herzfeld 1992 ) and thus struggles with an inherent skepticism about which aspects of past society are more or less interpretable (see Hawkes 1954 ). Pragmati(ci)sm reminds us that archaeologists do not have to read the minds of ancient people any more than cultural or linguistic anthropologists read the minds of living informants. Ideas and thoughts in the past as well as in the present are efficacious only if they are materially observable.
Adopting a pragmatic approach thus allows archaeologists to do a number of things. Agbe-Davies (2016) shows how pragmatism invites us to focus on means–ends types of questions. For example, she argues that archaeologists working on slave quarters in North America do not recover African beliefs about spiritual protection; rather, they find evidence that someone in those contexts did something with blue beads. To understand the consequences (broadly conceived) of what those blue beads did, we need to compare different patterns at different archaeological sites ( Agbe-Davies 2016 , p. 9). Similarly, archaeologists of religion have applied pragmatism to ask not what beliefs were held by practitioners in the past, but rather what those beliefs did in an observable way ( Aldenderfer 2011 , Joyce 2011 , Shults 2010 ). Kissel & Fuentes (2016) , in examining the emergence of early modern human behavior, ask not what humans are, but what humans do and how long they have been doing it. Finally, Preucel & Mrozowski (2010 , p. 3) have claimed that a spirit of pragmatism is growing in archaeology more broadly, in the sense that archaeology as a discipline can achieve effects in the present, such as to contribute to the resolution of challenges facing humanity.
In keeping with his belief that a real external world exists, Peirce argued that people approach an understanding of this world through a process he called abduction, 4 “a method of forming a general prediction without any positive assurance that it will succeed either in the special case or usually.…[P]ast experiences give us strong encouragement to hope that it will succeed in the future” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 299). Peirce explained that abduction was a partially subconscious process, describing it as a flash of insight based on habitual experience of the world ( Peirce 1998 , p. 227; see Filipowicz 2017 , p. 52). For archaeologists, this concept applies not only to how people in the past reached conclusions about their own experiences (see Filipowicz 2017 ), but also to how archaeologists reach interpretations of the past in the present. Bauer (2013a , p. 180) and Preucel (2006 , pp. 253–54) compare abduction to Wylie's (1989) concept of archaeological tacking between theory and data.
Peirce believed that the outside world would ultimately place constraints on interpretation. Thus, although different individuals might experience the world differently and reach different conclusions about it, a wider community acting together can approach a truthful interpretation. Bauer (2013a) applies this idea to archaeology, suggesting that archaeologists incorporate the ideas of different communities and stakeholders into their interpretations of the past. He compares this process to Wikipedia, where a community of editors work together to create a reliable page, with inaccuracies being constrained by the overall community's experience with the world. Bauer (2013a) notes, “[I]f its contents were routinely found to be inaccurate, Wikipedia would quickly lose its audience” (p. 187). While Bauer's argument is compelling, the year 2020, in which I wrote this article, has brought us conspiracy theories that threaten to topple the US government and hospital patients who insist that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) does not exist, even as it kills them. Thus, constraints on interpretation do not always operate as quickly as we might like.
Peirce's seeming obsession with the number three has often been pointed out by his readers. This proliferation of triads is an effect of his underlying doctrine of firstness, secondness, and thirdness, 5 which he applies to different aspects of the semiotic. Firstness, Peirce explains, is “that which is such as it is positively and regardless of anything else” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 267). Firstness is possibility before any kind of perception ( Peirce 1998 , pp. 268–69). Secondness is “that which is as it is in a second something's being as it is, regardless of any third” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 267). In other words, secondness is the actual physical experience of the world. “A door is slightly ajar. You try to open it. Something prevents. You put your shoulder against it and experience a sense of resistance” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 268). Thirdness is “that which is as it is as being a Third, or Medium, between a Second and its First” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 160). In other words, a third is that which brings a first and a second into relation. Beyond the basic raw physical experience of the world (secondness), thirdness therefore includes the experience of thought, the formation of habits, the recognition of patterns, and the formulation of laws. As discussed below, thirdness is essential for the process of semiosis. In summary, as explained by Bauer (2002a) , firstness is essence, secondness is instantiation, and thirdness is relation.
A useful starting place is Peirce's doctrine of synechism. 2 Contrasting synechism with materialism, idealism, and dualism, Peirce defines it as “the tendency to regard everything as continuous” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 1). He continues, “I carry the doctrine so far as to maintain that continuity governs the whole domain of experience in every element of it” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 1).

Section: SEMIOTIC: PEIRCE'S THEORY OF SIGNS

Peirce's theory of signs 6 is the work for which he is best known, although it goes hand in hand with the other concepts described above. For Peirce, a sign is “anything, of whatsoever mode of being, which mediates between an object and an interpretant” ( Peirce 1998 , p. 410). The sign is a three-part relationship: The sign (or representamen) stands for an object (which can be a nonphysical thing like an idea) and generates a response (an interpretant). Crucially, interpretants can themselves become new signs. For example, if a person asks about the weather, the response is both an interpretant of the question as well as a new sign to be interpreted by the questioner ( Peirce 1998 , p. 498; see Crossland 2019 , p. 240). Notice the relationship between the semiotic and Peirce's pragmatic methodology—the world is interpretable only through signs, which themselves have to be physically perceivable to have efficacy. Furthermore, to understand the meaning of signs in anthropological or archaeological contexts, we must observe their interpretants—the responses that they produce, which we in turn interpret as new signs.
Many archaeologists emphasize that the triadic sign relation described by Peirce stands in contrast to the better known Saussurean ( de Saussure 1966 ) model of the sign, which is composed of a two-part relation between signifier and signified. The Saussurean account, which was developed primarily to describe language, focuses on an ideal, rule-governed system ( langue ) and describes the relationship between these idealized components of language and the ideas produced in the minds of interlocutors. Peirce, in contrast, developed his theory of signs to describe not only language but all other kinds of semiotic phenomena as well and focused on the role of signs in mediating our experience of the real world. The Saussurean model influenced archaeology in the 1980s and 1990s (see Preucel 2006 ), ultimately leading to a frustration with comparisons between language and material culture (see the section titled Peirce, Materiality, and Language). Preucel & Bauer's (2001) call to archaeologists to adopt Peirce's semiotic rather than Saussure's has been taken up by many archaeologists in the years since ( Baron 2014 , p. 253; e.g., Baron 2016 ; Barrett 2013 ; Cipolla 2013 ; Crossland 2014 , 2019 ; Crossland & Bauer 2017 ; Deacon 2011 ; Hodgson 2014 ; Iliopoulos 2016b , 2019 ; Jones 2006 ; Joyce 2012 ; Kissel & Fuentes 2016 , 2017 ; Knappett 2005 ; Lele 2006 ; Swenson 2018 ; Wallis 2013 ; Watts 2008 ).
Signs can be described using Peirce's phenomenology: Qualisigns are the physical characteristics of signs, such as color, hardness, etc. Qualisigns are firsts in that they are pure potentiality until they exist in actual individual manifestations of signs, what Peirce called sinsigns or tokens (seconds). Finally, legisigns, also called types, are not individual signs but general categories (thirds) (see Peirce 1998 , p. 291). Let us look at an example of these kinds of signs: The colors red, white, and blue are qualisigns. Though we can imagine them, they do not physically exist on their own and are therefore firsts. They can be combined together (with other qualisigns) to form the American flag that graces the White House. This flag is a sinsign—a particular instantiation of these qualisigns and therefore a second. But this specific flag is also a token or “replica” of a legisign 7 —the American flag in general as a conventional sign (a third). Each individual token is a replica of the type by virtue of shared qualia, in this case red, white, and blue. A linguistic example would include the phonological properties of the phonemes [n] and [o] (qualisigns), which were instantiated when I corrected my toddler this morning, “no!” (a sinsign), and which was in turn a replica of a legisign—the conventional word no . Thus, these three kinds of signs form a hierarchy: Legisigns are made up of sinsign replicas, which are made up of qualisigns (see Peirce 1998 , p. 291).
Kissel & Fuentes (2017) , pointing to the ephemerality of archaeological data from before 100,000 years ago, apply these concepts and suggest that archaeologists need to understand not necessarily what signs meant but how they meant. For instance, finding repeated examples of similar kinds of artifacts suggests that they are replicas of a legisign, which in turn suggests the capacity for “habitual shared meaning-making” (p. 7). Similar points were raised by Herzfeld (1992) , who argued that archaeologists should search for “metapatterns” (combinations of patterns) of artifacts rather than referential meanings. Other archaeologists have applied Peirce's concept of the replica to more recent archaeological contexts. Filipowicz (2017) examines motifs such as bulls’ heads from Çatalhöyük and their subsequent dispersal during the Chalcolithic period. She argues that as these motifs continued to replicate, their legisign's interpretant shifted from an ideal bull's head motif to a more abstract ideal of Çatalhöyük itself in minds and memories (p. 58). Andean archaeologists such as Coben (2006) , Stanish (2012) , and Swenson (2015) have observed replicas of ceremonial architecture and landscape modification among Andean complex societies. And, citing Parmentier (1997 , p. 50), Gokee (2016) and Watts (2008) both describe pottery styles as legisigns, of which particular pots are replicas.
The relationship (or “ground”) between a sign and its object is the subject of Peirce's most famous trichotomy: Signs that relate to their object through physical similarity are termed icons ( Peirce 1998 , p. 273); those that relate to their object through spatial/temporal contiguity, cause/effect, or part/whole relationships are termed indexes ( Peirce 1998 , p. 274); and those whose relationship is arbitrary or conventional are termed symbols ( Peirce 1998 , p. 274). Rather than distinct, these three grounds are also hierarchical: The symbolic ground incorporates the indexical, which incorporates the iconic. This view contrasts with Saussure's account of the sign, which essentially deals only with symbolic legisigns (arbitrary types).
The icon/index/symbol triad has allowed archaeologists to consider the myriad ways that the material world functions as signs. In particular, recent archaeologists have focused on iconicity and indexicality in the semiotic function of artifacts. Considering stone, for example, Sonesson (1994) and Martel (2020) both examine how rock art in general uses these different types of ground, whereas Hodgson (2014) focuses on the Blombos Cave, South Africa, and Jones (2006) and Rédei et al. (2019) examine contexts from prehistoric Europe. Stones inscribed with texts play an important role in analyses by Crossland (2014 , 2019) and Baron (2014 , 2016) , whereas Díaz-Guardamino Uribe (2008) considers the indexicality of unadorned standing stones from Bronze Age Spain. Piled stone heaps are analyzed as indexes by Cipolla (2016) and Lele (2006) . Finally, Barrett (2013) , Deacon (1997) , Herzfeld (1992) , and Wynn (1995) all apply the icon/index/symbol triad to the study of stone tools.
Other archaeologists use the concepts of iconicity and indexicality in ceramic analysis. Bauer (2013b) examines the emergence of a ceramic style in the context of interaction between heterogeneous communities of the Bronze Age Black Sea region, whereas Gokee (2016) similarly considers pottery style within the ethnic milieu of West Africa ca. 1700–1950. In the Americas, Joyce (2007) , Wallis (2013) , and Watts (2008) each analyze ceramic signs—decorative motifs and figurines—in pre-contact contexts. For contexts of European contact, Capone & Preucel (2002 ; see also Preucel 2006 , chapter 9) describe how ceramic signs were manipulated during the Pueblo Revolt to justify the uprising and invoke traditional community practices, and Pugh (2013) considers the changing role of ceramics in gender relationships among the Pawnee under Colonial rule.
Several archaeologists have also applied the concepts of icon, index, and symbol to the interpretation of architecture and the built environment. Many of these studies focus on religious architecture ( Baron 2014 , 2016 ; Coben 2006 ; Fogelin 2014 , 2015 ; Schoenfelder 2011 ; Stanish 2012 ; Swenson 2018 ). Other interesting applications include the houses of missionaries in nineteenth-century southern Africa ( Crossland 2013 ), changing site plans in the wake of the Pueblo Revolt ( Liebmann 2008 ), and conflicting ideologies of house configuration at a nineteenth-century commune in Massachusetts ( Preucel 2006 , chapter 8).
Finally, the concepts of icon, index, and symbol are also applicable to the study of the human body and human remains. Crossland (2009 , 2018 ; Crossland & Bauer 2017 ) has focused on forensic contexts, such as cranial reconstruction, fingerprinting, and forensic entomology. Forensic specialists interpret this evidence as indexical signs (in a cause–effect relation), which allows them to make a claim of scientific objectivity while sometimes obscuring uncertainty or the sign's possibly arbitrary (symbolic) relation to its object. Barrett (2019) applies similar ideas to the study of ancient DNA (aDNA) as a sign of population movements. Does this aDNA, he asks, iconically resemble an ancient population, thereby signifying mass migration, or is it merely indexical, leaving room for more complex processes?
Finally, we turn to Peirce's description of the interpretant. Note that interpretants are not interpreters—they are not human beings or even plants and animals. Interpretants are mediated responses or habits. Peirce applied his phenomenological categories to the relationship between signs and interpretants: The sign might provoke a sense of possibility (a rheme), it might be a sign of actual existence (a dicent), or it might formulate a general law (an argument) ( Peirce 1998 , p. 292).
Interpretants themselves can exist in different forms, to be read as signs in different ways (see Peirce 1998 , p. 409). First, interpretants can be emotional—what Crossland (2014 , p. 73) calls affective—that is, they can be raw, unreflected feelings. Second, interpretants can be energetic, that is, some sort of physical response or focused attention. Third, interpretants can be logical—what Crossland (2014 , p. 73) calls habitual — that is, they can be governed by law or habit (see Preucel & Bauer 2001 , p. 93). As with Peirce's other trichotomies, these categories are hierarchical: A logical interpretant presupposes energetic interpretants, which presuppose emotional interpretants. Crossland (2013 , p. 105) explores this diversity of interpretant possibilities in the shaping and building of a house, noting that these possibilities cannot all be articulated in language. Swenson (2018) also observes how these types of interpretants seem to overlap in the case of graffiti in the Huaca Colorada, a pre-Columbian Moche temple in Peru. These seemingly unauthorized incised images likely provoked an emotional response, leading to the energetic creation of additional graffiti images, which over time became habitual community practice.
Several authors focus in particular on the logical interpretant of Peirce's trichotomy and its habitual nature. Preucel & Bauer (2001) , for example (see also Preucel 2006 , chapter 8), use this concept to explain the long-recognized durability of material culture meanings (see Hodder 1989 , p. 73). They compare the logical interpretant to Bourdieu's concept of the habitus, in that both concepts refer to the ways that people regularly engage with the material by drawing on previous experiences, whether consciously or not (see also Gokee 2016 ). Crossland (2013 , pp. 94–95; 2014 , p. 83) similarly relates these concepts but notes that the logical interpretant results not only in habits formed but also in habits changed after the encounter with new, different material configurations. Old habits die hard, however, and Crossland explores the semiotic delay experienced by missionaries in nineteenth-century southern Africa in their recognition of the ritual landscape. Other applications of this Peircean idea of habit include Lele's (2006) examination of rosary beads and stone walls in Ireland, Cipolla's (2016 , 2018) description of the habitual piling of stones in New England, Bauer's (2013b) consideration of habitual engagements between communities of the Bronze Age Black Sea, and Gokee's (2016) differentiation between habitual and conscious aspects of pottery production.
Peirce's classification of interpretants as emotional, energetic, and logical makes it clear that he was concerned chiefly with the processes of the human mind. And yet Peirce acknowledged that his semiotic would also apply in other situations, for example, a sunflower turning toward the sun ( Peirce 1998 , p. 273). In fact, he even stated that “thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world” ( Peirce 1933 , p. 550). Kockelman (2011 , p. 721) applies the idea of nonmental interpretants to the world of human artifacts, arguing that while a tool such as a hammer is a sign—whose object is its function to hammer nails and whose interpretant is the act of hammering done by the hammerer—it is also an interpretant, an outcome of the hammer-making process (see also Kockelman 2015 , pp. 179–80). Crossland (2013 , p. 101; 2014 , p. 226; 2019 , pp. 240–41) has applied this idea to the archaeological record. “A vessel built to hold warm liquid is an interpretant of the liquid's capacity to be held, and its ability to be kept warm. A tomb built to hold the dead is an interpretant that anticipates future mourners and future commemoration of the dead” ( Crossland & Bauer 2017 , p. 8).
Signs can be described using Peirce's phenomenology: Qualisigns are the physical characteristics of signs, such as color, hardness, etc. Qualisigns are firsts in that they are pure potentiality until they exist in actual individual manifestations of signs, what Peirce called sinsigns or tokens (seconds). Finally, legisigns, also called types, are not individual signs but general categories (thirds) (see Peirce 1998 , p. 291). Let us look at an example of these kinds of signs: The colors red, white, and blue are qualisigns. Though we can imagine them, they do not physically exist on their own and are therefore firsts. They can be combined together (with other qualisigns) to form the American flag that graces the White House. This flag is a sinsign—a particular instantiation of these qualisigns and therefore a second. But this specific flag is also a token or “replica” of a legisign 7 —the American flag in general as a conventional sign (a third). Each individual token is a replica of the type by virtue of shared qualia, in this case red, white, and blue. A linguistic example would include the phonological properties of the phonemes [n] and [o] (qualisigns), which were instantiated when I corrected my toddler this morning, “no!” (a sinsign), and which was in turn a replica of a legisign—the conventional word no . Thus, these three kinds of signs form a hierarchy: Legisigns are made up of sinsign replicas, which are made up of qualisigns (see Peirce 1998 , p. 291).
Kissel & Fuentes (2017) , pointing to the ephemerality of archaeological data from before 100,000 years ago, apply these concepts and suggest that archaeologists need to understand not necessarily what signs meant but how they meant. For instance, finding repeated examples of similar kinds of artifacts suggests that they are replicas of a legisign, which in turn suggests the capacity for “habitual shared meaning-making” (p. 7). Similar points were raised by Herzfeld (1992) , who argued that archaeologists should search for “metapatterns” (combinations of patterns) of artifacts rather than referential meanings. Other archaeologists have applied Peirce's concept of the replica to more recent archaeological contexts. Filipowicz (2017) examines motifs such as bulls’ heads from Çatalhöyük and their subsequent dispersal during the Chalcolithic period. She argues that as these motifs continued to replicate, their legisign's interpretant shifted from an ideal bull's head motif to a more abstract ideal of Çatalhöyük itself in minds and memories (p. 58). Andean archaeologists such as Coben (2006) , Stanish (2012) , and Swenson (2015) have observed replicas of ceremonial architecture and landscape modification among Andean complex societies. And, citing Parmentier (1997 , p. 50), Gokee (2016) and Watts (2008) both describe pottery styles as legisigns, of which particular pots are replicas.
The relationship (or “ground”) between a sign and its object is the subject of Peirce's most famous trichotomy: Signs that relate to their object through physical similarity are termed icons ( Peirce 1998 , p. 273); those that relate to their object through spatial/temporal contiguity, cause/effect, or part/whole relationships are termed indexes ( Peirce 1998 , p. 274); and those whose relationship is arbitrary or conventional are termed symbols ( Peirce 1998 , p. 274). Rather than distinct, these three grounds are also hierarchical: The symbolic ground incorporates the indexical, which incorporates the iconic. This view contrasts with Saussure's account of the sign, which essentially deals only with symbolic legisigns (arbitrary types).
The icon/index/symbol triad has allowed archaeologists to consider the myriad ways that the material world functions as signs. In particular, recent archaeologists have focused on iconicity and indexicality in the semiotic function of artifacts. Considering stone, for example, Sonesson (1994) and Martel (2020) both examine how rock art in general uses these different types of ground, whereas Hodgson (2014) focuses on the Blombos Cave, South Africa, and Jones (2006) and Rédei et al. (2019) examine contexts from prehistoric Europe. Stones inscribed with texts play an important role in analyses by Crossland (2014 , 2019) and Baron (2014 , 2016) , whereas Díaz-Guardamino Uribe (2008) considers the indexicality of unadorned standing stones from Bronze Age Spain. Piled stone heaps are analyzed as indexes by Cipolla (2016) and Lele (2006) . Finally, Barrett (2013) , Deacon (1997) , Herzfeld (1992) , and Wynn (1995) all apply the icon/index/symbol triad to the study of stone tools.
Other archaeologists use the concepts of iconicity and indexicality in ceramic analysis. Bauer (2013b) examines the emergence of a ceramic style in the context of interaction between heterogeneous communities of the Bronze Age Black Sea region, whereas Gokee (2016) similarly considers pottery style within the ethnic milieu of West Africa ca. 1700–1950. In the Americas, Joyce (2007) , Wallis (2013) , and Watts (2008) each analyze ceramic signs—decorative motifs and figurines—in pre-contact contexts. For contexts of European contact, Capone & Preucel (2002 ; see also Preucel 2006 , chapter 9) describe how ceramic signs were manipulated during the Pueblo Revolt to justify the uprising and invoke traditional community practices, and Pugh (2013) considers the changing role of ceramics in gender relationships among the Pawnee under Colonial rule.
Several archaeologists have also applied the concepts of icon, index, and symbol to the interpretation of architecture and the built environment. Many of these studies focus on religious architecture ( Baron 2014 , 2016 ; Coben 2006 ; Fogelin 2014 , 2015 ; Schoenfelder 2011 ; Stanish 2012 ; Swenson 2018 ). Other interesting applications include the houses of missionaries in nineteenth-century southern Africa ( Crossland 2013 ), changing site plans in the wake of the Pueblo Revolt ( Liebmann 2008 ), and conflicting ideologies of house configuration at a nineteenth-century commune in Massachusetts ( Preucel 2006 , chapter 8).
Finally, the concepts of icon, index, and symbol are also applicable to the study of the human body and human remains. Crossland (2009 , 2018 ; Crossland & Bauer 2017 ) has focused on forensic contexts, such as cranial reconstruction, fingerprinting, and forensic entomology. Forensic specialists interpret this evidence as indexical signs (in a cause–effect relation), which allows them to make a claim of scientific objectivity while sometimes obscuring uncertainty or the sign's possibly arbitrary (symbolic) relation to its object. Barrett (2019) applies similar ideas to the study of ancient DNA (aDNA) as a sign of population movements. Does this aDNA, he asks, iconically resemble an ancient population, thereby signifying mass migration, or is it merely indexical, leaving room for more complex processes?
Finally, we turn to Peirce's description of the interpretant. Note that interpretants are not interpreters—they are not human beings or even plants and animals. Interpretants are mediated responses or habits. Peirce applied his phenomenological categories to the relationship between signs and interpretants: The sign might provoke a sense of possibility (a rheme), it might be a sign of actual existence (a dicent), or it might formulate a general law (an argument) ( Peirce 1998 , p. 292).
Interpretants themselves can exist in different forms, to be read as signs in different ways (see Peirce 1998 , p. 409). First, interpretants can be emotional—what Crossland (2014 , p. 73) calls affective—that is, they can be raw, unreflected feelings. Second, interpretants can be energetic, that is, some sort of physical response or focused attention. Third, interpretants can be logical—what Crossland (2014 , p. 73) calls habitual — that is, they can be governed by law or habit (see Preucel & Bauer 2001 , p. 93). As with Peirce's other trichotomies, these categories are hierarchical: A logical interpretant presupposes energetic interpretants, which presuppose emotional interpretants. Crossland (2013 , p. 105) explores this diversity of interpretant possibilities in the shaping and building of a house, noting that these possibilities cannot all be articulated in language. Swenson (2018) also observes how these types of interpretants seem to overlap in the case of graffiti in the Huaca Colorada, a pre-Columbian Moche temple in Peru. These seemingly unauthorized incised images likely provoked an emotional response, leading to the energetic creation of additional graffiti images, which over time became habitual community practice.
Several authors focus in particular on the logical interpretant of Peirce's trichotomy and its habitual nature. Preucel & Bauer (2001) , for example (see also Preucel 2006 , chapter 8), use this concept to explain the long-recognized durability of material culture meanings (see Hodder 1989 , p. 73). They compare the logical interpretant to Bourdieu's concept of the habitus, in that both concepts refer to the ways that people regularly engage with the material by drawing on previous experiences, whether consciously or not (see also Gokee 2016 ). Crossland (2013 , pp. 94–95; 2014 , p. 83) similarly relates these concepts but notes that the logical interpretant results not only in habits formed but also in habits changed after the encounter with new, different material configurations. Old habits die hard, however, and Crossland explores the semiotic delay experienced by missionaries in nineteenth-century southern Africa in their recognition of the ritual landscape. Other applications of this Peircean idea of habit include Lele's (2006) examination of rosary beads and stone walls in Ireland, Cipolla's (2016 , 2018) description of the habitual piling of stones in New England, Bauer's (2013b) consideration of habitual engagements between communities of the Bronze Age Black Sea, and Gokee's (2016) differentiation between habitual and conscious aspects of pottery production.

A tomb built to hold the dead is an interpretant that anticipates future mourners and future commemoration of the dead” ( Crossland & Bauer 2017 , p. 8).

Section: PEIRCE, MATERIALITY, AND LANGUAGE

Peirce's semiotic as well as his other philosophical ideas are highly relevant to archaeology's recent turn toward materiality. This stance seeks a greater appreciation for the importance of physical things in social life. Under this heading, Cipolla (2018) includes “object agency,” “entanglement theory,” “symmetrical archaeology,” “new materialism,” “object-oriented ontologies,” “posthumanism,” “assemblage theory” and “flat ontology.” These ideas in archaeology mirror greater trends in anthropology sometimes referred to as the “ontological turn,” heavily inspired by sociology's actor–network theory (e.g., Callon 1986 ; e.g., Callon & Latour 1981 , Latour 2005 ). These approaches question the traditional division between humans and nonhumans, between nature and culture, and between social and material (see Kohn 2015 ). Instead, they argue that humans and nonhumans (including plants, animals, objects, ideas, institutions, and energy flows) all exist as an assemblage of social relations (networks or entanglements) and that the analysis of these networks should not necessarily prioritize the human point of view. In this view, humans are not the only entities that have agency—objects, for example, can also make things happen in the world.
As Cipolla (2018 , p. 65) notes, this theoretical shift bears many similarities to Peirce's doctrine of synechism—metaphysical continuity—which also sought to break down traditional philosophical dualities between subject and object, mind and matter. Peirce's phenomenology of firstness, secondness, and thirdness also applies to these new approaches, particularly in considering object agency. Crossland & Bauer (2017) argue that the “obdurate” quality of material objects is similar to Peirce's concept of secondness:
the stone that trips you, the door that bars entrance, the traces of past human action that last and endure into the present. This amounts to an acknowledgment of the capacity of the material to intervene in human representational and discursive worlds, the ability of the material world to shape and form representations, a form of “secondness” in Peirce's terms. (p. 9)
But this sense of agency, according to Barrett (2014) , must be contrasted with thirdness—that is, thought, habit, regularity, and law. He argues that thirdness is necessary to life forms in a way that it is not critical to machines or other nonorganisms; organisms can grow, survive, and reproduce only by interacting with their external environments in ways that detect and analyze regularities of danger and resource acquisition. He cautions that a commitment to treat materials and organisms equally risks missing this important distinction. Applying the semiotic to object agency, Preucel (2006 , pp. 55–56, 203) sees objects as agents in their role as signs with the ability to generate interpretants (see also Watts 2008 ).
While synechism and phenomenology are relevant to these new materialist approaches, some archaeologists, being familiar only with Peirce's theory of signs, have held the impression, articulated by Harris, that Peirce “seems to sustain, rather than challenge, the ongoing representationalist bias in archaeology” ( Harris & Cipolla 2017 , p. 210). Indeed, if one considers only the semiotic, Peirce does seem to maintain an “ontological barrier between living and nonliving” things ( Harris & Cipolla 2017 , p. 209) because an interpretant is necessary within the triadic sign relation in order for semiosis to occur. Yet while Peirce often focused on interpretants as human mental phenomena, he also saw semiosis as a property of the world more generally, as in the case of crystals (see Watts 2008 , p. 191). The reluctance of some authors to wed materialist approaches to Peircean philosophy may be due in part to the legacy of the structuralist and poststructuralist text analogy popular in archaeology in the 1980s and 1990s. Symmetrical archaeologists in particular ( Olsen 2003 , 2007 ; Olsen et al. 2012 ; Shanks 2007 ; Webmoor 2007 ; Witmore 2007 ) have been highly critical of this approach. “Although the textual analogy was important and productive, we come to ignore the differences between things and text: that material culture is in the world and plays a fundamentally different constitutive role for our being in this world than texts and language” ( Olsen 2003 , p. 90, original emphasis).
But Preucel (2006 , p. 257) as well as Crossland & Bauer (2017 , pp. 8–9) argue that in their attempt to open up their understanding of the social world to include nonhumans, approaches like Olsen's remain caught in the division between people and things that they are trying to break down. They argue that this continued division arises from their reliance on the dyadic Saussurian model of the sign and that it would be more productive to “consider social relationships as mediated by things in a triadic relation where people, things, and words in various combinations can all function as signs, objects, and interpretants depending upon the semiotic context” ( Preucel 2006 , p. 257). Crossland (2019) lays out an explicit contrast between the text analogy of Derrida and the Peircean semiotic, using stone as an example. She argues that texture, size, heft, and location—all the material properties of so much interest within new materialist approaches—are themselves interpretants of a sequence of signs (see also Chumley 2017 ). Ultimately, we cannot access these properties directly, but only perceive them through mediated semiosis. While both Derrida and Peirce believed that all experience is mediated, Peirce saw this mediation not only in discursive (textual) signs but also through physical, tangible things (see also Crossland & Bauer 2017 ).
A commitment to Peircean synechism would suggest that language (including texts) and objects are all part of a continuous whole. So it makes sense that semiotic anthropologists—particularly linguists—have long been applying Peirce's ideas to the material world as well as to language. Silverstein's (1976) article is seminal to this branch of anthropology, and his subsequent work, and that of his followers, is highly relevant to archaeology (see Preucel 2006 , Preucel & Bauer 2001 ). Parmentier (1997) , for example, points out that the distinction between words and things that has occupied so much archaeological theory is in fact a culturally specific model. In fact, he argues, objects and language cannot really be separated from each other:
[O]bjects are implicated in language at every turn, for instance by being themselves bearers of linguistic signs (e.g., and inscribed stone), by representing linguistic performance (e.g., a religious icon depicting Christ's extended arm), by being labeled by language (e.g., a titled painting), by being contextually surrounded by linguistic utterances (e.g., a ritual offering), or by being produced according to textualized instructions (a technological instrument). ( Parmentier 1997 , p. 43)
Thus, if we accept that objects have agency by being able to generate interpretants, at least part of this agency is itself the result of linguistic activity. Silverstein (1976) defined a category of linguistic behavior he called “metapragmatics,” whereby people characterize or comment on the indexical functions of language (for example, by praising someone's eloquence or mocking their accent). This concept can be extended to include language that comments on the indexical function of objects, such as the appropriateness of a taxi driver's attire ( Agha 2007 , p. 254; Silverstein 1993 , p. 36). Semiotic anthropologists have used these insights to apply Peirce's semiotic to other examples of material culture, showing how language establishes objects’ semiotic function in such varied cases as the qualia of porcelain ( Gal 2017 ) or prestige comestibles such as wine ( Silverstein 2013 ), the materiality of a house and of cloth ( Keane 2003 , 2005 ), and the use of different objects as monetary exchange media ( Agha 2017 , Keane 2010 ).
These contributions are valuable to archaeologists because they remind us that “we cannot avoid the fact that material meanings are articulated through language” ( Preucel 2006 , p. 256) or that the very material properties that we find so compelling may or may not have been important for people in the past, depending on the linguistic signs that defined and characterized them. Thus, to the extent possible, archaeologists should embrace linguistic evidence in the interpretation of the past. In my own work ( Baron 2014 , 2016 ), I have explicitly adopted some of Silverstein's terminology, analyzing hieroglyphic texts as metapragmatic discourses about ancient Maya temples and religious objects. Other authors have also used inscriptional evidence to explore the iconic, indexical, and symbolic significance of temples, statues, and standing stones ( Crossland 2014 , 2019 ; Fogelin 2014 , 2015 ; Schoenfelder 2011 ). Those working in more recent periods use historical information—including linguistic signs—in a Peircean semiotic analysis of material culture ( Agbe-Davies 2016 ; Capone & Preucel 2002 ; Cipolla 2013 , 2018 ; Fogelin 2014 , 2015 ; Gokee 2016 ; Lele 2006 ; Pugh 2013 ).
In sum, a combination of Peirce's semiotic with his doctrine of synechism, his methodological pragmatism, and his phenomenology of firstness, secondness, and thirdness offers a compelling answer to the critiques and challenges posed by new materialist approaches. While I have urged archaeologists to embrace linguistic evidence as part of a synechist whole, even archaeologists without written texts can benefit from Peirce's insights, as the next section shows.

Section: PEIRCE AND THE PALEOLITHIC

Persistent questions in the study of human evolution and paleolithic archaeology include what counts as modern human behavior, when and where this behavior began, how it can be detected archaeologically, and whether behaviors that are archaeologically detectable correspond to fully developed language capabilities. Cognitive archaeology—or the study of “past ways of thought as inferred through material remains” ( Renfrew 1994 , p. 3)—has approached these problems by proposing that certain behaviors evident in the archaeological record, such as complex tool use, body ornamentation, and figural art, are indicative of the human mind's ability to think symbolically and therefore as capable of language.
Preucel (2006 , chapter 7) provides a summary of the history of cognitive archaeology and its relationships to semiotic theories, including early uses of Peirce ( Deacon 1997 , Wynn 1995 ). He concludes with a description of material engagement theory ( Malafouris 2004 ; Renfrew 2001 , 2004 ; see also Renfrew et al. 2008 ). This approach seeks to “overcome the mind/matter duality by stressing the knowledge-based nature of human action” ( Renfrew 2004 , p. 23). While material engagement theory has obvious affiliations with Peirce's philosophy, especially his doctrine of synechism and his theory of signs, none of these publications mention Peirce explicitly.
More recent archaeologists, on the other hand, have taken an explicitly Peircean approach to the study of modern human behavior. In particular, this group has critiqued recent interpretations of material from Blombos Cave, South Africa. At this site, dating to 75,000 years ago and earlier, researchers recovered shell beads and other artifacts, which they interpreted as evidence for fully symbolic human behavior ( d'Errico et al. 2005 ). But others, drawing on Peirce, have argued that symbolism is not a good description of early humans’ semiotic behaviors and instead argue that the earliest examples of signification, including the Blombos beads, were likely iconic and indexical ( Barrett 2013 ; Garofoli & Iliopoulos 2019 ; Hodgson 2014 ; Hodgson & Pettitt 2018 ; Iliopoulos 2016a , b , 2019 , 2020 ; Kissel & Fuentes 2017 ). These authors explore how these earlier significative modes may have scaffolded the gradual accumulation of human semiotic activity, eventually including symbolic language.
Hodgson (2014) questions whether iconicity (typically regarded as the most fundamental kind of semiotic ground) might not in fact be preceded by indexicality. After all, an indexical ground can be based on simple copresence, whereas an iconic ground requires the recognition of similarity and is thus more abstract. This position is supported by the observation that iconic figural representation appears to postdate early examples of indexical signs such as those of Blombos Cave ( Hodgson & Pettitt 2018 ).
Barrett (2013) connects Peirce's triadic sign relation to empathy—the emotional response of an observer who recognizes in another organism's response to a sign (interpretant) the same response that they might have under similar circumstances (p. 8). This empathetic thirdness, he argues, was made possible by evolutionary developments, such as increased manual dexterity, which allowed for greater exploration of material qualities, and changes in eye coloration, which allowed an observer to recognize the direction of gaze (p. 11). These developments allowed for the recognition of common identity and spurred further cognitive development, even before the development of fully symbolic language.
Iliopoulos (2016a , b , 2019 , 2020 ; Garofoli & Iliopoulos 2019 ) explicitly merges material engagement theory, especially as articulated by Malafouris, with Peircean philosophy—he notes ( Iliopoulos 2016b , p. 117) the similarities between Peirce's doctrine of synechism and Malafouris's idea of the “extended mind”—that is, that the mind is not coterminous with the brain, but rather emerges out of the engagement between brains, bodies, and external objects ( Malafouris 2004 , p. 58). Iliopoulos (2016a , p. 249) also shows the similarity between Peirce's triadic sign relation and Renfrew's (2004) idea that the materiality of objects precedes their significative content.
As scientific advances and new finds continue to reveal precocious significative behaviors in the human lineage, Peirce's insights will likely become even more relevant. In particular, his semiotic gives us a framework for describing early human semiosis, and his doctrine of synechism merges the human mind with the material world.

Section: CONCLUSION

In this article, I have laid out what I see as the key components of Peirce's philosophy as they relate to archaeological theory: his doctrine of synechism, that all things are continuous; his methodological pragmatism, that the meaning of an idea can be judged by its practical consequences; his concept of abductive logic, the flash of insight; his phenomenology of firstness, secondness, and thirdness; and finally, his semiotic, the theory of signs. Each of these components has been used individually by archaeologists, but together, they make up a powerful network of linked ideas that can transform the way we understand materiality, the emergence of humans, and the archaeological record as a whole.
I have also acknowledged that Peirce's work is both immense and difficult to read, and I have endeavored to point the reader to specific texts in which these key ideas may be found. As more archaeologists read Peirce's works, I expect that they may find more useful insights. But Cipolla (in Harris & Cipolla 2017 , p. 211) reminds us that we do not have to accept the ideas of Peirce, or any philosopher for that matter, in toto. In fact, Peirce as a man had many personal failings and biases ( Brent 1998 )—he should not be fetishized. Let us then apply Peirce's ideas to the full extent of their utility. It is through these practical consequences, after all, that their meaning will emerge.
