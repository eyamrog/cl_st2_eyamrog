Section: Abstract

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediates formation of membraneless condensates such as those associated with RNA processing, but the rules that dictate their assembly, substructure, and coexistence with other liquid-like compartments remain elusive. Here, we address the biophysical mechanism of this multiphase organization using quantitative reconstitution of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) with attached P-bodies in human cells. Protein-interaction networks can be viewed as interconnected complexes (nodes) of RNA-binding domains (RBDs), whose integrated RNA-binding capacity determines whether LLPS occurs upon RNA influx. Surprisingly, both RBD-RNA specificity and disordered segments of key proteins are non-essential, but modulate multiphase condensation. Instead, stoichiometry-dependent competition between protein networks for connecting nodes determines SG and P-body composition and miscibility, while competitive binding of unconnected proteins disengages networks and prevents LLPS. Inspired by patchy colloid theory, we propose a general framework by which competing networks give rise to compositionally specific and tunable condensates, while relative linkage between nodes underlies multiphase organization.

Section: Introduction, Literature Review

Eukaryotic cells coordinate their biochemical reactions using organelles. In addition to traditional membrane-enclosed organelles, cells feature a vast array of membraneless compartments, which exhibit substructure and form interfaces with each other. Unlike those of the nucleus (e.g., nucleoli, speckles) ( Mao et al., 2011; Nizami et al., 2010; Zhu and Brangwynne, 2015 59. Mao, Y.S. ∙ Zhang, B. ∙ Spector, D.L.

Recent studies suggest that the physics of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) dictate the formation of these droplet-like structures ( Brangwynne et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012 14.

Phase transitions in the assembly of multivalent signalling proteins Nature. 2012; 483 :336-340 Crossref Scopus (717) PubMed Google Scholar ), which are increasingly referred to as condensates ( Banani et al., 2017; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 3.

Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 Crossref Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, despite a flurry of recent attention, the molecular rules that account for their unique protein and nucleic acid compositions and “multiphase” patterning remain elusive.
Similarities between proteins essential for assembly of diverse condensates may inform the molecular origins of their formation and compositional specificity. Many of these proteins feature a modular organization with a structured self-oligomerization domain (OD), intrinsically disordered region (IDR), and substrate-binding moiety ( Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016 65. Mitrea, D.M. ∙ Kriwacki, R.W. Phase separation in biology; functional organization of a higher order Cell Commun. Signal. 2016; 14 :1 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A). In the case of RNA-dependent condensates, essential proteins feature an RNA-binding domain (RBD) with a folded, sequence-specific region (e.g., RNA recognition motif [RRM]) and/or a promiscuous, low-affinity arginine-rich motif (e.g., Arg-Gly-Gly [RGG], Ser-Arg [SR]) ( Chong et al., 2018 19.

In principle, compositional specificity might be encoded by unique RBD-RNA interactions combined with stable self-oligomerization or additive weakly interacting IDR stickers (“self-associating IDRs”), both of which are sufficient for LLPS in vitro ( Feric et al., 2016; Frey et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2012; Mitrea et al., 2016; Molliex et al., 2015; Nott et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015 29.

Whether this is the case for the vastly more complex condensates of the crowded intracellular environment is unclear, particularly given that many RBDs (e.g., RGG) and self-associating IDRs lack strong substrate discriminatory abilities.

These micron-sized RNA-protein droplets form in mammalian cells upon translational arrest and subsequent polysome disassembly, which releases exposed RNA into the cytoplasm (“RNA influx”) ( Boeynaems et al., 2017; Kedersha et al., 1999, 2002, 2016; Kroschwald et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016; Wippich et al., 2013 9.

G3BP1 is a tunable switch that triggers phase separation to assemble stress granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although it features the modular architecture described above ( Figure 1 B), why G3BP is important for SG biogenesis relative to other abundant RBPs, and the mechanisms by which compositional specificity and multiphase coexistence of SGs/PBs are encoded, remain to be determined.
Here, we use quantitative live cell reconstitution and biochemical assays, along with network concepts from graph theory and the study of “patchy” colloids, to dissect the relative contributions of oligomerization, RNA binding, and protein disorder in multiphase SG/PB condensation. We show that the constitutive G3BP dimer, as well as its high-affinity binding partner UBAP2L, serve as interaction nodes to collectively confer the high number of RNA-binding contacts (RBD “valence”) needed to form a condensed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) network following RNA influx. Binding partners that lack RBDs act as “valence caps” on the G3BP node, disengaging its protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, thus decreasing RNA-binding capacity and abrogating SG assembly. We show that G3BP’s IDRs do not self-interact but rather modulate RNA binding via relative juxtaposition of a repulsive acidic region (see also accompanying papers Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020 33. Guillén-Boixet, J. ∙ Kopach, A. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ...

G3BP1 is a tunable switch that triggers phase separation to assemble stress granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differentiation between PBs and SGs is context dependent, as changes in node stoichiometry create unique condensates that do not conform to any one description of a canonical RNP body. We propose that similar competing protein interaction networks are a ubiquitous mechanism by which cells spatiotemporally modulate multiphase coexistence and associated substrate processing.

Section: Results

To elucidate the molecular rules of SG assembly and multiphase coexistence with PBs ( Figure 1 A), we began by examining the minimal components required for SG assembly. In wild-type (WT) human U2OS cells, arsenite (As) treatment (400 μM, 1 h) causes the formation of PB-attached SGs ( Figure 1 C). Conversely, G3BP1 and G3BP2 (G3BP1/2) double knockout (G3BP KO) cells do not exhibit As-induced SGs, but form PBs ( Figures 1 D, 1E, S1 A, and S1B; Kedersha et al., 2005, 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J.

Stress granules and processing bodies are dynamically linked sites of mRNP remodeling J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169 :871-884 Crossref Scopus (900) PubMed Google Scholar ). A concentration threshold characterizes systems that undergo LLPS ( Boeynaems et al., 2018; Brangwynne et al., 2015 8. Boeynaems, S. ∙ Alberti, S. ∙ Fawzi, N.L. ... Protein Phase Separation: A New Phase in Cell Biology Trends Cell Biol. 2018; 28 :420-435 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Brangwynne, C.P. ∙ Tompa, P. ∙ Pappu, R.V. Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions Nat. Phys. 2015; 11 :899-904 Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar ), raising the question of whether this is valid for G3BP-mediated SGs. Live cell microscopy reveals that G3BP KO cells stably expressing ectopic G3BP at low concentrations (0–0.6 μM) never exhibit microscopically detectable SGs following As treatment, but upon exceeding ~0.6 μM, SGs become observable in nearly all cells ( Figures 1 F and S1 A–S1E). No G3BP isoform causes SG assembly in the absence of stress, and micro-injection of RNase prevents their formation ( Figure 1 K), both of which are consistent with an essential role for RNA influx ( Bounedjah et al., 2014 11.

Studies show that G3BP is dimeric, as is its isolated NTF2-like domain (hereafter, NTF2) ( Figures 1 B and 2 D; Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020; Kedersha et al., 2016; Kristensen, 2015; Panas et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2020; Tourrière et al., 2003; Vognsen et al., 2013 33.

To examine the necessity of individual G3BP regions, we expressed a series of deletion constructs, determining concentration thresholds for SG formation (+/− As). Both dimerization and RNA binding (via RRM or RGG) are essential for G3BP’s central role in SG assembly, as SGs form in As-treated cells expressing ΔRRM or ΔRGG, but not ΔRBD (both RRM and RGG are deleted) or ΔNTF2 (no dimers) ( Figures 1 G, 1H, and S1 F–S1I). However, for ΔRGG, SGs are smaller and the threshold for rescue is higher, which may account for divergence from previous studies ( Bley et al., 2015; Kedersha et al., 2016; Matsuki et al., 2013 7.

Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation Genes Cells. 2013; 18 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). The requirement for the NTF2 and RBD correlates with their ability to partition into SGs in WT cells ( Figure 1 I), which reflects interaction preference for RNPs in the SG network relative to the bulk cytoplasm.
Self-associating IDRs are implicated as key drivers of LLPS ( Ruff et al., 2019 82. Ruff, K.M. ∙ Pappu, R.V. ∙ Holehouse, A.S.

However, for G3BP, removal of either acidic IDR1 or both IDR1 and IDR2 (IDR1/2) causes only a minor shift in its threshold for LLPS ( Figure 1 G). Surprisingly, unlike ΔIDR1/2, deletion of just the proline-rich IDR2 blocks rescue of SG defects, suggesting a modulatory role for relative domain juxtaposition. As both IDR1 and IDR2 fail to partition into SGs, while presence of acidic IDR1 decreases partitioning of diverse fragments ( Figure 1 I), we hypothesized that its high negative charge causes electrostatic repulsion of RNA, the most abundant biomolecular component in SGs ( Bounedjah et al., 2014 11. Bounedjah, O. ∙ Desforges, B. ∙ Wu, T.-D. ... Free mRNA in excess upon polysome dissociation is a scaffold for protein multimerization to form stress granules Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :8678-8691 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, ΔIDR2 and ΔRBD similarly lack the ability to bind rRNA-rich 40S ribosomes ( Figure 1 J).
Our findings underscore the importance of G3BP dimerization and RNA binding in SG condensation. A simple physical picture is that RBD dimers “cross-link” exposed RNA following polysome disassembly. To test this, we replaced G3BP’s NTF2 with synthetic light-activated (iLID- and sspB- [iLID/sspB]) ( Guntas et al., 2015 34. Guntas, G. ∙ Hallett, R.A. ∙ Zimmerman, S.P. ...

USA. 2015; 112 :112-117 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ) or constitutive (FKBP) ( Rollins et al., 2000 80. Rollins, C.T. ∙ Rivera, V.M. ∙ Woolfson, D.N. ... A ligand-reversible dimerization system for controlling protein-protein interactions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :7096-7101 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ) dimerization domains. Unexpectedly, stable expression of either full-length (FL) G3BP dimer mimetic failed to rescue SGs at concentrations greatly exceeding physiological values ( Figures 1 L and S1 J). In parallel, we transiently expressed iLID/sspB-ΔNTF2 using Lipofectamine. In cells with both components at far higher concentrations than achieved with tolerated stable expression, SGs are observed ( Figure S1 J). This concentration threshold (20 μM) is > 30× that of FL G3BP (0.6 μM) ( Figures 1 G, S1 D, and S1J). We cannot rule out the possibility that high levels of plasmid-encoded mRNA and cationic Lipofectamine, which can induce interferon signaling and SG assembly in WT cells, contribute to this effect ( Guo et al., 2019; Hagen et al., 2015; Panas et al., 2019; Tourrière et al., 2003 35.

Thus, NTF2-mediated dimerization of the RBD is necessary, but not sufficient, for SG formation at physiological G3BP concentrations (~1.8 μM in HeLa cytoplasm, Hein et al., 2015 37.

From work with patchy colloids ( Bianchi et al., 2011 5. Bianchi, E. ∙ Blaak, R. ∙ Likos, C.N. Patchy colloids: state of the art and perspectives Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2011; 13 :6397-6410 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ), a system of interacting particles can only phase separate into a dynamically connected network if each particle has a sufficient number of sites to engage other particles, which defines its valence, v ( Figure 1 M); here, the “particle” (or “vertex” in graph theory) represents an individual protein, RNA, or stable complex. Generally speaking, v >2 are essential, with higher valences more readily driving LLPS. In the case of synthetic G3BP dimers ( Figure 1 L), there are only two interaction interfaces, and they thus feature overall v =2 (two RBD-RNA interfaces); we refer to v =2 particles as “bridges,” which might contribute to phase separation by linking higher-valence particles, but cannot on their own form a space-spanning interaction network ( Figure 1 M).
Given that a generic dimerization domain cannot replace G3BP’s NTF2, we reasoned that rather than a bridge ( v =2), the G3BP dimer embodies a particle of v ≥3; we refer to such objects as “nodes” ( Figure 1 M). In the case of an endogenous G3BP dimer, such valence would be achieved by at least one heterotypic PPI with the NTF2 domains, in addition to the two RBDs. If so, NTF2 might serve as an interaction platform for additional RNA-binding nodes and amplify the overall valence—and hence RNA-binding capacity—of the resulting complex ( Figure 2 A). To screen for such SG proteins, we harnessed NTF2’s dimerization abilities in the context of a two-component optogenetic biotechnology known as Corelets ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Corelets are comprised of a 24-mer ferritin “core” coated by iLID molecules, which acts as an oligomerization platform following blue light-stimulated sspB-iLID interactions ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). By changing the relative concentration of the two components, the oligomerization state (valence) can be varied (0 to 24) and intracellular phase diagrams can be mapped ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that NTF2 dimers would form homotypic links between cores and cause condensation, allowing microscopy-based identification of heterotypic NTF2-interacting partners by their relative partitioning ( Figure 2 A). In a panel of abundant ( Table S1 ) and frequently studied GFP-tagged SG (n = 20) and PB (n = 3) proteins, only eight SG proteins (USP10, UBAP2L, CAPRIN1, FMR1, FXR1, NUFIP2, G3BP1, and G3BP2A) partition strongly into NTF2 condensates (G3BPΔRBD Corelets) ( Figure 2 B). These proteins are specific to NTF2 interactions, as they are not observed in a non-SG Corelet condensate (FUS IDR) ( Figure S2 A). To validate these proposed NTF2-binding partners, we performed biochemical studies, finding that G3BP-mediated co-immunoprecipitation (“co-IP”) of USP10, CAPRIN1, and UBAP2L all require its NTF2 domain; as interactions are preserved following RNase and stringent washing, we refer to these as “high affinity” ( Figure 2 C). Conversely, FMR1 and FXR1, which assemble into dimers ( Adinolfi et al., 2003; Dolzhanskaya et al., 2006 1. Adinolfi, S. ∙ Ramos, A. ∙ Martin, S.R. ... The N-terminus of the fragile X mental retardation protein contains a novel domain involved in dimerization and RNA binding Biochemistry. 2003; 42 :10437-10444 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 23.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119 :1933-1946 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), co-IP with UBAP2L, but not G3BP and CAPRIN1, allowing us to infer the existence of distinct high-affinity protein complexes ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
We reasoned that the identified proteins might serve as G3BP-interacting bridges or nodes to contribute additional, essential RNA-binding interfaces (valence) for condensing the SG RNP network; we note that all but USP10 have RBDs. To investigate this, we generated a series of single- and multi-KO U2OS cell lines. KO of USP10, CAPRIN1, NUFIP2, FXR1/FXR2/FMR1 (3KO), or FXR1/FXR2/FMR1/NUFIP2 (4KO) had no effect on SG formation ( Figures 2 F and 2G). USP10 and CAPRIN1 are unlikely to play major roles in SG condensation at endogenous levels in U2OS cells, as associated G3BP 3KOs (G3BP1/G3BP2/USP10, G3BP1/G3BP2/CAPRIN1) require similar concentrations of G3BP for rescue relative to 2KO ( Figure 2 F). In contrast, UBAP2/2L 2KO results in smaller SGs, which form in only a minority of cells ( Figure 2 G), a finding supported by others ( Cirillo et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Markmiller et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Youn et al., 2018 20.

Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since UBAP2/2L 2KO has no effect on CAPRIN1 and G3BP1 levels and only slightly reduces USP10 and G3BP2 ( Figure S2 E), these data suggest that UBAP2/2L (hereafter, paralogs referred to as “UBAP2L”) might act as a critical G3BP-associated node. In strong support of this hypothesis, we serendipitously discovered a missense mutation in G3BP’s NTF2 domain (S38F), which blocks its ability to rescue SG formation ( Figure 2 H). G3BP S38F forms dimers ( Figures 2 D and S2 D), binds USP10 ( Figure S2 C), and partitions strongly into SGs when expressed with WT G3BP ( Figure S2 B). However, the S38F variant is unable to form high-affinity complexes with CAPRIN1 or UBAP2L ( Figure 2 I), suggesting that the mutation changes G3BP from a v ≥3 node to a v =2 bridge, which no longer engages required valence from UBAP2L. Importantly, a previously identified G3BP NTF2 variant (F33W) ( Kedersha et al., 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ) retains association with UBAP2L, but not USP10 or CAPRIN1 ( Figure 2 I), yet displays a similar threshold concentration for rescue as WT ( Figure 2 H). Taken together, these data provide compelling support for G3BP-UBAP2L complexes playing an essential role in SG condensation by virtue of their node identities ( Figure 2 J).
Having identified NTF2-interacting proteins that may contribute RBD valence to the G3BP complex, we turned to investigate the role of USP10, the only identified partner without an RBD. We hypothesized that USP10 competes with RBPs (e.g., UBAP2L) for NTF2 binding and effectively “caps” the G3BP node; reduction of the overall valence of the complex would disrupt the formation of a space-spanning network ( Figure 3 A). To test this “valence capping” model, we examined the effect of USP10 concentration on G3BP-dependent SG formation. Building on qualitative studies ( Kedersha et al., 2016; Panas et al., 2015 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Panas, M.D. ∙ Schulte, T. ∙ Thaa, B. ... Viral and cellular proteins containing FGDF motifs bind G3BP to block stress granule formation PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 :e1004659 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), competitive inhibition experiments in G3BP KO cells indicate that USP10 impacts the G3BP rescue threshold as a function of stoichiometry, with a slope of ~1 (i.e., cells require excess G3BP relative to USP10 to form SGs) ( Figures 3 B, 3C, and S3 F). This is consistent with G3BP monomer binding a single USP10 molecule, which disengages other RBPs from its NTF2 interface. Expression of USP10’s NTF2-interaction motif (“NIM,” amino acids 1–33) results in identical inhibition (slope~1) ( Figures 3 B, S3 B, and S3C), indicating that FL USP10 does not act as a bridge between G3BP and other SG components. A panel of controls (n = 15 proteins) demonstrates specificity of inhibition to USP10 ( Figure S3 A), and optogenetic approaches support an NTF2-dependent mechanism of action ( Figures S3 D and S3E).
Previous work speculated that differential USP10 versus CAPRIN1 binding toggle G3BP between conformations that inhibit or promote RNP condensation ( Kedersha et al., 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, our valence capping model proposes that USP10 acts as a v =1 interactor (“cap”) that decreases the overall valence of the G3BP complex. This hypothesis makes a specific and testable prediction: NTF2-binding bridges and nodes ( v ≥2) will similarly inhibit SG formation if their RBDs are removed, such that they too become caps ( v =1) ( Figure 1 M). Informed by G3BP interaction domain-mapping studies ( Baumgartner et al., 2013; Solomon et al., 2007; Youn et al., 2018 4. Baumgartner, R. ∙ Stocker, H. ∙ Hafen, E.

Predicted bridges and bystanders have no effect on G3BP rescue (slope~0), whereas both CAPRIN1 and UBAP2L caps inhibit (positive slope) ( Figures 3 D, 3G, and S3 B). The UBAP2L NIM cap is a less potent inhibitor than that of USP10 or CAPRIN1, which agrees with co-IP studies assessing relative binding of the FL proteins to G3BP ( Figure 2 C) and illustrates that degree of valence capping is dependent on relative interaction strengths ( Figure 3 A).
Although disfavored by prior work ( Panas et al., 2015, 2014; Schulte et al., 2016 73. Panas, M.D. ∙ Ahola, T. ∙ McInerney, G.M. The C-terminal repeat domains of nsP3 from the Old World alphaviruses bind directly to G3BP J. Virol. 2014; 88 :5888-5893 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 75.

Schulte, T. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Panas, M.D. ... Combined structural, biochemical and cellular evidence demonstrates that both FGDF motifs in alphavirus nsP3 are required for efficient replication Open Biol. 2016; 6 :160078 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), an alternative explanation is that USP10 disrupts NTF2 dimers. To test this, we generated a USP10 NIM doublet to change it from a cap ( v =1) to a bridge ( v =2, “NIMx2”), reasoning that if NIM disrupts G3BP dimers, NIMx2 would link two G3BP monomers into a complex with insufficient valence ( v =2) for condensation ( Figure 3 E). Inconsistent with this model, expression of NIMx2 in WT cells causes formation of granules in the absence of stress ( Figure 3 E). Examination of KO cells (+/− As) co-expressing NIMx2 and G3BP deletions revealed that both NTF2 and RNA binding are required ( Figures 3 F and 3G), which signifies a requisite amplification of RNA-binding valence. Strikingly, NIMx2 displays “reentrant” properties, promoting SG formation at low ratios relative to G3BP and inhibiting at high (>3) ( Figures 3 E–3G and S3 B). This reentrant phase transition likely results from a lack of available NIM-free G3BP for polymerization ( Figure 3 E) and can be recapitulated using an engineered system ( Figure S3 G). Taken together, these data negate the possibility that USP10 disrupts G3BP dimers, but instead favors a valence-capping model ( Figure 3 H).
Our data suggest that highly multivalent RNA-binding complexes are necessary for SG condensation, but a stringent test of this model requires experimental control of RBD valence ( v RBD ). To quantitatively interrogate the relationship between v RBD , protein complex concentration, and RNA availability, we again utilized the optogenetic Corelet system ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Replacing the dimerization domain (NTF2) of G3BP with sspB (“ΔNTF2 Corelets”) ( Figure 4 A), we find that non-stressed G3BP KO cells require a very high degree of RBD oligomerization ( v RBD ~24 at 0.15 μM Core) for LLPS ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Following As treatment (stress), LLPS occurs at lower core concentrations and valences ( v RBD ~8 at 0.15 μM Core), and the resulting granules are larger ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Stress-dependent LLPS occurs rapidly (seconds) and is reversible ( Figures 4 B and S4 A), indicating that multivalent RNA-binding contacts are essential for both SG formation and maintenance. Such condensates mimic the properties of endogenous SGs, including a dependence on RNA influx ( Figures 4 E–4H, S4 F, and S4G), recruitment of SG proteins and polyA+ mRNA with attachment of PBs ( Figure 4 J), and liquid-like dynamics ( Figures 4 C and 4D). We therefore refer to these structures as optogenetic SGs (opto-SGs).
The shift in the ΔNTF2 Corelet phase threshold after RNA influx can be visualized in As-treated cells subjected to repeated cycles of activation and deactivation, which triggers valence-dependent opto-SG assembly on a timescale similar to endogenous SGs ( Figures 4 H and S4 F). Such a shift is negated by pretreatment with cycloheximide, which blocks polysome disassembly and RNA influx ( Figures 4 E–4G and S4 G), and long-term inhibition of RNA transcription by Actinomycin D prevents opto-SG formation ( Figures 4 F and 4G). We emphasize that these drug-dependent changes in LLPS are not Corelet artifacts: similar threshold shifts are absent for self-associating FUS IDR Corelet condensates ( Figures S4 D and S4E), which do not recruit SG proteins ( Figure S2 A) and are thus not SGs; this is consistent with previous studies using an orthogonal Cry2-based optoDroplet approach ( Shin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2019 88.

Zhang, P. ∙ Fan, B. ∙ Yang, P. ... Chronic optogenetic induction of stress granules is cytotoxic and reveals the evolution of ALS-FTD pathology eLife. 2019; 8 :651 Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar ).
To determine the minimal G3BP domain for opto-SG LLPS, we examined ΔNTF2 Corelets with additional regions deleted. Consistent with a lack of SG partitioning ( Figure 1 I), G3BP’s central IDRs do not self-interact, as IDR1, IDR2, and IDR1/2 Corelets never cause LLPS (+/− As) ( Figures S4 H–S4K). In contrast, both G3BP RBD (RRM and RGG) and IDR2-RBD Corelets form polyA+ opto-SGs containing all tested SG proteins ( Figures 4 I, 4J, S4 B, and S4C). Underscoring its utility as a biotechnology, G3BP Corelets replicate several phenotypes of corresponding GFP-tagged deletions. First, ΔNTF2/ΔIDR2 (synthetic GFP-G3BPΔIDR2) fails to form granules (+/− As) ( Figure 4 I). Second, similar to GFP-ΔIDR1, ΔNTF2/ΔIDR1 forms irregular granules ( Figures 4 I and S4 C). Third, RBD-only Corelets feature a right shifted phase threshold relative to ΔNTF2 ( Figure 4 I). Finally, all such condensates are reversible, form multiphase structures with PBs, and similarly recruit SG proteins and polyA+ RNA ( Figures 4 J, S4 B, and S4C). Thus, Corelets recapitulate nearly all features of GFP-based rescue experiments (see also Figures S4 J and S4K) and represent a powerful synthetic approach for assessing the relationship between RBD valence, RBD identity, and SG/PB composition and coexistence.
Unlike synthetic dimers, highly multivalent G3BP RBD Corelets are sufficient to compensate for FL G3BP and assemble SGs. Given that G3BP is a constitutive RBD dimer, this finding is only biologically meaningful if interaction partners contribute additional RBD valence ( v RBD ) to the protein complex. If true, we reasoned that such G3BP NTF2-associated proteins would act similarly upon oligomerization of their RBDs, forming compositionally identical SGs that adhere to PBs ( Figure 5 A). To test this, we mapped phase diagrams for UBAP2L and CAPRIN1 RBD Corelets (G3BP KO, +/− As) ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Surprisingly, despite each featuring a single RGG, both RBDs are even more potent than G3BP RBD (1 RRM, 1 RGG) at enabling SG formation in both the Corelet system ( Figure 5 C) and when placed into GFP-G3BP chimeric proteins ( Figures 5 E and S5 J). Similar to G3BP RBD Corelets, As-induced RNA influx causes a shift in their associated phase thresholds and results in reversible, PB-studded opto-SGs with all tested markers ( Figures 5 C, 5D, and S5 ). However, both As-induced threshold shifts are minor relative to G3BP RBD ( Figure 4 F), which could potentially arise from self-interactions that contribute to LLPS. We refuted this possibility, as RNA depletion inhibits CAPRIN1 RBD LLPS ( Figure S5 A), as does scrambling its sequence ( Figure S5 C). We thus infer that NTF2-associated RBPs are indeed capable of contributing v RBD to the multi-protein G3BP complex.
It is conceivable that multivalent NTF2-associated RBDs are unique in engaging SG RNPs to form a condensed network that coexists with that of PBs. However, the RBD of FXR1, a dimeric RBP that interacts with UBAP2L but not NTF2 ( Figure 2 D), mimics G3BP RBD in all assays ( Figures 5 B–5E and S5 E–S5J). Remarkably, use of a large panel of additional Corelets (n = 25) indicates that high v RBD is sufficient for PB-studded, polyA+ SG assembly, irrespective of whether the RBD is folded (RRM) or unfolded (RGG), from an SG or PB protein, or linked to G3BP IDR ( Figures 5 F–5I and S5 E–S5G). Despite this RBD interchangeability, we surmise that RBD-RNA specificity and relative interaction strengths contribute to the lack of relationship between type and number of RNA-binding motifs and relative phase thresholds ( Figures 5 C and 5F–5H). Importantly, Corelets are capable of plugging into non-SG interaction networks, as those of DCP1A—a PB protein with PPIs but no RBD—recruit PB but not SG markers ( Figure 5 J). Thus, polyA+ SGs with attached PBs are the “default” multiphase condensate encoded by high-valence RBD nodes ( Figure 5 K).
Unlike other proteins, mild expression (<1 μM) of UBAP2L or FXR1 rescues SG defects in G3BP KO cells ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S6 A–S6C), implying that they can act as G3BP-independent SG nodes. We hypothesized that, in each of these cases, a self-associating domain would confer the requisite valence for node identity ( v ≥3). Although previous studies have indicated that such a domain (dimerization) exists for FXR1 ( Adinolfi et al., 2003; Dolzhanskaya et al., 2006 1. Adinolfi, S. ∙ Ramos, A. ∙ Martin, S.R. ...

Cell Sci. 2006; 119 :1933-1946 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), one has yet to be described for UBAP2L. Using a Corelet screen for PPI valence (n = 13 UBAP2L/CAPRIN1 fragments) ( Figure 6 C), we identified a non-dimeric ( Figure 6 H), self-associating IDR in UBAP2L (781–1087), which is essential for its ability to rescue SG defects in G3BP KO cells ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 D–S6G). We surmise that this “sticky” IDR facilitates weak interactions between UBAP2L proteins in separate high-affinity complexes (FXR1/UBAP2L, UBAP2L/G3BP), thus acting as an essential valence multiplier for SG formation ( Figure 6 E).

Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :1303-1318 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), super-resolution live cell microscopy revealed the presence of micro-phases (“cores”) within SGs ( Figure 6 G), which could provide insight into the rules governing phase miscibility. Since high-affinity UBAP2L complexes containing both FXR1 and G3BP are undetectable ( Figure 2 D), we hypothesized that the two dimeric nodes compete for available UBAP2L, with their relative stoichiometry critical for the observed mixed distribution in SGs by conventional confocal microscopy. Indeed, unlike UBAP2L, high ratios of FXR1 to G3BP cause demixing within SGs, as detected by G3BP-enriched and -depleted regions in individual granules ( Figures 6 F and S7 A–S7C).
We reasoned that node stoichiometry similarly impacts SG/PB coexistence. In agreement with this, overexpression of UBAP2L in G3BP KO cells causes the formation of condensates that are not canonical SGs or PBs, containing common markers of both ( Figures 6 H, S6A–S6C, and S6H–S6J). The collapse of many SG and PB components into a single miscible phase may result from UBAP2L’s high-affinity interaction with the essential PB node, DDX6 ( Figure 6 H), which forms complexes with many PB proteins ( Ayache et al., 2015; Brandmann et al., 2018; Kamenska et al., 2016; Ohn et al., 2008; Ozgur et al., 2015; Youn et al., 2018 2.

Intriguingly, DDX6 is weakly recruited to SGs in WT cells, whereas other PBs (EDC3 and DCP1A) are repelled ( Figure 6 I). Remarkably, relative network distance between upregulated nodes correlates with resulting condensate miscibility ( Figure 6 J): in contrast to neighboring nodes that favor a single miscible phase (e.g., G3BP/UBAP2L, EDC3/DCP1A), simultaneous overexpression of distant nodes (e.g., G3BP/DCP1A) decouples SGs from PBs ( Figures 6 K and S7 D). This SG/PB dewetting would reflect an increased interfacial tension between the two phases ( Feric et al., 2016; Zarzar et al., 2015 29. Feric, M. ∙ Vaidya, N. ∙ Harmon, T.S. ...

Dynamically reconfigurable complex emulsions via tunable interfacial tensions Nature. 2015; 518 :520-524 Crossref Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may arise from a decreased relative amount of shared substrate.
Finally, we asked whether competition between nodes with shared preference for the SG RNP network, but unfavorable PPIs, is sufficient for multiphase coexistence. Underscoring the importance of PPIs, co-expression of G3BP NTF2 Corelets ( Figure 2 B) and NTF2-associated FL SG nodes universally results in a single miscible phase ( Figure 6 M). In contrast, G3BP RBD (lacking the UBAP2L-binding NTF2 domain) opto-SGs are immiscible with FL UBAP2L granules, forming on their surface and pulling them into close proximity as the multiphase granule grows; upon deactivation, opto-SGs dissolve and attached UBAP2L condensates disperse ( Figures 6 L). Multiphase coexistence is also observed in a panel of RBD Corelets expressed with their FL node counterparts ( Figures 6 M and S7 E); note in particular how FL UBAP2L forms clear multiphase condensates with all RBD Corelets, likely as a consequence of its additional PPI connectivity to the PB network ( Figure 6 H). Multiphase coexistence is less apparent for RBD Corelets expressed with FL G3BP, with the exception of CAPRIN1, which results in conspicuous, multiphase SGs ( Figure 6 M). Since all opto-SGs are compositionally identical in G3BP KO cells ( Figures 4 and 5 ), this result implies that RBD-RNA specificity plays a modulatory role in encoding multiphase coexistence, perhaps by clustering specific RNA sequences with different preferred interactions ( Boeynaems et al., 2019; Courel et al., 2019; Fei et al., 2017; Feric et al., 2016; Hubstenberger et al., 2017; Langdon et al., 2018; Moon et al., 2019 10.

Given that many of our experimental findings can be interpreted using valence concepts from the study of patchy colloids, we sought to develop a formal theoretical framework to demonstrate the thermodynamic consistency of our interpretation of the data ( Figure 7 ). Building on prior studies of patchy colloids ( Bianchi et al., 2006; Jacobs et al., 2014 6. Bianchi, E. ∙ Largo, J. ∙ Tartaglia, P. ... Phase diagram of patchy colloids: towards empty liquids Phys. Rev. Lett. 2006; 97 :168301 Crossref Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar 42. Jacobs, W.M. ∙ Oxtoby, D.W. ∙ Frenkel, D. Phase separation in solutions with specific and nonspecific interactions J. Chem. Phys. 2014; 140 :204109 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inspired by the endogenous network depicted in Figure 6 J, we specified a reduced set of protein complexes with monovalent binding sites, which are allowed to interact according to a prescribed PPI network. We then calculated the conditions for phase coexistence assuming that all interactions have equal affinities (see Quantification and Statistical Analysis ). Despite the simplicity of this approach, our minimal model reproduces the key features of tunable multiphase behavior observed in our experiments, including coexisting substrate-dependent and -independent phases ( Figure 7 A). Eliminating the interactions between two halves of the network by introducing a saturating cap protein ( Figure 7 B) alters the compositions of the phases and increases the interfacial free-energy barrier between the condensed phases, which tends to suppress wetting ( Feric et al., 2016; Zarzar et al., 2015 29. Feric, M. ∙ Vaidya, N. ∙ Harmon, T.S. ... Coexisting Liquid Phases Underlie Nucleolar Subcompartments Cell. 2016; 165 :1686-1697 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar 106.

Reducing the valence of the substrate-binding node by capping the self-interaction sites ( Figure 7 C) destabilizes the substrate-containing phase. Similarly, removing the substrate inhibits phase separation of the substrate-binding node ( Figure 7 D). Thus, a minimal patchy-colloids framework is sufficient to describe how tuning the interactions of shared components can contribute to coexisting or disconnected networks in a multiphase system.

Section: Discussion, Conclusion

Cells feature a rich diversity of membraneless condensates, each of which embodies numerous components and coexists with distinct liquid-like compartments (“multiphases”) ( Banani et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2011; Nizami et al., 2010; Shin and Brangwynne, 2017 3.

Shin, Y. ∙ Brangwynne, C.P. Liquid phase condensation in cell physiology and disease Science. 2017; 357 Crossref Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ). This spatiotemporally dynamic intracellular emulsion reflects the self-assembly output from complex networks of biomolecular interactions. What mechanism might account for multiphase patterning and how is molecular specificity of each condensate encoded? In this work, we have combined biochemical and quantitative intracellular reconstitution approaches with concepts from patchy colloids to introduce a biophysical framework whereby competing RNA-protein networks control multiphase condensation ( Figure 7 ).
In the examined prototype in which cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) feature attached P-bodies (PBs), G3BP is of critical importance ( Bley et al., 2015; Kedersha et al., 2016; Matsuki et al., 2013 7.

Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation Genes Cells. 2013; 18 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to many proteins essential to forming intracellular condensates (e.g., NPM1, nucleolus) ( Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016 65. Mitrea, D.M. ∙ Kriwacki, R.W. Phase separation in biology; functional organization of a higher order Cell Commun. Signal. 2016; 14 :1 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), G3BP features a modular architecture with a dimeric oligomerization domain (OD) and RNA-binding domain (RBD), connected by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) ( Tourrière et al., 2003 96.

Notwithstanding tremendous attention focused on self-associating IDRs in LLPS ( Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015; Kato et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Nott et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018 24.

Both G3BP1 and G3BP2 contribute to stress granule formation Genes Cells. 2013; 18 :135-146 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nevertheless, a mechanistic understanding of the contributions of oligomerization, disorder, and RNA binding to multiphase condensation has remained elusive.
Our findings reveal that despite the common assertion that weakly self-associating IDRs are critically important for LLPS, G3BP’s IDRs are dispensable for its role in SG assembly ( Figure 1 ), and one should be wary of equating their mere presence with physiological condensation ( Riback et al., 2017 78. Riback, J.A. ∙ Katanski, C.D. ∙ Kear-Scott, J.L. ... Stress-Triggered Phase Separation Is an Adaptive, Evolutionarily Tuned Response Cell. 2017; 168 :1028-1040.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, along with two accompanying papers from the Alberti and Taylor labs ( Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020 33. Guillén-Boixet, J. ∙ Kopach, A. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. ...

G3BP1 is a tunable switch that triggers phase separation to assemble stress granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), we uncover a modulatory role for IDRs in tuning the RNA-binding capacity of the associated protein complex and its ability to induce RNP condensation. In the case of G3BP, juxtaposition of its RBD and acidic region (IDR1) prevents RNA engagement and SG assembly. Since similar acidic tracts are found in many SG (e.g., CAPRIN1, FMR1) and nucleolar (e.g., UBTF, NPM1) proteins, such electrostatic-based tuning of RNA-binding affinity may be broadly utilized, and phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of residues near RBDs might toggle RNA-protein interactions ( Kim et al., 2019 50. Kim, T.H. ∙ Tsang, B. ∙ Vernon, R.M. ... Phospho-dependent phase separation of FMRP and CAPRIN1 recapitulates regulation of translation and deadenylation Science. 2019; 365 :825-829 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). More in line with recent work ( Ruff et al., 2019 82. Ruff, K.M. ∙ Pappu, R.V. ∙ Holehouse, A.S. Conformational preferences and phase behavior of intrinsically disordered low complexity sequences: insights from multiscale simulations Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 56 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identify a self-associating IDR in UBAP2L that is critical for SG formation. By conferring the ability to weakly interconnect multiple UBAP2L/G3BP and FXR1/UBAP2L complexes, this tyrosine-rich region likely acts as an essential RBD valence multiplier ( Figures 6 C–6E).
Several studies suggest that dimerization of substrate-binding domains might be sufficient for assembly of certain condensates ( Larson et al., 2017; Strom et al., 2017 54. Larson, A.G. ∙ Elnatan, D. ∙ Keenen, M.M. ...

Strom, A.R. ∙ Emelyanov, A.V. ∙ Mir, M. ... Phase separation drives heterochromatin domain formation Nature. 2017; 547 :241-245 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our work highlights the contribution of higher degrees of substrate-binding valence, v , and illustrates the importance of careful consideration of ectopic protein expression levels relative to endogenous values in intracellular studies of condensate assembly. Although our experiments are consistent with the assertion that G3BP primarily exists in stress-independent homodimers ( Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020; Panas et al., 2015; Schulte et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020 33.

G3BP1 is a tunable switch that triggers phase separation to assemble stress granules Cell. 2020; 181 :325-345 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), synthetic RNA-binding dimers are unable to compensate for FL G3BP at physiological concentrations ( Figure 1 L). Rather, G3BP’s dimerization domain (NTF2) must serve as a valence-amplifying interaction platform, recruiting RBD-containing bridges (e.g., CAPRIN1) and secondary nodes (e.g., UBAP2L), the latter of which is also critical for SG assembly ( Figure 2 ). We confirmed the essentiality of such interconnected RBD complexes using an engineered system (Corelets) ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), showing that high-valence G3BP RBD oligomers (nodes) are dramatically more potent than dimers (bridges) at rescuing SG defects in G3BP knockout cells ( Figure 4 ). Importantly, multivalent RBDs of NTF2-associated RBPs ( Figure 5 ) are similarly competent to form PB-studded SGs, a shared preference for the SG RNP network that allows multicomponent G3BP complexes to induce condensation at physiological protein concentrations ( Table S1 ). Such protein complexes ( Figures 2 and 6 ), organized via weakly connected oligomeric nodes, provide sufficient RNA-binding contacts to rapidly condense RNPs into stress granules following polysome disassembly (“RNA influx”).
Similarly built interconnected nodes appear to underlie the formation of diverse condensates ( Figure 1 A), suggesting that such wiring may confer a common evolutionary advantage. Importantly, G3BP’s PPI network is conserved in simple metazoans such as Drosophila ( Baumgartner et al., 2013 4. Baumgartner, R. ∙ Stocker, H. ∙ Hafen, E. The RNA-binding proteins FMR1, rasputin and caprin act together with the UBA protein lingerer to restrict tissue growth in Drosophila melanogaster PLoS Genet. 2013; 9 :e1003598 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest a possible rationale for such node-node connectivity (e.g., G3BP-UBAP2L via NTF2) in affording switch-like control of LLPS by ligands ( Choi et al., 2019 18. Choi, J.-M. ∙ Dar, F. ∙ Pappu, R.V. LASSI: A lattice model for simulating phase transitions of multivalent proteins PLoS Comput. Biol. 2019; 15 :e1007028 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), a mechanism we refer to as “valence capping.” NTF2-binding partners (e.g., USP10) that lack RBDs effectively turn G3BP complexes from v ≥3 nodes into v =2 bridges, thereby lacking the requisite RNA-binding contacts to condense the SG network ( Figure 3 ). This physical model likely represents a broadly applicable framework for understanding how organisms exert spatiotemporal control over phase separation, for example during tissue patterning ( Brangwynne et al., 2009; Gammons and Bienz, 2018; Saha et al., 2016; Wu and Fuxreiter, 2016 14.

We speculate that concentrations and composite interaction strengths of interconnected caps, bridges, and nodes have been finely tuned to allow context-dependent “phase switches.” In the case of SGs, such a switch is hijacked by diverse viruses to ensure their survival ( Panas et al., 2014, 2015; Schulte et al., 2016 73.

Considering the overlap between PB and SG PPI networks ( Figure 6 J; Youn et al., 2018 104. Youn, J.-Y. ∙ Dunham, W.H. ∙ Hong, S.J. ... High-Density Proximity Mapping Reveals the Subcellular Organization of mRNA-Associated Granules and Bodies Mol. Cell. 2018; 69 :517-532.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ), another possible evolutionary basis for interconnected nodes is that valence-capping—or ligand-based competition for a node’s PPI interfaces more generally—provides a facile way to control directional substrate (e.g., RNA) processing ( Kim et al., 2019; Riback et al., 2019 50. Kim, T.H. ∙ Tsang, B. ∙ Vernon, R.M. ... Phospho-dependent phase separation of FMRP and CAPRIN1 recapitulates regulation of translation and deadenylation Science. 2019; 365 :825-829 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar 79. Riback, J.A. ∙ Zhu, L. ∙ Ferrolino, M.C. ... Composition dependent phase separation underlies directional flux through the nucleolus bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Indeed, we show that subtle manipulation of node stoichiometry causes restructuring of multiphase organization ( Figure 6 ), supporting a biophysical framework in which the relative overlap between networks of interactions (protein-protein, protein-RNA) defines phase immiscibility (or coexistence) and relative RNP partitioning ( Figure 7 ). De novo multiphase SGs can result from competition for substrate between a synthetic RBD node and its FL counterpart in an endogenous complex ( Figures 6 L and 6M). Further, shifting the stoichiometry of highly interconnected nodes is sufficient to encode compositionally distinct hybrid condensates ( Figures 6 H and 6K), hypertrophied examples of endogenous multiphase SGs ( Figures 6 F and 6G), or even decoupled SG/PBs ( Figure 6 K). Thus, competing nodes appear to promote a composition-dependent “tug-of-war” between PPIs and protein-RNA interactions, the outcome of which determines condensate specificity and association ( Figure 7 ). The possibility for even relatively non-overlapping networks to become miscible by shifting the stoichiometric balance highlights the richness of the high-dimensional phase diagrams underlying multiphase condensation ( Jacobs and Frenkel, 2017; Mao et al., 2019 41.

Mao, S. ∙ Kuldinow, D. ∙ Haataja, M.P. ... Phase behavior and morphology of multicomponent liquid mixtures Soft Matter. 2019; 15 :1297-1311 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our results illustrate that, rather than a binary classification scheme for a given multiphase (e.g., SG versus PB), a spectrum of condensates, each with their own biomolecular composition, is the inevitable consequence of distinct cellular states. Future studies will integrate new experimental findings regarding the caps, nodes, and bridges that define the network connectivity within a given set of condensates, together with theoretical approaches that consider more complex networks of particle-based interactions. In addition to having major implications for substrate processing and organismal development, these efforts will be important for understanding how condensates are manipulated by pathogens to ensure their survival ( McInerney, 2015 62. McInerney, G.M. FGDF motif regulation of stress granule formation DNA Cell Biol. 2015; 34 :557-560 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) or pathologies to drive cell death ( Freibaum and Taylor, 2017 30. Freibaum, B.D. ∙ Taylor, J.P. The Role of Dipeptide Repeats in C9ORF72-Related ALS-FTD Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2017; 10 :35 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). We envision that such network-based approaches based on soft matter physics will inform the identification of nodes most amenable to therapeutic targeting, and thus inspire new treatment strategies for devastating human diseases.

Cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biological), supplemented with 1% streptomycin and penicillin, and kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . All cell lines tested mycoplasma-negative. HEK293 and HEK293T (immortalized human female kidney-derived cells) were kind gifts from Marc Diamond lab (UT Southwestern). HeLa (immortalized human female cervical cancer-derived cells) were obtained from ATCC. U2OS cells (human female osteosarcoma cells) and U2OS G3BP1/2 (“G3BP”) knockout (KO) cells were previously described ( Kedersha et al., 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). G3BP KO was confirmed independently in by western blot ( Figure S1 B). Details regarding additional described U2OS knockout cell lines are provided in Table S2 . All cell lines are adherent to plastic/glass substrates and divide (double) every 24 h, on average. “Confluency” refers to the state when cells completely cover the bottom of dish, and hence stop dividing. Thus, when methods state 1:8 dilution (“passage” into new dish), ~72 h will be required to reach next confluency.
Unless indicated (e.g., pHR lentiviral vector, SFFV promoter), all lentiviral DNA plasmids were generated using the FM5 lentiviral vector (kind gift from Marc Diamond lab, UT Southwestern), which features the Ubiquitin C promoter. DNA fragments encoding our proteins of interest were amplified by PCR with Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB). Oligonucleotides used for PCR were synthesized by IDT. In-Fusion HD cloning kit (Takara) was used to insert the PCR amplified fragments into the desired linearized vector, which featured standardized linkers and overlaps to allow cloning in high throughput. Plasmid inserts were confirmed by GENEWIZ Sanger sequencing, reading from both ends of the insert. For all sspB-mCherry-tagged DNA constructs, correct sequencing was confirmed a second time by an independent researcher. Stress granule (SG) rescue defects associated with the G3BP S38F mutant were confirmed using two different fully sequenced DNA constructs (FM5-mGFP-G3BP1 S38F and pcDNA4 t/o-GFP-G3BP1 S38F) tested by two separate labs.
All live cell imaging experiments were performed using cells stably transduced with lentivirus, with the exception of light-induced sspB-/iLID-ΔNTF2 dimer-mediated rescue of G3BP knockout ( Figure S1 J; see Transient transfection ). Lentiviruses containing desired constructs were produced using a previously optimized protocol ( Sanders et al., 2014 84. Sanders, D.W. ∙ Kaufman, S.K. ∙ DeVos, S.L. ... Distinct tau prion strains propagate in cells and mice and define different tauopathies Neuron. 2014; 82 :1271-1288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ) by transfecting the plasmid along with helper plasmids VSVG and PSP (kind gift from Marc Diamond lab, UT Southwestern) into HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen). Virus was collected 2-3 days after transfection and used to infect WT U2OS or G3BP KO U2OS cells. Lentivirus transduction was performed in 96-well plates. Three days following lentivirus application to cells at low confluency, cells were passaged for stable maintenance or directly to 96-well fibronectin-coated glass bottom dishes for live cell microscopy. For non-Corelet experiments, stable cell lines were passaged at least 3-times over 8+ days prior to use in live cell imaging experiments to eliminate cells expressing lethal levels of the fusion protein of interest. In all experiments, 90%+ of cells featured expression of the protein of interest at a range of concentrations (typically < 5 μM; estimated concentrations are noted as relevant in the figure legends). This specific protocol was designed to avoid artifact-prone concentrations of fusion proteins that can occur with lipid-based transient transfection, which has previously been shown to induce interferon signaling and stress granule formation (e.g., GFP transfection of WT U2OS cells can lead to stress granules in ~20% of cells) ( Guo et al., 2019; Hagen et al., 2015; Panas et al., 2019; Tourrière et al., 2003 35.

Unlike all other experiments (see above), light-induced (sspB/iLID) ΔNTF2 dimer-mediated rescue of G3BP knockout was performed using transient transfection ( Figure S1 J). Initial attempts to rescue defects (data not shown) using lentivirus mediated stable expression were not successful due to inability to reach sufficiently high concentrations of the individual fusion proteins (i.e., > 8 μM of both mCherry-sspB-G3BP1ΔNTF2 and mGFP-iLID-G3BP1ΔNTF2). See Figure 1 L for constitutive dimer mGFP-FKBP-G3BPΔNTF2, data collected using stable, lentivirus-mediated expression. Thus, individual wells of a 96-well plate containing G3BP1/2 KO U2OS cells were transfected with both mCherry-sspB-G3BP1ΔNTF2 and mGFP-iLID-G3BP1ΔNTF2 using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. 18 h later, cells were observed to feature both fusion proteins diffusely expressed throughout the cytoplasm. Arsenite was added to a final concentration of 400 μM. 1 h later, cells were imaged. Three biological replicates were performed. In rare cells with very high concentrations of both components (> 10 μM of each) ( Figure S1 J ) , stress granules were observed, regardless of time of blue light activation. The light-independent nature of dimer-based rescue at these concentrations is consistent with the measured in vitro dark state K d of 4.3 μM for iLID-sspB ( Guntas et al., 2015 34. Guntas, G. ∙ Hallett, R.A. ∙ Zimmerman, S.P. ... Engineering an improved light-induced dimer (iLID) for controlling the localization and activity of signaling proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :112-117 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). At such concentrations, iLID and sspB are expected to interact strongly in the dark. The in vitro light state K d for iLID-sspB of 0.2 μM for iLID-sspB (or ~10 nM for “core” measurements, see Phase diagram data collection ), which sets the lower limit for the assay.
Microinjections were performed using an Eppendorf Femtojet microinjector mounted on an Axiovert 200M Widefield at 60x magnification. Microneedles were pulled from borosilicate glass with O.D. 1 mm and I.D. 0.78 mm using Sutter Instrument Model P-97. U2OS WT cells stably expressing GFP-CAPRIN1 (~1-2 μM) were plated on 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek) in DMEM (GIBCO) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biological), supplemented with 1% streptomycin and penicillin, and kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Prior to injection, media was replaced with fresh media supplemented with 10 mM HEPES to buffer against pH changes during CO 2 -free microinjection ( Maharana et al., 2018 57. Maharana, S. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Papadopoulos, D.K. ... RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins Science. 2018; 360 :918-921 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). DNase (TURBO from Thermo Fisher, 2 U/μL), RNase (Cocktail Enzyme Mix from Thermo Fisher featuring RNase A: 0.5 U/μL, RNase T1: 20 U/μL), or buffer control were diluted 1:8 in TAMRA dye/PBS and injected directly into the cytoplasm with a pressure of 30 hPa for as short a time as possible. For each trial, approximately 100-150 cells were individually injected. Media was exchanged for fresh media containing 400 μM arsenite to induce polysome disassembly (“RNA influx”). 45-60 min later, cells were imaged with a Nikon A1 laser scanning microscope. Fields of view with TAMRA-positive cells were identified using the 546 laser-line in the absence of 488 to avoid potential bias with respect to cell selection. Upon finding cells, images were taken with both 488 and 546 laser lines and cells were scored for presence or lack of stress granules, measuring the TAMRA fluorescence in the cytoplasm (arbitrary units).
Cells were imaged on fibronectin-coated 96-well glass bottom dishes (Cellvis). Confocal images were taken on a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 60x oil immersion lens with a numerical aperture of 1.4. The microscope stage was equipped with a humidified incubator to keep cells at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Proteins tagged with mCherry, mGFP (“GFP”), EYFP, and miRFP670 (“iRFP”) were imaged with 560, 488, 488, and 640 nm lasers, respectively. All experiments and image acquisitions were performed on living cells to avoid potential artifacts due to fixation, with three exceptions: (A) RNA-FISH experiments; (B) immunofluorescence studies; (C) Corelet/GFP co-localization analysis. No measurements of protein concentration were performed in fixed cells, as fluorescence intensity of proteins in specific cellular compartments were differentially affected by paraformaldehyde fixation. The above details apply to all imaging data in the manuscript with the exception of STED super-resolution ( Figure 6 G) and widefield microscopy ( Figures 6 H; S6 H) images. See below for details.
For images shown in Figure 6 G, G3BP KO cells stably expressing either iRFP-G3BP1 or mGFP-G3BP1 and iRFP-FXR1—in all cases at ~1-2 μM—were treated with 400 μM arsenite (1 h, humidified incubator) then imaged on an Abberior Instruments expert line STED laser scanning confocal microscope at 37°C. For single channel STED images, sequential image sets (each line imaged concurrently with and without the STED laser to control for bleaching artifacts) were taken with increasing STED power using the ‘Custom Axis’ options available in Imspector. For dual channel STED images, two sequential image sets were taken with each line imaging mGFP (+/− STED) and miRFP (+/− STED) with the first mGFP STED power set to 0% to avoid miRFP image bleaching, which occurred during the second image (again using the ‘custom axis’ option available in Imspector).
For images displayed in Figure 6 H and Figure S6 H, G3BP KO or UBAP2L KO U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-UBAP2L were grown on glass coverslips, stressed with 400 μM arsenite when indicated, and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15-min, followed by 5-min post-fixation/permeabilization in ice cold methanol. Cells were blocked in 5% horse serum/PBS, and primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in blocking buffer for 1 h with rocking. Following washes with PBS, cells were mounted in polyvinyl mounting media and imaged. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope with a 63x Plan Apo objective lens (NA 1.4) and illuminated with a mercury lamp and standard filters for DAPI (UV-2A 360/40; 420/LP), Cy2 (FITC HQ 480/40; 535/50), Cy3 (Cy 3HQ 545/30; 610/75), and Cy5 (Cy 5 HQ 620/60; 700/75). Images were captured using a SPOT Pursuit Digital Camera (Diagnostics Instruments) with the manufacturer’s software, and raw TIF files were imported into Adobe Photoshop CS3. Identical adjustments in brightness and contrast were applied to all images in a given experiment.
Pre-activation and post-activation images of G3BP KO cells stably expressing the indicated fusion proteins were captured with the mCherry (560) channel only to visualize the sspB component without triggering light-induced dimerization with the iLID-mGFP-tagged Ferritin core. Cells were activated with a 488-laser using 1% laser power to cause dimerization of iLID and sspB ( Guntas et al., 2015 34. Guntas, G. ∙ Hallett, R.A. ∙ Zimmerman, S.P. ... Engineering an improved light-induced dimer (iLID) for controlling the localization and activity of signaling proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :112-117 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activation of cells was achieved by imaging the mCherry and mGFP channels simultaneously using a 6 s frame interval for an area of 120x120 μm 2 (1024x1024 pixels) at Nyquist zoom. See also Phase diagram data collection .
G3BP KO cells stably expressing indicated fusion proteins were first globally activated to trigger iLID-sspB dimerization by continuously exposing them with the 488 laser for 5-min. Light-activated condensates were then bleached in a ~1 μm 2 region with the 560 laser at high power to quench the majority of the mCherry-sspB component of the condensate. Fluorescence recovery was monitored while imaging both mCherry and mGFP channels at a frame interval of 6 s. Fluorescence was standardized based on a non-bleached droplet in the same cell to control for FRAP-independent bleaching. Fluorescence intensity was compared to the initial image for generating plots.
Cells were “stressed” by adding sodium arsenite (referred to as “As” throughout text) to cell media at a concentration of 400 μM, which is in excess of saturating concentrations for maximal polysome disassembly ( Kedersha et al., 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images were captured between 50-min and 2 h (typically 1 h) after arsenite treatment, unless performing activation-deactivation (light-dark) cycling experiments (see below). No differences were observed with respect to rescue of SG defects, phase threshold shift, SG inhibition, etc. between 60- and 120-min. SG number/size typically peaked by 45-min, and 1- to 2 h time window was chosen, so that drug reached maximal effect (i.e., maximum amount of exposed RNA available in the cytoplasm). Cells typically began to die ~6 h following treatment; to avoid confounding toxicity/lethality effects, the indicated 1- to 2 h time window was used.
Cycloheximide (blocks polysome disassembly) was added to G3BP KO cells expressing indicated fluorescent fusion proteins at a final concentration of 100 μg/mL. Following 30-min of incubation, arsenite was added (400 μM final concentration). 1 h later, cells were assessed for formation of stress granules (GFP-G3BP rescue experiments) or activation cycles were performed (Corelets).
Actinomycin D (“ActD”; intercalates into DNA to prevent transcription) dissolved in DMSO was used to treat G3BP KO cells expressing indicated Corelets at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Images were taken 12-18 h after Actinomycin D treatment, a time interval during which nucleoli were no longer visible by bright field microscopy, and the vast majority of mRNA was expected to be degraded. Final concentration of DMSO was 0.5%, which is well below toxic levels. For Actinomycin D plus arsenite experiments, arsenite was added to a final concentration of 400 μM ~12 h following Actinomycin D treatment, and cells were imaged 1-2 h post-arsenite. Qualitative observations suggested that the application of Actinomycin D at the indicated concentration was lethal following ~24-36 h of treatment. The 12 h time point was chosen to maximize the time since treatment (i.e., to reduce RNA in cells by as much as possible) without extensive lethality from the drug.
In order to determine precise phase threshold boundaries for intracellular phase diagrams, analyzed cells must feature high variability with respect to sspB-mCherry and iLID-mGFP concentrations, so as to sample sufficient core concentrations and valences. In order to achieve a broad concentration range for both components, G3BP KO cells were transduced in 96-well plates using an arrayed lentivirus approach. In this protocol, rows varied from 2 to 60 [2, 6, 20, 60] μL iLID-GFP-Fe lentivirus; columns, 2 to 60 [2, 6, 20, 60] μL mCherry-sspB-protein of interest (“POI”) (or POI-mCherry-sspB) lentivirus. G3BP KO cells were plated directly into the arrayed lentivirus to achieve ~25% confluency upon subsequent attachment to the plastic substrate. 72 h later, at confluency, all 16-wells associated with an individual Corelet condition were washed with PBS, trypsinized, quenched with fresh media, and combined into a single test tube, thus ensuring a diverse population of cells with highly variable iLID to sspB ratios. Cells were plated at a 1:8 dilution factor onto fibronectin-coated, glass bottom 96-well plates (Cellvis) and imaged 48 h later when at 60%–90% confluency.
For all data collected toward generation of phase diagrams, a standardized imaging protocol was adopted to avoid confounding effects related to alterations in microscopy settings. Identical imaging settings were used relative to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS)-based calibrations (fluorescence to absolute concentration) (see Quantification and Statistical Analysis ). Specifically, images were collected using 0.5 frames per second scan rate, 1024x1024 pixel frame (120x120 μm 2 ), and 1.75x Nyquist zoom (63x oil immersion lens). Laser powers (1% 488 and 100% 546), intensities, and gains were kept constant. All time lapses (activation periods) were 5-min in length and featured 6 s intervals between frame acquisitions. Following the last frame, laser intensity was dropped for 4-additional frames followed by acquisition of 4-final images at higher relative laser intensity. This protocol was selected to achieve wide dynamic range (i.e., to achieve sufficient resolution of lower concentration cells, which feature lower signal to noise, and to avoid pixel saturation in cases of exceptionally bright dense phases).
Using this standardized protocol, each 5-min acquisition was able to add (on average) 10-data points (i.e., cells) to a phase diagram. Thus, an average phase diagram reported in this study required collection of 20-30 fields or ~2-3 h of data acquisition time. Typically, an individual phase diagram was compiled from data collected over the course of 3-5 experiments (i.e., different lentivirus transductions on different days). However, certain phase diagrams featured data from significantly more experiments (e.g., G3BP1ΔNTF2 Corelets, a condition used as a positive control for effects of drug treatments throughout studies, which ensured reliability of data). Throughout the duration of the study, there was no indication of systematic changes with respect to drug response, drug efficacy, measurement of fluorescence intensities, or phase diagram threshold shifts.
When selecting cells for analysis, only fully activated cells (entire cell within field of view) were considered to avoid potential artifacts related to local activation and diffusive capture ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The average mCherry and mGFP fluorescence intensity for a cell was determined using the first frame, prior to blue-light mediated dimerization of iLID on core to sspB-tagged protein of interest, and manual image segmentation of 4.5 × 4.5 μm square regions of interest (ROIs) in cytoplasmic regions featuring homogeneous fluorescence (i.e., regions with low density of membrane-bound organelles like the juxtanuclear Golgi apparatus). The aforementioned FCS calibration curves were then used to determine the mCherry and mGFP concentrations. The mGFP concentration was divided by 24, the number of subunits per ferritin complex or “core,” to determine the core concentration. Valence was determined for an individual cell by dividing the mCherry concentration value by that of the core. Previously, we showed that this is a highly accurate measure based on the lever rule—in a “one-component” system (e.g., FUS IDR Corelets, which feature minimal endogenous proteins, nucleic acids; see Figure S2 A), consistency in valence between initial, dilute, and condensed phases is reliably observed ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binary decisions (yes or no) regarding Corelet-mediated phase separation in a cell of interest were determined manually. Datasets used for subsequent automated generation of phase diagrams and phase thresholds (see QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ) were coded and sent to a separate individual.
Cycling experiments were performed similarly to experiments describes in Phase diagram data collection with minor changes. After treatment of G3BP KO cells expressing indicated sspB/iLID Corelets with arsenite (or indicated drug), image acquisition was immediately commenced. For most experiments, a 5-min activation (488 blue light) time lapse was acquired for each cycle, immediately followed by a 5-min time lapse for deactivation (no 488 blue light). We have determined that this deactivation time far exceeds that which is required for complete reversibility (typically 30-60 s, see Figures 4 B; S4 A), of diverse Corelet condensates. Indicated cycling parameters were repeated 6-8 times. In certain experiments, instead, a 10-min activation time lapse was immediately followed by a 5-min time lapse for deactivation. This was repeated four times. Intervals were kept constant at 6 s in all cases. Representative cells/fields were chosen for data analysis based on standard core concentrations (~0.25 μM) and desired valence, which is indicated in figure legends for a given experiment.
For G3BP rescue competition experiments ( Figure 3 ), an identical arrayed lentivirus approach was used as described in Phase diagram data collection (i.e., 2-60 μL G3BP1-mCherry and 2-60 μL mGFP-POI, arrayed 4-wells by 4-wells for 16-wells total of a 96-well plate). G3BP KO cells were plated into lentivirus, grown for 72 h, then combined and passaged at 1:8 dilution factor. At the next confluency, cells were passaged to fibronectin-coated 96-well glass plates (Cellvis), and live cell confocal microscopy was performed on Day 8 post-transduction. For each condition (GFP-tagged POI), 4 separate experiments (each experiment = 1-well with arsenite treatment) were performed on three separate days with numerous technical replicates (fields of view or “images”). Live confocal imaging was performed 1-2 h following arsenite treatment. Concentrations of mCherry and mGFP were determined similarly as for phase diagrams, and manual scoring of stress granule presence or absence was performed. Similar protocols were used to assess stress granule rescue thresholds in the absence of competition.
For stress granule inhibition experiments ( Figure S1 G; Figure S3 B; etc.), WT U2OS cells stably expressing YBX1-mCherry (SG marker protein) were plated into 96-well plates at 25% confluency and transduced with 2-60 μL lentivirus of indicated mGFP-tagged protein (4-wells: 2, 6, 20, or 60 μL). Three days later, cells were washed, trypsinized, combined, and passaged at 1:8 dilution factor. Three days after this, confluent cells were passaged onto fibronectin-coated 96-well plates. Live cell confocal imaging was performed 2-days later (i.e., 8 days following lentivirus transduction) when cells were at 60%–80% confluency. Images were taken between 1-2 h after arsenite treatment. 3-4 independent experiments were performed for each condition on two separate days with numerous technical replicates (i.e., fields of view or “images”) per experiment. Concentrations of mGFP-tagged proteins were determined using FCS calibration curves, SG formation was assessed in a binary manner, and all data was coded then sent to a separate individual for quantitative analysis.
For stress granule partitioning experiments, WT U2OS cells stably expressing mGFP-CAPRIN1 ( Figure 1 I) or mCherry-CAPRIN1 ( Figure 6 I) were plated into 96-well plates at 25% confluency and transduced with either 30 μL of indicated mCherry-tagged lentivirus ( Figure 1 I) or mGFP-tagged lentivirus ( Figure 6 I). Three days later at confluency, cells were washed, trypsinized, and passaged at 1:8 dilution factor. Three days after this, cells were passaged onto fibronectin-coated 96-well glass plates (Cellvis). Live cell confocal imaging was performed 2-days later (i.e., 8 days following lentivirus transduction) when cells were at 60%–80% confluency. Images were taken between 1-2 h after arsenite treatment. Three independent experiments were performed for each condition.
Followed similar protocol as “ Phase diagram data collection ” but performed two-lentivirus co-transduction (with sspB-mCh-POI and non-fluorescent iLID-Fe instead of typical GFP-tagged version) on G3BP KO cells stably expressing the indicated GFP-tagged protein. 72 h after infection, cells were passaged at 1:8 dilution factor onto fibronectin-coated, glass bottom 96-well plates (Cellvis). 48 h later, cells were treated with arsenite (400 μM). One h later, removed plate from humidified incubator and placed on a blue LED light illuminator (Invitrogen SafeImager 2.0) for 10-min to activate Corelets. Immediately fixed with 4-percent PFA for 10 min. Washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with ice cold 70% methanol for 10 min. Washed an additional two times with PBS then placed at 4°C overnight. Performed fixed cell confocal microscopy the next day to examine co-localization of opto-SGs with indicated GFP-tagged proteins. Multiple replicates (images) were taken and representative examples are shown.
Indicated cells were fixed with 4-percent PFA for 10-min then washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with ice cold 70% ethanol. 96-well glass bottom plates (Cellvis) were placed at −4°C overnight. The next day, ethanol was replaced with Wash Buffer A (Stellaris) and incubated at room temperature for 5-min. Buffer A was then replaced with hybridization buffer (Stellaris) containing 5 μM 5′-Cy5-Oligo d(T)20 (Gene Link) (hybridizes to polyA tails of mRNA) and incubated in the dark for 16 h to probe polyadenylated mRNA. Hybridization buffer was replaced with Wash Buffer A, placed at 37°C for 30-min, then replaced with Wash Buffer B, incubating at room temperature for another 5-min. Following three PBS washes, cells were imaged with Nikon A1 laser-scanning confocal microscope.
For Figure S1 B, confluent human cell lines (U2OS WT, U2OS G3BP1/2 KO, HEK293, HeLa) from a 6-well plate were washed, trypsinized, quenched with media, harvested, and centrifuged at 500xg for 5-min. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and flash-frozen. Immediately prior to lysis, cells were thawed on ice and re-suspended in 150 μL 2x Nuage® LDS Sample Buffer/Reducing agent, sonicated, and boiled at 100°C for 5-min. 50 ng of the following recombinant proteins were loaded in lanes alongside cell lysates as positive controls: G3BP1 (Novus, NBP1-50925-50UG), G3BP2 (Novus, NBP1-78843-100UG). Samples were run on a NuPAGE® Novex 10% Bis-Tris Gel and transferred to PVDF Pre-Cut Blotting Membranes, as per manufacturer’s protocol. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C with rocking in 5% NFDM in TBST (5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mM NaCl, 1% Tween-20). Membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies in blocking solution overnight at 4°C with rocking: G3BP1 (Mouse monoclonal, AbCam ab86135, 1:300), G3BP2 (Rabbit polyclonal, AbCam ab86135, 1:5000), Beta actin (Rabbit polyclonal, AbCam ab8227, 1:10,000). The next day, membranes were washed multiple times and then incubated with the following secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 30-min at room temperature with rocking: Peroxidase-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson, 115-035-062, 1:10,000), Peroxidase-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson, 115-035-144, 1:10,000). Subsequently, multiple washes were performed prior to developing the membrane using SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate, as per manufacturer’s instructions.
150 mm dishes of near-confluent cells were treated as indicated, washed with cold Hanks Basic Salt Solution, and scrape-harvested at 4°C into lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors (Roche, EDTA free), HALT phosphatase inhibitors (Pierce), and 20 μg/nL RNase A. Cells were rotated for 30-min at 4°C, cleared by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 5-min), and supernatants removed then incubated with Chromotek-GFP-Trap® Beads (Allele Biotech) for 2 h with continuous rotation at 4°C. Beads were washed 5-times, and either eluted directly into SDS-lysis buffer with RNase treatment, or extracted in RIPA buffer (50 mM TRIS, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP40, 0.5% DOC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. Material released by RIPA buffer was recovered and precipitated with 60% acetone. Beads post-RIPA extraction contained bound material denoted “high-affinity,” which was released by heating in reducing SDS-PAGE lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved on 4%–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Transfer-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad), and blotted using standard procedures as above. Chemiluminescence was detected using SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Thermo Scientific).
Please see Table S2 for information regarding generation of U2OS knockout cell lines. Each target sequence (see table) was purchased as paired DNA oligos (sense/anti-sense pairs) from IDT, annealed, and ligated into pCas-Guide (Origene), with the exception of UBAP2 (see below). Plasmid inserts were verified by sequencing, and transfected into cells with pDonor-D09 (Origene, encodes puromycin resistance). Following transfection, cells were subjected to a brief (24 h) selection in puromycin (2 μg/mL) and allowed to recover for 2-days or longer before evaluation using the indicated antibodies and immunofluorescence. Cells were cloned by limiting dilution, and clones were verified using both immunostaining and western blotting.
For single KO lines, the parental cell line was U2OS expressing the Tet-repressor ( Kedersha et al., 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). CAPRIN1 and USP10 were individually knocked out in the previously characterized G3BP1 and G3BP2 double KO (G3BP1/2 or G3BP KO) cells ( Kedersha et al., 2016 48. Kedersha, N. ∙ Panas, M.D. ∙ Achorn, C.A. ... G3BP-Caprin1-USP10 complexes mediate stress granule condensation and associate with 40S subunits J. Cell Biol. 2016; 212 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). To create the U2OSΔFXR1/FXR2/FMR1 (3KO) cell line, FXR2 was first KOed, clones were selected, and FXR2 protein expression was evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blotting. “Clone 6” was then transfected with guide RNAs targeting FXR1 and FMR1 . Clones were selected and screened in a similar manner and finally a triple null line (3KO) was obtained. All loci were sequenced to confirm deletions in the DNA.
In the case of UBAP2/UBAP2L double KO (2KO), validated UBAP2L single-KO cells were plated into 200 μL of pCRISPRv2-UBAP2 gRNA (pooled, 6 gRNAs) or 200 μL of pCRISPRv2-NonTarget gRNA ( Shalem et al., 2014 87. Shalem, O. ∙ Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Hartenian, E. ... Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells Science. 2014; 343 :84-87 Crossref Scopus (2131) PubMed Google Scholar ) in 96-well plate. 72 h later, confluent cells were washed, trypsinized and passaged into new wells containing 200 μL of the same lentivirus. Cells were passaged three times and examined for successful KO by immunofluorescence, validating with two antibodies against UBAP2, which indicated that ~30 percent of the cells featured very low or undetectable levels of UBAP2 (in NonTarget control, 100% of cells displayed UBAP2 staining). Cells were amplified by three successive 1:8 passages in 96-well plates over a 1-week period. Upon the third confluency in 96-well, cells were passaged at limiting dilution into three separate 96-well plates, so that each well featured ~50% chance of receiving a cell. 10 days later, colonies were apparent in ~20%–30% of wells. For NonTarget control, six wells were harvested and passaged; candidate UBAP2 and UBAP2L double-KOs (UBAP2/2L 2KO), 50 separate lines. Following approximately two weeks of additional passage and growth, candidate KO lines (and NonTarget controls) were plated onto fibronectin-covered glass (96-well plate). 24 h later, cells were at ~60%–80% confluency. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 5-min, and immunofluorescence was performed (anti-UBAP2, anti-G3BP1). In NonTarget controls (i.e., UBAP2L 1KO), most cells featured G3BP-positive stress granules but they were slightly smaller than control conditions (i.e., WT cells), a result that was validated across labs (data not shown). Four candidate UBAP2/2L double KO lines featured undetectable UBAP2 by immunofluorescence. In these examples, G3BP-positive SGs were only present in ~30% of cells and they were much smaller in size than in WT or UBAP2L single-KOs. Double knockout of UBAP2 and UBAP2L was confirmed in three lines and relative levels of G3BP1, G3BP2, USP10, and CAPRIN1 were assessed by western blot.
To identify Cas9-induced mutations of all KO cell lines in the coding sequence, genomic amplification was performed using nested primer sets surrounding the region targeted by the particular guide sequence. Genomic DNA PCR was done with Invitrogen’s AccuPrime GC-Rich DNA Polymerase (Buffer A). DNA was initially denatured at 95°C for 3-min, followed by denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1-min for 30 cycles. Final extension was done at 72°C for 10-min. PCR amplicons were directly sequenced. If there was evidence for multiple sequences (i.e., multiple alleles), PCR products were adenylated using Taq polymerase and cloned into Promega pGEM®-T Easy vector; individual clones were obtained and sequenced.
A clonal cell line was made constitutively expressing mCherry-G3BP1 by transfection of mCherry-G3BP1-C1 into the G3BP1/2 (G3BP) KO cells containing the Tet repressor, selected using G418 (500 μg/mL), and cloned. This line was used to make double-positive cells expressing Tet-inducible GFP-tagged proteins (G3BP1 WT, G3BP1 S38F, G3BP1 F33W, and UBAP2L WT) in pcDNA4 t/o vector (Invitrogen), selected using zeocin (Invitrogen, 250 μg/mL). These cell lines were used for immunoprecipitation experiments in Figure 2 and Figure 6 .
GFP and mCherry fluorescence values were converted to absolute concentrations using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), performed as described previously ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Data for diffusion and concentration of indicated fluorescent fusion proteins were obtained with 30 s FCS measurement time. The measurements were performed on U2OS G3BP1/2 2KO (“G3BP KO”) cell populations expressing iLID-mGFP or mCherry-sspB, fusion protein conditions that were chosen based on the assumption that such non-native fusion proteins would be monomeric and feature no major endogenous binding partners. Images were taken using a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope with an oil immersion objective (Plan Apo 60X/1.4 numerical aperture, Nikon). All measurements and data analysis were performed using the SymPhoTime Software (PicoQuant). The autocorrelation function for simple diffusion is: 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝜏 ) = 𝐺 ⁡ ( 0 ) ⁢ ( 1 + ( 𝜏 𝜏 𝐷 ) ) − 1 ⁢ ( 1 + ( 𝜏 𝜅 2 ⁢ 𝜏 𝐷 ) ) − 0 . 5
The variables in the above equation are defined as follows: G (0) is magnitude at short timescales; τ is the lag time; τ D is the half decay time; and 𝜅 is the ratio of axial to radial of measurement volume ( 𝜅 = ( 𝜔 𝑧 / 𝜔 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑦 ). Here, 𝜔 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑦 = 0.19 μm and 𝜅 = 5.1, which is determined by the fluorophore dye Alexa488 in water. The parameters τ D and G (0) are optimized in the fit and are used to determine the diffusion coefficient ( 𝐷 = 𝜔 2 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑦 /4τ D ) and molecule concentration ( C = ( 𝜋 3 2 ⁢ 𝜔 2 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝜔 𝑧 ⁢ 𝐺 ⁢ ( 0 ) ) − 1 ).
The fluorescence to concentration calibration curves displayed in Figure S1 C were used for all experiments that quantitatively assess the concentrations of mCherry- and mGFP-tagged fusion proteins in WT and G3BP KO U2OS cells. Such FCS calibration curves yielded several findings that support the precision of such estimates. These are detailed below.
First, independently performed mCherry FCS experiments yielded concentration estimates that were < 5% different from previous measurements ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, the aforementioned study used an autocatalytic P2A system to co-express mGFP and mCherry at equimolar ratios, with GFP concentrations extrapolated from the FCS calibration curves determined for mCherry. This indirectly extrapolated calibration curve predicted GFP concentrations that differed by < 20% from the independently obtained calibrations and estimations used in this study.
Second, the slope determined in Figure 3 B, which quantifies stoichiometry between USP10 and G3BP required to differentiate cells that form stress granules from those that are unable to, is remarkably close to 1 (~0.98). A slope of 1 is predicted for such a competitive inhibitor (“cap”) expressed at concentrations far greater than its K d and is further confirmed by nearly equivalent slopes for other strong inhibitors (“caps” e.g., USP10 NIM and CAPRIN1 NIM).
Third, we estimated the concentration of G3BP1/2 in U2OS cell cytoplasm by adding the G3BP concentration for rescue (620 nM) ( Figure 3 B) and USP10 concentration for SG inhibition (1560 nM) ( Figure S3 B) to extrapolate a concentration of ~2180 nM. This value is approximately equal to independently obtained mass spectrometry values in HeLa cells (1808 nM in cytoplasm, a value extrapolated from the reported estimate of 1446 nM in whole cells, based on the assumption that the nucleus accounts for 20% of total volume and all G3BP is located to the cytosol ( Hein et al., 2015 37. Hein, M.Y. ∙ Hubner, N.C. ∙ Poser, I. ... A human interactome in three quantitative dimensions organized by stoichiometries and abundances Cell. 2015; 163 :712-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar )). Importantly, western blot confirms similar levels of both G3BP1 and G3BP2 in HeLa and U2OS cells ( Figure S1 B).
Fourth, we determined that mGFP-G3BP1 and G3BP1-mCherry feature identical SG rescue concentration thresholds ( Figure S1 D, within 50 nM of each other), despite different fluorescent protein tags. Taken together, these observations give confidence that our FCS calibration curves are highly accurate for estimating fluorescent protein concentration in living cells.
All images were analyzed using a combination of manual image segmentation (ImageJ), custom semi-automated workflows in ImageJ, and automated analysis in MATLAB 2018b. In all experiments, regions of interest were selected in ImageJ and average cytoplasmic intensities were calculated using the aforementioned FCS calibration curves. The presence of stress granules was, in cases other than the cycling experiments, determined by manual scoring based upon co-localization with a protein marker of stress granules that features diffuse distribution in the cytoplasm in the absence of stress (and further, is diffuse in the cytoplasm of stressed G3BP KO cells without ectopic expression of a protein that rescues stress granule defects).
The average fluorescence intensity for mCherry and mGFP in an individual cell was used to approximate the concentration of associated fusion proteins. This was determined by using manual image segmentation (ImageJ) to draw 4.5 × 4.5 μm square ROIs in cytoplasmic regions featuring homogeneous distribution of fluorescence (i.e., regions with low density of membrane-bound organelles like the Golgi). The aforementioned FCS calibration curves were then used to determine the protein’s concentration. Presence or absence of stress granules was manually annotated. For Corelet phase diagrams, phase separation was assessed based on whether visible “puncta” formed following a 5-min activation time course (6 s intervals between images). Only fully activated cells were considered to avoid confounding effects related to diffusion-based capture ( Bracha et al., 2018 12. Bracha, D. ∙ Walls, M.T. ∙ Wei, M.-T. ... Mapping Local and Global Liquid Phase Behavior in Living Cells Using Photo-Oligomerizable Seeds Cell. 2018; 175 :1467-1480.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Individual regions of interest, which remained in the field of view throughout the time course, were manually selected. Standard deviations were calculated from the measured mCherry intensity and were normalized by the standard deviation at the first frame taken.
The concentration of each cell was determined via manual image segmentation as previously described, and absence or presence of stress granules was annotated. To determine a boundary from the data, a support vector machine (SVM) trained using the concentrations of the two components as explanatory variables and the categorical stress granule state as a response variable by applying the fitcsvm() function in the MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning package using the default solver. Briefly, a support vector machine constructs a linear decision surface based on boundary points (“support vectors”), with the assumption that the data is linearly separable. In this two-dimensional case, the parameters of slope and intercept were extracted to calculate the minimal G3BP concentration for stress granule formation as well as the stoichiometry of interactions with proteins of interest (i.e., the slope of the corresponding line).
For each phase diagram, mean concentrations of both iLID-GFP-Fe core and mCherry-sspB-tagged proteins were calculated and assigned to the category of having or not having stress granules. To determine phase threshold boundaries in an automated and unbiased fashion, an SVM regressor was again used, using the core concentration and log2-transformed valence as explanatory variables with the presence of phase separated structures as a categorical response variable. However, because the data was not linearly separable, a polynomial kernel with degree = 2 was used to account for the curvature of the phase threshold. Then, to calculate the decision surface, the score of the SVM was calculated at all points in a 50-by-50 grid in the phase diagram, and a contour line representing the phase threshold was drawn connecting points with a score of 0 using MATLAB’s contour () function. Specific values for threshold valence at specified core concentrations were then calculated by linearly interpolating the zero-score contour line.
For each experiment, the concentration of the protein of interest was determined for each cell, and the presence (or absence) of stress granules was categorized. The threshold concentration of inhibition (or rescue) was defined as the concentration of protein of interest at which cells had a 50 percent chance of having stress granules. Specifically, the probability density was calculated by binning the concentration distribution using a square root number rule. Within each bin, the probability of having stress granules was calculated as the number of cells with stress granules over the total number of cells in that bin. This results in a monotonic function; its value at a probability of 0.5 was then interpolated to determine the threshold concentration of inhibition or rescue. This was repeated for each replicate and standard error of the mean between replicates was used to determine error bars. The bin size was used as the error if it was greater than that calculated for the SEM or in experiments with a single replicate.
To determine partition coefficients (PCs) of fluorescently tagged proteins of interest into stress granules (marker = GFP-CAPRIN1 or mCherry-CAPRIN1), confocal microscopy images were taken at three different settings to prevent oversaturation of the images in both fluorescent channels (488, GFP; 546, mCherry). For each set of images, the image with the highest intensities yet lacking saturated pixels was analyzed. Stress granules (SGs) were first segmented in the CAPRIN1 channel by applying a Laplacian of Gaussians (LoG) filter with a kernel size of 6-pixels to the image. The resulting image was then thresholded and a mask from pixels with a LoG intensity of greater than 1.5 standard deviations was generated. Pixels near the border of the image or SGs containing fewer than 9-pixels were removed from the analysis. To determine the intensity inside SGs while avoiding intensity gradients near the edge of the SGs, masks were thinned. Likewise, to calculate the background intensity near but outside the SGs, an annulus was constructed by subtracting a mask thickened 8-times from that thickened 4-times from the original thresholded image (bwmorph, MATLAB2018b). Then, for each identified SG, an average intensity inside and outside the SG was calculated by background subtracting and averaging the intensities of the corresponding pixels in the fluorescently tagged protein of interest channel based on the aforementioned segmentation of the CAPRIN1 channel. The partition coefficient (PC) was calculated by solving the following linear system: PC ∗ I in = I out (mldivide, MATLAB2018b). Error was calculated from the standard error of the mean of intensity I in and I out and then propagated by combining in quadrature.
We adapted the SAFT formalism ( Chapman et al., 1989 17. Chapman, W.G. ∙ Gubbins, K.E. ∙ Jackson, G. ... Saft: Equation-of-State Solution Model for Associating Fluids Fluid Phase Equilib. 1989; 52 :31-38 Crossref Google Scholar ) to model a mixture of colloidal particles with associative interactions, in which each binding site can engage in at most one bond at a time. A colloid in this model refers either to a protein monomer or complex, or to a substrate monomer. Denoting the number of binding sites of type 𝐴 on a colloid of type 𝑖 by 𝑓 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 , we used a prescribed PPI network to specify which binding site pairs ( 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 , 𝑗 ⁢ 𝐵 ) are allowed to interact. Our SAFT-based approach requires two key approximations ( Jacobs et al., 2014 42. Jacobs, W.M. ∙ Oxtoby, D.W. ∙ Frenkel, D. Phase separation in solutions with specific and nonspecific interactions J. Chem. Phys. 2014; 140 :204109 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ): First, we used a mixture of colloids with no attractive interactions as the reference state, which means that spatial correlations due to associative interactions are not taken into account. Second, the functional form of the free energy assumes that correlations among binding site availabilities can be ignored.
Defining the volume fraction occupied by colloids of type 𝑖 as 𝜑 𝑖 , the total dimensionless Helmholtz free energy density, 𝐹 / 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 , is ( Jacobs et al., 2014; Michelsen and Hendriks, 2001 42.

Michelsen, M.L. ∙ Hendriks, E.M. Physical properties from association models Fluid Phase Equilib. 2001; 180 :165-174 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) 𝐹 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 = 𝐹 r e f 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 + ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝜇 a s s o c , 𝑖 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 ) ⁢ 𝜑 𝑖 − 𝑃 a s s o c 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 , 𝐹 r e f 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 = ∑ 𝑖 𝜑 𝑖 ⁢ l o g ⁡ 𝜑 𝑖 + ( 1 − ∑ 𝑗 𝜑 𝑗 ) ⁢ l o g ⁡ ( 1 − ∑ 𝑗 𝜑 𝑗 ) , 𝜇 a s s o c , 𝑖 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 = ∑ 𝐴 𝑓 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ l o g ⁡ 𝑋 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 , 𝑃 a s s o c 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 = − 1 2 ⁢ ∑ 𝑖 𝜑 𝑖 ⁢ ∑ 𝐴 𝑓 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑋 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 ) , where 𝐹 r e f is the free energy of a reference system of colloids with no attractive interactions; 𝜇 a s s o c , 𝑖 and 𝑃 a s s o c are the associative contributions to the chemical potential of colloid type 𝑖 and the pressure, respectively; and 𝑋 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 denotes the fraction of binding sites of type 𝐴 on a colloid of type 𝑖 that are unbound at equilibrium. The expression for 𝑋 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 is given by the chemical equilibrium equations 𝑋 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 = [ 1 + ∑ 𝑗 𝜑 𝑗 ⁢ ∑ 𝐵 𝑓 𝑗 ⁢ 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑋 𝑗 ⁢ 𝐵 ⁢ 𝛥 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 , 𝑗 ⁢ 𝐵 ] − 1 , which must be solved self-consistently at fixed { 𝜑 𝑖 } . The interaction parameters { 𝛥 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 , 𝑗 ⁢ 𝐵 } are non-zero only for binding site pairs that are connected in the prescribed PPI network. We choose to work in the strong-binding regime, taking 𝛥 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 , 𝑗 ⁢ 𝐵 = 1 0 4 for all interacting binding site pairs, so that 𝑋 𝑖 ⁢ 𝐴 is determined primarily by the topology of the PPI network.
We identified the conditions for phase coexistence in two steps. First, we calculated the convex hull of a grid of points ( { 𝜑 𝑖 } , 𝐹 ⁡ [ { 𝜑 𝑖 } ] / 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 ) ( Mao et al., 2019; Wolff et al., 2011 58. Mao, S. ∙ Kuldinow, D. ∙ Haataja, M.P. ... Phase behavior and morphology of multicomponent liquid mixtures Soft Matter. 2019; 15 :1297-1311 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 101. Wolff, J. ∙ Marques, C.M. ∙ Thalmann, F. Thermodynamic approach to phase coexistence in ternary phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures Phys. Rev. Lett. 2011; 106 :128104 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified facets of the hull that correspond to coexistence regions by comparing the distances between the vertices of the facets to the minimum distance between adjacent points on the grid. In this way, we concluded that at most three phases can simultaneously coexist given the networks in Figures 7 A and 7B, and that at most two phases can coexist given the networks in Figures 7 C and 7D. The values of { 𝜑 𝑖 } at the vertices of a facet approximate the coexistence concentrations at the chemical potential vector, { 𝜇 𝑖 / 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 ≡ ∂ ( 𝐹 / 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 ) / ∂ 𝜑 𝑖 } , determined from the facet normal vector.
We then used the discretized convex hull results as a starting point for higher-precision phase-coexistence calculations. These off-grid calculations were used to tune { 𝜑 𝑖 } and { 𝜇 𝑖 } to ensure equal chemical potentials and pressures among all phases, as required for coexistence at equilibrium ( Rubinstein, 2003 81. Rubinstein, M. Polymer physics Oxford University Press, New York, 2003 Crossref Google Scholar ). However, specifying three-phase (two-phase) coexistence in a mixture of four colloid types leaves two (three) other degrees of freedom undetermined. We therefore needed to specify the chemical potential differences among three components in Figures 7 A and 7B and among four components in Figures 7 C and 7D. In Figure 7 A, we started from the coexistence facet with { 𝜇 𝑖 } closest in chemical potential space to the centroid of all three-phase coexistence facets, and then fixed the chemical potential differences 𝜇 N o d e 1 − 𝜇 S u b s t r a t e = 0 . 8 5 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 and 𝜇 B r i d g e − 𝜇 N o d e 1 = 3 . 5 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 . For the sake of comparison, we chose the same fixed chemical potential differences in Figures 7 B–7D. In Figures 7 C and 7D, we chose the additional chemical potential difference 𝜇 N o d e 2 − 𝜇 B r i d g e to be equal to the value obtained from the three-phase coexistence calculation in Figure 7 A.
To generate the free-energy plots shown in Figure 7 , we calculated Δ ⁢ 𝐹 ⁡ ( { 𝜑 𝑖 } , { 𝜇 ( c o e x ) 𝑖 } ) 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 = 𝐹 ⁡ ( { 𝜑 𝑖 } ) 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 − ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝜇 ( c o e x ) 𝑖 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 ) ⁢ 𝜑 𝑖 , at the coexistence chemical potential vector { 𝜇 ( c o e x ) 𝑖 } . We then plotted Δ ⁢ 𝐹 / 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 along a linear path through concentration space, { Δ ⁢ 𝜑 𝑖 } , between each pair of coexisting phases. In Figures 7 C and 7D, where there is no stable 𝛼 phase, we calculated the free energy along a linear path to the location of the 𝛼 phase in panel A. The compositions reported on the free-energy plots are the volume fractions of the components present in each phase, normalized by the total colloid volume fraction in that phase and rounded to the nearest 5%.
We note in the main text that the increased free-energy barrier height between the 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases in Figure 7 B tends to disfavor wetting of these phases. Strictly speaking, the three-phase junction ( 𝛼 , 𝛽 , and dilute) pictured in the cartoon in Figure 7 A is mechanically stable when the surface tension between the 𝛼 and 𝛽 phases, 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 , is less than the sum of the surface tensions between the other pairs of phases, 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ D i l + 𝛾 𝛽 ⁢ D i l ( de Gennes, 2004 22. de Gennes, P.-G. Capillarity and wetting phenomena: drops, bubbles, pearls, waves Springer, New York, 2004 Crossref Google Scholar ). According to the Cahn–Hilliard theory of planar interfaces ( Cahn and Hilliard, 1958 16. Cahn, J.W. ∙ Hilliard, J.E. Free Energy of a Nonuniform System 0.1. Interfacial Free Energy J. Chem. Phys. 1958; 28 :258-267 Crossref Google Scholar ), 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 ∝ ∫ 𝛽 𝛼 𝑑 ⁡ ( 𝛥 ⁢ 𝜑 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 ) ⁢ [ Δ ⁢ 𝐹 ⁡ ( 𝛥 ⁢ 𝜑 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 ) / 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑇 ] 1 / 2 where 𝛥 ⁢ 𝜑 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 is the distance along a linear path in concentration space between the phases 𝛼 and 𝛽 . Assuming that the constant of proportionality is roughly the same for all pairs of phases, we find that 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 < ̃ 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ D i l + 𝛾 𝛽 ⁢ D i l in Figure 7 A, while 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ 𝛽 > 𝛾 𝛼 ⁢ D i l + 𝛾 𝛽 ⁢ D i l in Figure 7 B. Nevertheless, the true morphologies depend on the exact values of these proportionality constants, the minimum-free-energy paths through concentration space that connect the phases, the curvature of the physical interfaces, and other details that are beyond the scope of this minimal model.
Importantly, the qualitative features of these plots, including the number of phases in the coexistence region and the relative heights of the barriers, are relatively insensitive to the choice of Δ ⁢ 𝜇 values. We also verified that these qualitative features are not sensitive to variations in the relative binding interaction parameters.
