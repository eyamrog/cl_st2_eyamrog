Title: Adrenergic Signaling in Muscularis Macrophages Limits Infection-Induced Neuronal Loss


Abstract: Summary

Enteric-associated neurons (EANs) are closely associated with immune cells and continuously monitor and modulate homeostatic intestinal functions, including motility and nutrient sensing. Bidirectional interactions between neuronal and immune cells are altered during disease processes such as neurodegeneration or irritable bowel syndrome. We investigated the effects of infection-induced inflammation on intrinsic EANs (iEANs) and the role of intestinal muscularis macrophages (MMs) in this context. Using murine models of enteric infections, we observed long-term gastrointestinal symptoms, including reduced motility and loss of excitatory iEANs, which was mediated by a Nlrp6- and Casp11- dependent mechanism, depended on infection history, and could be reversed by manipulation of the microbiota. MMs responded to luminal infection by upregulating a neuroprotective program via β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 -AR) signaling and mediated neuronal protection through an arginase 1-polyamine axis. Our results identify a mechanism of neuronal death post-infection and point to a role for tissue-resident MMs in limiting neuronal damage.

Section: Introduction

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract comprises the largest environmental interface of the body and is posed with the unique challenge of maintaining tolerance to dietary and microbial antigens while protecting against pathogen invasion. Coordinated tolerance and resistance mechanisms serve to prevent pathogen dissemination, limit GI damage, and initiate repair responses induced by pathogenic burden or injury ( Medzhitov et al., 2012 44. Medzhitov, R. ∙ Schneider, D.S. ∙ Soares, M.P. Disease tolerance as a defense strategy Science. 2012; 335 :936-941 Crossref Scopus (1204) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the GI tract, infections can result in functional GI disorders post-pathogen clearance, and often, enteric neurons—which occupy the intestinal tissue in large numbers—are targeted ( Balemans et al., 2017 3. Balemans, D. ∙ Mondelaers, S.U. ∙ Cibert-Goton, V. ... Evidence for long-term sensitization of the bowel in patients with post-infectious-IBS Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :13606 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical observations indicate that between 6%–17% of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) develop symptoms after episodes of enteric infections, while around 10% of people with bacterial gastroenteritis develop IBS ( Holschneider et al., 2011; Ohman and Simrén, 2010 29. Holschneider, D.P. ∙ Bradesi, S. ∙ Mayer, E.A. The role of experimental models in developing new treatments for irritable bowel syndrome Expert Rev. Gastroenterol.

Hepatol. 2010; 7 :163-173 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, HSV-1 and flavivirus strains with neuronal tropism, including West Nile and Zika viruses, have also been reported to induce long-term intestinal dysmotility ( Khoury-Hanold et al., 2016; White et al., 2018 35.

Intestinal Dysmotility Syndromes following Systemic Infection by Flaviviruses Cell. 2018; 175 :1198-1212.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The clinical presentation of post-infectious IBS includes unresolved low-grade intestinal inflammation, GI motility impairment, and nerve damage ( Beatty et al., 2014; Holschneider et al., 2011 4. Beatty, J.K. ∙ Bhargava, A. ∙ Buret, A.G. Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome: mechanistic insights into chronic disturbances following enteric infection World J.

The role of experimental models in developing new treatments for irritable bowel syndrome Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2011; 5 :43-57 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the underlying mechanisms involved in infection-induced neuronal damage are incompletely understood.
The intestinal immune and nervous systems sense and integrate luminal cues and regulate physiological processes, including GI motility. Recent evidence suggests that intestinal-resident macrophage populations play a role in normal functioning of enteric neurons in the absence of infections ( De Schepper et al., 2018; Muller et al., 2014 15. De Schepper, S. ∙ Verheijden, S. ∙ Aguilera-Lizarraga, J. ...

Crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons regulates gastrointestinal motility Cell. 2014; 158 :300-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, muscularis macrophages (MMs), located within and surrounding the myenteric plexus, were shown to regulate the activity of enteric neurons and peristalsis via secretion of BMP2 in a microbiota-dependent manner ( Muller et al., 2014 45. Muller, P.A. ∙ Koscsó, B. ∙ Rajani, G.M. ... Crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons regulates gastrointestinal motility Cell. 2014; 158 :300-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, we previously reported that MMs displayed a tissue-protective gene expression profile, a signature that was enhanced following enteric infection, and involved β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 -AR) signaling ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remained to be determined, however, whether this neuron-macrophage crosstalk plays a role in infection-induced neuronal damage, or prevention thereof.
By utilizing imaging, cell-sorting-independent transcriptomics, pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches, surgical lesioning, and chemogenetic manipulations, we report that murine enteric infections result in a rapid and persistent loss of intrinsic enteric-associated neurons (iEANs), which is associated with long–term GI changes including intestinal dysmotility, via the non-canonical inflammasome components Nlrp6 and Casp11 . Myeloid-specific targeting of β 2 -AR, as well as arginase 1 (Arg1), coupled with pharmacological rescue experiments and exogenous activation of gut-sympathetic neurons implicated MM-adrenergic signaling in post-infectious enteric neuronal protection via production of polyamines. Our data uncover a novel mechanism of enteric neuronal cell death and identify a functional role for neuron-macrophage interactions in limiting infection-induced neuronal damage.

Section: Results

Acute bacterial infections, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Shigella dysenteriae , and Campylobacter spp ., have previously been linked to post-infectious IBS ( Ohman and Simrén, 2010 48. Ohman, L. ∙ Simrén, M. Pathogenesis of IBS: role of inflammation, immunity and neuroimmune interactions Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2010; 7 :163-173 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). To characterize functional consequences of acute bacterial infection in mice, we used an attenuated strain of S. Typhimurium, spiB ( Tsolis et al., 1999 60. Tsolis, R.M. ∙ Townsend, S.M. ∙ Miao, E.A. ... Identification of a putative Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium host range factor with homology to IpaH and YopM by signature-tagged mutagenesis Infect. Immun. 1999; 67 :6385-6393 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which harbors a mutation in the type III secretion system, impacting its intracellular replication. We chose to use spiB because wild-type (WT) S. Typhimurium rapidly invades and damages the intestinal wall, resulting in mortality in WT C57BL/6 mice, thus barring long-term functional studies post-pathogen clearance. We observed that orally administered spiB was undetected in the feces by 7–10 days post-infection (dpi) ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Infection with spiB caused mild intestinal inflammation as evidenced by increased levels of fecal lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2), which remained elevated after pathogen clearance ( Figure 1 C). This persistent inflammatory response was associated with lasting GI functional changes, including increased ileal ring contractility and a persistent delay in GI transit time (GITT) ( Figures 1 D and 1E).
Changes in contractility and GITT can be associated with altered neuronal activity and nerve damage ( Travagli and Anselmi, 2016 59. Travagli, R.A. ∙ Anselmi, L. Vagal neurocircuitry and its influence on gastric motility Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 13 :389-401 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). iEANs, commonly referred to as the enteric nervous system, are organized in two distinct networks: the submucosal or Meissner’s and myenteric or Auerbach’s plexuses ( Furness et al., 2013 23. Furness, J.B. ∙ Rivera, L.R. ∙ Cho, H.J. ... The gut as a sensory organ Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10 :729-740 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to determine the impact of intestinal infection on iEANs, we quantified enteric neurons along the GI tract in both the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. Following spiB infection, we observed a 20%–30% reduction in myenteric neurons 7 dpi in the ileum and colon, both of which are major sites of Salmonella invasion; reduced neuronal counts were observed up to 126 dpi ( Figures 1 F and 1G). In contrast, neuronal numbers were preserved in the proximal small intestine, where Salmonella invasion normally does not occur, and the submucosal plexus; additionally, heat-killed spiB did not result in myenteric iEAN loss ( Figures 1 H–1I and S1 A). Loss of iEANs was also observed after infection with another enteric bacterial pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ( Figure S1 B). We further interrogated whether we could recapitulate our findings in the context of the clinically relevant protozoan pathogens Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi , which are known to induce GI-related pathologies ( Dutra et al., 2009 18. Dutra, W.O. ∙ Menezes, C.A. ∙ Villani, F.N. ... Cellular and genetic mechanisms involved in the generation of protective and pathogenic immune responses in human Chagas disease Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2009; 104 :208-218 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). These protozoans also induced intestinal inflammation, increased ileal ring contractility, delayed GITT, and significant neuronal loss ( Figures S1 C–S1G) (data not shown). By contrast, infection with the intestinal helminth Strongyloides venezuelensis , which displays distinct duodenal tropism ( Esterházy et al., 2019 21. Esterházy, D. ∙ Canesso, M.C.C. ∙ Mesin, L. ... Compartmentalized gut lymph node drainage dictates adaptive immune responses Nature. 2019; 569 :126-130 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not lead to iEAN loss in either the proximal or distal intestine ( Figure S1 H). Together, these data indicate that iEAN loss may be a conserved feature of many, though not all, enteric infections; we chose to continue with spiB as an infection model because of the inherent neurotropism of T. gondii and T. cruzi .
While it is traditionally thought that mammalian enteric neurogenesis ceases postnatally, recent studies suggest continuous turnover of iEANs, for instance, by replenishment from Nestin+ stem cells ( Kulkarni et al., 2017 38. Kulkarni, S. ∙ Micci, M.A. ∙ Leser, J. ... Adult enteric nervous system in health is maintained by a dynamic balance between neuronal apoptosis and neurogenesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E3709-E3718 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, in the present study, we were not able to detect iEAN number recovery up to four months after spiB clearance nor observe changes in Nestin GFP+ cell networks in the myenteric plexus ( Figure S1 I). As an orthogonal approach, we evaluated the involvement of enteric glia, which have been shown to replenish iEANs in response to injury ( Laranjeira et al., 2011 39. Laranjeira, C. ∙ Sandgren, K. ∙ Kessaris, N. ... Glial cells in the mouse enteric nervous system can undergo neurogenesis in response to injury J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :3412-3424 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ), in neuronal maintenance after spiB infection. Using an inducible Sox10 RiboTag fate mapping strategy, we found that approximately 10% of iEANs were hemagglutinin positive (HA+) four months following tamoxifen administration to adult Sox10 RiboTag control mice, suggesting a glial origin of these cells. However, we did not observe iEAN recovery nor changes in the frequency of HA+ cells in the ileum myenteric plexus of Sox10 RiboTag mice infected with spiB in the same period of time ( Figure S1 J). These results indicate that without further manipulations, iEAN loss is persistent in this model of infection.
Given the significant reduction in ileal and colonic myenteric neurons resulting from a single spiB infection, we asked whether subsequent infections would exacerbate iEAN damage. Following clearance of spiB, we infected mice with WT Salmonella , after which we observed no additional iEAN loss. This indicates a possible restructuring or adaptation of tissue cells preventing further damage ( Figure 1 J). To exclude the contribution of adaptive immunological memory, we performed infection challenge with spiB and Y. pseudotuberculosis , bacterial pathogens that resulted in iEAN loss post-primary infections. Primary infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis resulted in iEAN protection against secondary challenge with spiB , and conversely, initial iEAN loss with primary spiB infection was not enhanced with subsequent Y. pseudotuberculosis infection ( Figure 1 K). The above results demonstrate that infections with different enteric pathogens induce prolonged low-grade inflammation and GI dysmotility, which are associated with a rapid and self-limiting, yet persistent loss of iEANs.
Human post-infectious IBS generally leads to long-term, but reversible GI symptoms and neuropathy ( Beatty et al., 2014; Ohman and Simrén, 2010 4. Beatty, J.K. ∙ Bhargava, A. ∙ Buret, A.G. Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome: mechanistic insights into chronic disturbances following enteric infection World J. Gastroenterol. 2014; 20 :3976-3985 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar 48. Ohman, L. ∙ Simrén, M. Pathogenesis of IBS: role of inflammation, immunity and neuroimmune interactions Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2010; 7 :163-173 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, here, we did not observe recovery of neurons after a single infection. Because of reported effects of microbiota on the development and maintenance of enteric neurons, including recent work from our group ( Muller et al., 2019; Obata and Pachnis, 2016 46. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Kerner, Z. ... Microbes modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar 47. Obata, Y. ∙ Pachnis, V. The Effect of Microbiota and the Immune System on the Development and Organization of the Enteric Nervous System Gastroenterology. 2016; 151 :836-844 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), we assessed whether persistent changes in microbial composition (dysbiosis) could explain the lack of iEAN recovery post-infection. We infected specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice with spiB , administered broad-spectrum antibiotics after bacterial clearance, and subsequently re-colonized the animals with SPF microbiota. This reconstitution of a “normal” or pre-infection microbiota allowed for iEAN recovery, effects that were correlated with a reduction in a member of the Erysipelotrichaceae family and Bacteriodales order when compared with untreated-infected mice ( Figures 1 L, S1 K, and S1L). These data point to a role for the gut microbiota in the recovery of iEANs post-infection.
iEANs comprise a numerous and heterogeneous population of neurons that monitor and respond to various environmental cues, including mechanical stretch and luminal metabolites ( Furness et al., 2013 23. Furness, J.B. ∙ Rivera, L.R. ∙ Cho, H.J. ... The gut as a sensory organ Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10 :729-740 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first asked whether the observed loss of iEANs could be explained by a decrease of ELAVL3/4 protein expression. We interbred pan-neuronal Snap25 Cre with Rpl22 lsl-HA (RiboTag) mice ( Sanz et al., 2009 55. Sanz, E. ∙ Yang, L. ∙ Su, T. ... Cell-type-specific isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA from complex tissues Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :13939-13944 Crossref Scopus (618) PubMed Google Scholar ), which express a HA-tagged ribosomal subunit 22. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of HA+ cells in the myenteric plexus confirmed identical loss of iEANs previously determined by ANNA-1 staining ( Figure 2 A) ( Muller et al., 2019 46. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Kerner, Z. ... Microbes modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). In cases of overt intestinal inflammation, an indiscriminate loss of iEANs have previously been reported ( Mawe, 2015 42. Mawe, G.M. Colitis-induced neuroplasticity disrupts motility in the inflamed and post-inflamed colon J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :949-955 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of enteric infection, to investigate whether specific neuronal subsets were preferentially lost, we used confocal IF imaging to evaluate the impact on excitatory and inhibitory iEAN populations ( Zeisel et al., 2018 66. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lonnerberg, P. ... Molecular Architecture of the Mouse Nervous System Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ). Imaging of the ileum myenteric plexus from Slc17a6 td-Tomato (VGLUT2) reporter mice revealed a significant reduction in the total number and percentage of excitatory VGLUT2+ neurons post- spiB infection ( Figure 2 B). In contrast, quantification of inhibitory neuronal nitric oxide synthase-positive (nNOS+) and somatostatin-positive (SST+) iEANs revealed no changes and a relative increase post-infection, respectively ( Figures 2 C, 2D, S2 A, and S2B). These data suggest a preferential loss of excitatory neuronal subsets post-infection, resulting in changes in the neurochemical representation of iEANs, and may provide an explanation for the observed GI functional changes.
To gain insights into a possible mechanism involved in infection-induced iEAN loss, we used neuronal-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP) with Snap25 RiboTag mice, which allow neuronal-specific immunoprecipitation of actively translated mRNA ( Muller et al., 2019 46. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Kerner, Z. ... Microbes modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We compared iEANs with extrinsic neurons in the nodose ganglia (NG) of Snap25 RiboTag mice. Expression of HA-tagged ribosomes was confirmed in neurons of the myenteric plexus and NG of Snap25 RiboTag mice ( Figure S3 A). RNA sequencing analysis of immunoprecipitated intact mRNA bound to HA-tagged ribosomes (TRAP-seq) revealed iEAN-specific enrichment in genes encoding neuropeptides, such as neuromedin U ( Nmu ), as well as components of the inflammasome pathway (both canonical and non-canonical) including Nlrp6 , Pycard , Casp1 , and Casp11 ( Figure 3 A). These data indicate that iEANs possess the machinery for engaging an inflammasome- and caspase 1 and/or 11 (Casp1 and/or 11)-mediated cell death. Imaging analyses for the expression of the inflammasome adaptor ASC (PYCARD) using an anti-ASC antibody in WT mice, or Rosa26 ASC:mCitrine (ASC mCitrine ) reporter mice, confirmed the expression of this inflammasome component by iEANs of both naive and spiB -infected mice ( Figures S3 B and S3C). To visualize the Nlrp6 expression pattern in iEANs, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on ileum and colon sections using RNAscope probes specific to Elavl4 (pan-neuronal) and Nlrp6 . We observed dense localization of Nlrp6 transcripts in the epithelium of the ileum and colon, similar to what has previously been reported ( Levy et al., 2015 40. Levy, M. ∙ Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ... Microbiota-Modulated Metabolites Shape the Intestinal Microenvironment by Regulating NLRP6 Inflammasome Signaling Cell. 2015; 163 :1428-1443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (699) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we visualized Nlrp6 transcripts in areas of Elavl4 -expressing cells in the muscularis , supporting the expression of Nlrp6 by myenteric neurons ( Figure 3 B). Analysis of data from single-cell transcriptional profiling of iEANs ( Zeisel et al., 2018 66. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lonnerberg, P. ... Molecular Architecture of the Mouse Nervous System Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated that Nlrp6 is highly enriched in excitatory iEANs compared with additional iEAN subsets ( Figure S3 D), providing an explanation for preferential loss of excitatory iEAN subsets during enteric infections.
To evaluate whether iEAN loss during infection is caspase-mediated, we first systemically administered a pan-caspase inhibitor (zVAD-FMK) to spiB -infected mice, which resulted in a reduction of iEAN loss ( Figure S3 E). We then directly addressed the role of caspases 1 and 11 in infection-induced iEAN loss by infecting Casp1 and 11 (ICE)-deficient or haplosufficient (ICE +/– ) mice with spiB . While ICE +/– mice exhibited pronounced iEAN loss 7 dpi, spiB -infected ICE –/– mice were completely protected from neuronal loss, despite similar bacterial clearance patterns ( Figures 3 C and 3D; Data S1 ). We further dissected the role of Casp1 and 11 separately by utilizing the 129S1/Sv mouse strain, which carries an inactivating mutation in the Casp11 locus (human Casp4 ) ( Kenneth et al., 2012 34. Kenneth, N.S. ∙ Younger, J.M. ∙ Hughes, E.D. ... An inactivating caspase 11 passenger mutation originating from the 129 murine strain in mice targeted for c-IAP1 Biochem. J. 2012; 443 :355-359 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). 129 mice infected with spiB exhibited no loss of colonic iEAN numbers as compared with non-infected controls ( Figures S3 F–S3J). This iEAN protection was independent of the ability of 129 mice to survive WT Salmonella infection because of expression of functional Nramp ( Brown et al., 2013 8. Brown, D.E. ∙ Libby, S.J. ∙ Moreland, S.M. ... Salmonella enterica causes more severe inflammatory disease in C57/BL6 Nramp1G169 mice than Sv129S6 mice Vet. Pathol. 2013; 50 :867-876 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) because CBA/J mice, which also express a functional Nramp but do not carry a Casp11 mutation, exhibited significant neuronal loss when infected with spiB despite similar clearance of the bacteria ( Figures S3 F–S3K) (data not shown). Furthermore, spiB infection did not result in iEAN loss in single Casp11 -deficient mice ( Figure 3 E). These data suggest Casp11-mediated cell death as a main mechanism involved in iEAN loss following Salmonella infection.
To define whether the NLRP6 inflammasome and Casp11-mediated mechanisms proposed above are neuron intrinsic, we utilized two in vivo approaches of neuronal-specific gene deletion. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of AAV9 with neuronal-specific promoters can target iEANs, ( Gombash et al., 2014 26. Gombash, S.E. ∙ Cowley, C.J. ∙ Fitzgerald, J.A. ... Intravenous AAV9 efficiently transduces myenteric neurons in neonate and juvenile mice Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2014; 7 :81 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we confirmed with i.v. administration of AAV9-hSyn-eGFP-Cre to Rosa26 lsl-tdTomato reporter mice ( Figure S3 L). To remove Casp11 from iEANs, we i.v.-injected Casp11 flox/flox mice with AAV9-hSyn-eGFP-Cre or control AAV9-hSyn-eGFP viruses ( Figures 3 F–3H). We detected Cre-expressing AAV9 in 60%–90% of myenteric iEANs ( Figures 3 G–3J). Upon infection with spiB, we found no iEAN loss in mice injected with Cre-expressing AAV9 as compared with mice receiving the control virus ( Figures 3 I and 3J), suggesting that neuronal-intrinsic Casp11 expression is required for Salmonella -induced iEAN loss.
To address whether post-infectious iEAN loss is dependent on neuronal NLRP6, we crossed Snap25 RiboTag mice with Nlrp6 -floxed ( Nlrp6 flox/flox ) mice ( Figure S3 M). We infected Snap25 ΔNlrp6 , Snap25 RiboTag Nlrp6 flox/+ heterozygous, and (Cre−) Nlrp6 flox/flox control mice with spiB and quantified iEAN numbers. While both heterozygous and Cre– controls showed reduced iEAN numbers upon spiB infection, Snap25 ΔNlrp6 did not display iEAN loss ( Figure 3 K). Together, the above data implicate neuronal-specific NLRP6 and Casp11 as main effectors of iEAN death following Salmonella infection.
Tissue-resident MMs, the most abundant immune cell population in the myenteric region, are closely juxtaposed to iEANs and have been linked to normal functioning of these neurons during homeostasis ( De Schepper et al., 2018; Gabanyi et al., 2016; Muller et al., 2014 15. De Schepper, S. ∙ Verheijden, S. ∙ Aguilera-Lizarraga, J. ... Self-Maintaining Gut Macrophages Are Essential for Intestinal Homeostasis Cell. 2018; 175 :400-415 e413 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Muller, P.A. ∙ Koscsó, B. ∙ Rajani, G.M. ... Crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons regulates gastrointestinal motility Cell. 2014; 158 :300-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our previous observations suggested that MMs possess a tissue-protective gene signature, including expression of Retnla , Mrc1 , Cd163 , and Il10 at steady state ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate a possible role of MMs in infection-induced iEAN loss, we first depleted MMs using an antibody-blocking colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)-signaling, AFS98 (α-CSF1R), using a dose that preferentially depletes MMs over lamina propria macrophages ( Muller et al., 2014 45. Muller, P.A. ∙ Koscsó, B. ∙ Rajani, G.M. ... Crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons regulates gastrointestinal motility Cell. 2014; 158 :300-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 A, S4 A, and S4B). Continuous α-CSF1R-mediated MM depletion did not impact iEAN numbers during steady state but resulted in an enhanced iEAN loss upon spiB infection compared with mice treated with the control antibody, despite similar bacterial load ( Figure 4 B; Data S1 ). These results indicate that, while short-term depletion of MMs does not impact iEAN survival in the unperturbed state, MMs may play an iEAN-protective role during enteric infection.
Glial cells, both in the CNS and periphery, have been reported to mediate neuronal protection ( Brown et al., 2016 9. Brown, I.A. ∙ McClain, J.L. ∙ Watson, R.E. ... Enteric glia mediate neuron death in colitis through purinergic pathways that require connexin-43 and nitric oxide Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 2 :77-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus evaluated their involvement in infection-induced iEAN loss or limiting thereof. To target enteric glia, we used mice carrying tamoxifen-inducible Cre under the glia-specific Plp1 promotor ( Plp1 CreER ) and the lox -stop- lox - DTA transgene in the Rosa26 locus ( Rao et al., 2017 52. Rao, M. ∙ Rastelli, D. ∙ Dong, L. ... Enteric Glia Regulate Gastrointestinal Motility but Are Not Required for Maintenance of the Epithelium in Mice Gastroenterology. 2017; 153 :1068-1081.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Depletion of glia in Plp1 iDTA mice before infection with spiB led to a similar loss of iEANs as tamoxifen-treated controls, indicating that enteric glia play neither a neuroprotective nor neurodetrimental role in this context ( Figures 4 C and 4D).
Next, we used confocal imaging to investigate MM dynamics upon early infection, which revealed a continuing presence and intercalation into ganglia of the myenteric plexus ( Figures 4 E and S4 C). To assess whether inflammatory monocytes recruited from the circulation are involved in infection-induced neuronal damage, we used CCR2 –/– mice, which exhibit an impairment in mobilizing inflammatory monocytes into tissues ( Boring et al., 1997 6. Boring, L. ∙ Gosling, J. ∙ Chensue, S.W. ... Impaired monocyte migration and reduced type 1 (Th1) cytokine responses in C-C chemokine receptor 2 knockout mice J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 :2552-2561 Crossref Scopus (915) PubMed Google Scholar ). CCR2 –/– mice failed to clear spiB infection, likely reflecting reduced resistance in the mucosal layer ( Dunay et al., 2008 17. Dunay, I.R. ∙ Damatta, R.A. ∙ Fux, B. ... Gr1(+) inflammatory monocytes are required for mucosal resistance to the pathogen Toxoplasma gondii Immunity. 2008; 29 :306-317 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ), and showed a mild acceleration rather than a delay in GITT ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Nonetheless, CCR2 –/– mice showed similar iEAN loss as WT control mice (~25%), suggesting that the persistent luminal pathogen load does not cause an increase in neuronal damage ( Figure S4 F). These data highlight that intestinal macrophages recently differentiated from circulating monocyte precursors may contribute to spiB clearance mechanisms but are not required for post-infectious iEAN death. Together, the above results suggest a critical response of resident MMs to luminal pathogenic stimulation; while likely not essential for resistance mechanisms, they appear to prevent excessive neuronal damage.
We previously reported that the anti-inflammatory gene-expression profile of MMs was further enhanced following enteric infection via β 2 -AR ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated the capacity of β 2 -AR signaling to mediate tissue protection by coupling pharmacological and genetic modulation of this pathway. First, we infected C57BL/6 mice with spiB while continuously administering a selective β 2 -AR agonist (salbutamol) via osmotic pumps. While not affecting pathogen load, salbutamol treatment protected mice from iEAN loss ( Figure 4 F; Data S1 ). To directly assess the role of MMs in salbutamol-mediated neuroprotection, we depleted MM using α-CSF1R in mice receiving salbutamol. While we observed a rescue of iEAN death in mice treated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype control antibody, MM depletion led to a loss of salbutamol-mediated iEAN protection ( Figure 4 G). Together, these data suggest that MMs are critical for β 2 -AR-mediated iEAN protection.
We complemented these findings using a genetic approach by interbreeding mice carrying Cre recombinase under the myeloid Lyz2 promoter (LysM Cre ) with Adrb2 flox/flox mice ( Hinoi et al., 2008 28. Hinoi, E. ∙ Gao, N. ∙ Jung, D.Y. ... The sympathetic tone mediates leptin’s inhibition of insulin secretion by modulating osteocalcin bioactivity J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183 :1235-1242 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). The specificity of Cre-targeting of macrophages in the intestinal muscularis was confirmed by IF and TRAP-seq analysis of LysM Δ Adrb2: RiboTag and LysM Adrbfl/: RiboTag mice, which demonstrated macrophage-restricted HA expression, enrichment for macrophage-specific genes, and specific loss of Adrb2 ( Figures 5 A–5C). Additionally, while we found occasional ectopic Cre expression in extrinsic ganglia, we were unable to detect iEAN recombination ( Figure S5 A). We did not detect infiltrating neutrophils, also targeted by Lyz2 , in the intestinal muscularis at steady state or early post-infection, suggesting that neutrophil-β 2 -AR signaling does not play a major role in this model (data not shown). Moreover, we found no differences in iEAN numbers or GITT in between LysM Δ Adrb2 and Cre− littermates during homeostasis ( Figures S5 B and S5C). LysM Δ Adrb2 and Cre− littermates exhibited similar spiB clearance upon infection ( Figure 5 D). However, LysM Δ Adrb2 mice had further increased fecal Lcn-2 levels post-infection, suggesting a role for myeloid-specific β 2 -AR signaling in modulating infection-induced inflammation ( Figure 5 E). This was accompanied by prolonged GITT, which persisted long-term post- spiB clearance, an increased loss of iEANs, and enhanced alterations in ileal ring contractility ( Figures 5 F, 5G, and S5 D). We then infected LysM Δ Adrb2 mice and Cre− littermates receiving continuous salbutamol treatment, which resulted in prevention of iEAN loss in Cre− littermates carrying intact myeloid β 2 -AR. However, this neuroprotection was absent in salbutamol-treated LysM Δ Adrb2 mice ( Figure 5 H). These data establish a role for β 2 -AR signaling in intestinal macrophages that contributes to a neuroprotective program following enteric infection.
We noted that mice intraperitoneally (i.p.)-injected multiple times with IgG isotype antibody (as in MM-depletion experiments) or mice anesthetized with isoflurane (as in control pump experiments) did not lose usual ~25% iEAN numbers post- spiB infection, suggesting that stress-induced local or systemic catecholamine release could trigger the same protective pathway in MMs. Indeed, a short pulse of isoflurane anesthesia or i.p. injections of PBS or IgG isotype antibody were sufficient to prevent iEAN death following spiB infection, indicating that stress signals able to potentiate β 2 -AR signaling may help prevent post-infectious iEAN loss ( Figures S6 A and S6B). In light of these findings, we sought to determine whether systemic release of catecholamines from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis could play a role in neuronal protection during infection. We performed bilateral adrenalectomy on WT mice and compared iEAN loss upon spiB infection with sham-operated controls. Rather than enhanced iEAN loss observed in LysM Δ Adrb2 mice, adrenalectomized animals showed reduced neuronal loss, suggesting that systemic catecholamines were not required for iEAN protection and, furthermore, that additional stress hormones produced by the adrenal glands (corticosteroids) could play a detrimental role in enteric neuronal survival during intestinal infections ( Figures 6 A–6C).
We previously demonstrated that spiB infection led to a significant increase in the number of recently activated, cFos+ sympathetic neurons in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglion (CG-SMG) ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus assessed whether stimulation of these neurons is sufficient to drive MM-β 2 -AR-mediated tissue protection. We utilized two chemogenetic mouse models in which administration of the synthetic ligand Compound 21 to mice carrying an inactivating designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) driven by promoters that are active in sensory nodose ganglia neurons (SNS hM4Di or Phox2b hM4Di ) results in a significant increase in cFos expression by gut-projecting sympathetic neurons ( Muller et al., 2019 46. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Kerner, Z. ... Microbes modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We found that DREADD-induced activation of gut-projecting neurons prior to spiB infection both in SNS hM4Di and Phox2b hM4Di mice significantly rescued iEAN loss ( Figures 6 D and 6E). These results provide further support of a role for locally released catecholamines and β 2 -AR signaling in MMs in limiting inflammation-induced iEAN loss.
To dissect possible mechanisms in which MM β 2 -AR signaling is involved in preventing excessive tissue damage post-infection, we analyzed LysM Δ Adrb2 MM gene expression profiles. MMs sorted from Cre− littermates responded to spiB infection by upregulating tissue-protective genes upon infection, but we did not observe this upregulation in MMs sorted from infected LysM Δ Adrb2 mice ( Figure 7 A). Arginase 1 (Arg1) is known to mediate the production of neuroprotective polyamines such as spermine ( Cai et al., 2002 10. Cai, D. ∙ Deng, K. ∙ Mellado, W. ... Arginase I and polyamines act downstream from cyclic AMP in overcoming inhibition of axonal growth MAG and myelin in vitro Neuron. 2002; 35 :711-719 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ), which in turn was described to suppress NLRP6-inflammasome activation ( Levy et al., 2015 40. Levy, M. ∙ Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ... Microbiota-Modulated Metabolites Shape the Intestinal Microenvironment by Regulating NLRP6 Inflammasome Signaling Cell. 2015; 163 :1428-1443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (699) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate the participation of polyamines in iEAN cell death, we supplemented the drinking water of spiB -infected mice with spermine or with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which inhibits polyamine biosynthesis by selective and irreversible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) ( Koomoa et al., 2013 37. Koomoa, D.L. ∙ Geerts, D. ∙ Lange, I. ... DFMO/eflornithine inhibits migration and invasion downstream of MYCN and involves p27Kip1 activity in neuroblastoma Int. J. Oncol. 2013; 42 :1219-1228 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial load and clearance patterns were similar in either treatment condition; however, mice that received DFMO exhibited enhanced iEAN loss, while those receiving spermine showed a significant rescue post- spiB infection ( Figures 7 B and 7C; Data S1 ). Finally, we genetically addressed whether Arg1 activity in MMs was required for their protective role in infection-induced neuronal damage in the intestine by interbreeding LysM Cre and Arg1 flox/flox mice ( El Kasmi et al., 2008 20. El Kasmi, K.C. ∙ Qualls, J.E. ∙ Pesce, J.T. ... Toll-like receptor-induced arginase 1 in macrophages thwarts effective immunity against intracellular pathogens Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :1399-1406 Crossref Scopus (510) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not observe differences in iEAN numbers in LysM Δ Arg1 mice compared with Cre– controls during homeostasis ( Figure S7 A). Upon spiB infection, LysM Δ Arg1 also showed similar pathogen load and clearance patterns but a trend to increased GITT ( Figure S7 B; Data S1 ). However, loss of myeloid Arg1 heightened iEAN loss post- spiB infection ( Figure 7 D). Together, these results point to a functional role for a MM β 2 -AR-Arg1-polyamine axis in in limiting infection-induced enteric neuronal cell death.

Section: Discussion

Overt inflammation in response to infection can result in chronic immunopathology. In the GI tract, bacterial, viral, and protozoan infections are associated with intestinal neuropathy and the development of post-infectious IBS ( Beatty et al., 2014; Holschneider et al., 2011; Ohman and Simrén, 2010; White et al., 2018 4.

However, the understanding of underlying mechanisms involved in this process is largely lacking. Here, we provide evidence that MMs located in close proximity to enteric neurons prevent infection- or inflammation-induced tissue damage, perhaps an analogous function to that described for microglia in the CNS ( Davalos et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2015 14.

Most mechanisms proposed for inflammation-induced neuronal damage thus far are related to CNS neuroinflammation. The apparent link observed in our study, between having a “normal” microbiota and iEAN recovery, offers an interesting direction for studies of central and peripheral neuropathies. For instance, what are the mechanisms utilized by the gut microbiota to maintain, or rescue, neuronal populations? Do specific bacterial species play a beneficial or detrimental role in this process? Although certain inflammatory processes are essential for neuronal function and tissue physiology, including neuronal pruning and tissue repair ( Salter and Stevens, 2017 54. Salter, M.W. ∙ Stevens, B. Microglia emerge as central players in brain disease Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1018-1027 Crossref Scopus (1089) PubMed Google Scholar ), excessive inflammation often results in the production of neurotoxic factors such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( Crotti and Glass, 2015 12. Crotti, A. ∙ Glass, C.K. The choreography of neuroinflammation in Huntington’s disease Trends Immunol. 2015; 36 :364-373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). While some of these could play a role in enteric infections, our studies rather point to NLRP6 ligands, or alternative triggers of Casp11 cleavage, as mediators of infection-induced iEAN cell death. These results corroborate previous work describing a protective phenotype in Pycard –/– mice that did not lose enteric neurons following DNBS-induced colitis, a process that was shown not to involve the NLPR3 inflammasome ( Gulbransen et al., 2012 27. Gulbransen, B.D. ∙ Bashashati, M. ∙ Hirota, S.A. ... Activation of neuronal P2X7 receptor-pannexin-1 mediates death of enteric neurons during colitis Nat. Med. 2012; 18 :600-604 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike the indiscriminate iEAN loss previously observed in chemically induced murine colitis models ( Mawe, 2015 42. Mawe, G.M. Colitis-induced neuroplasticity disrupts motility in the inflamed and post-inflamed colon J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125 :949-955 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), our studies indicate infection-induced location- and subset-specific loss of excitatory iEANs. These data warrant further study and additional subset-specific analysis of EANs in the steady state or under pathological conditions. Nevertheless, we speculate that enteric neuronal utilization of components of the NLRP6 inflammasome machinery and downstream effectors, put forward here in the context of neuronal loss post-enteric infection, may be engaged in other contexts. For instance, as demonstrated in this issue of Cell , iEAN-mediated production of IL-18 can participate in pathogen resistance mechanisms ( Jarret et al., 2020 31. Jarret, A. ∙ Jackson, R. ∙ Duizer, C. ... Enteric Nervous System-Derived IL-18 Orchestrates Mucosal Barrier Immunity Cell. 2020; 180 Published online January 9, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, heterologous infection experiments suggest the existence of either a form of tissue memory (trained immunity) or a limited subset of enteric neurons expressing such inflammasome machinery—possibilities that warrant further investigation. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether neurodegenerative processes in the CNS also involve this or analogous pathways ( Song and Colonna, 2018 58. Song, W.M. ∙ Colonna, M. The identity and function of microglia in neurodegeneration Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1048-1058 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Previous studies have uncovered a potential role of monocytes, macrophages, and microglia in the induction or modulation of inflammation-induced neuropathy, CNS damage, and subsequent changes in animal behavior ( Aguzzi et al., 2013; D’Mello et al., 2013 1. Aguzzi, A. ∙ Barres, B.A. ∙ Bennett, M.L. Microglia: scapegoat, saboteur, or something else? Science. 2013; 339 :156-161 Crossref Scopus (667) PubMed Google Scholar 13. D’Mello, C. ∙ Riazi, K. ∙ Le, T. ... P-selectin-mediated monocyte-cerebral endothelium adhesive interactions link peripheral organ inflammation to sickness behaviors J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :14878-14888 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tissue-resident macrophage populations in the brain express pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and are believed to contribute significantly to dendritic spine remodeling ( Parkhurst et al., 2013; Song and Colonna, 2018 49. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1786) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Song, W.M. ∙ Colonna, M. The identity and function of microglia in neurodegeneration Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :1048-1058 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). The balance between the production of pro-inflammatory and tissue-protective factors by macrophage populations is likely to determine the pathological versus reparative role of these cells. In a model mimicking CNS virus infection, depletion of monocytes abrogated dendritic spine loss ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 49. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1786) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that in the CNS, multiple cell types can mediate similar effects. In the gut, lack of inflammatory monocytes failed to impact iEAN loss, suggesting a dependence on longer-lived resident macrophage populations, whose presence in the gut were only recently proposed ( De Schepper et al., 2018; Shaw et al., 2018 15. De Schepper, S. ∙ Verheijden, S. ∙ Aguilera-Lizarraga, J. ... Self-Maintaining Gut Macrophages Are Essential for Intestinal Homeostasis Cell. 2018; 175 :400-415 e413 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar 56.

Med. 2018; 215 :1507-1518 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under conditions of stress or inflammation, activation of enteric glia has also been linked to neuronal damage ( Brown et al., 2016; Gulbransen et al., 2012; Mayo et al., 2014 9. Brown, I.A. ∙ McClain, J.L. ∙ Watson, R.E. ... Enteric glia mediate neuron death in colitis through purinergic pathways that require connexin-43 and nitric oxide Cell. Mol. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2016; 2 :77-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Gulbransen, B.D. ∙ Bashashati, M. ∙ Hirota, S.A. ... Activation of neuronal P2X7 receptor-pannexin-1 mediates death of enteric neurons during colitis Nat. Med. 2012; 18 :600-604 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar 43.

Med. 2014; 20 :1147-1156 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet little is known about the relevance of glial-immune cell interactions in the GI tract. While our experiments depleting enteric glia did not suggest a major role in the infection-induced iEAN loss, it remains plausible that surrounding enteric glia, or MMs, induce neuronal damage in other contexts that were previously attributed to microglia in the brain ( Jin et al., 2016 32. Jin, S. ∙ Kim, J.G. ∙ Park, J.W. ... Hypothalamic TLR2 triggers sickness behavior via a microglia-neuronal axis Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :29424 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Both glial cells and tissue macrophages are also appreciated to prevent inflammation-induced damage in several contexts, as well as to initiate repair processes post-injury. In models of spinal cord injury, incoming monocytes are thought to mediate a functional recovery via secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators ( Shechter et al., 2009 57. Shechter, R. ∙ London, A. ∙ Varol, C. ... Infiltrating blood-derived macrophages are vital cells playing an anti-inflammatory role in recovery from spinal cord injury in mice PLoS Med. 2009; 6 :e1000113 Crossref Scopus (615) PubMed Google Scholar ), although an enhancement of inflammatory markers in macrophages was also shown to help CNS axonal regeneration ( Gensel et al., 2009 25. Gensel, J.C. ∙ Nakamura, S. ∙ Guan, Z. ... Macrophages promote axon regeneration with concurrent neurotoxicity J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :3956-3968 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data favor a neuroprotective role for MMs via upregulation of Arg1 and polyamine production, an analogous observation to previous studies suggesting that “alternatively activated” macrophages promote axonal growth or regeneration after CNS injury ( Cai et al., 2002; Kigerl et al., 2009 10. Cai, D. ∙ Deng, K. ∙ Mellado, W. ... Arginase I and polyamines act downstream from cyclic AMP in overcoming inhibition of axonal growth MAG and myelin in vitro Neuron. 2002; 35 :711-719 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Kigerl, K.A. ∙ Gensel, J.C. ∙ Ankeny, D.P. ... Identification of two distinct macrophage subsets with divergent effects causing either neurotoxicity or regeneration in the injured mouse spinal cord J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :13435-13444 Crossref Scopus (1713) PubMed Google Scholar ). While multiple studies of the CNS find a direct role for polyamines in neuro-regeneration ( Mahar and Cavalli, 2018 41. Mahar, M. ∙ Cavalli, V. Intrinsic mechanisms of neuronal axon regeneration Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2018; 19 :323-337 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data suggest a potential role for these molecules in preventing neuronal cell death modulation of the inflammasome. This possibility is supported by previous studies demonstrating that microbiota-derived spermine regulates NLRP6 signaling and intestinal epithelial cell secretion of IL-18 ( Levy et al., 2015 40. Levy, M. ∙ Thaiss, C.A. ∙ Zeevi, D. ... Microbiota-Modulated Metabolites Shape the Intestinal Microenvironment by Regulating NLRP6 Inflammasome Signaling Cell. 2015; 163 :1428-1443 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (699) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could also play tissue-protective roles in the enteric infection models described here. Nonetheless, macrophages differentiated toward an “alternatively activated” phenotype could also negatively contribute to gut homeostasis during the resolution of inflammatory processes, for instance, by enhancing fibrosis ( Xue et al., 2015 65. Xue, J. ∙ Sharma, V. ∙ Hsieh, M.H. ... Alternatively activated macrophages promote pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7158 Crossref Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, because we previously demonstrated that macrophages located in the mucosal layer do not show an immediate upregulation of tissue-protective genes upon enteric infection, an anatomically segregated model in which lamina propria macrophages help pathogen resistance and MMs boost tolerance is conceivable.
The nervous and immune systems are the body’s main sensory interfaces, and both depend on cell-to-cell contacts and on soluble molecules that act on proximal or distant target cells, which include neurons and immune cells themselves ( Besedovsky et al., 1983 5. Besedovsky, H. ∙ del Rey, A. ∙ Sorkin, E. ... The immune response evokes changes in brain noradrenergic neurons Science. 1983; 221 :564-566 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). The involvement of catecholaminergic neurons in anti-inflammatory responses has been demonstrated in different tissues and is attributed to the broad sympathetic innervation in peripheral lymph nodes associated with expression of β 2 -AR in immune cells ( Pavlov et al., 2018 50. Pavlov, V.A. ∙ Chavan, S.S. ∙ Tracey, K.J. Molecular and Functional Neuroscience in Immunity Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :783-812 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings also suggest an intricate interplay between iEANs, macrophages, and eEANs (extrinsic enteric-associated neurons), particularly the extrinsic sympathetic ganglia, adding functional significance to observations of interactions between barrier tissue-resident macrophages and peripheral neurons ( Gabanyi et al., 2016; Muller et al., 2014 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Muller, P.A. ∙ Koscsó, B. ∙ Rajani, G.M. ... Crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons regulates gastrointestinal motility Cell. 2014; 158 :300-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). The source of catecholamines may be context dependent: enteric infections may result in the activation of extrinsic sympathetic neurons ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ); under conditions of systemic stress, these signals could originate from the adrenal glands, although our adrenalectomy experiments argue against this possibility. The effects of stress are typically thought to be immunosuppressive; however, in the context of cellular damage and death, glucocorticoids can promote pro-inflammatory immune responses, particularly in the CNS ( Di Giovangiulio et al., 2015; Salgo et al., 2006 16. Di Giovangiulio, M. ∙ Verheijden, S. ∙ Bosmans, G. ... The Neuromodulation of the Intestinal Immune System and Its Relevance in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Front. Immunol. 2015; 6 :590 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 53. Salgo, B. ∙ Schmitz, A. ∙ Henze, G. ... Evaluation of a new recommendation for improved cuffed tracheal tube size selection in infants and small children Acta Anaesthesiol. Scand. 2006; 50 :557-561 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that acute stress in mice provided significant protection to iEANs during enteric infection, results that more broadly link physiological stress to control of inflammation. In light of these findings, stress should be considered as a confounding factor to control for in the context of inflammation. Nevertheless, both of these pathways require neural input, yet the circuitry connecting luminal sensing to eEAN activation (and a possible involvement of the CNS), and how luminal stimulations can regulate it, remain to be determined ( Muller et al., 2019; Prüss et al., 2017 46. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Kerner, Z. ... Microbes modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar 51. Prüss, H. ∙ Tedeschi, A. ∙ Thiriot, A. ... Spinal cord injury-induced immunodeficiency is mediated by a sympathetic-neuroendocrine adrenal reflex Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :1549-1559 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Current literature suggests that sensing of luminal pathogens, or associated changes in the microenvironment, could be mediated by enteroendocrine cells ( Kaelberer et al., 2018 33. Kaelberer, M.M. ∙ Buchanan, K.L. ∙ Klein, M.E. ... A gut-brain neural circuit for nutrient sensory transduction Science. 2018; 361 :eaat5236 Crossref Scopus (515) PubMed Google Scholar ) or epithelial and mucosal-associated sensory afferents ( Chiu et al., 2013 11. Chiu, I.M. ∙ Heesters, B.A. ∙ Ghasemlou, N. ... Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation Nature. 2013; 501 :52-57 Crossref Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar ), both with the capacity to impact iEAN survival or initiate changes in eEAN activity. However, the components of luminal sensing still require further dissection to uncover relevant cell populations and receptors ( Veiga-Fernandes and Mucida, 2016 62. Veiga-Fernandes, H. ∙ Mucida, D. Neuro-Immune Interactions at Barrier Surfaces Cell. 2016; 165 :801-811 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Downstream of the initial components, our data identify a novel mechanism of neuronal cell death and point to a role for tissue-resident MMs in limiting neuronal damage. Such intra-tissue adaptation of immune cells appears to help the maintenance of a proper balance between resistance and tolerance, and these findings could have implications in additional tissues and contexts.

Rosenstiel (targeting of Exon 1 of Nlrp6 , frozen sperm generously provided by T. Kanneganti), and Casp11 flox/flox by KOMP and A. Wullaert. Mouse lines were interbred in our facilities to obtain the final strains described in the text. Genotyping was performed according to the protocols established for the respective strains by The Jackson Laboratories or personal communication with the donating investigators. Mice were maintained at the Rockefeller University animal facilities under specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were fed a standard chow diet and used at 7–12 weeks of age for most experiments. Animal care and experimentation were consistent with NIH guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Rockefeller University.
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (SL1344) and its mutant spiB were used for infection experiments and cultured prior to infection as described below. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (IP32777) was cultured prior to infection as described below. S. venezuelensis was maintained in our facility by periodically infecting NSG mice and culturing larvae as described below. Toxoplasma gondii was maintained in our lab by periodically infecting C57BL/6 mice with 5 cysts administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.). Cysts were isolated from brain tissue 30 days after infection. Trypanosoma cruzi . The T. cruzi Y strain was maintained by serial passage from mouse to mouse.
For infections with Salmonella spiB , mice were pre-treated with a single dose of Streptomycin (20 mg/mouse dissolved in 100 μl of DPBS) administered by oral gavage 18-24 h prior to infection Mice were then orally inoculated with 10 9 CFU of spiB . For Salmonella re-infection experiments, mice were subjected to spiB infection as described above. 1 week post-clearance of spiB from the feces, mice were fasted for 4 h and infected with 10 6 CFU of wild-type Salmonella enterica Typhimurium (SL1344). For all Salmonella infections, a single aliquot of either strain of Salmonella was grown in 3 mL of LB overnight at 37°C with agitation. Bacteria were then sub-cultured (1:300) into 3 mL of LB for 3.5 h at 37°C with agitation, and diluted to final concentration in 1 mL of DPBS. Bacteria were inoculated by gavage into recipient mice in a total volume of 100 μl. For experiments using heat-killed spiB , samples subjected to heat treatment (95°C for 10 min in water bath), prior to gavage and successful inactivation was confirmed by plating a serial dilution made from the suspension and then 5 μL onto Salmonella-Shigella plates.
Y. pseudotuberculosis (strain IP32777) was grown as previously described with some adjustments ( Fonseca et al., 2015 22. Fonseca, D.M. ∙ Hand, T.W. ∙ Han, S.J. ... Microbiota-Dependent Sequelae of Acute Infection Compromise Tissue-Specific Immunity Cell. 2015; 163 :354-366 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly a single aliquot of the strain was grown in 3 mL of 2xYT media overnight at 28°C with vigorous agitation. Mice were fasted for 12 h prior to infection with 10 8 CFU by oral gavage.
For heterologous re-infection experiments, mice infected with spiB or Y. pseudotuberculosis as described above were subjected to either 10 8 of Y. pseudotuberculosis or 10 9 CFU of Salmonella spiB on day 21 days post-infection with spiB or Y. pseudotuberculosis infection, and sacrificed 10 days post-secondary infection.
S. venezuelensis was maintained in our facility in NSG mice by subcutaneous infection with 700 larvae, resulting in chronic infection of this strain. For each experiment, feces of infected NSG mice were collected and spread on Whatman paper, which was placed into a beaker with water and incubated at 28°C. The hatching larvae were collected over 2-3 days. Mice were infected subcutaneously with 700 larvae/100 μl water per mouse. S. venezuelensis was passaged by periodically infecting naive adult NSG mice.
T. gondii was maintained in the lab by periodically infecting mice administered by intraperitoneal injection of 5 cysts/mouse in a total volume of 100 μl of DPBS.
For each experiment, blood from an infected mouse was collected, parasites were quantified and naive recipient mice infected by intraperitoneal injection of 10 4 parasites. Infected mice were sacrificed for tissue analysis at day 22 post-infection, when the parasite load reaches a plateau ( Arantes et al., 2004 2. Arantes, R.M. ∙ Marche, H.H. ∙ Bahia, M.T. ... Interferon-gamma-induced nitric oxide causes intrinsic intestinal denervation in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mice Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164 :1361-1368 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The following primary antibodies were used, and unless otherwise indicated concentrations apply to all staining techniques: Somatostatin (1:200, Millipore Sigma, MAB354), ANNA-1 (1:200,000, Gift of Dr. Vanda A. Lennon), HA (1:400, Cell Signaling Technologies, 3724S), nNOS (1:200, ABCAM, ab76067), MHC II (1:400, Millipore Sigma, MABF33), S100 beta (1:200, Abcam, ab52642), ASC (1:200, Adipogen, AL177), GFP (1:400, Nacalai, GF090R). Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were either H&L or Fab (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a consistent concentration of 1:400 in the following species and colors: Goat anti-rabbit (AF488/568/647), goat anti-rat (AF488/647), goat anti-chicken (AF488/568/647), goat anti-human (AF568/647),
Fluorescent-dye-conjugated antibodies were purchased from BD-PharMingen (USA) (anti-CD45.2, 104; anti-CD45R, RA3-6B2); eBioscience (USA) (anti-CD103, 2E7; anti-MHC II, M5; anti-F4/80, BM8; anti-CD11b, M1/70; anti-CD11c, N418; anti-Siglec F, E50-2440; anti-CD3e,145-2C11; anti-Ly6G, RB6-8C5) or BioLegend (USA) (anti-CD64 X54-5/7.1). Live/Dead staining was performed using Aqua fixable dead cell stain (Invitrogen). Macrophages were sorted as Aqua–CD45+Lin–(CD3–B220–Siglec F–LY6G–) MHCII+F4/80+CD11B+CD11C+CD103–) using a FACS Aria cell sorter flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Mice were sacrificed and duodenum (1 cm moving distal from the gastroduodenal junction), ileum (1 cm moving proximal from the ileocecal junction), or colon (4 cm moving proximal from the rectum) was removed. For dissection of the muscularis , following the above procedures, the intestinal tissue was placed on a chilled aluminum block with the serosa facing up ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 24. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). Curved forceps were then used to carefully remove the muscularis .
Mice were sacrificed and the ventral neck surface was cut open. Associated muscle was removed by blunt dissection to expose the trachea and the nodose ganglion was then located by following the vagus nerve along the carotid artery to the base of the skull. Fine scissors were used to cut the vagus nerve below the nodose ganglion and superior to the jugular ganglion.
For measurement of total intestinal transit time, mice were given an oral gavage of 6% carmine red (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose (prepared in with sterile 0.9% NaCl). Total intestinal transit time was measured as the time from oral gavage it took for mice to pass a fecal pellet that contained carmine. Experiments were ended after 450 min.
Ileal ring tension was assessed by organ bath (Radnoti) myography as previously described ( Muller et al., 2014 45. Muller, P.A. ∙ Koscsó, B. ∙ Rajani, G.M. ... Crosstalk between muscularis macrophages and enteric neurons regulates gastrointestinal motility Cell. 2014; 158 :300-313 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (466) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, distal ileal rings were mounted and equilibrated for one h and were distended to 0.5 g followed by 10 min of relaxation. The data was acquired using the PowerLab acquisition system and analyzed using LabChart Software (AD Instruments).
Lipocalin-2 levels in fecal samples were quantified using a Mouse Lipocalin-2 ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Salbutamol sulfate (Selleck Chemicals) was dissolved in sterile NaCl to a concentration of 56 mg/mL, loaded into osmotic pumps and administered by subcutaneous osmotic pumps implanted as described below at a final dose of 400 μg/day for 14 days.
zVAD-FMK (Selleck Chemicals) was dissolved in DMSO and administered at a dose of 50 μg/mouse by daily intraperitoneal injections over the course of a 7-day infection starting 1 day prior to infection.
Spermine (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered at a concentration of 2% in drinking water. Spermine-substituted drinking water was changed daily and fluid intake was monitored. Treatment was started 3 days prior to infection with Salmonella spiB and continued over the course of experiments.
Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, gift from P. Woster, MSSM) was dissolved in tap water, filter-sterilized, and administered at a concentration of 4% in drinking water. DFMO-substituted water was changed daily, and fluid intake was monitored. Treatment was started 4 days prior to infection with Salmonella spiB and continued over the course of experiments.
A plexiglass induction chamber was placed on a heating pad set to 37°C. Isoflurane was set at 1% with an oxygen flow of 1 L/minute. Mice were placed in the induction chamber and monitored for loss of movement, after which a period of 15 min was elapsed. Respiration was monitored continuously during this period. Following isoflurane treatment, mice were returned to their home cage for a period of 1 h prior to receiving Streptomycin pre-treatment, followed by spiB infection as described above.
Sham intraperitoneal injections of DPBS or IgG (isotype control from MM depletion experiments, see below) were performed by mimicking the anti-CSF1R MM depletion protocol, by intraperitoneal injection of 200 μl of DPBS or IgG/ mouse (100 μl/flank). Injections were performed 12 h prior to spiB infection, and an additional injection was performed at day 3.5 post-infection. Mice were sacrificed and tissue was analyzed at 7 days post-infection.
Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and, under sterile conditions, a small incision was made on the dorsal side of the neck. An Alzet pump (Model 1002) filled with Salbutamol sulfate prepared as described above was placed under the skin and moved back toward the right flank. The incision was then closed with surgical wound clips (Kent Scientific). Mice were then left to rest for 7 days before infection with spiB .
Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and, under sterile conditions, bilateral incisions were made dorsally just below the rib cage. The adrenal glands were then grasped by forceps from the suprarenal blood vessels and extracted from the surrounding tissue. Care was taken to minimize any bleeding before the muscle incision was closed with absorbable sutures. Surgical wound clips were then used to close the skin. Mice were then kept on 0.9% saline drinking water for 9 days prior to infection with spiB .
The Nlrp6 flox/flox strain was generated by Flp-Neo-mediated insertion of loxP sites flanking exon 1 of the Nlrp6 locus. ES cells were used to generate the conditional knockout allele. The strain was generated in collaboration with genoWay (Lyon, France).
16S samples were processed utilizing a Promega Maxwell® RSC 48 Instrument. Following RNA extraction from all samples, samples were quantified using a ThermoFisher Quant-It dsDNA High-Sensitivity Kit on a microplate reader.
16S sequencing was performed on either the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or the Illumina MiSeq depending on project-specific needs. Raw paired-end fastq files containing sequence reads were merged at the overlapping region to produce a single 16S contig. All merged sequences having more than 1 expected error per read were filtered. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were generated by clustering sequences with a 99% correspondence and chimera sequences were removed using usearch ( Edgar, 2010 19. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (15567) PubMed Google Scholar ) (v11).
Mice expressing hM4Di in relevant neuronal populations were injected with 10mg/kg Compound 21 (HelloBio) 24 h prior to oral gavage with spiB .
7 days post-oral gavage with spiB mice were given drinking water supplemented with 10 g/L Splenda (artificial sweetener, control), or broad-spectrum antibiotics (1g/L ampicillin, 0.5g/L vancomycin, 1g/L neomycin, 0.5g/L metronidazole) in the drinking water supplemented with 10 g/L Splenda for 2 weeks. Mice on antibiotics were then put onto Splenda-containing water and all mice were given feces from an uninfected cage of age-matched C57BL/6J mice. All tissues were then harvested 2 weeks after recolonization.
Anti-CSF1R was produced by suspension culture of the ASF98 hybridoma cell line (gift from Miriam Merad). Cells were thawed and passaged twice (1:10) in PFHM-II (Thermo Fisher) media supplemented with P/S (Thermo Fisher). Cells were then seeded at 5x10 6 in 15 mL of PFHM-II in the cellular compartment of a 1000 mL bioreactor (Wheaton) and allowed to grow for 7-10 days. The cell compartment was then harvested, spun down and the supernatant collected. Supernatant was filtered and antibody was purified from the supernatant by affinity purification using protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare) in a gravity column (Bio-Rad). Briefly, the protein G was equilibrated with 100 mL binding buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and supernatant was loaded onto and run through the column. The column was then washed with 200 mL of binding buffer and eluted with 10 mL elution buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Antibody was eluted in fractions directly into 100 μl 1 M Tris-HCL pH 8 (Invitrogen) and the concentrations were measured on a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fractions were combined and dialyzed in 2 L DPBS for 2 days at 4°C using 14,000 MWCO dialysis tubing (Spectrum Labs) changing once. The antibody was then concentrated using centrifugal filters (30,000 MW, Amicon) and stored at 4°C until use.
Anti-CSF1R was diluted in sterile DPBS to a final concentration of 6.25 mg/mL and 50 mg/kg of anti-CSF1R or isotype control (IgG from rat serum, Sigma-Aldrich) were administered by i.p. injections. Mice were previously habituated to i.p. injections for at least 5 days prior to the start of depletion and spiB infection. For all experiments, depletion was performed twice over the course of 7 days (day 0 and day 3.5). For infection experiments, depletion was performed 12 h prior to infection. Animals were then subjected to the Salmonella spiB infection protocol as described above, and received and additional dose of either anti-CSF1R or isotype control 3.5 days after the initial dose. Animals were sacrificed at 7 dpi and intestinal tissue dissected for analysis.
Cuprolinic blue staining for visualization of enteric neurons was performed as previously described ( Holst and Powley, 1995 30. Holst, M.C. ∙ Powley, T.L. Cuprolinic blue (quinolinic phthalocyanine) counterstaining of enteric neurons for peroxidase immunocytochemistry J. Neurosci. Methods. 1995; 62 :121-127 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The method was utilized for quantification of enteric neurons in T. gondii and T. cruzi infection experiments ( Figure S1 ).
Briefly, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the small intestine was removed and placed in HBSS Mg 2+ Ca 2+ (GIBCO) + 5% FCS. The intestine was cut open longitudinally and the luminal contents washed away in DPBS. The muscularis was then carefully dissected away from the underlying mucosa in one intact sheet. The tissue was pinned down in a plate coated with Sylgard and then fixed for O/N with 4% PFA with gentle agitation. After washing in DPBS whole mount samples were then permeabilized first in 0.5% Triton X-100/0.05% Tween-20/4 μg heparin (PTxwH) for 2 h at room temperature (RT) with gentle shaking. Samples were then blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer (PTxwH with 5% bovine serum albumin/5% donkey/goat serum) for 2 h at RT with gentle agitation. Antibodies were added to the blocking buffer at appropriate concentrations and incubated for 2 days at 4°C. After primary incubation the tissue was washed 4 times in PTxwH and then incubated in blocking buffer with secondary antibody at concentrations within the primary antibody range for 2 h at RT. Samples were again washed washed 4 times in PTxwH and then mounted with FluoroMount G on slides with 1 ½ coverslips. Slides were kept in the dark at 4°C until they were imaged.
Whole-mount intestine samples were imaged on an inverted LSM 880 NLO laser scanning confocal and multiphoton microscope (Zeiss) and on an inverted TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica).
Heterozygous or homozygous Snap25 RiboTag were used for TRAP-seq analysis as no differences were found between either genotype. For intestine immunoprecipitation (IP) mice were sacrificed and tissue remove and divided as above. Samples were washed of fecal contents in PBS with cycloheximide (0.2 mg/mL) (PBS/CHX). Mesenteric fat was removed and the muscularis was separated from the mucosa as described above and samples were washed 5 times in PBS/CHX. For nodose ganglion IP, tissues were isolated as described above. For Snap25 ΔNlrp6 :RiboTag animals, ileum muscularis was isolated as above and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to immunoprecipitation. The RiboTag immunoprecipitation protocol ( http://depts.washington.edu/mcklab/RiboTagIPprotocol2014.pdf ) was then followed with the following modifications: All samples were homogenized by hand with a dounce homogenizer in 2.5 mL supplemented homogenization buffer (changes per 2.5 mL: 50 μl Protease Inhibitor, 75 μl heparin (100 mg/mL stock), 25 μl SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor). Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 G, after which 800 μl of supernatant was removed and 5 μL of anti-HA antibody (Abcam, ab9110) was added. For input samples, 40 μl of this supernatant was added to 60uL of PicoPure lysis buffer and stored at −80°C. Samples were kept rotating at 4°C with antibody for 1 h. 200 μl of Thermo Protein magnetic A/G beads were washed with homogenization buffer, added to the sample, and kept rotating for 30 min at 4°C. The beads were washed four times with high-salt buffer and samples were eluted with 100 μl of PicoPure lysis buffer. RNA was extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA libraries were prepared using SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA (ClonTech Labs) and sequenced using 75 base-pair single end reads on a NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina). Reads were aligned using Kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 7. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (4977) PubMed Google Scholar ) to Mouse Ensembl v91. Transcript abundance files were then used in the DESeq2 R package, which was used for all downstream differential expression analysis and generation of volcano plots. Differentially expressed genes between samples were compared with a cutoff of log 2 Fold Change > 1.
The published single-cell analysis of the mouse nervous system at mousebrain.org/genesearch.html (PMID: 30096314) was searched for Nrlp6 and filtered for clusters that express the gene at a trinarization score > = 0.95. Relative expression was then plotted as a heatmap in Prism 8. Vglut2 + subsets were defined based on the same single-cell analysis.
Mice were given a lethal dose of isoflurane and then perfused with 30 mL ice cold DPBS. The ileum and colon were removed and flushed of luminal contents. The tissue was then transferred to OCT, positioned, flash frozen, moved to −20 for 2 h, and finally moved to −80 for long term storage. Prior to cryosectioning, OCT blocks were equilibrated in the cryostat for 20 min. Sections were cut at 15 μm, put onto SuperfrostPlus slides, and left to dry for 10-15 min. Slides were then transferred to dry ice and finally to −80°C before RNAscope® processing.
RNAscope® in situ hybridization was performed using probes against Nlrp6 and Elavl4 on 15 μm sections of fresh frozen ileum or colon tissue isolated from C57BL/6J mice according to the manufacturer’s instruction with the following modification, tissue was pretreated with Protease IV for 20 min at RT. Samples were then mounted in Fluoromount-G with DAPI and 1 ½ coverslips were applied.
A minimum of 10 images were randomly acquired across a piece of whole-mount muscularis . These images were then opened in ImageJ, and the cell counter was used to count the number of ANNA-1+ cells in a given field. This number was then multiplied by a factor of 2.95 (20x objective) or 3.125 (25x objective), to calculate the number of counted neurons per square millimeter (mm 2 ). The average of 10 (or more) images was then calculated and plotted. Thus, every point on a given graph corresponds to a single animal. For determining iEAN subtype changes, the number of nNOS+, SST+, and tdTomato+ neurons were also counted. These numbers were then reported as both number per mm 2 and percent of ANNA-1+ neurons.
Raw data as imported from the microscope was used for all cell identification and subsequent analyses. Some post –analysis pseudo-color adjustment was performed for individual images to account for differences in auto-fluorescence and labeling. Imaris (Bitplane AG) software was used for cell identification, using the “ Surfaces ” algorithm as described by the manufacturer. A surface was created based on anti-ANNA-1 (neuron) staining to define neuronal ganglia. A masked channel was then created to capture fluorescence in other channels within the neuronal ganglia volume. A second surface was created based on anti-MHCII (macrophage) staining only within the masked channel. Volume statistics on both neuron (total) and macrophage (neuronal ganglia masked) surfaces were then exported. Percent macrophage intercalation per image was calculated as: 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 = ( ∑ ( 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ) + ∑ ( 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ) ∑ ( 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 ) × 1 0 0
The average of at least 10 random macrophage intercalation percentages was used to determine the percentage for each individual animal.
Images were adjusted post hoc using Imaris x64 software (version 9.1 Bitplane) and 3D reconstructions were recorded as mp4 video files. Optical slices were taken using the orthoslicer or oblique slicer tools.
Fecal pellets from Salmonella spiB- infected mice were weighed and then disrupted in 400 μL of DPBS. Serial dilutions were made from the original suspension and then 5 μL of each dilution was plated onto Salmonella-Shigella plates. The plates were then incubated overnight and the number of black colonies were counted for the serial dilution with the clearest delineation of single units. This number was then multiplied by the dilution factor and by 80 to give the number of colony forming units (CFU) in the original suspension. CFU numbers were then divided by the original fecal pellet weight to give the number of CFU per mg of feces.
DNA was extracted from ear pieces of mice using QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Lucigen). Target sequences were amplified using the following primers: Forward 5′-AGGCATATCTATAATCCCTTCACTG-3′; Reverse 5′-GAATATATCAAAGAGATGACAAGAGC- 3′. The following PCR conditions were used: 4 min 94°C, 1 min 94°C, 0.5 min 58°C, 1 min 72°C, 7 min 72°C, and end at 12°C. Samples were loaded on 3% agarose gels, and bands from all strains were compared to samples from C57BL/6J and 129S mice. The 5 bp deletion in Casp11 described in the 129S1 strain fragment runs slightly higher than the wild-type fragment at a height of approximately 220 bp ( Vanden Berghe et al., 2015 61. Vanden Berghe, T. ∙ Hulpiau, P. ∙ Martens, L. ... Passenger Mutations Confound Interpretation of All Genetically Modified Congenic Mice Immunity. 2015; 43 :200-209 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Casp11 mutation status was further confirmed in C57BL/6J, CBA/J and 129S1 mice by Sanger sequencing of a gel-purified PCR product using primers 5′-CAGTATTATTATTGGTGATGCAAATG-3′ and 5′-GGAATATATCAAAGAGATGACAAGAGC-3′. Casp11 mutation status was also confirmed in further relevant mouse strains utilized in this study.
Mice were euthanized, and the small intestine was carefully removed, cleaned, cut open longitudinally and washed 2X in HBSS Mg 2+ Ca 2 GIBCO) and 1X in HBSS Mg 2+ Ca 2 with 1 mM DTT (Sigma- Aldrich). The tissue was cut in two and the muscularis region was carefully dissected from the underlying mucosa. Muscularis tissue was then finely cut and digested in HBSS Mg 2+ Ca 2+ + 5% FBS + 1x NaPyr + 25mM HEPES + 50 μg/mL DNase I (Roche) + 400 U/mL Collagenase D (Roche) + 2.5U/mL Dispase (Corning) at 37°C. The muscularis was digested for 40 min. The tissue was then homogenized with an 18-gauge needle, filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and washed with HBSS Mg 2+ Ca 2 . Cells were incubated with Fc block and antibodies against the indicated cell surface markers in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 10 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN 3 ).
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen), from which cDNA libraries were reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and random primers following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using SYBR green (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Data were collected and analyzed on a QuantStudio 3 (Thermo Scientific). The Rpl32 housekeeping gene was used to normalize samples. For TRAP-qPCR, RiboTag purified mRNA was reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) and qPCR was performed using SYBR green (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The following primers were used: Rpl32 forward 5′-ACAATGTCAAGGAGCTGGAG-3′, Rpl32 reverse 5′- TTGGGATTGGTGACTCTGATG-3′, Arg1 forward 5′-CTCCAAGCCAAAGTCCTTAGAG- 3′, Arg1 reverse 5′-AGGAGCTGTCATTAGGGACATC-3′, Ym1 forward 5′-AGACTTGCGTGACTATGAAGCATT-3′, Ym1 reverse 5′-GCAGGTCCAAACTTCCATCCTC- 3′, Nlrp6 exon 4 forward 5′-CAGACGCTGTGGACCTTGT-3′, Nlrp6 exon 4 reverse 5′- ACGTGCTCGCGGTACTTCTT- 3′, Nlrp6 exon 1 forward 5′-TTGACTGTCAGCAAGAGTCC-3′, Nlrp6 exon 1 reverse 5′-GGTGATCCTTTCTGGGCTAAA-3′, Elavl4 forward 5′-GATCAGGGATGCTAACCTGTATG-3′, Elavl4 reverse 5′-GGTGATGATGCGACCGTATT-3′. To calculate a fold change, the final qPCR cycle of 45 was chosen in cases in which there was no amplification. This was comparable to water, which was used as a control and did not amplify.
Casp11 flox/flox mice were retro-orbitally injected with ~5 × 10 11 GC of AAV9-hSyn-HI-eGFP-Cre-WPRE-SV40 (105540-AAV9) or AAV9-hSyn-eGFP-WPRE-bGH (Addgene #105539-AAV9) diluted in 100 μl of sterile DPBS. Mice were then infected at least 2 weeks post-viral injection.
Plp1 CreERT ;Rosa26 DTA ( Plp1 iDTA , Cre+) and Rosa26 DTA mice (Cre-) received a single oral gavage of 8 mg tamoxifen (Sigma) solubilized in 250 μL sterile corn oil (Sigma) at 6-7 weeks of age. Mice were infected with Salmonella spiB 5 days post-tamoxifen administration and sacrificed at day 6 post-infection (day 11 post-tamoxifen).
Significance levels indicated are as follows: ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. All data are presented as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM. At least two independent experiments were performed throughout in this study. All statistical tests used were two-tailed.
