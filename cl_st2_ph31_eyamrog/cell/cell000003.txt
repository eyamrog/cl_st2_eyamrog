Title: Serum Amyloid A Proteins Induce Pathogenic Th17 Cells and Promote Inflammatory Disease

Abstract: Summary

Lymphoid cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines protect barrier tissues from pathogenic microbes but are also prominent effectors of inflammation and autoimmune disease. T helper 17 (Th17) cells, defined by RORγt-dependent production of IL-17A and IL-17F, exert homeostatic functions in the gut upon microbiota-directed differentiation from naive CD4 + T cells. In the non-pathogenic setting, their cytokine production is regulated by serum amyloid A proteins (SAA1 and SAA2) secreted by adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. However, Th17 cell behaviors vary markedly according to their environment. Here, we show that SAAs additionally direct a pathogenic pro-inflammatory Th17 cell differentiation program, acting directly on T cells in collaboration with STAT3-activating cytokines. Using loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, we show that SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3 have distinct systemic and local functions in promoting Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases. These studies suggest that T cell signaling pathways modulated by the SAAs may be attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapies.

Section: Introduction

T helper 17 (Th17) cells and related interleukin (IL)-17-producing T cells perform critical roles at mucosal surfaces, mediating protection from pathogenic bacteria and fungi and contributing to regulation of the mutualistic organisms that comprise the microbiota ( Honda and Littman, 2016 16. Honda, K. ∙ Littman, D.R. The microbiota in adaptive immune homeostasis and disease Nature. 2016; 535 :75-84 Crossref Scopus (1255) PubMed Google Scholar ). Th17 cells also drive the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory diseases ( McGeachy et al., 2019; Patel and Kuchroo, 2015; Stockinger and Omenetti, 2017 35. McGeachy, M.J. ∙ Cua, D.J. ∙ Gaffen, S.L.

Yet, despite extensive studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo , the differentiation cues that distinguish Th17 cells that execute homeostatic functions, such as maintenance of barrier epithelial integrity, from those with potentially harmful inflammatory functions as observed in autoimmune diseases, remain an enigma. Differentiation of the latter, which have a distinct transcriptional program with features resembling those of Th1 cells, requires IL-23 and IL-1β ( Chung et al., 2009; Hirota et al., 2011; Komuczki et al., 2019; McGeachy et al., 2009 6.

Mice deficient for either of those cytokines retain the capacity to generate Th17 cells in response to commensal microbiota ( Ivanov et al., 2008 20. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Frutos, Rde.L. ∙ Manel, N. ...

IL-23 drives a pathogenic T cell population that induces autoimmune inflammation J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201 :233-240 Crossref Scopus (3401) PubMed Google Scholar ). In vitro differentiation of “homeostatic” Th17 cells can be achieved by stimulation of antigen-activated T cells with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and either IL-6 or IL-21 that induce STAT3 phosphorylation, which is prerequisite for expression of the Th17-defining transcription factor, RAR-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt) ( Ivanov et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007 19.

Immunol. 2007; 8 :967-974 Crossref Scopus (1789) PubMed Google Scholar ). When myelin-reactive T cells were generated in vitro with TGF-β and IL-6, they failed to provoke autoimmune disease following transfer into mice ( Lee et al., 2012 25. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, additional in vitro exposure to IL-23 rendered these cells pathogenic, as did their differentiation in the absence of TGF-β, with a combination of IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23 ( Ghoreschi et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012 13.

The SAAs are a family of acute phase response proteins that were recently associated with gut microbial ecology and inflammation and are encoded by at least four closely linked genes that likely arose from gene duplication events ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017; Uhlar et al., 1994 29. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Arze, C. ∙ Ananthakrishnan, A.N. ..., IBDMDB Investigators Multi-omics of the gut microbial ecosystem in inflammatory bowel diseases Nature. 2019; 569 :655-662 Crossref Scopus (1557) PubMed Google Scholar 47.

Evolution of the serum amyloid A (SAA) protein superfamily Genomics. 1994; 19 :228-235 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3 are elicited by inflammatory cues, while SAA4 is constitutively produced and regulated independently of the inflammatory state ( De Buck et al., 2016; Yarur et al., 2017; Ye and Sun, 2015 8.

Ye, R.D. ∙ Sun, L. Emerging functions of serum amyloid A in inflammation J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 98 :923-929 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Previously, we demonstrated that colonization of mice with an epithelial cell-associated commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), triggered local secretion of SAA1 and SAA2 by the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) ( Ivanov et al., 2009 21. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SAAs directly potentiated local Th17 cell effector cell function ( Sano et al., 2015 44. Sano, T. ∙ Huang, W. ∙ Hall, J.A. ... An IL-23R/IL-22 Circuit Regulates Epithelial Serum Amyloid A to Promote Local Effector Th17 Responses Cell. 2015; 163 :381-393 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, SAA1/2 remained confined to the ileum and did not enter into the circulation ( Sano et al., 2015 44. Sano, T. ∙ Huang, W. ∙ Hall, J.A. ... An IL-23R/IL-22 Circuit Regulates Epithelial Serum Amyloid A to Promote Local Effector Th17 Responses Cell. 2015; 163 :381-393 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, SAA1 and SAA2 are most prominently induced in liver during sepsis and/or inflammation, with concentrations in serum increased by as much as a 1,000-fold over basal levels ( De Buck et al., 2016; Yarur et al., 2017; Ye and Sun, 2015 8. De Buck, M. ∙ Gouwy, M. ∙ Wang, J.M. ... Structure and Expression of Different Serum Amyloid A (SAA) Variants and their Concentration-Dependent Functions During Host Insults Curr. Med.

Serum Amyloid A as a Surrogate Marker for Mucosal and Histologic Inflammation in Patients with Crohn’s Disease Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2017; 23 :158-164 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Ye, R.D. ∙ Sun, L. Emerging functions of serum amyloid A in inflammation J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 98 :923-929 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serum concentrations of SAA1 and SAA2 are also consistently elevated in various Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and multiple sclerosis, in addition to numerous cancers ( Ye and Sun, 2015 56. Ye, R.D. ∙ Sun, L. Emerging functions of serum amyloid A in inflammation J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 98 :923-929 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Systemic SAA levels have long served as biomarkers, but whether they contribute to these diseases is not known. The secreted proteins form hexamers that associate in serum with high density lipoprotein and are thought to be involved in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis ( Wang and Colón, 2004; Wang et al., 2002 51. Wang, L. ∙ Colón, W. The interaction between apolipoprotein serum amyloid A and high-density lipoprotein Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317 :157-161 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Wang, L. ∙ Lashuel, H.A. ∙ Walz, T. ... Murine apolipoprotein serum amyloid A in solution forms a hexamer containing a central channel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :15947-15952 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is also evidence that SAAs, particularly SAA3, oligomerize and associate with derivatives of vitamin A ( Derebe et al., 2014 9. Derebe, M.G. ∙ Zlatkov, C.M. ∙ Gattu, S. ... Serum amyloid A is a retinol binding protein that transports retinol during bacterial infection eLife. 2014; 3 :e03206 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). The anatomical distribution and cellular targets of SAAs in chronic disease are largely undefined, but the SAAs were recently implicated in conditioning the liver microenvironment to provide a niche for tumor metastases ( Lee et al., 2019 27. Lee, J.W. ∙ Stone, M.L. ∙ Porrett, P.M. ... Hepatocytes direct the formation of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver Nature. 2019; 567 :249-252 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we investigate the role of SAAs in the differentiation and function of potentially pathogenic Th17 cells. We find that the SAAs can substitute for TGF-β in the induction of Th17 cells but engage a distinct signaling pathway that results in a pro-inflammatory program of differentiation. As a consequence, SAAs contribute in vivo to Th17-mediated pathogenesis, revealed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with both loss- and gain-of-function models. Collectively, our findings show that the SAAs contribute selectively to Th17 cell functions in vivo and suggest strategies for therapeutic modulation in Th17-mediated inflammatory disease.

Section: Results

In vitro activation of naive murine CD4 + T cells in the presence of IL-6 alone is insufficient to promote Th17 cell differentiation ( Bettelli et al., 2006; Mangan et al., 2006; Veldhoen et al., 2006 4.

TGFbeta in the context of an inflammatory cytokine milieu supports de novo differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells Immunity. 2006; 24 :179-189 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3142) PubMed Google Scholar ). The addition of either TGF-β or IL-1β plus IL-23 is required for the T cells to upregulate RORγt and produce Th17 cytokines. Unexpectedly, we observed that a combination of SAA1 and IL-6, in the presence of TGF-β neutralizing antibody (referred to as Th17-SAA1 condition), elicited potent Th17 cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, with expression of the signature cytokines, IL-17A and IL-17F ( Figures 1 A–1C and S1 A). Similar results were obtained using T cells expressing the dominant negative form of TGFβRII (TGFβRII DNtg), while addition of SAA1 neutralizing antibodies prevented Th17 cell induction under Th17-SAA1 conditions ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Expression of RORγt was similar between Th17-SAA1 cells and Th17 cells induced by the standard polarization cocktail consisting of IL-6 + TGF-β (Th17-TGFβ) ( Figure 1 D). Notably, naive murine CD8 + T cells responded similarly to CD4 + cells under the different polarization conditions ( Figures S1 D and S1E). To determine whether SAA-directed signaling converged with the TGF-β signaling pathway, we assessed levels of phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3). As expected, TGF-β rapidly induced pSMAD2/3. However, this was not observed with SAA1, which instead was found to rapidly engage the MAPK pathway, inducing p38 phosphorylation ( Figures 1 E and S1 F). These findings demonstrate that SAA1 promotes Th17 cell differentiation through a TGF-β-independent mechanism.
To compare in vitro Th17 cell programming by SAA1 and TGF-β, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of cells differentiated under Th17-SAA1 or Th17-TGFβ conditions for 3 h, 12 h, and 48 h ( Figure S2 A). After 48 h, there were 3,537 differentially expressed (DE) genes between Th17-SAA1 and Th17-TGFβ cells ( Figure 2 A). Compared to Th cells cultured in IL-6 alone or the Th17-TGFβ condition, Th17-SAA1 cells exhibited a profound induction of hallmark chronic inflammatory disease-associated genes, such as Il23r ( Abdollahi et al., 2016; Duerr et al., 2006; Gaffen et al., 2014; Hue et al., 2006 1.

Metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein is associated with the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatology (Oxford). 2009; 48 :1590-1594 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Gene set enrichment analysis using previously defined Th17 datasets revealed a striking correlation with the “pathogenic” Th17 signature, but an anti-correlation with the “non-pathogenic” Th17 signature, as early as 3 h after SAA treatment ( Lee et al., 2012 25. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 B). Examples of increased pathogenic-Th17 signature genes in differentiating Th17-SAA1 cells include Csf2 , Tbx21 , and Gzmb , while decreased non-pathogenic-Th17 signature genes include Maf , Ahr , and Il10 ( Figures S2 D and S2E) ( Lee et al., 2012 25. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ). We validated elevated protein expression of GM-CSF ( Csf2 ) and T-bet ( Tbx2 1) in Th17-SAA1-differentiated cells compared with Th17-TGF-β-differentiated cells ( Figures S2 F–S2H). SAA1 had no measurable effect in Th1 differentiation culture conditions ( Figures S2 I and S2J). Using CD4 + T cells from IL23r EGFP reporter mice, we confirmed that SAA1, compared to TGF-β, potently augmented IL-6-mediated IL23r induction ( Figure 2 C). This translated into stronger STAT3 activation (pSTAT3) in SAA-differentiated Th17 cells upon exposure to IL-23 ( Figure 2 D). These in vitro studies thus suggest that SAA1 sensitizes Th17 cells to inflammatory cytokines and poises them for pathological responses.
Multiple genes involved in the Th17 pathway have been described as contributing to IBD in humans. In particular, mutations in IL23R result in either protection or predisposition to disease ( Abdollahi et al., 2016; Duerr et al., 2006; Gaffen et al., 2014 1. Abdollahi, E. ∙ Tavasolian, F. ∙ Momtazi-Borojeni, A.A. ... Protective role of R381Q (rs11209026) polymorphism in IL-23R gene in immune-mediated diseases: A comprehensive review J.

To determine if the SAAs also contribute to human Th17 cell differentiation, we subjected naive CD4 + T cells from cord blood to Th17 differentiation conditions with and without inclusion of recombinant human SAA1 or SAA2. Both SAAs substantially enhanced RORγT expression and IL-17A production in cells differentiated from multiple donors ( Figures 3 A–3C and S3 A). As in mouse, SAAs also promoted human Th17 cell differentiation in absence of TGF-β, based on upregulated expression of the RORγt-dependent chemokine receptor CCR6 ( Figures S3 B and S3C).
Increased SAA1/2 gene expression in inflamed tissues and elevated SAA serum concentrations have been reported in IBD patients with UC and CD ( Lloyd-Price et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2017; Yarur et al., 2017 29.

Serum Amyloid A as a Surrogate Marker for Mucosal and Histologic Inflammation in Patients with Crohn’s Disease Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2017; 23 :158-164 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using an antibody recognizing SAA1 and SAA2, we observed that SAA was prominently expressed by epithelia and lamina propria cells of inflamed but not non-inflamed adjacent regions of biopsies from UC patients ( Figures 3 D, 3E, and S3 D). Further, in a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of the terminal ileum lamina propria (GEO: GSE134809 ; Martin et al., 2019 32. Martin, J.C. ∙ Chang, C. ∙ Boschetti, G. ...

Of note, this population was part of a highly pathogenic module characterized by an inflammatory mononuclear phagocyte (MNP)-associated cellular response organized around IgG plasma cells, inflammatory MNP, and activated T and stromal cells (GIMATSs) that could predict resistance to anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) therapy ( Martin et al., 2019 32.

The shared ability of mouse and human SAAs to propel in vitro Th17 cell differentiation, and the observation that SAA production was elevated in inflamed lesions in IBD patients, compelled us to examine whether SAAs exert important functions in mouse colitis models. We generated Saa isotype 1, 2, 3 triple-deficient (SAA TKO ) mice and colonized these and wild-type (WT) littermates with Helicobacter hepaticus ( H. hepaticus ). We then transferred into these mice naive H. hepaticus -specific TCR transgenic (HH7-2Tg) CD4 + T cells and tracked the anti-bacterial T cell response ( Xu et al., 2018 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 A and S4 A). Previously, we showed that T cells primed by H. hepaticus in WT animals differentiate into predominantly RORγt + Foxp3 + -induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells or Bcl6 + follicular helper (T FH ) cells ( Xu et al., 2018 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this regard, examination of HH7-2Tg cells in the colonic lamina propria at 2 weeks post-adoptive transfer revealed that H. hepaticus elicited similar numbers and frequencies of HH7-2Tg iTregs and T FH cells in healthy SAA TKO and WT littermate animals, indicating that SAAs did not affect T cell differentiation at steady state ( Figures S4 B and S4C). Using the same scheme, we subjected animals to continuous IL-10RA blockade, which subverts the function and maintenance of iTreg cells, resulting in expansion of cognate pathogenic Th17 cells and colitis ( Kullberg et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2018 23. Kullberg, M.C. ∙ Jankovic, D. ∙ Feng, C.G. ... IL-23 plays a key role in Helicobacter hepaticus-induced T cell-dependent colitis J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203 :2485-2494 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A). Sustained IL-10RA blockade resulted in abundant SAA1/2 in the serum of WT mice and upregulation of Saa1-3 transcripts in the proximal colon, specifically, Saa1 and Saa2 in epithelium and Saa3 in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells ( Figures 4 B–4D, S4 D, and S4E). By contrast, in the terminal ileum of the same mice, which were also colonized with SFB, only transcripts for Saa1 and Saa2 were detected and there was little change upon IL-10RA blockade ( Figures 4 D and S4 F).
We then assessed the HH7-2Tg cell phenotype in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) of WT and SAA TKO recipients at 5 days after transfer. We observed reduced numbers of RORγt + Th17 cells in SAA TKO mice compared to WT littermates, in which T-bet upregulation was also markedly decreased ( Figures 4 E and 4F). Phenotypic analysis of HH7-2Tg cells in the colon lamina propria at 2 weeks after transfer revealed striking reductions in both proportion and absolute number of HH7-2Tg Th1 and Th17 cells, corresponding to profoundly decreased IFN-γ + , IL-17A + , and IFN-γ + IL-17A + cells in SAA TKO recipients ( Figures 4 G–4I). Notably, previous IL-17A fate mapping experiments performed in mice treated with anti-IL-10RA during H. hepaticus infection ( Morrison et al., 2013 37. Morrison, P.J. ∙ Bending, D. ∙ Fouser, L.A. ... Th17-cell plasticity in Helicobacter hepaticus-induced intestinal inflammation Mucosal Immunol. 2013; 6 :1143-1156 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), and other pathogenic Th17 responses, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), demonstrated that a significant proportion of IFNγ + cells previously expressed or descended from cells that expressed the Th17 program, described as EX Th17 ( Harbour et al., 2015; Hirota et al., 2011 14. Harbour, S.N. ∙ Maynard, C.L. ∙ Zindl, C.L. ... Th17 cells give rise to Th1 cells that are required for the pathogenesis of colitis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :7061-7066 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar 15. Hirota, K. ∙ Duarte, J.H. ∙ Veldhoen, M. ... Fate mapping of IL-17-producing T cells in inflammatory responses Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :255-263 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, reduced numbers of HH7-2Tg IFN-γ + cells in SAA TKO mice could be explained, at least in part, by the effect of SAAs on Th17 cells. Despite lower Th1 and Th17 responses in SAA TKO mice, we observed a similar reduction in both the number and frequency of HH7-2Tg T reg cells in both mutant and WT recipients after αIL10RA blockade ( Figures 4 J and S4 G). In accord with their reduced pathogenic Th response, SAA TKO mice exhibited significantly attenuated histological features of colitis compared to WT littermates following chronic IL-10RA blockade ( Figure 4 K). Altogether, these findings argue that the SAAs have a major role in the induction of pathogenic Th17 responses, both in vitro and in vivo , and thus contribute to exacerbated colonic inflammation.
To address the impact of SAAs on another Th17-dependent autoimmune disease model, we immunized mice with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to induce EAE. SAA TKO mice displayed delayed EAE onset and significantly milder disease compared to WT littermates and had reduced Th17 cell accumulation in the CNS ( Figures 5 A–5C). Following MOG immunization, transcription of Saa1 and Saa2 , but not Saa3 , increased in the liver, which corresponded to high concentrations of SAA1/2 in the serum beginning at the preclinical stage of disease ( Figures 5 D and S5 A). At the peak of disease, we also detected SAA1/2 in efferent lymph, although not in the CNS ( Figures S5 B and S5C). In contrast, Saa3 was the only Saa induced in the CNS during EAE, and was expressed by both microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages, particularly at the peak of disease ( Figures 5 E and S5 D–S5F). Immunofluorescence staining also revealed colocalization of SAA3 with IBA1, a specific marker of microglia and monocyte-derived macrophages ( Ajami et al., 2011 2. Ajami, B. ∙ Bennett, J.L. ∙ Krieger, C. ... Infiltrating monocytes trigger EAE progression, but do not contribute to the resident microglia pool Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14 :1142-1149 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the inflamed regions of the CNS marked by CD4 + T cell infiltrates ( Figures 5 F, S5 G, and S5H). Thus, SAAs are broadly induced during EAE; however, their temporal and spatial sequestration suggests that they differentially influence the fate of pathogenic Th17 cell responses.
To distinguish the role of liver-derived SAAs from CNS-derived SAAs, we compared the course of EAE in SAA1 and SAA2 double-deficient (SAA DKO ) and SAA3-deficient (SAA 3KO ) mice, respectively. Like SAA TKO mice, SAA DKO mice exhibited delayed disease onset and milder symptoms than WT littermates ( Figure 5 G). SAA 3KO mice, on the other hand, did not exhibit delayed disease onset; however, the magnitude of disease, particularly during the chronic stage of EAE, tapered faster in these animals than in WT littermates ( Figure 5 J). Th17 responses were also in striking concordance with these phenotypes, such that Th17 cell differentiation was impaired in the draining lymph nodes of SAA DKO mice ( Figures 5 H and 5I), while the Th17 response in the CNS of SAA 3KO mice was not sustained during EAE ( Figure 5 K). Taken together, these findings argue that systemic SAA1 and SAA2 exert functions early in EAE pathogenesis, while SAA3 functions subsequently to sustain inflammation locally in the CNS.
To further explore the distinct functions of SAAs in EAE pathogenesis, we employed an adoptive T cell transfer model of EAE in concert with either loss- or gain-of-function of the SAAs. We differentiated Th17-TGFβ cells in vitro from naive MOG peptide-specific 2D2 TCR transgenic T cells. When supplemented with IL-23 (Th17-IL-23 condition), these cells readily induce EAE in recipient mice ( Lee et al., 2012 25. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following adoptive transfer of Th17-IL-23 cells into WT or SAA DKO mice, all recipients developed EAE with similar kinetics and severity ( Figures 6 A–6C). Moreover, the numbers of IL-17A + 2D2 cells recovered from the CNS were indistinguishable between the two sets of recipients ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, when Th17-IL-23 2D2 cells were transferred into SAA 3KO recipients, the majority did not develop EAE, and those that did exhibited significantly milder symptoms than WT littermates (mean max score: WT = 5.9, SAA 3KO = 2.3) ( Figures 6 E–6H). Underscoring this impaired response was a significant reduction in the number of 2D2 cells infiltrating the CNS of SAA 3KO mice at the peak of disease, with lower frequencies of Th17 cells and fewer IL-17A + cells among those ( Figures S6 A–S6C). These results suggest that SAA3, produced by microglia and monocytes during EAE, engages a feed-forward loop the fuels the Th17 niche in inflamed tissue. Of note, although the combination of SAA3 with IL-6 had a much less striking effect than SAA1 and IL-6 on in vitro Th17 differentiation, in other Th17 culture settings, such as Th17-TGFβ or in combination with IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23, SAA3 potentiated Th17 differentiation to a similar degree as SAA1. These findings indicate that SAA3 can also signal directly in T cells ( Figures S6 D–S6G).
We next sought to probe the effect of SAAs on Th17 responses in the absence of other inflammatory cues. Therefore, we generated mice capable of overexpressing SAA1, by placing the coding sequence of Saa1 downstream of a LoxP -flanked transcriptional STOP cassette ( LoxP-Stop-LoxP or LSL ) in the Rosa26 locus ( LSL-SAA1 ) ( Figure S6 H). When these mice expressed a Cre transgene under control of albumin ( Alb -Cre Tg ; LSL-SAA1 or liver SAA1 mice), they exhibited high concentrations of SAA1 in serum, due to constitutive production in liver ( Figure S6 I). There was no detectable elevation of other Th17 mediators, including IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-23 ( Figure S6 J and data not shown). Consistent with the ability of SAAs to promote Th17 cell differentiation in vitro , we found that numbers of Th17 cells, but not Th1 cells, were increased in secondary lymphoid tissues of liver SAA1 mice ( Figures S6 K and S6L). Furthermore, following MOG immunization with a low dose of the attenuated adjuvant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37RA) antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA), liver SAA1 mice had increased EAE disease incidence compared to control Alb -Cre Tg littermates, suggesting that systemic elevation of SAA1 in liver SAA1 mice potentiates pathogenic Th17 effector function ( Figures S6 M and S6N). To further investigate the consequence of systemically raised SAA1 levels in Th17-dependent autoimmune pathogenesis, we transferred 2D2 Th17-TGF-β cells that, under normal settings, fail to efficiently evoke a pathogenic response ( Figure 6 I). Accordingly, few of the control Alb -Cre Tg recipient mice developed disease (2/11), but the majority of littermate liver SAA1 mice (10/13) developed EAE ( Figure 6 J). In addition, we recovered significantly higher numbers of RORγt + Th17-2D2 cells, of which a greater proportion expressed IL-17A, from the CNS of liver SAA1 recipients ( Figures 6 K and 6L). Therefore, serum SAA1/2 elevation supplants IL-23 preconditioning of Th17-TGFβ cells, consistent with a direct in vivo effect of SAAs on the myelin-specific T cells and suggesting that SAAs and IL-23 have convergent functions in Th17 autoimmune pathogenesis.

Section: Discussion

Th17 cells exert beneficial or detrimental functions under context-specific conditions at multiple body sites. In response to colonization of the small intestine with SFB, a microbe that enforces protection from enteropathogenic bacteria, Th17 cells promote strengthening of the epithelial barrier. Production of cytokines by SFB-specific Th17 cells is enhanced by local epithelial cell-derived SAA1 and SAA2, as a consequence of a signaling circuit that involves myeloid cell-derived IL-23 inducing ILC3 to produce IL-22 that, in turn, stimulates the epithelial cells. These observations prompted us to propose that Th17 cell effector functions are acquired in two steps, with SAA-independent priming of naive SFB-specific T cells in the draining mesenteric lymph nodes, accompanied by their differentiation into RORγt + poised Th17 cells, followed by migration to the lamina propria, where exposure to the SAAs results in upregulation of IL-17 cytokines. The protective function of this type of Th17 cell is highlighted by the findings that blockade of IL-17A promoted epithelial barrier permeability, exacerbating DSS-induced colitis ( Lee et al., 2015 26. Lee, J.S. ∙ Tato, C.M. ∙ Joyce-Shaikh, B. ... Interleukin-23-Independent IL-17 Production Regulates Intestinal Epithelial Permeability Immunity. 2015; 43 :727-738 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ), and by clinical trials targeting IL-17A or IL-17RA, that failed to ameliorate CD and resulted in higher rates of adverse events or disease worsening ( Hueber et al., 2012; Targan et al., 2016 18.

Gastroenterol. 2016; 111 :1599-1607 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In light of the previous results, which suggested that SAAs act on poised RORγt + cells, we were surprised to find that SAAs act directly on naive T cells, instructing their differentiation into Th17 cells in combination with the STAT3-activating cytokine IL-6. This SAA activity was critical for pathogenicity of Th17 cells in models of colitis and EAE, and likely reflects a program of differentiation distinct from that mediated by other combinations of cytokines both in vitro and in vivo .
In vitro , SAA1 induced a pathogenic Th17 program independently of TGF-β signaling. TGF-β has been shown to be dispensable for Th17 cell differentiation under some conditions both in vitro and in vivo . For example, genetic repression of Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation was shown to relieve the requirement for TGF-β in IL-6-mediated Th17 cell induction and, indeed, Th17 cells can be differentiated in vitro by a combination of IL-6, IL-23, and IL-1β ( Das et al., 2009; Ghoreschi et al., 2010 7. Das, J. ∙ Ren, G. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Transforming growth factor beta is dispensable for the molecular orchestration of Th17 cell differentiation J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :2407-2416 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Ghoreschi, K. ∙ Laurence, A. ∙ Yang, X.P. ... Generation of pathogenic T(H)17 cells in the absence of TGF-β signalling Nature. 2010; 467 :967-971 Crossref Scopus (1187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, Zhang et al. (2017) 58. Zhang, S. ∙ Takaku, M. ∙ Zou, L. ... Reversing SKI-SMAD4-mediated suppression is essential for T H 17 cell differentiation Nature. 2017; 551 :105-109 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar revealed that SKI, via SMAD4, transcriptionally repressed Rorc and that TGF-β signaling degraded or modified SKI to relieve the inhibition and promote Th17 cell differentiation in the presence of IL-6. Our studies indicate that SAAs function independently of STAT3 or the SMAD transcription factors, and they do not regulate SKI degradation (J.-Y.L., unpublished data). Elucidation of the receptor(s) and signaling pathways(s) engaged by the SAAs will be needed to provide insight into how they promote distinct differentiation programs for homeostatic and pathogenic Th17 cells.
The requirement for inducible SAAs in mouse inflammatory disease models and the selective expression of SAAs in inflamed tissue from human IBD patients support a role for these secreted proteins in Th17-mediated inflammatory disease. Our results reveal that the effects of SAAs are subject to the context of Th17 cell differentiation. In SFB-mediated Th17 induction, the SAAs do not contribute to priming, but rather amplify the effector functions of Th17 cells in SFB-colonized regions. These “homeostatic” Th17 cells do not become pathogenic even under pro-colitogenic conditions, as occurs upon blockade of the IL-10 signaling pathway ( Xu et al., 2018 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, in the absence of IL-10, H. hepaticus -specific CD4 + T cells no longer adopt a T reg cell fate, but instead differentiate into colitis-inducing pathogenic Th17 cells with a transcriptome that is strikingly different from that of homeostatic Th17 cells ( Chai et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018 5. Chai, J.N. ∙ Peng, Y. ∙ Rengarajan, S. ... Helicobacter species are potent drivers of colonic T cell responses in homeostasis and inflammation Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaal5068 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SAAs support this H. hepaticus -driven colitis, inducing pathogenic features exemplified by T-bet expression during Th17 priming and sensitization of the T cells to cytokines essential for Th17-mediated autoimmune pathogenesis, such as IL-23 and IL-1β.
The SAA proteins thus have critical roles during Th17 cell induction and potentiation of effector functions. It remains unclear what distinguishes the SAA-dependent properties associated with pathogenic versus homeostatic Th17 cells. It may be a feature of the microenvironment of T cell priming (e.g., in lymph nodes draining a healthy small intestine versus an inflamed large intestine), of other cytokines that are present, of the concentration of SAAs that are encountered, or of the cell types that produce the SAAs. A better understanding of how SAAs participate in Th17 cell differentiation may permit selective targeting of potentially harmful Th17 cells while sparing the beneficial cells.
In mouse inflammation models, we found that SAA1 and SAA2 were prominently produced by hepatocytes after systemic immune activation and by intestinal epithelial cells adjacent to colonizing bacteria, whereas SAA3 was produced by myeloid cells in both the gut and CNS. We discovered that SAA3 advanced a feed-forward loop that sustained murine Th17 responses and drove EAE pathology. Although SAA3 does not encode a full protein in humans, there are reports of inducible SAA1/2 expression by macrophages in inflamed tissues of multiple chronic inflammatory diseases ( De Buck et al., 2016; Meek et al., 1994; Ye and Sun, 2015 8. De Buck, M. ∙ Gouwy, M. ∙ Wang, J.M. ... Structure and Expression of Different Serum Amyloid A (SAA) Variants and their Concentration-Dependent Functions During Host Insults Curr. Med. Chem. 2016; 23 :1725-1755 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Meek, R.L. ∙ Urieli-Shoval, S. ∙ Benditt, E.P. Expression of apolipoprotein serum amyloid A mRNA in human atherosclerotic lesions and cultured vascular cells: implications for serum amyloid A function Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91 :3186-3190 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Ye, R.D. ∙ Sun, L. Emerging functions of serum amyloid A in inflammation J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 98 :923-929 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we and others found that tissue-derived SAA1 and SAA2 are not limited to the epithelium during inflammation. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes were shown to express and secrete SAA1/2 in rheumatoid arthritis patients ( O’Hara et al., 2000 38. O’Hara, R. ∙ Murphy, E.P. ∙ Whitehead, A.S. ... Acute-phase serum amyloid A production by rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue Arthritis Res. 2000; 2 :142-144 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we observed that activated fibroblasts in the inflamed parenchyma of CD patients expressed SAA1 and SAA2 . Given our findings and links between activated fibroblast abundance and primary anti-TNFα resistance in CD ( West et al., 2017 53. West, N.R. ∙ Hegazy, A.N. ∙ Owens, B.M.J. ..., Oxford IBD Cohort Investigators Oncostatin M drives intestinal inflammation and predicts response to tumor necrosis factor-neutralizing therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :579-589 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), it will be important to investigate whether SAAs play a causal role in this disease setting. Taken together, these findings suggest that the evolution of SAA3 into a pseudogene in humans may be ascribed to functional redundancies with SAA1 and SAA2 . However, we cannot rule out that SAA3 has a unique role in the mouse, particularly since it is considerably less effective than SAA1 and SAA2 in directing Th17 cell differentiation in the absence of TGF-β.
Although our results clearly demonstrate that SAAs interact directly with T cells and promote Th17 cell programming and response amplification, these secreted proteins also have effects on multiple other cell types. Several receptors have been described for the SAAs, including TLR2 and FPRL-1 ( Ye and Sun, 2015 56. Ye, R.D. ∙ Sun, L. Emerging functions of serum amyloid A in inflammation J. Leukoc. Biol. 2015; 98 :923-929 Crossref Scopus (211) PubMed Google Scholar ), but inactivation of the genes for these candidate molecules had no effect on SAA1-induced Th17 cell differentiation (J.-Y.L., unpublished data). While we cannot rule out SAA functions through other cell types during in vivo pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation, our results strongly support a substantial contribution through direct interaction with T cells. In particular, the finding that enforced expression of SAA1 by hepatocytes overcame non-pathogenic Th17-TGFβ priming to promote EAE is consistent with sensitization of the T cells to render them more responsive to IL-23 and potentially other pro-inflammatory cytokines.
The general importance of the SAAs in maintaining the pathogenic programming of Th17 cells was underscored by the reductions in colitis and EAE observed when tissue SAAs were absent in mice. Elucidation of the receptor(s) for SAAs on T cells will resolve the relative contributions of direct and indirect signaling cues delivered by SAAs to T cells. However, the combined results showing that SAAs provide a previously unappreciated means for inducing inflammatory Th17 cells and that adoptively transferred antigen-specific T cells confer pathogenicity based on their response to SAAs argue strongly that the disease phenotypes in SAA-deficient mice were due, at least in part, to the breach of direct SAA interactions with T cells. Together, these findings suggest that a better understanding of Th17 cell responses modulated by SAAs will facilitate therapeutic efforts to ameliorate inflammatory diseases and enforce epithelial barrier integrity.

C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All transgenic animals were bred and maintained in specific-pathogen free (SPF) conditions within the animal facility of the Skirball Institute (NYU School of Medicine. Saa1/2 double-knockout (SAA DKO ) mice were previously described ( Eckhardt et al., 2010 11. Eckhardt, E.R.M. ∙ Witta, J. ∙ Zhong, J. ... Intestinal epithelial serum amyloid A modulates bacterial growth in vitro and pro-inflammatory responses in mouse experimental colitis BMC Gastroenterol. 2010; 10 :133 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) and maintained bred to the Il17a-GFP reporter strain (JAX; C57BL/6-Il17a tm1Bcgen /J). H.hepaticus (Hh)-specific Th17-TCR tg (HH7) mice were previously described ( Xu et al., 2018 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ) and maintained on a Ly5.1 background (JAX; B6. SJLPtprc a Pepc b /BoyJ). MOG-specific TCR transgenic (2D2, JAX; C57BL/6-Tg (Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1 Kuch/J) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, and maintained on an Ly5.1 background. CD4-dnTGFBRII (JAX; B6.Cg-Tg(Cd4-TGFBR2)16Flv/J) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Il-23r-GFP mice were provided by M. Oukka ( Awasthi et al., 2009 3. Awasthi, A. ∙ Riol-Blanco, L. ∙ Jäger, A. ... Cutting edge: IL-23 receptor gfp reporter mice reveal distinct populations of IL-17-producing cells J. Immunol. 2009; 182 :5904-5908 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cx3cr1 CreER (JAX; B6.129P2(Cg)-Cx3cr1 tm2.1(cre/ERT2)Litt /WganJ) mice were bred with Rosa26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-DsRed (R26 DsRed ) mice to fate-label microglia ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 40. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ). Saa3 knockout (SAA 3KO ) and Saa1/2/3 triple-knockout (SAA TKO ) mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. A premature stop codon was inserted into exon 2 of the Saa3 locus in WT (for SAA 3KO ) or Saa1/2 knock-out (for SAA TKO ) zygotes. Guide RNA and HDR donor template sequences are listed in Table S1 . Inducible SAA1 knock-in mice (LoxP-STOP-LoxP-SAA1; LSL-SAA1) mice were generated by targeted insertion of the STOP-eGFP-ROSA26TV cassette (Addgene Plasmid 15912: CTV vector), in which the mouse Saa1 gene was sub-cloned, into the ROSA26 locus ( Figure S6 H). Without Cre-recombinase LSL-SAA1 mice were healthy, fertile, and born in Mendelian ratios. All in-house developed strains were generated by the Rodent Genetic Engineering Core (RGEC) at NYULMC. LSL-SAA1 mice were bred with Albumin-Cre (JAX; B6.Cg-Speer6-ps1Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J) mice to generate liver-specific SAA1 overexpressing mice (LSL-SAA1/Alb-cre) ( Figure S6 H). Age-(6-12 weeks) and sex-(both males and females) matched littermates stably colonized with Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB) were used for all experiments. To assay SFB colonization, SFB-specific 16S primers were used and universal 16S and/or host genomic DNA were quantified simultaneously to normalize SFB colonization in each sample. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of New York University School of Medicine.
Pinch biopsies were obtained from the colon tissues (distal and rectum) of adult UC patients (Sex: 2 males and 5 females; Age (mean ± sd): 33 ± 11) undergoing surveillance colonoscopy using 2.8 mm standard biopsy forceps, after protocol review and approval by the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (Mucosal Immune Profiling in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease; S12-01137). All biopsies were collected in ice cold complete RPMI (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin /glutamine, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol). Inflammation status of rectal tissue included in the study was confirmed by pathological examination as chronic active colitis.
Mouse T cells were purified from lymph nodes and spleens of six to eight week old mice, by sorting live (DAPI-), CD4 + CD25 - CD62L + CD44 low naive T cells using a FACSAria (BD). Detailed antibody information is provided above (Flow cytometry). Cells were cultured in IMDM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone), 10U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml gentamicin (GIBCO), 4 mM L-glutamine, and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol. For T cell polarization, 1 × 10 5 cells were seeded in 200 μl/well in 96-well plates that were pre-coated with a 1:20 dilution of goat anti-hamster IgG in PBS (STOCK = 1mg/ml, MP Biomedicals Catalog # 55398). Naive T cells were primed with anti-CD3ε (0.25 μg/mL) and anti-CD28 (1 μg/mL) for 24 hours prior to polarization. Cells were further cultured for 48h under T H -lineage polarizing conditions; Control (Con.: 20 ng/mL IL-6, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IL-4, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IFNγ, 10 μg/mL anti-TGFβ), T H 17-TGFβ (0.3 ng/mL TGF-β, 20 ng/mL IL-6, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IL-4, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IFNγ), T H 17-SAA1 (0.15-10 μg/mL rmSAA1 (R&D systems or homemade), 20 ng/mL IL-6, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IL-4, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IFNγ, 10 μg/mL anti-TGFβ) and T H 1 (100U/ml IL-2, 20ng/ml IL-12, 2.5 μg/mL anti-IL-4). For the SAA1 blocking assay, 2.5 μg/ml of rmSAA1 was preincubated with various amount (6.25 μg/ml, 12.5 μg/ml, 25 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml) of anti-mSAA1 (R&D systems, polyclonal goat IgG, antigen affinity-purified) or control polyclonal goat IgG (R&D systems) antibodies for 30 minutes prior to the treatment.
Human naive CD4 + T cells were isolated from cord blood of healthy donors using anti-human CD4 MACS beads (Miltenyi), followed by CD4 + CD25 - HLA-DR - CD45RO - CD45RA hi staining and sorting using a FACSAria (BD). Human naive CD4 + T cells were cultured for 6 days in 96-well U bottom plates with 10 U/ml of IL-2, 20 ng/mL of IL-1β, 20 ng/ml of IL-23, 1 ng/ml of TGF-β, 2.5 μg/ml of anti-IL-4, 2.5 μg/mL of anti-IFNγ and anti-CD3/CD28 activation beads (LifeTechnologies) at a ratio of 1 bead per cell, as previously described ( Manel et al., 2008 30. Manel, N. ∙ Unutmaz, D. ∙ Littman, D.R. The differentiation of human T(H)-17 cells requires transforming growth factor-beta and induction of the nuclear receptor RORgammat Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9 :641-649 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ). For monitoring cell surface expression of CCR6 on human T H 17 cells by recombinant SAA treatment (Figure S3C and S3D), isolated human naive CD4 + T cells were cultured in anti-human CD3 (OKT3)-coated 96-well flat bottom plates with 50 ng/mL of IL-1β and 50 ng/ml of IL-23, as previously described ( Revu et al., 2018 43. Revu, S. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Henkel, M. ... IL-23 and IL-1β Drive Human Th17 Cell Differentiation and Metabolic Reprogramming in Absence of CD28 Costimulation Cell Rep. 2018; 22 :2642-2653 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). 20 μg/ml of recombinant human SAA (rhSAA) proteins and 10 μg/ml anti-TGFβ neutralizing antibodies (BioXcell) were added into the culture medium during the T H 17 differentiation.
Single cell suspensions were pelleted and resuspended with surface-staining antibodies in HEPES Buffered HBSS. Staining was performed for 20-30min on ice. Surface-stained cells were washed and resuspended in live/dead fixable blue (ThermoFisher) for 5 minutes prior to fixation. For transcription factor staining, cells were treated using the FoxP3 staining buffer set from eBioscience according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Intracellular stains were prepared in 1X eBioscience permwash buffer containing anti-CD16/anti-CD32, normal mouse IgG (conc), and normal rat IgG (conc). Staining was performed for 30-60min on ice. For cytokine analysis, cells were initially incubated for 3h in RPMI or IMDM with 10% FBS, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml; Sigma), ionomycin (500 ng/ml;Sigma) and GolgiStop (BD). After surface and live/dead staining, cells were treated using the Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer set from BD Biosciences according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Intracellular stains were prepared in BD permwash in the same manner used for transcription factor staining. Absolute numbers of isolated cells from peripheral mouse tissues in all studies were determined by comparing the ratio of cell events to bead events of CountBright absolute counting beads. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on an LSR II (BD Biosciences) or an Aria II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
The large intestine was removed immediately after euthanasia, carefully stripped of mesenteric fat and the cecal patch, sliced longitudinally and vigorously washed in cold HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS to remove all fecal traces. The tissue was cut into 1-inch fragments and placed in a 50ml conical containing 10ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS and 2 mM of fresh DTT. The conical was placed in a bacterial shaker set to 37 °C and 200rpm for 7 minutes After 20 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the process was repeated once more. After 20 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the tissue was moved to a fresh conical containing 10ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS and 5 mM of EDTA. The conical was placed in a bacterial shaker set to 37 °C and 200rpm for 7 minutes. After 20 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the EDTA wash was repeated once more. Both EDTA washes were combined, passed through a 100 μM filter, then spun down at 1000rpm for 5 minutes with no brake. The supernatant was carefully aspirated and the pellet resuspended in 8ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), 5% FBS-supplemented, divalent cation-free HBSS containing 4mM CaCl 2 , DNase I (100 μg/ml; Sigma), dispase (0.05 U/ml; Worthington) and then transferred into a 15ml conical. The conical was placed horizontally in a bacterial shaker set to 37 °C and 180rpm for 7 minutes. The suspension was pipetted up-down multiple times to ensure homogenization and before adding HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS to volume. The sample was spun down at 1000rpm for 5 minutes with no brake and resuspended in an Ab cocktail to enrich for IECs (See Key Resource Table under IEC sorting) and stained for 15 minutes on ice. The cells were washed, spun down and resuspended in 2% FBS-supplemented DMEM containing DAPI and 1mM EDTA. CD326 + (Epcam1) cells were isolated through a 100 μM nozzle using a Sony SH800S.
The intestine (small and/or large) was removed immediately after euthanasia, carefully stripped of mesenteric fat and Peyer’s patches/cecal patch, sliced longitudinally and vigorously washed in cold HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS to remove all fecal traces. The tissue was cut into 1-inch fragments and placed in a 50ml conical containing 10ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS and 1 mM of fresh DTT. The conical was placed in a bacterial shaker set to 37 °C and 200rpm for 10 minutes. After 45 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the tissue was moved to a fresh conical containing 10ml of HEPES buffered (25mM), divalent cation-free HBSS and 5 mM of EDTA. The conical was placed in a bacterial shaker set to 37 °C and 200rpm for 10 minutes. After 45 s of vigorously shaking the conical by hand, the EDTA wash was repeated once more in order to completely remove epithelial cells. The tissue was minced and digested in 5-7ml of 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI containing collagenase (1 mg/ml collagenaseD; Roche), DNase I (100 μg/ml; Sigma), dispase (0.05 U/ml; Worthington) and subjected to constant shaking at 155rpm, 37 °C for 35 min (small intestine) or 55 min (large intestine). Digested tissue was vigorously shaken by hand for 2 min before adding 2 volumes of media and subsequently passed through a 70 μm cell strainer. The tissue was spun down and resuspended in 40% buffered percoll solution, which was then aliquoted into a 15ml conical. An equal volume of 80% buffered percoll solution was underlaid to create a sharp interface. The tube was spun at 2200rpm for 22 minutes at 22 °C to enrich for live mononuclear cells. Lamina propria (LP) lymphocytes were collected from the interface and washed once prior to staining.
For antigen presenting cell (APC) isolation, the cells were resuspended in an Ab cocktail to enrich for APCs (See Ab table under APC sorting) and stained for 15 minutes on ice. The cells were washed, spun down and resuspended in 2% FBS-supplemented DMEM containing DAPI. Dendritic cells and macrophage/inflammatory monocytes were sorted based on MHCII + CD11c + CD14 neg and MHCII + CD11c + CD14 + expression, respectively, through a 100 μM nozzle using a Sony SH800S.
For ILC3 isolation, the cells were resuspended in an Ab cocktail to remove cells positive for the following lineage markers (CD3, CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD19, TCRβ, TCRγ, NK1.1, KLRG1). CD127 + CD90 + were sorted through a 70 μM nozzle on an Aria II (BD Biosciences).
H. hepaticus was provided by J. Fox (MIT) and grown on blood agar plates (TSA with 5% sheep blood, Thermo Fisher) as previously described ( Xu et al., 2018 54. Xu, M. ∙ Pokrovskii, M. ∙ Ding, Y. ... c-MAF-dependent regulatory T cells mediate immunological tolerance to a gut pathobiont Nature. 2018; 554 :373-377 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). H. hepaticus -induced colitis was induced as described ( Kullberg et al., 2006 23. Kullberg, M.C. ∙ Jankovic, D. ∙ Feng, C.G. ... IL-23 plays a key role in Helicobacter hepaticus-induced T cell-dependent colitis J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203 :2485-2494 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were colonized with H. hepaticus by oral gavage on days 0 and 4 of the experiment. 1 mg of an IL-10R-blocking antibody (clone 1B1.2) was administered by intraperitoneal injection once weekly starting at day 0. After 7 days, naive HH7-2 TCRtg CD4 + T cells were adoptively transferred into the H. hepaticus colonized recipients. Briefly, spleens from donor HH7-2 TCRtg mice were collected and mechanically disassociated. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (Lonza). Naive HH7-2 Tg CD4 + T cells were sorted as CD4 + CD3 + CD44 lo CD62L hi CD25 − Vβ6 + on an Aria II (BD Biosciences). Cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and transferred into congenic recipient mice via intravenous injection. In order to confirm H. hepaticus colonization, H. hepaticus -specific 16S primers were used on DNA extracted from fecal pellets. Universal 16S were quantified simultaneously to normalize H. hepaticus colonization of each sample.
To score colitis severity, colon and cecum samples were surgically removed from all groups of mice at 12 weeks post IL-10R-blockade injection. The samples were gently swiss rolled from the distal end and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield USA). Formalin-fixed tissues were then processed for paraffin embedding, cut into 5-micron thick sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as per protocol by the Experimental Pathology Core Laboratory at New York University (NY, USA). H&E scoring was performed in a blinded fashion using coded slides. Total scores for colonic and cecum inflammation were comprised of individual scores from 4 categories: 1) Goblet cells per High Power Field (HPF) (Score of 1: 11 to 28 goblet cells per HPF; Score of 2: 1 to 10 goblet cells per HPF; Score of 3: ≤ 1 goblet cell per HPF). 2) Submucosa edema (Score of 0: no pathological changes; Score of 1: Mild edema accounting for < 50% of the diameter of the entire intestinal wall; Score of 2: moderate edema involving 50%–80% of the diameter of the entire intestinal wall; Score of 3: profound edema involving > 80% of the diameter of the entire intestinal wall). 3) Inflammatory Infiltration Depth (Score of 0: No infiltrate; Score of 1: Infiltration above muscularis mucosae; Score of 2: Infiltration extending to include submucosa; Score of 3: Transmural Infiltration). 4) Epithelial Changes (Score of 0: No changes; Score of 1: Upper third or only surface epithelial missing; Score of 2: Moderate epithelial damage with intact base of crypts; Score of 3: Severe with missing crypts).
For induction of active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), mice were immunized subcutaneously on day 0 with 100 μg of MOG 35-55 peptide, emulsified in CFA (Complete Freund’s Adjuvant supplemented with 2mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra), and injected i.p. on days 0 and 2 with 200 ng pertussis toxin (Calbiochem). For induction of attenuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in supplemental figure S6M and S6N, IFA (Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant), supplemented with 0.2mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra, were used with the same immunization scheme. For 2D2 transfer EAE experiments, in vitro polarized 2D2 Th17 cells were injected intravenously into recipient mice at 3 × 10 6 IL-17A producing 2D2 cells per recipient. Naive 2D2 TCR-transgenic CD4 + T cells from the spleen and lymph nodes of 2D2 mice were electronically sorted (CD4 + Vβ11 + CD62L hi ) and activated under T H 17-polarizing conditions, in the presence of irradiated wild-type splenocytes at a 5:1 ratio, with the following: anti-CD3 (2.5 μg/ml) (145-2C11, BioXCell), anti-IL-4 (20 μg/ml) (11B11, BioXCell), anti-IFN-γ (20 μg/ml) (XMG1.2, BioXCell), mIL-6 (30ng/ml) (Miltenyi Biotec) and hTGF-β1 (3ng/ml) (Miltenyi Biotec). After 48 h of activation, mIL-23 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems) was added, as necessary. On day 5 of culture, cells were reactivated on plates precoated with 2 μg/ml of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (PV1, BioXCell) for an additional 48 h, before adoptive transfer. The EAE scoring system was as follows: 0-no disease, 1- Partially limp tail; 2- Paralyzed tail; 3- Hind limb paresis, uncoordinated movement; 4- One hind limb paralyzed; 5- Both hind limbs paralyzed; 6- Hind limbs paralyzed, weakness in forelimbs; 7- Hind limbs paralyzed, one forelimb paralyzed; 8- Hind limbs paralyzed, both forelimbs paralyzed; 9- Moribund; 10- Death. For isolating mononuclear cells from spinal cords during EAE, spinal cords were mechanically disrupted and dissociated in RPMI containing collagenase (1 mg/ml collagenaseD; Roche), DNase I (100 μg/ml; Sigma) and 10% FBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Leukocytes were collected at the interface of a 40%/80% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). Efferent lymph fluids of pre-clinical stage mice were collected from cysterna chyli as previously described ( Matloubian et al., 2004 33. Matloubian, M. ∙ Lo, C.G. ∙ Cinamon, G. ... Lymphocyte egress from thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs is dependent on S1P receptor 1 Nature. 2004; 427 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (2196) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cx3cr1 CreERT2/+ /R26 DsRed/+ mice were gavaged with 10mg of tamoxifen diluted in corn oil at the age of 28 and 30 days. On day 60 EAE was induced by MOG-immunization and pertussis toxin injection as described. Mice were evaluated daily for weight loss and clinical development of hind limb paralysis. Mice were euthanized at the pre-clinical (day 9-10 post immunization), peak (acute; day 15-17), and chronic (day 25) stages of disease. Spinal cords were harvested, minced and digested as described. After obtaining a single cell suspension, samples were stained with the appropriate antibodies. Microglia cells and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophage cells were sorted as DsRed + CX3CR1 + CD11b + CD45 int MHCII lo B220 - CD3 - (microglia) and DsRed - CX3CR1 + CD11b + CD45 hi F480 + MHC hi B220 - CD3 - (monocyte-derived cells) on the Aria II (BD Biosciences) respectively.
Tissue preparation for immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy, and image analysis was conducted as described ( Perez et al., 2017; Yeung et al., 2014 42. Perez, O.A. ∙ Yeung, S.T. ∙ Vera-Licona, P. ... CD169 + macrophages orchestrate innate immune responses by regulating bacterial localization in the spleen Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaah5520 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Yeung, S.T. ∙ Myczek, K. ∙ Kang, A.P. ... Impact of hippocampal neuronal ablation on neurogenesis and cognition in the aged brain Neuroscience. 2014; 259 :214-222 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde, lysine, and sodium periodate buffer (PLP, 0.05 M phosphate buffer, 0.1M L-lysine, p.H. 7.4, 2 mg/mL NaIO4, and 10 mg/mL paraformaldehyde) overnight at 4°C followed by 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C and subsequent OCT media embedding. 20-μm frozen tissue sections were sectioned using a Leica CM3050S cryostat. FcR block was with anti-CD16/32 Fc block antibody (Biolegend) diluted in PBS containing 2% goat or donkey serum and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were stained with the indicated antibodies (Tables S2 and S3) diluted in PBS containing 2% goat or donkey serum, 2% FBS, and 0.05% Fc block for 1 hour at room temperature. For the intracellular staining, all antibodies including the Fc block were diluted in PBS containing 2% goat or donkey serum, 2% FBS, and 0.1% Triton-X. Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) with the Zen Black software. The imaging data were processed and analyzed using Imaris software version 9.0.1 (Bitplane; Oxford Instruments). Human SAA1/2 confocal images were analyzed by ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) to measure signal intensity. Average signal intensity for each region of interest was normalized to healthy control.
Escherichia coli codon optimized DNA sequences, encoding SAA isotypes (without the signal sequence), were chemically synthesized (GenScript) and cloned into the pET26(b)+ (Novagen) expression vector between NdeI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites, with a C-terminal hexa-histidine. Proteins were purified following the previously published protocol (Derebe et al., eLife 2014;3:e03206) with slight modifications. Briefly, proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by induction with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) for ∼4 hr at 25°C for mSAA1, and at 37°C for mSAA3. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min at 4°C and re-suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidizole for mSAA1 and 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole, 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol for mSAA3). After sonication of cell suspension, decyl maltopyranoside (DM) (Avanti Polar Lipids) was added to a final concentration of 40 mM and incubated for ∼3 hr at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was collected and incubated with Ni-NTA resin (GE HealthCare) pre-equilibrated with ice-cold corresponding lysis buffer containing 4 mM DM (DM buffer) for 3 h at 4°C under mild mixing conditions to facilitate binding. The column was washed thrice with 25 mM imidazole in DM buffer to remove the non-specific contaminants. Finally, proteins were eluted using an imidazole gradient (in DM buffer) under gravity flow. Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.2) containing 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 20 mM Imidazole. The dialyzed protein was concentrated in an Amicon stirrer cell apparatus (Millipore) to a final concentration of ∼1 mg/mL. Protein purity was assessed by SDS/PAGE.
Total RNAs from in vitro polarized T cells or sorted cell populations were extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by DNase I (QIAGEN) treatment and cleanup with RNeasy MinElute kit (QIAGEN) following manufacturer protocols. For total tissue RNA isolation, dissected tissues were homogenized in TRIzol. cDNA was generated using a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher).
Quantitative RT-PCR and PCR were performed using the Hot Start-IT SYBR Green (Affymetrix) on the Roche real-time PCR system (Roche 480). For analysis of mRNA transcripts, RNA samples were treated with DNase (Roche) prior to cDNA synthesis to avoid effect of DNA contamination. Gene specific primers spanning exons were used. Values were normalized to GAPDH for each sample.
RNA-seq libraries for in vitro polarized T H 17 lineages were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold Kit (Illumina, 20020598). The sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq or NextSeq. RNA-seq libraries were prepared and sequenced by the Genome Technology Core at New York University School of Medicine.
RNaseq libraries for isolated microglia and CNS-infiltrating monocytes were prepared and sequenced by the Illumina RapidRun at the Genome Services Laboratory, HudsonAlpha.
Fastq files were aligned to the mouse Ensemble genome GRCm38 with STAR v 2.6.1d. Read pairs were counted using the STAR aligner with option -quantMode GeneCounts, prior to normalization and differential expression analysis which were performed using DESeq2. Gene set enrichment analyses were performed with the Broad Institute’s GSEA tool. Potential enrichment of pathogenic and non-pathogenic gene sets defined from previous studies ( Lee et al., 2012 25. Lee, Y. ∙ Awasthi, A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... Induction and molecular signature of pathogenic TH17 cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :991-999 Crossref Scopus (918) PubMed Google Scholar ) were analyzed with the RNaseq data at each time point.
The single cell RNA sequencing data of SAA1 and SAA2 genes in the fibroblast clusters was analyzed as described in Martin et al. (2019) 32. Martin, J.C. ∙ Chang, C. ∙ Boschetti, G. ... Single-Cell Analysis of Crohn’s Disease Lesions Identifies a Pathogenic Cellular Module Associated with Resistance to Anti-TNF Therapy Cell. 2019; 178 :1493-1508 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar .
Differences between groups were calculated using the unpaired two-sided Welch’s t test or the two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieliun. For EAE disease induction, log-rank test using the Mantal-Cox method was performed. For RNA-seq analysis, differentially expressed genes were calculated in DESeq2 using the Wald test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction to determine the FDR. GSEA p value was calculated with gene set permutations. Genes were considered differentially expressed with FDR < 0.01 and log2 fold change > 1.2. Data was processed with GraphPad Prism, Version 8 (GraphPad Software). We treated less than 0.05 of p value as significant differences. ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, and ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. Details regarding number of replicates and the definition of center/error bars can be found in figure legends.
