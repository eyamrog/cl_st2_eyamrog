Title: Gut-Innervating Nociceptor Neurons Regulate Peyer’s Patch Microfold Cells and SFB Levels to Mediate Salmonella Host Defense


Abstract: Summary

Gut-innervating nociceptor sensory neurons respond to noxious stimuli by initiating protective responses including pain and inflammation; however, their role in enteric infections is unclear. Here, we find that nociceptor neurons critically mediate host defense against the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm). Dorsal root ganglia nociceptors protect against STm colonization, invasion, and dissemination from the gut. Nociceptors regulate the density of microfold (M) cells in ileum Peyer’s patch (PP) follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) to limit entry points for STm invasion. Downstream of M cells, nociceptors maintain levels of segmentous filamentous bacteria (SFB), a gut microbe residing on ileum villi and PP FAE that mediates resistance to STm infection. TRPV1+ nociceptors directly respond to STm by releasing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide that modulates M cells and SFB levels to protect against Salmonella infection. These findings reveal a major role for nociceptor neurons in sensing and defending against enteric pathogens.

Section: Introduction

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is one of the most heavily innervated organs in the body ( Furness et al., 2009 26. Furness, J.B. ∙ Nguyen, T.V. ∙ Nurgali, K. ... The Enteric Nervous System and Its Extrinsic Connections Yamada, T. (Editor) Textbook of Gastroenterology Blackwell Publishing, 2009; 15-39 Google Scholar ). Nociceptors are specialized sensory neurons that detect harmful stimuli, including heat, noxious chemicals, and inflammatory mediators ( Basbaum et al., 2009; Woolf and Ma, 2007 6. Basbaum, A.I. ∙ Bautista, D.M. ∙ Scherrer, G. ... Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain Cell. 2009; 139 :267-284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2908) PubMed Google Scholar 90. Woolf, C.J. ∙ Ma, Q. Nociceptors--noxious stimulus detectors Neuron. 2007; 55 :353-364 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (756) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gut-innervating nociceptors are major sensors of disturbances in the GI tract and initiate protective sensations and neural reflexes, including visceral pain and diarrhea ( Blackshaw and Gebhart, 2002; Di Giovangiulio et al., 2015; Grundy et al., 2019 9.

Physiol. 2019; 81 :261-284 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether nociceptors crosstalk with microbes and intestinal cells to regulate mucosal host defenses is poorly defined.
Invading enteric pathogens pose a major threat to gut homeostasis. Salmonella enterica serovars are responsible for 94 million cases of human gastroenteritis, 22 million cases of typhoid fever, and significant mortality yearly ( Crump et al., 2004; Majowicz et al., 2010 18. Crump, J.A. ∙ Luby, S.P. ∙ Mintz, E.D. The global burden of typhoid fever Bull. World Health Organ. 2004; 82 :346-353 PubMed Google Scholar 55. Majowicz, S.E. ∙ Musto, J. ∙ Scallan, E. ..., International Collaboration on Enteric Disease ‘Burden of Illness’ Studies The global burden of nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis Clin. Infect. Dis. 2010; 50 :882-889 Crossref Scopus (1857) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the rise of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains ( Andrews et al., 2018 2. Andrews, J.R. ∙ Qamar, F.N. ∙ Charles, R.C. ... Extensively Drug-Resistant Typhoid - Are Conjugate Vaccines Arriving Just in Time? N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379 :1493-1495 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ), there is a need to increase our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and explore host-directed treatments.
Here, we examined the role of nociceptor neurons in defending against the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm). During oral infections of mice, STm travels through the GI tract to transiently colonize the distal small intestine. Gut-resident commensal microbes limit colonization of pathogens, including STm, by competing for nutrients, secreting metabolites or toxins that counteract pathogens ( Bäumler and Sperandio, 2016; Kamada et al., 2013; Stecher and Hardt, 2011 7.

Stecher, B. ∙ Hardt, W.D. Mechanisms controlling pathogen colonization of the gut Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2011; 14 :82-91 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ), or stimulating anti-bacterial host responses that impact pathogen survival ( Blander et al., 2017; Littman and Pamer, 2011 11. Blander, J.M. ∙ Longman, R.S. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ... Regulation of inflammation by microbiota interactions with the host Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :851-860 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar 50.

Role of the commensal microbiota in normal and pathogenic host immune responses Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10 :311-323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following colonization, STm invades intestinal tissues and then disseminates to systemic sites ( Monack et al., 2000 62. Monack, D.M. ∙ Hersh, D. ∙ Ghori, N. ... Salmonella exploits caspase-1 to colonize Peyer’s patches in a murine typhoid model J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192 :249-258 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). STm invasion occurs mainly through microfold (M) cells in Peyer’s patches (PPs) ( Jepson and Clark, 2001; Jones et al., 1994 37. Jepson, M.A. ∙ Clark, M.A. The role of M cells in Salmonella infection Microbes Infect. 2001; 3 :1183-1190 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Jones, B.D. ∙ Ghori, N. ∙ Falkow, S. Salmonella typhimurium initiates murine infection by penetrating and destroying the specialized epithelial M cells of the Peyer’s patches J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180 :15-23 Crossref Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). M cells are specialized antigen-sampling cells in PP follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) that transcytose luminal antigens to underlying phagocytes to initiate mucosal immunity ( Mabbott et al., 2013; Williams and Owen, 2015 52. Mabbott, N.A. ∙ Donaldson, D.S. ∙ Ohno, H. ... Microfold (M) cells: important immunosurveillance posts in the intestinal epithelium Mucosal Immunol. 2013; 6 :666-677 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar 89. Williams, I.R. ∙ Owen, R.L. M Cells Specialized Antigen Sampling Cells in the Follicle-Associated Epithelium Mestecky, J. ∙ Russell, M.W. ∙ Cheroutre, H. ... (Editors) Mucosal Immunology Academic Press, 2015; 211-229 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). Enteric microbial pathogens including STm, poliovirus, and prions, utilize M cells as entry points to invade and cause disease ( Miller et al., 2007; Sansonetti and Phalipon, 1999 59. Miller, H. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Kuolee, R. ... Intestinal M cells: the fallible sentinels? World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13 :1477-1486 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Sansonetti, P.J. ∙ Phalipon, A. M cells as ports of entry for enteroinvasive pathogens: mechanisms of interaction, consequences for the disease process Semin. Immunol. 1999; 11 :193-203 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We demonstrate that nociceptor neurons protect against STm invasion by regulating gut microbial homeostasis and M cell abundance. Nociceptors suppressed the density of M cells in PPs to limit STm entry points. Nociceptors also maintained levels of segmentous filamentous bacteria (SFB), which were necessary and sufficient to protect against STm infection. Targeted ablation of TRPV1+ or Nav1.8+ nociceptors worsened STm infections and anatomical experiments pinpoint TRPV1+ dorsal root ganglia (DRG) nociceptors as the key neural subset mediating host protection. Nociceptors regulated M cells and SFB via the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which was released by TRPV1+ neurons during STm infection. These findings show that neuronal crosstalk with M cells and microbes mediate mucosal protection and could be a future target to treat infectious and inflammatory diseases.

Section: Results

The gut receives sensory innervation by extrinsic neurons residing within the DRG and vagal ganglia, as well as intrinsic primary afferent neurons residing within myenteric and submucosal plexi ( Figure 1 A) ( Furness et al., 2009 26. Furness, J.B. ∙ Nguyen, T.V. ∙ Nurgali, K. ... The Enteric Nervous System and Its Extrinsic Connections Yamada, T. (Editor) Textbook of Gastroenterology Blackwell Publishing, 2009; 15-39 Google Scholar ). To study the role of nociceptors in enteric host defense, we mined single-cell transcriptome data of the mouse nervous system ( Zeisel et al., 2018 92. Zeisel, A. ∙ Hochgerner, H. ∙ Lonnerberg, P. ... Molecular Architecture of the Mouse Nervous System Cell. 2018; 174 :999-1014.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1503) PubMed Google Scholar ). Scn10a (encoding Nav1.8, a voltage-gated sodium channel marking nociceptors) and Trpv1 (encoding TRPV1, a nociceptive ion channel that detects heat and capsaicin) are highly expressed by DRG neurons but absent in enteric neurons ( Figure S1 A). We also analyzed single-cell data from labeled gut-innervating DRG neurons ( Hockley et al., 2019 35. Hockley, J.R.F. ∙ Taylor, T.S. ∙ Callejo, G. ... Single-cell RNAseq reveals seven classes of colonic sensory neuron Gut. 2019; 68 :633-644 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found overlap of neural populations expressing Scn10a and Trpv1 ( Figure S1 B). We reasoned that experimental strategies aimed at Nav1.8 or TRPV1 may target gut-extrinsic nociceptors without affecting gut-intrinsic enteric neurons ( Figure 1 A).
We bred Nav1.8-Cre/Diphtheria toxin A (DTA) mice to specifically ablate Nav1.8-lineage nociceptors ( Abrahamsen et al., 2008 1. Abrahamsen, B. ∙ Zhao, J. ∙ Asante, C.O. ... The cell and molecular basis of mechanical, cold, and inflammatory pain Science. 2008; 321 :702-705 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ). Scn10a transcripts were lost in DRG and vagal ganglia of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice compared to control littermates and absent in myenteric plexi ( Figure 1 B). Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice showed significant reduction in TRPV1+ and CGRP+ neurons in DRG and vagal ganglia, and NF200+ A-fibers were proportionately increased ( Figures S1 C and S1D). We orally infected mice with STm and found significantly higher STm load in the ileum and PP of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice compared to control mice at 1 day post-infection (dpi) ( Figure 1 C). STm load was significantly higher in the cecum and trended toward an increase in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice ( Figure S1 G). We analyzed STm dissemination to systemic sites at 5 dpi. Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice had significantly higher STm load in the spleen and liver and greater weight loss compared to control mice ( Figure 1 C). Thus, Nav1.8+ neurons play a critical role in STm host defense.
Given that Nav1.8 overlaps with TRPV1 in gut-innervating neurons, we next used complementary, non-developmental strategies to target TRPV1 neurons. Subcutaneous injections of resiniferatoxin (RTX), a potent TRPV1 agonist, denervates TRPV1 neurons ( Szolcsanyi et al., 1991 76. Szolcsanyi, J. ∙ Szallasi, A. ∙ Szallasi, Z. ... Resiniferatoxin. An ultrapotent neurotoxin of capsaicin-sensitive primary afferent neurons Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1991; 632 :473-475 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice treated with RTX showed significantly decreased Trpv1 transcripts ( Figure 1 D) and decreased proportions of TRPV1+ and CGRP+ neurons in DRG and vagal ganglia compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figures S1 E and S1F). Following oral infection, RTX-treated mice had significantly higher STm load in the ileum, PP, and MLNs at 1 dpi ( Figures 1 E and S1 H) and greater STm dissemination to spleen and liver and weight loss at 5 dpi compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 1 E). We also infected mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) to bypass the gut barrier to examine whether nociceptors modulated systemic replication of STm. By contrast with oral infections, STm loads in spleens and livers did not differ between i.p. infected RTX- and vehicle-treated mice ( Figure S2 A).
We next utilized a genetic strategy to ablate TRPV1+ neurons in adult mice. Trpv1-DTR mice were injected with diphtheria toxin (DTX) to ablate TRPV1+ neurons in DRG and vagal ganglia ( Baral et al., 2018; Pogorzala et al., 2013 4. Baral, P. ∙ Umans, B.D. ∙ Li, L. ... Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and γδ T cell responses in bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :417-426 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Pogorzala, L.A. ∙ Mishra, S.K. ∙ Hoon, M.A. The cellular code for mammalian thermosensation J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :5533-5541 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Orally infected DTX-treated Trpv1-DTR mice had significantly higher STm load in the ileum, PP, and MLNs at 1 dpi, as well as increased STm dissemination to spleen and liver and weight loss at 5 dpi ( Figures 1 F and S1 I). Therefore, using three different targeting approaches, we found that nociceptors are necessary to protect against STm infection, invasion of PPs, and peripheral dissemination.
We next aimed to define the key neural subsets mediating STm protection. We analyzed whether our targeting strategies were specific to extrinsic nociceptors or if enteric neurons were impacted. RTX treatment led to loss of thick CGRP+ nerve tracts carrying extrinsic fibers within the mesentery and into the myenteric plexus, and intrinsic CGRP+ enteric neurons remained intact ( Figures 2 A and 2B). RTX treatment also eliminated tdTomato+ fibers in the myenteric plexus of Nav1.8-Cre / tdTomato mice, highlighting the overlap between TRPV1 and Nav1.8 neural subsets ( Figure 2 C). Transcripts for Hand2 , a transcription factor necessary for enteric neuron differentiation ( D’Autréaux et al., 2007 19. D’Autréaux, F. ∙ Morikawa, Y. ∙ Cserjesi, P. ... Hand2 is necessary for terminal differentiation of enteric neurons from crest-derived precursors but not for their migration into the gut or for formation of glia Development. 2007; 134 :2237-2249 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not differ between nociceptor-ablated and control mice ( Figures S2 B and S2C). The number of enteric neurons expressing HuD+ (pan-neuronal marker) and the proportions of calretinin+, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS+), CGRP+ enteric neurons were unchanged in myenteric plexi of nociceptor-ablated versus control mice ( Figures S2 D–S2G). Thus, these nociceptor-targeting strategies preserved the architecture of enteric neurons.
We next determined whether DRG or vagal nociceptors contributed to STm host defense. To address the role of TRPV1+ DRG neurons, we injected mice intrathecally (i.t.) with RTX or vehicle ( Mishra and Hoon, 2010 60. Mishra, S.K. ∙ Hoon, M.A. Ablation of TrpV1 neurons reveals their selective role in thermal pain sensation Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2010; 43 :157-163 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intrathecal RTX injections reduced TRPV1+ neurons in the DRG without impacting vagal TRPV1+ neurons ( Figure 2 D). During STm infection, mice ablated of TRPV1+ DRG neurons had significantly higher STm load in the ileum and PP at 1 dpi and spleen and liver at 5 dpi and greater weight loss ( Figure 2 E). We tested the contribution of vagal neurons by injecting DTX or vehicle into vagal ganglia of Trpv1-DTR mice ( Baral et al., 2018; Tränkner et al., 2014 4. Baral, P. ∙ Umans, B.D. ∙ Li, L. ... Nociceptor sensory neurons suppress neutrophil and γδ T cell responses in bacterial lung infections and lethal pneumonia Nat. Med. 2018; 24 :417-426 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Tränkner, D. ∙ Hahne, N. ∙ Sugino, K. ... Population of sensory neurons essential for asthmatic hyperreactivity of inflamed airways Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11515-11520 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), which resulted in specific loss of vagal TRPV1+ neurons without affecting TRPV1+ DRG neurons ( Figure 2 F). Upon infection, there were no differences in STm tissue loads at 1 or 5 dpi ( Figure 2 G).
Together, these data demonstrated that extrinsic TRPV1+ DRG neurons, but not vagal neurons, are the key neuronal subset mediating STm host defense. This finding fits with tracing studies showing that vagal neurons mainly innervate the stomach and duodenum ( Wang and Powley, 2000 86. Wang, F.B. ∙ Powley, T.L. Topographic inventories of vagal afferents in gastrointestinal muscle J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421 :302-324 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), while DRG neurons innervate throughout the GI tract including the ileum, jejunum, and colon ( Tan et al., 2008 80. Tan, L.L. ∙ Bornstein, J.C. ∙ Anderson, C.R. Distinct chemical classes of medium-sized transient receptor potential channel vanilloid 1-immunoreactive dorsal root ganglion neurons innervate the adult mouse jejunum and colon Neuroscience. 2008; 156 :334-343 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Gut commensals play an essential role in resisting enteric bacterial infections and shaping immune responses ( Blander et al., 2017; Littman and Pamer, 2011 11. Blander, J.M. ∙ Longman, R.S. ∙ Iliev, I.D. ... Regulation of inflammation by microbiota interactions with the host Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :851-860 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Littman, D.R. ∙ Pamer, E.G. Role of the commensal microbiota in normal and pathogenic host immune responses Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 10 :311-323 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (420) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that nociceptor-ablated mice had higher STm levels in the ileum, we hypothesized that nociceptors may regulate gut bacterial composition to mediate resistance against STm.
We analyzed bacterial communities by 16S rRNA sequencing in single-housed Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control littermates. We collected feces at 4 and 10 weeks of age, as well as luminal contents and mucosal scrapings from the duodenum, ileum, and colon. Bacterial diversity, as measured by Chao1 index and rarefaction curves, was significantly increased in ileums of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA compared to control mice ( Figures 3 A and 3B). By contrast, bacterial richness was similar in duodenum, colon, and feces among these mice. Principal component analysis showed separation between Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control ileum samples but not at other sites ( Figure 3 C). Major phyla differences in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA compared to control mice corresponded to decreased Firmicutes and increased Bacteroidetes ( Figure 3 D). Within Firmicutes , Clostridiaceae family members were substantially reduced in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice (red bar, Figure 3 E). This was largely accounted for at the genus level by reduced levels of SFB in the ileum lumen and mucosa ( Figures 3 F and 3G).
SFB was the most abundant genus in ileum mucosa of control mice (56% of OTUs) and was significantly decreased in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice (9% of OTUs) ( Figure 3 F). In the ileum lumen, SFB was also greatly decreased in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA compared to control mice (0.2% versus 18% of OTUs) ( Figure 3 G). Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice concurrently displayed increased Sutterella, Desulfovibrio, Oscillospira, and Prevotella levels in the ileum, though their abundance was minor compared to SFB ( Figures 3 F and 3G).
We next analyzed SFB in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice using SFB-specific qPCR primers to confirm the 16S analysis. Across 7 different litters, SFB levels were significantly lower in ileum mucosa and lumen samples from Nav1.8-Cre/DTA compared to control mice ( Figure 3 H). We next determined whether TRPV1+ neurons also regulated SFB. SFB levels were significantly lower in both the ileum mucosa and lumen of RTX-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 3 I). These data indicate that nociceptors shape microbial homeostasis in the small intestine ileum and notably maintain levels of SFB.
SFB has been shown to protect against enteric bacterial pathogens including Salmonella enteriditis, Citrobacter rodentium , and Escherichia coli ( Garland et al., 1982; Heczko et al., 2000; Ivanov et al., 2009 29. Garland, C.D. ∙ Lee, A. ∙ Dickson, M.R. Segmented filamentous bacteria in the rodent small intestine: Their colonization of growing animals and possible role in host resistance to Salmonella Microb. Ecol. 1982; 8 :181-190 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Heczko, U. ∙ Abe, A. ∙ Finlay, B.B. Segmented filamentous bacteria prevent colonization of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli O103 in rabbits J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 181 :1027-1033 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether nociceptor regulation of SFB could mediate host resistance to STm, we examined whether SFB was sufficient to protect against STm. Mice from the Jackson Laboratory (Jax) are reported to lack SFB, while mice from Taconic Biosciences have high SFB levels ( Ivanov et al., 2009 36. Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Atarashi, K. ∙ Manel, N. ... Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed using qPCR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that Jax mice lacked SFB, whereas Taconic mice harbored SFB ( Figure S3 A). We next gavaged SFB-monocolonized feces or germ-free feces into Jax mice ( Figure 3 J). A parallel cohort of Jax mice were gavaged with Bacteroides fragilis -monocolonized feces, an unrelated gut microbe as a control. After 10 days, microbial colonization was confirmed by fecal qPCR ( Figure S3 B), and then mice were orally infected with STm. Jax mice gavaged with SFB feces had reduced STm in the ileum and PP at 1 dpi compared to Jax mice gavaged with germ-free or B. fragilis feces ( Figure 3 J). These data show that SFB can protect against STm infection.
By SEM analysis, we observed a dense population of SFB attached to the FAE on the dome of ileal PP ( Figure S3 A). Given that STm invades the host mainly through ileal PP FAE, we hypothesized that PP-associated SFB may be a defense mechanism against invasion. We examined SFB levels in nociceptor-ablated mice by focusing on PP versus villi locations. SEM revealed that ileal PP FAE of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice had more exposed regions not covered by SFB compared to control mice ( Figure 4 A). RTX-treated mice showed similar loss of SFB attachment to ileal PP FAE compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 4 B). We next performed SFB qPCR on mucosa scraped from villi and PP segments. Nav1.8-Cre/DTA had significantly less SFB in villi mucosa and a trend toward a decrease in PP mucosa compared to control mice ( Figure 4 C). RTX subcutaneously injected mice had significantly less SFB in both ileum villi and PP mucosa compared to vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 4 D). Using intrathecal injections of RTX versus vehicle, we found that ablating TRPV1+ DRG neurons significantly reduced SFB levels in the ileum PP mucosa, villi mucosa, and lumen ( Figure S3 C).
To understand how SFB and STm may be interacting at the PP, we inoculated a ligated ileum loop with STm. SEM imaging revealed SFB embedded in the PP FAE, whereas smaller rod-shaped bacteria (which may be STm or other bacilli) were found adhering to mucus nearby ( Figure 4 E). The bacterial size differences and density of SFB attached to FAE suggest that SFB may hinder STm invasion of PPs.
To test whether SFB is required for nociceptor-mediated host defense against STm, we performed RTX-mediated TRPV1 neuron ablation in Jax mice (without SFB) and in Taconic mice (with SFB) and then orally infected them with STm. Between vehicle- and RTX-treated Jax mice, we found no differences in STm infection ( Figure 4 F). By contrast, RTX-treated Taconic mice had significant defects in STm host defense compared to vehicle-treated Taconic mice ( Figure 4 G). Thus, SFB is required for nociceptor regulation of STm infection.
We tested whether transplanting SFB can restore STm host defense in nociceptor-ablated mice. We gavaged Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice with SFB-monocolonized feces and confirmed that SFB levels increased in ileum mucosa of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice ( Figure S3 D). SFB gavage into control mice, which have higher baseline levels of SFB, did not further enhance SFB levels. Upon STm infection, we found that SFB-gavaged Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice had decreased STm load in the ileum at 1 dpi compared to self-feces gavaged Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice ( Figure 4 H). At 5 dpi, SFB transplantation into Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice decreased STm dissemination to liver ( Figure S3 E). We next tested whether SFB could restore STm defenses in TRPV1 neuron-ablated mice, which also had defects in maintaining SFB. Vehicle-treated or RTX-treated mice were gavaged with vehicle or SFB-monocolonized feces, infected with STm, and analyzed at 1 dpi. Transplanting SFB into RTX-treated mice significantly reduced STm load in the ileum, PP, and MLNs ( Figure 4 I). Together, these data indicate that nociceptors regulate homeostatic levels of SFB, which sets a threshold for STm colonization and invasion.
Several enteric pathogens, including STm, invade ileal Peyer’s patches by exploiting Microfold (M) cells as cellular entry points ( Jepson and Clark, 2001; Jones et al., 1994 37. Jepson, M.A. ∙ Clark, M.A. The role of M cells in Salmonella infection Microbes Infect. 2001; 3 :1183-1190 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Jones, B.D. ∙ Ghori, N. ∙ Falkow, S. Salmonella typhimurium initiates murine infection by penetrating and destroying the specialized epithelial M cells of the Peyer’s patches J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180 :15-23 Crossref Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sensory nerves have also been shown to innervate the dome of the PP ( Vulchanova et al., 2007 85. Vulchanova, L. ∙ Casey, M.A. ∙ Crabb, G.W. ... Anatomical evidence for enteric neuroimmune interactions in Peyer’s patches J. Neuroimmunol. 2007; 185 :64-74 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that neurons may interact with M cells to regulate STm invasion. Glycoprotein 2 (GP2) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that marks mature M cells ( Mabbott et al., 2013 52. Mabbott, N.A. ∙ Donaldson, D.S. ∙ Ohno, H. ... Microfold (M) cells: important immunosurveillance posts in the intestinal epithelium Mucosal Immunol. 2013; 6 :666-677 Crossref Scopus (509) PubMed Google Scholar ). By whole-mount staining, we found Tuj1+ nerve fibers juxtaposed to GP2+ M cells in the dome of the PP ( Figure 5 A and Video S1 ). STm uses the FimH adhesin protein to bind to GP2 and invade M cells ( Hase et al., 2009 33. Hase, K. ∙ Kawano, K. ∙ Nochi, T. ... Uptake through glycoprotein 2 of FimH(+) bacteria by M cells initiates mucosal immune response Nature. 2009; 462 :226-230 Crossref Scopus (515) PubMed Google Scholar ). We infected Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice with wild-type (WT) or mutant STm lacking FimH ( ΔFimH ). By contrast to WT STm, ΔFimH STm were unable to invade the PP of either nociceptor-ablated or control mice ( Figure 5 B). These data suggest that nerves may interact with M cells and regulate bacterial invasion of PPs.

Tuj1+ Nerves (Green) and GP2+ M Cells (Red) in Ileal PP FAE of Wild-Type Mice, Related to Figure 5
We analyzed the abundance of GP2+ M cells in ileal PP FAE of nociceptor-ablated compared to control mice. We found significantly increased GP2+ M cell density at homeostasis in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA compared to control mice, RTX-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice, and DTX-treated compared to vehicle-treated Trpv1-DTR mice ( Figures 5 C–5E). The increased GP2 density in nociceptor-ablated mice was anatomically restricted to ileal PPs since GP2 levels in PP from the duodenum and jejunum did not differ between Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice or RTX-treated mice compared to controls ( Figures S4 A and S4B). During infection, STm rapidly induces M cells in the PP FAE ( Tahoun et al., 2012 77. Tahoun, A. ∙ Mahajan, S. ∙ Paxton, E. ... Salmonella transforms follicle-associated epithelial cells into M cells to promote intestinal invasion Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12 :645-656 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). At 5 dpi, STm infection upregulated and equalized ileal GP2 cells between Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control mice and also increased M cells in RTX- and vehicle-treated mice ( Figures 5 C and 5D). We analyzed a second M cell marker, SpiB, which is a transcription factor involved in early differentiating M cells ( Kanaya et al., 2012 41. Kanaya, T. ∙ Hase, K. ∙ Takahashi, D. ... The Ets transcription factor Spi-B is essential for the differentiation of intestinal microfold cells Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :729-736 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). SpiB density was significantly greater in RTX-treated compared to vehicle-treated mice at homeostasis ( Figure S4 C). Thus, nociceptors suppress homeostatic levels of M cells in ileal PP FAE, which could be a mechanism of host defense.
We next examined the relationship between M cells and SFB. To test whether SFB affects M cells, we gavaged Jax mice with SFB-monocolonized feces or their own feces lacking SFB. After confirming SFB colonization ( Figure S4 D), we found that SFB gavages did not affect ileal GP2 density in these mice ( Figure 5 F). We next transplanted SFB into nociceptor-ablated mice. SFB gavages into Nav1.8-Cre/DTA or control mice did not affect GP2 density compared to mice gavaged with self-feces ( Figure S4 E). Furthermore, TRPV1 neuron ablation by RTX treatment resulted in elevated GP2 density in both Jax and Taconic mice ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Therefore, nociceptor ablation leads to elevated M cell numbers independent of SFB levels.
We asked the reciprocal question of whether M cells affect SFB levels. M cell differentiation requires RANKL signaling via its receptor RANK ( Knoop et al., 2009; Nagashima et al., 2017 45. Knoop, K.A. ∙ Kumar, N. ∙ Butler, B.R. ... RANKL is necessary and sufficient to initiate development of antigen-sampling M cells in the intestinal epithelium J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :5738-5747 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar 63. Nagashima, K. ∙ Sawa, S. ∙ Nitta, T. ... Identification of subepithelial mesenchymal cells that induce IgA and diversify gut microbiota Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :675-682 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). We utilized injections of αRANKL antibody to transiently deplete M cells ( Knoop et al., 2009 45. Knoop, K.A. ∙ Kumar, N. ∙ Butler, B.R. ... RANKL is necessary and sufficient to initiate development of antigen-sampling M cells in the intestinal epithelium J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :5738-5747 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). αRANKL treatment, but not IgG control, significantly reduced GP2+ M cells in ileal PPs ( Figure 6 A). Using qPCR of ileum mucosal scrapings, we found that M cell depletion led to a 7.0-fold increase in SFB levels in PP mucosa compared to IgG-treated mice ( Figure 6 A). Thus, depleting M cells leads to higher SFB levels.
Nociceptor suppression of M cells could be a key defense mechanism given that ileal M cells serve as STm invasion points, and M cells regulated SFB levels. To test whether M cells are involved in nociceptor-mediated host defense, we depleted M cells in nociceptor-ablated mice by αRANKL treatment. Compared to IgG control, αRANKL eliminated ileal GP2 cells in vehicle and RTX-treated mice before and after STm infection ( Figures 6 B and S4 F). Upon infection, IgG-treated, M-cell-sufficient RTX mice had higher STm loads in the ileum and PP at 1 dpi and spleen and liver at 5 dpi compared to IgG-treated vehicle mice ( Figures 6 C and S4 G). By contrast, αRANKL treatment led to a drastic reduction of STm loads in RTX- and vehicle-treated mice in PP at 1 dpi and spleen and liver at 5 dpi ( Figures 6 C and S4 G). We used a second M cell depletion strategy to examine their role in neural-mediated host defense. Villin-Cre mice bred with RANK fl/fl mice generate RANK ΔIEC mice that lack RANK signaling in gut epithelial cells, resulting in loss of M cells ( Rios et al., 2016 70. Rios, D. ∙ Wood, M.B. ∙ Li, J. ... Antigen sampling by intestinal M cells is the principal pathway initiating mucosal IgA production to commensal enteric bacteria Mucosal Immunol. 2016; 9 :907-916 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). We treated RANK ΔIEC and control mice ( RANK fl/fl ) with vehicle or RTX to ablate TRPV1+ neurons. We confirmed by immunostaining that GP2 cells were absent in vehicle and RTX-treated RANK ΔIEC mice ( Figure 6 D). Upon infection, STm loads in spleen and liver were significantly diminished in RANK ΔIEC mice that lacked M cells ( Figure 6 E). Thus, nociceptor regulation of M cells is required to protect against STm, and M cell depletion restores host defense in nociceptor-ablated mice.
We examined whether nociceptor neurons regulated other intestinal cell types in STm host defense. Transcriptional analysis of ileal epithelial cells from Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control mice revealed few differentially expressed genes (>4-fold, p < 0.01) at homeostasis or after STm infection ( Figure S5 A). Antimicrobial peptides and tight junction transcripts also did not differ between mice ( Figure S5 B). We did not detect differences in intestinal permeability ( Figure S5 C) or epithelial proliferation (Epcam+Ki67+) between Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control mice ( Figure S5 D).
We next determined if specific gut immune cells were regulated by nociceptors. Total CD45+ cells did not differ in ileum lamina propria between RTX- and vehicle-treated mice before or after infection ( Figure S5 E). Th17 cells (IL17A+CD4+TCRβ+) and Th1 cells (IFNγ+CD4+TCRβ+) did not differ between Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control mice ( Figure S5 F). Nor did we find differences in T regulatory cells (Foxp3+CD4+TCRβ+) in vehicle- and RTX-treated mice ( Figure S5 G). We did not detect differences in ILC3 populations (NKp46+, CD4+RORγt+, CD4-RORγt+ out of Lin-Thy1+) in Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control mice ( Figure S5 H). Myeloid populations (CD103 + MHCII + CD11c + , CD11b + F4/80 lo , and CD11b + F/480 hi ) did not differ between vehicle- and RTX-treated mice ( Figure S5 I).
The number of PPs, follicle number per PP, and follicle area did not differ between nociceptor-ablated and control mice ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Proliferative PP epithelial cells did not differ between vehicle- and RTX-treated mice ( Figure S6 C). RANKL expressed by PP stromal cells mediates M cell differentiation ( Nagashima et al., 2017 63. Nagashima, K. ∙ Sawa, S. ∙ Nitta, T. ... Identification of subepithelial mesenchymal cells that induce IgA and diversify gut microbiota Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :675-682 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). We analyzed PP stromal cells and found no difference in proportions of fibroblast reticular, blood endothelial, or lymphatic endothelial cells in vehicle- and RTX-treated mice ( Figure S6 D). We analyzed RANKL and OPG (osteoprotegerin, a negative regulator of RANKL signaling) transcripts in ileal PPs but did not detect differences between vehicle- and RTX-treated mice ( Figure S6 E). We also analyzed select PP immune populations. We did not detect differences in F4/80+ macrophages, CD11b- dendritic cells (DCs), but we did see increased CD11b+CD11c+MHC-II+ DCs in RTX-treated mice ( Figure S6 F). There were no differences in PP CD3+ T cells, B220+ B cells, IgA+ B cells, GL7+ B cells, nor fecal IgA levels ( Figures S6 G–S6I). Lastly, we found no difference in ileal intraepithelial TCRγδ+ cell numbers between Nav1.8-Cre/DTA and control mice, including subsets of Vγ1+, Vγ2+, Vγ7+, or Vδ4+ cells ( Figure S6 J).
Nociceptors can directly sense microbial products and release neuropeptides locally to modulate inflammatory processes ( Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2017; Talbot et al., 2016 65. Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ∙ Verri, Jr., W.A. ∙ Chiu, I.M. Nociceptor Sensory Neuron-Immune Interactions in Pain and Inflammation Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :5-19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (635) PubMed Google Scholar 79. Talbot, S. ∙ Foster, S.L. ∙ Woolf, C.J. Neuroimmunity: Physiology and Pathology Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34 :421-447 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that nociceptors could detect STm invasion and release neuropeptides that play a role in STm host defense. Using DRG neuron cultures, we found that STm robustly induced calcium influx in a subset of capsaicin-responsive TRPV1+ DRG neurons ( Figure 7 A). Calcium influx in nociceptors leads to vesicular release of neuropeptides including CGRP. We found that STm induced DRG neurons to release CGRP in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 7 B). Both heat-inactivated STm and supernatant from STm cultures induced CGRP release, which was blocked by botulinum neurotoxin A, an inhibitor of SNARE-dependent vesicle fusion.
We next determined if nociceptors release CGRP during STm infection in vivo . We performed a time-course analysis of CGRP release from ileum explants of orally infected WT mice ( Figure 7 C). STm induced CGRP release that peaked at 6 hours post-infection (hpi) and was still present at 24 hpi. We analyzed CGRP release from orally infected vehicle- and RTX-treated mice. STm induced significant CGRP release from ileal explants of vehicle-treated mice, but not RTX-treated mice ( Figure 7 D). Together, these data show that TRPV1+ DRG neurons directly respond to STm by calcium influx and CGRP release and that TRPV1+ neurons are a major contributing source of CGRP release during STm infection.
We next determined the functional role of CGRP in STm host defense. Using anti-CGRP staining and Calca-GFP reporter mice ( McCoy et al., 2013 57. McCoy, E.S. ∙ Taylor-Blake, B. ∙ Street, S.E. ... Peptidergic CGRPα primary sensory neurons encode heat and itch and tonically suppress sensitivity to cold Neuron. 2013; 78 :138-151 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found CGRP+ nerve fibers are adjacent to GP2+ M cells within ileal PP FAE ( Figures 7 E and S7 A; Video S2 ). CGRP is expressed as 2 isoforms, Calca (CGRPα) and Calcb (CGRPβ), which have similar functional activity ( Russell et al., 2014 71. Russell, F.A. ∙ King, R. ∙ Smillie, S.J. ... Calcitonin gene-related peptide: physiology and pathophysiology Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94 :1099-1142 Crossref Scopus (849) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both isoforms are expressed by gut-innervating DRG neurons ( Figure S7 B) and are significantly reduced in DRGs of Nav1.8-Cre/DTA mice ( Figure S7 C). To examine whether the Calca isoform plays a role in STm host defense, we analyzed ileal GP2+ M cell density in Calca −/− and Calca +/+ littermates. Calca −/− mice had significantly higher GP2 density at homeostasis and after STm infection ( Figure 7 F). We also analyzed GP2 density in Calcb −/− mice. By contrast with Calca −/− mice, GP2 density did not differ between Calcb +/+ and Calcb −/− mice at homeostasis ( Figure S7 D). We tested the possibility that CGRP could directly inhibit M cell differentiation using epithelial organoids cultured from small intestinal crypts. Treatment of organoids with RANKL led to upregulation of Gp2 and Spib M cell transcripts, which were not affected by the addition of CGRP ( Figure S7 E). We next examined whether CGRPα could regulate SFB levels. Calca −/− mice showed significantly reduced SFB levels in the PP and villi mucosa compared to Calca +/+ mice ( Figure 7 G). Finally, to examine whether CGRPα contributes to host defense during STm infection, we orally infected Calca −/− mice with STm. Calca −/− mice had significantly increased STm loads in the ileum and PP at 1 dpi and the spleen and liver at 5 dpi compared to Calca +/+ mice ( Figure 7 H). Therefore, we identified CGRP as a key neuropeptide released by nociceptors that regulates ileal M cell homeostasis and SFB levels to impact host susceptibility to STm infection.

Section: Discussion

A fundamental role of nociceptor neurons is to protect mammals from danger by initiating protective reflexes. Here, we find that nociceptors play a crucial role in limiting enteric pathogen invasion of the GI tract. We show that nociceptors protect against Salmonella infection by regulating M cell density to limit pathogen entry points of invasion. Nociceptors and M cells also maintained ileal microbial homeostasis and SFB levels to facilitate host resistance to STm. These two defensive mechanisms are linked by neuronal release of CGRP, which regulated both M cells and SFB levels to impact STm infection. Thus, nociceptor neurons crosstalk with epithelial cells and gut microbes to regulate intestinal barrier defenses.
Nociceptors can directly sense bacterial and fungal products to elicit pain and regulate inflammation ( Chiu et al., 2013; Kashem et al., 2015; Maruyama et al., 2017; Talbot et al., 2015 15.

Silencing Nociceptor Neurons Reduces Allergic Airway Inflammation Neuron. 2015; 87 :341-354 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we found that STm stimulation of DRG neurons induces calcium influx and CGRP release. Nociceptors have been found to sense bacterial molecules including lipopolysaccharides, flagellin, N-formyl peptides, and pore-forming toxins (α-hemolysin, phenol soluble modulins, streptolysin S) ( Blake et al., 2018; Meseguer et al., 2014; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2015 10.

Med. 2015; 21 :1326-1331 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nociceptor activation may be a mechanism of anticipatory host defense, a concept recently demonstrated in skin. Optogenetic activation of cutaneous TRPV1+ nociceptors induced dendritic and T cell responses that protected against C. albicans and S. aureus challenge ( Cohen et al., 2019 16. Cohen, J.A. ∙ Edwards, T.N. ∙ Liu, A.W. ... Cutaneous TRPV1(+) Neurons Trigger Protective Innate Type 17 Anticipatory Immunity Cell. 2019; 178 :919-932.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study shows that TRPV1+ nociceptors set the threshold for host defense in the small intestine by neural suppression of M cells and maintenance of SFB. Nociceptor detection of noxious stimuli in the gut, including pathogens, diet-derived irritants, mechanical injury, or inflammatory mediators, could lead to suppression of M cell numbers to protect the gut from future exposure to toxins or pathogens.
The gut microbiota is shaped by the host microenvironment, including immune and epithelial derived anti-microbial factors ( Bevins and Salzman, 2011; Garrett et al., 2010 8. Bevins, C.L. ∙ Salzman, N.H. Paneth cells, antimicrobial peptides and maintenance of intestinal homeostasis Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9 :356-368 Crossref Scopus (895) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Garrett, W.S. ∙ Gordon, J.I. ∙ Glimcher, L.H. Homeostasis and inflammation in the intestine Cell. 2010; 140 :859-870 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that nociceptors shaped the small intestine microbiota by maintaining levels of SFB attached to PP and villi. SFB uses holdfasts to attach to epithelial cells ( Ladinsky et al., 2019 49. Ladinsky, M.S. ∙ Araujo, L.P. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Endocytosis of commensal antigens by intestinal epithelial cells regulates mucosal T cell homeostasis Science. 2019; 363 :6431 Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar ). It is plausible that nociceptor regulation of M cells changes the FAE composition to create more space for SFB attachment. It was proposed that SFB preferentially adheres to PP FAE enterocytes rather than M cells ( Jepson et al., 1993 38. Jepson, M.A. ∙ Clark, M.A. ∙ Simmons, N.L. ... Actin accumulation at sites of attachment of indigenous apathogenic segmented filamentous bacteria to mouse ileal epithelial cells Infect. Immun. 1993; 61 :4001-4004 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Fitting with this mechanism, our data and a recent study found that M cell ablation leads to increased SFB levels ( Nagashima et al., 2017 63. Nagashima, K. ∙ Sawa, S. ∙ Nitta, T. ... Identification of subepithelial mesenchymal cells that induce IgA and diversify gut microbiota Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :675-682 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). PP-associated SFB covering the FAE may protect from bacterial invasion. The size difference between SFB (up to 80 μm length) ( Ericsson et al., 2014 24. Ericsson, A.C. ∙ Hagan, C.E. ∙ Davis, D.J. ... Segmented filamentous bacteria: commensal microbes with potential effects on research Comp. Med. 2014; 64 :90-98 PubMed Google Scholar ) and Salmonella (1–2 μm length) ( Garland et al., 1982 29. Garland, C.D. ∙ Lee, A. ∙ Dickson, M.R. Segmented filamentous bacteria in the rodent small intestine: Their colonization of growing animals and possible role in host resistance to Salmonella Microb. Ecol. 1982; 8 :181-190 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggests that the dense lawn of SFB covering the FAE may physically hinder or create a microenvironment that prevents STm binding to M cells. SFB plays a major role in inducing T helper 17 (Th17) cells ( Atarashi et al., 2015; Gaboriau-Routhiau et al., 2009; Ivanov et al., 2009 3. Atarashi, K. ∙ Tanoue, T. ∙ Ando, M. ... Th17 Cell Induction by Adhesion of Microbes to Intestinal Epithelial Cells Cell. 2015; 163 :367-380 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (803) PubMed Google Scholar 28.

Induction of intestinal Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria Cell. 2009; 139 :485-498 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3584) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not detect changes in Th17 cells following nociceptor ablation, but it is possible that other non-SFB microbes may compensate to induce Th17 cells ( Tan et al., 2016 81. Tan, T.G. ∙ Sefik, E. ∙ Geva-Zatorsky, N. ... Identifying species of symbiont bacteria from the human gut that, alone, can induce intestinal Th17 cells in mice Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E8141-E8150 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future work will determine whether Th17 responses are regulated by nociceptors.
We found that nociceptors released CGRP upon Salmonella infection and that this neuropeptide modulated M cell density and STm host defense. CGRP has pleiotropic effects on host physiology including regulation of vascular flow, immune cell function, and inflammation in mouse models of colitis ( Engel et al., 2012; Russell et al., 2014 23. Engel, M.A. ∙ Khalil, M. ∙ Siklosi, N. ... Opposite effects of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in oxazolone colitis Dig. Liver Dis. 2012; 44 :24-29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Russell, F.A. ∙ King, R. ∙ Smillie, S.J. ... Calcitonin gene-related peptide: physiology and pathophysiology Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94 :1099-1142 Crossref Scopus (849) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanism by which CGRP regulates M cell density remains to be defined. One possibility is that CGRP regulates RANKL signaling, which is critical for M cell differentiation ( Knoop et al., 2009 45. Knoop, K.A. ∙ Kumar, N. ∙ Butler, B.R. ... RANKL is necessary and sufficient to initiate development of antigen-sampling M cells in the intestinal epithelium J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :5738-5747 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). CGRP suppresses RANKL signaling in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption ( Wang et al., 2010 87. Wang, L. ∙ Shi, X. ∙ Zhao, R. ... Calcitonin-gene-related peptide stimulates stromal cell osteogenic differentiation and inhibits RANKL induced NF-kappaB activation, osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption Bone. 2010; 46 :1369-1379 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that CGRP and its receptors are being targeted in chronic migraine treatment, it would be important to ascertain the long-term consequences on host defense.
Our finding that nociceptors regulate M cells has wider implications beyond Salmonella host defense. M cells are vital sentinel cells that initiate mucosal immunity by trafficking luminal antigens to PP antigen-presenting cells ( Miller et al., 2007; Williams and Owen, 2015 59. Miller, H. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Kuolee, R. ... Intestinal M cells: the fallible sentinels? World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13 :1477-1486 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar 89. Williams, I.R. ∙ Owen, R.L. M Cells Specialized Antigen Sampling Cells in the Follicle-Associated Epithelium Mestecky, J. ∙ Russell, M.W. ∙ Cheroutre, H. ... (Editors) Mucosal Immunology Academic Press, 2015; 211-229 Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar ). It would be interesting to determine if nociceptors regulate M cell-dependent processes including germinal center formation, oral tolerance induction, and antibody production. Nociceptor regulation of M cells may protect against other M cell-invading pathogens including Shigella , E. coli , and Yersinia ( Sansonetti and Phalipon, 1999 72. Sansonetti, P.J. ∙ Phalipon, A. M cells as ports of entry for enteroinvasive pathogens: mechanisms of interaction, consequences for the disease process Semin. Immunol. 1999; 11 :193-203 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prions invade M cells and may subsequently spread via PP-innervating nerves from gut to brain ( Chiocchetti et al., 2008 14. Chiocchetti, R. ∙ Mazzuoli, G. ∙ Albanese, V. ... Anatomical evidence for ileal Peyer’s patches innervation by enteric nervous system: a potential route for prion neuroinvasion? Cell Tissue Res. 2008; 332 :185-194 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the relationship of nociceptors and M cells in host-pathogen interactions and mucosal immunity is a rich area for future research.
Neuro-immune regulation of gut inflammation is an active area of research. Different branches of the peripheral nervous system crosstalk with gut epithelial and immune cells to regulate tissue homeostasis and immunity. Enteric neurons modulate innate lymphoid cells via neuromedin U to impact type 2 immunity and helminth infections ( Cardoso et al., 2017; Klose et al., 2017 13. Cardoso, V. ∙ Chesné, J. ∙ Ribeiro, H. ... Neuronal regulation of type 2 innate lymphoid cells via neuromedin U Nature. 2017; 549 :277-281 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar 44.

The neuropeptide neuromedin U stimulates innate lymphoid cells and type 2 inflammation Nature. 2017; 549 :282-286 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cholinergic neurons signal to gut epithelial cells to drive antimicrobial gene expression during S. aureus infections of C. elegans ( Labed et al., 2018 48. Labed, S.A. ∙ Wani, K.A. ∙ Jagadeesan, S. ... Intestinal Epithelial Wnt Signaling Mediates Acetylcholine-Triggered Host Defense against Infection Immunity. 2018; 48 :963-978.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sympathetic neurons polarize muscularis macrophages toward a tissue-protective phenotype at homeostasis and during STm infection ( Gabanyi et al., 2016 27. Gabanyi, I. ∙ Muller, P.A. ∙ Feighery, L. ... Neuro-immune Interactions Drive Tissue Programming in Intestinal Macrophages Cell. 2016; 164 :378-391 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (448) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our study expands the role of the nervous system in host defense by showing that gut-innervating nociceptor neurons modulate several layers of GI physiology including regulation of PP M cells, small intestine microbial communities, and defense against the enteric pathogen STm. Manipulation of neurons and their mediators could be a target for therapies to treat inflammatory and infectious diseases.

Surana (Duke University). For Nav1.8-lineage neuron depletion experiments, Nav1.8-Cre +/− mice were bred with Rosa26-stop(flox)-DTA +/+ mice to generate Nav1.8-lineage neuron-depleted mice ( Nav1.8-Cre/DTA or Cre+) mice and control (Cre-) littermates. For M cell depletion experiments, Villin-Cre +/− ;RANK fl/fl were bred to RANK fl/fl mice to generate mice with epithelial-specific depletion of RANK in Villin-Cre +/− ;RANK fl/fl ( RANK ΔIEC ) or control ( RANK fl/fl ) littermates. Nav1.8-Cre +/+ mice were bred with B6.Rosa26-stop(flox)-TdTomato +/+ mice to generate Nav1.8-Cre/TdTomato mice. For Calca and Calcb experiments, heterozygous mice were bred together to produce wild-type and knockout littermates. Mice were bred and housed in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Age-matched 7 to 14 week old littermate mice of both genders were used for experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the HMS Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee.
The wild-type Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) strain SL1344 (streptomycin-resistant) was provided by M. Starnbach (HMS). SL1344 ΔFimH was provided by E. Sokurenko (University of Washington). SL1344 wild-type strain was grown in LB broth and ΔFimH mutant strain was grown in LB broth with 25 ug/mL kanamycin. For infection studies, bacteria were grown overnight for 16-18 hr at 37°C on a shaker, 250 rpm in LB broth supplemented with antibiotics when appropriate. Bacteria were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, washed twice, and resuspended in sterile PBS. The OD600 was measured to estimate bacterial density, and serial plating was performed on LB agar plates to quantify the infection dose by counting colony forming units (CFU) after an overnight incubation at 37°C.
In murine typhoid-like infection models, mice were fasted overnight in clean cages with unlimited access to water. On the morning of infection, mice were gavaged with 100 ul of 3% sodium bicarbonate, followed 30 min later by 200 ul of STm resuspended in PBS at indicated doses (see Experimental cohorts and sample size details) . In some experiments, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 200 ul of STm in PBS for systemic infections. To evaluate STm load, mice were euthanized with CO 2 and tissues were rapidly dissected. Tissues were transferred into 2 mL eppendorf tubes containing ice-cold PBS and a 5 mm steel bead. Tissues were weighed, homogenized in a TissueLyzer (QIAGEN) for 2-4 min at 30 Hz, then serially diluted in PBS for plating. Mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches, spleens and livers were plated on LB agar. Ileum (distal 5 cm without Peyer’s patches) and cecum were plated on LB agar with 50 ug/mL streptomycin. Additionally, Peyer’s patches were treated with 100 uM gentamicin for 1 hr at 37°C to remove extracellular bacteria, washed twice with PBS before homogenizing and plating. STm CFU were counted after an overnight incubation at 37°C.
For systemic and vagal-targeted ablation of TRPV1 neurons, Trpv1-DTR mice were treated with diphtheria toxin (DTX) as previously described ( Baral et al., 2018; Pogorzala et al., 2013; Tränkner et al., 2014 4.

Population of sensory neurons essential for asthmatic hyperreactivity of inflamed airways Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :11515-11520 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). For systemic ablation, Trpv1-DTR mice were injected intraperitoneally with DTX (200 ng DTX from Sigma dissolved in 100 ul PBS) or vehicle (PBS) daily for 21 days. For vagal-targeted ablation, the nodose/jugular/petrosal vagal ganglia were exposed in Trpv1-DTR mice by a midline incision in the neck (1.5 cm in length) while mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Bilateral intraganglionic injections of DTX (20 ng in 120 nL PBS containing 0.05% Fast Green) or vehicle (PBS with 0.05% Fast Green) were performed using a nanoinjector (Drummond Scientific Company). Control mice were treated with vehicle alone. Mice were allowed to rest for at least 2 weeks before being used for experiments. For systemic ablation of TRPV1 neurons using Resiniferatoxin (RTX, Sigma), 4-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected subcutaneously in the flank with escalating doses of RTX (30, 70, 100 ug/kg on consecutive days) or vehicle (2% DMSO / 0.15% Tween-80 / PBS) while under isoflurane anesthesia as previously described ( Elekes et al., 2007; Szolcsanyi et al., 1990 22.

Control mice were treated with vehicle alone. Mice were allowed to rest for 4 weeks before being used for experiments. Loss of TRPV1+ neurons in the DRG and vagal ganglia was confirmed by immunostaining, or by reduced thermal responses to noxious heat during hot plate tests (55°C).
For immunostaining of extrinsic ganglia, mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA / PBS. Lumbar DRG (L1-L6) and vagal ganglia were dissected, post-fixed for 2 hr in 4% PFA / PBS at 4°C, incubated overnight at 4°C in 30% sucrose / PBS, and embedded in OCT. Sections (14 um) were cut, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) / 0.3% Triton X-100 / PBS (PBST) for 2 hr at RT, and stained with primary antibodies (guinea-pig anti-TRPV1, Millipore AB5566, 1:500; rabbit anti-CGRP, Millipore PC205L, 1:500; chicken anti-Neurofilament 200, Millipore AB5539, 1:500; rabbit anti-Tuj1, Abcam ab18207, 1:1,000) diluted in 2% NDS / PBST overnight at 4°C. Sections were washed in PBST, then stained with secondary antibodies (goat anti-guinea pig Alexa488, Sigma SAB4600040, 1:500; donkey anti-rabbit DyLight488, Abcam ab98488, 1:500; goat anti-chicken Alexa488, Invitrogen A-11039, 1:1000; donkey anti-rabbit Alexa594, Abcam ab150076, 1:500) diluted in 2% NDS / PBST for 2 hr at RT. After washing with PBS, sections were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Labs), and imaged by an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope with 10X magnification at HMS Microscopy Resources on the North Quad (MicRoN) Core. Maximum projection images obtained for each channel were exported for analysis. For quantification of extrinsic ganglia neurons, the % of TRPV1+, CGRP+, or NF200+ neurons out of the total Tuj1+ neurons was determined for each sample as an average of 3 fields per mouse. Investigators were blinded to genotypes and treatment groups.
Immunostaining was performed as previously described ( Rao et al., 2015 68. Rao, M. ∙ Nelms, B.D. ∙ Dong, L. ... Enteric glia express proteolipid protein 1 and are a transcriptionally unique population of glia in the mammalian nervous system Glia. 2015; 63 :2040-2057 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ileums, excised of mesentery, were immersed in 1 uM nicardipine hydrochloride on ice for 20 min to maximize smooth muscle relaxation. Then intestines were flushed with PBS, opened longitudinally, stretched out, and fixed flat in 4% PFA / PBS for 2 hr on ice. In some instances, longitudinal muscle layers and associated myenteric plexus were separated from the mucosa/submucosa. Tissues were washed in PBS, permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 / PBS for 2 hr at RT, blocked in 10% normal donkey serum / 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS for 2 hr at RT, then incubated in primary antibodies (rabbit anti-HuD, Abcam ab184267, 1:2000; goat anti-Calretinin, Swant CG1, 1:100; goat anti-nNOS, Abcam ab1376, 1:100; rabbit anti-CGRP, Millipore PC205L, 1:500) diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C with gentle shaking. Following PBS rinses, samples were incubated in succession in secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit Alexa594, Abcam ab150076; donkey anti-goat Alexa488, Abcam ab150129; donkey anti-rabbit DyLight488, Abcam ab98488) diluted in blocking buffer for 2 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C. Tissues were washed in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS, then in PBS, and mounted in Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences, 18606-20; all at 1:500). Z stacks (0.9um intervals) were acquired on a Nikon Ti inverted spinning disk confocal microscope with a 20X magnification using NIS Elements Acquisition Software AR 5.02 at HMS MicRoN Core. For quantification of myenteric plexus neuron populations, >800 neurons over >5 images were counted per mouse. The total HuD+ neurons, % of calretinin+, nNOS+, CGRP+ neurons out of HuD+ neurons were calculated per mouse. Investigators were blinded to genotypes and treatment groups.
Whole DRG, vagal ganglia, myenteric plexus/longitudinal muscle from ileum and colon, PPs, and epithelial organoids were homogenized in Trizol reagent and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was isolated by addition of chloroform to homogenates and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was combined with equal parts of 70% ethanol and RNA was purified using a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Equal amounts of RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad). Relative gene expression was determined using gene-specific primers (see Table S1 ) ( Nagashima et al., 2017; Wansleeben et al., 2014; Kanaya et al., 2012; D’Autréaux et al., 2007 19.

Expression levels were normalized to Gapdh or 18S using the ΔCt method or ΔΔCt relative to control groups.
To analyze bacterial community structure, genomic DNA was extracted from luminal contents, mucosal scrapings, or feces. To obtain luminal contents, 5 cm of proximal duodenums, 5 cm of distal ileums, or entire colons were flushed with PBS (0.5 mL PBS/cm segment) and contents were frozen at −20°C until use. To obtain mucosal scrapings, flushed tissue segments were opened longitudinally on a sterile Petri dish, and the mucosa and associated bacteria were scraped and frozen at −20°C in 0.5 mL PBS. Freshly collected fecal pellets were frozen at −20°C until use. Upon thawing, genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Samples were normalized to the same concentration (8 ng/ul), amplified (40 ng per reaction, 35 cycles), and barcoded in triplicate PCR reactions using 5Prime HotMaster Mix (QuantaBio). The published 515F/806R Golay-barcoded primer pair with Illumina adapters were used to amplify the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene ( Caporaso et al., 2012 12. Caporaso, J.G. ∙ Lauber, C.L. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis on the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms ISME J. 2012; 6 :1621-1624 Crossref Scopus (6375) PubMed Google Scholar ). Barcoded triplicate reactions were combined and a 300-350 bp amplicon for each sample was confirmed by running on a DNA agarose gel. Then, 300 ng of each sample was pooled, purified using QIAquick DNA purification column, and sequenced using 250 bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq (Illumina). A mean sequence depth of 10,635 counts/sample was obtained. Paired-reads were merged, quality trimmed, and clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence similarity. Taxonomy was assigned using the RDP database version 11.5 ( Cole et al., 2014 17. Cole, J.R. ∙ Wang, Q. ∙ Fish, J.A. ... Ribosomal Database Project: data and tools for high throughput rRNA analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D633-D642 Crossref Scopus (3143) PubMed Google Scholar ). To estimate within-sample richness, alpha-diversity was determined using Chao1 estimates. To evaluate differences in diversity across samples, beta-diversity was determined using unweighted UniFrac distances. The relatedness of community diversity between pairs of samples was represented through principal coordinates analysis using QIIME software package ( Kuczynski et al., 2011 47. Kuczynski, J. ∙ Stombaugh, J. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Using QIIME to analyze 16S rRNA gene sequences from microbial communities Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2011; 36 :10.7.1-10.7.20 Crossref Scopus (524) Google Scholar ). Differences in relative abundance at different taxonomic levels were determined using ANOVA with a false discovery rate of 5% or Mann-Whitney tests.
For microbiota transplantation by oral gavage, fecal pellets were collected from SFB-monocolonized or Bacteroides fragilis -monocolonized germ-free mice (provided by J. Huh) and frozen at −80°C until use. Alternatively, freshly collected feces were homogenized as described below and used immediately for gavage. Fresh or frozen feces were homogenized in sterile water (vehicle) and passed through a 70 um strainer to remove solid debris. Mice were gavaged with 200-300 ul of cleared fecal supernatants, which corresponded to 1-2 fecal pellets per recipient mouse, twice in one day separated by 8 hr. Mice were rested for 5-10 days to allow transplanted fecal microbiota to colonize before being used for infection experiments ( Farkas et al., 2015 25. Farkas, A.M. ∙ Panea, C. ∙ Goto, Y. ... Induction of Th17 cells by segmented filamentous bacteria in the murine intestine J. Immunol. Methods. 2015; 421 :104-111 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). In certain experiments, mice were gavaged with their own feces, Bacteroides fragilis -monocolonized feces, germ-free feces, or vehicle (water) as non-SFB controls for fecal transplantation. Transplantation was confirmed by qPCR of ileum mucosa or feces samples.
To quantify relative levels of specific bacteria by qPCR, genomic DNA was extracted from mucosal scrapings, flushed lumenal contents, or feces using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. To obtain ileum lumen samples, the distal 10 cm of the ileum was flushed with 3 mL sterile PBS into an eppendorf, centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min, 4°C. Supernatant was discarded and pellets were resuspended in 1.0 mL InhibitEX Buffer (QIAGEN) and frozen at −20°C until use. To obtain ileum mucosal scrapings, flushed ileum segments were opened longitudinally on a sterile Petri dish, then mucosa and associated bacteria were scraped and frozen in 1.0 mL InhibitEX Buffer. To separate PP and villi-associated mucosa, 0.5 cm segments of PPs and surrounding tissues were excised from flushed ileum tissues, opened longitudinally on a sterile Petri dish, and the mucosa from the tops of PP domes were scraped and frozen in 1.0 mL of InhibitEX Buffer. The remaining villi segments of flushed ileums were opened longitudinally, and villi-associated mucosa were scraped and frozen in 1.0 mL of InhibitEX Buffer. For feces, 1-2 freshly collected fecal pellets were frozen at −20°C until use. Upon thawing, mucosal scrapings, luminal contents, and feces were homogenized in a 2 mL eppendorf containing 400 ul of 0.5 mm glass acid-washed beads (Sigma) and up to 1.4 mL of InhibitEX buffer. Samples were heated at 90°C for 1 hour with vigorous vortexing, then centrifuged at 20,000 g for 3 min. After spinning, 600 ul of supernatant was combined with 600 ul Buffer AL (QIAGEN) and 25 ul Proteinase K (QIAGEN), then heated for 70°C for 20 min. After heating, 600 ul ethanol was added to each sample, then samples were applied to columns, washed with 600 ul Buffer AW1 and 600 ul Buffer AW2 (QIAGEN) in sequential steps, and eluted in 100 ul Buffer ATE (QIAGEN). qPCR was conducted on samples to determine the relative amount of SFB, Bacteroides fragilis , and total Eubacteria using published bacteria-specific primer sequences ( Barman et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2003 5. Barman, M. ∙ Unold, D. ∙ Shifley, K. ... Enteric salmonellosis disrupts the microbial ecology of the murine gastrointestinal tract Infect.

Expression levels were normalized to 16S using the ΔCt method.
1 cm segments of ileum tissues containing PPs were dissected from mice, then gently washed twice in 5% FBS / 10 mM DTT / 0.05% Tween-20 / 1 uM nicardipine / HBSS to remove mucus and maximize smooth muscle relaxation. Tissues were opened longitudinally, stretched out, and fixed overnight in cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde / 2.5% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc). The fixed tissues were washed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 hr. Tissues were then rinsed in ddH 2 0 and dehydrated through an ethanol series (30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, 100% twice) for 15 min per solution. Dehydrated tissues were dried in an Autosamdri-815 (Tousimis) critical point dryer and mounted on aluminum stages with silver paint and coated with 10 nm platinum. The dried tissues were observed in a Hitachi S-4700 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV at HMS Electron Microscopy Facility. For ligated-loop infections, mice were fasted overnight, anesthetized during surgery, and kept on a heating pad during the experiment. A lateral incision (3 cm) in the abdominal wall exposed the ileum and associated mesentery. Silk ligatures were tied around a single ileal PP and 1.5 cm surrounding tissue on either side of the PP. STm grown overnight was prepared as described in Bacterial strains and culture conditions , resuspended at 1 × 10 9 CFU/mL in PBS, and injected into ligated ileum loops (100-150 ul/cm intestine). After 30 min, mice were euthanized, then ligated-loops were excised and processed for SEM.
For whole-mount staining of PP innervation, 1 cm segments of ileum tissues containing PPs were dissected, opened longitudinally, stretched out, and fixed for 1-2 hr on ice in Cytofix/Cytoperm Buffer (BD Biosciences). Tissues were washed in PBS for 10 min x 5 times, blocked in 10% normal donkey serum / 0.25% Triton X-100 / PBS for 2-4 hr at 4°C, then incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibodies (rat anti-GP2, MBL D278-3, 1:500; rabbit anti-Tuj1, Abcam ab18207, 1:1000; rabbit anti-CGRP, Millipore PC205L, 1:500) diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS in 24-well plates with gentle shaking. Tissues were washed in PBS for 20 min x 5 times, then incubated overnight at 4°C in secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rat Alexa594, Jackson ImmunoResearch 712-585-153, 1:500; donkey anti-rabbit Alexa488, Abcam ab98488, 1:500; Hoechst 33342, Thermo 66249, 1:10,000, final 2 ug/mL) diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS. Tissues were washed in PBS for 20 min x 5 times, then mounted in VectaShield (Vector Labs). Images of PP innervation were acquired as Z stacks (0.5 um interval) on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope with a 20X magnification at HMS MicRoN Core. For Calca-GFP-DTR mice, endogenous GFP was imaged. ImageJ was used to generate maximum projection and 3D images.
Immunostaining was performed as previously described ( Kanaya et al., 2012; Kobayashi et al., 2013 41. Kanaya, T. ∙ Hase, K. ∙ Takahashi, D. ...

The functional maturation of M cells is dramatically reduced in the Peyer’s patches of aged mice Mucosal Immunol. 2013; 6 :1027-1037 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). For whole-mount staining, 1 cm segments of duodenum, jejunum, or ileum tissues containing PPs were washed 5 times by pulse-vortexing in 5% FBS / 10 mM DTT / 0.05% Tween-20 / 1 uM nicardipine / HBSS to remove mucus and maximize smooth muscle relaxation. Tissues were opened longitudinally, stretched out, and fixed for 1-2 hr on ice in Cytofix/Cytoperm Buffer (BD Biosciences). Tissues were blocked in 10% normal goat serum or donkey serum / 0.25% Triton X-100 / PBS for 2-4 hr at 4°C, then incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibodies (rat anti-GP2, MBL D278-3, 1:500; sheep anti-SpiB, R&D Systems AF7204, 1:50) diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS in 96-well plates with gentle shaking. Tissues were washed for 20 min x 5 times in PBS, then incubated in secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat Alexa488, Abcam ab150157, 1:500; donkey anti-rat Alexa594, Jackson ImmunoResearch 712-585-153, 1:500; donkey anti-sheep Alexa488, Abcam ab150177, 1:500; Hoechst 33342, Thermo 66249, 1:10,000, final 2 ug/mL) diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 / PBS for 2 hr at 4°C. Tissues were washed again, then mounted in VectaShield (Vector Labs). Images of PP FAE were acquired as Z stacks (3 um interval) on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope with a 10X magnification at HMS MicRoN Core. To calculate M cell density, maximum projection images were compiled in ImageJ. The follicle area encircled by surrounding villi was traced using the lasso tool in Adobe Photoshop after setting a threshold for nuclei stained by Hoechst. The follicle area region of interests (ROI) were imported into ImageJ, and an automated Otsu threshold for GP2 and SpiB channels was applied. The follicle area (um 2 ) and % of follicle area stained by GP2+ or SpiB+ cells were quantified in ImageJ. Data are plotted as GP2 density per individual follicle, or GP2 density of 3-6 follicles averaged per mouse. Investigators were blinded to genotypes and treatment groups during imaging and analysis.
For microfold cell depletion, we followed an established protocol ( Knoop et al., 2009 45. Knoop, K.A. ∙ Kumar, N. ∙ Butler, B.R. ... RANKL is necessary and sufficient to initiate development of antigen-sampling M cells in the intestinal epithelium J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :5738-5747 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were injected i.p. with 250 ug of anti-RANKL (clone IL22/5, BioXcell) diluted in saline every 2 days. Control mice received 250 ug of IgG2a isotype control (clone 2A3, BioXcell) diluted in saline. Depletion of microfold cells was confirmed by immunostaining of ileal PP FAE.
Ileum PPs were excised and washed with 5 mM DTT / 0.05% Tween-20 / HBSS to remove mucus. To isolate PP-associated epithelia, PPs were incubated in 1 mM DTT / 2 mM EDTA / HBSS with shaking at 250 rpm for 20 min at 37°C. Supernatant containing epithelial cells were collected through a 70 um strainer, centrifuged and washed. PPs were then digested by shaking at 250 rpm for 45-60 min at 37°C in 1 mg/mL Collagenase D (Roche) / 2 mg/mL Dispase II (Roche) / 100 U/mL DNase I (Life Technologies) / 5% FBS / RPMI. Every 15 min, tissues were pipetted to facilitate dissociation, supernatant was removed, and tissues were re-incubated with fresh pre-warmed digestion media. Pooled cells were passed through a 70 um strainer to collect single cell suspensions, centrifuged, and washed in 5% FBS / RPMI.
To clean ileum tissues (distal 10 cm), the PPs, mesentery, and fat were excised, then ileums were flushed, opened longitudinally, and cut into 1” segments. Tissues were shaken at 250 rpm for 20 min at 37°C in 2 mM EDTA / 1 mM DTT / 5% FBS / RPMI to isolate epithelial cells and intraepithelial leukocytes. Tissues were vortexed and passed through a 70 um strainer to collect single cell suspensions of epithelial cells and intraepithelial leukocytes. The isolation step was repeated, and pooled cells were centrifuged and washed in 5% FBS / RPMI.
After removal of epithelial cells, ileum lamina propria were rinsed in 5% FBS / RPMI and minced before further digestion. Minced ileum tissues were digested by shaking at 250-500 rpm for 40-60 min at 37°C in 1 mg/mL Collagenase D (Roche) / 2 mg/mL Dispase II (Roche) / 100 U/mL DNase I (Life Technologies) / 5% FBS / RPMI. For myeloid cell analysis from ileum lamina propria, tissues were digested by shaking at 250-500 rpm for 15 min at 37°C in 1.5 mg/mL Collagenase VIII (Sigma) / 2 mg/mL Dispase I (Life Technologies) / 40 ug/mL DNase I (Life Technologies) / 5% FBS / RPMI.

Ileum epithelial cells were isolated from uninfected and STm 2 dpi infected mice as described in Preparation of epithelial cells and intraepithelial leukocytes . Cells were transferred to eppendorfs, washed twice, resuspended in 1 mL Trizol, and frozen at −80°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted by chloroform as described in Quantitative RT-PCR and using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies). RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing by Illumina NextSeq was conducted by the HMS Biopolymers Genomic Facility.
In the morning without fasting, mice were gavaged with 200 mg/kg of fluorescein sulfonic acid (478 Da, Thermo Fisher Scientific) dissolved in PBS as previously described ( Rao et al., 2017 69. Rao, M. ∙ Rastelli, D. ∙ Dong, L. ...

After 4 hr, blood was obtained by cardiac puncture, centrifuged at 2,500 g for 15 min, and serum fluorescence was measured in a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek) at ex/em 490/520 nm.
Fecal pellets were collected into a 2 mL eppendorf, diluted 1:10 w/v with 1 mM EDTA / PBS, homogenized with a single 5 mm steel bead in a TissueLyzer (QIAGEN) at 30 Hz for 3 min. Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and supernatants collected for ELISA. NUNC Maxisorp 96-well plates (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were coated with goat anti-mouse IgA-Biotin (Biolegend) and washed with 0.05% Tween / PBS. Plates were blocked with 5% milk powder / PBS and washed. Experimental samples and standards of mouse IgA were added for 1 hr at RT. All samples were run in duplicate and were serially diluted. Plates were washed and incubated with goat IgG anti-mouse IgA-HRP (Biolegend). Plates were washed and developed in the dark using TMB substrate, then 0.18 M sulfuric acid was used to stop the reaction. Plates were read using a Synergy microplate reader (BioTek) at 450 nm. Fecal IgA values were quantified by comparing to standards fit to a linear regression model.
Mice were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation, and DRGs were dissected and dissociated as previously described ( Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018 66. Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ∙ Baddal, B. ∙ Haarsma, R. ... Blocking neuronal signaling to immune cells treats streptococcal invasive infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). DRG neurons were plated on laminin pre-coated 35 mm culture dishes (2,000 cells per dish) in 50 ng/mL nerve growth factor / neurobasal media (Thermo Fisher), and used for calcium imaging 12-24 hr after plating. For calcium imaging, cells were loaded with 5 mM Fura-2-AM / neurobasal media (Thermo Fisher) at 37°C for 30 min, washed twice, and imaged in 2 mL Krebs-Ringer solution (Boston Bioproducts). STm was cultured overnight as described in Bacterial strains and culture conditions , washed twice, resuspended in Krebs-Ringer solution (vehicle), and bath-applied at 1 × 10 9 CFU/mL. After 200 ul of STm or vehicle stimulation, 1 uM capsaicin (Tocris) and 40 mM KCl (Sigma) was applied sequentially to identify TRPV1 and live neurons respectively. Images were acquired with alternating 340/380 nm excitation wavelengths, and fluorescence emission was captured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope and Zyla sCMOS camera. Ratiometric analysis of 340/380 signal intensities were processed, background corrected, and analyzed with NIS-elements software (Nikon) by drawing regions of interest (ROI) around individual cells. The percentage of STm-responsive cells with an increase in 340/380 ratio greater than 10% from 3 separate fields per condition was quantified and plotted as a proportion of TRPV1+ (capsaicin-responsive) or total (KCl-responsive) neurons.
For CGRP release from DRG neuronal cultures, DRG neurons were dissected and cultured in 96-wells (5,000 cells per well) as previously described ( Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018 66. Pinho-Ribeiro, F.A. ∙ Baddal, B. ∙ Haarsma, R. ... Blocking neuronal signaling to immune cells treats streptococcal invasive infection Cell. 2018; 173 :1083-1097.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), and used in CGRP release assays 1 week after plating. One group of neurons was treated with 25 pg of Botulinum neurotoxin A (BTx) for 24 hr prior to neuronal stimulation. The neuronal culture medium was removed from all wells, and 200 ul of fresh neurobasal media was added to the wells. DRG neurons were stimulated with 50 ul of live, heat-killed, filtered supernatant from STm cultures, media control (neurobasal media), or 1uM capsaicin. Live STm and filtered supernatants were prepared on the day of the experiment. STm were heat-killed by exposure to 90°C heat for 10 min. DRG neurons were stimulated for 1 hr at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , then 50 ul of supernatant were collected to determine CGRP concentration using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For CGRP release from ileum explants, mice were infected with STm and euthanized at the indicated time points after infection. Distal portions of the ileum (5 cm) were dissected and transferred to 24-well plates containing 500 ul DMEM. Explants were incubated at 32°C with gentle shaking at 150 rpm for 60 min. Organ bath solution was collected and stored at −20°C. CGRP concentration was determined using a CGRP EIA Kit (Cayman Chemical).
Murine small intestinal crypts were isolated and cultured as previously described ( de Lau et al., 2012; Sato et al., 2009 20. de Lau, W. ∙ Kujala, P. ∙ Schneeberger, K. ...

Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche Nature. 2009; 459 :262-265 Crossref Scopus (5050) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, ileums were flushed, opened longitudinally and cut into 2-4 mm segments. Tissues were incubated in 2 mM EDTA / PBS for 30 min on ice, pipetted, then washed to release crypts into the supernatant. Supernatant was passed through a 70 um strainer and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min. Crypts were grown in Matrigel (Corning) in 24-well plates with Advanced DMEM / F12 cell culture media (Life Technologies) supplemented with growth factors including EGF (50 ng/mL, Life Technologies), Noggin (100 ng/mL, PeproTech), and R-spondin-1 conditioned media (supplied by Harvard Digestive Diseases Center Gastrointestinal Organoid Culture Core). For stimulation of organoids, RANKL (200 ng/mL, Biolegend) was added to wells either alone or with CGRP (1, 10, 100 nM, GenScript) and incubated for 72 hr. Fresh media, RANKL, and CGRP was replaced at 48 hr. To harvest cells, organoids were placed in Cell Recovery Solution (Corning) for 30 min prior to washing and resuspending in Trizol, then stored at −80°C prior to RNA extraction.
For heat-map gene expression profiles of single-cell RNA-seq data of the mouse nervous system, we analyzed published data by Zeisel et al. Cell 2018 and available at http://mousebrain.org/genesearch.html . DRG neuron clusters were originally designated as PSPEP1-8, PSNF1-3, PSNP1-6; and enteric neuron subsets as ENT1-9 by Zeisel et al. Average transcript levels of Scn10a, Trpv1, Ntrk1, Calca, Calcb, Calb2, Hand2, and Phox2b across these neuronal datasets were hierarchically clustered by Pearson correlation, average linkage, and plotted as a relative heat-map using Morpheus ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/ ). For violin plot gene expression profiles of single-cell RNA-seq data of colonic DRG neurons identified by tracing (published by Hockley et al., 2018), we plotted transcript levels of Trpv1 , Scn10a , Calca , and Calcb using their analysis software ( https://hockley.shinyapps.io/ColonicRNAseq ). DRG neuron clusters were designated as mNP, mNFa-b, mPEPa-b, pNK, and pNEP by Hockley et al.
Sample sizes for all experiments were chosen according to standard practice in the field. Statistical parameters including numbers, averages, deviation, and statistical tests are reported in the figures and corresponding legends. Data are represented as mean ± standard error (SEM) throughout the figures. Statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism.
Here, we supply details about infection doses and numbers of biological and experimental replicates for each experiment.
