        <div role="paragraph">The current guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American Stroke
            Association (AHA–ASA) recommend “intense” statin therapy after an ischemic stroke of atherosclerotic
            origin but do not stipulate a target level of LDL cholesterol because there are limited data on
            outcomes with different targets for LDL cholesterol.<sup><a href="#core-r1" role="doc-biblioref"

            Although physicians typically prescribe high-intensity
            statin therapy after stroke as recommended, most patients are later prescribed a low or moderate
            statin dose and have only a moderate reduction in the level of LDL cholesterol. For example, in a
            multicenter, multinational registry (TIAregistry.org) that enrolled patients with TIA or minor
            ischemic stroke who were followed in TIA clinics during a 5-year period, 70% of the patients had
            been prescribed a statin at the time of hospital discharge, and 63% were still taking a statin at 5
            years. Among these patients, the mean (±SD) LDL cholesterol level went from 119±41 mg per deciliter
            (3.1±1.1 mmol per liter) at baseline to 92±32 mg per deciliter (2.4±0.8 mmol per liter) at 5

        <div role="paragraph">In the Treat Stroke to Target trial, we tested the hypothesis that a target
            level of LDL cholesterol of less than 70 mg per deciliter would be superior to a target range of 90
            mg to 110 mg per deciliter (2.3 to 2.8 mmol per liter) in reducing overall cardiovascular events
            after an ischemic stroke or a TIA in patients with evidence of atherosclerosis.</div>

                <h3>Patients</h3>
                <div role="paragraph">From March 2010 through December 2018, a total of 2873 patients underwent
                    randomization at the 77 trial sites. Of these patients, 2860 met the inclusion criteria and were
                    included in the primary analysis; 13 patients were excluded because they did not provide written
                    informed consent for participation (Fig. S1 in the <a href="#ap2">Supplementary Appendix</a>).
                </div>
                <div role="paragraph">As a result of slow enrollment, the steering committee extended the
                    enrollment period to allow recruitment until December 31, 2018. All the patients were followed
                    until the end of the trial, with 1-year follow-up planned for the last patient to be enrolled
                    (until December 31, 2019). Patients were followed for incident cardiovascular events until May
                    26, 2019, when the trial was stopped by the sponsor due to lack of funding, and all the patients
                    were followed for adverse events through the last visit. This report includes all the
                    cardiovascular events that occurred up to May 26, 2019.</div>
                <div role="paragraph">The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two
                    groups (<a href="#t1">Table 1</a>). The mean LDL cholesterol level was 135 mg per deciliter (3.5
                    mmol per liter) in each group. The median follow-up was 3.5 years (interquartile range, 2.0 to
                    6.7) in the lower-target group and 3.6 years (interquartile range, 2.0 to 6.7) in the
                    higher-target group. The median follow-up according to country trial site was 5.3 years
                    (interquartile range, 2.9 to 7.2) in France and 2.0 years (interquartile range, 0.5 to 2.9) in
                    South Korea. (The characteristics of French and Korean patients at baseline are provided in
                    Table S1.)</div>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <div role="paragraph">In our trial involving patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA and
                evidence of atherosclerotic disease, those who were assigned to a target LDL cholesterol level of
                less than 70 mg per deciliter had fewer major cardiovascular events than those assigned to a
                target range of 90 mg to 110 mg per deciliter. The lowering of the LDL cholesterol level was
                accomplished by adjustment of the statin dose, with the addition of ezetimibe in 33.8% of the
                patients. In addition to monitoring LDL cholesterol levels, investigators encouraged the targeted
                treatment of blood pressure and diabetes, along with smoking cessation, with favorable results
                (Figs. S2, S3, and S4).</div>
            <div role="paragraph">According to data in TIAregistry.org, after atherothrombotic ischemic stroke
                or TIA, the mean LDL cholesterol level was 92 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter), and patients
                who were included in the registry had a 13% risk of a major cardiovascular event at 5 years,
                despite being treated to reduce cholesterol levels according to the guidelines.<sup><a href="#core-r5"

                        aria-label="Reference 5">5</a></sup> The results of our trial suggest
                that a target LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg per deciliter could provide a further risk
                reduction.</div>
            <div role="paragraph">In our trial, which included French and Korean patients, we found no
                heterogeneity in the results between these national groups. The average time that patients spent
                in the assigned therapeutic range of LDL cholesterol was similar in the two groups (53.4% and
                50.8%, respectively). Patients in South Korea were recruited later in the trial than French
                patients, with a median follow-up of 2.0 years, as compared with 5.3 years among the French
                patients, which may have produced a lack of power to detect a significant effect in Korean
                patients. This factor makes it possible that the result of the trial in Korean patients is not
                generalizable to that population.</div>
            <div role="paragraph">Given the established relationship between LDL cholesterol levels and
                cardiovascular events,<sup><a href="#core-r13" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="r13" id="body-ref-r13"

                support the findings from meta-analyses of lipid-lowering trials suggesting that a lower level of
                LDL cholesterol is associated with better outcomes than higher LDL cholesterol targets.<sup><a

                    the 95% confidence interval for the hazard
                    ratio suggested that the between-group difference was not significant in our trial (<a
                        href="#t2">Table 2</a>). In addition, in the SPARCL trial, incident diabetes was 30% higher in
                    the group assigned to receive atorvastatin (80 mg per day) than in the placebo group,<sup><a
                            href="#core-r17" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="r17" id="body-ref-r17"
                            href-manipulated="true" aria-label="Reference 17">17</a></sup> whereas in our trial the
                    between-group difference in incident diabetes was not significant.</span></div>
            <div role="paragraph">Our results should be interpreted with consideration of the premature
                cessation of the trial. The goal was to reach 385 primary events, and 277 events had occurred when
                the sponsor stopped the trial early as a result of a shortage of funds after a median follow-up of
                3.5 years. Since an average of 30 primary end points occurred per year, at the time of trial
                cessation, it would have taken 3 additional years for the occurrence of 385 events. The extension
                of the trial by the sponsor allowed follow-up for every patient until the end of the trial rather
                than for 3 years, as initially planned. This allowed for the observed 277 events to provide a
                sufficient power to detect a 25% lower relative risk in the lower-target group, as hypothesized in
                the original trial design. Although adjudicators were unaware of LDL cholesterol targets and
                levels, the investigators and the technical and clinical research assistants were aware of the
                assigned targets. The secondary end points could not be formally tested because of the failure of
                the hierarchical analysis. The confidence intervals for hazard ratios comparing the two target
                groups, which were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, all included 1.00, which suggests that
                they may not be substantially different.</div>
            <div role="paragraph">In our trial involving patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA and with
                evidence of atherosclerotic disease, those who were assigned to a target LDL cholesterol level of
                less than 70 mg per deciliter with the use of statins and, if required, ezetimibe had a lower risk
                of a composite end point of major cardiovascular events than those who were assigned to a target
                range of 90 mg to 110 mg per deciliter.</div>
