            the results of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Level (SPARCL) trial
            that showed a 16% lower incidence of recurrent stroke with atorvastatin (at a dose of 80 mg per day)

            cholesterol of less than 70 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) had a 28% lower relative risk of
            stroke than those who reached a level of 100 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter).<sup><a href="#core-r4"
