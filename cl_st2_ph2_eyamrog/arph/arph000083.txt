Section: ABSTRACT

The United States relies primarily on market forces to determine prices for drugs, whereas most other industrialized countries use a variety of approaches to determine drug prices. Branded drug companies have patents and market exclusivity periods in most industrialized countries. During this period, pharmaceutical companies are allowed to set their list price as high as they prefer in the United States owing to the absence of government price control mechanisms that exist in other countries. Insured patients often pay a percentage of the list price, and cost sharing creates some pressure to lower the list price. Pharmacy benefit managers negotiate with drug companies for lower prices by offering the drug company favorable formulary placement and fewer utilization controls. However, these approaches appear to be less effective, compared with other countries’ approaches to containing branded drug prices, because prices are substantially higher in the United States. Other industrialized countries employ various forms of rate setting and price regulation, such as external reference pricing, therapeutic valuation, and health technology assessment to determine the appropriate price.

Section: COMPARING US DRUG PRICES WITH PRICES IN OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES

The discussion of comparative approaches to drug pricing must begin by comparing the magnitude of the prices in the United States with pricing in other industrialized countries. One reason the international comparison is important is to determine how much more individuals and health systems in the United States are paying for drugs compared with those residing in other industrialized countries. A second reason is that a common approach to drug pricing is called external reference pricing, and it uses the prices in several other countries to determine the prices that individuals in a country should pay. These countries often start with the prices paid in other countries and then make further adjustments to determine the price they will pay.
It is well known that individuals in the United States pay higher prices than those in other industrialized countries for most medical services, including pharmaceuticals ( 3 ). The prices for hospital stays, physician services, and pharmaceuticals in the United States are often more than double the prices paid in other industrialized countries ( 4 ). Exactly how much more patients and health systems in the United States pay for drugs compared with individuals in other countries depends on several factors, most notably which specific drugs are being compared; which countries are used for comparisons; how rebates are included; and whether additional adjustments are needed, such as an allowance for differences in per capita income ( 67 ).
Different studies have therefore found different price differentials between the United States and other industrialized countries. Over time, the price differentials seem to be getting larger, especially for branded and high-cost specialty drugs ( 15 ).
A 2019 study by Kang et al. ( 36 ) compared the prices for a market basket of 79 branded drugs in the United States to the prices paid in Ontario, Canada; Japan; and the United Kingdom. The study found that drug prices were, on average, 220–310% higher in the United States after rebates were included, and the price differential for specific drugs ranged from 30% to 6910% higher in the United States. The study also showed that the longer the branded drug remained on the market, the greater the price differential between the United States and these comparison countries. This widening of the price differential is because prices in the United States tend to go up following the drug launch, whereas prices in other countries tend to go down. Other industrialized countries have employed various mechanisms to control postlaunch drug prices, whereas the United States allows pharmaceutical companies to increase drug prices as much as they want based on the market situation throughout the drug life cycle. The study also showed that the other 3 countries had relatively similar prices for the totality of the 79 drugs in the market basket; in one country, the prices were higher for some drugs, but these differences were offset with lower prices for other drugs.
Earlier studies used different methodologies and generally found smaller price differentials. One reason is that the price differentials seemed to have increased over time (as noted above), and a second reason is that different methods can result in different price differentials. A 2000 paper by Danzon & Chao ( 22 ) used quasi-hedonic price indices to examine the price differentials of branded and generic drugs across seven industrialized countries. This study showed that price differentials across countries are due to differences in samples of drugs included in the analysis for the comparison and to how price indices were constructed. They compared both US quantity weighted-average prices and country-specific quantity weighted-average prices of drugs, including branded and generic drugs in seven industrialized countries including the United States. They found minimal price differentials between the United States and other industrialized countries. A 2003 paper by Danzon & Furukawa ( 23 ) compared prices in eight countries to prices in the United States and found higher prices in Japan and lower prices in the other seven countries. A more recent paper by Kanavos et al. ( 35 ) examined the price differentials of patent-protected branded drugs in seven countries using different indexing methods. This study found that adjusting the quantity of each drug used in each country had a significant impact on variation in drug price index by country because not all drugs are used in the same proportion in all countries. The study found that prices of branded drugs in the United States were 5–198% higher than the prices in other industrialized countries ( 35 ). The authors suggested that one potential benefit of paying the higher prices in the United States is that the drugs are more likely to be available first in the United States.
A number of recent studies in the United States have shown that the increase in drug spending is mostly due to rising prices of branded and specialty drugs and the introduction of some new specialty drugs with very high prices ( 62 ). In combination, these studies suggest that prices are increasing faster in the United States compared with in other industrialized countries, which could explain much of the growing difference between the older and the more recent studies of international price comparisons.
Policy makers have also begun to pay attention to the international price differentials. In 2018, US President Donald Trump's Council of Economic Advisers published a report showing that individuals in the United States pay much higher prices for drugs than do individuals in other countries and provide most of the profits for the drug companies ( 19 ). The Trump Administration has proposed using international prices to set prices for physician-administered drugs in the Medicare program ( 63 ). The proposal is to set the maximum Medicare payment amount based on a target international price index for physician-administered drugs.
In the next section, we compare the methods used in the United States to determine drug prices, and in the third section we explain the systems used in certain other industrialized countries. The fourth section examines the methods in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Section: UNITED STATES RELIES PRIMARILY ON MARKET FORCES TO DETERMINE DRUG PRICES

In this section, we discuss how drug companies set the prices for branded and generic drugs and the role of wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), pharmacies, and prescribers in influencing drug companies’ pricing decisions.
Branded drugs are responsible for most of the drug spending in the United States, while representing only a small portion of all the drugs prescribed ( 5 ). Branded drugs are given government-granted monopolies through patents and/or market exclusivity periods to protect the drug company's research and development investment. The manufacturing cost of branded drugs is small (often pennies per pill) compared with their research and development expense ( 40 , 43 ).
Therefore, if other companies could immediately produce the drug, the company that has conducted the research and development would be unable to recoup its research and development investment. However, in the United States, drug companies’ marketing expenditures are often even greater than their research and development expenditures ( 58 ). Although there could be a limited number of oligopoly competitors of drugs within the same therapeutic class that could provide competitive pressure to control prices, branded drug companies have complete autonomy to set their list price and use their government-given monopoly position for their specific drugs to determine the profit-maximizing price. As part of their pricing decision, drug companies must consider the patients' willingness to pay because patients’ cost sharing is often based on the list price. However, coupons and patient assistance programs can reduce or eliminate patient cost sharing ( 37 , 52 ).
Generic drugs are medications that have the same ingredients, dosage forms, strength, route of administration, and other clinical characteristics as branded drugs ( 65 ). Generic drugs can be sold only after the patents and market exclusivities of the branded drug expire. Therefore, unlike branded drugs, generic drugs do not have a government-granted monopoly. Generic drug companies determine their list price on the basis of the price of the branded drug they are copying and the generic drug market competition. Generic drugs have different cost functions from those of branded drugs—generic drug manufacturers incur minimal research and development costs and marketing costs—and operate within a different regulatory environment. Each generic drug manufacturer competes in a market with other generic drug manufacturers on the basis of price because each generic drug is a replica of the branded drug.
When there is competition among many generic drug companies selling the exact same drug, the price is driven down toward the cost of production ( 64 ). However, when only a limited number of generic drug companies are selling the same drug, the price remains closer to the branded drug price. In some cases, collusion may occur, which can drive up drug prices ( 25 , 40 , 53 ). In a small market, a company that produces a generic drug that treats a rare disease may obtain a monopoly position because no other generic drug company finds it profitable to enter the market, and therefore the generic company can set a very high price for generic drugs ( 40 ). One example is the high price that Martin Shkreli set for the drug Daraprim. The drug treated fewer than 5,000 people per year.
While the branded drug companies have the full discretion to set the list price, mechanisms in the drug supply chain can motivate drug companies to increase the list price. Figure 1 illustrates the flow of products and funds through the US pharmaceutical supply chain ( 34 ).

The process begins when wholesalers buy drugs directly from drug manufacturers and sell the drugs to pharmacies, hospitals, and physician offices, earning profit on the basis of the drug's list price (i.e., wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC). Wholesalers’ revenue is typically based on a certain percentage of the price of a branded drug ( 27 ). Therefore, holding other things equal, the higher a drug's list price, the higher the profit for wholesalers.
PBMs are the middlemen who administer drug benefits for health insurers and self-insured companies, negotiate the prices that will actually be paid, and determine how much reimbursement pharmacies will receive. PBMs originated in the 1960s to help insurance companies manage the newly introduced pharmacy benefits. Since then, the roles played by PBMs have been expanding. Beyond the traditional services such as formulary design, claim administration, and drug price negotiation, PBMs have been operating new services such as creating pharmacy networks, operating mail-order pharmacies, and performing disease management ( 7 ). The three largest PBMs currently control more than 80% of the market ( 7 ). PBMs play a vital role in the drug supply chain and have a significant role in determining the price that is actually paid for drugs by various payers. In 2018, more than one-third of employer-sponsored pharmacy benefits had three cost-sharing tiers, and more than half had four or more tiers in their formularies ( 14 ).
For branded drugs, PBMs use formulary tier placement and utilization control tools to affect a patient's demand for that drug, which gives them substantial negotiating power with drug companies, especially in therapeutic areas where different treatment options are available. Drug companies compete with each other to offer PBMs price concessions in the form of rebates and fees, generally based on drug price and volume, to obtain favorable formulary placement and/or less utilization control so that they can sell more of their drugs ( 57 ). PBMs pass on an unknown proportion of rebates and fees to patients, insurers, and self-insured companies and retain the rest for themselves as their profits. The ability to retain some rebates creates a strong incentive for PBMs to prefer high-list-price drugs with large rebates, which leads to the placement of some branded drugs on a better formulary tier than their cheaper generic alternatives ( 7 ). Recent evidence suggests that this issue is of limited concern for the Medicare Part D program ( 66 ).
Understanding PBMs’ preferences for rebates, which are based on the difference between the list price and the actual net price, branded drug companies keep increasing their list prices and paying higher rebates ( 7 ). There is considerable debate regarding how much the PBMs actually lower prices. However, as noted at the beginning of this article, payers in the United States pay much higher prices than do those in other countries, and the price differential has grown larger over time.
PBMs have less ability to profit by manipulating formulary placement across generic drug companies because all the generic versions of the same drug have the same active ingredient. PBMs profit from generic drugs primarily through spreading price, that is, receiving higher amounts from insurers (based on the drug's list price) but paying pharmacies lower amounts ( 1 , 8 ). This approach adds to the drug costs that patients and insurers pay.
Pharmacies dispense drugs to patients and receive out-of-pocket payments from patients and payments from health insurers (usually including a dispensing fee and reimbursement for the drug). Pharmacies pay wholesalers for the drugs they deliver ( 3 ). Hospitals purchase drugs through group purchase organizations (GPOs) and receive rebates from GPOs. GPOs have conflicts of interest similar to those of PBMs—making drugs available to hospitals and receiving payments from drug manufacturers in return ( 10 ). Hospitals usually bill patients and payers multiple times the price they pay for drugs ( 6 ).
Physicians deliver some medications, mostly commonly intravenous and injectable drugs, in their offices. They are generally reimbursed by the Medicare Part B program on the basis of the average sales price of the drug plus 6% (4.3% after the sequester) of the average sales price as an add-on to compensate them for their inventory storage and management expenditure (it remains undisclosed how private insurers reimburse physicians for these drugs). This reimbursement model creates incentive for physicians to prefer more expensive drugs, especially large-molecule biologics, drugs that are produced through biotechnology in a living system and are generally more expensive than traditional small-molecule drugs. Some physicians also receive payments from the drug, medical device, and supply industries. These payments have been shown to influence physicians’ prescription patterns ( 26 ). These factors lead to higher drug prices in the United States.
The United States relies heavily on patient cost sharing to lower drug utilization and steer patients to less expensive drugs, unlike most European countries, which have little or no cost sharing. In the United States, patients’ cost sharing is determined by their drug benefit plan and consists of either a copayment (unrelated to the price of the drug) or a coinsurance rate (related to the price and varying by the drug's formulary tier placement). These copay and coinsurance amounts are designed to encourage patients to carefully assess if they need that particular drug. The cost sharing is typically based on the list price of the drug: Higher list prices imply higher patient cost sharing. This is the reason why PBMs’ preference for high-price/high-rebate drugs leads to high patient cost sharing. Many branded drug companies offer coupons and patient assistance programs to mitigate or eliminate patients’ cost sharing, encouraging patients to take expensive drugs ( 28 , 37 , 52 ). These efforts make the patient less concerned about the high price of the drug, allowing drug companies to set even higher prices.
Private and public insurers hire PBMs to administer their drug benefits. Private payers pay pharmacies for drug benefits provided to their enrollees on the basis of the amount determined by PBMs, they often receive rebates from PBMs, and sometimes they pay service fees to PBMs. The public Medicare Part D program contracts with private prescription drug plans, which also use PBMs to negotiate price with drug companies and receive rebates from them to lower premiums. Public state Medicaid programs are required by law to offer all drugs and in return receive mandatory rebates based on statutory formulas ( 16 ). Studies suggest that the Medicare program pays the highest prices, private insurers pay slightly lower prices, the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense pay lower prices, and the Medicaid program pays the lowest prices ( 18 , 61 ). The price differentials across government programs (e.g., what Medicare pays and what Veterans Administration or the Department of Defense pays) can be in the 30–40% range ( 38 ).
The United States has begun experimenting with other approaches, recognizing that the current system has limited ability to contain drug price as compared with experiences in other industrialized countries. Numerous initiatives have been proposed, some implemented, to contain drug prices in the United States. The proposed initiatives include international reference pricing in Medicare Part B (physician-administered drugs) ( 36 ), drug importation from other countries ( 31 ), use of cost-utility analysis ( 32 ), price transparency on direct-to-consumer drug advertisements ( 29 ), elimination of PBM rebates that would change the incentives of PBMs ( 46 ), and benefit design reforms ( 17 , 49 ). The implemented initiatives include creation of drug affordability review boards that determine the reasonable amount that people should pay ( 31 ); “Netflix” models that allow the state to purchase an unlimited quantity of drugs at a set price ( 60 ); and nonprofit drug manufacturers that manufacture generic drugs where there is limited or no competition and high prices ( 40 ). Whether any of these initiatives are effective in actually containing drug prices remains to be seen.
Branded drugs are responsible for most of the drug spending in the United States, while representing only a small portion of all the drugs prescribed ( 5 ). Branded drugs are given government-granted monopolies through patents and/or market exclusivity periods to protect the drug company's research and development investment. The manufacturing cost of branded drugs is small (often pennies per pill) compared with their research and development expense ( 40 , 43 ).

Whether any of these initiatives are effective in actually containing drug prices remains to be seen.

Section: OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES USE ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO DRUG PRICING

Unlike the United States, most industrialized countries do not rely primarily on market forces to control drug prices. Instead, they employ various forms of rate setting and price regulations such as external or therapeutic reference pricing, therapeutic valuation, and health technology assessment. Countries using external reference prices will differ in terms of which foreign countries they select as benchmarks, how they calculate the comparison price, and how they use this comparison price to determine the price they will pay (e.g., used to set prices or used to inform price negotiations) ( 42 ). In therapeutic reference pricing, sometimes called internal reference pricing, a country compares a drug to therapeutically similar drugs within its own market, sets a reference price based on the lowest-price drug in the therapeutic class, and requires patients to pay the difference in price for a more expensive drug.
The United Kingdom and many other countries use health technology assessment (HTA) to influence the prices of new drugs entering the market. The United Kingdom's HTA body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), does this largely by conducting economic evaluations to determine the cost-effectiveness of a new drug compared to an existing alternative and calculating its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ( 44 ). The ICER takes into account the prices of the old and new drugs and the benefits of the old and new drugs.
Although a number of different considerations are used to inform NICE decision making ( 44 , 45 ), cost-effectiveness is the most significant factor ( 20 ). NICE uses a threshold range from £20,000 to £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ( 45 ). QALYs are a measure of benefit and take into account how long one will live and the quality of life one will have in various health states.
The National Health Service is typically required by law to make a drug available to patients within 90 days following a positive coverage recommendation from NICE. The United Kingdom is thus able to exercise indirect control over initial drug prices because drug manufacturers are aware of this cost-effectiveness threshold and must price their products accordingly if they wish to have their drugs covered.
It is worth noting that the growing prevalence of very expensive drugs has begun to strain the use of cost-effectiveness analysis to indirectly control drug prices in many countries. For example, although NICE deemed the hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, to be cost-effective despite its high price, the United Kingdom argued that, due to the large potential patient population with hepatitis C, covering the drug was unaffordable given its current budget ( 12 , 30 ). In many cases, health care budgets may not be large enough to cover the costs of every intervention with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio ( 9 ). As a result, cost-effective interventions will not always be affordable. For these high-priced drugs, drug companies may be encouraged to enter into patient access schemes with the government such as dose-capping agreements that require the manufacturer to pay for treatments beyond a predetermined number ( 48 ).
Australia also uses an HTA model. The Minister for Health and Aging is responsible for placing a drug on the formulary but cannot list a drug without a positive recommendation from the country's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee ( 47 ). Manufacturers prepare economic assessments of their drug products. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee considers cost-effectiveness (but, unlike the United Kingdom, does not use an explicit threshold), added therapeutic value, budget impact, and several other factors when making its formulary recommendations ( 47 ). Following a positive recommendation, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee does not, as in the United Kingdom, take manufacturer prices as given, but may instead facilitate government pricing negotiations with drug manufacturers. Drug companies may also enter into risk-sharing agreements with the government such as price–volume agreements, whereby the manufacturer accepts price reductions or pays a rebate to the government if sales exceed a forecasted amount ( 47 ). For generic drugs, maximum reimbursement levels are set via therapeutic reference pricing.
In Germany, drug manufacturers are free to set the price of a drug for its first full year postmarket launch, but they must also submit data to an independent body detailing the drug's added therapeutic benefit. The assessment of the drug's added therapeutic benefit serves as the basis for pricing in subsequent years. Drugs deemed not to provide added therapeutic benefit are assigned a maximum reimbursement amount according to therapeutic reference pricing, and manufacturers may be required to return excess profits in the form of rebates. For drugs that are deemed to provide an added therapeutic benefit, market prices beyond the first year are adjusted through negotiations between the manufacturer and the private health insurers. External reference prices are one factor that informs these negotiations. Unsuccessful negotiations are resolved in arbitration. The German system does not routinely employ cost-effectiveness analysis to determine drug prices, although it can ( 68 ).
France assesses both a drug's therapeutic value and added therapeutic value, which is a relative measure compared with existing drug alternatives. A drug's therapeutic value is used to determine its inclusion on the drug reimbursement list and the reimbursement rate. Drugs with a moderate or low therapeutic value for less severe diseases are reimbursed at a lower percentage of the drug's price. Assessment of therapeutic value involves several factors, including disease severity and burden, clinical efficacy, effectiveness, and safety and whether alternative treatments exist ( 50 ). Assessment of added therapeutic value focuses primarily on the drug's effectiveness compared with alternatives and informs a drug's list price ( 55 ). Negotiations between the government (the Economic Committee of Health Care Products) and manufacturers ultimately determine a drug's list price. Several factors are considered in price negotiations in addition to added therapeutic value, including external reference prices and sales forecasts ( 13 ).
Added therapeutic value, the most important factor in negotiations, is reevaluated for a particular drug every five years, or earlier if important new observational or clinical data become available ( 55 ). Agreements between the government and pharmaceutical companies also commonly include provisions related to sales volume, mandating rebates if an expected sales volume is surpassed, as well as those related to dosages and advertisements ( 55 ). In addition, when the rate of growth in pharmaceutical expenditures surpasses a certain threshold—set by parliament each year—all manufacturers must pay a rebate. These rebates differ by company and drug depending on the drug's added therapeutic value and that drug's contribution to the expenditure increase ( 55 ).
In Japan, an assessment of therapeutic value determines whether a drug is eligible for reimbursement, after which price negotiations can take place. Assessments of added therapeutic value are then used to assign price markups relative to an existing therapeutic comparator; the most innovative drugs may receive a markup of up to 120% ( 41 ). Japan also uses external reference prices to adjust list prices that deviate more than 25% from those in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Japan revises list prices biannually according to the prices actually paid by pharmacies and medical institutions and sets the prices in the coming year based on the actual prices. This results in price decreases over time ( 33 , 41 ). Japan also announced that it would implement HTA in 2019 that uses cost-effectiveness to further adjust drug prices ( 59 ).
Table 1 summarizes these various approaches and the key distinctions between each of these systems. Several lessons for the United States emerge from this overview. First, Germany shows that it is possible to combine a market-oriented pricing policy with value-based pricing methods and external reference pricing. Second, incorporating cost-effectiveness analyses does not have to restrict access to certain drugs or interventions. Third, innovation can be rewarded in a number of ways by integrating assessments of therapeutic value and added therapeutic value into the drug pricing system. Fourth, external reference prices can provide helpful information, even if it is not used directly to set prices. Fifth, distinct price controls can be used for generics versus branded drugs, as in Australia where generics are subject to therapeutic reference pricing.

Although different countries may adopt very different approaches to determining drug prices, prices in Ontario (Canada), the United Kingdom, and Japan were, as noted above, found to be relatively similar for a market basket of 79 branded, single-source drugs ( 36 ). Some countries paid higher prices for some drugs compared with the other countries; however, these countries paid lower prices for other drugs, which offset the higher prices. In almost all cases, the United States is the outlier, with considerably higher prices.

Section: DETERMINING DRUG PRICES IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

Average per capita income is lower in LMICs, resulting in reduced ability to pay, which often translates to lower drug prices ( 56 ). Pharmaceutical manufacturers typically use differential pricing by adjusting the price of the drug to the purchasing power of the country ( 2 , 21 ). A limited body of evidence has shown that drug prices are weakly, but positively, correlated with the country's average per capita income ( 21 ). Drug companies would most likely be able to sell only very few drugs in these countries at the higher price levels seen in industrialized countries. Instead, drug companies use the marginal cost of production to determine the prices for LMICs and do not expect these countries to pay for research and development or marketing. One problem with this approach is that parallel trade allows distributors to buy a patented product at a low price in one country and resell it in another country at a higher price.
What can happen within LMICs is that pharmaceutical companies charge higher prices for branded products to higher-income customers within the LMIC and offer cheaper generics to lower-income customers. Danzon et al. ( 24 ) have examined the cross-national income elasticity of drug prices across LMICs and found that the income elasticity tends to be lower in lower income countries, implying that “drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income countries” (p. 238). Another problem is that pharmaceutical manufacturers may opt not to offer their new products in LMICs if they estimate the opportunity for profit to be too low. As a result, the availability of innovative products in LMICs can be lower than in wealthier countries ( 11 ).
Even with differential pricing, some LMICs may not be able to afford the drugs they need, requiring global donors to fill the gap. One of the reasons is because as much as 90% of the population in LMICs purchases drugs out of pocket ( 54 ). The Global Fund has been the main funding source for pharmaceuticals in LMICs. Between 2003 and 2005, it awarded 315 grants totaling $3.36 billion in 127 countries, and 49% of those funds were directed toward the procurement of drugs ( 51 ). However, global donors have focused on treatments for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, as well as vaccines, contraceptives, and nutritional supplements, whereas chronic conditions have not received as much attention or as many resources ( 39 , 51 ). The availability of differential pricing for LMICs does not fully resolve drug affordability and access in these countries. It does, however, demonstrate drug manufacturers’ marginal cost of production and the significant drug pricing premium added to wealthier countries on the basis of their ability to pay. Often the prices preclude many people in LMICs from accessing these drugs.

Section: CONCLUSION

The United States is relatively unique in relying on price competition to set drug prices. The problem is that branded drugs have patents and market exclusivity periods that do not allow competition. The drug supply chain in the United States promotes higher, not lower, prices. The US system does not seem to work effectively given that the prices in the other countries are typically much lower than US prices. The various industrialized countries have utilized many different approaches to determine drug prices, including external reference pricing, therapeutic reference pricing, and HTA. However, in spite of adopting different mechanisms, the prices the various countries pay for a market basket of drugs are relatively similar, and the main variation seems to be the income of the country and not the mechanism for setting the payment rate.
