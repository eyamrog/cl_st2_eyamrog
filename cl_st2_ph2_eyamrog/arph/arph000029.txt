The year 2021 began with a flood of news bulletins and television news cameras centered on demonstrators attacking the US Capitol building. The attack followed a nationally televised series of goading encouragements and fabricated justifications by Donald Trump during a political rally in Washington, DC, where he instructed demonstrators to march on the Capitol. The goal was to disrupt the required Congressional verification of the 2020 presidential election results. The ensuing news coverage of the melee featured exchanges between political parties and reports on social media tweets with conflicting mass communication appeals and false claims (false claims on social media spread six times faster than accurate news). This uprising and subsequent media coverage resulted in an intense crossfire of conflicting mass, social, and organizational communications and a vote to impeach Trump for an unprecedented second time during his presidency.
These events of global impact occurred against the backdrop of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the greatest public health challenge in a century. The US response was characterized by weak and inconsistent federal government leadership. Moreover, the governmental response to the pandemic was heavily influenced, and in some cases seemingly wholly determined, by political considerations and ignored evidence-based scientific knowledge and experience. One consequence of ignoring science has been the undermining of the credibility and reputation of our top public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. In short, political machinations about the most effective approaches to combat the pandemic in the United States were louder, more concentrated, and more dramatic than most scientific dramas.
The public health effects of misinformation and disinformation have been felt long before the events of 2020. Climate change is one public health issue that exemplifies some of the debates around the politics, economics, and lifestyle changes that arouse public anxiety and controversy. These debates also offer parallels for the study of media disinformation that has, for several decades, featured mass media promotion of tobacco products aimed traditionally at men, but increasingly over the decades at youth and women as well. Beginning in the late 1970s, the tobacco industry's chemical adaptation and promotion of mentholated products were designed to make the side effects of smoking more tolerable, though no less damaging and lethal, especially for female and minority smoking populations.
Many of these themes on the interplay between science, politics, communication, and profits have been reported in earlier Annual Review of Public Health articles on the natural diffusion, dissemination, and countering of dubious as well as trusted health information (Green et al. 2009). We introduced Volume 40 with a reflection on “fake news, science, and the growing multiplicity and duplicity of information sources” (Green et al. 2020). In a related review in the current volume, Nutbeam & Lloyd highlight the role of health literacy in mediating the causes and effects of social determinants of health. In this mediator role, health literacy may be more immediately amenable to change than are other upstream social and economic conditions.
As the public and policy makers reflect on climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as on the use of vaccines, they debate the information sources, scientific and nonscientific, that demonstrate the reality or deniability, and the existential implications, of global warming and pandemic life. This wider lens of science, and of factual information versus disinformation, is addressed by Lewandowsky in the lead article of this volume in the context of climate change and “culturally aligned messengers and messages.” Lewandowsky discusses early and more recent theory– and evidence-based guidelines and public health experience in countering and dispelling public disinformation, particularly on climate change. The article also expands on and contextualizes the application of lessons compiled from the earlier decades of dissemination research. Finally, Lewandowsky draws attention to one of the impactful conclusions of a growing literature from education, the social sciences, and efforts to counter disinformation: Inoculation against disinformation before it is encountered can work in much the same way that vaccines protect against pandemic diseases.
