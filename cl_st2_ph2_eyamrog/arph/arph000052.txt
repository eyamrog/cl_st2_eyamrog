Section: ABSTRACT

From education to working conditions, from income to discrimination, social determinants of health (SDH) shape the majority of health outcomes. Governments are often best positioned to address the major SDH on a population-wide basis. In 2015, governments around the world committed to improving all core SDH when all countries agreed to a set of goals that would improve education, work, income, and equal opportunity, among other areas, in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using data from the WORLD Policy Analysis Center, this article highlights how quantitative policy measures can be used to hold governments accountable for their commitments to the SDGs and thus to improve the SDH. Three areas are examined in detail to illustrate this approach to monitoring policy change: ensuring an adequate income, enhancing equal opportunities at work by prohibiting discrimination and sexual harassment, and enabling children and youth to complete their education.

Section: BACKGROUND

In 2015, 193 countries agreed to the 17 goals and 169 targets embedded in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ( https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ ). This comprehensive set of global goals arose out of an iterative and participatory process to build consensus across stakeholders—including governments, civil society, international and regional government organizations, the private sector, and researchers—around the steps that were needed to create a blueprint for peace and prosperity for everyone around the world. This comprehensive blueprint addresses a wide range of fundamental areas, including poverty, hunger, health, education, inequality, work, and the environment, among others. Moreover, these goals were unique from previous efforts, such as the Millennium Development Goals, in that they recognize the need for improvement in all countries, regardless of income level, and they focus on ensuring that these improvements reach everyone, including the most marginalized, to ensure that no one is left behind. Embedded across the 17 goals was an ambitious commitment to transforming health globally both directly and indirectly by transforming the social determinants of health. The goals address the key areas identified seven years prior by the World Health Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health in its call for government action to achieve health equity within a generation by addressing inequalities across early childhood, education, urban and rural environments, employment and work, gender, and political participation and by ensuring equal opportunities through social protection systems and universal health care, among others ( 98 ). The SDGs’ strong commitment to addressing the social determinants of health, alongside strengthening health care systems, is especially critical because research has shown that the social determinants of health account for up to 60% of variations in health status ( 29 ). Income is an especially strong driver of health, determining whether individuals and families can meet their basic needs.
Government action at scale is one of the most effective ways to make progress on the social determinants of health. Policy decisions shape individuals’ access to quality education, opportunities to earn a decent income, and the environment in which they live. Policy actions at scale also have the ability to amplify or hinder the efficacy of targeted small-scale programs and interventions. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the impact that these decisions have on people's day-to-day lives, health, and economic security. To accelerate progress on the SDGs, stakeholders at all levels need access to data on which policy approaches countries have taken, in which areas individual countries and the global community as a whole are advancing, where they are falling behind, and which approaches have been feasible in different settings to reduce poverty. By monitoring national action, we can rapidly identify where countries’ legal frameworks reduce poverty and advance health as well as where they contribute to worsening inequality and increasing disease morbidity and mortality. At the same time, these data provide a powerful tool to identify feasible solutions from countries facing similar circumstances ( 92 ). Using advanced statistical methods, national-level policy data can be paired with harmonized household-level outcomes to assess the impact that policies have on income and population health, all while controlling for confounding factors. Together, these tools support more informed investment decisions by government budget offices and multilateral and philanthropic funds ( 38 ). This evidence can also inform rapid decision making in the context of public health and economic crises. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the urgency for evidence-based approaches as countries around the world are responding to balance public health and the economy by passing a range of temporary policies to protect population health, income, and economic security ( https://www.ugogentilini.net/ ).
In this article, we demonstrate a method for monitoring progress in the passage of national policies and the enactment of laws to realize SDG commitments. Given the importance of the social determinants of health in shaping health disparities, particularly for income, this article focuses on measuring progress on policies that matter to income, inequality, and health. We focus on the social determinants of health, given the large role that income plays in shaping overall health and given the urgency of addressing income during a time of global economic downturn. A critical first step to monitoring progress is creating a baseline for national action in key areas. This baseline can then be updated over time to evaluate national progress. The creation of quantitatively comparable indicators also enables analysis of the impact that policy changes have on outcomes using harmonized household survey data and quasi-experimental techniques. This article builds on past work demonstrating the value of global mapping of constitutional rights, laws, and policies as one component of progress related to international agreements ( 43 , 46 , 47 , 50 ).
This article looks at policies that matter to income and health in three main areas. First, it addresses policies at the intersection of enabling workers to balance meeting health needs while also maintaining job and income security: paid sick leave and paid parental leave (SDG 1.3). Second, it addresses policies that matter for ensuring equal opportunities at work: prohibition of discrimination at work (SDG 10.3) and prohibition of sexual harassment at work (SDG 5.2). Finally, this article addresses policies that matter for ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities to access jobs that enable them to earn a decent income by being able to complete their secondary education. This analysis will include examining tuition-free education policies (SDG 4.1), legal minimum age of marriage (SDG 5.3), and legal protections from child labor (SDG 8.7). For each of these areas, we briefly summarize the literature on why these policies matter to income and health and then use quantitative measures of laws and policies to assess progress on achieving SDG targets and to determine where critical gaps remain. Global policy data used in this article were developed by the WORLD Policy Analysis Center at the University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health.

Section: PAID SICK LEAVE

SDG 1.3 calls on countries to “implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial coverage of the poor and vulnerable” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1 ). Income protection during illness is an explicit component of the International Labour Organization social protection floor ( 58 ). It is also critical to enabling countries to adequately respond to infectious disease threats, such as COVID-19. Staying home while sick reduces infectious disease spread ( 99 ). Yet, workers who lack paid sick leave face a difficult choice between protecting health and protecting their family's economic security. Data from the United States, 1 of just 11 countries without a national paid sick leave policy, show that workers who lack paid sick leave are 1.5 times more likely to go to work sick, more likely to send their children to school when they are sick, and less likely to see a doctor during illness ( 69 ). Hence, a lack of paid sick leave makes it more likely that disease will spread to coworkers, customers, and clients, with associated productivity losses to businesses and local economies ( 6 , 31 , 65 , 66 , 80 ). Paid sick leave also matters to long-term health by enabling workers to meet their own and their families’ preventive health needs ( 101 ).
Yet, even among the 94% of countries that have paid sick leave policies, critical gaps remain that undermine the effectiveness of these policies for promoting public health (see Figure 1 ). In 27% of countries globally, paid sick leave benefits are not available from the first day of illness ( 49 ). This policy gap undermines efforts to ensure that all workers can stay home from the very first sign of illness ( 59 ). In nearly half of countries, less than full wage replacement rates may also jeopardize low-wage workers’ ability to afford to take leave.

A lack of paid sick leave coverage for workers in precarious and nonstandard employment is also a particular problem globally that exacerbates existing inequalities for workers who often have the fewest financial resources to handle income reductions during illness. Globally, more than two billion workers are engaged in informal employment ( 58 ), which includes self-employment. Yet, only 42% of countries explicitly guarantee paid sick leave benefits to self-employed workers. The problem is particularly acute in low-income countries where only 7% of countries extend explicit benefits compared with 67% of high-income countries ( 49 ). Women constitute some of the world's poorest workers and are also more likely than men to be working part-time ( 2 ). Only about one-third of countries globally (34%) explicitly guarantee paid sick leave to part-time workers. This gap is an especially critical concern during economic downturns, when underemployment becomes a more common problem as workers’ hours are reduced ( 56 ). Youth often have the fewest financial resources to fall back on during times of illness and are also more likely to have worked in jobs for a shorter period of time owing to unemployment or schooling ( 27 ). Thirty-six percent of countries explicitly exclude workers with one month of tenure from paid sick leave benefits. This legal gap creates additional challenges for protecting public health during a time of job insecurity that is likely to have lifelong impacts on youth's future economic opportunities ( 60 , 79 , 87 ).

Section: PAID PARENTAL LEAVE

Paid parental leave is another core part of the social protection floor covered by SDG 1.3 ( 19 ). SDG 5.4 also calls on countries to “recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family as nationally appropriate” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5 ). Paid parental leave provides parents with income support and job security after the birth, or in some cases adoption, of a child. Research has shown that paid leave for mothers is particularly important for women's attachment to the labor force and future career opportunities, which is critical to achieving SDG 8.5 ( 14 , 94 , 96 ). Research also suggests that policies promoting more gender-equal leave-taking by men, whether by reserving leave specifically for men or providing incentives for men to take leave, can promote more gender equality in caregiving ( 40 , 74 , 76 ). Moreover, paid maternity and paternity leave laws contribute to shifting societal norms about work toward greater gender equality and lead to greater equality in decision making ( 45 ).
Beyond the economic and gender equality benefits, research has shown that paid parental leave provides numerous benefits for infant health (SDG 3.2). Research from high-income settings has pointed to lower infant mortality rates and increased breastfeeding rates associated with paid leave policies ( 10 , 15 , 52 , 64 , 86 , 90 ). Comparative policy data paired with the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) have enabled researchers to answer whether these benefits also extended to lower-income settings where more workers are employed in the informal economy. A study of nearly 300,000 live births across 20 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) found that each additional month of paid maternity leave was associated with 7.9 fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births, a 13% reduction from the mean ( 73 ). Plausible mechanisms for the link between reductions in infant mortality and paid leave have been confirmed by further research. A study of more than 250,000 live births across 20 LMICs found that each additional week of paid maternity leave increased the probability of a child receiving the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) 1, 2, and 3 vaccinations by 1.38, 1.62, and 2.17 percentage points, respectively ( 41 ). Researchers separately found that each additional month of paid maternity leave was associated with a 7.4–percentage point increase in the prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding and a 2.2-month increase in average breastfeeding duration ( 20 ). A study of nearly 900,000 live births found that a one-month increase in the duration of paid maternity leave was associated with a 36% relative reduction in bloody diarrhea for children under the age of five ( 21 ).
Globally, nearly every country in the world guarantees paid leave to mothers of infants. However, there has been incomplete progress since 1995 on extending paid leave to meet international guidance for work or health outcomes. In 1995, only 39% of countries guaranteed women at least 14 weeks of paid leave, a minimum outlined in the International Labour Organization's Maternity Protection Convention (No. 183). By 2019, only 59% of countries do. Far fewer countries (27%) guarantee paid leave for at least 6 months, which would facilitate exclusive breastfeeding for the duration recommended by the World Health Organization. Paid maternal leave guarantees are shortest in lower-income settings. Only 48% of low-income countries and 53% of middle-income countries guarantee at least 14 weeks of paid leave compared with 76% of high-income countries.
Gender inequality remains embedded in paid parental leave, limiting women's economic opportunities. Globally, 44% of countries still fail to guarantee any paid leave for fathers. Even when paid leave is available to fathers, it is generally very short or a shared entitlement, which makes it less likely that fathers will take paid leave. Only 11% of countries support more gender-equal leave-taking by reserving more than two weeks of paid leave for fathers or by providing incentives for both parents to take leave. These disparities have profound impact on fathers' and mothers' roles in all families. Moreover, single-parent families headed by a father and two-father families are particularly disadvantaged ( 97 ).

Section: PROTECTION FROM DISCRIMINATION AT WORK

SDG 10.3 urges countries to “ensure equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcomes, including by … promoting appropriate legislation, policies and action in this regard” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10 ). Discrimination at work is a persistent problem globally that impacts individuals’ income and resulting health. Callback studies have documented disparities in whether equally qualified individuals are invited for an interview across gender, race, religion, age, and social class ( 9 ). Regression analysis has identified pay gaps across gender, motherhood status, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation that cannot be explained by other factors ( 13 , 17 , 26 , 32 , 67 , 84 , 95 ). Research evidence also demonstrates the benefit of antidiscrimination laws in reducing pay gaps ( 4 , 12 , 13 , 19 , 23 , 24 , 30 , 44 , 62 , 71 , 100 ).
Global data reveal tremendous variation in the level of protection from discrimination at work across type of discrimination and group ( 44 ). A substantial majority of the world protects workers from at least some form of discrimination based on gender (89%), disability (79%), religion (77%), and race/ethnicity (76%). However, these protections are far from comprehensive. For example, while 82% of countries guarantee protection from gender discrimination in pay, only 65% do so for hiring, 62% for terminations, 58% for promotions or demotions, and 53% for job training. In contrast with relatively high protections for other groups, only 37% of countries guarantee any protection from discrimination at work for migrants or on the basis of foreign national origin. Only 32% of countries provide explicit protection from any workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and 10% on the basis of gender identity. These workers have been particularly vulnerable to discrimination and harassment, as many countries continue to criminalize same-sex behaviors, and nativist sentiments threaten equal opportunities for migrants in many countries.

Section: PROTECTION FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT WORK

SDG 5.2 urges the elimination of “all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5 ). Yet, the #MeToo movement has highlighted the persistent problem of sexual harassment at work, which limits women's economic opportunities and jeopardizes their physical and mental health ( 7 , 22 , 25 , 51 , 53 ).
Globally, one-third of countries have no legal prohibition of workplace sexual harassment. Even among countries that legally prohibit it, legal gaps undermine protections for many women. Only 27% of countries that prohibit sexual harassment include both sex-based and sexual behavior–based harassment. In 14% of the countries that prohibit sexual harassment at work, the behaviors constituting sexual harassment are narrowly defined or prohibitions are addressed only in penal codes, which may limit avenues for civil redress. Similarly, one-third of countries that prohibit sexual harassment at work prohibit only harassment by employers or supervisors, which limits access to justice when employees are harassed by their coworkers, contractors, or customers. Access to justice is also limited when employees cannot report sexual harassment without fear of retaliatory action. Nearly one-third of countries that prohibited sexual harassment lacked explicit provisions to protect workers from retaliatory dismissal or other action ( 82 ).

Section: TUITION-FREE EDUCATION

Educational attainment is foundational to exiting poverty as well as to ensuring better health ( 18 , 36 ). Enabling all children and youth to complete a secondary education is therefore a priority not only to achieve SDG 4, but also to improve health (SDG 3), reduce poverty (SDG 1), ensure that people have the education they need to obtain decent work (SDG 8), and reduce gender and other inequalities (SDG 5 and SDG 10). SDG 4.1 calls on countries to “ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4 ). Free education is a critical piece of this target and is especially important during economic crises, given the barriers that tuition fees create for low-income households and girls’ education ( 34 , 42 ).
Rigorous studies of the impact of implementing tuition-free education have shown long-term benefits for health and gender equality. Using data from 17 LMICs, a study found that women who were of primary school age during a time when education was tuition-free had a greater likelihood of having their family planning needs met, of using modern contraception, and of having more say in health-related decisions ( 16 ). A study of 23 LMICs found that exposure to tuition-free primary education was associated with 15 fewer infant deaths and 5 fewer neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births, a relative decrease of 19% and 13% from the mean, respectively ( 81 ). Data from 16 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were used to find that eliminating primary school tuition fees reduced the prevalence of marriage before age 15 by an average of 2 percentage points ( 63 ).
Globally, nearly all countries (97%) have made primary education tuition-free through constitutional rights, laws, or policies ( 42 ) (see Figure 2 ). However, in many settings, a primary education is not enough to ensure access to jobs that earn a decent wage. While 84% of countries make the beginning of secondary education tuition-free, only 68% of countries make secondary education tuition-free through to completion. An additional 4% of countries have provisions in place to progressively realize free secondary education.

Using World Bank data on government expenditures on education, we can assess whether countries that have not made education tuition-free through to completion are already spending a large portion of their resources on education or whether they might be able to spend more. On average, countries spend 4.5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on education. Of the 28% of countries that fail to commit to making secondary school tuition-free through to completion, at least 11 countries spend less than 4% of their GDP on education, 1 indicating that these countries can afford to do more to make education tuition-free. However, at least 10 countries are already spending 5% or more of their GDP on education. This finding suggests that international investment may be needed to remove cost barriers to education.

Section: LEGAL MINIMUM AGE OF MARRIAGE

SDG 5.3 commits countries to “eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5 ). Early marriage has devastating effects on girls’ educational attainment, independence, and future economic opportunities ( 37 , 70 ). It also jeopardizes health by limiting their control over reproductive decision making, increasing their risk of sexually transmitted infections, and increasing their risk of domestic violence ( 5 , 39 ). Public health and economic crises may make girls more vulnerable to child marriage. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic will result in an additional 13 million child marriages owing to increased poverty (5.6 million marriages) and delays to interventions that help keep girls in schools and shift social and cultural norms (7.4 million marriages) ( 93 ).
Establishing a legal minimum age of marriage is an important first step to ending child marriage. It may also help shift attitudes toward and experiences of interpersonal violence, protecting women's health and keeping children from being exposed to domestic violence. A study of 19 LMICs found that establishing a minimum age of marriage of at least 18 years old was associated with improved attitudes toward violence among both women and men and with a reduced risk of experiencing physical and sexual abuse ( 77 ).
Globally, nearly all countries (90%) set a legal minimum age of marriage of 18 years or older for girls. However, many countries allow for legal loopholes that undermine these legal protections. Only 84% of countries establish a minimum age of marriage of 18 years or older under religious or customary law. Even more prevalent, just 58% of countries set a legal minimum age of 18 years old for girls to marry with parental consent. As most child marriages occur with parental consent and involvement, this loophole significantly undermines girls’ protection from early marriage. Moreover, legal gender equality in the minimum age of marriage with parental consent persists in nearly a quarter of countries (25%), providing girls with less legal protection from early marriage than boys. Gender disparity in law can undermine attempts to advance gender equality in other spheres of life.
Although legal reforms are needed in many countries to provide lasting legal protection from early marriage for girls, progress on reforming laws has been significant over the past 25 years. Whereas only 21% of LMICs legally prohibited girls from being married before age 18 with parental consent in 1995, more than half (54%) did so in 2019. Similarly, while two-thirds of countries had a gender disparity in the legal minimum age of marriage with parental consent in 1995, by 2019 the percentage had fallen to one-third.

Section: CHILD LABOR LEGISLATION

SDG 8.7 calls on countries to “take immediate and effective measures to … secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour … and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms” ( https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8 ). Child labor can interfere with children's ability to complete their education, impacting children from poorest families the most ( 3 , 11 , 35 , 83 , 88 , 91 ). As a result, child labor has lifelong impacts on income. Using global cross-sectional data, a study found that setting a minimum age of employment of 15 years or older was associated with 9.5-percentage-point higher net secondary school enrollment rates for girls and 7.8-percentage-point higher rates for boys ( 48 ). Another study used household-level data and difference-in-differences analyses to find increases in school attendance in two of the three LMICs studied ( 78 ). Child labor's link to decreased educational attainment is reflected in poorer health outcomes in adulthood, such as chronic disease and mobility issues ( 1 , 55 , 61 , 68 , 75 , 85 , 89 ). Child labor is also detrimental to children's health in the short run. Child labor exposes children to work-related injuries, hazardous chemicals and materials, opportunities for abuse, and chronic sleep deprivation ( 11 , 54 , 72 ).
Globally, more than three-quarters of countries legally protect children from hazardous work, which is classified as one of the worst forms of child labor. However, once exceptions to the minimum age of hazardous work are considered, such as work with family members or in specific industries, only 60% of countries legally protect children from hazardous work. Moreover, nearly one-quarter of countries legally allow children aged 15 or younger to do hazardous work in certain circumstances ( 28 ).
Countries are similarly far behind in legally ending child labor in all its forms by establishing a minimum age for admission to employment that protects children. In Convention 138, the International Labour Organization establishes that the minimum age for work should be at least 15 years old and not below the age for finishing compulsory schooling. Yet, only 76% of countries establish a minimum age for admission to employment of 15 years or older. Once exceptions to minimum age laws are considered, only 56% of countries legally establish a minimum age of 15 years or older for admission to employment. In nearly one-quarter of countries, these exceptions legally allow children to work without any minimum age protections.

Section: CONCLUSIONS

This article uses globally comparative indicators to highlight an approach to accelerating progress for achieving the SDGs in general, and those goals that matter to income and health in particular, by identifying progress and gaps in laws and policies that matter to achieving these goals. It focuses on policies that matter to ensuring an adequate income, including those at the intersection of work and health (paid sick leave and paid parental leave), policies that ensure equal opportunities at work by prohibiting discrimination and sexual harassment, and policies that help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity at jobs that earn a decent income by enabling children and youth to complete their education (tuition-free education, legal minimum age of marriage, and protection from child labor). Attention to these policies is particularly timely as countries around the world continue to grapple with how to respond to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including balancing economic activity with reducing disease spread, supporting equal opportunities at work during a time of significant job loss (including for parents balancing work and caregiving responsibilities), and ensuring continued access to education for all children amid school closures and economic hardship.
The data show that while there has been significant progress toward building a legal framework that reduces poverty and improves income and population health, substantial gaps remain. Nearly all countries have enacted a national paid sick leave policy and paid parental leave. However, exclusions in paid sick leave policies, such as unpaid waiting periods and lack of coverage for self-employed, part-time, and newly hired workers, jeopardize the ability of paid sick leave policies to work to ensure that all workers can stay home from the first sign of illness without risking their jobs. These exclusions undermine efforts to stop disease spread and disproportionately affect marginalized workers, including those in the informal economy, women, and youth.
Paid maternal leave falls short of international guidelines to support better health outcomes and leave availability for fathers is still very limited, which in turn limits women's equal opportunities at work. Nearly all countries have prohibited discrimination at work for at least some groups in at least some areas, but these protections are not enough to ensure comprehensive protections from discrimination, particularly for training and advancement at work. Similarly, protections often exclude the most marginalized of workers, including migrants and LGBTQ+ individuals.
Nearly all countries have made primary education tuition-free and established a legal minimum age of marriage for girls of 18 years or older. However, nearly one-third of countries charge tuition fees before youth can finish their secondary education, limiting access for girls and youth from the poorest households to jobs that earn a decent income and perpetuating poverty across generations.
In nearly half of countries, legal loopholes undermine protections for girls from early marriage by allowing them to be married before age 18 with parental permission, which has devastating effects on the health and economic security of women and girls. These loopholes leave women and girls without legal protections from early marriage at a time when households are under tremendous financial pressure and young brides are at an increased risk of domestic violence. Progress toward legally ending child labor lags even further behind, and legal loopholes also substantially undermine protections from hazardous work and employment that is likely to interfere with schooling for youth.
These legal gaps have contributed to stalling progress on achieving the SDGs, and they have also left countries around the world unprepared for the public health and economic threats of the COVID-19 pandemic. Without strong policy frameworks in place that cover all workers, public health advice to stay home when sick has been at odds with the economic reality facing many workers. Countries without paid leave from the first day of illness were among the hardest hit early on in the pandemic ( 49 ). During a time of job insecurity, workers around the world are left without protections from discriminatory action at work. Similarly, the economic fallout from the crisis is expected to exacerbate tough choices that poor households face regarding whether to send children to school. Without adequate protections in place, the opportunities of millions of children are at risk with lifelong impacts on economic opportunities and health.
At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the tremendously important role that laws and policies play in protecting public health, economic security, and equal opportunities. This article has demonstrated the power of quantitatively comparable indicators on laws and policies to highlight progress and gaps in legal protections. By mapping country approaches, we can also rapidly identify peers or models for countries seeking to strengthen legal protections. This monitoring and research can be a powerful complement to existing efforts by the United Nations to ensure better outcome data collection, particularly for the most marginalized groups.
Accelerating progress on the SDGs will require working across silos and recognizing that improving health also critically depends on ensuring that progress is made toward eliminating poverty, expanding access to quality education, ensuring access to decent work, and eradicating inequality. Throughout, this article has highlighted research evidence that uses these quantitatively comparable indicators paired with harmonized household survey data to answer questions about which policies have been effective at improving outcomes, under which conditions, and for which groups. This type of research is critical for advancing evidence-based decision making by providing stakeholders with more information on short- and long-term benefits of policy changes to weigh against the cost of financing policies. Further research is needed to expand the evidence base on the impact that policies have on outcomes, particularly during times of global crisis. Emphasis should be placed on ensuring that the benefits of these policies reach the most marginalized groups. Expanding the evidence could also play a critical role in ensuring that temporary policy expansions enacted to respond to COVID-19 become permanent to provide lasting protection for public health and to ensure that countries are prepared for the next global threat.
COVID-19 has highlighted the immense human tragedy of individuals and groups being left behind from progress on strengthening public health and economic security ( 8 , 33 , 57 ). While COVID-19 is the most severe public health and economic crisis to be faced in a generation, it is unlikely to be the last. Climate change will likely fuel more crises. Countries need to respond not just to support their populations during the current pandemic, but also to ensure that legal frameworks are in place that reduce health and economic disparities and increase resiliency for the next crisis. By quantitatively mapping progress and gaps on laws and policies that matter to achieving the SDGs, we can identify areas where action is urgently needed.
