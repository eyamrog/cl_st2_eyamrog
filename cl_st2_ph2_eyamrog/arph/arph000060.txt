Section: ABSTRACT

Racism. Sexism. Heterosexism. Gender binarism. Together, they comprise intimately harmful, distinct, and entangled societal systems of self-serving domination and privilege that structure the embodiment of health inequities. Guided by the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, I synthesize key features of the specified “isms” and provide a measurement schema, informed by research from both the Global North and the Global South. Metrics discussed include ( a ) structural, including explicit rules and laws, nonexplicit rules and laws, and area-based or institutional nonrule measures; and ( b ) individual-level (exposures and internalized) measures, including explicit self-report, implicit, and experimental. Recommendations include ( a ) expanding the use of structural measures to extend beyond the current primary emphasis on psychosocial individual-level measures; ( b ) analyzing exposure in relation to both life course and historical generation; ( c ) developing measures of anti-isms; and ( d ) developing terrestrially grounded measures that can reveal links between the structural drivers of unjust isms and their toll on environmental degradation, climate change, and health inequities.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Racism. Sexism. Heterosexism. Gender binarism. Each of these seemingly abstract terms encompasses very real and intimately harmful and distinct societal systems of self-serving domination and privilege ( 13 , 67 , 74 ) that are created by people and structure health inequities ( 99 )—that is, unjust, unnecessary, and preventable differences in health status between social groups ( 26 , 194 ). Accounting for the avoidable and inequitable suffering these “isms” cause requires measures of exposure that are attuned to ( a ) the explicit and tacit rules that codefine the social groups at issue and the polarities of superior/inferior and normal/deviant they encompass and ( b ) clarifying not only who is harmed but who gains, socially and materially, from these divisions ( 13 , 99 ). It also requires challenging biological essentialism and situating human power relations in the larger context of life on Earth ( 57 , 61 , 65 , 97 , 117 ).
These may appear to be obvious statements. However, prior to the 1990s, only scant research measured the impact of discrimination and health, and research conducted since then, largely in the Global North, has chiefly used individual-level measures of self-reported experiences of discrimination ( 91 , 99 , 157 , 196 ) ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Only in the past 10 years has a body of research emerged regarding the health impact of what variously is referred to as structural or institutional discrimination ( 8 , 58 , 77 , 99 , 196 ), albeit using a confusing welter of heterogeneous social metrics. Only a small fraction of this work has addressed environmental racism ( 43 , 182 ); even less has focused on global climate change ( 57 , 162 ) ( Supplemental Table 1 ).
Accordingly, in this review I focus first on first principles for thinking through what measuring isms entails—whether for the isms I was invited to address or those beyond the scope of this review—and why this can vary, not only across different types of injustice and in different societal contexts, but also over time, depending on advances and setbacks in collective efforts to build equitable societies. Drawing on the ecosocial theory of disease distribution ( 91 , 93 , 97 ), I synthesize key features of these isms ( Table 1 ) and provide a measurement schema ( Table 2 ), which together inform my discussion of concrete examples of such research from the Global North and the Global South ( Table 3 ). My sources include both literature I have engaged with during the past 35 years as a US social epidemiologist ( 90 – 99 , 109 ) and new material I have reviewed for this article (see search terms in Supplemental Table 2 ). As shown in the examples below, the availability of apt measures—and, more often, their absence—means that there is a grave need for better work worldwide to improve the conceptual and methodological rigor, as well as the scope and inclusiveness, of these much-needed metrics.

Section: ON ISMS AND HEALTH EQUITY: CONCEPTS AND KEY CONSIDERATIONS

The first point is that isms are not things. The term “ism” is a suffix that forms nouns of action ( 153 ). Sometimes the action involved occurs without human agency, as in the case of “magnetism” ( 153 ). More commonly, however, an ism is a connected system of ideas, beliefs, and practices conceived by people with purpose in mind ( 153 ). Providing guidance for action, isms can be religious, ecclesiastical, philosophical, political, or social and can variously be articulated through explicit institutions or via doctrines or principles that are not institutionally based, per se ( 153 ). Familiar examples listed in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) include, for the former, “ Buddhism, Calvinism, Catholicism,…Conservatism, Epicureanism, Judaism,…Liberalism…Platonism, Positivism, Presbyterianism, Protestantism, Puritanism,…Quakerism…Taoism…Whiggism ” ( 153 , italics in original); illustrating the latter is a fascinating list encompassing “ agnosticism, altruism, animism, atheism, bimetallism, deism, egoism, egotism, empiricism, evangelism, fanaticism, feminism, heathenism, hedonism, idealism, imperialism, jingoism, libertinism, monarchism, naturalism, opportunism, pædobaptism, paganism, polytheism, realism, romanticism, sansculottism, scepticism, stoicism, theism, universalism ” ( 153 , italics in original).
Nothing about isms requires that they involve injustice. However, directly relevant to this review, in 2004 the OED included two new draft additions to their definition of isms ( 153 ):



These sets of isms likewise provide guidance for action, in this case, unjust practices variously implemented by states, nonstate institutions, and individuals within their societal contexts.
Table 1 accordingly presents features of the isms addressed in this article in relation to health inequities. At issue is how the specified forms of unjust treatment structure exposure to which types of harmful biophysical and social phenomena, at what point in the life course, with which kinds of etiologic periods, and with what potential for intergenerational harm.
The second point is that much as isms involving injustice are about beliefs, they are fundamentally rooted in real-world material conflicts over power and property ( 13 , 67 , 74 )—as tied to the workings of diverse political economy isms, e.g., capitalism (including neoliberalism), socialism, communism, feudalism, communitarism, etc. At issue are societal structures linking political governance, economic rules, and rules governing who is allowed which rights to live, produce, and reproduce (or not) where, in which community and family structures, and with which rights to use, own, and extract resources from which land, water, forests, and other species ( 13 , 21 , 57 , 66 , 67 , 117 , 162 ).
The ecosocial theory of disease distribution—which I first proposed in 1994 and have elaborated since—accordingly conceptualizes health inequities in relation to power, levels, life course, historical generation, biology, and ecosystems ( 91 , 93 , 95 – 97 ) ( Figure 1 ). Its four core conjoined constructs pertain to ( a ) embodiment; ( b ) pathways of embodiment; ( c ) cumulative interplay of exposure, susceptibility, and resistance across the life course and across levels; and ( d ) accountability and agency. As the ecosocial construct of embodiment has clarified from the start ( 91 , 95 , 97 ), we jointly live our myriad legally and socially ascribed categories and identities, which notably can vary, among individuals, over time and by context ( 25 , 86 , 122 , 151 , 190 ). We are not a member of a particular racial/ethnic group one day, have a particular gender identity on another, and on still another day have a particular sexual orientation (whether identity, behavior, or desire)—and the same holds for our social class, immigration status, and where we live and work ( 91 , 92 , 95 , 97 , 109 ). Instead, we live embodied—and our bodies each and every day biologically integrate each and every type of unjust, and also beneficial, exposure encountered, at each and every level ( 96 , 97 ). The construct of intersectionality, a term originating in the legal and social sciences ( 67 , 74 ), similarly conveys the socially structured entanglement of multiple types of injustice, albeit without a focus on the pathways and processes of literal biological embodiment ( 91 – 99 ).

The third point is that, in accord with ecosocial theory ( 91 , 97 ), a structural systems-oriented understanding of isms necessarily challenges two faulty premises of biological essentialism: ( a ) the spurious construct of biological race, which wrongly presumes humanity can be cleaved into distinct biological “races” that intrinsically differ in health status and other traits ( 169 , 203 ), including their human needs for rights and resources to thrive ( 49 ); and ( b ) the erroneous beliefs that gender and sexual orientation are fixed, binary, and biologically determined by sex-linked biology ( 54 , 61 , 86 , 94 , 161 , 190 ). Also to contest are ( a ) conventional legal definitions that restrict “discrimination” to mean unfair treatment based on allegedly innate immutable and discrete characteristics, e.g., “race,” “sex,” or “sexual orientation” ( 3 , 174 ) and ( b ) the conventional—and contradictory—causal inference suppositions that “race,” “sex,” and “sexual orientation” are either “unmodifiable” characteristics (and thus cannot be “causes”) or else, unto themselves, are intrinsically the “causes” of health disparities ( 105 ). Rather, the very idea that these are fixed attributes that determine who people are—and at the same time are themselves causally sufficient to explain group differences in health (without reference to the causal perpetrators, both systemic and individual)—is part of the belief system of the very isms at issue. Notably, other forms of discrimination recognized and prohibited by law include discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs and political views ( 3 ), which, while potentially influenced by familial context, are surely neither innate nor immutable.
The final point is that, to reiterate what I stated 20 years ago, the reason to study how injustice harms health is not to prove that injustice is wrong, since it is, by definition ( 92 ). Instead, the reasons are to deepen understanding of how injustice shapes population health, for whose benefit at whose expense; to contest narratives that naturalize inequities; and to generate evidence for accountability. After all, if people have created unjust societal systems and structures, so too can people challenge these systems and structures and advocate instead for human rights, health equity, and ecological sustainability ( 13 , 21 , 67 , 74 , 97 , 155 , 162 , 181 ).
CORE CONSTRUCTS OF ECOSOCIAL THEORY
Embodiment refers to how we literally incorporate, biologically, the material (biophysical) and social world in which we live. The concept of pathways of embodiment refers to how processes of embodiment are shaped simultaneously by histories of societal arrangements of power and property and by constraints and possibilities of our evolved biology in ecological context, involving gene expression and not just gene frequency. Cumulative interplay of exposure, susceptibility, and resistance across the life course and across levels refers to the importance of timing and accumulation of, and responses to, embodied exposures, taking into account both individuals’ life course social and biological development and the historical generation into which they have been born, as well as the levels at which both the exposures—and susceptibility and resistance to these exposures—are occurring (i.e., global, national, regional, area or group, household, individual). The concept of accountability and agency refers to both ( a ) the institutions and persons responsible for generating or perpetuating health inequities and ( b ) the public health researchers for the theories used to explain or ignore these injustices. Together, these conjoined constructs underscore why measures of isms must take into account ( a ) structural, legal, and policy contexts, as tied to changes in political and economic power (at different levels) to uphold or challenge the isms, and ( b ) timeframes of both exposures and their impacts, in relation to both the biophysical and social worlds and the relevant etiologic periods within and across generations.
PATHWAYS OF EMBODIMENT
Pathways of embodiment especially relevant to exposure to unjust isms involve adverse exposures to ( 95 – 99 ) social and economic deprivation; exogenous hazards (e.g., toxic substances, pathogens, and hazardous conditions); social trauma (e.g., discrimination and other forms of mental, physical, and sexual trauma); targeted marketing of harmful commodities (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, other licit and illicit drugs); inadequate or degrading medical care; and degradation of ecosystems, including degradation linked to the alienation of Indigenous populations from their lands. These pathways, and multiple isms, occur—and are embodied—concurrently and interactively.

The first point is that isms are not things. The term “ism” is a suffix that forms nouns of action ( 153 ). Sometimes the action involved occurs without human agency, as in the case of “magnetism” ( 153 ). More commonly, however, an ism is a connected system of ideas, beliefs, and practices conceived by people with purpose in mind ( 153 ).

Section: OPERATIONALIZING ISMS FOR HEALTH EQUITY RESEARCH: A SCHEMA AND CONCRETE EXAMPLES

Table 2 provides a schema for delineating different types of measures of the specified isms—and anti-isms—relevant for health equity research, with attention to issues of study design. Including anti-isms matters because, from the causal standpoint of inference to the best explanation ( 105 , 124 ), if adverse isms are posited to drive health inequities, then anti-isms should aid health equity. Table 3 in turns provides selected examples of health equity studies that have used such measures, at different levels, from both the Global South and the Global North; Supplemental Table 3 provides the technical details of the metrics these studies employed.
The term structural—as applied to isms—has, in the past decade, begun to surface in a small but growing number of health equity studies ( 8 , 14 , 58 , 77 , 99 , 196 ) ( Table 3 ; Supplemental Table 1 ). “Structural” is meant to convey the “totality of ways” in which societies foster unjust isms through “mutually reinforcing systems” that can variously involve “housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care, and criminal justice” ( 8 , p. 1453) and also marriage law, family law, identity documents, and property ownership ( 13 , 21 , 67 ). These laws, rules, and practices in turn “reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources” ( 8 , p. 1453). Structural injustice thus exists above and beyond—while also shaping—unjust interpersonal interactions and individual beliefs aligning with the isms at issue ( Table 1 ).
When it comes to the measurement of structural isms, however, more precision is required. Clarifying the different types and meanings of “structure” is crucial for accurate identification of etiology, accountability, and agency, and thus avenues for action.
One class of structural measures pertain to explicitly stated “rules of the game” ( 13 , p. 11) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). These rules can be articulated in explicit laws, policies, or algorithms, for which either government or nongovernmental institutions bear responsibility, thereby pointing to potential legal liability, claims for remedies or reparations, and alternative legislation ( 13 , 181 , 187 ). Well-known example include, in the United States, legally sanctioned white supremacy, black enslavement, and subsequent legal racial discrimination (i.e., Jim Crow laws) ( 1 , 4 , 56 , 151 ); legal and genocidal “racial hygiene” in Nazi Germany (informed by U.S. Jim Crow laws) ( 56 , 151 ); legal apartheid in South Africa (which also drew on U.S. Jim Crow laws) ( 56 ); the long-standing legal disenfranchisement of women in most countries around the world [women were first legally granted the right to vote, nationally, in New Zealand in 1893, and, most recently, in 2015, in Saudi Arabia, albeit only at the local level ( 184 )]; national laws in 72 countries (as of 2017) that prohibit same-sex relationships ( 34 ); and a new US federal policy, under legal challenge, that prohibits transgender persons from enlisting in the military ( 123 ).
Two potential limitations involving these types of structural measures concern inadequate measure of exposure and also correlated exposures. First, health equity studies using these types of metrics typically focus on the presence of such rules; less attention, if any, is given to assessing whether or how these rules are (selectively) enforced, such that important variations in actual exposures may be overlooked ( 13 , 66 , 181 ). Second, health equity studies typically focus on rules for solely one type of ism, and while this approach may sometimes be warranted, often the ideological orientation of state policies means that rules for related adverse isms travel together ( 13 , 35 ); a potential corrective could be inclusion, as covariates, of indices that capture multiple related policies ( 13 , 35 ).
Other times, the laws or rules deliberately do not name the targeted groups, e.g., because it is illegal to do so, but nevertheless discriminate adversely, by design or effect ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). Two classic examples from the United States, designed to target African Americans without the relevant laws naming this group explicitly, include ( a ) the War on Drugs ( 1 , 75 ) and its links to mass incarceration, both of which have been a focus of health equity research ( 140 , 195 ), and ( b ) voter suppression, whether by (now outlawed) poll taxes and literacy tests or by (still legal) partisan gerrymandering, restrictive voter ID laws, and limits on times and places to vote ( 4 , 151 ), which by contrast has received scant attention in health equity research ( 88 ). A newer form of nonexplicit rule-based discrimination is discrimination-by-algorithm, whereby algorithms applied to biased data yield biased predictions, as has occurred with machine learning, big data, and institutional decisions regarding employment, criminal sentencing, mortgage approval, and medical care ( 63 , 148 , 168 ). In both cases, the anti-ism measures needed to counter these types of injustice require explicit use of ism-conscious rules to protect the targeted groups ( 1 , 4 , 70 , 148 , 168 , 187 ).
Other measures appearing in the health equity research literature that are also referred to as structural do not directly assess actual rules (whether explicit or implicit), but instead comprise area-based or institutional measures regarding legacies and indicators of inferred rule-based structural injustice ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). Most commonly, such measures employ population-based data and quantify the difference (relative or absolute) between the targeted group and the privileged group in relation to one or more specified social outcomes, e.g., group differences in income, education, employment, home ownership, residential segregation, political representation, policing, mass incarceration, access to transportation, access to reproductive health services, proximity to toxic waste sites or polluting industries or facilities, etc. ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). The measures used, to date, in health equity research have been highly heterogeneous, rendering comparison of results across studies difficult. They also have thus far been limited by reliance on data that are publicly available and which can be stratified by the relevant social groups. Also potentially of interest, but not yet used in quantitative population-based health equity research, are area-based metrics for exposure to public monuments that support unjust isms (e.g., in the United States, monuments supporting the Confederacy) and also, as anti-isms, the removal of these monuments as well as their replacement by public art that exposes the unjust isms ( 23 , 82 , 136 , 172 ).
Additional area-based measures newly being used in health equity research seek to measure social norms regarding isms by employing survey or Internet data ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). Caution is required, however, given ( a ) well-known biases (especially underreporting) in self-report survey data on adverse discriminatory attitudes ( 10 , 92 , 99 , 145 , 154 , 157 ) and ( b ) fast-rising fraudulent postings online, especially on hot-button isms, to foment political divisions ( 30 , 148 ). An alternative approach, not subject to these biases but apparently not yet used in population-based health equity research, involves audit studies, i.e., investigations that send identical resumes—or identically dressed people of similar body build—to potential employers or landlords; in such studies, the applicants differ solely in their racial/ethnic or gendered appearance or couple status (e.g., single, same-sex couple, heterosexual couple) ( 118 , 145 , 154 , 167 ). Another newly employed approach in health equity research is to use area-based implicit bias data ( 137 , 152 ); however, an important caveat concerns how selection bias can affect who voluntarily seeks out and takes such Web-based tests (e.g., mainly highly educated and affluent persons) ( 18 , 22 , 201 ). Together, these types of area-based measures provide evidence solely about what is termed statistical discrimination (i.e., statistical evidence of group differences inferred to arise due to unjust processes but absent explicit evidence of motivation), and while such evidence may not meet legal standards that require proof of intent ( 3 , 174 ), it can still usefully inform and galvanize action for equity.
Which types of structural measures can be used depend on societal and historical context. A key consideration is whether the type of injustice at issue is legally under contest.
Consider, first, the case of adverse racial residential segregation in the United States. Its contours were shaped by US federal and state laws and policies, translated into official maps, that mandated neighborhood residential racial segregation and disinvestment both in and outside Jim Crow states from the 1930s to the mid-1960s, after which such legal racial discrimination was nationally outlawed ( 55 , 135 , 170 ). Given the post-1965 lack of variation by place or time in laws permitting racial discrimination in housing, health equity studies have relied primarily on area-based indicators that are inferred to reflect the impact of historical legal adverse racial residential segregation and also current illegal racial discrimination. Such indicators have variously pertained to neighborhood composition (e.g., racial/ethnic, income) and conditions (e.g., physical environment, housing stock), intergenerational transfers of wealth and impoverishment as tied to home equity, and political power as tied to voting districts and voting facilities ( 4 , 8 , 58 , 99 , 135 , 157 , 192 , 196 ). Only with the recent unearthing and digitization of the original 1930s maps ( 55 , 170 ) has it become possible for health equity researchers to start to investigate the long-term impacts of the original legal discrimination on both neighborhood trajectories and health inequities (79, 130, 135; N.

Bassett, unpublished data).
By contrast, present-day legal and policy conflicts over, say, same-sex marriage and civil unions ( 19 , 34 ), and over the rights of transgender and third-gender persons (e.g., travesties in South America, hijras in India, and muxes in Mexico) ( 19 , 34 , 47 , 190 , 193 ), render it feasible to analyze the contemporaneous health impacts of the explicit rules at issue. The same holds, in relation to sexism, for current conflicts over laws and policies regarding sexual harassment ( 81 , 86 , 149 , 204 ), gender-based violence ( 24 , 86 , 133 , 188 ), and sexual and reproductive rights and health, e.g., regarding access to contraception, abortion, or inclusive health care for sexual or gender minorities, or policies regarding pregnancy and parental leave ( 13 , 24 , 53 , 59 , 62 , 67 , 68 , 86 , 144 , 181 ).
Regardless of the type of structural measure employed, careful thought needs to be given to both the comparison groups ( 101 , 173 ) and the etiologic period ( 14 , 97 ). Also at issue is the extent to which people are legally able to move in order to benefit from or avoid policy changes ( 13 , 135 ). Contrasts can include ( a ) comparisons of the health of the targeted groups before and after the law or policy goes into effect in their polity; ( b ) within-polity changes in the magnitude of health inequities comparing the targeted and privileged group, before or after the policy change; and ( c ) cross-sectional comparisons of either the health status of the targeted group or the magnitude of the health inequities between the targeted group and the privileged group across polities that differ in the relevant law or policy. Short-term (or even cross-sectional) temporal comparisons may be apt for outcomes with a short etiologic period (e.g., psychological distress); if longer etiologic periods are involved, time lags must be considered ( 13 , 97 ).
An especially important consideration concerns the long-term life course and intergenerational realities of embodied harm. What may seem “long ago,” from a legal or policy standpoint, can be but an instant in terms of biological generations ( 97 , 104 , 107 ). Jim Crow laws, for example, were decreed illegal in the United States in 1964 ( 1 , 4 , 151 ). However, anyone born in the United States who, in 2019, is age 55 or older was born when Jim Crow was the law of the land, and any child of theirs is the child of a person who potentially experienced this all-encompassing form of structural racism ( 2 , 83 , 101 ). The handful of health equity studies on Jim Crow and its abolition demonstrate its relevance to rates of infant mortality, premature mortality, and current risk of more lethal types of breast cancer ( 2 , 70 , 83 , 101 , 102 , 106 , 107 ). It is this understanding of embodied history that health equity researchers can bring to their choice of measures of isms.
Despite the importance of structural conditions shaping people's exposures, the most commonly used measures in health equity research on isms and health nevertheless are individual-level explicit self-reports of exposure to discrimination (whether as a target or a witness) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Tables 1–3 ). Other individual-level metrics, used less frequently, include implicit measures of exposure to discrimination and measures of internalized oppression.
As discussed at length in other recent reviews ( 12 , 89 , 98 , 99 , 121 , 141 , 142 , 157 , 158 , 196 ), in the case of racism, heterosexism, and gender binarism, most studies rely on self-report explicit measures. These measures typically assess if the exposure has occurred; in which context (e.g., at work, in a public setting, at school, from the police or in the courts, online, getting medical care, etc.); with what intensity, chronicity, and duration of exposure (including age at onset); and also how the exposed person responds (e.g., from resistance to internalization) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Tables 1–3 ). By contrast, for sexism, measures more typically pertain to phenomena that can be conceptualized as actualizing beliefs and practices emblematic of sexism, e.g., sexual harassment (especially at work, but also in public settings) ( 31 , 103 , 150 , 204 ), gender-based violence, and control over sexual and reproductive rights and health ( 24 , 77 , 86 , 99 , 133 , 139 , 161 , 188 ) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Tables 1–3 ).
As with any self-report measures, caveats abound ( Table 2 ). First, self-reported measures can express only what people are willing and able to say ( 92 , 99 ), as shaped by fear, social desirability, trauma, internalized oppression, and lack of knowledge ( 10 , 33 , 98 , 145 , 154 , 157 ). Moreover, members of the privileged group may claim reverse discrimination when confronted by potential diminishment of prior privilege ( 99 , 144 , 165 , 191 , 200 ); health equity studies that include members of the privileged groups could—but rarely do—employ relevant measures of resentment [e.g., racial resentment ( 191 ) or hostile sexism ( 164 )] to aid interpretation of results. Self-reported experiences of discrimination, moreover, are typically analyzed solely as a psychosocial stressor ( 12 , 89 , 92 , 98 , 99 , 121 , 141 , 142 , 157 , 158 , 196 ), even as some exposures (e.g., unfair policing) pose physical, not just psychosocial, risks ( 1 , 52 , 75 , 98 ).
Pointing further to limitations of a solely psychosocial focus, consider the case of wage discrimination, which can harm people's health by causing material (economic) harm ( 92 , 99 , 155 , 174 ). Notably, in the United States, the workplace is among the most commonly self-reported sites for racial, gender, and anti-LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) discrimination ( 99 , 147 ). It is difficult, however, for employees to know if wage discrimination is occurring. Why? The answer is not simply social norms. Rather, it is currently legal in only 15 of the 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia, for employees to share information about their wages ( 198 ). Not surprisingly, several recent high-profile wage discrimination suits in the United States have been started by plaintiffs who accidentally discovered the pay stubs of fellow workers who were paid higher wages for the same job ( 120 , 199 ). Also not surprisingly, research has found that states with legally protected transparency about wages have the lowest within-job-title gender wage inequities ( 85 ). Thus, where rules govern what individuals cannot know, it is likely that structural measures will outperform self-report data as a measure of exposure.
Additional concerns about self-report measures, discussed at length in other literature ( 11 , 27 , 99 , 121 , 157 , 196 ), pertain to whether questions should refer explicitly to discrimination [as per the Experiences of Discrimination measure ( 110 , 111 )] or to unfair treatment [as per the Everyday Discrimination Scale ( 196 , 197 )], or should solely name the behaviors at issue. Even in research on sexual harassment and gender-based violence, for which the consensus is to focus on behaviors (with no explicit mention of abuse or sexism), controversies abound over which behaviors, enacted by whom, against whom, should count, and how best to counter fears and internalized blame that contribute to underreporting ( 133 , 188 , 204 ). Another problematic issue is that the discrimination and health literature contains numerous studies that employ solely one- or two-item instruments, despite well-known psychometric flaws affecting reliability and validity of instruments with so few items ( 12 , 44 , 99 , 141 , 142 ).
Despite these challenges, studies from around the world have found that self-reported experiences of diverse types of discrimination and hate crimes rooted in unjust isms are robustly associated with psychological distress and are more complexly associated with adverse health behaviors, biomarkers, and disease outcomes ( 99 , 128 , 157 , 158 , 193 , 196 ). They are, accordingly, an important complement to structural measures, providing insights into personal experiences that lie on the pathways of embodiment connecting structural drivers to embodied harm and population health inequities.
Another option is afforded by the implicit association test (IAT), a robustly validated and widely accepted cognitive time-reaction test well-described in the psychological literature, which was designed to address the well-known problems affecting the use of self-report data to measure socially sensitive topics ( 10 , 44 , 64 , 146 ). Our preliminary studies ( 33 , 100 , 113 , 114 ) of the new IATs we developed to assess someone's sense of being a target of discrimination found that these IATs were not associated with social desirability (as commonly is the case for self-report data), they did not display the well-known person-group discrimination discrepancy that affects self-report measures (which previously had been hypothesized to be an artifact of social desirability), and they were also associated with smoking and with elevated blood pressure ( 33 , 114 ). Work on these measures remains in its infancy.
Less commonly, psychosocial research on health impacts of isms has also used experimental techniques, exposing participants either to vignettes or to controlled situations designed to correspond to experiences shaped by these isms, to assess their impact on psychological state, physiological arousal, or diverse biomarkers ( 44 , 99 , 128 , 145 , 158 ). Despite well-known questions regarding the generalizability of such results to impacts of real-world psychosocial stressors ( 44 , 145 , 154 ), such studies can potentially yield insights into sets of psychological and biological mechanisms that may be involved in behaviorally and biologically translating unjust isms into embodied harm ( 44 , 99 , 116 , 128 ).
Finally, health equity studies addressing racism, heterosexism, and gender binarism, but rarely sexism, have employed measures of what may be termed internalized isms, e.g., internalized oppression or stigma ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). At issue is the extent to which persons in the targeted group consciously or unconsciously accept the privileged group's view of them as inferior, deviant, or shameful, thus potentially increasing the targeted group's risk of harm to health via psychosocial pathways, both behavioral and biological ( 99 , 128 , 157 , 193 , 196 ). Measures of anti-isms ( Table 1 ) conversely can assess, at the individual level, the extent of pride (and perhaps defiance) that persons in the targeted group feel about their group and their analysis of who discriminates against them and why ( 99 , 157 ); also germane, at the population level, are public demonstrations about, and the appearance of, public slogans regarding, say, LGBT pride or “black is beautiful” ( 74 , 127 , 176 , 187 , 190 ). As in the case of the self-report measures of exposure to discrimination, measures of internalized oppression and pride typically rely on explicit self-report instruments (with all the same caveats about self-report data) ( 44 , 99 , 157 ) or, less commonly, implicit measures ( 10 , 38 ).
The term structural—as applied to isms—has, in the past decade, begun to surface in a small but growing number of health equity studies ( 8 , 14 , 58 , 77 , 99 , 196 ) ( Table 3 ; Supplemental Table 1 ). “Structural” is meant to convey the “totality of ways” in which societies foster unjust isms through “mutually reinforcing systems” that can variously involve “housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care, and criminal justice” ( 8 , p. 1453) and also marriage law, family law, identity documents, and property ownership ( 13 , 21 , 67 ). These laws, rules, and practices in turn “reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources” ( 8 , p. 1453). Structural injustice thus exists above and beyond—while also shaping—unjust interpersonal interactions and individual beliefs aligning with the isms at issue ( Table 1 ).
When it comes to the measurement of structural isms, however, more precision is required. Clarifying the different types and meanings of “structure” is crucial for accurate identification of etiology, accountability, and agency, and thus avenues for action.
One class of structural measures pertain to explicitly stated “rules of the game” ( 13 , p. 11) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). These rules can be articulated in explicit laws, policies, or algorithms, for which either government or nongovernmental institutions bear responsibility, thereby pointing to potential legal liability, claims for remedies or reparations, and alternative legislation ( 13 , 181 , 187 ). Well-known example include, in the United States, legally sanctioned white supremacy, black enslavement, and subsequent legal racial discrimination (i.e., Jim Crow laws) ( 1 , 4 , 56 , 151 ); legal and genocidal “racial hygiene” in Nazi Germany (informed by U.S. Jim Crow laws) ( 56 , 151 ); legal apartheid in South Africa (which also drew on U.S. Jim Crow laws) ( 56 ); the long-standing legal disenfranchisement of women in most countries around the world [women were first legally granted the right to vote, nationally, in New Zealand in 1893, and, most recently, in 2015, in Saudi Arabia, albeit only at the local level ( 184 )]; national laws in 72 countries (as of 2017) that prohibit same-sex relationships ( 34 ); and a new US federal policy, under legal challenge, that prohibits transgender persons from enlisting in the military ( 123 ).
Two potential limitations involving these types of structural measures concern inadequate measure of exposure and also correlated exposures. First, health equity studies using these types of metrics typically focus on the presence of such rules; less attention, if any, is given to assessing whether or how these rules are (selectively) enforced, such that important variations in actual exposures may be overlooked ( 13 , 66 , 181 ). Second, health equity studies typically focus on rules for solely one type of ism, and while this approach may sometimes be warranted, often the ideological orientation of state policies means that rules for related adverse isms travel together ( 13 , 35 ); a potential corrective could be inclusion, as covariates, of indices that capture multiple related policies ( 13 , 35 ).
Other times, the laws or rules deliberately do not name the targeted groups, e.g., because it is illegal to do so, but nevertheless discriminate adversely, by design or effect ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). Two classic examples from the United States, designed to target African Americans without the relevant laws naming this group explicitly, include ( a ) the War on Drugs ( 1 , 75 ) and its links to mass incarceration, both of which have been a focus of health equity research ( 140 , 195 ), and ( b ) voter suppression, whether by (now outlawed) poll taxes and literacy tests or by (still legal) partisan gerrymandering, restrictive voter ID laws, and limits on times and places to vote ( 4 , 151 ), which by contrast has received scant attention in health equity research ( 88 ). A newer form of nonexplicit rule-based discrimination is discrimination-by-algorithm, whereby algorithms applied to biased data yield biased predictions, as has occurred with machine learning, big data, and institutional decisions regarding employment, criminal sentencing, mortgage approval, and medical care ( 63 , 148 , 168 ). In both cases, the anti-ism measures needed to counter these types of injustice require explicit use of ism-conscious rules to protect the targeted groups ( 1 , 4 , 70 , 148 , 168 , 187 ).
Other measures appearing in the health equity research literature that are also referred to as structural do not directly assess actual rules (whether explicit or implicit), but instead comprise area-based or institutional measures regarding legacies and indicators of inferred rule-based structural injustice ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). Most commonly, such measures employ population-based data and quantify the difference (relative or absolute) between the targeted group and the privileged group in relation to one or more specified social outcomes, e.g., group differences in income, education, employment, home ownership, residential segregation, political representation, policing, mass incarceration, access to transportation, access to reproductive health services, proximity to toxic waste sites or polluting industries or facilities, etc. ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). The measures used, to date, in health equity research have been highly heterogeneous, rendering comparison of results across studies difficult. They also have thus far been limited by reliance on data that are publicly available and which can be stratified by the relevant social groups. Also potentially of interest, but not yet used in quantitative population-based health equity research, are area-based metrics for exposure to public monuments that support unjust isms (e.g., in the United States, monuments supporting the Confederacy) and also, as anti-isms, the removal of these monuments as well as their replacement by public art that exposes the unjust isms ( 23 , 82 , 136 , 172 ).
Additional area-based measures newly being used in health equity research seek to measure social norms regarding isms by employing survey or Internet data ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Table 3 ). Caution is required, however, given ( a ) well-known biases (especially underreporting) in self-report survey data on adverse discriminatory attitudes ( 10 , 92 , 99 , 145 , 154 , 157 ) and ( b ) fast-rising fraudulent postings online, especially on hot-button isms, to foment political divisions ( 30 , 148 ). An alternative approach, not subject to these biases but apparently not yet used in population-based health equity research, involves audit studies, i.e., investigations that send identical resumes—or identically dressed people of similar body build—to potential employers or landlords; in such studies, the applicants differ solely in their racial/ethnic or gendered appearance or couple status (e.g., single, same-sex couple, heterosexual couple) ( 118 , 145 , 154 , 167 ). Another newly employed approach in health equity research is to use area-based implicit bias data ( 137 , 152 ); however, an important caveat concerns how selection bias can affect who voluntarily seeks out and takes such Web-based tests (e.g., mainly highly educated and affluent persons) ( 18 , 22 , 201 ). Together, these types of area-based measures provide evidence solely about what is termed statistical discrimination (i.e., statistical evidence of group differences inferred to arise due to unjust processes but absent explicit evidence of motivation), and while such evidence may not meet legal standards that require proof of intent ( 3 , 174 ), it can still usefully inform and galvanize action for equity.
Which types of structural measures can be used depend on societal and historical context. A key consideration is whether the type of injustice at issue is legally under contest.
Consider, first, the case of adverse racial residential segregation in the United States. Its contours were shaped by US federal and state laws and policies, translated into official maps, that mandated neighborhood residential racial segregation and disinvestment both in and outside Jim Crow states from the 1930s to the mid-1960s, after which such legal racial discrimination was nationally outlawed ( 55 , 135 , 170 ). Given the post-1965 lack of variation by place or time in laws permitting racial discrimination in housing, health equity studies have relied primarily on area-based indicators that are inferred to reflect the impact of historical legal adverse racial residential segregation and also current illegal racial discrimination. Such indicators have variously pertained to neighborhood composition (e.g., racial/ethnic, income) and conditions (e.g., physical environment, housing stock), intergenerational transfers of wealth and impoverishment as tied to home equity, and political power as tied to voting districts and voting facilities ( 4 , 8 , 58 , 99 , 135 , 157 , 192 , 196 ). Only with the recent unearthing and digitization of the original 1930s maps ( 55 , 170 ) has it become possible for health equity researchers to start to investigate the long-term impacts of the original legal discrimination on both neighborhood trajectories and health inequities (79, 130, 135; N. Krieger, E. Wright, J.T. Chen, P.D. Waterman, E.R. Huntley, M. Arcaya, unpublished data; N. Krieger, G. Van Wye, M. Huynh, P.D. Waterman, G. Maduro, W. Li, R.C. Gwynn, O. Barbot, M.T. Bassett, unpublished data).
By contrast, present-day legal and policy conflicts over, say, same-sex marriage and civil unions ( 19 , 34 ), and over the rights of transgender and third-gender persons (e.g., travesties in South America, hijras in India, and muxes in Mexico) ( 19 , 34 , 47 , 190 , 193 ), render it feasible to analyze the contemporaneous health impacts of the explicit rules at issue. The same holds, in relation to sexism, for current conflicts over laws and policies regarding sexual harassment ( 81 , 86 , 149 , 204 ), gender-based violence ( 24 , 86 , 133 , 188 ), and sexual and reproductive rights and health, e.g., regarding access to contraception, abortion, or inclusive health care for sexual or gender minorities, or policies regarding pregnancy and parental leave ( 13 , 24 , 53 , 59 , 62 , 67 , 68 , 86 , 144 , 181 ).
Regardless of the type of structural measure employed, careful thought needs to be given to both the comparison groups ( 101 , 173 ) and the etiologic period ( 14 , 97 ). Also at issue is the extent to which people are legally able to move in order to benefit from or avoid policy changes ( 13 , 135 ). Contrasts can include ( a ) comparisons of the health of the targeted groups before and after the law or policy goes into effect in their polity; ( b ) within-polity changes in the magnitude of health inequities comparing the targeted and privileged group, before or after the policy change; and ( c ) cross-sectional comparisons of either the health status of the targeted group or the magnitude of the health inequities between the targeted group and the privileged group across polities that differ in the relevant law or policy. Short-term (or even cross-sectional) temporal comparisons may be apt for outcomes with a short etiologic period (e.g., psychological distress); if longer etiologic periods are involved, time lags must be considered ( 13 , 97 ).
An especially important consideration concerns the long-term life course and intergenerational realities of embodied harm. What may seem “long ago,” from a legal or policy standpoint, can be but an instant in terms of biological generations ( 97 , 104 , 107 ). Jim Crow laws, for example, were decreed illegal in the United States in 1964 ( 1 , 4 , 151 ). However, anyone born in the United States who, in 2019, is age 55 or older was born when Jim Crow was the law of the land, and any child of theirs is the child of a person who potentially experienced this all-encompassing form of structural racism ( 2 , 83 , 101 ). The handful of health equity studies on Jim Crow and its abolition demonstrate its relevance to rates of infant mortality, premature mortality, and current risk of more lethal types of breast cancer ( 2 , 70 , 83 , 101 , 102 , 106 , 107 ). It is this understanding of embodied history that health equity researchers can bring to their choice of measures of isms.
Despite the importance of structural conditions shaping people's exposures, the most commonly used measures in health equity research on isms and health nevertheless are individual-level explicit self-reports of exposure to discrimination (whether as a target or a witness) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Tables 1–3 ). Other individual-level metrics, used less frequently, include implicit measures of exposure to discrimination and measures of internalized oppression.
As discussed at length in other recent reviews ( 12 , 89 , 98 , 99 , 121 , 141 , 142 , 157 , 158 , 196 ), in the case of racism, heterosexism, and gender binarism, most studies rely on self-report explicit measures. These measures typically assess if the exposure has occurred; in which context (e.g., at work, in a public setting, at school, from the police or in the courts, online, getting medical care, etc.); with what intensity, chronicity, and duration of exposure (including age at onset); and also how the exposed person responds (e.g., from resistance to internalization) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Tables 1–3 ). By contrast, for sexism, measures more typically pertain to phenomena that can be conceptualized as actualizing beliefs and practices emblematic of sexism, e.g., sexual harassment (especially at work, but also in public settings) ( 31 , 103 , 150 , 204 ), gender-based violence, and control over sexual and reproductive rights and health ( 24 , 77 , 86 , 99 , 133 , 139 , 161 , 188 ) ( Tables 2 , 3 ; Supplemental Tables 1–3 ).
As with any self-report measures, caveats abound ( Table 2 ). First, self-reported measures can express only what people are willing and able to say ( 92 , 99 ), as shaped by fear, social desirability, trauma, internalized oppression, and lack of knowledge ( 10 , 33 , 98 , 145 , 154 , 157 ). Moreover, members of the privileged group may claim reverse discrimination when confronted by potential diminishment of prior privilege ( 99 , 144 , 165 , 191 , 200 ); health equity studies that include members of the privileged groups could—but rarely do—employ relevant measures of resentment [e.g., racial resentment ( 191 ) or hostile sexism ( 164 )] to aid interpretation of results. Self-reported experiences of discrimination, moreover, are typically analyzed solely as a psychosocial stressor ( 12 , 89 , 92 , 98 , 99 , 121 , 141 , 142 , 157 , 158 , 196 ), even as some exposures (e.g., unfair policing) pose physical, not just psychosocial, risks ( 1 , 52 , 75 , 98 ).
Pointing further to limitations of a solely psychosocial focus, consider the case of wage discrimination, which can harm people's health by causing material (economic) harm ( 92 , 99 , 155 , 174 ). Notably, in the United States, the workplace is among the most commonly self-reported sites for racial, gender, and anti-LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) discrimination ( 99 , 147 ). It is difficult, however, for employees to know if wage discrimination is occurring. Why? The answer is not simply social norms. Rather, it is currently legal in only 15 of the 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia, for employees to share information about their wages ( 198 ). Not surprisingly, several recent high-profile wage discrimination suits in the United States have been started by plaintiffs who accidentally discovered the pay stubs of fellow workers who were paid higher wages for the same job ( 120 , 199 ). Also not surprisingly, research has found that states with legally protected transparency about wages have the lowest within-job-title gender wage inequities ( 85 ). Thus, where rules govern what individuals cannot know, it is likely that structural measures will outperform self-report data as a measure of exposure.
Additional concerns about self-report measures, discussed at length in other literature ( 11 , 27 , 99 , 121 , 157 , 196 ), pertain to whether questions should refer explicitly to discrimination [as per the Experiences of Discrimination measure ( 110 , 111 )] or to unfair treatment [as per the Everyday Discrimination Scale ( 196 , 197 )], or should solely name the behaviors at issue. Even in research on sexual harassment and gender-based violence, for which the consensus is to focus on behaviors (with no explicit mention of abuse or sexism), controversies abound over which behaviors, enacted by whom, against whom, should count, and how best to counter fears and internalized blame that contribute to underreporting ( 133 , 188 , 204 ). Another problematic issue is that the discrimination and health literature contains numerous studies that employ solely one- or two-item instruments, despite well-known psychometric flaws affecting reliability and validity of instruments with so few items ( 12 , 44 , 99 , 141 , 142 ).

Work on these measures remains in its infancy.

Measures of anti-isms ( Table 1 ) conversely can assess, at the individual level, the extent of pride (and perhaps defiance) that persons in the targeted group feel about their group and their analysis of who discriminates against them and why ( 99 , 157 ); also germane, at the population level, are public demonstrations about, and the appearance of, public slogans regarding, say, LGBT pride or “black is beautiful” ( 74 , 127 , 176 , 187 , 190 ). As in the case of the self-report measures of exposure to discrimination, measures of internalized oppression and pride typically rely on explicit self-report instruments (with all the same caveats about self-report data) ( 44 , 99 , 157 ) or, less commonly, implicit measures ( 10 , 38 ).

Section: CHALLENGES AHEAD: KNOWLEDGE FOR ACTION TO END HEALTH INEQUITIES DUE TO UNJUST ISMS

As should be evident, the field of health equity research is ripe to improve measures of unjust isms, and anti-isms, to generate more powerful knowledge for understanding and for action to advance health equity. As part of moving the field beyond the preponderance of work using individual-level psychosocial measures, I would recommend the following actions:

I encourage you, the reader, to join in the collective efforts to take on these challenges, as one small part of the multifaceted, multisectoral work needed to advance health equity on a threatened planet.
