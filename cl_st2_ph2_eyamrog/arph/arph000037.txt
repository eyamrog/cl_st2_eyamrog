Section: ABSTRACT

Chronic disease prevention continues to be inadequate, overall and in achieving health equity, in spite of the many evidence-based practices and policies (EBPPs) available to address risk behaviors such as unhealthful eating, lack of physical activity, and tobacco use. Although clinical settings are needed for EBPPs that involve medical procedures such as immunization or early detection, dissemination of EBPPs can be effective in a variety of settings such as schools and childcare centers, worksites, social service organizations, and religious organizations. More implementation research is needed to meet challenges of effective application of EBPPs in such community settings, in which primary missions, capacity, cultures, and values do not focus on health services delivery. To address health equity, consideration of social and economic contexts of people reached in these settings is essential. This review presents lessons learned from past studies to guide future implementation research and practice across diverse settings and geographies.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and obstructive lung diseases, affect nearly two-thirds of Americans at some point during their life course and have a staggering impact on individuals, health care systems, and communities across the globe ( 25 , 68 ). Referred to in global health as the major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), these four diseases cause the majority of deaths globally, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries ( 68 ). In the United States, these diseases are responsible for $3.6 trillion in total annual costs (inclusive of lost economic productivity); projections estimate continued increases in the coming decades ( 60 , 136 ).
Public health efforts over more than four decades have focused on promoting behaviors such as healthy eating, physical activity, and tobacco use cessation, which are known to help prevent these chronic diseases ( 39 ), and there have been many successes in reducing risk behaviors and chronic disease rates. Notable among these successes is the decrease in cigarette smoking from 42% in 1965 to 14% in 2019 ( 30 ). Successes related to healthy eating and physical activity have been fewer, with most of the US population still far from meeting evidence-based recommendations ( 123 , 143 ) and little or no success in addressing the high prevalence of overweight and obesity ( 2 , 54 ). Prevention is especially important for populations that have relatively higher chronic disease risks associated with poverty or racial/ethnic discrimination and factors that pose barriers to social and economic determinants of good health such as access to medical care, housing, transportation, and employment ( 19 ). Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease risk factors and outcomes are well documented and tend to persist even when overall profiles of risk factors and outcomes improve. Therefore, prevention must be a major component of efforts to achieve health equity in this arena, for both children and adults ( 11 , 140 ).
In light of the availability of many applicable evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs) ( 35 ; https://ebccp.cancercontrol.cancer.gov/index.do ), the limited success in chronic disease prevention and related efforts to achieve health equity reflects a gap between knowledge about which interventions can work and knowledge about how to disseminate and effectively implement these interventions in populations at large ( 48 , 65 ). The science of how to close this gap, known as implementation research , has advanced substantially in the past decade but is still far from adequate—not only in quantity, but also in reach ( 129 ). This review focuses on the potential for implementation research in community settings to reduce the burden of these diseases through organizational and systems-level changes. Our objectives are to ( a ) provide a brief overview of key principles and characteristics of implementation research; ( b ) summarize evidence from studies of implementation of EBPPs outside of health settings; ( c ) synthesize common challenges to implementation research; and ( d ) highlight lessons learned from previous research to guide future prevention and equity-focused research and practice efforts.

Section: IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH

Investigators have proposed numerous definitions of implementation research ( 49 , 107 ). For this review, we define implementation research as the study of the processes and factors that are associated with integration of evidence-based interventions within a particular setting (e.g., a worksite or school) ( 94 ). Implementation research often assesses whether the core elements of the original intervention are faithfully transported to a new setting, which is often less controlled than early phases of research, and how the intervention may need to be adapted to the local context . Central to implementation research, context is defined as the social, organizational, and external factors that influence the success of implementation, for example the characteristics of the individuals making up an organization; an organization's culture, climate, readiness for change, and financial constraints; and political influences ( 107 ). We use the term implementation research broadly to encompass a range of terms that are used differently according to funder and region of the world including “dissemination research,” “knowledge translation,” “population health intervention research,” or “scaling up research” ( 107 ).
Formal recognition of the need for a greater focus on implementation of EBPPs began about 20 years ago ( 28 ). The past few decades of inquiry have taught us several important lessons that are relevant for this review. Implementation research

The challenges posed by the emphasis on reaching populations that are socially disadvantaged include the social class and power gradients and, in many cases, racial/ethnic differences between researchers and the populations to be reached. Thus, the principle of involving stakeholders is especially important to create ownership and facilitate fit of an EBPP. Involving stakeholders can help researchers learn about and understand aspects of organizational context and obtain meaningful input based on the perspectives and experiences of organizational leaders, members, and/or clients who are insiders with a deep knowledge of the organizational context. Additionally, stakeholder input and buy-in are critical in implementation research, as stakeholders such as community health workers (CHWs), teachers, and social service providers are often asked to lead implementation efforts. Stakeholder input is particularly important for understanding the flow of research information from researchers to opinion leaders to individual recipients of EBPPs, which can influence the success of implementation efforts ( 50 ). This information can inform how messages about implementation are presented to opinion leaders and how the influence of opinion leaders can be leveraged to communicate about an EBPP in a manner that promotes an individual's willingness to engage with an EBPP.
Organizational dynamics and processes of change are critical considerations for implementation research ( 113 ). Any organization undertaking and possibly integrating a new program or policy is likely to undergo some type of operational change (i.e., modification in the way they carry out their activities or in what activities they undertake). Changes to organizational structures, such as who is accountable for program results, policies or schedules, or even physical facilities (e.g., to make room for children to exercise in a classroom), may also occur. Transformational changes (e.g., taking on a new role within a community) or relationships with external partnerships (i.e., interorganizational) are more difficult organizational changes. Organizational norms may also be affected, e.g., using stairs instead of elevators or policies about whether or when a person can smoke cigarettes. In discussing organizational change related to obesity prevention, organizational change has been conceptualized as a process involving several elements: identifying needs and opportunities, scanning and selecting intervention options, building capacity for implementation, and cycling between implementation and evaluation ( 113 ). This process can facilitate efficient EBPP implementation because it carefully considers the organizational context, allowing an EBPP to be selected that fits within the organization and is supported by strategies that leverage the organization's strengths and address barriers to implementation.
This complete process may not be possible in a specific implementation research project because of research characteristics or requirements. The EBPP may be preselected by the researcher or funder, the way the organization views their need for the program may influence cooperation at various levels, and timelines and resources might limit organizational capacity for implementation. In addition, data collection for evaluation may be burdensome, especially if it is focused on constructs or outcomes that are not perceived as relevant to the organization. These issues apply to clinical as well as community settings, but the variability across community settings may be greater because of the lack of intrinsic health mandates and the greater variability of community than clinical populations. Implementation research offers a set of methods to bring awareness to these issues, even when they cannot be fully addressed, to gain a full understanding of what works in these settings.
Progress toward better population health can be made by working outside of health settings ( 38 ). For example, much of the promise in curbing the obesity epidemic has come from improvements made through economic policies to tax sugar-sweetened beverages; city planning initiatives to improve zoning laws; active transportation opportunities; and school food programs ( 66 , 67 , 76 ). However, to date, much of the implementation research has been conducted in settings such as medical practices, hospitals, or medical or public health clinics, which have missions and revenue or funding streams for the delivery of health services ( 108 , 147 ). In the context of chronic disease prevention, using health industry settings is understandable and appropriate for those preventive EBPPs that involve medical procedures (e.g., human papillomavirus vaccinations or early detection of cancers), but doing so neglects the many opportunities for implementation research on policies and programs that can be delivered in other settings. These settings include faith-based organizations (FBOs), educational settings, social service organizations, municipal institutions (e.g., city planning, transportation), workplaces, and other organizations (e.g., recreational sport organizations) that influence individuals’ behaviors ( Figure 1 ) ( 86 ). We refer to these as community settings because, although they are otherwise very diverse, they have in common the lack of a medical or clinical focus and represent settings of daily life for most individuals.

Implementation research is needed to meet the challenges of effective application of EBPPs in community settings specifically because these organizations or institutions are often not designed for health-related programming but can be important complements to medical or health settings by either reinforcing or negating health behaviors. Implementation in these settings is challenging because it involves organizations for which primary missions, capacity, cultures, and values—even when compatible with health goals—do not prioritize or have internal or external accountability for health outcomes ( 148 ). Challenges relate to the diversity of such organizations within and across settings (i.e., the necessity of adapting evidence-based practices to a variety of settings and contexts) and to the need to obtain evaluation data on health-related metrics that are not obtained as part of the usual operations of the organization.
Arguably, the advantages of implementing EBPPs in community settings far outweigh the challenges. These settings are valuable for health promotion for many reasons, including their importance in influencing the everyday life of individuals and the often high frequency and long duration of people's contact with these organizations relative to time spent at health care and public health organizations ( Table 1 ). These settings are the authentic contexts that ultimately shape people's ability to meet their basic survival and psychosocial needs; patterns of eating and physical activity or inactivity; family lives and other social interactions; and, ultimately, the ability to prevent disease and promote health. From a health equity perspective, these settings have a major role in reaching populations who have disproportionate chronic and infectious disease risks precisely because of systemic societal factors that make access to basic survival needs and health improvement opportunities inequitable.

Previous reviews have highlighted that implementation research outside health settings is relatively underdeveloped compared with implementation research in clinical health care and public health settings ( 108 , 147 ). While implementation research is not specific to one type of setting or health outcome of interest, researchers must understand the particular opportunities and challenges of implementing EBPPs within and across diverse organizations ( Figure 1 ).

Section: EVIDENCE REVIEW

Table 1 provides examples of implementation research in the settings featured in this review. A summary of evidence from these settings follows. Where available, the focus is on knowledge gained from literature reviews, and individual studies are discussed as examples and for settings where reviews were not available.
FBOs are potentially ideal settings to promote health for many reasons related to the characteristics of the congregations they serve, the importance of FBOs in individuals’ lives, the potential to align with religious doctrines, and organizational characteristics, including physical space and social networks that can support EBPP implementation ( 17 , 72 , 79 , 111 , 112 , 118 , 131 , 137 ). FBOs have been engaged in many health-related efforts for adults, including healthful eating and physical activity promotion, diabetes prevention, and cancer screening ( 26 , 74 , 79 , 109 , 132 , 142 ).
Much of the research in FBOs has focused on African American/Black churches within the Christian faith, for example Body and Soul, which is an intervention set in African American churches to improve fruit and vegetable consumption ( 3 , 4 , 104 ). More recent work in FBOs has focused on Latino and Filipino American churches and Islamic religious settings ( 6 , 12 , 82 , 109 ).
Organizations in racial/ethnic minority communities may be skeptical about research participation because of awareness of historical abuses, such as the Tuskegee Study of Black men, or past experiences in which perceived long-term benefit to the community was low or nonexistent ( 14 , 26 ). As with any community engagement, relationships with leaders and members of a faith-based setting should be formed with recognition that “outsiders” generally and researchers in particular need to show understanding of and respect for the context, even when they are of the same ethnic group or faith.
FBOs vary significantly in characteristics relevant to implementing and sustaining health programs. Formative research is needed to understand the social and environmental contexts and to integrate tailored or adapted intervention or implementation strategies where appropriate, resulting in greater acceptability of the EBPP by the community and potential sustainability ( 26 , 109 , 142 ). Leadership support for health programs (e.g., gained through the use of a local advisory board), resource availability (i.e., physical, social, financial), and a good innovation–values fit ( 70 ) (i.e., how well the intervention fits FBO values) can influence implementation effectiveness and reach ( 12 , 82 ). In the sidebar titled Faith-Based Organizations: Opportunities for Partnerships, Empowering FBO Leaders, and Identifying Shared Values, we present an example of how data on barriers and facilitators were used to inform needed implementation strategies and recommendations for working within FBOs.
FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS: OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIPS, EMPOWERING FBO LEADERS, AND IDENTIFYING SHARED VALUES
Faith in Action was an evidence-based intervention that increased physical activity among church-going Latinas. Following the completion of the trial, qualitative interviews ( n = 58) with FBO leaders, community members, implementers (e.g., CHWs), community partners, organizational leaders, denominational leaders, and physical activity advocates were conducted to inform implementation strategies to scale up Faith in Action ( 7 ). Data suggest several promising implementation strategies to scale up Faith in Action: ( a ) health behavior change training for pastors and staff, ( b ) tailored/targeted messaging, and ( c ) development of local and national community collaborations.


Many programs in FBOs rely on lay CHWs to implement EBPPs, which is advantageous because they have existing connections within the FBO community, have insider knowledge, and are viewed as trustworthy sources of information. The literature we reviewed demonstrated that CHWs can effectively implement chronic disease prevention programs with fidelity. The programs delivered by CHWs can complement more advanced health care provided in clinical settings but should not be considered replacements. Because CHWs are not expected to have a health background, the quality of CHW trainings is critical to implementation success. Implementation fidelity may suffer if CHWs are not appropriately trained and supported to deliver health interventions ( 83 ). In-person trainings for CHWs that have been delivered in efficacy and effectiveness trials are not always feasible from a scalability perspective; thus other approaches such as asynchronous, self-paced online trainings can be used ( 62 ). Additionally, while CHWs are often volunteers, other supports such as compensation for their role in implementing a program may enhance implementation success ( 29 ).
Overall, the work conducted in FBOs highlights aspects of implementation research that can guide efforts in other settings: the importance of the local context, engaging stakeholders, involving CHWs, and providing appropriate training to support EBPP implementation. Ongoing implementation research studies will provide insights about the effectiveness of various strategies and outcomes that can inform future research approaches ( 82 , 83 ).
EBPPs focused on promoting healthful behaviors can be implemented in educational settings, not only to prevent chronic disease but also to improve academic achievement ( 71 ). There are various educational settings for children, adolescents, and young adults, including early care and education settings as well as primary, secondary, and higher education school programs. Many factors make educational settings appealing for health promotion, including the amount of time children and young adults spend in schools and the multiple levels of influence on behaviors (e.g., social environment, policy) ( 15 , 71 , 93 , 144 , 146 ). These settings are well-positioned to promote health equity; for example, programs delivered through educational settings can reach children who live in neighborhoods or family contexts that may not be able to provide supervised physical activity opportunities owing to space or safety considerations. However, few programs and policies conducted in these settings have been replicated widely or taken to scale, likely because of challenges such as lack of sufficient funds or alignment with priorities of school staff to implement voluntary programs with distal benefits amid academic objectives ( 78 ).
Numerous aspects of the organizational context of school settings have been identified as influential for initial adoption or sustainability of EBPPs, including the school's capacity and available resources to support continued implementation; staff issues related to turnover, motivation, and commitment; how well the EBPP is integrated or can be adapted to fit into the school's usual practices; and the broader state and local policy contexts for health promotion ( 59 , 90 ). Having a clear understanding of what is needed to support initial adoption and longer-term sustainment of an EBPP at the organizational level, along with sufficient plans for common scenarios such as staff turnover, can improve the potential for sustainability. For example, use of an EBPP may be improved if it is integrated with educational objectives that schools are paid to accomplish and on which they are evaluated. Information about the cost-effectiveness of EBPPs and implementation strategies can help support stakeholders’ decisions about which program to implement and how, which is especially important when working with lower-resource settings ( 36 ).
Much of the existing research in these settings has focused on strategies such as the use of behaviorally based educational materials, outreach, and educational meetings, as well as small incentives or grants and outreach visits to support implementation of a variety of EBPPs, such as programs delivered within classrooms and policies related to meal service and wellness ( 144 , 146 ). Similar to other approaches, trainings delivered online can facilitate widespread dissemination and implementation of teacher-delivered programs ( 119 , 145 ). In addition to implementing an EBPP in a school, another approach is to coordinate implementation of programs focused on a similar outcome (e.g., obesity) across multiple settings to impact children's health ( 61 , 122 ). This approach can be challenging because it requires the engagement of stakeholders across multiple organizations, all with different contexts and dynamics, but it has the potential to support implementation efforts in synergy with those in other settings (see the sidebar titled Using a Systems-Level Approach to Address Childhood Obesity: The TX Cord Study for additional details).
USING A SYSTEMS-LEVEL APPROACH TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY: TX CORD STUDY
The Texas Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (TX CORD) study examined the efficacy and feasibility of implementing both primary and secondary prevention approaches predominantly outside of clinical settings to tackle child obesity in low-income, diverse families with children aged 2–12 ( 61 ). Primary prevention approaches included programs with eating and activity strategies that establish healthy norms and social support and are implemented in early care and education (ECE) settings ( 122 ), elementary schools, and well-child visits at the primary care provider clinic. In contrast, secondary prevention approaches focused on children who already have overweight and obesity and who need more aggressive behavioral strategies and guidance. Secondary prevention programs focused on individual families ( 10 , 24 ) and included at least 26 h of contact delivered in community settings, such as the YMCA ( 97 ).
Lessons learned from this approach included the following:


Opportunities for future implementation research in educational settings include the specification and evaluation of processes and strategies used to modify organizational characteristics and/or support EBPP implementation. This information can help provide information about how implementation works, potentially leading to better adaptation for greater program fidelity ( 93 , 144 , 146 ). Ongoing implementation studies in schools are focusing on organization-level changes and outcomes, which can provide useful information about the changes needed to implement EBPPs optimally and processes for addressing the organizational context ( 91 , 135 ).
Social service organizations comprise a wide variety of agencies, including those focused on foster care and adoption, child development, community resource referrals, and nutrition assistance, that are broadly designed to increase social well-being of individuals, families, and communities ( 87 , 133 ). These organizations are important points of contact for socially disadvantaged populations, are often in frequent contact with the individuals they serve, and are an important bridge to connect individuals to other community resources, thereby making social service organizations important settings in which to implement chronic disease prevention EBPPs and to work toward health equity ( 9 , 87 ).
Most implementation research in social service organizations has focused on mental health and addressing social and economic needs (e.g., employment, food security) ( 87 ). Implementation research about chronic disease prevention in these organizations has focused on tobacco control and cancer screening referral in community resource referral agencies ( 23 , 73 , 130 ); healthy eating and physical activity in home visiting programs focused on children's development ( 116 , 125 ); and improvement in opportunities for healthy eating through charitable food systems ( 57 , 138 ). These lines of diverse research suggest a growing recognition of the role these settings can play directly in preventing chronic disease and indirectly by addressing social determinants of health, as part of organizations’ primary sets of services ( 87 ).
These studies present several key issues for future implementation research. The particular EBPP chosen should match or be designed to align with the organization's operational characteristics, e.g., their usual interaction with individuals, their reporting and quality control mechanisms, and their financial and other reward systems. Organizations that have a shorter-term interaction with individuals, e.g., food pantries, may be better suited to deliver brief programs to individuals or implement organizational-level programs and policies to operations or structures in support of chronic disease prevention ( 57 ). Conversely, organizations that have a more frequent, long-term interaction with individuals, e.g., home visiting programs or mutual self-help programs, could feasibly deliver individual-level health interventions that are embedded into their usual programming ( 125 ). This body of research also underscores the importance of considering implementation costs and measuring outcomes that align with the primary mission of the organization and are relevant to those in decision-making positions, e.g., local and national funding offices ( 87 , 89 ). Broadly, social service organizations are uniquely suited to disseminate and implement preventive EBPPs from a social determinants of health perspective. Implementation research in these organizations highlights a variety of successful approaches for integrating the organizational context and dynamics that can be used in other settings.
Considering that multiple factors influence an individual's health, evidence supports the implementation of EBPPs to optimize the built environment for chronic disease prevention. Numerous reviews have documented the positive effects of policies to improve components of the built environment, including zoning and land use, traffic safety, and active travel opportunities on eating and physical activity behaviors ( 8 , 46 , 47 ). In addition, the link between the built environment and opportunities to promote health equity is well documented ( 95 ); for example, safe, affordable transportation routes that offer access to jobs and services that enhance health are needed in low-income communities. City planners and transportation practitioners have been increasingly engaged in chronic disease prevention efforts, representing a transformational change for these organizations ( 34 , 47 , 113 ). However, aligning the work conducted by these organizations to design or redesign communities with the promotion of healthy behaviors is challenging because it requires coordinating multiple governmental departments with different organizational dynamics and policy makers who make decisions on the basis of data, such as cost and locally contextualized information, that are often not available for EBPPs ( 27 , 42 , 52 , 102 , 115 ).
With the knowledge of which aspects of the built environment can impact health, much of the work to improve the built environment has focused on engaging stakeholders and fostering interorganizational changes to support decision making for implementing preventive EBPPs in city planning and transportation settings ( 42 , 102 , 115 ). Promising solutions include ( a ) modifying organizational and interorganizational structures to share personnel between public health and planning teams to ensure that planning perspectives are considered throughout public health planning processes and ( b ) improving the collection of locally relevant data ( 27 ). In addition, identifying a broader array of strategies, i.e., moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach, can improve the fit between the planning and transportation strategy and the community. For example, in rural communities where mass transit is not cost-effective, the focus should be on other opportunities to improve active transportation that leverage the strengths of a rural community, such as the presence of cheaper land and the possibility of connecting trails to create a walkable or bikeable transportation network.
To complement the organizational-level strategies, national-level planning policies have been adopted that specifically provide guidance about implementing health-related programs, e.g., the UK National Planning Policy framework ( 27 ), which can incentivize city planning and transportation organizations to engage in EBPP implementation. A similar initiative is the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach endorsed by the World Health Organization, which calls on all levels of government to commit to disease prevention and health equity by systematically accounting for the health-related implications of policy decisions and avoiding unintended negative health-related consequences of policy decisions ( 121 , 141 ). This approach is facilitated by the presence of stable funding mechanisms, strong long-term political support, open communication channels, and legal obligations, whereas the perception of interorganizational collaboration as an extra task and siloed organizational structures were barriers to implementation ( 134 ). Identifying common ground, such as beneficial outcomes for physical activity and climate change, may facilitate implementation. To date, notable successes in city planning and transportation approaches to chronic disease prevention have relied heavily on interorganizational changes ( 27 ). Continued collaboration to implement policies to improve the built environment is needed.
Workplaces are a highly influential environment for the health of adults, similar to the influence that schools have on children's health, and can offer access to no- or low-cost EBPPs for employees at all levels and across the income spectrum. Employers have a number of reasons to support health promotion in their workplaces, e.g., health care cost to employers ( 56 ). Previous research has identified features of EBPPs and the workplace context that can influence implementation success. These features include the needs and motivations of employers and employees (e.g., the health concerns of employees), the physical structures of the workplace (e.g., employee workforce is mainly off-site), and the workplace's readiness and capacity for change ( 45 , 56 , 81 ). Related to these characteristics, smaller organizations and those in particular industries (e.g., retail) are less likely to implement workplace health promotion programs; thus, these have been the focus of recent workplace health promotion efforts ( 56 ).
Previous literature has described a variety of strategies that have been used to support implementation of workplace health promotion programs. Informational meetings, support of implementation from a program champion, and the presence of a wellness committee can improve implementation ( 20 ). Active dissemination of a program can also improve implementation, as in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Work@Health Program, which has been disseminated across the United States through various training and technical assistance formats (e.g., online, in-person, train-the-trainer) to small and medium-sized employers ( 32 , 75 ). Other approaches have focused on increasing the internal capacity for workplaces to implement programs independently ( 127 ).
Participation in workplace health promotion programs is often low, but several strategies have been used to engage workplaces in these programs. For example, the 10,000 Steps Workplace Challenge in Australia used microgrants to provide pedometers within the context of a well-known, state-funded physical activity promotion program. In addition to the provision of a financial incentive, the application process was easy, and the program was well known. With these strategies, the program achieved high adoption within nonmetropolitan and smaller workplaces, in which the organizational context may limit the ability to take on complex EBPPs ( 40 ). Also, engaging stakeholders within the organization in the research design, conceptualization, and implementation may facilitate participation and sustainability because stakeholders’ knowledge of the local context can guide implementation that appropriately addresses the organizational context ( 124 ). Implementation of workplace health promotion programs has demonstrated success in improving chronic disease-related risk factors in workplaces, and efforts to match implementation strategies with the organizational context can guide research in other areas.
Organizations focused on youth or community development programs (e.g., YMCAs, Boy Scouts of America, out-of-school programs) or sports and recreation programs are also important partners for implementing chronic disease and related EBPPs. These diverse organizations are potentially but not always present in all communities, and organizations that rely on public funding may not have sufficient funding to implement sport or recreation programs. The literature regarding these organizations is similarly heterogeneous, reflecting the variety in focus, structure, and capacity of these settings to implement EBPPs. Thus, we present several individual examples of implementation research in these organizations.
The Diabetes Prevention Program, a lifestyle modification program to prevent type 2 diabetes, has been disseminated widely across the United States in a variety of community settings such as the YMCA ( 5 , 139 ). The program has been adapted to improve uptake in various contexts, for example by condensing the program or embedding culturally appropriate foods and activities ( 126 ). Despite its wide dissemination, the reach of the program and its impact on health outcomes remain lower for individuals with low income and for racial or ethnic minorities ( 53 ). Additional work is needed to understand how best to optimize the program's implementation within a wider range of communities, for example, rural communities that do not have the same organizations present in their communities to implement these programs.
Additionally, out-of-school time programs administered through schools and organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America, 4-H, or YMCA have been the focus of EBPP implementation. Several studies have reported favorable outcomes from the dissemination of various training modalities to improve implementation of healthy eating and physical activity programs ( 13 , 41 , 77 ); however, evidence of the sustained impact of these efforts on children's physical activity is modest ( 13 ).
An emerging body of implementation research has focused on chronic disease prevention EBPPs in sports and recreation organizations, which have wide reach for children and adults. This research leverages existing social networks and peer coaches to implement EBPPs that align well with the organization, for example, implementing a weight loss program through soccer or hockey clubs to promote weight loss in men ( 64 ). Evidence about effective strategies to improve the implementation of EBPPs in sports and recreation organizations is limited ( 84 ); however, these organizations represent an important group for the focus of future research.
FBOs are potentially ideal settings to promote health for many reasons related to the characteristics of the congregations they serve, the importance of FBOs in individuals’ lives, the potential to align with religious doctrines, and organizational characteristics, including physical space and social networks that can support EBPP implementation ( 17 , 72 , 79 , 111 , 112 , 118 , 131 , 137 ). FBOs have been engaged in many health-related efforts for adults, including healthful eating and physical activity promotion, diabetes prevention, and cancer screening ( 26 , 74 , 79 , 109 , 132 , 142 ).
Much of the research in FBOs has focused on African American/Black churches within the Christian faith, for example Body and Soul, which is an intervention set in African American churches to improve fruit and vegetable consumption ( 3 , 4 , 104 ). More recent work in FBOs has focused on Latino and Filipino American churches and Islamic religious settings ( 6 , 12 , 82 , 109 ).
Organizations in racial/ethnic minority communities may be skeptical about research participation because of awareness of historical abuses, such as the Tuskegee Study of Black men, or past experiences in which perceived long-term benefit to the community was low or nonexistent ( 14 , 26 ). As with any community engagement, relationships with leaders and members of a faith-based setting should be formed with recognition that “outsiders” generally and researchers in particular need to show understanding of and respect for the context, even when they are of the same ethnic group or faith.
FBOs vary significantly in characteristics relevant to implementing and sustaining health programs. Formative research is needed to understand the social and environmental contexts and to integrate tailored or adapted intervention or implementation strategies where appropriate, resulting in greater acceptability of the EBPP by the community and potential sustainability ( 26 , 109 , 142 ). Leadership support for health programs (e.g., gained through the use of a local advisory board), resource availability (i.e., physical, social, financial), and a good innovation–values fit ( 70 ) (i.e., how well the intervention fits FBO values) can influence implementation effectiveness and reach ( 12 , 82 ). In the sidebar titled Faith-Based Organizations: Opportunities for Partnerships, Empowering FBO Leaders, and Identifying Shared Values, we present an example of how data on barriers and facilitators were used to inform needed implementation strategies and recommendations for working within FBOs.
FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS: OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERSHIPS, EMPOWERING FBO LEADERS, AND IDENTIFYING SHARED VALUES
Faith in Action was an evidence-based intervention that increased physical activity among church-going Latinas. Following the completion of the trial, qualitative interviews ( n = 58) with FBO leaders, community members, implementers (e.g., CHWs), community partners, organizational leaders, denominational leaders, and physical activity advocates were conducted to inform implementation strategies to scale up Faith in Action ( 7 ). Data suggest several promising implementation strategies to scale up Faith in Action: ( a ) health behavior change training for pastors and staff, ( b ) tailored/targeted messaging, and ( c ) development of local and national community collaborations.


Many programs in FBOs rely on lay CHWs to implement EBPPs, which is advantageous because they have existing connections within the FBO community, have insider knowledge, and are viewed as trustworthy sources of information. The literature we reviewed demonstrated that CHWs can effectively implement chronic disease prevention programs with fidelity. The programs delivered by CHWs can complement more advanced health care provided in clinical settings but should not be considered replacements. Because CHWs are not expected to have a health background, the quality of CHW trainings is critical to implementation success. Implementation fidelity may suffer if CHWs are not appropriately trained and supported to deliver health interventions ( 83 ). In-person trainings for CHWs that have been delivered in efficacy and effectiveness trials are not always feasible from a scalability perspective; thus other approaches such as asynchronous, self-paced online trainings can be used ( 62 ). Additionally, while CHWs are often volunteers, other supports such as compensation for their role in implementing a program may enhance implementation success ( 29 ).
Overall, the work conducted in FBOs highlights aspects of implementation research that can guide efforts in other settings: the importance of the local context, engaging stakeholders, involving CHWs, and providing appropriate training to support EBPP implementation. Ongoing implementation research studies will provide insights about the effectiveness of various strategies and outcomes that can inform future research approaches ( 82 , 83 ).
EBPPs focused on promoting healthful behaviors can be implemented in educational settings, not only to prevent chronic disease but also to improve academic achievement ( 71 ). There are various educational settings for children, adolescents, and young adults, including early care and education settings as well as primary, secondary, and higher education school programs. Many factors make educational settings appealing for health promotion, including the amount of time children and young adults spend in schools and the multiple levels of influence on behaviors (e.g., social environment, policy) ( 15 , 71 , 93 , 144 , 146 ). These settings are well-positioned to promote health equity; for example, programs delivered through educational settings can reach children who live in neighborhoods or family contexts that may not be able to provide supervised physical activity opportunities owing to space or safety considerations. However, few programs and policies conducted in these settings have been replicated widely or taken to scale, likely because of challenges such as lack of sufficient funds or alignment with priorities of school staff to implement voluntary programs with distal benefits amid academic objectives ( 78 ).
Numerous aspects of the organizational context of school settings have been identified as influential for initial adoption or sustainability of EBPPs, including the school's capacity and available resources to support continued implementation; staff issues related to turnover, motivation, and commitment; how well the EBPP is integrated or can be adapted to fit into the school's usual practices; and the broader state and local policy contexts for health promotion ( 59 , 90 ). Having a clear understanding of what is needed to support initial adoption and longer-term sustainment of an EBPP at the organizational level, along with sufficient plans for common scenarios such as staff turnover, can improve the potential for sustainability. For example, use of an EBPP may be improved if it is integrated with educational objectives that schools are paid to accomplish and on which they are evaluated. Information about the cost-effectiveness of EBPPs and implementation strategies can help support stakeholders’ decisions about which program to implement and how, which is especially important when working with lower-resource settings ( 36 ).
Much of the existing research in these settings has focused on strategies such as the use of behaviorally based educational materials, outreach, and educational meetings, as well as small incentives or grants and outreach visits to support implementation of a variety of EBPPs, such as programs delivered within classrooms and policies related to meal service and wellness ( 144 , 146 ). Similar to other approaches, trainings delivered online can facilitate widespread dissemination and implementation of teacher-delivered programs ( 119 , 145 ). In addition to implementing an EBPP in a school, another approach is to coordinate implementation of programs focused on a similar outcome (e.g., obesity) across multiple settings to impact children's health ( 61 , 122 ). This approach can be challenging because it requires the engagement of stakeholders across multiple organizations, all with different contexts and dynamics, but it has the potential to support implementation efforts in synergy with those in other settings (see the sidebar titled Using a Systems-Level Approach to Address Childhood Obesity: The TX Cord Study for additional details).
USING A SYSTEMS-LEVEL APPROACH TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY: TX CORD STUDY
The Texas Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (TX CORD) study examined the efficacy and feasibility of implementing both primary and secondary prevention approaches predominantly outside of clinical settings to tackle child obesity in low-income, diverse families with children aged 2–12 ( 61 ). Primary prevention approaches included programs with eating and activity strategies that establish healthy norms and social support and are implemented in early care and education (ECE) settings ( 122 ), elementary schools, and well-child visits at the primary care provider clinic. In contrast, secondary prevention approaches focused on children who already have overweight and obesity and who need more aggressive behavioral strategies and guidance. Secondary prevention programs focused on individual families ( 10 , 24 ) and included at least 26 h of contact delivered in community settings, such as the YMCA ( 97 ).
Lessons learned from this approach included the following:


Opportunities for future implementation research in educational settings include the specification and evaluation of processes and strategies used to modify organizational characteristics and/or support EBPP implementation. This information can help provide information about how implementation works, potentially leading to better adaptation for greater program fidelity ( 93 , 144 , 146 ). Ongoing implementation studies in schools are focusing on organization-level changes and outcomes, which can provide useful information about the changes needed to implement EBPPs optimally and processes for addressing the organizational context ( 91 , 135 ).
Social service organizations comprise a wide variety of agencies, including those focused on foster care and adoption, child development, community resource referrals, and nutrition assistance, that are broadly designed to increase social well-being of individuals, families, and communities ( 87 , 133 ). These organizations are important points of contact for socially disadvantaged populations, are often in frequent contact with the individuals they serve, and are an important bridge to connect individuals to other community resources, thereby making social service organizations important settings in which to implement chronic disease prevention EBPPs and to work toward health equity ( 9 , 87 ).
Most implementation research in social service organizations has focused on mental health and addressing social and economic needs (e.g., employment, food security) ( 87 ). Implementation research about chronic disease prevention in these organizations has focused on tobacco control and cancer screening referral in community resource referral agencies ( 23 , 73 , 130 ); healthy eating and physical activity in home visiting programs focused on children's development ( 116 , 125 ); and improvement in opportunities for healthy eating through charitable food systems ( 57 , 138 ). These lines of diverse research suggest a growing recognition of the role these settings can play directly in preventing chronic disease and indirectly by addressing social determinants of health, as part of organizations’ primary sets of services ( 87 ).
These studies present several key issues for future implementation research. The particular EBPP chosen should match or be designed to align with the organization's operational characteristics, e.g., their usual interaction with individuals, their reporting and quality control mechanisms, and their financial and other reward systems. Organizations that have a shorter-term interaction with individuals, e.g., food pantries, may be better suited to deliver brief programs to individuals or implement organizational-level programs and policies to operations or structures in support of chronic disease prevention ( 57 ). Conversely, organizations that have a more frequent, long-term interaction with individuals, e.g., home visiting programs or mutual self-help programs, could feasibly deliver individual-level health interventions that are embedded into their usual programming ( 125 ). This body of research also underscores the importance of considering implementation costs and measuring outcomes that align with the primary mission of the organization and are relevant to those in decision-making positions, e.g., local and national funding offices ( 87 , 89 ). Broadly, social service organizations are uniquely suited to disseminate and implement preventive EBPPs from a social determinants of health perspective. Implementation research in these organizations highlights a variety of successful approaches for integrating the organizational context and dynamics that can be used in other settings.
Considering that multiple factors influence an individual's health, evidence supports the implementation of EBPPs to optimize the built environment for chronic disease prevention. Numerous reviews have documented the positive effects of policies to improve components of the built environment, including zoning and land use, traffic safety, and active travel opportunities on eating and physical activity behaviors ( 8 , 46 , 47 ). In addition, the link between the built environment and opportunities to promote health equity is well documented ( 95 ); for example, safe, affordable transportation routes that offer access to jobs and services that enhance health are needed in low-income communities. City planners and transportation practitioners have been increasingly engaged in chronic disease prevention efforts, representing a transformational change for these organizations ( 34 , 47 , 113 ). However, aligning the work conducted by these organizations to design or redesign communities with the promotion of healthy behaviors is challenging because it requires coordinating multiple governmental departments with different organizational dynamics and policy makers who make decisions on the basis of data, such as cost and locally contextualized information, that are often not available for EBPPs ( 27 , 42 , 52 , 102 , 115 ).
With the knowledge of which aspects of the built environment can impact health, much of the work to improve the built environment has focused on engaging stakeholders and fostering interorganizational changes to support decision making for implementing preventive EBPPs in city planning and transportation settings ( 42 , 102 , 115 ). Promising solutions include ( a ) modifying organizational and interorganizational structures to share personnel between public health and planning teams to ensure that planning perspectives are considered throughout public health planning processes and ( b ) improving the collection of locally relevant data ( 27 ). In addition, identifying a broader array of strategies, i.e., moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach, can improve the fit between the planning and transportation strategy and the community. For example, in rural communities where mass transit is not cost-effective, the focus should be on other opportunities to improve active transportation that leverage the strengths of a rural community, such as the presence of cheaper land and the possibility of connecting trails to create a walkable or bikeable transportation network.
To complement the organizational-level strategies, national-level planning policies have been adopted that specifically provide guidance about implementing health-related programs, e.g., the UK National Planning Policy framework ( 27 ), which can incentivize city planning and transportation organizations to engage in EBPP implementation. A similar initiative is the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach endorsed by the World Health Organization, which calls on all levels of government to commit to disease prevention and health equity by systematically accounting for the health-related implications of policy decisions and avoiding unintended negative health-related consequences of policy decisions ( 121 , 141 ). This approach is facilitated by the presence of stable funding mechanisms, strong long-term political support, open communication channels, and legal obligations, whereas the perception of interorganizational collaboration as an extra task and siloed organizational structures were barriers to implementation ( 134 ). Identifying common ground, such as beneficial outcomes for physical activity and climate change, may facilitate implementation. To date, notable successes in city planning and transportation approaches to chronic disease prevention have relied heavily on interorganizational changes ( 27 ). Continued collaboration to implement policies to improve the built environment is needed.
Workplaces are a highly influential environment for the health of adults, similar to the influence that schools have on children's health, and can offer access to no- or low-cost EBPPs for employees at all levels and across the income spectrum. Employers have a number of reasons to support health promotion in their workplaces, e.g., health care cost to employers ( 56 ). Previous research has identified features of EBPPs and the workplace context that can influence implementation success. These features include the needs and motivations of employers and employees (e.g., the health concerns of employees), the physical structures of the workplace (e.g., employee workforce is mainly off-site), and the workplace's readiness and capacity for change ( 45 , 56 , 81 ). Related to these characteristics, smaller organizations and those in particular industries (e.g., retail) are less likely to implement workplace health promotion programs; thus, these have been the focus of recent workplace health promotion efforts ( 56 ).
Previous literature has described a variety of strategies that have been used to support implementation of workplace health promotion programs. Informational meetings, support of implementation from a program champion, and the presence of a wellness committee can improve implementation ( 20 ). Active dissemination of a program can also improve implementation, as in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Work@Health Program, which has been disseminated across the United States through various training and technical assistance formats (e.g., online, in-person, train-the-trainer) to small and medium-sized employers ( 32 , 75 ). Other approaches have focused on increasing the internal capacity for workplaces to implement programs independently ( 127 ).
Participation in workplace health promotion programs is often low, but several strategies have been used to engage workplaces in these programs. For example, the 10,000 Steps Workplace Challenge in Australia used microgrants to provide pedometers within the context of a well-known, state-funded physical activity promotion program. In addition to the provision of a financial incentive, the application process was easy, and the program was well known. With these strategies, the program achieved high adoption within nonmetropolitan and smaller workplaces, in which the organizational context may limit the ability to take on complex EBPPs ( 40 ). Also, engaging stakeholders within the organization in the research design, conceptualization, and implementation may facilitate participation and sustainability because stakeholders’ knowledge of the local context can guide implementation that appropriately addresses the organizational context ( 124 ). Implementation of workplace health promotion programs has demonstrated success in improving chronic disease-related risk factors in workplaces, and efforts to match implementation strategies with the organizational context can guide research in other areas.
Organizations focused on youth or community development programs (e.g., YMCAs, Boy Scouts of America, out-of-school programs) or sports and recreation programs are also important partners for implementing chronic disease and related EBPPs. These diverse organizations are potentially but not always present in all communities, and organizations that rely on public funding may not have sufficient funding to implement sport or recreation programs. The literature regarding these organizations is similarly heterogeneous, reflecting the variety in focus, structure, and capacity of these settings to implement EBPPs. Thus, we present several individual examples of implementation research in these organizations.
The Diabetes Prevention Program, a lifestyle modification program to prevent type 2 diabetes, has been disseminated widely across the United States in a variety of community settings such as the YMCA ( 5 , 139 ). The program has been adapted to improve uptake in various contexts, for example by condensing the program or embedding culturally appropriate foods and activities ( 126 ). Despite its wide dissemination, the reach of the program and its impact on health outcomes remain lower for individuals with low income and for racial or ethnic minorities ( 53 ). Additional work is needed to understand how best to optimize the program's implementation within a wider range of communities, for example, rural communities that do not have the same organizations present in their communities to implement these programs.

Section: LESSONS FOR THE FIELD

Improving the use of EBPPs to prevent chronic disease through community settings has the potential to make meaningful gains toward chronic disease prevention and the promotion of health equity. This review highlights the many possibilities for implementing EBPPs in a variety of settings. Despite the heterogeneity in the characteristics of each of the settings, reviewing implementation research for chronic disease prevention across these settings allows us to synthesize similar lessons learned about conducting research in community organizations to advance implementation of EBPPs and chronic disease prevention. In addition, the lessons learned from this body of research are likely applicable to research about other health behaviors and diseases because many of the considerations for and challenges to conducting implementation research are independent of a health problem.
Here, we present several lessons learned from the literature reviewed. These lessons can be used to guide the formation and maintenance of strong partnerships between researchers and community organizations to implement chronic disease prevention EBPPs.
Regardless of the setting, successful engagement of the many stakeholders who influence or are affected by the implementation of an EBPP (e.g., leaders, program recipients) throughout all phases of implementation research is needed to foster organizational change and improve implementation efforts ( 100 , 114 ). Researchers should build an understanding of who the appropriate stakeholders are, which may differ by setting ( 26 , 27 , 43 , 108 ). Engaging stakeholders in implementation can help researchers understand the local context from an insider's perspective, understand the decision-making structures within an organization, and tailor messaging with stakeholders to highlight common ground between researchers and stakeholders ( 110 ).
Within community settings, forming partnerships that are built on trust requires careful attention, as practitioners in community settings and community members may be skeptical of working with researchers ( 14 , 33 ). Collaborating with local, state, and national partners or organizations can facilitate local partnerships, demonstrating to community organizations that the researcher is a trustworthy partner. The onus is on researchers to communicate the alignment of chronic disease prevention with the organization's priorities ( 33 , 148 ) and with the significant expertise that stakeholders bring to the partnership. The benefits to the organization may not come exclusively from health-related outcomes; for example, improvements in academic performance resulting from physical activity may be more relevant to a school than increases in physical activity effects on health or fitness ( 14 , 33 ).
The organizational structures and dynamics, e.g., decision-making processes, will dictate what types of organizational changes are needed to support EBPP implementation. For example, implementing a physical activity program in a school requires changes to the operations (programming) of the school, policy changes (e.g., use of campus facilities for activity before school), structural changes to modify spaces for increased activity, approval from school administrators, and buy-in from teachers asked to serve as program implementers ( 85 , 92 ). In other settings, city planners need to work with design or health promotion experts in the context of strong interorganizational partnerships to maximize opportunities for activity ( 27 ). The focus of implementation science on context and organizational processes is a strength that can be used to support researchers in thoughtfully assessing the local context in and priorities of an organization and in matching that context to implementation strategies tailored to the context ( 101 ).
Practical matters such as competing priorities within organizations (e.g., maintaining their core operations) and standard tenure and promotion criteria for researchers can make these partnerships difficult even when both sides are interested in working together. Evaluating researchers on societal as well as academic impact, i.e., factors beyond bibliographic output, can incentivize academics to engage in research with the organizations discussed in this article ( 98 ). While they are not a major focus of this review, issues related to cost-effectiveness and economics remain. Limited data on cost-effectiveness of programs and policies exist. Therefore, programs that produce that data should be a priority in future work. Also, identifying appropriate research funding and sustainable funding models to implement programs delivered by community members, for example CHWs, is crucial to the long-term success of implementation in many of these settings ( 99 ). Public–private partnerships between national funding organizations such as the National Institutes of Health and local organizations could support the implementation of programs and offer researchers an opportunity to study implementation issues such as cost and complex organizational change.
There is a need to better apply implementation research concepts, including strategies and outcomes ( 45 , 90 , 120 , 126 , 146 , 147 ) in diverse community settings. These concepts must be clearly articulated and evaluated systematically so that other researchers can translate findings and methods across these settings ( 69 ). For example, knowing what types of organizational changes are needed for CHWs to implement a healthy eating program (e.g., trainings provided) in churches can inform the implementation of a smoking cessation program in volunteer-run community-based organizations. Use of reporting standards and guidelines in future studies can facilitate these efforts ( 103 , 106 ). Issues related to implementation can also be incorporated into efficacy and effectiveness research, as the evidence for a program or policy is building. Hybrid approaches that examine effectiveness and implementation research questions simultaneously can accelerate the generation of important implementation evidence ( 37 ). Last, future research should focus more on changes that are maintained over time; few studies have assessed the sustainability of the changes implemented. It is likely that many more changes occur compared with those that persist, which may indicate that the positive benefits of implementation wane over time. However, different combinations of strategies may be needed during the initial adoption and implementation phase than those needed for sustaining a program or policy ( 1 ), and more work is needed to understand how to support implementation from adoption through sustainment.
Here, we present several lessons learned from the literature reviewed. These lessons can be used to guide the formation and maintenance of strong partnerships between researchers and community organizations to implement chronic disease prevention EBPPs.
Regardless of the setting, successful engagement of the many stakeholders who influence or are affected by the implementation of an EBPP (e.g., leaders, program recipients) throughout all phases of implementation research is needed to foster organizational change and improve implementation efforts ( 100 , 114 ).

Section: CONCLUSIONS

There are many rich opportunities to use implementation research to improve chronic disease prevention in community settings and to work toward health equity. Although the settings where implementation research is conducted vary, many of the successes and challenges to organizational change are shared across settings. A continued focus on rigorous, rapid, and relevant research that promotes organizational change can improve implementation research and facilitate the uptake and reach of EBPPs.
