Section: ABSTRACT

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is the cornerstone of the US nutrition safety net. Each month, SNAP provides assistance to 40 million low-income Americans—nearly half of them children. A number of changes could strengthen the public health impacts of SNAP. This review first presents a framework describing the mechanisms through which SNAP policy can influence public health, particularly by affecting the food security, the diet quality, and, subsequently, the health of SNAP participants. We then discusspolicy opportunities with the greatest potential to strengthen the public health impacts of SNAP, organized into three areas: ( a ) food production and distribution, ( b ) benefit allocation, and ( c ) eligibility and enrollment. For each section, we describe current policy and limitations of the status quo, suggest evidence-based opportunities for policy change to improve public health, and identify important areas for future research.

Section: INTRODUCTION

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers a suite of 15 nutrition assistance programs that are designed to provide supplemental food and nutrition education to income-eligible Americans. By far, the largest program in the federal nutrition safety net is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) [see the sidebar titled SNAP Authorization and Administration for a brief overview and see the Institute of Medicine SNAP adequacy report ( 63 ) for a comprehensive history of the program]. The sheer size and reach of SNAP offer an important opportunity to improve population health in the United States and its territories. With an annual budget of more than $65 billion ( 85 ), SNAP provides assistance to more than 40 million low-income Americans each month, nearly half of them children ( 32 ). SNAP participants receive benefits through the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, and these benefits can be used to purchase food and beverages at more than 240,000 authorized retailers across the country ( 132 ), with few restrictions on what can be purchased.
SNAP was originally developed to reduce food insecurity ( 71 , 79 ), which is associated with poor health outcomes ( 67 ), higher health care costs ( 11 ), and poverty ( 114 , 115 ). SNAP participation is estimated to reduce the likelihood of a household being food insecure by 30% ( 91 ), and in 2017 the program helped transition 3.4 million people above the poverty line ( 43 ). Because funding for SNAP is responsive to fluctuations in economic conditions, benefits are guaranteed to all eligible individuals and households who apply (see the sidebar titled SNAP and the US Economy).
SNAP AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION
The most recent Farm Bill (in 2018) has a cost of $428 billion over 5 years (fiscal years 2019–2023) and includes 12 titles of which nutrition is by far the largest, accounting for $326 billion or 76% of the total budget. SNAP represents the majority of the nutrition title and is authorized as open-ended, mandatory spending funded through annual appropriations laws.
SNAP is administered by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, which works with state agencies, nutrition educators, neighborhood and faith-based organizations, and the retail food community, among others. States and counties are responsible for determining whether an individual or household meets the program's eligibility requirements, as well as calculating and issuing monthly benefits. Through SNAP's statutes, waivers, and regulations, states also have the flexibility to implement policy and administrative options that better target benefits to those in need, improve program efficiency, and coordinate with other state-administered programs, but an Act of Congress is required to make changes to the statute.
SNAP AND THE US ECONOMY
SNAP is economically responsive, meaning that it is designed to rise and fall depending on the current economic climate. As a result, SNAP participation is countercyclical; participation rises during economic recessions and declines during fiscal expansions. In particular, SNAP participation is tightly linked to unemployment rates, with one analysis suggesting that each 1% increase in the unemployment rate results in a 5.6–6.3% increase in SNAP participation.
SNAP expenditures also stimulate economic activity during economic recessions. For example, every $1 billion in SNAP expenditures increased economic activity [gross domestic product (GDP)] by $1.79 billion. The same study found that $1 billion in SNAP expenditures resulted in 8,900 to 17,900 full-time-equivalent jobs plus self-employed. Substantial economic benefits were also found for nonfood purchases, agricultural GDP, and agricultural jobs. Between fiscal years 2007 and 2013, federal spending on SNAP more than doubled (from about 26 million to 48 million people) due to increased program participation following the recession.

In more recent years, SNAP goals have expanded beyond reducing food insecurity to include a greater focus on population health by improving participants’ diet quality and, in turn, improving health outcomes (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular risk factors and disease, and certain types of cancer) ( 40 ). An early milestone occurred in the 2008 Farm Bill, where SNAP was renamed from the Food Stamps Program to incorporate a more explicit focus on nutrition and help reduce stigma ( https://www.fns.usda.gov/about-fns ). Renewed approximately every five years, the Farm Bill is the primary agricultural and food policy legislative tool of the federal government and authorizes SNAP expenditures ( 74 ). Over the past decade and last three Farm Bills, a number of additional SNAP policy and programmatic efforts have aimed to improve diet quality and health outcomes ( Figure 1 ) and are highlighted throughout this review ( 18 , 40 , 76 ). These efforts represent important pivots that have tremendous potential to improve health among SNAP participants and potentially all consumers. However, many of these efforts, while innovative, reach only a fraction of SNAP participants; for example, SNAP-Education (SNAP-Ed), which we discuss further below, reaches only about 15% of participants ( 49 ). Additionally, SNAP policy changes intended to strengthen SNAP's public health impacts have often been slow and met with considerable opposition. For example, owing to concerns about increasing stigma, antipoverty advocates and others have resisted recent efforts to restrict SNAP purchases such as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) ( 16 , 19 , 89 ). There is also opposition from the food industry, which is directly impacted by SNAP (benefits account for ∼10% of all spending for food at home) ( 86 ).

This review presents a framework describing the mechanisms through which SNAP policy can influence public health, specifically by affecting the food security and diet quality of SNAP participants ( Figure 2 ). Leveraging this framework, we identify policy opportunities with the greatest potential to strengthen the public health impacts of SNAP and have organized our discussion into three areas: ( a ) food production and distribution (e.g., farmers, manufacturers, food packaging, retail), ( b ) benefit allocation (e.g., timing and frequency of benefit issuance, benefit adequacy), and ( c ) eligibility and enrollment (e.g., increasing participation in SNAP and other safety net programs, decreasing stigma). For each, we describe current policy and limitations of the status quo, suggest opportunities for policy change to improve public health, and identify important areas for future research. Evidence for this review was obtained from a number of sources, including peer-reviewed scientific research, gray literature, white papers, and websites of federal government agencies and nongovernmental organizations.

Section: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR STRENGTHENING THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS OF SNAP

Adapted from the advocacy coalition framework ( 95 ), Figure 2 shows a conceptual framework illustrating the mechanisms through which SNAP policy can influence public health, particularly by affecting the diet quality and food security of SNAP participants. The framework starts with coalitions of advocates, researchers, journalists, and interest groups, among others, who collaborate to influence decisions made by the president, Congress, the USDA, state/county/territorial/tribal governments, and the courts. These various government authorities take courses of action with direct and indirect impacts on SNAP, such as regulatory measures, laws, statutes, executive orders, and resource allocations (collectively, “policies”). We have identified three key areas in which these SNAP-relevant policy decisions can strengthen the program's public health impacts: ( a ) food production and distribution, ( b ) benefit allocation, and ( c ) eligibility and enrollment. In each of these three areas, policy decisions (or the lack thereof) may affect the knowledge, attitudes, resources, and behaviors of SNAP participants, which in turn can affect their diet quality and food security status and ultimately impact health outcomes ( 40 ). These relationships may be bidirectional; changes to individual behavior can also affect food production and distribution practices or decisions by government authorities, and decisions about benefit allocation can influence behaviors of food producers or distributors. For example, providing financial incentives for SNAP participants to purchase fruits and vegetables in farmers markets may increase local farm revenue, thus increasing the number of producers. Similarly, distributing benefits to all SNAP participants on a single day each month may cause retailers to increase prices in response to demand. Because other factors influence the SNAP policy subsystem, our conceptual framework includes external events, such as changes in population socioeconomic status, public opinion, elections, and elected officials’ initiatives such as promoting self-sufficiency, or other policy subsystems (e.g., Medicaid or immigration policy), as well as relatively stable parameters, such as governing structure, that may influence SNAP policy.

Section: POLICY OPPORTUNITIES, CHALLENGES, AND FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS TO STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF SNAP

This section suggests opportunities for policy change to strengthen the public health impacts of SNAP by improving the diet quality and food security of SNAP participants. Within each SNAP policy area (food production and distribution, benefit allocation, and eligibility and enrollment), we describe a public health problem, limitations of the status quo, and specific policy opportunities to improve health. Given the size of SNAP, policy modifications can foster substantial opposition, which often makes change difficult to implement. Table 1 summarizes these policy opportunities and recommendations for future research.

Section: FOOD PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

In this section, we consider the public health problem of poor diet quality. Eating patterns that are low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and high in sodium, added sugars, and solid fats are leading contributors to obesity risk, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and many cancers ( 1 ). Although there have been small improvements over time, dietary quality of the average US adult, regardless of SNAP participation, consistently falls short of the national dietary guidelines ( 135 ). Individuals and households living below the federal poverty line—many of whom will interact with SNAP at some point in their lifetime ( 68 )—are less likely to meet the national dietary guidelines and will face higher diet-related chronic disease burdens than higher-income individuals ( 10 ). Thus, SNAP is well positioned to promote healthier eating patterns and mitigate health inequities by aligning its programs and policies with the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans . Similar changes have been made to other federal nutrition programs, such as the USDA National School Lunch Program and the USDA Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and have led to improvements in diet quality ( 42 , 110 ). Moreover, SNAP touches nearly a quarter of a million food retailers and provides billions of dollars in subsidies toward food purchases annually ( 85 , 132 ). Regulating the types of foods eligible for purchase with SNAP or the types of foods available and promoted in SNAP-authorized retailers has great potential to improve diet as well as health outcomes.
In the following section, we first consider the current policies in place related to allowable SNAP purchases, and then we consider the evidence that supports how restricting SSBs from SNAP purchases may improve diet quality.
SNAP benefits can be used to purchase any type of food or beverage, excluding alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, hot prepared food (e.g., rotisserie chicken), and nonfood items (e.g., pet food, soap, cosmetics) ( 132 ). Absent an Act of Congress, states interested in restricting which items can be purchased with SNAP benefits (such as SSBs and/or candy) must request a waiver from the USDA. Some states have requested such waivers (e.g., Minnesota, New York, Maine), but all have been denied ( Figure 3 ). In the case of Maine, the request was denied twice. To date and despite numerous recommendations ( 14 ), Congress has not allocated funds to conduct a pilot experiment examining the effects of restricting foods or beverages from SNAP purchases; therefore, research in this area is limited.

Evidence supports restricting SSB purchases with SNAP benefits, despite concerns that such a public health effort, viewed by some as paternalistic, might discourage participation by eligible participants and retailers ( 16 , 98 ). SSBs are among the most commonly purchased items by SNAP participants ( 45 ), and SNAP households spend about 10% of food dollars on SSBs ( 47 ). Evidence from simulation studies indicates that restricting SSB purchases in SNAP could significantly reduce SSB consumption by a daily average of 24 kcal per person, or 15% of calories from SSBs, and suggests that negative health consequences could be reduced, with a 2.4% decline in obesity prevalence, 1.7% decline in type 2 diabetes incidence, and the aversion of 52,000 deaths from myocardial infarction and stroke among SNAP participants in the next decade ( 8 , 9 ). Restricting SSB purchases may be most effective and acceptable when accompanied by incentives to increase healthy purchases (described in more detail in the next section). Evidence from the only randomized controlled trial (conducted among individuals eligible or nearly eligible for SNAP but not participating) found that pairing incentives for purchasing more fruits and vegetables with restrictions on the purchase of less nutritious foods (e.g., SSBs, sweet baked goods, candies) reduced daily intake and improved diet quality compared with individuals who made purchases with no restrictions or incentives ( 55 ). Important ethical arguments can be made on both sides of this policy debate, which have been well documented elsewhere ( 5 ).
SNAP participants do not pay sales tax on their purchases with SNAP benefits. Therefore, restricting the purchase of SSBs with SNAP benefits would require participants to use their own resources and pay a slightly higher price in states that tax SSBs, which is the majority of states ( 28 ). Because SNAP benefits for SSBs may only be partially fungible ( 58 ) (meaning that people would not entirely replace the benefit with their own money to purchase the beverages), restricting the purchase of SSBs with SNAP benefits would likely reduce the quantity purchased and, subsequently, the overall consumption of SSBs. For SNAP participants with no net income, for whom benefits provide 100% of food dollars, restricting the purchase of SSBs may have an even larger effect.
In the following section, we first consider the current policies in place related to incentivizing purchases of fruits and vegetables with SNAP benefits, and then we consider the evidence that supports how further incentivizing the purchase of fruits and vegetables may improve diet quality.
The 2008 Farm Bill provided mandatory funding for the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) to test point-of-purchase incentives delivered through the EBT system for fruits and vegetables (see the sidebar titled Federally Funded Initiatives). Building on the success of the HIP (a 30% rebate administered over one year on targeted fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruits and vegetables) ( 7 ), the 2014 Farm Bill provided $100 million in mandatory funding to establish the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program to support projects that offer SNAP participants financial incentives for fruits and vegetables at the point of purchase ( https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/FINI-Grant-Program ). Recently, the 2018 Farm Bill increased mandatory commitments to FINI to $250 million over 5 years and made the program permanent (Pub. L. 334, H.R. 115–661).
Incentivizing fruit and vegetable purchases through SNAP increases purchases and consumption of these foods (HIP increased fruit and vegetable consumption by approximately one-quarter cup), but more research is needed to maximize the impact of incentives on total diet quality ( 4 , 6 , 48 , 88 , 90 , 140 ). Evidence demonstrates the following key considerations regarding incentives: They have broader uptake and larger effect sizes when implemented in supermarkets compared with farmers markets or direct-to-consumer settings ( 7 , 90 ), they have higher utilization when administered electronically compared with vouchers/coupons, they do not seem to have an added effect when paired with nutrition education, they have little to no effect on the rest of the diet, and they are expensive to implement [HIP cost $4.4 million and the total estimated cost for implementing HIP nationwide is approximately $90 million over 5 years ( 7 )]. Most studies testing the impact of incentive programs for SNAP participants have been conducted in farmers markets, which have limited reach (e.g., Philly Food Bucks) ( 140 ). Expanding incentive programs to grocery stores (e.g., supermarkets, superstores) is important because these stores are where the large majority of SNAP benefits are spent ( 124 ). Therefore, grocery stores may be an effective way to increase the reach and use of fruit and vegetable incentives.
FEDERALLY FUNDED INITIATIVES
Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI): a grant program established in the 2014 Farm Bill to incentivize purchases of fruits and vegetables by SNAP participants; collaboratively administered by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).
Healthy Incentive Pilot (HIP): the 2008 Farm Bill authorized $20 million to fund pilot projects in the SNAP program to determine if point-of-sale incentives increased the purchase of fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.

In the following section, we first consider the current policies in place related to increasing the reach of SNAP-Education (SNAP-Ed) through policy, systems and environmental (PSE) focused interventions, and then we consider the evidence that supports how expanding PSE activities may improve diet quality.
SNAP-Ed is a federally funded grant program that builds partnerships with community organizations to help individuals and households participating in or eligible for SNAP lead healthier lives ( https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-education-snap-ed ). SNAP-Ed was expanded under the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act into a nutrition education and obesity prevention program that allowed funding to go toward policy (e.g., ordinances), systems (e.g., resource allocation), and environmental changes (e.g., observable changes in the built environment) ( 41 ). Only modest modifications to SNAP-Ed occurred during the 2018 Farm Bill, despite advocacy to strengthen the program. These modifications focus on improving coordination across the USDA by requiring an annual report of these efforts to Congress, electronic reporting systems to measure and evaluate projects and account for state administrative costs, and provision of technical assistance to state agencies and reporting on these efforts in an annual report to Congress.
PSE-focused interventions are among the most effective strategies for creating large-scale improvements to the food environment and addressing food security ( 107 ), which may lead to healthier eating patterns at a population level. Additionally, changes to PSE targets have the added benefit of improving the healthfulness of a variety of food-related settings (e.g., child care, schools, food retail outlets, government buildings) shared by SNAP participants and nonparticipants, potentially resulting in greater public health impact. Greater use of PSE approaches has the potential to expand SNAP-Ed's low reach from 15% of SNAP participants ( 49 ). PSE-focused interventions may be particularly effective in overcoming the barriers to direct education in rural areas, including recruitment, attendance, and population size ( 59 ). Moreover, PSE-focused interventions have great potential to complement direct education, the most common form of SNAP-Ed programming, given that individual behavior change is difficult to achieve without addressing the context in which people make decisions ( 49 ). While PSE approaches in SNAP-Ed hold promise, evidence on the impact of PSE expansion is limited and the uptake of this expansion varies widely by state ( 44 ). The ability and capacity of SNAP-Ed-implementing agencies to conduct, evaluate, and sustain PSE-focused interventions also vary ( 44 ). The Government Accountability Office recently reported that the USDA lacks information on whether SNAP-Ed is meeting its goals and recommended that the USDA improve how it gathers information on SNAP-Ed effectiveness, develop a formal mechanism for coordinating nutrition education across the department, and take steps to fully leverage the department's nutrition expertise for its nutrition education efforts ( 117a ).
In the following section, we first consider current policy toward regulating unhealthy food marketing in SNAP-authorized retailers, and then we consider the evidence that supports how creating regulation to limit unhealthy food marketing may improve diet quality.
Marketing of unhealthy food in stores accepting SNAP is not regulated. However, there is opportunity for the USDA Food and Nutrition Service to set standards for placement and promotion of foods and beverages through licensing requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers. More than 240,000 stores are currently authorized to accept SNAP benefits ( 128 , 132 ), with few requirements for licensing. SNAP-authorized retailers are currently required to either continuously stock a variety of staple foods in four categories (vegetables or fruits; dairy products; meat, poultry or fish; and breads and cereals) (criterion A) or ensure that at least 50% of total gross retail sales come from staple foods (criterion B) ( 125 ). The 2014 Farm Bill required the USDA to update the stocking standards for authorized SNAP retailers, requiring stores to increase their variety of stock (stores must stock at least seven varieties of staple foods in each of the four staple food categories and stock perishable foods in at least three categories) ( Figure 1 ).
While minimum stocking requirements are meant to ensure access to a variety of healthy food and beverage options at SNAP-authorized retailers, additional requirements related to price, placement, and promotion of these healthy foods and beverages—as well as restrictions placed on the promotion of foods and beverages of poor nutritional quality —has the potential to enhance the public health impact of SNAP, given that no standards exist for the quality of foods or beverages sold or how foods and beverages are promoted within a SNAP-authorized retailer. However, First Amendment considerations have thwarted meaningful efforts in the United States to regulate unhealthy food marketing ( 56 ).
Requiring healthy choice architecture—placing nutritious items, such as fruits and vegetables, in prominent positions in the store and placing unhealthy items in less prominent positions ( 20 )—may be an easy and cost-effective way to promote healthier food and beverage choices in SNAP-authorized retailers ( 113 ). Choice architecture is commonly used by food retailers to increase sales ( 105 ), and evidence indicates that the placement of products in high-traffic locations, such as at the checkout counter or on the ends of aisles, has a profound effect on food and beverage purchases ( 78 ). Currently, the majority of promoted foods and beverages are unhealthy ( 30 , 64 ), and some evidence shows that retailers target unhealthful food and beverage marketing toward SNAP participants at times of the month when benefits are received ( 75 ). Alternatively, choice architecture could be used to promote healthy items in SNAP-authorized retailers. For example, encouraging the elimination of unhealthy options (e.g., candy, soda) from checkout lanes can decrease impulse purchases of these items ( 3 ). Customers, especially parents with young children, may prefer these “healthy checkouts,” resulting in higher customer traffic compared with traditional checkouts ( 3 ). Strengthening requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers by restricting these stores from placing unhealthy options in highly visible locations, such as on the ends of aisles and at the checkout counter, would promote healthier purchases among all customers, not just those enrolled in SNAP. While the USDA has encouraged research in this area, field studies examining this approach among SNAP participants in a supermarket setting are limited ( 113 ), indicating a need for additional evidence.
In the following section, we first consider the current policies in place related to allowable SNAP purchases, and then we consider the evidence that supports how restricting SSBs from SNAP purchases may improve diet quality.
SNAP benefits can be used to purchase any type of food or beverage, excluding alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, hot prepared food (e.g., rotisserie chicken), and nonfood items (e.g., pet food, soap, cosmetics) ( 132 ).

Alternatively, choice architecture could be used to promote healthy items in SNAP-authorized retailers. For example, encouraging the elimination of unhealthy options (e.g., candy, soda) from checkout lanes can decrease impulse purchases of these items ( 3 ). Customers, especially parents with young children, may prefer these “healthy checkouts,” resulting in higher customer traffic compared with traditional checkouts ( 3 ). Strengthening requirements for SNAP-authorized retailers by restricting these stores from placing unhealthy options in highly visible locations, such as on the ends of aisles and at the checkout counter, would promote healthier purchases among all customers, not just those enrolled in SNAP. While the USDA has encouraged research in this area, field studies examining this approach among SNAP participants in a supermarket setting are limited ( 113 ), indicating a need for additional evidence.

Section: BENEFIT ALLOCATION

In this section, we consider the public health problem of food insecurity. Food insecurity is associated with adverse health outcomes (e.g., poorer general health, asthma, behavioral problems) ( 53 ) and is highly prevalent among SNAP participants ( 38 ). The problem of food insecurity manifests itself through the cyclical purchase and consumption patterns of SNAP participants. SNAP benefits are distributed to participating households once monthly, and most benefits are spent within the first week of receipt. As a result, many households run out of SNAP benefits in the last week of the benefit month ( 22 , 25 , 54 , 101 , 112 , 137 ), a problem associated with adverse health, educational, and other societal outcomes. Among SNAP adult participants, caloric intake is 10–25% lower, and the hospital admission rate for hypoglycemia among diabetics is 27% higher in the last week compared with the first week of the benefit month ( 99 , 101 , 116 , 137 ). Among SNAP child participants, standardized test scores are lower in the last versus first week of the benefit month, possibly owing to declines in diet quality and total energy intake as food becomes scarce ( 46 ). Two primary factors that may cause this cyclical pattern of food insecurity are the financial inadequacy of the SNAP benefit allotment and the effect of the psychological consequence of scarcity, which may make it more difficult to allocate food resources evenly over the course of the month ( 77 ).
In the following section, we first consider current policy for SNAP benefit allocation, and then we consider the evidence that supports how increasing the SNAP benefit allotment may improve food insecurity.
The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is the basis for determining the monetary value of SNAP benefits. Essentially, TFP assumes that households are preparing food from scratch (estimated at 13–16 h per week) ( 35 ) and that food prices do not vary across the contiguous 48 states. In fiscal year 2017, the average SNAP household received $245 in monthly benefits and the average SNAP household size was 2 people ( 31 ). In 2019, the maximum benefit for a family of four with no net income (for whom SNAP is expected to cover 100% of food costs) was $642, or about $160 per person per month ( 26 ).
Increasing the SNAP benefit allotment, which is not adequate ( 63 ), may meaningfully impact cyclical patterns of food insecurity. TFP has been criticized for not accounting for the time cost of food preparation, geographic variations in prices (except for Alaska and Hawaii, where it is adjusted upward), or the dietary diversity recommended consistently by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans ( 57 , 63 , 141 ). Experts argue that the amount of expected preparation time is unrealistic and not reflective of time use patterns in the United States ( 139 , 141 ); it has been estimated that households would require 40% greater benefits to meet the TFP ( 35 ). Moreover, growing evidence demonstrates substantial geographic variation in food cost ( 52 , 69 , 82 ). For example, one study estimated that households would need to spend an additional $2,520 per year in Boston and $3,165 per year in Philadelphia to meet the TFP for a four-person household ( 111 ), compared with the current allotment.
A range of historical and more recent legislative developments affect benefit adequacy ( 40 ) (see the sidebar titled Legislative Actions). The 2008 Farm Bill required SNAP to be calculated with reference to the cost of the low-cost food plan [H.R. Res. 1368, 116th Congr. (2019)], which would increase the size of the benefit, because it has a higher value than does the TFP. However, cost neutrality is a requirement linked to the TFP by statute. Thus, to increase the benefit size or link it to the low-cost food plan, participation or some other aspect of the net income formula would have to be restricted. The 2018 Farm Bill requires the USDA Secretary to reevaluate and publish the TFP every five years based on dietary guidance, food prices, food composition data, and consumption patterns (Pub. L. 334, H.R. 115–661).
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111–5, also called the Recovery Act): a stimulus package passed by the 111th US Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama; increased SNAP benefit levels between April 1, 2009, and October 31, 2013.
Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (Pub. L. 111–296, also called the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 2010): authorized funding for federal child nutrition programs and increased access to healthy food for low-income children; required that the USDA update stocking standards for SNAP retailers; required that retailers pay for EBT equipment; required state reports for restaurant meal programs for older adults, the homeless, and disabled SNAP participants; passed by the 111th US Congress and signed into law by President Obama.
Farm Bill (Pub. L. 115–334, also called the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, most recent): a comprehensive federal omnibus bill and the primary food and agricultural policy of the United States. Reauthorizes expenditures including provisions for nutrition assistance programs, which account for over 80% of spending in the 2018 Farm Bill; passed by the 115th US Congress, signed into law by President Donald Trump.

Evidence linking increased SNAP benefit allotment to diet quality and food security is mixed. One study found that the temporarily higher SNAP benefit amounts resulting from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) ( 118 , 130 ), which increased the average monthly benefit amount from $96 to $133 per person (an average increase of 14% per household) for about 4 years ( 94 ), successfully decreased food insecurity in low-income households by 2.2 percentage points and increased food spending in these same households by 5.4% ( 83 ). Reducing food insecurity is a critical ingredient to promoting self-sufficiency because improvements in food security alone could reduce health care expenditures (a major source of financial strain for SNAP households) ( 11 ). Other research found that the ARRA mitigated the decline in caloric intake over the month but had no effect on diet quality ( 116 ); however, benefits delivered through the USDA Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) did ( 50 ). Future research in this area should explore the impact of various increases to the benefit allocation on program participation, identify whether increasing the benefit allotment improves diet quality and health outcomes, and explore how the characteristics of where a person lives (e.g., proximity to grocery stores, food prices, urban versus rural areas) impact the adequacy of the SNAP benefit allotment.
In the following section, we first consider current policy about the frequency of SNAP benefit issuance, and then we consider the evidence that supports how modifying the frequency of SNAP benefit issuance may improve food insecurity.
The frequency of benefit issuance refers to the number of times SNAP participants receive benefits each month. This is distinct from the timing of benefit issuance, which refers to the day of the month on which SNAP participants receive their monthly benefits. Current policy requires states to disburse benefits to each household once each month (“monthly issuance”) ( 127 ), but retail trade groups, public health experts, and antihunger advocacy organizations have urged Congress to allow states to pilot a twice monthly issuance schedule (“split issuance”). Adopting split issuance is feasible but, due to the 2008 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 110–234, H.R. 2419, 122 Stat. 923), such a change would require an Act of Congress. In addition to being unable to modify the frequency of benefit issuance each month, states are prohibited from piloting programs to test the effects of multiple benefit cycles per month.
As mentioned above, most SNAP benefits are spent within the first week of receipt, with many households running out of SNAP benefits in the last week of the benefit month ( 22 , 25 , 54 , 101 , 112 , 137 ). Issuing benefits more frequently (e.g., split issuance) could help participants’ spread consumption over the course of the month and, in turn, improve their nutrition and health. For example, one study ( 137 ) examined monthly cycles in food expenditure and food intake and found that infrequent shoppers (defined as one major grocery store trip per month) had an energy intake that fell from 83% to 73% of the recommended daily allowance from the first to the fourth week of the month, whereas frequent shoppers showed no significant difference in energy intake during the month. Another study ( 101 ) examined the change in caloric intake for SNAP households during the month and found that caloric intake declined by 10–15% over the month. The change to the frequency of SNAP issuance during the 2019 government shutdown suggests that adopting split issuance is achievable ( 40 ). During that period, benefits were issued twice in January to avoid a lapse in February, and most states issued March benefits earlier than usual to offset the “SNAP Gap” caused by the early issuance of February benefits ( 93 ). The USDA issued SNAP benefits likely in part owing to the legal right that individuals and households have to continued SNAP benefits during shutdowns of this nature ( 108 ).

The USDA issued SNAP benefits likely in part owing to the legal right that individuals and households have to continued SNAP benefits during shutdowns of this nature ( 108 ).

Section: ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT

In this section, we continue our discussion of food insecurity as a public health problem, now from the perspective of eligibility and enrollment. SNAP participation is not maximized, with a national average of 85% of individuals and households eligible for SNAP benefits receiving them ( 131 ). Across states, SNAP participation varies considerably from a low of 56% (Wyoming) to a high of 100% (Oregon, New Mexico, Vermont, Rhode Island, Washington, Illinois, and Michigan) ( 34 ). Only 42% of eligible older Americans and only 25% of eligible older Americans who live with others participate in SNAP ( 32 , 123 ). Participation is also low among individuals eligible for the minimum benefit (30%) ( 32 ). Concerns about stigma are a widely cited barrier to participation among those eligible for SNAP ( 2 , 65 , 66 , 70 , 72 , 80 ). SNAP participants have described feeling stigma in relation to the enrollment process (e.g., disrespectful treatment), personal and perceived societal views of program participation, and underlying issues related to race, gender, nationality, family structure, or age. Participation in other safety net programs is also not maximized among SNAP participants. For example, the vast majority of nonelderly individuals enrolled in SNAP are eligible for Medicaid ( 136 ), but only about three-quarters of SNAP households have at least one member receiving Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Because participation across safety net programs is not maximized and because resources are limited, families living below the federal poverty line often need to make trade-offs among food, medication, transportation, utilities such as heating, and housing, among other basic needs ( 13 , 138 ). These trade-offs can increase chronic disease risk [by encouraging a shift to less expensive foods, which are often higher in fat, salt, and sugar ( 100 )] or impede chronic disease management [by encouraging cost-related medication nonadherence such as skipping or reducing medication doses ( 97 )].
In the following section, we first consider current and proposed policy related to SNAP participation, and then we consider the evidence that supports how increasing SNAP participation may improve food insecurity.
A number of current policies and outreach practices impact SNAP participation. Uptake of broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE), which allows states to import higher income and asset limits from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) ( 92 ), may also contribute to variation in participation rates by state. Evidence suggests that BBCE simplifies the application process for potential SNAP participants and reduces administrative costs, without significant increases in eligibility ( 87 ). So far, 43 states have implemented BBCE ( 122 ). However, the USDA proposed a rule that essentially eliminates BBCE, despite a recent Farm Bill reauthorization process that considered but ultimately did not eliminate BBCE ( 126 ). The USDA-proposed BBCE rule is estimated to impact more than 3 million Americans and access to USDA school meals for more than 500,000 children who would no longer be directly certified or automatically eligible to participate in the USDA school meals programs ( 126 ). BBCE elimination would also impact a school's use of the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows a school to offer free meals to all students without collecting meal applications on the basis of the school area's SNAP eligibility numbers.
Citizens and documented noncitizen children or adult residents living in the United States for at least five years are eligible to participate in SNAP ( 129 ). However, immigration consequences for lawfully present noncitizens participating in SNAP, which did not exist previously ( 17 , 39 ), may negatively impact participation. That is, in August 2019, the Trump administration put forth a more expansive public charge rule that enables the Department of Homeland Security to deny a path to citizenship if immigrants (lawfully present or not) had participated in certain federal safety net programs, including SNAP ( 36 , 37 , 117 ; https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/ ). This new rule has the potential to significantly decrease participation in the safety net programs, likely exceeding the number of people who are subject to the rule (which is estimated to be 382,000 annually) ( 23 , 27 , 62 , 102 ). Evidence from welfare reform in the mid-1990s suggests that declines in participation, even among those who remain eligible, may be likely ( 15 ). A recent study by the Urban Institute highlighted fear and confusion about the proposed public charge rule and provided evidence that individuals and households are already reducing participation in federal assistance programs ( 12 ).
Another major SNAP participation policy was issued as a proposed rule earlier in 2019 by the USDA, aiming to strengthen the criteria for mandatory SNAP work requirements and significantly restrict state waiver allowance ( 121 ). Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD)—people between the ages of 18 and 49 who have no dependents and are not disabled—are currently eligible to receive SNAP benefits for three months in three years if they do not meet the 20-h work requirement ( 121 ). If work requirements are not met, the inability for this population to participate in SNAP may increase food insecurity ( 21 ). The Trump Administration's proposed ABAWDs rule is projected to impact more than one million individuals ( 33 ). Because the 2018 Farm Bill did not address work requirements, the 116th Congress is exploring legal options for responding to the proposed SNAP work requirements rule [H.R. Res. 6, 116th Congr. (2019)].
State-level differences in participation may result from differences in state-level SNAP policies that are either supportive or restrictive ( 106 ). Variation in each state's SNAP policy index is indicated by the numbers in Figure 4 , where scores range from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most accommodating to SNAP participation. These numbers generally suggest that states that have adopted SNAP-supportive policies (e.g., exempting vehicles from SNAP asset calculations, simplifying reporting, providing online applications, and adopting broad-based categorical eligibility) generally have more SNAP-eligible participation than do states without these policies ( 106 ). States with SNAP-restrictive policies (e.g., eligibility restrictions for adult noncitizens, short recertification periods, drug testing, and fingerprinting during the application process) tend to have lower levels of SNAP participation among eligible individuals and households ( 106 ).

With respect to addressing stigma in SNAP, there have been some programmatic changes in recent years, including the name change (from Food Stamp Program to SNAP) ( 89 , 119 ) and the switch from paper benefits (the food stamp booklet) to EBT cards. Various states have developed, implemented, and disseminated best practices for increasing participation and decreasing stigma, particularly at enrollment stages ( 120 ).
Evidence suggests that increasing SNAP participation will positively impact poverty reduction (see the sidebar titled SNAP Authorization and Administration), food insecurity, and health care burden. Indeed, research has generally demonstrated a relationship between SNAP participation and a reduction in food insecurity: One study showed a 10.6-percentage-point decrease in the prevalence of household food insecurity after six months of participation ( 71 ), and another suggested that SNAP participation reduces the likelihood of low food security by 31.2% and reduces the likelihood of very low food security by 20.2% ( 91 ). This effect extends to children, with the percent of households with food-insecure children decreasing by one-third after receiving SNAP benefits for six months ( 24 ). Given the considerable variation in SNAP participation by state ( Figure 4 ), expansion and increased adoption of policies (e.g., BBCE) that have been shown to improve SNAP participation are an important opportunity to improve public health ( 34 ).
Improving SNAP outreach and communication may help to decrease stigma and reduce misconceptions. Increased outreach through SNAP-Ed PSE efforts (as described above) might be one effective approach. For example, media messaging, such as on radio and television, has been effective in reaching large audiences, as well as in affecting attitudes and behavior ( 81 ). Such messages could serve the dual purpose of increasing overall awareness about SNAP and highlighting positive program outcomes among the general public and reaching the hard-to-reach, yet potentially eligible, populations—particularly as many decline to participate out of immigrant-related fears or confusion ( 51 ). This outreach and communication, in turn, might help to decrease the stigma associated with participation. Efforts by SNAP stakeholders (such as think tanks, legal aid organizations, or food banks) may also help to dispel potential stigma, especially among immigrants ( 133 ).
In the following section, we first consider current policies for encouraging SNAP participants to utilize other safety net programs, and then we consider the evidence that supports how encouraging participation in and strengthening partnerships with other safety net programs may improve food insecurity.
A person who participates in SNAP automatically meets the income eligibility for a number of other safety net programs such as Medicaid, WIC, National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and School Breakfast Program (SBP) (see also the sidebar titled Federally Funded Nutrition Assistance Programs). As noted earlier, the USDA has proposed to eliminate BBCE, which would decrease access to SNAP and programs for which participants are automatically eligible (e.g., NSLP) ( 126 ). To streamline enrollment and recertification, Congress has provided some options to use data collected by one safety net program in another, where participating in one program automatically confers eligibility for another (e.g., children are automatically eligible for free school meals if their household receives SNAP) or one program accepts an eligibility determination made by another program or information gathered through another program's application process (e.g., WIC considers applicants income-eligible if they receive Medicaid benefits). Linkages between safety net programs to promote cross-enrollment are also available to states as options through waivers or pilot projects. For example, there is currently a pilot under way—the Integrated Benefits Initiative—in five states to identify efficient and cost-effective ways to increase access to SNAP and Medicaid ( 29 ).
Improved health and reduced health care burden could potentially be improved by encouraging SNAP participants to receive the full package of safety net services for which they qualify. These income support programs likely interact to improve physical, mental, and financial well-being. For example, a recent Urban Institute study found that household participation in TANF, SNAP, or public health insurance substantially reduced episodes of financial hardship, food insufficiency, and unmet medical or dental need ( 73 ). In addition, participation in one safety net program may have cobenefits for another. For example, SNAP participation and higher benefit amounts have been associated with reduced hospitalizations, emergency department claims, inpatient expenditures, and nursing home admissions among Medicare and Medicaid enrollees ( 60 , 61 , 84 , 96 , 103 , 104 , 109 ). These data suggest that participation in multiple safety net programs may reduce utilization of costly health services, with a net positive effect on federal spending. Because the collective effects of these programs may be greater than any single one, maximizing program participation is essential ( 134 ).
FEDERALLY FUNDED NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
National School Lunch Program (NSLP): federally assisted meal program that provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children at public and nonprofit private schools and residential child-care institutions.
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): a federal block grant to states for the provision of supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education to low-income women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or nonbreastfeeding postpartum and to infants and children up to five years of age who are at nutritional risk.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as Food Stamps): the largest domestic hunger relief program and the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net. The federal entitlement grant provides monthly nutrition assistance through EBT that can be used by low-income individuals (with low-income defined as a maximum gross monthly income of 130% of the federal poverty level) and households to purchase nonalcoholic foods and beverages.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, formerly known as Welfare): a federal block grant designed to help families recover from temporary financial hardship. Recipients may qualify for assistance with food, housing, child care, job training, and other needs. TANF operates under different names in each state.

In the following section, we first consider current and proposed policy related to SNAP participation, and then we consider the evidence that supports how increasing SNAP participation may improve food insecurity.
A number of current policies and outreach practices impact SNAP participation. Uptake of broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE), which allows states to import higher income and asset limits from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) ( 92 ), may also contribute to variation in participation rates by state. Evidence suggests that BBCE simplifies the application process for potential SNAP participants and reduces administrative costs, without significant increases in eligibility ( 87 ). So far, 43 states have implemented BBCE ( 122 ). However, the USDA proposed a rule that essentially eliminates BBCE, despite a recent Farm Bill reauthorization process that considered but ultimately did not eliminate BBCE ( 126 ). The USDA-proposed BBCE rule is estimated to impact more than 3 million Americans and access to USDA school meals for more than 500,000 children who would no longer be directly certified or automatically eligible to participate in the USDA school meals programs ( 126 ). BBCE elimination would also impact a school's use of the Community Eligibility Provision, which allows a school to offer free meals to all students without collecting meal applications on the basis of the school area's SNAP eligibility numbers.
Citizens and documented noncitizen children or adult residents living in the United States for at least five years are eligible to participate in SNAP ( 129 ). However, immigration consequences for lawfully present noncitizens participating in SNAP, which did not exist previously ( 17 , 39 ), may negatively impact participation. That is, in August 2019, the Trump administration put forth a more expansive public charge rule that enables the Department of Homeland Security to deny a path to citizenship if immigrants (lawfully present or not) had participated in certain federal safety net programs, including SNAP ( 36 , 37 , 117 ; https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/ ). This new rule has the potential to significantly decrease participation in the safety net programs, likely exceeding the number of people who are subject to the rule (which is estimated to be 382,000 annually) ( 23 , 27 , 62 , 102 ). Evidence from welfare reform in the mid-1990s suggests that declines in participation, even among those who remain eligible, may be likely ( 15 ). A recent study by the Urban Institute highlighted fear and confusion about the proposed public charge rule and provided evidence that individuals and households are already reducing participation in federal assistance programs ( 12 ).
Another major SNAP participation policy was issued as a proposed rule earlier in 2019 by the USDA, aiming to strengthen the criteria for mandatory SNAP work requirements and significantly restrict state waiver allowance ( 121 ). Able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD)—people between the ages of 18 and 49 who have no dependents and are not disabled—are currently eligible to receive SNAP benefits for three months in three years if they do not meet the 20-h work requirement ( 121 ). If work requirements are not met, the inability for this population to participate in SNAP may increase food insecurity ( 21 ). The Trump Administration's proposed ABAWDs rule is projected to impact more than one million individuals ( 33 ). Because the 2018 Farm Bill did not address work requirements, the 116th Congress is exploring legal options for responding to the proposed SNAP work requirements rule [H.R. Res. 6, 116th Congr. (2019)].
State-level differences in participation may result from differences in state-level SNAP policies that are either supportive or restrictive ( 106 ). Variation in each state's SNAP policy index is indicated by the numbers in Figure 4 , where scores range from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most accommodating to SNAP participation. These numbers generally suggest that states that have adopted SNAP-supportive policies (e.g., exempting vehicles from SNAP asset calculations, simplifying reporting, providing online applications, and adopting broad-based categorical eligibility) generally have more SNAP-eligible participation than do states without these policies ( 106 ). States with SNAP-restrictive policies (e.g., eligibility restrictions for adult noncitizens, short recertification periods, drug testing, and fingerprinting during the application process) tend to have lower levels of SNAP participation among eligible individuals and households ( 106 ).

With respect to addressing stigma in SNAP, there have been some programmatic changes in recent years, including the name change (from Food Stamp Program to SNAP) ( 89 , 119 ) and the switch from paper benefits (the food stamp booklet) to EBT cards. Various states have developed, implemented, and disseminated best practices for increasing participation and decreasing stigma, particularly at enrollment stages ( 120 ).
Evidence suggests that increasing SNAP participation will positively impact poverty reduction (see the sidebar titled SNAP Authorization and Administration), food insecurity, and health care burden. Indeed, research has generally demonstrated a relationship between SNAP participation and a reduction in food insecurity: One study showed a 10.6-percentage-point decrease in the prevalence of household food insecurity after six months of participation ( 71 ), and another suggested that SNAP participation reduces the likelihood of low food security by 31.2% and reduces the likelihood of very low food security by 20.2% ( 91 ). This effect extends to children, with the percent of households with food-insecure children decreasing by one-third after receiving SNAP benefits for six months ( 24 ). Given the considerable variation in SNAP participation by state ( Figure 4 ), expansion and increased adoption of policies (e.g., BBCE) that have been shown to improve SNAP participation are an important opportunity to improve public health ( 34 ).
Improving SNAP outreach and communication may help to decrease stigma and reduce misconceptions. Increased outreach through SNAP-Ed PSE efforts (as described above) might be one effective approach. For example, media messaging, such as on radio and television, has been effective in reaching large audiences, as well as in affecting attitudes and behavior ( 81 ). Such messages could serve the dual purpose of increasing overall awareness about SNAP and highlighting positive program outcomes among the general public and reaching the hard-to-reach, yet potentially eligible, populations—particularly as many decline to participate out of immigrant-related fears or confusion ( 51 ). This outreach and communication, in turn, might help to decrease the stigma associated with participation. Efforts by SNAP stakeholders (such as think tanks, legal aid organizations, or food banks) may also help to dispel potential stigma, especially among immigrants ( 133 ).
In the following section, we first consider current policies for encouraging SNAP participants to utilize other safety net programs, and then we consider the evidence that supports how encouraging participation in and strengthening partnerships with other safety net programs may improve food insecurity.
A person who participates in SNAP automatically meets the income eligibility for a number of other safety net programs such as Medicaid, WIC, National School Lunch Program (NSLP), and School Breakfast Program (SBP) (see also the sidebar titled Federally Funded Nutrition Assistance Programs). As noted earlier, the USDA has proposed to eliminate BBCE, which would decrease access to SNAP and programs for which participants are automatically eligible (e.g., NSLP) ( 126 ). To streamline enrollment and recertification, Congress has provided some options to use data collected by one safety net program in another, where participating in one program automatically confers eligibility for another (e.g., children are automatically eligible for free school meals if their household receives SNAP) or one program accepts an eligibility determination made by another program or information gathered through another program's application process (e.g., WIC considers applicants income-eligible if they receive Medicaid benefits). Linkages between safety net programs to promote cross-enrollment are also available to states as options through waivers or pilot projects. For example, there is currently a pilot under way—the Integrated Benefits Initiative—in five states to identify efficient and cost-effective ways to increase access to SNAP and Medicaid ( 29 ).
Improved health and reduced health care burden could potentially be improved by encouraging SNAP participants to receive the full package of safety net services for which they qualify. These income support programs likely interact to improve physical, mental, and financial well-being. For example, a recent Urban Institute study found that household participation in TANF, SNAP, or public health insurance substantially reduced episodes of financial hardship, food insufficiency, and unmet medical or dental need ( 73 ). In addition, participation in one safety net program may have cobenefits for another. For example, SNAP participation and higher benefit amounts have been associated with reduced hospitalizations, emergency department claims, inpatient expenditures, and nursing home admissions among Medicare and Medicaid enrollees ( 60 , 61 , 84 , 96 , 103 , 104 , 109 ). These data suggest that participation in multiple safety net programs may reduce utilization of costly health services, with a net positive effect on federal spending. Because the collective effects of these programs may be greater than any single one, maximizing program participation is essential ( 134 ).
FEDERALLY FUNDED NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS
National School Lunch Program (NSLP): federally assisted meal program that provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to children at public and nonprofit private schools and residential child-care institutions.
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC): a federal block grant to states for the provision of supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education to low-income women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or nonbreastfeeding postpartum and to infants and children up to five years of age who are at nutritional risk.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as Food Stamps): the largest domestic hunger relief program and the largest program in the domestic hunger safety net. The federal entitlement grant provides monthly nutrition assistance through EBT that can be used by low-income individuals (with low-income defined as a maximum gross monthly income of 130% of the federal poverty level) and households to purchase nonalcoholic foods and beverages.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, formerly known as Welfare): a federal block grant designed to help families recover from temporary financial hardship. Recipients may qualify for assistance with food, housing, child care, job training, and other needs. TANF operates under different names in each state.


Section: CONCLUSIONS

The size and reach of SNAP create a number of opportunities to improve food security, diet quality, and subsequently population health through policy change. Three key areas of focus are changes to food production and distribution, benefit allocation, and enrollment and eligibility, each with specific policy opportunities supported by evidence that may help to improve diet quality for SNAP participants. Modifications to SNAP that can be made by states are an especially important area of focus because they may face less resistance to change than modifications made at the federal level. Policy alternatives that impact the broader food environment, and not just choices of SNAP participants, have the added benefit of promoting healthy choices among the general public. More research is needed to advance a robust evidence base to support policy change that aims to enhance the public health impacts of SNAP.
