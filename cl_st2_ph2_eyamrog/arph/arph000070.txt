Section: ABSTRACT

Homelessness is a devastating experience for children and their families. Families, the majority of whose members are children, now comprise more than one-third of the overall US homeless population. Most of these children are less than six years old. Various assumptions have driven policy and the allocation of resources to programs serving these families. Although decades of research and field experience suggest strategies for preventing and reducing this problem, perspectives differ, hindering the development of effective solutions. In this article, we explore some of these assumptions, including ( a ) definitions of homelessness used to count the numbers of families and determine resource allocation, ( b ) the needs of children and responses to the impact of adverse childhood experiences, and ( c ) whether services matter and should be integrated with affordable housing. We conclude by suggesting various directions to ensure that these children are protected and have the opportunity to grow and thrive.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Family homelessness has emerged as one of the most pressing public health problems in the United States. Families and their children now account for more than one-third of the overall homeless population, with half of these families residing in shelters ( 31 ). The families are largely composed of single mothers in their 20s with vulnerable young children, half of whom are under the age of six ( 6 , 10 , 30 ).
Structural problems underlie this growing social tragedy, including the nation's lack of decent affordable housing, the scarcity of housing vouchers, and difficulties with earning sufficient wages to meet the high cost of housing ( 47 , 52 , 71 ). Solutions are complex because homelessness is more than the loss of a house or apartment. It is also the loss of safety, reassuring routines, belongings, relationships, friends, pets, comfort, and privacy. Children are aware of their parents’ stress and the fragility of their circumstances, and they often experience chaos, alienation, and fear—not knowing where they will be sleeping or eating their next meal ( 5 , 28 ).
While ending family and child homelessness is a goal shared by service providers and advocates alike, considerable disagreement exists about how best to gather, interpret, and respond to basic data about these families and children. From a policy perspective, the most problematic differences include ( a ) how family homelessness is defined and, thus, how the numbers of families experiencing homelessness are calculated; ( b ) children's developmental needs and the extent to which effects on children contribute to a multigenerational cycle of homelessness; and ( c ) the provision of services integrated with affordable housing that prevents and ends homelessness. Many policy assumptions appear to be politically driven and prioritize available resources rather than making larger investments that will be more effective and less expensive over time. Until these disagreements are confronted and resolved, the numbers of families and children experiencing homelessness will continue to grow.
There is little disagreement that an adequate supply of affordable housing is the foundation for ending family homelessness ( 40 ). Therefore, we focus this review on policy assumptions about the definitions of homelessness, the numbers of families experiencing homelessness, the effects of homelessness on children, and the need for services to accompany housing that stabilize families and prevent recidivism.

Section: CONFLICTING DEFINITIONS AND COUNTING METHODS

The US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the nation's major funding source for states and communities working to address family homelessness. The methods that HUD uses to define family homelessness and to count the families have far-reaching effects on how many families are eligible for critical resources. HUD's definition of who is homeless is more restrictive than that of other federal agencies serving families and children. Its definition includes the following ( 21 , 53 , 59 , 60 , 68 ; Pub. L. 111–22 §1003):

Compared with that of many other federal agencies, HUD's definition excludes substantial numbers of families ( 53 , 68 ). This definition drives HUD's annual Point-in-Time (PIT) count of people who are homeless as well as funding allocation. The PIT count serves as the official number reported in HUD's Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress. Less restrictive definitions of homelessness used by other federal agencies arose from the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act, passed in 1987 as the first major federal response to homelessness. McKinney–Vento was reauthorized in 2009 as the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act and goes beyond the HUD definition to include (Pub. L. 111–22 §1003)

For many years, although advocates have urged the federal government to adopt the HEARTH definition across all agencies and services, HUD applies its definition of homelessness to conduct its yearly PIT count of who is homeless. This count is conducted on a single night in January by staff and volunteers from HUD's regional Continuum of Care (CoC) programs located in cities and counties nationally. Using the HUD definition, the PIT count excludes families who are precariously housed or doubled-up as well as regions where there are no CoCs.
The HUD PIT count has many methodological inconsistencies that challenge its accuracy ( 53 ). Across regions, different methods for collecting information are used, and volunteers are sometimes only modestly trained. The process is not standardized or monitored, allowing methods and results to vary according to how the count is conducted ( 53 ). Although the count often gathers additional information from HUD's Housing Management Information System (HMIS), which collects data on housing and services, use of HMIS is uneven across CoCs. Also, counting families in domestic violence shelters is encouraged by HUD; however, it is deemed optional, and the counting method is determined by each CoC in collaboration with their area domestic violence shelters ( 21 ).
Furthermore, the HUD PIT count misses families who are unseen, namely, those who live doubled-up, those who couch surf, or those who live in motels, hotels, or campgrounds ( 48 ). While PIT sporadically counts those living in motels or hotels, they are included only if considered to be shelter residents with no access to other spaces and the shelter or a government agency is paying the cost or if they live in an area where emergency shelters are unavailable ( 21 ).
Taken together, these limitations indicate that the PIT significantly undercounts and, therefore, misreports the scale of US homelessness. The most recent HUD PIT count reported that the numbers of homeless families with children “continued to decline, by two percent between 2017 and 2018, and by 23% between 2007 and 2018” ( 31 , p. 1). The report also claimed that 91% of these families were staying in “sheltered locations.” However, when surveyed, 85% of local service providers reported rising numbers ( 5 ), and data collected directly from providers estimated that PIT numbers may be 2.5 to 10.2 times lower than the actual numbers of all people experiencing homelessness ( 53 ). Similarly, a count conducted by the Wilder Foundation in Minnesota every 3 years calculates numbers that are up to 24% higher than the PIT counts ( 80 ).
Most striking is the difference between HUD's and the US Department of Education (DOE)’s counting approach in the numbers of children experiencing homelessness. DOE's count is conducted by local McKinney–Vento School Liaisons who report on the number of children identified as homeless in their districts. These numbers are aggregated every school year. Without going beyond the gross counts, the difference is apparent: HUD's 2018 AHAR reported that 111,592 individuals under age 18 were homeless, with more than 90% living in a shelter ( 31 ). For the 2016–2017 school year (i.e., the most recent data), DOE reported that more than 1.3 million school-aged students were homeless while attending public school ( 51 ). This is a tenfold difference between the HUD numbers and the DOE numbers. When children aged 0 to 6 years (i.e., those not yet in school) experiencing homelessness were added to the DOE numbers for the 2012–2013 school year, the total number of children under 18 experiencing homelessness that year exceeded 2.5 million or 1 in 30 children ( 4 ).
There is little doubt that the numbers of children in the United States who are experiencing homelessness have increased substantially over the last several decades. HUD's calculation methods should better match the actual numbers of children and families who are experiencing homelessness. Without accuracy of and agreement on how many families and children are homeless, adequate resources and care for those in need are lacking.

Section: THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN: BREAKING THE GENERATIONAL CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS

The needs of children experiencing homelessness have only recently drawn attention and coincide with the commitment by the US Interagency Council on Homelessness to end family homelessness by 2020 ( 77 ). Despite this lofty goal, the problem continues to grow because it is layered and multifactorial, involving inadequate units of affordable housing, insufficient availability of vouchers, family separation, food insecurity, and violence. In a single year, 97% of these children move up to 3 times, 40% attend at least two schools, and 33% experience a child protection investigation ( 28 ).
At the root of the problem of housing insecurity, but beyond the scope of this discussion, are systemic factors, such as poverty and racism. To break the multigenerational cycle of homelessness, the underlying issues must be addressed. However, the recognition of and response to the urgent needs of the children have been slow. With certain outstanding exceptions (see the section titled Integrating Best and Promising Services with Housing), the developmental needs of children have largely been ignored. Lack of resources, workforce limitations, and relative inadequacy of training have impeded progress. This must change.
To describe most effectively the impact of housing instability on children, we have separated this section into three broad interconnected categories—Environmental Exposures: Adverse Childhood Experiences, Parent–Child Relationships, and Children's Mental Health and School Success.
The impact of homelessness on children and their families is devastating, and the effects may be lifelong. Naturally, many children fear that they may not have a place to live or sleep, are dislocated from reassuring routines, and may be separated from their parents. This dynamic impacts young children during critical developmental periods. Many family members endure toxic stress; living in survival mode leads to constant physiologic arousal that, in turn, significantly influences thinking, problem-solving, coping with life events, and development of secure, trusting relationships. As expressed by Jack Shonkoff at Harvard University's Center for the Developing Child, “Early experiences affect the development of brain architecture, which provides the foundation for all future learning, behavior and health. Just as a weak foundation compromises the quality and strength of a house, adverse experiences early in life can impair brain architecture with negative effects lasting into adulthood” ( 16 ). Many of these children manifest physical, emotional, and academic difficulties.
At the same time, homeless children are not a homogeneous group. A subgroup of children demonstrates resilience in the face of adversity and weathers the vicissitudes of growing up in chaotic circumstances remarkably well. Huntington et al. ( 38 ) conducted a cluster analysis and found that some children function at a high level despite the adversities they face; however, this number dwindles as children get older and the stresses accumulate, indicating the necessity of prevention and early intervention.
Many of the circumstances of these young children are collectively referred to as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Children experiencing homelessness tend to have high ACE scores, which put them at greater risk for short- and long-term health and mental health problems. In 1998, Vincent Felitti, a primary care physician at the Kaiser Permanente health maintenance organization, conducted a landmark epidemiological study in collaboration with Robert Anda from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Surveying 13,494 Kaiser enrollees (largely middle and upper class, white, college educated, older employed adults with health insurance), investigators found that many of the participants experienced some combination of the following 10 adverse experiences during childhood: maltreatment (physical, sexual, or emotional abuse; physical or emotional neglect) and household dysfunction (mother treated violently, household substance abuse, household mental illness, family separation/divorce, incarcerated household member).
Using medical and mental health data from Kaiser, the researchers found a high correlation between multiple ACEs and long-term medical and behavioral disorders that occurred over a person's lifetime. In the original study by Felitti et al. ( 23 ), 64% of participants (primarily middle income and above) reported one ACE and 22% reported three or more. As the number of ACEs increased, the likelihood of individuals developing various health conditions also increased substantially, indicating a graded dose response.
The original ACE study has been extensively replicated in various populations in the United States and internationally, confirming the original results ( 23 ). For example, the CDC established a state-by-state surveillance system to monitor the ACEs in the general population (known as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System). More than half of the general population experiences at least 1 ACE, more than 25% experiences 2 or more ACEs, and 1 in 8 people experience 4 or more ACEs. Not surprisingly, ACEs are more prevalent in minority and low-income populations, the families most likely to experience homelessness. Children who live below the federal poverty level (FPL) are five times more likely to experience four or more ACEs than are those who live in financially stable households ( 29 ). Mothers who have high ACE scores tend to have children with high ACE scores.
Even in the short term, young children with high ACE scores (e.g., 4 or greater) are more likely to be anxious and depressed; have specialized health needs as well as cognitive, socioemotional, and behavioral health issues such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; and experience developmental delays ( 14 , 37 , 44 ). Even young people who never engage in high-risk behaviors but have high ACE scores are more likely to develop adverse outcomes.
Data indicate a clear association between the number of ACEs and an increased risk of later developing clinical depression, substance use disorders, suicidality, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases ( 15 , 18 , 22 , 26 , 42 , 45 , 46 , 64 ). More specifically, children who experience four or more ACEs develop twice the rates of cancer, heart disease, and stroke and four times the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when they become adults ( 22 , 42 , 64 ). They are also five to seven times more likely to develop substance use disorders and six times more likely to attempt suicide ( 15 , 18 , 45 ). In addition, very long shelter stays during critical developmental years compound the impact of the ACEs already prevalent in the lives of babies and children experiencing homelessness, further increasing the likelihood of developmental challenges, serious disease, disability, early death, and becoming homeless again ( 26 , 46 ).
These findings indicate that over time, ACEs take their toll. High numbers of ACEs are correlated with chronic stress that leads to increased autonomic nervous system response, altered homeostasis of multiple organ systems, decreased immune functioning, and sustained inflammatory response. These changes may account for the medical and mental health disorders observed in adolescence and adulthood. The unrelenting stress, coupled with struggling parents or caretakers who cannot (owing to their own stress, trauma, or mental health issues) nurture adequately, becomes toxic for these children ( 70 ). On an encouraging note, however, researchers have found that through neuroplasticity the brain can be rewired in response to positive learning and experiences, which suggests that early interventions, especially in young children, have the potential to moderate or even reverse the harmful effects of ACE-related trauma ( 44 ).
In addition to ACEs and other exposures, the health and well-being of children are inextricably linked to the health and well-being of their parents, especially when children are younger ( 28 ). Thus, providers must also assess and address the needs of parents. The quality of the parent–child relationship profoundly affects a child's relationships, the capacity for self-regulation, socioemotional development, and school performance ( 2 , 56 ). Among parents experiencing homelessness, the rate of depressive disorders is high, and traumatic stress among the mothers is nearly universal ( 63 ). Research indicates that untreated caregiver mental illness is often associated with child physical and emotional neglect and predicts greater adverse health outcomes among children ( 27 ). Abuse, neglect, and maternal depression can lead to elevated levels of stress hormones for the child, impacting brain development and the ability to develop adequate coping skills ( 41 , 55 , 57 ).
Mothers experiencing homelessness have much higher rates of major depressive disorders compared with the general population; the majority remain untreated. Approximately 12% of women from all socioeconomic groups are depressed, whereas 25% of women who are living in poverty and/or are ethnic/racial minorities experience depression; among low-income mothers of young children, and pregnant or parenting teens, that number rises to 40–60% ( 41 ); and for mothers experiencing homelessness, lifetime rates of depression range from 40% to 85% ( 3 , 10 , 78 ). Not only does depression interfere with obtaining and maintaining housing and services, but also it limits a mother's ability to become self-sufficient and to be an effective caregiver. Children living with a depressed parent have poorer medical, mental health, and educational outcomes as compared with those without a depressed parent.
Although depression is the most common mental health problem experienced by homeless mothers, they often also have anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use issues. According to data collected by the National Center on Family Homelessness, 92% of homeless mothers have experienced physical or sexual abuse, mostly in familial or intimate relationships ( 10 , 28 , 30 ). Given the extensive history of domestic violence for moms who become homeless, and given the unspeakable abuses they have endured often throughout their lifetimes, it is not surprising that their rates of PTSD are higher than for women in the general population. Many use substances to medicate their distress; more than half of adults experiencing homelessness have had suicidal thoughts or have attempted suicide ( 19 ). These problems further compromise their capacity to parent effectively, work consistently, and access appropriate services for themselves and their children ( 28 , 30 ).
Given the environmental factors, the difficulties experienced by caregivers , and the high rates of traumatic stress, many children in these challenging circumstances develop emotional and behavioral issues. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of mental illness in children experiencing homelessness documented that 10–26% of preschoolers had mental health problems serious enough to require further clinical evaluation ( 8 ). Among school-age children, this percentage increased to between 24% and 40%—a rate 2–4 times higher than that for poorly housed children aged 6–11 years (see the National Survey of America's Families). Developmental and maturational changes, coupled with accumulated stresses and traumatic circumstances, likely account for the higher rates as children get older.
Education is often considered the route out of poverty. However, the challenges faced by extremely poor, housing-insecure students are vast and difficult to overcome without services and support ( 4 ). Barriers include

Many children experiencing homelessness have academic difficulties manifested by poor performance, repeated suspensions, and high dropout rates. Less than 25% of students designated as homeless graduate from high school ( 4 ). Through no fault of their own, children experiencing homelessness encounter difficulties in school and develop mental health issues themselves, both of which contribute to involuntary perpetuation of this intergenerational cycle.
The impact of homelessness on children and their families is devastating, and the effects may be lifelong. Naturally, many children fear that they may not have a place to live or sleep, are dislocated from reassuring routines, and may be separated from their parents. This dynamic impacts young children during critical developmental periods.

Section: INTEGRATING BEST AND PROMISING SERVICES WITH HOUSING

Housing alone will not solve the problems of children experiencing homelessness. However, shelter providers and others in the field hotly debate the need for services despite the connections suggested by child development experts. When family homelessness began to emerge as a significant problem in the mid-1980s, the clarion call among advocates was “housing, housing, housing.” Adding services to the policy agenda posed the threat of diverting scarce resources from the dire need for affordable housing and possibly turning family homelessness solely into a mental health problem. It polarized housing versus services; limited research intensified this dichotomy. But there were additional reasons for the polarization. Stigma attached to mental health conditions remains high and discrimination is pervasive. Not until the emergence of data documenting high rates of trauma and the accompanying neuroscience related to traumatic responses did mental health issues become more acceptable. Unlike mental health that is often perceived as something intrinsic to the person, trauma emanates from external events, evokes empathy, and reduces the likelihood of blaming the victim.
Only recently have government and other agencies begun to acknowledge the necessity of comprehensive centralized assessments and integrating family-oriented best practices with housing to fully address the needs of parents and children. Now, the challenge involves how to mobilize the political will and financial support for training, workforce development, and resources that shift the emphasis from housing alone to housing plus services. Furthermore, implementation of promising and evidence-based practices has been slow and poorly standardized and is often a low priority—especially in shelters that have meager resources, few (if any) clinical staff, and unfavorable staff to resident ratios.
Research, field experience, and anecdotal information demonstrate the importance of integrating best practices with housing supported by long-term subsidies. Given the pressing needs of these children, the following services integrated with housing are essential. In addition to affordable housing and psychosocial assessment of family members, strategies and standards are needed to ensure that families and children have the opportunity to thrive and to become self-sufficient. The steps involve assessing parents and children, determining resources and staff capacity, training shelter teams about the children's developmental needs and the nature of traumatic stress, implementing organizational trauma-informed care, and mobilizing parenting supports adapted from the evidence-based home-visiting models. In addition, providing younger children with skills to foster resilience and adaptability enhances their likelihood of success. Herbers, Cutuli, and their colleagues ( 32 ) described tools, including positive parenting, self-regulation, and cognitive skills, that help children withstand or recover from the negative effects of homelessness.
We have selected programs that highlight the goals described in the sections above, have been widely used with promising outcomes, and/or have a scientific evidence base. Although this review focuses primarily on critical services for children, decent affordable housing remains the foundation for the solution. We begin, therefore, with a brief comment about housing.
Permanent housing is essential for ensuring the health, nutrition, well-being, and educational achievement of children. More than one-quarter (11.2 million) of the 43.8 million renter households are extremely low income and on the verge of homelessness ( 54 ). The common standard of affordability is 30% of a household's income, yet only an estimated 7.5 million rental homes are affordable, leaving a shortage of at least 3.7 million affordable units ( 54 ). In recent years, this situation has worsened. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “The severe shortage of affordable homes for extremely low-income renters is systemic, affecting every state and metropolitan area” ( 54 , p. 11). Extremely low-income households is defined as at or below 30% of area median income. Families with “worst case housing needs” who spend more than 50% of their income on rent are at extremely high risk of becoming homeless and have limited resources for other necessities such as heat, food, and health care ( 2 , 72 ).
In 2008, HUD launched the Family Options Study, which investigated the most effective housing and service interventions for ending family homelessness. Families ( N = 2,282) and children ( N > 5,000) from 12 communities were randomly assigned to one of the following interventions: ( a ) permanent housing subsidies with no supportive services attached; ( b ) project-based transitional housing; ( c ) community-based rapid rehousing; and ( d ) usual care, in which families had access to usual care homeless and housing assistance but did not have priority access to any particular program ( 75 ). The study followed families for three years and collected data at baseline, at 20 months, and again at 37 months. It found that permanent housing subsidies (e.g., housing choice vouchers) had the best overall outcomes, including reductions in subsequent homelessness, number of moves, school mobility, psychological distress, intimate partner violence, alcohol/drug use, and food insecurity ( 75 ).
While the study of housing interventions was comprehensive, the report gave far less attention to services and then, we believe, erroneously concluded that “homelessness is (only) a housing affordability problem that can be remedied with permanent housing subsidies without specialized homeless specific psychosocial services” ( 75 , p. 11). The report did not sufficiently stratify the type, frequency, and duration of services, with the exception of case management caseloads. Despite the findings that deep, long-term housing subsidies substantially benefited families and that rapid rehousing outcomes were similar to usual care but less expensive than long-term subsidies, Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary of Policy Development and Research at the time, concluded, “While we continue to seek more housing subsidies to help families experiencing homelessness, we must also recognize that rapid rehousing is proving to be the most cost-effective tool that we have available within the crisis response system” ( 76 ). Limited resources have taken precedence over the most effective approach documented by the Family Options Study.
The rates of trauma and violent victimization experienced by homeless mothers are clearly staggering. More than 90% of these women have been exposed to at least one serious traumatic stress event during childhood ( 10 , 30 ). Violence continues into adulthood; more than two-thirds of women in this group report severe physical assault by an intimate partner, with 27% requiring medical care ( 28 ). A longitudinal study of homeless families suggests that PTSD may be a primary driver of homelessness for many families ( 30 ). Failure to address the trauma experienced by homeless mothers may partly explain the very high rate of return to shelters by many rehoused families ( 39 ). PTSD and its associated disorders also compromise a parent's ability to parent effectively. These data indicate that trauma-informed care should be implemented in all family shelters.
Implementing trauma-informed care (TIC) often involves a cultural shift to a relational context at all levels of the organization ( 9 , 20 ). TIC is a strengths-based organizational approach in which all services are provided through a trauma lens ( 34 ). Establishing trusting, supportive relationships is the cornerstone for these services. TIC prevents retraumatization and creates opportunities for survivors to develop a sense of physical and emotional safety, control, agency, and self-efficacy, all of which increase the likelihood that families achieve residential stability and become self-supporting ( 12 , 34 ). All staff in an agency are trained to understand how trauma operates and how best to reduce triggers of post-trauma responses, encourage consumer choice, support empowerment, and level power differentials. With input, feedback, and involvement from service users, all practices and policies can be adapted to become trauma informed. Families can be empowered by being included in the governance process and having input into the design and implementation of services.
The indelible link between parent and child necessitates that to care for the child, we must care for the mother and/or father. This approach has two significant implications: first, address underlying trauma, depression, and other conditions of the parent; and second, implement solutions for the parent and child dyad, including parenting classes.
Most parents experiencing homelessness have unrecognized, undiagnosed, and untreated clinical depression. This is related to the assumption that feeling sad is expectable under the circumstances. Feeling sad and clinical depression are not equivalent. Minimizing or discounting this distinction can lead to a lack of psychosocial screening and assessment of parents experiencing homelessness. Both the assumption and the practice are unfair to the parents as well as their children. Mothers with untreated depression often have difficulty bonding with their children, parenting consistently, being attuned to their children's needs, and creating structure and predictable routines ( 36 ).
Research has documented that when mothers are treated for depression within the shelter milieu, and if necessary with medication, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral interventions, their children develop better overall ( 3 , 55 , 79 ). The first step is proper screening of the parents; unfortunately, many agencies lack the proper tools to perform screenings ( 25 ). Nonetheless, data show that shelter-based parenting support groups reduce minor to moderate depression in mothers with young children ( 3 , 55 ). In these groups, staff emphasize the importance of parental roles by supporting effective parenting (e.g., helping parents provide routines and implement positive discipline) ( 43 ). Support groups reassure parents that the family unit will survive. Whenever possible, families should be linked to appropriate home-visiting programs to further develop parenting skills.
Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV), supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in conjunction with the Administration of Children and Families (ACF), is an evidence-based approach that builds parenting skills, strengthens relationships between parents and children, and promotes healthy childhood development ( 74 ). Currently, 18 models are approved as MIECHV programs ( 74 ). While home visiting has not been widely implemented in shelter settings, the approach is beginning to reach some of the most vulnerable families.
To begin, an intake is conducted to evaluate the strengths and needs of the family and tailor the intervention. Visits are made by nurses, social workers, early childhood educators, or other trained professionals for at-risk families during pregnancy and early childhood. MIECHV programs have shown encouraging outcomes, including ( 74 , 49 )

The implementation of MIECHV programs to families experiencing homelessness, including in shelter settings, would help improve child and parent long-term outcomes.
Although research demonstrates that positive parenting practices can mitigate the negative health and social effects of ACEs, few programs serving families experiencing homelessness have been evaluated. Early Risers is one evidence-based parenting program that has been tested through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design for families experiencing homelessness. The program helps parents respond to their children's behaviors ( 24 , 33 , 62 ). Results of the RCT found that families living in supportive housing who participated in Early Risers experienced high attendance and satisfaction, improved parenting confidence, reduced depression rates in the children, and decreased rates of child conduct problems. Surprisingly, families who experienced the best results included those who started with higher baseline levels of parental depression and disruptive child behaviors.
Play therapy is another evidence-based treatment that builds on the natural communication methods and learning processes of children ( 1 ). Therapists help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and optimize their growth and development ( 66 ). In addition to reducing anxiety, play “provides opportunities for novel experiences, active engagement, and learning from peers and adults” ( 17 ).
While research supports the effectiveness of play therapy with children experiencing many problems, few programs have been designed specifically for families experiencing homelessness ( 1 , 13 , 81 ). One exception is the Horizons for the Homeless Children's Playspace program. Horizons has installed play spaces in more than 90 shelters across Massachusetts ( 35 ). Their teams carefully select play resources for children ages 0–6 who are experiencing trauma ( 35 ).
Applying appropriate developmental support for children begins with accurate assessment. One state-of-the-art tool, the Neurodevelopmental Ecological Screening Tool (NEST), was designed by Bassuk Center and C4 Innovations experts with support from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Scientifically validated in 2019, NEST (C.J. DeCandia, K.T. Volk, G.J. Unick, and L. Donegan, unpublished data) is an easy-to-use, interactive tool that assesses the risk of a range of difficulties in children ages 3–5, including

NEST also generates practical, trauma-informed recommendations and allows low-resource service settings, such as shelters, to have access to trauma-informed developmental screenings. With a built-in decision-making algorithm, nonclinicians can be trained to identify children most in need of further assessment and service and to determine how best to nurture a child's development.
Children experiencing homelessness undergo frequent moves, evictions, changes in schools, and exposure to life-disrupting events. Many of these children perform poorly in school. One potential solution involves school readiness programs that strive to provide families, specifically those in marginalized communities, necessary resources and skills to raise children who are ready to learn.
Head Start is a school readiness program for children under age 5 who are from low-income families that provides education, health, social, and other services ( 61 ). The program has a strong evidence base. Head Start participation leads to significant gains in cognitive skills during the preschool years ( 11 , 73 ). Compared with children in parental care, children enrolled in Head Start performed considerably better in social-emotional measures in kindergarten, had fewer attention problems, and exhibited fewer negative behaviors ( 82 ). As an evidence-based public program, Head Start is uniquely situated to connect children and families to community resources and services to support them during a destabilizing time. In fact, families who meet the definition of homelessness under the McKinney–Vento HEARTH Act are categorically eligible for Head Start ( 50 ). The majority of Head Start programs offer assistance to families, including finding shelter, transporting families to services, scheduling appointments, and providing financial guidance.
Despite these offerings, Head Start has not reached as many children experiencing homelessness as it could. Many school readiness and home-visiting programs allocate services by zip code, which presents a significant barrier for a population as transient as homeless families. Nevertheless, progress is being made. At Head Start, the number of children experiencing homelessness at some point during the program year has nearly doubled over time, from 20,647 (2.2% of all Head Start children) in 2006–2007 to 35,270 (4.2%) in 2015–2016 ( 58 ). Furthermore, intentional steps are being taken to help Head Start reach more children experiencing homelessness. In February 2019, the director of the Office of Head Start (OHS) announced the Home at Head Start campaign, which asks Head Start programs to focus on enrolling more children and families experiencing homelessness, with a goal of enrolling 10,000 children without homes in 2019 ( 67 ).
Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) is a comprehensive, time-limited strategy that helps sheltered families transition successfully back to the community by connecting them with selected services and supports. Adopted from an evidence-based CTI model for adults with mental illness experiencing homelessness, the FCTI begins when families enter shelters. As multidisciplinary teams, including case managers, apply intensive intervention and tools such as motivational interviewing, families are connected to community services and supports and learn new, adaptable skills. As time progresses, the case managers ease the parents into taking greater initiative and direction in securing and maintaining the services needed to support their independence ( 7 , 65 , 69 ).
Permanent housing is essential for ensuring the health, nutrition, well-being, and educational achievement of children. More than one-quarter (11.2 million) of the 43.8 million renter households are extremely low income and on the verge of homelessness ( 54 ). The common standard of affordability is 30% of a household's income, yet only an estimated 7.5 million rental homes are affordable, leaving a shortage of at least 3.7 million affordable units ( 54 ). In recent years, this situation has worsened. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, “The severe shortage of affordable homes for extremely low-income renters is systemic, affecting every state and metropolitan area” ( 54 , p. 11). Extremely low-income households is defined as at or below 30% of area median income. Families with “worst case housing needs” who spend more than 50% of their income on rent are at extremely high risk of becoming homeless and have limited resources for other necessities such as heat, food, and health care ( 2 , 72 ).
In 2008, HUD launched the Family Options Study, which investigated the most effective housing and service interventions for ending family homelessness. Families ( N = 2,282) and children ( N > 5,000) from 12 communities were randomly assigned to one of the following interventions: ( a ) permanent housing subsidies with no supportive services attached; ( b ) project-based transitional housing; ( c ) community-based rapid rehousing; and ( d ) usual care, in which families had access to usual care homeless and housing assistance but did not have priority access to any particular program ( 75 ). The study followed families for three years and collected data at baseline, at 20 months, and again at 37 months. It found that permanent housing subsidies (e.g., housing choice vouchers) had the best overall outcomes, including reductions in subsequent homelessness, number of moves, school mobility, psychological distress, intimate partner violence, alcohol/drug use, and food insecurity ( 75 ).
While the study of housing interventions was comprehensive, the report gave far less attention to services and then, we believe, erroneously concluded that “homelessness is (only) a housing affordability problem that can be remedied with permanent housing subsidies without specialized homeless specific psychosocial services” ( 75 , p. 11). The report did not sufficiently stratify the type, frequency, and duration of services, with the exception of case management caseloads. Despite the findings that deep, long-term housing subsidies substantially benefited families and that rapid rehousing outcomes were similar to usual care but less expensive than long-term subsidies, Katherine O'Regan, HUD's Assistant Secretary of Policy Development and Research at the time, concluded, “While we continue to seek more housing subsidies to help families experiencing homelessness, we must also recognize that rapid rehousing is proving to be the most cost-effective tool that we have available within the crisis response system” ( 76 ). Limited resources have taken precedence over the most effective approach documented by the Family Options Study.
The rates of trauma and violent victimization experienced by homeless mothers are clearly staggering. More than 90% of these women have been exposed to at least one serious traumatic stress event during childhood ( 10 , 30 ). Violence continues into adulthood; more than two-thirds of women in this group report severe physical assault by an intimate partner, with 27% requiring medical care ( 28 ). A longitudinal study of homeless families suggests that PTSD may be a primary driver of homelessness for many families ( 30 ). Failure to address the trauma experienced by homeless mothers may partly explain the very high rate of return to shelters by many rehoused families ( 39 ). PTSD and its associated disorders also compromise a parent's ability to parent effectively. These data indicate that trauma-informed care should be implemented in all family shelters.

Section: CONCLUSION

Homelessness is embedded within various complex systemic issues including poverty, racism, health disparities, deteriorating neighborhoods, lack of a national housing policy, and, most importantly, the unequal distribution of wealth. To overcome housing insecurity, we must set priorities. First, we must acknowledge that each person deserves living conditions that ensure human dignity and provide safety, protection, and opportunity, especially for children. Recognizing that responsibility means more than providing a roof over families’ heads, we have learned, through three decades of experience, what steps to take to prevent, reduce, and even eliminate homelessness among families and children. Acting on this knowledge requires political will.
Homelessness is a devastating event in the lives of low-income families and children. As long as federal policy is based on inaccurate numbers driven by limited definitions and the ongoing disavowal that homelessness often damages children, the problem will continue to mushroom and threaten the well-being of a generation of children. The initial step involves understanding the needs of families and children most affected by this experience. To do so, we must agree on the definition of homelessness, develop a standardized and accurate way of counting families and children, and recognize that children are being harmed. The extensive database associated with ACEs and the emerging neuroscience data have convincingly demonstrated that the impact of homelessness can be lifelong and may contribute significantly to the common diseases, disabilities, and mortality associated with various outcomes.
Although more research is needed to identify evidence-based practices for these children and families, we are learning how to address the problem and accelerate the process of identifying and implementing promising and best practices. Services matter and must be integrated with housing solutions that are effective and not driven by limited budgets. Regrettably, racial inequity, poverty, and the associated housing instability have not been top priorities in the federal policy agenda. Without the political determination and bipartisan support, these pressing social issues will continue to magnify, and many young parents, youth, and children will not have the opportunity to thrive. We must stem the tide to ensure the future for millions of children.
