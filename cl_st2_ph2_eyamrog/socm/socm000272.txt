Title: Mental health spillovers from serious family illness: Doubly robust estimation using EQ-5D-5L population normative data


Abstract: Abstract

People are interconnected and ill-health is rarely experienced in isolation. However, while there has been extensive research on health spillovers related to informal caregiving, there is comparatively little evidence on how ill-health may impact upon non-caregiving family members. This paper analyses EQ-5D-5L normative data from a nationally representative sample of adult residents of Ireland to estimate the independent relationship between serious family illness and five distinct dimensions of health. The empirical strategy combines inverse probability weighting and multivariate ordered probit regression in a doubly robust estimation. We find that experience of serious family illness is associated with large mental health decrements that are independent of caring responsibilities, while similar results are not evident for the four other health dimensions. Furthermore, stratified sub-sample analyses indicate considerable heterogeneity by sex and by income. In particular, we find evidence consistent with larger mental health spillovers for females than for males, as well as for low- and medium-income households relative to high-income households. The latter suggests that such spillovers may be substantially worse for those with fewer resources. Overall, the findings have a range of potential implications, including for the provision of mental health supports and services, for equity of health outcomes, as well as for health economic evaluation. For example, we calculate that our estimates of health spillovers are consistent with a 1.3% reduction in health utility for non-caregiving family members.

Section: 1. Introduction

People are interconnected and ill-health is rarely experienced in isolation ( Smith and Christakis, 2008 ; Wittenberg and Prosser, 2013 ). For example, it has been suggested that the physical and mental strain of ‘caring for’ an ill or disabled relative imposes a health- and quality of life-related burden ( Bhadhuri et al., 2017 ; Brouwer, 2006 ). In addition, the illness experience of an individual is also thought to ‘spillover’ and exert a psychic or emotional toll on both caregiving and non-caregiving family members, and this is a result of ‘caring about’ the person ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ; Bhadhuri et al., 2017 ; Bobinac et al., 2010 , 2011 ). Taken together, this suggests that the conceptualization of health effects should extend beyond the individual to those physically present and/or emotionally connected ( Wittenberg et al., 2013a , b ). Thus, in this paper, we consider the relationship between serious family illness and the mental health of non-caregiving family members.
In a health economics context, how an individual's health may impact upon family members, and consequently health care demand, has been extensively discussed ( Basu et al., 2010 ; Jones-Lee, 1992 ). Much of the early dialogue in relation to spillovers focussed on impacts on wider welfare, as opposed to health per se ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ). For example, Lees (1967) described these externalities as “the disutility felt by an individual at the thought that others are not getting adequate medical care”. However, in keeping with the prevailing view of the period, the author also suggested that they were less than “minimally relevant” to the political economy of health services ( Lees, 1967 ). In contrast, subsequent work from Culyer ( Culyer, 1971 , 1989 , 1989 ; Culyer and Simpson, 1980 ) showed how, through ‘interdependent utility functions’ or ‘caring externalities’, health care consumption might generate welfare gains in others. Research in other disciplines, such as sociology , has also long recognised the potential for ‘interpersonal health effects’ to propagate among family members ( Christakis and Allison, 2006 ).
In an effort to provide theoretical support for the interpersonal value of health, Jacobson (2000) extended the individualistic Grossman model of demand for health care ( Grossman, 1972 ) to show how other family members' health is important for an individual's own health stock and for health care utilisation. In particular, she considered each family member to be a producer of other family members' health, as well as their own. As a result, they receive investment and consumption benefits from investing in the health of other family members. The family, therefore, invest in health “until the rate of marginal consumption benefits equals the rate of marginal net effective costs of health capital” ( Jacobson, 2000 ).
As highlighted by Basu and Meltzer (2005) , the Jacobson model is not without limitation. In particular, they suggest it does not take transitions between family structures into account or provide a guide for treatment choice while making an investment in health, thus restricting the relevance of the model in informing cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). They build upon the work of Jacobson and others to establish a conceptual framework of utility maximisation which corresponds to family well-being. The paper, first to employ the term ‘spillover effects’ in the context of CEA ( Grosse et al., 2019 ), adopts a welfarist approach to spillovers, and shows how the appropriate benefits for CEA from a societal perspective consist of effects extending beyond those accrued by the patient alone ( Basu and Meltzer, 2005 ). Nevertheless, others have argued that applied economic evaluations generally require a narrower interpretation of health spillovers. Thus, most attempts to quantify and incorporate health spillovers into CEA focus solely on a measure of health output, i.e., quality-adjusted life years ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ). Such efforts have gained increasing attention in recent years and guidelines specifying how these economic evaluations should be conducted now acknowledge the need to incorporate spillovers ( Brown et al., 2019 ).
For example, while the first iteration of guidelines by the US Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine recognised that spillover effects could ‘ripple out’ from every intervention (or program), they recommended only for inclusion of ‘important’ health-related quality of life spillovers in sensitivity analysis, where possible. In the main, this recommendation reflected the limited data on family health-related quality of life at the time ( Weinstein et al., 1996 ). In contrast, the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, convened in 2012, advocated for the inclusion of family/caregiver spillover effects in reference case analyses for CEA conducted from either a health care or societal perspective ( Neumann et al., 2016 ). The Second Panel did, however, continue to acknowledge the methodological and data-related constraints applicable to the incorporation of these spillovers.
Multiple regulatory agencies have echoed the recommendations of the Second US Panel in their own guidelines. For example, in 2013, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocated for the inclusion of “all direct health effects, whether for patients or, when relevant, carers” ( NICE, 2013 ). Brouwer (2019) suggests that a contemporaneous focus on informal caregivers in the literature likely prompted their specific reference to carer health effects. Citing subsequent empirical evidence, he suggests that consideration of the broader family network is more in keeping with the goal of health optimisation aimed for by decision-making bodies such as NICE. Guidelines for economic evaluation from Canada and the Netherlands provide further prominent examples of explicit recommendation for consideration of ‘potential spillover impacts’ or ‘all relevant societal costs and benefits’ respectively ( CADTH, 2018 ; Zorginstituut Nederland, 2016 ). These approaches concur with a widely-held view within the literature that “the health effects in family members and caregivers are directly relevant for the decision rule that underlies the analysis” in economic evaluation of health care interventions ( Brouwer, 2019 ). Nevertheless, health spillover inclusion in CEA is yet to become common practice ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ; Wittenberg et al., 2019 ).
In this context, a burgeoning literature describes the varied scope of situations in which health spillovers might occur, as well as their possible manifestations, which range from somatic illness and deleterious effects on physical health to psychological symptomatology and broader declines in well-being ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ; Francetic et al., 2020 ; Lavelle et al., 2014 ; Wittenberg et al., 2019 ; Wittenberg and Prosser, 2013 ). The complexity of the potential consequences of serious family illness should not be understated. Indeed, beneficial impacts related to gratification, interdependence, and joy have also been described ( Wittenberg et al., 2019 ). Notwithstanding these potential benefits, the emerging evidence generally implies a considerable component of disease burden may be unaccounted for ( Wittenberg and Prosser, 2013 ). Of particular note is the potential impact of health spillovers on the common mental disorders. With the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimating that depression and anxiety account for 7.5% and 3.4% of all years lived with disability respectively, the consequence of these disorders, in terms of lost health and economic costs , is substantial ( WHO, 2017 ).
Given all of this, this paper uses nationally representative data on adults resident in Ireland to examine the independent association between experience of serious family illness and various self-reported dimensions of health-related quality of life, including anxiety and depression. In particular, it combines inverse probability weighting (IPW) and multivariate ordered probit (MVOP) regression in a doubly robust estimation of this relationship. The analysis is motivated by discernible gaps within the extant literature. Until recently, empirical research on health spillovers had focused mainly on spillovers among informal or unpaid family caregivers within specific population sub-groups, with less research on spillovers among the broader network of non-caregiving family members, at a population level , or on differences across groups ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ; Lavelle et al., 2014 ; Pacheco Barzallo, 2018 ; Wittenberg and Prosser, 2013 ). With the preponderance of evidence on spillover effects relating to neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, followed by cancer ( Wittenberg et al., 2019 ), some may query the applicability of estimates obtained from these analyses in other illness contexts. In addressing these gaps, our paper makes a number of specific contributions: first, it presents nationally representative evidence that experience of serious family illness is strongly associated with mental health decrements that are independent of caring responsibilities and a range of other factors; second, it shows that similar results are not evident for other dimensions of health; third, it finds considerable heterogeneity by sex and by income in the relationship between mental health and serious family illness; and fourth, it estimates the reduction in health utility from serious family illness for both caregiving and non-caregiving family members.

Section: 2. Data and methods

We use data from the Irish EQ-5D-5L Survey, 2015–16 ( O'Neill, 2018 ). EQ-5D is an instrument used to describe and value health and is commonly employed in clinical trials , health surveys, and health outcome measurement ( Forbes et al., 2017 ; Pickard et al., 2007 ). The EQ-5D questionnaire measures health-related quality of life across five dimensions: mobility; self-care; usual activities; pain/discomfort; and, anxiety/depression ( Brooks, 1996 ). The most recent iteration, the EQ-5D-5L, categorises each dimension into five severity levels: no problems; slight problems; moderate problems; severe problems; and, extreme problems/unable to ( Herdman et al., 2011 ). It describes 3,125 distinct health states and, for each, an index score anchored at 1 (full health) and 0 (dead) is calculated using preference data ( Drummond et al., 2015 ).
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system was recently used to capture the self-reported health of a representative sample of 1,131 adult residents in Ireland by means of a computer-assisted-personal-interview survey ( Hobbins et al., 2018a ). In addition to the EQ-5D-5L questions, information was collected on a range of socio-demographic variables for each respondent, as well as on their experience of serious illness in themselves, their family, and in caring for others. The precise wording of the EQ-5D-5L and serious illness questions are presented in online supplemental Appendix A .
Definitions and sample descriptive statistics for the variables used in our analysis are presented in Table 1 . For our five dependent variables , which relate to the EQ-5D dimensions, we aggregate the moderate, severe and extreme/unable to categories, due to relatively small numbers of observations in some cells. Table 1 shows that, for example, 13.8% of respondents indicated they were slightly anxious or depressed, while 8.2% indicated they were moderately, severely, or extremely anxious or depressed. In terms of the serious illness variables, 33.2% of respondents indicated that they had experienced serious illness in themselves, 69.8% that they had experienced serious illness in their family, and 51.6% that they had experienced serious illness in caring for others. The congruence of the proportion of respondents indicating ever having experienced any serious illness in themselves (33.2%) with the 26.6% of respondents residing in Ireland who reported currently having a long-standing illness or health problem in the 2016 wave of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey speaks to the veracity of these figures ( Eurostat, 2020 ).

It is important to note, however, that these serious illness questions do not put a timeframe on when such experiences occurred, nor on their nature. Nonetheless, the inclusion of questions relating to respondents' experience of serious illness in themselves or in caring for others allows us to control for two key contextual factors. Controlling for an individual's own health status is important since it has been suggested that people with chronic or serious illness may cluster together in households ( Wittenberg et al., 2013a ). In addition, by controlling for experience of serious illness in caring for others, we can differentiate between health decrements related to ‘caring for’ and ‘caring about’ the individual with serious illness.
In terms of other explanatory variables, the number of people in the respondent's household is included since the health of both the family member with serious illness and the respondent may be affected by common social support networks ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ). We also control for additional personal, household, and socioeconomic characteristics including age, sex, marital status, children in the household, living environment (urban/rural), level of education, employment status, and annual household income in our econometric models . Details of these variables are also presented in Table 1 .
Tubeuf et al. (2019) describe three distinct methods of measuring spillovers : (1) direct measurement of disutility among family members; (2) relative assessment of family members' utility by comparison to a control group; and (3) family member utility estimation in a hypothetical scenario in which the patient is healthy and/or does not require caregiving. Insofar as the approach employed here seeks to econometrically model the self-reported health-related quality of life of respondents as a function of their experience of serious family illness, it aligns most closely with the second of these categories. It should be noted that while the term ‘spillover’ is generally construed causally, here we employ it as a label of decrement or disutility associated with serious family illness, given our empirical approach. This is in keeping with previous literature on the topic ( Bobinac et al., 2011 ; Wittenberg et al., 2013a ).
To examine the evidence of health spillovers from serious illness, we estimate MVOP models of the EQ-5D health dimensions. In the case of q outcomes, the MVOP model can be specified in a q -equation seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) system, where for each individual i and outcome n , the continuous latent variable H e a l t h i , n ∗ denotes underlying health in that particular dimension. Our model consists of q = 5 outcomes and each latent health variable is expressed as a function of a vector of the three serious illness variables ( SI ), a vector of personal, household, and socioeconomic characteristics ( X ) as listed in Table 1 , sets of parameters γ n and β n (which differ across equations), and an equation-specific error term ε i , n . Formally, we have: [1] M o b i l i t y i ∗ = S I i γ 1 + X i β 1 + ε i , 1 S e l f C a r e i ∗ = S I i γ 2 + X i β 2 + ε i , 2 U s u a l A c t i ∗ = S I i γ 3 + X i β 3 + ε i , 3 P a i n / D i s i ∗ = S I i γ 4 + X i β 4 + ε i , 4 A n x / D e p i ∗ = S I i γ 5 + X i β 5 + ε i , 5 .
In the MVOP model, ε i , n is assumed to have a standard normal distribution , while importantly, given the SUR nature of the model, the multivariate distribution of the error term is multivariate normal with mean 0 and correlation matrix Ω i.e., { ε i , 1 , … , ε i , 5 } ~ N ( 0 , Ω ) where: [2] Ω = ( 1 ρ 12 ρ 21 1 … ρ 15 … ρ 25 ⋮ ⋮ ρ 51 ρ 52 ⋱ ⋮ … 1 ) and ρ jk represents the correlation between ε i , j and ε i , k . This set-up allows for unobserved heterogeneity through potentially non-zero values of the off-diagonal elements of the symmetric matrix Ω , by capturing the effects of common unobserved factors influencing the underlying latent propensities.
In our main model, the relationship between each latent variable H e a l t h i , n ∗ and corresponding observed ordered variable H e a l t h i , n , which takes values equal to j n = { 1,2,3 } , is given by: [3] H e a l t h i , n = j n if δ j n − 1 , n < H e a l t h i , n ∗ < δ j n , n where δ denotes ‘cutpoints’ in the distribution of H e a l t h i , n ∗ and δ 0 , n and δ 3 , n are normalized to − ∞ and + ∞ respectively.
In estimating MVOP models that include a range of control variables, the aim is to reduce the likelihood that differences in the self-reported health of those with and without experience of serious family illness reflect differences in other characteristics across groups. That being said, to further reduce the impact of any systematic differences between respondents in each group, we employ a doubly robust estimator by combining the aforementioned MVOP models with inverse probability weights based on propensity scores to increase the observational equivalence of those who have, and have not, experienced serious family illness ( Neelsen and O'Donnell, 2017 ). The advantage of this approach is that it guards against misspecification more effectively than the IPW or regression alone, with the estimator being consistent as long as either the propensity score or MVOP model is correctly specified ( Kaiser and Schmid, 2016 ). Inverse probability weighted estimators have previously been employed in conjunction with non-linear models by Jones et al. (2006) .
To calculate and apply inverse probability weights, the propensity score is first estimated using a probit model, such that: [4] p ˆ i = Pr ( T i = 1 | X i ) where T denotes experience of serious family illness (1/0) and X is a vector of covariates included in the propensity score model. Estimated weights ( w ˆ ) that are applied to the MVOP model are then calculated as the inverse of the predicted probability of experiencing (or not experiencing) serious family illness, such that: [5] w ˆ i = T i p ˆ i + 1 − T i 1 − p ˆ i which implies that w ˆ i = 1 p ˆ i if an individual has experienced serious family illness and w ˆ i = 1 1 − p ˆ i if not.
Curtis et al. (2007) state that, in general, candidate covariates for the propensity score model may include those which might confound the relationship between treatment and outcome. Others, however, advise that only those variables which are unaffected by the treatment, or anticipation of treatment, should be used ( Jones, 2007 ). As a result, our weights are estimated on the basis of a propensity score model that includes all MVOP model covariates, apart from the other serious illness variables. Nonetheless, to test the sensitivity of our findings, we also apply weights derived from a range of propensity score models that include varying subsets of controls. To assess balance between treatment and control groups before and after fitting the propensity score model and applying corresponding inverse probability weights, we estimate the standardised difference in covariates across each group. In keeping with previous literature, absolute standardised differences of below 0.10 are assumed to reflect good overlap ( Kelleher et al., 2020 ; Normand et al., 2001 ). All analyses presented were conducted using Stata/SE 16.1 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX). In particular, we used Roodman's (2011) cmp command, applying inverse probability weights, to estimate γ , β , ρ and δ in the MVOP models, which allows us to calculate relevant partial effects.
In addition to the main MVOP model, we also consider a number of extensions to the analysis. For instance, it has been suggested that, in conjunction with inverse probability weights, restricting the analysis to subjects with better overlap of covariate distributions can also help to balance the groups being compared and, thus, improve validity ( Glynn et al., 2019 ). Therefore, following the methods of Stürmer et al. (2010) , prior to estimating the weighted MVOP model, we asymmetrically trim the sample by dropping observations in both treatment and control groups with a propensity score at or below the 5th percentile of the propensity score in the group reporting serious illness or with a propensity score at or above the 95th percentile of the propensity score in the group not reporting any experience of serious family illness.
In addition, we also consider a number of sub-sample analyses. This is because previous studies have found evidence of potential differences in the magnitudes of spillovers by sex ( Pacheco Barzallo, 2018 ), while others have suggested that they may also differ by socioeconomic status ( McCabe, 2019 ) (see online supplemental Appendix B for an annotated bibliography including further studies reporting differences in spillover magnitude by sex, by income and by familial role). In particular, we perform sub-sample analysis following stratification of the full sample by sex (female and male) and by household income (low-, medium-, and high-income households).
Based on personal correspondence with a member of the team of surveyors who gathered the Irish EQ-5D-5L population normative data used in this paper, we believe that the full sample likely includes a number of health care , social care, and other professionals, who may perform caring or related roles outside of their family. Accordingly, in a further extension to the main analysis, we estimate our models excluding respondents who reported no experience of serious illness in their family but experience of serious illness in caring for others. The sample excluding these ‘formal carers’ (broadly defined) is also employed in a five-level MVOP model, the partial effect estimates of which are combined with health utility decrements from the five-level value set for Ireland ( Hobbins et al., 2018b ). This allows us to calculate utility decrements associated with experience of serious illness in the family and in caring for a family member. Finally, we also conduct a range of additional sensitivity and robustness checks – see online supplemental Appendix E .

Section: 3. Results

The standardised difference in mean propensity score between ‘treatment’ (serious illness in family) and ‘control’ (no serious illness in family) groups, before and after application of weights, was 0.461 and 0.009 respectively, indicating good balance between the two groups after weighting – see Table 2 . The propensity score distribution in the treatment and control groups is also suggestive of good overlap – see Figure C1 in online supplemental Appendix C . Details of other observed weighting characteristics and standardised differences in covariate means are presented in Table 2 . Table 2 .

Table 3 presents estimated average partial effects for the three serious illness variables from the main inverse probability weighted MVOP model . In terms of our key finding, we estimate that respondents who indicated experience of serious family illness were 12.2 percentage points (ppts) less likely to report not being anxious or depressed, 6.6 ppts more likely to report being slightly anxious or depressed, and 5.6 ppts more likely to report being moderately, severely or extremely anxious or depressed (see Table 3 and Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, similar independent associations were not found for the other four dimensions of health, where all partial effects were practically and statistically insignificant. Indeed, a key advantage of our weighted MVOP approach is that it allows us to show that potential health spillovers are evident where they might be expected (e.g., serious family illness is independently related to increased anxiety/depression), but not where we might not anticipate finding them (e.g., between serious family illness and an individual's self-care or pain/discomfort). This can be considered as a type of falsification test in support of the presence of mental health spillovers. It is, however, important to note that a similar pattern was not observed in relation to the serious illness in caring variable, contrary to what might be expected. We return to this issue below.

Full results for this model are presented in online supplemental Appendix D for information. All values of ρ ˆ jk are positive and statistically significant. This supports the use of an MVOP model and implies that respondents with a higher propensity to report a problem in health dimension j also have a higher propensity to report a problem in dimension k .
In the first extension to our analysis, the sample was trimmed to further augment the observational equivalence of the treatment and control groups. The estimated partial effects of serious family illness from the trimmed weighted MVOP model differ only slightly from those from the main inverse probability weighted model ( Table 4 ). In addition, it is also interesting to note that the estimated partial effects from the weighted and unweighted MVOP models are broadly consistent. As shown in online supplemental Appendix E , all other estimated partial effects for the three serious illness variables obtained from unweighted and trimmed inverse probability weighted models were similar to those from the main model.

We also estimated models using sub-samples relating to sex and to household income – results for anxiety/depression are presented in Table 5 . For serious illness in the family, the estimated partial effects are larger for females than males, suggesting larger mental health spillovers for females from family illness. However, the opposite pattern is found for serious illness in caring. For income, there are marked differences in partial effects for family and the individual's own serious illness by income group. Most notably, anxiety/depression spillovers from serious family illness are much larger for respondents in low- and medium-income households, suggesting that mental health spillovers may be substantially worse for those with fewer resources.

Results from the sub-sample analyses by sex and by income group for the four other health dimensions are presented in online supplemental Appendix E . While there were some anomalous findings, in general these results do not suggest differences by sex or by income for serious family illness. This is not surprising, since Table 3 suggests no impact of serious illness in the family on these dimensions in the full sample.
Overall, 92 of the 1,131 respondents (8.1%) reported experience of serious illness in caring for others, but not in their family. Sub-sample analysis conducted excluding this group (a high proportion of which are likely to be ‘formal’ carers) indicates that the estimated partial effects relating to experience of serious illness in family and in caring for others are now similar in magnitude – see Table 6 . Indeed, it may well be that the likely inclusion of (unidentifiable) formal carers in the full sample analysis resulted in the null finding for caring in Table 3 and that the results in Table 6 are more representative of the overall population of non-formal carers. Both partial effect estimates are also of comparable size to the estimated partial effect on anxiety/depression attributable to respondents' experience of serious illness within themselves. Moreover, postestimation Wald tests reveal no statistically significant differences between the estimated Serious Illness Individual coefficients for anxiety/depression and the estimated coefficients of the Serious Illness Family and Serious Illness Caring variables (results available on request). In addition, considering that experience of serious illness in family and in caring are both independently associated with anxiety/depression, but not with the other four dimensions of health, the estimates in Table 6 further corroborate the falsification test interpretation of our findings.

In a further sub-sample analysis, conducted among respondents reporting no serious illness in themselves ( online supplemental Appendix E ), estimated partial effects for the dimension of anxiety/depression were slightly smaller in magnitude but remained practically and statistically significant.
Average partial effects calculated on the basis of MVOP models estimated following application of weights derived from propensity score models including varying subsets of controls are also presented in online supplemental Appendix E . When applied weights are based on all covariates of the main MVOP model, including the respondents’ own experience of serious illness, and their experience in caring for others ( Table E2 ), the results are generally accordant with those of the main analysis.
Finally, we estimated a model employing five-level versions of the dependent variables and the sample excluding ‘formal’ carers (see online supplemental Appendix E ). Combining the estimated partial effects from this model with health utility decrements from the EQ-5D-5L value set for Ireland allows us to estimate the average utility decrement associated with experience of serious illness in the family and in caring for others ( Table 7 ). For example, we assume that serious family illness increases the probability of slight, moderate, severe, and extreme anxiety/depression by 3.6 ppts, 2.5 ppts, 0.6 ppts, and 0.2 ppts respectively. Based on Table 2 in Hobbins et al. (2018b) , these health states result in reductions in health utility of −0.08, −0.20, −0.54, and −0.65 respectively. Weighting these reductions by the applicable predicted changes in anxiety/depression levels from serious family illness, and then summing, results in a predicted overall reduction in health utility of −0.012. The predicted reduction in health utility associated with experience of serious illness in caring for others sums to −0.014. With a mean health utility of 0.91 for those reporting no serious family illness in the O'Neill (2018) data, this implies a percentage reduction of about 1.3%. Similarly, a mean utility of 0.91 among those reporting no experience of serious illness in caring for others implies a percentage reduction of approximately 1.5% associated with health spillovers related to caregiving. Both of these disutility estimates are also of a similar magnitude to the anxiety/depression-specific utility decrement associated with one's own experience of serious illness, −0.015, as shown in Table 7 . It is important to note, however, that this estimate likely represents an upper bound of the anxiety/depression-specific ‘direct’ disutility of illness experienced by respondents, since it will encapsulate both health-related quality of life decrements related to the psychic toll of experience of any serious illness, as well as decrements arising directly from any mental illness. It is also important to be aware that this figure does not represent an estimate of the total ‘disutility’ associated with respondents' own experience of serious illness since this would require inclusion of the weighted utility decrements applicable to the other EQ-5D dimensions.

Section: 4. Discussion

We present an analysis of the independent relationship between five separate dimensions of health and serious illness. Our doubly robust estimation strategy finds evidence consistent with results from Al-Janabi et al. (2016b) , and Holmes and Deb (2003) , in that we observe decrements associated with serious family illness that relate primarily to the dimension of anxiety/depression. The finding that decrements extend to individuals in the broader family network is also in keeping with previous evidence ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016b ). In differentiating between spillovers that arise from ‘caring for’ and ‘caring about’ a family member with a serious illness, our results also concur with those of Bobinac et al. (2011) . Moreover, the estimated magnitude of spillover disutility related to caring for a family member with serious illness, −0.014, is remarkably similar to an estimated utility loss of −0.015 reported by Davidson et al. (2008) . It must be noted, however, that this previously reported estimate likely includes decrements related to both ‘caring for’ and ‘caring about’ the individual with serious illness.
In addition to the overall findings, we also find evidence of heterogeneity by sex and by household income. The finding that our estimated spillovers are considerably lower in high-income households is particularly noteworthy. These results are in agreement with previous reports from Holmes and Deb (2003) suggesting that economic distress can reduce the family's ability to psychologically cope with chronic illness . Although we cannot speak to the potential mechanisms behind this, our findings would appear to provide empirical support for the suggestion by McCabe (2019) that those who can afford respite care may carry a smaller burden in terms of health-related quality of life. Other possible explanations include better access to health care and support services, an increased capacity to navigate such services, and a greater ability to absorb labour market shocks arising from serious illness.
A number of limitations to this analysis should be borne in mind. First, our data is cross-sectional and our model, as a result, descriptive. Therefore, our estimates should be considered as independent associations rather than causal effects ( Dixon and Round, 2019 ). Indeed, even with application of a doubly robust approach, there may be reasons to doubt that these observed associations are, in fact, true spillover effects . For example, they could also reflect the unobserved confounding influence of common environmental, economic, or genetic factors such as a genetic predisposition to mental ill-health within the household. It is, however, important to note that we do not find evidence of such common influences in the other EQ-5D health dimensions, as one might expect if this were the case. Nonetheless, future research should look, where possible, to employ longitudinal data covering the period before and after the incidence of illness or injury , prospective analysis of randomised controlled trials ( Dixon and Round, 2019 ) or research designs such as difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity design , or instrumental variable estimation , to aid casual inference.
In addition, the potential for inconsistencies in the interpretation of the serious illness questions might also be cause for concern. For example, respondents could possibly consider their own serious illness when asked about experience of serious illness in their family or in caring for others. With that said, by enquiring about the individual's own serious illness experience immediately prior to the other serious illness questions, item ordering is likely to mitigate the risk of such misinterpretation. Other limitations relate to the data we analyse. For example, our outcome measures and main independent variables of interest are self-reported and subjective. The analysis was also constrained by the independent variables available for inclusion in our control set. Moreover, we have very limited information on the extent, nature, and timing of the serious illness. For instance, we don't know when the illness occurred, how long it lasted for, nor the degree of closeness in the family relationship . As such, future iterations of the EQ-5D-5L Survey might inquire about serious illness experience with a greater degree of dimensionality. Additionally, it would be beneficial to assess the face validity of the wording of these questions prior to implementation. It should also be noted that certain spillover impacts may evade the dimensions of the EQ-5D instrument ( Wittenberg et al., 2013a ). The E-QALY project measure ( Extending the QALY Project, 2017 ) aims to capture quality of life more broadly, explicitly including aspects of life considered important to carers. A direct comparison of the EQ-5D-5L with this novel generic quality of life measure , assessing the ability of each to detect and quantify spillovers, may be warranted as another avenue for future research.
Nonetheless, if the independent associations observed in this analysis were to reflect a causal relationship, they would suggest that serious family illness increases anxiety/depression experience among non-caregiving family members. This is relevant in many contexts, including increasing morbidity within aging populations , as well as the current coronavirus pandemic, as it suggests the provision of mental health services and supports may not be sufficient unless the increased demand related to spillovers is accounted for.
Furthermore, our finding that spillovers may be moderated by household resources has equity implications. For example, it suggests the possibility of a ‘vicious cycle’ whereby poorer households, which tend to have poorer health outcomes, are more impacted by health spillovers than richer households, potentially leading to more adverse economic outcomes. Finally, there are also likely implications for CEA , especially in Ireland. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to present spillover disutility estimates in a sample of the population of Ireland. Fitzgerald et al. (2018) had previously reported the caregiver utility of Irish parents to young children with cystic fibrosis but employed the CarerQol-7D instrument which includes non-health domains, making such findings incompatible with CEA ( Wittenberg et al., 2019 ). In keeping with other regulatory agencies, the most recently published version of the “Guidelines for the Economic Evaluation of Health Technologies in Ireland” from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) recommends for inclusion of “all health benefits accruing to individuals” in the reference case analysis ( HIQA, 2020 ). This recommendation brings the applicability of our findings into even sharper focus.
It should lastly be noted that spillover inclusion in CEA is the subject of a continued normative debate ( Dixon and Round, 2019 ; Wittenberg et al., 2019 ). Some believe that their incorporation warrants caution owing primarily to the potential for unintended impacts on the distribution of health, equity in decision making , and procedural justice ( Dixon and Round, 2019 ; McCabe, 2019 ). Others advocate for inclusion on the basis that omission would be at odds with the goal of health optimisation espoused by decision-making bodies ( Brouwer, 2019 ). Moreover, spillover exclusion, and the tacit implication that such health benefits have zero social value (Al-Janabi et al., 2016a) , itself raises equity concerns ( Brouwer, 2019 ). While the findings of this analysis add to the evidence base informing the expansion of CEA to include spillovers, they do not inform questions as to the appropriateness of such expansions. Consensus on whether these impacts are “normatively justifiable” remains elusive, providing a further important focus for future research ( Wittenberg et al., 2019 ).

Section: 5. Conclusion

Our estimates of spillover disutility are consistent with serious family illness leading to an average reduction of 1.3% in health utility for non-caregiving family members and implies deteriorations in population health beyond those more overtly attributable to serious illness. Thus, evaluation of disease burden, or the effectiveness of interventions aimed at ameliorating such diseases, may be incomplete without consideration of the full spectrum of effects on the individual and those around them.
