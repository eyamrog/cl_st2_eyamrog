Title: Providing universal access to modern contraceptive methods: An extended cost-effectiveness analysis of meeting the demand for modern contraception in Ethiopia


Abstract: Abstract

Despite recent advances in access to and use of modern contraception in Ethiopia, further improvement is needed, particularly among poorer women. This extended cost-effectiveness analysis investigated the health outcomes, their distribution, and financial risk protection associated with meeting the demand for modern contraception for all Ethiopian women. We developed five Markov models with wealth quintile–specific input data to investigate the effects of meeting this demand and followed a hypothetical cohort of 1,252,000 women through their reproductive lives from ages 15–49 years. The health outcomes are reported in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and in intermediate health outcomes, such as the total number of induced abortions, unintended pregnancies, and pregnancy-related deaths averted. The economic effect of meeting the demand for modern contraception was assessed by estimating the financial risk protection benefits in terms of averted out-of-pocket payments and the reduction in the number of cases of catastrophic health expenditure by quintile. Meeting the demand for modern contraception was deemed highly cost effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $96.60/QALY gained per woman. A total of 676,300 QALYs were gained, and approximately 1,900,000 unintended pregnancies, 250,000 induced abortions, and 9000 pregnancy-related deaths were averted over the 35-year period. Most of these gains were achieved among low-income groups. When the demand for modern contraception was met, almost 40,000 cases of catastrophic health expenditure were averted in the poorest quintile. The total governmental cost was higher in all quintiles when the demand for modern contraception was met compared to the baseline scenario, with the largest percentage increase in governmental spending in the poorest quintiles. Meeting the demand for modern contraception fulfills the priority-setting criteria established by the Ethiopian Ministry of Health and makes the Ethiopian health care system more equitable.

Section: 1. Introduction

In 2016, the United Nations launched a global strategy with a focus on the health of women, children, and adolescents. It emphasized the role of universal health coverage, financial risk protection (FRP), and improved access to contraceptive methods in ensuring health and well-being and ending preventable deaths ( United Nations, 2016 ). In 2017, an average of 808 women died daily from complications during pregnancy and childbirth ( World Health Organization, 2019 ). This figure could be substantially reduced by limiting unintended pregnancies, thus preventing maternal morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, providing modern contraception (MC) methods to all women who want them could make the health system more equitable.
Investing in MC has the principal outcome of reducing unintended pregnancies, both unwanted and mistimed ( Santelli et al., 2003 ). According to the Guttmacher Institute, 38% of the 4.93 million pregnancies in Ethiopia in 2014 were unintended ( Guttmacher Institute, 2017 ), illustrating the need to scale up the use of MC in Ethiopia.
The demand for and use of MC has increased tremendously in Ethiopia in recent decades. In 2001, 6.3% of married women aged 15–49 years used MC; in 2019, that figure was 40.5%. ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2001 , 2005 ; 2011 , 2016 ; Ethiopian Public Health Institute, 2019 ). However, the demand for MC remains unmet for a substantial number of women, both married and unmarried. According to Bearak et al. (2018) , these women want to stop or delay childbearing but do not use any contraception due to lack of access or other societal barriers. In 2016, the proportion of satisfied demand for MC peaked at 61.3% among women aged 15–49 ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2016 ; Guttmacher Institute, 2017 ).
There are substantial differences in the use of MC among women of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in Ethiopia. In 2016, the met demand for MC (i.e., the proportion of women currently using a MC) was 43.4% in the poorest quintile and 75.1% in the richest quintile ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2016 ). Differences in health care use across wealth quintiles may result from gaps in access to health care and may be associated with existing user fees, cultural norms, and other barriers ( Dahab and Sakellariou, 2020 ). To close the gaps in access to MC and maternal health care, a useful first step is estimating the costs, health gains, and out-of-pocket payments (OOPs) associated with these interventions.
Maternal health care services are financed by the Ethiopian government; however, many women make substantial OOPs for these services ( Akalu et al., 2012 ; Parkhurst et al., 2006 ; Pearson et al., 2011 ; Richard et al., 2007 ). This implies that an increased use of MC, which lowers the number of pregnancies, would lower OOPs, as women would have less need for maternal care services. This would reduce catastrophic health expenditures (CHEs) as well as unintended pregnancies.
The Ethiopian Ministry of Health's initiative to prioritize sexual, reproductive, and maternal health care services aligns well with the country's prioritization criteria: “(1) Size of the disease burden ; (2) Cost-effectiveness; (3) Budget impact; (4) Equity; (5) Financial Risk Protection; (6) Public acceptability; and (7) Political acceptability” ( Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Health, 2019 ). Further input on how to prioritize health care services may be gained from extended cost-effectiveness analyses (ECEAs), which were developed to evaluate the health-related and financial outcomes of public policies. ECEAs differ from traditional cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) by incorporating non-health benefits, such as FRP, as well as an assessment of the distributional effects of the proposed intervention ( Verguet et al., 2016a , 2016b ). This makes ECEAs useful to policy makers, as they allow for the evaluation of equity and fairness. In the Ethiopian setting, ECEAs generate information on prioritization criteria 1–5.
We aimed to conduct an ECEA comparing the current level of met demand for MC (i.e., the status quo scenario) to a hypothetical scenario in which 100% of the demand for MC was met. We aimed both to estimate the cost effectiveness of increasing the coverage of MC and to generate results on intermediate health outcomes, such as the number of averted unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, and pregnancy-related deaths. We further investigated how the costs, health outcomes, and OOPs were distributed across women of diverse wealth quintiles and how an increased MC coverage could contribute to preventing unintended pregnancies, reducing inequities, and averting CHEs.

Section: 2. Methods

We developed a Markov model to assess the cost effectiveness of meeting the demand for MC and compared that scenario to a baseline scenario reflecting current levels of met and unmet demand. The model was implemented in five versions with wealth quintile–specific input. An ECEA was performed using the results of the five Markov models to assess the costs, health outcomes, and FRP benefits of meeting the unmet demand.
The Markov model was developed using the software ( TreeAge Software Inc. ), ran for 35 cycles, and was designed to follow a hypothetical cohort of 1,252,000 women throughout their reproductive lives from 15 to 49 years of age. There were three payoff categories: costs (in US dollars [USD]), OOPs (USD), and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained). The model also allowed for the extraction of intermediate outcomes, such as averted unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, and pregnancy-related deaths.
The model comprised eight health states as illustrated in Fig. 1 and listed below: i. The not sexually active (NSA) state included women who were not sexually active. ii. The modern contraception (MC) state included women with a met need for family planning by MC. iii. The intentionally not using modern contraceptives (INC) state included women who intentionally did not use MC. iv. The unintentionally not using modern contraceptives (UNC) state included women with an unmet demand for MC. v. The intended pregnancy state included women who experienced a pregnancy due to INC. vi. The unintended pregnancy state included women who experienced a pregnancy due to UNC or the failure of an MC method. vii. The death state included women who died due to the background mortality rate. viii. The pregnancy-related death state included women who experienced pregnancy-related death due to abortion or complications during the pregnancy or delivery.

All women start in the not-sexually active state and may stay in this state or transition to a sexually active state at the end of a cycle. Sexually active women may either be using modern contraceptives (MC) or not, and non-use may either be intentional (INC) or unintentional, i.e. having unmet demand (UNC). All sexually active women may become pregnant, either intendedly or unintendedly. The women may at any point transition to the death state, here illustrated in the bottom right corner. A transition to the pregnancy-related death states requires that the woman has been sexually active and pregnant in the two preceding cycles.
The cycle length was set to one year, and input data were obtained from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). NSA was defined as not having had sexual intercourse during the four weeks preceding the EDHS. Modern contraceptive methods were defined in accordance with the EDHS and included male and female sterilization , contraceptive pills , intrauterine devices , injectables, female and male condoms, implants, the standard days method, the lactational amenorrhea method , and emergency methods ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2016 ). We assumed that users of traditional contraceptive methods, such as rhythm or withdrawal, had an unmet need for family planning and belonged to the UNC state. From MC and UNC, one could transition to “unintended pregnancy,” while women in INC could transition to “intended pregnancy.” The two pregnancy states were similar in terms of the events a woman could experience in them: an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, a complicated pregnancy and delivery, pregnancy-related death, and mortality from other causes. In the unintended pregnancy state, women could also experience induced abortion, either in or outside a health care facility . The model distinguished between intended and unintended pregnancy to assess how the latter varied with increased use of MC. Correspondingly, we also distinguished between death and pregnancy-related death to assess the impacts on mortality.
The model simulated sexual and reproductive health events, including pregnancies, induced abortions, uncomplicated births and deliveries, complicated births and deliveries, and potential pregnancy-related deaths. The initial distribution was based on EDHS data on sexual activity and the prevalence of MC methods. Of the cohort, 85% started in the NSA state, while the remaining 15% were distributed between the MC, INC, and UNC states based on the prevalence of met and unmet need for MC. All women in the MC, INC, and UNC states had a chance of pregnancy.
From MC and UNC, one could transition to “unintended pregnancy,” while women in INC could transition to “intended pregnancy.” The probability of this happening in the MC state was set to equal the failure rate of 2.2% for MC methods ( Polis et al., 2016 ), and it was initially set to 85% in the INC and UNC states ( Trussell, 2009 ). The latter probability was adjusted for the prevalence of menopause in specific age groups, defined as the “percentage of all women who are not pregnant and not postpartum amenorrhoeic whose last menstrual period occurred 6 or more months before the survey” ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2016 ). Further adjustments were made to account for Ethiopia's rate of infertility ( Rutstein and Shah, 2004 ) and to exclude women who experienced miscarriages ( Magnus et al., 2019 ). The adjustments were done by multiplying the relevant probabilities, and our final age-specific probabilities are presented in the Appendix ( Table A2 ).
Women in each health state could at any point transition to the death state. The probability of this transition was determined by age-specific death rates for Ethiopian women from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) life tables ( WHO, 2016 ), from which the age-specific pregnancy-related female deaths were subtracted ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2016 ). Transition to the pregnancy-related death state, however, could happen only in the event of induced abortion or complicated pregnancy or delivery. The abortion rate was set at 13%, mirroring the proportion of unintended pregnancies in Ethiopia that ended in abortion in 2014 ( Moore et al., 2016 ). We assumed that no women with an intended pregnancy would undergo abortion. The probability of pregnancy-related death was set at 0.7% for unsafe abortions and 0.002% for abortions in health care facilities ( Baggaley et al., 2010 ). The probability of maternal death was set at 0.412% in the national model, mirroring the maternal mortality rate of 412 per 100,000 live Ethiopian births, and the probability of non-fatal complications was set at 15% ( Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Health et al., 2017 ). Global discount rates of 3% were entered for QALYs, costs, and OOPs.
The only differences between the status quo scenario and the scenario with met demand for MC were the prevalence of MC among sexually active women and the rate of discontinuation. The prevalence of MC methods among sexually active, non-pregnant women was calculated by summing the prevalence of MC and UNC in the baseline scenario. The proportion of women in the INC state was the same in both scenarios, as we did not assume their intentions would change. Discontinuation rates among women using MC were reduced in the scenario with met demand, eliminating those who discontinued due to problems with access to MC. Age-specific transition probabilities were calculated based on age-specific data from the 2016 EDHS, and Markov probability analyses were run to confirm that the probabilities correlated with real data. Transition probabilities for the national model are provided in Table A1 in the appendix. The probabilities that differ between the two scenarios are marked in bold.
The effectiveness of the intervention (fulfilling the demand for MC) was estimated by comparing the number of QALYs in each of the two scenarios. For each cycle in the Markov model, improvements in the use of contraception led to fewer unintended pregnancies, complications, induced abortions, and deaths. This, again captured as improved survival and quality of life and summarized as QALYs over the time horizon of the model. The QALYs were generated using health utilities. A one-year cycle with no event was assigned a utility value of 1 and death a utility value of 0 ( Whitehead and Ali, 2010 ). In the event of an induced abortion, a complicated pregnancy, or an unintended pregnancy, a disability weight was subtracted from the utility value of 1. Accordingly, a year lived with abortion was given a utility value of 0.9; for complicated pregnancy the value was set at 0.824 and for unintended pregnancy at 0.68 ( IHME, 2017 ; Lundsberg et al., 2017 ). Calculating the incremental effectiveness of meeting the demand for MC compared to the status quo scenario yielded the average QALY gained per woman.
Cost data were gathered from published reports and converted to 2019 USD ( Berman et al., 2016 ; Vlassoff et al., 2012 ). The costs entered as input data were the average costs of primary hospitals and health centers, as the relevant services are provided at both types of facility. The cost of abortion in a health care facility was assumed to be $13.92, half the cost of a delivery, and the cost of a complicated delivery was assumed to be $55.68, twice the cost of a normal delivery . All costs are displayed in Table 1 . For each cycle in the Markov model, all costs were summarized and calculated over the time horizon of the model as average cost per woman. Table 1 .

(2011) Treatment of post-abortion complications $33,26 47,00% Assumption based on ( Pearson et al., 2011 ) Costs are presented in 2019 US dollars. The prevalence is defined as the prevalence of out-of-pocket payments among those using the relevant services.
We compared the current level of met demand for MC to a hypothetical scenario in which 100% of the demand for MC was met. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the general model with national data, and for the quintile-specific models with quintile-specific data. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at 358 USD/QALY (50% of the gross domestic product per capita) in accordance with Woods and colleagues ( Woods et al., 2016 ; World Bank, 2019 ).
We used user fees as a proxy for OOPs. Data on OOPs were obtained from a study of user fees for maternity services in Ethiopia ( Pearson et al., 2011 ), which was the most recent evidence available on them. The model considered the average OOP experienced, the prevalence of OOPs, and the utilization of health care services. The value and prevalence of all OOPs are displayed in 2019 USD in Table 1 .
Intermediate health-related outcomes were calculated by comparing the status quo scenario to the scenario with met demand for MC; they included reductions in the number of unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, and pregnancy-related deaths. These outcomes were not reported as average values per woman but as the sum of all averted cases in each quintile across the 35 years.
To extend the initial Markov model and assess the distribution of health outcomes, costs, and OOPs across wealth quintiles, we replicated the model and created five distinct implementations in the TreeAge software, with 250,400 women (20%) in each. For most data in the EDHS that provide age-specific data, quintile-specific data are also provided. We divided the quintile-specific value by the average national value and used the result as a factor to obtain values that varied according to both wealth and age. Given the lack of data on maternal mortality at various wealth levels, quintile-specific maternal mortality was assumed to have a linear gradient between the quintiles, calculated by using the average of the gradients of the mortality rate for those under five years of age.
FRP was measured by the number of CHE cases averted. CHE was defined as health expenditure exceeding 10% of annual household expenditure. We used gross domestic product per capita as a proxy for per capita expenditure; the absolute thresholds for each wealth quintile are displayed in Table 2 . We then calculated the number of CHE cases averted due to increased use of MC. To be above the threshold for CHE, a woman had to use antenatal care (ANC) and experience a complicated delivery and an OOP related to it. The sum of the OOP for ANC and a complicated delivery was $222, exceeding the threshold for quintile 1. The prevalence of complicated pregnancies and associated OOPs was therefore used to calculate the number of CHE cases. The quintile-specific utilization rates of relevant maternal care services, which influenced the prevalence of OOP, are listed in Table 2 along with epidemiological data and CHE thresholds. Table 2 . Wealth-quintile specific input variables. Variable Quintile 1 Quintile 2 Quintile 3 Quintile 4 Quintile 5 Utilization of health care services (%) Antenatal care (ANC) 47.5 55.8 62.6 67.1 84.8 Delivery in health care facility 10.6 18.6 22.2 27.3 68.6 Postnatal care (PNC) 7.3 10.8 14.3 15.3 43.0 Epidemiological data Average expenditure per year per capita (USD) $274 $485 $684 $932 $1383 Average household size 4.69 4.82 4.80 4.72 3.61 Average household expenditure per year (USD) $1286 $2339 $3282 $4396 $4985 10% threshold (USD) $129 $234 $328 $440 $4989 Quintile 1 is the poorest, and quintile 5 is the wealthiest. The top rows show the percentage of women who used antenatal care, delivered in health care facility, and used post-natal care. The bottom rows show epidemiological data for each wealth quintile, including the 10% threshold for catastrophic health expenditure. Gross domestic product per capita was used as a proxy for expenditure per capita ( Central Statistical Agency Ethiopia and ICF, 2016 ; World Bank Group, 2015).
We performed both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to identify and compare the impact of the diverse variables on the ICER. Only constant variables were assessed, as the age-dependent variables did not fit the framework of a deterministic sensitivity analysis in the TreeAge software. Cost variables were given a variation of±50% of their numerical value, probabilities and utilities were given a variation of±25%, and the discount rate was set with a value of 0%–5%. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to further test the robustness of our model and validate the results. Beta distribution was used for probabilities and QALYs, while we used gamma distribution for all costs. The base-case value was used for the mean, and twice the mean was used as the standard deviation. We used Monte Carlo simulation to create 100,000 iterations.

Section: 3. Results

Meeting the demand for MC was deemed cost effective, and the ICER of 96.60 USD/QALY gained per woman was well below the WTP of 358 USD/QALY gained threshold in all wealth quintiles. Table 3 presents the ICER in each quintile as well as the incremental effectiveness and costs separately. All three parameters are presented as average per woman. QALYs were gained in all quintiles, especially in the two poorest quintiles, with an average of 0.59 and 0.62 per woman. The incremental cost per woman was also greatest in the poorest quintiles. The ICER did not follow a wealth-related gradient and was quite even across the quintiles. Table 3 . Cost-effectiveness and intermediate health outcomes.

Cases averted are presented as N (% reduction).
There was a substantial reduction in unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, and pregnancy-related deaths. Fig. 2 presents the number of intended and unintended pregnancies in all quintiles, both in the status quo scenario and the scenario with met demand for MC, in a cohort of 1,252,000 women followed over 35 years. As shown in the figure, the reduction in the number of unintended pregnancies was most substantial in the poorest quintile. As shown in Table 3 , the total number of unintended pregnancies was approximately 3,700,000 in the status quo scenario and 320,000 in the scenario in which demand for MC was met—an 88% reduction. The distribution of unintended pregnancies is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The total number of induced abortions avoided was approximately 308,000, an average of 8800 per year. Both the absolute and relative reduction was largest in the poorer quintiles when comparing the scenario with fulfilled demand for MC to the status quo baseline scenario. The total number of pregnancy-related deaths averted during the 35-year period was 9,000, a 34% reduction compared to the baseline. All values are shown in Table 4 .

Governmental cost and out-of-pocket payments are displayed as US dollars (% of total cost).
The annual total cost and the cost distribution between the government and OOP for each scenario are listed in Table 4 . For a cohort of 1,252,000 women followed over 35 years, the annual governmental cost was estimated to be $7,500,000 (79% of the total cost) at the current level of MC use and $9,400,000 (88% of the total cost) in the scenario with met demand for MC. Values for each quintile are also listed in Table 4 . The annual costs and the percentage change from the status quo scenario to the scenario with met demand are illustrated in Fig. 3 .

OOP was reduced across all wealth quintiles in the scenario with universal access to MC compared to the scenario with current coverage as displayed in Table 4 . The percentage reduction was largest in the poorest quintiles, 37% and 38%, compared to 24% in the richest. The reduction in OOP at the national level was 33%.
Health expenditure was catastrophic only for women who had to pay out of pocket for both antenatal care and complicated delivery. This was the case in both scenarios. Complications were experienced by 13.1% of pregnant women, and 57% of those women had to pay out of pocket for treatment. There were no cases of CHE associated with any other health outcomes. Cases of CHE were present in quintile 1, as the total OOP of ANC and complicated delivery ($222) exceeded the 10% threshold only for the poorest quintile. There were 110,000 cases of CHE in the status quo scenario. This number fell to around 70,000 when the demand for MC was met and the number of pregnancies was reduced.
The results of the deterministic sensitivity analysis are illustrated in a tornado diagram ( Fig. 4 ). According to this analysis, the cost of modern contraceptives, the disability weight of unintended pregnancy, and the cost of antenatal care were the parameters that affected the results to the greatest extent. The variables with a lower impact on the ICER than the discount rate are not shown in the diagram. Fig. 4 illustrates that the variations in the ICER were well below the WTP of 358 USD/QALY, even when these parameters were given variations of ± 25% and ± 50%.

Section: 4. Discussion

We assessed the health-related and financial effects of meeting the demand for MC in Ethiopia. Compared to the status quo, our analysis found it highly cost effective to meet the demand for MC both when it was assessed on a national level and separately for women of different wealth quintiles. Meeting the demand for MC would generate health benefits in terms of QALYs gained and in terms of averted unintended pregnancies, induced abortions, and pregnancy-related death, and these health gains were pro-poor. In the poorest quintile, there were also FRP benefits in terms of a reduced number of CHEs. Furthermore, the service financing was less regressive when meeting the demand for MC, as the percentage increase in annual governmental spending was highest in the poorest quintiles even when the numerical increase was greatest in the richest quintiles. Providing universal access to modern contraceptive methods is clearly equitable: government spending becomes more progressive and there is a clear reduction in unequal health outcomes.
Standard CEAs from other low- and middle-income countries have also concluded that access to MC is a highly cost-effective public health intervention ( Babigumira et al., 2012 ; Zakiyah et al., 2016 , 2019 ). Moreover, in Uganda and Indonesia, increased MC coverage was found to save costs. This has previously been described in an Ethiopian setting ( Sundaram et al., 2010 ) but was not supported by our study. This discrepancy is likely explained by the other studies’ assuming a 100% utilization of relevant health services while we used actual utilization rates (2016 EDHS).
Several ECEAs of other interventions in the Ethiopian health system have been conducted. These studies have shown that may interventions may contribute more to FRP while also providing evidence that there is heterogeneity in the FRP from interventions ( Johansson et al., 2017 ; Verguet et al., 2015 ; Verguet et al., 2016a , 2016b ). Quantifying this impact is therefore useful whether the impact is high or low. Our results could be relevant and, in principle, inform a decision about investing in MC versus another intervention with the same ICER but higher FRP benefits. The relatively low FRP benefits of MC may reflect the fact that this intervention is already fully funded by the Ethiopian government. For other interventions, universal public financing would replace OOPs, but for MC there are no existing copayments and therefore no OOP to replace. In addition, the OOPs for maternal care are also to a large extent covered by the government. Still, our findings demonstrate that increasing the coverage of MC in Ethiopia is cost effective and contributes to making the Ethiopian health care system more equitable.
Our study is the first ECEA to assess MC in Ethiopia. Because the utilization rates of diverse services mirror the true health-seeking behavior of fertile Ethiopian women, the results are likely to be highly relevant to policy makers. Moreover, our study contributes to the limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of scaling up MC services in low- and middle-income countries, where data are particularly limited regarding how costs and effects are distributed according to wealth.
Among the limitations of our study are the assumptions made regarding the cost of abortion and the cost of complicated delivery, on which we found no existing data. However, the deterministic sensitivity analysis found that these two assumptions had a limited effect on the ICER. Assumptions were also made regarding transition probabilities, particularly the probability of remaining in the NSA state, and these were largely based on age-specific prevalence data presented in the EDHS. We ran several Markov probability analyses in the TreeAge Software where we varied the probability to remain in the NSA state to assess whether this represented realistic values. Markov probability analyses provide information on how the cohort is distributed between the different health stated throughout the 35 cycles, and with the transition probabilities listed in Table A1 , the prevalence of being not sexually active correlated well with data from the 2016 EDHS. The validity of the model outcomes was further assessed by comparing the model's results to EDHS data, particularly regarding the fertility and maternal mortality rates, which were comparable to the true rates. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis further emphasized the robustness of our model, as the intervention was deemed cost effective in 99.39% of the 100,000 iterations with a WTP threshold of $358.
Another limitation, also found by others, is the potential societal changes in fertility preference and ideal number of children over time. Our model assumed constant fertility intentions throughout the 35-year period, although the fertility rate and ideal number of children are likely to decrease if existing trends continue ( World Bank Group, 2020 ). Moreover, and importantly, we did not include the wider array of benefits associated with the use of MC and prevention of unintended pregnancies, such as personal employment and educational and economic effects. The potential benefits are therefore underestimated. This limitation applies to existing research as well.
The use of MC is closely linked to economic growth through phenomena such as the demographic dividend. The United Nations Population Fund defines a demographic dividend as an economic growth potential created by a shift in the age structure of a population that results in a predominantly working-age population. Such a phenomenon occurs when there is a growing number of young people concurrent with a decrease in fertility. The development of a demographic dividend can be facilitated by interventions such as family planning, skilled birth attendance, health systems enhancement, comprehensive sexuality education, etc., as these interventions contribute to lower school-dropout rates, fewer early and unplanned pregnancies, and lower maternal morbidity ( United Nations Population Fund, 2016 ). Ethiopia has a young population, but it must reduce birth and death rates further for a demographic transition to happen (Ministry of Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Health, 2016 ). One of the main drivers of achieving a demographic dividend is labor supply, and there is a higher probability of women entering the workforce when family sizes decline ( Bloom et al., 2003 ). Future work that models these effects on a larger scale would make a valuable contribution to the literature.
Although the ICER is slightly higher in the poorest quintile, the FRP and equity benefits among the worse off imply that they should nevertheless be prioritized ( Eregata et al., 2020 ). One cannot bring a society forward as one entity if certain groups trail behind. Investments in MC translate into important health and non-health benefits and are cost effective through reductions in future costs and complications, and societal development is achieved ( Parks and Peipert, 2016 ; Sully et al., 2020 ). If the ICERs had varied more according to wealth, it would have been valuable to discuss equity-efficiency trade-offs in even more detail. ECEA results are however of interest also when distinct trade-offs are not present, as ECEAs provide a dashboard of results that make it possible for policymakers to review both efficiency and equity.
Our study provides evidence of the positive effects of scaling up the coverage of MC methods and reducing the discrepancies in access across wealth groups. Further research is needed to identify and design policies that truly contribute to increased coverage of MCs and reduced inequalities. Interventions that generate demand is another research area that could produce results relevant for policymaking in most low- and middle-income countries. How can governments and non-governmental organizations work to further increase the demand for MCs, and what are the costs and effects of increasing the existing demand, particularly in groups where it is low, such as in rural areas? Finally, an important research area is to further integrate the wider array of benefits discussed above into economic modeling and, ideally, to quantify and/or describe how increased MC coverage contributes to female empowerment, employment, and education.
The Ethiopian Ministry of Health's commitment to sexual and reproductive health, improved maternal mortality, gender equality, and the Sustainable Development Goals illustrates the national and international interest in data related to MC. This ECEA found that meeting the demand for MC in Ethiopia was highly cost effective and generated health benefits across all wealth quintiles, particularly in the poorest quintiles, where an FRP benefit was observed as well. Meeting the demand for MC therefor contributes to reduced inequalities, in particular health inequalities.
