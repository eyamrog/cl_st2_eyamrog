Title: Trends in access to health services, financial protection and satisfaction between 2010 and 2016: Has China achieved the goals of its health system reform?


Abstract: Abstract

Guided by the principle of universal health coverage, China began its complex health system reform in 2009. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this study assesses trends in healthcare utilization, financial protection, and satisfaction between 2010 and 2016. We use difference-in-means tests and regression analysis to evaluate overall trends and compare subsample results by urban/rural residence and income quartiles to examine changes in inequity. Our results show that China has achieved substantial improvements in access to healthcare services and financial protection since the health system reform in 2009. First, China has experienced a substantial increase in both inpatient and outpatient care utilization between 2010 and 2016. Second, people receive better financial protection by measures of health insurance coverage , inpatient reimbursement rate, the likelihood of incurring catastrophic health expenditure, and the likelihood of medical impoverishment. Third, inequity in financial protection by income quartiles has significantly decreased, though poorer groups remain more vulnerable. However, we do not observe a concurrent increase in satisfaction towards the health system. We also find that people are more willing to seek medical services in hospitals rather than primary care institutions. All these results suggest that China's ongoing health system reform should pay more attention to establishing a tiered health delivery system, strengthening financial protection for the poor, and increasing responsiveness to rising expectations.

Section: 1. Introduction

China's health system began market-oriented reforms in the 1980s when China embarked on its economic reforms. The Chinese government gradually underfunded public hospitals and reduced subsidies for public health insurance schemes. These reforms led to the inability of China's health system to provide accessible and affordable healthcare services ( Blumenthal and Hsiao, 2005 ). At the dawn of the new millennium, more than 75% of the Chinese population was uninsured and the share of out-of-pocket expenditure in total health expenditure verged on 60% ( China Health Statistical Yearbook, 2018 ). “Seeing a doctor is hard; seeing a doctor is expensive” was a widespread saying that reflected popular discontent towards the healthcare system.
In response to the complaints, China initiated an ambitious plan of health system reform in 2009 with multiple goals; among them, increasing healthcare accessibility, strengthening financial protection, and improving satisfaction are three core goals in this reform ( Central Committee of the Communist Party and State Council, 2009 ). As a complex, large-scale reform affecting 1.4 billion people, China's health system reform evolved with changing priorities. From 2009 to 2012, priority was given to expanding health insurance coverage , strengthening primary care , establishing an essential medicine program, providing free public health services , and conducting pilot reforms of public hospitals ( Yip et al., 2012 ). From 2013 onwards, the reform focused more on changing wasteful practices, reducing inefficiencies and improving satisfaction in the delivery system. Relevant policies included the zero mark-up policy on drug sales, adjusting the distorted pricing schedule for medical services, encouraging systemic reforms of public hospitals, changing payment methods, and establishing medical alliances ( Liu et al., 2017 ). Over the course of the reform, reform implementation was consistently backed by the government's strong political will and financial support. A 3.5-fold increase in government health expenditure between 2008 and 2018 and the establishment of a leading group chaired by the vice premier for policy coordination were two testaments of the government's commitment to the healthcare reform. China's health system reform also attracted wide international attention as it was anticipated that this large-scale reform could provide valuable global lessons for other countries ( World Bank Group et al., 2016 ).
While many initiatives in China's health system reform showed substantial progress ( Fu et al., 2017 ; Jian et al., 2015 ; Liu et al., 2017 ; Meng et al., 2012 , 2019b ; Yip et al., 2012 ), few studies have directly examined trends in access to health services, financial protection and satisfaction since the start of the reform. These indicators are the core goals of China's health system reform ( Li, 2011 , 2012 ; Meng et al., 2012 ; Yip et al., 2012 ). Performing a trend analysis with regards to these indicators would help researchers and policymakers to better understand the achievements of China's health system reform, as well as challenges further ahead. Moreover, these indicators are also frequently used to evaluate the performance of health systems in the international literature ( Durán et al., 2011 ; Gakidou et al., 2006 ; Murray and Frenk, 2000 ; Roberts et al., 2003 ). Results from such a trend analysis would contribute to the development of healthcare systems in other nations.
In this study, we use four waves of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) from 2010 to 2016 to examine the performance of China's health system reform. We conduct the statistical analysis using χ 2 tests, t-tests, linear regressions and Probit estimations. Our results show that China's health system reform has achieved substantial improvements in access to health care . Utilization of inpatient and outpatient care has increased substantially between 2010 and 2016; gaps in healthcare utilization are small between urban and rural residents, and income inequity in healthcare utilization is shrinking. These findings suggest that the difficulty of accessing healthcare services in China may have decreased. We also find great improvements in financial protection between 2010 and 2016. The likelihood of incurring catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment have decreased remarkably while social health insurance coverage and inpatient reimbursement rate show significant increases; income inequity in financial protection has also fallen. However, these improvements are not mirrored in people's satisfaction. People's satisfaction towards China's health system and their most-frequently-visited healthcare facilities remain unchanged or even become lower, implying that rising expectations for better health services might outpace the progress of health system reform.

Section: 2. Methods

We use the CFPS as our main data source to assess the achievements and challenges of China's health system reform. We also use data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the China Statistical Yearbook, and the China Health Statistical Yearbook to provide supplementary evidence. A description of CHARLS dataset may be found in the Appendix .
The CFPS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey funded by Peking University and is carried out by the Institute of Social Science Survey at Peking University ( Xie and Hu, 2014 ). The survey is approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at Peking University (Approval IRB00001052-14010). It is a biennial survey launched in 2010 with four waves of publicly released datasets comprising the years of 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. The CFPS is conducted in 25 provinces that cover 94.5% of China's population. It collects extensive information on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, physical and psychological wellbeing , cognitive ability, healthcare utilization and numerous other indicators. Up to now, the CFPS data is widely used in health services research and health policy research (for example, see Qi and Wu, 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2017 ). In this study, we primarily use information on healthcare utilization, medical expenditure, household economic status, demographic characteristics, and social attitudes to conduct our analysis.
We use three sets of indicators to measure healthcare utilization, financial protection, and satisfaction, respectively. Appendix Table 1 gives a detailed description of each indicator used in this study. As noted earlier in this study, indicators in these three classes are frequently used to assess the performance of health systems. For example, both the Performance Framework by the World Health Organization (WHO) ( Murray and Frenk, 2000 ) and the Control Knobs Framework ( Roberts et al., 2003 ) regard financial protection as one of the key goals of health system. Satisfaction indicators are used as one of the final goals to evaluate health system performance in the Control Knobs Framework. Although access to healthcare, often measured by healthcare utilization, is an intermediate goal in most frameworks, it is widely used to assess health system reform progress and calculate universal health coverage index ( Gakidou et al., 2006 ; Meng et al., 2012 ; Wagstaff et al., 2015 , 2016 ).
We use four indicators to examine trends in access to healthcare over the period of the healthcare reform: hospital admission rate, outpatient care utilization rate, the likelihood of not seeking medical services when feeling ill, and the share of newborns delivered in hospital. It should be noted that increases in healthcare utilization are not equivalent to improvements in access to healthcare services because overutilization or unnecessary utilization may exist. However, in the absence of better measures and data to support reliable measures, utilization indicators are still reasonable measures for access to healthcare, given that China is a developing country and under-utilization was a concern before the reform. In fact, these indicators have been widely used in impact evaluations of universal health coverage initiatives ( Wagstaff et al., 2015 , 2016 ). Because respondents aged 15 and younger are interviewed with separate questionnaires, we analyze the indicators of not seeking medical care when feeling ill and outpatient care utilization separately by age group. The analysis of hospital delivery for newborns is limited to babies born within one year prior to the survey.
We use four indicators to measure financial protection: social health insurance coverage , inpatient reimbursement rate, households with catastrophic health expenditures (CHE), and households with medical impoverishment. In China, social health insurance schemes primarily include the Public Free Health Insurance for public servants and government entity employees (“ gong-fei-yi-liao ”), the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI), the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI), and the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS). Households with catastrophic health expenditures are defined as the households whose health expenditure is at least 40% of total household expenditure net of food consumption. Considering that the trends in catastrophic health expenditure may be sensitive to thresholds and definitions of ability to pay, we explore the robustness of our results with alternative specifications such as thresholds of 10% and 25% ( Cylus et al., 2018 ; Wagstaff et al., 2018a ). Furthermore, a household is classified as experiencing medical impoverishment if its consumption including out-of-pocket health expenditure is above the poverty line and its consumption excluding out-of-pocket medical expenditure is below the poverty line ( Dmytraczenko and Almeida, 2015 ; Li et al., 2012 ; World Health Organization, 2015 ; Xu et al., 2003 , 2007 ). Taking from the poverty line set by the World Bank (1.9 USD per person-day in 2010) and the purchasing power parity between China and the United States (3.308 RMB/USD in 2010), this study defines the poverty line as 2300 RMB per person-year in 2010 and adjusts this threshold by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for each of the waves of 2012, 2014, and 2016. Note that the Chinese government also uses 2300 RMB per person-year as the poverty line in its anti-poverty program.
In the CFPS, respondents are asked to rate perceived severity of social issues, including social security, housing, health care , education, employment, inequality, environment, and corruption on a 0-to-10 scale, with “0” indicating the least severe and “10” the most severe. We use this severity score for health care to measure people's satisfaction towards the health system. In addition, respondents are asked to rate their satisfaction towards their most-frequently-visited health facilities on a five-point scale. We construct a binary indicator of satisfaction towards health facilities, recoded as “satisfied” (very satisfied or satisfied) versus “less satisfied” (moderate, unsatisfied or very unsatisfied).
We examine the trends in health care utilization , financial protection, and satisfaction by comparing results between each consecutive survey year and between 2010 and 2016. Considering the CFPS is a longitudinal dataset and it oversamples five provinces, we perform statistical analyses using the cross-sectional weights for each wave to ensure that our results are nationally representative ( Xie et al., 2017 ). We present variable means with 90% confidence intervals (CIs) and differences between survey years, and use χ 2 tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables to test for statistical significance.
Given that urban and rural area in China differ drastically in social and economic development, we separate data by urban/rural residence status to examine inequity in healthcare utilization, financial protection, and satisfaction. We also construct income quartiles by household income per capita to investigate changes in inequity; an increase in quartile (Q1, Q2, Q3 to Q4) corresponds to a progressive increase in household income per capita. In addition, we calculate the concentration index by income for each survey year to examine the trend in inequity.
Furthermore, we perform regression analysis to investigate the trends in inequity in healthcare utilization, financial protection, and satisfaction after controlling for other sociodemographic and economic variables. We use ordinary least square (OLS) estimation for inpatient reimbursement rate and satisfaction score, and we use Probit estimation for all binary dependent variables. A simple estimation model can be written as follows: Y i = α + δ 1 × U r b a n i + δ 2 × I n c o m e G r o u p i + X i β + ε i
The subscript i indicates an individual or a household. Y i represents the dependent variables: indicators of healthcare utilization, financial protection, and satisfaction. X i is a vector of control variables, including age, gender, education level , marital status, chronic disease status, etc. The key variables of interest are Urban i and IncomeGroup i . Urban i equals 1 if the respondent is an urban resident and 0 otherwise. IncomeGroup i is a vector of dummy variables representing income quartiles by household income per capita. The coefficients δ 1 and δ 2 captures inequity between urban and rural areas and inequity by income groups. Because we are interested in the trends in inequity, we run the regression on each respective wave and examine the trend in the coefficients δ 1 and δ 2 over the years covered.

Section: 3. Results

Table 1 shows summary statistics for demographic variables and household income in the CFPS. We compare these results to the national level, as shown in Appendix Table 2 , and find that the CFPS sample is comparable to the national level in all respects with the sole exception of a lower education level .

Household residence in the CFPS is not based on Hukou status, but follows the definition of the National Statistics Bureau. Education information is only available for the respondents aged 16 and above. For marital status, the status of “not married” includes “never been married”, “cohabitation”, “divorced”, and “widowed”. All income results are adjusted by CPI and are converted to comparable income in 2010.
Table 2 shows trends in healthcare utilization between 2010 and 2016. Hospital admission rate nearly doubled between 2010 and 2016, increasing from 7.41% to 13.55%. Older population is the primary driver of this increase (see Appendix Fig. 1 ). The hospital admission rate for respondents aged 65 and above increased from 14.57% in 2010 to 28.16% in 2016 while the changes for groups aged between 5 and 45 years old remained relatively small. Outpatient care utilization also experienced a significant increase between 2010 and 2016. For respondents aged 16 and above, the probability of visiting a doctor within two weeks prior to the survey increased from 16.23% to 22.69%, while the likelihood of not seeking medical care when feeling ill dropped from 32.88% to 25.13%. Moreover, we find a measurable increase in the share of newborns delivered in hospital. The likelihood of hospital delivery for newborns born within one year prior to the survey approached 100% in 2016, reaching as high as 98.56%. These trends in health care utilization are consistent with the findings based on data from the China Health Statistical Yearbook. As shown in Appendix Fig. 2 , we observe a continuous growth in hospital admissions and outpatient visits between 2010 and 2016. Table 2 .

Hospital admission rate measures the probability of being hospitalized within one year prior to the survey for people of all ages. Not seeking medical care when ill (age 16+) measures the probability of not seeking medical care when feeling physically ill within two weeks prior to the survey. Not seeking medical care when ill (age 0–15) measures the share of respondents between 0 and 15 years old who did not seek medical care when feeling physically ill within one month prior to the survey. Outpatient visit (age 16+) measures the probability of visiting a doctor within two weeks prior to the survey. Outpatient visit (age 0–15) measures the probability of visiting a doctor within one month prior to the survey for respondents aged between 0 and 15. Hospital delivery (age 0–1) measures the share of newborns delivered in hospital within one year prior to the survey.
Compared to rural residents, urban residents aged 16 and above experienced a greater increase in healthcare utilization between 2010 and 2016. Hospital admission rates for urban and rural residents increased by 7.6 percentage points and 3.7 percentage points (pp) respectively. The increase in outpatient visits for urban residents was larger and the likelihood of not seeking medical care when feeling ill decreased more among urban residents, compared to rural residents. However, urban children experienced an insignificant change in the likelihood of not seeking medical care when feeling ill, while the incidence of this indicator for rural children decreased significantly by 7.7 pp between 2010 and 2016. The share of rural newborns delivered in hospital increased by 13.1 pp from 2010 to 2016, while that of urban newborns showed an increase of just 2.6 pp.
At the beginning of the health system reform, rural residents visited doctors more frequently, exhibited a hospital admission rate almost equal to their urban counterparts, and were in comparison much less likely to deliver newborns in hospital. As shown in Table 2 , the gap between urban and rural residents in health care utilization has narrowed in all regards except hospital admission rate. As of 2016, there are no statistically significant differences in outpatient care utilization and hospital delivery for newborns between the urban and rural population.
We further examine people's choice for health care facilities . The CFPS asks respondents about their choice of most-frequently-visited healthcare facilities, including hospitals and primary care facilities. Fig. 1 shows the proportion of people aged 16 and older who choose hospitals as their most-frequently-visited healthcare facility over the years. From 2010 to 2016, the national proportion of people who usually go to hospitals for medical services increased from 13.47% to 42.31%. This proportion increased from 23.49% in 2010 to 51.08% in 2016 for urban residents and jumped from 7.72% in 2010 to 28.69% in 2016 for rural residents; during this period, urban residents were consistently more likely than their rural counterparts to choose hospitals for medical care. This increasing trend remains unaffected after controlling for chronic disease status and other control variables ( Appendix Table 3 ), suggesting that the increasing trend is not the result of the shift in population health. Instead, this increasing share of people visiting hospitals reflects people's willingness to seek high-quality healthcare services. National statistical data confirms this trend of increasingly disproportionate healthcare utilization at higher-tier healthcare facilities. Appendix Fig. 3 shows that among all outpatient visits, the proportion of hospital visits increased from 35.02% in 2010 to 41.22% in 2016. Among all hospital visits, the share of visits at tertiary hospitals reached 49.8% in 2016 ( China Health Statistical Yearbook, 2018 ).

Primary care facilities include community healthcare centers, township hospitals, community healthcare posts, village clinics, and clinics. Data source: CFPS 2010-2016.
Fig. 2 shows trends in healthcare utilization by income quartiles. From 2010 to 2016, all quartiles experienced a rise in hospital admission rate. Hospital admission rate for individuals in Q1, the poorest quartile, increased from 8.61% to 13.93%. For Q4, the wealthiest quartile, this figure increased from 6.97% to 14.96%. In 2016, cross-sectional differences in hospital admission rate between income quartiles were small and statistically insignificant, and the concentration index by income for hospital admissions in 2016 was merely 0.005. We find that the probability of not seeking medical care when feeling ill decreased significantly for all income quartiles from 2010 to 2016. For Q1, the figure decreased from 28.74% to 21.84%, while Q4 experienced a decrease from 37.54% to 29.30%. The wealthier quartiles were consistently less likely to seek medical care when feeling ill than the poorer quartiles.

Income quartiles are sorted by household income per capita. An increase of quartile (Q1, Q2, Q3 to Q4) corresponds to a progressive increase in household income per capita. Data source: CFPS 2010-2016.
Consistent with the decreasing probability of not seeking medical care when feeling ill, all quartiles became more likely to use outpatient care from 2010 to 2016. The likelihood of outpatient visits within two weeks prior to the survey for Q1 increased from 19.98% in 2010 to 26.42% in 2016. For Q4, this number increased from 13.55% to 19.70%. The concentration index for outpatient care utilization is negative in all survey years, suggesting that the poorer quartiles used more outpatient care than the wealthier quartiles. The gap between Q1 and Q4 remained roughly unchanged. In addition, hospitals, rather than primary healthcare facilities, became more favorable for all income quartiles during this period: The probability of choosing a hospital as the most-frequently-visited healthcare facility increased from 8.29% to 29.64% for Q1 and doubled from 29.98% to 64.06% for Q4. The gap in healthcare facility choice between Q1 and Q4 remained significant between 2010 and 2016.
Table 3 shows trends in financial protection over the years. Social health insurance coverage rate increased from 76.31% to 90.10% between 2010 and 2016, suggesting that China is approaching nearly universal health insurance coverage. This coverage rate is slightly lower than in the administrative data, which may be due to unawareness of enrollment among some respondents, especially among rural-to-urban migrant workers ( Lattof, 2018 ). The insurance coverage rate increased from 71.90% to 88.85% for urban residents and jumped from 80.42% to 92.20% for rural residents. Table 3 .

Social health insurance coverage measures the coverage rate of any social health insurance schemes, including UEBMI, URBMI, NRCMS, and the Public Free Health Insurance. Due to changes in the CFPS questionnaire, inpatient reimbursement rate (16+) is measured in slightly different ways across years. In 2010 and 2012, inpatient reimbursement rate is calculated as the ratio of total reimbursements for hospitalization over total inpatient costs. In 2014 and 2016, inpatient reimbursement rate is approximated as the ratio of total reimbursements for inpatient and outpatient care over total medical costs for those who have been hospitalized within one year prior to the survey. Households with catastrophic health expenditure measures the proportion of households whose out-of-pocket health expenditure is at least 40% of total household expenditure netting of food expenditure. Households with medical impoverishment measures the proportion of households if its consumption is above the poverty line but its consumption excluding medical expenditure is below the poverty line. Poverty line in this study is defined as 2300 RMB per person-year in 2010 and is adjusted by CPI for waves of 2012, 2014, and 2016.
In addition, we observe an increase in insurance generosity. Inpatient reimbursement rate based on the CFPS dataset increased from 29.41% to 41.20% between 2010 and 2016, which is similar with the CHARLS results (as shown in Appendix Table 4 ); inpatient reimbursement rate based on CHARLS experienced a growth from 37.17% in 2011 to 46.67% in 2015, and outpatient reimbursement rate increased by approximately 5 percentage points. Of note, the results of inpatient reimbursement rate from CFPS are slightly lower than the ones from CHARLS. This is because the calculation of the inpatient reimbursement rate for CFPS respondents in 2014 and 2016 is slightly contaminated by reimbursements for outpatient care (see Appendix Table 1 for more details). Given that reimbursements for outpatient care are much less generous than inpatient care, the CFPS rate for 2014 and 2016 should be viewed as a lower bound estimation for the actual inpatient reimbursement rate.
As shown in Table 3 , inpatient reimbursement rate for urban and rural residents were 44.25% and 34.58% in 2016, respectively. This gap for urban and rural residents remains at about 10 pp throughout the years, largely owing to differences in reimbursement rates of the three insurance schemes, as shown in Appendix Fig. 4 .
Along with increases in social health insurance coverage and insurance benefits, we observe significant decreases in the likelihood of incurring catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment. As shown in Table 3 , the proportion of households with catastrophic health expenditures decreased from 14.35% in 2010 to 10.73% in 2016. Urban households were less likely to incur catastrophic health expenditures than rural households in all survey years. The gap in urban and rural residents remained large across years. Considering that catastrophic health expenditure may be sensitive to the definition, threshold and data source, we reexamine the trends in catastrophic health expenditure using alternative definitions, thresholds (see Appendix Table 5 ) and datasets (see Appendix Table 4 ) to confirm the robustness of our results in Table 3 . All results using alternative specifications show a similarly decreasing trend in the likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure among both urban and rural populations. Furthermore, Table 3 shows that the proportion of households suffering from medical impoverishment decreased by half from 6.29% to 3.19%. Although rural areas experienced a larger reduction, the gap between urban and rural residents remained wide in 2016.
Fig. 3 displays trends in financial protection by income quartile. Although there was little difference in social health insurance coverage across income groups, wealthier groups were better financially protected. For instance, compared to Q1, Q4 received higher inpatient reimbursement rates and were at lower risk of incurring catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment. Nevertheless, gaps across income groups narrowed during the period between 2010 and 2016 – the gap in inpatient reimbursement rate between Q1 and Q4 decreased from 15.74% to 12.37%, and the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure for the poorest quartile of households fell by 6.3 pp from 22.91% to 16.64%, compared to reductions of 2.6 pp, 1.6 pp, and 2.6 pp for Q2, Q3 and Q4, respectively. The concentration index for catastrophic health expenditure changed from −0.21 in 2010 to −0.16 in 2016. The gap in medical impoverishment also shrank across income groups. From 2010 to 2016, the probability of medical impoverishment for Q1 and Q4 decreased by 3.9 pp and 0.9 pp, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows respondents' perceived severity of problems in health care and other social issues. The average score for perceived severity of health care was 5.61 in 2012. This figure was statistically higher than the score for housing and social security, and was lower than the score for corruption , environment, inequality, and employment. It suggests that people's perceived severity of healthcare problems occupied a middling rank among all social issues. The average score for perceived severity towards healthcare issue in 2016 increased slightly to 5.72, suggesting that satisfaction towards the health system did not improve over this period. Appendix Fig. 5 displays the severity score of the healthcare problem by income quartiles. We find that wealthier quartiles viewed the healthcare problem as more severe than did poorer quartiles in both 2012 and 2016, though differences were slight.

Notes: Respondents are asked to rate their perceived severity of problems in social issues on a scale from 0 to 10. “0” indicates the least severe and “10” is the most severe. We use this severity score for health care to measure people’s satisfaction towards the health system. Data source: CFPS 2012 and 2016.
Appendix Fig. 6 shows the trends in the proportion of people who are satisfied with their most-frequently-visited healthcare facility. Appendix Fig. 6a shows the results by urban and rural residents. We observe little change in the satisfaction rate between 2010 and 2016, and differences between urban and rural residents were negligible in most survey years. Appendix Fig. 6b shows the results by income quartiles. In later survey waves (i.e., 2014 and 2016), wealthier quartiles are shown to have been less satisfied with their most-frequently-visited healthcare facilities than poorer quartiles.
Table 4 reports the results of regressions on indicators for healthcare utilization and financial protection. It shows that urban residents use more inpatient services but the income inequity in inpatient services utilization is insignificant. This results implies that the pattern in Fig. 2 may be driven by rural and urban differences. Moreover, consistent with the descriptive results, urban residents and wealthier groups used less outpatient care compared to rural residents and poorer groups. It might be attributable to the higher opportunity cost of time for visiting a doctor among wealthier groups ( Zhang et al., 2018a ). Table 4 also shows that income inequity in financial protection is narrowing. Although the wealthier groups are still better off, the gap between the poorest group and the wealthiest group has been greatly reduced in the incidence rate of both catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment.

Income quartiles are sorted by household income per capita. An increase of quartile (Q1, Q2, Q3 to Q4) corresponds to a progressive increase in income quartiles. Q1 and the rural area are used as reference groups. We include age, age squared, marriage status, education level, gender, chronic disease status, and province fixed effects as controls. All regressions are adjusted by cross-sectional weights and robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. Results for respondents aged 15 and younger are available upon request. We use OLS estimation for inpatient reimbursement rate and we use Probit estimation for binary variables, reporting marginal effects in this table.

Section: 4. Discussion and conclusion

Guided by the principle of equity and universal health coverage, the Chinese government has been diligently reforming its health system since 2009. This study analyzes trends in healthcare utilization, financial protection, and satisfaction towards the health system, which comprise the three core goals of China's health system reform. Three encouraging results emerge. First, China has experienced a considerable increase in utilization of both inpatient and outpatient care between 2010 and 2016. Second, people receive better financial protection by measures of social health insurance coverage, inpatient reimbursement rate, and the likelihood of incurring catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment. Third, inequity measured by income quartiles has significantly decreased for financial protection. In addition, China has made great achievements in improving population health and reducing health inequity since 2009. For example, life expectancy has increased from 74.83 in 2010 to 76.7 in 2016, and differences in the maternal mortality rate between low, middle, and high-income provinces have decreased substantially from 2009 to 2017 ( Meng et al., 2019a ). All these results suggest that China has made laudable progress in achieving its goals of the health system reform.
Increasing health care utilization suggest great improvements in access to healthcare services after the reform in 2009. These improvements may largely benefit from massive infrastructure investments and increasing physical access to healthcare facilities. The number of hospital beds per 1000 people increased from 3.58 in 2010 to 5.37 in 2016 ( China Health Statistical Yearbook, 2018 ). By 2013, 63.9% of all households lived within one kilometer of the nearest healthcare facility, and only 5.0% of rural households and 1.8% of urban households lived over five kilometers away from the nearest healthcare facility ( Center for Health Statistics and Information, 2015 ). In 2017, more than 84% of residents could reach the nearest healthcare facility within 15 min ( Liu, 2018 ). In addition, the rapid expansion of social health insurance with more generous benefits may be another explanation for the increasing health care utilization ( Cheng et al., 2015 ; Huang and Gan, 2017 ; Lei and Lin, 2009 ; Liu and Zhao, 2014 ; Pan et al., 2016 ). However, it should be noted that the rate of hospital admission in China was already higher than the average for OECD countries, while the rate of doctor consultations was lower than the average for OECD countries in 2016 ( China Health Statistical Yearbook, 2017 ; OECD, 2017 ). It implies that China needs to examine the appropriateness of inpatient care, including overuse and unnecessary utilization ( Meng et al., 2019a ).
A decreasing incidence of medical impoverishment and catastrophic health expenditure reflects China's achievements in financial protection. These achievements may be partly due to the expansion of social health insurance coverage, increasingly generous inpatient reimbursements, and the establishment of the critical illness insurance program. Several existing studies have confirmed the role of social health insurance in alleviating the problem of medical impoverishment and catastrophic health expenditure ( Guo et al., 2016 ; Jiang et al., 2019 ; Li et al., 2012 ; Zhang et al., 2018b ). In addition, the reduction in catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment may be attributable to the large anti-poverty program in China. As an important part of this program, local governments are required to provide healthcare services for people in poverty at almost no cost ( Central Committee of the Communist Party and State Council, 2015 ).
Our analysis also reveals room for improvements in several aspects of the healthcare reform. First, the incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment in China remain high compared to other nations ( Pandey et al., 2018 ; Wagstaff et al., 2018a , 2018b ). The gap between China and developed countries indicates a large margin for improvements. Moreover, a high degree of inequity in financial protection between rural and urban residents still exists; the poorest quartile is the most vulnerable group . All these facts imply that the government should continue to devote efforts and resources to providing better financial protection for all Chinese population, especially for the poor groups.
Second, the fact that people increasingly prefer hospitals to primary care institutions may pose a critical challenge in near future. China's public hospitals are already overcrowded and long waiting time is the main source of dissatisfaction ( Sun et al., 2017 ). More crucially, a hospital-centered delivery system would lower system efficiency and cause rapid growth of healthcare expenditure ( Eggleston et al., 2008 ; Yip and Hsiao, 2014 ). By contrast, primary health care (PHC) is supposed to be more effective in chronic disease control and cost containment. The establishment of a PHC-centered delivery system has become an exhortation of developed countries and international organizations ( Yip and Hsiao, 2014 ).
Our findings imply that China's recent attempts to redirect patients to primary care institutions have generated limited impact. The Chinese government has already realized the necessity of reestablishing a PHC-based integrated delivery system; in recent years, the central government has promulgated a set of policies to construct a tiered healthcare delivery system through encouraging medical alliances, contracting with family doctors, and differentiating reimbursement rates between tertiary hospitals and primary care facilities. But limited effectiveness suggests that the Chinese government should modify current policy and explore new ways to realize a PHC-based system.
Lastly, Chinese people's satisfaction towards the health system has not increased with improvements in access and financial protection. It implies that people's rising expectations towards better health services may outpace the achievements of health care reform . Moreover, the fact that the wealthier group of the population is less satisfied with the health system suggests that people are putting more emphasis on aspects of health services other than access and financial protection. As improving satisfaction is a key goal of China's health system reform, further research is in need to decompose factors that affect satisfaction; this would contribute to better informed policy design in the future.
This study has three limitations. First, results in this study may be interpreted as a reflection of the overall impact of all reform measures as well as social developments during the period from 2010 to 2016. We cannot isolate independent effects of any specific policy throughout the past few years. Second, due to limited data availability, we are unable to examine trends between 2016 and 2018. During this period, the Chinese government issued a number of notable reform policies. Third, despite its substantial achievements, we are unclear whether China's health reform has realized its full potential. A more comprehensive research design and alternative methods are needed to answer this question. These are important issues to be addressed in future research.
Despite these limitations, our findings have important policy implications for China and other countries undergoing demographic and economic transitions. China has undoubtedly achieved unprecedented results under a tight schedule, suggesting the ongoing health system reform in China is moving in the right direction. These achievements are the results of the government's strong political will and massive fiscal inputs. China's experience also tells us that improvements in access and financial protection do not guarantee a corresponding increase in satisfaction. This fact implies that the health system need to increase its responsiveness and the government's reform policies should evolve with changing priorities.
