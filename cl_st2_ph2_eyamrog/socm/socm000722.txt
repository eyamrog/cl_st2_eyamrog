Title: Theoretical mediators of GlobalConsent: An adapted web-based sexual violence prevention program for university men in Vietnam


Abstract: Abstract

Sexual violence remains a global problem that disproportionately affects women. Though sexual violence interventions exist, few have been implemented in low- or middle-income countries, and none in Vietnam for young men. We adapted a sexual violence prevention intervention (RealConsent) developed for college men in the U.S. and conducted a randomized controlled trial of the adapted intervention (GlobalConsent) with college men in Vietnam. We assessed the effects of GlobalConsent on sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior, directly and through theoretically targeted mediators. The study design entailed a double-blind, parallel intervention-control-group design in two universities. Consenting heterosexual or bisexual men 18–24 years starting university in September 2019 (n = 793) completed a baseline survey and were assigned with 1:1 randomization to GlobalConsent or attention control. Both programs were web-based and lasted 12 weeks. Path analysis was performed to study the mediating effects of cognition/knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, affect, and efficacy/intention variables measured at six months on sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior measured at 12 months. In parallel multiple-mediator models, initiating GlobalConsent lowered the odds of sexually violent behavior mainly indirectly, via knowledge of sexual violence legality and harm and victim empathy and increased the odds of prosocial bystander behavior directly and indirectly, through knowledge of sexual violence legality and harm and bystander capacities. The efficacious direct and indirect effects of GlobalConsent support the cross-cultural applicability of its underlying theory of change and findings from mediation analyses of its sister program RealConsent, suggesting GlobalConsent's national scalability and adaptability across Southeast Asia.

Section: 1. Introduction

Sexual violence persists worldwide and disproportionately occurs by men ( Wright et al., 2020 ) against women, who account for 91% of victims in some settings ( Rennison, 2002 ). Defined as sexual activity when consent is not obtained or freely given, sexual violence ranges from non-contact experiences, such as nonconsensual exposure to sexually explicit material, to completed forced penetration ( Basile et al., 2014 ). Sexual violence towards women begins at a young age, with 14.9% of women globally and 13.8% in the Asia/Pacific region having a forced sexual debut ( Decker et al., 2015 ). In Vietnam, 9.1% of women 15–19 years old and 18.0% of women 20–24 years old report experiencing sexual violence by an intimate partner or a non-partner since age 15 ( Ministry of Labor Invalids and Social Affaris (MOLISA) et al., 2020 ). Experiences of sexual violence can have lasting effects on the well-being of victims, and profound economic effects on victims and societies ( Amar and Gennaro, 2005 ; Gonzalez et al., 2018 ; Miller, 1996 ).
In Vietnam, legal reforms to reduce sexual violence are on-going. The Penal Code (2015), (2017) widened the definition of rape to include “other sexual activities” and added an article on employment of a person under 16 for pornographic purposes. The Supreme Court issued Resolution 06/2019/NQ-HDTP (2019) to guide interpretation of terms in the Penal Code, such the promise of material or non-material benefits as a form of coercion; sexually sensitive organs and other body parts used for sexual acts; sexual intention ; sexual devices used for sexual activities; and sexual intercourse generally and with children, by age. Sexual acts also are defined for persons in same-sex or opposite-sex relationships, for acts done directly or indirectly through clothing into genitals or body parts, and other sexual acts not aimed at sexual intercourse. The defenseless state of victims is clarified as the inability to exercise cognitive or behavioral control due to drugs or alcohol or the victim's material or professional dependence on the offender. Regarding sanctions for rape, sexual abuse, and sexual harassment, the Penal Code and the Resolution rely on time-sensitive physical evidence, such as vaginal examination and semen detection. Because the Law on Judicial Assessment (2012) does not require timely solicitation of a forensic examination, the Ministry of Health issued Decision 3133/2020/QD-BYT (July 2020) to guide health professionals on caring for victims of sexual violence and on examining, documenting, and reporting on the case to serve an investigation process.
Despite legal reforms, sexual violence victimization persists, and inequitable sexual and gender norms alongside increasing sexual activity among young people may be drivers ( Bergendfeld et al., 2020 ; Bergenfeld et al., 2021 ; Lewis et al., 2021 ). In qualitative interviews, men in Vietnam have excused or denied acts of sexual violence ([ James-Hawkins et al., 2019 ), such that only 0.2% of men have reported sexually violent behavior, while 12% of women have reported exposure ([ Yount et al., 2016 ). This discrepancy highlights a need to engage men in interventions that address broader sexual and gender norms as well as individual-level cognitive, attitudinal, and affective mediators ( Salazar et al., 2014 ; Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ). Such efforts may reduce sexually violent behavior, while increasing gender-specific bystander behavior by those who witness sexual violence ( Amar and Gennaro, 2005 ). Treating men as “allies” to prevent sexual violence ( Deitz et al., 1982 ) may attenuate the barriers to engaging young men in prevention efforts ( Payne et al., 1999 ; Rich et al., 2010 ) while promoting attitudinal and behavioral change ( Amar et al., 2015 ; Berkowitz, 2002 ).
Research, however, is limited on interventions to prevent sexual violence in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) ( Newlands & O'Donohue, 2016 ), especially among adolescent boys and young men ([ Yount et al., 2017 ). A review of sexual violence prevention programs in North America identified more reliance on single-session (75%), in-person (68%) and discussion-based (54%) delivery methods, and less reliance on online delivery (11%) of programming tailored to men (27%) ( Mujal et al., 2021 ). Prevention interventions targeting intimate-partner, dating, and sexual violence ( Graham et al., 2019 ) have been evaluated in randomized trials ( Graham et al., 2019 ; Mujal et al., 2021 ), but evidence is mixed ( Anderson et al., 2021 ; Graham et al., 2019 ; Pérez-Martínez et al., 2021 ) and predominantly from US-college students ( Graham et al., 2019 ; Mujal et al., 2021 ; Pérez-Martínez et al., 2021 ). Intervention studies have suffered from small sample sizes, high attrition, short follow-up periods (of six months or less), a focus on victim response rather than preventing violent behavior ( Anderson et al., 2021 ), and heterogeneity in outcome measurement ( Graham et al., 2019 ) including an infrequent focus on behavioral outcomes ( Mujal et al., 2021 ). Thus, rigorous studies of theoretically grounded interventions tailored to prevent sexually violent behavior among men in LMICs using web-based technologies and remote delivery are rare ([ Yount et al., 2017 ).
We targeted this high-needed area by designing and testing the capacity for GlobalConsent ( Yount et al., 2020 ; [ Yount et al., 2021 ) to increase prosocial bystander behavior and to decrease sexually violent behavior among men starting university in Vietnam. The development of GlobalConsent was guided by an integrated theory of change, drawing on social cognitive theory ( Bandura, 2004 ), social norms theory ( Fabiano et al., 2003 ), and the bystander education model ( Banyard et al., 2007 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Social cognitive theory posits that socio-contextual factors, personal factors, and behavior influence each other in a dynamic known as reciprocal determinism. Social norms are socio-contextual factors that may promote sexually violent behavior through men's perceptions or misperceptions of socially expected behavior. These expectations may be communicated through the media, family, peers, or other social networks. Personal factors, including thoughts, knowledge, attitudes, affect, and biological events, may counteract or reinforce perceived or misperceived social norms. For example, a young man with more knowledge about sexual violence may be able to counter perceived messaging of sexual violence as “normal; ” whereas, a young man with less knowledge about sexual violence may be unable to counter such messaging. Finally, sexually violent behavior is a manifestation and perpetuation of perceived or misperceived social norms about sexual violence, such as enforcement of socially-perpetuated power dynamics by physical subjugation of women; whereas, prosocial bystander behavior displays the act of intervening as “normal” and sexually violent behavior as “abnormal.” Thus, one man's behaviors can reinforce, counter, or modify social norms about sexual violence, and in turn, the behaviors of peer witnesses. The nature of and interactions between socio-contextual factors, personal factors, and sexually violent behavior may vary across societies and cultures, but the interplay of these factors is thought to be widespread ( Bandura, 2001 ).

SV = sexual violence; SVB = sexually violent behavior; Adapted with permission from Yount et al. (2020).
The aim of GlobalConsent was to disrupt the reinforcing interplay between (1) pro-violence socio-contextual factors including perceived or misperceived social norms that sexually violent behavior is normal, (2) pro-violence personal cognitions, attitudes, and affect, and (3) weak social norms of bystander behavior. By disrupting this interplay, GlobalConsent had the goals of reducing sexually violent behavior and increasing prosocial bystander behavior among university men in Vietnam.
The parent study had two objectives: (1) to adapt RealConsent, a theoretically grounded, web-based sexual violence prevention program ( Salazar et al., 2014 , 2019 ) to be suitable for university men in Vietnam, and (2) to test the impact of the adapted program, GlobalConsent, in this setting. The study protocol ( Yount et al., 2020 ) and behavioral impact assessment ( Yount et al., 2021 ) are presented elsewhere. The present analysis aimed to assess the direct and mediated effects of GlobalConsent on sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior. We expected that GlobalConsent would reduce sexually violent behavior and increase prosocial bystander behavior directly , because of its cumulative content and array of contextualized behavioral change techniques. We also expected that GlobalConsent would affect these behaviors indirectly , through theorized knowledge/cognitive, belief/attitudinal, affective, and capacity-related mediators ( Yount et al., 2020 ).

Section: 2. Methods

Given similarities with US-based universities, universities in Vietnam were suitable contexts to adapt RealConsent. Students in Vietnam enroll for 4–6 years, including two foundational years and the remaining years for specialization. Typically, universities design their curricular and extra-curricular activities and maintain networks with other universities through government ministries, professional associations, and the Youth Union, all pathways for national scale-up of evidence-based programs like GlobalConsent ( Yount et al., 2020 ). We enrolled participants at two universities in Hanoi: a 120-year-old state school, at which approximately 1000 students annually receive training in the health professions, and a 30-year-old private university, where approximately 7000 students annually receive training in diverse disciplines ( Yount et al., 2020 ). Both universities agreed in writing to participate in this study.
The study design—a double-blind, parallel control group design with 1:1 randomization to intervention or attention control—is described elsewhere ( Yount et al., 2020 ). Data were collected following ethical guidance for conducting research on gender-based violence ( Yount et al., 2021 ). The Institutional Review Boards of [BLINDED] (IRB00099860) and [BLINDED] (017–384/DD-YTCC) approved the study.
Eligible participants were heterosexual or bisexual men 18–24 years and joining the study universities in September 2019. We defined eligibility in this way to develop tailored programming for men who are attracted to women and at highest risk of engaging in sexually violent behavior against women. At University 1, five of nine departments with at least 15 male students were included. At University 2, 13 of 22 departments with at least 20 male students were included. All first-year male students of included departments were invited to attend an orientation to GlobalConsent (n = 1017) ( Yount et al., 2021 ). Of men invited to the orientation, 205 did not attend, seven who attended declined to participate, and 12 were ineligible, such that 793 eligible, consenting men were enrolled in the study.
Each of the 793 participants was assigned a random number. After sorting these numbers in ascending order (from 0 to 793), the first 397 were assigned to the attention-control group (“AHEAD”), and the remaining 396 were assigned to GlobalConsent ( Yount et al., 2020 ). Participants were blinded to their assignment through the use of a customized, web-based health-education attention-control program of equal length to GlobalConsent, and the study team was blinded throughout data analysis. Participants had access to their assigned learning program from November 2019 through January 2020. Four participants in the GlobalConsent group and two in the AHEAD group actively declined to login to their assigned learning program and were dropped from the study retrospectively ( Yount et al., 2021 ).
GlobalConsent was adapted from RealConsent, an evidence-based, web-delivered intervention tested among university men in the U.S. ( Salazar et al., 2014 , 2019 ). Programmatic features of RealConsent included content tailored to young men ( Brecklin & Forde ; Gibbons and Evans, 2013 ; Lewis and Neighbors, 2007 ; Vladutiu et al., 2010 ) that resonated with the viewer ( Ritterband et al., 2009 ) and multiple behavioral-change techniques ( Webb et al., 2010 ). Techniques included instruction on obtaining effective consent for sex and intervening safely in identified situations of sexual violence, modeling communication, and showing positive feedback and outcomes for getting consent and/or intervening in situations of non-consent, plus negative feedback and outcomes for perpetrating violence and/or not intervening in situations of violence ( Abraham and Michie, 2008 ). Content was delivered using didactic instruction with integrated audio, video, and infographics; problem-based learning with interactivity and reinforced practice; short videos or animations to model behavior; and educational entertainment or ‘edutainment,’ starting and ending each module with a brief episode of a serial drama ( Hurling et al., 2006 ; Salazar et al., 2014 ).
RealConsent aimed to change prosocial intervening behaviors and sexually violent behavior toward women via 12 cognitive, attitudinal, and affective mediators, including legal knowledge of assault/rape, knowledge of effective consent for sex, rape-myth acceptance, gender-role ideology, rape-victim empathy, and intention and self-efficacy to intervene ( Salazar et al., 2019 ). Results from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with undergraduate men 18–24 years attending a large, public, urban university in the Southeastern U.S. supported the efficacy of RealConsent ( Salazar et al., 2014 ). At six-months post-intervention, compared to the control group, the RealConsent group intervened more often and engaged in less sexual violence ( Salazar et al., 2014 ). In multiple-mediator models, RealConsent had direct effects on both behavioral outcomes, indirect effects on sexually violent behavior through legal knowledge of assault/rape, hostility toward women, and date-rape attitudes, and indirect effects on prosocial intervening behavior through intentions to intervene ( Salazar et al., 2019 ). The trial experienced a high loss to follow-up in the intervention (67%) and control (75%) arms, so trial results should be interpreted with caution.
Our team followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's five-step process ( McKleroy et al., 2006 ) to adapt RealConsent for university men in Vietnam. Step 1 involved assessing the target population, the evidence-based intervention (EBI) being considered for adaptation, and the implementing agency's capacity to deploy the intervention. Step 2 involved selecting the EBI for adaptation. Step 3 involved adapting the EBI, as needed, while retaining core elements. Step 4 entailed piloting the adapted intervention and developing a plan for implementation. The study team conducted qualitative research to implement Steps 1–4 ( Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ), and findings are presented elsewhere ( Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ; Yount et al., 2021 ; Bergenfeld et al., 2021 ). For Step 5, implement , we undertook an RCT to test the impact of GlobalConsent versus AHEAD on mitigating increases in sexually violent behavior that may occur when men matriculate into university and increasing prosocial bystander behavior ( Yount et al., 2020 ; [ Yount et al., 2021 ).
GlobalConsent includes six 30-min modules ( Yount et al., 2020 ; [ Yount et al., 2021 ). Each module involves didactic activities, interactivity, and episodes of a locally-produced serial drama that models positive behaviors, such as intervening and communicating effectively with female peers. Adaptations followed a systematic process ( McKleroy et al., 2006 ), the latest science on sexual violence, and formative qualitative research. Adaptations involved expanding the definition of sexual violence to include non-contact sexual coercion and cyber-violence ( Bergenfeld et al., 2021 ), contextualizing discussions of national laws on sexual violence, expanding and contextualizing discussions of masculinity norms, femininity norms, and rape myths ( Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ; Bergenfeld et al., 2021 ; Lewis et al., 2021 ), adapting the script for local acceptability, for example, by removing language deemed offensive, expanding the character development of men's female partners ([BLINDED], 2021), and developing all characters of the video segments and serial drama to resonate locally. Other adaptations included removing poorly understood segments and replacing them with clear learning objectives and takeaway messages. Given near-universal use of smartphones among university students in Vietnam, the team developed a platform to deliver GlobalConsent to mobile devices and computers.
Participants received a link to the web-based program and worked at their own pace, without skipping segments. Participants were reminded by text message and email to complete all modules in 12 weeks and were invited to give feedback on each module to assess the extent of completion. At the nine-month post-treatment follow-up, men who initiated GlobalConsent reported 0.71 times the odds of any sexually violent behavior (95%CI 0.50–1.00), 0.47 times the odds of more than two sexually violent acts (95%CI 0.31–0.72), and 1.51 times the odds of any prosocial bystander behavior (95%CI 1.00–2.28) than men who initiated the attention-control program ([BLINDED], 2021).
Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 depict the pathways by which GlobalConsent was expected to affect sexually violent behavior ( Fig. 2 ) and prosocial bystander behavior ( Fig. 3 ). GlobalConsent was hypothesized to work holistically as a single program, insofar as learning in each module extended learning from prior modules to affect the mediators. Theoretical mediators were grouped into cognitions/knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, affect, and capacity domains. All cognitions/knowledge mediators and rape empathy were hypothesized to affect both behavioral outcomes ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 ). In the attitudes/beliefs domain, all mediators were hypothesized to reduce sexually violent behavior, and specific mediators related to gender roles and rape myths were hypothesized to increase prosocial bystander behavior. In the capacities domain, sexual communication efficacy was expected to reduce sexually violent behavior, and mediators related to bystander intervention skills were hypothesized to increase prosocial bystander behavior.

Fieldwork is detailed elsewhere ( Yount et al., 2020 ). All 793 participants completed a baseline, tablet-assisted self-administered interview in September 2019 and were compensated 100000 VND (about 4.00 USD) upon completion. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, post-tests were self-administered remotely via the web. Post-test one was conducted in April–May 2020, three months after closing access to the intervention and six months after baseline data collection. Post-test two was conducted in October–November 2020, nine months after closing access to the intervention and 12 months after baseline. Participants were compensated 150000 VND (about 6.00 USD) for each follow-up survey. All surveys were administered using REDCap, a customizable web-based data system that enables the secure collection, transfer, and storage of study data ( Harris et al., 2009 ). In the GlobalConsent group, 374 (94.4%) and 364 (91.9%) of 396 participants completed post-test one and post-test two, respectively. In the AHEAD group, 377 (95.0%) and 375 (94.5%) of 397 participants completed each post-test. Nine participants were dropped (three GlobalConsent; six AHEAD) because they completed post-test two but not post-test one, resulting in a final analytic sample of 730 men. Overall, study completion exceeded 91.0% in each group.
The characteristics of participants across groups were similar at baseline and follow-up ( Yount et al., 2021 ). At baseline, participants were 18 years old, on average. The majority were attending University 2 (56.5%), majoring in non-health fields (53.9%), of Kinh ethnicity (95.8%), heterosexual (95.7%), non-religious (83.0%), and had never been in a dating or sexual relationship (53.9%). Almost half (45.2%) were living with parents or relatives. High percentages of participants in the GlobalConsent and AHEAD groups, respectively, logged into the program (94.9%, 97.7%), completed at least one module (91.4%, 94.4%), and completed all modules (88.9%, 91.2%).
Primary Outcomes. The primary outcomes were sexually violent behavior , measured using the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) ( Koss and Oros, 1982 ), and prosocial bystander behavior , measured using four items from an adapted Bystander Behavior Scale ( Banyard et al., 2007 ; Burn, 2009 ) ( Table 1 ). The SES asks about the perpetration of seven acts of contact sexual violence, ranging from unwanted touching to forced penetration, using any of five tactics, such as holding someone down or threatening to end the relationship, for a total of 35 items. The SES also asks about the perpetration of 10 acts of non-contact sexual violence, such as masturbating in front of someone without their consent. Sexually violent behavior captured the reported frequency (never, once, twice, three or more times) of all 45 items in the prior six months. Prosocial bystander behavior captured the reported frequency (never, one time, two or more times) in the prior 12 months of four acts: “I have talked with someone about sexual or dating violence as an issue for our university,” “I have encouraged others to learn more and get involved in preventing sexual or dating violence,” “I have talked with someone about sexually violent behaviors and warning signs,” and “I have told guys not to talk about women in sexually degrading ways.” Missingness was rare (0.13%–0.68% across all items), and these responses were recoded as 0, ‘not reported.’ For each behavioral outcome, we created dichotomous variables reflecting one or more instances of the behavior versus none.

Mediators . Table 1 also presents mediators organized into cognition/knowledge, beliefs/attitudes, affect, and capacity-related domains to align with GlobalConsent's underlying theory of change ( Figs. 2 and 3 ). The research team selected validated scales, where available, to measure competencies targeted in specific program modules and cumulatively reinforced throughout the program. The following mediators were included in models for sexually violent behavior ( Fig. 2 ): knowledge of sexual violence legality and harm; knowledge of active consent; knowledge of alcohol's effects on cognition, memory and behavior; endorsement of more equitable gender-role attitudes; rejection of rape-myths, endorsement of effective sexual communication; empathy for rape victims; and sexual communication self-efficacy. For prosocial bystander behavior, we included the above mediators except the sexual communication variables and added mediators capturing perceived barriers to bystander intervention, bystander self-efficacy, and intention to intervene ( Fig. 3 ). Each measure was adapted, as needed, to the Vietnamese university context, translated into Vietnamese for cognitive testing, and back-translated into English to ensure the original meaning was preserved. After data collection, we anchored all response options at zero and recoded them to have the same valence, such that more favorable responses yielded higher scores. For example, a response of ‘strongly disagree’ to an item endorsing rape myths received the highest score; whereas a response of ‘strongly agree’ received the lowest score. All mediators were validated to ensure their suitability for this analysis ( Bergenfeld et al., 2022 ; Bergenfeld et al., ; available upon request).
Measurement Models. Since mediator scales were developed by the study team or adapted from scales validated in other contexts, we did not assume an a priori factor structure. Thus, we randomly split the full sample and performed exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA/CFA) on each half, respectively, using mean and variance adjusted weighted least squares estimation ( Muthén and Muthén, 2017 ). We considered theoretical coherence, parsimony, and model fit when selecting a final scale, applying the following standards for adequate fit ( Hu and Bentler, 1995 ): Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) ≤0.08 and Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) ≥0.95. All models incorporated clustering by university. Table 1 presents factor-loading ranges and CFIs for each CFA model.
Descriptive Analyses . Detailed characteristics of the sample, overall and by trial arm, are presented elsewhere ( Yount et al., 2021 ). After finalizing latent measurement models for each mediator in MPlus, we derived and extracted factor scores for each participant at baseline and posttest 1. We calculated factor-score means and standard deviations to assess qualitatively the balance of baseline mediator factor scores across arms ( Supplemental material ).
Single-Mediator and Multiple-Mediator Path Analysis . We used path analysis to assess the indirect effect of trial arm on sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior (measured at posttest 2) through each mediator factor score (measured at posttest 1). Path analysis with observed variables, which treats mediator factor scores derived from separate measurement models as observed variables in path analysis ( Lu et al., 2011 ), is an alternative to latent-variable structural equation modeling that conserves power, especially in more complex models exceeding 10–20 observations per parameter ( Devlieger and Rosseel, 2017 ; Kelcey, 2019 ). We used STATA's gsem feature to estimate direct path coefficients from trial arm to each mediator (a), from mediator to each outcome (b), and from trial arm to outcome (c’) ( Fig. 4 ). First, we estimated single-mediator models to assess the indirect pathways (ab) of effect from trial arm to outcome via each mediator separately. Then, we estimated multiple-mediator models that included indirect pathways via all mediators simultaneously to assess the unique effect of each mediator. While we expected that mediators would be correlated, they could not influence each other causally as they were measured concurrently. We calculated bootstrapped, biased-corrected confidence intervals using 1000 iterations for all indirect effects. Download: Download high-res image (227KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 4 .

In single-mediator models of sexually violent behavior ( Table 2 , Panel 1), the direct path (c’) from trial arm to sexually violent behavior was non-significant (coefficient c’). However, initiating GlobalConsent had significant indirect effects on decreasing sexually violent behavior through all four knowledge mediators, including sexual violence legality and harm (ab OR = 0.88), active consent myths and practices (ab ORs = 0.91 and 0.92, respectively), and alcohol's effects (ab OR = 0.95). Initiating GlobalConsent also had significant indirect effects on decreasing violent behavior through two attitudinal mediators capturing victim-related rape myths (ab OR = 0.83) and non-verbal sexual communication (ab OR = 0.87). Thus, in single-mediator models, all significant indirect effects of GlobalConsent through knowledge and attitudinal mediators were in the expected direction of decreasing sexually violent behavior.

In single-mediator models of prosocial bystander behavior ( Table 2 , Panel 2), initiating GlobalConsent had a significant, positive direct effect (coefficient c’), corresponding to a 43%–60% increase in the odds of prosocial bystander behavior (exp(0.36) to exp(0.47)). Initiating GlobalConsent also had significant, positive indirect effects on bystander behavior through knowledge of active consent myths (ab OR = 1.10), knowledge of alcohol's effects (ab OR = 1.03), bystander self-efficacy (ab OR = 1.06), and bystander action-oriented intention to intervene (ab OR = 1.09). Thus, in single-mediator models, all significant direct and indirect effects of GlobalConsent were in the expected direction of increasing prosocial bystander behavior.
In parallel multiple-mediator models of sexually violent behavior ( Table 3 , Panel 1), knowledge of sexual violence legality and harm (ab OR = 0.93) and empathy for rape victims (ab OR = 0.96) remained significant mediators of initiating GlobalConsent and reduced sexually violent behavior. As expected, initiating GlobalConsent increased knowledge of alcohol's effects (coefficient a = 0.12); however, increased knowledge was associated with increased reporting of sexually violent behavior (coefficient b = 0.44), such that the significant indirect effect through this pathway was unexpectedly positive (ab OR = 1.05). In parallel multiple-mediator models of prosocial bystander behavior ( Table 3 , Panel 2), the direct positive effect of initiating GlobalConsent remained significant (coefficient c’ = 0.36; OR 1.43). Positive indirect effects of initiating GlobalConsent on bystander behavior through bystander self-efficacy (ab OR = 1.04) and action-oriented intention to intervene (ab OR = 1.07) were attenuated but remained significant and in the expected directions. A negative indirect effect of initiating GlobalConsent on prosocial bystander behavior through knowledge of sexual violence legality unexpectedly emerged as significant (ab OR = 0.95). Table 3 .

Section: 4. Discussion

At two universities in Hanoi, men who initiated GlobalConsent had lower odds of sexually violent behavior mainly as a result of the program's favorable indirect effects through men's knowledge of sexual violence legality and harm and empathy for rape victims. By contrast, the positive effect of initiating GlobalConsent on men's prosocial bystander behavior operated directly, as a result of men's holistic exposure to the program, and indirectly, through the program's favorable effects on increasing bystander self-efficacy and action-related intention to intervene.
These findings align with Social Cognitive Theory ( Bandura, 2001 , 2004 ) and support the cross-cultural applicability GlobalConsent's theory of change, wherein socio-contextual factors (embedded in the program), personal factors, and behavior are inter-related ( Fig. 1 ). Specifically, findings suggest that contextualized norm-shifting video segments modeling behavior, alongside contextualized didactic and interactive behavioral-change techniques throughout GlobalConsent, can modify the viewer's behavior directly, and indirectly through changes in personal cognitions, affect, and self-efficacy. Attenuation of mediation effects between single-mediator and multiple-mediator models suggests that some mediators were correlated. We used linear probability models to perform collinearity diagnostics, and the average variance inflation factors (VIF) for the mediator variables were 1.67 for sexually violent behavior and 1.72 for prosocial bystander behavior, below the threshold of 10 for concern. Still, correlated mediators may explain the unexpected, positive indirect effect of program initiation on sexually violent behavior through knowledge of alcohol's effects in the multiple-mediator model, when this indirect effect was negative in the single-mediator model. This positive indirect effect may reflect co-occurring changes in adherence to alcohol-related rape myths and knowledge of alcohol's effects. In this case, reporting sexually violent behavior may increase as personal adherence to alcohol-related rape myths declines and knowledge of alcohol's effects increases. Literature in the US ( McMahon and Farmer, 2011 ) and Vietnam ( Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ) supports this interpretation and suggests that discounting men's sexually violent behavior under the influence of alcohol is a salient rape myth among university men in both settings.
On the other hand, knowledge of legality and harm related to sexual violence was negatively related to prosocial bystander behavior in single- and multiple-mediator models. This finding may suggest that increased knowledge of the illegality of sexually violent behaviors is related to awareness of the consequences for peers of prosocial bystander behavior. This potential response of bystander men aligns with the rape myths that men do not mean to be sexually violent and that men's behavior is not really rape ( Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ; Payne et al., 1999 ). Overall, these findings suggest that GlobalConsent influences behavior through targeted module-specific competencies but especially through cumulative exposure to the program as a whole. Because program completion was high, we could not assess associations between the number of modules completed and behavioral outcomes, so further research should test this interpretation.
Our findings also align generally with a similar mediation analysis of the behavioral effects of RealConsent ( Salazar et al., 2019 ), the program from which GlobalConsent was adapted. While RealConsent affected sexually violent behavior directly (as a holistic program), GlobalConsent and RealConsent affected sexually violent behavior indirectly, through knowledge and attitudinal mediators ( Salazar et al., 2019 ). Also, GlobalConsent and RealConsent affected prosocial bystander behavior directly and indirectly, through capacity-related mediators. The specific indirect pathways of effect differed between the two programs, but these differences were partly a result of a priori adaptations to measured mediators for suitability to Vietnam. Broad similarities of the findings underscore the cross-cultural strength of the underlying theory of change, which integrates social cognitive theory, social norms theory, and the bystander intervention model ( Salazar et al., 2019 , Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 ).
Other findings from the parent study in Vietnam also support the findings here on rape myths, knowledge of sexual violence harm, and knowledge of active consent as factors influencing sexually violent behavior. In qualitative research with college men and women, common rape myths related to beliefs that women were culpable for their own sexual violence victimization and that few scenarios constituted rape ( Bergenfeld et al., 2020 ). Moreover, many young men are socialized to ignore women's non-consent ( Bergenfeld et al, 2021 ), and sexual coercion often is normalized in dating relationships among young people ( Lewis et al., 2021 ). The findings presented here corroborate that targeting these cognitive and attitudinal pathways is an effective way to reduce sexually violent behavior among university men. Many of the same cognitive and attitudinal mediators have been targeted in trials aimed at increasing prosocial bystander behavior in college populations elsewhere ( Banyard et al., 2007 ).
Some study limitations are noteworthy. First, the study sites were two universities in Hanoi, limiting inferences to similar male students at these universities. However, the inclusion of one public and one private university provided access to a diverse population of students from across Vietnam who were pursuing diverse areas of study. Second, self-reported behavioral outcomes may be subject to recall and social desirability bias . Still, validated instruments were employed in a self-administered interview to increase the validity and privacy of reporting and to enhance honest disclosure . Third, after factor analysis, the perpetrator-focused rape-myths factor contained only three items and may have lacked content validity, evidenced by its negative correlation with other mediators. Fourth, this analysis was conducted using an intent-to-treat model, in which exposure was measured as assignment to and initiation of GlobalConsent or AHEAD, regardless of completion. While most participants completed all modules, approximately 10% of participants received a lower intervention “dose.” Inclusion of these men in the GlobalConsent group for analysis would bias the effect size towards the null; however, this group was too small for a dose-response analysis in the GlobalConsent group. Fifth, we also cannot determine module-specific effects of GlobalConsent due to the high completion rate of all modules. Because mediator-targeting content was in some cases module-specific, treating the program holistically in this analysis may have masked and attenuated module-specific mediation effects. Sixth, the intervention was self-paced over 12 weeks, such that the time between completing GlobalConsent and each regularly scheduled post-test could have varied across participants. More time between program completion and post-test assessments could attenuate program effects if program content was less well absorbed or retained among early program completers. Finally, follow-up data collection took place after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when social distancing measures were being implemented; therefore, reported rates of prosocial bystander behavior and sexually violent behavior may be lower-than-expected at follow-up in the entire sample. Still, our sample size was sufficiently powered to detect changes in sexually violent behavior and prosocial bystander behavior attributable to viewing GlobalConsent ( Yount et al., 2020 ).
Acknowledging these limitations, several strengths of this study and analysis advance knowledge on sexual violence prevention in LMICs. First, mediators were assessed using validated scales, or scales adapted and validated by the team for suitability to the local context. Second, the analysis examined the indirect and direct pathways by which initiating GlobalConsent was expected to affect each primary outcome. The significant direct effect of the full program especially on prosocial bystander behavior suggests that program modules may operate together to influence primary outcomes and that a subset of mediating pathways are salient. These findings are relevant for future implementers of GlobalConsent to ensure that core program elements are retained for comparable impact.
These findings have important implications for future research and practice. First, the involvement of more universities across Vietnam in effectiveness and implementation trials would offer insights about how GlobalConsent operates on primary and secondary outcomes across diverse geographic and socio-political contexts and under real-world (non-trial) conditions. Second, because men encounter sexual and gender norms and construct gender identity from an early age, researchers and practitioners should consider the acceptability, adaptation, testing, and possible scale-up of GlobalConsent with male high school students to maximize its positive impacts over the life course. Third, the adaptation and testing of GlobalConsent in other Southeast Asian countries is recommended to measure its wider efficacy and effectiveness, and to understand what adaptations may be needed for maximum scale-up and public-health benefit in the region. Finally, in parallel mediation models of prosocial bystander behavior, significant indirect effects persisted only for bystander-specific mediators, which were targeted in the final module of GlobalConsent. This finding suggests that the theory of change for bystander behavior may differ from that of sexually violent behavior, and modifications to the theory of change and associated programming may be useful to capture fully the mechanisms by which a modified GlobalConsent influences bystander behavior. Finally, GlobalConsent, as a web-based program delivered to mobile devices and computers, has substantial scalability and practical application in educational settings, especially as access to higher education and mobile devices expands globally. Given these rapid social changes and the ongoing context of COVID-19, GlobalConsent may be even more critical for widespread and sustainable efforts to prevent sexual violence against women.

Section: 5. Conclusion

GlobalConsent is an efficacious, web-based intervention for university men that reduces sexually violent behavior by increasing knowledge about sexual violence legality and harm and by increasing empathy for victims. GlobalConsent also improves bystander behavior directly and by increasing knowledge of sexual violence legality and harm and increased bystander capacity to intervene. As such, GlobalConsent has remarkable promise for national scale-up in Vietnam and adaptation to other Southeast Asian settings as an effective and sustainable strategy to prevent sexual violence against women, with cascading public health benefits.
