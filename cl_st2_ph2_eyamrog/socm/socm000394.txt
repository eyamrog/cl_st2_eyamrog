Title: Symbolic disempowerment and Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election: Mental health responses among Latinx and white populations


Abstract: Abstract

The 2016 election of United States (U.S.) President Donald Trump was a political event that may have affected population-level mental health. A prominent theme in the Trump election was anti-immigrant policy that contributed to a racist and xenophobic sociopolitical climate. Applying a symbolic dis/empowerment framework, this study examines whether there was an effect of the Trump election on the mental health of the U.S. population that differed by race/ethnicity, language of interview, and state-level support for Trump or Clinton. We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2011–2018 to examine trends in poor mental health days in the five months after the U.S Presidential election (November 2016 to March 2017) compared to all other survey months. We conducted difference-in-differences analyses using negative binomial regression models to examine the effect of the five post-election months on the rate of poor mental health days, comparing six population categories: 1) non-Latinx white populations in Trump states, 2) non-Latinx white populations in Clinton states, 3) English-speaking Latinx populations in Trump states, 4) English-speaking Latinx populations in Clinton states, 5) Spanish-speaking Latinx populations in Trump states, and 6) Spanish-speaking Latinx populations in Clinton states. White populations in Clinton states reported more poor mental health days in response to the five months post-election period compared to white populations in Trump states. English-speaking Latinx people living in Trump states experienced higher than expected poor mental health days in November 2016 and February 2017. Spanish-speaking Latinx people, by contrast, reported fewer poor mental health days in the post-election period. The 2016 U.S. presidential election preceded population-level changes in mental health that support a symbolic dis/empowerment framework. We discuss possible explanations and the mental health implications for future major political events.

Section: 1. Introduction

In no other time in recent history has the United States (U.S.) been more divided by political rhetoric ( Fisher et al., 2012 ; Doherty, 2014 ; Westfall et al., 2015 ). Given that the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections brought stark political and social divisions into vivid relief, we were led to ask whether such high-stake presidential elections might have population-level effects on mental health ( Gemmill et al., 2019 ; Yan et al., 2021 ). And, with Donald Trump espousing what many perceived to be explicitly racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies in the 2016 election, how might his election have impacted the mental health of groups who are differentially situated with respect to race/ethnicity self-identification, immigration status, and state political environment ( Yan et al., 2021 ; Williams and Medlock, 2017 )? In this study, we examine the 2016 presidential election to understand how a racist and anti-immigrant sociopolitical context may have affected population mental health.
We define sociopolitical contexts as the perceptions of the social and political environment shared by a group of people, and we propose that they affect health through two main mechanisms ( Rodriguez, 2019 ; Bennett, 2010 ). First, such contexts facilitate the proposal, passage, and/or implementation of actual policies that powerfully influence the social determinants of health (i.e. social status, citizenship, education, income, etc.) which are in turn the main contributors to population health disparities ( Rodriguez, 2019 ; Brown et al., 2020 ; Phelan et al., 2010 ). Second, sociopolitical contexts—as perceived differently by groups of people—can empower or disempower members of those groups. This phenomenon is known as symbolic empowerment or symbolic disempowerment. Brown, Solazzo, and Gorman describe symbolic empowerment as the increased hope and optimism that is experienced when “members of an aggrieved group believe whatever injustice they face will soon be alleviated” ( Brown et al., 2020 ). Members of aggrieved groups experience symbolic empowerment when a sociopolitical context that offers the possibility of a redistribution of power that favors them seems plausible and attainable in their lives.
In their empirical examination of symbolic empowerment, Brown, Solazzo, and Gorman use the 2008 presidential election to demonstrate how Barack Obama's presidential win led to an improvement in mental health among Black men in the U.S. in the days immediately following the election. This provides evidence that Black men in the U.S. experienced symbolic empowerment as the result of the election of Barack Obama that marked a shift in the sociopolitical environment giving feelings of hope and representation among those identifying with what the election symbolized. Notably, the psychologically beneficial effect of symbolic empowerment due to an election is likely short-lived for historically aggrieved groups. For example, although the election of President Obama marked a meaningful moment in history in which Black and white people felt that his win symbolized the end of racism in the U.S. ( Esposito and Romano, 2014 ; Ikard and Teasley, 2012 ; Moore and Bell, 2010 ), the long arm of health disparities linked to continued discrimination experiences, widening wealth inequality, and unaddressed structural racism have remained durable over time ( Phelan and Link, 2015 ; Gee and Hicken, 2021 ; Gee et al., 2019 ).
The concept of symbolic empowerment also suggests that an election may be detrimental to the mental health of a population group if a particular outcome is perceived to negatively affect them. This possibility could be characterized as the opposite of symbolic empowerment: symbolic disempowerment ( Brown et al., 2020 ). The mental health of a subgroup may suffer if members believe that the election marks the beginning of a worsening of their situation. For example, if people believe that the elected president will promote, pass, and exacerbate anti-immigrant and racist policies—negatively shaping a sociopolitical climate that deems such aggrieved groups as disposable and powerless—they will experience symbolic disempowerment . Expanding upon the previously established definition of symbolic empowerment ( Brown et al., 2020 ), we define symbolic disempowerment as the fear and unhappiness that manifests for historically aggrieved groups when a sociopolitical context forbodes a proliferation or increase in injustice and the inequities those injustices produce.
Examples of symbolic disempowerment exist in the literature. Lauderdale and colleagues (2006) found the terrorist attacks of 9–11 caused worse birth outcomes among children born to women with Arab-sounding names in the months following but not in the months preceding the attack ( Lauderdale, 2006 ). The effect of the event was only found among babies born to women with Arab-sounding names, not among babies born to women of other racial/ethnic groups. This finding caused the authors to conclude that the mechanism linking 9–11 to poor birth outcomes was the increased stigma that Arab women experienced during pregnancy due to the anti-Arab sociopolitical environment created after 9–11. Similarly, researchers identified increased stress due to the sociopolitical environment as associated with poor birth outcomes for babies born to Latina women—immigrant as well as U.S.-born Latinas—who were pregnant at the time of the 2016 presidential election ( Gemmill et al., 2019 , 2020 ; Krieger et al., 2018 ). In the cases reviewed, there was a spillover effect of anti-immigrant stigma on health, as not only immigrants but non-immigrant people of color became stigmatized due to their perceived race/ethnicity. This indicates that an anti-immigrant sociopolitical context stigmatizes broad populations of color as “immigrant,” “foreign,” “not really American” and, therefore, less deserving ( Morey, 2018 ; García, 2017 ). Multiple scholars have pointed to the racialization of “illegality” to illustrate how U.S.-born Latina/o/x (hereafter referred to as Latinx) people are treated, perceived, and stigmatized as undocumented ( García, 2017 ; Menjívar, 2021 ). People who are closely connected to immigrants, including people from mixed-status families (i.e., those that consist of a mixture of persons with various immigration statuses), experience increased health-harming discrimination and stress in an anti-immigrant sociopolitical environment ( Morey, 2018 ; Vargas et al., 2017 ).
This theoretical background and existing evidence leads us to expect that symbolic disempowerment likely manifested during the 2016 election, as many perceived the event as contributing to a racist and xenophobic sociopolitical climate. This election differed from other elections in recent decades due to the prominent role that immigration policy and anti-immigrant rhetoric played in the months leading up to and following it ( Chavez et al., 2019 ). One of Trump's most prominent campaign promises was to build the biggest wall between the Mexico-U.S. border and make Mexico pay for it, sparking chants of “Build That Wall” among supporters at his rallies. Therefore, although he had yet to pass or implement any policies with regard to immigration, Donald Trump's election win in November 2016 was symbolic of a shift in the sociopolitical climate towards exacerbated racism and xenophobia, especially towards those perceived as originating from Mexico and Latin America, given his explicit verbal attacks against these groups ( Canizales and Vallejo, 2021 ).
Following his election, President Trump issued executive orders to further shape a racist and anti-immigrant sociopolitical climate. These executive orders provided funding for the border wall, denied entry of immigrants from majority-Muslim countries, and expanded the power of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to more quickly arrest and deport any undocumented immigrant, including beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program ( Kopan, 2017 ). Therapists and mental health professionals reported anecdotally that they saw a significant spike in the number of patients expressing anxiety and depression after the 2016 election of Donald Trump ( Anapol, 2018 ; Burnett-Zeigler, 2016 ). These reports lead us to suspect that Latinx populations in particular may have had a detrimental mental health response to the 2016 election, having experienced symbolic disempowerment in the anti-immigrant and racist sociopolitical environment created by the election of President Donald Trump. Although these policies and anti-immigrant rhetoric mainly targeted immigrant groups in the U.S.—who are most likely to experience harassment, surveillance, arrest, deportation, or denial of citizenship—these actions and words may have also stigmatized people of color (including U.S. citizens) who were assumed to be immigrant ( Morey, 2018 ; García, 2017 ). It is possible that the mental health of Latinx populations broadly may have been negatively affected by the anti-immigrant sociopolitical environment created by the election of Donald Trump. On the other hand, the response to the 2016 presidential election result could have varied by immigrant or nativity status, depending on the way different Latinx groups perceived or reacted to the sociopolitical environment.
By contrast, there are groups of people that may have experienced symbolic empowerment as a result of the 2016 presidential election, namely, non-Latinx white populations living in states where the majority voted for Donald Trump. Evidence shows that the 2008 election of President Barack Obama created anxiety and anger for some members of the white population, which Anderson has suggested fueled white resentment that led to the election of Donald Trump as president in 2016 ( Anderson, 2016 ; Anderson and Bolden, 2020 ). Therefore, if this population viewed Trump as a symbol of hope as a self-identified white person who represents them and would address their grievances, then this group would have experienced symbolic empowerment as a result of the November 2016 election. Previous research has examined the role of individuals’ personal political affiliations with their health and happiness following elections, in particular with regard to being affiliated with the losing political party ( Pierce et al., 2016 ; Rosman et al., 2021 ). However, our study differs in that it examines differences in responses to the sociopolitical environment by race/ethnicity due to the way that U.S. presidential politics tend to polarize people by the social constructs of race/ethnicity ( Abramowitz and McCoy, 2018 ). In addition, rather than examining personal political affiliation, we test whether state political environments make a difference in population mental health responses to the presidential election. If white populations living in states that voted for Trump experienced a boost in mental health following the November 2016 election, this would provide evidence that they experienced symbolic empowerment due to a sociopolitical environment that gave them increased optimism and hope that their lives would improve ( Lopez Bunyasi, 2019 ; Major et al., 2016 ).
The Latinx population response to the 2016 election may have varied by state political environment as well. State-level political environments reflect social environments where populations are more conservative or progressive in their perspective on issues such as immigration policy and race relations ( Grumbach, 2018 ; Huo et al., 2018 ). States may pass policies that align with presidential political stances, or they may pass policies intended to counter presidential politics ( Young et al., 2019 ; De Trinidad Young and Wallace, 2019 ). For example, in response to anti-immigrant national policies, some states enacted policies mandating law enforcement to cooperate with all requests from ICE, while other states passed sanctuary state laws to protect immigrant communities from law enforcement partnerships with ICE ( McHugh, 2018 ). Hatzenbuehler et al. (2017) found Latinxs living in states with more restrictive immigration policies have worse mental health ( Hatzenbuehler et al., 2017 ). With these considerations in mind, mental health responses to national politics may vary from state to state. A pro-Trump state political environment may further increase minority stress—marginalization due to prejudice and discrimination—for stigmatized groups such as Latinx communities. ( Meyer, 1995 ). On the other hand, a state political environment that is more progressive on issues of immigration (i.e., a pro-Clinton state political environment) may buffer against any sequelae caused by the election of an anti-immigrant president.
At this point, it is critical to point out that Latinx populations in the U.S. are not monolithic, rather they are extremely diverse. While most Latinx people have heritage from Spanish-speaking countries, some come from indigenous language-speaking communities throughout Mexico, Central America , South America, and the Caribbean. Many in the Latinx American community, especially Mexican Americans, felt threatened by Trump's rhetoric given his explicit language labeling immigrants from Mexico as criminals and placing blame on undocumented Mexican immigrants for societal ills ( Chavez et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, approximately 28% of Latinx voters voted for Trump in 2016, a number that is much higher than the 8% of Democrats who voted for Trump according to exit polls ( Sonneland and Fleischner, 2016 ). Segments of the Latinx population in the U.S. espouse politically and socially conservative views, siding with Trump on issues such as immigration ( Cadava, 2020 ; Damore and Decisions, 2016 ). In all, there is likely variation within Latinx American populations in their response to the presidential election that depends on their country of birth, immigration status, and acculturation level. Most population-based health datasets unfortunately do not include direct measures of nationality, immigration, or acculturation ( Morey et al., 2018 ). However, proxies such as language use are available and can be used to capture some elements of immigration factors in these health datasets.
This background motivates the current study, which seeks to examine whether and how the 2016 presidential election influenced population mental health in the U.S. Based on a symbolic dis/empowerment framework, we expected that there would be differences in the mental health response by race/ethnicity, with Latinx populations experiencing worsened mental health following the election due to symbolic disempowerment, as compared to white populations. Among Latinx and white respondents, we further expected differences in mental health by whether the majority of co-residents in the state voted for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election—a measure of the state political environment. In particular, white respondents in Trump states may have experienced symbolic empowerment following the election, which would be evidenced by a mental health protective effect. On the other hand, Latinx respondents in Trump states may have experienced exacerbated symbolic disempowerment due to the confluence of a perceived xenophobic and racist state and national sociopolitical environment. This would be demonstrated by worsened mental health among Latinx in Trump states compared to Latinx in Clinton states. Lastly, we examined among Latinx differences in mental health response by language of survey interview—whether they completed the survey in English or Spanish—which we use as a proxy indicator of acculturation to capture some of the diversity among Latinx populations.
Evidence of differences in mental health by these population characteristics would provide support for a symbolic dis/empowerment framework for understanding how presidential elections affect population mental health. As Rodriguez proposes, national politics shape social determinants of health (i.e., income, education, health care , etc.), and presidential politics can themselves be social determinants of health ( Rodriguez, 2018 , 2019 ).

Section: 2. Methods

We used data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a cross-sectional, telephone survey conducted monthly on representative samples from all U.S. states and territories . BRFSS is initiated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to inform public health policies . We restricted analysis to the 50 states. States follow similar protocols and report data to be representative of each state's population. BRFSS respondents are surveyed randomly and continuously. Therefore, we assume that unaccounted-for individual-level confounders are distributed randomly over time, since respondents have the same probability of being contacted at any time during the study period. The sample includes both landline and cellular telephone samples, stratified based on geographic regions within states. BRFSS includes design weighting and iterative proportional fitting (i.e., raking) weighting. Sample weights account for telephone ownership, education level , marital status, home ownership, age, sex, race, ethnicity, and region. We combined BRFSS data for the years 2011–2018 to create a panel of multiple cross-sectional samples. We used weights to account for the combination of data across multiple BRFSS years.
The dependent variable was the number of poor mental health days in the past 30 days. It was measured using the question, “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?” This measure has been widely used to examine trends in population-level mental health ( Slabaugh et al., 2016 ).
The primary exposure was the five-months following the election of Donald Trump to the presidency—November 2016 to March 2017—hereafter referred to as the “five-month post-election period.” Prior research uses similar time frames to evaluate mental health following a major stressful event ( Bor et al., 2018 ; North et al., 2012 ). We chose this time period due to the salience of the landmark election that was prefaced by extremely polarizing political tensions, with race rhetoric and immigration policies playing prominent roles. Furthermore, this time period includes the early months of Trump in office, during which time the president signed more executive orders in the first 100 days of office than his predecessors, including Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton ( Press Release - President, 2017 ). Between January and March 2017, Trump signed six executive orders directly related to immigration, all of which received widespread media coverage and sparked extensive controversy (see Appendix A for a list of these policies). Using the month of interview, we created a dichotomous variable to indicate whether or not respondents were interviewed at any time in the five-month post-election period. We also created five separate dichotomous variables to indicate whether respondents were interviewed in each of the five post-election months (i.e., interviewed in November 2016 or any other month, interviewed in December 2016 or any other month, etc.).
We were interested in population differences in response to the 2016 election by race/ethnicity, language of interview, and state political environment. We defined race/ethnicity comparing Latinx to non-Latinx white respondents, excluding all other racial/ethnic groups for this analysis. Among Latinx respondents, we compared those who responded to the survey in English to those who responded in Spanish. To measure the 2016 state political environment, we defined each state as having voted for Trump or Clinton, based on the presidential candidate who won the majority of the vote in the state. Individuals were coded as living in a state that voted for Trump or Clinton. In total, we created six population categories: 1) white populations in Trump states, 2) white populations in Clinton states, 3) English-speaking Latinx populations in Trump states, 4) English-speaking Latinx populations in Clinton states, 5) Spanish-speaking Latinx populations in Trump states, and 6) Spanish-speaking Latinx populations in Clinton states.
Control variables included age, gender, marital status, education, income, and employment. We included a variable for state to account for state-level fixed effects , which absorbs interstate differences in mental health and population characteristics . Additionally, to achieve even better control of potential confounding variables we included a time propensity variable created using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) methods that account for patterned confounders (i.e., month-to-month autocorrelation) and seasonality of mental health over time ( Catalano et al., 2007 ). We created these propensity values by modeling overall monthly mental health of the entire population over the 96 months of the study. Propensity values were fitted, conditional on time, then assigned back to each individual and used as a covariate. ARIMA values control for patterns such as trend and oscillations in poor mental health days that are not caused by, but may spuriously correlate with, the election time period ( Ayers et al., 2013 ) (see Appendix B for more details on ARIMA methods).
Only respondents with complete data on all variables were included in the final sample (n = 2,552,336). The sample included 1,397,765 white respondents in Trump states, 953,984 white respondents in Clinton states, 60,241 English-speaking Latinx respondents in Trump states, 77,671 English-speaking Latinx respondents in Clinton states, 27,231 Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents in Trump states, and 35,444 Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents in Clinton states.
First, we examined weighted descriptive statistics for the total sample and separately for the six population categories. Using line graphs, we visualized the monthly weighted and age-standardized mean number of poor mental health days in the past 30 days for the total U.S. population and separately for the six population categories from January 2011 to December 2018. Next, we conducted a difference-in-differences regression analysis to estimate whether the mental health effect of the five-month post-election period differed between the six population categories, accounting for covariates. We used negative binomial regression because the outcome was a count of the number of poor mental health days, and due to the over-dispersion of the count, we preferred negative binomial to Poisson regression. We report incidence rate ratios (IRRs), which can be interpreted as relative differences in the rate of monthly poor mental health days. Using postestimation commands, we examined differences in the effect of the five-month post-election period among the six population categories. Lastly, we calculated the predicted number of poor mental health days in each of the five post-election months separately for the six population categories, accounting for covariates. All regression models accounted for survey weights and included the control variables described above.
We conducted sensitivity checks to check whether our findings were robust to different specifications, including shortening the total analytic time frame and testing different post-election time periods (not shown, but available upon request).

Section: 3. Results

Table 1 shows that white respondents living in Clinton states were slightly older, more likely to be college educated, and more likely to have income over $50,000 than those living in Trump states. Overall, Latinx respondents were younger, more likely to be male, had lower educational attainment and income, and were less likely to be retired than white respondents. Compared to English-speaking Latinx respondents, Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents were older, more likely to be married, had lower education and income, and were more likely to not be working. From 2011 to 2018, the mean number of poor mental health days in the past 30 days for the total sample was 3.79, and this was slightly higher for the white population in Trump states (3.89) and slightly lower for the white population in Clinton states (3.62). Average poor mental health days were highest among the English-speaking Latinx population (4.13 in Trump states and 4.19 in Clinton states) and lowest among the Spanish-speaking Latinx population (3.27 in Trump and 3.26 in Clinton states). For the total sample, the average number of poor mental health days in the five months post-election was slightly higher than all other months, and this difference was more pronounced for the white population in Clinton states and the English-speaking Latinx population in Trump states. All other Latinx populations reported lower average number of poor mental health days in the five months post-election compared to all other months. Table 1 .

Fig. 1 shows monthly variations in average age-standardized poor mental health days from January 2011 to December 2018, with shaded areas representing the five-month post-election period. The monthly average number of poor mental health days for the total population trended slightly upwards from 2017 and thereafter ( Fig. 1 A). The white population in Clinton states had consistently fewer poor mental health days each month than did the white population in Trump states ( Fig. 1 B). December 2016 is one of the only months in which average poor mental health days among the white population in Clinton states exceeded that of the white population in Trump states. English-speaking Latinx populations in Trump states and Clinton states ( Fig. 1 C) followed similar trends in number of poor mental health days, with some exceptions. In the five-month post-election period, the English-speaking Latinx population living in Trump states experienced some of their highest levels of monthly poor mental health days. For the Spanish-speaking Latinx population, the average number of poor mental health days decreased over the entire time period ( Fig. 1 D). In the post-election period, the Spanish-speaking Latinx population in Trump states reported especially low numbers of poor mental health days.

The result of the negative binomial regression analysis in Table 2 shows the difference in the rate of poor mental health days between the five-month post-election period and all other months (first difference), by the differences between the six population categories (second differences). Findings show that population categories differed in their mental health attributable to the five-month post-election period. White respondents in Clinton states experienced a higher rate of poor mental health days during the five-month post-election period by a factor of 1.073 compared to white respondents in Trump states (95% CI: 1.017–1.132), accounting for all else. English-speaking Latinx respondents in Trump states may have had the greatest increase in the rate of poor mental health days during the five-month post-election period, with a rate 1.131 times that of white respondents in Trump states (95% CI: 0.926–1.380), aligning with our symbolic disempowerment hypothesis. However, the confidence interval (CI) overlaps with one. On the other hand, English-speaking Latinx respondents in Clinton states had a slightly lower, but not significantly different rate of poor mental health days during the five-month post-election compared to white respondents in Trump states. Postestimation tests showed that the rate of poor mental health days during the five-month post-election period among English-speaking Latinx did not differ significantly comparing those in Trump states to those in Clinton states (see Appendix C ). Compared to white respondents in Trump states, Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents in Trump and Clinton states experienced a greater decrease in the rate of poor mental health days during the five-month post-election period, although this is only marginally so for those living in Trump states (p < 0.1).

Fig. 2 presents the predicted number of poor mental health days and 95% CIs for each of the five post-election months (solid lines) compared to estimated poor mental health days in all other months in the 2011–2018 time period (dashed lines), accounting for control variables. For the white population in Trump states, the predicted numbers of poor mental health days in the past 30 days were slightly higher in November 2016 and February 2017 than all other months ( Fig. 2 A). For the white population in Clinton states, the predicted numbers of poor mental health days were elevated in each of the five months and were most pronounced in December 2016 and in February 2017, which amounted to a 0.72 and 0.53 higher number of poor mental health days than average, respectively ( Fig. 2 B). The English-speaking Latinx population in Trump states experienced the most elevated average numbers of poor mental health days in November 2016 and February 2017, compared to any other population category ( Fig. 2 C). The predicted number of poor mental health days in November 2016 and February 2017 was 5.35 and 6.17, respectively, which amounted to 1.40 and 2.23 more days than average, and these differences were significant (p = 0.055 and p = 0.029). For the English-speaking Latinx population in Clinton states, the predicted number of poor mental health days did not differ greatly in each of the post-election months compared to all other months ( Fig. 2 D). Spanish-speaking Latinx populations in general had the lowest predicted number of poor mental health days compared to other population categories. For the Spanish-speaking Latinx population in Trump states, the lowest predicted number of poor mental health days were reported in January 2017 at 0.42 ( Fig. 2 E). For the Spanish-speaking Latinx population in Clinton states, the predicted number of poor mental health days in each of the five post-election months remained low and close to the average in other months ( Fig. 2 F).

Sensitivity analysis showed that shortening the analytic time frame to 2013–2018 changed the results of the difference-in-differences analysis, such that the five-month post-election period was not associated as strongly with a lower rate of poor mental health days among Spanish-speaking Latinx populations, with p > 0.1. The rest of the results remained similar. Further sensitivity analysis showed the effect of the post-election period was similar in the six-month as in the five-month period, but the magnitude of the association of the post-election period for English-speaking Latinx in Trump states was greater and reached marginal significance (p < 0.1) in the negative binomial regression model with a six-month post-election period. By the seventh month, post-election associations with poor mental health were lessened for English-speaking Latinx in Trump states (data available upon request).

Section: 4. Discussion

This study examined whether and to what extent the 2016 presidential election was associated with population-level mental health changes in the months immediately following the election. We extended the concept of symbolic empowerment to include symbolic disempowerment in our theoretical framework ( Brown et al., 2020 ). As such, we expected that populations would differ in their mental health following the election of President Trump, which portended a future in which anti-immigration policy actions would be realized. Namely, we expected that we would find differences by race/ethnicity, language of interview, and state political environment, with groups most likely to be stigmatized in a racist and xenophobic sociopolitical context experiencing worsened mental health compared to groups less affected by racism and xenophobia. Ultimately, we found differences in mental health following the 2016 election that varied by population characteristics.
First, we discuss the white population, the group that we expected to be either less personally affected by a racist and xenophobic sociopolitical environment following the election of President Trump (making them a point of comparison), or to have experienced symbolic empowerment as a result of President Trump's win (particularly in states that voted for Trump). In the white population, we did observe differences by state political environment. White residents in Clinton states had a more pronounced elevation in mental health days in response to the 2016 presidential election than white residents in Trump states. The month of December 2016, which captures the time period soon following the November 8th election, was one of the only months in all of 2011–2018 in which whites in Clinton states reported a notably higher average number of poor mental health days in the past 30 days than whites in Trump states, by an average of about 0.5 days. The five-month post-election period was associated with an increased rate of poor mental health days among the white population in Clinton states compared to the white population in Trump states, accounting for potential confounders. Although every month in the five-month post-election period showed higher than average number of poor mental health days for the white population in Clinton states, this was most pronounced in December 2016 and February 2017.
The white population in Trump states did not appear to experience symbolic empowerment as a whole, as there did not seem to be an effect beneficial to mental health following the election. On the contrary, the predicted number of poor mental health days was slightly elevated compared to on average in November 2016 and February 2017, but these differences were not as great as those seen among their counterparts in Clinton states. These findings suggest that for the white population, especially in states where Clinton won the majority of votes, the election of President Trump was a stressful event, which may coincide with existing research on stress and poor mental health resulting from being on the losing side of an election ( Pierce et al., 2016 ; Baum-Baicker, 2020 ). It is possible that white populations in Clinton states experienced symbolic disempowerment in a sociopolitical climate that portended that they or issues they cared about would be marginalized. We also note that among the white population broadly, monthly averages of poor mental health days have been trending upwards from about 2017 and thereafter. Future research should track this trend to see if it continues.
Next, we discuss the association between the 2016 presidential election post-election period and mental health among the English-speaking Latinx population by state political environment. Analyses showed that the English-speaking Latinx population living in Trump states may have experienced the highest levels of poor mental health days due to the 2016 election, as evidenced by descriptive analyses and the difference-in-differences analysis. Although the latter analysis suggested that English-speaking Latinx in Trump states fared worst in terms of mental health during the five-month post-election period, the confidence interval for the IRR was wide and overlapped with one. Nevertheless, the predicted number of poor mental health days were the highest among English-speaking Latinx in Trump states compared to any other population category in the months of November 2016 and in February 2017. These spikes in poor mental health days may reflect reactions to the sociopolitical environment created by President Trump's election and his initial days in office during which he passed several anti-immigration executive orders ( Gemmill et al., 2019 ; Santamaría Graff, 2017 ; Zoppo et al., 2017 ). This finding aligns with our symbolic disempowerment expectation of worsened mental health as a result of the election of a president who ran on an openly anti-immigrant policy platform. These findings also coincide with other evidence of increased distress among Latinx populations following the election ( Gemmill et al., 2020 ; Krupenkin et al., 2019 ). It is possible that living in states where Trump won the majority of the vote may have further exacerbated the effect of an anti-immigrant sociopolitical environment, because those states do not offer protection for Latinx communities from federal actions and because those states may actively support policies that negatively affect Latinx people, regardless of their nativity and citizenship status ( Ayón, 2018 ; Vargas and Ybarra, 2017 ).
The increase in poor mental health during the post-election period was only observed among the English-speaking Latinx population in Trump states, not Clinton states. Living in states that voted for Clinton may have protected them against the poor mental health effects of the national policy environment at the population-level ( Young et al., 2019 ; De Trinidad Young and Wallace, 2019 ). The cities within those states, or the states themselves, would have been more likely to declare themselves as “sanctuary” cities or states in the wake of Trump's anti-immigrant actions. Many actions in those states in support of Latinx and immigrant communities following the election of President Trump, including social justice marches, law suits, and local policies, may have supported mental health among English-speaking Latinxs in Clinton states ( Zepeda-Millán et al., 2018 ; Hope et al., 2018 ). This may explain why mental health of the English-speaking Latinx population in Clinton states was not rated as poorly as that of the English-speaking Latinx population in Trump states following the 2016 election.
In contrast to the English-speaking Latinx population, the Spanish-speaking Latinx population reported better mental health in the post-election period than in other months. This finding was especially pronounced for the Spanish-speaking Latinx population in states that voted for Trump. Results seem to contradict other studies—including quantitative and qualitative studies in states and local areas—that have found increased stress and negative health effects of anti-immigrant sociopolitical environments among Latinx immigrants and worsened mental health after the 2016 election ( Ro et al., 2020 ; Andrade, 2017 ). One possible explanation is that Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents in Trump states are political conservatives. About 28% of Latinxs voted for Trump in 2016, many of whom voted in conjunction with their values ( Sonneland and Fleischner, 2016 ; Damore and Decisions, 2016 ). For example, many Cuban Americans, as well as Venezuelan and Nicaraguan immigrants who escaped autocratic regimes, supported Trump and the Republican Party rather than Democratic candidates, whom they viewed as too socialist ( Bermúdez, 2020 ; Krogstad and Flores, 2016 ). Further, many highly religious Protestant and Roman Catholic Latinxs may have also voted to support conservative views ( Cadava, 2020 ). Therefore, if BRFSS was capturing these conservative Spanish-speaking Latinx populations in Trump states, they may have indeed reported better mental health as a result of the election. BRFSS does not contain information on individuals’ political affiliations or voting behaviors to explore this possibility.
Another explanation is that Spanish-speaking Latinx populations who were negatively affected by an anti-immigrant sociopolitical context, especially those who were undocumented or had undocumented persons in their family and close social circles, would have been less likely to respond in large numbers to BRFSS in the months following the election. If this were the case, the Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents who are captured in BRFSS during the highly anti-immigrant political environment following the election may have been only those who are highly resilient. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the characteristics of non-responders. Other studies have similarly noted this coverage bias of BRFSS data, such that socially marginalized communities are systematically excluded from population-based social surveys in general ( Brown et al., 2020 ). Future work should further explore the diversity of Latinx populations in relation to the responses to election outcomes.
We also note that over the 2011–2018 study period there was a consistent downward trend in reported number of poor mental health days for Spanish-speaking Latinxs. Whether this trend is due to actual improvements in mental health, greater health selection of Latinx immigrants, or increased pressure of reporting bias towards better health, is unclear ( Morey et al., 2020 ; Jasso, 2011 ). The decrease in poor mental health days in the five-month post-election period may, in part, reflect this larger trend. Whereas we used time-series methods to control for overall trends and other patterns (e.g., seasonality) in mental health over time, these methods applied to the overall BRFSS participants (rather than to any stratum) and therefore cannot rule out this possibility of unique stratum-specific trends.
It is also notable that mental health was consistently worse among the English-speaking Latinx population than the Spanish-speaking Latinx population and the white population during the entire study period. This poor mental health among the English-speaking Latinx population (who we assume are more likely to be U.S.-born or more acculturated immigrants than Spanish-speaking Latinx respondents) may reflect a minority stress process ( Meyer, 1995 ). The stress of racialization and stigmatization that Latinx people experience in U.S. society over time could lead to worse mental health outcomes ( García, 2017 ; Nichols et al., 2018 ; Asad and Clair, 2018 ). Therefore, the findings of the effect of the sociopolitical climate should be considered in the broader context of a diverse ethnic group already experiencing mental health disparities due to racism and anti-immigrant stigma.
A limitation of BRFSS for addressing our research question is that we do not have data on the nativity status or immigration status of respondents. We can assume that some English-speaking Latinx respondents in this study were immigrants, and some were not. Nevertheless, the broader English-speaking Latinx population may be affected by anti-immigration rhetoric and policy, regardless of immigration or nativity status, because of the effect that these policies have on the communities with which Latinx people largely identify ( García, 2017 ). In addition, BRFSS does not measure individuals’ political views or political engagement. Therefore, we cannot measure the mediating or moderating effects of personal political affiliation. Another weakness of BRFSS is that the white and Latinx categories are likely overly broad—including Arab, Middle Eastern, South American, Central American, Caribbean, and other more specific populations—who may have experienced different mental health effects as a result of the election.
We could not determine individuals' exposure to political rhetoric and policies during the 2016 election. A major assumption is that much of the population was aware of, and potentially affected by, national politics during the post-election time period. If many of the BRFSS respondents surveyed did not have access to or ignored information about the 2016 election and President Trump's actions soon afterward, then population-level effects on mental health would have been dampened. Therefore, our study may actually underestimate the effect of the post-2016 election period on poor mental health, especially among people who were more attuned to national politics at the time. Lastly, we do not have information on coping. Some studies of election effects show that how people respond to an undesired election outcome—such as by reappraising the event, validating their stressful experiences, or engaging in political activism—which may reduce negative mental health impacts ( Andrade, 2017 ; Ford et al., 2019 ).
Despite these limitations, this study provides important preliminary evidence of population-level differences in mental health at the national-level due to presidential politics, with variations shown by race/ethnicity, language, and state election context.

Section: 5. Conclusion

The 2016 presidential election of Donald Trump had population-wide effects on mental health in the short term. Future major elections and political events have the potential to affect population mental health, especially during highly polarizing, contentious, and publicized political moments ( Williams and Medlock, 2017 ). Our study shows that not all populations respond equally to national political events. Groups that experienced symbolic disempowerment are most likely to be negatively affected. Populations that have much to lose, including stigmatized racial/ethnic and immigrant communities in states where their lives and livelihoods are not prioritized, may be especially vulnerable to anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions proliferated by political actors ( Ayón, 2018 ; Vargas and Ybarra, 2017 ). More privileged groups such as white populations, who live in states where the majority are disturbed by national politics that are against their values, may also be negatively affected. Population health experts should continue to monitor the disparate mental health responses to elections and to other prominent political events. Public health responses to poor mental health during times of political turmoil should focus on communities most negatively affected and employ multi-level approaches to protect mental health through policy advocacy. In sum, this study provides further evidence that the U.S. presidential sociopolitical environment is a social determinant of health ( Rodriguez, 2019 ). Given this, we hope that future inquiry may expand on the concepts of symbolic dis/empowerment to measure and assess how sociopolitical environments shape population health in contentious times.
