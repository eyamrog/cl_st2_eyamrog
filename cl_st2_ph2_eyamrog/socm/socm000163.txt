Title: Fast food restaurant density and weight status: A spatial analysis among Filipina migrant workers in Macao (SAR), People's Republic of China


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Female migrant populations are at high risk of being overweight or obese. Beyond individual risk factors , exposure to the neighborhood food environment may contribute to their unhealthy weight status in the host region. Incorporating spatial analysis, this study examined the association between exposure to fast food restaurants and unhealthy weight status among Filipina domestic workers in Macao (SAR), China.
Methods and Findings : Data were collected from 1388 Filipina domestic workers recruited using respondent-driven sampling between November 2016 to August 2017. Self-reported data on demographic characteristics, residential mailing address, and health-related behaviors were collected using tablet devices. Height and weight were objectively measured at the study site. Restaurant locations and resident addresses were geocoded and integrated into a shapefile for residential locations using ArcGIS. Nearly 64% of participants were classified as being overweight or obese, with 25.02% overweight and 38.96% obese. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression indicated that increased fast food restaurant density within a 0.5-mile buffer zone around a residential address was positively associated with higher odds of being overweight and obese (aOR = 1.07; 95% CI [1.01–1.14].
Conclusions : Increased fast food restaurant density was associated with unhealthy weight status among Filipina domestic workers in Macao (SAR), China. Providing healthy working environment, including access to healthy food, is indicated to improve the health of this population. Keywords: overweight; obesity; migrant workers; fast food restaurant density; spatial analysis.

Section: 1. Introduction

Overweight and obesity is a worldwide public health problem associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and other non-communicable disease morbidity and mortality ( GBD, 2015 Obesity Collaborators et al., 2017 ). According to the latest global estimates, a large proportion of adults are either overweight (39%) or obese (13%) ( World Health Organization, 2018 ). Migration is associated with unhealthy weight gain ( Delavari et al., 2013 ; McDonald and Kennedy, 2005 ; Murphy et al., 2017 ), and populations migrating from low- or middle-income regions to high-income regions are at higher risk of being overweight and obese than their counterparts back home ( Agyemang et al., 2009 ; Toselli et al., 2014 ). These migrants also experience a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity compared to the general population in the host region ( Daryani et al., 2005 ; Fernandez et al., 2011 ; Gadd et al., 2005 ; Toselli et al., 2014 ).
Previous studies found that unhealthy weight gain among migrants was positively associated with their length of migration and level of acculturation ( Delavari et al., 2013 ). Along with the process of acculturation, migrant populations tend to adopt more obesogenic behaviors, such as increased consumption of food with high saturated fat ( Franzen and Smith, 2009 ; Himmelgreen et al., 2007 ; Popovic-Lipovac and Strasser, 2015 ) and decreased leisure-time physical activity ( Gadd et al., 2005 ; Sullivan et al., 2011 ), which are key contributors to unhealthy weight gain in the host region.
Much of the research focused on weight gain and obesity among migrants focused on individual factors, such as lifestyle, energy balance, and the consumption of calorie-dense foods, rather than on the availability of non-nutritious food options ( Franzen and Smith, 2009 ; Gadd et al., 2005 ; Himmelgreen et al., 2007 ; Popovic-Lipovac and Strasser, 2015 ; Renzaho et al., 2008 ). However, migrants are constantly exposed to their neighborhood food environment, which may not offer healthy options. Previous studies demonstrate that the availability of nutritious foods is significantly associated with lower Body Mass Index (BMI) ( Fiechtner et al., 2016 ; Jilcott et al., 2011 ; Larsen et al., 2015 ), while exposure to poor quality but aggressively-marketed fast food options is associated with obesity ( Li et al., 2009 ; Maddock, 2004 ). This problem is particularly salient among people with low socioeconomic status ( Wang et al., 2007 ). Urban residents with low socioeconomic status, compared to those of high socioeconomic status, are more likely to live in “food deserts,” which refers to neighborhoods with greater access to unhealthy food options and limited availability of nutritious foods ( Block et al., 2004 ; Duran et al., 2013 ; Hemphill et al., 2008 ; Smoyer-Tomic et al., 2008 ; Walker et al., 2010 ). Considering the above, beyond individual risk, it is also important to identify neighborhood level characteristics that contribute to unhealthy weight gain among migrant populations.
Previous studies examining the relationship between neighborhood-level food environment and physical health outcomes mainly focused on non-migrant populations in Western countries. To our knowledge, no study has been conducted to examine this relationship among South East Asians. Some studies found that the availability of low-cost, high-calorie food in neighborhoods was associated with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) among residents in the United States ( Block et al., 2011 ; Jilcott et al., 2011 ; Li et al., 2009 ; Powell et al., 2007 ) and Canada ( Hollands et al., 2013 ; Larsen et al., 2015 ), while some studies found no association between food environment and BMI ( Jeffery et al., 2006 ; Lopez, 2007 ). There is evidence showing that this association was stronger among those with low socioeconomic status, which may contribute to the heterogeneity in associations. A study conducted among African American urban residents showed that fast food restaurant density was positively associated with BMI particularly among participants with lower income ( Reitzel et al., 2014 ). The abundance of convenience stores in low socioeconomic neighborhoods was significantly associated with higher body fat percentage of young residents in the United States ( Laska et al., 2010 ). However, the relationship between neighborhood food environment and weight status among economically distressed transnational migrant populations who are more vulnerable to poor physical health outcomes remains unexplored.
Few correlates of overweight and obesity were identified specifically among migrant populations. Longer years of migration was associated with higher risk of being obese among South Asian migrants in the United Arab Emirates ( Shah et al., 2015 ). Dietary change with increasing fat and sugar intake was associated with obesity among migrants in Western countries ( Popovic-Lipovac and Strasser, 2015 ). Level of acculturation, defined as the degree of psychological, behavioral, and attitudinal changes that occur when individuals and groups enter a different cultural context ( Cabassa, 2003 ), is another important correlate of overweight and obesity among adult migrant populations. A systematic review found consistent evidence that higher acculturation level was associated with unhealthy weight gain among male migrants, but the results for female migrants were mixed ( Delavari et al., 2013 ). The authors of the review suggested that the interplay of food choices, diet, and physical activity might contribute to the inconsistent results for female migrants and suggested that additional studies on the correlates of overweight and obesity are needed focused on female migrants in particular.
There are over 150-million migrant workers worldwide ( International Labour Office, 2015 ). At the end of 2018, Macao, a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, was home to 181,723 migrant workers, which accounted for 25% of its total population ( DSAL, 2018 ). One of the largest groups of migrant workers in Macao are domestic workers, but little is known about their health and well-being ( Hall et al., 2019 ). By the end of 2018, there were 28,692 female domestic workers in Macao, of which over 15,495 were Filipina ( DSAL, 2018 ). According to the World Health Organization (2016) , the prevalence of overweight and obesity among female adults in the Philippines was 24.7% and 6.1% respectively, which is similar to the estimates for adult female local Macao residents (21.6% for overweight, 5.6% for obesity) ( SSM, 2017 ). Although back in The Philippines, Filipinas share similar prevalence of overweight and obesity with female Macao citizens, their average weight status after migration remains unknown.
Using a population representative sample, this study aimed to determine if the prevalence of overweight and obesity of this specific migrant population is still similar to female Macao citizens and Filipinas in The Philippines. This migrant population is of particular importance for research for two main reasons. For one thing, The Philippines was a Spanish colony for more than 300 years and more recently by the United States for almost half a century. During the later colonial period, Western fast food, characterized by high fat and calories, was introduced to the Philippines and incorporated into the Filipino diet ( Fernadez, 1986 ; Kleinfelder, 2005 ). For Filipina domestic workers in Macao, Western-style fast food might be a popular food choice given its similarity to regular dietary choices at home. Secondly, Macao is a city with high price of commodities and cost of living. This migrant population is under the financial pressure of high living cost given their limited monthly salary. Meanwhile, most of them are also under the pressure of sending remittance back home and repaying debts ( Hall et al., 2019 ). Even if they share a food environment with the rest of the local Macao population, they are likely more prone to making unhealthy food choices compared to the rest of the population. In addition, a qualitative study revealed that migrant domestic workers in Macao tend to have long working hours ( Hall et al., 2019 ). Fast food serves as a cheap and quick food source for them given the financial and time constraints they experience while working in Macao. Exploring the neighborhood food environment is relevant to understand if exposure to Western fast food a potential source of unhealthy weight status for this migrant population in Macao.
No previous study examined correlates of overweight or obesity among female migrant domestic workers. The current study aimed to evaluate spatial correlates of unhealthy weight status among adult Filipina transnational migrant domestic workers in Macao. The associations between fast food restaurant density and objectively measured BMI was examined. We hypothesized that proximity to Western fast food restaurants would be associated with higher odds of being overweight or obese in this population.

Section: 2. Method

Respondent-driven sampling ( Heckathorn, 1997 ) was used to recruit participants who were eligible for the PRIDE study from November 2016 to August 2017. We first enrolled seven people who were well-connected in the community as “seeds.” After being briefed about the purpose and the recruitment process of the study, the “seeds” received uniquely coded, non-replicable coupons to recruit up to five eligible community members. When participants recruited by “seeds” presented at the study site with valid coupons, their working permit or visa was checked to ensure eligibility. After participation, they were offered coupons to recruit up to five eligible community members to the study. For each eligible recruit participating in the study, 20MOP (~$2.50USD) was given to the recruiter as remuneration. The same recruitment procedure was repeated until the end of the study.
The study site was set up in a community-based non-governmental organization in Macao. After eligibility assessment and provision of informed consent at the study site, participants were asked to complete a structured survey using tablet devices to collect self-reported data on demographic characteristics, residential mailing address, physical health conditions, and health related behaviors. After the survey, participants went through a physical health assessment administered by trained staff in a private area at the study site. The physical health assessment included the measurement of height, weight, and body fat percentage. Upon completion, participants received 100MOP (~$13.00USD) in cash to compensate for their time and effort. The Research Ethics Committee at the University of Macau approved this study.
A total of 1388 Filipina domestic workers participated in the Population Research Initiative for Domestic Employees (PRIDE) study, which aimed to assess the overall health condition of migrant domestic workers, working and living in Macao (SAR), People's Republic of China. The inclusion criteria of the PRIDE study were: 1) being 18 years of age or older; 2) being a Filipina domestic worker; and 3) holding a valid work visa or a residence ID card of the Macao (SAR).
All survey items went through a process of forward and backward translation. Each item was assessed using think-aloud cognitive interviewing with a small sample representative of the target population to ensure that the item was relevant, non-offensive, translated well, and understandable.
Body mass index (BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was calculated based on height measured by trained staff and weight measured by a TANITA scale (TBF-300 A Body Composition Analyzer; TANITA, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). Each anthropometric measurement was taken twice, and the average of the two assessments is presented in this study ( Cogill, 2003 ; Mony et al., 2016 ).
BMI categories were based on the WHO Western Pacific Region (WPRO) criteria pertaining to overweight and obesity ( World Health Organization, 2000 ). These criteria achieved better sensitivity and similar specificity among the study population in identifying overweight and obese compared to the general WHO criteria ( Huang et al., 2020 ). According to the WHO WPRO criteria, people were classified as overweight with BMI ≥ 23 and obese with BMI ≥ 25. According to WHO, both overweight and obesity are defined as “abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health.” In this study, we categorized overweight and obesity together in contrast with normal weight and underweight consistent with previous studies ( Baumgartner et al., 2011 ; Bharmal et al., 2015 ; Dijkshoorn et al., 2008 ; Guo et al., 2015 ), to examine the association between fast food restaurant exposure and the odds of being at this unhealthy weight status, which poses threats to their health.
Participants provided their residential address in the survey. The addresses were geocoded, and a shapefile for participants’ residential locations was created using ArcGIS version 10.6.1 (ESRI, Redlands, California).
Fast food restaurants were defined as Western chain restaurants selling fast food , which is affordable and popular among the target population. The decision of including only Western chain fast food restaurants is based on our formative exploratory interview with a small group of Filipina domestic workers. During the interviews, they did not mention any other non-Western or non-chain restaurants they visit. A list containing 24 fast food restaurants frequented by the target population was constructed based on these formative interviews. The addresses of fast food restaurant were obtained from Macao Local Business Directory (mlocal.biz), an online directory providing information on local business. We geocoded the addresses and integrated them into the shapefile for residential locations using ArcGIS version 10.6.1 (ESRI, Redlands, California).
In previous studies, exposure to fast food restaurants was commonly measured by density within the buffer zone near a participant's residence ( Jilcott et al., 2011 ; Reitzel et al., 2014 ). Buffer zones with 0.25-mile and 0.5-mile radius were created for each participant with the residence as the center point. The number of fast food restaurants within the buffer zone was obtained for each participant. Instead of constructing buffer zones around residences, some studies also used official boundaries and calculated density of fast food restaurant within the official district (e.g., a unique ZIP code; ( Gibson, 2011 ; Powell et al., 2007 ). In this study, both methods were used to calculate fast food restaurant density since the official district may not meaningfully represent neighborhood boundaries and might be too large to meaningfully detect spatial associations within the population under study.
Official neighborhoods were defined by the official statistical district. The official boundaries of 24 statistical districts in Macao were obtained from the government website ( DSCC, 2018 ) and mapped using ArcGIS version 10.6.1 (ESRI, Redlands, California). By overlapping participants' residential locations, fast food restaurant locations, and official boundaries of districts, we obtained the number of fast food restaurant within participants’ neighborhood.
Two variables were created for each participant to measure the number of fast food restaurants within 0.25- and 0.50-mile buffer zone around their residential locations, which are equivalent to 5- and 10-min walking distance respectively. Since this population primarily walks and take buses, these buffer zones are more meaningful given that Macao is geographically small with high population and building density. The Service Area tool in the ArcGIS Network Analyst version 10.6.1 (ESRI, Redlands, California) was used to draw the buffer zones and count the number of fast food restaurants within them.
Physical activity was measured by the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire ( Shephard, 1997 ). The scale demonstrated good validity and reliability in previous studies ( Amireault and Godin, 2015 ; Rauh et al., 1992 ), and was previously used to measure physical activity among migrants ( Walker et al., 2015 ). Participants were asked to report the frequency of engaging in strenuous exercise, moderate exercise, and mild exercise for more than 15 min during a week, respectively. The weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and mild activities were then multiplied by nine, five, and three, respectively, and summed to obtain the weekly leisure activity score (Cronbach's α = .73). Participants were also asked to rate the weekly frequency of engaging in regular activity long enough to work up a sweat as “Often,” “Sometime,” or “Never/Rarely.”
Participants provided their age, marital status, duration of migration (i.e., months working as a domestic worker in Macao), residency status (i.e., living in the employer's residence or in a separate residence), monthly salary, current indebtedness (coded 0 = no, 1 = yes), total working hours per week, and frequency of being invited to eat meals at the table with the employer (coded 1 = daily, 2 = weekly, 3 = monthly, 4 = never) in the survey.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 14 ( StataCorp, 2015 ). The percentage of missing data was less than 3%. Missing data were handled using pairwise deletion. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize study participants. General linear regression models were used to examine the associations between exposure to fast food restaurants (buffer zone around residential location and density within official neighborhood) and overweight and obesity (BMI). Univariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between fast food restaurant exposure and BMI categories. In multivariable analyses, level of physical activity, age, marital status, number of months working as a domestic worker in Macao, residency status (i.e., living in the employer's residence or in a separate residence), monthly salary, current indebtedness, total working hours per week, and frequency of being invited to eat meals at the table with the employer were included as potential confounders.
According to previous literature, level of physical activity, age, marital status, income, and duration of migration were common confounders in the association between fast food exposure and weight status ( Fraser et al., 2010 ; Hollands et al., 2013 ; Pan et al., 2014 ; Reitzel et al., 2014 ). In addition, due to the nature of domestic work, having no debt, living in the employer's residence, having food allowance, being invited to eat meals at the table with the employer, and longer working hours, are theoretically associated with lower exposure to fast food restaurant and healthier physical health outcomes. Therefore, these covariates were also included in multivariable analyses.
A previous spatial analysis study in this sample population demonstrated that residency status modified the association between exposure to gambling venues and gambling disorder ( Yi et al., 2019 ). Considering that living in a separated residence apart from an employer may modify the association between exposure to fast food restaurant and weight status, additional multivariable models, which included living in a separate residence apart from an employer × fast food restaurant density as an interaction term, were generated in addition to the main effect models presented above. Moreover, some employers provided food allowance to their domestic workers, which may also modify the association between exposure to fast food restaurant and weight status. Additional multivariable models, which included having food allowance × fast food restaurant density as an interaction term, were generated in addition to the main effect models presented above.

Section: 3. Results

Participant (n = 1388) characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The age of participants ranged from 18 to 67, with a median age of 41. Married was the most frequent marital status (44.45%), most had at least one child (78.03%), and obtaining a high school diploma was the most frequent educational attainment (36.31%). Half of the participants had been working as a domestic worker in Macao for more than 39 months. Their median number of working hours per week was 68 and their median income per month was 3,700MOP (~$458.00USD). The majority reported current debt (52.52%). In addition to their monthly salary, 21.3% reported receiving a food allowance from their employer. Table 1 . Participant characteristics.

Participant BMI ranged from 16.29 kg/ m 2 to 37.51 kg/ m 2 ( M = 24.45, SD = 3.29). More than half the sample (63.98%) were classified as being overweight or obese, with 25.02% being overweight and 38.96% being obese. The mean weekly leisure activity score was 29.03 ( SD = 33.26), and 16.58% participants reported often working up a sweat.
On average, there were 1.46 fast food restaurants ( SD = 1.55; range = 0–7) within neighborhoods, 1.63 fast food restaurants ( SD = 1.06; range = 0–5) within 0.25-mile buffer zone, and 4.84 fast food restaurants ( SD = 2.06; range = 0–9) within 0.5-mile buffer zone.
In univariable analyses, fast food restaurant density within official neighborhood was not significantly associated with overweight and obesity. For fast food density within 0.25- and 0.5-mile buffer zones, a higher density of fast food restaurants within 0.5-mile buffer zone was positively associated with higher odds of being overweight or obese (OR = 1.07; 95% CI [1.00–1.13]). No significant association was found between weight status and fast food restaurant density within 0.25-mile buffer zone (See Table 2 ). Table 2 .

Adjusted multivariable logistic regression model results showed that adjusting for potential confounders, fast food restaurant density within a 0.5-mile buffer zone around a residential location was significantly and positively associated with higher odds of being overweight and obese ( Table 3 ). For every additional fast food restaurant within the buffer zone, the adjusted odds of being overweight or obese increased by 1.07; 95% CI [1.01–1.14]. Overweight and obesity was not significantly associated with fast food restaurant density within 0.25-mile buffer zone or within official neighborhoods after adjusting for potential confounders.

Additional multivariable models with interaction terms showed that living in a separated residence apart from an employer does not modify the association between fast food restaurant density and weight status regardless of the buffer size (0.25-mile buffer: p = 0.18; 0.50-mile buffer: p = 0.29; official neighborhood: p = 0.88). The interaction between having food allowance and fast food restaurant density was not significant regardless of the buffer size (0.25-mile buffer: p = 0.38; 0.50-mile buffer: p = 0.36; official neighborhood: p = 0.85).

Section: 4. Discussion

This study examined the association between fast food restaurant density and BMI among Filipina transnational migrant workers in Macao (SAR), People's Republic of China. The results show that fast food restaurant density within a 0.5-mile buffer zone around residential locations was significantly associated with higher odds of being overweight or obese, which supports our hypothesis. This finding is consistent with previous literature in which fast food restaurant density is positively associated with being overweight or obese ( Davis and Carpenter, 2009 ; Li et al., 2009 ; Mehta and Chang, 2008 ) and higher BMI ( Hollands et al., 2013 ; Jilcott et al., 2011 ), particularly among ethnic minority groups with low socioeconomic status ( Reitzel et al., 2014 ). Fast food restaurant density was only associated with weight status within 0.5-mile buffer zone, but not for 0.25-mile buffer zone and official neighborhood; this result probably occurred because there are too few restaurants within 0.25-mile buffer zone to reflect spatial patterns of association. Moreover, official administrative boundaries may not reflect meaningful neighborhood boundaries.
Nearly 64% of the Filipina domestic workers in this population representative sample were either overweight or obese. The prevalence is much higher than that for adult Filipina in The Philippines (24.7% for overweight, 6.1% for obesity) (WHO, 2016), and for adult female local Macao residents (21.6% for overweight, 5.6% for obesity) ( SSM, 2017 ). This is consistent with previous literatures in which migrant populations are at higher risk of being overweight and obese than both their counterparts back home ( Agyemang et al., 2009 ; Toselli et al., 2014 ) and the general population in the host region ( Daryani et al., 2005 ; Fernandez et al., 2011 ; Gadd et al., 2005 ; Toselli et al., 2014 ).
Since domestic workers are largely dependent on employers for the provision of salary and benefits, which in turn can affect overweight and obesity, we evaluated two employment-related effect modifiers. Although a previous spatial analysis study found residency status was a significant effect modifier in this sample population ( Yi et al., 2019 ), no modified association between fast food restaurant density and weight status was found by residency status. Living with the employer has no buffering effect on fast food exposure and weight status, which indicates that, although living in the same home, the employer may not provide a health promoting working environment, or particularly healthy food for domestic workers. Meanwhile, this population may often consume fast food on holidays, which gives them the same opportunity of exposure to fast food near their own residence regardless of living with or apart from the employer during working days. Food allowance did not significantly modify the association between fast food restaurant density and weight status. This finding suggests that having food allowance has no buffering effect on fast food exposure and weight status. Filipina domestic workers in Macao may not use food allowance to improve their diet given competing financial priorities. Instead, they may save this money for other uses, such as repaying debts and sending remittance back home, which highlights their particular vulnerability due to the enactment of expected gender roles involving caretaking and familial sacrifice ( Hall et al., 2019 ; Schumann and Paul, 2019 ; Vargas, Garabiles and Hall, 2020 ).
Higher fast food restaurant density was associated with higher odds of overweight or obesity, which indicated that exposure to Western fast food is a potential source of unhealthy weight status in the host region for this migrant population. From a public health and health equity perspective, migrant workers should be included in boarder campaigns made by local government and non-governmental organizations to reduce unhealthy weight at the population level. These efforts must also acknowledge that overweight and obesity within this population may also intersect with poverty and a gendered pattern of familial sacrifice ( Garabiles et al., 2017 ; Vargas, Garabiles and Hall, 2020 ), whereby the domestic workers forgo attending to their own health to provide for dependents who rely on their remittances.
In order to address the weight status of this population, a multilevel approach is indicated. These may include exercise and lifestyle programs that are designed to promote healthy diet and exercise that are tailored to meet the schedules of domestic workers. Given limited leisure time, mobile phone enhanced nutrition and exercise programs could be developed and implemented. In addition, structured aerobics sessions and nutritional education about diet held by churches and non-governmental organizations could be useful in both controlling weight and facilitating social relationships and enhancing social capital within migrant communities ( Bell et al., 2001 ). Some local non-governmental organizations in Macao have provided similar classes for migrant workers, and their effectiveness could be evaluated in future studies.
From a broader structural and policy perspective, the current findings highlight the need to develop policies and employment guidelines that promote a healthy working environment, including access to healthy food, to improve the health of this population. We suggest that providing access to healthy food could be included in Macao employment law for migrant domestic workers, and government subsidies could be provided to employers to ensure healthier diet and weight status of this population. Establishing laws and permits to regulate density of fast food restaurant and increase access to affordable healthy food choices around residential areas is also recommended.
This study has several strengths. First, respondent-driven sampling, which is an effective method for reaching “hidden” and hard-to-reach populations, was used in this study to ensure population representativeness of the sample. The current sample included 10% of the total Filipina domestic worker population at the time of the study. Second, objective anthropometric measurements were used to obtain the study outcomes, reducing measurement bias. Third, potential confounders were measured and controlled in the analyses to obtain less biased estimates of the association between fast food restaurant density and overweight and obesity.
Despite these strengths, several limitations of the study should be mentioned. First, since this is a cross-sectional study, causal inferences cannot be made. We did not have data on pre-migration weight, so evaluations of increases in weight and potentially causal processes were not possible. Second, the frequency and intensity of fast food consumption were not measured in this study. Since the positive association between exposure to fast food restaurant and fast food consumption have been demonstrated in many studies ( Davis and Carpenter, 2009 ; Li et al., 2009 ; Moore et al., 2009 ), data on fast food consumption was not obtained in this study to avoid burdening participants and concern about recall bias. Therefore, the association between restaurant density and overweight, obesity, and body fat percentage is a proxy for fast food consumption in this study. Third, although two different buffer sizes were used to capture the individual access to nearby fast food restaurant, the number of fast food restaurants included in this study is relatively small compared to a large number of participants, which may create bias in the calculation of the fast food restaurant density and spatial association. Fourth, given the limited spatial data available in Macao, it was not possible to use street-network buffers that accounted for transportation systems and road infrastructure, which would be more accurate in quantifying the accessibility to fast food and capturing spatial associations. However, there would likely be significant overlap in terms of accessibility when using a street-network buffer or a circular buffer as Macao is densely packed and very walkable. Finally, the results cannot be generalized to all Filipino transnational migrants, as the sample in this study excludes women who are not domestic workers and men. The distribution of fast food exposure and other key correlates may be different in these populations compared to domestic workers. Future studies might consider using a longitudinal design to track changes in weight status and exposure to fast food over time. Future studies might also consider using street-buffers and incorporate factors such as transportation systems and road infrastructure to better quantify the accessibility to fast food.
Since obtaining accurate food consumption data is challenging, future studies might also investigate whether exposure to fast food restaurants performs similarly as fast food consumption in predicting overweight or obesity, so that spatial correlates can be used in more studies when food consumption data are not available or infeasible to collect.

Section: 5. Conclusions

To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine spatial correlates of weight status among transnational migrant workers and to assess the weight status of Filipina Transnational migrant women. More than half the Filipina domestic workers in this study were either overweight or obese, which is a critical public health issue for this population. The present study provides evidence for key health inequalities for Filipina domestic workers in Macao, and exposure to Western fast food is a potential source of unhealthy weight status in the host region for this migrant population. It also suggests that the population health burden related to overweight and obesity presents a key public health challenge for returning Filipina Domestic workers to the Philippines.
