Title: Pet ownership during pregnancy and mothers' mental health conditions up to 1 year postpartum: A nationwide birth cohort—the Japan Environment and Children's Study


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Previous studies have investigated the relationship between pet ownership and mental health in various populations, but few have targeted women around childbirth when they have heightened vulnerability to mental disorders . This study therefore examined this association in women around childbirth .

Abstract_Section: Methods

Data were obtained from 80,814 mothers in an ongoing nationwide birth cohort study in Japan. Pet ownership status—none, dog(s) only, cat(s) only, or both—was determined during the second/third trimester of pregnancy. Mental health was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), with each score measured at two different time points around childbirth. Generalized linear models were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for pet ownership, with no pet ownership as the reference.

Abstract_Section: Results

Dog ownership was associated with reduced risk of depressive symptoms at 1 month (aOR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95–0.98) and 6 months postpartum (aOR: 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96–0.99) and with psychological distress at 12 months postpartum (aOR: 0.96, 95%CI: 0.92–0.999). In contrast, cat ownership was associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms at 6 months postpartum (aOR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02–1.06) and psychological distress in the second/third trimester (aOR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.12). Ownership of both cats and dogs was associated with increased risk of psychological distress in the second/third trimester (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03–1.21) but was largely similar to that of the reference group.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Dog ownership was a protective factor for maternal mental health problems, whereas cat ownership was a risk factor . These findings suggest that the type of pet owned, cat or dog, plays a differential role in maintaining mothers’ mental health in the perinatal and postpartum periods .

Section: 1. Introduction

Support from companion animals is considered to have a favorable effect on mental health. For example, a systematic review examining the association between assistant dogs and psychological health revealed that, among 58 studies, 21 were positive, 37 were neutral, and none was negative ( Rodriguez et al., 2020 ). Another systematic review examining people with mental disorders living with companion animals suggested that pets benefit this population ( Brooks et al., 2018 ). These beneficial effects may be based on various psychological mechanisms, such as reduced loneliness or stress or increased physical activity ( Cline, 2010 ; Wells, 2019 ).
Nonetheless, pet ownership itself does not always produce beneficial effects. For example, whereas some studies have shown lower levels of depression in pet owners than in people without pets ( Lem et al., 2016 ), others have shown the opposite effects in certain pet owner groups ( Fritz et al., 1996 ; Parslow et al., 2005 ). Of the two longitudinal studies examining the impact of pet acquisition on mental health, one using the 30-item General Health Questionnaire obtained a positive result ( Serpell, 1991 ), whereas the other using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) did not ( Powell et al., 2019 ). Some studies by pet type have found that dogs are more beneficial than cats ( Enmarker et al., 2015 ; Ikeuchi et al., 2021 ; Serpell, 1991 ), but others obtained the opposite results ( Branson et al., 2017 ). Such considerable heterogeneity could be attributed to differences in the background characteristics of pet owners ( Gulick and Krause-Parello, 2012 ; Purewal et al., 2019 ; Saunders et al., 2017 ), their attachment and attitude toward pets ( Fritz et al., 1996 ; Miltiades and Shearer, 2011 ; Min et al., 2019 ), and the study methods ( Wells, 2019 ).
Studies of pet ownership and mental health have targeted various populations, such as the elderly ( Branson et al., 2017 ; Enmarker et al., 2015 ; Gulick and Krause-Parello, 2012 ; Ikeuchi et al., 2021 ; Purewal et al., 2019 ; Raina et al., 1999 ), people living alone ( Antonacopoulos and Pychyl, 2010 ; Zasloff and Kidd, 1994 ), the homeless ( Lem et al., 2016 ), and the general population ( Cline, 2010 ; Lass-Hennemann et al., 2020 ; Wood et al., 2005 ). However, to our knowledge, only a few studies have focused on the association during pregnancy (e.g., Lynch et al., 2014 ). This issue should be addressed because women have heightened vulnerability to mental disorders during the perinatal period ( Goodman et al., 2016 ) and postpartum depression is a major health problem that exerts an adverse effect not only on mothers, but also on their children and families ( Gavin et al., 2005 ; O'Hara and McCabe, 2013 ; Pawluski et al., 2017 ; Robertson et al., 2004 ).
To this end, we used data from a nationwide birth cohort in Japan, the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), to examine the association of pet ownership during pregnancy with maternal mental health during the perinatal and subsequent postpartum periods up to 1 year. In particular, we focused on the two most commonly owned pets (cats and dogs) and the mental health conditions of depression and psychological distress before and after childbirth . We hypothesized that pet ownership would be associated with reduced risks of postpartum depression and psychological distress.

Section: 2. Methods

The JECS is an ongoing nationwide government-funded birth cohort study of various environmental factors and children's health and development. The detailed design and baseline characteristics of the JECS have been published elsewhere ( Kawamoto et al., 2014 ; Michikawa et al., 2018 ). Recruitment took place between January 2011 and March 2014 at public facilities, such as obstetrics and gynecology departments and health centers, across 15 regional centers throughout Japan, including rural and urban locations. The participation response rate was 78.5%. The study was approved the appropriate ethics committees. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All procedures contributing to this work complied with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans.
This study used the dataset jecs-ta-20190930 , which was released in October 2019. This dataset includes data on 103,060 pregnancies. Of these, 5647 pregnancies were excluded due to multiple registrations and 3561 due to miscarriages or stillbirths . Among the remaining 93,852 mothers, 1648 were subsequently excluded due to no response or missing data on pet ownership and 11,390 due to no response or missing data on potential confounders or complete no response to or missing data on outcomes. This left 80,814 mothers for complete case analysis ( Fig. 1 ). Finally, after accounting for missing values for each outcome in the second/third trimester and at 1, 6, 12 months postpartum, this left data for 80,287, 78,747, 75,226, and 73,619 mothers for analysis, respectively.

Section: 3. Measurements

The mothers completed a self-administered questionnaire on five occasions—in the first trimester , in the second/third trimester, and at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum—to collect information on demographic and socioeconomic status, medical and obstetric history, physical and mental health, lifestyle, and other topics. Up to 1 month postpartum, the questionnaires were distributed to the participants by JECS staff and were then collected at the co-operating health care providers when the participants visited for their health checkups. Questionnaires were returned by post if they could not be collected at that time. At 6 and 12 months, the questionnaires were distributed and collected by post.
Pet ownership status was determined in the second/third trimester using the question, “What kinds of pet do you have currently?” ( Iwai-Shimada et al., 2018 ). The participants answered this question using checkboxes. Participants who checked “cat” only were categorized into the “cat(s) only” group. Participants who checked “dog (kept inside of residence)” or “dog (kept outside of residence)” only were categorized into the “dog(s) only” group. Participants who checked both types were categorized into the “both” group. Participants who did not check either type were categorized into the “none” group.

Section: 4. Outcomes

The primary outcomes were total scores for depression and psychological distress measured using self-reported questionnaires. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS: Cox et al., 1987 ) was administered at 1 and 6 months postpartum. The EPDS is a 10-item self-reported questionnaire used to screen for postpartum depression (total score 0–30). The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6: Kessler et al., 2002 ) was administered in the second/third trimester and at 1 year postpartum. The K6 is a 6-item self-reported questionnaire developed to detect general psychological distress (total score 0–24). We used the Japanese versions of the EPDS ( Okano et al., 1996 ) and K6 ( Furukawa et al., 2008 ) in this study.
The secondary outcomes were EPDS score for postpartum depression, its subscale scores for anxiety, depression, and anhedonia , and K6 score for psychological distress (moderate or severe). For the EPDS, postpartum depression was defined as a total score of 9 or higher ( Okano et al., 1996 ; Yamashita et al., 2000 ). The Japanese version of the EPDS has a three-factor structure of anxiety, depression, and anhedonia ( Matsumura et al., 2020 ) consistent with the original EPDS ( Coates et al., 2017 ; King, 2012 ; Tuohy and McVey, 2008 ). Therefore, using this 3-factor structure, we defined the sum of the relevant items as the EPDS subscale scores for anxiety (items 3 [self-blame], 4 [anxiety], 5 [fear], and 6 [difficulty coping]), depression (items 7 [difficulty sleeping], 9 [crying], and 10 [self-harm]), and anhedonia (reversed items 1 [laughing] and 2 [enjoyment]). For the K6, moderate psychological distress was defined as a total score of 5–12 and severe psychological distress as a score of 13 or higher ( Furukawa et al., 2008 ; Sakurai et al., 2011 ).
Based on theory and the literature, variables likely affecting both pet ownership and mothers' mental health were defined as potential confounders and included the following: maternal age (<25, 25–<30, 30–<35, or ≥ 35 years); body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy (<18.5, 18.5–<25, or ≥ 25); years of education (≤12, >12–<16, or ≥ 16 years); working status (yes or no); annual household income (<4, 4–<6, or ≥ 6 million yen); smoking status (never, former, or current); alcohol intake (never, former, or current) as measured by the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ: Sasaki et al., 2003 ; Yokoyama et al., 2016 ); parity (primiparous or multiparous); marital status (married or single); living with the mother's parent(s) (yes or no); living with the father's parent(s) (yes or no); stressful event in the past year (yes or no); intimate partner violence (yes or no); negative attitude toward pregnancy (yes or no); psychiatric history of depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia (yes or no); history of allergy (yes or no); and physical activity (tertile 1 to 3) as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ: Craig et al., 2003 ; Murase et al., 2002 ). The variables were categorized according to standard medical practice, common practice in Japan, or the results of previous studies ( Hamazaki et al., 2020 ; Matsumura et al., 2021 ).
The exposure variable was pet ownership status during pregnancy: none, dog(s) only, cat(s) only, and both. Generalized linear regression models, with the binomial or negative binomial set as a distribution, were used to calculate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (cORs and aORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary outcomes and the subscores for the secondary outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the cORs and aORs and their 95% CIs for cases of postpartum depression. In particular, multinominal logistic regression analysis was used for the ordinal cases of psychological distress (0, none; 1, moderate distress; 2, severe distress). In each analysis, the group without pet ownership was set as the reference.
To control the occurrence of type I error due to multiple primary outcomes, Bonferroni correction was applied corresponding to the four primary outcomes (two each for EPDS and K6). Thus, the 95% CIs for the primary outcomes correspond to the 98.75% (=100–5/4) CIs before Bonferroni correction. This correction was applied to only the primary outcomes and not the secondary outcomes, which were calculated from the respective total scores.
All analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc.) and R (version 4.0.5; R Core Team).
Effective response rates in the second/third trimester and at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year postpartum were 98.2% (n = 92,204/93,852), 97.6% (n = 91,624), 92.8% (n = 87,119), and 90.2% (n = 84,677), respectively.
For all 93,852 pregnancies, the missing data rate was ≤2.5% for most possible confounders, with the exceptions of smoking status (2.6%; n = 2428), physical activity (3.2%; n = 3024), working status (4.6%; n = 4353), and annual household income (8.9%; n = 8324).

Section: 5. Results

Data for 80,814 mothers were analyzed. The mothers had mean age ± standard deviation (SD) of 30.9 ± 4.93 years and mean BMI ± SD before pregnancy of 21.2 ± 3.27 kg/m 2 . Among them, 43.4% were primiparas, 96.1% were married, and 23.0% had an undergraduate degree. Pet ownership status was none in 82.2% of the participants (n = 66,468), dog(s) only in 11.1% (n = 8958), cat(s) only in 5.1% (n = 4093), and both in 1.6% (n = 1295). Compared with the overall sample (N = 80,814), the mothers who were excluded from the analysis (n = 11,390) tended to be younger, single, experience intimate partner violence, be outside the normal range of pre-pregnancy BMI , and live with the father's parent(s) (all p < 0.001).
The details of the participants’ characteristics by pet ownership status are presented in Table 1 . Owning a pet was associated with most of the potential confounders (all p < 0.001) as well as alcohol intake ( p = 0.015), but not working status ( p = 0.298). Table 1 .

In terms of the primary outcomes, the total scores of the EPDS and K6, cORs, and aORs with their 95% CIs by pet ownership status are summarized in Table 2 . EPDS and K6 scores were correlated, with correlation coefficients between 0.48 and 0.61. Dog ownership was inversely associated with EPDS total score at 1 month postpartum (aOR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95–0.98) and 6 months postpartum (aOR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96–0.99) and with K6 total score at 12 months postpartum (aOR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92–0.999). In contrast, cat ownership was associated with EPDS total score at 6 months postpartum (aOR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02–1.06) and with K6 total score in the second/third trimester (aOR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02–1.12). Ownership of both pets was associated with K6 total score in the second/third trimester (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03–1.21). Table 2 .

Section: 6. Discussion

Our analysis obtained three main findings for women in the perinatal or postpartum period . First, dog ownership was associated with reduced risk of mental health problems. Second, cat ownership was associated with increased risk of mental health problems. Third, any pet ownership was associated with increased risk of mental health problems in crude models.
The first finding is in agreement with the other reported benefits of keeping dogs as pets. These benefits include decreased loneliness ( Wells, 2019 ; Zasloff and Kidd, 1994 ), increased self-esteem ( Schulz et al., 2020 ), and reduced sympathetic activity during mental stress ( Allen et al., 2002 ). These positive effects might be related to dogs’ ability to use human social-communicative cues ( Hare and Tomasello, 2005 ; Nagasawa et al., 2015 ). The convergence of these benefits might be responsible for the reduced all-cause mortality in dog owners ( Kramer et al., 2019 ). A recent study examining over 844 ethnographers in 144 cultures revealed a strong human–dog social bond and reciprocal benefit between humans and dogs, especially in women ( Chambers et al., 2020 ). Against the background of dog domestication in Siberia during the last glacial period about 23,000 years ago ( Lahtinen et al., 2021 ; Perri et al., 2021 ), dogs and humans might have coevolved to yield benefits in both species, including human mental health.
The exact mechanism underlying the second finding of increased risk of mental health problems with cat ownership is unknown. While some researchers have shown that human–cat attachment is as high as human–dog attachment ( Vitale et al., 2019 ), others have shown that cat owners’ self-esteem is lower than that of dog owners ( Schulz et al., 2020 ). In contrast to dogs, cats have a shorter history of living with humans: they began to live with humans in two ways, one traced to about 4400 years BC and the other to about 1500 years BC, and have undergone minimal genetic change ( Ottoni et al., 2017 ). Thus, the coevolution degree is not yet mature enough to produce wide-ranging benefits in humans. Besides mental health issues, women who live with a cat can be exposed to another problem, toxoplasmosis . Toxoplasma is a parasite causing an infectious disease that can result in miscarriage, infant anomaly, or brain disorder. A recent study examining 13,725 adults with 18 years of follow-up revealed a 2.85 times higher lung cancer mortality rate in women with a cat than in women with no pets ( Adhikari et al., 2019 ). Incidentally, the risk was 1.01 times for dogs and 2.67 times for birds. This risk might be due to the thinner fur of cats and thinner feather fibers of birds compared with the fur of dogs. Thus, cat ownership is likely riskier than dog ownership or non-pet ownership.
The results from the crude models were quite different to those from the adjusted models. This difference is highly likely to be due to background differences associated with perinatal/postpartum mental health ( Beck, 2001 ; Biaggi et al., 2016 ; Robertson et al., 2004 ). As shown in Table 1 , pet ownership, regardless of status, was associated with known risk factors for postpartum depression, such as a lower marital rate, fewer years of education, higher smoking status, and history of psychiatric disease. Such background differences according to pet ownership have been observed in other studies ( Purewal et al., 2019 ; Saunders et al., 2017 ). The adjusted model analysis made these background differences constant. In other words, the analysis statistically canceled out the effects of these confounders and thus enabled appropriate effect estimates. The apparent association has tended to be detected in studies with large sample sizes ( Enmarker et al., 2015 ; Ikeuchi et al., 2021 ). However, the most important aspect might be adjustment using appropriate covariates rather than a large sample size. Because it is difficult to conduct randomized control trials in this research area ( Powell et al., 2019 ), we are forced to rely on the findings of observational studies . Therefore, the types of potential confounders used are critical.
The anxiety, depression, and anhedonia subscales of the EPDS showed a stable and specific pattern in dogs and cats. In descending order by the strength of the relationship, dog ownership was associated with reduced risks of anhedonia and anxiety symptoms in postpartum depression, while cat ownership was associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms. Few studies have examined the symptoms of postpartum depression using subscales to date ( Takehara et al., 2018 ), and the present associations might be the first to be reported on pet ownership. For example, fewer years of education has been linked to increased risks of depression, anhedonia, and anxiety symptoms ( Matsumura et al., 2019 ). Because anhedonia plays a role in recurrent cardiovascular events ( Davidson et al., 2010 ), reduced mortality rate after a major cardiovascular event observed in dog owners ( Mubanga et al., 2019 ) might be via reduced anhedonia. In contrast, given that the depression subscale included a self-harm item and the leading cause of maternal death is suicide ( Austin et al., 2007 ; Lindahl et al., 2005 ), special attention needs to be paid to the increased risk of depressive symptoms in cat owners.
The strengths of this study are that, first, we analyzed data from a sample of over 80,000 mothers participating in an ongoing nationwide birth cohort. This large sample size helped to detect differences in prevalence of less than 3%. Second, we recruited the participants from 15 regions in Japan, including urban and rural areas. Therefore, the sample was representative of recent Japanese mothers. Third, we followed expectant mothers from early pregnancy to 1 year after childbirth , with a relatively high response rate maintained even at 1 year postpartum (90.2%). Consequently, selection bias caused by loss to follow-up was kept to a minimum.
This study also has several limitations. First, we examined pet ownership during the second/third trimester. However, we examined it only at a single time point during pregnancy and considered only in the type of pet (cat or dog) and not the number of pets owned. Also, we did not ask the participants how burdensome taking care of their pet(s) was or whether they would like to have pets. Thus, further studies considering these aspects will be necessary. Second, we evaluated postpartum depression using self-administered questionnaires. Accordingly, the prevalence may have been overestimated compared with that obtained using clinical diagnostic criteria ( Woody et al., 2017 ). Third, as mentioned above, the background of pet ownership can vary by country. Thus, although we adjusted the association using multiple potential confounders, the generalizability of the present findings to other countries may be low. Fourth, the present work was based on relatively new cohort data, with recruitment occurring between January 2011 and March 2014. However, it has been reported that cat ownership has exceeded dog ownership since 2017 in Japan ( INTAGE Inc., 2021 ). Thus, our findings may not be fully applicable to the situation in Japan today. Fifth, the observed association was relatively weak; most of the aORs fall between 0.92 and 1.17. Finally, even in large-scale observational studies such as this, it is virtually impossible to control for all confounders and reach a causal conclusion. Therefore, the observed relationships do not necessarily mean that acquiring a dog will prevent mothers from developing postpartum depression or psychological distress. For example, we cannot rule out the possibility that expectant mothers with poor mental health tend not to have dogs but tend to have cats.
With these limitations in mind, this study revealed that dog ownership was a protective factor and cat ownership was a risk factor for postpartum depression or psychological distress. These findings suggest that the type of pet owned plays a differential role in maintaining sound mental health in mothers around the birth of their children.
