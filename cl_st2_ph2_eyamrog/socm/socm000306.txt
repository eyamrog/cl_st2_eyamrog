Title: The inverse care law and the significance of income for utilization of longterm care services in a Nordic welfare state


Abstract: Abstract

The Inverse Care Law states that the availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served, with previous research indicating that migrant populations might be particularly at risk of this phenomenon. However, the degree to which the law applies to long-term care services (LTCS) in diverse ageing societies , where sizable older migrant populations need to be accounted for, has not been well investigated. To ensure equitable service provision, and to achieve European goals promoting a social right to care, it is critical to assess the extent to which such diverse populations are being neglected. This paper investigates the relationship between income and utilization of LTCS in Sweden amongst older native-born residents and older migrants born in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The universality of its welfare system and the documented income differentials between foreign- and Swedish-born persons makes Sweden a particularly interesting case for assessing whether the most disadvantaged are the most underserved. The analysis uses register data on a total population of all older residents in Sweden, encompassing approximately two million persons. The results indicate that the Inverse Care Law does not apply to the utilization of LTCS by Swedish-born older people, nor by the majority of older migrants. However, the Inverse Care Law does appear to operate for older persons born in low-income countries who do not have a partner.

Section: 1. Introduction

Several decades ago, Tudor Hart identified significant social and geographical inequalities in mortality and morbidity rates in Britain, despite the availability of free medical services to all British citizens through the National Health Service (NHS) ( Hart, 1971 ). Hart's central thesis, termed the Inverse Care Law, stated that the availability of proper medical care varies inversely with the need (i.e. financial, and health) of the population served. Hart suggested that even in universal systems, where supposedly unlimited service coverage is provided, vast social inequalities and differences in the quality of health care resources can endure ( Hart, 1971 ). While an extensive body of work has examined this phenomenon for general health and primary care service provision (e.g. Almeida et al., 2017 ; Kirby and Kaneda, 2005 , 2006 ), there is far less evidence concerning the validity of the Inverse Care law for long-term care services (LTCS) for older populations.
Albeit not consistent across all studies, the limited research that is available (e.g. García-Gómez et al., 2015 ) suggests that care services can indeed be concentrated amongst the better-off. However, studies on this topic have failed to sufficiently investigate the extent to which such circumstances apply to diverse ageing societies with sizable migrant populations, where higher levels of inequality can be evident ( Gustafsson et al., 2019 ). This is despite the prevalence of difficulties that general migrant populations encounter in accessing care ( Ahaddour et al., 2016 ), and previous research indicating that foreign-born older persons can experience a higher risk of poverty ( Gustafsson et al., 2019 ).
This paper assesses the degree to which the Inverse Care Law applies to the utilization of any form of LTCS by a diverse older population. To do so, it draws on register data with nearly two million observations to investigate the relationship between income and the utilization of LTCS among native-born older adults and older persons born in low-, middle- and high-income countries, in Sweden. To detect factors that contribute to an unequal distribution of LTCS, it is essential to see whether lower-income groups of foreign-born persons utilize LTCS to the same extent as people born in Sweden. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to assess the relevance of the Inverse Care Law to LTCS utilization for a total older population within a national jurisdiction.
The universal nature of the Swedish welfare state, an increasing foreign-born older population, and evidence of rising socioeconomic inequalities between foreign-born and Swedish-born persons ( Gustafsson et al., 2019 ) make Sweden a particularly interesting case for assessing whether the most disadvantaged are the most underserved. Among European nations, Sweden has one of the highest proportions of older people receiving LTCS and the most extensive range of universal service provision in the sector ( Boerma et al., 2012 ). Despite this, barriers around affordability have been documented in Sweden for the general older population ( Szebehely, 2000 ). Although not well explored, these barriers are likely to be intensified for those who experience financial challenges, with foreign-born older persons in Sweden often more susceptible to economic insecurity. For instance, a person who is born in a low-income country, and who migrates at 40 years of age or over, runs a 33-times higher risk of being poor in later life relative to a Swedish born older person ( Gustafsson et al., 2019 ).
This paper begins with a short description of the Swedish long-term care system. Previous research on LTCS, the Inverse Care Law and older migrants is then outlined. This is followed by a description of data and methods. The results of the analysis are then presented, and the paper closes with a discussion of the main findings in relation to the international literature, and the implications for policy and future work.
In Sweden, persons aged 65 years and older can apply to access LTCS from municipalities. LTCS, which can be either be provided free of charge or for a fee based on an individual's income, incorporate three principal strands. These include: (1) home supports in the form of help with domestic chores (such as household tasks) and personal care (such as getting dressed and personal hygiene); (2) a series of ancillary services that assist in keeping older people living in their communities (e.g. respite care for carers, meals on wheels, safety alarms, day-care centers, and mobility assistance); and (3) residential care , where support can be provided full-time by care professionals in residential facilities. Case managers within each municipality, usually social workers, assess the care needs of older persons under the Social Services Act, which stipulates that municipalities in Sweden are obliged to meet the care needs of the ageing population.
Sweden, like many other European countries, has seen a substantial reduction in the public provision of LTCS to older persons in recent decades. This is suggested to have affected the utilization of LTCS by even the general older population ( Dahlberg et al., 2018 ). Cuts in LTCS have as such led to higher levels of responsibility for care provision being shifted to informal caregivers ( Sand, 2007 , 2012 ). These structural changes mean that LTCS may be less accessible for some groups of older people, with access issues likely to be more pronounced for those with lower incomes, and foreign-born persons who may already face significant barriers in accessing LTCS ( Ahaddour et al., 2016 ).

Section: 2. Literature review

Several research studies already suggest that higher income groups are more likely to use LTCS ( Konetzka and Werner, 2009 ), indicating the potential relevance of the Inverse Care Law for the long-term care sector. This is true for European and international contexts, where demographic ageing has meant that the provision of adequate levels of LTCS can be a growing public policy challenge ( Torres and Lawrence, 2012 ). For example, García-Gómez et al. (2015) used survey data from a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized-disabled population in Spain to examine the determinants of LTCS usage and the prevalence of unmet care needs. Their analysis confirmed that formal LTCS were concentrated among the financially better-off, while informal care was concentrated among poorer sections of the older population. However, other analyses have highlighted inconsistencies in observed trends, with a number of studies reporting no clear relationship between income and the utilization of LTCS (e.g. Gilmour, 2018 ).
There are also a number of limitations concerning our extant research knowledge on LTCS and the Inverse Care Law. First, and aside from national reports documenting lack of access to LTCS due to issues of affordability more than two decades ago ( Szebehely, 2000 ), research on this topic in the Swedish context has received little attention. Second, the definition of LTCS tends to vary across studies, and where consistency is observed there is typically a narrower focus on home care services (e.g. Goodridge et al., 2012 ). This compromises our ability to assess the extent to which the Law applies to the full range of LTCS within a given jurisdiction. Third, the vast majority of work on this topic is based upon representative survey samples and secondary data analyses, which fail to capture the full prevalence of the phenomenon for the entire older population. Critically, given the lack of coverage of diverse population groups within such surveys, these studies may also underrepresent the circumstances of diverse and marginalized sub-groups of older people ( Ahaddour et al., 2016 ). Fourth, and of central concern to this paper, existing work has not interrogated the relevance of the Inverse Care Law for foreign-born older populations, relative to native-born residents ( Goodridge et al., 2012 ).
Notwithstanding these limitations, research on older adult long-term care in general has identified three primary factors that may influence the utilization of LTCS for older people. Health status, together with age, as might be expected, is regarded as the most significant factor influencing LTCS use ( Kempen and Suurmeijer, 1991 ). Some studies argue that older migrants are in better health than native-born citizens, claiming a healthy migrant effect where only those in good health have made the journey (e.g. Ali et al., 2004 ; Mohanty et al., 2005 ; Goldman et al., 2006 ). Other studies have, however, suggested the opposite ( Schellingerhout, 2004 ; Gerritsen et al., 2006 ; Denktas, 2011). If lower utilization of LTCS is observed and is due to better health among older migrants, then differences in levels of usage are not problematic. However, if older migrants have poorer health and still use less care services, this may indicate unmet need and the operation of the Inverse Care Law.
Income is another central factor that has been shown to influence older people's access to LTCS ( Szebehely, 2000 ). We assume that being at higher risk of poverty may increase the likelihood of a lower utilization of LTCS and may, therefore, constitute a higher risk for not utilizing care among older foreign-born persons. The financial situation of older migrants may also be mediated through a number of other salient factors. Living alone may indicate a lower income level amongst some individuals, limiting their financial capacity to use LTCS. Similarly, length of residence in a host country ( Hansen, 2014 ), and timing or age of migration can influence opportunities to accumulate financial resources. A shorter residence duration and migration at older ages have been linked to a greater risk of income poverty ( Mac Innes, 2020 ; Gustafsson et al., 2019 ). Age at migration has also been shown to be related to the likelihood of LTCS utilization, with recent findings from Sweden indicating that those migrating at older ages (45 years and over) were less likely to use LTCS ( Mac Innes, 2020 ).
Finally, education levels have been associated with LTCS use for both Swedish- and foreign-born populations. While education might exert an influence over LTCS utilization in multiple different ways, higher levels are associated with greater knowledge of how to access rights, entitlements and supports. ( Ahaddour et al., 2016 ; Ulmanen and Szebehely, 2015 ). As a larger share of older foreign-born persons in Sweden possess lower educational levels than native-born citizens (Gustafsson et al., 2017), this disadvantage may combine with language barriers to reinforce the sort of patterns espoused by the Inverse Care Law.
Within the general literature on LTCS, there have also been a number of other barriers identified that are specific to older migrants' use of long-term care. For instance, difficulties in accessing formal care services and navigating the related bureaucracy may arise from older people's lack of familiarity with the host country care system. Negative experiences of health and social care authorities in home countries may also lessen the likelihood of some older migrants applying for formal care services in host nations (Kilkey and Merla, 2014).
The cultural preferences of older migrants can also have an important role in determining the levels of utilization of formal care, acting as both a barrier to and a driver of service use ( Stanciole and Huber, 2009 ; Hurley et al., 2012 ; Lai and Surood, 2013 ; Ahaddour et al., 2016 ; Karl et al., 2017 ). Older people's relatives may have a particular desire, rooted in cultural values and norms, to provide care themselves without involving formal services (Forsell, 2004). Previous work has argued that the motivation to choose informal care, or ‘cash for care’ schemes that allow older people to hire members of their own family or community as caregivers, arises when care is neither offered in the person's native language or in a culturally appropriate manner ( Songur, 2009 ). In such instances, a low level of use of formal care services is unlikely to reflect unmet needs. However, it is possible that even in these circumstances, older migrants may not receive sufficient levels of care, and informal caregivers may experience high levels of carer burden ( Bonsang, 2009 ). In this respect, culturally-based preferences may disguise complex challenges ( Ronzio et al., 2004 ). Evidence indicates that formal care coordinators and providers may also assume that relatives of older migrants are more likely to perform unpaid care work due to assumptions around cultural preferences. This can create additional barriers, more discretionary in nature, that limit LTCS use for these groups ( Brodin, 2018 ).
Data were obtained for the entire population resident in Sweden aged 65 years and over from several registers at Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data from these sources were merged after ethical approval had been received from the ethics committee (1065–16). All people registered as residing in Sweden on the December 31, 2015 and aged 65 years and older are included in the data. This equates to over two million observations. Individuals currently seeking asylum while living in Sweden are not included in the population statistics, as they must have a residence permit valid for at least twelve months before being included in these registers. With this exception, this study is based on the entire older population in Sweden.
Our primary focus is the relationship between disposable income per consumption unit and utilization of LTCS among Swedish- and foreign-born older persons . To be able to account for other sources of variation between these two groups, we estimate multivariate regression models. We use logistic regression where the receipt of LTCS or not is denoted as the dependent variable.
Previous work has shown that although foreign-born older persons are less likely than native-born citizens to use LTCS in Sweden, there is significant heterogeneity across birth countries ( Mac Innes, 2020 ). We therefore assume that the significance of the covariates controlled for in the model will vary depending on whether the person is born in Sweden or not, and whether the person is living alone or together with a partner. On this basis, we run separate models for those who are foreign and Swedish-born and for those who have a partner, and for those who do not. In the first two models, we study the likelihood of LTCS among older foreign-born persons (in low-, middle-, and high-income countries), who have a partner (model 1) and for those who do not have a partner (model 2). In the second two models, we investigate the likelihood of LTCS among Swedish-born older persons who have a partner (model 3), and for those who do not (model 4).
In the models, we control for several independent variables. Firstly, we estimate the contribution of covariates, such as age and gender, to the LTCS use variance. Data for gender and age come from the Swedish Total Population Register. Gender includes two dummy variables, corresponding to men and women. The age variable is classified into six dummies (65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, and 90 years or older). Educational level is also controlled for in the analysis. Information on educational level derives from the Swedish education register, which includes detailed administrative records on education obtained outside as well as inside of Sweden. Educational level is missing for about eight per cent of all foreign-born older persons, which compares with about one per cent of Swedish-born persons. We therefore have to interpret this variable with caution. The educational level consists of four dummy variables (including one indicating that no education information is available). As challenges in accessing LTCS may be more significant for people migrating in older age, age at migration was included as a control variable.
To measure some aspect of care need, data from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register at the National Board of Health and Welfare was used to indicate the number of dispensed medicines that a person receives. The Swedish Prescribed Drug Register comprises data on all prescriptions dispensed to the population in Sweden and includes information on the item, date of the order and dispensing, dosage and drug cost. We created a variable measuring the number of medicines dispensed for inclusion in the model, with the number of drug withdrawals categorized in five dummies (less than 9, 10–19, 20–34, 35–64, and greater than 65). It should be noted that when making predictions based on the estimates from our model, we saw that having 65 or more dispensed medicines a year was associated with a substantially higher likelihood of residential care .
To assess the likelihood of having any type of LTCS, we use information from the Swedish Register of Social Services for older persons and persons with disabilities. The registry is also sourced from the National Board of Health and Welfare. The data allows for distinctions to be made between community care and residential care. However, as the overall aim of this analysis was to investigate the extent to which older persons have or do not have contact with the public long term care system in Sweden, we choose to create a variable including all available types of LTCS offered by a municipality (e.g. safety alarms, meals on wheels, personal and domestic care, and residential care). It should be noted that before deciding to use just one variable for receipt of all LTCS, two different models for residential care and community care were constructed, as care preferences may differ across population groups for different types of care. The results showed minimal differences between these models and those using the combined variable of any type of care, indicating we were losing little in the way of explanatory power by employing a single LTCS variable.
To study the direct relationship between income and utilization of LTCS, we interact country of birth, separated into GDP group (1–3), 1 with disposable income. As there were not enough observations among some birth countries, the ten income deciles were categorized into five groups (decile one, decile two, decile three, decile four to seven and decile eight to ten). Data on disposable income comes from the Swedish Register of Income and Tax Assessments (IoT). This register contains information derived from the tax authority and all public transfers to households, but untaxed income is also included, such as old-age support. Household disposable income per consumption unit is measured (net of income taxes) by summing the income of all adult household members. We then adjust the disposable income according to an equivalence scale used by Statistics Sweden. 2
Before detailing the logistic regression results, we will first present descriptive statistics concerning the distribution of LTCS and care need by income deciles. As has been stated previously, we expect older persons with poorer health to have more extensive care needs. In a society such as Sweden, with universal care provision, it could be assumed that everyone will have the same access to LTCS regardless of income. However, as previously discussed, there have been indications in the Swedish context that older persons may sometimes refrain from applying for care due to issues with affordability ( Szebehely, 2000 ).
With reference to Fig. 1 , a substantial difference in the use of LTCS is evident when comparing the second and the ninth income decile (23 percentage points). One possible explanation for this difference is the documented relationship between low income and poor health, meaning that we can expect older persons in lower-income groups to be in poorer. Health and therefore to have higher utilization of LTCS. However, the percentage share in decile one is smaller than in decile two. These results could be interpreted as indicating less access to LTCS, and therefore as supporting the Inverse Care Law. Observing the curve, we also find that there is an increase in the percentage share of LTCS utilization when comparing decile nine and decile ten. This may also be an indication of an unequal distribution. Download: Download high-res image (152KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 . Distribution of LTCS per income decile.
Concerning the distribution of dispensed medicines across income deciles for Swedish and foreign-born respondents, we assume that we will find a larger share of dispensed medicines among older persons in lower-income groups. With reference to Fig. 2 , and as expected, we find that the number of dispensed medications increases with lower income, suggesting clear indications of health disparities between lower- and higher-income groups. Most. Striking is that up to one in three persons belonging to the lower-income groups are receiving 65 medications or more per year, compared with one in ten belonging to the highest income deciles, suggesting that health disparities are substantial. It is also striking that the share of less than nine dispensed medicines is larger for the lowest income decile. A possible explanation for this is that lower-income groups refrain from seeking health care to a greater extent. Westin et al. (2004) found that foreign-born women and those with a low level of education refrained from attending a physician to a greater degree than men, native-born citizens, and those with a higher level of education. Reasons for this pattern included issues of trust, limited availability of services and a lack of financial resources ( Westin et al., 2004 ). Similar findings were identified by Linné et al. (2014) , who investigated reasons for the non-participation of older men in an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm screening program in Stockholm. Findings showed that the most common reasons for non-participation were recent immigration (within five years); low income; being single or divorced; low levels of education; and long distances to travel to access screening. Hence, we may argue that the smaller number of medicines in the first income decile might also be an indication of the Inverse Care Law in operation.

We now turn to the logistic regression models to explore whether the patterns detected in the descriptive statistics still hold after controlling for covariates.
In relation to models 1 and 2, where we study the likelihood of LTCS among older foreign-born persons for those who have a partner (model 1) and for those who do not (model 2), we can first draw out some general results. With reference to Table 1 , we find that receiving less than nine drugs per year means a lower likelihood of using LTCS, when compared with receiving more than 65 medicines per year. As expected, there is also a steady increase in the likelihood of LTCS with increasing age . Notably, level of education seems to be less critical. Further, we see that living in one of the three biggest cities in Sweden (see Gothenburg) represents a higher likelihood of receiving LTCS, than living in a medium sized city. In models 3 and 4, we investigate the likelihood of LTCS among Swedish-born older persons for those who have a partner (model 3) and for those who do not (model 4). We can observe from Table 2 that the likelihood of using LTCS increases with the number of medicines withdrawn and with increased age. Level of education seems to be less critical for those who have a partner compared with those who do not have a partner. Table 1 .

In order to isolate the influence of individual properties, the likelihood of receiving LTCS care is calculated for an individual with a given number of characteristics. Predictions based on the estimates have been calculated for a woman aged 85–89 years (the most common age for receiving LTCS), living without a partner in Gothenburg (one of the three biggest cities in Sweden), who has a low level of education, and who receives 35–68 dispensed medicines. The following formula has been used to calculate the predictions from the model, where Y stands for whether the person is in receipt of LTCS, b signifies the coefficients in the model and x = the independent variables. Prob(Y = 1) = eβ′x1 + eβ′x
First, concentrating on those without a partner, Fig. 3 Illustrates the likelihood of LTCS for the selected individual. When we have controlled for all covariates, including health, we would expect the same level of likelihood regarding utilization of LTCS, or a higher probability for the lower-income groups. For Swedish-born, and older persons born in a high-income country, the likelihood of receiving LTC is almost the same regardless of income group, leading us to assume that there is equal utilization of LTCS for these groups, with the exception of the highest income groups. This suggests that the universal care system seems to work for older persons born in Sweden and in other high-income countries. There are several possible explanations for the shared patterns observed across Swedish-born and older persons born in high-income countries. A substantial portion of this migrant group were born in other Nordic nations. As the welfare systems in Nordic countries mirror each other to a large degree, this may enhance the ability of older people from these nations to navigate the formal care system in Sweden, ensuring adequate utilization to LTCS. Also, we can assume that language barriers may be less of a problem for these individuals given linguistic commonalities and some shared phrasing.

We now turn to older persons born in low- and middle-income countries who do not have a partner. The likelihood of utilizing LTCS is lower for older persons in income decile one. Compared to decile two. However, the value is only statistically significant for older adults without a partner, born in low-income countries, in decile one. This would suggest that the Inverse Care Law may be operational for older persons born in low- and middle-income. Countries who do not have a partner.
Next, we examine the extent to which the Inverse Care Law applies for those having a partner.
Fig. 4 Illustrates that after controlling for all covariates, the overall likelihood for LTCS is considerably lower for those having a partner in comparison to those not having a partner. It is well-known that the share of informal care provision in Sweden is extensive, making up about 70 per cent of all care delivered to older persons in the country ( Sundström et al., 2002 ). It has been argued that this is the result of cuts in public provision and a greater emphasis on the informalisation of care, where informal care is increasingly substituting formal care services ( Sand, 2012 ). However, other studies find little support for such a substitutional relationship in Sweden (Davey et al., 2006), and currently, there is little evidence as to the extent to which substitution is or is not occurring.

Source: Table 1 and Table.
When considering older persons born in high- and middle-income countries (having a partner), we see that the likelihood for LTCS decreases for decile one compared with decile two. We also see that the likelihood for LTCS increases for decile one compared to decile two for older persons born in low-income countries. However, the difference between decile one and decile two is not statistically significant for Sweden or any of the country groups (low-, middle- and high-income countries). This suggests that the universal care system seems to work for older persons who have a partner and who are born in Sweden and other high-income countries.
In sum, the results of this study indicate that the Inverse Care Law does not apply to LTCS utilization for Swedish-born older people and for the majority of older migrants from low, middle and high-income countries, in Sweden. However, the results do indicate that the universal welfare system may not sufficiently support equitable LTCS utilization for older persons born in low-income countries who do not have a partner.

Section: 3. Discussion

This paper investigated the relationship between income and LTCS utilization among Swedish- and foreign-born older persons. The supposed nature of Sweden as a universal welfare state, in combination with the income differential between foreign-born and Swedish older populations ( Gustafsson et al., 2019 ), meant that Sweden was a particularly valuable case for this analysis.

Section: 4. Limitations

It is important to acknowledge that there are several limitations to this work. First, while the available data allows us to assess whether a person is living with or without a partner, it does not allow us to determine if they are living alone. Second, it is unlikely that an indicator on the number of medicines dispensed fully captures health care needs for this population. The indicator does not measure actual or self-reported aspects of health, compromising our capacity to represent health status. It is also acknowledged that as there may be an underrepresentation of older foreign-born persons in the withdrawal and use of medicines ( Westin et al., 2004 ), particularly those from lower-income deciles, and such a measure may not accurately reflect all older migrants who are in poor health. Nevertheless, this indicator is more likely to capture a broad spectrum of low to high levels of care need than alternative options available within the registry data set (e.g. number of inpatient hospital days). Third, our study is cross-sectional and we can, therefore, not provide insight into the dynamics of the relationship between income and LTCS utilization in older age. A longitudinal analysis would facilitate a more nuanced understanding of how changes in income, care needs and possible levels of integration might intersect to determine LTCS utilization. Third, and finally, we cannot determine with any certainty the extent to which our findings reflect unmet care needs (or if informal care is chosen as a substitute for LTCS) due to the limitations of the sort of information recorded in registries. This means we cannot attribute these patterns to particular sets of inequities. However, and despite these limitations, we argue that this study provides a number of valuable insights.
Our findings indicate that the universal welfare system in Sweden works for the majority of the older migrant population. From our analysis, there is no evidence to suggest that the Inverse Care Law applies to Swedish-born older persons and their utilization of LTCS. This is in contrast to what may have been expected given earlier reports of difficulties in affording such services ( Szebehely, 2000 ), but yet is in line with the assumed universality of service provision within the Swedish welfare system. The system also seems to work relatively well for older foreign-born persons. However, results show that the Inverse Care Law may be operational for older persons born in low-income countries who do not have a partner. How are we to understand the lower likelihood of using LTCS among this group? There are a number of potential reasons that can be identified from previous studies within the international literature, some which relate to drivers of inequalities, and thus unmet care need, while others relate to potential variance in care preferences.
Differences in health-seeking behavior, where older foreign-born persons generally use health care services to a lower extent across older populations, may explain the lower utilization of LTCS ( Westin et al., 2004 ). On one hand, this may reflect personal and cultural preferences concerning the balance between formal and informal care provision (Forsell, 2004). Research on this topic has demonstrated how familial and cultural norms can underlie the choices of some older migrants to be cared for by members of their own household, their immediate family or friends and neighbors within their cultural community ( Ahaddour et al., 2016 ). Work has shown that some older adults and their families in these communities can, in particular, place a heavy emphasis on care being delivered at home and within multigenerational households (ibid). However, even where informal care is preferred and provided by family and informal sources, previous studies have shown the potential for older migrants to receive insufficient levels of care or inappropriate forms of care. In these cases, care preferences can work in combination with low expectations regarding formal supports to mask unmet needs ( Bonsang, 2009 ). On the other hand, a lower level of utilization of LTCS may also relate to an older migrant's knowledge of the formal care service system. In combination with language proficiency issues, knowledge deficits may impede and intensify difficulties related to the utilization of LTCS for the poorest sections of this population ( Ahaddour et al., 2016 ). For instance, LTCS may be considered generally unaffordable if it was not known that fees were significantly reduced or removed altogether for those on lower income. In Sweden, older persons with low income may be granted income support; the Swedish Pensions Agency mediates this transfer. Anecdotal evidence from municipality case managers, who assess care needs and facilitate care access, suggests that there is sometimes a lack of awareness of this type of transfer among these groups. Similarly, older migrants living in more impoverished areas can lack the social and familial supports to help facilitate and negotiate contact with the formal care system, such as helping to arrange meetings with a case manager. Where this is the case, there may be significant levels of unmet care needs that are neither addressed by informal supports nor formal provisions.
Potential explanations may also relate to direct exchanges between older migrants and formal long-term care professionals and service coordinators. There is an established relationship between poverty and low trust in formal administrative systems and authorities ( Haushofer, 2013 ). Findings from Westin et al. (2004) indicate that residents in deprived districts, often those with higher proportions of migrant populations, are more likely to be skeptical of official public service providers compared to residents in more affluent areas – thus dissuading them from engaging with the formal system. However, research has yet to investigate the extent to which low trust in health and social care authorities might be responsible for the lower utilization of LTCS by low-income older foreign-born persons. Finally, and as outlined earlier, the lower levels of LTCS use may also be explained by the higher expectations of some public actors that relatives of older migrants are more likely to perform unpaid care work. In these instances, there may be less emphasis on engaging and supporting these populations in accessing formal care services ( Brodin, 2018 ).

Section: 5. Conclusion

Analysis presented in this paper indicates that the Inverse Care Law does not apply to the utilization of LTCS for Swedish-born older people and for the majority of older migrants born in low-, middle- and high-income in Sweden. However, the results show that the Law maybe operational for older persons born in low-income countries who do not have a partner. Further, the results show a considerably higher likelihood of LTCS use for those who do not have a partner, compared to those who have a partner. This could be an indication of a substitutional effect between formal and informal care. We suggest that further research in this area needs to attend to the poorest sections of the foreign-born older persons, particularly those who do not have a partner. A more concentrated research effort is required to identify whether or not there are unmet care needs among these groups, or if individual members of these populations are choosing not to access LTCS utilization. While there are a number of possible explanations for the patterns we have presented in this paper, this future work is required before we can meaningfully engage with questions regarding suitable policy and practice intervention design and development.
