Title: Supporting family carers of people with dementia: A discrete choice experiment of public preferences


Abstract: Abstract

Community-based care for people with dementia is mainly provided by family carers, many of whom experience decreased mental, physical and financial well-being due to their caring role. Many countries are now implementing ageing-in-place policies that have increased pressure on family carers as care-work is redistributed from residential to community-based settings. Family caring responsibilities for people with dementia are made even more complicated by the economic, social and cultural expectations that underpin existing provision. Support for family carers is, therefore, an important policy topic across many countries. The focus of this paper is on the propensity of citizens to support enhanced care for family carers in Ireland, as demonstrated by their willingness-to-pay additional taxation to fund different combinations of carer support measures, developed through careful and sustained dialogue with multiple stakeholders, especially family carers themselves. We carried out a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with 509 members of the general public in Ireland between January and February 2021. Using mixed logit models, our findings show that citizens value four key attributes: regular caring breaks for family carers (day-care and long-break respite); financial compensation (carer's allowance); and emotional support (carer peer support groups). We also estimated the welfare impact of moving from current provision to enhanced support packages for family carers of people with dementia. The welfare gains accumulate to €1035.80 for the most complete levels of provision across the four support attributes. Overall, respondents in this paper showed empathy and understanding towards family carers of people with dementia through their willingness to contribute to funding additional services and supports.

Section: 1. Introduction

Worldwide, the number of people with dementia is estimated to be 50 million. There are 10 million new cases every year and this figure is set to triple by 2030 ( World Health Organisation, 2019 ). Currently, the majority of community-based care is being provided to people with dementia through informal networks of family members and friends ( Colombo et al., 2011 ; World Health Organisation, 2017 ). It is well recognised that long-term care systems across Europe are reliant on these informal care providers ( Spasova et al., 2018 ) and is estimated that family carers provide over three quarters of the total long-term care to dependent people with and without dementia ( Birtha and Holm, 2017 ). Given ageing demographics , demand and costs for long-term care systems across Europe will continue to rise ( Glendinning, 2018 ). In recent years, the narrative of public policy discourse in Europe, including Ireland, has evolved to support the preferences of people with dementia to remain in their own communities through timely and appropriate ageing-in-place initiatives ( O’Shea et al., 2019 ). Facilitating people with dementia to remain in their own homes is the stated policy aim of the vast majority of Western countries, including Ireland ( Colombo et al., 2011 ; OECD/EU, 2018 ). While the desire to move away from residential long-term settings has been widely welcomed, it is likely that the redistribution of care work from residential to community settings will result in greater care responsibilities for family carers ( Pickard, 2015 ).
While ageing-in-place policies gain momentum in Ireland and elsewhere, actual investment in sustainable long-term care policies lags behind ( Eggers et al., 2020 ). This is especially true for family carers, who are often seen as residual or secondary in the resource allocation process, and any additional supports that are provided to families tend to be guided by the desire to maximise health production for people with dementia. Pickard (2001) referred to this approach to health policy as ‘carer-blind’, in that services and supports tend to favour the dependent person over the needs of carers. In many cases, family carers knowingly prioritise the production of health for people with dementia at the cost of their own health and well-being ( Waligora et al., 2018 ). The negative health effects associated with caring for a person with dementia, include: depression and anxiety; decreased physical health; increased social isolation ( Brennan et al., 2017 ); and increased prevalence of suicidal ideation ( O'Dwyer et al., 2016 ). Overtime, the depletion of family carer's health can potentially result in an overall decrease in the net health of the care dyad ( Miller et al., 2019 ).
The emerging concept of ‘carer proofing’ healthcare decisions reflects increasing consideration of family carer's well-being ( Al-Janabi et al., 2016 ). Although ‘carer proofing’ recognises the dual impact that healthcare decisions have on family carers, we have not been able to identify a similar concept that recognises the wider social disadvantages they experience. This is especially true for carers of people with dementia. Compared to family carers of people without dementia ( Moon and Dilworth-Anderson, 2014 ), family carers of people with dementia experience decreased working hours, more caring-work conflicts, and complete employment cessation ( Neubert et al., 2019 ). Arksey and Morée (2008) highlight that ‘doulia rights’, a carer's right to provide care without the risk of impoverishment, are inadequately protected in Dutch and UK policy for family carers wishing to combine work and care responsibilities. Given restricted pension entitlements and decreased opportunities to accumulate wealth due to their caring role, family carers finances do not tend to recover post-caring ( Craft et al., 2018 ). In addition, care-related out-of-pocket costs for a person with dementia account for approximately a third (32%) of a family's annual household income in the last five years of the person with dementia's life. This figure is nearly three times higher than out-of-pocket expenses for dependent people without dementia (11%) ( Kelley et al., 2015 ).
Research to date has considered the optimal development and delivery of formal services to support ageing-in-place approaches for people in moderate and early stages of dementia ( Walsh et al., 2020 ; Chester et al., 2018 ). While some papers do integrate family carer preferences, the latter is usually directed towards supporting the person with dementia rather than the carer themselves ( Dening et al., 2012 ; Kampanellou et al., 2019 ). There is evidence of public support for increased government investment in family carers in Ireland, covering familial and extra-familial spending ( Citizens' Assembly, 2017 ). However, there is less information on whether public support holds up when citizens are asked to finance their stated preferences through additional taxation. While citizens may sometimes express strong support for introducing various policy initiatives, this support may decrease when they are required to fund new initiatives through additional taxation or voluntary contributions. Previous research has shown that introducing mandatory financial contributions from the public can diminish their preferences for new policy initiatives ( Macleod and Davey Smith, 2003 ). In Ireland social care is generally funded through general taxation. Funding for dependent older people and family carers competes with other budgets in this area. Families often pay an out-of-pocket contribution for specific publicly provided services such as long or short break respite care provision or day-care. Carers support groups are largely provided by voluntary organisations, there is usually no charge for attending. There is also a relatively small private home-care market for people with dementia that is entirely paid out-of-pocket by those who avail of it.
Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study aims to ascertain public preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for services and supports aimed at family carers of people with dementia. The studywill generate information on how the public compare different support packages for family carers, including monetary compensation provisions. While the essential contribution of family carers to long-term care systems throughout Europe is well-recognised, budgetary considerations and societal expectation of familial responsibilities may influence how, or indeed if, citizens are willing-to-pay additional taxation to support family carers. Therefore, the DCE methodology will also shed some light on the perceived role of family carers in modern societies .

Section: 2. Methodology

DCEs are a type of stated preference survey used to understand demands for goods or services when it is not possible to use revealed preference approaches. They are increasingly being used to elicit preferences and anticipate consumer choices in health and long-term care financing ( Walsh et al., 2020 ; Chandoevwit and Wasi, 2020 ; Nieboer et al., 2010 ). The premise of a DCE is that a hypothetical product, such as a service support package for family carers, can be characterised by a series of defining characteristics, commonly referred to as ‘attributes’, and individuals can evaluate the overall desirability of the service package based on these attributes and make trade-offs amongst them. DCEs require participants to state their choice among sets of hypothetical alternatives generated by various combinations of attributes ( Louviere et al., 2011 ).
There is a growing consensus that credible attributes and associated levels for a DCE must be policy relevant, important to the study population, and consistent with the random utility theoretical foundation of DCE ( Coast et al., 2012 ; Coast and Horrocks, 2007 ). Designing the attributes and their associated levels for this DCE was conducted in five stages: 1. Review of national and international documents; 2. family carer and service provider consultation; 3. nominal group technique (NGT) with family carers; 4. pre-pilot interviews; and 5. policy stakeholder review. An outline of this process is provided in Table 1 . Table 1 . Identifying attributes. Stage Process Outcome 1 The first stage of the research identified pre-existing supports developed to support family carers of people with dementia. The generation of the initial list of services and supports, including accompanying description, was guided by national ( National Dementia Office et al., 2016 ) and international literature ( European Social Policy Network, 2018 ). A list of 28 supports and services was compiled. These were categorised under ‘Personal’ and ‘Social’ headings ( Teahan et al., 2021 ). 2 The second stage involved consultation with two family carers of people with dementia and a small number of dementia-specific service providers to assess the comprehensiveness of the list of services generated through stage 1 and the clarity of the accompanying descriptions. One additional support was added to this list under the ‘Personal’ heading. 3 The third stage consisted of three NGT focus groups with 17 family carers of people with dementia. The family carers were asked to rank their top five supports from the comprehensive list generated through stages one and two ( Teahan et al., 2021 ). Their choices were then used to inform preliminary attributes and levels for inclusion in the experiment and the draft questionnaire. Top five supports were ranked under ‘Personal’ and ‘Social’ headings. These included: Day-care, long-break respite, short-break respite, carer peer support group, social activities, Carer's Allowance (non-means-tested), legal status, monthly wage, carer support grant and community awareness. 4 The fourth stage involved identifying which top ranked supports and services would be included as attributes in the DCE. During this stage we considered three key areas ‘risk of overlapping function’; ‘ambiguity’; ‘policy relevance. Levels were then assigned to the attributes based on status quo levels. Ambiguous definition: Legal status; Community Awareness Overlapping function identified: Day-care and short-break respite; Carer's Allowance, monthly wage and Carer's support grant. Higher policy relevance: Day-care; Carer's Allowance Attributes identified: Day-care, long-break respite, carer peer support group, social activities, and Carer's Allowance 5 The fifth stage consisted of ten pre-pilot interviews with members of the general public. During the pre-pilot interviews a think-aloud methodology was applied where respondents were asked to describe the choices they made and their thoughts about the attributes and levels ( Ryan et al., 2009 ). During the first five pre-pilot interviews, respondents were unclear on the ‘social activity’ attribute. An example of a specific social activity ‘Dementia Café’ was included. The remaining five pre-pilot interviews did not highlight any additional issues. 6 The sixth stage involved one-on-one consultations with various stakeholders, including policy-makers, on the proposed final questionnaire. Representatives from Family Carers Ireland, Care Alliance Ireland, the Dementia Research Network Ireland and the National Dementia Office provided feedback on the proposed DCE pilot questionnaire including policy relevance of levels assigned. These representatives provided feedback on the policy relevance of the attributes levels. Policy-makers reported the assigned levels were realistic based on current policy discourse in Ireland.
Five attributes were identified through this iterative process as key components of a support package for family carers of people with dementia: day-care; long-break respite; carers peer support group; carer's allowance; and additional taxation. The NGT process with family carers was particularly helpful in identifying key attributes, based on their ranking of actual and potential services and supports. These recommendations were subsequently explored with policy-makers develop a final set of attributes. The NGT process has been outlined in detail in a separate paper ( Teahan et al., 2021 ). Each attribute was assigned various levels of provision, based on best available information, beginning with current provision which is referred to throughout as the status quo (see Appendix 1). Each choice set included three alternatives including one which represented the status quo in Ireland. There were no additional taxation implications if the status quo support package was selected by respondents. Given the disjointed, fragmented and sparse provision of family carer supports in Ireland, defining the status quo was challenging. The status quo alternative was determined by reviewing relevant research and policy documents, more information on this process is outlined in Appendix 1. The status quo alternative was further validated through stage 6 consultation with policy-makers ( Table 1 ).
The pilot study was conducted with 50 citizens, using an online panel from the Red C Research company (chosen through a competitive tendering process). A dementia café attribute was originally included in the pilot DCE survey. However, pilot analysis suggested potential overlap between the function of the dementia café and carer peer support group attributes. Consequently, the dementia café attribute was removed from the survey. A conditional logit model was used to analyse the pilot responses. The final set of DCE attributes and levels are outlined in Table 2 . Table 2 . DCE attributes and levels. Attribute Attribute description Levels Day-care The person with dementia attends day-care in a local community-based centre, thereby providing the family carer with a regular short break from caring every week. Day-care is available on set days of the week for 5 h per day. Available one day a week Available two days a week Not available a Long-break respite This service involves the person with dementia receiving professional 24-h care for two consecutive weeks every year. This gives the family carer a long break from caring every year. In-home Out-of-home Not available a Carer peer support group This service provides carers the opportunity to develop a peer support network with other family carers of people with dementia. Family carers attend the group on their own, without the person with dementia. Carer peer support groups are an opportunity for family carers to get emotional support and practical advice from other family carers. Available once a month Not available a Carers Allowance A government weekly payment of €219 made to full-time family carers of people with dementia. Full-time family carers provide over 35 h of care to a person with dementia every week. Means-tested a Universally available Not available Additional taxation These support packages will come at an additional cost to the taxpayer each year. €0*, €50, €100, €150, €200, €300, €400 a Reference case.
A design with three alternatives (including a status quo alternative), with a total of 12 choice sets was generated using Ngene software. A Bayesian efficient experimental design based on the minimisation of the Bayesian D-error (Db-error) criterion was used to generate the choice cards and choice alternatives ( Bliemer et al., 2008 ). Priors identified in the pilot study were used to inform the experimental design of the main study. Each choice card consisted of two hypothetical generic support package alternatives (Package 1 and Package 2) and a status quo (usual care) alternative (Package 3). Including a status quo option ensured that respondents were not forced to choose between two enhanced support packages, if both were considered unappealing. The value of including the status quo option is that respondents can signal that they are happy with current provision. Maintaining the status quo is, therefore, a potential policy option in it's own right. A sample choice card is presented in Fig. 1 .

The survey was administered online through the Red C Research company. In total, 509 individuals over 18 years old participated in the study, all were members of the company's online panel. The survey took approximately 20 min to complete; five respondents were dropped due to flatlining (quickly clicking through the survey). Ethical approval was provided by the NUI Galway Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 20.Jun.20). Individuals were initially contacted by e-mail and invited to participate in the study. The sample was broadly representative of the Irish population ( Table 3 ). Table 3 . Sample descriptive statistics compared to national average statistics (18+ population).

While the majority of respondents did not have any carer experience, 38% had provided unpaid care to a person with complex care needs, with 13% of those providing care for a person with dementia.
The online survey introduction outlined the research purpose and gave a brief overview of dementia and family carers including the role they play caring for people with dementia in Ireland. Following some basic demographic questions, respondents were directed to an instruction video, which explained; the service and support attributes (see Table 2 ); attribute levels of provision; technical instructions on completing choice card exercises; and information that any choice requiring additional taxation would mean that they would have less money to spend on other things. Respondents completed 12 choice cards, plus a rationality test choice card, in which one option was dominant over the others. The dominant option had better levels on all the non-cost attributes (day-care, long-break respite, carers support groups, universal carers allowance) and lower additional taxation (€50). This allowed us to assess if the choice task had been understood by respondents ( Ryan and Bate, 2001 ). A minority of respondents (9%) failed the rationality test. Additional robustness checks were conducted by estimating conditional logit models with and without the ‘irrational’ survey respondents. No significant differences existed between each group, therefore their data was retained in the main analysis. Additionally, previous research cautions against, deleting ‘irrational’ respondents, as some of their responses may be valid ( Ryan et al., 2009 ).
Econometric analysis of DCEs is based on random utility theory , which assumes that individuals are utility maximisers ( McFadden, 1973 ). Utility U n i for individual n of alternative i consists of an observable component V n i and a random component ε n i , giving the following representation of utility: U n i = V n i + ε n i where V n i = β ′ x n i with β ′ representing a vector of parameters used to describe preferences for attributes x .
A conditional logit was first estimated, which provides a useful starting point in analysing choice data. While the conditional logit model provides a useful indication of theoretical validity, the restrictive assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), failure to incorporate preference heterogeneity in the utility parameters, and failure to account for the panel nature of the data has led to extensions ( Hensher et al., 2015b ). To overcome this, and to account for heterogeneity in preferences, we estimated mixed logit models in both preference space and WTP space ( Hole and Kolstad, 2012 ; Train and Weeks, 2005 ).
In a sample with N respondents, each respondent n faces S choice situations and each choice situation has a choice set with J alternatives. The indirect utility function for individual n choosing alternative j in choice situation s is: U n j s = β n ′ X n j s + ε n j s where X n j s is a vector of support package attributes and β n is a vector of individual specific coefficients to be estimated with a density function ∫ ( β n | θ ) where θ is a vector of parameters of a continuous population distribution. The error term ε n j s incorporates unobserved factors that affect choices and is assumed to be Gumbel-distributed. As we do not observe β n , the unconditional choice probability is given as an integral over all possible variables of β n : P n j s ( β n ) = ∫ exp ( β n ′ X n j s ) ∑ j = 1 j exp ( β n ′ X n j s ) ∫ ( β n | θ ) d β n
The simulation is based on 500 Halton draws. For the mixed logit model in the preference space, the utility coefficients for the non-cost attributes and cost attributes are estimated and WTP is calculated post-estimation. In contrast, the WTP space method involves re-parameterising the mixed logit model in terms of WTP ( Train and Weeks, 2005 ). In the WTP space model, the ratio of the non-cost to cost coefficient is computed in the model, generating direct WTP estimates.
A critical issue when specifying a mixed logit model is choosing coefficients which are allowed to vary and the distribution they should take ( Hole, 2008 ). For the mixed logit in the preference space, all the coefficients are specified as random following a Normal distribution, except the cost coefficient (additional tax). The tax coefficient was fixed to avoid heavily skewed WTP distribution ( Hole and Kolstad, 2012 ). To derive the marginal WTP for the different support package attributes, we distinguish between monetary, m n k t , and non-monetary attributes, x n k t such that: U n k t = β n m m n k t + ∑ k = 1 k β n k x n k t + ε n k t where β n m and β n k are the parameters for the monetary and non-monetary attributes respectively. The WTP for an attribute k can be written as the ratio of its coefficient to that of the monetary attribute: W T P = β n k β n m
The model is estimated with the user-written mixlogit package in Stata. This fixed cost coefficient approach implies the standard deviation of unobserved utility is the same for all observations ( Train and Weeks, 2005 ). To overcome this, we estimate a mixed logit model in WTP space, in which the coefficient on the tax variable is assumed to be random and log-normally distributed. All models including the subgroup models are estimated with the user-written mixlogitwtp packages in Stata 15 ( Hole, 2016 ). Information on lower log-likelihood, Akaike information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were also estimated to assess ‘goodness-of-fit’.
Using estimates from the mixed logit in the WTP space, we evaluate welfare changes associated with enhanced support packages. In particular, we estimate the compensating variation or welfare impact of moving from status quo provision ( Z 0 ) to alternative provision ( Z 1 ) . This can be derived using a variant of the standard compensating variation log-sum formula ( Hanemann, 1984 ), such that: C V = ln [ ∑ exp ( γ ′ Z n 1 ) ] − ln [ ∑ exp ( γ ′ Z n 0 ) ] with a WTP space model, the welfare measures are integrated over the WTP distribution in the population, such that: C V = ∫ { [ ln [ ∑ exp ( γ ′ Z n 1 ) ] − ln [ ∑ exp ( γ ′ Z n 0 ) ] ] } f ( y ) d y
This integral is also approximated by simulation from draws of the estimated distributions in our chosen model ( Norton and Hynes, 2014 ). This allows us to calculate the welfare impact of a change in attributes from the status quo scenario to various possible alternative scenarios.

Section: 3. Results

The conditional logit coefficients conformed with prior expectations, suggesting that respondents considered all attributes when making choices. The negative Alternative Specific Constant (ASC) suggests that participants preferred the enhanced support packages over maintaining the status quo. The conditional logit model estimates are provided in Appendix 2.
Conditional logit models do not take into account heterogeneous preferences across participants, so their key assumptions may not always hold in reality ( Hensher et al., 2015a ). Consequently, we ran a mixed logit in both the preference and WTP space. Lower log-likelihood, AIC and BIC indicated that the mixed logit model in the WTP space was a better fit for the data than the mixed logit model in the preference space (see Appendix 3). The mixed logit in the WTP space estimates are, therefore, presented in Table 4 as Model 1, where the coefficients can be interpreted directly as marginal WTP estimates. Table 4 .

The results indicate that respondents were willing-to-pay €338 and €448 additional tax per year for family carers to receive one and two days of day-care per week respectively. They were willing-to-pay €117 additional taxation per year for carer peer support groups. The findings indicated significant levels of WTP for both long-break respite levels, with slightly higher preferences for out-of-home respite versus in-home respite (€299 vs €294). Survey respondents were willing-to-pay €175 additional taxation per year to extend the current means-tested provision of carer's allowance to universal provision of carer's allowance for full-time family carers. Survey respondents had a strong negative preference for providing no carer's allowance when compared with means-tested carer's allowance.
We conducted additional subgroup analysis to assess differences across groups according to gender, income and family caring experience. No statistically significant differences in preferences were found by gender. With regard to income, we found that, in all but one case (two days of day-care), attribute preferences did not significantly differ across the income subgroups. Those with a household income before tax of 0-30 k had significantly lower WTP when compared with the 30 k-50 k subgroup (see Appendix 4). We identified significant differences in WTP based on family caring experience. Specifically, survey respondents with current or prior experience of family caring were willing-to-pay higher levels of taxation across most of the attribute levels, with the notable exception of carer peer support groups (see Table 4 : Model 2 and 3). Finally, while the use of interaction terms was considered for this analysis, they were not included in our final models. Given that the focus of the analysis is on comparing WTP across sub-groups, we believe that estimating separate models on the sub-groups is more appropriate.
Table 5 shows the welfare impact of a change in the provision of supports ( Hanemann, 1984 ). A base scenario was first specified, which reflects current provision in Ireland, specifically, no day-care, no long-break respite, no carer support group and a means-tested carers allowance. We then estimated the welfare impact of moving from this status quo provision to enhanced support packages. Our findings show that providing one day of day-care per week, while keeping all other aspects of service provision the same, leads to a welfare gain of €324.57 (scenario 1) relative to the base scenario. Increasing day-care provision to two days per week leads to an even higher welfare gain of €451.76 (scenario 2). In scenario 3, family carers are provided with two weeks in-home respite, along with two days of day-care per week, which leads to a welfare gain of €735.08. When a universal carers allowance is added, the welfare gain increases to €911.99 (scenario 4). Finally, making carer support groups available in scenario 5, along with two weeks of in-home respite, two days of day-care a week and a universal carers allowance would lead to welfare gain of €1035.80 relative to the base scenario. Combining all attributes, to the highest level of provision available, yields considerable welfare gains for respondents. Table 5 . Compensating surplus value per year.

Section: 4. Discussion

The conceptualisation and measurement of informal care, and support for its providers, is one of the least researched areas in long-term care literature ( Courtin et al., 2014 ; Gori et al., 2015 ). This is very surprising given the contribution that family carers have made to the long-term care for people with dementia; moreover, long-term care systems across Europe will continue to rely on family carers in the coming decades ( Colombo et al., 2011 ; World Health Organisation, 2012 ). It is no wonder, therefore, that the supporting family carers is becoming an increasingly relevant policy goal in relation to long-term care in Europe ( Zigante, 2018 ). The protection of family carers’ human rights , given their particular challenges, has been explored in recent European work ( ENNHRI, 2017 ). However, generating the level of state investment necessary to support family carers of people with dementia is proving a challenge in almost all countries ( Eggers et al., 2020 ). In Ireland, close to €1 billion worth of care, estimated using replacement and opportunity costs, or just under half of the overall cost of care, is currently being provided to people with dementia by family members and friends ( O’Shea et al., 2017 ). Without carers, there would be significant additional costs falling directly on the state ( Cahill, 2021 ) at a time when government budgetary systems are under increasing strain.
Weak government support for family carers is often attributed to the tradition and culture of family care in Ireland, with family care largely seen as an unstated social obligation, the cost of which should be borne by families alone. This led to policy framing family carers as a resource within the long-term care system, offering little protection against the personal and social disadvantage experienced by those in caring roles. However, this resource-framed view is coming under increasing scrutiny ( Cahill, 2021 ). While the Citizens' Assembly (2017) indicated renewed cultural support for family care, this Assembly also voted for increased State support to informal providers of care. Similarly, our findings suggest that the public believe that family carers of people with dementia deserve more support from government. In particular, respondents are willing-to-pay additional taxation to fund enhanced care and support for family carers, above and beyond usual care provision. While this study was conducted in the Irish context, considering increasing prevalence of dementia and demand for community-based care across Europe, our findings provide useful insights into general policy approaches to support family carers of people with dementia in other countries.
Looking more closely at our findings, respondents particularly valued family carers having access to regular breaks from their caring responsibilities through enhanced day-care and respite provision. Caring for a person with dementia has been shown to be particularly time intensive, with family carers often reporting that constant supervision is necessary to ensure the safety of the person with dementia, in addition to regular task-based care ( Teahan et al., 2020 ). Research on occupational stress has repeatedly shown that time poverty contributes to poorer mental and physical health outcomes ( Mullainathan and Shafir, 2013 ; Strazdins et al., 2016 ). Family carers report having very little time to pursue individual interests outside of caring; when choosing between their own needs or those of the person they care for, they prioritise the latter ( Waligora et al., 2018 ). Facilitating breaks from caring on a regular weekly basis (day-care) and having access to a long break at least once a year (long-break respite) were strongly supported by respondents in this study. The family carer subgroup findings further supports these points, indicating respondents with caring experience had higher WTP for day-care, long-break respite and carer's allowance. Interestingly, the WTP estimates of respondents with caring experience did not statistically differ from other respondents in relation to the carer peer support group attribute. While carer peer support groups were still seen as valuable, family carers may be able to access peer support through their own informal social networks rather than through formal provision. In contrast, accessing regular respite breaks and financial supports would be more challenging outside the formal system.
It must also be recognised that services such as day-care and long-break respite require consent from the person with dementia as well as the family carer. The current provision of out-of-home respite is seen as particularly problematic in Ireland, while similar reservations have been expressed in relation to the unsuitability of respite provision in other countries ( Leocadie et al., 2018 ). Currently in Ireland, most respite facilities are located in nursing homes or community hospitals where staff already have high workloads and/or are inadequately trained to work with people with dementia. Thus, when family carers do avail of long-break out-of-home respite, respite breaks are often terminated prematurely either by request of staff or the person with dementia ( Teahan et al., 2021 ). Consequently, these services need to be designed to create dual benefits for both parties ( O'Shea et al., 2017 ). As family carers tend to prioritise the needs of the person with dementia, it is unlikely they will utilise services that create potential dislocation and distress for the person under their care. Not surprisingly, a recent Belgian study highlighted that in-home respite not only creates better outcomes for both family carers and people with dementia, but it is also cost-effective when compared with standard community-based dementia care ( Vandepitte et al., 2020 ).
Respondents also recognised the value of strengthening family carers' social networks through increased provision of carer peer support groups. Many family carers report reduced social participation due to their caring role ( Nay et al., 2015 ). Increasing caring responsibilities and time commitments can lead to family carers experiencing a ‘shrinking world’ in which maintaining social networks outside the home becomes difficult ( Davies et al., 2019 ). Prioritising the needs of the person with dementia and reduced capacity for spontaneity are often key factors underlying this loss of social participation. In addition a type of socially distancing behaviour from other family members and friends often occurs, further exacerbating social isolation ( Vikström et al., 2008 ). This socially distancing behaviour, along with reduced social participation, sometimes diminishes family carers access to emotional support through their informal social support networks. Carer peer support groups offer an alternative social network where family carers can get emotional support, advice and reassurance from people exposed to the same type of experiences. Research has also highlighted that attendance at support groups can help address negative social comparison - the feeling of not doing as well as others decreases when exposed to people in similar circumstances experiencing similar challenges ( Locock and Brown, 2010 ).
Our results suggest that respondents recognised that family caring for people with dementia carried monetary implications, including the potential for real and enduring financial disadvantage. In contributing to care for people with dementia, some family carers may experience significant out-of-pocket expenses associated with purchasing health and social care services, as well as reduced income stemming from decreased paid employment hours, or even having to exit the paid workforce completely ( Neubert et al., 2019 ; Principi et al., 2014 ). Our results indicate the provision of monetary support to low-income family carers was highly valued, as evidenced by the strong disutility associated with abolishing the current means-tested carer's allowance. Even more interestingly, respondents supported the extension of the current carer's allowance from means-tested to universal provision. Our findings indicate, therefore, that the public is willing to support formal recognition and compensation of family carers of people with dementia regardless of their financial circumstances.
While welfare gains can be achieved by providing either familial or non-familial support, our analysis shows that a mix of day-care, long-break respite, carers allowance and carer support groups provide the highest welfare gains. In contrast to the resource-based view of family carers in Irish policy, these findings suggest that respondents view family carers as citizens who deserve support and recognition for the work they do with, and for, people with dementia. Although often veiled, the major policy argument against increasing services for family carers has always been the potential moral hazard implications of enhanced government support and the ensuing effects on health and social care budgets ( McLaughlin and Glendinning, 1994 ; Twigg and Atkin, 1994 ). However, this paper has shown, in a carefully thought-out experiment, that the public are willing-to-pay additional taxation to fund services and supports that carers themselves have ranked as important. The paper provides evidence of the need and potential for greater investment in family carers in Ireland and internationally. Our findings complement a recent DCE conducted on home-care for people with dementia which showed support for personhood-based services for people with dementia, with a particular emphasis on personalised care and socially connected provision ( Walsh et al., 2020 ).
While this paper followed a rigorous design process, a number of caveats need to be considered. As DCEs operate through hypothetical scenarios, there is potential for hypothetical bias. The WTP estimates may not accurately reflect citizens’ real-life choices or behaviours. However, due to the nature of our sample, it was not possible to observe revealed preferences. The majority of citizens are not family carers and have not accessed supports for family carers, therefore stated preference methodologies are most appropriate in this context. In fact, due to the restricted availability of supports in Ireland, in many cases it would not even be possible to conduct revealed preferences research with family carers on this topic. To minimise hypothetical bias, we conducted significant qualitative groundwork to ensure survey respondents understood the attributes being valued, framed additional taxation as mandatory if implemented, and respondents perceived their choices as influencing the provision of service attributes ( Johnston et al., 2017 ). A second limitation was our use of online non-probability survey panels which have been critiqued, citing concerns over selection bias ( Baker et al., 2010 ). However, more focused research exploring non-probability panels for stated preference surveys do not reveal inferior results ( Determann et al., 2017 ). A third limitation is that we did not distinguish between income tax-payers and non-income tax-payers. This may introduce some bias into our estimates, although respondents were asked to think about additional taxation generally rather than specific income tax. Despite these limitations this paper provides useful insights into public preferences for supporting family carers of people with dementia, and will be of interest to policy-makers both in Ireland and internationally.

Section: 5. Conclusion

In conclusion, while family carers often prioritise the needs of people with dementia over their own, it is important that governments do not do the same. Although the contribution of carers is often acknowledged in the public narrative on caring, for example in preambles to government policy documents on ageing ( Department of Health, 2014 ; Department of Social Protection, 2012 ), this contribution is often downplayed or ignored when it comes to resource allocation . It is likely that the Irish government will continue to rely on family carers to provide the bulk of long-term care to people with dementia in the future, but it is far from certain that families will continue to provide care without significant investment in supports. Therefore, while low levels of provision for family carers may serve as an opportunistic money-saving mechanism in the short-term, it may potentially create additional problems in the future. Moreover, given the current age profile of family carers of people with dementia, many could enter retirement themselves with decreased physical, mental and financial well-being as a consequence of excessive caring, leading to a need for even higher volumes of supports.
Respondents in this study have shown empathy towards family carers of people with dementia and are willing to support enhanced provision through additional taxation. Facilitating access to regular caring breaks during the week was highly valued among our sample. Citizens' strongest preference was for two days of day-care to be made available to family carers of people with dementia. Having access to a continuous two-week break was also highly valued by respondents, either in-home or out-of-home respite. The social needs of carers was recognised through support for peer engagement on a monthly basis, as an opportunity for carers to come together on an informal basis. At a minimum, respondents supported the continuation of means–tested carer's allowance as an income support for less financially secure carers. However, citizens also expressed a preference for universal carers' allowance to be provided to all full-time family carers of people with dementia, regardless of financial standing. This suggests that the public believes that Carer's Allowance should be made available as a formal recognition of the caring contribution, rather than an income support as currently framed by policy. Extrapolating our results suggest that additional revenue could be raised through additional taxation to support comprehensive support packages for family carers. However, DCEs are hypothetical in nature, making it problematic to be definitive on the financial feasibility of any potential reforms. Further research is needed before making any stronger policy statements.
