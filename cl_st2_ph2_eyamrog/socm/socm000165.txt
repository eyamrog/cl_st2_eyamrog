Title: Educational stressors and secular trends in school stress and mental health problems in adolescents


Abstract: Abstract

Increasing mental health problems among adolescents have been have reported in several countries over the last decades. Yet, little is known regarding the societal changes underlying secular trends in adolescent mental health. The educational stressors hypothesis states that educational expansion and a shift to knowledge economies makes life chances of adolescents more dependent on their educational performance , thus generating more school stress and, in turn, mental health problems. The present study tests this hypothesis using multilevel analyses and panel data techniques to analyse data from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, including more than 150,000 adolescents in 33 European countries over 12 years.
Results show that economic change, as measured by changes in national gross domestic product, but not educational expansion, contributes to more school stress in adolescents. Both economic change and educational expansion makes school stress more consequential for mental health problems, such that the effect of stress on mental health problems becomes stronger as countries grow richer and more educated. I conclude that, consistent with the educational stressors hypothesis, economic change and educational expansion has likely contributed to increasing mental health problems in adolescents.

Section: 1. Introduction

A number of studies have reported deteriorating mental health among adolescents, especially girls, in high-income countries over the last decades (see Collishaw, 2015 & Potrebny et al., 2017 for reviews). This goes for diagnosed mental illnesses, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, as well as for self-reported mental health problems or symptoms of poor mental health, such as sleeping difficulties or sadness ( Collishaw, 2015 ). It is the latter that is in focus for this study.
While a considerable amount of research has investigated individual-level determinants of adolescent mental health problems, such approaches are limited when it comes to explaining secular trends spanning across decades, cohorts and countries, and less is known regarding the societal changes underlying these trends ( Bor et al., 2014 ; Collishaw, 2015 ; Pinquart et al., 2014 ; Cosma et al., 2020 ). One of the more influential explanatory models in the literature is the “educational stressors hypothesis”, stating that more mental health problems among adolescents is due to more stressors related to school and education ( West and Sweeting, 2003 ). The hypothesis states that contemporary societies put more emphasis on education, as evidenced by the shift to knowledge economies and the expansion of higher education, and that life chances of adolescents are increasingly dependent on their educational performance . As a consequence, adolescents feel more stress over school, and their mental health is more sensitive or vulnerable to this stress. However, although frequently discussed in the context of trends in adolescent mental health problems, the hypothesis have not yet been investigated using actual measures of educational stressors at the societal (or macro) level. This study aims to test the educational stressors hypothesis using multilevel data on more than 150,000 adolescents aged 15–16 years in 33 countries over 12 years (2002–2014). Specifically, the study has two research questions: 1. Have economic change and educational expansion contributed to more school stress among adolescents? 2. Has the effect of school stress on mental health problems become stronger as a result of economic change and educational expansion?
The study contributes to the existing literature on secular trends in adolescent mental health problems and stress in two important ways. First, most existing research have looked at determinants at the individual level (e.g. Cosma et al., 2020 ). While such studies provide important insights concerning the role of such determinants, they are more limited when it comes to assessing broad societal trends that may affect whole cohorts of individuals. Second, studies that have aimed to investigate societal trends have done so either indirectly through individual-level data (cf. Collishaw, 2015 ), or descriptively (i.e. theoretical reasoning based on descriptive data on societal trends) ( Bremberg, 2015 ). By combining individual-level survey data with macro-level data on societal trends, this study explicitly tests the impact of key societal factors, while simultaneously improving on causal inference by using panel data techniques.
Before moving on, the use of the concepts school stress and mental health problems should be clarified. Stress arises from situations in which individuals perceive that the demands they face exceed their ability to manage them (cf. Östberg et al., 2015 ). Consequently, school stress describes stress responses to demands faced in relation to adolescents’ situation in school. Stress is thus a subjective, individual-level response, while the term (educational) stressor designates objectively existing conditions, such as the need to perform in school in order to have access to higher education. As for mental health problems, this is understood as subjective symptoms referring to psychological or mental states, with no assumptions made regarding the underlying etiology (cf. ( Potrebny et al., 2017 ). Previous research has, based on similar self-reported symptoms as analysed in this study, used related terms such as psychosomatic symptoms ( Högberg et al., 2020 ), internalizing symptoms ( Potrebny et al., 2017 ), or psychological distress ( Sweeting et al., 2010 ). Mental health problems, by definition, captures symptoms of poor mental health. However, good mental health, or wellbeing , is more than the absence of mental health problems. Positive and evaluative aspects of mental health and wellbeing, such as overall life satisfaction , is equally important, but is not the main focus in this study since available data suggest that these aspects of wellbeing have been stable among adolescents in high-income countries ( Cosma et al., 2020 ). The indicators used in the empirical analyses are described later.

Section: 2. Background

The educational stressors hypothesis was initially formulated by West and Sweeting (2003) , and referred to the importance of educational stressors for the secular increase in stress and psychological distress among adolescent girls in particular. West and Sweeting (2003) argue that the lives of adolescents are increasingly shaped by an emphasis on educational performance , with adolescents leaving school at later ages and a larger share attaining higher education degrees. This generates a range of stressors related to school and education, which in turn contribute to mental health problems through two potential mechanisms. First, if a source of stress (e.g. school-related) has a positive effect on mental health problems, an increase in the prevalence of this over time will, all else being equal, lead to more mental health problems. Second, if the positive effect of a source of stress on mental health problems becomes stronger over time, this will also lead to more mental health problems, since existing levels of stress becomes more harmful ( Högberg et al., 2020 ; Sweeting et al., 2010 ). The first mechanism is called the exposure mechanism, and refers to a change in the exposure to or prevalence of a source of stress. The second mechanism is called the vulnerability-mechanism, and refers to changed vulnerability or sensitivity to a source of stress ( Sweeting et al., 2010 ). In this study, the exposure mechanism corresponds to research question 1 (‘Have economic change and educational expansion contributed to more school stress?‘), and the vulnerability-mechanism to research question 2 (‘Has the effect of school stress on mental health problems become stronger as a result of economic change and educational expansion?‘).
There is ample evidence showing that adolescents, especially girls, perceive school and education to be a major source of stress in their lives ( Byrne et al., 2007 ; Löfstedt et al., 2020 ), and that such stress is associated with mental health problems ( Aanesen et al., 2017 ; Högberg et al., 2020 ). For instance, in a comprehensive study by ( Byrne et al., 2007 ), five out of 10 major components of stress among adolescents were related to education, and of the 10 components, stress about school performance and stress about future uncertainty (including uncertainty about educational careers) were among the strongest predictors of anxiety and depression.
The causes and consequences of school stress can be understood based on how students are sorted into two interlinked hierarchies through education ( Elstad, 2010 ). (1) First, a salient feature of education systems is the evaluation of performance, for instance using tests and grades, through which students are sorted into a hierarchy of educational performance (2) Second, educational performance (e.g. grades). is the principal instrument used to allocate students within the education system, and in modern knowledge societies, educational attainment is the principal instrument used to allocate individuals to positions in the labour market . Thus, individuals are sorted into a hierarchy of social prospects based on their educational performance. The two hierarchies are interlinked, such that the first hierarchy (educational performance) forms the basis for the second (social prospects) ( Elstad, 2010 ).
The first hierarchy (educational performance) can generate stress since poor performance in school impact on the identity, self-worth and self-esteem of students ( Landstedt et al., 2009 ), and since performing well may require a substantial and possibly stressful workload, with tests, homework and deadlines ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ). From the perspective of this study, this first hierarchy is of less direct relevance, since the types of social changes in focus (e.g. educational expansion) do not directly impact on the sorting of students within schools. However, since the two hierarchies are interlinked, the pressures arising from the sorting of students into a hierarchy of social prospects (the second hierarchy) “spill over” onto the day-to-day experiences of students in school ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ; Putwain, 2009 ; Smyth and Banks, 2012 ). This “spillover-effect” arises from the path-dependent structure of education systems, as progress to higher stages in the education system is dependent on performance at previous stages ( Breen and Jonsson, 2000 ). Such path-dependence means that students’ performance today may have substantial long-term consequences for their future prospects. For instance, eligibility to academic programs in upper secondary school may require certain qualifications from lower secondary school, and access to prestigious universities may require certain grades or test scores. Educational performance in early stages may therefore constitute critical junctures for future life trajectories ( Putwain, 2009 ).
Qualitative research from many contexts has shown that adolescents are cognizant of the long-term consequences of their educational performance, with students who are still in secondary school viewing their present performance as decisive for their prospects as adults ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ; Denscombe, 2000 ; Huan et al., 2008 ; Låftman et al., 2013 ; Putwain, 2009 ). This explains why uncertainty and stress about the future, linked to educational and labour market opportunities, consistently emerges as a major stressor for adolescents, and why such uncertainty spills over to the day-to-day schoolwork in the present ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ; Byrne et al., 2007 ). For instance, high-stakes tests, in which the results have appreciable consequences for future educational careers, are perceived as much more stressful than other types of tests ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ; Smyth and Banks, 2012 ; von der Embse et al., 2018 ), and can even cause suicidal ideation ( Wang, 2016 ). School stress may also be “contagious”, and spread between students, or from teachers and parents to students ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ; Låftman et al., 2013 ). Thus, even though each individual student may not have full information on the consequences of her educational performance, she may still be affected by the worries of peers, parents or teachers.
Economic changes and educational expansion have had profound implications for the prospects of adolescents and youths in recent decades. Technological change and globalization has transformed Western societies from industrial to knowledge economies, and replaced medium-skilled but relatively well-paid industrial and routine jobs with jobs in the growing knowledge and service economy. Accordingly, several researchers argue that Western labour markets have become increasingly polarized, with a growth of both high-skilled knowledge-intensive and low-skilled service-oriented occupations, but a decline of medium-skilled industrial occupations ( Brunello and Wruuck, 2019 ; Goos et al., 2009 ; Pekkarinen, 2012 ). Others argue that knowledge economies contribute to over-education among youth, with highly educated workers taking jobs for which they are over-qualified, thus crowding out low-skilled youth from jobs that they may otherwise be qualified to take ( Tåhlin and Westerman, 2020 ). The upshot is that labour market prospects of high-skilled workers have improved more than for lower skilled ones, as evidenced by high and in many countries increasing youth unemployment rates for low educated workers ( Gebel and Giesecke, 2016 ), and growing wage inequality driven by skill upgrading at the top of the wage distribution ( Pereira and Galego, 2019 ). Crucially, access to the expanding high-skilled job market is directly dependent on education.
These changes have profoundly transformed school-to-work transitions among adolescents, leading to fractured transitions from adolescence to adulthood and more uncertain life-course trajectories ( Blossfeld, 2005 ; Pinquart et al., 2014 ). The narrow road to a secure social position in adulthood increasingly passes through the education system, particularly higher education, and even more so for young workers who lack other types of human capital such as work experience ( Blossfeld, 2005 ). Adolescents react accordingly, by staying in school longer and entering higher education in greater numbers, leading to an almost two-time increase in the tertiary attainment rate among young Europeans since the early 2000s ( Eurostat, 2020 ).
In its most general formulation, the educational stressors hypothesis posits that increased emphasis on education in society makes school stress more prevalent, and more consequential for mental health problems. Based on the societal processes just described, two more specific versions of this hypothesis can be formulated. A first version states that economic change, broadly defined, gives rise to knowledge-societies with associated occupational structures. In these societies, educational attainment is a key resource in the labour market, especially for young workers, and adolescents try to cope with uncertain life-course trajectories though educational attainment ( Pinquart et al., 2014 ). Thus, as countries grow richer and more knowledge-intensive, educational attainment becomes more important for future prospects. In turn, adolescents perceive school to be more stressful, and become more vulnerable to this stress in terms of mental health problems. Moreover, since women are relatively more dependent on education for their labour market opportunities, possibly because education attenuates gender discrimination and gives women access to high-paying jobs otherwise traditionally dominated by men ( Pekkarinen, 2012 ; Dougherty, 2005 ), these processes may be more important for girls than for boys.
A second version states that educational expansion, and increased demand for education, leads to intensified competition for access to higher education, especially to attractive programs or institutions. Education is partly a positional good, and with a growing demand for education, but a given level of (high-status) positions, competition for attractive positions becomes more intense. With educational performance (e.g. grades) being the main instrument used to allocate students in the education system, the consequence is an intensified pressure to perform, also in earlier stages of the education system. Moreover, with women vastly outnumbering men in higher education across almost all high-income countries ( Pekkarinen, 2012 ), there is reason to expect that this pressure may be felt more strongly for girls than for boys. Since the aim of attaining higher education is typically to gain access to certain jobs, the second version may be regarded as a sub-category of the first.

Section: 3. Materials and methods

The research questions impose three conditions on the data. First, representative and harmonized individual-level data on school stress and mental health problems are required for cross-country comparisons. Second, multilevel data are required to study effects of stressors at the societal level on individual-level outcomes. Third, data spanning over several years are required to study secular trends. Data from the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, combined with macro data from OECD and Eurostat , meet these three conditions.
HBSC is a repeated cross sectional survey with the aim to gather cross-country comparable data on the health of adolescents in high- and middle income countries. It has been carried out in collaboration with the World Health Organization every four years since the 1980s, expanding to 41 countries in 2014. The target population is all adolescents in the participating countries attending school, grouped into three age categories or grade levels (approximately 11–12, 13–14 or 15–16 years old). Cluster sampling designs are used for data collection, with schools or school classes constituting the primary sampling unit. Cross-country comparability is ensured through a standardised research protocol. The target sample size is at least 1500 students per age group and country, and average response rates are around 70%. More information on survey methodology can be found in Roberts et al. (2009) . HBSC has been extensively used in studies on studies of school stress and mental health problems ( Högberg et al., 2020 ; Sonmark et al., 2016 ; Cosma et al., 2020 ).
I restrict the sample to the oldest age group (aged 15–16 years), since the increase in mental health problems have been stronger for older adolescents ( Bor et al., 2014 ), and since this typically corresponds to the last year before upper secondary school, meaning that performance becomes more decisive for future educational careers. Including the maximum number of countries and survey waves for which there is both macro- and individual-level data results in a data set with around 160,000 students, nested in 33 countries and four survey waves (2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014), or in 115 country-years combinations. The number of observations is reduced in some models due to missing data on covariates. Since the macro data is gathered from Eurostat (see below), only European countries are included.
The focal outcomes are school stress and mental health problems. HBSC contains one item measuring stress related to demands in school: “How pressured do you feel by the schoolwork you have to do?“, with answers ranging from “Not at all” (0) to “A lot” (3). A more detailed and comprehensive set of items would be preferable, but is not available in more than a few participating countries. However, the item has been extensively used in previous research on school stress, and is a strong predictor of mental health problems ( Cosma et al., 2020 ; Högberg et al., 2020 ; Sonmark et al., 2016 ).
As for mental health problems, HBSC contains a list of eight items measuring psychosomatic health complaints (the HBSC symptoms checklist). Students are asked how often they have experienced headache, stomachache, dizziness, backache, sleeping difficulties, feeling low, feeling nervous, and feeling irritable or bad tempered over the last six months. Response options range from “Rarely or never” (0) to “About every day“ (4). Based on these, Dey et al. (2015) show that a two-factor model fits the data better than a one-factor model. Specifically, the two-factor model distinguishes mental symptoms (sleeping difficulties, feeling low, nervous, and irritable or bad tempered) from somatic symptoms (headache, stomachache, dizziness, backache). Given the focus on mental health problems, I only use the four mental symptoms, and construct an additive index based on those, ranging from 0 (no problems) to 16 (frequent problems).
A range of demographic characteristics are included to account for compositional differences of the student population across years and countries. Specifically, I control for gender, whether the student lives with his/her father and mother, perception of the economic standing of the family, and the consumption level of the household. I also control for additional covariates that have been highlighted in previous research on trends in stress or mental health problems, including quality of family relations, body image, physical activity , binge drinking , and experiences of being bullied (cf. Banks and Smyth, 2015 ; Högberg et al., 2020 ; Sweeting et al., 2010 ). Survey questions and descriptive statistics for all individual-level variables are included in Table S1 in the online appendix.
The macro-level focus is on economic change and educational expansion. Economic change refers to a broad set of processes related to technological change, a shift to knowledge economies, and the growth of knowledge-intensive jobs. These processes are well captured by the level of economic development of a country ( Brunello and Wruuck, 2019 ), as measured by national Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. More specific indicators of for instance occupational upgrading are contested ( Oesch and Piccitto, 2019 ) and not available for all countries and years. I use data on national GDP per capita from OECD , measured yearly in current prices (US dollars), and adjusted for purchasing power ( OECD, 2020 ).
Educational expansion refers to the expansion of higher (tertiary) education. Due to the poor availability of data on enrolment in education, this is measured by the tertiary attainment rate among young adults, specifically the share of the population aged 25–34 in each country and year with tertiary degrees (ISCED levels 5–8), with data from Eurostat (2020) . Youth unemployment rate and economic inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient), also from Eurostat, are included as country-level covariates. Descriptive statistics for country-level variables are included in Table S2 in the online appendix.
An important limitation with the study design is that GDP and tertiary attainment are highly correlated. The correlation of the average levels of the variables is 0.59, while the correlation of their change over time is 0.82. Since models including both simultaneously may lead to multicollinearity, they are analysed separately as well as together in the same model.
With repeated cross-sectional data on individuals nested in countries, panel methods are applicable to estimate effects of country-level variables. Two-way fixed effects models , with fixed effects for countries and years, offer a flexible way to control for unobserved confounding across countries and time. By only using variation within countries over time, two-way fixed effects models account for all confounding that is constant (time-invariant) within countries, as well as all time-varying confounding that is constant across countries. Two-way fixed effects models do not, however, account for time-varying confounding within countries, nor for confounding from variables that are time-invariant but the effects of which changes over time. Thus, an assumption underlying these models is that changes in focal predictors are unrelated to any unobserved country-specific trends in the outcome (i.e. time-varying confounding). One way to relax this assumption is to allow for country-specific linear trends in the outcome and assume that this linear trend captures relevant time-varying confounding, which is a less demanding assumption than assuming no correlation between focal predictors and country-specific trends ( Wooldridge, 2002 ). However, the country-specific trends may pick up effects of the focal predictor itself, and thus introduce a new source of bias ( Meer and West, 2016 ). Country-specific trends also adds one additional parameter for each country, which may lead to overparameterization and less precise estimates. There are no definite theoretical reasons to decide which specification is most appropriate in this setting, though the general increase in GDP and attainment rates over time rate would suggest that accounting for country-specific trends is advisable. I present results for both types of specifications, and regard estimates that are sensitive to either of these as less robust.
In HBSC, students are nested in schools or classes in addition to countries and years. However, the focal variables – GDP, tertiary attainment as well as stress and mental health problems – do not vary at the school class level, and including a random intercept at this level does not affect the results. Thus, I estimate multilevel linear regression models, with random intercepts for country-years ( Schmidt-Catran and Fairbrother, 2015 ), as represented by Equations (1) , (2) ). (1) γ i c y = β 0 i c y + β 1 C c + β 3 Y y + β 5 T c y + β 6 X i c y + β 7 Z c y + ε i c y + μ c y (2) γ i c y = β 0 i c y + β 1 C c + β 3 Y y + β 4 C c ∗ Y y + β 5 T c y + β 6 X i c y + β 7 Z c y + ε i c y + μ c y
Equation (1) represents a model with fixed effects for countries and years (two-way fixed effects model), while Equation (2) adds country-specific linear time trends. i indexes students, c indexes countries and y indexes survey years. γ i c y denotes levels of stress (research question 1) or mental health problems (research question 2) of student i in country c in year y . C c and Y y denotes dummy variables for each country and survey year, respectively. C c ∗ Y y in Equation (2) is a country-specific linear trend. T c y represents the focal predictors, GDP or tertiary attainment rate, with β 5 being the main parameter of interest. When addressing research question 2, T c y is interacted with school stress. These models therefore add a random slope for school stress due to the presence of cross-level interaction terms. X i c y is a vector of individual covariates, and Z c y a vector of time-varying country covariates, as described previously. ε i c y is the individual specific error term, and μ c y the error term at the country-year level. Since the distributions of both outcome variables are skewed, all models are estimated with heteroscedasticity robust standard errors.

Section: 4. Results

Before moving to the main analysis, I present descriptive information on trends in stress and in effects of stress on mental health problems. Fig. 1 shows average levels of school stress from 2002 to 2014, separately for boys and girls and for each country (or region). Girls tend to experience higher levels of stress across virtually all years and countries. While levels of stress varies across countries, there is no consistent pattern over time, and the overall picture is one of relative stability. Fig. 2 shows the average change in mental health problems associated with a one-step increase in the indicator of school stress (i.e. predicted effects of stress on mental health problems). The effect of stress has become stronger in several countries, and for boys and girls alike. Further analysis (not displayed) shows that the average increase in the effect of stress between 2002 and 2014 across all countries is around one third of a scale point on the mental health problems scale. Effects are also stronger for girls in most countries, with a weak but insignificant trend towards a greater gender gap. In sum, levels of stress have been largely stable, while the effect of stress on mental health problems in many cases has become stronger over time. As for the assumptions regarding the shape of country-specific time trends, a linear trend seems a reasonable approximation in a majority of countries for both outcomes.

Table 1 , Table 2 formally address the two research questions. In both tables, positive coefficients for the focal predictors indicate support for the educational stressors hypothesis. Table 1 presents estimates with school stress as the outcome (research question 1; exposure mechanism), and Table 2 estimates with mental health problems as the outcome (research question 2; vulnerability mechanism). In both tables, models with the letter “a” correspond to Equation (1) (only country and year fixed effects), and models with “b” to Equation (2) (country-specific linear time trends). Table 1 .

Robust standard errors in parentheses. Country and year fixed effects in all models. All models controlled for age, gender, lives with mother and/or father, economic standing of family, consumption level of household, quality of family relations, body image, physical activity, binge drinking, being bullied, economic inequality (GINI index). Models 2a-2b also controlled for youth unemployment rate.
Models 1a and 1 b in Table 1 show effects of GDP on school stress, controlling for individual and country-level covariates (though dropping youth unemployment rate as this is largely caused by changes in GDP). The effect of GDP is positive in both models, and significant at conventional thresholds (p-values range from 0.013 to 0.022). Substantially, the coefficients mean that a 1000 $ increase in GDP per capita is associated with between 0.009 and 0.017 scale points higher levels of stress. With GDP and school stress scaled to unit variance (mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1), the corresponding coefficients are around 0.13–0.25, meaning that a one standard deviation increase in GDP is associated with between 0.13 and 0.25 standard deviations higher levels of stress.
Models 2a and 2 b replace GDP with tertiary attainment rate as focal predictor. Model 2a shows that the attainment rate is, contrary to expectations, negatively associated with stress, that is, higher attainment is associated with lower stress. However, this negative association becomes markedly smaller and non-significant when adding country-specific trends in model 2 b. Substantially, the coefficients in models 2a and 2 b suggest that a one-percentage point increase in the attainment rate is associated with 0.007–0.014 scale steps lower levels of stress. With variables scaled to unit variance, the corresponding coefficients are 0.07–0.15. Models 3a and 3 b include GDP and tertiary attainment simultaneously. It should again be emphasised that these models suffer from problematically high multicollinearity. With this caveat in mind, results show that the coefficients for both GDP and attainment rate are reduced and turn insignificant in model 3 b (with country-specific time trends).
In sum, I find mixed support for the educational stressors hypothesis with regard the exposure mechanism. Higher GDP is associated with higher levels of stress, though not significantly so when including the attainment rate and country-specific time trends simultaneously, while higher attainment is either not significantly associated with stress, or even associated with lower levels of stress.
Table 2 shows results with mental health problems as the outcome, with the interaction terms between school stress and GDP or attainment rate, respectively, as focal coefficients, thus addressing research question 2. Stress, GDP and attainment rate have been mean centered in all models, meaning that their main effects show their effects when these variables are set at their average values. Models 1a and 1 b show that the interaction terms between stress and GDP are positive and statistically significant (p = 0–007), meaning that stress has a stronger effect on mental health problems when GDP is higher. With the variables scaled to unit variance, the interaction terms are around 0.017.
Models 2a and 2 b show that the interaction terms between stress and attainment rate are positive and significant (p = 0.005–0.007), meaning that stress has a stronger effect on mental health problems when attainment is higher. With the variables scaled to unit variance, the interaction terms are around 0.014. When GDP and attainment rate are included simultaneously in models 3a-3b, none of the interaction terms are significant (p-values around 0.1–0.2), though again these results are difficult to interpret due to multicollinearity. Importantly, with the exception of model 2a (with no country-specific trend), neither GDP nor attainment rate is significantly associated with mental health problems through their main effects. Thus, the analyses suggest that it is primarily by modifying the effect of stress that GDP and attainment rate are of importance for mental health problems. In sum, I find rather strong support for the educational stressors hypothesis with regard to the vulnerability mechanism.
A range of supplementary analyses have been performed to probe the robustness of the results. These analyses reproduce models 1a-2b in Table 1 , Table 2 , but using different outcome variables and predictors. For parsimony, models 3a and 3 b are left out from the supplementary analyses due to multicollinearity. All tables are found in the online appendix.
The educational stressors hypothesis was initially formulated to explain differential trends in mental health problems between girls and boys. This is explored in Tables S3 and S4 , which adds an interaction term between the focal predictor and gender. With school stress as the outcome ( Table S3 ), the effects of both GDP and attainment rate are significantly stronger for girls than for boys. With mental health problems as the outcome ( Table S4 ), the three-way interaction terms between gender, school stress, and GDP or attainment rate are in all cases close to zero and not significant. Thus, the argument that these educational stressors are of a greater importance for girls is only supported as regards levels of stress (exposure mechanism).
Table S5-S6 reproduces Table 2 but with satisfaction with life ( Tables S5 ) or somatic symptoms (i.e. the remaining four symptoms from the HBSC symptoms checklist; Table S6 ) as the outcomes. The results are qualitatively similar for GDP, that is, higher GDP is associated with a significantly stronger effect of school stress on both life satisfaction (negative interaction term) and somatic symptoms (positive interaction term). The interaction terms with attainment rate are, however, in both cases close to zero and far from significant.
Both GDP and tertiary attainment have been growing over time, which is partly dealt with through inclusion of time trends. As a final robustness check, Table 1 , Table 2 are reproduced with logarithmic transformations as well as lagged values of GDP and tertiary attainment rate. Tables S7 and S8 shows results using logarithmic transformations, meaning that the coefficients show effects of relative changes. The effect of GDP on school stress is diminished and turns insignificant, while the interaction terms between GDP and school stress with mental health problems as the outcome are stable, that is, positive and highly significant. The results for attainment rate are qualitatively similar for both outcomes. Tables S9 and S10 show results with lagged values of the predictors, specifically, GDP and attainment rate measured two years prior to the survey year. The effect of lagged GDP on school stress is positive but no longer significant, while the interaction terms with school stress and mental health problems as the outcome are stable. Lagged attainment rate has no effect on stress when including country-specific trends, while the interaction terms with school stress and mental health problems as the outcome remain significant.

Section: 5. Discussion and conclusions

The point of departure for this study was the educational stressors hypothesis, stating that greater emphasis on education contributes to more school stress and thereby mental health problems among adolescents. Two sub-versions of the hypothesis were formulated: one stating that economic change makes education more important for adolescents’ labour market prospects, and a second stating that educational expansion leads to intensified competition for access to (higher) education and thereby an intensified pressure to perform in school. Against this background, the present study asked two research questions: (1) Have economic change and educational expansion contributed to more school stress among adolescents? And (2) has the effect of school stress on mental health problems become stronger as a result of economic change and educational expansion? With regard to research question 1, results showed that higher GDP is robustly associated with higher stress (net of country and year fixed effects, as well as country-specific linear trends in stress), while results for tertiary attainment rates were mixed, with some models suggesting a negative effect of higher attainment. With regard to research question 2, results showed that the effect of stress on mental health problems becomes stronger as GDP and the attainment rates increase.
These results have implications for the educational stressors hypothesis. First, with mostly stable levels of school stress, it is unlikely that greater prevalence of stress have contributed to trends in mental health problems in more than a minority of countries (i.e. through the exposure mechanism; Fig. 1 ), which is consistent with recent findings by Cosma et al. (2020) and Löfstedt et al. (2020) . Nonetheless, the analysis suggests that economic changes, as measured by GDP, have positive effects on stress ( Table 1 ). Viewed in tandem, these two results suggest that average levels of stress among adolescents at the level of societies are affected by numerous factors, but that when other factors are held constant, economic changes (but not educational expansion) do contribute to more stress, as predicted by the educational stressors hypothesis. Second, with stable levels of school stress, but with this stress being increasingly consequential for mental health problems in many countries ( Fig. 2 ), school stress may have contributed to trends in mental health problems through the vulnerability mechanism. In this process, economic changes and (less robustly) educational expansion seem to have played a key role by strengthening the effect of stress on mental health problems ( Table 2 ), consistent with the educational stressors hypothesis.
As concerns the two sub-versions of the educational stressors hypothesis, the empirical results were strong and robust with regard to economic change, while results for educational expansion were more mixed. However, economic change and educational expansion tend to go together, and the empirical measures of these processes (GDP and tertiary attainment rate) are strongly correlated. Thus, based on these data it is not possible to determine with certainty which of these processes that are most important.
The educational stressors hypothesis was initially formulated to explain the relatively greater increase in mental health problems for girls compared to boys. While space limitations precludes a deeper investigation into gender differences , it is notable that the supplementary analyses showed that both economic change (GDP) and educational expansion (attainment rate) increased stress more among girls than among boys. These results, that girls are more sensitive to educational stressors, are in line with the original argument made by West and Sweeting (2003) . While West and Sweeting (2003) focus on proximate psychological explanations, for instance a greater inclination among girls to blame themselves for academic failures, a more structural explanation would take aim at the differential role played by educational performance for women and men in contemporary labour markets . First, with rising female labour force participation and delayed family formation, investing in education is more important for women today compared to for previous generations of women ( Pekkarinen, 2012 ). Second, formal educational credentials leaves less room for overt gender discrimination, and gives women access to high-paying job segments, such as managerial positions, that men have traditionally been able to access through other channels besides educational credentials ( Dougherty, 2005 ). Thus, the pressure to perform in school may be more strongly felt by girls, who have more to loose from failing.
The results of this study contributes to several strands of research. Most importantly, it is among the first studies to directly investigate effects of societal changes on trends in stress and mental health problems in adolescents. By doing so, it can shed light on previous comparative studies showing differences across countries in the role of school stress for the mental health and wellbeing of adolescents ( Diener et al., 1995 ; Sonmark et al., 2016 ; Cosma et al., 2020 ). Moreover, the study adds to a growing literature investigating the importance of contextual or societal influences on school stress among adolescents ( Sonmark et al., 2016 ; von der Embse et al., 2018 ; Löfstedt et al., 2020 ). In the context of this literature, one conclusion of this study is that societal trends can have substantial impacts on stress and mental health problems, and that spatial as well as temporal variation, that is, repeated cross-national data, is a fruitful way to tease out such impacts.
The results of this study should be interpreted while taking its limitations into account. One limitation concerns the measures used. The educational stressors hypothesis states that trends in adolescent mental health problems are shaped by a greater emphasis on education in society. However, the measures used in the study are upstream factors and not direct measures of the hypothesized mechanisms involved. Moreover, school stress was only measured with one item, which does not capture the full complexity of adolescent stress ( Byrne et al., 2007 ; Östberg et al., 2015 ; Löfstedt et al., 2020 ), and both stress and mental health problems were measured through self-reports, meaning that changes in these may reflect cultural shifts in reporting behavior. However, recent reviews have concluded that reporting behavior is probably not the main driver behind the increase in mental health problems observed in many countries ( Bor et al., 2014 ; Collishaw, 2015 ). Related to this, educational expansion (attainment rate) did not make the effect of school stress on life satisfaction (as opposed to mental health problems) stronger. While a deeper investigation of this is beyond the scope of this study, a tentative conclusion may be that the educational stressors hypothesis is less relevant as an explanation for trends in positive and evaluative aspects of mental health and wellbeing. Such a conclusion would also be in line with studies showing that, in contrast to mental health problems, life satisfaction among adolescents have been largely stable or only declined in a minority of European countries ( Cosma et al., 2020 ).
Another limitation is that HBSC does not include older adolescents. This would have been desirable given that the hypothesized mechanisms are arguably more salient for adolescents aged 18 or 19, for whom the transition from school to work or higher education is immanent ( Banks and Smyth, 2015 ). In addition, the data are cross-sectional at the individual level. Thus, the results with regard to research question 2 should be interpreted as showing that, as countries grow more wealthy and highly educated, stress is more strongly correlated with mental health problems for cohorts of students of a certain age. However, it is difficult to ascertain that stress also causes mental health problems. Related to this, time-varying confounding at the country-level cannot be ruled out. For instance, a common competing hypothesis with regard to trends in mental health problems posits that adolescents have become more individualistic and post-materialistic ( Bremberg, 2015 ; Collishaw, 2015 ; Sweeting et al., 2010 ). This alternative hypothesis could not be tested directly due to lack of adequate data in HBSC, and omitting such factors may bias the results.
In conclusion, this study has shown that levels of school stress among European adolescents was largely stable, but that the effect of this stress on mental health problems became stronger, between 2002 and 2014. Economic change but not educational expansion had a net positive effect on levels of school stress, and both economic change and educational expansion contributed to making school stress more consequential for mental health problems. Thus, economic change and educational expansion has likely contributed to increases in mental health problems among adolescents.
These results imply that policymakers ought to focus on making education systems and labour markets more inclusive for adolescents and youths. For instance, more inclusive education systems could allow more adolescents to access higher education, thus lessening the competition for positions in educational institutions and alleviating the pressure for competitive grades or test scores. Inclusive alternative access routes, for instance opportunities for second chance education, may also alleviate stress in school, since students will feel that failing today will not be as detrimental for their future prospects ( Högberg, 2019 ). Not least, opportunities for high quality vocational education could provide young workers without tertiary degrees access to secure and well-paid jobs, and thereby constitute a safety net for adolescents for whom staying in school is not an option.
