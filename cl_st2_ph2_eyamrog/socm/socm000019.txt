Title: Mental health effects of long work hours, night and weekend work, and short rest periods


Abstract: Abstract

Although the prior literature has examined the relationship between work schedule characteristics and worker mental health, establishing the causal effect of work schedule characteristics is challenging because of endogeneity issues. This paper investigates how various work schedule characteristics affect workers' mental health using employee surveys and actual working hours recorded over seventeen months in a Japanese manufacturing company. Our sample includes 1334 white-collar workers and 786 blue-collar workers observed from 2015 to 2016. Our major findings are as follows: long working hours cause the mental health of white-collar workers to deteriorate even after controlling for individual fixed effects . Furthermore, working on weekends is associated with mental ill health—the negative effect of an hour increase in weekend work is one and a half to two times larger than that of weekday overtime work for white-collar workers. On the other hand, short rest periods are not associated with mental health for them. Our results indicate that taking a relatively long rest period on weekends is more important for keeping white-collar workers healthy than ensuring a sufficient daily rest period. Regarding blue-collar workers, our analysis reveals that working after midnight is associated with mental ill health, whereas short rest periods are not associated with their mental health. This suggests that the strain of night work is a more important determinant of mental health for blue-collar workers. The differences in the relationship between work schedule characteristics and workers’ mental health for white-collar and blue-collar workers can be explained in terms of different work styles, different expectations, and different degrees of selection. We conclude that working for long hours or irregular hours deteriorates the mental health of workers but its impact is likely to differ significantly across job types.

Section: 1. Introduction

Mental health problems in working populations are prevalent in many countries. The OECD has estimated that approximately 20% of working-age adults have mental health problems ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2012 ). These problems not only induce personal suffering but also burden our society economically. The ILO has reported that the cost of work-related mental health problems, including both expenditures for treatment and loss of potential labor supply, amounts to 3–4% of the gross domestic product in Europe ( ILO 2000 ).
Evidence is growing that various types of job stressors, including workplace conditions, can influence the onset and progress of mental health problems ( Memish et al., 2017 ; Deloitte, 2017 ). One of the main conditions affecting workers' mental health is working hours. Some empirical research suggests a close relationship between working hours and workers' mental health (e.g. Martens et al., 1999 ; Kim et al., 2013 ; Kato et al., 2014 ; Kuroda and Yamamoto, 2016 ). In addition to the number of working hours, however, other work schedule characteristics, such as the frequency of night work and short daily rest periods (quick return), can affect workers' health as work-related stressors ( Caruso et al., 2006 ; Vedaa et al., 2016 , Costa, 2003 ). This issue of how working unusual hours may affect worker health is attracting more attention because social and industrial changes have increased flexibility in work schedules; an increasing number of workers are required to work the night shift or otherwise irregular hours ( Johnson and Lipscomb, 2006 ). The purpose of this paper is to investigate which of four work schedule characteristics (long work hours, night work, weekend work, and short rest period) affect workers’ mental health and to what extent by combining personnel data, administrative attendance records and mental status information collected from an employee survey provided by a Japanese manufacturing company.
While some literature has examined the relationship between working schedule characteristics and worker mental health, establishing the causal effect of work schedule characteristics is challenging. For example, there is individual heterogeneity in vulnerability to mental health problems, and much of that heterogeneity is unobserved and omitted from analyses. Workers with mental toughness may remain healthy even if they work long hours. By contrast, workers with mental health problems are likely to have lower productivity, which in turn forces them to work longer than healthy workers would. Such endogeneity of working hours may cause estimation bias. Except for a very small number of studies using longitudinal data, a majority of prior studies do not control for unobserved worker heterogeneity (e.g. Flo et al., 2014 ). Moreover, measurement error may also bias the estimation, as the previous literature has often used retrospective data for working hours, which may be influenced by the respondent's mental health. Another type of endogeneity bias that may come from using self-reported longitudinal survey data is that workers with mental ill health are more likely to drop out of the cohort sample. This attribution problem is called the “healthy worker effect” ( Li and Sung, 1999 ; Watanabe et al., 2016 ).
Given these challenges, the main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, while most other studies use self-reported retrospective data for hours worked in a particular week, we use actual working hours recorded by the firm's attendance management system over seventeen months, which may contribute to reducing measurement errors. Moreover, since the turnover rate is very low in this firm, using this firm's administrative data, which covers all regular employees, minimizes sample attrition biases. As in the case of most large manufacturing firms in Japan , the annual turnover rate (from 2015 to 2016; the time period on which this paper focuses) of this firm was less than 2 percent. Therefore, selection bias due to voluntary quits should be less of a concern. Second, the use of attendance records also allows us to exploit detailed information on work schedules (i.e. from the start to the end of each day), enabling us to experiment with various types of work schedule characteristics, including overtime working hours, hours worked after midnight, frequency of short rest periods, and frequency of weekend work. Note that much of the previous literature has investigated only one type of work schedule characteristic. This paper addresses multiple work schedule characteristics of workers at the same firm so that we can more comprehensively examine what work schedule patterns affect workers' mental health status.
Third, by combining these data with longitudinal personnel records, we can prevent firm, occupation, or worker heterogeneity from confounding the relationship between work schedule characteristics and mental health. All of the workers in the study sample work for the same firm, and the occupation and workplace information allow us to control for the influence of differences in tasks and workplace environment. We further account for unobservable individual characteristics by estimating the model with worker fixed effects .
In summary, our empirical analyses reveal that long working hours may cause white-collar workers' mental health to deteriorate even after controlling for individual fixed effects. Furthermore, we find that working on weekends may be associated with white-collar workers’ mental ill health. The negative effect toward mental health of an hour increase in weekend work is one and a half to two times larger than that of weekday overtime work. On the other hand, short rest periods are not associated with mental health for white-collar workers. Our finding implies that ensuring a prolonged weekly rest period is more effective than securing a minimum daily rest period, at least for white-collar workers. Regarding blue-collar workers, our analysis found that working after midnight may be associated with mental ill health, whereas short rest periods are not associated with mental health for blue-collar workers.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 surveys the related literature, Section 3 explains the dataset, and Section 4 presents the empirical strategy. Section 5 explains the results, and Section 6 provides a discussion and conclusions.

Section: 2. Related literature

Based on Caruso et al. (2006) , this paper focuses on four work schedule characteristics that affect worker health problems: overall working hours, night work, frequency of short rest periods, and working on weekends. The following sections briefly review (A) related mechanisms and (B) the previous literature on the relationship between each of the four work schedule characteristics and workers’ mental health. (A) Review of mechanisms
The theory of job stressors explains that not only workload but also work characteristics are key factors in the deterioration of workers’ health ( Karasek, 1979 ; Siegrist, 1996 ). Caruso et al. (2006) provided a comprehensive framework for the study of long work hours and their health and safety effects. Their framework described that long working hours and other work schedule characteristics such as night and weekend shifts and short rest periods can lead to increased exposure to work-related stress and reduced time for other activities that enable recovery from work. Such unbalance between workload and recovery from exhaustion can be associated with a wide variety of outcomes, such as physical and mental illness.
The number of people working during nonstandard and irregular operating hours is increasing as a result of changes in macrolevel social factors such as the growth of the service industry ( Johnson and Lipscomb, 2006 ). Night work can have a negative effect on workers’ health and well-being in terms of biological and social dimensions. From a biological viewpoint, night work can disturb normal circadian rhythms related to the sleep/wake cycle ( Boivin and Boudreau, 2014 ). With respect to the social dimension, workers who perform night work have difficulties maintaining normal relationships with family and community members ( Costa, 1996 ).
Taking enough rest after work can prevent worker fatigue from reaching unhealthy levels. The Council of the European Working Time Directive requires organizations to ensure that every worker is entitled to a minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours per 24-h period (European Parliament, Council of the European Union 2003). Moreover, not only daily short rest periods but also longer rest periods, such as weekends, are important factors that affect individual health and performance ( Sonnentag and Bayer, 2005 ). Most employees usually exploit their weekends as an opportunity to recover from the exhaustion accumulated during their workweek. (B) Evidence of the effect on worker mental health
Although several review articles have been published that address the influence of working long hours on workers’ mental health ( Van der Hulst, 2003 ; Fujino et al., 2006 , Bannai et al., 2015 ; Virtanen et al., 2018 ), the evidence they provide is inconclusive. For example, Fujino et al. (2006) report that, of seventeen studies reviewed, seven find positive association, one shows a negative association, and nine reveal no significant relationships between working hours and mental burden indicators such as self-reported depression symptoms. In a recent review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies from 35 countries, Virtanen et al. (2018) find that long working hours are modestly associated with an increased risk of new-onset depressive symptoms (odds ratio of 1.14 when long working hours is defined as working 55 h or more). Moreover, they also reveal that although a moderate association between working hours and depressive symptoms is found in Asian countries, the association is weak for European countries and absent for North America.
Previous studies, however, have had difficulty establishing the causal impact of working hours on workers' mental health because they have not necessarily addressed the problem of biases derived from the endogeneity of working hours ( Van der Hulst, 2003 ). For example, workers with mental toughness may remain healthy even if they work long hours, which tends to negatively bias the association between working hours and mental health indicators . By contrast, workers with mental health problems are likely to have lower productivity, which in turn forces them to work longer than healthy workers would, resulting in a positive but not causal association between the two factors. There may be other confounding factors that could either reinforce or reduce the correlation between working hours and mental health, such as work characteristics including job demand, job control, superiors' and coworkers’ support in the workplace. Consequently, the estimated impact of hours worked using OLS regression can be either upward or downward biased. Heterogeneity in the estimated effect reported in prior studies may simply imply that different sources of endogeneity bias dominate in one direction or the other in different contexts.
To the best of our knowledge, only two studies utilize longitudinal information in order to account for time-invariant confounding factors ( Oshio et al., 2015 ; Kuroda and Yamamoto, 2016 ). Both apply fixed-effects models to longitudinal data on Japanese workers and show that long working hours could be one of the main sources of deterioration in workers’ mental health even after controlling for worker characteristics and various workplace and job conditions. In addition to controlling for individual fixed effects, our paper aims to achieve higher internal validity by using information collected not from a retrospective survey but from administrative attendance records. Imai et al. (2016) has reported that the correlation between self-reported working hours for daily time period and those based on company records were 0.74. Improving accuracy of measurement for daily working hours is substantially important because our research uses the measures of work schedule characteristics such as the amount of night work and daily rest period for which it is necessary to record the start and end times of work precisely. We also argue that using a sample of workers under the same management in the same industry and control for major job characteristics from personnel records help us to limit work-related confounding factors thus leading to higher internal validity.
With respect to the relationship between night work and workers’ mental health, based on a review of the literature, Angerer et al. (2017) conclude that although there is evidence that nighttime shift work increases the risk of depression (at least in occupations outside the health sector), the evidence is not sufficiently strong. Angerer et al. (2017) note that such studies also need to account for individual heterogeneity because there is a “healthy worker effect” in which sick individuals are likely to switch from shift work to daytime work; that is, only healthy workers continue to work after midnight. For example, among eldercare and health care workers , Nabe-Nielsen et al. (2011) report that shift workers have higher vitality and better mental health than day workers. Some studies attempt to account for the healthy worker effect by using cohort data, such as Thun et al. (2014) , who report that nurses who changed from day work to night work during the study period do not differ from day workers in terms of symptoms of anxiety or depression (see also Norder et al. (2015) reporting similar results using data of male production workers). On the contrary, Beltagy et al. (2018) report evidence that changing from day to night work (or night to day work) is statistically associated with increased (decreased) odds of acquiring mental disorders. None of these studies however, account for individual unobserved heterogeneity in order to cope with the healthy worker effect. Our paper further investigates whether the findings reported in these previous articles remain when a fixed-effects model is used.
Most studies of short rest periods focus on workers engaged in shift or rotating work. Vedaa et al. (2016) perform a systematic review of five papers examining nurses or physicians and two papers studying workers performing shift work at manufacturing companies. They find no associations between short rest periods and mental health. Only a few papers analyze the consequences of short rest periods for the mental health of general workers who usually work daytime schedules. Ikeda et al. (2017) and Tsuchiya et al. (2017) are two of the few studies examining the association between a daily rest period and mental health for white-collar workers with no shift or rotating work. Based on observations of fifty-four daytime employees at a company for a month, Ikeda et al. (2017) find that a short daily rest period of fewer than 13 h is not adequate for participants to recover from fatigue. Tsuchiya et al. (2017) examine 1811 daytime employees and find that short daily rest periods are associated with high psychological distress. However, this association disappears after controlling for covariates such as age, gender, hours worked per week, workload and social support . The same endogeneity issues associated with the effect of long working hours on workers’ mental health are present for the relationship between short rest periods and mental health. Most of the papers described above do not control for time-invariant factors among individuals or any changes in work characteristics.
Lastly, regarding the effect of weekend work, using longitudinal data, Fritz and Sonnentag (2005) find that social activity during the weekend negatively predicts burnout and poor general well-being. This result implies that working on weekends may deprive workers of the chance to recover from fatigue and may decrease time spent with family and friends. Using data on British munition workers in the 1930s, Pencavel (2015) provide evidence that the loss in output from denying workers a day of rest on Sunday is approximately 10%. Although these studies incidentally provide evidence of a negative effect of working weekends, few papers specifically examine the relationship between working on weekends and mental health. One exception is Tucker et al. (2015) , who investigate this relationship using cross-sectional data. Although those authors show that weekend work is not significantly associated with burnout, stress and fatigue, the results may be biased due to the “healthy worker effect”. We still need to investigate the relationship between weekend work and mental health while controlling for various confounding factors using a longitudinal design.

Section: 3. Data and measures

This paper uses the personnel records provided by a Japanese consumer goods manufacturing company, C-Dur Corporation, which is a fictitious name used to protect the company's privacy. C-Dur Corporation was established in the 1940s and employs over 10,000 regular employees, including affiliated firms. This dataset includes (1) employees' daily attendance records, (2) responses to the employee survey , (3) employee characteristics (gender, age, education, marital status, etc.), (4) pay and benefit records, and (5) job assignment history records, which identify the department unit to which each employee belongs. For blue-collar workers, daily attendance records are derived from employees' time card data. Although data for white-collar workers are based on self-reported attendance records, HR staff investigated any cases that showed persistent differences between the time reported by the employee and the time when the employee shuts down his/her personal computer . This verification process should ensure the accuracy of daily attendance data for white-collar workers. These time attendance data are available from July 2015 to November 2016. Therefore, we use the personnel records for two years, 2015 and 2016. Ethical approval or employees' consent for our research was not necessary because the data sets we use are existing personnel records from a large Japanese manufacturing company that have been anonymized (i.e. individual employees cannot be identified). According to the ethical guideline for medical research involving human subjects (issued in 2014 by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare), such studies are exempted from the requirement of informed consent. Japanese personal information protection law also allows firms to provide academic institutions with anonymized personal information without informed consent of their employees. For these reasons, the institutional review board at Waseda University issued a letter exempting this study from ethical review.
As the time and attendance data include work start and end times for each date, we can construct four measures of work schedule characteristics. The first is the number of overtime hours worked. C-Dur Corporation sets regular work hours as 7 h and 55 min per day. Consequently, we define overtime hours as hours worked over 7 h and 55 min each day. The second is the number of hours worked after midnight, which measures hours worked between 12 o'clock midnight and the end time for work. The third measure is the frequency of short daily rest periods, which is defined as the incidence of fewer than 11 h between the end time of work and the start time of work on consecutive days. The last measure is the frequency of working on weekend days, namely, Saturday and Sunday. If a worker works on both Saturday and Sunday, regardless of the total hours, the count is two weekend workdays per week.
We use 2 months as a measurement period for calculating each work schedule characteristic. Thus, we examine the effect of two-month accumulated fatigue before the employment survey (for more details, see section 3.3 ) is conducted. In the appendix , we also report two additional measurement periods besides two months before the employee survey was conducted, i.e. one month and two weeks, to examine whether the effect varies by the length of the measurement period.
We use a section of responses to the annual employee survey, which started in 2010 in consultation with the firm's occupational physicians. All regular employees of C-Dur Corporation answer this survey every year with a response rate of nearly 100% (white and blue-collar, 98% and 94%, respectively)—only those who are on temporary assignments abroad or those on leave are missing. This survey is conducted for two weeks period at the end of September and includes a question that asks the employees to self-assess their mental health status. The respondent chooses the most appropriate description of their mental health status among four choices as follows: “1. My mental status is healthy”; “2. I feel a little mental burden”; “3. I feel a considerable mental burden”; and “4. I am consulting a doctor for my mental health problem.” According to our analysis of the responses in 2011–2016, the transition probabilities from the above answers 1, 2, and 3 in year t to 4 in year t + 1 are 0.3%, 1.19%, and 3.48%, respectively, implying that the measure could be used as a risk indicator of the onset of depressive disorders.
We restricted the sample to regular employees in nonmanagerial positions. We also excluded those who selected the final option in the mental health status question (“4. I am consulting a doctor for my mental health problem”) in the employee survey because according to C-Dur Corporation, workers who chose “4” are put under special consideration with a reduced assignment and forced to work less hours. This is a typical measure recommended for employers based on Japan's Labor Contracts Act (for further details, see Section 6 ). We omit these samples in order to exclude reverse causality. Twenty five (1.8%) and twenty one (1.5%) employees chose this most serious mental health status in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We believe the selection bias caused by this omission is negligible as we discuss more formally later because the share of employees who are receiving medical treatment for mental illness was relatively small and unchanged between the two years. We also dropped those who had no attendance during the measurement period because these employees may be taking leave or seconded to a subsidiary.
The sample has two occupational subgroups: blue-collar workers engaged in manual production tasks in factories and white-collar workers engaged in other functions, mostly in offices. We conducted estimations for both types of workers separately because their jobs are governed by different work rules. While white-collar workers are daytime workers, blue-collar workers are shift workers who are engaged in day and night shifts. Despite the differences in their work schedules, we employ all the four work schedule measures for both groups because of the non-negligible shares of both work after midnight and during weekends—according to the department-level aggregate data, employees work after midnight for more than an hour on average in 4% and 16% of the white-collar and blue-collar departments, respectively, while they work for a day or more during weekends per month in 67% and 53% of the white-collar and blue-collar departments, respectively. Although working during weekends is quite common for both white and blue-collar workers, the percentage of working after midnight for white-collar workers is relatively small compared to that of blue-collar workers. Therefore, we need to keep in mind that the coefficient of working after midnight is likely to be biased due to this selection for white-collar workers. Those who work after midnight are likely to be limited to special roles, such as engineers solving plant process/quality problems, campaign organizers in marketing or task force staff for managerial missions, etc.
Our sample restrictions result in final samples of 1334 white-collar workers and 786 blue-collar workers.
Summary statistics are presented in Table 1 for white-collar workers and Table 2 for blue-collar workers. On average, the mental health indicator for both worker groups is between 1 and 2, that is, somewhere between healthy and feeling a little mental burden. Average overtime work hours of blue-collar workers are longer than those of white-collar workers. Average working hours after midnight and frequency of working on weekends are much higher for blue-collar workers than for white-collar workers, as blue-collar workers perform shift work and experience night shifts and weekend shifts from time to time.

Table 3 , Table 4 compare the means of each work characteristic measure for the two-month measurement period in 2015 and 2016 by level of mental health status for each job subgroup. Table 3 shows that white-collar workers with worse mental status tend to have worked longer, worked more hours after midnight, worked more often on weekends, and returned more often after very short rest periods. These findings imply that not only the length of working hours but also working the night shift, short rest periods and working on weekends may be associated with workers’ mental health, at least for white-collar workers. On the other hand, Table 4 does not show such a systematic relationship for blue-collar workers. Table 3 . Descriptive statistics for white-collar workers.

Section: 4. Estimation strategy

First, we convert the category variable representing mental health status into a binary dependent variable and estimate linear probability models because the simple ordered logit model does not allow us to include worker fixed effects. We estimate the following linear probability model with individual fixed effects in which the dependent variable is the indicator of having mental burdens: (1) Y i t = β’ X i t + γ k W o r k S c h e d u l e k i t + α i + u i t
Y i t denotes the indicator variable of having mental burdens, which takes a value of 1 if worker i chose either “2. I feel a little mental burden” or “3. I feel a considerable mental burden” and 0 if he or she chose “1. My mental status is healthy” as his/her mental health status in the employee survey conducted in year t . W o r k S c h e d u l e k i t represents the four work schedule characteristic measures denoted by k , including total overtime hours worked, total work hours after midnight, the total number of returns to work after a daily rest period of fewer than 11 h, and the total number of incidents of working on weekend days. X i t represents a vector of control variables including age, age squared, hourly wage (annual income divided by annual total hours worked), salesperson dummy, year dummy, the number of working days and the number of business trips during the measurement period. α i represents the worker fixed effect, which represents the influence of time-invariant individual characteristics. Robust standard errors are used. Note that the year dummy is dropped during the estimation since we use a two-year panel dataset and therefore the year dummy has multicollinearity with age.
One of the concerns we have is selection bias. As noted in Section 3.4 , workers who reported that they were consulting with doctor for their mental health problem were omitted from the sample in order to avoid reverse causality. Let d i t be the indicator of being in the sample for worker i in year t. A sufficient condition for our model to be consistent is E [ u i t − u i s | X i t , X i s , W o r k S c h e d u l e k i t , W o r k S c h e d u l e k i s , d i t = d i s = 1 ] = 0 .
This condition holds if the distribution of u i t conditional on d i t = 1 does not change from year t to year s . Given the very stable workforce with limited turnover, the major factor that affects the conditional distribution of u i t should be the business environment for C-Dur Corporation, which determines the resources available for workplaces. The business environment did not change between 2015 and 2016, with low return on equity (ROE) at the 3–4% level reflecting a weak economy in both years. Another piece of evidence in support of this claim is that the number of employees who reported to be consulting a doctor for their mental health problem did not change noticeably between the two years (twenty-five and twenty-one, respectively). Furthermore, the number of individuals who were dropped due to lack of reporting was minimal, and thus systematic sorting is very unlikely. We judge that selection bias should be negligible.
The linear probability model with worker fixed effects controls for time-invariant unobserved individual characteristics. However, if there are unobserved time-variant, individual factors, u i t may still be correlated with the incidence of certain work schedule characteristics causing bias in the estimation results for the fixed effect model.
Next, we estimate the following latent variable model with ordered multiple outcomes and unobserved individual heterogeneity: Y i t ∗ = β’ X i t + γ k W o r k S c h e d u l e k i t + α i + u i t (2) Y i t = j if μ j < Y i t ∗ ≤ μ j + 1 j ∈ { 1,2,3 }
Y i t ∗ is a latent variable for Y i t , which denotes the category of the mental health status (i.e. the three levels explained in Section 3.3 ) that a worker i chose. Explanatory variables are the same as those in equation (1) . α i represents time-invariant, individual fixed effects.
We estimate the Blow-up and Cluster (BUC) model, which Baetschmann et al. (2015) propose as an extension of conditional maximum likelihood estimators for a fixed-effects logit model to a model with ordered limited dependent variables. The parameters in the above model are estimated inconsistently when we use the ordered logit model with individual dummy variables because the incidental parameter problem exists ( Lancaster, 2000 ). This problem contaminates the estimation of parameters, as each α i depends on finite T period observations, but there are too many α i since the total number of observations NT grows infinitely. The BUC model is a remedy for this incidental parameter problem, The BUC estimate is a variant of the CML (Conditional Maximum Likelihood) estimators, and it dichotomizes the ordered variable at each cut-off point j . The standard errors are computed by clustering at the individual level. The BUC model uses all available information and produces consistent estimators ( Baetschmann et al., 2015 ). Riedl and Geishecker (2014) report that the BUC estimator performs best in finite samples when comparing linear and nonlinear ordered response estimators in terms of consistency and efficiency by running Monte Carlo simulations . For reference, we also report our estimation results using a simple ordered logit model for comparison in the appendix .

Section: 5. Results

Table 5 shows the results from the analysis of the fixed-effect linear probability model for white-collar workers. In all of our model specifications, age, age squared, hourly wage, salesperson dummy, the number of working days, and the number of business trips are controlled for but omitted from the table. In models 1 to 4, we include each work schedule characteristic measure separately, whereas in model 5, we include all four measures at once. The coefficients of overtime and working on weekends are significantly positive in models 1 and 4. By contrast, the coefficients of the two other work characteristic measures are positive but not significant, as shown in models 2 and 3. When all four work schedule characteristics are simultaneously included in model 5, the coefficients of overtime and working on weekends still remain the same in magnitude and statistically significant. These results indicate that long working hours may deteriorate workers’ mental health, although the effects of strain coming from midnight work or short rest periods cannot be confirmed. Table 5 .

Measurement period: 2 months Dependent variable: Mental health status dummy (0:“Healthy”, 1:“Having a little mental burden” or“Having a great mental burden”) Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 Overtime (total) 0.0017*** 0.0019** [0.0007] [0.0009] Working after Midnight 0.0006 0.0000 0.0006 [0.0020] [0.0018] [0.0019] Short Rest Period 0.0039 −0.0063 −0.0065 [0.0051] [0.0066] [0.0068] Working on Weekends 0.0252*** 0.0209** [0.0083] [0.0089] Overtime (weekdays) 0.0015*** 0.0021** [0.0007] [0.0010] Overtime (weekends) 0.0032** 0.0033** [0.0016] [0.0016] Controls: Age, working days, hourly wage, Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes sales dummy, the number of business trips Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Observation 1334 1334 1334 1334 1334 1334 1334 Notes: Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. *p < .1; **p < .05; ***p < .01.
To check the robustness and the effect size, we further included two different overtime variables; the number of overtime hours worked only during weekdays and the number of work hours during weekends. The results are shown in models 6 and 7. The results indicate that an hour increase in overtime work during weekdays raises the probability of feeling mental burden by 0.21 percent, whereas an hour increase in weekend work lifts the probability by 0.33 percent, which is one and a half times as large as the effect of an overtime hour during weekdays. We have calculated the predicted probability that white-collar workers with the average overtime hours during weekdays or weekend being the j-th decile become feeling mental burden and illustrated these predicted probabilities in Fig. 1 (We calculated the same probability for blue-collar workers with the average midnight work being the j-th decile). The results show that an increase in overtime hours during weekdays and weekends from 10 percentile to 90 percentile raises the probability of feeling mental burden by 16.4% and 7.7%, respectively. Since a majority of workers do not work at all or work only occasionally during weekends, the variation of weekend work is much smaller than overtime work during weekdays. As a result, when comparing the marginal effects of the two in terms of the same percentile increase, an increase in the former looks smaller than that in the latter. In order to present more comparable figures, we have calculated the effects of an increase in overtime hours of 35.2 h, which is one standard deviation of total overtime hours. Such increases in overtime hours for weekdays and weekends raise the probability of feeling mental burden by 7.4% and 11.6%, respectively. This result indicates that the negative effect of working long hours, especially during weekends, is substantial and that taking a relatively long rest period on weekends is more important for keeping white-collar workers healthy than ensuring a sufficient daily rest period.

Table 6 shows the results for blue-collar workers using the same model specifications as for white-collar workers. In models 2, 5, and 7, the coefficient of working after midnight is significantly positive. A 1-h increase in night work raises the probability of feeling mental stress by 0.17% and an increase in night work from 10 percentile to 90 percentile raises the probability by 14.3% as shown in Fig. 1 . When hours of night work increase by one standard deviation, which is 38.6 h, this probability increases by 6.6%. These results indicate that the negative effect of night work is substantial, at least for blue-collar workers. Once again, ensuring a sufficient daily rest period does not help to relieve this burden. Table 6 . Estimation for linear probability with fixed-effects model (blue-collar workers).

We have also estimated the linear probability model with fixed effects using another indicator variable, which takes a value of 1 if the employee chose “3. I feel a considerable mental burden” and 0 if he or she chose either “1. My mental status is healthy”, or “2. I feel a little mental burden”, as a dependent variable. However, the results show that all the coefficients of work schedule characteristics are not significant at the 5% level. This may be due to that a very small share of the employees chose “3. I feel a considerable mental burden” (6.52% and 8.40% for white-collar and blue-collar workers, respectively) and that unobservable heterogeneity such as personality and the relationship in the workplace plays a more important role in reporting worse mental condition to the firm.
Table 7 shows the results of the BUC model for white-collar workers. In this estimation, the sample size was substantially reduced due to the fact that mental health status in almost two thirds of the sample was unchanged for two consecutive years (note that the BUC model does not use samples with no change in the dependent variable). However, we notice that the results in Table 7 are not qualitatively different from those obtained in the linear probability model in Table 5 : overtime and working on weekends are significantly associated with deteriorating mental health, and those relationships are not affected even if other work schedule measures are controlled for. Table 8 shows the results of the BUC model for blue-collar workers. The coefficient of Working after midnight is significantly positive in models 2 and 5, consistent with the linear probability model in Table 6 . Table 7 .

The key results obtained from Table 5 , Table 6 , Table 7 , Table 8 are summarized as follows: (1) working long hours may cause mental health to deteriorate even after correcting for biases due to time-invariant individual heterogeneity for white-collar workers; (2) working on weekends is also likely to impose risks to the mental health of white-collar workers; (3) working after midnight for a relatively long period may also cause a strain on blue-collar workers’ mental health. However, this relationship does not hold for white-collar workers: (4) although having a sufficient rest period has been emphasized as important among practitioners, a short rest period is not associated with deteriorating mental health for either white- or blue-collar workers in our analysis. The difference between job types in the relationship between work schedule characteristic measures and mental health may be explained in terms of different work styles and the resulting differences in expectations and selection of workers. This is discussed in the next section.

Section: 6. Discussion and conclusion

By combining personnel data, administrative attendance records and mental health status information collected from employee surveys provided by a Japanese manufacturing company, this paper takes into account individual heterogeneity and investigates the causal relationship between work schedule characteristics and workers' mental health. Specifically, this paper examines how four work schedule characteristics (long work hours, night work, weekend work, and short rest periods) affect workers’ mental health. We obtain four valuable findings.
First, long working hours are associated with workers’ deteriorating mental health even after correcting for a bias derived from unobservable individual heterogeneity for white-collar workers. This result is consistent with previous studies ( Kuroda and Yamamoto, 2016 , Virtanen et al., 2011 , 2012 and 2018 ) and implies that working long hours may cause white-collar workers to have a higher risk of onset of depressive disorders. For the purpose of comparison with prior studies, we calculated the odds ratio for feeling mental burden associated with long working hours exceeding 55 h per month based on the linear probability with a fixed-effects model where bias due to individual heterogeneity is controlled for (not reported in the paper). The obtained odds ratios are 1.922 and 1.306 for white-collar and blue-collar workers, respectively, which is higher than the average of 1.14 from the meta-analysis in Virtanen et al. (2018) . We have confirmed that the difference can be mostly explained by the fact that the bias due to individual heterogeneity is corrected for in our study (see our discussion in Appendix A3 ). Many previous studies are presumably affected by the healthy worker effect.
Second, we find that working on weekends for a relatively long period may cause white-collar workers’ (but not blue-collar workers') mental health to deteriorate, consistent with previous studies ( Beltagy et al., 2018 ). Working on weekends deprives workers of not only respite time but also time with family and friends. Some empirical research has shown the importance of weekends for recovery. Karhula (2017) examine the relationship between objective work schedule characteristics and work–life conflict in day and shift work using longitudinal data and find that weekend work is associated with work–life conflict. Binnewies et al. (2010) find that psychological detachment from work, relaxation, and experiencing challenging off-job activities during the weekend predict a better recovery state after the weekend. Along the same line of thought, it may be effective policy for reducing the mental stress to encourage workers to take their full holiday entitlement. Given the fact that average paid days taken per year in Japan is eight to nine days, which is only about 50 percent of annual entitlement, many Japanese firms now set this goal to make their employees to stay health and productive.
Third, working after midnight for a relatively long period causes blue-collar workers’ mental health to worsen. Fourth, short rest periods are not associated with mental health for both white-collar and blue-collar workers. These findings imply that guaranteeing a prolonged weekly rest period is more important than ensuring a minimum daily rest period, at least for white-collar workers, and that the strain coming from night work is a more important determinant of mental health for blue-collar workers.
When comparing the effect sizes of the four work schedule characteristics, our results indicate that the negative effect of an hour increase in work hours during weekends on mental health is one and a half to two as large as that of overtime hours during weekdays. Another implication from the results is that not only managing the amount of total working hours but also ensuring a relatively long weekly rest period—at least a day or two–are important, especially for white-collar workers.
The difference between white-collar vs. blue-collar workers in the relationship between working on weekends/after midnight and mental health may have a number of explanations. First, the blue-collar workers in C-Dur Corporation primarily work in shifts, and therefore most of them work on weekends once in a while. On the other hand, the white-collar workers in C-Dur Corporation are daytime workers and are usually off on weekends; therefore, working on weekends is not taken as a matter of course for them, except for a small number of jobs such as production engineers. In fact, Table 1 , Table 2 show that the mean hours of weekend work for blue-collar workers is more than twofold greater than that for white-collar workers. Then, the prospect theory would predict that the reference point for most white-collar workers is not to work during weekends (i.e. spend quality time with their family and friends), and their loss aversion is likely to make them feel conflicted when they are compelled to work unexpectedly on weekends.
The second interpretation is a difference in the degree of selection between blue-collar workers and white-collar workers. Working after midnight is less uncommon among shift workers, and thus a majority of blue-collar workers experience night work once in a while. On the other hand, it is much rarer for white-collar workers to experience working after midnight, and such experiences are usually limited to special roles, such as engineers solving plant process/quality problems, campaign organizers in marketing or task force staff for managerial missions, etc. Therefore, the result that working after midnight has no significant effect on white-collar workers may come from the fact that it is solely based on the variation for a small group of employees, and may be subject to the “healthy worker effect.”
There are three issues that need to be addressed or explored in our future research. First, the results obtained in this paper are derived from only one firm's dataset, so external validity may be rather limited. For example, consistent with the fact that C-Dur Corporation is a highly regarded company, the distribution of working hours has a very thin tail . Namely, there were no extremely long working hour samples in our data. One reason why we did not find any relationship between short rest periods and mental health may be the lack of a tail in the distribution. Datasets from other companies with more variations in working patterns are needed to investigate which regulations regarding the rest period are necessary to maintain good mental health for workers in the future.
Second, the measure of mental health used in this paper has not been shown to be valid in the sense that its correlation with widely-used test of mental health risk is not known, and thus reexamination with different valid psychometric measures is necessary in the future. The Japanese government introduced a new occupational health policy called the Stress Check Program with the amendment of the Industrial Safety and Health Law in 2014, which became effective on December 1, 2015. The program screens for workers with high psychosocial stress at least once per year in all establishments with 50 or more employees. According to Tsutsumi et al. (2018) , the Japanese stress check program screening tool predicts employee long-term sickness absence . The primary reason why we did not attempt to use the stress check data for this study is that there is a strict regulation that requires a firm to obtain approval from each employee to use the micro data. Using stress check data linked with administrative data to reexamine our findings remains as a future challenge.
Last but certainly not least is that although we have accounted for time-invariant factors by using fixed effects, we should also consider time-variant factors that would affect both changes in mental health status and work hours. For example, workers who work in a growing market may find many opportunities to develop businesses that lead to long working hours but at the same time may find the job rewarding and feel engaged by achieving performance goals. As shown in this example, the positive or negative work environment could cause a spurious correlation between mental health and working hours. The study by Kuroda and Yamamoto (2016) is one of a few attempts to examine the causal relationship between working long hours and workers’ mental health using the aggregate level of average work hours as an instrumental variable in order to control for unobserved time-variant and time-invariant individual heterogeneity. However, it is difficult to find valid and strong instruments to control for time-variant factors. Controlling for time-variant factors by using appropriate instruments remains for future work.
Despite the above limitations, our research shows that working for long hours, after midnight or during weekend tends to deteriorate workers’ mental health. Furthermore, such effects of work schedule characteristics on mental health may differ depending on the job type. This finding may imply that although many countries employ universal work-hour regulations for various types of workers, more segmental rules based on systematic studies across different occupations may be desirable.
