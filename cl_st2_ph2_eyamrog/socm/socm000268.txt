Title: Partnership and mortality in mid and late life: Protection or selection?


Abstract: Abstract

The main goal of this paper is to address how different partnership statuses impact the likelihood of death among mature adults and elderly persons in Spain circa 2012 using a massive new dataset of administrative registers linked to census data. First, gross and net effects of having a partner on mortality risks of partnered and non-partnered persons are evaluated; then the characteristics and the importance of selection and protection effects of marriage and partnership with regard to the likelihood of death are assessed. We make use of exact matching methods in order to avoid the selection bias associated with the non-random assignment of persons to different partnership statuses. Protection effects decline gradually with age, but always remain positive. Selection effects show a far more pronounced decline with age leading to a pattern in which selection is much stronger than protection during the mature adult ages, but then disappear entirely and even become negative as people age. While both sexes show similar patterns, the protection effect is slightly higher among men while the selection effect is much higher among women, especially before 65 years of age.

Section: 1. Introduction

There is a long-standing interest in the potential health implications of different kinds of living arrangement especially during adulthood and in later life. Much of the literature addresses the specific issue of the health effects of marital status, an indicator readily available for populations, past and present. Here the preferred indicator for health has been the likelihood of death. The nearly unanimous results of this research indicate that currently married persons are less likely to die than persons who are not married. In a country like Spain, for instance, period life tables for 2011 show that life expectancy for married women was 2.3 years higher than for unmarried women at age 45 (42.2 versus 39.9, or 6%) and 1.4 years at age 65 (23.5 versus 22.1, or 6%). The advantages for men are even greater: 45-year-old married men can expect to survive 37 years, 5.7 years (or 18%) more than unmarried men; at 65, the male married/unmarried differential is 3.6 years (or 22%). In sum, it is better to be married, at least with respect to death and probably with regard to overall health as well. The advantages of marriage appear to be greater among men and are more visible during mature adult life and the early stages of old age, and less among the very old ( Burgoa et al., 1998 ; Goldman, 1993 ; Goldman et al., 1995 ; Gove, 1973 ; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010 ; Hu and Goldman, 1990 ; Johnson et al., 2000 ; Kaplan and Kronik, 2006 ; Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton, 2001 ; Kisker and Goldman, 1987 ; Lillard and Panis, 1996 ; Livi-Bacci, 1984 ; Manzoli et al., 2007 ; Martikainen et al., 2005 ; Pechholdová and Šamanová, 2013 ; Robards et al., 2012 ; Valkonen et al., 2004 ).
More recently, there have been attempts to assess the specific effects of living arrangements on health ( Averett et al., 2013 ; Franke and Kulu, 2018 ; Koskinen et al., 2007 ; Martikainen et al., 2005 ; Poulain et al., 2016 ; Requena and Reher, 2020 ; Scafato et al., 2008 ; Staehelin et al., 2012 ; Zueras et al., 2020 ). These studies enhance our understanding of the links between living arrangements and health beyond the effect of marital status, but do not lead to substantially different results. People living with spouses and/or partners are at a distinct advantage with respect to health in comparison to those who live with others or those living alone. This effect is very strong among mature adults and tends to diminish gradually as people age. After 75 or 80 years of age, the advantage to living with a spouse or a partner tends to disappear with respect to those living alone and diminishes considerably with respect to those living with others. At all ages, especially during mature adulthood, the relative health disadvantage among men (either living alone or living with others) in comparison to partnered men is higher than it is among women ( Requena and Reher, 2020 ; Zueras et al., 2020 ).
A combination of selection effects associated with any union together with protection effects related to the ability of spouses and partners to intervene in matters of the health of their spouses help explain the health advantages associated with marriage and partnership. This has been conceptualized in the pertinent literature as the issue of marital protection versus marital selection. Does marriage (or partnership) enhance health and reduce the risk of mortality or are healthier people more likely selected into marriage (or partnership) ( Espinosa and Evans, 2008 ; Franke and Kulu, 2018 ; Fu and Noguchi, 2018 ; Goldman, 1993 ; Guner et al., 2018 ; Rendall et al., 2011 ; Waldron et al., 1996 )? A specific historical example of this can be found with students at Amherst College between 1860 and 1880 where more healthy students (as measured with height and body mass index data) were more likely to eventually marry than less healthy ones and eventually lived longer lives as well ( Murray, 2000 ). In this way, prior health was the gateway for marriage and both health and marriage intervened in longer lives. In the case of the Amherst students, marriage was selective for prior health but also provided additional protection for graduates later in life independent of their prior health status, leading the author to argue for the existence of both selection and protection effects related to marriage.
Simplifying somewhat, selection effects are mostly structural in nature and protection effects normally imply active interventions. The classic selection effect is prior health as a determinant for entry into marriage or, more recently, into partnership. People with very poor health are much less likely to enter into marriage than those with acceptable levels of health ( Cheung and Sloggett, 1998 ; Goldman, 1993 ). A Dutch local study using conscription registers between 1818 and 1861 showed that marriage was less frequent and later among men considered as ‘hunchbacked’, ‘crippled’, ‘too small’, or with ‘dilated backbone’ ( van Poppel, 1999 ; van Poppel and Joung, 2001 ). Selection, however, covers more attributes than just the prior health of potential spouses. It can indicate the existence of aptitudes or characteristics that may have long-term health advantages. Some of these may be health-related (mental health, severe physical impairment or alcoholism for example), while others are behavioral. Socioeconomic characteristics may also play a role: poor life chances, material disadvantages and meager economic perspectives can constrain the ability and willingness to find a suitable partner ( Edin and Reed, 2005 ).
Furthermore, marriage and partnership are positively selective for people inclined to share their lives with another person, people who are less individualistic and probably more willing to be flexible, as well as those who prefer the shared living environment that marriage and family-life provide. It is a marker for willingness to commit to a shared life with another person and could be greater for marriage than for partnership ( Rhoades et al., 2010 ; Willoughby et al., 2020 ). An extreme, but not surprising, example of this is the presence of love and respect for another person that, at the very least, exists at the outset of married life and may continue to do so many years later. All of these characteristics and attributes contribute not only to partner choice, but also to a more stable shared life where each partner is willing to intervene on behalf of the other ( Clarkberg et al., 1995 ; Moss and Willoughby, 2018 ; Ogolsky et al., 2016 ; Willoughby, 2015 ). In sum, the selection effect discussed here includes many different types of ‘fitness’, only one of which is related directly to initial health of a spouse or partner.
These are pre-existing conditions that influence entry into partnership and also condition the willingness and ability of partners and spouses to intervene in the lives of their partners. These interventions constitute the protection effects of marriage and partnership mentioned in the literature ( Waite and Gallagher, 2002 ; Wood et al., 2007 ). While related in part to the selection effect for entry into marriage, they imply the active intervention of the spouse in managing problems, especially health-related problems, as they appear with increasing frequency as people age ( Averett et al., 2013 ; Umberson, 1987). Spouses, especially women, tend to monitor and control their spouse's behavior and this limits the importance in married life of certain potentially detrimental health behaviors such as alcohol abuse or drug consumption, invariably lower among married or partnered people ( Dinescu et al., 2016 ; Duncan et al., 2006 ; Grundy and Tomassini, 2010 ; Pollitt et al., 2020 ; Umberson, 1992 ). Marriage, and more generally partnership, is a powerful source of emotional support and a barrier to several forms of psychological distress ( Gove et al., 1983 ). Depression and eventually suicide appear to be greater among non-partnered people than among those with spouses, with links that are stronger for men than for women and more prevalent in mid-life than during old age ( Bulloch et al., 2017 ; St John et al., 2009 ). Spouses can be in a position to monitor medication intake or visits to medical practitioners that tend to be more complete among married and partnered individuals ( Wu et al., 2012 ). In the case of the catastrophic health events that often affect later life (acute myocardial infarctions , falls and household accidents, strokes or even attempted suicide), the presence in the household of another person, in particular of a spouse or partner, can prove to be the difference between life and death. The protective shield against negative health events and conditions is unquestionably stronger and more effective for people who have a partner or a spouse in their lives. It is clear, on the other hand, that selection and protection effects for health are linked, with selection related to pre-existing conditions and protection taking place after the union but in many ways related, at least indirectly, to many of the same attributes that intervene at the outset.
The main goal of this paper is to compare statistically these two effects making use of data taken from contemporary Spain. Ideally, this type of exercise would be in the form of a population experiment where a large random selection of people were followed over long periods of their lives with full data on intervening health events, partnership status, individual characteristics and health outcomes. While this type of approach is not possible with contemporary data, with limited data it is theoretically possible for historical contexts, as shown in the often-cited study of John Murray (2000) . Here we will use an indirect approach, namely matching, designed to isolate the selection and protection effects affecting the likelihood of survival of mature adults and elderly persons during the early years of the twenty-first century. Our results will enable us to address key issues related to the relative importance of selection and protection for the survival of individuals, the way this changes by sex (are they more important for women or for men?) and how they change with age.
This paper has two main objectives. The first is to evaluate the net effect of having a partner on mortality risks of partnered and non-partnered persons in Spain circa 2011–2012. Here we estimate relative risks of death for both partnered and non-partnered mature adults and elderly men and women. Relative risks estimated within multivariable models will enable us to assess how important the partnership advantage is and how it changes by age and sex. This goal is not entirely new and is present in many of the empirical studies cited in this article. The value added here is to present the case of Spain using record linkage techniques and matching methods with contemporary data.
Our second aim is to explore the nature of the selection and the protection effects of marriage and partnership with regard to the likelihood of death among adults 45+. In order to implement this approach, we make use of specific partnership statuses in terms of how they relate to these effects. This classification is based on the following premises. Currently married/partnered persons should benefit from the full advantages of both the prior positive selection into partnership/marriage and the protection that married life provides ( Lillard and Waite, 1995 ). Currently widowed persons should show the prior positive selection into marriage, but no longer the protection it affords ( Boyle et al., 2011 ; Manzoli et al., 2007 ; Moon et al., 2011 ; Shor et al., 2012 ). Divorced or separated persons are in an analogous position as they have lost the partnership protection and are subject to the trauma and health implications of partner dissolution ( Bronselaer et al., 2008 ; Sbarra, 2015 ; Waldron et al., 1997 ). It is difficult to ascertain the extent to which separated or divorce persons benefit from the selection effect into marriage to the same extent than married or widowed people, though, at the very least, they were positively selected into marriage. Finally, never-married non-partnered persons will not show either the positive selection effect or the positive protection effect associated with marriage and partnership.
Based on these premises, the protection effect (based on relative risks) can be measured by the ratios of death rates of widowed, separated or divorced persons to death rates of married and partnered individuals; and the selection effect can be quantified by the rate ratios of never-married and never-partnered persons to death rates of widowed, separated or divorced persons. This strategy does not include the nuances or the history of partnered life, but does represent a feasible approach for assessing protection and selection effects in any given population.

Section: 2. Materials and methods

The analysis in this paper makes use of a new data set of linked administrative registers for Spain. Deaths taken from vital registers (Movimiento Natural de la Población) have been linked to data regarding the same individuals present in the 2011 census, including individual and household characteristics recorded in modern censuses (sex, age, marital status, education, country of birth, size of municipality and others). The Statistical Office of Spain (Instituto Nacional de Estadística, INE) provided all the data.
The linked data set consists of a sample of around 10% of the Spanish population living in households present on the 2011 census. These data do not include deaths of people not present in the census, either living in institutions or living abroad. More than 96% of the deaths included in the file extracted from vital statistics were successfully linked with census data. Non-linked deaths are not affected by any relevant selection factor and there are no substantial differences between distributions of deaths (by sex, age and marital status) in the linked data and in the set of all deaths recorded in the vital register for 2012. Apart from these unlinked and hence lost deaths, no additional restrictions or exclusions to our analytical sample were implemented. The final operational sample includes 2,068,085 individual observations of men and women 45+ (i.e., birth cohorts born before 1967) who were alive at the beginning of 2012 and contains no identifiable bias. In the dataset, 28,736 of these 2,054,283 person-years died in 2012. Table 1 presents the characteristics of this population in person-time units. Table 1 .

All the independent variables in this study come from the 2011 census. The primary independent variable is partnership status , a combination of legal marital status and de facto cohabitation. The primary codification scheme for this variable only distinguishes two basic categories: living with a partner and not living with a partner. An additional specification of partnership status differentiates four categories: (1) living with a partner; (2) never married not living with a partner; (3) separated or divorced not living with a partner, and (4) widowed not living with a partner. The 2011 Spanish census collected and recorded detailed information about partnership status and has proven to be a precise instrument for measuring this variable. Even so, one limitation related to cross-sectional nature of the data is that currently unpartnered never-married persons are supposed to never have entered a partnership, but this is not necessarily the case because they could had been in a cohabiting relationship which dissolved. However, considering that marriage tended to be widespread and levels of cohabitation quite low among Spanish cohorts born before 1967, the importance of this specific situation would be relatively muted. Given these patterns, it comes with no surprise that in the first category married people prevail (94.3%), whereas the second one consists exclusively (100%) of non-partnered spinsters and bachelors. The third category is composed of separated or divorced persons (78.5%) and a portion of legally still married individuals not living with their partners (21%). All the members of the fourth category are widowed persons (although a small proportion of widows and widowers do live as cohabiting couples).
Potential confounders include several known to have an effect on death rates. Age was used as a continuous variable and coded into five 10-year intervals from 45 to 54 to 85+ to allow for non-linearities. Presence of children in the household (yes/no) is a qualifier of household composition and family life circumstances and does not necessarily refer to own children (although in many cases it does). Educational attainment is a proxy for socio economic status based on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). It was coded and ordered into four levels: primary education or less [ISCED = 0,1], lower secondary education [ISCED = 2], upper secondary education including tertiary non-university education [ISCED = 3,4,5] and university education [ISCED = 6,7,8]. Although originally present both in the census data and the vital statistics, data on educational attainment has been extracted only from the census. Size of municipality of residence (coded into four ordered categories: ≤ 10,000, 10,001–100 000, 100,001–500 000 and 501,000+) and migratory status (natives/non-natives) are included as population controls. Throughout the paper, the analysis is based on samples stratified by sex . Finally, the main dependent variable are the registered deaths in the 2012 Spanish vital statistics.
When analyzed with observational data, the impact of marriage/partnership on health implies a classic problem of selection bias. Most studies analyzing the relation between marriage and mortality have shown significantly lower death rates for married people. However, if this excess mortality of the unmarried was estimated from cross-sections of individuals not randomly assigned to treatment (partnered persons) and control groups (non-partnered), it is not possible to accurately know which part of the difference corresponds to positive selection mechanisms that make it more likely for healthy persons to get married or to true causal protective processes inherent to marital or partnered life. The possibility that individuals are not assigned to different marital/partnership statuses in a random way, but rather due to their health or other attributes mentioned earlier, is precisely what is known as a selection effect. Since non-partnered individuals may have substantially different characteristics from partnered ones and these characteristics may be consequential for entry into partnership, couple formation is a nonrandom process. In such non-experimental settings, unadjusted mortality differentials are only naïve estimates of the relative risks of dying associated to partnership status.
The statistical validity of causal inferences derived from possible selection biases have traditionally been a matter of serious concern among researchers interested in the health advantages of marriage or partnership. In the absence of experimental designs, the challenge of empirically disentangling selection from protection effects of marriage on mortality admits several solutions. In the 1980's, prospective cohort studies tried to distinguish marital selection from protection by introducing adjustments for baseline health status and associated risk factors ( Goldman, 1993 ). Since the 1990's, researchers have also resorted to panel data surveys representing smaller or larger populations ( Averett et al., 2013 ; Fu and Noguchi, 2018 ; Guner et al., 2018 ; Lillard and Waite, 1995 ; Rendall et al., 2011 ). Registered repeated measures of the health and other pertinent characteristics for the same individuals in different periods of time make it possible, by means of different econometric techniques, to directly model selection bias, control for endogeneity and obtain valid estimates of the effect of partnership on health. Other longitudinal instruments, such as historical registers with due information ( Murray, 2000 ), also allow for observing variation over time and, to some extent, account for selection biases.
Panel data based on large samples and containing health information are relatively rare, expensive and time-consuming to produce. Moreover, it is hard to find panel data with information on the entire span of ages where mortality is relevant. An interesting alternative are the matching methods devised to make causal inferences possible from observational data in which the assignment to treatment procedure is not known ( Bai and Clark, 2019 ). Matching methods couple observations in the treatment and the control group based on the covariates assumed to be related to the treatment (partnership) and the outcome (death). The purpose of matching is to eliminate or reduce the relationship between the treatment and the pretreatment measured confounders making the control and treatment groups identical, or as similar as possible, with respect to pretreatment covariates that can affect any selection bias ( Ho et al., 2007 ). By definition, potential selection biases are removed when comparing the outcome (death rates) among matched cases sharing all the observable pretreatment characteristics used for matching them.
Propensity score matching has been applied, for example, to confirm marital protective effects in the reduction of risky health behaviors among African Americans ( Ali and Ajilore, 2011 ), as well as to estimate marriage advantages in perinatal health ( Kane, 2016 ) net of potential selection biases. In this paper we opted for exact matching, ‘the simplest way to obtain good matches’ ( Ho et al., 2011 ). Matching covariates included age, presence of children in the household, educational attainment, size of municipality, and nativity. We first started matching partnered observations with non-partnered observations; then, we compare (1) partnered individuals with non-partnered widowed, separated and divorced, as well as (2) non-partnered widowed, separated and divorced with non-partnered never partnered persons. Although obviously not all possible selection factors are taken into consideration in the exact matching procedure, we are confident that relevant unobserved characteristics are correlated with the covariates used, so significant factors other than partnership affecting mortality remain under control.
The matching routines were conducted for women and men separately. Results were quite satisfactory and thanks to the huge sample size used we were able to avoid the dimensionality that typically affects this matching algorithm. Only 4998 female and 1480 male cases were excluded from the matched dataset and among matched cases, the distributions of covariates by partnership status were virtually identical for partnered and non-partnered individuals ( Fig. 1 ). Because of the properties of exact matching, simple ratios between treated and control groups are valid estimates of treatment effects (in these cases, relative risks of death) without further adjustments ( Ho et al., 2011 ).

Our empirical analysis has followed a three-step strategy. First, we cross-tabulate 2012 deaths and person-years by sex, broad age interval and partnership status (partnered/non-partnered) and calculate death rates. Differential mortality and relative risks of death among different partnership statuses were measured by rate ratios (RR). We calculated RRs from a multivariate log-linear Poisson regression model with cells as the unit of analysis, time from January 1, 2012 to death as exposure and living with a partner as the baseline. First, we only stratify by sex and broad age categories, but no additional adjustments are performed for estimating RRs. Then, we compare the relative risks of death between the four partnership categories (living with a partner/never married not living with a partner/separated or divorced not living with a partner/widows not living with a partner) using, again, RRs estimated from a Poison regression model after stratifying by sex and age bands.
Finally, after implementing the matching routines (running the MachIt command in R), RRs of death were estimated for partnered and non-partnered persons of different sexes and age intervals from the new dataset of matched cases. When estimated for partnered and non-partnered individuals from the exactly matched observations dataset and without further adjustments by covariates, RRs of death are supposed to have pruned away selection biases affecting partnership. Therefore, the differential mortality between partnered and non-partnered individuals calculated before and after matching cases gives a first insight into the magnitude of selection and protection effects. More specific comparisons between pairs of partnership statuses (partnered versus non-partnered widowed; non-partnered widowed versus non-partnered never married) offer more precise estimates of both effects and their respective sizes.

Section: 3. Results

There are important compositional differences in the four partnership statuses defined in this paper ( Table 1 ). First and most importantly, we found remarkable differentials in age. Mean differences of around 20 years of age can be observed between widows (72) or widowers (78) and separated/divorced women (57) and men (58), the youngest categories. Married/cohabitant individuals are, however, more similar to non-partnered never married. Partnered women (61) are younger than never married non-partnered (63), while married/cohabitant men (62) are on average one year older than non-partnered never married (61). These age differentials imply dissimilar distributions of educational attainment, patterns of settlement along the urban/rural continuum, migratory profiles, and household structures . Lower levels of educational attainment are found among female and male widowed, the oldest partnership categories; higher educational levels are exhibited to a greater extent by female never married singles and separated/divorced males. These distributions are consistent with the negative educational gradient of marriage prevalent in Spanish birth cohorts born before 1967 ( Requena and Salazar, 2014 ). Among widows and non-partnered never married men those living in rural areas predominate, while non-partnered separated/divorced and never married women are more likely located in big cities. Migratory contingents are very scant (≈5%) in these age bands of Spaniards and, above all, among widowed; generally, the younger the person in a given partnership status, the higher the proportion of migrants. Finally, children are found more often in the households of married/cohabitant women and men, and among separated/divorced women (but not men).
The distribution of partnership statuses across age intervals in the unadjusted data is displayed in Fig. 2 . Such distributions reflect the high-nuptiality regime prevailing among the cohorts of Spanish born during the first six decades of the twentieth century and the resulting preponderance of married and widowed at all observed ages. The expected imbalance favoring married against widowed during adulthood shifts to the advantage of widowhood in older ages, but differently for women and men. The status of married/cohabitant was preponderant in all age groups and both sexes except for women 85+, the only ages where widowhood prevailed over partnership. Moreover, the share of widows was always larger than that of widowers, although the female predominance decreased with age, from a ratio of 4 to 1 at ages 45–54 to a ratio of just 2.4 to 1 after 85. At 45–54, separated/divorced women outnumbered single never-married ones, something that does not happen above 55. Non-partnered never-married men exceeded separated/divorced over all ages. Women's share of separated/divorced was larger than men's up to 64; after 75, proportions are quite similar. Download: Download high-res image (611KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 2 .

Table 2 shows death rates and rates ratios for partnered and non-partnered individuals in our original sample. Mortality differentials favor partnered women and men at all observed ages. Still, the benefits of having a partner, as measured by the excess mortality of non-partnered individuals, decrease with age for both sexes. Mortality advantages are most visible between ages 45 and 64, with risks of death about 1.7 (95% CI = 1.4, 2.3) times higher for non-partnered women and men. Among females, benefits reached a minimum between 65 and 84 and rose after 85. The male pattern slightly differs: partnership benefits steadily decrease across age intervals. Only among the two oldest age intervals does the excess mortality of non-partnered men stop dwindling, stabilizing around a relative risk of death of 1.2. In other words, while the female mortality differential is V-shaped over the ages, the male age gradient is rather L-shaped. Both for women and men, the benefits of partnership are similar and decreasing during midlife and early old age, i.e. between 45 and 74 years; at later ages, however, the partnership premium is clearly higher for women. Among those aged 75–84, the risk of dying is 1.28 (95% CI = 1.20, 1.36) for non-partnered versus partnered women, while it is 1.15 (95% CI = 1.08, 1.22) for non-partnered men. Among those above 85 years, gender differences even widened: dying is 1.52 (95% CI = 1.42, 1.63) times more likely for non-partnered women while the equivalent risk for men is only 1.21 (95% CI = 1.15, 1.28).

In Table 2 death rates associated to partnership have been also broken down into the three non-partnered statuses distinguished in this paper. Resultant mortality differentials expressed as RR are displayed in Fig. 3 . Never married living without partner showed the highest mortality rates during midlife and early old age, at ages 45–74 for women and 45–64 for men. During old age mortality differentials generally decline, and risks of dying are higher among non-partnered widows and widowers. In fact, all the mortality advantage associated to partnered status among men above 65 is due to the high death rates of widowers, because rates of non-partnered separated/divorced and never married are, respectively, lower than or similar to those of partnered. Even non-partnered never married men above 85 are less likely to die than partnered men. Among women 65+, these mortality differentials between non-partnered separated/divorced and never married are similar when compared with those of married and cohabitant females. In any case, except for widower older than 65, unadjusted mortality differences in the three partnership statuses tend to be small and nonsignificant. In other words, mortality differentials associated to partnership status are dominated by the high death rates of non-partnered never married during late adulthood and early old-age years, whereas the widowhood factor accounts for most of the difference during later ages.

Given the strong compositional dissimilarities (by age, education, size of municipality, and so on) in partnership status observed during adulthood and old age, the unadjusted mortality differentials presented earlier constitute only approximate estimates of the actual effects of partnership on the likelihood of death. Matching solves these compositional heterogeneities and offers unbiased estimates of these partnership statuses effects. Table 3 presents person-times, number of deaths and death rates for the different partnership statuses calculated with the matched data. Death rates for married and cohabitants coincide before and after matching, except for tiny differences due to the few observations pruned away in the course of matching procedure. For the categories of non-partnered, the table shows their potential mortality outcomes under the counterfactual assumptions of matching method, i.e., the death rates that these non-partnered individuals would have experienced if they have had in fact a partner. Among women, pre- and post-matching estimated death rates of non-partnered tend to be similar during adulthood; in older ages, death rates estimates from matched data are systematically lower than unadjusted ones. The pattern among men is different: the post-matching estimates of death rates for non-partnered males only differ in two age bands (45–54 and 85+) from pre-matching ones, that at these ages tend to be lower.

Fig. 4 displays risks of dying of partnered individuals relative to non-partnered and compares results before (black dot) and after matching (red triangle). Matched estimates show statistically significant differences in death rates that favor partnered over non-partnered women and men at all ages. In other words, if non-partnered men and women had been partnered, they would have gained the health benefits of partnership and would have survived longer during mature adulthood and old age. Among women, larger mortality disadvantages of non-partnered individuals (RR ≈ 1.6) exist during adult years, between 45 and 64 years. Later in life, during old age, the partnership protection against death for women is lower, although still considerable (RR ≈ 1.1) and rather stable across these older ages. Male risks follow a slightly different pattern. Whereas marriage/partnership protection for males is quite strong (RR > 1.8) during the years of mature adult life, it gradually —in fact, almost linearly— decreases to the point of almost vanishing at older ages (RR = 1.05 at 85+). In sum, matched results generally suggest lower partnership effects on mortality than unmatched estimates, though differences are fairly small, except during old age when they increase substantially. Even so, the health premium of partnership is evident after age 45 both for women and men. Partnership-related health benefits are higher during middle age and dwindle as people age.

Detailed comparisons between specific partnership status shed light on the operation and magnitude of protection and selection effects. Fig. 5 shows the results of pertinent comparisons, stratified by sex and age bands. As stated earlier, these detailed comparisons are informative of both partnership protection and selection effects. Specifically, ratios between death rates of widows and separated or divorced individuals in comparison with those of married or cohabiting individuals are equivalent to the protection effects discussed earlier; and ratios between death rates of non-partnered, never-married individuals in comparison with those of widows and of separated or divorced persons amount to selection effects.

Protection effects and selection of marriage and partnership for the likelihood of death in Spain estimated after exact matching. Rate ratios by sex and age bands.
When all compositional differences have been controlled for by means of matching, magnitudes and patterns of both kinds of effects are rather similar for women and men. Other things been constant, marriage and partnership protect and select women and men nearly equally. Estimated gender differences are both small and statistically insignificant as estimated by 95% confidence intervals. If we choose to disregard statistical significance, selection effects tend to be slightly higher among women at all ages and protection effects are very slightly higher among men under 85 years of age.
Despite this basic gender similarity, both effects are differently associated to age. Protection effects are sizeable in mature adulthood and decrease during old age. Had widowed, separated or divorced persons at ages 45–64 not lost their spouses and partners, their mortality would have been around 30%–40% lower than that it actually was. Above 65, this differential mortality declined to only 10%–20% above that of those living with partners. Selection effects tell us a very different story. Here there is an almost continuous, nearly linear reduction of selective disadvantages, from the strong handicaps in mid-life to old age where there were net advantages. At ages 45–54, the excess mortality attributable to the negative selection out of marriage/partnership amounts to a risk of dying around 1.7 times higher than it was among ever-married widows and divorced individuals. Stated somewhat differently, had non-partnered never-married persons of these mature ages actually been partnered or married, their risk of death would have been 70% lower than it actually was. After that age, this strong selective disadvantage gradually declines to 0 and eventually becomes positive. At ages 75–84, the risk of dying of never married individuals in comparison with non-partnered ever-married elderly falls under 1; and after age 85, it shows that the risk of death after that age would be about half among never-married people in comparison with ever-married people without partners. In other words, never having married and having survived until these advanced ages becomes, in fact, an advantage for longevity. It is the selection effect in reverse.

Section: 4. Discussion

The results in this paper based on massive contemporary data for Spain have two main thrusts, both of which have important implications for our understanding of the importance of partnership for the health of people as they age and, in so doing, may also have implications for policy. One of them concerns the health-related implications of co-residence and marital status among men and women as they transition from mature adulthood into old age and the other deals specifically with the way that the classic protection and selection effects informing marriage and partnership affect the differential mortality of both sexes as they age. On both counts, these results complement and extend what we know on the subject and raise new issues regarding the ways in which health and aging are connected.
A major result of this study is the support it gives to the health benefits of partnership throughout mature adulthood and old age. This health premium on partnership is especially strong between 45 and 65 years of age with respect to never-married, non-partnered individuals whose death rates are between 1.7 and 2.2 times higher than they are for partnered persons. At higher ages, it declines but continues to exist through the rest of life. If non-partnered persons are broken down by specific types of co-residence (never-married, divorced or widowed) excess mortality among never-married persons is by far the highest during mature adulthood or early old age, though at later ages widowed persons —the more prevalent status among women— appear to show greater excess mortality than the other types of non-partnered persons. This last pattern is likely to be affected, at least in part, by the impact of recent deaths of a partner and the negative effect it has on the partner left behind, “the widowhood effect” ( Boyle et al., 2011 ; Elwert and Christakis, 2008 ; Moon et al., 2011 ; Vable et al., 2015 ).
A second major result of this study is that it is one of the first to specify and quantify the protection and selection effects associated with marriage and partnership for both men and women as they age. Our approach to these two effects is based on the use of co-residence and marital status to define each of the effects. Protection effects decline gradually with age, but always remain positive (lower death rates for currently partnered individuals). Selection effects, on the other hand, show a far more pronounced decline with age leading to a pattern in which selection is much stronger than protection during the mature adult ages, but then disappears entirely and even become negative as people age. Equally interesting, while both sexes show similar patterns, the protection effect is slightly higher among men while the selection effect is much higher among women, especially before 65 years of age.
Not surprisingly, the fairly small differences by sex in the protection effect suggest that the relative advantages for health of men having female partners is somewhat greater than they are for women having male partners. Greater efficiency among women, their ability to shape men's lives and to adhere to stricter attitudes towards health, and their greater awareness of the importance of health management make their impact on the health of their partners greater ( Umberson, 1992 ). Conversely, however, it is important to note that the effect is also important when the partner is a man, leading us to conclude that the helpful dimensions of this effect run in both directions, though the relative importance of this effect is not equal for each sex ( Jackson et al., 2015 ; Thomas et al., 2017 ).
In the case of the selection effects, however, things appear to be quite different ( Joung et al., 1998 ; Lipowicz, 2014 ). Before 65 years of age, it is far greater among women than it is among men. After that age, it declines substantially, though the effect is always slightly stronger among women. Later in life, it disappears entirely for both sexes. The stronger effect among adult women may be related, at least in part, to relatively greater physical demands for marriage among women than among men. This difference, present at the mating stage ( Hammarström and Janlert, ), would then have negative implications for health as mature adults. In later life, the result we have found where the death penalty reverses completely is likely related to the fact that non-partnered males and females who reach relatively high ages are survivors by definition. The ones slated to die have already done so much earlier, and thus this population subgroup is now selected (de facto) for people with better initial health.
The most salient results of this study —the existence of a health premium for partnership during middle and later life that affects both men and women—build on a growing body of research on the subject in the developed world ( Manzoli et al., 2007 ; Rendall et al., 2011 ; Waite and Gallagher, 2002 ; Wood et al., 2007 ) and promise to stimulate research in two complementary areas. One of them is research on this subject over a wider sample of countries than currently exists, though the data demands on this point may make progress rather slow. Despite this, the extent to which this premium exists in different contexts is an important issue that warrants attention, especially in the developed world but possibly elsewhere as well. Secondly, an inherent limitation of these results is that they only refer to an end variable —death—, but do little to increase our understanding of larger issues related to health and quality of life that are equally or more important than death. Do higher death rates necessarily point to the existence of lower quality of life and generally worse health? In order to assess fully the significance of the results such as those presented here, it is important to deepen our understanding of the health premium to include other aspects of health and quality of life beyond death itself.
These results enable us to identify pockets of vulnerability and strength in any given society and, in so doing, may have important implications for policy. Living in a partnership has a related health premium that is undeniable, especially if it can be shown that this premium is also linked to the overall quality of life and better health. Conversely, never-married individuals are subject to a far higher likelihood of death than any other subpopulation, especially through 74 years of age. The vulnerabilities are higher at younger ages, when death rates are relatively low, but continue to be visible until the onset of old age. Very old widows and widowers also appear to be earmarked for relatively higher death rates. Identifying these subpopulations may have important implications for policy, especially as the pressures of aging increase in the future, precisely because these divergences exist independent of policy. Ideally, in the future policy would be in a position to help support the positive effects of partnership and to intervene where the likelihood of vulnerability is greatest.
