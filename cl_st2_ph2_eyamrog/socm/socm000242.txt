Title: Exposure to televised political campaign advertisements aired in the United States 2015–2016 election cycle and psychological distress


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Context

Prior research suggests the potential for political campaign advertisements to increase psychological distress among viewers. The current study tests relationships between estimated exposure to campaign advertising and the odds of respondents reporting that a doctor told them they have anxiety, depression, insomnia, or (as a negative control) cancer.

Abstract_Section: Methods

A secondary analysis of U.S. data on televised campaign ad airings from January 2015 to November 2016 ( n = 4,659,038 airings) and five waves of a mail survey on television viewing patterns and self-reported medical conditions from November 2015 to March 2017 ( n = 28,199 respondents from n = 16,204 unique households in the U.S.).

Abstract_Section: Findings

A 1 percent increase in the estimated volume of campaign advertising exposure was associated with a 0.06 [95% CI 0.03–0.09] percentage point increase in the odds of a respondent being told by a doctor that they have anxiety in the past 12 months. We observed this association regardless of the political party of the ad sponsor, the political party of the respondent, or their statistical interaction. We also observed this association for both Presidential campaign ads and non-Presidential (including local, state, and U.S. congressional election) campaign ads, providing evidence that these relationships were not driven by the unique divisiveness of the race between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton. Some topic-specific models offered additional evidence of association between estimated volume of campaign advertising exposure and the odds of being told by a doctor that they have depression or insomnia, but these patterns were less consistent across models that utilized different categories of campaign exposure. Campaign ad exposure was not associated with cancer, which served as a negative control comparison.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

There was a consistent positive association between the volume of campaign advertising exposure and a reported diagnosis of anxiety among American adults.

Section: 1. Introduction

Researchers have shown increasing interest in relationships between political factors and population health ( Gollust and Haselswerdt, 2019 ; Pacheco and Fletcher, 2015 ; Subramanian and Perkins, 2010 ; Ojeda and Pacheco, 2019 ). A systematic review of cross-national studies found consistent evidence that markers of national political ideology (e.g., left-of-center political traditions, welfare state generosity) are positively associated with a variety of population health outcomes that include self-rated health, child and infant mortality, life expectancy, and mental health ( Barnish et al., 2018 ). Recent research in the U.S. political context has linked county-level mortality ( Bor, 2017 ), substance use ( Goodwin et al., 2018 ) and increasing death rates ( Bilal et al., 2018 ; Goldman et al., 2018 ) with support for the Republican party's nominee, Donald Trump. Some researchers have interpreted these trends as evidence that death rates and substance use changed local voting patterns because they signal anxiety, frustration, and despair with conditions in these communities and reflect the fact that the political status quo has failed to change these population health outcomes for the better ( Monnat and Brown, 2017 ). In this interpretation, health outcomes shape election outcomes.
The current paper, in contrast, looks at the inverse relationship: the possibility that elections themselves might have health-related consequences. We focus on political advertising as a potential source of anxiety, depression, and insomnia for reasons we describe below.
Recent studies document elevated levels of psychological distress among groups most likely to support the losing candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Hilary Clinton. These studies include reports of (a) increased mental health-related web searches among Spanish-speaking Latinx people in the U.S., ( Krupenkin et al., 2019 ), (b) more frequent reports of both stress and anxiety among teens and young adults ( DeJonckheere et al., 2018 ), (c) higher rates of clinically significant event-related distress among college students ( Hagan et al., 2018 ), and (d) elevated biological markers of stress (cortisol) among women and non-white young adults, comparing pre-election to post-election periods ( Hoyt et al., 2018 ).
While most of this work has studied consequences of the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, other evidence suggests that negative psychological effects of elections may not be limited to supporters of a losing political candidate, or to the immediate post-election period. A pre-election national survey reported that a majority of Americans (52 percent) identified the then-upcoming presidential election as a significant cause of stress in August 2016; nearly two-thirds reported stress about the future of the country (66 percent) in January 2017, including a majority of both Democrats (76 percent) and Republicans (59 percent) ( American Psychological As, 2017 ). A representative survey of U.S. adults in March 2017 found that 38 percent of Americans reported politics to be a significant source of stress, while 18.3 percent reported that they have lost sleep because of politics; these reports were only weakly correlated with political partisanship and ideology ( Smith et al., 2019 ). Outside of the U.S. context, an econometric analysis of health claims data from South Korean elections from 2005 through 2012 linked election campaigns to increased healthcare utilization, though there was limited evidence that these effects were specific to mental health ( Chang and Meyerhoefer, 2020 ).
This body of work speaks to a variety of mechanisms through which elections could produce negative psychological outcomes, regardless of whether one supports the election's winning or losing candidates and their political parties. These mechanisms include the possibilities of increasing levels of hostility between different political and social groups during the campaign season, promoting feelings of uncertainty about the election results, and inviting antagonistic interactions on social media and elsewhere debating politics and candidates ( Smith et al., 2019 ; Chang and Meyerhoefer, 2020 ; Williams and Medlock, 2017 ).
The current paper builds on this body of work by asking whether a major component of U.S. elections, widespread exposure to political advertising, can further inform relationships between elections and psychological distress. There are reasons to suspect that exposure to political ads could increase levels of psychological distress among its viewers. Political ads play a significant role in how citizens learn about candidates and their policies ( Motta et al., 2016 ; Franz et al., 2007 ; Freedman et al., 2004 ), and these messages often emphasize threats to safety and security in strategic attempts to shape anxiety ( Albertson and Gadarian, 2015 ; Brader, 2006 ). Many political ads attack the character and policies of competing candidates and imply (or state explicitly) that electing the (opposing) candidate would ensure a bleak and frightening future ( Brader, 2006 ; Kahn and Kenney, 1999 ; Geer, 2006 ; Daignault et al., 2013 ; Bradley et al., 2007 ). These negative political ads are perceived to be more informative ( Geer, 2006 ) and attention grabbing ( Daignault et al., 2013 ) than positive ones, and they induce physiological arousal ( Daignault et al., 2013 ) and evoke negative emotions such as anxiety and fear ( Albertson and Gadarian, 2015 ; Brader, 2006 ; Bradley et al., 2007 ) in the audience. While moderate levels of anxiety and fear induced by political messages can motivate people to respond to perceptions of threat by participating in the democratic process (e.g., seeking political information, campaigning, voting) ( Albertson and Gadarian, 2015 ; Brader, 2006 ; Lau et al., 1999 ), higher levels of fear and anxiety could also exceed one's capacity to manage these feelings ( Albertson and Gadarian, 2015 ). Many people experience anxiety, depression, and insomnia in response to negative events like crime, terrorism, civic unrest, threats of violent international conflict, and/or infectious disease outbreaks ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2021 )—problems regularly described in political ads ( Albertson and Gadarian, 2015 ; Brader, 2006 ). Repeated exposure to depictions of these problems as serious and eminent could elevate fear and anxiety to levels that motivate clinical intervention, or trigger those who have experienced anxiety, depression, or insomnia from prior experiences related to such negative events.
While it is possible that exposure to other forms of political messaging (news coverage, campaign events and speeches) could also prompt these responses, several characteristics of political ads could make them uniquely influential. Engaged citizens seek out political news and choose whether or not to attend campaign events and speeches. Television (TV) ads are placed within breaks during programs that audiences select for general knowledge or entertainment, and as such are designed to reach audiences who are not actively looking for them. Such inadvertent exposure could trigger levels of anxiety, insomnia, and depression among those who would otherwise avoid such content. TV ads also afford the opportunity to pair political messages with audio (e.g., scary music) and video cues (e.g., dark imagery) that may heighten their impact relative to news coverage and political speech. Furthermore, U.S. election campaign cycles last much longer than they do in other countries and thus produce very high levels of cumulative exposure ( Williams and Medlock, 2017 ; Motta et al., 2016 ; Franz et al., 2007 ) U.S. congressional races averaged over 1.5 million ad airings in each biannual election cycle from 2010 to 2016 ( Fowler et al., 2020 ), and over 4 million political ads aired across all offices and levels of government in the 2016 election cycle alone ( Fowler et al., 2019 ). Considering both volume and content, aggregate exposure to TV political ads may paint a divisive and disturbing picture of the state of the country, its elected officials, and the country's promise for the future. It thus seems plausible that cumulative exposure to hundreds of political ads over an election cycle, messages that viewers do not seek out in the first place, could affect viewers' mental wellbeing .
We focus on self-reported diagnoses of three mental health conditions, each recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders (5th Edition) ( American Psychiatric Asso, 2013 ) as indicators of psychological distress: anxiety, depression, and insomnia. While each are distinct health conditions, we examine all three in an attempt to assess a breadth of possible mental health outcomes that could plausibly be influenced by candidate ads. Anxiety disorders, characterized in part by chronic feelings of worry and fear ( National Institute of Men, 2020a ), would seem plausible in light of the fact that campaign ads may paint a negative vision for the future in the event that an opposing candidate were to win an election, or if a favored candidate were to lose. Depression, characterized in part by feelings of hopelessness, sadness, and emptiness ( National Institute of Men, 2020b ), would likewise seem plausible in light of prior evidence that the 2016 election produced “clear, significant, and sustained” increases in searches for ‘depression’ and antidepressant medications among at least one population group (Spanish-speaking Latinos in the U.S.) ( Krupenkin et al., 2019 ). Stress is a major cause of insomnia, a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty starting and sustaining sleep ( Roth et al., 2011 ); there is ample prior evidence that elections and politics (and plausibly campaign ads) can increase stress ( American Psychological As, 2017 ; Smith et al., 2019 ). As noted above, some evidence suggests that psychological distress may be particularly likely for ads that attack other candidates and their policies and/or ads that convey a very different set of priorities and desired outcomes than those held by the viewer. Research has yet to fully test and elucidate the extent to which political advertising may have such adverse, negative, and cumulative effects on psychological distress, a gap we also address in the current paper.
We had three primary aims. First, we estimated the volume of televised campaign advertising exposure overall, by ad category (attack/contrast ads, ads for Democrat and Republican candidates, Presidential campaign ads versus non-Presidential campaign ads for local, state, and U.S. congressional elections), and by respondent political party membership. Second, we tested the relationship between estimated political campaign advertising exposure and the odds of a respondent being told by a doctor in the past 12 months that they have anxiety, depression, insomnia, or (as a negative control) cancer. Third, we assessed whether associations between campaign advertising exposure and mental health outcomes varied by political party of the respondent, the party of the candidate featured in the ad, or the office under consideration (Presidential campaign ads vs. non-Presidential campaign ads, a test of whether the unique circumstances of the race between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton drove patterns of results).

Section: 2. Methods

We conducted a secondary analysis of data from two large national U.S. datasets: Kantar/CMAG's database (“Kantar”) on TV airings for campaign ads appearing between January 1st, 2015 to November 8th, 2016, and data from five waves of the Simmons National Consumer Survey (“Simmons”) on TV viewing patterns and consumer behavior completed between November 10th, 2015 and March 7th, 2017. The survey also includes a detailed section on health ailments and engagement with doctors about these concerns.
Kantar monitors the placement of commercial ads via local broadcast TV (airing within a specific media market), national broadcast TV (airing across all markets), and national cable TV (airing nationally on a cable network). Kantar codes each ad airing by category (e.g., campaign ads for political candidates; political issue/policy ads, which do not mention a candidate for office); we focus the analysis on campaign ads for specific political candidates because we expected exposure to content about candidates to be most likely to associate with markers of psychological distress . Campaign ads also comprised a very large majority of political ads in the 2016 election cycle (94 percent of all political ads). The Kantar campaign ad dataset consisted of 4,659,038 ad airings between January 1st, 2015 and November 8th, 2016 (Election Day). In addition to category, Kantar codes these ads for their geographic location (within one of 210 U.S. Designated Marketing Areas, “DMAs”), program/network, and date/time of the ad's airing.
Simmons is a repeated, cross-sectional mail survey of U.S. households from the 95 largest markets in the country (comprising over 85% of the U.S. population) that uses stratified random sampling to recruit participants four times a year. Simmons allows multiple people living within the same household to participate in the survey and we identify these individuals in the dataset with a unique household ID to permit statistical correction for non-independence of some respondents. Simmons data over-represent women, older adults, and higher income households relative to U.S. Census population estimates and purposefully oversamples Hispanic adults. We purchased data from five waves of the survey that span from November 2015 to March 2017: winter 2015–2016, spring 2016, summer 2016, fall 2016, and winter 2016–2017 (n = 31,843 respondents, roughly 1/5 from each wave). The fall 2016 wave included respondents who completed the survey both before and after Election Day (November 8th); we re-classified respondents who finished the survey after the election (n = 5303) into the winter 2016–2017 wave to create an indicator variable to distinguish cases pre- and post-election. We restricted the analysis to respondents with a verifiable location (DMA) and who reported English as their primary language or watching television in English (n = 28,199 respondents from n = 16,204 unique households located within the U.S.). The survey includes a large battery of demographic variables, items measuring health conditions and engagement with the medical system, and self-reported television network, channel, program, and daypart (e.g., 8–9pm Thursday) viewing. The average survey response rate was 21 percent (range 11–27). Our Institutional Review Board deemed the project exempt from review due to its use of de-identified secondary data sources.
Health conditions . The survey asked respondents, “Have you been told by a doctor or other healthcare professional in the past year that you have …:” followed by a series of conditions that respondents could check as applicable. This stem is the same wording used in the National Health Interview Survey (NIHS) except that NIHS asks about lifetime diagnoses while Simmons focuses on the past year ( Centers for Disease Contr, 2020 ). We analyzed three prevalent mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) hypothesized to be outcomes of campaign advertising exposure. We included another condition, cancer, to serve as a negative control as a link between exposure to political ads and cancer seems implausible.
Registered political party membership . The survey asked respondents two questions related to political party: “Are you currently registered to vote?” and “If yes, what party are you currently registered with?” We used responses to these two questions to create five mutually exclusive party categories: (a) registered Democrat, (b) registered Republican, (c) registered Independent, (d) registered another party, or (e) not registered to vote/did not respond.
Estimated number of campaign ads seen in the past 10 months . We estimated exposure to campaign ads, at all levels of government (including Presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House of Representatives, Gubernatorial, State Legislative, Mayoral, and other local elections such as city council, district attorneys, county executive, judges, and sheriffs), across the previous 10 months, to test relationships between various measures of cumulative ad exposure and the odds of reporting each of the four health conditions. To do so, we matched Kantar data with Simmons data on self-reported television viewing behavior based on the specific market (DMA), date, time, and program or channel of ad airings within the preceding 10 months of the completion date of the respondent's Simmons survey. We chose the 10-month window because the 2014 midterm election cycle ended in November 2014 so we began tracking campaign ads for the 2016 election cycle in January 2015; the winter 2015–2016 Simmons survey wave began in November 2015 so the prior 10 months correspond to the start of the 2016 election ad cycle.
Simmons asks respondents about their time-of-day television viewership over the past 7 days (excluding 1am–5am for broadcast television and 1am–6am for cable television), as well as what channels/programs they viewed over the last month. Using these measures, we extrapolate general media use patterns that we used to assign past 10-month televised campaign ad exposure. Respondents reported viewership frequency for 776 unique network and cable television programs during the study observation period. They also reported viewing frequency across 94 cable channels spanning 9 weekday and 9 weekend time slots (e.g., 8pm–9pm Monday through Friday), as well as network viewership across 28 weekday slots, 20 Saturday slots, and 20 Sunday slots (e.g., 4pm–5pm Monday through Friday; 1pm–2pm Saturday).
We include broadcast (local or national) and national cable TV ads. We matched national broadcast and cable ads appearing across all DMAs to all respondents and matched local ads specific to a respondent's DMA. If the program during which an ad aired was included among the 638 programs listed in the Simmons survey, we matched Kantar network ad airings with Simmons viewership data by the program, channel, day of week, and (if local) DMA location in which they appeared. We matched the remaining ad airings (those that did not air on programs asked about in NCS) by time of day, day of week, and location, as long as the respondent has not already reported viewing a program that airs at that time of day and day of week.
We consider a respondent potentially exposed to a televised campaign ad if the ad aired within the last 10 months (a) during a commercial break within specific programs they reported watching in the last month, (b) on broadcast networks in time slots they reported watching in the past 7 days but otherwise did not have a specific program accounted for, or (c) on cable networks in time slots that they reported watching in the past month. We then multiplied each ad airing that met these criteria by the proportion of times respondents reported watching the programs in a typical month (0–4 times divided by 4), a typical year for sports programming (0–4 times divided by 4) and/or the frequency they reported viewing a network and time period (0–5 days divided by 5 for a weekday; 0–2 days divided by 2 for a weekend).
In addition to creating an estimate of overall campaign ad exposure, we created three measures of content-specific exposure based on categories identified by Kantar. We captured negative ads by identifying ads that either attacked an opposing candidate or contrasted an opposing candidate with the candidate promoted in the ad (termed “attack/contrast” ads). We created a measure based on the political party of the candidate promoted in the ad (termed “Democratic” or “Republican” ads). We also distinguished between ads for President and all other non-Presidential offices to assess the extent to which the pattern of results may be specific to the political division associated with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. All measures of estimated televised campaign ad exposure were highly correlated ( r range .76–.91), an observation we return to in our discussion of results.
Control variables . All multivariable models (described below) include demographic factors associated with one or more of the mental health conditions in previous work or as observed in the current dataset: gender, race, ethnicity, age, income, education, marital status, household size, weekly work hours, and geographic region ( National Institute of Men, 2020a ; National Institute of Men, 2020b ; Roth et al., 2011 ; Ssnaani et al., 2010 ; McLean et al., 2011 ; Patel et al., 2018 ). We further control for estimated overall TV viewing time (based on the sum of all viewing measures) and survey wave (including an indicator variable for the lone wave that took place after Election Day), both deemed plausibly associated with TV campaign ad exposure and/or the health conditions. We include DMA fixed effects to account for any potential correlation between unobserved media market-level characteristics and political ad exposure. Finally, we account for specific program preferences (and the fact that ad placements are “bundled” within specific programs as they appear during commercial breaks) using program fixed effects via a dummy variable for each of 776 programs included in the survey. By including DMA and program fixed effects, our analysis relies solely on variability in the availability of political ads within particular media markets and variation in self-reported frequency of viewing programs in which political ads appeared.
We conducted all analyses using STATA 16.0. We estimated the volume of televised campaign ad exposure overall, by ad category (attack/contrast ads, ads for Democratic or Republican candidates), and by respondent political party membership. We used logistic regression to test the relationship between estimated overall campaign ad exposure and the odds of having each health condition. Each measure of estimated exposure to televised political candidate ads was heavily right-skewed, so we used the natural log of (number of ads + 1) as a predictor variable in these models. Coefficients for these logged variables represent the percentage point increase in the odds of being told by a doctor that a respondent has a health condition when they are exposed to 1% more ads. We accounted for the presence of multiple tests (4 different outcomes) by reporting p-values that account for a Bonferroni correction. We clustered the data in all models by a unique household id using the “cluster” option for logistic regression (“logit”) in STATA to adjust standard errors for non-independence of observations because more than one adult from each household are eligible for the Simmons sample.
We estimated additional models to look separately at attack/contrast ads, partisan ad exposure, and Presidential and non-Presidential ads. We formally tested for differences in ad exposure coefficients by political party (e.g., whether exposure to pro-Democrat ads exhibited stronger associations with health conditions among Republican respondents who may feel particularly threatened by the prospect of an opposing candidate and their worldview) by interacting ad exposure with political party (omitting Democrats as the reference group and examining the coefficient for Republican party membership * ad exposure, controlling for interactions between ad exposure and independent, other, and no political party membership).

Section: 3. Results

The sample was majority female and White though reasonably well distributed by registered political party, ethnicity, age, income, education, marital status, and region ( Table 1 ). Sample prevalence rates for each health condition were roughly comparable to the most recently available U.S. national prevalence estimates, adjusting for the fact that the Simmons survey item includes the provision that respondents be told by a doctor in the past year that they have the medical condition ( National Institute of Men, 2020a ; National Institute of Men, 2020b ; Roth et al., 2011 ; Ssnaani et al., 2010 ; McLean et al., 2011 ; Patel et al., 2018 ). Recent U.S. prevalence estimates for anxiety (19.1%) and insomnia disorder (12%–20%), while higher than observed in the Simmons data, do not account for the fact that many cases in the population remain undiagnosed by a medical professional ( National Institute of Men, 2020a ; Roth et al., 2011 ; Patel et al., 2018 ).

We estimate that the average respondent was exposed to over 500 televised campaign ad airings in the ten months preceding their survey ( Table 2 ). Estimated exposure to attack/contrast ad airings accounted for less than a third of the overall volume of estimated exposure. More than half of the ad airings were for major party candidates (156 estimated ads for Democrats; 119 estimated ads for Republicans), estimates that mirror the ratio of partisan spending on TV ads in the 2016 election ( Fowler et al., 2016 ). Registered Democrats and Independents had greater estimated ad exposure than did registered Republicans (partially driven by the fact that Democrats reported greater overall TV viewing than Republicans, a finding consistent with previous work) ( Fowler et al., 2016 ), while estimated exposure was lowest among those who did not indicate that they were registered to vote (perhaps reflecting purposeful ad targeting to likely voters). The average respondent was potentially exposed to far more ad airings for non-Presidential races (370 estimated ads) than for the race for President (133 estimated ads). Table 2 .

Logged estimated exposure to campaign ads in the past 10 months was associated with increased odds of having anxiety (Bonferroni adjusted p < .001; Table 3 ). The coefficient indicates that a 1% increase in overall campaign ad exposure during the 2016 election cycle was associated with a 0.06% increase in the odds of a respondent being told by a doctor in the past year that they have anxiety. Doubling campaign ad exposure (a 100% increase) was associated with a 4.25% increase in the odds of having anxiety (calculations not shown in tables). Logged estimated campaign ad exposure was not associated with the odds of having depression, insomnia, or (as expected as a negative control) cancer. In other notable results, the logged volume of weekly TV viewing was associated with each health condition (all Bonferroni adjusted p s < .01). There was no evidence that any of the four health conditions increased in the survey wave immediately following Election Day. Republicans were less likely to report anxiety and depression, consistent with prior work suggesting that Republicans are less likely to report poor health than Democrats ( Pacheco and Fletcher, 2015 ; Subramanian and Perkins, 2010 ). Those not registered to vote or who did not answer the question on party registration were far less likely to report any of the mental health conditions, a result that appears at odds with research showing that depression predicts lower levels of voter participation ( Ojeda and Pacheco, 2019 ).

Turning to content-specific measures of campaign ad exposure, the second column of Table 4 depicts a consistent, positive relationship between logged estimated volume of ad exposure and anxiety regardless of whether we considered exposure to all campaign ads or to only attack/contrast ads, pro-Democrat ads, pro-Republican ads, Presidential ads, or non-Presidential ads. There was no relationship between logged estimated exposure to attack/contrast ads and either depression or insomnia. Logged estimated exposure to partisan ads was associated with higher odds of depression (for both pro-Democrat and pro-Republican ads) but not insomnia. Logged estimated exposure to Presidential ads was associated with higher odds of neither depression nor insomnia, while estimated exposure to non-Presidential ads was associated with higher odds of both depression and insomnia. As expected, none of the measures of logged estimated campaign ad exposure were associated with having cancer. Table 4 .

We ran additional models for each of the 24 different combinations of health conditions and ad exposure measures for which we presented coefficients in Table 4 in which we added interaction terms between respondents’ registered political party and estimated campaign ad exposure. Across 24 tests (4 conditions and 6 measures of exposure), there was no evidence that relationships between any measure of logged estimated ad exposure and any of the four health conditions differed between Democrats and Republicans (all p s > .05; not in tables).

Section: 4. Discussion

This study offers new insights into the emerging science related to the intersection of politics and health by testing associations between estimated campaign ad exposure and several mental health conditions in the context of the 2016 U.S. election cycle. We found consistent evidence that exposure to one form of political messaging, televised campaign ads, was associated with increased odds of a person being told by a doctor that they have anxiety. There was also evidence, in 3 of 6 statistical tests, of a relationship between sub-categories of ads (pro-Democrat ads, pro-Republican ads, and non-Presidential ads) and reports of depression, though we did not observe these patterns for overall ad exposure, attack/contrast ads, or Presidential ads.
Only one out of six total ad sub-categories (non-Presidential ads) provided evidence of a positive association with reports of insomnia; we observed no such relationships for overall ads, attack/contrast ads, pro-Democrat ads, pro-Republican ads, or Presidential ads. Notably, we found no significant associations between any measure of exposure and a negative control health condition, cancer, for which we had no expectations of a relationship. Altogether, results offer preliminary observational evidence that cumulative, widespread exposure to campaign advertising has the potential to contribute to harmful mental health consequences. Results are by no means conclusive given the observational nature of the study design, reliance on a single election cycle, and possibility of unmeasured third variable explanations. We nevertheless argue that these results justify further inquiry into the possibility that elections have health-relevant consequences, and that campaign ads are one vehicle through which such effects could manifest. The fact that positive associations between exposure to political ads and anxiety were robust to a large set of demographics, geographic location, and program choice variables lends confidence that these patterns cannot be explained by pre-existing differences in media market characteristics or exposure to content specific to various genres of TV programming.
Findings build on previous speculation and evidence from the emerging subfield of political epidemiology that raised the prospect that the 2016 election posed negative mental health consequences for the population ( Krupenkin et al., 2019 ; DeJonckheere et al., 2018 ; Hagan et al., 2018 ; Hoyt et al., 2018 ). After accounting for campaign ad exposure, survey wave (our proxy for both proximity to the election and, in the case of the post-election wave indicator, the election result itself) was not a consistent predictor of anxiety, depression, or insomnia, suggesting that political ad exposure may contribute to previously observed relationships between elections and mental health. It is also noteworthy that we found very little evidence that these relationships reflect purely partisan dynamics – exposure to ads supporting both Democratic and Republican candidates were associated with anxiety and depression, and these relationships did not differ based on whether a respondent registered as a Democrat or Republican. We also observed evidence of associations between ad exposure and mental health outcomes for both Presidential ads (featuring a uniquely divisive pair of Presidential candidates, Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton) and non-Presidential ads. Thus, our results suggest that any observed pattern of relationships found here may not be solely attributable to a so-called “Trump” campaign effect on mental health. Furthermore, it did not seem to matter whether these ads attacked or emphasized contrasts between a favored and oppositional candidate, both content that we reasoned could be particularly likely to raise fear and anxiety among audiences.
It is nevertheless possible that the competitive dynamics of elections make it difficult to disentangle these factors. People who see many ads for Democratic candidates tend to also see many for Republicans because political campaigns tend to place ads in geographic areas where a political race is competitive and campaigns seek to avoid large discrepancies in exposure with opposing candidates ( Ridout et al., 2012 ). Indeed, all measures of estimated exposure were highly correlated. Nevertheless, findings begin to raise the possibility that campaign ads could be harmful in and of itself, regardless of whether the ad's worldview is consistent or inconsistent with the viewer's.
While the data sources used in the current study do not permit assessment of potential mechanisms that might explain the relationship between campaign ad exposure and anxiety, a variety of explanations seem plausible. The sheer volume of campaign ad exposure that characterized the average respondent in the study suggests that many U.S. residents are unable to escape some degree of exposure to messages about candidates for political office. Political ads reach audiences who are not actively looking for political information. Even when neutral or positive in tone, these ads may serve to emphasize differences between people of diverse political and social groups and identities and fuel subsequent interactions (in person, via social media) that emphasize difference and division ( Smith et al., 2019 ; Freedman et al., 2004 ). Widespread, cumulative exposure to ads that emphasize threats to safety and well-being like violence, economic crises, terrorism, and other threats to national security may reinforce feelings of worry, uncertainty, and fearful anticipation about the future among people at risk of general anxiety or people who have previously experienced trauma related to these topics ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2021 ; National Institute of Men, 2020a ). These speculative potential explanations warrant further study, perhaps with longitudinal panel data that would permit assessment of mental health trajectories over time in response to variation in the level of cumulative exposure to candidate ads across an election.
The use of two large datasets, including both a census of televised campaign ad airings in the 2016 election cycle (Kantar data) and several waves of a large national survey (Simmons data), allowed us to estimate the volume of campaign ad exposure for each individual in the dataset without relying on respondents to recall specific details of such exposure. This approach likely produced estimates of campaign ad exposure that are less biased by selective attention, selective processing, and motivated reasoning than other forms of self-reported ad exposure (e.g., which would be biased by the tendency to remember things that are consistent with one's existing worldview) and more precise than exclusive reliance on the presence or absence of an ad in a particular media market. This study thus employs unique data sources and an analytic approach that permits nuanced assessments of the relationship between one aspect of politics (political ads) and health. It contributes to an emerging body of literature in political epidemiology by emphasizing the role that political ads may play in shaping complex and bi-directional relationships between politics and health outcomes ( Gollust and Haselswerdt, 2019 ; Pacheco and Fletcher, 2015 ; Subramanian and Perkins, 2010 ; Ojeda and Pacheco, 2019 ; Barnish et al., 2018 ; Bor, 2017 ; Goodwin et al., 2018 ; Bilal et al., 2018 ; Goldman et al., 2018 ; Monnat and Brown, 2017 ; Krupenkin et al., 2019 ; DeJonckheere et al., 2018 ; Hagan et al., 2018 ; Hoyt et al., 2018 ; American Psychological As, 2017 ; Smith et al., 2019 ; Chang and Meyerhoefer, 2020 ; Williams and Medlock, 2017 ).
Study results also contribute to broader conversations about the role of political ads in civil society. While there has been considerable debate on whether political ads are harmful or benign from the perspective of democracy and civic engagement ( Freedman et al., 2004 ; Albertson and Gadarian, 2015 ; Brader, 2006 ; Kahn and Kenney, 1999 ; Geer, 2006 ; Daignault et al., 2013 ; Bradley et al., 2007 ; Lau et al., 1999 ) and work that specifically rejects a connection between political advertising and polarization ( Ridout et al., 2018 ), our results suggest the need for research and policy to consider a broader set of outcomes (namely, psychological distress) that may be relevant. While few would suggest that larger discussions on the virtues or vices of political advertising should focus exclusively on their public health implications, these debates could benefit from weighing a broader set of societal impacts political ads may engender.
Results suggest a variety of potential implications for public health practice. Each implication rests on an assumption of a causal relationship between political ad exposure and indicators of psychological distress, a relationship that we cannot establish with certainty given the fundamental limitations of observational and ultimately cross-sectional data. We nevertheless believe there is value in exploring potential implications for public health should future work confirm definitive causal inferences between political ads and clinical diagnoses of anxiety.
There are at least two potential causal interpretations that would be consistent with our results. The first is that political ads motivate individuals who were already experiencing clinically relevant levels of anxiety to seek out treatment from a medical professional. This seems implausible, however, as political ads offer no information that would direct them as to how to do so. The second potential interpretation is that political ads increase levels of anxiety to those that reach a level of clinical significance and prompt medical visits related to psychological distress. Either scenario would suggest a need to develop systems and strategies to help mental health treatment professionals to (a) increase their capacity to meet elevated demands for treatment during cycles of elections characterized by a high volume of political ads, and (b) identify specific treatment strategies to mitigate effects of political ads on anxiety.
Undertreatment of mental illness remains a major challenge in the U.S. ( Lawrence, 2020 ) Increased awareness of predictable factors that further burden this system would be valuable in the effort to develop adequate responses and allocate resources accordingly. There could also be value to working with mental health professionals to develop specific strategies to buffer effects of exposure to political ads on anxiety. For instance, efforts to monitor patterns of political ad airings, combined with systems to notify mental health professionals about specific TV programs/genres that are particularly likely to feature political ads, could catalyze broader thinking about ways to help patients reduce their exposure. Some digital platforms also offer more comprehensive strategies to buffer people from exposure to political ads. Facebook, for instance, features an option to turn off political ads during election cycles, and Twitter has banned political advertising altogether. Other media and platforms could consider parallel options as is technologically possible.
While we controlled for many demographic factors, the cross-sectional nature of these data cannot establish the causal direction of relationships between ad exposure and health conditions. We also cannot rule out possible residual confounding from unmeasured variables. Our measure may overestimate exposure if a respondent did not pay attention to the screen, left the room or switched channels during an ad, overstated their recent media use, or watched more television in recent weeks/months than they did across the previous year. Our measure could also underestimate exposure since we rely on respondents to report episodes and channels they watch in the last month from a finite list that does not include all possible programs.
We were unable to account for campaign ad exposure from ads appearing in magazines, newspapers, radio, billboards, and most notably, digital media and streaming services like Netflix or Hulu. Nevertheless, while spending on digital ads increased dramatically in the 2016 election cycle relative to previous years, TV ads were still the largest source of expenditure ($5.75 billion on broadcast and cable combined), outpacing digital ad spending ($1.4 billion) by a large margin ( Kaye, 2016 ). We were also unable to account for other forms of political messaging (news coverage, campaign events, and campaign speeches) that could cause psychological distress. Simmons’ 21 percent response rate, sampling only within the top 95 DMAs in the U.S., and skewed demographic representation raise questions about broader generalizability. We did include a wide variety of control variables to account for possible bias in estimates associated with skewed demographic representation, geographic differences in political ad exposure and anxiety, and any potential confounds associated with TV program preferences. The fact that results are robust to their inclusion reduces the chance that these alternative explanations account for our observed patterns of association between political ads and psychological distress. Our outcome measures rely on self-reports by respondents themselves and do not necessarily reflect confirmed clinical diagnoses. These factors introduce error to these estimates in ways that are unknown. It may be that reliance on a measure of being told by a doctor that a respondent suffers one of these conditions leads to an underestimation of the true relationship between ad exposure and these conditions, as non-diagnosed respondents would not be counted. It may also be that respondents who have access to medical care and such a diagnosis are more likely to be politically engaged, and thus estimates of the association could be artificially inflated.

Section: 5. Conclusion

Study findings add to a growing body of literature examining the relationships between political factors and population health ( Gollust and Haselswerdt, 2019 ; Pacheco and Fletcher, 2015 ; Subramanian and Perkins, 2010 ; Ojeda and Pacheco, 2019 ). Our observation of a consistent positive association between the volume of campaign advertising exposure and a reported diagnosis of anxiety among American adults suggests that elections themselves may contribute to individual-level mental health issues. We further suggest that campaign ads may be a vehicle through which negative mental health consequences can occur. Less consistent patterns of association with diagnoses of depression and insomnia further emphasize the need for continued study of these relationships. Future work should continue to examine the mechanisms through which elections and associated communication have potential to contribute to mental health outcomes. Research should also continue to explore the bi-directional links between politics and health at both individual- and community-levels.
