Title: The short- and long-term effects of the Great Recession on late-life depression in Europe: The role of area deprivation


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Introduction

The prevalence of depression increases in times of economic crises. Less is known about whether people living in advantaged or disadvantaged areas suffer equally from negative effects of crisis.

Abstract_Section: Objective

To explore the role of area deprivation on the short- and long-term effects of the Great Recession in Europe on late-life depression.

Abstract_Section: Methods

Individual panel data from Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland of the SHARE (age 50+, n = 6866) between 2004 and 2017 were used. Late-life depression (LLD) was measured by the EURO-D scale (4+ symptoms). Area deprivation was assessed by a country-specific z-standardized scale measuring perceived access to various services and quality of the social and built environment. Quarterly country-level GDP and yearly unemployment data were explored to define country-specific durations of the Great Recession. Individual fixed effects panel regressions were estimated controlling for time-varying socioeconomic and health-related confounders.

Abstract_Section: Results

Prevalence and incidence of late-life depression was generally higher in deprived than in non-deprived areas, and these differences in prevalence and incidence increased during the Great Recession. Regressions showed that the Great Recession was related to a 23% higher long-term risk of late-life depression (OR: 1.23, CI: 1.05–1.44) for all study participants. In the short-term of the Great Recession, people from deprived areas had a 22% higher risk of late-life depression (OR: 1.22, CI: 1.02–1.46) than people from non-deprived areas.

Abstract_Section: Conclusion

The findings suggest that older adults exposed to adverse area determinants suffer more from the negative short-term effects of a severe economic crisis on depression and mental health inequalities may have increased between people living in deprived versus non-deprived areas. This potential increase in mental health inequalities warrants particular attention for those people living in deprived areas.

Section: 1. Introduction

The World Health Organization estimated that the total number of people worldwide living with depression in 2015 was 322 million, which was 4.4% of the global population ( WHO World Health Organization, 2017 ). Depression was also the mental disorder with the highest prevalence in Europe ( Alonso et al., 2004 ; Wittchen et al., 2011 ). For adults ages 50 and older in 2015, estimations from 27 European countries in the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) showed a high prevalence of late-life depression (LLD) of 29% ( Horackova et al., 2019 ). Late-life depression is characterised by the presence of multiple minor depressive symptoms occurring in an older person (usually over 50 or 60 years of age) ( Blazer, 2003 ). Because depression is associated with a wide range of physical health comorbidities ( Smith et al., 2014 ), avoiding mental health problems and their risk factors can substantially reduce costs, morbidity, and mortality in Europe ( Wykes et al., 2015 ).
It is well known that individual-level risk factors, e.g. morbidities, limitations in activities of daily-living, unhealthy lifestyle, low or high BMI , and inactivity/loneliness contribute to the onset of late-life depression ( Aziz and Steffens, 2013 ). However, there is also growing evidence that economic crises at the macro-level are related to a higher risk of depression ( Economou et al., 2013 ; Frasquilho et al., 2016 , Weinberger et al., 2018 , see Parmar et al., 2016 for a literature review). Previous studies that focused on the individual-level factors involved revealed that this higher risk of depression was caused by unemployment, a decrease in well-being, and income losses, which in turn were affected by the altered macro-level economic situation ( Taplin et al., 2012 ). An economic crisis brings on (perceived) economic insecurity, unemployment, poverty, psychological distress and anxiety, and social stress ( Mucci et al., 2016 ), which are assumed to be some of the main drivers leading to depressive symptoms (Chang et al. 2016; Krishnan, 2002 ). Hence, these risk factors could directly increase the risk of depression, or they could translate into stressful life-events in the family or social peer-groups ( Li et al., 2019 ). Research suggests further that vulnerable social groups experienced disproportionate short-term losses in wage and health during the Great Recession ( Bacigalupe et al., 2016 ; Hoynes et al., 2012 ; Reibling et al., 2017 , Rugh and Massey, 2010 ). These authors defined “vulnerable” as pertaining to people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, e.g. (self-) employed people (compared to retired) or older people living alone.
Although it is well known that socioeconomic, physical, and social area-level characteristics are associated with the presence and severity of depression ( Beyer et al., 2014 ; Cohen-Cline et al., 2015 ; Fone et al., 2014 ; Generaal et al., 2019 ; Strachan et al., 2017 ), previous research on the effects of economic crises on depression has focused mainly on the effects of individual-level risk factors ( Bacigalupe et al., 2016 ; Hoynes et al., 2012 ; Reibling et al., 2017 , Rugh and Massey, 2010 ). There is rare evidence that the number of foreclosures at the area-level is associated with the onset of depression ( Cagney et al., 2014 ). Consequently, it is largely unknown whether people living in advantaged or disadvantaged areas suffer equally from negative effects of economic crises, once individual-level factors have been controlled for. Furthermore, most previous studies on the effect of a recession on mental health outcomes have focused on either the short- ( Mattei et al., 2014 ; Modrek et al., 2015 ) or on the long-term ( Forbes and Krueger, 2019 ; Wang and Fattore, 2020 ) effects; they did not regard the two of them.
This prospective cohort study explores the role of area deprivation as an important area-level dimension in the short- and long-term effects of the Great Recession on the risk of late-life depression among participants in Europe aged 50 and older. The Great Recession was treated as a case study , conducted in the design of a natural experiment, representing an example of a severe macro-level economic crisis. The Great Recession, a global economic downturn which had its climax between 2007 and 2009, was the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s ( Albers and Jonung, 2012 ). It is the most demonstrative example of a macro-level economic crisis in our times.
First, this study hypothesised that the Great Recession increased the risk of late-life depression in older people in Europe. Second, it was assumed that, due to previous findings on the mental health importance of area-level determinants, people living in deprived areas had a higher risk of LLD, especially in the years immediately following the Great (short-term), than did people from non-deprived areas.

Section: 2. Material and methods

This prospective cohort study used individual and household panel data from the cross-national and harmonised panel Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). SHARE focuses on the socioeconomic and health situation of adults aged 50 and older. It covers seven waves from 2004 to 2017, including information on more than 140,000 participants from 28 European countries ( Börsch-Supan et al., 2013 ). SHARE is conducted every two years according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Mannheim, Germany. The current study uses individual and household data from SHARE countries that participated in all waves conducted up to 2017, namely wave 1 (2004–2005), wave 2 (2006–2007), wave 4 (2011–2012), wave 5 (2013), wave 6 (2015), and wave 7 (2017) (see Fig. 1 for an illustration of the design).

Study design to explore the role of area deprivation in the effects of the Great Recession on the risk of late-life depression.
To define country-specific durations of the Great Recession (see further down), country-level economic data between 2004 and 2017 were used. This includes quarterly nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per head in US dollars from OECD calculated using the expenditure approach ( OECD, 2021 ), and yearly unemployment rates (UR) among people aged 15 to 74 at country-level from Eurostat based on labour force surveys (LFS) ( Eurostat, 2021 ).
The initial SHARE sample covered 95,534 participants aged 50 and over from the 9 countries which participated in all waves conducted (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland). To be eligible for the current study, people had to be aged 50 or over in the first wave (reducing the sample by 3046 participants), and needed to have valid information on LLD in both waves conducted before the Great Recession had started (wave 1 & wave 2) and at least in one wave thereafter (reducing by 82,345 participants).
Participants were also excluded if they had already been diagnosed as depressed by a doctor (n = 1746) before baseline (wave 1, 2004/05) in order to include only incident LLD cases during the observation time.
People who had relocated during the observation time (n = 1531) were removed because area deprivation could have changed in these cases. Consequently, 6866 participants at baseline (2004–2005) with a total of 33,788 observations during the analysis time could be studied for people living in these nine countries. Because the fixed effects models solely use changes within individuals over time, 3114 participants who had experienced changes in present/non-present LLD with 15,677 observations were included in the main model. In the sensitivity analysis using multi-level mixed effects models, the study population contained 6866 participants with 33,788 observations.
A recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth compared to a basis quarter ( Gaski, 2012 ). To encompass differing durations of the Great Recession (from here onwards Recession) per country, country-level GDP data were used in a descriptive/explorative fashion to identify country-specific SHARE waves defined as short-term effect (STE) and long-term effect (LTE) assessments. For this purpose, a categorical variable with three values was computed, indicating whether the outcome measure occurred either before the Recession had started, in the short run (= short-term effect (STE)), or in any of the waves thereafter (long-term effect (LTE)). The long-term effect consequently comprises the effect for at least one year after the Recession has ended (see Supplementary Figures 1 to 3 and their descriptions).
In SHARE, the EURO-D depression symptom scale was applied to measure late-life depression (LLD) which is characterised by the presence of multiple minor depressive symptoms occurring in an older person (usually over 50 or 60 years of age) ( Blazer, 2003 ).
EURO-D was developed in a European Union initiative by the EURODEP Concerted Action Programme consisting of 14 European geriatric centres and focused on late-life depression ( Prince et al., 1999 ). EURO-D consists of 12 items covering the following depression symptoms: (1) depressed mood , (2) pessimism , (3) suicidality, (4) guilt, (5) sleep trouble, (6) less interest in things, (7) irritability, (8) less appetite, (9) fatigue, (10) concentration problems, (11) enjoyment of almost nothing in life, and (12) tearfulness ( Castro-Costa et al., 2008 ).
In our study, a threshold of four was used to differentiate between LLD-free (0–3 depression symptoms) and LLD-prevalent (4–12 depression symptoms) cases, in line with the optimal cut-off point that was defined in previous validation studies ( Castro-Costa et al., 2008 ; Guerra et al., 2015 ; Prince et al., 1999 ).
Perceived area deprivation was computed as an own-calculated country-specific and relative measure using the items on area characteristics available in SHARE. Area deprivation in SHARE was assessed based on eight surveyed area characteristics measured at the household-level in wave 5 (2013). The items assessed the local built and social environment, as well as access to local infrastructure (see Supplementary Table 4 ). The items were representative for all household members based on responses by the household respondent ( Myck et al., 2015 ). In SHARE, the household respondent is usually defined as the household member who makes the main contribution to the household income.
The following items were answered using a 4-point-Likert-scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) and referred to the first dimension, namely the social and built environment: 1) feeling part of the area, 2) vandalism is a big problem in the area, 3) area is kept clean, 4) helpful people in the area. The other four items covered the second dimension, namely the accessibility to local infrastructure, and also used a 4-point-Likert-scale (very easy, easy, difficult, very difficult): 5) easy to get to the nearest bank or cash point, 6) easy to get to the grocery shop or supermarket, 7) easy to get to the nearest general practitioner or the health centre, 8) easy to get to the pharmacy. Because perceived area deprivation levels may differ between countries, ADI was then country-specific z-standardised (mean = 0, SD = 1). This was done using information from all participants of the SHARE to avoid potential selection bias. Values below or equal to zero were defined as a non-deprived area and values greater than zero as deprived area. Area deprivation was measured only in wave 5 (2013), so the resulting ADI was treated as a time-invariant variable for the entire observation time from 2004 to 2017. This was possible because only people who did not relocate during the observation time were part of the study population (find a detailed review of the used approach in the discussion).
At the individual level, time-varying confounders related to socio-demographics, social environment, lifestyle, and health/morbidity were controlled for because these had already been designated as relevant risk factors of depression in the literature ( Aziz and Steffens, 2013 ). Starting with the socio-demographic confounders, age in years (50–64, 65–79, 80+) and job status (retired, employed or self-employed, unemployed, permanently sick or disabled, homemaker, other, missing values) were used.
The lifestyle variables included were physical activity (yes, no), whereby activity means that participants do vigorous physical activity in daily life at least sometimes, such as sports, heavy housework or a job that involves physical labour, and Body-Mass-Index (BMI) (<18.5 underweight, 18.5–24.9 normal, 25–29.9 overweight, 30+ obesity, missing values).
Additionally, the models accounted for important health and morbidity confounders. Cognitive functioning, measured by episodic memory and recall of a 10-word list, was categorised in terciles. As a proxy for physical health/frailty, isometric grip strength of the stronger of both hands in kilograms was used, in addition to the number of prevalent limitations in Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) (0, 1, 2 or more). To control for co-morbidities, the number of chronic diseases (0, 1, 2 or more) was applied covering all available morbidities in SHARE, namely hypertension, high blood cholesterol , stroke or cerebral vascular disease , diabetes, chronic bronchitis or emphysema, asthma, arthritis, osteoporosis , cancer , stomach or duodenal ulcer , Parkinson disease , cataract , hip fracture or femoral fracture .
At the household level, the models considered, in a time-dependent fashion, whether participants were living together with a partner in a household (yes, no) and the household size (1, 2, 3, 4+).
The SHARE interviewers assessed if the participants’ residence was in a big city, the suburbs of a big city, a large town, a small town , or a rural area or village. This variable was categorised into a binary variable to divide between (time-invariant) urban (big city, suburb, large town, small town) and rural areas (rural area/village).
To determine if area deprivation moderated the short- and long-term effects of the Great Recession on the risk of late-life depression, binary logistic individual fixed effect (FE) models using within-estimators were applied. The advantage of such models is that they can control for person-specific time-constant (unobserved) heterogeneity, e.g. sex and country of residence ( Wooldridge, 2010 ) (1). Although time-invariant characteristics per se cannot be interpreted in FE models, interactions between a time-invariant and a time-dependent variable can be estimated. In this study, this was the case for the time-dependent effects of the Recession (exposure/treatment) on the risk of LLD (outcome of interest) in dependency of area deprivation (potential moderator).

Hausman tests were performed to test for endogeneity , the correlation between predictors and the error term, with the hypothesis that no correlation is present ( Hausman, 1978 ). All tests showed highly significant results (p < 0.001), confirming that random-effect models would not deliver consistent estimations.
In a sensitivity analysis, a multi-level model with mixed effects (ME) using random-intercepts for countries, households, and individuals were performed due to the hierarchical nature of the data (clustering over countries, households, and time per individual). An exchangeable correlation matrix was used for showing best model fit (lowest AIC). The between-individual effect is assumed to be random and the model was fitted by using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML).
The SHARE data are distributed to registered users only. However, to ensure openness, transparency, and reproducibility of our analyses, Supplementary Material including additional tables, figures, descriptions, and the script/code was provided on Mendeley Data ( Aretz, 2022 ).
After description of the sample, the main analyses were presented in two steps.
First, age-standardised prevalence and incidence rates of LLD in the study population over time were calculated separately for people living in deprived and non-deprived areas for 2004 to 2017. For the age-standardised rates, the 2013 European Standard Population developed by Eurostat ( European Commission. Eurostat, 2013 ) using the following age groups (population weights in brackets) was used: 50–64 (0.4875), 65–79 (0.3625), 80+ (0.1500).
Second, a multivariate FE model including an interaction term between the Recession and area deprivation was applied to find out whether general STE and LTE of the Recession existed, and/or if these effects depended on living in deprived or non-deprived areas.
A set of nine sensitivity analyses were performed. In the first, a model among non-household respondents only was estimated to check how relevant same source bias (moderator and outcome are subjectively measured) was. In sensitivity models 2 to 4, two interaction-terms, namely first for area deprivation and the GR and second for urban/rural area and GR, were incorporated stepwise. In sensitivity model 5, the main model was calculated among participants with at least four instead of three observations per participant in the main model to ensure that the results do not reflect only panel attrition effects. A sixth sensitivity model was applied among participants aged 65 and older, the age at which most participants were retired and had a stable income over time. This was done to exclude (missed) changing income was an important confounder. In sensitivity model 7, mixed effects using random intercepts for countries, households, and participants were estimated to validate the results gathered from the main FE models by regarding the hierarchical nature of the SHARE data.
To check if the results are robust when using the degree of depression as outcome two additional models were estimated. Sensitivity model 8 used the number of depressive symptoms as outcome and was performed using linear fixed effect regression with robust standard errors. Sensitivity model 9 used the degree of depression as outcome (0 symptoms = no depression, 1 symptom = very less depression, 2–3 symptoms = less depression, 4–5 symptoms = moderate depression, 6 symptoms = severe depression, 7+ symptoms = very severe depression) and an ordered logit FE model was performed.

7333 participants (21.70%) had at least in one wave prevalent LLD during the observation time from 2004 to 2017. The proportion of participants with LLD increased in each SHARE wave from initially 18.44% in 2004/05 to 24.77% in 2017.
In 2004/05 (at baseline), 34.47% of the participants had lived in deprived areas and this proportion increased slightly to 38.05% in 2017. In wave 1, 71.31% had lived in urban and 27.83% in rural areas. The proportion of participants who were living together with a partner in the same household decreased between 2005 and 2017 from 79.58% to 68.87% (see Supplementary Table S1 for descriptive statistics of all variables).
In 2004/05, the average age was 63.34 years and nearly half of them (49.55%) were retired. The proportion of retired increased to 81.95% in 2017. Over time, more people were physical inactive (5.94% in 2004/05 and 13.88% in 2017), fewer were free of chronic diseases (no disease in 2004/05: 27.75%, no disease in 2017: 17.92%). Fewer had limitations in ADL (none in 2004/05: 91.12%, none in 2017: 79.01%), and more people had low grip strength (22.88 kg in 2004/05 and 36.08 kg in 2017). The proportion of obese increased from 17.96% initially to 19.20% in 2017, as well as those who were underweight from 0.82% to 1.17%.
Starting with the prevalent cases ( Fig. 2 A) in the study population, a general and continuously existing higher level of LLD was present for participants who were living in deprived areas compared to those living in non-deprived area. In 2004/05, the prevalence of LLD tends to be higher in deprived areas (21.68%, 95% CI: 16.18–20.18) compared to participants from non-deprived areas (18.18%, 95% CI: 16.18–20.18).

Age-standardised prevalent (A) and incident (B) cases of late-life depression by area deprivation among study participants ages 50 and older from 9 European SHARE countries (2004–2017).
An increasing prevalence from 2004 to 2011 was visible for both deprived and non-deprived areas. However, the increase in LLD prevalence was stronger for deprived areas during this main period of the GR. In 2013, the prevalence rate showed then a decreasing trend for non-deprived areas (17.89%, 95% CI: 16.39–19.38), whereby the proportion of people with prevalent LLD has increased further to its all-time maximum of 25.93% (95% CI: 23.93–27.92) in deprived areas. In 2015, the two prevalence rates started to converge, but still with a higher level of prevalent LLD in deprived areas (26.04%, 95% CI: 23.47–28.62) compared to non-deprived areas (19.21%, 95% CI: 17.32–21.09).
Turning to the incidence rates ( Fig. 2 B), deprived areas tend to have a general higher level of incident LLD, but with a convergence of both incidence rates in 2017. An increasing trend was found for both non-deprived (11.28%, 95% CI: 10.03–12.53) and deprived (12.98%, 95% CI: 11.49–14.48) areas in 2011, the year with the highest incidence rates for both groups. Thereafter, the incident cases showed a slight but constant decreasing trend for people from deprived areas. In non-deprived areas, there was a marked decrease in LLD incidence in 2013 (9.03%, 95% CI: 7.91–10.16), but with a subsequent increasing trend.
All in all, prevalence and incidence of late-life depression was generally higher in deprived than in non-deprived areas, and these differences in prevalence and incidence increased during the Great Recession.
Panel fixed effects modelling showed no (stat. significant) general short-term effect (STE) by the Great Recession (GR) on late-life depression (LLD), but a stat. significant interaction between the STE and area deprivation on the risk of LLD ( Table 2 ). In fact, participants living in deprived areas, had a 22% higher short-term risk (OR: 1.22, CI: 1.02–1.46) of prevalent LLD compared to participants living in non-deprived areas. Table 2 .

Turning to the long-term effects of the GR, there was a general 23% (main effect LTE: OR: 1.23, CI: 1.05–1.44) higher risk of prevalent LLD, but no additional interaction effect, suggesting that the GR had the same negative LTE on LLD for participants from non-deprived and deprived areas. See Table 2 for the complete model results.
The different sensitivity analyses confirmed the observed findings from the main model and showed that area deprivation did not reflect only the differences between urban and rural areas. The first sensitivity analysis among non-household respondents only ( Supplementary Table S2 , Model 1) confirmed the findings of a general LTE from the main model. The STE for people from deprived areas lost significance due to a very low number of remaining observations (846 participants with 4533 observations). However, the point estimator also suggested a higher (non-significant) STE on LLD for people from deprived areas (OR: 1.13, 0.81–1.56).
Sensitivity models 2 to 4 ( Supplementary Table S2 , Model 2–4) revealed that, due to the inclusion of the interaction between GR and area deprivation, the general negative STE disappeared (see Supplementary Table S2 , Model 2 without interaction terms). The models underlined that participants from rural areas suffered more from the negative STE than did participants from urban areas (OR: 1.23, CI: 1.03–1.48) ( Supplementary Table S2 , Model 3). However, the inclusion of the interaction between the GR and urban/rural area did not explain the interaction effect between GR and area deprivation ( Supplementary Table S2 , Model 4). This underlined that area deprivation did not reflect only the differences between urban and rural areas.
Also, the sensitivity model 5 among participants with at least four instead of three LLD observations ( Supplementary Table S2 , Model 5), model 6 ( Supplementary Table S2 , Model 6) among participants aged 65 and older, and sensitivity model 7 (mixed effects) using random intercepts for countries, households and participants confirmed the results of the main model ( Supplementary Figure S4 ).
The models using the number of depressive symptoms (sensitivity model 8, Supplementary Table S3 ) or the degree of depression as outcome (sensitivity model 9, Supplementary Table S3 ) also confirmed the results from the main model. That is a 18% (OR: 1.18, CI: 1.06–1.31) higher risk of (more severe) depression in the long-run of the Great Recession and a 22% (OR: 1.22, CI: 1.07–1.38) higher short-term risk of (more severe) depression among participants living in deprived areas (ref. non-deprived areas) ( Fig. 3 ).

Sensitivity model 9 using the degree of depression as outcome: the role of area deprivation in the short- (STE) and long-term (LTE) effects of the Great Recession (GR) on the risk of late-life depression among study participants ages 50 and older from 9 European SHARE countries (2004–2017).

Section: 4. Discussion

This study found that the age-standardised prevalence and incidence rates of late-life depression tended to be generally higher in deprived than in non-deprived areas among adults aged 50 and older in Europe from 2004 to 2017. Trends in late-life depression prevalence suggested that the Great Recession was associated with a dispersion of prevalent late-life depression between participants from deprived and non-deprived areas. The panel fixed effects regression models confirmed this finding showing, in line with the first hypothesis, a general negative long-term effect (not short-term effect) by the Recession leading to a higher risk of late-life depression compared to the pre-recession period from 2004 to 2007. The interaction for area deprivation and the Recession showed, related to the second hypothesis, that people from deprived areas had a higher risk of late-life depression in the short run – but not in the long run - compared to people from non-deprived areas. The findings from the regression models were confirmed when the different degrees of depression or the number of depressive symptoms were used as outcomes.
The first interesting result of this study was that people from deprived areas had a higher risk of late-life depression in the short-run compared to people from non-deprived areas. This is in line with previous research on the effects of the Great Recession on health inequalities in Europe ( Bacigalupe et al., 2016 ; Hoynes et al., 2012 ; Margerison-Zilko et al., 2016 ; Reibling et al., 2017 , Rugh and Massey, 2010 ). These previous studies found that especially groups, which are characterised by precarious or vulnerable determinants, were immediately affected by the financial crisis. People with precarious socio-economic, life style and health characteristics are, beyond this, more likely to live in unfavourable and deprived neighbourhoods ( Jokela, 2014 ). Previous studies have already explored possible mediation paths of how area deprivation might amplify the impact of a recession on the onset of depression in later life over individual-level characteristics (potential mediators). There is evidence that the perceived job insecurity of socio-economic vulnerable groups , which more likely live in deprived areas than in non-deprived areas ( Jokela, 2014 ), may have already increased in the short-term of the Great Recession ( Burgard et al., 2012 ). This was especially the case for the oldest workers, who felt much more insecure than middle-aged workers ( Kuroki, 2015 ). A longitudinal study based on the European Social Survey found that particularly poor mental health increased among inactive and precariously employed people ( Reibling et al., 2017 ). Our results showed a higher risk of late-life depression for inactive people as well. A critical literature review on the health impacts of the Great Recession concluded that especially men and racial/ethnic minorities were severely hit by the crisis ( Margerison-Zilko et al., 2016 ). We also know that the youngest and oldest workers with low levels of education have experienced disproportionate losses ( Hoynes et al., 2012 ).
These existing studies, however, explored only individual-level factors and did not show that area-level characteristics have a (moderating) impact on the relationship between a Recession and late-life depression. And, this effect moderation by area deprivation was still visible in our study when the impact of important individual-level pathways was eliminated. One potential explanation for this finding is that entry barriers to (potentially new) jobs and perceived financial insecurity are generally higher in deprived areas. We know that people with disadvantaged socio-economic, life style, and health characteristics often perceive their jobs as being insecure ( Khubchandani and Price, 2017 ) and these people are more likely to live in deprived areas ( Jokela, 2014 ). In this study, deprived areas were characterised by longer distances to stores and a lack of public services, which may also be accompanied by worse job opportunities in the immediate surrounding. Beyond this, previous research found that the recession-induced perceived financial insecurity in the neighbourhood, e.g. caused by foreclosures, may have contributed to the onset of depression in the long-term ( Cagney et al., 2014 ). It could have lasted longer, until perceived financial insecurity also reached people who were living in non-deprived areas, perhaps due to higher job security among higher-educated people. This would explain why this study found that in the short-run the Great recession was related to late-life depression among participants from deprived areas only, but in the long-run among both people from non-deprived and deprived areas. Another explanation is that a higher quality of the living environment (higher social cohesion , more green spaces, more recreational opportunities) in non-deprived areas promotes coping strategies to deal with an increase of anxiety and stress, especially during a financial crisis. Non-deprived areas offer more resources to promote stress reduction, so that the negative short-term effect of a financial crisis can (at least partially) be cushioned. It is accordingly well documented that area deprivation per se erodes social cohesion ( Bécares et al., 2011 ), and higher levels of social cohesion are in turn related to a lower risk of late-life depression ( Yamaguchi et al., 2019 ). In addition to social cohesion, less deprived and favourable areas provide green spaces for recovery and physiological stress reduction ( Hedblom et al., 2019 ), and are less often characterised by food insecurity ( Jessiman-Perreault and McIntyre, 2017 ). Moreover, people from deprived areas may have worse labour market accessibility, which could strengthen the effect of perceived job insecurity and a potential job loss ( Damm, 2014 ).
The finding that the Great Recession is related to a higher long-term risk of late-life depression is in line with previous studies, which found negative long-term effects of recessions on different (changing) mental health outcomes, e.g. depression, anxiety or general mental health ( Bacigalupe et al., 2016 ; Banks et al., 2020 ; Marshall, 2020 ; Witteveen and Velthorst, 2020 ). In this, the pathway over (over time cumulated) self-perceived financial insecurity, which may, among others, be affected by spillover effects of the social environment, could also play an important role. Furthermore, perceived unemployment and income downturns in the family could also explain the increased long-term risk of depression caused by recessions ( Ström, 2003 ), which had already been shown in a panel study among adults in Australia ( Bubonya et al., 2017 ). In analogy to the family stress theory ( Conger et al., 1994 ), but in a reversed fashion, unemployment and income downturns of one's own children may promote (inter-) parental conflicts and anxieties, subsequently leading to a higher risk of depression. Stressful life events in the family pose one directly-related major risk factor of depression ( Caspi et al., 2003 ) and can bring on anxiety disorder ( Taher et al., 2015 ). Due to the higher (perceived) job security of family members, this effect may have been only observed in the long-term for people from non-deprived areas ( Esser and Olsen, 2012 ). As an epidemiological pathway, existing research suggests that stressful life events lead to a reduction in hippocampal volume and thus to a higher risk of depression ( Zannas et al., 2013 ).
This is one of the first studies to explore the role of area characteristics in the relationship between an economic crisis and depression, and it has some important strengths.
First, our outcome of interest, late-life depression measured by the EURO-D scale, is a widely (and cross-cultural) validated measure ( Castro-Costa et al., 2008 ; Guerra et al., 2015 ; Larraga et al., 2006 ), which was developed specifically to measure depression among participants in older ages, and thus fitted well for the older SHARE population. In contrast to using depression diagnoses by a doctor, as has been done in studies using administrative/claims data ( Steffen et al., 2020 , Wulsin et al., 2014 ), EURO-D also pinpoints undetected depression among participants who did not consult a doctor and thus did not receive a diagnosis. There is evidence that these latter data suffer from undercoding and underreporting of depression prevalence ( Doktorchik et al., 2019 ).
Second, country-specific durations of the Great Recession were examined by using time series and country-specific GDP and unemployment data, and were additionally validated by calculations conducted by Eurostat based on EU-SILC data ( OECD, 2018 ). Previous studies have mainly compared changed health between pre- and post-recession periods ( Reeves et al., 2014 ; Riumallo-Herl et al., 2014 ).
Third, the measure used for area deprivation was country-specific standardized and thus of a relative nature, so that varying levels of perceived area deprivation between countries were considered.
Despite the strengths of this study, there are some limitations.
First, the SHARE data were surveyed only every two years. This came with limitation of a (potential) certain delay between the true country-specific durations of the Great Recession and the SHARE data. Beyond this, wave 3, which was conducted from 2008 to 2009 when the Great Recession had its climax, did not contain information on LLD. It was thus not possible to include the very short-term effects of the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009 in the analyses.
Second, same source bias is especially relevant when using self-rated/perceived environmental characteristics in combination with mental health outcomes, e.g. depression. Depressed people are more likely to rate their environment negatively; people without depression more positively. Sensitivity model 1 ( Table 2 , model 1) among non-household respondents only (= those not answering the environmental questions) confirmed the findings of the main model, but the interaction effect for the Great Recession and area deprivation lost significance due to the small number of observations. To deal further with this limitation, an interaction model (results not shown) was calculated, including a 3-way interaction term for Great Recession, area deprivation and a variable indicating whether a participant was the household respondent, from whom the information on area deprivation came or not. There was no difference in the effect between household respondents and other household members, suggesting that same source bias plays a subordinate role. Beyond this, previous research showed that subjective neighbourhood characteristics are more relevant for mental health than objectively measured features ( Zhang et al., 2019 ), why perceived area determinants are of high interest.
Third, area deprivation was measured only in SHARE wave 5 (year 2013), when the climax of the Great Recession had already passed so that a post-treatment moderator was used. Post-treatment moderator bias occurs when the moderator is a consequence of the treatment ( Montgomery et al., 2018 ). To attempt to address this issue, area deprivation as a time-constant variable was used. This was possible by focusing on participants who had not relocated over time to keep area deprivation stable as possible. Previous research suggests that local areas have a high degree of stability/persistency in their relative position and thus their relative deprivation over time ( Dorling, 2007 ). However, this bias cannot be ruled out.
Fourth, this observational study was able to disentangle the temporal directionality of cause, e.g. the Great Recession, and outcome, e.g. the risk of depression, by using panel data and a natural-experimental design. However, due to the explained methodological limitations and potentially omitted time-varying confounding variables, this study is not able to unveil causality of these effects assuredly.
This study suggests that people living in deprived areas suffered more from the negative effects on late-life depression in the short run, but it is not able to unveil real causality due to the explained methodological limitations. This study is rather a building block in establishing causal inference and experimental designs are needed to ensure internal validity. Future observational studies may focus more on underlying pathways why people living in deprived environment are more susceptible to negative mental health effects of economic crises. Having worse copying strategies and less social, economic and cultural capital could be important disadvantages of people living in deprived areas ( Conger et al., 1994 ; Damm, 2014 ; Hedblom et al., 2019 ; Khubchandani and Price, 2017 ; Yamaguchi et al., 2019 ), which should be evaluated as potential mediators in subsequent research.

Section: 5. Conclusion

An advantaged living environment may provide protective resources for mental health, even in times of economic insecurity. Public attention on better area and living environment quality is important to avoid increasing mental health inequalities. The findings are particularly relevant given the contemporary COVID-19 recession, and warrant particular attention for those people living in deprived areas.
