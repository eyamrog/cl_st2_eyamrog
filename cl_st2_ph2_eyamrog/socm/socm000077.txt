Title: Degree of influence in class modifies the association between social network diversity and well-being: Results from a large population-based study in Japan


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Social network diversity can be associated with physical and mental health among adolescents, which might be modified by their perceived degree of influence in class. We aimed to examine the association between social network diversity and physical and mental health, and to elucidate its effect modification by perceived degree of influence in class.

Abstract_Section: Methods

Data were obtained from the Kochi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (K-CHILD) study in 2016, which targeted 5th, 8th and 11th grade children living in Kochi Prefecture in Japan (N = 9998). Social network diversity accounted for the number of social roles in which adolescents had regular contact. Degree of influence in class, depression (using Depression Self-Rating Scale for children (DSRS)) and self-rated health were assessed by children, and behavior problem and prosocial behavior (using Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)) was assessed by caregivers.

Abstract_Section: Results

Significant association of social network diversity with depression (Coefficient (B) = −0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.68 to −0.50), self-rated health (B = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.11), behavior problem (B = −0.71, 95% CI = −0.82 to −0.61) and prosocial behavior (B = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.11) were found. The association with depression and self-rated health was stronger among children with perceived low degree of influence (both p for interaction < 0.001). A similar trend was observed for behavior problem (p for interaction = 0.053), but effect modification was not found for the association between social network diversity and prosocial behavior .

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Social network diversity was beneficial for adolescent physical and mental health, especially for children with perceived lower degree of influence in class.

Section: 1. Introduction

Adolescence is characterized by the transition from childhood to adulthood in terms of environmental changes, that is, spending more time with peers than family, or receiving more expectations from society ( Choudhury, 2009 ). To adapt such changes, adolescents become biologically more sensitive towards social contexts ( Andersen and Teicher, 2008 ; Dumontheil, 2016 ; Kilford et al., 2016 ; Paus et al., 2008 ; Schriber and Guyer, 2016 ), specifically social relationship from both structural (e.g., social network) and functional (e.g., social support) perspectives ( Kawachi and Berkman, 2001 ). The social brain , the brain region involving social perception and cognition, develops the most during adolescents ( Kilford et al., 2016 ). As a result, social networks have tremendous impacts on adolescent life. For example, adolescents were highly vulnerable to social pressure compared with both younger children and adults ( Gardner and Steinberg, 2005 ), and tended to imitate peer's risk behavior due to peer pressure ( Gardner and Steinberg, 2005 ; Steinberg, 2008 ). However, apart from the negative effects, younger people can benefit from social networks since they could perceive more social support ( Hann et al., 2002 ), which led to less depressive symptoms ( Nolen-Hoeksema and Aldao, 2011 ). Considering the both sides of social networks, an elucidation of their roles on adolescent health is needed.
Social network has been assessed in several dimensions, including the number of high-contact roles, the number of people in network, and the number of embedded networks as assessed by social network index ( Cohen et al., 1997 ), and further rearranged as network diversity, size of network and network boundedness, respectively ( Berkman et al., 2000 ). Among those, social network diversity can provide the insights on the various networks including community or family, which is also an important resource for adolescents ( Brooks-Gunn et al., 1993 ; Chu et al., 2010 ; Mason et al., 2009 ; Warner and Settersten, 2017 ). Adult studies reported that those with affluent social network diversity showed better physical conditions ( Ali et al., 2018 ), including greater subjective well-being ( Rafnsson et al., 2015 ) and lesser risk of infectious disease ( Cohen et al., 1997 ; Hamrick et al., 2002 ) and heart disease ( Barefoot et al., 2005 ). Also having diverse social network was associated with greater amygdala volume ( Bickart et al., 2011 ) and brain connectivity ( Molesworth et al., 2015 ), both of them might be related to less psychiatric and socioemotional symptoms ( Caetano et al., 2004 ; Hanson et al., 2015 ) and better social skills ( De Pisapia et al., 2014 ). However, the study targeting adolescents mostly focused on networks within classes or among peers ( Chu et al., 2010 ; Falci and McNeely, 2009 ; Gardner and Steinberg, 2005 ; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2012 ; Nangle et al., 2003 ; Strauss and Pollack, 2003 ; Ueno, 2005 ), with social network diversity being paid less attention. Exploring the role of social network diversity, which covers a variety of network resources for children, would be beneficial for health promotion .
Social rank was defined as one's perceptions of the degree to which one feels inferior to others and looked down on (Paul Gilbert, 2000 ), or vice versa. According to the social rank theory, in the human context, while those in higher hierarchy tends to resort to aggressive behavior to maximize their gain ( Allan and Gilbert, 2002 ; Fournier et al., 2002 ), those who rate themselves at lower rank tends to act submissively and subordinately to avoid direct confrontation with those in higher rank, leading to, however, loss of social acceptance, approval and support (Paul Gilbert, 2000 ). As a result, those with low social rank may suffer from depression and social anxiety (Paul Gilbert, 2000 ).
We hypothesized that lower ranked children in class could receive the benefit of social network diversity on health ( Oldenburg and Brissett, 1982 ) more than upper-status children who are less vulnerable to life threats or rank appraisal ( Fournier et al., 2002 ), who might be therefore less likely to be affected by social network diversity. Social network diversity could provide lower-ranked children a positive role model ( Keller and Blakeslee, 2014 ) or other peers, which alters coping style ( Nakanishi et al., 2019 ) or decreases health-risk behaviors ( Yancey et al., 2002 ). On the other hand, higher-ranked children have more control over their social environments (P Gilbert et al., 2002 ) and might be less likely to be affected by social network diversity due to limited space to improve their personality related to higher rank ( Korndörfer et al., 2015 ; Sapolsky, 2005 ). Although measuring adolescent social rank is challenging, based on definition of social rank as the degree of influence one possesses over resource allocation and group decision ( Berger et al., 1980 ), asking participants of their subjective degree of influence over peers to capture the social rank could be warranted.
To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies that consider the effects of child perceived social rank among peers on the association between social network and child health status . Notably, elucidating the effect modification could clarify who will benefit from social network, which in turn enables the identification of the target population and to promote more effective interventions ( Kawachi and Berkman, 2001 ). Thus, the current study aimed to 1) elucidate the association between child social network diversity and well-being measured with depressive symptoms, self-rated health, problem behavior and prosocial behavior , and 2) examine the moderating role of the degree of influence on the relationship between network and well-being.

Section: 2. Methods

We used the data from the Kochi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (K-CHILD) study, which is a cross-sectional study conducted in 2016 that aimed to examine the living environment and health of children and their caregivers in Kochi Prefecture, Japan . The questionnaires were distributed to all the students who enrolled in 5th, 8th and 11th school grade in Kochi prefecture except for those who go to correspondence high schools and one special needs school. Totaled 18,290 children received questionnaires at class, and we received 11,186 valid responses (response rate: 61.2%). Considering the difference in collection methods (in Kochi City the questionnaires were returned via mail while outside of Kochi City it was done via schools), we adjusted the responses by weighting with the inversed response rates among cities. Responses without answers to the questions of interests such as social network diversity, degree of influence, depressive symptoms, self-rated health, behavior problems and prosocial behavior were excluded. The total number of analytic samples was 9998 (response rate: 54.7%) (see Fig. 1 ). Download: Download high-res image (489KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 . Sampling flowchart.

Section: 3. Measurements

Child social network diversity measures the number of social roles that the children contacted with regularly in their social networks, and was retrieved and modified from Cohen's Social Network Index ( Cohen et al., 1997 ) to fit the context of Japanese students. The social roles assessed were parents, siblings, grandparents, school, neighbors, club activities, and friends. The social roles in parents, siblings and grandparents reflected whether or not the children cohabited with those people. Social role in school was assessed by whether or not they had been absent from school for more than one month, which was justified by the participation-identification model, i.e., a lack of bonding with school increases the likelihood of leaving school or school absenteeism ( Finn, 1989 ). Social role in neighbors was assessed by whether they participated in events held in their local communities since social network is the key facilitator of events or movement participation ( Kitts, 2000 ). Social role in club activities was assessed by asking parents about the monthly expenses for their child's extracurricular activities (such as cram school or sports club). Social role in friends was assessed by whether they had close friends or acquaintances within the class, outside of the class and outside of the school. Cohabitant statuses and social role in club activities were assessed by caregivers and other roles were assessed by children themselves. All responses were dichotomized as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each role to indicate whether they had a relationship with each role. The arithmetic sum of these relationships was defined as child social network diversity.
We asked “how influential are your opinions and behaviors on your class mates?” to children and they answered from “1 = not at all” to “4 = very much”. For the analysis, we divided them into “lower degree of influence” and “higher degree of influence” by categorizing those who have chosen “4 = very much” and “3 = to some extent” as higher, while others as lower.
The Depression Self-Rating Scale (DSRS) is a questionnaire for self-assessment of depressive symptoms ( Birleson, 1981 ). We used the Japanese version of the DSRS, which was translated and modified from the English version by omitting two items to avoid psychological invasion ( Sato and Arai, 2002 ). We also excluded one item, “I like talking with my family”, to avoid biased answers since the children might respond in the presence of their caregivers who might exert an influence on the response. In total, 15 items were answered in the current study and they were rated from “0 = never” to “2 = most of the time”. The total score was calculated by summing up all the rated values (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84), ranging from 0 to 30. A higher score indicated more severe depressive symptoms.
Self-rated Health (SRH) was assessed with the question, “How do you feel about your health condition?”, and the response was rated from “1 = not good” to “5 = good”. SRH for children was confirmed as an indicator of various aspects of physical and psychological health ( Fosse and Haas, 2009 ) and known to reflect current health condition ( Boardman, 2006 ).
Child behavior problems were assessed by caregivers using the Japanese version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) ( Goodman, 1997 ; Matsuishi et al., 2008 ). SDQ included five subscales, each of which scored from 0 to 10. The total difficulties score was calculated to sum up the score of subscales of emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship problems and ranged 0 to 40. The other subscale was prosocial behavior. Cronbach's alpha of total difficulties score and prosocial behavior were 0.81 and 0.72, respectively in the current study. Higher score in total difficulties indicates more behavior problem while higher score in prosocial behavior suggests more favorable, prosocial behavior.

Section: 4. Covariates

As potential confounders, we further assessed following sample characteristics; school grade (5th, 8th and 11th), gender (boys, girls), respondents to the questionnaire for caregivers (mother, father, others), caregiver's marital status (married, divorced, bereaved, unmarried), maternal age , difference in paternal and maternal ages, maternal educational level (junior school, high school, university, unknown), paternal occupation (full-time, part-time, unemployed, seeking employment), household income, respondent's SRH (1–5), respondent's depressive symptoms with K6 ( Furukawa et al., 2008 ; Kessler et al., 2002 ), parent-child positive interaction score ( Kizuki et al., 2018 ), number of maltreatment ( Isumi et al., 2018 ) and respondent's social network diversity assessing the number of roles in parent, child, close relatives, close friend, student, employee, neighbor and other group membership. As for difference in paternal and maternal age , the previous studies showed both maternal ( Fergusson and Woodward, 1999 ) and paternal age ( Janecka et al., 2017 ) were risk factors for child socioemotional development . Considering the high correlation between maternal and paternal age, we adjusted for parental age difference. In addition, parental age gap itself could be also risk factor for child health ( Sandin et al., 2016 ). Also, based on the studies showing difference in social network among different aged adults ( Child and Lawton, 2019 ; Wrzus et al., 2013 ), we hypothesized parental age might affect child social network diversity as well. Thus, we adjusted for maternal age and parental age difference.
We also adjusted for respondent's depressive symptoms because we hypothesized parental mental health might affect child behavior within their society (child social network) and there are evidence relating parental mental health and child mental health ( Downey and Coyne, 1990 ).

Section: 5. Analysis

We examined the association between social network diversity and well-being with a linear regression model. We first analyzed with a categorical variable for social network diversity and found dose-response association (see supplementary figure 1 and supplementary table 1 ), therefore we presented the only results including a continuous variable for social network diversity and further analyses were done as a continuous variable. Also, in order to examine the impact of effect modification by degree of influence, we further conducted the linear regression with interaction term between social network diversity and degree of influence, which was further stratified by higher and lower degree of influence. In model 1, we adjusted for child characteristics (i.e., school grade, gender), and family socioeconomic status (i.e., caregiver's marital status, respondents, maternal age , parental age difference, maternal educational level, paternal occupation and household income) to account for the confounders on social network and well-being. In model 2, we added quality of family environment (i.e., respondent's self-rated health, respondent's K6 score, parent-child positive interaction score, number of maltreatment and respondent's social network diversity) as covariates for adjustment of potential confounders of the association between self-rated degree of influence and well-being. As a sensitivity analysis, stratification by degree of influence was redone using an initially assessed 4-point scale. All analyses were done with STATA 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).
Since the association between social network diversity and degree of influence might be different according to gender and school grade considering the previous studies reporting gender and age difference in social network ( Xie et al., 2003 ) and sex difference in behaviors attributable to social rank ( Foerster et al., 2016 ), we further stratified the analysis by gender (boys and girls) and grades (5th, 8th and 11th).

Section: 6. Ethics

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University (M2017-243).

Section: 7. Results

In the analytical sample, the ratio of 5th, 8th and 11th grade children were 28.4%, 32.5% and 39.1%, respectively. Boys made up 46.7% and children with higher degree of influence made up 56.2%. Most respondents were mothers (86.9%) and 80.9% of them were married. A sizeable number of households declared their income to be between JPY3.00M–5.99M (31.1%). The average total K6 score was 3.33. The characteristics were also shown by social network diversity. Children with larger social network diversity were younger, more girls and showed higher socioeconomic status. In addition, parents showed fewer depressive symptoms and larger social network diversity. More detailed characteristics including characteristics stratified by social network diversity are shown in Table 1 . Also, characteristics across the levels of child's degree of influence are shown in supplementary table 2 . Children with higher degree of influence were younger and boys, and whose parents rated themselves healthier and reported fewer depressive symptoms, more parent-child positive interaction and social network diversity.

Table 3 shows the results of regression analysis of the association between social network diversity and well-being. After fully adjusting for all the variables, social network diversity showed linear association with each outcome. The more diversity children had, the less depressive symptoms (regression coefficient (B) = −0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) = −0.68 to −0.50) and behavior problem (B = −0.71; 95% CI = −0.82 to −0.61) they showed. Also, the diversity was positively associated with self-rated health (B = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.11) and prosocial behavior (B = 0.06; 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.11). The results of regression with interaction term and stratified regression analysis can be found in Table 4 and Fig. 2 , respectively. The interaction between social network diversity and degree of influence was significant when depressive symptoms and self-rated health were assessed (B = −0.07, 95% CI = −0.11 to −0.03; B = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.40). We observed stronger effect of social network diversity for children with lower degree of influence. Those with lower degree of influence showed less depressive symptoms (B = −0.59 vs −0.38; 95% CI = −0.72 to −0.46 vs −0.50 to −0.27), higher self-rate health (B = 0.09 vs 0.05; 95% CI = 0.06 to 0.13 vs 0.02 to 0.08) and fewer behavior problems (B = −0.75 vs −0.55; 95% CI = −0.90 to −0.59 vs −0.69 to −0.42) as social network diversity increased, and the association was weaker among those with higher degree of influence.

We further stratified according to gender ( Supplementary table 3 ) and school grades ( Supplementary table 4 ). The association between self-rated health and social network diversity was different by degree of influence among girls, that is, girls with lower degree of influence showed more increase in self-rated health as increase in social network diversity. The same effect modifications were found in stratified analysis by school grades, that is, children with older age group showed stronger association between social network diversity and self-rated health.

Section: 8. Discussion

In the current study, social network diversity showed positive association with child physical and mental well-being, that is, children with more diverse social network had fewer depressive symptoms, higher self-rated health, less behavior problem and more prosocial behavior. Furthermore, these relationships were stronger in children with lower degree of influence in class than children with higher degree, indicating social network diversity might promote well-being for children with lower degree of influence more.
Our study showed consistent results with previous studies showing positive association between social network diversity and mental and physical health ( Barefoot et al., 2005 ; Cohen et al., 1997 ; Hamrick et al., 2002 ; Molesworth et al., 2015 ) and confirmed it in adolescents. In the previous studies, social network diversity was linearly associated with better physical health such as having less infectious and heart diseases, which was due to favorable impact on health behavior such as refraining from smoking and promotion of exercise ( Cohen et al., 1997 ), feeling of self-worth and purpose associated with various social roles ( Barefoot et al., 2005 ). Also, social network diversity might biologically enhance health status by changing brain structure ( Molesworth et al., 2015 ), or increase immune response ( Cohen et al., 1997 ). As for mental health, social network diversity was known to buffer the negative effects of toxic environmental exposures and stressors ( Kawachi and Berkman, 2001 ). Social network diversity itself might be beneficial by preventing children from isolation, which has an impact especially on psychological health ( Hall-Lande et al., 2007 ).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the moderating role of degree of influence in class on the association between social network diversity and well-being among adolescents. A previous study revealed that influential individuals, whose behavior tended to affect other's behavior, were unlikely to be influenced by others, whereas susceptible individuals, who easily changed their behaviors based on those of others, tended to be influenced by others ( Aral and Walker, 2012 ). This previous study supported our dichotomized assessment of degree of influence with the assumption that individuals tend not to have two properties simultaneously. Furthermore, it provided an insight to our results, i.e., those who rated themselves as having lower degree of influence might be susceptible individuals and could be affected by social network diversity more than influential peers, which partially explain why children with lower degree of influence showed stronger association between diversity in social network and health. In addition, social network diversity might be beneficial for children with lower degree of influence in class since they might be accepted outside of class and could enhance well-being, which is more plausible as their network diversity increases. On the contrary, for children with higher degree of influence in class may already have sufficient well-being in class, creating a ceiling effect that may explain the differential association of social network diversity with well-being by the degree of influence in class.
In addition, we found that girls with lower degree of influence showed stronger association between social network diversity and self-rated health than girls with higher degree of influence, which was not true among boys. Although we could not deny the potential chance findings, this can be explained by the differential ability of help-seeking behavior by gender ( Ando et al., 2018 ), that is, boys are less likely to ask help than girls, thus girls can seek help using the diverse social network even in the lower degree of influence, while boys reluctant to seek help, regardless of degree of influence, thus we found stronger association between social network diversity and self-rated health among girls with lower degree of influence.
Nonetheless, our study had several limitations. First, response rate was lower in Kochi City. Although we weighted using inversed response rates, sampling bias might exist. In addition, considering the distribution of child social network diversity, we might have lost samples with less diversed social network. Second, we assessed social network diversity by summing up the number of social roles children had on a daily basis. Our assessment process might ignore the differential importance in each role on child well-being ( Bokhorst et al., 2010 ; Garnefski and Diekstra, 1996 ) since we assumed every node had the same value. Also, we did not take into account other social network measurement besides diversity, such as size ( Hatzenbuehler et al., 2012 ; Ueno, 2005 ) and quality ( Falci and McNeely, 2009 ; Nangle et al., 2003 ), both of which were found to be associated with child mental health . Although some studies, albeit among adults, revealed stronger association of diversity than size with health ( Ali et al., 2018 ), further detailed assessments of social network diversity and its association with other measurements are warranted. Third, for depressive symptoms and self-rated health, common method bias might exist. However, our measurements could be justified as parents tended to underreport symptoms ( Van Roy et al., 2010 ), and there might be disparities between parental and self-assessment on child behavior ( Kramer et al., 2004 ; Lambert et al., 2009 ), mental health ( Lambert et al., 2009 ) and behavior problem ( Lambert et al., 2009 ; Van Roy et al., 2010 ). We overcome the shortcoming by analyzing both self and caregiver's evaluation on the outcome. The weaker effect modification on the association of social network diversity with behavior problem was not only due to the confounding by child emotional state, but also parental underreporting, indicating potential stronger impacts on child health enhancement. Forth, child social rank was assessed subjectively with questionnaires. Some studies assessed social rank according to the status relationship within the work place (i.e., coworkers, supervisors) ( Fournier et al., 2002 ) and socioeconomic status (SES) ( Korndörfer et al., 2015 ); however, adolescent social rank, especially within class, could not be evaluated with such instruments considering their relative homogenous status in class (i.e., peer students) and potential discordance between parental SES and child social rank in class. Moreover, observations by researchers, such as those done in monkey studies ( Abbott et al., 2003 ), are not applicable to human. In psychology, social rank has been evaluated subjectively by asking participants of their feelings and behaviors in relation to others ( Allan and Gilbert, 2002 ; Paul Gilbert, 2000 ; P Gilbert et al., 2002 ). However, this conventional type of assessment only focused on strategies to acquire higher rank, i.e., dominance, which uses force and intimidation to induce fear, and ignored prestige strategy that share expertise and gain respect ( Cheng et al., 2013 ). These two strategies are related to gaining more influence on others ( Cheng et al., 2013 ). Considering those drawbacks in the measurement in the preceding studies, ours overcame somehow by asking degree of influence, which is more in line with the definition ( Berger et al., 1980 ) albeit subjective assessment. Fifth, since our study design was cross-sectional, the inferring of causality was limited in terms of potential reverse relationship between depression and social network ( Olsson, 1998 ). However, our significant results warranted future research, including those on objective measurement of degree of influence and longitudinal study .
Although we could not infer causality due to the cross-sectional design of the current study and potential reverse causation, together with the substantial number of findings associating social network and health outcomes ( Chu et al., 2010 ; Cohen et al., 1997 ; Falci and McNeely, 2009 ; Gardner and Steinberg, 2005 ; Hamrick et al., 2002 ; Hatzenbuehler et al., 2012 ; Molesworth et al., 2015 ; Nangle et al., 2003 ; Strauss and Pollack, 2003 ; Ueno, 2005 ), we might say increasing social network diversity would be worth to consider as a potential intervention. On top of the long-standing relation between social network and health, our study revealed the effect modification by the degree of influence, such that provision of social network diversity would be beneficial for children with lower degree of influence, although it would be difficult to detect children with lower degree of influence objectively. Future study should aim to elucidate the characteristics of those who rated themselves as lower degree of influence, and employ multiple assessment resources including school teachers.
In conclusion, we showed a linear association between social network diversity and child well-being. In addition, a dose-response association was strongly observed in children with lower degree of influence in class, implying social network diversity and social rank in class would be clues for enhancement of child well-being. Future study is expected to employ longitudinal design to overcome the potential reverse causation of our findings and to include various assessments on child social rank and social network to elucidate potential interventions.
