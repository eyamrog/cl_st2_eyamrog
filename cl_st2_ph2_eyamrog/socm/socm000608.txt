Title: Is mammography screening an effective public health intervention? Evidence from a natural experiment


Abstract: Abstract

Population-based breast screening programmes aim to improve clinical outcomes, alleviate health inequalities, and reduce healthcare costs. However, while screening can bring about immediate changes in mode of presentation and stage at diagnosis of breast cancer cases, the benefits and harms of these programmes can only be observed at a population level, and only over a long enough timeframe for the cascade of events triggered by screening to culminate in disease-specific mortality reductions. In this paper we exploit a natural experiment resulting from the phased geographic rollout of a national mammography screening programme to examine the impact of screening on breast cancer outcomes from both a patient cohort and a population perspective. Using data on 33,722 breast cancer cases over the period 1994–2011, we employ a difference-in-differences research design using ten-year follow-up data for cases diagnosed before and after the introduction of the programme in screened and unscreened regions. We conclude that although the programme produced the intended intermediate effects on breast cancer presentation and incidence, these failed to translate into significant decreases in overall population-level mortality, though screening may have helped to reduce socioeconomic disparities in late stage breast cancer incidence.

Section: 1. Introduction

Population-based mammography (breast) screening is designed to improve clinical outcomes, alleviate health inequalities, and reduce healthcare costs. Achieving these objectives is conditional on screening programmes improving access to screening and diagnosis, increasing the proportion of cases that are detected early when treatment is more effective, and reducing the demand for more invasive and costly treatment of advanced disease . Breast screening is a well-established public health intervention that is provided in some form in all European countries, and it is estimated that 79% of the total female population between the ages of 50–69 in the EU have received an invitation to screening, with 49% having been screened ( Peintinger, 2019 ). Nonetheless, despite a long history of publicly-funded provision, considerable uncertainty remains about whether contemporary mammography screening programmes are delivering these anticipated benefits, as well as the scale of potential harms from screening (Bromley et al., 2019 ; Løberg et al., 2015 ). In this paper, we exploit a natural experiment resulting from the phased implementation of a national mammography screening programme in Ireland to examine outcomes from both a patient cohort and a population perspective.
The evidence to support the introduction of breast screening originated from eleven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 1963 and 1991. Taken together, these trials suggested a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality due to mammography screening ( Marmot et al., 2013 ), although the quality of some of this evidence is disputed ( Gøtzsche and Jørgensen, 2013 ). More recent studies evaluating the effectiveness of population screening programmes using observational data have produced diverse estimates of benefits, ranging from little or no effect to mortality reductions greater than those observed in the RCTs ( Irvin and Kaplan, 2014 ). There has also been widespread debate in relation to ‘overdiagnosis’ i.e. the detection of cancers that would never have exhibited symptoms or otherwise become clinically significant had they not been detected through screening. As it is not possible to distinguish between screen-detected cancers that would or would not have gone on to present clinically, all are treated, exposing some women to the physical and psychological risks associated with breast cancer diagnosis and treatment for no benefit.
The principal concern about relying solely on the evidence from the trials is that they fail to account for the significant advances in breast cancer treatment that have taken place in the intervening decades ( Gøtzsche and Jørgensen, 2013 ), as well as behavioural responses to free population screening ( Kim and Lee, 2017 ). Analysis of contemporary screening programmes provide an opportunity to examine the marginal effect of screening in an era of improved treatment of symptomatic disease, increased public awareness of breast cancer, and better identification and prevention services for women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer as a result of genetic or other factors. However, the evidence that has emerged from ‘real life’ screening programmes is characterised by a high level of methodological heterogeneity ( Raichand et al., 2017 ), and contradictory findings about the impact of screening continue to be a feature of the literature, even among analyses of the same screening programmes ( Jørgensen et al., 2010 ).
It is now considered unlikely that any new RCTs will be undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of mammography screening programmes ( Adami et al., 2020 ). Instead, attention has turned to identifying the most valid observational research designs and outcome measures from the morass of evidence that currently exists on service-level screening. Overall there is general agreement across both sides of the divide that incidence-based mortality (IBM) provides a robust measure to consider the effectiveness of screening programmes. IBM (also called refined mortality) studies overcome many of the limitations associated with standard death-certificate mortality by partitioning breast cancer deaths into those where the diagnosis was made before or after the introduction of screening. This facilitates a comparison of disease-specific mortality that avoids contamination from breast cancer deaths in the post-screening era of those diagnosed before the start of the programme, who could not have benefitted from it ( Irvin and Kaplan, 2014 ).
In their review of alternative study designs for estimating the effectiveness of screening in an era of widespread diffusion of the intervention, Adami et al. (2020) conclude that ideally IBM outcomes should be assessed using a difference-in-differences research design, which provides more valid results than either case-control or cohort studies , with the caveat that it is only possible to apply this design in rare circumstances where the introduction of screening created a contemporaneous ‘control’ group that was not offered screening. A recent example of this approach is Van Ourti et al. (2020) , who analysed the phased rollout of the Dutch screening mammography programme and found that one screening round reduced breast cancer mortality by 9.6%. Other similar studies include Kalager et al. (2010) and Harding et al. (2019) , who failed to find a statistically significant mortality reduction at a population level in Norway and the US respectively.
In this paper we analyse the phased implementation of the national mammography screening programme in Ireland to examine the impact of population-based screening on a wide range of breast cancer outcomes. Ireland is one of the few countries where, for operational reasons, the rollout of screening created a cohort of unscreened women that existed for long enough to act as a suitable comparison group. This allows us to adopt a difference-in-differences research design with incidence-based mortality as the primary outcome and, in doing so, we make a number of specific contributions to the literature.
First, in contrast to previous studies, we examine outcomes for women diagnosed with breast cancer (patient cohort perspective), as well as at an overall population level (population perspective). This allows us to assess how screening affects the clinical profile of the breast cancer patient cohort and also whether screening achieves its overall goal of decreasing breast cancer mortality in the population. Second, we provide a detailed analysis of the intermediate effects of screening that are necessary to achieve reductions in breast cancer mortality – this is important from the perspective of health service delivery, as well as for understanding what might be happening at a population level. In particular, we consider changes in mode of presentation and stage at diagnosis. As a result, this paper is the first to estimate the impact of service-level screening on the entire cascade of effects that screening is designed to trigger, in order to trace the impact of the programme back through each step of the hypothesised causal pathway. This approach can help reconcile the so-called ‘popularity paradox’, whereby the public and those involved in the provision of cancer services have generally positive perceptions of screening programmes that may have little or no effect on overall population mortality ( Raffle et al., 2019 ; Welch and Black, 2010 ).
Third, this paper provides evidence on socioeconomic disparities for a range of breast cancer outcomes and tests if population screening alleviates these health inequalities. This is of particular interest given Irish and international data showing that while breast cancer incidence is higher among more affluent women, case fatality rates are lower, as well as the long-documented phenomenon of lower uptake rates of screening in more deprived groups ( Connolly and Whyte, 2019 ; Lundqvist et al., 2016 ). Fourth, we also examine the issue of overdiagnosis and provide an upper bound estimate for it in the Irish context.

Section: 2. Context

BreastCheck, the Irish breast screening programme, currently invites all women aged 50–69 years to attend for a mammogram (low dose x-ray of the breast) every two years. Screening is provided free of charge and women are notified by letter at least seven days in advance of their appointment. If an appointment is missed, a reminder invitation is sent before the end of the screening round. The service is provided through a combination of four dedicated screening centres co-located with urban hospitals and 16 mobile units that are deployed to cover regional areas. Double reading of all mammograms is performed by two consultant radiologists who read a minimum of 5,000 screening cases per year, in line with the programme's quality assurance guidelines ( BreastCheck, 2015 ). Those in whom abnormalities are detected are offered an appointment for an assessment clinic within two weeks of being notified about the test results. This assessment may involve further mammograms, ultrasound imaging , fine needle aspiration , or core biopsy. Those diagnosed with breast cancer are seen by a consultant surgeon, who is part of a multidisciplinary team, to discuss treatment options.
Ireland has a population of just over 5 million people and is divided into 26 counties. Breast screening was first introduced as a pilot programme that operated in three counties (Cavan, parts of Dublin, and Monaghan) from 1989 to 1994 for women aged 50–64 years ( Codd et al., 1994 ), and BreastCheck was subsequently rolled out to women in this age group from 11 counties in the east of the country (which included the pilot areas) in February 2000. The programme was gradually extended to four other counties between March 2004 and April 2007, before commencing in the remaining 11 counties in December 2007. Uptake of screening has been consistently high, with an average acceptance rate of 73% of the known target population (range 68%–76% per annum) ( BreastCheck, 2018 ). In 2016 the Irish government made a commitment to increase the upper age limit of screening from 64 to 69 years, bringing it in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations ( WHO, 2014 ).
The circumstances surrounding the rollout of breast screening in Ireland created a natural experiment with assignment based on geographic location – see Fig. 1 . In our main analysis, the intervention (screening) group consists of women living in the 8 non-pilot counties where the screening programme started in February 2000, while the comparison (non-screening) group consists of women in the 11 counties where the programme did not commence until December 2007. The four counties in which screening was introduced between March 2004 and April 2007 are excluded from the main analysis.

Key features of this natural experiment are the creation of large groups comprising a majority of the national population of women aged 50–64 years, a single cut-off point separating intervention and comparison groups (rather than gradual introduction requiring multiple group-year comparisons), and the extended period over which intervention and comparison groups existed (8 years). A review of the literature from around the time of implementation shows that the selection of areas to be screened in phase 1 was not driven by geographic differences in breast cancer outcomes. For example, an analysis of breast cancer mortality prior to the introduction of screening, which was published by those involved in the screening programme to serve as a baseline against which to measure the impact of the programme, makes no reference to any geographic disparities that affected rollout ( Codd et al., 1999 ) – this is supported by a set of regression-based tests presented in Appendix A in the Supplementary Materials. Instead, these decisions were based primarily on a desire to capitalise on the expertise that had been developed through the pilot programme, which was delivered to an area that was representative of the total population ( Codd et al., 1994 ). Therefore, in our analysis we assume the phased introduction of screening in Ireland in 2000 was exogenous and that outcomes in the comparison group can be used to model the counterfactual of the intervention group in the absence of screening.

Section: 3. Data

Data on the incidence of invasive breast cancer (ICD-10 code C50) in Ireland from 1994 to 2011 was obtained from the National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI). Death certificate data was supplied by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and used to record the date and cause of death, where relevant. These data provide us with information, by year, on the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Ireland, though in our analysis we only include women aged between 35 and 79 years at diagnosis. This gives us an overall sample size of 33,722 individual breast cancer cases over the period. The NCRI has authority under the Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 to collect data on all persons diagnosed with cancer in Ireland. The use of these data for research is covered by Statutory Instrument No. 19/1991 - The National Cancer Registry Board (Establishment) Order, 1991. All datasets were completely anonymised by the NCRI prior to analysis.
It is worth noting that completeness of breast cancer ascertainment for the screening age group in the national cancer registry was estimated to be greater than 99% ( NCRI, 2012 ), while neither the NCRI nor the CSO play any role in the provision of screening, so knowledge of exposure to the intervention did not affect data collection. Furthermore, as the minimum unit of time in our data is a year, cancers diagnosed in the month before screening started in the intervention region (January 2000) are included in the intervention group, while cancers diagnosed in the month after screening began in the comparison region (December 2007) are included in the comparison group. Given the relatively short periods of time involved, the impact of this contamination is assumed to be minimal, and this was tested in sensitivity analysis where the years 2000 and 2007 were excluded.
To isolate the mortality reduction attributable to screening, we use IBM outcomes that partition cases according to whether or not the diagnosed woman was exposed to screening (using data on age, geographic location, and year of diagnosis), and examine ten-year follow-up of vital status (i.e. alive or dead) and cause of death. Based on previous studies, ten years of follow-up should be sufficient to detect changes in this outcome ( Gøtzsche and Jørgensen, 2013 ; Njor et al., 2012 ). Our analysis also has the advantage of having the same duration of follow-up for all cases, rather than a mixture of follow-up durations depending on whether women were screened earlier or later in the ‘accrual period’ i.e. the timespan over which breast cancer cases are eligible for inclusion in the pre- and post-intervention groups. Using this IBM approach, we then examine the impact of screening on breast cancer mortality by comparing those diagnosed in the target population (50–64 years) in the six years before the introduction of screening and the three years after (i.e. 1994-1999 vs 2000–2002).
In addition to the primary outcome of breast cancer mortality, we also examine intermediate or surrogate outcomes on the hypothesised pathway to any mortality effects. In particular, we examine the effect of the screening programme on both the mode of presentation and stage at diagnosis. Screening is designed to change the mode of presentation of breast cancer by detecting asymptomatic disease before it becomes symptomatic. Thus, we classify all cancers as having presented clinically (symptomatic or incidental detection) or asymptomatically (screen detected) to examine the impact of screening on breast cancer presentation within the target population before and after screening (1994–1999 vs 2000–2007).
Screening should also bring forward the time of diagnosis to a clinically significant degree so that cancers are detected at an earlier stage when they can be treated more successfully. Hence, an increase in the incidence of early stage cancers (defined as those diagnosed on or before TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors Stage 2) should take place as a direct result of screening and this should result in a subsequent decrease in the incidence of late stage disease (defined as those diagnosed at TNM Stage 3 or greater). Any increase in early stage cancers should be observable from the start of screening and we examine the same pre- and post-screening periods as for clinical presentation (1994–1999 vs 2000–2007). Changes in late stage disease take time to fully manifest and depend on how long it would have taken early stage screen-detected cancers to present clinically at a later stage in the absence of screening (called the lead time). Recent analysis suggests that the mean lead time in a screening-naïve population is less than four years, so the follow up period of seven years used in our study should be sufficient to substantially capture the impact of screening on late stage incidence ( Abrahamsson et al., 2020 ).
Each of the outcomes considered was analysed within the group of women diagnosed with breast cancer (patient cohort perspective) and at an overall population level (population perspective). To facilitate the population-based analysis, data from breast cancer cases from the NCRI was combined with data from the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) (1991, 1996, 2002, 2006, 2011 censuses, www.cso.ie ) on the total female population by age group and county, to microsimulate the number of women who were not diagnosed with breast cancer over the time period of the study (1994–2007). The purpose of carrying out the analysis from both a patient cohort and a population perspective is two-fold; firstly, it shows how screening affects the clinical profile of the breast cancer patient cohort and the demand for cancer services, and secondly, it allows us to observe screening-induced changes at each of the intermediate stages that are necessary to achieve the overall goal of decreasing breast cancer mortality.
Mortality outcomes among those diagnosed with breast cancer is more accurately termed ‘case fatality’. This is a measure of disease severity that conveys how likely one is to die (e.g. from breast cancer or from all causes) having been diagnosed with it i.e. it is a conditional probability. It is calculated as the number of deaths as a proportion of the total population of women affected. The population mortality rate , in contrast, is a measure that combines how likely one is to develop cancer with how likely one is to die after being diagnosed, and since cancer screening is designed to affect both the incidence of breast cancer, due to the lead time effect of screening, and disease severity, due to cancers being diagnosed when they are more treatable, population mortality is the most valid measure of the effectiveness of screening.
Sample descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1 . First, for each woman diagnosed with breast cancer, we have information on mode of presentation ( Asymptomatic or Clinical ), stage at diagnosis ( Early or Late ), as well as whether or not the woman died and, if relevant, year and cause of death. This is used to generate our first set of key outcome variables: Case Fatality – Breast Cancer is a binary variable taking a value of 1 if the woman died from breast cancer within ten years of diagnosis and a value of 0 if she did not; Case Fatality – All-Cause is similarly defined but based on any cause of death within ten years of diagnosis. We also consider a placebo outcome that is not expected to be impacted by screening and this is used in a falsification test to strengthen our argument of a causal interpretation of the results. This outcome is the side of the body in which the cancer is diagnosed, which should be unaffected by the intervention. Table 1 . Sample descriptive statistics.

The NCRI data also includes information on the woman's age at diagnosis in five-year age bands, their small area-level deprivation quintile which we use as a proxy for socioeconomic status, as well as their county of residence (which we use to assign the woman to the intervention or comparison group – summary statistics not presented). The age and socioeconomic status variables are included as controls in some of our models. We also undertake analyses in contemporaneous younger (35–49 years) and older (65–79 years) age groups in intervention and comparison regions as a further check that any effects are as a result of screening rather than some other change in service provision between these regions.
Finally, as discussed, we also consider outcomes at a population level. The specific variables examined are the overall breast cancer incidence rate, rate of asymptomatic presentation, rate of clinical presentation, rate of early stage incidence, and rate of late stage incidence, while the main outcome variables are the population breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality rates in those diagnosed with breast cancer. All of these variables are measured annually as the rate per 100,000 person years in the relevant population (age group) under consideration.

Section: 4. Empirical strategy

Our aim is to evaluate the impact of the screening programme over a population of individuals and we do so using repeated cross-sections difference-in-differences. We define two groups of women using the variable Screen , which takes a value of 1 for those living in the intervention (screening) region and a value of 0 for those who do not. We also define a variable Post to take a value of 1 for a time period after the introduction of the screening programme and a value of 0 before it has been implemented. Then, for a given outcome variable Y i t for individual i at time t (e.g. Clinical Presentation or Case Fatality ), we begin by estimating the following basic model: [1] Y i t = α + γ S c r e e n i + λ P o s t t + δ D D i t + ε i t where the interaction term D D i t (i.e. S c r e e n i ∗ P o s t t ) takes a value of one for a woman in the intervention region in the post-intervention period. α , γ , λ and δ are the parameters to be estimated and ε represents the error term. In this set-up, γ captures differences between the two groups prior to the introduction of the screening programme, while λ captures aggregate factors that would cause changes in Y over time, even in the absence of the programme. The main parameter of interest is δ , which represents the effect of the screening programme on Y . Given the binary nature of our dependent variables, we follow Angrist and Pischke (2009) and estimate linear probability models with standard errors clustered at the county level (i.e. areas where screening is ‘assigned’).
Equation [1] can be extended to incorporate covariates, heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs), and propensity score weights. For example, since we are also interested here in investigating the relationship between the various outcomes and socioeconomic status, as well as the extent to which the screening programme impacted on any socioeconomic disparities in outcomes, we can easily extend the model above in two ways. First we add covariates such that: [2] Y i t = α + γ S c r e e n i + λ P o s t t + δ D D i t + π 1 A g e i + π 2 S E S i + ε i t where Age denotes the age category of the woman and SES her socioeconomic status. This allows us to consider the relationship between the various outcomes considered and potentially important covariates identified from the literature. Second, to consider HTEs by socioeconomic status, we also add a set of interaction terms between DD and SES such that: [3] Y i t = α + γ S c r e e n i + λ P o s t t + δ D D i t + π 1 A g e i + π 2 S E S i + π 3 ( D D i t ∗ S E S i ) + ε i t
One of the risks associated with estimating repeated cross-sections difference-in-differences using the sample of breast cancer cases is the potential for ‘compositional changes’ pre- and post-intervention (this is not an issue for the population-level analysis). For example, if the screening programme leads to an increase in the proportion of lower socioeconomic status women being screened, and lower socioeconomic status is a risk factor for breast cancer mortality, then any changes in the proportions of women by socioeconomic status needs to be addressed. One way of doing this is by estimating propensity score matching difference-in-differences models. We adopt this approach and follow Stuart et al. (2014) by using a multiple weight propensity score weighting strategy that weights four groups of women defined by time and intervention status to be balanced on a set of characteristics. Appendix B in the Supplementary Materials presents further technical details.
Difference-in-differences facilitates causal inference from observational data provided a number of key identifying assumptions are met. In our case, these assumptions are that (i) any differences between the intervention and comparison groups are constant over time in the absence of screening (parallel trends assumption), (ii) rollout of screening to one group does not produce changes in the other group (i.e. no spillover effects), and (iii) the composition of the intervention and comparison groups remains stable when using repeated cross-sectional data. We address each of these identifying assumptions in detail in this paper. For example, evidence in support of the parallel trends assumption in presented in Section 5 , while the appendices present a range of placebo/falsification tests, as well as other tests and checks that were conducted to investigate the presence of spillover effects . Furthermore, our propensity score matching difference-in-differences estimations directly address the issue of potential compositional changes.

Section: 5. Analysis and main results

To begin our analysis of the impact of the screening programme, we first adopt a patient cohort perspective and focus on the impact on case fatality rates i.e. reductions in breast cancer mortality and all-cause mortality conditional on being diagnosed. Since mode of presentation and stage at diagnosis are likely to directly impact case fatality, we also consider these variables here. In particular, we focus on rates of clinical presentation and late stage incidence respectively for diagnosed women which are, by definition in the patient-level analysis, the reverse of rates of asymptomatic presentation and early stage incidence respectively.
A preliminary assessment of the parallel trends assumption is provided in Fig. 2 (with comparable analyses for the non-eligible 35–49 and 65–79 years age groups presented in Appendix C in the Supplementary Materials). First, Panel (a) shows pre-intervention parallel trends for clinical presentation followed by a considerable drop in the intervention region post-2000. Effects are also evident for late stage incidence, though there is more noise in this variable. Nonetheless, Panel (b) suggests that the rate of late stage incidence in the intervention region declines more than in the comparison region post-2000. In terms of case fatality, Panel (c) shows a marked decline in ten-year case fatality from breast cancer post screening in the intervention region for the 50–64 years age group. Prior to 2000, rates tended to move closely together. A similar pattern is evident for case fatality from all causes in Panel (d).

It is worth noting that similar changes are not evident in the non-eligible age groups for clinical presentation, late stage incidence, and case fatality (see Appendix C), lending further support to the parallel trends assumption. Moreover, in addition to these visual assessments, we also conducted regression-based checks of the similarity of pre-trends (see Appendix D in the Supplementary Materials), as well as a range of placebo/falsification tests (see Appendix E in the Supplementary Materials). Again, these tests are also supportive of the parallel trends assumption.
Table 2 presents estimates of δ using Equations [1], [2] and [3] for Clinical Presentation , Late Stage Incidence and Case Fatality (both from breast cancer and from all causes). For each variable, Model (1) is the simple difference-in-differences regression model, while Model (2) adds control variables for age and socioeconomic status, since these individual characteristics may affect the outcome variables. Finally, Model (3) tests for differential impacts of the screening programme by socioeconomic status. All models are estimated using the propensity score weights described in Appendix B. Table 2 .

Overall the Model (1) estimates suggest that the breast cancer screening programme reduced the probability of clinical presentation by −41.7 percentage points (ppts) (−42.6%), late stage incidence by −8.4 ppts (−38.9%), ten-year case fatality from breast cancer by −9.9 ppts (−29.9%), and ten-year case fatality from all causes by −10.6 ppts (−26.3%), for those diagnosed with breast cancer. The % changes are calculated by dividing the estimated ppt changes by the mean value of the respective outcomes in the intervention group before the introduction of screening (not reported here). The point estimates of the main parameter of interest δ ˆ change only very marginally once the controls are added in Model (2). However, these models do reveal some important differences in outcomes by socioeconomic status. For example, the probability of late stage incidence is higher for women from the lowest socioeconomic group ( SES5 ) compared to the highest ( SES1 ), with a marginal effect of 6.5 ppts. The same is true for the two case fatality outcomes considered, with marginal effects of 6.4 ppts and 9.4 ppts respectively for the lowest group compared to the highest. There appears to be no difference across socioeconomic groups for clinical presentation.
Thus, even though inclusion of these controls does not change our main conclusions from the basic difference-in-differences models, it provides important insights in relation to socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer outcomes. More specifically, women from the lowest socioeconomic group fare considerably worse on important outcomes when compared to women from the highest socioeconomic group. Indeed, the effects of socioeconomic status are particularly notable for case fatality, both from breast cancer and from all causes. The Model (2) results suggest that women in socioeconomic groups below the highest have lower probabilities of survival once diagnosed with breast cancer. While the estimated coefficients for SES are not monotonic and not always statistically significant, they are strongly suggestive of large socioeconomic disparities in mortality post-diagnosis.
Model (3) in Table 2 introduces a set of interaction terms between DD and SES to test for differences in the impact of the screening programme across socioeconomic status for the four outcomes. Notably, while there is some evidence to suggest that screening reduces socioeconomic disparities in late stage incidence and case fatality from breast cancer, there is no strong evidence that it does so for case fatality from all causes – see Appendix F in the Supplementary Materials for a graphical illustration of the estimated HTEs. Thus, overall, these estimates provide somewhat mixed evidence in relation to reductions in socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer outcomes arising from the screening programme.
Finally in relation to the results presented in this section, Appendix E provides further consideration of the main identification assumptions underpinning our empirical strategy i.e. that any differences between the intervention and comparison groups are constant over time and that there are no spillover effects . It also presents details of a range of robustness checks for our main results.
The estimates presented in Table 2 are conditional on being diagnosed with breast cancer. However, there is strong evidence that screening also increases the probability of being diagnosed with breast cancer and that some of these cases will be overdiagnosed ( Elmore and Fletcher, 2012 ). Therefore, to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the screening programme, it is important to also consider its impact within the overall population of those eligible for screening i.e. take a population perspective. Thus, we consider a range of outcomes at the population level.
To do so, we first microsimulate the population of women without a breast cancer diagnosis by year and county using census of population data. We then calculate the number of cases (by mode of presentation and stage at diagnosis) and deaths (both due to breast cancer and all other causes) per 100,000 person years in the intervention and comparison regions pre- and post-intervention. This allows us to calculate the change in mode of presentation, stage at diagnosis, and incidence-based breast cancer and all-cause mortality in both regions and, using difference-in-differences, to estimate the effect of the programme at a population level. It also allows us to estimate an upper-bound on the extent of overdiagnosis .
Fig. 3 presents an assessment of the parallel trends assumption for the population-level mode of presentation and stage at diagnosis variables that we consider (comparable analyses for the non-eligible 35–49 and 65–79 years age groups are once again presented in Appendix C, with regression-based checks of the similarity of pre-trends presented in Appendix D). All variables are measured in cases per 100,000 person years. Panels (a) and (b) show a large decrease in clinical presentation and a corresponding large increase in asymptomatic presentation respectively in the intervention region following the introduction of screening, with similar changes only evident in the comparison region after 2008. In contrast, while there is no obvious reduction in late stage incidence in Panel (c) in the intervention region post-2000, there is a large increase evident in Panel (d) for early stage incidence. Thus, overall, screening appears to have led to a significant change in both the incidence and composition of breast cancer in the overall population of screening-eligible 50–64 year old women. Once again it is noteworthy that similar trends/changes are not evident for the non-eligible age groups – see Appendix C.

In relation to population-level mortality, Fig. 4 provides annual incidence-based breast cancer and all-cause mortality rates per 100,000 person years from 1994 to 2002 for the intervention and comparison regions. Prior to the introduction of screening, population mortality rates were similar over time. Post-2000, there was no marked or obvious differential reduction in mortality rates in the intervention region. Therefore, there does not appear to be any clear evidence of a significant impact of screening on overall population mortality rates in Fig. 4 .

Table 3 presents estimates of δ using Equation [2] for Clinical , Asymptomatic , Late, Early, Breast Cancer Mortality , and All-Cause Mortality in the total target population. It shows that over the first seven years of the programme, screening led to a decrease in the rate of clinical presentation of −78.9 cases per 100,000 person years (−35.9%), an increase in asymptomatic presentation of 130.0 cases per 100,00 person years (+2738.4%), a decrease of −15.1 cases per 100,000 person years (−31.3%) in late stage incidence, and an increase in early stage presentation of 64.8 cases per 100,000 person years (+36.4%). Again this highlights the considerable changes in the incidence and composition of breast cancer cases in the population post-intervention and all estimates are highly statistically significant.

However, in contrast, the estimated overall impact of the screening programme on population breast cancer mortality among women aged 50–64 years is a non-statistically significant decrease of −7.2 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 person years (−9.0%), while the estimated decrease in all-cause mortality is −3.8 deaths per 100,000 person years (−3.9%), again not statistically significant. This suggests that while mammography screening had a significant impact on outcomes from a patient cohort perspective, these failed to translate into significant reductions in overall mortality at a population level in the early years of the programme.
Table 4 presents a simple difference-in-differences analysis of changes in overall breast cancer incidence rates in the intervention and comparison regions, showing a larger increase in the intervention region post-2000. This increase in invasive breast cancer incidence is an expected effect of screening, but one that should eventually be reversed in the absence of overdiagnosis, due to any excess incidence of early stage cancers in the short term being cancelled out by decreases in late stage incidence over time ( Bleyer and Welch, 2012 ).

Standard errors are in parentheses. *** denotes statistically significant at 1% level, ** at 5% level, and * at 10% level.
This initial increase in overall breast cancer incidence in the first eight years of screening therefore provides an upper bound on the estimate of overdiagnosis that effectively assumes that all excess incidence over this time, which is driven largely by increased incidence of early stage breast cancer, will not be offset by later reductions in the incidence of more advanced disease. Results of this analysis show that overdiagnosis as a result of screening could therefore not exceed 21.8%, or around one in six cancers diagnosed in the screening era.

Section: 6. Discussion

We show that mammographic screening was effective at detecting asymptomatic cancers, which led to a large decrease in the incidence of clinically-detected disease. As intended, this resulted in a significant increase in early stage detection and a decrease in late stage incidence in the patient cohort. The survival benefit of this stage-shift in diagnosed breast cancers was evident from the estimated 9.9 ppt (29.9%) decrease in breast cancer case fatality in the intervention versus comparison group. However, we found little evidence that these changes resulted in significant improvements in overall disease-specific or all-cause mortality in Ireland. This means that while invitation to screening increased detection, it did not significantly decrease the average risk of dying from breast cancer in the population. Results on the impact of screening on socioeconomic disparities were inconclusive, but were suggestive of a potential positive impact of screening in reducing inequalities in late stage incidence rates.
Breast screening is an integral part of public health provision in well-resourced settings, where biennial screening of women aged 50–69 is recommended by the WHO ( WHO, 2014 ). That conflicting evidence surrounding the effect of breast screening has been met with hostility and disbelief in some quarters is perhaps not surprising given the widespread diffusion of screening and the seemingly obvious advantages of diagnosing cancers early ( Berry, 2013 ). Our analysis contributes important insights into how the multitude of effects of screening may serve to enhance the positive perception of this intervention among the public and those involved in the provision of cancer services, even in the absence of any beneficial effect on overall population breast cancer mortality. As our findings show, screening produces changes that are conventionally associated with improved health system performance , including enhanced detection, improved patient cohort profile (lower proportion of late stage and clinically diagnosed cases), and lower case fatality among those in receipt of services. Crucially, however, we also show how these changes can fail to translate into improvements in disease-specific and all-cause mortality at a population level. The generalisability of these findings is underscored by the fact that Ireland's breast screening programme was developed in line with international best practice, is comparable to other countries in terms of programme type, screening interval and model of delivery, and has consistently achieved uptake rates that compare favourably with other European countries ( Peintinger, 2019 ; Perry et al., 2012 ).
Measurement of the principal harm of screening, overdiagnosis, is also a contentious issue in the literature, with studies having reported estimates ranging from 0% to over 50% ( Lynge et al., 2018 ). Much of this uncertainty stems from the inherent challenges of estimating how much, if any, of the rise in cancer incidence after the introduction of screening is attributable to overdiagnosis rather than earlier detection of clinically-relevant disease, which requires long term follow up of screened individuals after they exit the programme. We took a relatively simple approach of using the total increase in cancer incidence after screening is introduced (21.8%) as a proxy for the maximum possible rate of overdiagnosis from screening. This is an upper bound estimate because it does not adjust for further potential reductions in late stage incidence after screening has stopped, but is nonetheless comparable to the findings of the Independent UK Panel on Breast Cancer Screening analysis of RCT data that estimated an average overdiagnosis rate of about 19% as a proportion of cancers diagnosed during the screening period ( Marmot et al., 2013 ).
Finally, there are important caveats that should be considered when interpreting our results. First, we were only able to include data from the first three years of the screening programme in our assessment of IBM outcomes, in order to obtain ten-year follow up data on all cases. Since most of the screening group would have completed just one screening round in this time period, there is a possibility that we may fail to capture the cumulative benefit of repeated screening invitations. As noted, in their study, Van Ourti et al. (2020) reported that one screening round reduced breast cancer mortality by 9.6%. This suggests that an effect, if it exists, ought to be measurable using long term follow up of women over the period when they would have had one or two screening rounds. Second, we performed an ‘intention to treat’ analysis of the impact of an offer to avail of free mammography screening, so it does not isolate the effect of screening among those who actually participated in the programme. Therefore, while our approach is informative from a national policy perspective, it does not provide the evidence needed to guide individual-level decisions about whether or not to avail of screening. Third, our analysis of the impact of screening on socioeconomic disparities in late stage incidence and breast cancer mortality did not adjust for any differences in outcomes between those with and without private health insurance (PHI). Since screening is free to all, PHI is unlikely to have impacted significantly on detection, but may have led to differences in the type or timing of treatment that contributed to the mixed results obtained for mortality outcomes. Finally, while we failed to find an effect of screening on mortality, we did not examine other clinical outcomes that screening could potentially affect, such as quality of life changes as a result of less invasive treatment due to earlier detection.
Nonetheless, despite these caveats, we conclude that although the screening programme produced the intended intermediate effects on breast cancer presentation and incidence, these failed to translate into significant decreases in overall population-level mortality, though screening may have helped to reduce socioeconomic disparities in late stage breast cancer incidence.
