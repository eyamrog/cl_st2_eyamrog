Title: Covariance in diurnal patterns of suicide-related expressions on Twitter and recorded suicide deaths


Abstract: Abstract

Social media data is increasingly used to gain insights into trends in mental health , but prior studies aimed at confirming a link between online expression of suicidal ideation on social media and actual suicide deaths have been inconclusive. Using comprehensive six-year data sets of Twitter posts and suicide deaths in Japan , we examine the diurnal relationship between the proportional incidence of a suicide-related keyword, “kietai” (“I want to disappear”), and suicide deaths with an OLS regression model. We also use co-occurrence analysis to reveal changes in the linguistic context of the suicide-related keyword at different hours of the day. We find a clear diurnal pattern in the use of this suicide-related keyword, peaking between 1am and 5am. This diurnal trend is positively correlated with suicide deaths among younger cohorts (ages 15 to 44), but the correlation is negative among older adults (45 and over). The correlation among young adults strengthens when a delay between tweet incidence and suicide deaths is included. Compared to daytime tweets, nighttime tweets exhibited a stronger relationship between words related to self-disgust and words directly indicating suicidal intent . This study confirms the hypothesised link between online suicidal ideation and suicide death. Despite frequent flippant use of the keyword, the consistent correlation and the diurnal changes in the context of the keyword's usage demonstrate the value of social media data to the study of mental health trends in groups at risk of suicide.

Section: 1. Introduction

Suicide is a major public health issue which accounts for over 800,000 deaths globally each year and is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 29 ( WHO, 2017 ). With the rising use of social media platforms within this cohort, the communication of suicidal thoughts and ideas on social media has become an area of significant research interest.
Multiple studies have confirmed that people – especially youth – who are contemplating or ideating suicide turn to social media and the web for self-expression, information, and support ( Colombo et al., 2016 ; Daine et al., 2013 ). As well as seeking information or support, this online behaviour can include the direct expression of suicidal ideation – ideas related to suicide or the wish to die, for which social media provides a largely anonymous outlet. Suicidal ideation among young people is concerning because it is associated with more dangerous behaviour, including suicide attempts. Suicidal ideation is linked to both impulsive and planned teenage suicide attempts ( Brown et al., 1991 ). One third of adolescents who experience suicidal ideation go on to attempt suicide ( Nock et al., 2013 ), and suicide ideators are nearly 12 times as likely to attempt suicide by age 30 ( Reinherz et al., 2006 ). There is also evidence suggesting that social media plays a role in suicidal and self-harming behaviour by young people; in one study, 20% of adolescent respondents who reported engaging in self-harm stated that the Internet or social media played a role in their decision to do so ( O’Connor et al., 2014 ), while there are long-standing concerns over the potential for online sites and communities focused on self-harm to exacerbate the symptoms of individuals who turn to them ( Messina and Iwasaki, 2011 ) or even, in extreme cases, to encourage suicidal individuals to actually attempt suicide ( Phillips and Mann, 2019 ; Polder-Verkiel, 2012 ). These concerns highlight the role which social media and the online environment itself may have in changing how individuals deal with or act upon suicidal thoughts; while suicidal ideation itself far predates the Internet, its expression online has the potential to instantly introduce individuals to communities and groups of people also suffering from forms of depression or suicidal ideation – interactions which may harm more than help those already at risk of self-harm by normalising or encouraging (intentionally or otherwise) such behaviour. Indeed, studies have shown that certain types of activity on social media, such as Twitter, telegraph suicide risk in the general population and prefigure increases in suicide. Fahey et al. (2018) , for example, showed how different emotions expressed in Twitter reactions to the suicides of celebrity figures were related to subsequent suicide rates, suggesting that the “Werther Effect” is mediated in part through social media. Kmetty et al. (2017) explored a correlation between certain depression-related keywords on Twitter in the USA and suicide deaths, while Won et al. (2013) showed a correlation between the frequency of suicide-related keywords on a Korean blogging site and the national suicide rate. Each of these studies implies a connection between trends in posting behaviour on social media and actual cases of suicide.
These implied connections between social media activity and suicidal behaviour have led many researchers to explore the possibility of using social media monitoring to identify at-risk individuals or groups (see Lopez-Castroman et al., 2020 , for a recent review of literature in this field). Yet, identifying instances of genuine suicidal ideation on social media faces significant technical and theoretical challenges, as a result of which most attempts at online suicide reduction interventions are focused on the content which an individual accesses – responding to their Internet searches ( Arendt et al., 2020 ) or setting guidelines for how online media presents reports of suicide ( Stack, 2020 ) – rather than on the content which an individual creates in the form of their own posts and comments. One major challenge, for example, is that it has proven difficult to distinguish between sincere and frivolous uses of suicide-related phrases in social media posts, even when researchers adopt machine learning approaches to address this problem ( Burnap et al., 2017 ; O'Dea et al., 2015 ). Moreover, problems with accessing social media data result in many researchers being forced to use incomplete or unrepresentative data sets, which mitigate the robustness of their conclusions. Consequently, even though it may seem reasonable that suicidal ideation on social media should be linked to attempted or completed suicide, evidence for such a relationship has remained inconclusive. While Jashinsky et al. (2013) found that the appearance of words and phrases associated with suicide risk on Twitter predicted suicide rates at the state level in the USA, studies of temporal rather than geographic patterns have not consistently found such a link between online suicidal ideation and suicide deaths. Kmetty et al. (2017) used a keyword search approach to identifying suicidal ideation on Twitter and found that it was correlated with suicide deaths at the daily level but not over longer time spans, whereas Burnap et al. (2017) developed a supervised machine learning approach to identify tweets expressing suicidal ideation but found little support for a correlation between actual suicide deaths and the volume of suicidal ideation tweets in the preceding 24 h. In both of these cases, the inconsistent findings of temporal patterns of online suicidal ideation and suicide death are likely to have been caused by the non-representative nature of data provided through the free Twitter API as well as the difficulty of gathering long-term data from the platform ( Stieglitz et al., 2018 ; Tromble et al., 2017 ; Driscoll and Walker, 2014 ). Both studies also used suicide statistics that recorded only the day, not the time, of death, meaning that they could not evaluate diurnal patterns.
The present study aims to improve our understanding of the temporal link between suicidal ideation on Twitter and actual suicide deaths by using complete (not randomly sampled) Japanese Twitter data and detailed suicide data covering a long (six year) time period in Japan . Following existing work on suicidal ideation, we expect that increases in the number of Japanese tweets indicative of suicidal ideation precede suicide deaths among young people in Japan. We focus on Twitter because, with more than 28% of the country's population using Twitter ( Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, 2016 ), Twitter has “mass appeal” in Japan ( Wang, 2019 ) and is more widely used than Facebook ( Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, 2018 ). The hypothesised relationship is limited to young people because while 68% of all Twitter users in Japan are aged between 15 and 34, only 8% are aged between 55 and 64, and the proportion of users declines as the age group increases ( Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, 2018 ; Statista Research Department, 2018 ).
Unlike previous studies, our use of complete and fine-grained data allows us to examine the relationship between Twitter content and suicide deaths at the hourly level, thus confirming the validity of studying causes and indicators of suicide using social media data. The use of a long time period and aggregation at the hourly level improves on previous studies by allowing us to disentangle our observations from long-term trends, including the long-term downward trend in suicide deaths in Japan and the upward trend in Twitter usage, as well as to smooth out noise and one-off events in the data. We also introduce a methodological innovation by focusing on the incidence of a target suicide-related keyword as a proportion of overall Twitter traffic – namely, the proportional likelihood that a given tweet will feature this keyword during a given hour of the week – rather than the unadjusted frequency of that keyword. This method allows us to ignore the patterns created by the diurnal cycles of Twitter usage, since a great deal of the variance in frequency of any given keyword will be attributable to the large differences in Twitter traffic volume between day and night, or between weekdays and weekends. We focus instead on the conditional probability of a suicide-related tweet being posted in a given hour. Finally, we conducted exploratory analysis of the tweets used in this paper to determine if certain co-occurring phrases can be used to discern tweets that use the keyword seriously from more frivolous tweets.
Our primary hypothesis was that proportional rises in the hourly incidence of the kietai keyword (i.e. increases in the percentage of tweets sent which feature this keyword) would be correlated with rises in the hourly suicide rate in Japan, as observed over a 7-day (168 h) cycle.
We further hypothesised that this link between Twitter data and suicide deaths would be found among younger age cohorts who are both more likely to use Twitter ( Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Japan, 2018 ; Statista Research Department, 2018 ) and more likely to endorse or express suicidal ideation prior to a suicide attempt or completed suicide ( Gallo et al., 1994 ; Duberstein et al., 1999 ).
Finally, we hypothesised that this link would be stronger with the addition of a time lag to the Twitter statistics, reasoning that various preparation-related factors (e.g. the need to travel to a specific location, acquire materials or prepare equipment) would introduce a delay between the online expression of suicidal ideation and the time of death recorded for a related completed suicide.

Section: 2. Method

Twitter data used in this study were downloaded from Crimson Hexagon, a company that provides access to a complete historical archive of Twitter data. Doing so allowed us to bypass issues related to the incompleteness or non-representativeness of Twitter's standard APIs. We initially considered three possible keywords for our data collection – jisatsu-shitai (“I want to kill myself”), shinitai (“I want to die”), and kietai (“I want to disappear”). The former two were studied by Sueki (2015) , who found that jisatsu-shitai was more strongly indicative of suicidal ideation while shinitai was more often used in flippant comments, while the final word, kietai , was noted by Nagata and Hasegawa (2013) to be indicative of suicidal ideation in interviews with patients hospitalised after suicide attempts.
We used Crimson Hexagon to download all tweets sent containing these keywords over the six-year (2011–2016 inclusive) target period. We did not limit our tweet collection based on geographical origin; identifying the geographic origin of tweets is often unreliable, but each of these keywords uses characters unique to the Japanese language. Given the relatively small number of Japanese speakers residing outside Japan , this allowed high confidence that tweets sent using these terms originated in Japan. The collection yielded 344,201 tweets containing jisatsu-shitai and 3,287,812 tweets containing kietai . For shinitai , however, we suspended data collection after exceeding 10 million tweets covering only a fraction of our target time period. Not only was the volume of this keyword so great that full data collection would have been impossible, this extremely high frequency supported the finding of Sueki (2015) that shinitai was being used casually or non-seriously, justifying its removal as a candidate keyword. On the other hand, the low volume of tweets containing jisatsu-shitai , while supporting the idea that this is a term used more seriously, would have made it difficult to draw robust statistical inferences. We therefore chose to use kietai as the target keyword for our study. This word was used commonly enough for robust statistical analysis, and its appearance in Nagata and Hasegawa (2013) 's interviews combined with its relatively low frequency (compared with shinitai ) suggested that it is likely to be a useful indicator of suicidal intent or ideation.
From a starting point of 3,287,812 tweets containing kietai , we filtered the data to exclude irrelevant accounts – such as bots, marketing spam, and messages automatically generated from websites using song lyrics or quotations. Specifically, we removed the tweets of accounts which repeatedly posted the same messages as well as any identical tweets posted more than 100 times by different accounts. This filtering process left us with 2,889,190 tweets.
Suicide death records for that same six-year period (2011–2016) were obtained from the Vital Statistics Reports of Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The Ministry anonymised these death records prior to making them available for research purposes. These reports use data compiled from death certificates issued by physicians. Deaths coded as X60 to X84 (using the International Classification of Disease – 10th Revision [ICD10] codes) were classified as death by suicide. Since our analysis required data on the time of death, any death records that did not include this information were excluded.

Users (Unique) is the number of individual user accounts who sent the tweets in the Filtered column during that year.
To observe the diurnal pattern, we aggregated both the Twitter data and the suicide data at the daily and hourly levels, counting up the number of tweets and suicides which occurred during that time over the six-year period to give us 168 observations of both tweet volumes and suicides (seven days x 24 h). The descriptive statistics of these aggregated observations are also shown in Table 1 . Aggregating each observation across the full six-year span enabled us to effectively control for underlying trends, seasonal fluctuations, and one-off events, so that we could focus solely on weekly and diurnal patterns. We also normalized the hourly counts of kietai tweets in order to take into account the large diurnal swings in overall Twitter activity, which occur simply as a result of everyday activity patterns (waking and sleeping times , work and school, etc.). To do this, we obtained similarly aggregated hourly counts of tweets from a representative sample of tweets archived by the Waseda University Institute of Social Media Data ( Hino and Fahey, 2019 ), and used these data for normalization. A comparison of the two aggregate datasets confirmed that over 90% of the hourly movement in the volume of tweets containing kietai was attributable to broader patterns of Twitter usage ( R 2 = 0.913). We therefore controlled for these underlying patterns by calculating the proportional incidence of the keyword, using midday on Monday as a baseline (this was chosen arbitrarily as the choice of baseline does not impact the analysis results). The resulting value reflects the conditional probability that a tweet sent during a given hour of the week would include the word kietai .
The normalized Twitter data and suicide data were then analysed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. To test our second hypothesis, that the link would be found among younger age cohorts, we divided the suicide data into age-cohort groups. To test the third hypothesis, that a time delay would be introduced between the two variables by the need for preparation for suicide, a number of time delays, from +1 h to +6 h, were applied to the Twitter data and tested. In addition, negative delays (from −1 to −6) were tested to check for spurious correlation.
Finally, we examined the kietai data to find times when the proportional incidence of the word peaked (which we defined as rising over 50% above its daily baseline) and carried out an exploratory text analysis comparing the content of the tweets sent during those hours with the tweets sent during the rest of the day. For this analysis, we constructed co-occurrence networks showing word relationships, measuring co-occurrence between words according to their Jaccard similarity. To permit visual analysis, co-occurrences below 3% (i.e. the words appeared together in fewer than 3% of their combined appearances in the corpus) were trimmed from the graphs, which were then visualised using a Fruchterman-Reingold simulation in Cytoscape ( Shannon et al., 2003 ). This approach is designed to reveal differences in how the vocabulary of the tweets is structured across the two time periods. This section of the analysis was purely descriptive but illustrates the type of tweets that feature the word kietai .

Section: 3. Results

The proportional incidence of the kietai keyword on Twitter, aggregated by hour and day of the week, is shown in Fig. 1 . We observed a clear diurnal pattern in the proportional incidence of kietai , which peaked after midnight each night and returned to its baseline level of incidence by around 5am each morning. During the peak times, the likelihood of a tweet containing the word kietai increased by between 50 and 100% from its baseline level during the day. We also observed a clear weekly pattern, with the scale of the late-night peaks being highest on Sunday and Monday nights and declining over the course of the week, reaching a nadir on Friday night. The likelihood of using the keyword during daytime was notably lower on Saturdays and Sundays. Download: Download high-res image (335KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 .

We proceeded to test the correlation between the diurnal patterns in the proportional incidence of kietai and the frequency of suicides among different age cohorts. We divided the suicide data into age groups and used OLS regression to test the relationship between the diurnal pattern of suicide in each group and the proportional incidence of kietai . The results are shown in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 2 . This analysis confirmed our hypothesis that the correlation would be found among younger cohorts, who are more likely to use Twitter and to share feelings of suicidal ideation. No correlation was found in the group aged 45 to 54, while groups aged 55 and older showed a negative correlation, which was particularly strong in the 65+ age group. Based on these results, we focused the remainder of our analysis on the 15–44 age group in which a positive relationship between Twitter data and suicide deaths had been shown to exist. Table 2 .

Notes : The bars indicate the coefficient and 95% confidence intervals for OLS regressions of the hourly suicide deaths, divided by age group, to the hourly proportional incidence of the word ‘kietai’ on Twitter. Both data were aggregated to 168 hourly (24 × 7) observations by summing their frequencies over the six years of data used in the study.
We next tested a set of positive and negative time delays to the Twitter variable, ranging from −6 h up to +6 h inclusive, using a series of OLS regression analyses on the younger cohort (15–44). The results of these analyses are shown in Table 3 . We found that the size of the effect increased progressively as we added one- and 2-h time lags to the Twitter data, peaking at T+2 before falling off steadily from T+3 onwards. These results indicate that as the proportional incidence of kietai doubled (rising from 1.0 to 2.0), the suicide count during that hour over the six year period rose by 44.624 [95% CI : 20.553, 68.696] at T = 0, by 67.456 [95% CI : 44.667, 90.246] at T+1 and by 83.132 [95% CI : 61.594, 104.671] at T+2, when the effect was largest. Fig. 3 shows the diurnal patterns of both the proportional incidence of kietai on Twitter and suicide deaths among the 15–44 cohort, applying the T+2 time lag which we found to strengthen the relationship.

Using the “peak” times we had found in Fig. 1 (which we defined as hours of the day in which the proportional incidence of kietai rose by 50% or more beyond its daily baseline throughout the week), we created a scatterplot of the hourly data ( Fig. 4 ). This revealed that the ‘peaks’ (from 1am to 5am each day) and the remaining ‘off-peak’ times formed two clusters, with the correlation between kietai incidence and suicide deaths within each cluster being stronger than the correlation found in the whole dataset. Specifically, the coefficient rose from 83.132 [95% CI : 61.59, 104.67] in the whole dataset to 136.062 [95% CI : 92.93, 179.19] during off-peak hours and 127.919 [95% CI : 64.85, 190.99] during late-night peak hours ( Table 4 ). These findings suggest that two distinct groups of users – late-night users and daytime users – may be represented in the data. To check for the possibility that we were instead observing a threshold phenomenon, whereby the correlation with suicide deaths would disappear below a certain level, we also tested different definitions of “peak” (specifically, hours which were 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% over the daily baseline) in the same manner, but found no level at which the correlation disappeared in the off-peak hours, showing that the effect is not limited to high-frequency usage periods but persists at hours when the keyword is used infrequently. In our subsequent exploration of the text content of the tweets, we focused on the differences between the peak and off-peak hours as originally defined – with “peaks” being hours in which the frequency is consistently 50% over the daily baseline.

To provide some descriptive insight into the messages and topics included in the Twitter data used in this study, an exploratory text analysis was conducted with a focus on identifying differences between the tweets posted during the proportional incidence ‘peaks’ (between 1am and 5am, as shown in Fig. 1 ) and the tweets posted at other times. To this end, we created co-occurrence networks showing the relationships between vocabulary terms in tweets sent during “peak” hours and those sent during the rest of the day. These networks give an impression of the common phrases and topics found in the tweets.
The co-occurrence network for off-peak hours (6am through to midnight, when the proportional incidence of kietai is low) is shown in Fig. 5 . The sections of the network which appear to show frivolous usage of the keyword have been labelled in blue (tagged with numerals 1, 2, 3 and 4), while those that appear to constitute more serious usage – potentially indicative of actual suicidal ideation – are labelled in red (tagged with letters A, B and C). The likely frivolous usages included discussions of school, part time jobs, or studying for exams; accidently sending emails to the wrong recipient; missing a train or bus; or having stomach pains from eating too much. The likely serious usages often directly mentioned suicide or self-loathing; talked about loneliness, sadness, and pain; or used terminology broadly expressing depression and difficulty in coping. The latter set forms a strongly interrelated cluster of words on the left-hand side of the section marked “A” in the figure.

The co-occurrence network for tweets appearing in the “peak” hours (from 1am to 5am) can be seen in Fig. 6 . Many of the same clusters appeared in this network, but there were nonetheless several differences, suggesting that individuals tweeting during this time period used language differently or engaged with different topics. For comparison purposes, the labels in Fig. 6 are the same as those for Fig. 5 . Certain themes that were separated in the off-peak tweets were strongly related in the peak tweets, with the most notable being group C (“self-disgust”) which became strongly associated with the tweets in group B (relating to strength, weakness, desire, and suicide). In the off-peak hours, these words co-occurred with “self-disgust” in less than 3% of their instances, while during peak hours, their co-occurrence frequency rose to between 7% (“weak” and “self-disgust”) and 9% (“desire” and “self-disgust”). Along with the serious vocabulary found in group A across both time periods, the terms in group BC are strong candidates for further study regarding differences between serious suicidal ideation and frivolous tweets.

Section: 4. Discussion

Our results revealed a robust positive temporal correlation between the proportional frequency of the keyword kietai on Twitter and suicide deaths among people under 45 years old, along with a negative correlation for suicide deaths among older cohorts (see Fig. 2 ). Although many studies have attempted to detect suicidality from posts on social media ( Burnap et al., 2017 ; O'Dea et al., 2015 ; Jashinsky et al., 2013 ) and to discover the association between these posts and actual suicide deaths ( Won et al., 2013 ; Burnap et al., 2017 ; Kmetty et al., 2017 ), no study has demonstrated a clear link between online expression of suicidal ideation on social media and actual suicide deaths. The present study showed that Twitter posts that are suggestive of suicidal ideation tend to precede suicide deaths, and thus there is a strong correlation between the occurrence of such tweets and the act of suicide. The correlation was more pronounced when time lags were added to the Twitter data, peaking at 2 h after the Twitter data (see Table 3 ), which is consistent with the expectation that factors such as preparation or travel time would make the recorded time of death later than the expression of suicidal ideation.
While our study makes clear that Twitter activity related to suicidal ideation precedes suicide deaths, we acknowledge that it is not possible to make a causal claim based on this finding. A number of causal mechanisms are possible and indeed several different mechanisms may be acting in concert. It is likely that unobserved factors further up the chain of causality contribute both to the posting of suicidal ideation on Twitter and the rise in suicide deaths, thus explaining at least part of the correlation between those variables, but we also acknowledge the possibility that Twitter activity itself may be a contributing factor to suicide deaths. Ueda et al. (2017) and Fahey et al. (2018) suggest that certain types of tweets sent after the suicide deaths of celebrity figures can trigger higher suicide rates in the general population, which would mean that social media plays a mediating role in the Werther Effect; it is possible that exposure to more general expressions of suicidal ideation on social media also contributes to a rise in suicides. Nevertheless, our analysis did not support the idea of the effect being a threshold phenomenon or having a “tipping point” at which excessive exposure to such tweets triggered higher suicide rates.
We found a strong negative correlation between the kietai usage and suicide deaths among people over 65, who are less likely to use Twitter. However, this negative correlation in the older age groups reflects the large difference in the timing of suicide among retired people compared to working-age people ( Boo et al., 2019 ). Since the diurnal patterns of suicide deaths among working-age and retired cohorts are completely different – suicide deaths among working-age people are few when those among retirees are many, and vice versa – any variable which is correlated with the suicides of working-age people will consequently show the opposite correlation with the suicides of retirees, without necessarily implying any causal relationship. (Equally, an effect on the suicides of retirees would be inversely but spuriously correlated with the suicides of working-age people – but we see no logical rationale for this causality and thus advance the more likely explanation.)
The proportional incidence of kietai on Twitter peaked sharply during the late-night periods (from 1am to 5am), with the likelihood of the word appearing in a given tweet rising 50%–100% above its baseline during these times (see Fig. 1 ). This finding supports that of Dzogang et al. (2018) , who analysed psychometric indicators in a large sample of U.K. Twitter data and found that tweets exhibiting negative affect peaked between 3am and 4am – the centre of the peak we found for kietai. Our analysis suggested that these peak periods formed a data cluster within which the correlation between the proportional incidence of kietai and suicide deaths was more pronounced than in the overall data. Indeed, the correlation found in this analysis is primarily the result of alignment between keyword incidence and suicide deaths during the late-night period; two further (significantly smaller) peaks in suicide during the daytime hours are not similarly reflected in the keyword incidence (see Fig. 3 ). We speculate that this may imply a difference in behaviour or mechanism related to suicides during the daytime peaks compared to those at night. Exploratory text analysis of the tweets suggested that while vocabulary usage in these two time periods (late night hours and other times) was similar in many regards, certain key phrases – notably ‘self-disgust’ – were more central in the vocabulary network during the late-night peak hours (see Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 ). Large volumes of flippant tweets existed in both time periods, but despite the presence of jokes and frivolous usage of suicide-related terms, the correlation with suicide deaths remained clear.
There are several limitations to this study which provide important context to the results we found. First, this study focused only on one keyword indicative of suicide ideation–kietai. Even though the occurrence of this keyword has been shown to be strongly linked to the incidence of suicidal deaths, future research could focus on developing more holistic models which evaluate, for example, the overall sentiment found in Twitter traffic at specific times, rather than focusing on a single keyword. Second, while this study aimed to show that the expression of suicidal ideation on Twitter is linked to suicide deaths, we do not claim to have observed tweets sent by individuals who subsequently completed suicide. Even if such tweets were contained within our data, they cannot be reliably isolated from the tweets of other users and would comprise only a very small number of the data. Rather, we speculate that the diurnal trends in social media and the diurnal trends in suicide deaths both originate from a common set of (unobserved) causal factors. Similar reasoning can be found in, for example, Eichstaedt et al. (2015) , who found that psychometric factors on Twitter were effective predictors of geographic distributions of heart disease; the implication was not that the users observed on Twitter suffered from heart disease, but that there was a set of regional factors that were upstream in the causal mechanism of both heart disease mortality and the expression of certain psychologies on Twitter. As mentioned above, we also acknowledge the possibility that social media activity itself plays some role in the subsequent rises in suicide deaths.
Finally, our study did not overcome one of the major challenges mentioned in the theory section, namely the high volume of flippant expressions which use suicide-related terms and the difficulty of separating these flippant usages from serious expressions of suicidal ideation. Our findings show that the temporal patterns in serious usage are clear enough to show correlation with suicide deaths despite this widespread flippant usage, but a methodology which effectively separated these different usages would likely find even more robust results.

Section: 5. Conclusions

This paper shows a compelling link between suicidal ideation on social media and suicide deaths. Despite the limitations noted above, our findings affirm the validity of, and need for, research into the use of social media and people at risk of suicide or self-harm. We note that the use of social media data also allows us to study the behaviour and trends of sub-populations that have been difficult to assess through other approaches. For example, while men are more likely to die by suicide, they are less likely to express their need for help or to seek help for mental health issues. Twitter, on the other hand, seems to be an exception for Japanese men in this regard; Sueki (2015) found that, compared to women, Japanese men are more likely to express suicidal ideation in their tweets.
The value of the present study, therefore, lies both in its advance towards possible early identification of groups or individuals at risk of suicide on social networks, and in providing new insights into the upstream causes of suicide and online negative ideation. Establishing that online expressions of suicidal ideation have a link to actual suicide deaths in young adults means that social media data can be explored to uncover broad trends in the mental health of communities, and that researchers and practitioners should aim where possible to consider both the content and the timing of individuals' online activities in assessments of their suicide risk.
