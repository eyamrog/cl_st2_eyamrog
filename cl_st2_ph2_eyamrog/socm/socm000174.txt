Title: Quality of life of older adults in two contrasting neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana


Abstract: Abstract

As is the case elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana is experiencing a rapid increase in the population of older adults. Despite their rising numbers, the living conditions and wellbeing of older Ghanaians remain woefully understudied. This paper presents the results of a study exploring the quality of life (QoL) of older adults in two contrasting neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana. The objectives of the study were to: (1) explore and compare the QoL of older slum and non-slum dwellers in Ghana; and (2) determine the extent of QoL disparities between slum and non-slum older adults. To accomplish these objectives, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of older adults (N = 603) residing in a slum and non-slum neighbourhood. QoL was self-assessed in four domains – physical, psychological, social, and environment – using the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL assessment tool (WHOQoL-BREF). Multivariable linear regression analyses of the data revealed no statistically significant difference between the slum and non-slum respondents in physical (coeff: 0.5; 95% CI: -1.7, 2.8; p = 0.642) and psychological (coeff: -0.2; 95% CI: -3.0, 2.6; p = 0.893) QoL. However, the slum respondents reported significantly higher social QoL than the non-slum respondents (coeff: -3.2; 95% CI: -5.6, -0.8; p = 0.010), while the reverse was true in environmental QoL (coeff: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.3, 6.2; p < 0.001). The existence of strong social support systems in the slum and better housing and neighbourhood environmental conditions in the non-slum may have accounted for the observed variation in social and environmental QoL. Thus, contrary to popular discourses that vilify slums as health-damaging milieus, these findings offer a more nuanced picture, and suggest that some features of slums may constitute important health resources for older adults.

Section: 1. Introduction

Aging generally correlates with declines in health and quality of life (QoL). These declines are attributed to the onset of physiological changes that weaken the body's immunity and render it susceptible to infections, chronic illnesses , disability, pain, depression, and ultimately a diminished satisfaction with life ( Fry, 2000 ; Woo et al., 2002 ). For example, chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , are more prevalent in older populations than in younger age groups ( Marengoni et al., 2008 ). Thus, longevity may not necessarily be advantageous to those living longer, more so when old age becomes associated with poor QoL ( Fry, 2000 ). The focus of health promotion among older adults has therefore expanded from an emphasis on mortality and morbidity to incorporate interventions that enhance QoL and healthy aging ( Beard et al., 2016 ; World Health Organization, 2015a ). The World Health Organization (2015a) particularly prioritizes home and community environments as important settings for interventions to achieve healthy aging for older adults.
The recognition of socio-physical environments as key elements of a healthy aging agenda undergirds a growing research interest in the health effects of residential neighbourhoods. This literature identifies poor housing conditions , housing insecurities, and degraded neighbourhood environments as major risk factors for accidental injuries ( Camilloni et al., 2011 ), physical disability ( Balfour and Kaplan, 2002 ), healthcare deprivation ( Lang et al., 2008 ), and mental health problems ( Howden-Chapman et al., 2011 ) among older adults. In contrast, good quality homes and walkable neighbourhoods are linked to housing satisfaction, place attachment, positive affect, and favourable psychological and mental health outcomes among older adults ( Berke et al., 2007 ; Evans et al., 2002 ).
Although knowledge of the living conditions of older adults in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is limited, there is evidence of aging populations in urban slums across the region ( Ezeh et al., 2006 ). As depressed urban settlements lacking durable housing and sufficient living space ( UN-Habitat, 2006 ), slums can be a formidable threat to the wellbeing of older adults. Yet, research on the health and QoL of older slum dwellers in SSA is limited, in both geographical scope and content. To date, much of the research in this area has overemphasized Kenya's slums, to the neglect of other countries with significant older slum populations (e.g. Kyobutungi et al., 2010 ; Mudege and Ezeh, 2009 ; Ezeh et al., 2006 , etc.). Furthermore, the limited research examining the wellbeing of older slum dwellers has, to date, lacked control samples, precluding any conclusion of possible health disparities between slum and non-slum older adults. The objectives of this study were therefore to: (1) explore and compare the QoL of older slum and non-slum dwellers in Ghana; and (2) determine the extent of QoL disparities between these populations.

Section: 2. Aging in Ghana

The proportion of older adults in Ghana's population has increased from 4.6% in 1960 to 5.9% in 1984, and 6.7% in 2010 ( World Health Organization, 2014 ; Kpessa-Whyte, 2018 ). The country's older adult population is expected to reach 6 million or 12% of the national population by 2050, up from approximately 1.6 million or 6.7% in 2010 ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2013 ; Biritwum et al., 2013 ).
In Ghana, population aging is unfolding within a context of rapid urbanization, growing urban poverty, and environmental decay ( Cobbinah et al., 2017 ). Data from the 2010 Population and Housing Census show that an estimated 46% of older Ghanaians resided in towns and cities. Given this demographic terrain, some of the most pressing social and health challenges confronting older Ghanaians will be felt in cities and towns that already grapple with multiple and often complex development problems, including environmental squalor and shortages of critical infrastructure and services ( Mba, 2004 ; Ayee and Crook, 2003 ). For example, in 2010, the Nima slum (Accra) was home to some 11,000 people aged 50 years and over ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2014 ). For older adults, the challenge of living in poor environmental conditions in slums is amplified by problems of the aging process, including the onset of chronic illnesses and disability ( Aikins and Apt, 2016 ). The interaction of these factors can have negative implications for the health and QoL of older slum dwellers .
Although Ghana has a long history of aging research ( Aikins and Apt, 2016 ), the health and QoL of older slum dwellers have remained woefully understudied. So far, most of the research conducted with older Ghanaians has been in rural settings (e.g. Debpuur et al., 2010 ; Mba, 2004 ). Other studies have had a national focus (e.g. Minicuci et al., 2014 ; Biritwum et al., 2013 ), but have not specifically explored the wellbeing of older adults residing in specific urban milieus, such as slums and inner-city neighbourhoods. This knowledge gap is significant, given the growing population of older adults in Ghana's urban centres. This paper thus represents the first systematic attempt at exploring the QoL of older slum dwellers in urban Ghana. QoL, defined succinctly as individuals' subjective evaluation of their wellbeing ( Theofilou, 2013 ), is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality among older adults globally ( Bilotta et al., 2011 ; Tsai et al., 2007 ). Thus, knowledge of the QoL of older slum and non-slum dwellers can help inform interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality among this demographic.

Section: 3. Methods

The study was carried out in the Nima slum and Adabraka-Asylum Down non-slum neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana. Accra is itself a city of contradictions, characterized by the splendour of a thriving modern city on one hand and the squalor of a 19th Century American tenement on the other. As a modern city, Accra boasts world class shopping malls, gated communities of architectural elegance, and a multitude of banking institutions ( Owusu et al., 2008 ). This image contrasts sharply with pockets of depressed and densely populated settlements. The Nima slum and Adabraka-Asylum Down non-slum neighbourhoods somewhat reflect this dual image of Accra.
Located about 8 km from the center of Accra, the Nima slum began in the early 1930s on what had been a pastureland for cattle ( Essamuah and Tonah, 2004 ), and thereafter grew rapidly into a permanent settlement by the 1940s, when demand for residential land expanded during World War II ( Owusu et al., 2008 ). Nima's population has since expanded, reaching 29,797 in 1960 ( Agyei-Mensah and Owusu, 2012 ), 69,044 in 2000 ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2002 ), and 80,843 in 2010 ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2014 ). Covering an area of only 1.6 km 2 ( Agyei-Mensah and Owusu, 2012 ), Nima is one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the city. In 2010, 5,756 older adults (aged 60+ years) resided in Nima ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2013 ). This settlement is mostly unplanned, and the majority of its houses do not meet modern building and spatial planning standards. The physical appearance of housing in Nima gives the impression of a distressed settlement blighted by poverty, congestion, environmental decay, and governmental neglect ( Owusu et al., 2008 ).
In contrast, Adabraka-Asylum Down is a planned, largely middle-income neighbourhood, with an interconnected network of streets and functional drainage systems ( Yankson, 2012 ). The neighbourhood is located 2 km from central Accra – the nucleus of the city's commercial activities ( Grant, 2009 ). Population growth in Adabraka-Asylum Down has been modest, having increased from 25,425 in 1984 to 28,108 in 2000, and approximately 40,000 in 2010 ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2013 ; Yankson, 2012 ). In 2010, some 2,867 of Adabraka's residents were 60 years old and over ( Ghana Statistical Service, 2013 ). Adabraka-Asylum Down is relatively well served with regard to municipal services; 70% of households have solid waste disposal systems, as opposed to only 9% in Nima ( Agyei-Mensah and Owusu, 2010 ). Approximately 69% of households in Adabraka-Asylum Down have piped water on premises, compared to 31% in Nima. However, despite these environmental advantages, Adabraka-Asylum Down suffers from perennial flooding along the banks of the Odawna River ( Tengan and Aigbavboa, 2016 ). In selecting the study sites, we judged that the social and environmental circumstances of the two neighbourhoods offered a useful contrast for a comparative analysis of neighbourhood effects on older adults' health.
Following ethics clearance from the ethics committees of the University of Alberta and University of Ghana, a cross-sectional survey was carried out in the Summer of 2018 with a snowballed sample of older adults residing in the Nima slum (n = 302) and the Adabraka-Asylum Down non-slum neighbourhood (n = 301). The sample size was computed using Dhand and Khatkar's (2014) statistical tool, the pooled mean difference and standard deviation of a similar study ( Izutsu et al., 2006 ), and an alpha level of 0.01. The sample size computation yielded 255 respondents for each neighbourhood, which we deemed as: (1) having a 90% statistical power for detecting statistically significant differences in mean QoL scores between the two independent samples, if any existed; and (2) being adequate for statistically adjusting for the confounding influence of covariates in multivariable regression analyses .
The use of snowball sampling for participant recruitment was appropriate, since older adults constituted a small and hard-to-reach population in both the slum and non-slum, and as such could not have been reached using conventional probability or non-probability sampling techniques ( Heckathorn, 2011 ). Several previous QoL studies involving older adults also utilized snowball sampling techniques in their sample recruitment (e.g. Trentini et al., 2011 ; Kirchengast and Haslinger, 2008 ). In recruiting participants, our team undertook house-to-house visits in a continuous process of referral until the required sample size was obtained. In each neighbourhood, we recruited one participant per household.
We used the WHO QoL assessment tool (WHOQoL-BREF), which consists of 26 questions, each with 5-point Likert scale responses. The tool self-assesses QoL across four domains: physical, psychological, social, and environment ( Gholami et al., 2016 ). The four domains contain 24 items that seek to understand respondents' perception of their functional health, social relationships , safety, and satisfaction with home and neighbourhood environments within the last two weeks ( Appendix 1 ). Scores for domain questions are “scaled in a positive direction” ( WHOQoL Group, 1996 , p. 10), from 0 to 100, with higher scores denoting better QoL. We adopted this tool because of its: (1) global recognition as a cross-culturally validated QoL assessment instrument, having been tested in 23 countries representing all the world's major regions ( Skevington, Lotfy and O'Connell, 2004 ); and (2) widespread usage in QoL assessment with older slum dwellers in developing countries (e.g. Ghosh et al., 2014 ; Kyobutungi et al., 2010 ).
Two trained research assistants with in-depth knowledge of the neighbourhoods assisted with implementing the survey. Twenty pretest interviews were completed in two different neighbourhoods with sociodemographic and environmental profiles similar to the selected slum and non-slum neighbourhoods. The pretest exercise afforded an opportunity to: (1) familiarize the research assistants with the administration of the survey tool; and (2) confirm the respondents' understanding of the WHOQoL-BREF questions. The pretest resulted in a minor adjustment to the local language translation of the social domain question inquiring about the respondents' sex life. In administering the tool, the research assistants approached potential respondents in their homes, explained the study's objectives, and requested their participation afterwards. They read the domain questions aloud to each consenting respondent, whose responses were then recorded on a printed questionnaire. Consent was verbal and ongoing ( Brod and Feinbloom, 1990 ), with possibilities for participant withdrawal.
The outcome variables were the QoL domain scores, assessed using the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire. The primary independent variable of interest was neighbourhood residence (with indicator variable slum vs. non-slum). The sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, including sex, age, marital status, religion, formal education, residential tenure, living arrangements, homeownership, income status, and illness status were recorded as covariates of the primary independent variable (i.e. neighbourhood residence). The WHOQoL-BREF tool and previous QoL research with older adults in SSA informed the selection ofsociodemographic variables (e.g. Bennett et al., 2016 ; Kyobutungi et al., 2010 ; Debpuur et al., 2010 ). Following Debpuur et al. (2010) , age was categorized into 60–69, 70–79, and 80+ years, while sex was categorized as male and female. Marital status was categorized as single/separated, married, widowed, and divorced, while religion was categorized as Christian and Muslim. Formal education was categorized into: none at all, primary, secondary, and tertiary; and residential tenure into: <5 years in neighbourhood and ≥5 years in neighbourhood. Living arrangements were categorized into: living alone and living with family; homeownership into: renting and own property; and income status into: yes (has regular source of income) and no (lacks regular source of income). Finally, respondents were asked whether they were currently ill, with responses categorized into: yes and no.
The participants’ responses to questions in each domain were totalled and transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100 (as described in the WHOQoL-BREF manual), where higher scores denoted better QoL ( WHOQoL Group, 1996 ). The average of the remaining domain responses was computed and used as replacement for missing values (as stipulated in the WHOQoL-BREF manual). Subsequently, statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 15 ( StataCorp, 2017 ). Numbers and percentages were reported for categorical variables, while means and standard deviations were reported for continuous variables. Chi-square tests were used to compare the sociodemographic characteristics of the slum and non-slum samples. Mean QoL scores were computed and compared for the various sociodemographic categories of the respondents using either two-sample t-tests or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple pairwise Bonferroni correction comparisons, wherever appropriate. A p -value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
To estimate the strength of association between neighbourhood residence and the various mean domain scores, multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for the confounding influence of relevant sociodemographic factors . Assumptions of normality of the QoL domain scores and independence of the predictor variables were tested using histograms and the Cramer's V, respectively. Per the resulting histograms, the domain scores were normally distributed, while the Chi-square test of association using the Cramer's V indicated no evidence of strong association between any two of the independent variables. For each QoL domain model, the backwards stepwise elimination method was applied, wherein important variables and those with p -values ≤ 0.2 at the univariate level were included in the first model as covariates (see Luger et al., 2016 ; Blay and Marchesoni, 2011 ). Sex and age are considered biologically important determinants of QoL, and were therefore included in all first and subsequent models, regardless of their level of statistical significance (see Telenius et al., 2013 ; Paskulin et al., 2009 ). In subsequent models, the variables with the highest p -values were eliminated sequentially until the final model was fitted. Confounding, set at a threshold of ≥15% change in regression coefficient ( Bursac et al., 2008 ), was investigated in each re-estimated model. Whenever a confounding relationship occurred between any two variables, both were retained in the model, and the variable with the next highest statistically non-significant p -value was considered for elimination. This iterative process of variable elimination and retention persisted until the best fitted model was obtained for each QoL domain. The sex and age variables were retained in all models. In the final model for each domain, interactions between covariates were investigated, but no interaction terms for any two of the covariates were found to be statistically significant. For each (domain) fitted regression model, assumptions of linearity, independence, normality, and homoscedasticity were tested and confirmed using residual plots and residual histograms. All assumptions were satisfied in each domain model.

Section: 4. Results

The majority of respondents were female (60.9%), Christian (70.9%), widowed (46.4%), 60–69 year old (59%), and regular income earners (69.3%) ( Table 1 ). There were a few statistically significant differences between the slum and non-slum respondents – e.g. the non-slum respondents were predominantly Christian (92%), while the slum sample consisted of nearly equal proportions of Muslims and Christians; and compared to the non-slum sample, the slum respondents were less educated and more likely to be renters, married, and living with family. There were no statistically significant differences between the two samples with regard to respondents’ sex, age, income status, and illness status. Table 1 .

Table 2 shows the mean WHOQoL scores, stratified by sociodemographic characteristics and neighbourhood residence. At the bivariate level, men reported significantly higher QoL scores than women: physical—men 71.7, women 64.5 ( p < 0.001); psychological—men 73.9, women 68.0 ( p < 0.001); social—men 75.7, women 72.8 ( p = 0.015); and environment—men 67.2, women 65.5 ( p = 0.057). Age was inversely related to physical QoL; respondents in the younger age category (60–69 years of age) had significantly higher physical QoL scores than those in older age groups ( p < 0.001). The reverse was observed in the psychological, social, and environment domains, where older respondents reported higher scores than younger respondents. However, these age differences were not statistically significant, except in the environment domain where respondents in the age group 60–69 years of age reported statistically significant lower QoL scores than respondents in the age group 70–79 years ( p = 0.008). Married respondents had significantly higher physical ( p < 0.001) and psychological ( p = 0.022) QoL scores than widowed respondents. The difference between married and single/separated respondents was also statistically significant in the social domain (p = 0.018). Muslims reported significantly higher psychological ( p = 0.005) and social ( p = 0.004) QoL than Christians. Although Muslims maintained a QoL advantage over Christians in the physical domain, this difference was statistically non-significant. Table 2 .

An education gradient was observed in physical QoL, where mean scores increased markedly with rising levels of education. Respondents with tertiary education reported significantly higher physical QoL scores than uneducated respondents ( p = 0.034). No education gradient was observed in the psychological, social, and environment domains. Across all four domains, there were also no statistically significant differences in QoL scores between respondents living alone and those living with family and between new and longer-term residents (<5 vs. 5+ years in neighbourhood). Homeowners reported significantly higher environmental QoL scores than renters ( p < 0.001), but the two did not differ significantly in physical, psychological, and social QoL scores.
Regular income earners reported significantly better physical QoL than respondents with no regular source of income ( p < 0.001), but surprisingly reported lower social QoL than those without steady incomes ( p < 0.001). Ailing respondents reported significantly lower QoL scores than healthy respondents in the physical ( p < 0.001), psychological ( p < 0.001), and environment ( p = 0.032) domains. The slum respondents reported significantly higher social QoL scores than the non-slum respondents (mean 75.8 vs. 72.0; p = 0.001), but had significantly lower scores than the latter in environmental QoL (mean 63.8 vs. 68.5; p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were seen between the slum and non-slum respondents in physical (mean 67.0 vs. 67.7; p = 0.640) and psychological (mean 70.6 vs. 70.0; p = 0.674) QoL.
The univariate and multivariable linear regression models provide estimates of the extent to which slum and non-slum respondents differed in reported physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL, after statistically adjusting for the confounding influence of relevant covariates. The explained variance ( R 2 ) in the final models ranged from 5.8% in the psychological domain to 7.1% in the social domain, 9.1% in the environment domain, and 31.5% in the physical domain ( Table 3 , Table 4 , Table 5 , Table 6 ). Table 3 shows that, at the univariate level, there was no statistically significant difference between the slum and non-slum respondents in physical QoL (coeff : 0.6 ; 95% CI: −2.1, 3.4; p = 0.640). The absence of a statistically significant difference persisted after adjusting for relevant covariates in the multivariable linear regression model (coeff: 0.5; 95% CI: −1.7, 2.8; p = 0.642).

However, there were sex, age, income status, and illness status differences in physical QoL in the multivariable regression model. Female sex, older age, lack of regular income, and being ill were associated with significantly lower physical QoL scores.
As with physical QoL, there was no statistically significant difference between the slum and non-slum respondents in psychological QoL at the univariate level (coeff: −0.5; 95% CI:
−2.9, 1.9; p = 0.674). The difference attenuated even further after adjusting for relevant covariates in the multivariable linear regression model (coeff: −0.2; 95% CI: −3.0, 2.6; p = 0.893) ( Table 4 ). Rather than differences in neighbourhood residence, sex, illness status, and religion accounted for the variance in psychological QoL. Women, ailing respondents, and Christians had significantly lower psychological QoL scores, compared to men, healthy respondents, and Muslims, respectively ( Table 4 ).
At the univariate level, the slum respondents reported significantly better social QoL than their non-slum counterparts (coeff: −3.8; 95% CI: −6.2, −1.5; p = 0.001) ( Table 5 ). Despite a slight reduction, the difference between the two samples remained statistically significant after adjusting for relevant covariates in the multivariable regression model (coeff: −3.2; 95% CI: −5.6, −0.8; p = 0.010). Social QoL was also significantly lower for women, single/separated respondents, and regular income earners in the final model ( Table 5 ).
The non-slum respondents reported significantly higher environmental QoL than the slum respondents at the univariate level (coeff: 4.8; 95% CI: 3.0, 6.5; p < 0.001) ( Table 6 ). This difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for relevant covariates in the multivariable linear regression model (coeff: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.3, 6.2; p < 0.001). Older age, living in own home, and illness-free life were also associated with significantly better environmental QoL ( Table 6 ).

Section: 5. Discussion and conclusion

Some methodological and conceptual limitations of the study are noteworthy. First, although the reliance on snowball samples was unavoidable, this recruitment approach limited the representativeness of the sample and generalizability of the findings, since participants may simply have suggested for recruitment individuals similar to themselves. However, sampling variability was minimized by our relatively large sample size. Second, similar to previous QoL research (e.g. Schrier et al., 2016 ; Helvik et al., 2010 ), the R-squares for the multivariable linear regression models were low for the psychological, social, and environment domains, suggesting that the regression models failed to account for all important variables driving the reported QoL. Nevertheless, our findings contribute useful insights to public health understanding of the QoL of slum and non-slum older adults in urban SSA.
Contrary to popular beliefs of an across-the-board health and QoL disadvantage in slums ( Alaazi and Aganah, 2019 ), this study found largely similar reported QoL among slum and non-slum older adults. No statistically significant difference in physical QoL was found between the slum and non-slum respondents, even after controlling for the confounding effects of relevant sociodemographic variables. The slum and non-slum samples were similar with regard to age and labour force involvement, and thus appeared to have similar capacities for mobility and activities of daily living , all of which would be expected to predict similar physical QoL ( Reid and Fielding, 2012 ; WHOQoL Group, 1996 ; Kim et al., 2018 ). Rather than differences in neighbourhood characteristics, the variance in physical QoL was largely attributable to differences in respondents’ sex, age, income status, and illness status. Consistent with the QoL literature ( Gobbens and van Assen, 2017 ; Bodur and Cingil, 2009 ), men had significantly higher physical QoL scores than women. The sex disparity in reported physical QoL may have been due, in part, to a culture of masculinity , which socializes African men to exaggerate the soundness of their health and QoL (see Evans et al., 2011 ).
The observed inverse relationship between age and physical QoL is also consistent with previously published QoL findings ( Kyobutungi et al., 2010 ; Van Minh, Byass, Thi Kim Chuc and Wall, 2010 ). Advancement in age often coincides with physiological changes and increasing burden of debilitating chronic illnesses that compromise physical wellness. The younger-old, in comparison, experience less bodily pain, have comparatively higher muscle power, and encounter fewer mobility constraints, allowing them to enjoy better physical QoL than their older counterparts. Consistent with the literature ( Yamada et al., 2015 ; Tüzün et al., 2015 ), physical QoL was significantly lower for ailing respondents than for healthy individuals, a difference that may be attributed to the physical pain and physical inactivity associated with illness.
Similar to physical QoL, the slum and non-slum respondents did not differ significantly in psychological QoL scores in both the univariate and multivariable models. Most respondents were long-term residents of their respective neighbourhoods, who may have developed similar levels of neighbourhood attachment and gained similar experiences of place affect and psychosocial wellness (see Zhang and Zhang, 2017 ; Wiles et al., 2009 ). Instead, differences in sex and illness status accounted for much of the observed variance in psychological QoL. Female respondents had significantly lower psychological QoL scores than male respondents in both univariate analysis and multivariable regression models. Bodur and Cingil (2009) also reported comparatively lower psychological QoL scores for women in their study of community-residing older adults in Turkey. In the SSA context, women's psychological health disadvantage is partly attributable to their low socioeconomic status ( Bennet, Chepngeno-Langat, Evandrou and Falkingham, 2016 ), which denies them the full enjoyment of and satisfaction with life. Ailing respondents reported significantly lower psychological QoL scores than those in good health. This was probably so because illness often leads to mood swings , depression, dissatisfaction with life, and hence lower psychological QoL ( Abas et al., 2009 ).
The slum respondents reported significantly higher social QoL than their non-slum counterparts. The practice of Zakat (Islamic principle of kindness and almsgiving) in the slum, a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood, may have contributed to this reported pattern (see Weiss, 2002 ). In contrast, despite the existence of a paralleled religious principle (i.e. caritas or agape ) in the non-slum, this Christian-dominated neighbourhood appeared to lack a similarly elaborate welfare system, placing its older adults at risk of lower social QoL. The observed variance in social QoL was additionally explained by differences in sex, marital status, and income status. Female sex and single/separated marital status were associated with significantly lower social QoL scores. Married respondents reported significantly higher social QoL than single/separated respondents, consistent with previous findings ( Gutiérrez-Vega et al., 2018 ; Margelisch et al., 2017 ). In general, married older adults are better able to pool resources and social networks to enhance their wellbeing ( Arber, 2004 ). In traditional African societies where marital relationships confer higher social status, marriage may also enhance the social acceptability of older adults in their communities ( Alli and Maharaji, 2013 ).
Respondents with no regular sources of income reported significantly higher social QoL scores than those with regular sources of income. Since two of the three questions used for this domain are concerned with friends and personal relationships, it is possible that those not working and earning income would score higher than those who continued to be engaged in income-generating activities and therefore had less time to build friendships and social networks.
In both the univariate analysis and multivariable linear regression models, as one would expect, the slum respondents reported significantly lower environmental QoL than the non-slum respondents. Being a planned neighbourhood, with an interconnected network of well-demarcated streets and a comparatively better housing infrastructure, the non-slum offered better opportunities for a cleaner environment. The slum, on the other hand, is an unplanned settlement with poorer housing and sanitation infrastructure, open gutters, and fewer streets and sidewalks (impeding mobility). These findings corroborate a recent World Health Organization assessment portraying sub-Saharan African slums as age-unfriendly settings that undermine active aging ( World Health Organization, 2015b ). In addition to non-slum residence, older age, owning a home, and being illness-free were associated with significantly better environmental QoL. The observation of a positive correlation between environmental QoL and higher age and homeownership has been reported by other investigators ( Hawthorne et al., 2006 ; Bodur and Cingil, 2009 ). Older individuals and homeowners are usually long-term residents with attachment to their neighbourhood and home surroundings. Ailing older adults may also spend more of their time indoors, and as such may be less affected by their neighbourhood environment.
Overall, our study has found that reported QoL is similar for older adults residing in slum and non-slum areas (objectives 1 and 2), and that sociodemographic factors play a critical role in determining QoL of older adults. Our findings also suggest that the effects of inferior slum environments on QoL may be buffered by other important determinants, notably the existence of stronger social relationships and support systems . Robust social ties and supports in slums may, to some extent, compensate for their poorer physical environments, resulting in overall QoL scores that compare favourably with those of non-slum older adults. In other words, stronger social supports in slums may provide a layer of protection against environmental adversities, allowing older slum dwellers to enjoy a QoL comparable to that reported by non-slum-dwelling older adults. This observation also challenges the current lopsided discourse portraying slums as unhealthy environments that must be cleared to avert potential public health crises ( Alaazi and Aganah, 2019 ). Rather, slums need to be understood as complex milieus that may simultaneously threaten and support health and QoL. Efforts to improve the QoL of older slum dwellers must therefore address their need for services and improved housing infrastructure. Such interventions are critically important, as the lack of affordable housing confronting many African cities will continue to drive significant numbers of older adults into slums. Interventions to enhance the wellbeing of older slum dwellers should also address the disparities in QoL arising from sex, age, and income differences among this population.
