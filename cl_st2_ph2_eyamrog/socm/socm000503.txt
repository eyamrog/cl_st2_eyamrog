Title: Stock market fluctuation and stroke incidence: A time series study in Eastern China


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Objective

To explore the association between daily change of Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index and stroke incidence in Zhejiang, China.

Abstract_Section: Methods

Data on daily stock index change and stroke incidence during 2009–2016 were collected to form the time series. Data were analyzed using distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) with quasi-Poisson as link function, controlling for long-term and seasonal trends, day of the week, public holiday, meteorological factors , and economic conditions.

Abstract_Section: Results

Large changes in daily stock index were associated with increased risk of stroke. Rise of stock index was significantly related to higher stroke incidence without delay. The relative risks (RRs) of stroke on the lag0 day were 1.040 (95% CI 1.011–1.071) for 100 index increase, and 1.111 (95% CI 1.000–1.235) for 200 index increase. Additionally, fall of stock index was associated with higher stroke incidence at lag of 5 and 6 days. The relative risks (RRs) of stroke for −200 index decline on the lag5 and lag6 day were 1.058 (95% CI 1.025–1.093) and 1.061 (95% CI 1.019–1.104) respectively. The association was relatively consistent across subgroups stratified by the subtype of stroke, gender, and age groups.

Abstract_Section: Conclusion

Both rise and fall of stock index were associated with an elevated occurrence of stroke.

Section: 1. Introduction

Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and is the main cause of disability worldwide ( Gorelick, 2019 ). Based on estimation, there were 6.2 million deaths and 139.4 million DALYs due to stroke in 2019 ( World Health Organization, 2020 ), which ranked 2nd and 3rd among all causes of death and disability. Therefore, strategies for stroke prevention are of prime importance, and a considerable number of studies have investigated the risk factors associated with stroke ( Sarikaya et al., 2015 ). Evidence show that psychological distress is a significant risk factor for stroke ( Kuklina et al., 2012 ). People investing the stock markets may earn or lose wealth in a quite short period of time, and they are likely bearing a huge amount of stress. Consequently, stock market movement may represent a substantial psychological stress that could adversely affect morbidity and mortality of stroke.
A rich strand of the literature is already available on the immediate effect of short-term financial developments on health ( Nandi et al., 2012 ; Caroli and Godard, 2016 ; Vandoros and Kawachi, 2021 ; Giulietti et al., 2020 ; Vandoros et al., 2014 ; Engelberg and Parsons, 2016 ). However, only a few previous studies explored the association of stock market variation with morbidity or mortality of stroke. Two studies ( Chen et al., 2012 ; Lin et al., 2015 ) examined the relationship between stock market and stroke incidence and hospitalizations. Nonetheless, both of them did not control potential confounders, such as meteorological factors and economic conditions, which may affect the results. Two other studies ( Lin et al., 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ) took some of those factors into consideration to control confounding bias. Unfortunately, they chose the mortality as the outcome variable. Incidence as a more sensitive indicator was lack of analysis.
In this study, we explored the association between daily changes of the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index and stroke incidence, during 2009–2016 in Zhejiang Province, a relatively developed province located along east coast of China.

Section: 2. Methods

Zhejiang Province has a population of 50.39 million, and consists of 90 districts. It is adjacent to Shanghai, the financial capital of China. Zhejiang has been a relatively developed province in China with 5.02 millions locally registered SSE accounts ( China Securities Deposito, 2014 ), approximately 10% of Zhejiang's population. The study period was between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2016. Time-series analysis was adopted with daily stroke incidence as dependent variable and daily stock index change as key explanatory variable.
Data on daily incidence of stroke (ICD-10 codes: I60–I64) was obtained from a population-based stroke registry system. It has been established by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for stroke surveillance in 30 representative districts of Zhejiang, covering 16.6 million people. All newly cases diagnosed by physicians in local medical institutions were reported in the registry system through network. The incidence data is of high quality accordingly the previous study ( Guo et al., 2016 ).
Data on daily stock performance during the study period, including the opening, closing, change, and percent of change (%) of the Shanghai stock index was obtained from the SSE website ( http://www.sse.com.cn ). Daily stock index change was defined as the difference between the closing index and opening index of each day. For non-transaction days such as weekends and holidays, the value of daily stock index change was set to zero.
Previous studies suggested that meteorological factors ( Salam et al., 2019 ) were associated with stroke incidence. Consequently, meteorological factors were considered as confounders in our analysis. Daily meteorological data during the study period was downloaded from China Meteorological Data Service Center, including temperature, relative humidity , atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity . The literature has shown that economic conditions can affect physical health ( Eshak et al., 2017 ; Sposato and Saposnik, 2012 ). Therefore, economic conditions such as unemployment and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth should also be controlled as confounders in analysis. The unemployment rate and GDP of Zhejiang province were collected from the official website of Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Statistics ( http://tjj.zj.gov.cn/ ), which were provided on quarterly bases.
Considering the existence of non-linear and delayed association of short term exposures with acute events, our study utilized the Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) ( AGasparrini et al., 2010 ) to evaluate the association of stock index change with daily stroke incidence. The framework of DLNM could simultaneously represent non-linear exposure-response dependencies and delayed effects. We initially assumed that daily counts of stroke incidence followed a Poisson distribution . Then over-dispersion was taken into account on the condition that the total variance was not equal to the total number, and the over-dispersion constant was estimated through quasi-likelihood. The model was as follows: L o g [ E ( Y t ) ] = α + c b ( s t o c k i n d e x c h a n g e , 3 , l a g , 4 ) + n s ( t i m e , 4 / y e a r ) + n s ( c o n f o u n d e r s , 3 ) + D O W + P H where Yt represents the daily count of stroke incidence; α is the intercept; cb() is the cross-basis function for the two dimensions of predictor and lags, involving a natural cubic spline with 3 degrees of freedom (df) in the stock index change space and a polynomial with 4 df in the lag space ; ns(time, 4/year) represents the natural cubic spline for time with 4 df per year to control seasonal and long-term trends; we set 7 days as the maximum lag period; ns(confounders, 3) refers to the natural cubic spline with 3 df respectively to control the meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity , atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity) and economic conditions (GDP and unemployment rate); DOW and PH are binary variables to control the influence of the day of week and public holiday, respectively.
We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of stroke at −200, −100, 100, and 200 point of index change relative to 0 point change over different lag days. Furthermore, we implemented stratified analyses to test whether observed associations varied by the subtype of stroke (hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke), gender (male and female), and age groups (≤65 years and >65 years). Meanwhile, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the stability of model in several ways including: (1) changing degrees of freedom for time variable (df = 4∼7), meteorological factors (df = 3~5), and economic conditions (df = 3~5); (2) excluding covariates of meteorological factors and economic conditions.
All statistical analyses were performed by R software (version 3.6.1) with “dlnm” package ( Gasparrini, 2011 ) for fitting DLNM model, and the significance level was at two-tailed probability <0.05.

Section: 3. Results

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of daily stroke incidence, stock index change and covariates. On average, 150.9 stroke patients per day were documented between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2016. The minimal, median and maximal daily stroke incidence were 67, 148, and 451, respectively. During the same period, the daily stock index variation ranged from −345.4 to 224.2. The stock index increased rapidly from January to July in 2009, and then declined slow still May 2014 with temporal fluctuation. Soon afterwards the stock index surged more than 2.5-fold from 2038 in June 2014 to 5166 in June 2015, and then declined rapidly to 2655 in January 2016. After that, the stock index fluctuating around 2800–3000 ( Fig. 1 ). The daily mean temperature, relative humidity , atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity was 17.7 °C, 75.7%, 1008.2 hPa, and 2.6 m/s, respectively. Table 1 .

Fig. 2 shows a three-dimensional pattern of RR of stroke varying along daily stock index change and lag days. The RR of stroke increased for rise of stock index at first few days. Then, the RR increased for falling of stock index after about 5 days. The RR of stroke incidence for specific daily stock index changes at different lag days was presented in Table 2 , Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 . The RRs of stroke on the lag0 day were 1.040 (95% CI 1.011–1.071) for 100 index increase, and 1.111 (95% CI 1.000–1.235) for 200 index increase. However, the stroke incidence was not associated with rise of stock index on the following lag days. Moreover, no significant association was observed for decrease of stock index during the first few days. Statistically significant associations for −200 index decline were detected on the lag5 day (RR 1.058, 95% CI 1.025–1.093) and lag6 day (RR 1.061, 95% CI 1.019–1.104). A similar trend was found for −100 index decline. Download: Download high-res image (931KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 2 .

The results of subgroup analysis indicated that the association was relatively consistent across subgroups stratified by the subtype of stroke ( Figure S1 and S2 ), gender ( Figure S3 and S4 ), and age groups ( Figure S5 and S6 ). In sensitivity analyses, both changing the degree of freedom for several variables, and excluding covariates of meteorological factors and economic conditions, yielded undifferentiated results to the main analysis.

Section: 4. Discussion

In this study, we explored the relationship between stroke incidence and stock index change. The results of our study suggested that large changes in daily stock index were associated with increased risk of stroke. Rise of stock index was significantly related to higher stroke incidence without delay, while fall of stock index corresponded with increased occurrence of stroke at lag of 5 and 6 days.
The SSE Composite Index, a key indicator of the Chinese stock market provided by the SSE, oscillated remarkably during 2009–2016. The stock index increased rapidly from January to July in 2009, and then declined slowly still May 2014 with temporal fluctuation. From June to December of 2014, the stock index rose from 2023.7 to 3234.7. The stock index has peaked with 5166.4 on June 12, 2015. Whereas, the stock index plummeted to 2655.7 on January 28, 2016. For the next 11 months, the stock index has been fluctuated between 2700 and 3300. The number of accounts for all listed stocks (A shares) in both the SSE and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) increased from 181,403,520 in January 2014, to 235,975,259 in June 2015 –that is, more than one-fifth of Chinese adults speculated in the stock market ( Qin et al., 2019 ). Considering such a large fluctuation, exposure to stock can be recognized as an influential life events during that period, and the potential effects of stock investment on health warrants further investigation.
Our current findings are partially consistent with the previous studies. One study ( Chen et al., 2012 ) found that fall of Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index was associated with higher incidence of stroke. Another study ( Lin et al., 2015 ) indicated that 3 and 6 days after an increase of margin trading in the Taiwan stock markets was associated with greater stroke hospitalizations. However, both of them did not control potential confounders, such as meteorological factors and economic conditions. Previous literature demonstrated that meteorological factors ( Salam et al., 2019 ) and economic conditions ( Eshak et al., 2017 ; Sposato and Saposnik, 2012 ) had a close temporal association with stroke. As a consequence, confounding bias could not be excluded in above mentioned studies, which may help to explain some of the controversy over our findings. Two other studies ( Lin et al., 2013 ; Zhang et al., 2013 ) used mortality as health measure, although they controlled some of confounders mentioned above. Large changes in Shenzhen stock index were found to be associated with increased cardiovascular disease mortality in Guangzhou and Taishan, with a delayed effect at about 10 days later ( Lin et al., 2013 ). Besides, stroke deaths fluctuated with daily stock changes in Shanghai ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Nevertheless, atmospheric pressure and wind velocity were not considered as confounders in those studies, which may correlate with stroke either ( Salam et al., 2019 ; Cevik et al., 2015 ). In contrast to those two studies, our study extends the current literature in two ways. First, more meteorological factors (atmospheric pressure and wind velocity) as well as economic conditions were included in our analysis. Second, we used incidence as health measure. Mortality may be affected by other factors, such as medical condition and emergency ability. Better health care services can contribute to longer survival time or even avoid death. Therefore, incidence is possibly more sensitive and appropriate than mortality for time-series study design.
Biological mechanisms mediating the association of stock index change with stroke remain unclear. However, there are several plausible explanations. First, both rising and falling of the stock markets may represent substantial psychological stress ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Previous research indicates that psychological stress is a potential independent triggering factor for the occurrence of stroke ( Prasad et al., 2020 ). Second, depression may play an important role. It is suggested that negative wealth reduction confers an increased risk of depression ( Pool et al., 2017 ). Meanwhile, there is growing evidence that depression and depressive symptoms are risk factors for stroke ( Van der Kooy et al., 2007 ). Third, exposure to stock in a turbulent stock market, even in a bull market, significantly increases the level of anxiety ( Qin et al., 2019 ). Anxiety is a very prevalent condition associated with risk of stroke ( Perez-Pinar et al., 2017 ). In addition, our study implies that a fall of stock index is related to stroke incidence with delayed days. This phenomenon may be partially ascribed to loss aversion (including prospect theory) ( Tversky and Kahneman, 1991 ; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979 ), which predicts that individuals are usually risk-averse in the gain domain and risk-seeking in the loss domain. It is closely related to the disposition effect ( Shefrin and Statman, 1985 ) in stock market activities---investors tend to sell profitable stocks immediately but hold on to losing ones. Investors who hold on to losing stocks may be exposed with longer period of psychological stress, depression, or anxiety, which probably lead to the lagged effect on cerebrovascular health. However, the lag patterns of the impact from a decrease in stock index may be also explained by chance, or there may be unobserved factors that occur later from the effect of falling in stock market. More studies are needed to understand the lag structure of market fluctuation on cerebrovascular health.
There are several methodological issues and limitations. First, due to the aggregated data and ecological study design, the capacity for causal inference of our study was limited. Ecological fallacy should be carefully noticed, and the association observed based on an aggregate level in our study does not necessarily represent or reflect the association that exists at an individual level. So we cannot directly conclude that investment of stock market has harmful effect on one's cerebrovascular health. Moreover, the effect of individual level confounders, such as demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and health related variables, could not be excluded. By design, time-series analysis examines the same population repeatedly over time under varying exposures, and therefore, time-invariant population characteristics might not substantially bias the analyses ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). Nonetheless, we cannot ignore the variations in individual risk factors potentially contributing to stroke incidence. Hence, prospective studies using individual level data are warranted to prove the association. Second, we have no information on the proportion of people investing on the stock market as well as its temporal variation, although it was reported that a large scale of residents in the study area had experience of stock market investment. Third, the residual confounding probably existed, which might strengthen, weaken or even faked the association. The dependent and independent variable can be both affected by a common unmeasured factor, though we have adjusted a wide range of potential confounders. Fourth, we cannot obtain the surveillance data on stroke incidence from Shanghai and other major cities which are major financial hubs. Future studies using data from those areas on this topic are needed.
Despite these limitations, this study has a number of strengths. First, we utilized DLNM to describe simultaneously non-linear and delayed association between stock index change and stroke incidence, a dependency recognized as exposure-lag-response association. Moreover, the sensitive analysis suggested that our results were relatively robust. Second, we conducted subgroup analysis stratified by the subtype of stroke. Ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke have in the majority of studies been analyzed as a combined outcome despite the possibility that stock index change may affect underlying pathophysiological pathways differently ( Ljungman and Mittleman, 2014 ). It turned out that the association was relatively consistent across different subtypes of stroke.
In conclusion, our study suggested that large changes in stock index were related to elevated occurrence of stroke, and lagged pattern were different for a rise and a fall in stock index. More studies based on individual level data are needed to confirm the association of stock market investment with cerebrovascular health.
