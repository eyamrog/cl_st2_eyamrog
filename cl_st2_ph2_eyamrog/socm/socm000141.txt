Title: The effect of a shelf placement intervention on sales of healthier and less healthy breakfast cereals in supermarkets: A co-designed pilot study


Abstract: Abstract

Supermarkets are the principal source of grocery food in many high-income countries. Choice architecture strategies show promise to improve the healthiness of food choices. A retailer-academic collaboration was formed to co-design and pilot selected commercially sustainable strategies to increase sales of healthier foods relative to less healthy foods in supermarkets. Two co-design workshops, involving supermarket corporate staff and public health nutrition academics, identified potential interventions. One intervention, more prominent shelf placement of healthier products within one category (breakfast cereals), was selected for testing. A pilot study (baseline, intervention and follow-up, 12-weeks each) was undertaken in six supermarkets (three intervention and three control) in Auckland, New Zealand. Products were ranked by nutrient levels and profile, and after accounting for the supermarkets’ space management principles, healthier products were placed at adult eye level. The primary outcome was change in sales of healthier products relative to total category sales. Secondary outcomes were nutrient profile of category sales, in-store product promotions, customer perceptions, and retailer feedback. There was no difference in proportional sales of more prominently positioned healthier products between intervention (56%) and control (56%) stores during the intervention. There were no differences in the nutrient profile of category sales. A higher proportion of less healthy breakfast cereals were displayed in intervention versus control stores (57% vs 43%). Most customers surveyed supported shelf placement as a strategy (265, 88%) but noted brand preferences and price were more salient determinants of purchases. Retailers were similarly supportive but balancing profit, health/nutrition and customer satisfaction was challenging. Shelf placement alone was not an effective strategy to increase purchases of healthier breakfast cereals . This study showed co-design of a healthy eating intervention with a commercial retailer is feasible, but concurrent retail environment factors likely limited the public health impact of the intervention.

Section: 1. Introduction

Supermarkets are the principal source of grocery food in high-income countries ( Drewnowski and Rehm, 2013 ; Escaron et al., 2013 ), including New Zealand (NZ) ( Health Sponsorship Council, 2012 ). In addition to offering a wide range of staple/healthier foods, including fresh fruit and vegetables, supermarkets are sources of less healthy foods and sugar sweetened beverages ( An and Maurer, 2016 ). Internationally, less healthy foods are usually heavily promoted in supermarkets ( Charlton et al., 2015 ) and occupy prominent shelf space ( Thornton et al., 2012 ). In NZ supermarkets, unhealthy foods occupy more shelf space compared to healthy foods ( Vandevijvere et al., 2018 ). Therefore, supermarkets are an important food environment for corrective action to improve population diet quality ( Hawkes et al., 2013 ). Unhealthy diets are the foremost cause of poor health outcomes globally ( GBD Risk Factors Collaborators, 2016 ) and in NZ ( Ministry of Health, 2016 ).
Altering factors in the environment without restricting choices or modifying prices, to positively impact consumer choice, is known as nudging or choice architecture ( Thaler and Sunstein, 2008 ). Nudging has been used to underpin strategies to improve the nutritional quality of food choices in a range of food retail settings including universities, hospitals and restaurants ( Wilson et al., 2016 ). A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that nudge interventions increased healthier food choices by an average of 15.3 percent, quantified either by frequency of healthy food selection or by overall food intake change ( Arno and Thomas, 2016 ). Changes to the sequence or closeness of food products has also been shown to be a low-cost nudge strategy that positively influences food choices ( Bucher et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, strategies that require little or no engagement or ‘conscious’ decision making by consumers have shown potential to reduce disparities ( Hollands et al., 2016 ; Hunter et al., 2019 ).
There is a growing evidence base for the effectiveness of supermarket-based interventions on consumer food choice. Environmental strategies, although less impactful than pricing strategies, are more effective than educational strategies ( Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018 ). A recent systematic review of supermarket-based interventions showed that shelf tags, mass media, taste testing, signage and placement led to improvements in the nutritional quality of consumer purchases ( Cameron et al., 2016 ). Previous NZ-based research in supermarkets has investigated price discounts, provision of culturally tailored consumer nutrition education ( Ni Mhurchu et al., 2010 ) and interpretive product nutrition labelling ( Ni Mhurchu et al., 2017 ). New Zealand's supermarket industry includes two major supermarket retailers ( Euromonitor International, 2019 ) and small changes by these retailers have therefore significant potential to improve the quality of the NZ population diet. Both supermarket companies have voluntarily committed to implement a range of healthy eating promotion strategies ( Food for Thought Educational Trust .; Woolworths New Zealand, 2017 ) but the effect of such strategies on shopper purchases is currently untested. Researcher-induced supermarket interventions are also often not implemented in the real world because they are not cost-effective for the retailer. Therefore, this study used a co-design approach with one leading NZ supermarket retailer as a method to select a specific intervention, and pilot test its effects on product sales.

Section: 2. Methods

Ethical approval for the co-design and pilot study was obtained from the University of Auckland Human Participants Ethics Committee (UAHPEC) (reference number 022888). Informed consent was obtained from participants in the shopper survey.
A non-financial partnership was established between the research team and Woolworths NZ for this study. Woolworths NZ is one of two major supermarket retailers in NZ, with a 39% share of the national supermarket grocery market ( Euromonitor International, 2019 ), 180 Countdown stores nationwide and 3.2 million shoppers each week ( Woolworths New Zealand, 2019 ). A collaboration agreement was signed between Woolworths NZ and the University of Auckland outlining intellectual property contributions, joint responsibilities, communication processes, and publications and confidentiality clauses for the duration of the study. Woolworths NZ did not provide any direct funding although they provided in-kind support (in the form of staff time for co-design, planogram development, extraction of sales data, in-store shelf alterations, interviews and access to six stores for product audits and shopper surveys).
The co-design phase involved corporate personnel from Woolworths NZ representing health, nutrition , purchasing, and communications (n = 4), and public health nutrition academics (n = 4) from the University of Auckland. An independent group facilitator (mpconsulting), with experience in co-design, was contracted to manage the co-design process. Prior to the co-design workshops, Woolworths NZ participants were interviewed by the facilitator to assess their anticipated outcomes from the workshops and a workshop outline was prepared by the facilitator. Two co-design workshops were held in November 2018. Between workshops, the facilitator prepared a summary of the potential interventions and issues identified during the workshops. Following the two workshops, the facilitator conducted a thematic analysis of the workshop discussions. This was sent to all participants for agreement prior to confirmation. Nine potential interventions were identified during the co-design phase. These interventions were mapped against choice architecture frameworks ( Hollands et al., 2016 ; Kraak et al., 2017 ) (by the researchers) and supermarket health and business strategies and resource availability (by Woolworths NZ), with one intervention, more prominent shelf placement of healthier breakfast cereals , selected to progress to a pilot study. The breakfast cereal category was selected to trial the intervention based on the following criteria: high-volume category sales, high within-category variability of product healthiness, and viability of piloting product placement alterations in the category.
A 36-week pilot intervention trial (12-week baseline, 12-week intervention, 12-week follow-up) was conducted in six Countdown supermarkets (3 intervention and 3 matched control stores) in Auckland, ,New Zealand between February and October 2019. The study consisted of a pre-intervention period from 4 February – 28 April, 2019, the intervention period from 29 April – 21 July, 2019 and the post-intervention period from 22 July – 13 October, 2019.
This was a shelf placement intervention with more prominent placement of healthier breakfast cereals and less prominent placement of less healthy cereals at selected supermarkets.
Three intervention stores were selected representing a range of low-to high-income urban areas in Auckland (from a total of 62 stores in the Auckland region), and matched with three control stores based on six key characteristics including customer market (defined as premium or discount, determined by sales of a designated list of 1500 products), shopping pattern (two clusters of stores were identified using product level sales and store census data), local area obesity rates, number of bays in breakfast cereal aisle, store breakfast cereal sales and category growth compared to previous year ( Table 1 ). Store size (retail trading area) was also a matching characteristic but is not reported due to commercial sensitivity. Table 1 . Baseline characteristics of participating stores.

Stores were excluded if they were undergoing renovation, involved in another Countdown trial, had atypical shopping patterns (e.g. airport stores), or were classified as a ‘premium’ store.
A list of all breakfast cereal products (n = 198), supplied by Countdown, was linked by barcode with nutrition information panel (NIP) data from Nutritrack (2018), an annually updated packaged food composition database . The product range during pre-intervention and intervention periods remained the same. However, for the post-intervention period, 39 products were phased out and 43 new products were added to the range (n = 202). Since the nutritional information for the new products was not available in Nutritrack (2018), information on the cereal pack size, nutritional composition, and ingredients was collected in-store (photographed) (n = 43) and added to the database for the statistical analysis.
Products were ranked solely for the intervention period. For the other periods, the retailer followed usual planogram design practices.
Breakfast cereal category segments pre-defined by Countdown were (1) Biscuits, (2) Cereal – Adult, (3) Cereal - All Family, (4) Cereal – Kids, (5) Muesli - Clusters and Granola, (6) Muesli - Natural and Toasted, (7) Oats – Loose and Sachets, and (8) Portables (breakfast beverages and single serve items). Breakfast cereals located in the geographically separate ‘health food’ section of the supermarket, including gluten-free or paleo-style breakfast cereals, were excluded.
The nutritional quality or healthiness of breakfast cereals was determined by the researchers through ranking every breakfast cereal according to the following individual nutritional criteria: energy density (kJ/100 g), total sugar (g/100 g), sodium (mg/100 g), fibre (g/100 g), Health Star Rating (HSR) score (estimated using NIP and product ingredient list values), and HSR rating ( Australian Government, 2018 ). Cereal rankings for each criterion were summed for all six measures and a final within-segment ranking from healthiest to least healthy was provided to Countdown. Multiple NIP data on single products (for example, single serve flavoured oat sachets) were averaged.
The aim was to place the healthier breakfast cereal products within each cereal segment more prominently on shelves, ideally at adult eye-level. Remaining products were placed below eye-level in rank order with the least healthy products being placed on the bottom shelf. The ranked product list was provided to the Countdown space management team responsible for development of new breakfast cereal shelf planograms for the intervention stores. However, because product brands and similar pack sizes are grouped together on supermarket shelves, the final shelf position depended to some extent on these factors as well as the product nutritional ranking. The number of shelves in each bay (sections within an aisle) varied between three and nine. For the purposes of the intervention, more prominent (or “adult eye-level”) shelf placement was defined as the top half of the bay ( Fig. 1 ). This meant that in six-shelf bays (the most common shelf layout), the top three shelves were considered prominent/“eye-level” placement. In four-shelf and five-shelf bays (next most common layout), the top three shelves were considered prominent/“eye-level”; in a three-shelf bay, the top two shelves; in seven- and eight-shelf bays, the top four shelves; and in nine-shelf bays, the top five shelves were considered prominent/“eye-level”. These different cut-points were approximately aligned in terms of distance from floor to the top of the bay despite the different numbers of shelves. In some cases, where the same product filled all shelves in a bay (common for some biscuit cereals and private label products with larger pack sizes), the product was classified as “prominent” because the large number of facings relative to other products meant these products were very salient even though some packs were on lower (less prominent) shelves. The definition of more prominent and less prominent cut points ( Fig. 1 ) was also applied to pre- and post-intervention planograms.

Example of the change in prominence of healthier and less healthy breakfast cereals between two bays (sections within an aisle) during the intervention.
On commencement of the intervention period, a shelf renovation team (Countdown and University staff) rearranged the shelf placement of breakfast cereals and pricing signage in the breakfast cereal aisle in the three intervention stores according to the new intervention planograms. This was done over three consecutive days mainly prior to store opening. Product placement alterations were not accompanied by any signage, or price changes. Control stores continued to use the pre-intervention planograms with no changes to shelf placement of breakfast cereals.
On completion of the intervention period (12 weeks) all stores were provided with a new planogram (non-health related) and a 3-week period allowed for shelf rearrangement (included in post-intervention-period).
Store (intervention and control) compliance with the product planograms was assessed by weekly store audits (using photographs) of actual placement of all products in the breakfast cereal aisle (bay and shelf number) during the intervention. Data was entered into an Excel spreadsheet and checked against the relevant store planogram. Any misplacement in either intervention or control stores, including products incorrectly located, products not on shelf, and dual placement (products placed in two shelf locations which usually occurs when allocated products are out of stock) were noted and reported to Countdown on a weekly basis. Countdown followed up any anomalies with store managers to rectify. In addition, one pre-intervention (baseline) and one post-intervention audit was undertaken in all stores.
Weekly product-level sales data for all breakfast cereals by store were supplied by Countdown for the 36-week study period. The following variables were included in the sales data; Week ID, date, store identifier, category, segment, barcode, product description, sales (dollars), quantity (number of products sold), transactions, and ASP (individual product price exclusive of Goods and Services Tax).
Countdown weekly promotional mailers, which are the same for all NZ stores, were reviewed for the intervention period and any concomitant breakfast cereal price promotions recorded. Data collated included the name of the product and the total number of promotions over the 12-week intervention period.
The presence of concomitant in-store displays of breakfast cereals (not covered by the planogram) including temporary in-aisle, end of aisle, and other in-store displays (located at store entrance or other location) were recorded (using photographs) during the weekly store product audits (but not for pre- or post-intervention periods). The number of products displayed were entered into Excel spreadsheet for collation and matched with planogram placement (prominent vs less prominent). Flavour variations of products were counted as separate products.
Interviews with retailer personnel were conducted to obtain views on the profitability, scalability, and commercial sustainability of the intervention. Informed consent was not required by UAHPEC for these interviewees as participation was deemed to be part of their company role. Three store employees (the store manager or long-life product manager at the intervention stores) and two Head Office staff (representing health, nutrition, and category management) were interviewed. The interviews took place during Week 12 (final week) of the intervention. A semi-structured interview guide aided discussion. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed in NVivo version 12 (QSR International Pty Limited, Victoria, Australia). Interviewees were offered the opportunity to review transcripts. Transcripts were reviewed by two researchers. Initial codes were assigned by one researcher (LY) and discussed with the second researcher (MR) to confirm.
The aim of the shopper survey was to investigate shopper awareness and attitudes to the intervention. Shoppers purchasing breakfast cereals in the intervention stores were approached in the breakfast cereal aisle and asked to participate in a 5-min survey. Surveys were scheduled at three time points, beginning, middle and end of the intervention period. Approximately 100 shoppers were surveyed at each time point (~35 per store). An option for participants to complete the survey online was also offered. The interviewer-administered survey questionnaire contained two main questions on awareness (“did you notice anything different about the breakfast cereal aisle today” and, if aware, “did this influence your product choice”) and attitudes (if unaware, the intervention was explained, and shoppers were asked “do you agree with this as a way to encourage healthier choices” and “did we make it easier for you to shop breakfast cereals today?“). Shopper survey data, including demographics of participants and responses to a range of quantitative and qualitative questions on the intervention were analysed using Excel (Microsoft Office Professional Plus, Version 16) and descriptively summarised.
As this was a pilot study, a range of outcomes were assessed in order to determine the viability and potential effectiveness of a larger-scale intervention. The main outcome measures were sales of healthier breakfast cereals placed in more prominent shelf positions in intervention versus matched control stores, sales of healthier breakfast cereals moved from a less prominent pre-intervention to more prominent shelf position during the intervention, and the nutritional composition of all breakfast cereal sales (energy density (kJ/100 g), total sugars (g/100 g), sodium (mg/100 g), fibre (g/100 g), HSR score and HSR). All outcomes were evaluated by intervention and control stores for all study periods, for all breakfast cereals combined and each category segment.
Other measures assessed included weekly mailer promotions (of breakfast cereals) and in-store product displays during the intervention period, shopper feedback on the intervention and retailer perceptions of the intervention.
Generalised linear mixed models were used to assess the overall effects on sales and nutritional composition over the three study periods, controlling for the random cluster effect of stores. Both treatment group, study period and their interaction were included in the fixed effects model to estimate the size of group difference between intervention and control stores during the pre-intervention, intervention and post-intervention periods. The possible confounding effects of in-store promotions, which were only recorded during the intervention period, were also assessed. Subgroup analyses were conducted for defined sub-categories of breakfast cereals. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). As it was a pilot study, we have focused on point estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals rather than statistical significance.

Section: 3. Results

In the planograms designed for intervention stores, 44% of products (n = 198) altered position from pre-intervention to intervention, with 22% moving from higher to lower prominence (less healthy products), 22% from lower to higher prominence (healthier products), and 56% of products not changing placement because they were already in the right shelf location or could not be moved due to space management restrictions.
A high degree of compliance with intervention planograms (>95% products correctly placed on shelf) was achieved in intervention stores over the 12-week intervention period, although slightly lower compliance was shown in control stores (between 86 and 94%) ( Table 2 ). Similarly, the number of products incorrectly located was small across intervention stores over the 12-week period, just 31 (<1%) healthier products were incorrectly located in a less prominent position and 46 less healthy products (<1%) were incorrectly located in a more prominent position compared to 138 and 159 respectively) ( Table 2 ). The percentage of products that were not on-shelf at the time of the audit in all stores was low (between 5 and 7%) and 3.6% or fewer products were dual placed. Table 2 .

Overall, breakfast cereals located in a more prominent shelf location during the intervention were healthier than those in less prominent shelf positions. Specifically, more prominently placed products had lower mean energy (−62 kJ/100 g, −4%) and sugar content (−2.1 g/100 g, −7%) and a higher mean fibre content (+2.2 g/100 g, +29%) and mean HSR (+0.4 stars, +10%) than products placed on less prominent shelves ( Table 3 ). Similarly, breakfast cereals located in a more prominent shelf position in intervention stores were healthier (lower mean energy [-62 kJ/100 g, −4%) and sugar content [-1.1 g/100 g, −7%] and higher fibre content [+1.5 g/100 g, +20%] and HSR [+0.2 stars, +5%] than those in a more prominent shelf position in control stores.

Foods lower in saturated fat , sugar or sodium and higher in healthy nutrients or components (fibre, protein, fruits, vegetables, nuts or legumes) gain more stars.
Breakfast cereal sales during the intervention period, overall and by cereal segment, are shown in Table 4 . Overall, there were minimal differences between intervention and control stores in percentage total dollar sales, total units sold, or total weight sold of more prominently positioned breakfast cereals, and in sales of cereals moved from less prominent to more prominent position during the intervention period.

There was no meaningful difference between intervention and controls stores in the nutritional composition of breakfast cereal sales during the intervention period (overall or by cereal segment) ( Supplementary Table 1 ).
There was no significant difference between intervention and control stores in weekly breakfast cereal sales either for products located in a more prominent position, or products moved to a more prominent position during intervention. The results were consistent across three study time periods (pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention) ( Table 5 ). There were also no significant differences between intervention and control stores in the nutritional composition (energy, sodium , sugar, fibre content and HSR score and HSR) of sales ( Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). As this was a pilot study with only six stores, the power to detect statistical differences between intervention and control groups was limited given the clustered nature of the data. Table 5 .

There were 292 promotions of breakfast cereals in weekly mailers over the 12-week intervention period. The cereal segments that were promoted most frequently were oats (loose and sachets) (38%) (reflected timing of the intervention over the NZ autumn/winter months April to July) and mueslis (18.5%), and with instances of promotions for all other segments being 12% or less each. Biscuit cereals, as a category, were the least promoted (3%). The healthiness (indicated by HSR) of promoted and non-promoted cereals was not significantly different ( Fig. 2 ).

There was a greater number of breakfast cereals on in-store display (areas not covered by the planogram) in intervention stores (685) compared to control stores (583) over the 12-week intervention period however, it is not known if this represented a change in store behaviour as pre- and post-trial monitoring was not recorded. A higher proportion of products displayed (390, 57%) in intervention stores were less healthy “less prominent” breakfast cereals compared to control stores (296, 51%). There were also relatively more of the less healthy, less prominent products (390, 57%) on display within intervention stores than healthier, more prominent products (295, 43%). In contrast, there was minimal difference between numbers of less healthy, less prominent breakfast cereals (296, 51%) and healthier, more prominent products (287, 49%) promoted in control stores. The most frequently displayed breakfast cereal products were oats (loose and sachets) (43%) and children's cereals (23%). The healthiness (shown by HSR) of products promoted via in-store product displays was not significantly different between intervention and control stores ( Fig. 3 ). A comparison of the number of promotional displays per store (counted from audit photographs; displays contained between one to eight products and were likely to include flavour variants of the same product) showed that one control store had slightly more displays compared to other stores; however, overall, the number of different products per display during the intervention period was similar (data not shown).

A significant interaction was apparent between in-store breakfast cereal displays and sales ( Supplementary Table 4 ).
Three hundred shoppers participated in the survey at the three intervention stores (no online surveys). Most (68%) were women, and 228 (76%) were aged between 25 and 64 years. More than half of the sample were families with either young (108, 36%) or adult children (54, 18%). Most participants (234, 78%) shopped at least weekly.
Three quarters of participants (230, 77%) had not noticed a change to the placement of breakfast cereals. Of those that noticed something different about the breakfast cereal aisle (70, 23%), around half (34, 48%) reported noticing a change in product placement, illustrated by statements such as ‘the products were changed on the shelves. Oats are on higher shelves’ but most shoppers (57, 81%) reported that the change (intervention) did not influence their breakfast cereal choice. These participants stated that they usually buy the same brand or came shopping with a brand and product in mind, shown by comments, “I already knew what I wanted to buy” and “I buy the same cereal all the time”. Most respondents (265, 88%) were supportive of the intervention. Common reasons for support were that eye level placement made it easier to select healthier choices, it was physically easier (harder to reach less healthy products on the bottom shelf) and for some, it highlighted healthier products, in particular, lower sugar products which was important ‘for our kids’ or ‘our health’. Specific comments included: ‘I think it is a good idea to put it at the eye level, so people see it first’ ‘I agree, no one likes to bend down’ ‘It is a good idea to help people since most of the choices are very sweet’ ‘I think it is a good idea especially for kids since we are trying to guide our kids towards healthy stuff’
A few participants (9, 3%) thought eye level placement would be useful when time was limited or when choosing a new product and others (6, 2%) recommended shoppers should be made aware that healthier cereals were located on the upper shelves, e.g. via signage. However, both shoppers who supported the intervention, (30, 11%) and those opposed to the intervention (32, 11%) stated that brand and price were the overriding factors determining their choice.
Five interviews were conducted with six Countdown staff (3 head office staff, 1 store manager and 2 long-life category managers).
Support for the intent of the intervention was high among all interviewees and details of the intervention were accurately recalled. Overall, interviewees commented that there were benefits for the organisation and shoppers from involvement in the research study and genuine interest in the results. “We've been able to trial something that is genuinely in the best interests of making our customers healthier”.
Key considerations for Countdown were achieving a balance between healthiness of product offerings and profit in the competitive retail environment, placing customers at the centre of decision-making, and an aspiration to innovate in the health/nutrition area. Interviewees noted that considerable investment of time and expertise had been required to develop the planograms for the intervention due to increased shelf management complexity. Shelf space management factors, such as the need to group brands and similar pack sizes, were acknowledged as having compromised the ideal placement of some healthier breakfast cereals on prominent shelves but that such factors were important for customer satisfaction.
The main barrier reported to store-level implementation was ensuring adherence to the planograms when multiple staff were responsible for shelf restocking and product placement following initial set up. “There are always a few things that moved around. So, it is just making sure that everybody knows what the plan is and why we are doing it and that is the hard thing. When someone who is doing the night fill might go ‘well here is a gap, there's some spare cereal, let's just put it here’ ".
Interviewees reported that there was minimal negative feedback on the intervention from shoppers, suppliers or store-level staff. Store staff thought shoppers should ideally be informed of the change to shelf placement to assist healthier product selection e.g. via signage. Overall, most interviewees were positive about the potential of the intervention to be rolled out to more stores and across other categories, although this was conditional on demonstrated profitability. However, concern was noted about the possible impact of a wider strategy on suppliers, especially companies whose products could be relocated from a more prominent to a less prominent shelf position.

Section: 4. Discussion

In this pilot study, the co-designed intervention, more prominent shelf placement of healthier products, had no effect on healthier breakfast cereal sales. Whilst small increases in sales were shown in two cereal segments and for two of the three intervention stores these were not statistically significant. Altering the shelf placement of products was the sole change made to the food category; therefore, this study was useful to test the effectiveness of this strategy in isolation. This single strategy study was unique compared to many supermarket interventions ( Adam and Jensen, 2016 ; Hartmann-Boyce et al., 2018 ), which commonly test multiple strategies (signage, placement, education, price) and therefore the effect of individual strategies within a multi-faceted intervention is usually less able to be determined ( Cameron et al., 2016 ). Despite this, a systematic review found that single and multi-strategy interventions share the same high success rate (70%) ( Cameron et al., 2016 ). Inclusion of a whole category rather than individual products within a category was also a distinctive feature of this study. However, the findings suggest that shelf placement alone (in the absence of other strategies) is a weak lever for influencing the healthiness of shopper purchases in the breakfast cereal category.
Secondly, there was no effect of the shelf placement intervention on the nutritional composition of sales within the breakfast cereal category. This intervention was implemented in a ‘real world’ supermarket setting. Therefore, the nutritional ranking of breakfast cereals by cereal category segment (by researchers) was subject to the usual supermarket space management criteria for shelf placement. These included segmentation (e.g. all oats grouped together), brand blocking (brands located together), pack size blocking (similar sized packages located together) and visual appeal of products on shelves that aim to make product selection easy for shoppers. These requirements and that just over half (56%) of the products did not change position resulted in relatively small differences in the nutritional composition of products located in prominent versus non-prominent shelf locations, which are likely reasons for the lack of effect on nutrient sales. Interviews with store staff supported the notion that space management criteria compromised the ideal placement of products. Furthermore, the range of nutrient composition values (e.g. energy) was narrow for some smaller segments, e.g. biscuits (n = 12).
Thirdly, in-store product display promotions appear to have interacted with the shelf placement intervention. There were multiple breakfast cereals on in-store displays across all six stores (n = 1268), with a slightly higher proportion in intervention stores (54%) and a higher proportion of less healthy, less prominent products compared to control stores. Per store, there were 19 breakfast cereals (includes flavour variants of products) each week in aggregated displays (4–6 actual display areas per store featuring multiple products and product variants) (data was collected at one time point each week). Store managers are provided with guidance from a national display matrix, which provides product promotional options within a category/segment for each designated display space. When products are on promotion the entire brand range may be included (healthy and less healthy). It is possible that at the time of the audit the healthier choices had already sold out on displays and gaps were filled by other, less healthy products in the range. It is also plausible that the higher number of promotions for less healthy products in intervention stores may have been orchestrated by store personnel (consciously or unconsciously) to feature higher selling, more profitable products, that had been moved to less prominent shelf positions, and thus counteracted shelf prominence of healthier products. Data on in-store promotions were not collected in the pre- or post-intervention periods therefore change in the type of promotions over time could not be determined.
The lack of effect of prominent placement on product sales shown in our study generally aligns with findings from Foster et al. (2014) who suggested that brand loyalty and product preferences may be dominant in this particular category. Brand loyalty in the breakfast cereal category also emerged as a strong theme from our shopper survey, with shoppers commenting that they tended to purchase the same brand repeatedly. Similarly, strong shopper preferences and habitual purchase behaviours were found in an experiment examining the effects of a change of placement for types of bread ( de Wijk et al., 2016 ). The bread category was described as less able to be ‘nudged’ because a nudge needs to be of sufficient strength to overrule usual purchase habits. Other mechanisms in the environment can also influence habitual health behaviours and consumer choices ( Wilson et al., 2016 ), for example, product price, nutrition labelling/information and availability ( Arno and Thomas, 2016 ). Price was another key factor that shoppers highlighted in our current study as influencing product choice, although brands with high loyalty tend to use price less to generate sales compared to minor brands ( Empen et al., 2011 ).
This study had several strengths. It utilised co-design to enhance the likely fiscal sustainability of the intervention. This process allowed a strong working relationship to be built with the retail partner, which facilitated intervention delivery, access to sales and promotional data, and possible future research opportunities. Intervention selection was informed by commercial knowledge and not preconceived by researchers. A single strategy, more prominent shelf placement of healthier products within an entire food category, was piloted in a real-world environment using a controlled study design to determine potential effectiveness. Inclusion of pre-intervention and follow-up periods allowed measurement of change over time. Supermarket sales data was used as a direct measure of change in shopper purchases to determine the effect of the intervention rather than reliance on self-reported purchases ( Bandy et al., 2019 ). Weekly product auditing and retailer follow-up of anomalies resulted in high intervention compliance.
The study was however, limited by its small sample size (6 stores) and lack of randomisation. Although, it has been acknowledged that randomisation in supermarket intervention design is difficult due to the innate nature of real-life implementation ( Escaron et al., 2013 ). The original aim was to pilot the intervention in a limited number of stores with the intention that if findings were promising, a larger sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial would be conducted. However, our experience working alongside a major retailer suggests that successful interventions would likely be rolled out to a larger number of stores very quickly, with little time for a larger randomised controlled study to be organised. Other limitations to note briefly include lack of alignment of the intervention with other concomitant breakfast cereal promotions (price reductions, mailers, and in-store displays), lower compliance with product planograms in control stores, selection of a category where customer brand loyalty and purchase habits are strong which likely minimised potential impact, and relatively small difference in the healthiness of prominent and less prominent products. More research is needed to understand the effects of the range of in-store promotions, including price, on sales within the supermarket environment. Other categories where shoppers do not purchase the same products habitually may also have been more suited to testing shelf placement, for example, convenience foods, ready meals or soups.

Section: 5. Conclusions

This study shows that it is feasible to co-design a healthy eating intervention with a commercial retailer, but concurrent retail environment factors and strong shopper preferences in the category, likely limited the public health impact of the shelf placement intervention. Future studies can build on evidence from this study when trying to alter food environments outside the research setting. Important considerations within the retail environment, including space management logistics and in-store promotions, should be aligned with interventions designed to improve the healthiness of shopper purchases, in order to support and augment intervention effectiveness. Future research should investigate the effect of altering in-store promotions on consumer purchases.
