Title: Intersectional inequalities in mental health across multiple dimensions of inequality in the Swedish adult population


Abstract: Abstract

Intersectionality has recently gained traction in health inequality research emphasizing multiple intersecting dimensions of inequality as opposed to the traditional unidimensional approaches. In this study inequalities in mental health were estimated across intersections of gender, income, education, occupation, country of birth, and sexual orientation. The outcomes and inequalities of intersectional strata were disentangled analogously to the possibilities described by intersectionality theory; as a result of either of the two inequality dimensions, as a result of the sum the dimensions, or as a unique outcome not equaling the sum. Furthermore the study examined the discriminatory accuracy of the six inequality dimensions as well as the intersectional space comprising 64 strata. The study population (N = 52,743) consists of a yearly random sample of the Swedish population 26–84 years between 2010 and 2015, from The Health on Equal Terms survey. Mental health was measured through a self-administered General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12, and sociodemographics through survey and linked register data. Intersectional inequalities in mental health were estimated for all pairwise combinations of inequality dimensions by joint inequalities, excess intersectional inequalities and referent inequalities. The findings of the study found that the sum of dimensions contributed to the overall (joint) inequality in mental health rather than a reinforced adverse effect of multiple disadvantages or the contribution by a single dimension. Nevertheless, the dimension of income was found to be the most important in terms of relative contribution. The discriminatory accuracy was low indicating that policy action targeting mental health should be universal rather than focusing on particular groups. The results highlight the unpredictable inequality patterns revealed by an intersectional approach, even for a single health outcome and within one country, and illustrate the need for empirical investigations into the actual population patterns in health that appear in the intersections of multiple disadvantages.

Section: 1. Introduction

A global commitment to reduce health inequalities has been affirmed and proclaimed through declarations and agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ( United Nations, 2015 ), the 2009 World Health Assembly Resolution ( World Health Organization, 2009 ), and the Health For All strategy ( World Health Organization, 1981 ), and remains an ongoing struggle. Poor mental health is a globally ubiquitous public health problem that has been shown to be unequally distributed across a wide range of inequality dimensions, e.g., between men and women ( World Health Organization, 2013 ), sexual minorities and majorities ( Plöderl and Tremblay, 2015 ), socioeconomic groups ( Freeman et al., 2016 ; Reiss, 2013 ; Weinberger et al., 2018 ), and ethnic/racial groups ( Weinberger et al., 2018 ). However, even though inequalities in health often are measured and approached through one dimension of inequality at a time (such as gender), social identities and structures do not exist merely in parallel, independent of each other. Gender inequality, for example, is multidimensional and encompasses biological, cultural, economic, and environmental factors , but is at the same time enmeshed in other power structures, such as class, age, ethnicity, and sexuality. This complexity has paved the way for intersectionality as a new research paradigm gaining traction in health inequality research ( Bates et al., 2009 ; Bauer, 2014 ; M. A. Green et al., 2017 ; Kapilashrami and Hankivsky, 2018 , Merlo, 2018 ).
The concept of intersectionality was originally proposed to break the deadlock experienced by marginalized groups caught between dominant discourses disempowering their specific experiences, as for example black women caught between the “white” narrative of feminism and the “male” narrative of antiracism ( Crenshaw, 1991 ). It was presented as an analytical framework to disentangle the different forms of discrimination that an individual could experience at the intersection of discrimination flowing from multiple possible directions, e.g. that a black woman could experience discrimination due to 1) being a woman or being black; 2) the sum of being a woman and being black; or 3) the unique position of being a black woman, i. e not equaling the sum ( Crenshaw, 1989 ).
However, the idea of intersectionality has been developed, conceptualized and operationalized differently across ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies, making it difficult to articulate as a clear-cut and coherent concept. It also makes the issue of terminology complicated, for example in the interchange between quantitative and qualitative research ( Bauer, 2014 ; Hancock, 2007 ). In population health research, intersectionality is often used to emphasize the importance of considering multiple dimensions of power simultaneously when analyzing the distribution of health outcomes in order to capture their interacting effect on health opportunities and outcomes ( Bowleg, 2012 ). In this study, intersectionality is used to make what Bauer (2014) calls a socio-demographic mapping of the distribution of health and disease across intersectional strata (groups at cross-stratified intersections). The term intersectional space will be used to specifically denote the set of intersectional strata under consideration in a given situation, across which complex population patterns of health may arise. Thus, an intersectional space comprises a number of intersectional strata.
Intersectionality in general, challenges broad dualist categorizations, such as ‘women/men’ or ‘black/white’, which otherwise may reinforce and stabilize these social constructs ( Gunnarsson, 2017 ). There are also public health justifications for why such homogenous categories should be avoided. Researchers have e.g. pointed to the risk of obscuring health inequalities and that groups in greatest need may remain unnoticed ( Gkiouleka et al., 2018 ; Hankivsky, 2012 ; Merlo et al., 2017 ). Moreover, little guidance is given concerning the domains, contexts, and processes in which the causes of inequalities can be targeted when individuals with widely different life experiences and outcomes are collapsed into the same category ( Kapilashrami et al., 2015 ); e.g., when an immigrant working-class woman and a non-immigrant upper-class woman are seen as equivalent by both being constructed as ‘woman’. A key tenet of intersectionality is therefore to turn the focus to such disparate experiences and outcomes.
There is little universal conformity in how intersectionality research deals with the complexity of social identities and/or power structures. Three main approaches have been described in a widely cited article by McCall (2005) : the intracategorical, the intercategorical and the anticategorical, which differ in their ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions. The intercategorical approach is proposed by McCall for quantitatively exploring intersectional inequalities while the other two approaches are rooted in the qualitative tradition of inquiry. The intercategorical approach is based on categories like gender, race, and ethnicity yet recognizing them as socially constructed ( McCall, 2005 ). It focuses on the relationship or intersections between social groups and the (e.g., health) consequences of belonging to a complex social group. The categories employed to define the complex groups are used as “anchor points” rather than individual risk factors with an inherent explanatory value.
Empirical examples of intercategorical intersectionality research exist for a range of health-related outcomes, such as self-rated health ( Hinze et al., 2012 ; Veenstra, 2011 ), discrimination ( Veenstra, 2012 ), HIV ( Longman Marcellin et al., 2013 ), smoking ( Amroussia et al., 2020 ) and health care utilization ( Nyamande et al., 2020 ). The intercategorical approach has been applied mainly in two ways within quantitative health research ( Bauer and Scheim, 2019 ). The first involves stratified cross-coded categories representing intersections across multiple strata and analysis of outcomes by intersectional strata. The second involves a method described by Jackson et al. (2016) , in which the inequality between a doubly privileged position according to social hierarchies (e.g., high-income men) and a doubly disadvantaged position (e.g., low-income women) is estimated. The inequality is subsequently decomposed into its constituents consisting of the contribution of the single dimensions (e.g., the inequality attributed to income differences among men only) and the contribution of the simultaneously experienced disadvantage (i.e., the inequality that exceeds the sum of the single inequalities). This approach thus disentangles the outcomes and inequalities of intersectional strata analogously to the possibilities described by Crenshaw (1989) ; as a result of either of the two inequality dimensions, as a result of the sum the dimensions, or as a unique outcome not equaling the sum.
The topic of methodological approaches for intersectional analyses is under development, and even more recently proposed approaches include, for example, methods focusing on individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy ( Evans et al., 2018 ; Merlo, 2018 ). These methods encompass both multi- and single-level analysis, and have been applied on e.g. ischemic heart disease ( Wemrell et al., 2017 ), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2018 ), opioid dispensations ( Persmark et al., 2019 ) intimate partner violence ( Ivert et al., 2020 ), smoking ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2021 ), antidepressant use ( Ljungman et al., 2021 ), depressive symptoms ( Evans and Erickson, 2019 ) and self-rated health ( Wemrell et al., 2021 ). A measure of discriminatory accuracy provides information about the proportion of variation in individual health between strata averages and thus also information about how well the defined strata distinguish individuals with bad health from individuals with good health. Since a low discriminatory accuracy can be used as a quantitative argument in the deconstruction of irrelevant categories it has also been construed as a quantitative implementation of an anticategorical approach ( Wemrell et al., 2017 ; Merlo, 2018 ), even though this formulation differs from the original description by McCall (2005) . Nevertheless, additional information about the discriminatory accuracy may prevent unnecessary stigmatization of groups defined by irrelevant identity categories (i.e. with a low discriminatory accuracy).
Conventional analysis of health inequalities is based on the assumption that the effect of multiple disadvantages on health can be understood through a unidimensional approach. This assumption is challenged by the multiple jeopardy hypothesis ( Grollman, 2014 ), which is a specific conceptualization of intersectionality as the interaction effect of multiple disadvantages, and which can be empirically tested through statistical interaction analyses. This hypothesis relates to the third form of discrimination described by Crenshaw (1989) and is an implicit or explicit point of departure for most intercategorical intersectional research in public health. In a recent scoping review of the literature on intercategorical inequalities in mental health ( Fagrell Trygg et al., 2019 ), it was found that the most common analytical approach indeed was to estimate interaction effects, corresponding to an operationalization of the multiple jeopardy hypothesis. The review identified one individual study providing support of the hypothesis in the form of positive (synergistic) interaction effects ( Ross and Mirowski, 2006 ), while other studies provided less convincing support, e.g., non-significant results ( Green and Benzeval, 2011 ; Schieman, 2002 ), and with some even reporting negative (antagonistic) interaction effects ( Garratt, 2016 ; Hardeman, 2015 ; Mair, 2010 ). Overall, these results suggest a disparate support for the multiple jeopardy hypothesis with respect to mental health in the adult population.
Antagonistic interaction effects, signifying that a doubly disadvantaged group displays more favorable health than expected given the double disadvantage, could be said to reveal a form of incongruent patterns of health. Different explanations to such incongruent health patterns have been suggested in the literature. For example, Lundberg et al. (2009) found that processes of shame have a stronger association with mental health among those with manual occupations and high education, and Rosenfield (2012) suggests that schemas of self-salience construct alternative subjective status hierarchies within subgroups that can be both protective and destructive for mental health. Incongruent patterns in other health outcomes, such as smoking ( Amroussia et al., 2020 ), have also been observed. Veenstra (2011) argues that such findings contradict or even refute the multiple jeopardy hypothesis and proposes complementary theories, such as intersectional invisibility theory ( Purdie-Vaughns and Eibach, 2008 ) and the subordinate male target hypothesis ( Navarrete et al., 2010 ), to explain why multiple disadvantages can have antagonistic effects on outcomes such as health.
Studies of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy also estimate the statistical interaction effect of the different strata explored ( Merlo, 2018 ). For example, in a recent study on the distribution of smoking in Sweden in the intersectional space of age, gender, educational achievement, migration status and household composition, there was no substantial interaction effect as expressed in the discriminatory accuracy ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2021 ). Similar results were obtained in a study about self-rated health in Sweden in the intersectional space of gender, household income and immigration status ( Wemrell et al., 2021 ), a study on antidepressant use in Sweden, across age, gender, income, country of birth and psychiatric diagnosis ( Ljungman et al., 2021 ) and a study on depressive symptoms across gender, race and ethnicity among adolescents and young adults in the U.S. ( Evans and Erickson, 2019 ). In the studies about smoking, self-rated health and depressive symptoms the discriminatory accuracy was found to be low, suggesting that the sociodemographic categories used in the specific studies did not discriminate individuals with good health from those with poor health very well ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2021 ; Wemrell et al., 2021 , Evans and Erickson, 2019 ). In the study on antidepressant use it was however found to be large, suggesting that interventions could be targeted to the groups with the highest use of antidepressants ( Ljungman et al., 2021 ). Together, these studies illustrate the value of doing detailed intersectional mappings of the distribution of health outcomes and the importance of estimating the discriminatory accuracy of the sociodemographic categories and their intersectional combinations in order to develop effective policy response. However, no similar studies have been done on a Swedish sample using a mental health outcome. Overall, published empirical studies from Sweden on intersectional inequalities in mental health are few. Wamala et al. (2009) studied the intersectional space of country of birth, income, and gender, and their results support the idea that multiple disadvantages translate into the highest health risk but without an apparent reinforcing effect. Lundberg et al. (2009) found intersectional positions reflecting incongruent patterns in mental health, in which the singly disadvantaged individuals with high education and a manual occupation had the highest prevalence of depressive symptoms, while individuals with low education and a non-manual occupation had the lowest prevalence. Gustafsson et al. (2016) , who studied middle groups, i.e., those with both an advantage and a disadvantage, found no evidence of interaction effects on mental health in the intersectional space of gender and income. They interpreted their findings with the concept of leveraging, a concept proposed and developed by Sen and Iyer (2012) in order to redirect focus from positionality to processes. The processes of leveraging involve applying the structural advantages along one axis of inequality (e.g., high income) to compensate for structural disadvantages along another axis (e.g., being a woman) and thereby gain a secondary advantage, e.g., better health or access to health care , in competition for resources that can occur both directly and indirectly. The results from the study by Gustafsson et al. (2016) suggest that the middle groups—women with high or middle income and men with middle and low income—could use resources tied to their position to leverage their mental health.
As the study by Gustafsson et al. (2016) illustrates, intersectionality is not only useful when analyzing the relationship between intersectional groups but is also valuable when assessing the importance of single inequality dimensions in an intersectional space for a given outcome in a given context, corresponding to the first possibility suggested by Crenshaw (1989) . Such analyses have, for example, identified a dominant and invariant role for the dimension of gender in relation to education in a study on intersectional inequalities in health care utilization in Sweden ( Nyamande et al., 2020 ), and a varying importance for education with respect to mental health in the intersectional spaces of gender, race, and education was identified in a U.S. study on intersectional inequalities in major depressive episodes ( Assari, 2017 ). In summary, the health effect of interrelated dimensions of inequality can be formulated by different theories offering contrasting conclusions and interpretations, with challenges posed to the dominant multiple jeopardy hypothesis. This highlights the need for investigating a multitude of intersectional spaces to provide an empirical foundation against which the multiple jeopardy hypothesis can be understood. Furthermore, incongruent intersectional patterns and the relative importance of certain inequality dimensions are other interesting aspects of intersectional inequalities in mental health that deserve further study.
The overall aim of the study was to estimate complex inequalities in mental health across intersections of gender, income, education, occupation, country of birth, and sexual orientation in the Swedish adult population. Specifically, the aim was to answer the following research questions: 1. Is the hypothesis of multiple jeopardy universally supported across different intersectional spaces? 2. Are there any intersectional positions reflecting incongruence in mental health? 3. Is any single dimension more important for inequalities in mental health across intersectional spaces? 4. Do the considered dimensions of inequality and the entire intersectional space discriminate between good and poor mental health?

Section: 2. Method

The study population consisted of a yearly random sample of the Swedish population 16–84 years old between 2010 and 2015. Data were acquired through the Health on Equal Terms (HET) cross-sectional population-based survey. The response rate varied between 47 and 60%, amounting to annual samples of N = 6,000–12,000. Participants completed comprehensive questionnaires about health, health behaviors, health care utilization , and psychosocial and material conditions. The survey data have been linked to individual-level register data from the total population registers of Statistics Sweden, concerning sociodemographic conditions, such as income, country of origin, family structure, and municipality or county of residence. When responses from all six years were pooled, the resulting effective sample size was N = 52,743. The study proposal was reviewed and approved by the Regional Ethical Board in Umeå (approval no. 2017/114–31).
Poor mental health was measured through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 ( Goldberg, 2000 ), a commonly used 12-item screening instrument for mental health symptoms. It has been evaluated and found to have good psychometric properties in the Swedish setting ( Lundin et al., 2016 , 2017 ) and has earlier been shown to display inequalities in Sweden across several inequality dimensions ( Amroussia et al., 2017 ; Gustafsson et al., 2016 , Gustafsson et al., 2017 ). The questionnaire consists of 12 questions with Likert coded responses [1, 2, 3, 4] that cover a range of symptoms, such as lack of concentration and feeling unhappy and depressed. The score across all items were summed up, and a total score of 12 was used as the cut-off point to indicate poor mental health, in line with a validation study in the general population of Sweden ( Lundin et al., 2016 ).
Six dimensions of inequality were dichotomized as follows: gender (woman; man); socioeconomic status by disposable income (<median; ≥ median), educational level (<3 years of high school; ≥ 3 years of high school) and by present, or if not employed, the latest, occupation (manual workers; non-manual workers and self-employed); country of birth (other; Sweden and Nordic countries); and sexual orientation (homosexual/bisexual/not sure sexual orientation; heterosexual). These groups were then further labelled according to social status. Positions held by women, those earning less than the median disposable income, those having less than 3 years of high school, those born outside a Nordic country, and those who were non-heterosexual were regarded as having a relative overall social disadvantage compared to their counterparts, who were regarded as having a relative overall social advantage.
Based on the six binary dimensions of inequality, all 15 possible bivariate combinations were considered as exposure variables in independent analyses, and thus represent the specific intersectional spaces investigated. By cross-classifying each pair of dimensions of inequality at the time, four mutually exclusive intersectional positions were obtained for each combination representing social positions of double privilege, two positions of mixed privilege and disadvantage, and double disadvantage.
In order to describe the overall distribution of poor mental health, the prevalence (absolute risk) across the 15 intersectional spaces were estimated. In addition, the prevalence was estimated for all 64 intersectional strata as well as the prevalence difference (absolute risk difference), with the most privileged intersectional position as the reference.
Complex inequalities in health were estimated by applying the approach described by Jackson et al. (2016) , which corresponds to the intercategorical approach described by McCall (2005) . The approach estimates four inequalities in health on an additive scale, the joint intersectional inequality, which in turn can be decomposed into the sum of three component inequalities, comprising two referent inequalities, and the excess intersectional inequality as follows:
Joint = Referent 1 + Referent 2 + Excess.
The most privileged social group (double privilege) works as the point of reference, and the health difference is thus supposed to reflect the absolute gains in health if the inequality were eliminated. The joint intersectional inequality is the mean difference in health between the doubly privileged and the doubly disadvantaged group. The referent inequality is the mean difference in health between a middle group and the most privileged. The excess intersectional inequality is calculated by subtracting the two referent inequalities from the joint intersectional inequality, thus representing the supra-additive portion of the joint inequality, equivalent to an additive interaction effect. The excess intersectional inequality can be interpreted as the extent to which the joint inequality is greater (or smaller) than what would be expected had one treated the referent inequalities as separate instead of interlocking.
The joint intersectional inequality and the referent inequalities were estimated by linear binomial regression models, with excess intersectional inequality yielded by post-estimation. All inequalities are reported as percentage points (pp) and a 95% confidence interval (CI), and referent and excess inequality are also represented as a fraction of joint inequality (%).
The first and second research questions were answered by assessing the excess intersectional inequality across the 15 intersectional spaces, with age and survey year included as covariates. Specifically, a significant positive excess intersectional inequality, indicating a synergistic effect, would support the hypothesis of multiple jeopardy (first research question). Conversely, a negative excess intersectional inequality, indicating an antagonistic effect, would correspond to positive support for intersectional positions reflecting incongruence in mental health (second research question). The third research question, whether any single dimension is more important for inequalities in mental health across intersectional spaces, was answered by assessing the relative contributions of the referent inequalities to the joint inequalities across the studied intersectional spaces.
The fourth research question concerning the discriminatory accuracy was estimated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU-ROC) based on a logistic regression model ( Pepe et al., 2004 ). The AU-ROC provides a value between 0.5 and 1, where 1 indicates that the variables in the model perfectly discriminates individuals with poor mental health from those with good mental health. To interpret the numbers, the classification by Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000) was used in which the discriminatory accuracy is absent or very small when AU-ROC = 0.5–0.6; small when AU-ROC = 0.6–0.7; large when AU-ROC = 0.7–0.8; and very large when AU-ROC>0.8. Following a similar procedure as previous studies on the same material ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2021 ; Wemrell et al., 2021 ), three models were used; a basic model for GHQ-12 adjusted for only age and survey year, a second model with the six binary dimensions of inequality added, and a third model in which all intersectional 64 strata included as one variable, with the most privileged stratum used as a reference. All analyses were performed in STATA 14.0.

Section: 3. Results

The total analytical sample of respondents (N = 52,743) was evenly distributed over the survey years ( Table 1 ). The lowest proportion of respondents was found in the oldest (10%) and the youngest (13%) age groups and non-heterosexuals (4%). The sample had a higher proportion of respondents with high socioeconomic position and slightly more women than men. The distribution of poor mental health followed a traditional social pattern, with a higher proportion among individuals with low socioeconomic position, among women, foreign-born and non-heterosexuals.

The overall prevalence of poor mental health was 24%. It was highest among individuals with non-heterosexual orientation (34%), followed by individuals born outside a Nordic country (32%), and lowest among individuals with high income (21%), followed by non-manual workers and self-employed individuals (22%). From the same table, it is also possible to observe the simple (unadjusted) inequalities in the sample. For example, the inequality between men and women was 6 pp, it was 9 pp between those with high and low income and 10 pp between heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals.
Concerning the distribution of mental health across the 15 intersectional spaces ( Table 2 ), the doubly disadvantaged stratum most often had the highest prevalence of mental health symptoms, and the doubly privileged stratum had the lowest prevalence. For example, in the intersectional space of income and sexual orientation, the doubly disadvantaged with low income and non-heterosexual orientation displayed double the prevalence of mental health (40%) compared to the doubly privileged with high income and heterosexual orientation (18%). However, there were exceptions. In the intersectional space of education and occupation, the doubly disadvantaged with low education and a manual occupation did not present the highest prevalence (26%), but the singly disadvantaged with high education and a manual occupation (29%) did. Similarly, in the space of sexual orientation and education, the singly disadvantaged stratum with high education and non-heterosexual orientation had the higher prevalence (36%). Furthermore, the doubly disadvantaged with low income and low education presented the same prevalence (30%) as the singly disadvantaged with low income and high education (30%). Similarly, the doubly privileged with high income and high education had the same prevalence (21%) as the singly disadvantaged with high income and low education (21%). Table 2 .

Across the full matrix of 64 strata ( Appendix A ) the prevalence was 21% (n = 7,930) in the most socially privileged strata, and 43% (n = 47) in the most socially disadvantaged strata. The lowest prevalence was however found among men with the social privileges of high income and high education but with the social disadvantages of being born outside the Nordic countries, with manual occupation and being non-heterosexual (13%, n = 26), while the highest was found among women with the social disadvantages of low income and low education, being born outside the Nordic countries and being non-heterosexual but with the social privilege of a non-manual occupation (67%, n = 5).
The joint intersectional inequalities, i.e. the prevalence difference between the doubly privileged and the doubly disadvantaged ( Table 3 ), were all larger than the simple inequalities ( Table 1 ). The largest joint intersectional inequality was found in the intersectional space of income and sexual orientation and was estimated at a 20 pp difference (CI: 17–23 pp), with another large inequality being observed in the intersectional space of income and country of birth (18 pp, CI: 16–19 pp). For gender and sexual orientation, the joint intersectional inequality was 16 pp (CI: 13–20 pp), which can be contrasted with the simple inequalities of gender (6 pp) and sexual orientation (10 pp). The smallest joint intersectional inequality was found for education and occupation (5 pp, CI: 4–6 pp), which can be compared to the simple inequalities of occupation (5 pp) and education (2 pp). The prevalence differences across the full matrix of 64 strata provides further detail and are reported in appendix A . For example, it shows that the prevalence in the group of men with high income and high education, born outside the Nordic countries with manual occupation and non-heterosexual orientation had 8pp lower prevalence than the reference group (most privileged).

With respect to the first and second research questions, the excess intersectional inequality was non-significant for the great majority (11/15) of the intersectional spaces studied, and all were of small absolute magnitude (2pp or smaller). Regarding the first research question, the only instance of significant synergistic effect was found in the intersectional space of income and sexual orientation (5 pp, CI: 1–9 pp, corresponding to 25% of the joint inequality). With respect to the second research question, there were three instances of antagonistic effects. The largest were found in the intersectional spaces of education and sexual orientation (−5 pp, CI: 10–1 pp) and education and occupation (-3pp, CI: 5‒-1 pp), both of which, while of small-to-moderate size, accounted for a considerable portion of the corresponding joint inequalities (−55% and −49%, respectively). The final negative excess intersectional inequality was found in the space of gender and income, and was both small in absolute terms and in proportion of the join inequality (-2pp, CI: 3‒-1 pp, −17%).
With respect to the third research question, the overall pattern showed that in most intersectional spaces studied one of the two referent inequalities was dominant, i.e., contributed more to the joint inequality than the other. There was one exception to this overall pattern—the fairly equal contribution of the referent inequalities in the intersectional space of gender and occupation (47% and 43%, respectively). Another overall pattern observed was that the relative contribution of the referent inequality for each inequality dimension varied from one intersectional space to another. One exception was the income referent inequality, which was dominant in all five intersectional spaces where income was considered ( Table 3 ), and the sexual orientation referent inequality was also dominant in four out of five intersectional spaces. In contrast, education consistently contributed less to the overall joint intersectional inequality than its counterpart in all intersectional spaces that considered education. For example, in the intersectional space of income and sexual orientation, the income referent inequality contributed with 50%, and the sexual orientation referent inequality with 24%, and in the intersectional space of education and sexual orientation, the education referent inequality contributed with 37%, compared to the 118% accounted for by the sexual orientation referent inequality.
The AU-ROC of the first model, only including age and survey year, was estimated at 0.592 (CI: 0.585–0.598). It slightly increased when the six dimensions of inequality were added in the second model (AU-ROC = 0.625, CI: 0.618–0.633) but only marginally increased when the intersectional variable of all 64 strata was added in the third model (AU-ROC = 0.630, CI: 0.622–0.637).

Section: 4. Discussion

This study estimated inequalities in mental health in the Swedish adult population across intersections of gender, income, education, occupation, country of birth, and sexual orientation as well as the discriminatory accuracy of the intersectional groups. Intersectionality was operationalized in terms of joint intersectional inequality, referent inequality, and excess intersectional inequality; as well as examination of discriminatory accuracy across all 64 intersectional strata. Overall, the findings display interesting patterns across the intersectional spaces explored but don't support the multiple jeopardy hypothesis and the discriminatory accuracy was small.
Regarding the first research question, this study contradicts the universality of the multiple jeopardy hypothesis across a range of intersectional spaces in the context of mental health in Sweden. Specifically, the excess intersectional inequality was mostly non-significant and demonstrated inconsistent directionality; only one out of fifteen intersectional spaces—income and sexual orientation—was found to be significant and positive in accord with the multiple jeopardy hypothesis. Even though the multiple jeopardy hypothesis in health has been criticized due to contradictory empirical findings ( Veenstra, 2011 ), the notion of inequality dimensions as cross-classified rather than independent is a common feature of intersectionality informed quantitative population health research ( Bowleg, 2012 ; Bauer, 2014 ). The hypothesis has indeed gained empirical support in other contexts and for other outcomes (M. J. Green and Benzeval, 2011 ; Ross and Mirowsky, 2006 ; Schieman, 2002 ), although conclusions in favor of the hypothesis are not always based on convincing empirical findings, e.g., with non-significant results interpreted as supporting the hypothesis (M. J. Green and Benzeval, 2011 ; Hinze et al., 2012 ; Schieman, 2002 ). The weak empirical support in the present study, while constrained to a single country and health outcome, is therefore surprising, particularly given the broad range of intersectional spaces investigated. The same inconsistent patterns were, however, observed in a recent scoping review of the international literature on intersectional inequalities in mental health ( Fagrell Trygg et al., 2019 ). We understand this as even though overarching societal power structures can be argued to have remained relatively stable at least in modern times, the complex sociomaterial processes they co-create can be expected to materialize as population patterns of health in unpredictable and unstable ways. The results point toward the importance of measuring and monitoring intersectional inequalities in the first place but also towards the importance of building responsive processes that allow policymaking, planning, and priority setting to continuously adapt to current patterns and conditions. Such processes cannot be based on fixed assumptions but on continuous monitoring that explores, as McCall suggests, “whether meaningful inequalities among groups even exist in the first place” (2005, p. 1785). Furthermore, it should be noted that a weak support for the multiple jeopardy hypothesis should not be interpreted as a weak support for intersectionality as a useful analytical framework since it only corresponds to one of the three forms of discrimination that a more comprehensive intersectional analysis explores ( Crenshaw, 1989 ). Moreover, the distribution of mental health across intersectional spaces is an important input to policy and practice no matter if the harmful circumstances can be connected to dimensions of inequality one by one, their sum, or their interaction.
Regarding the second research question, we found incongruent mental health inequalities for three intersectional spaces. These incongruences were found in the intersectional spaces of gender and income, education and sexual orientation, and the space of education and occupation, for which the excess intersectional inequality was significantly negative. Previous studies on intersectional inequalities in mental health have also found incongruences ( Garratt, 2016 ; Hardeman, 2015 ; Lundberg et al., 2009 ; Mair, 2010 ; Rosenfield, 2012 , Evans and Erickson, 2019 ) as well as previous studies on other outcomes, such as musculoskeletal disorders and severe acute physical symptoms ( Wamala et al., 2009 ), tobacco use ( Amroussia et al., 2020 ), and self-rated health ( Wamala et al., 2009 ; Veenstra, 2011 , 2012 ). Taken together, these results imply that the underlying processes that either promote or hamper mental health are very specific and contextual and therefore likely to be most successfully targeted through bottom-up approaches that can cater to these unstable and complex specificities.
Regarding the third research question, the dimension of income and, to a lesser degree, sexual orientation were found to be more important than other dimensions. In contrast, the dimension of education contributed relatively little and was never dominant in any intersectional space. By applying the concept of leveraging ( Sen and Iyer, 2012 ), the results could be interpreted as if high income in particular enacts an intersectional space in which resources can be used to successfully compete or compensate, thus resulting in better mental health. Our findings suggest that education does not work as a leverage in this particular population and for this particular health outcome. In contrast, a U.S. study of tobacco use found that education contributed more to the joint intersectional inequality than sexual orientation with regard to tobacco use ( Amroussia et al., 2020 ). Another interesting observation from a study on the intersections of race, gender, and socioeconomic status and the risk of major depressive episodes in an American adult population ( Assari, 2017 ) adds to this complex dynamic. The study showed that income and education played different roles across intersectional positions, e.g., high income was found to be particularly protective for white women, while it was a risk factor for African American men, and education was found to be protective for African American women. Taken together, these findings imply that context-specific processes of compensation and competition, as formulated by the concept of leveraging, deserve further analysis but also that certain dimensions of inequality may be considered as general drivers of inequality across multiple intersectional spaces and thus indicate suitable targets for intervention.
Regarding the discriminatory accuracy, the dimensions of inequality made a very small contribution beyond age and survey year in discriminating between individuals with good mental health from individuals with poor mental health. Adding the full cross-classification of the dimensions led to an insubstantial improvement, indicating the absence of an interaction effect. This means that approaches aiming at improving the mental health in specific groups with high prevalence may have a limited effect due to the large overlap between the groups. Instead, policy and action on mental health may be more effective if targeting the population as a whole.
The results are similar to most other studies based on the same survey ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2021 ; Wemrell et al., 2021 ) and also similar to a study based on a U.S. sample of adolescents and young adults ( Evans and Erickson, 2019 ) in which the sociodemographic categories made small contribution to the discriminatory accuracy and the intersectional interaction was negligible. When exploring the distribution of antidepressant use based on Swedish register data, a larger discriminatory accuracy (AU-ROC = 0.81) was however found in the intersectional space of income, gender, country of birth and age. Nevertheless, it is difficult to compare these studies to the present studies since they all analyze different outcomes, intersectional spaces and because age, a strong health determinant, sometimes is used as a covariate ( Wemrell et al., 2021 ; Evans and Erickson, 2019 ) and sometimes as a dimension of inequality ( Axelsson Fisk et al., 2021 ; Ljungman et al., 2021 ).

Section: 5. Methodological considerations

Even though the generalizability of the result is considered strong due to the random sampling from the total adult Swedish population, the risk of selection bias is important to acknowledge when interpreting the results of this study. The study had a response rate around 50% (47.0–60.1%) of those invited to participate. Previous analysis of the non-respondents has shown that men, young people, or individuals with low education, unmarried or born outside Sweden are underrepresented among participants ( Statistiska Centralbyrån, 2015 ). Given the moderate response rate and that the non-respondents belong to both the privileged (men) and disadvantaged (e.g., low educational attainment) analytical categories used in this study, the estimated inequalities reported may be either under- or overestimations.
The outcome measure, GHQ-12, is an established mental health instrument that has been validated for Swedish populations ( Lundin et al., 2016 , 2017 ). The dimensions of inequality were also all defined according to well-established measures. However, they were dichotomized to fit the method of analysis, which meant a reduction of potentially important information, e.g., for income. One argument for using intersectionality is that it offers a higher degree of differentiation within social groups. Even though this study provides some degree of such differentiation by combining groups, the analytical approach ( Jackson et al., 2016 ) is restrictive when it comes to the range and number of inequality dimensions to be considered in the analysis. However, it provides a mid-level of detail analysis and synthesis by estimating the desirable additive interactions, readily presented in the forms of familiar absolute risk differences, and corresponds to tenets of intersectionality ( Crenshaw, 1989 ). It does however, by itself, yield a relatively fragmented presentation of analysis as each bivariate intersectional space is examined separately. In this study, these methodological weaknesses were balanced with an estimation of the AUC as well as the detailed strata-level estimates of the entire intersectional space. It should be noted that the AUC procedure used identifies multiplicative-interactions, which differs from the additive-scale interaction identified by the excess intersectional inequality.

Section: 6. Conclusions

Overall, the findings of this study found very sparse evidence for a reinforced adverse effect of multiple disadvantages on mental health across a broad range of intersectional spaces among Swedish adults, thus challenging the universality of the multiple jeopardy hypothesis. Patterns of incongruent mental health were found more frequently but with the evidence instead favoring that the sum of dimensions contributed to the overall (joint) inequality. In addition, income was found to be more important than other dimensions, contributing more to the overall intersectional inequalities as opposed to education, which showed a relatively small contribution across intersectional spaces. Finally, the low discriminatory accuracy observed indicate that policy action targeting mental health should be universal rather than focusing on particular groups.
Taken together, these results highlight the unpredictable patterns revealed by an intersectional approach, even for a single health outcome, within one country, and illustrate the need for empirical investigations into the actual population patterns in health that appear in the intersections of multiple disadvantages. This may imply that the complexity highlighted by intersectionality may not be easily captured in a universal hypothesis accounting for varying societal contexts and, not least, the wide and heterogeneous range of intersectional spaces considered in this and other studies. Such a picture stresses the importance of building responsive processes that allow policymaking, planning, and priority setting to continuously adapt to current patterns and conditions on both a community and national level. Assessing discriminatory accuracy is also important in order to avoid irrelevant categorization of individuals that may otherwise be stigmatized.
