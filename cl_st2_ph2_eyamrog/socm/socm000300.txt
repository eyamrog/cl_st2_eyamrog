Title: Early childhood parenting and adolescent bullying behavior: Evidence from a randomized intervention at ten-year follow-up


Abstract_Section: Rationale

Bullying in education is a significant public health problem with long-run life cycle consequences, but efforts to reduce bullying were met with mixed results. We ask whether improving early childhood parenting can reduce subsequent bullying behavior by the children.

Abstract_Section: Method

We analyze ten-year follow-up of a randomized intervention where the parents of preschool children received a training aimed at improving parenting techniques, such as disciplinary strategies. 280 parents in 17 preschools were cluster-randomized at the preschool level (intervention group, cluster = 11, n = 186 vs. control group, cluster = 6, n = 94). Their children were followed ten years later, at ages between 12 and 16, with overall attrition rate of 12.5%. Ordinary least squares is used to estimate the intent-to-treat effects, controlling for the baseline characteristics of the child and the mother. Multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting are used to account for attrition and wild-cluster bootstrap test is used for statistical inference with few clusters. We estimate treatment-on-the-treated effects using two-stage least squares to account for noncompliance in the intervention group. Finally, we examine the associations between bullying and externalizing behavior.

Abstract_Section: Results

Adolescent children are significantly less likely to bully their peers if their parents received the parenting training when their children were in preschools. The effects are stronger for boys and for aggressive forms of bullying such as ‘beating’ and ‘threatening’. Treatment-on-the-treated effects are greater in magnitude and more significant than intent-to-treat effects, suggesting that the effects are driven by program participants. No effect is found for cyberbullying and for victimization. The results were robust to using multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting. We also find suggestive evidence that the effects on bullying are not explained by changes in externalizing behavior.

Abstract_Section: Conclusion

We show that improving early childhood parenting can have important public health benefits through reduction in adolescent bullying behavior.

Section: 1. Introduction

Bullying in school is a common problem with serious public health consequences. In surveys of developed countries published between 1993 and 2005, 4–27% of youths reported they bullied others “weekly or more”, while 9–30% reported they were victims of bullying ( Berger (2007) ). In 2016, a nationally representative survey showed that 22.7% of youths in the US suffered bullying, while 6.4% bullied others. These figures are based on self-reports, suggesting that true figures are probably higher ( Lebrun-Harris et al. (2018) ).
Bully victimization in school is associated with low academic achievement ( Eriksen et al. (2014) ; Sarzosa and Urzúa (2015) ), problematic behavior and lower subjective well being ( Nansel et al. (2001) ), poor physical and mental health ( Wolke and Lereya (2015) ), and suicide ( Nikolaou (2017 b) ). Furthermore, victims experience negative outcomes in earnings and employment in adulthood ( Brimblecombe et al. (2018) , Drydakis (2014) , and Gorman et al. (2019) ), and the negative effects could spill over to family members as well ( Nomaguchi and Fettro (2020) ).
In this study, we evaluate the effects of an early childhood parent training program on adolescent bullying. Parents were randomized into receiving a training program on effective parenting and disciplinary strategies. By examining the children's bullying behavior in adolescence, we shed light on whether improving early childhood home environment can reduce adolescent bullying.
Furthermore, to understand how bullying is determined, we investigate the relationship between bullying and other problematic behavior. We focus on externalizing behavior, since prior literature showed that improved parenting can reduce externalizing behavior ( Kim et al. (2018) ).
Many bullying interventions focused on school setting. Early efforts by Olweus ( Olweus (1994) ) were successful in reducing bullying and general antisocial behavior in primary and secondary schools in Norway. Many school-based programs were subsequently implemented and analyzed, focusing on programs for conventional bullying ( Langford et al. (2014) , Lee et al. (2015) , Fraguas et al. (2021) , Gaffney et al. (2019c) , Gaffney et al. (2021a) , Merrell et al. (2008) , Silva et al. (2017) , and Ttofi and Farrington (2011) ), cyberbullying ( van Cleemput et al. (2014) , Gaffney et al. (2019a) , and Polanin et al. (2021) ), or both ( Cantone et al. (2015) , Ng et al. (2020) , Resett and Mesurado (2021) , and Zych et al. (2015) ). While they reduced bullying aggression and victimization, the effects were generally modest and heterogeneous across student and program characteristics ( Juvonen and Graham (2014) ). For example, programs were less effective for adolescents ( Jiménez-Barbero et al. (2016) ; Yeager et al. (2015) ) or when implemented in developing countries ( Sivaraman et al. (2019) ). School-based programs with parenting component were more effective ( Bradshaw (2015) , Chen et al. (2020) , Gaffney et al. (2019b) , Gaffney et al. (2021b) , Shackleton et al. (2016) and Ttofi and Farrington (2011) ), although Huang et al. (2019) did not find such evidence.
Programs on school violence sometimes included bullying as one of target outcomes. Studies showed that school-based programs were at best moderately effective in reducing violent behavior ( Kim (2016) , Kovalenko et al. (2020) , Lester et al. (2017) , and Mytton et al. (2006) ).
Other than school-based programs, anti-bullying policies at the school level ( Hall (2017) ; Owen-Moore (2019) ) were found to be effective in reducing bullying. Policies at the state level were also effective in case of high schools ( Nikolaou (2017 a) ; Sabia and Bass (2017) ) but not at lower school levels ( Manzella (2018) ). Programs for social skills were not effective in reducing bullying aggression or victimization ( Silva et al. (2018) ), even though school-based programs that included social skills component were effective ( Juvonen and Graham (2014) ), suggesting that complementarity of program elements may be important.
Given the complexity of findings, some analysts concluded that it was too early to make definitive policy recommendations ( Smith et al. (2012) ; Smith (2017) ). We contribute to this literature by analyzing an early childhood parenting intervention.

Section: 2. Theoretical background

Bullying is defined as a systematic abuse of power with repeated, often unprovoked aggression and an imbalance of power ( Smith and Brain (2000) ). It can be done directly to the victims by physical or verbal assault, or indirectly through social exclusion. Cyberbullying uses electronic communication.
Some interpreted bullying as an evolutionary adaptation to assert social dominance under right environmental conditions ( Volk et al. (2012) ; Wolke and Lereya (2015) ). Studies showed that peers with low socio-emotional skills and low parental support were more likely to be victims of bullying ( Chrysanthou and Vasilakis (2020) ; Sarzosa and Urzúa (2015) ). Certain school environments, such as the presence of minority groups or lack of student support, increased the chance of bullying ( Gower et al. (2015) ; Owen-Moore (2019) ).
If bullying is entirely determined by the characteristics of potential victims or the environment, then early childhood parenting training should not affect subsequent bullying. Better policy responses would focus on the victims or the school environment so that bullies cannot assert social dominance through bullying.
On the other hand, early childhood parenting may form children's characteristics that predict subsequent bullying. Indeed, bullies were more likely to have been exposed to negative home environment ( Cook et al. (2010) ; Lereya et al. (2013) ). We may consider two potential channels linking childhood parenting and adolescent bullying. First, bullying may be a dimension of externalizing behavior determined by more fundamental socio-emotional skills ( Almlund et al. (2011) ). In this case, improving socio-emotional skills of children can reduce subsequent bullying. In addition, changes in bullying would be highly correlated with changes in other externalizing behavior.
Second, bullying may be a type of conflict-resolution strategy that children might learn from parenting. Repeated use of harsh parenting may train the children in using aggressive responses to resolve conflict and assert oneself ( Patterson et al. (1984) ). In this case, improving parenting would reduce bullying, but its changes would not correspond to changes in other externalizing behavior.

Section: 3. Data

Our data is based on a randomized intervention called Triple P Positive Parenting Program ( Sanders et al. (2014) ) that provides education and training to parents on parenting skills. The program is available in Levels 1 through 5 in increasing intensity. Our study is based on the Level 4 group intervention program. It was implemented from 2001 to 2002 in Braunschweig, Germany, a city of population 250,000 with a small urban background. After introducing the program to all of 33 preschools in the city, with a total of 913 eligible families, 23 showed interest; 17 of them were randomly chosen for the study due to budget constraint. 280 families in 17 preschools participated in the study.
The program did not target households with risk factors associated with children's behavioral problems, making it a ‘universal’ intervention as opposed to a ‘targeted’ intervention. Eligible criteria included having a child between ages 2.6 and 6 and being fluent in German. Only one child per family was eligible.
Parents learned of the program and decided whether to participate before randomization took place. Randomization is therefore valid within the sample. Families were more likely to participate when they were from neighborhoods with less social problems. According to Heinrichs et al. (2005) , parents with high socioeconomic status were more likely to participate, while non-participating parents cited potential intrusion into privacy as the biggest concern. Thus, although not nationally representative, the sample consists of motivated families who are arguably drawn from a policy -relevant population that the program would be able to reach if it were made widely available.
After the sample recruitment, 11 preschools containing 186 families were randomized into intervention group, and 6 preschools with 94 families into the control group. Each preschool was randomized into the intervention group with two-thirds probability so that there would be enough observations even if some families dropped out of the program. We used “toss of coin” to randomize preschools.
Randomization occurred at the preschool level rather than at the family level to ensure minimal control contamination. Specifically, we aimed to avoid assigning families within the same preschool to the different groups so that the parents would not share information about the program among one another.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of baseline characteristics, collected before the randomization was implemented. On average, control group has higher proportion of single mothers, lower household income , and higher mother's hours of work, but better child behaviors. We control for these characteristics in the analysis. Table 1 . Descriptive statistics of baseline characteristics. Empty Cell (1) (2) (3) (4) Empty Cell Control Itvn Compliers Noncomp.

Itvn: Intervention group; Noncomp: Noncompliers group. Child gender equals 1 if child is a girl, and 0 otherwise. Mother's education equals 1 if the mother graduated high school or above.
After learning of the randomization results, 42 families in the intervention group declined to participate but responded to all the follow-up surveys. Compared to the noncomplier group, the complier group has higher income, higher mother's age, shorter mother's hours of work, but more externalizing behavior problems at the baseline. These differences may have been driven by parents' choices, which we account for in Section 4.3 . The most common reason for noncompliance was “scheduling conflict and time demands” (57%) ( Heinrichs et al. (2005) ).
In most cases only mothers were trained, even though both parents were invited. Since children did not directly participate, we suspect that the other parent took care of the child while the program was in session. We therefore focus on mother's characteristics, although we found that father's characteristics were well-balanced as well.
The “Positive Parent Training Triple P″ is a multilevel parenting and family support strategy developed in Australia by Sanders and colleagues ( Sanders et al. (2014) ). The group parent training format consists of four weekly group sessions of 2 h each with six to ten families, and four optional 15-min phone contacts made on a weekly basis. Parents are taught 17 core child management strategies. Ten of the strategies are designed to promote children's competence and development (e.g., quality time, talking with children, physical affection, praise, setting a good example, behavior charts) and seven strategies are designed to help parents manage misbehavior (e.g., setting rules, directed discussion, planned ignoring, logical consequences, time out). In addition, parents are taught a six-step planned activities routine to enhance the generalization and maintenance of parenting skills (e.g., plan ahead, decide on rules, select engaging activities).
Five female clinical psychologists were trained, licensed, and supervised in the delivery of the interventions. In total, 28 groups were run. In 50% of all group sessions, research assistants completed a protocol adherence checklist, resulting in an adherence to the manual of over 91%. Supervision was provided during regular weekly staff meetings and included the discussion of difficult situations in the group sessions, coaching and conducting role plays with alternative trainer behavior.
The effectiveness of Triple P has been widely investigated in at least 30 countries. By 2018, 274 evaluation studies (comprising 137 Randomized Controlled Trials) have been published, showing in 95% positive effects for Triple P ( Sanders and Prinz (2018) ).
This implementation of the program, in Braunschweig, Germany, was previously evaluated in Hahlweg et al. (2010) , Heinrichs et al. (2014) , Kim et al. (2018) , and Camehl et al. (2020) . Hahlweg et al. (2010) and Heinrichs et al. (2014) evaluated the program outcomes at two-year and four-year follow-ups, respectively, showing improvements in parenting and reductions in children's problematic behavior . Kim et al. (2018) showed that children displayed reduced externalizing behavior and improved subjective well-being at ten-year follow-up. Camehl et al. (2020) showed that the program improved mother's subjective well-being.
The data collection was done with a combination of interviews and a written and electronically standardized survey which lasted approximately 2.5 h. Interviews were carried out within the framework of home visits or on the premises of the Technical University of Braunschweig. The parent in question (in 94% of the cases, the mothers) and the adolescents were interviewed in parallel sessions, separate from each other. The interviews were conducted by two interviewers (at least one of them with a Master's degree in Psychology in training to become a clinical psychologist [German: Psychological psychotherapist]). Since some of the items were sensitive, the adolescents were questioned by an interviewer of the same gender. We expected an improvement in parenting behavior and a long-term reduction of external and internal problems through the universal use of the parenting course (primary criteria). In addition, a long-term reduction of the individual burden of parents was expected as well as a long-term improvement of partnership satisfaction (secondary criteria).
Because it was comparison of a group training and a control group, Double Blind procedures could not be used in the study. Therefore, participants and fieldworkers were not blind.
Adolescent bullying behaviors were measured at the ten-year follow up, when the children were between 12 and 16 years old, using German adaptation of Olweus’ Bully-Victims Questionnaire ( Lösel et al. (1997) ; Olweus (1989) ). The questionnaire assesses whether the adolescent was involved in bullying others at school, or were a victim of bullying at school during last year . The response is recorded as: 1 = never; 2 = once or twice; 3 = occasionally; 4 = once a week; 5 = several times a week. There are 18 items total. First five items ask the respondents whether they were victimized by their peers. Items 6 to 15 ask whether the students were bullying aggressors, either on their own or as a participant. Item 16 asks about cyberbullying victimization and the last two items ask about cyberbullying aggression.
For the estimation, we constructed sum scores of outcome variables and scaled them to be mean 0 and standard deviation 1 within each child's baseline age 3, 4, 5, and 6 (age 2 is combined with 3 since very few were 2 years old). Beating score is a sum of items 6 and 11; Threatening score is a sum of items 7 and 12; Teasing score is a sum of items 8 and 13; Destroying Property score is a sum of items 9 and 14; Using Weapon score is a sum of items 10 and 15; Cyberbullying score is a sum of items 17 and 18; and Victimization score is a sum of items 1 through 5 and 16. We constructed Bullying Total Score by estimating a measurement model (1) M i , j = π 0 , j + π 1 , j θ i + π 2 , j X i + η i , j , where for each child i and measure j , M i , j is the j th score constructed above. X i is a row vector of indicators of child's age at baseline. θ i is the latent factor describing the child's engagement in bullying, constrained to be mean 0 and standard deviation 1. π 1, j coefficient is constrained to be 1 for one of the measures to facilitate identification, following Cunha and Heckman (2008) . Score for each child i is predicted based on Equation (1) using factor analysis.

Section: 4. Empirical model

The observed outcome Y i k of participant i k ∈ I k in preschool k ∈ K is modeled as (2) Y i k = Z k Y i k ( 1 ) + ( 1 − Z k ) Y i k ( 0 ) , where K = {1, …, N K } denotes the set of preschools and I k = {1 k , …, N k } the set of participants within preschool k . Z k = 1 if the preschool k is in the intervention group and Z k = 0 otherwise. ( Y i k ( 0 ) , Y i k ( 1 ) ) are potential outcomes for participant i k in preschool k . Our null hypothesis is the intervention having no effect, or the outcome under the intervention group, Y i k ( 1 ) , and the outcome in the control group, Y i k ( 0 ) , having the same distribution. Rewriting Equation (2) , we have (3) Y i k = Y i k 0 + Y i k 1 − Y i k 0 Z k .
Y i k 1 − Y i k 0 identifies the effect of being assigned to the intervention group, or the intent-to-treat (ITT) effect. The empirical model is (4) Y i k = β 0 + β 1 Z k + β 2 X i k + ε i k , where β 1 identifies ITT. We estimate Equation (4) using ordinary least squares . X i k is a row vector of control variables including single mother status, household income, child's age, mother's age, mother's education level , mother's hours of work, child's age, child's gender, child's externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior, measured at baseline. ε i k is individual specific error term, assumed independent across k but potentially correlated within each k .
Statistical inference based on t -distribution is justified when the degree of freedom is sufficiently large. Because the degrees of freedom in a clustered model is based on the number of clusters, standard t -test may be inaccurate with 17 clusters in our study. Therefore, we augment our statistical inference with p -values from wild-cluster bootstrap test, which has been shown to perform well with a small number of clusters in simulation exercises ( Cameron and Miller (2015) ).
Wild cluster bootstrap maintains the cluster structure while imposing the null hypothesis in each bootstrap sample. Specifically, to test the null hypothesis of β 1 = 0 in Equation 4, (a) model parameters are estimated with null hypothesis imposed, obtaining β 0 ̃ and β 2 ̃ ; (b) residuals ε ̃ i k = Y i k − β ̃ 0 − β ̃ 2 X i k are formed; (c) for each cluster, a weight d k is drawn from a pre-specified symmetric distribution with zero mean (Webb's six-point distribution is used in our case); (d) new pseudo-residuals are generated as ε i k * = d k × ε ̃ i k , and the new outcome variable Y i k * = β 0 ̃ + β 2 ̃ X i k + ε i k * is constructed; (e) Y i k * is then regressed on Z k and X i k , and the test statistic for β 1 is estimated; (f) this step is repeated to create a bootstrap distribution of test statistic. p -value is the proportion of bootstrap test statistic that exceed sample test statistic in absolute value.
In order to account for noncompliance in the intervention group, we use two-stage least squares (TSLS) where the random assignment status serves as an instrument for actual compliance to the intervention program. If parents do not act on private individual gains to the intervention, this estimator identifies treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effect ( Heckman (1997) ). The primary reason for non-compliance was time constraint (see Section 3.2 ). While in principle it is impossible to account for all of the unobservables, our model seems to capture the most obvious predictors of noncompliance choice, including parent's hours of work, education level, and baseline child behaviors. We therefore interpret these estimates as TOT, understanding that strong assumptions were necessary.
Table 2 shows the attrition rate of the bullying variables at ten-year follow up. Overall attrition rate is 12.5%, but it is much higher in the control group (19%) than in the intervention group (9%). Comparing across gender, the rate is higher for girls than for boys within each group. We account for the attrition rate using multiple imputation (MI) and inverse-probability weighting (IPW). Table 2 . Attrition at ten-year Follow Up. Empty Cell Intervention Control Baseline N 186 94 Attrition rate 0.091 0.191 Empty Cell Itvn Boys Itvn Girls Ctrl Boys Ctrl Girls Baseline N 96 90 48 46 Attrition rate 0.073 0.111 0.130 0.261
Using MI and IPW would lead to biased estimates if unobservable characteristics that affect the outcome also drive attrition. Specifically, distinctness assumption (which consists ignorabilty assumption) would be violated, as attrition mechanism changes the observed relationship between the intervention and the outcome ( Sidi and Harel (2018) ).
A potential source of attrition in the control group is that bullies may choose not to respond to the surveys out of stigma. If this were the case, then our estimates would be biased towards understating the true effects of the intervention. Alternatively, our estimates would be biased towards overstating the effects if attrition is driven by those who do not bully others, perhaps due to effort cost of responding to surveys. Our qualitative results would change if the attrition bias from effort cost is greater than that from response stigma.
In Table A1 , we estimate a logistic regression model predicting non-attrition status, with baseline characteristics including household income, single mother status, child's age, mother's education level, and child's problematic behaviors. The only significant predictor is household income.
Therefore, we assume that attrition is not driven by unobservable characteristics that also affect outcomes. In this case, attrition bias can be corrected using IPW and MI techniques. In Section 5, we report estimates based on full case analysis (FCA), which only includes observations with non-missing values, as well as estimates using IPW and MI, following recommendations from Sidi and Harel (2018) .
IPW is implemented by estimating the baseline models with weights as the inverse of the probabilities estimated from the logistic regression model shown in Table A1 , so that the observations more likely to be missing from the sample receive larger weight. The model used to estimate the probabilities is selected using Bayesian Information Criteria, while maintaining sufficient sample size.
MI is implemented by imputing the outcome variable 200 times, using the model y i = α + βX i + ε i . X i is a row vector of baseline characteristics, the same as the ones used for Equation (4) . ε i is assumed to be normally distributed.

Section: 5. Results

Table 3 presents the ITT estimates. The estimates using FCA show that the parent training reduced adolescent bullying by 0.259 in standard deviation unit, significant at 5% level when tested using conventional t -test and significant at 10% level when tested using bootstrap t -test.

For each of the subscales of bullying, we find that the results are driven by ‘Beating’ and ‘Threatening’ scores. ITT estimate for ‘Beating’ is −0.239, with bootstrap p -value of 0.054. The effect for ‘Threatening’ is −0.274, also significant at 10% level. While the ITT effect is −0.191 for ‘Teasing’, it is not significant at 10% level. The effect on ‘Destroying Property’ is −0.223 but also statistically insignificant. The effects on ‘Using Weapons’ and ‘Cyberbullying’ are small and insignificant. Aside from ‘Using Weapons’, where only two respondents reported this occurred, the effects seem to be concentrated on direct confrontations such as beating and threatening. The effects on Victimization are close to zero and statistically insignificant.
Table 4 presents the TOT estimates. Overall, TOT estimates are greater in magnitude than the corresponding ITT estimates and similarly significant, implying that the intervention effects were driven by compliers. All of the ITT and TOT results are robust to IPW and MI . Table 4 . Treatment-on-the-treated effect of parenting training on adolescent bullying.

In this section, we investigate heterogeneous effects of the intervention program. We did not find any evidence of heterogeneity based on parent's education, household income, parent's age, single mother status, child's age, and child's baseline behavior. We, however, discovered significant gender differences in the effects of the intervention, which we test by estimating (5) Y i k = α + β Z k + γ Z k × F e m a l e i k + δ X i k + ε i k .
β identifies the ITT effect on boys and β + γ the effect on girls. TOT effects are estimated using TSLS , where the assignment indicator and assignment-gender interaction are used as instruments for the compliance and the compliance-gender interaction.
Table 5 shows the estimates based on Equation (5) . The effects are clearly concentrated on boys. The parent training reduced boys' bullying by −0.469 in standard deviation unit, significant at 1% level using conventional inference and at 5% using bootstrap inference. The interaction term coefficient is 0.463 and significant at 1% level, implying that the effect on girls is −0.006, close to zero. Similar pattern is observed for ‘Beating’, ‘Threatening’, and ‘Teasing’ subscales: effects observed for boys, but not for girls. No effects were found for ‘Destroying Property’, ‘Using Weapons’, ‘Cyberbullying’, and ‘Victimization’ for boys or girls. Table 5 .

The results in the previous section suggest that improving early childhood parenting can reduce adolescent bullying. We now examine how parenting might have affected bullying. Bullying may be a type of externalizing behavior, so that the effects on bullying can be explained by the effects on externalizing behavior. On the other hand, bullying may be distinct from externalizing behaviors in its connection with early childhood parenting (See Section 2 ). To investigate these two possibilities, we study the correlation between bullying and externalizing behavior in adolescence. If the effects on bullying are due to the effects on externalizing behavior, then the pattern of correlation between bullying and externalizing behavior would correspond to the pattern of the intervention effects.
Table 7 presents the correlation among bullying, bully-victimization, externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, subjective well-being, and social relationship , all measured at the ten-year follow up. Previous studies showed that the intervention reduced externalizing behavior and improved subjective well-being, regardless of gender ( Kim et al. (2018) ). Table 7 . Cross-correlation table.

If the effects on bullying is driven by the effects on externalizing behavior, we should expect weaker correlation between bullying and externalizing behavior for girls. However, the magnitude of correlation is very similar between boys (0.620) and girls (0.613).
We further investigate the relationship between externalizing behavior and each of the bullying subscales in Table 8 . High correlation between bullying and externalizing behavior seems to be driven by ‘Beating’ and ‘Teasing’ subscales, where the correlations are around 0.5 for both genders. The effects on these were significant only for boys. The effects were also observed for ‘Threatening’ subscale but the correlations are smaller. For ‘Cyberbullying’, where no effects were observed, the correlations are sizable: 0.289 for boys, 0.560 for girls. Table 8 . Cross-correlation table.

We conclude that while bullying is highly correlated with externalizing behavior, the effects of parenting intervention on bullying cannot be easily explained by its association with externalizing behavior.
We draw additional insights from these estimates. The correlation between bullying and internalizing behavior is small for both genders. The correlation between bullying and child's well-being is negative, as well as the correlation between bullying and child's social relationship. The bullies in the sample do not seem to be socially dominant figures as proposed by Wolke and Lereya (2015) .
The correlation between bullying and victimization is positive, confirming the findings in the bullying literature that some bullies are also victims themselves ( Smith and Brain (2000) ). Bully-victim status affects boys mostly, with the correlation of 0.480 (0.099 for girls).

Section: 6. Discussion

How does early childhood parenting affect adolescent bullying? In Section 2 , we proposed a possibility that the reduction in bullying was achieved by reduction in externalizing behavior. In this case, the correlation between externalizing behavior and bullying would mirror the pattern of intervention effects found in this study–higher for boys, and for more aggressive forms of bullying. We found that the correlation was high for both boys and girls, and regardless of whether we detected significant intervention effects, inconsistent with the interpretation that the effects were driven by reduction in externalizing behavior. Instead, our main results support the interpretation that parenting generates child characteristics that make children more likely to be bullies. This interpretation is consistent with the findings in the literature that bullying prevention programs are more effective with parenting component ( Bradshaw (2015) , Chen et al. (2020) , Gaffney et al. (2019b) , Gaffney et al. (2021b) , Shackleton et al. (2016) , and Ttofi and Farrington (2011) ).
Our findings of stronger effects for boys are consistent with the literature showing that bullying prevention programs were more effective for boys, albeit on victimization ( Kennedy (2020) ). One possible reason is that boys engaged in more bullying, as seen in Table A2 . Indeed, bullying is more common among boys around the world ( Smith et al. (2019) ). However, it does not explain the lack of effects on cyberbullying. Comparing baseline differences between boys and girls in Table A2 , we find that girls in the control group are more likely to have single mothers (17.4%) than those in the intervention group (5.6%), or boys in the either group (4.2% vs. 4.2%). We control for baseline differences. Also, in results not reported here, we find that all our results are robust to excluding control variables, suggesting that baseline differences are unlikely to be the explanation. Sources of gender difference in these effects would be an interesting topic for future research.
We highlight a number of limitations of our study.
First, the intervention was implemented when the children are between 2.6 and 6 years old, and the outcome behaviors were observed 10 years after the intervention. This is therefore a long-term solution to future bullying but not an immediate solution to existing bullying problems.
Second, the study does not provide alternative measurements other than the children's self-reports. Although the literature suggests that self-reports are reliable, measurements from teachers, peers and parents would further validate the results ( Volk et al. (2017) ).
Third, we employed cluster randomization design to reduce the risk of control group contamination. It should be remembered that, with this design, statistical power is smaller and it becomes harder to be confident in the balance of unobservable characteristics between the intervention and the control groups. Also, individual-level trials may be more suited for the evaluation of individual-level changes ( Torgerson (2001) ).
Fourth, Attrition by arm is not small and the baseline differences in mother's hours of work and child's internalizing behavior are sizable. Although we control for baseline characteristics and used MI and IPW to account for attrition, the estimates may yet be biased if the underlying assumptions are not met.
Fifth, the analysis of the ten-year follow-up was not guided by a published protocol.
Sixth, as pointed out in Section 3.4, the outcome assessors were not blind to group assignment.
Finally, while there are many parenting interventions that focused on early childhood, very few collected outcomes in adolescence. The findings of this study should be replicated by collecting long term follow up measures of other parenting interventions and investigating the potential effects on bullying.

Section: 7. Conclusion

Given the destructive potential of bullying, it is important to understand the determinants of bullying and effective ways to reduce it. Our analysis of parenting intervention shows that training parents to use better discipline methods reduced adolescent bullying in multiple dimensions, especially those involving direct confrontation. The effects were concentrated on boys, who were more likely to bully others in the first place. The results suggest that early childhood parenting can affect the children's bullying behavior in adolescence. Therefore, bullying prevention programs may be made more effective by starting earlier in child's life and by strengthening components on parenting.
An interesting avenue for future research would be to study the mechanisms of changes in bullying behavior throughout childhood and adolescence, considering short-term developments in child's externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, and parenting, among others. Furthermore, examining even longer-run effects on bullying behavior and victimization in late adolescence and beyond would be useful.
