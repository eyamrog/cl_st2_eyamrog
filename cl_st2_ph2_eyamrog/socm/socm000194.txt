Title: Impacts of anticancer drug parity laws on mortality rates


Abstract: Abstract

This study investigates the impacts of anticancer drug parity laws on mortality rates in the United States using a difference-in-differences approach. Using data from 2004 to 2017 Compressed Mortality Files, we show that the anticancer drug parity laws reduce the mortality rate for head/neck malignant cancers but have no impact on malignant cancers of other types. We also rule out an insurance expansion channel that may influence the relationship between anticancer drug parity laws and malignant cancer mortality. Our results are robust to various specifications and falsification tests. Our findings imply that providing equal access to oral anticancer drugs is an effective tool for the prevention of premature mortality .

Section: 1. Introduction

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States ( Siegel et al., 2018 ). In 2015, the total earnings lost due to cancer mortality were approximately USD 94.4 billion ( Islami et al., 2019 ). Therefore, policies that improve access to anticancer therapies can potentially yield large socioeconomic benefits through the reduction of premature cancer mortality. For instance, improved insurance coverage could potentially reduce cancer mortality through increased access to anticancer therapies ( Rosenberg et al., 2015 ). Drug therapy is one such approach that has garnered significant attention. It involves the utilization of intravenous anticancer drugs (IADs) and oral anticancer drugs (OADs) to treat cancer when a tumor has been removed by surgery or other therapies or has spread to other parts of the body.
However, previous literature on the impact of drug insurance on health has been empirically inconclusive. For example, Huh and Reif (2018), Dunn and Shapiro (2019) , Diebold (2016) , and Wang et al. (2015) highlighted the beneficial health impact of drug insurance (such as Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs) and found that such insurance improves health outcomes. Conversely, Liu et al. (2011) , Kaestner et al. (2019) , and Khan et al. (2007) found that drug insurance had no discernible impact of drug insurance on health outcomes. As such, the impact of drug insurance on health outcomes remains an open issue.
To address this issue, we exploit the state-level policies under which the insurance costs of OADs and IADs are equalized to improve access to OADs in the US. These policies are referred to as anticancer drug parity laws. Previous literature has shown that these laws have significant and modest impacts on out-of-pocket costs for patients using OADs ( Dusetzina et al., 2018 ). Specifically, Dusetzina et al. (2018) demonstrated that the parity laws reduce the costs of OADs for patients and double the probability of patients receiving OADs at no costs. In other words, the parity laws improve cancer patients' accessibility to OADs. This, in turn, may improve patients' chances of survival by providing them access to novel oral drug therapies, combination therapies with more efficient treatments, and better drug adherence ( Batson et al., 2017 ; Hershman et al., 2011 ; Maemondo et al., 2010 ; Motzer et al., 2009 ; O'Shaughnessy et al., 2002 ; Vokes et al., 1989 ; Zhou et al., 2011 ). Through these channels, a state implementing anticancer drug parity laws may experience a reduction in cancer mortality rates .
Our study is related to two strands of literature concerning the impact of insurance coverage on health outcomes. The first strand concerns the impact of parity laws on treatment utilization and health outcomes ( Buckles, 2013 ; Klick and Markowitz, 2006 ; Lang, 2013 ; Popovici et al., 2017 ; Schmidt, 2007 ), while the second strand refers to the impact of drug insurance on health outcomes ( Dunn and Shapiro, 2019 ; Kaestner et al., 2019 ; Khan et al., 2007 ; Huh and Reif, 2017 ; Liu et al., 2011 ; Wang et al., 2015 ). Prior literature on parity laws—for example, Lang (2013) and Popovici et al. (2017) —shows that such laws improve access to treatment utilization, which spills over to the overall population health. However, previous studies on parity laws have focused on mental health and infertility. As a result, we know little about the impact of non-mental health and non-infertility parity laws. Furthermore, past studies on drug insurance are limited to public programs such as Medicare Part D, which means there is limited evidence on the impact of private drug insurance on health outcomes. Our study fills in these gaps in the literature and provides the first analysis of the causal impact of anticancer drug parity laws on health outcomes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background of OADs with regard to anticancer drug parity laws and reviews the literature on the parity laws. Section 3 describes the estimation strategies and data sources. Section 4 presents the estimation results. Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses policy implications.

Section: 2. Background and previous literature

Anticancer drugs , regardless of whether they are oral anticancer drugs (OADs) or intravenous anticancer drugs (IADs), can be categorized into two types: chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs . Chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells by targeting their cell replicating mechanisms ( Olsen et al., 2019 ). Although OADs can involve chemotherapy drugs, the majority of chemotherapies are IADs. The difference lies in from the method of administration (oral vs intravenous) with minor differences in functionality between the two. Targeted therapy drugs annihilate cancer cells by targeting a specific cellular mechanism such as a gene, a protein, or antigens ( Carrington, 2015 ; Olsen et al., 2019 ). The targeted therapy drugs of OADs include but are not limited to small molecule drugs and endocrine therapy drugs. For IADs, targeted therapy drugs are generally monoclonal antibodies . The functionalities of targeted therapies of OADs and IADs may differ, as the mechanisms they affect differ significantly. Specifically, small molecule drugs generally inhibit certain cellular mechanisms such as protein signaling, whereas monoclonal antibodies bind to cancerous cells, causing the immune system to attack them. Unfortunately, these drugs have side effects resulting from the fact that non-cancer and cancer cells share similar cellular mechanisms in replication and function ( Milata et al., 2019 ; Olsen et al., 2019 ). The drugs are thus highly regulated because of these side effects.
Oral anticancer drugs have several advantages IADs. First, OADs are significantly more convenient to administer than IADs ( Aisner, 2007 ). The latter require an infusion pump to administer the drugs into the body through the bloodstream, while OADs are pills that are taken directly. Second, clinical trials have shown that some OADs have higher treatment efficiencies, which contributes to better patient survival rates . For example, OADs, such as Gefitinib , Erlotinib , and Sunitinib , have been shown to improve the overall survival rates of cancer patients compared to the effincacy of IADs such as Carboplatin–Paclitaxel and Interferon alfa , and other therapies for certain types of cancer ( Maemondo et al., 2010 ; Motzer et al., 2009 ; Zhou et al., 2011 ). Moreover, multiple studies have also shown that combining of OADs with therapies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and IADs, can increase treatment efficiency and patient survival rates ( O'Shaughnessy et al., 2002 ; Raafat et al., 2012 ; Vokes et al., 1989 ). For instance, a clinical trial has shown that Capecitabine , used in conjunction with radiotherapy, can significantly reduce mortality rates associated with head/neck cancers ( Raafat et al., 2012 ).
However, the relatively high costs of OADs mean that access to them is limited due to a gap in insurance coverage in the USA. This gap is defined by the higher copayment, coinsurance, or out-of-pocket payments associated with using OADs rather than IADs. This is due to OADs being covered under the pharmacy benefit, which covers any drugs not administered in a medical setting, whereas IADs are covered under the medical benefit, which customarily covers any drugs administered in a medical setting ( Dusetzina et al., 2014a ; Fitch et al., 2010 ; Hede, 2009 ; Kircher et al., 2016 ; Shen et al., 2014 ). Generally, pharmacy benefits have a tier-based copayment structure, which increases copayments, coinsurance, or out-of-pocket payments with or without an annual maximum allowable fee for drugs in the higher tiers, while medical benefits only have a single fixed copayment and an annual maximum allowable fee across all drug types. Such a disparity in coverage would lead to patients unable to afford these drugs ( Dusetzina et al., 2014b ; Streeter et al., 2011 ).
Consequently, cancer patient advocacy groups have called for parity between OADs and IADs ( Printz, 2014 ). Anticancer drug parity laws are meant to lower the copayments, coinsurance, and other costs of OADs, to make them comparable with IAD costs and thus affordable to insured cancer patients. This can therefore reduce cancer mortality in the implementing states through access to certain OADs with higher treatment efficiencies than other therapies, an increased utilization of OAD-based combination therapies, and an increase in adherence to the OAD therapies. This is critical, as non-adherence to drugs is a major contributor to mortality ( Hershman et al., 2011 ; Walsh et al., 2019 ).
Table 1 presents the timing of implementing anticancer drug parity laws from 2004 to 2017. Over this period, Oregon was the first state to adopt anticancer drug parity laws (in 2008), 29 states had adopted such laws by 2017. To obtain the details on the laws, we searched the state statutes containing the phrases “shall provide coverage for a prescribed, orally administered anticancer medication used to kill or slow the growth of cancerous cells and shall apply the lower cost-sharing of either anticancer medication under the prescription drug benefit or intravenous or injected anticancer medications” or “shall provide coverage for prescribed, orally administered anticancer medications used to kill or slow the growth of cancerous cells on a basis not less favorable than intravenously administered or injected cancer medications that are covered as medical benefits.” If a state has a specific statute containing such wording, we consider it an anticancer drug parity state. For the details of state statutes, refer to Appendix Table 1 (see Supplementary Material). Table 1 . Timing of implementation for anticancer drug parity laws.

It is noteworthy that the anticancer cancer drug parity laws are similar to fertility and mental health parity laws regarding the applications to insure populations. Like fertility and mental health parity laws, the anticancer cancer drug parity laws are only applicable to privately insured population. Thus, individuals covered by Medicare or Medicaid would not be affected. This has a significant implication for our analysis in Section 3 . Moreover, some private insurance plans, such as self-insured plans, are not mandated to follow the parity laws due to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
Prior literature has investigated the impact of parity laws on treatment utilization and health outcomes using quasi-experimental approaches, specifically difference-in-differences, triple differences, or instrumental variable approaches. Although the significance and size of impact vary across the types of parity laws being studied, parity laws often result in an increase in the treatment utilizations.
One strand of literature focuses on the impact of mental health parity laws that force insurers to include mental healthcare in the insurance coverage. Using the 2001–2003 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, Harris et al. (2006) showed that the laws increase the utilization of mental health treatments and that individuals with mild mental disorders tend to benefit more than those with severe disorders. Busch and Barry (2008) , using the 1997–2001 National Survey of America's Families, found that the impact of these laws is highly dependent on the size of firm. They revealed that the mental health parity laws tend to increase the utilization of treatments for those working in firms with fewer than 100 employees. Dave and Mukerjee (2011) , using the 1992–2007 Treatment Episodes, established that the number of treatments increases in states applying comprehensive mental health parity laws where equal coverage for a broad range of mental health disorders, including substance abuse disorder, is required.
Regarding health outcomes, Klick and Markowitz (2006) examine the impact of mental health parity laws on state suicide rates. Using 1981–2000 state panel data derived from the Compressed Mortality Files, they demonstrated that the implementations of mental health parity laws has a negative but insignificant impact on state suicide rates. Conversely, Lang (2013) , using the 1990–2004 Compressed Mortality Files, found that the laws would significantly reduce state suicide rates. He showed that when states have stringent parity laws, such as “pure” parity and mandated offering laws, which require insurers to include or offer mental healthcare coverage at parity with physical healthcare, state suicide rates are significantly reduced, whereas when states have lenient parity laws, such as mandated if offered and minimum mandated benefits, which do not require mental healthcare coverage at parity with physical healthcare, there is no impact on state suicide rates. Popovici et al. (2017) investigated the impact of substance-use treatment parity laws on traffic fatalities using the 1988–2010 Fatal Accident Reporting System. They found that these laws reduce traffic fatality rates and that the impact is largest for states with the highest share of severely intoxicated drivers.
The other strand of literature investigates the impact of infertility treatment parity laws, which require insurers to cover infertility treatments alongside physical healthcare. Bitler and Schmidt (2012) , using 1982–2002 data from the National Survey of Family Growth, find that the parity laws increase the utilization of treatments for white and college-educated women. Moreover, the impact is largely driven by treatments used to induce pregnancy, instead of those preventing miscarriages. Schmidt (2007) focused on the impacts of the laws on women's fertility rates using the 1981–1999 Vital Statistics Detailed Natality Data. She found that the laws increased the probability of having children for women over 35 but had no statistically significant impact on women under 35. Buckles (2013) further explored the impact of treatments on multiple birth rates. Using the 1980–2001 Vital Statistics Detailed Natality Data, she found that the laws increased the probability of having triplets for college-educated white women over 30.
Regarding the health impact of drug insurance, their findings are inconsistent among studies using a difference-in-differences approach. Wang et al. (2015) find, referencing the 1994–2003 National Population Health Survey, that Quebec's Universal Drug Insurance was positively associated with the health utility index but it had no impact on the overall self-reported health (SRH). Using the 2000–2010 Medicare Beneficiary Survey, Diebold (2016) found that Medicare Part D had no impact on the overall SRH but significantly reduces the incidences of high blood pressure for Medicare beneficiaries. Huh and Reif (2017) used National Vital Statistics System data from 2001 to 2008 and found that Medicare Part D reduces all-cause mortality rates , which is largely driven by cardiovascular mortality rates. Using the 2000–2010 National Vital Statistics System, Dunn and Shapiro (2019) , like Huh and Reif (2017) , found Medicare Part D reduces cardiovascular mortality rates.
In contrast to these studies, other authors argued that drug insurance has no impact on health outcomes. For example, Khan et al. (2007) used the 1992–2000 Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey and found that Medicare Part D having no impact on either overall SRH or disability among the elderly. Similarly, using 2005–2006 data from the Medicare Expenditure Panel Survey, Liu et al. (2011) found that Medicare Part D does not significantly influence health. Finally, Kaestner et al. (2019) used the 2002–2009 Medicare Current Beneficiaries Survey and found that Medicare Part D has no impact on all-cause mortality rates among the elderly.

Section: 3. Estimation strategies and data source

To investigate the impact of anticancer drug parity laws on cancer mortality rates, we implemented a difference-in-differences approach: (1) Y s t = β 0 + β 1 P a r i t y L a w s s t + τ s + γ t + τ γ s t + Z s t α ′ + ε s t , where Y s t is defined as the natural logarithm of the cancer mortality or incidence rates for state s in year t . P a r i t y L a w s s t is the main policy variable indicating whether the anticancer drug parity laws are implemented in state s in year t . For state s that implemented the laws in year t , it is equal to 1 for all years after year t in state s and 0 otherwise. For the laws implemented between February and November, we define the variable as decimals, which were calculated as the number of months left in the year after policy implementation divided by 12. For instance, if the laws were implemented in March, there would be 9 months left in a year (12–3 = 9), dividing 9 by 12 gives the decimal, 0.75. τ s and are vectors of state and year fixed effects represented by vectors of state and year dummies. τ γ s t is a vector of state-specific trends represented by a vector of interaction terms between state dummies and year trend. Z s t is a vector of state-level socioeconomic variables, including average age, gender, race, marital status, education, private insurance coverage rate, annual average household income, percentage of workers working in firms with ≥500 employees, and number of hospitals per 100,000 persons in state s in year t . ε s t is the error term. β 1 is the parameter of interest. If the parameter is negative and significant, the laws have beneficial impacts on cancer mortality.
We focused on the malignant cancer mortality rates, because only malignant cancer requires drug treatment of any kind. Furthermore, we stratified the malignant cancer types according to the site of occurrence. This was done for a total of 12 sites: breast, respiratory, head/neck, digestive, bone/skin/soft tissue, female genital, male genital, urinary , nervous, thyroid , lymphoid, and ill-defined/multiple. We expected each cancer type to respond differently to the parity laws due to each type having a different number of drugs available and differential treatment efficiency (when used as a solo or combination therapy).
The validity of the difference-in-differences approach hinges on the common trend assumption, which indicates that states that experience no policy shocks are valid counterfactual groups for treatment states. A violation of common trend assumption is policy endogeneity, which involves the correlation between policy and outcomes or unobserved state-level characteristics. For example, states with increasing cancer mortality rates may implement parity laws to reduce the OAD cost burden on the insured (e.g., reverse causality). If that is the case, our estimates from equation (1) may be biased. We conducted an event study to examine whether the common trend assumption is violated for pre-policy periods ( Anderson et al., 2013 ; Autor, 2003 ; Baggio et al., 2020 ; Chang, 2016 ; Nicholas and Mclean, 2019 ). We thus implement the following equation: (2) Y s t = μ 0 + ∑ k = − 4 4 μ k P a r i t y L a w s s ( t + k ) + ρ s + ν t + ρ ν s t + Z s t ζ ′ + ε s t ,
Equation (2) introduces three lead and four lagged policy terms. For example, P a r i t y L a w s s ( t − 4 ) is denoted as a binary variable that equals 1 for the four or more years prior to the implementation of parity laws in parity states, and 0 otherwise. Each lead (lagged) policy term corresponds to the number of years before (after) the implementation of the parity laws for each parity state. The omitted category is one year prior to the implementation of parity laws in parity states. To include the four lagged terms, we exclude the treatment states implementing the parity laws after January 2015, as they did not have enough post-periods. If any lead terms are significant, the conclusions may be not valid as the impact may be driven by policy endogeneity or unobserved state-level characteristics. ρ s , γ t , and ρ ν s t are identical to τ s , γ t , and τ γ s t from equation (1) ; and ζ ′ is a vector of parameters. ε s t is the error terms.
To further strengthen the validity of the difference-in-differences estimates, we performed a number of falsification tests to rule out exogenous influences other than the laws. For instance, a decline in the cancer mortality rate may be the result of a decline in cancer incidence or a spurious relationship between unobserved state variables and cancer mortality. To examine these possibilities, we first replaced the dependent variable with the log cancer incidence rates. If the coefficient on the parity laws is significant and has the same sign in equation (1) , the results may be driven by a change in the cancer incidence rate. To test whether a spurious relationship exists, we replace thed dependent variable in equation (1) with the mortality rates of causes other than cancer and non-malignant cancer mortality rates. If our estimates are significant and have the same signs in equation (1) , the findings may be driven by unobserved state variables. We estimated all equations using a fixed effects model. All regressions were weighted by the squared root of the yearly state population and were clustered by state.
We constructed a state panel dataset using various publicly available data sources. We drew the dependent variables from two sources. The first was the death counts from the 2004–2017 Detailed Mortality Files of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These are derived from the National Vital Statistics System, which contains information on all-cause death for every individual residing in the United States ( CDC, 2018a ). We isolated cancer death counts using ICD-10 codes C.00–D.49, which represent neoplasms in ICD categories. The second source was the 2004–2016 cancer incidence count from the United States Cancer Statistics, jointly collected by CDC and National Institute of Cancer ( CDC, 2018b ). These are extracted from the National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results, which contains all diagnosed cancer cases from the medical records of the cancer registries affiliated with the program.
Due to a lack of data on state-level socioeconomic variables for mortality and incidence rates, we augmented the data with the socioeconomic characteristics from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (ASEC), provided by the University of Minnesota ( IPUMS-CPS, 2018 ). This survey supplement collects socioeconomic information, such as marital status and education, from sampled individuals in the Current Population Survey during February, March, and April. We extracted age, gender, racial, marital, educational, household income, and private and public insurance information from the database and aggregate the individual-level characteristics into state-level characteristics. For other data, the number of workers working in firms with 500 or more employees was extracted from the Census Bureau ( Census, 2018 ), and, the number of hospitals was retrieved from the Kaiser Family Foundation ( KFF, 2018 ). We normalized mortality, incidence counts, and other state-level variables (whenever possible) by the yearly state population, obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Since the parity laws do not affect the publicly insured population, we limited the data extraction to individuals between age 25 and 64 as those below and above this age range are covered by Medicaid and/or Medicare.

Section: 4. Results

Table 2 reports the summary statistics. Column (1) reports the weighted means and standard deviations of the log cancer mortality rates by the sites of occurrence for all states and years. Columns (2) and (3) report the means and standard deviations for non-parity states for 2004–2007 and 2008–2017, respectively. Column (4) reports the differences and t-statistics between (2) and (3). Columns (5) and (6) report the means and standard deviations for parity states for 2004–2007 and 2008–2017, respectively. Column (7) reports the differences and t-statistics between (5) and (6). The total number of observations is 714. The number of observations is 308 and 406 for non-parity and parity states, respectively. From Table 2 , it can be observed that there was a general decline in the malignant cancer mortality rates across most types of cancers for parity states after 2008. However, the decline differs across the types. For example, digestive cancer declined by 2.7% in parity states, whereas urinary cancer declined by 4.6% in parity states after 2008. This implies that there may be significant heterogeneity in the impacts of anticancer drug parity laws across cancer types . Table 2 . Summary statistics.

Table 3 reports the estimated impact of anticancer drug parity laws on the log of malignant cancer mortality rates by the sites of occurrence from equation (1) . Columns (1)–(6) of Panel A report the estimates for breast, respiratory, head/neck, digestive, bone/skin/soft tissue, and female genital cancer mortality rates, respectively. Columns (1)–(6) of Panel B report the estimates for male genital, urinary , nervous, thyroid , lymphoid, and ill-defined/multiple sites cancer mortality rates, respectively. The estimates show that the parity laws significantly reduce head/neck malignant cancer mortality rates by 9.0%. No statistically significant impacts were found for other types of cancer. Our estimates imply that the anticancer drug parity laws only significantly affect head/neck cancers, while the laws do not affect other types of cancer mortality. Table 3 .

Tables 4 presents the estimates of the event study from equation (2) for all cancer sites . Panels A and B present the corresponding estimates for each cancer site similar to Panels A and B of Table 3. One year prior to the parity laws is the omitted (or baseline) category. The lead policy terms, such as P a r i t y L a w t − 1 , are statistically insignificant for most of the cancer types. Specifically, the lead policy terms on head/neck cancers are also statistically insignificant as well. This suggests that common trend assumption is unlikely to be violated. Table 4 .

Examining the four lagged policy terms, we observe that the lagged policy estimates of the parity laws on head/neck cancers are statistically significant. According to the lagged policy terms on head/neck cancer, it can be observed that the impacts of parity laws on head/neck cancers are permanent rather than transient. In other words, the implementation of the laws seems to have longer lasting impacts on head/neck cancers. Moreover, the impact seems to get stronger the longer the lag, from 9.7% to 13.3%. The stronger lagged impacts may be the results of more individuals taking up the treatments. To summarize, we do not find evidence that the common trend assumption is violated for head/neck cancers, and we find that the parity laws significantly reduce the mortality for head/neck cancers in the long-run. As a robustness check, we also regress the event study with only parity states, and the results are consistent to these results (see Appendix Tables 9A and 9B in the Supplementary Material).
Table 5 reports the estimates of the falsification tests using the log cancer incidence, non-cancer mortality, and non-malignant cancer mortality rates. Column (1) reports the estimates for the log cancer incidence rate, column (2) the estimates for log non-cancer mortality rates, and column (3) the estimates for log non-malignant cancer mortality rates. Both estimates for cancer incidence and non-malignant cancer mortality are statistically insignificant. The estimate for non-cancer mortality is positive but statistically significant. This seems to suggest that non-cancer mortality is increasing over time. However, it does not alter the conclusion as the signs are not consistent with our main results. These results do seem to indicate that the parity laws are not driven by a decline in log cancer incidence rates. Furthermore, no spurious relationship seems to exist between parity laws, non-cancer mortality, and non-malignant cancer mortality rates. Table 5 .

While our specification controls for private insurance rates, it is possible that the parity laws may affect private insurance rates in the implemented states. Specifically, private insurance may become more attractive to cancer patients in the face of the parity laws since public insurance plans are not subject to parity laws and may not have the same benefits as private insurance. Thus, the implemented states may experience a significant increase in private insurance coverage if such a channel exists. This would change the interpretation of our results since we expect the parity laws to be driven by an increase in the access to treatments rather than the coverage. To test this channel, we regressed private and public insurance rates obtained from ASEC on the parity laws.
Table 6 shows the impacts of the parity laws on private and public insurance rates. Column (1) reports the estimate for the log of private insurance rates, and column (2) reports the estimate for the log of public insurance rates. The estimates on the parity laws are statistically insignificant on both private and public insurance rates. This implies that the parity laws do not cause an expansion in private insurance, nor a contraction in public insurance. Table 6 . Impacts on private and public insurance coverage.

The standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state. * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
Finally, it is possible that our estimates may be picking up a decreasing trend in prices of cancer treatments , specifically for head/neck cancers. While we do not have access to the prices of cancer treatments from states, we searched the information on the prices of head/neck cancer treatments over the period 2010–2018. We found that the prices have increased over time from US$3635.7 million to US$4187.9 million ( National Institute of Cancer, 2020 ). This implies that the parity laws are unlikely to be driven by a decreasing trend in cancer treatment costs.
We conducted additional analyses to check the robustness of our main results (see Supplementary Material). First, we tested the sensitivity of our estimates to alternative inference by clustering by state and year. Appendix Table 4 reports the estimates when clustering by state and year. No significant differences were found between the estimates of the robustness check and the main results. To further check the common trend assumption, we excluded all the never-adopted-parity states from the regression, and Appendix Table 5 reports these estimates. The relationship between the parity laws and malignant cancer mortality by types is still consistent with the main results. To check the sensitivity of our estimates, we used alternative policy coding. We coded parity laws as missing if they were introduced between February and November, instead of using a decimal. Appendix Tables 6 are reported these results. The results are similar to the main results. Alternatively, we used a more precise method by exploiting the monthly changes in cancer mortality rates from CDC mortality files. That is, we aggregated the data by month of mortality, instead of year. This results in approximately 8568 state-year-month cells in the data. We could then run the same regression when the data was aggregated by year. However, this method has one drawback. Some state-monthly cells report 0 deaths, and this would translate into missing when the numbers were transformed them into log mortality rates. Hence, the observations of each estimation result would always be less than 8568 observations. Appendix Table 7 reports the estimates using data aggregated by state, year, and month. The results of robustness checks are similar to the main results. Finally, a paper by Solon et al. (2015) indicated that it is not clear whether or not weighting the estimates is a good idea. To show that our estimates are not sensitive to weighting, we ran unweighted regression. Appendix Table 8 reports the unweighted estimates. No significant differences were detected between these results and the main results. As a final robustness check, we tested the common trend of all states by including the states that implemented parity laws since 2015 into the event study model. Appendix Tables 10A and 10B report the results. The estimates from these tables are similar to our estimates from the main results.
Finally, even though the lead estimates on head/neck cancer from our event study are statistically insignificant, the sizes of the estimates seem to suggest concerns over the presence of some declining trends. The declining trends may be the result of the Medicare Part D (which apply to those under 65 with disabilities and diseases) and the Deficient Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005 occurred between 2004 and 2006 . To assess whether these laws has any impact on our estimates, we first progressively remove pre-2006 years from the estimations and compare them. If the estimate from 2006 to 2017 is significantly differ from the estimate from full sample, it may suggest that the program is driving our policy estimates, not the parity laws. In addition, we implement a lead plus baseline model (equation (1) ) similar to Carpenter et al. (2011) and Nyugen (2014) on 2006–2017 sample to test whether the pre-trend is present or not. All regressions are reported in Columns (1)–(4) of Appendix Table 11 . Overall, the table suggests that the Medicare Part D and the DRA has little impacts on our policy estimates. We observe that the magnitude of the coefficient decline in absolute terms when we drop 2004 and 2005; however, the significance still holds. It would suggest that these laws do decrease the mortality rates, albeit small. In contrast, the estimates using 2006–2017 is still negative and significant, suggesting that the parity laws do have an impact on mortality rates. Moreover, when we implement a lead plus baseline model from equation (1) in Column (4), we observe that the pre-trend estimate is insignificant and trivial in magnitude. This suggests that there is little trend after the exclusion of the periods for these two laws. Overall, we observe that the pre-policy trends may be the result of the Medicare Part D and the DRA, but they have relatively little impacts on the estimate of our parity laws.

Section: 5. Discussion

Our findings shed light on the impact of anticancer drug parity laws on cancer mortality rates. We find that anticancer drug parity laws reduce mortality rates of head/neck cancers in the implementing states. Specifically, the anticancer drug parity laws reduce mortality rates for head/neck malignant cancers and have no impact on cancers of other types. We also rule out the alternative channels that may influence the parity laws and cancer mortality rates, such as insurance expansion and decreasing treatment costs. This implies that the parity laws providing access to more effective treatment are important in reducing cancer mortality. Our results suggest that anticancer parity drug laws have a substantial beneficial impact on population health.
It is notable that the parity laws seem to only affect head/neck cancers only and not the other types. There are several plausible explanations for why the parity laws only affect only one type? First, for some cancers, including head/neck, combination therapies increase the treatment efficiency when compared to solo therapies, and they translate into overall better patient survival ( O'Shaughnessy et al., 2002 ; Raafat et al., 2012 ; Vokes et al., 1989 ). Second, the availability of drugs and other treatments across the various types of cancers will also affect how effective the parity laws are. Breast cancer has a higher number of drug therapies than most of the other types of cancer ( Sun et al., 2017 ). It may be that OADs have substantial costs compared to IADs, but the sheer number of drugs may allow patients to substitute them with combination (or solo) therapies that can yield similar treatment efficiency at a lower cost before the implementation of the parity laws. Thus, even after the implementation of the laws, we would not observe a significant and meaningful impact due to the substitution behaviors before the introduction of the parity laws. Finally, it has been shown that head/neck cancers are increasing for some populations ( Ellington et al., 2020 ). Indeed, the populations that experience increasing head/neck cancers are predominately White or Asian males between 30 and 60. These populations are generally more affluent than other ethnic groups and other age groups, which means that they are more likely to be covered under private insurance schemes (as they have more income) that are affected by the parity laws.
To gauge the impacts of the parity laws, we calculated the implied percent impacts of the laws. We found that the parity laws reduce head/neck cancer mortality between 7.5% and 11.7% relative to the pre-2008 means for individuals residing in parity states (coefficients from Table 3 and Appendix Table 3 ). While there is no research that examines the impact of anticancer drug parity laws on mortality, literature from mental health parity laws can be used to see how plausible our estimates are. Lang's (2013) estimates point to a 2%–5% reduction in suicide rates relative to the means of individuals living in pre-policy mental health parity states. It appears that our implied percentage impacts are much higher than the impacts of mental health parity laws, but they are still plausible. The higher impacts could be attributed to the urgency of the conditions—while an individual may be able to live with poor mental health for several years before committing suicide, an individual who lacks proper treatment can be killed by cancer within months (depending on stages and types). This implies that the anticancer drug parity laws could save those individuals who are dying from (more aggressive) cancers as they may need urgent treatment.
Our study has a limitation. Although we show that our policy estimates are not affected by the Medicare Part D or DRA, there may still exist some pre-existing declining trends that could contaminated our policy estimates. For instance, there may exist some additional policy shocks during the periods which affect public insured under 65 that we cannot eliminate or control. Future studies with access to more disaggregated data (or individual-based data, ideally) are necessary to evaluate the pure effect of the parity laws by focusing on a specific subgroup of insured population (i.e. privately insured).
Our findings are both timely and important. They suggest that parity laws have a significant beneficial impact on cancer mortality rates and are an effective tool for reducing premature cancer mortality if properly implemented. Furthermore, state parity laws have limited impacts in terms of the affected plans, since self-insured firms do not have to comply with these laws, and thus they would only affect a certain segment of the population. That is, only 36% of the total population (58, 511, 500 individuals) may be impacted (calculated by taking the total population between the ages of 25 and 64 during our observational period from 2004 to 2017–163,456,382 individuals—multiplied by the proportion of the population not working in firms with more than 500 employees—49.7%—and by the proportion of the population that was privately insured population—72.1%). Given that less than half of the population is affected, the adoption of a federal parity law could penetrate plans not influenced by the state parity laws and affect the populations in these plans. The adoption of such a law at the federal level would therefore results in greater benefits for cancer patients.
Cancer remains one of the leading health problems in the United States ( CDC, 2016 ). Many current cancer policies focus on changing the health behaviors of individuals to reduce cancer mortality in the population ( Brown et al., 2012 ; Henley et al., 2014 ). Given the beneficial impacts of anticancer drug parity laws, these laws can be effective tools for policy makers seeking to reduce the costs of cancer care, and they represent a useful addition to current cancer policies.
