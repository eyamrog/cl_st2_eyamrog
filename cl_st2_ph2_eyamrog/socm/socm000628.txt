Title: The impact of son or daughter care on Chinese older adults' mental health


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Rationale

The traditional cultural norm in China is that eldercare should be offered by a son and his family. However, several decades of family planning policies and rapid economic growth have led to low fertility rates , urbanisation, and cultural change, resulting in both reduced household size and the availability of sons. The traditional eldercare system is thus being challenged, especially in urban areas, with an increasing number of daughters supporting their parents, enabled by rising female empowerment, formal economic employment and improved financial capacities. Existing studies examine and compare the amount and types of support provided by sons and daughters, but very little is known about the differential health outcomes of parents experiencing eldercare offered by sons and by daughters.

Abstract_Section: Objective

This study investigates the difference in mental health outcomes of parents who receive eldercare from their sons and from their daughters.

Abstract_Section: Method

We analyse waves 2013, 2015, and 2018 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study , with mental health measured by a 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D-10) score. We compare the CES-D-10 score between parents with different sources of care — son's family, daughter's family or other — with multivariate statistical analysis.

Abstract_Section: Results

Receiving regular care from a son (or a daughter-in-law) is associated with a lower CES-D score than from a daughter (or a son-in-law). The difference mainly exists amongst those with a stronger son preference and those who are heavily deponent on their children, in particular rural parents, mothers, and those with less wealth .

Abstract_Section: Conclusion

Our study explores the evidence on mental health inequalities among parents with different sources of care, highlighting that lack of son care creates an apparent mental health disadvantage. Lowering older adults’ dependency on their children may alleviate this inequality by improving their financial independence. We also suggest the development of a long-term care system and greater facilitation of older adults to take-up supplementary services for family care .

Section: 1. Introduction

Despite many changes over the past four decades, family members still provide the majority of eldercare in China ( Chen et al., 2018 ). This is due both to prevalent cultural norms and to lack of an alternative supply of reliable and affordable formal care services ( Li, 2020 ; Whyte, 2003 ; Xie and Zhu, 2009 ). Furthermore, in such a traditionally patrilinear society that has been profoundly impacted by Confucian customs, filial piety is still valued as a core virtue. Providing eldercare for parents remains an expected responsibility of sons ( Lei, 2013 ). As the old Chinese saying goes, ‘a married-out daughter is like spilt water’, daughters join their husband's patriline and take the responsibility of caring for their parents-in-law, weakening the relationship with their natal parents ( Shi, 2009 ). However, recent decades have witnessed the improved nexus between married daughters and their natal parents, and the increasing popularity of parents receiving support from their daughters, especially in urban areas ( Gruijters, 2017 ; Zhang, 2009 ). These changes have been triggered by a complex combination of economic, social, and cultural factors which occurred simultaneously following globalization, economic development, and the introduction of Family Planning Policies ( Gruijters and Ermisch, 2019 ; Yu and Xie, 2012 ; Whyte, 2005 ; Wu and Zhang, 2010 ).
Along with the full implementation of the One-Child Policy between 1980 and 2011, the availability of sons dramatically decreased as part of the general and achieved policy objective of reducing fertility rates ( Lei, 2013 ). Due to this reduction in family size, some families only contained daughters, and human and financial capital investment increasingly and accordingly went to daughters. In addition, China's reforms from 1978 introduced new cultural norms alongside modernisation, contributing to women's empowerment and the dilution of son-preference ( Yan, 2016 ). The unprecedented development of the Chinese economy created numerous working opportunities for both men and women ( Yu and Xie, 2012 ). Those factors drove people to realise the capacity of women outside of family and home care . They also enabled daughters to support their natal parents, and have a negotiation of family duties with their husband and parents-in-law ( Lei, 2013 ; Shi, 2009 ).
China has experienced a rapidly ageing population : the ratio of people aged 65 and over increased from 4.9% in 1982 to 13.5% in 2020 ( National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2021 ), and the target of healthy ageing sits on the top of the government's agenda ( State Council, 2021 ). This reinforces the importance of understanding the current eldercare system, continued son preference for eldercare and the gendered difference in financial capacities.
Mental health and wellbeing are closely related to physical health and have been widely found to be associated with strong family support ( Arsenault-Lapierre et al., 2004 ; Grana et al., 2016 ; Ohrnberger et al., 2017 ; Surtees et al., 2008 ; Waern, 2002 ; Wang et al., 2018 ). In particular, there is now strong evidence that receiving support from children reduces depressive symptoms among older adults ( Buber and Engelhardt, 2008 ; Li et al., 2005 ; Weinstein et al., 2004 ). However, little is known about the gendered impact of care in terms of differences in the mental wellbeing of older parents who receive eldercare from their daughters and from their sons. Within the limited literature, Chen and Short (2008) focused on a group of older adults aged 80 and over in China, finding that living with a daughter was associated with a higher level of mental health than co-residence with a son. However, both Cong and Silverstein (2008) and Liu and Harper (2017) found that older parents' depressive symptoms were reduced by receiving support from their daughter-in-law (son's family) when analysing a sample from rural Anhui.
Recent studies also suggest that in terms of maintaining higher cognitive capacity and reducing mortality risk, older parents benefit more from the emotional care provided by daughters than by sons ( Zeng et al., 2016a ). This was supposedly due to the gender norms in that women were expected to provide better emotional assistance than men, and the conflicts between a daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law which can negatively affect older parents' health. Zeng et al. (2016b) , for example, showed that disabled parents were more likely to be satisfied with the assistance to the activities of daily living (ADLs) if their primary carer was a daughter. The authors also found that daughters were associated with a higher filial piety index and had a better emotional relationship with their parents, consistent with the qualitative research conducted by Shi (2009) .
To address this knowledge gap, this study analysed a nationally representative dataset: the 2013–2018 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). We investigated the divergences in mental health of parents who received support from daughters and from sons.

Section: 2. Conceptual framework and literature review

Cultural norms around appropriate support clearly influence the manner in which such support is measured and judged. This is most clearly recognised in relation to mental wellbeing and psychological and emotional support . In China, the appraisal of kin support in terms of wellbeing outcomes is thus highly dependent on the preference for carer, and the belief in the traditional norm of filial responsibilities ( Chen and Silverstein, 2000 ; Cong and Silverstein, 2008 ; Krause, 2001 ; Zhang and Harper, 2022 ). Based on the Confucian ethic of filial piety, it is the obligation of adult children to support their older parents. Influenced strongly by this traditional patrilineal culture, older parents in China regard their son as the best provider of eldercare ( Cong and Silverstein, 2012 ; Hu, 2017 ). Only sons are allowed to ancestor worship and to carry the family lineage in the patrilinear society. Daughters will join their husband's lineage and undertake the responsibility of caring for their parents-in-law with their husband ( Hu, 2017 ). In exchange for future eldercare, Chinese parents invest a significant amount in their son's education and marriage ( Zuo et al., 2011 ). Given limited resources, in a family with multiple children, parents will spend more on their son's wellbeing than on their daughter's ( Li, 2020 ).
Consistent with cultural expectations, a son and his family are thus responsible for supporting and caring for their older parents (Lin et al., 2003). In practice, daughters also provide care for their natal parents, but this is seen as voluntary support, provided out of love and not out of obligation ( Antonucci et al., 2004 ). Cong and Silverstein (2014) find that son preference among mothers is associated with the patrilinear tradition that sons are more likely to live with and have higher levels of exchange with their parents. The authors also argue that son preference may be more deeply rooted amongst fathers, and that they have strong incentives to maintain traditional values. Gender norms assign housework and caring responsibilities to women, which means that the daughter-in-law is often the actual provider of parental care for her husband's family. Several authors contend that while daughter-in-law care may not always be the best source of support in practice, older parents' mental wellbeing may be negatively impacted by the absence of support from the culturally appropriate source ( Cong and Silverstein, 2008 ; Zhang and Harper, 2022 ). Yet the wider literature on parents' preferences for carers in China is limited. While Cong and Silverstein (2014) argue that parents are more likely to prefer sons over daughters, Hu and Chen (2019) conclude that living proximity and previous support are more important predictors of the preference for carer.
Children's financial capacities determine the quality of eldercare which they can offer to their older parents, which, in turn, impacts parents' wellbeing. Traditionally, Chinese women were not usually financially independent. The married daughter was responsible for labour-based household chores for both her new family and her parents-in-law, in exchange for support for basic needs ( Hu and Chen, 2019 ). Natal parents expected neither financial nor instrumental support from their daughters.
Recent studies suggest that even in some rural areas the impact of modernisation has been profound, with both sons and daughters providing financial assistance to their natal parents ( Luo and Zhan, 2012 ). While there is variation in the amount of financial support provided by sons and by daughters in the literature, all studies show an increase in the contributions made by daughters to their natal parents following the improvement in their socioeconomic status. Indeed, Xie and Zhu (2009) find that married daughters, especially those who are co-resident with their natal parents, provide more financial support than sons.
The impact of change is also reflected by the various results found in the provision of instrumental support by sons and daughters. Cooney and Di (1999) found that married sons were mentioned slightly more often than married daughters as primary caregivers in Shanghai. While Zhan and Montgomery (2003) showed no significant difference between daughters and daughters-in-law either in the total hours spent providing care or in the three types of care: shopping, cooking and personal care. Gruijters (2017) argued that sons provided more practical types of support requiring physical contact. However, Sun (2002) estimated that daughters were up to twice as likely as sons to provide in-kind gifts and services to parents in the city of Baoding.
Of particular relevance to our interest in mental health, fewer studies explore the emotional support provided by children. As we earlier indicated, existing literature consistently shows that daughters provide better emotional care for their parents than sons do ( Shi, 2009 ; Zeng et al., 2016a ). Furthermore, the recent development of mobile technology has enabled a new platform for contact between parents and both their migrant children and their married daughters. Gruijters (2017) suggests that sons physically visit their parents more often while daughters are more likely to keep in touch with parents via other means such as technology, conditional on education level . However, despite such changes in the nexus between daughters and their natal parents, in rural areas at least, the reliance on a son and his family for eldercare still persists ( Cong and Silverstein, 2008 ; Zhang and Wang, 2010 ).
The son preference and gender difference in socioeconomic status are manifestly different in China's urban and rural areas. The Family Planning Policy (One-Child Policy) allowed residents in rural areas to have two children if their first child was a girl ( Hesketh et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the likelihood of having no son was higher among parents living in urban areas. Inequalities in access to healthcare, education, social security and pensions between rural and urban areas have been widely documented, highlighting the relative disadvantage of rural residents ( Cai and Yue, 2020 ; Wang et al., 2019 ; Zhang et al., 2015 ). With less access to public social support in rural areas, older parents' wellbeing relies on the filial piety and the socioeconomic status of adult children to a greater extent than their counterparts in urban areas.
While gender differences in income and education have been significantly reduced by the rapid economic development and the introduction of nine years of compulsory education, especially in urban areas ( Wu and Zhang, 2010 ; Xie and Hannum, 1996 ), there still exist considerable inequalities in education between boys and girls amongst deprived residents in rural China ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). This disparity has resulted in a gap in the financial ability to provide eldercare between sons and daughters in many of these rural areas. It is thus argued that under these conditions, urban elders appear more willing to accept care from daughters, though this is against the traditional cultural norm ( Zhang and Wang, 2010 ).

Section: 3. Research hypotheses

Based on this conceptual framework and the literature review , we set the following four hypotheses regarding the mental health of parents who are cared for by their daughters and sons. We believe there to be a strong gendered component in both the provision and the receipt of care.
The combination of strong son-preferences and the gender difference in socioeconomic status in China formulates our first hypothesis: Hypothesis 1 The mental health of parents who receive care from their sons will be better than those cared for by their daughters. The inequalities between rural and urban areas in the availability of sons, economic development, and access to healthcare, social security and education lead to a stronger son-preference and a more significant gender gap in the socioeconomic status in rural areas. Therefore, we set the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2 The difference in the mental health outcomes of care provided by sons and daughters is larger in rural areas.
Gender ideologies expect women to undertake care of the house and family and men to be responsible for financial issues. Having a lower level of life expectancy, men are more likely to receive support and companion from their partners. Older women are more dependent on their children in later life, especially when they become widowed. Therefore, the quality of support provided by adult children is more influential to the mother's wellbeing than that of father. This quality is determined by children's financial capabilities and their willingness to care for their older adults. The acceptance of different care sources also impacts the way support is appraised. Given the existence of significant gender differences in income and the traditional norm of son's responsibility in the provision of eldercare in China, we set our third hypothesis as follows: Hypothesis 3 The difference in the mental health outcomes of care provided by sons and daughters is stronger among mothers.
Wealthy older adults are capable of affording high-quality healthcare and formal care services by themselves. Compared with older adults with scant resources, they are less dependent on their children's support, and their wellbeing is less likely to be influenced by their adult children's socioeconomic status and filial piety. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 4 The difference in the mental health outcomes of care provided by sons and daughters is weaker among wealthy parents.

Section: 4. Methods

This study analysed waves 2013, 2015, and 2018 of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), focusing on the nationally representative sample of adults aged 45 and over. The dataset provides rich information on family structure, health and employment status, care provider and financial situation ( Zhao et al., 2020 ). The CHARLS dataset was initially launched in 2011. The baseline survey includes information on whether the respondent receives care from any spouse of children but does not indicate which child the spouse refers to. Without this information, we cannot differentiate whether the support provided by a child-in-law is from a daughter's family or a son's. Therefore, we excluded wave 2011 from our analysis.
Waves 2013, 2015, and 2018 of CHARLS include 18,387, 20,899 and 19,755 respondents respectively. Among them, 14,156 individuals participated in all three waves. There exists a significant difference in mental health between those who need support and those who do not and between parents and their childless peers. Older adults with long-term care needs are associated with a lower level of health status , which in turn indicates worse mental wellbeing ( Ohrnberger et al., 2017 ). People with poor mental health are less likely to get married or have a child ( Buber and Engelhardt, 2008 ). Therefore, we focus on participants who are receiving instrumental support, and this process leaves 10,936 observations. Restricting the sample to people who have at least one alive child leaves 10,769 observations.
The calculation of the CES-D Likert scale is based on ten individual questions (more details are given in the section below). Only the individual who provides valid answers for all ten questions is assigned a CES-D score (n = 7,539). To deal with the outlier, we drop the top and bottom 1% distribution of household income which leaves 7,296 observations. There are additional 142, 43, and 6 missing values for education attainment, age, and working status. Our final sample consists of 7,105 observations across 5,366 individuals.
The 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D-10) is applied to measure mental health in this study. The CES-D is developed to assess depression by asking respondents to rate how often they experienced events and ideas linked to depression in the past week, which has been validated among older adults ( Andresen et al., 1994 ; Cheng et al., 2016 ). The CHARLS dataset provides a 10-item measure for CES-D, which includes eight adverse events (feeling bothered, depressed, fearful, lonely, desperate, tired, hard to concentrate and restless) and two positive experiences (feeling hopeful and happy). The four responses for the frequencies of those events during the past week are: 1.) rarely or none of the time (<1 day), 2.) some or little of the time (1–2 days), 3.) occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3–4 days), and 4.) most or all of the time (5–7 days). The values of the four responses range from 0 to 3 for adverse events and 3 to 0 for positive ones. The Likert scale for the CES-D-10 ranges from 0 to 30. A higher scale represents more depressive symptoms for the respondent. We use the term ‘depressive symptoms’ only to refer to mental health outcomes when interpreting our empirical findings.
CHARLS collects information on the primary carers of respondents with the following question: Who most often helps you with dressing, bathing, eating, getting out of bed, using the toilet, controlling for urination and defecation, doing chores, preparing hot meals, shopping, managing money, making phone calls, taking medications?
If the respondent is looked after regularly by more than one person, he or she is allowed to report up to three primary carers. We categorise the respondents (n = 7,105) based on their relationships to the primary carers as following: 1) parents cared for by their son (n = 1,773): at least one of the primary carers is the respondent's son (or daughter-in-law), and none of the primary carers is the respondent's daughter (or son-in-law), 2) parents cared for by their daughter (n = 684): having at least one daughter as the primary carer and none of the primary carers is the respondent's son, 3) parents cared for by both their daughter and son (n = 627): primary carers include at least one son and one daughter, 4) parents cared for by other relationships (n = 4,021): none of the primary carers is the respondent's child or child-in-law. The care structure is displayed in Fig. 1 . Parents in groups 1–3 could also receive care from other people, e.g., spouse, in addition to their child. We set dummy variables for the four groups of parents: CaredbySon , CaredbyDaughter , CaredbyBoth and CaredbyOther , respectively.

To compare mental health among parents who are cared for by their son and daughter, we set the following model: (1) C E S – D i , t = β 0 + β 1 C a r e d b y S o n i , t + β 2 C a r e d b y D a u g h t e r i , t + β 3 C a r e d b y B o t h i , t + β 4 C o n t r o l s i , t + u i + u t + ε i , t
C E S – D i , t is the Likert scale of the 10 items of CES-D for individual i in year t . CarebySon i,t , CaredbyDaughter i,t and CaredbyBoth i,t are the dummy variables indicating the relationship between the respondents and their primary carers as discussed above. The group of parents who are cared for by others rather than their children ( CaredbyOther = 1) is the reference in this model. C o n t r o l s i , t are other determinants for the mental wellbeing identified in the literature: family structure, gender, age, education attainment, marital and employment status, and financial situation ( Li et al., 2005 ; Buber and Engelhardt, 2008 ). u i u t and ε i , t represent the individual-specific effects, the business cycle effect, and the idiosyncratic error term respectively.
For a robustness check, we restrict our sample to respondents who only receive care from their daughters and parents who are looked after only by their sons. We estimate the equation as follows: (2) C E S – D i , t = β 0 + β 1 O n l y S o n C a r e i , t + β 2 C o n t r o l s i , t + u i + u t + ε i , t
O n l y S o n C a r e i , t is a dummy variable, equal to one if individual i only receives regular care from his or her son in year t and zero otherwise. The reference group is parents who are looked after only by their daughter.
Random-effects models are applied to estimate Equations (1) , (2) to account for unobserved individual-specific heterogeneity, which is commonly used for panel data. This estimation is appropriate for a sample such as CHARLS which is randomly drawn from the population ( Baltagi, 1995 ). This method investigates the changes in the variables over time by transforming the dataset with quasi-demeaning, eliminating the effects of omitted variables that vary across individuals but are constant over time. A strong assumption of the random-effects model is that the difference among individuals is random, and uncorrelated with the explanatory variables ( Greene, 2008 ). An alternative model for panel data — a fixed-effects estimator — relies on a less strict assumption that the unobserved differences among individuals are time-invariant, which is preferable. However, our primary independent variables on care structure rarely change over time in our sample, in which case the fixed-effects estimators are biased and inefficient ( Cook et al., 2020 ). Therefore, we deploy random-effects estimators in our study.

Section: 5. Results

Table 1 displays the sample characteristics. Among those who have at least one alive child and receive instrumental support (n = 7,105), 56.59% of them (n = 4,021) are looked after by their spouse or other relatives or friends rather than their children. The average age of our sample is 64.61, 37.27% of them are male, 80.41% of the whole sample are married, and 15.52% of them are widowed. The educational attainment of the entire sample is low: only 36.83% of them completed primary school. The majority of the sample live in rural areas, with 31.74% dwelling in urban areas. Compared with parents who are cared for by their children, those cared for by others are more likely to be male and married, complete primary education and less likely to be widowed. Table 1 .

Among those looked after by their daughters, 43.71% of them do not have an alive son, and they have 2.1 daughters and 0.89 sons on average. In contrast with parents who are cared for by their son, they are younger (64.02 vs 66.49) and more likely to be married (71.20% vs 63.45%), finish primary school (37.28.10% vs 27.92%), and live in urban areas (39.33% vs 28.88%), reporting a higher CES_D score (12.82 vs 11.42).
Table 2 displays random-effects estimates for equations (1) , (2) ), comparing depressive symptoms of parents cared for by their son and daughter. Parents cared for by their daughters report a 0.6796 higher CES-D score than those looked after by others (Column 1). In contrast, the CES-D score of parents with at least a son as a primary carer is 0.4925 lower than people cared for by others. The P -value of the F -test on the equality of the coefficients on CaredbyDaughter and CaredbySon is 0.0002. The result confirms that the CES-D of parents cared for by their son is statistically lower than those looked after by daughters. Consistently, the second model (Column 2) shows that parents who only receive care from their son report a 1.0674 lower CES-D score than those only cared for by their daughters. A CESD-10 score of 12 has been identified as a valid threshold to diagnose depression among older adults in China ( Cheng and Chan, 2005 ). The average CES-D score for the group of parents taken care of by daughters is 12.79 in our sample. One-point lower score is associated with a significant reduction in depression risk.

Table 3 shows the heterogeneity across the difference in depressive symptoms of parents cared for by sons and daughters in rural and urban areas. The CES-D scores are similar among parents who are taken care of by their children and those who receive care from others in urban areas (column 1). However, in rural areas, the CES-D score for parents with their daughter as a primary carer is 0.7761 higher than people cared for by others (column 2). Urban parents who are only looked after by their sons report a similar CES-D score as those cared for only by their daughters (column 3). But parents who only receive care from their sons report a 1.5761 lower CES-D score than those cared for only by daughters in rural areas (column 4). Table 3 .

Table 4 compares depressive symptoms of parents cared for by their sons and daughters among mothers and fathers. The relationships between men and their primary carers are not statistically associated with their depressive symptoms (columns 1 and 3). However, mothers benefit from the care provided by their sons in terms of reducing depressive symptoms. Compared with those who are looked after by others rather than their children, the CES-D score is 0.5325 lower for mothers cared for by their sons and 1.1802 higher for those cared for by their daughters (column 2). Mothers who only have their sons as primary carers report a 1.8099 lower CES-D score than those who are only looked after by their daughters (column 4). Table 4 .

Table 5 exhibits depressive symptoms of parents who are cared for by their sons and daughters among groups with different levels of wealth . Participants whose household wealth is in the top 25% of the distribution are defined as wealthy parents, and the remaining are categorized as less wealthy. The depressive symptoms of wealthy participants are not influenced by the relationship with their primary carers (columns 1 and 3). However, compared with those cared for by others, the CES-D score is 0.8151 higher for less wealthy parents cared for by their daughters, but similar to parents looked after by their sons (column 2). Column 4 consistently shows that parents who only receive care from their sons report a 1.1521 lower CES-D score than those only cared for by their daughters in the less wealthy subsample. Table 5 .

As a robustness test, we investigate the self-reported health, risky health behaviour and engagement in social activities among parents cared for by their daughters and sons (see Table A2 in Appendix). The results show that the odds ratios of having risky health behaviours and no engagement in social activities are not impacted by the source of care. However, the odds ratios of reporting poor health are found to be higher among parents who are cared for by their daughters than those looked after by their sons. The health status is more dependent on the support parents receive from their children compared to engagement in social activity and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. As shown in the literature ( Ohrnberger et al., 2017 ), health status is an essential determinant of mental wellbeing. Living with a carer may be more convenient and even beneficial to older parents’ wellbeing, as it creates an environment for older adults to have their needs met in a timely way as they arise. However, older parents are more likely to live with their sons than their daughters due to historical cultural expectations. For those reasons, we also conduct a robustness test where self-reported health and co-residence with a son or daughter who is the primary carer are included as control variables (see Tables A3-A4 in Appendix). The results consistently show that the mental health of parents benefits from the care provided by their son (and daughter-in-law).

Section: 6. Discussion and conclusion

Traditional norms of son preference have weakened in recent years, and a growing number of parents receive care from their daughters ( Gruijters, 2017 ; Zhang, 2009 ; Zhang and Harper, 2022 ). We find that older parents have better mental health (fewer depressive symptoms) if their primary carers are sons compared with daughters and others. This difference mainly exists among rural areas, women, and parents with limited resources.
Our Hypothesis 1 that older parents' mental health benefits more from eldercare provided by their sons than their daughters cannot be rejected. This could be explained by the traditional norm of son preference and the gender disparity in the socioeconomic statuses which determine adult children's capacity to support older parents. Important here is that the appraisal of support is more influential to the wellbeing of older parents than the actual support ( Cong and Silverstein, 2014 ; Lee et al., 2010 ). In China, the traditional norm that a son is the best provider of eldercare is deeply rooted amongst older parents, especially in rural areas ( Jiang et al., 2016 ; Li, 2020 ). Although daughters make a significant contribution to the family, and some studies even show that daughters are more filial than sons, living with or close to a son is still predominant among older adults in China, reflecting the persistence of the son-preference ( Gruijters and Ermisch, 2019 ; Shi, 2009 ; Zeng et al., 2016 ; Zhang, 2004 ). Therefore, older parents are satisfied when a son and his family provide them with eldercare and meet their expectations, improving their mental wellbeing.
The gender gap in income and education also leads to the difference in the quality of care which sons and daughters are able to provide to their older parents. In a patrilineal society, parents invest more in their sons ( Davies and Zhang, 1995 ; Hu, 2017 ). Gendered ideologies predict that women are expected to take care of family and house, reducing their time to participate in labour markets (Smith et al., 2020). Those gender differences in human resources and family responsibilities contribute to a lower level of earnings among daughters ( Rosenfeld and Kalleberg, 1990 ). Due to the limited access to formal care systems, older adults are heavily dependent on their children financially, instrumentally, and emotionally ( Cong and Silverstein, 2008 ; Zimmer, 2005 ). Their wellbeing will be improved if their children are able to provide them with a better living environment and higher quality food and healthcare services, noting that sons are more financially capable.
Our results highlight that the difference in wellbeing of parents cared for by sons and daughters is stronger in rural areas, and therefore we could not reject our Hypothesis 2 . Compared with urban areas, son preference is stronger, and older parents are more dependent on their adult children in rural areas. Rural parents were allowed to have two children if the first one was a daughter under the Family Planning Policy, leading to a higher fertility rate and higher proportion of son births ( Hesketh et al., 2015 ; Li and Wang, 1994 ). As the availability of sons is lower among urban parents, they are more likely to be willing to receive care from their daughters ( Zhang and Wang, 2010 ). Furthermore, in rural areas, access to healthcare, pension schemes and other public support is less available, and parents rely on their adult children to a greater extent. However, as we have previously noted, the gender difference in socioeconomic status which still exists in the rural areas ( Zeng et al., 2014 ), is closing in urban areas characterised by a lower fertility rate , deeper modernisation, and a more rapid economic growth.
We also attempt to show that son advantages in providing care are stronger among mothers and parents with less wealth (consistent with our Hypotheses 3 and 4). The likelihood of being widowed is higher among mothers than fathers as the life expectancy from birth is 79 for women and 74.5 for men ( United Nations, 2019 ). The gender ideology that women are better at caring, combined with the gender difference in life expectancy, implies that fathers are more likely to receive companion and support from their partners, which lowers men's dependency on their adult children. In addition, parents with sufficient resources are able to afford high-quality healthcare and social care products and services by themselves in order to supplement insufficient family care , and their wellbeing is less dependent on financial capacity and filial piety of their adult children.

Section: 7. Limitations and strengths

Our study suffers the following limitations. First, the representativeness of the CHARLS sample implies that our findings can be only generalized to Chinese parents aged 45 and over and who already need ADL and IADL assistance. Along with the closing gender gap in socioeconomic status and deeper modernisation, those who need care in the future may be less impacted by the source of care. Second, due to the limited sample size, we are not able to distinguish parents who were influenced by the One-Child Policy from those who were not (cohort effect). The traditional norm of son preference is possibly stronger among the former type of parents.
Third, our analysis can only be interpreted as causal under the assumption of strict exogeneity of care providers. However, there are omitted variables due to data limitations such as the quality of care, the willingness of caring for parents, the proximity between children and their parents and so on. Those variables may influence both the wellbeing of the parents and the actual provision of care. For instance, older parents who have a son but receive care from their daughter may have conflicts with –– or feel ignored by –– their sons which lowers their mental health. Furthermore, due to limited data, we cannot investigate the mechanisms behind the difference in the mental health of parents cared for by their sons and daughters: son preference or the gender gap in financial capacity. This can be tested with income, education attainment, and other socioeconomic variables of the carer and the measurement for the social norm (e.g., son preference).
Despite these limitations, our analysis utilised nationally representative longitudinal data and controlled for unobserved individual effects with random-effects estimators. Even if our results cannot be interpreted as causal, the association between mental health and the source of care identifies people whose mental health is disadvantaged. Among the limited number of existing literature which examined health outcomes of eldercare provided by daughters and sons, CLHLS was largely used with only one primary carer nominated ( Zeng et al., 2016b ; Zhu, 2015 ). In comparison, our measurement for the care provider with CHARLS captured a fuller picture of care structure and avoided the underestimation of the contribution made by others apart from the person who provided the most support.

Section: 8. Conclusion

Population ageing , low fertility rates, and urbanization all challenge China's traditional care system, where children and in particular sons have been expected to provide eldercare. We provide evidence for inequalities in mental wellbeing where older rural adults with an absence of care from sons perceive themselves as disadvantaged, leading to an increase in depressive symptoms. With such a rapidly ageing population, developing a sustainable and reliable long-term care system, in addition to improving healthcare and pension schemes is critical for a healthy ageing progress.
Our study suggests that lowering dependency on adult children might be an effective solution to reduce mental health inequalities among parents with different care sources. This could be achieved by developing a comprehensive social security net including health care and pension systems. We also recommend developing the long-term care system through providing reliable, diverse and affordable care services. Many older adults are still reluctant to live in nursing homes as they regard it as stigmatic and in violation of cultural expectations ( Luo et al., 2018 ) and prefer to use other formal care services. Therefore, encouraging and assisting older adults in accepting and seeking external care is important. It is also critical to improve financial literacy among older adults and guide and help them use financial instruments to build private pensions. Our results which imply the existence of regional disparities suggest that promoting the development in rural areas is vital to reducing health inequalities.
