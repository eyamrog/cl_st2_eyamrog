Title: The impact of women's off-farm employment on depressive symptoms: Evidence from rural China


Abstract: Abstract

While China's economy has grown rapidly in recent decades, urban-rural inequalities in mental health have persisted, and depression is more prevalent among rural women. Using a nationally-representative survey data in China, this paper investigates the impact of women's off-farm employment on their depressive symptoms. Results from instrumental variable and individual fixed effects estimation show that women's participation in off-farm employment leads to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. We further take into account the confounding effects of working conditions, and the main results are robust. Moreover, off-farm employment enhances women's mental health mainly through pathways including increased absolute income, higher self-perceived relative income, more frequent healthy behaviors, increased likelihood of health investment, and obtaining more formal social support . Further evidence suggests that the depression-reducing effect of off-farm employment is more effective for those with more severe depressive symptoms, middle-aged and elderly persons, and women with lower body mass index . The findings have important implications for preventing depressive disorders and improving mental health in China and other developing countries.

Section: 1. Introduction

In spite of the rapid economic growth in China, mental health problems have been increasing over the past few decades, and depression has become one of the most prevalent mental health disorders. A study based on the 2012 national household survey showed that the prevalence rate of depression is very high, with 37.9% for depressive symptoms and 4.1% for depression ( Qin et al., 2018 ). During the period from 1990 to 2017, the all-age prevalence rate of depression per 100,000 increased from 3224.6 to 3990.5; in 2017, more than 56 million people were suffering from depression, accounting for 21.3% of the global cases ( Ren et al., 2020 ; Bai et al., 2022 ). Meanwhile, urban-rural inequalities in mental health are particularly evident in China, where depression prevalence is significantly higher among rural residents than urban ( Purtle et al., 2019 ). Depression has been recognized as a major cause of low quality of life , disability, and death, and these negative consequences tend to occur in women since women are more likely to be depressed compared to men. For instance, suicide has become China's fifth leading cause of death, accounting for 26% of all suicides worldwide, and depression-related suicide is more prevalent among rural women than men ( Cui, 2009 ; Hou et al., 2015 ). Against this background, we investigate the impact of women's off-farm employment on depressive symptoms in rural China, which may have important implications for preventing depressive disorders and improving mental health in China and other developing countries.
While the term of depressive symptoms is commonly used in the literature, there is still no universally agreed definition of depressive symptoms due to the plurality of different patterns of mood disorders. According to studies in epidemiology and public health , depressive symptoms can be seen as a person's depressed mood characterized by feeling sad, poor concentration, low self-worth, and a loss of pleasure or interest in activities during a specific period ( Ayuso-Mateos et al., 2010 ; Ren et al., 2020 ; Bai et al., 2022 ). There is no doubt that these characteristics are strongly correlated to risk factors in both physical and mental health. However, it should also be noted that socioeconomic factors, such as employment status and working conditions, have been found to be associated with individual symptoms of depression, and differences in social and economic circumstances may lead to health inequities ( Pugliesi, 1988 ; Bromberger and Matthews, 1994 ; Zimmerman and Katon, 2005 ; Allen et al., 2014 ).
Despite many empirical studies revealing a negative association between employment and depressive symptoms, the employment-depression relationship is hard to interpret its causality because of omitted variables as well as the presence of a bidirectional link between employment and health. To our knowledge, especially in developing countries, the causal effect of off-farm employment on depression is yet to be known. Hence, our paper contributes to the existing research by taking into account endogeneity that might bias the estimates. In order to address this issue, we employ an instrumental variable (IV) approach to data from the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey, which not only provides information on individual employment status and mental health but also enables us to identify plausible instruments for off-farm employment behavior among rural women. The data also allow the extension of the analysis to test whether the inclusion of village-level socioeconomic characteristics as additional control variables influences the IV parameter estimates. Another contribution of this paper is that we explore more thoroughly how off-farm work participation impacts women's depressive symptoms through important pathways including income effect, health behavior, and social support . This analysis offers a better understanding of these mechanisms underlying the health effect in the off-farm labor market .

Section: 2. Conceptual framework

The determinants of a person's mental disorder like depression include different conditions in which people live and work, involving a wide set of explanatory factors: economic, physical, and social environments ( Allen et al., 2014 ). As well demonstrated in many countries, higher rates of depression are generally found among women compared to men in the general population ( Goodwin and Gotlib, 2004 ; Van de Velde et al., 2010 ). In China, due to the considerable income gap between urban and rural areas, the risk factors of depression are more prevalent for rural women than their urban counterparts ( Li et al., 2016 ). Through off-farm employment, rural women receive better socioeconomic conditions that may result in increased psychological well-being or self-satisfaction. In what follows, we discuss possible pathways for how women's off-farm employment participation may impact their depression symptoms: income effect, health behavior, and social support .
First, women's off-farm employment may positively influence their mental health as it leads to higher income levels. In the rural areas of developing countries, social security systems are ill-functioning; working in non-farm jobs is therefore of greater importance to the household economy and family members' welfare, and the income effect tends to be more salient. It is well acknowledged that a high income can decrease financial hardship and allows people to obtain better healthcare, housing, schooling, and recreation, and higher-income jobs also provide greater social prestige and a more favorable work environment ( Zimmerman and Katon, 2005 ). These contribute to a lower risk of anxiety and depression disorders. However, the income-depression relationship is not always negative at a high level of income. This may be attributed to the fact that higher incomes lead to an increased expectation for people to satisfy their material and spiritual needs, which in turn impede happiness or subjective well-being ( Bartolini and Sarracino, 2015 ). Additionally, as income increases, a “relative income” effect may dominate the relationship between income and well-being since people tend to compare their own income with that of others ( Ferrer-i-Carbonell, 2005 ). Recent studies have suggested that in addition to absolute income, relative income is also recognized as a crucial factor in determining the likelihood of individual depressive symptoms ( Osafo Hounkpatin et al., 2015 ; Song and Kim, 2020 ). Thus, it is necessary to distinguish the effects of absolute income and relative income when examining the impacts of off-farm employment on depression.
Second, off-farm employment and the associated changes in socioeconomic status (SES) may also affect health behaviors, such as frequency of drinking, smoking status, physical exercise , and health investment, which are directly related to both mental health and quality of life . Socioeconomic disparities in health behaviors indicate that people in higher SES groups more often act in ways that benefit their health than lower SES groups ( Pampel et al., 2010 ). Specifically, those with higher SES are more aware of the health hazards associated with unhealthy behaviors and are thus more likely to avoid lifestyle risk factors like alcohol drinking and tobacco smoking ( Layte and Whelan, 2009 ). Moreover, the living and working conditions of higher social class groups help to develop higher levels of self-efficacy ( Bandura, 1977 ), which may promote individual physical exercise and associated health investment. It has been argued that Chinese women working on farm are generally associated with disadvantaged SES and less healthy behaviors ( Zhang et al., 2018 ; Shen et al., 2022 ), off-farm employment has been viewed as an important role in empowering women and enhancing their SES and this is likely to lead to better behaviors and health maintenance.
Third, as rural women increasingly engage in off-farm employment, it provides access to valuable resources and information and brings about a broad range of social supports. Such supports can be in the form of formal support (e.g., union and professional training) and informal support (e.g., contacts with friends). On one hand, among those families in rural areas, women are more likely to have limited access to health and education resources due to the lack of social support. Formal support derived from off-farm employment is particularly important in strengthening women's human and social capital, which can reduce the risk of depression. On the other hand, off-farm employment provides opportunities to meet and develop relationships with friends or co-workers, an informal support which may be lacking for women in farm work ( Pugliesi, 1988 ). The importance of informal support networks is demonstrated by many studies; people with a wide range of networks may have a low level of depression because they can obtain more support (social and emotional) by interacting with members of social networks, which is conducive to coping with stress and alleviating loneliness ( Berkman et al., 2000 ; Singh et al., 2016 ). Overall, previous research has documented the social support benefits of employment and has shown the importance of social support in alleviating the symptoms of mental disorders ( Pugliesi, 1988 ; Hellgren and Chirumbolo, 2003 ; Qiu et al., 2011 ; Cao et al., 2015 ).
To summarize the discussion above, it is plausible that off-farm employment has a direct effect on depressive symptoms, and may also have indirect effects on depressive symptoms through pathways including income effect, health behavior, and social support. Based on the argumentation framework, we propose the hypotheses as follows: Hypothesis 1 Women's off-farm employment participation is associated with reduced depressive symptoms. Hypothesis 2 Income effect, health behavior, and social support are the main pathways through which off-farm employment affects women's depressive symptoms.

Section: 3. Data and variables

The data used in this study come from the China Labor-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), collected by the Center for Social Science Survey at Sun Yat-sen University: a nationally representative sample of the Chinese workforce aged 16 and above, and uses multi-stage, stratified probability proportional-to-size (PPS) sampling to draw data on approximately 400 communities from 29 provinces. In order to ensure high-quality data, the CLDS adopts Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) techniques in its fieldwork ( Fig. A1 displays the example of CAPI system interface). All enumerators must be trained before conducting the formal survey. After data collection, the data management center is responsible for verifying the quality and validity of survey data. Two advantages of using this data set for the current study. First, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) has been administered to record the respondent's symptoms of depression, which allows us to use CES-D as an important tool for identifying the depression level of Chinese rural women as well as the link between off-farm employment and depression. Second, CLDS provides a rich set of information regarding working conditions, including variables such as hours worked per week and commute time, as well as a wide variety of variables focusing on health characteristics and behaviors. This information could help us to control for those work- and health-related variables that may confound estimates of the effect of employment.
The purpose of this article is to examine how women's off-farm employment affects their depressive symptoms. To do so, the 2016 and 2018 waves of data were used in the main analyses here because 2016 and 2018 were the only two waves for which the full CES-D was administered to the sample; this information was not recorded in other survey years. We consider the sample where women living in rural areas with an agricultural Hukou , which is the household registration for identifying whether an interviewee is a rural citizen ( Shen et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, we excluded observations from those who were not working (unemployed, in school or training, or on maternity leave) to ensure that the sample reflected the depression levels of active labor force participants. The final sample in our analysis consists of 6941 observations; the numbers of cases in farm work and off-farm work are 4885 and 2,056, respectively.
The CES-D, originally developed by Radloff (1977) , is used to measure depressive symptoms. Since its high reliability and validity, the CES-D has been widely used in many countries to measure the depression in the general population, including adolescents, adults, and older people ( Zimmerman and Katon, 2005 ; Wada et al., 2007 ; Vilagut et al., 2016 ). Additionally, evidence shows that the CES-D is a valid and reliable instrument among rural women, migrant workers , and mid-aged and older adults in China ( Qiu et al., 2011 ; Lei et al., 2014 ; Hou et al., 2015 ). The CLDS used the Chinese translation of CES-D, which contains 20 items regarding different aspects of depressive symptoms experienced in the previous week ( Table A1 ). These 20 questions describe a list of negative feelings. The answers for CES-D are on a four-scale metric to indicate the frequency of symptoms (0 = rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day), 1 = some or a little of the time (1–2 days), 2 = occasionally or a moderate amount of the time (3–4 days), and 3 = most or all of the time (5–7 days)). A total score ranging from 0 to 60 is obtained after adding up the scores of each item. Higher scores indicate greater depressive symptoms. Table A2 reports a standard validation exercise using the CLDS data. The Chronbach's alpha is 0.946, implying a reasonable level of internal consistency.
The off-farm employment has been synonymously used with terms like ‘non-farm’, ‘non-agricultural’, or ‘non-traditional’ work in the non-farm sectors ( Barrett et al., 2001 ). According to Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2001) , the non-farm sector comprises all economic activities in rural areas except agriculture , livestock , fishing, and hunting . In addition to this definition, off-farm employment is also defined as local non-farm self-employment, local non-farm wage employment, and migrant employment ( Zhang et al., 2018 ; Van den Broeck and Kilic, 2019 ). The CLDS contains a wide range of data about respondents' employment. All respondents were asked, “What is your current working status?” If they engaged in any work activities with labor income, they were further asked, “Is this a full-time job that requires you to work at least 35 h each week?” and “Which type of sectors does your job belong to?” Based on these questions, the CLDS dataset created a variable to reveal the specific main job types for each respondent, including farm work (work activities in agriculture, forestry , livestock, fishing, and hunting), non-farm self-employment, and non-farm wage employment. Combining previous studies and this work, the variable for off-farm employment equals one if the respondent was currently working a full-time job in non-agricultural sectors (non-farm self-employment or wage employment), and zero for those who mainly engaged in farm work.
The demographic characteristics of women include age, education, marital status, ethnic identity, and availability of social security. Age is a continuous variable that has been found to be associated with depressive symptoms, but the age-related pattern of depression varies among young, middle-aged, and older adults ( Mirowsky and Ross, 1992 ). Education represents the respondent's years of formal schooling completed. Marital status includes two dummy variables: married women coded 1 if respondent is currently married and divorced women coded 1 if respondent reported ever having been divorced. Ethnic identity is measured by a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the respondent was from an ethnic minority group. Social security programs may alter financial incentives regarding emotional health and happiness ( Cheng et al., 2018 ; Tran et al., 2017 ). We capture this effect by two measures: a social health insurance dummy (1 if the respondent was covered by any type of social health insurance) and a public pension dummy (1 if the respondent participated in the governmental pension scheme).
We control for a set of household characteristics. Intra-family relationship reflects the emotional relationship between members within the family, which can shape certain self-perceptions and, in this way, affect individual psychological well-being ( Lennon and Rosenfield, 1992 ). This variable is coded on ten-point scales ranging from “1 = very indifferent family relationships” to “10 = very close family relationships”. Considering rural women as the primary caregivers for their families, the number of children (under the age of 6 years) and the number of older adults (65 years of age and above) are included in the regression models to account for the effects of caregiving burden on symptoms of depression. Additionally, household non-labor income (RMB) and farmland size (total area of farmland owned by households) are used to control for family economic conditions .
We also consider individual health characteristics that have been found to be strong predictors of depression symptoms ( Williamson and Schulz, 1992 ; Blay et al., 2007 ). Two measures are used to reflect women's health status: a dummy variable coded as 1 if the respondent reported her health status in poor condition, and a dummy variable coded as 1 if hospitalization in the past year due to illness. In addition to health status, we examine the effects related to obesity by including body mass index (BMI). Past research has shown that BMI is observationally associated with the prevalence of depression and the association tends to be stronger in women than men ( Tyrrell et al., 2019 ). We further control for several environmental characteristics including air pollution, noise pollution, and secondhand smoke exposure. Air pollution and noise pollution are measured by respondents' evaluation of the level of air pollution and noise pollution in the place they live (1 = not serious at all, 2 = not too serious, 3 = relatively serious, 4 = very serious). Secondhand smoke exposure is assessed through self-report information to evaluate the level of women's exposure to secondhand smoke ( Xiao et al., 2010 ; Yang et al., 2015 ). Respondents were asked, “How many days per week are you exposed to smoking (exposure for at least 15 min per day)?” A total of five options were available for this question: 1 = never, 2 = less than one day, 3 = between one and three days, 4 = between four and six days, 5 = almost every day.
Moreover, we control for working conditions that may confound estimates of the effect of off-farm employment on depression. Based on previous studies, we include a set of variables describing the different aspects of working conditions, such as job autonomy , co-worker relationships, long working hours, and commute time ( Cottini and Lucifora, 2013 ). Job autonomy is a summary indicator composed of the extent workers are allowed to make decisions on their own in the following three items: job content, working arrangement, and work intensity . Responses to each item were assigned three options, where 1 = totally decided by others, 2 = partly decided by myself, 3 = totally decided by myself. Scores for the three items were summed and ranged from 3 to 9 with higher scores indicating greater job autonomy. Co-worker relationships are measured by respondents' assessment of their satisfaction with co-worker relations (”1 = very dissatisfied” to “5 = very satisfied”). Long working hours takes value of 1 if the respondent's working hours per week are more than 40 h. Commute time is a continuous variable and was defined by the number of minutes per day spent in commuting between home and workplace.
According to the theoretical analysis detailed before, we explore the following possible working pathways to depressive symptoms that off-farm employment operates on: income effect, health behavior, and social support.
Two types of income effect are studied separately on which off-farm employment might influence: absolute income and relative income. The absolute income is measured by the natural logarithm of annual labor income at the individual level. In our data set, labor income consists of income from farm work, self-employment, and wage employment. The latter two are increasingly important components of labor income in the Chinese rural context. The relative income is measured by self-perceived relative income for different reference groups, which could provide more comparison information concerning the relationship between relative income and individual mental health ( Goerke and Pannenberg, 2015 ). Respondents were asked to assess their income in comparison to the following people: (a) relatives, (b) friends, (c) neighbours, (d) other residents in the county. Responses to each item were assigned a five-point scale, ranging from ‘‘1 = much lower’’ to ‘‘5 = much higher’‘. The relative income is based on four items that are combined to create a summed score.
We investigate the impact of off-farm employment on several important health behaviors including drinking, smoking, physical exercise , and purchasing private health insurance . Drinking is measured by the response to the question, “How many days per week do you usually drink alcohol last year?” (1 = never, 2 = one or two days, 3 = three or four days, 4 = more than five days). Smoking represents current smoking status which is a dummy variable coded as 1 if the respondent smokes now. Physical exercise is defined by the frequency of participation in the most common physical exercise per week, for example, jogging, bicycling, swimming, and ball games. Purchasing private health insurance reflects the investment in health and takes value of 1 if respondent reported purchasing any type of private health insurance.
We differentiate social support into two dimensions: formal support and informal support. Formal support that operates within the context of institutional nature tends to provide services through professional knowledge and skills; while informal support relies on individual social networks, for example, family, relatives, and friends ( Lipman and Longino, 1982 ; Baig and Chang, 2020 ). In our study, union presence (dummy = 1 if women are working in a workplace where there is a trade union) and professional training (dummy = 1 if women had received professional training for at least five days in the past year) are considered as indicators of formal support. We measure informal support by receiving help from friends and talking to friends. These two variables are created based on the responses to the questions “How many close friends you can receive help or support from them?” and “How many close friends you can talk to them what is on your mind?” (1 = none, 2 = one to five friends, 3 = six to nine friends, 4 = ten friends or more).

Section: 4. Empirical strategy

Formally, a linear regression model is used to estimate the association between off-farm employment and depressive symptoms: (1) Y i j t = β 0 + β 1 O f f F a r m i j t + X i j t ′ φ + θ D t + δ P j + μ i j t where Y i j t denotes the depression outcome of women i living in province j in year t . O f f F a r m i j t is the key independent variable for whether women participated in off-farm employment, and its coefficient β 1 is our main interest, revealing the effect of off-farm employment on the outcome variable. X i j t is a vector of control variables reflecting demographic characteristics, household characteristics, health characteristics, environmental characteristics, and working conditions. D t and P j are a full set of year and province dummies, which account for time-period and regional fixed effects .
The empirical challenge in identifying the causal effect is that the explanatory variable of interest, off-farm employment, is likely to be endogenous because of omitted variables and reverse causality problems. For example, individuals who are more outgoing and sociable might be more likely to participate in off-farm labor and experience less depression. Conversely, healthier farmers might tend to use off-farm employment to improve household economic conditions and increase investment in human capital for family members. These two scenarios would result in an overestimation or underestimation of employment's effect on one's level of depressive symptoms. This potential endogeneity can be avoided by employing an instrumental variable approach, where off-farm employment is instrumented appropriately. The IV identification strategy requires that our instruments are not correlated with unobserved characteristics but that they sufficiently explain the endogenous variable. Specifically, we need to find instruments that are correlated with changes in the main explanatory variable (off-farm employment), but not with the outcome variable (depressive symptoms). We use two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regressions to identify our IV estimates. The corresponding first stage equation of the 2SLS estimations is: (2) O f f F a r m i j t = α 0 + α 1 D i s t a n c e i j t + α 2 E n t e r p r i s e i j t + X i j t ′ φ + γ D t + ω P j + ε i j t where D i s t a n c e i j t , an instrument for off-farm employment, represents the distance (km) between the village respondents live in and the nearest county. This instrument is relevant as a high correlation with convenience to access to information and labor markets and the cost of participation in employment. Evidence from developing countries has shown that village locations matter for rural residents' off-farm employment, and distance to the county explains an important share of the variance in the probability of employment participation ( Jonasson and Helfand, 2010 ; Zhu and Luo, 2010 ). To explain the non-migrant workers who engage in non-agricultural activities in local villages, we introduce the second instrument, E n t e r p r i s e i j t , which is measured by the number of enterprises within the administrative area of the village. It should be highly relevant because the establishment of enterprises in a village may create a greater incentive for local rural residents to participate in off-farm work; the earnings of industrial labor can be substantially higher than that of farm work as well as investments in human capital provided by companies in the form of formal job training. The increase in the number of businesses will offer more employment opportunities and promote the growth of informal-sector that are related to non-farm activities ( Parikh and Thorbecke, 1996 ).
While we can test the exogeneity restriction by including two instruments for off-farm employment, the exogeneity of IVs is needed for more description and explanation. We argue that the instruments used in this study are plausibly exogenous. Village settlement is determined by the importance of suitable land for cultivation, market access, proximity to water, and road network connectivity and is not influenced by individual depression symptoms. Also, enterprises choose their location based on factors such as land rent, transportation network, labor cost , and natural resource endowment and are not influenced by people's levels of depression. It should be noted that the validity of IV relies on the assumption of exclusion restriction, which means the instruments impact women's depression only via their off-farm employment. However, results from IV estimation might be sensitive to the exclusion restriction. It is likely that those villages with more surrounding businesses and close to the county perform better economic conditions and infrastructural facilities, and thus residents tend to have higher levels of health and well-being. To ensure that no other variable explains the impact of distance to the county and number of enterprises on women's depression other than off-farm employment, we include a rich set of key controls related to village socio-economic characteristics such as village income per capita, village interpersonal relationship , access to piped water, health clinics, community parks, and childcare facilities. These village-level variables were created based on the village questionnaire, and village leaders answered detailed survey questions. Village income per capita represents the annual income per capita in the village (RMB). Village interpersonal relationship is measured by respondents' evaluation of the statement, “How harmonious is the relationship between villagers” (1 = “very bad” to 5 = “very good”). Dummy variables are used for whether the village had access to piped water, health clinics, community parks, and childcare facilities. The definitions of all variables in this study are provided in Table A3 .

Section: 5. Results

Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the main variables in this study. In the full sample, the average score of CES-D depression is 8.75. The mean values of age and education are 48.2 years and 6.5 years, respectively. Approximately 90% of respondents are married and 5.8% of them had been divorced. The proportion of respondents from an ethnic minority group is 10.4%. More than 90% of women are covered by social health insurance , and 64.9% of them participate in a public pension scheme. On average, household non-labor income is 3005.2 RMB and household farmland size is around 7 mu. In terms of health characteristics, about one out of five women report having poor health and 9.3% of women had been hospitalized previously. The average BMI of the sample is 22.6, being within the normal weight range between 18.5 and 24.9. For working conditions, the average scores of job autonomy and satisfaction with co-worker relations are 7.783 and 3.694, respectively. Over half of the women in the sample report working long hours and the average of commute time per day is 29.2 min. Table 1 . Summary statistics of main variables (Mean or %).

The results suggest a significant difference (p < .05) in women's depressive symptoms. Women with an off-farm job have lower CES-D scores than those engaging in farm work activities (7.119 versus 9.437). In addition to the depression outcomes, other covariates differ by employment status. For example, respondents participating in the off-farm labor market are younger, more highly educated, and report better intra-family relationships and higher household non-labor income. The proportions of married, divorced, ethnic minority, social health insurance, public pension, self-reported poor health, and hospitalization among women working off-farm are significantly smaller, while women with off-farm employment tend to experience more serious environmental problems (air pollution and noise pollution), lower job autonomy, and longer working hours.
Table 2 presents the estimation results using OLS models that assume off-farm employment to be exogenous and IV models with distance to the nearest county and number of enterprises as instruments for off-farm employment. Results for OLS models are reported in Panel A. In the basic regression model that does not include any control variables (model (1)), off-farm employment is significantly associated with a 2.318 reduction in CES-D scores. This suggests a lower level of depressive symptoms for rural women with an off-farm job than that those working on farms. When introducing demographic, household, health, and environmental characteristics (models (2)–(4)), while the size of the estimated effect becomes smaller, the negative association between off-farm employment and depression remain significant. Models (5) and (6) show similar results; women's off-farm employment is negatively and significantly associated with their depressive symptoms after controlling for a set of variables related to working conditions as well as year and province fixed effects .

Robust standard errors are presented in parentheses. In the IV regression models, distance to the nearest county (log) and number of enterprises are used as instruments for off-farm employment. Full results are reported in Table A4 and Table A5 .
Results for IV models show a similar pattern, as reported in Panel B. Off-farm employment participation leads to a reduction in depression scores, and the causal effects are robust to the specifications that account for other potentially confounding variables. According to models (6) and (12) that include a full set of controls, off-farm employment is associated with a decrease of 0.767 in the CES-D scores for OLS estimates and a decrease of 5.122 for IV estimates. This implies an underestimation of the depression-reducing effect in the OLS regression models, which may result from a reverse causal relationship between individual mental health and labor decisions. The difference between the OLS estimates and the IV estimates indicates the importance of using the IV strategy to address the endogeneity of women's employment behaviors.
The validity of an instrument relies on two conditions: relevance and exogeneity. We first examine the correlation between the distance to the nearest county, number of enterprises, and women's participation in off-farm employment. In order to do so, we provide the first-stage estimates for different controls of IV models in Table 3 . Results show that the association between distance to the nearest county and employment participation is significant and negative, which is related to a lower tendency for women to enter the off-farm labor market if they live in a village far from the county. The number of enterprises is significantly and positively associated with the likelihood of off-farm employment among rural women; an increase of ten units in the number of enterprises in the village area raises the probability of employment by 2–7 percentage points. The values of the first stage F-statistic for IV are much higher than the value of 10 for weak identification and the critical value of 19.93 for 10% IV size, indicating that the chosen instruments are not weak and explain the variation in off-farm employment.

Robust standard errors are presented in parentheses.
We next examine the exogeneity of our instruments. While the exogeneity condition cannot be empirically tested, we perform an auxiliary analysis proposed by Nguyen et al. (2016) to understand the relationship between the instruments and outcome variable. In this case, we need to regress the outcome on the instruments and endogenous variable. It is plausible that the instruments would not have a direct effect on depression outcome if we control for the effects of women's off-farm employment. Table 4 shows the results for examining the validity of instruments. In model (1), we regress the CES-D scores on the instruments without adjustment for off-farm employment. The estimated coefficients are 0.237 for distance to the nearest county and −0.011 for number of enterprises, respectively. In model (2) that adjusts for off-farm employment, the effects of the instruments on depression are weaker. Estimated coefficients on distance to the nearest county (0.211) and number of enterprises (−0.009) decrease by 11% and 18.2%, respectively, and both of them are not statistically significant at the five percent level. Table 4 . Examination of the validity of instruments.

Robust standard errors are presented in parentheses. Other control variables include demographic characteristics, household characteristics, health characteristics, environmental characteristics, and working conditions.
Another possible threat to the exogeneity of instruments may be due to a violation of exclusion restriction—the endogenous variable may not be the only channel through which the instrumental variable affects the outcome of interest. It could be the case that socioeconomic levels appear to be higher for villages close to the county. Women from those villages located closer to counties might have better health outcomes just because of the socioeconomic benefits due to proximity to urban locations rather than non-farm work. Therefore, we run the same set of models with adjustment for a set of village-level covariates including village income per capita, village interpersonal relationship , and rural infrastructure (access to piped water, health clinics, community parks, and childcare facilities). As shown in model (3), the estimates of two instruments remain unchanged. These results suggest that it is off-farm employment rather than village socio-economic characteristics that serve as the key channel through which the instruments influence women's levels of depression. Furthermore, we check whether the results of the IV model are sensitive to adjustment for the village-level covariates. We find that the results in model (4) are similar to the main results in Table (2). Again, the value of the first stage F-statistic is higher than ten, and the Hansen J statistic fails to reject the null hypothesis of exogenous instruments. Off-farm employment's effect on depression remains negative and significant, implying that our IV results are not driven by the village's socioeconomic characteristics.
In addition to the specification checks for the instrument validity conditions, we provide several additional robustness checks. Fig. A2 shows the distribution pattern of CES-D scores in the study sample. As can be seen, the CES-D scores are nonnegative integer values and not normally distributed, and have a relatively large number of zero scores (approximately 19.8% of the total sample). For this reason, we regress the CES-D scores on off-farm employment and other covariates using count-data models, which account for the distribution of counts and outcome variables with excessive zeros.
Table A6 presents the results from a set of count-data regression models including Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), Zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB), and all regressions exhibit a negative link between off-farm employment and depression. According to the p values of LR test of alpha = 0 and Vuong test, the assumption that the distribution is equi-dispersed and the number of zeros is not inflated should be rejected. Therefore, the ZINB regression model is preferred. As shown in model (4), the estimated coefficient on off-farm employment indicates a 0.915 decrease in the scores of CES-D symptoms, which is similar to the result of OLS estimation in model (6) of Table 2 . This suggests that the main results are robust to the CES-D scores characterized by a distribution of zero-inflated count data.
One more threat to the estimated results may come from potential bias related to individual unobserved heterogeneity. While this problem can be resolved using an instrumental variable approach, the consistency of the estimators relies on the exogeneity of the instruments that is difficult to validate. An alternative method to address this concern is the individual fixed effects (FE) model, which could eliminate the unobserved heterogeneity using within estimator in the panel data regression and require no exclusion restrictions for the identification of instruments ( Cseh, 2008 ; Peng et al., 2016 ). Table A7 presents the results from individual FE regression analyses with and without control variables. In our preferred specification where controls for different characteristics and year fixed effects are added to the regression model, participation in off-farm employment is significantly associated with a 2.234 reduction in the scores of CES-D (model (5)). It can be seen that the estimates which account for individual fixed effects are also larger than their OLS counterparts. Hence, without consideration of the endogeneity problem , the OLS estimates in regard to the impact of off-farm employment on depression are indeed underestimated.
Considering that working conditions may have an important role in workers’ mental health, we seek to check whether the effect of off-farm employment on depression varies across working conditions. The interaction terms of off-farm employment and each of the working conditions variables are added to the regression models with OLS estimation techniques. Fig. 1 displays the average marginal effects of off-farm employment by working conditions. We can see that when the level of job autonomy increases from low (3) to high (9), the estimated effects do not change substantially, and the results are basically in the range between −4 and 0. Similar patterns are found in other working conditions like co-worker relationships, working hours per week, and commute time per day. These results imply that the depression-reducing effect of female off-farm employment is not moderated by their specific working conditions.

Confidence intervals are set to 95 percent level.
We next examine the effect on diagnosed depression. Due to the data limitations in CLDS, we run this complementary analysis using the sample (2011, 2013, and 2015 waves) from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which is a nationally representative of the Chinese population of age 45 and above. For more details about the dataset, see Zhao et al. (2014) . In our study, diagnosed depression is measured by a binary variable that equals 1 if the respondent has ever been diagnosed with psychiatric problems by a physician and equals 0 otherwise. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed depression is 2.9%, and a significant difference between farm work (3.1%) and off-farm employment group (1.6%). Estimation results for regression models are reported in Table A8 . Off-farm employment is found to be significantly associated with a 0.7–1.1% reduction in the probability of diagnosed depression based on OLS and Probit regression . However, results from individual FE and IV regression do not indicate a causal impact on diagnosed depression, suggesting that the effect on diagnosed depression is largely confounded by endogeneity concerns like unobserved individual-specific heterogeneity or reverse causality.
Based on the theory discussed before, we further explore multiple potential pathways through which off-farm employment impact women's depressive symptoms. Table 5 presents the estimation results for the income effect of women's off-farm employment participation. OLS results show that off-farm employment is positively associated with personal absolute income and relative income, with the estimated coefficients of 1.163 and 0.663, respectively. After accounting for the potential endogeneity, IV results show a larger effect of women's off-farm employment on their absolute income and relative income. Moreover, the F-statistic from the first stage regression is greater than 10, which rejects the null hypothesis of weak instruments. These results suggest that the increased income from off-farm employment plays a key role in the reduction of depression among rural women. Table 5 .

Table 6 reports the results for women's off-farm employment and their health behaviors. The OLS estimates show that women's participation in off-farm employment is associated with more frequent physical exercise and a higher likelihood of purchasing private health insurance . Similarly, results from IV regression models imply a positive effect of off-farm employment on the frequency of physical exercise and the likelihood of purchasing private health insurance . Meanwhile, IV estimates show a reducing effect of off-farm employment on the likelihood of current smoking. However, the Hansen J-statistic of over-identification cannot be rejected for the IV regression on smoking, suggesting that the causal effect on smoking behavior might be sensitive to the violation of instrument exogeneity. In terms of drinking behavior, both OLS and IV results do not indicate a significant relationship between women's employment and the frequency of drinking alcohol. Table 6 .

Table 7 presents the results for off-farm employment and social support. For formal support, estimates in the OLS models show that women engaging in off-farm employment are more likely to work in workplaces with a union presence or to receive professional training. IV estimation provides evidence for a causal relationship: off-farm employment increases the probability of women's working in the presence of a union by 12.2% and the probability of receiving professional training by 21.3%. Hansen J-statistic tests also support the validity of the instruments in the IV regression models. For informal support, neither OLS nor IV estimates reveal a significant effect on the number of friends for women to receive help and talk to. These results on social support suggest that off-farm employment is more likely to work through formal support rather than informal support to prevent depressive symptoms for women in rural China.

In this section, we discuss the heterogeneous effects of off-farm employment on women's depression by different levels of symptoms, age, and BMI . Table 8 presents the estimates of quantile regression (QR) and IV-quantile regression (IVQR) from the 15th quantile to 85th quantile of CES-D scores. Both QR estimates (Panel A) and IVQR estimates (Panel B) show a decline in women's depression and a larger magnitude of point estimates for higher quantiles, implying that the depression-reducing effect of employment is more effective for those women who have poorer mental health. This variation may be related to the fact that women with higher depressive symptoms may face more financial constraints and have great needs for economic status. Therefore, the income effect of off-farm employment is stronger, and it results in a greater improvement in psychological well-being for women with a high level of symptoms. Table 8 .

Robust standard errors are presented in parentheses. Control variables include demographic characteristics, household characteristics, health characteristics, environmental characteristics, working conditions, and year and province fixed effects. In models (6)–(10), distance to the nearest county (log) and number of enterprises are used as instruments for off-farm employment.
Panel A of Table 9 reports estimates stratified by age group, and it suggests that off-farm employment has a heterogeneous effect on depressive levels between younger and older cohorts. Among women aged above 40 years, participation in off-farm employment is significantly associated with a decrease of 0.893 in the CES-D scores for OLS estimates and a decrease of 4.741 for IV estimates. Compared with the older group, the estimated effects in the OLS and IV models are not significant for women aged 40 years or below. One possible reason is that the prevalence of depression symptoms, associated with personal age and health status, is more pronounced in the older than in the younger group, so improvement in depression resulting from employment participation may benefit the elderly more in this regard.

As shown in Panel B of Table 9 , the effects on depression also differ between individual BMI (low and high group divided by the mean of BMI). OLS and IV models indicate that women with low BMI have a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms when they participate in off-farm work. In contrast, regardless of the estimation approach, employment has no significant effects for women with a high level of BMI, and the magnitudes of the results are smaller. Given that higher BMI is likely to increase the likelihood of developing depression ( Tyrrell et al., 2019 ), considerations of such population groups are needed for the development of effective preventive and therapeutic interventions.

Section: 6. Conclusion and discussion

This paper attempts to fill the gap of existing research concerning the link between employment and depression by providing the causal impact of off-farm employment on depressive symptoms in a developing context. Results from IV estimation and FE estimation show that women's participation in off-farm employment leads to a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. We further take into account the confounding effects of working conditions (job autonomy, co-worker relationships, working hours, and commute time), and the main results are robust. Our findings extend the previous studies regarding the relationship between employment and depression ( Bromberger and Matthews, 1994 ; Zimmerman and Katon, 2005 ), by demonstrating that off-farm employment plays a significant role in preventing depression among rural women from less developed regions. Moreover, off-farm employment enhances women's mental health mainly through pathways including increased absolute income, higher self-perceived relative income, more frequent healthy behaviors, increased likelihood of health investment, and obtaining more formal social support. Further evidence suggests that the depression-reducing effect of off-farm employment is more effective for those with more severe depressive symptoms, middle-aged and elderly persons, and women with lower BMI.
The findings have several important implications for policymakers. First, off-farm employment can be considered as an effective way to improve women's mental health, and thus public policies to support female participation in the off-farm labor market are essential. Second, we do not find evidence for a causal effect of off-farm employment on diagnosed depression. Therefore, policies to remove obstacles (e.g., medical costs and institutional barriers) for the access to mental treatment and care should not be ignored either, especially in the rural areas of many developing countries where mental health services are quite limited. Third, formal social supports derived from workplace are important mechanisms by which employment affects depression. This may provide valuable information for policymakers seeking to encourage employers to implement workplace health promotion programs that will improve workers' health and well-being. Fourth, heterogeneous effects highlight the necessity of public health interventions among disadvantaged populations, particularly among women with high BMI who tend to suffer from poorer health outcomes as a result of high BMI or psychological impacts of obesity.
Although we conduct a series of robustness checks, one limitation in the present study is that, due to the data limitations, we are not able to fully control for the specific occupational risk factors that are likely to influence the employment-health relationship. Workplace exposure to pesticides, radioactive materials, organic solvents, and other chemicals may be associated with a higher level of depressive symptoms. We argue that omitting these factors would not cause a bias in our estimates, because a set of individual health, environmental characteristics, and working conditions have been accounted for. Introducing additional occupational risk factors may lead to a “bad control” problem, and would induce bias in our estimates. Nonetheless, more empirical research on this matter, with other data sources containing more detailed information on risk factors for depression, is needed to further strengthen our findings.
