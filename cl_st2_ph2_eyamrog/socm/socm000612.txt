Title: Mobile phones, women's physical mobility, and contraceptive use in India


Abstract: Abstract

Women's economic and social empowerment is facilitated by their ability to move around independently and safely. However, in many developing countries women's physical mobility is restricted by social norms, structural impediments related to poor quality of roads and transport systems, and security issues. Restrictions on female physical mobility and low levels of empowerment can also have negative implications for women's access to healthcare services. Mobile phones could help connect women to information and social networks and thus also strengthen their bargaining power within the household. Here, we use nationally representative data from 39,523 women in India collected in 2011–12 to analyse associations between women's use of mobile phones and selected indicators of female autonomy and empowerment. Results indicate that women's mobile phone use is positively associated with their physical mobility range and use of non-surgical contraceptives , whereas it is negatively associated with surgical contraceptive methods. We also analyse to what extent these associations are influenced by other socioeconomic and cultural factors. Our findings suggest that mobile phones can play an important positive role for women's empowerment in India.

Section: 1. Introduction

Women's economic and social empowerment is facilitated by their ability to move around independently and safely. However, in many developing countries women and girls are restricted in their physical mobility by religious norms, class-hierarchies, cultural expectations, and tasks to perform within the household. Furthermore, structural barriers, such as inadequate infrastructure and transport systems, and security concerns, including the fear of sexual harassment, often exclude women from public spaces. Such mobility constraints can have serious negative implications for women's ability to access education , healthcare services, and employment ( Amin, 1997 ; Balk, 1994 ; Duflo, 2012 ; Dyson and Moore, 1983 ; Jejeebhoy and Sathar, 2001 ; Klasen, 2018 ; Muralidharan and Prakash, 2017 ). The increasing spread of mobile phones in many developing countries could help to overcome some of these constraints and better connect women to social networks, markets, and public services ( Barboni et al., 2018 ). Better access to information and knowledge may also increase women's independence and decision-making power within the household ( Kabeer, 1999 ). Here, we use nationally representative data from India to analyse whether women's use of mobile phones is positively associated with their physical mobility and use of contraceptives . Both physical mobility and use of contraceptives are important indicators of female autonomy and empowerment, especially in the context of India where issues of gender inequality and discrimination are extensive.
A broad body of literature from low- and middle-income countries has shown that mobile phones positively affect market access and efficiency as well as incomes, education, and other dimensions of human welfare ( Aker et al., 2012 ; Aker and Fafchamps, 2014 ; Beuermann et al., 2012 ; Fu and Akter, 2016 ; Jensen, 2007 ; Landmann et al., 2021 ; Manacorda and Tesei, 2020 ; Muto and Yamano, 2009 ; Parlasca et al., 2020 ; Rajkhowa and Qaim, 2022 ; Shimamoto et al., 2015 ; Tadesse and Bahiigwa, 2015 ; Torero and von Braun, 2006 ). Evidence also suggests that mobile phone-based health-care interventions can improve the delivery of health services ( Castaño et al., 2012 ; Dammert et al., 2014 ; Hall et al., 2014 ; Lester et al., 2010 ; Noordam et al., 2011 ; Zurovac et al., 2011 ). However, there are relatively few empirical studies that have looked at mobile phone effects through a gender lens ( Barboni et al., 2018 ; Billari et al., 2020 ; Jennings and Gagliardi, 2013 ; LeFevre et al., 2020 ; Mohan et al., 2020 ; Rotondi et al., 2020 ; Sekabira and Qaim, 2017 ). The few existing studies suggest that mobile phone use is positively associated with women's decision-making power and financial autonomy, but they also show that women's access to mobile phones is often restricted ( Mohan et al., 2020 ). Access restrictions for women to use mobile phones are not only due to income constraints, but also to strict gender and social norms in many societies. Various studies highlight that woman are often not allowed to use a mobile phone at all, or sometimes they are supervised when calling, in fear of promiscuous behaviour or the violation of traditional norms ( Allendorf, 2013 ; Alwi et al., 2021 ; Arora and Scheiber, 2017 ; Bell, 2006 ). Gendered gaps in mobile phone use are more pronounced in India than in most other parts of the world ( Barboni et al., 2018 ).
To fully participate in the modern economy, women must have access to phones and be able to use them independently. Studies suggest that reducing the gender gap in mobile phone use could improve women's autonomy and their access to healthcare services ( Barboni et al., 2018 ; Billari et al., 2020 ; LeFevre et al., 2020 ), but empirical evidence remains scant. There is one empirical paper that analyses the association between mobile phone use, women's decision-making about contraception, and the actual uptake of modern contraceptive methods with macro-level data from a large number of countries and micro-level data from sub-Saharan Africa ( Rotondi et al., 2020 ). We are not aware of related work with micro-level data from India. The relationships could be different in India, not only because of pronounced gender inequality but also because female surgical sterilization is much more widespread in India than elsewhere. Furthermore, we could not identify any studies, either in India or elsewhere, that examine how mobile phones are associated with women's autonomy in physical movement.
Here, we add to the existing literature on women's use of mobile phones and female autonomy in three ways. First, using nationally representative data from the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS) we analyse the association between mobile phone use and female physical mobility. Second, we examine the association between mobile phones and the use of contraceptives, differentiating between surgical and non-surgical methods. Third, in addition to average patterns, we analyse to what extent the associations differ by socioeconomic context, looking at women's education , household wealth , and caste, among other factors. We use various regression models and robustness checks to control for confounding factors as much as possible.
The rest of this article is organised as follows. The conceptual framework is discussed in section 2 . The survey data and the empirical approaches are described in section 3 , while the results are presented and discussed in section 4 . Section 5 concludes.

Section: 2. Conceptual framework

In India and other countries of South Asia, it is common practice for women to exclude themselves from public spaces due to social norms that put a high moral value on female ‘honour’ and safety from sexual harassment and violence ( Jayachandran, 2015 ). As a symbolic gesture of seclusion, women often cover their faces and bodies in front of people outside their families. The practice of veiling is called the ‘purdah’ system. Various forms of veiling exist where women cover either their face or their whole body, using ‘Ghungat’, ‘Burkha’, or ‘Pallu’ ( Bennett, 1992 ; Papanek, 1973 ). Although the practice of veiling is synonymous with ‘purdah’, the purdah system can take many forms. In its most extreme form, purdah involves complete segregation between men and women and the prohibition of women to leave the premises of their homes. In less extreme forms, women are required to cover their face and body post-puberty or post-marriage, and physical mobility outside the house is permitted, either with or without accompany by a male family member ( Amin, 1997 ; Anderson and Eswaran, 2009 ; Dyson and Moore, 1983 ; Jejeebhoy and Sathar, 2001 ; Papanek, 1973 ).
Often, families are motivated to limit women's physical mobility by the belief that women should be modest, submissive, docile, and connected to their homes ( Lei et al., 2019 ). In modern India, not all households follow the traditional purdah system. The exact boundary where a woman can move and function independently often varies by economic status and the household's place in the caste hierarchy ( Bennett, 1992 ). Existing studies suggest that the practice of purdah is sometimes associated with wealth , as relatively richer households can better afford to withdraw women from the labour market ( Papanek, 1973 ). However, the IHDS data we use in this study suggest that women from the lower wealth groups are more likely to follow the purdah system ( Table A1 in the Online Appendix).
Restrictions on female physical mobility directly affect women's economic and social participation but can also have wider negative implications for women's access to healthcare services ( Dyson and Moore, 1983 ; Jejeebhoy and Sathar, 2001 ). The maternal mortality rate ― an important healthcare indicator― is higher in India than in many other countries with similar mean income levels ( WDI, 2021 ). Around two-thirds of all maternal mortality in India is due to bleeding and infection after childbirth , high blood pressure during pregnancy, and complications from delivery and unsafe abortions. Further, unintended pregnancies are the primary cause of death amongst adolescent girls. Preventive healthcare interventions include improved information about family planning and better access to contraceptive methods. However, cultural norms, lack of access to information, and restrictions on women's mobility can lead to low use of non-reversible contraceptives .
Family planning policies in India have historically relied on female sterilization rather than reversible non-surgical contraceptive methods ( Tingey et al., 2017 ; Visaria et al., 1999 ). There is a need to improve access to information regarding the availability of reversible methods, particularly for women who want to postpone or space their pregnancies but aren't ready to undertake a non-reversible measure ( Ewerling et al., 2018 ). Increased access and use of reversible contraceptive techniques are expected to help reduce maternal and infant mortality , as well as population growth by extending birth intervals ( Kulathinal et al., 2019 ).
Mobile phones can affect women's physical mobility and use of contraceptives through different pathways. First, mobile phones may assure households that they can connect with their female member, even if she leaves the house alone, thus relieving safety and security concerns, which are often one important reason for restricted female physical mobility. Second, and relatedly, mobile phones may also give women a sense of personal safety when leaving their home without male company. Third, mobile phones can be an important device to access information about various topics, including reproductive health and contraceptive methods ( Castaño et al., 2012 ; Rotondi et al., 2020 ). Such information can come through official information campaigns, which sometimes use mobile phone-based text messages for distribution, or through individual communication with social networks and/or healthcare workers.
Mobile phones may also indirectly improve women's bargaining power within the household through channels such as increased financial independence, better labour-market opportunities, obtaining freedom, expanding social networks, and increased decision-making power— including more autonomy in terms of physical mobility and a greater say in family-planning decisions ( Horst and Miller, 2005 ; Masika and Bailur, 2015 ; Murphy and Priebe, 2011 ; Rotondi et al., 2020 ; Suri and Jack, 2016 ). The literature on intra-household bargaining shows that women's bargaining power increases with credible threat points ( Lundberg and Pollak, 1993 ; Manser and Brown, 1980 ; McElroy and Horney, 1981 ). Threat points are not only influenced by individual control over financial resources but also depend on access to knowledge and information, bargaining skills, and the ability to mobilize interpersonal networks ( Fafchamps et al., 2009 ; McElroy, 1990 ). Mobile phones could play an important role for women in this respect, especially in the context of India where women's physical mobility is often restricted due to cultural norms and security concerns. It should also be mentioned that village exogamy is common in India, meaning that women tend to leave their community after marriage. Mobile phones may offer women improved opportunities to communicate with natal family and friends, even over longer distances. This could also strengthen women's self-confidence and thus their threat points and intra-household bargaining power.

Section: 3. Materials and methods

We use the second round of the nationally representative Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), which was conducted in 2011–12 ( Desai and Vanneman, 2012 ). Unlike the first round of IHDS, which was conducted in 2004–05, the second round includes individual-level data on mobile phone usage. The data do not include information on individual ownership of mobile phones. Hence, usage of a mobile phone can mean that the particular woman either owns a phone herself or can at least access and use one owned by another family member for her own purposes.
In IHDS-II, interviews were conducted with over 42,000 households in rural and urban areas. The questionnaire included household-level and individual-level modules. Since data on physical mobility and contraceptive use were only collected for women who were ever-married, we use data from 39,523 ever-married women for the analysis. The data include information on various sociodemographic household characteristics as well as individual-level education, physical mobility, health, fertility, family planning, and mobile phone use. Ethical approval for our study was not required, as we use an existing dataset available in the public domain. The dataset includes details on human subjects that have been anonymised.
The two outcomes of particular interest in this study are women's physical mobility and their use of contraceptives. Physical mobility is measured through an index that we construct by using women's answers to four different binary survey questions that measure women's autonomy in movement. These questions are: (i) Can you visit health clinics alone? (ii) Can you visit relatives or friends at their home alone? (iii) Can you visit a grocery store alone? (iv) Can you travel a short distance by train or bus alone? For the construction of the index, we calculate the unweighted average of all 0/1 answers for each individual woman. Hence, the mobility index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating higher physical mobility. The same approach of averaging over several binary variables was used previously to create indexes of women's autonomy ( Eswaran and Malhotra, 2011 ; Jensen and Oster, 2009 ). As a robustness check, we create an extended mobility index (“composite mobility”) that includes women's answers to three additional survey questions capturing their geographic travel range: (i) Have you been to a village, town, or city besides your current residence during the last five years? (ii) Have you been to another state during the last five years? (iii) Have you been abroad during the last five years?
The second outcome variable, use of contraceptives, is measured using a binary variable indicating whether an individual woman who was not pregnant during the time of the survey used any form of contraception to delay or prevent pregnancy. In one version, we use a single binary variable for any contraceptive method, including reversible (non-surgical) and non-reversible (surgical) ones. In a second version, we further disaggregate and use two binary variables that indicate (i) whether a woman uses non-surgical contraception (condoms, oral pills, copper T/intrauterine devices (IUD), diaphragms, or any other reversible method) and (ii) whether a woman underwent surgical contraception (sterilization or hysterectomy).
To estimate the association between women's mobile phone use and women's physical mobility, we estimate linear regression models of the following type: (1) where is the physical mobility index for woman i living in village j . The main explanatory variable of interest is , which is a binary variable indicating whether women i uses a mobile phone regularly. A positive and significant coefficient would confirm our hypothesis that mobile phone use is positively associated with women's physical mobility.
To reduce the influence of confounding factors we control for a large set of variables that may jointly influence mobile phone use and the outcomes. is a vector of individual characteristics of woman i , such as her age, education, mother's and spouse's education, and whether or not she practices purdah. includes variables that control for household characteristics, such as household size, religion, caste, asset ownership, amount of land cultivated, and sex, age, and education of the household head. Further, we control for regional differences through a vector of district fixed effects . This allows us to control for unobserved geographic differences such as regional cultural factors, levels of economic and IT infrastructure development, or information campaigns targeted at specific regions. in equation (1) is a random error term. We cluster standard errors at the village level. For a few households, data from more than one woman were collected in the IHDS dataset. Since households are nested in villages, within-household clustering is already taken care of by village-level clustering of standard errors.
To estimate the association between mobile phones and women's use of contraceptives, we estimate probit models of the following type: (2) where is a binary variable that takes a value of 1 if a woman who was not pregnant during the time of the survey used any form of contraception to delay or prevent pregnancy. For this analysis, we only include women of reproductive age (15–49 years). The other variables are as defined above. We are particularly interested in the coefficient . A positive and significant coefficient would confirm our hypothesis that women's mobile phone use is positively associated with the use of contraceptives. However, the results may possibly differ by contraceptive method. Therefore, in additional models, we redefine and look at non-surgical (reversible) and surgical (non-reversible) contraceptive methods separately.
We interpret our results as associations, not as causal effects of mobile phone use. Rigorous causal identification is difficult with the data available, because women's mobile phone use is not randomly allocated, meaning that in equations (1) , (2) is possibly correlated with the error term. One way of addressing this issue is to use an instrumental variable (IV) approach ( Wooldridge, 2010 ). However, finding a valid instrument that is correlated with and uncorrelated with the outcomes variables is difficult. We tried mobile phone use by women in the same village and age cohort as an instrument, building on the fact that local social networks often play an important role in innovation adoption decisions ( Bandiera and Rasul, 2006 ; Maertens and Barrett, 2012 ). We discuss this instrument and related tests in more detail in the Online Appendix B . The instrument passes common tests of instrument validity, and the IV models even lead to larger mobile phone use coefficients, which is reassuring ( Tables B1 and B2 ). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out with certainty that village-level mobile phone use does not correlate with the outcome variables through other indirect mechanisms. Hence, we report the IV results but refrain from causal interpretation.
In addition to the average associations estimated with equations (1) , (2) , we also analyse heterogenous associations based on various individual and household characteristics, such as woman's education, belonging to a socially disadvantaged caste, or household wealth. We estimate heterogenous associations using regression models of the following type: (3) where is the outcome variable of interest (women's physical mobility or use of contraceptives), and is one of the mentioned individual or household characteristics that is interacted with (note that is also included in or ). The other variables are as described above. Here, we are particularly interested in the coefficient . A positive (negative) and significant would indicate that the mobile phone association with the outcome variable increases (decreases) with characteristic .
In one specification of equation (3) , we also differentiate between woman practicing and not practicing purdah. It could be argued that purdah is too closely correlated with women's physical mobility, one of our two outcome variables, so that it should not also be included on the right-hand side of equation (3) . However, as explained above, the purdah system can take different forms and does not always mean completely restricted mobility for women. Hence, it is interesting to see whether mobile phones may possibly also influence the autonomy of those women who are following the purdah system.

Section: 4. Results and discussion

Summary statistics of women's mobile phone use, their physical mobility, and their use of contraceptives are shown in Table A2 in the Online Appendix. According to the data, 43% of all women in India used a mobile phone in 2011–12. As expected, this proportion was lower for women from poor households (27%) than for women from non-poor households (47%) ( Table A3 ). Differences in mobile phone use are also observed between women from households practicing (40%) and not practicing (48%) the purdah system. These differences in the use of mobile phones are statistically significant ( Table A3 ).
The mean mobility index of 0.69 for the whole sample means that on average only 69% of the four mobility questions were answered positively by the female respondents ( Table A2 ). Women in poor and purdah-practicing households are more restricted in their mobility than their counterparts in non-poor and non-purdah households. In terms of contraceptive use , 74% of all women use any contraceptive methods, again with certain differences across the subsamples.
Fig. 1 provides further insights into the use of different contraceptive methods. Of all women who used contraceptives at the time of the survey, two-thirds had undergone female sterilization or hysterectomy , 9% used oral pills, copper T, or diaphragm, and 8% used condoms. As mentioned, India has a long history of female sterilization as the main method of contraception to reduce fertility and population growth ( Ewerling et al., 2018 ; Visaria et al., 1999 ). In public health care facilities , sterilization is free, and acceptors are provided with incentives to undergo the procedure ( Brault et al., 2016 ). Fig. 1 shows that in poor and purdah-practicing households, rates of female sterilization and hysterectomy are somewhat lower than in non-poor and non-purdah households. These differences between the subsamples are statistically significant ( Table A3 ). Download: Download high-res image (345KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 .

Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the outcome and control variables used in the regression models, disaggregated by mobile phone use. Women using a mobile phone have significantly higher mobility and are more likely to use contraceptives than women not using a mobile phone. This is in line with our general hypothesis. However, further disaggregation shows that this pattern only holds for non-surgical contraceptives such as oral pills, copper T (IUD), and condoms, while for surgical methods the opposite is true: women not using a mobile phone are more likely to have undergone sterilization or hysterectomy.

The lower part of Table 1 shows that there are also significant differences in many of the other socioeconomic variables. Hence, these descriptive comparisons of the outcomes should not be overinterpreted. Women using a mobile phone are younger, better educated, and less likely to practice purdah than women not using a mobile phone. They are also more likely to have educated mothers and a literate spouse. Further, we see significant differences in terms of household asset ownership, cultivated land, and caste. Households with women not using a mobile phone are more likely to be from disadvantaged groups , including scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST), and other backward castes (OBC). All these variables point at systematic differences between the groups, which we control for in the regression models below.
Table 2 presents different specifications of the model in equation (1) with women's physical mobility index as the dependent variable. These models are estimated with an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Column (1) shows a specification without any control variables. In column (2), we include individual characteristics, and in column (3), we further add household characteristics as controls. In column (4), we additionally include district fixed effects to control for unobserved regional factors. In all specifications, mobile phone use by women is positively associated with their physical mobility. The size of the mobile phone coefficient decreases somewhat when more control variables are added, as one would expect, but it stays positive and statistically significant even in the full model in column (4). The coefficient of 0.035 is equivalent to a 5% increase of women's physical mobility relative to the mean mobility index of women not using a mobile phone. These results clearly support our hypothesis of a positive association between women's mobile phone use and their physical mobility even after controlling for many relevant confounding factors.

We also re-estimated the models with the extended (composite) mobility index that includes additional aspects of women's geographical travel range, as explained above. These results, which are shown in Table A4 , are very similar to those in Table 2 in terms of both the magnitude and significance levels of the mobile phone use coefficients.
In Table 3 , we present results of the model in equation (2) with the use of any contraceptive method (surgical and non-surgical) as the outcome variable. The estimates shown are marginal effects from probit model estimates. As before, we start without any control variables in column (1), and then gradually add controls in subsequent columns. We see a positive and significant association between women's mobile phone use and their use of contraceptives in all model specifications. The full model results in column (4) suggest that women using a mobile phone are 5.3 percentage points more likely to use contraceptives than women not using a mobile phone. Table 3 .

Table 4 shows estimates of models where we differentiate between the use of surgical (sterilization and hysterectomy) and non-surgical (oral pills, copper T/IUD, diaphragms, and condoms) contraceptive methods. While women's use of mobile phones is positively associated with non-surgical methods of contraception (column 1), the association with surgical methods of contraception is negative (column 2). This reverse pattern was already seen in the descriptive comparisons above and is now confirmed also after controlling for possible confounders. The use of non-surgical methods of contraception is likely a stronger indicator of female autonomy and empowerment than the use of surgical methods, because sterilization and hysterectomy are non-reversible interventions for which decisions are likely not made by the women alone.

In Table A5 , we further disaggregate the non-surgical contraceptive methods by condoms, which require action by the male spouse, and other reversible methods, where women require medical prescriptions and/or advice (pills, copper T, etc.). Women's mobile phone use is positively associated with the use of condoms and negatively associated with the use of other non-surgical methods.
Overall, these results suggest that the use of different contraceptive methods is closely intertwined with various socioeconomic and cultural factors and that the use of mobile phones tends to strengthen women's bargaining power and autonomy to influence or make related decisions.
We now analyse whether the size of the associations between women's mobile phone use and the outcome variables differs by socioeconomic characteristics of the individual woman or the household, using interaction terms as explained in equation (3) . For women's physical mobility, the results are summarized in Table 5 . In column (1), we see a positive and significant coefficient of the interaction between mobile phone use and women's education . This implies that the association between mobile phone use and women's physical mobility is larger for women with at least some school education. In column (2), we find no significant coefficient for the purdah interaction term, meaning that the association between mobile phone use and women's physical mobility is the same for women practicing and not practicing purdah. The results in column (3) suggest that women belonging to socially disadvantaged castes benefit less from mobile phones than other groups. For women from socially disadvantaged castes, the use of mobile phones does not seem to influence their physical mobility, likely due to persistent caste-based prejudices in local communities. Finally, in column (4) we do not find a significant interaction between mobile phone use and household assets, indicating that the positive mobile phone association with women's physical mobility is independent of household wealth.

In Table 6 , we show heterogenous associations for the use of non-surgical (panel A) and surgical (panel B) contraceptives. Women's education and household wealth seem to increase the positive association between mobile phone use and non-surgical contraceptive methods. For women from socially disadvantaged castes the association is smaller. Strikingly, the same factors also influence the association between mobile phone use and surgical contraceptive methods, only with the exact opposite signs. In contrast, practicing purdah does not seem to influence any of the associations significantly. Table 6 .

Section: 5. Conclusion and policy implications

Women's economic and social empowerment is facilitated by their ability to move around independently and safely. However, in many developing countries women's physical mobility is restricted by traditional patriarchal codes of conduct and poor road and transport systems. Restricted female mobility is not only associated with limited access to information but also means lower social participation and worse access to healthcare and related services. Mobile phones could potentially improve the situation for women. Through the use of mobile phones, women can communicate with their social networks and better access information even without leaving the homestead. In addition, mobile phones could help to allay safety concerns when women leave the homestead alone. Finally, better access to information and more frequent communication with family and friends could help to strengthen women's self-confidence and intra-household bargaining power.
In this article, we used nationally representative data from India to test the hypotheses that women's use of mobile phones is positively associated with their physical mobility and use of contraceptives, both important indicators of female autonomy and empowerment. These hypotheses were clearly supported by the empirical estimates. Regression models with a large set of control variables included suggest that mobile phone use is associated with a 5% higher female physical mobility and a 5.3 percentage point higher likelihood of using any contraceptive methods. Further disaggregation showed that the positive association between mobile phones and contraceptive use is only observed for non-surgical methods, such as oral pills and condoms, whereas for surgical methods, including sterilization and hysterectomy, a negative association is observed.
We also analysed possible heterogeneity in the mobile phone associations for women with different socioeconomic backgrounds. Women without any school education and women from socially disadvantaged castes seem to benefit less from mobile phones than women with school education and women from other social groups. Household wealth increases the association between mobile phones and the use of non-surgical contraceptives, but has no effect on the association between mobile phones and women's physical mobility. The practice of purdah does not influence any of the associations in a significant way.
Overall, our results suggest that mobile phones can play an important positive role for women's empowerment in traditional societies . This general finding is in line with recent research by Rotondi et al. (2020) and Sekabira and Qaim (2017) , who showed that mobile phones help to strengthen women's financial autonomy and decision-making power in sub-Saharan Africa. We are not aware of any previous study that examined the effects of mobile phones on women's physical mobility anywhere in the world. We are also not aware of previous work that analysed the implications of mobile phones for contraceptive use in India.
Our findings have important policy implications. The further spread of mobile phones and related information and communication technologies (ICT) should be promoted in developing countries. This is important for increasing economic efficiency, market functioning, and household incomes, as previous studies showed (e.g., Aker, 2010 ; Beuermann et al., 2012 ; Parlasca et al., 2020 ; Torero and von Braun, 2006 ). But equitable access to ICT is also important to improve female autonomy and empowerment, as our results here suggest. Of course, the spread of mobile phones alone would not suffice if women had no access to these technologies. Hence, female education and awareness building are important in parallel to further improving mobile technologies, ICT infrastructure, and regulations that are conducive for widespread and affordable access. Mobile phones should be seen as a supplementary mechanism to empower women, not as a substitute for other important policies to improve infrastructure, institutions, and social services for the poor. To reduce existing gender inequality , policy initiatives using digital tools should explicitly target women from economically, socially, and educationally disadvantaged groups.
In closing, we briefly discuss two limitations of our study, which may also be useful for the design of future research. First, we used cross-sectional data, because panel data with gendered information on mobile phone use were not available. With cross-sectional data, identification of causal effects is difficult. While we controlled for possible confounding factors to the extent possible, bias due to unobserved heterogeneity between mobile phone users and non-users cannot be ruled out with certainty. This is why we interpreted our estimates cautiously as associations and not as causal effects. Second, we only looked at two outcome variables, namely women's physical mobility and use of contraceptive methods. To understand the effects of mobile phones on women's empowerment more comprehensively, panel data with suitable outcome variables capturing additional dimensions of gender equality and female wellbeing should be collected and used in follow-up research.
