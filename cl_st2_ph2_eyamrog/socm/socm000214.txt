Title: What works? The association of organisational structure, reforms and interventions on efficiency in treating hip fractures


Abstract: Abstract

Many studies indicate huge regional and hospital-level differences in health care performance. In order to increase health system efficiency, it is important to know the reasons behind the differences and analyse the effects of those factors that can be affected by health policy . The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare various organisational factors and health policy interventions in the performance of the care of hip fracture patients in Finland. We analysed the relationship between organisational factors (hospital volume, regional concentration of treatments) and performance. The focus is also on the effects of two macro-level organisational changes (integration of production of all health and social services in one provider) and two micro-level interventions (integrated patient pathway interventions, aiming to discharge patients as soon as possible). Our results indicate that macro-level integration of the production or financing of health and social services, bigger hospital volumes, and the concentration of the acute phase of care in fewer hospitals within hospital districts were not consistently related to efficiency in the care of hip fracture patients. Instead, efficiency can be increased using micro-level interventions aiming to coordinate patient pathways at the patient group level.

Section: 1. Introduction

Many studies indicate huge regional and hospital-level differences in health care performance. In order to increase health system efficiency, it is important to know the reasons behind the differences and analyse the effects of those factors that can be affected by health policy . Usually, studies evaluate the effects of one factor at a time, which does not allow comparing broader policy alternatives or combinations. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare various organisational factors and health policy interventions on performance in the care of hip fracture patients in Finland.
Most efficiency analyses have been conducted in competitive markets where the incentive structure is different than in a decentralised tax-financed health care system. In Finland, over 300 municipalities have been responsible for providing and financing health and social services for their inhabitants since the early 1990s. The common legislative aims set by government and parliament are the same for all regions, but decisions on organisational structure and policy interventions have been made at the local level in municipalities for most primary health care and social services, and in 20 municipal federations called hospital districts for specialised hospital care. Each municipality is a member of one of the hospital district joint authorities that are responsible for organising specialised medical services and coordinating hospital treatment in their own district.
This study concentrates on hip fracture patients, who typically are elderly and consume the full scale of services along a treatment pathway that includes hospital care, primary care , rehabilitation and long-term care services. We can roughly divide the care of hip fracture patients into the acute phase (surgical admission)—which is related to the organisational structure and decisions at the hospital district level—and the patient pathway phases that follow, which are related to the organisational structure and decisions at the municipal level ( Table 1 ). An earlier Finnish study ( Sund et al., 2011 ) and the indicators of the PERFECT project ( Häkkinen, 2011 , updated indicators from the years 2000–2018, available on the web in PERFECT, 2020 ) have revealed considerable regional variations in the performance of care of hip fracture. This offers an excellent possibility to study this regional variation associated with different implementations of the system and intervention in practice. As there are remarkable variations across countries as well within countries in the performance of hip fracture care ( Medin et al., 2015 ), our results will be important for other countries.

Number of municipalities belonging to a district range from 4 to 28. The biggest district was divided into five specialist care areas with their own acute hospital Responsible for all specialist care given to inhabitants living in the municipalities belonging to the district Financed by municipalities mainly using activity-based payment methods such as DRG. Some hospital districts have introduced a fine to reduce bed blocking, i.e. a fee paid by the municipality to the hospitals for patients declared ready for discharge who needed services from the municipalities Responsible for organising (i.e. volume and concentration) acute care (surgery admission) of hip fracture patients Directly to 30-day mortality, length of surgical admission, waiting time to surgery and indirectly to the other performance measures Local reforms at hospital district level (Kainuu, 2005 and Eksote, 2010) covering 70,000 and 132,000 inhabitants Responsible for all health and social services for inhabitants living in the municipalities belonging to regions Financed by municipalities Responsible for all services given to hip fracture patients Directly to all performance measures
Using comprehensive real-world data obtained by linking various nationwide registers for the total population of hip fracture patients, we evaluate trends in volume/performance and concentration/performance relationships as well as analyse the effects of two macro-level (regional health and social care system) organisational changes and two micro-level (disease-specific local) interventions.

Section: 2. Earlier studies and study setting

A large number of studies have commonly found a significant correlation between a hospital's volume of procedures and the medical outcomes of patients receiving the procedure at that hospital (e.g. Gaynor and Town, 2012 ), but hip fractures have relatively rarely been included in these studies. According to a recent literature review ( Malik et al., 2018 ), high-volume hospitals fared better than low-volume hospitals with respect to length of stay and postoperative complications . Most of the studies reviewed took place in the US. Six European studies (of which three were included in the review) give more contradictory results. A Danish study ( Kristensen et al., 2014 ) indicated that a higher hospital volume was associated with higher 30-day mortality and a longer length of stay. An Italian study ( Franzo et al., 2005 ) showed that in-hospital deaths, as well as 1-month, 6-month and 1-year mortality, were higher in high-volume hospitals. A Finnish study ( Sund, 2010 ) did not find a significant relationship between volume and four-month mortality, but a higher volume had a slight positive association with four-month maintainability . German studies ( Hentschker and Mennicken, 2015 , 2017 ) found the hospital volume to be positively associated with low in-hospital mortality. According to another Italian study ( Castronuovo et al., 2011 ), a higher hospital volume was significantly associated with lower mortality between 1 and 6 months, but not mortality for shorter (one month/30 days) or longer follow-ups (over 6 months). Two studies on the effect of volume on post-rehabilitation units have shown a clearly positive volume effect ( Sund, 2010 ; Gozalo et al., 2015 ).
If volume causes the outcome, then policies supporting centralisation of procedures or patients in fewer and bigger facilities with minimum volume standards make sense ( Morche et al., 2018 ). In the so-called ‘practice makes perfect’-hypothesis, either learning-by-doing or quality-enchanting scale economics cause large hospitals to provide better quality care that improves outcomes ( Luft et al., 1987 ; Gaynor et al., 2005 ). In the US, the management of hip fracture has escalated to be a cost-effective use of resources for hospitals with at least moderate volume (54 cases per year) and can result in cost-savings for high-volume centres (300+ cases per year) ( Swart et al., 2017 ). In Finland, it has been suggested that the operative care of hip fracture patients should be centralised in 12 acute hospitals with full availability of emergency services ( Virolainen and Pesola, 2017 ), but the current governmental statute (August 24, 2017) on centralisation of specialised hospitals does not include hip fracture patients.
If volume positively affects quality, we may find better quality in more concentrated markets. This contradicts conclusions derived from standard economic models, but there is evidence suggesting that under administered price systems (such as prospective payment), competition results in higher quality ( Gayner and Town, 2012 ). However, hip fracture is an acute and emergency condition with limited patient choice possibilities. Timely access to orthopaedic trauma surgery is essential for optimal outcomes, and concentration (regionalisation or consolidation) of some types of surgery has shown positive effects on access, timeliness and outcomes ( Kreindler et al., 2017 ). At the regional level, this means an increase in the concentration of the provider structure (horizontal integration), thus creating monopolies . A recent five-country study, however, did not find any association between quality and concentration among hip fracture patients. However, in Finland an increase in concentration in a region was associated with the decreased use of resources during the first acute hospital episode ( Häkkinen et al., 2015 ).
Specialist care, primary care and social care are typically provided by different organisations. By increasing vertical integration, problems can, in theory, be identified earlier in the care pathway and thereby improve the patient experience, prevent or reduce avoidable hospital admissions and delayed discharges, improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary duplication of care and costs. However, empirical studies of integrated care systems focusing on people with complex care needs suggest that the reality falls far short of these high expectations, and most evaluations find no significant benefits, and in any case, the effects are small ( Mason et al., 2015 ). Also, the evidence models focusing on disease management models with case management approaches are mixed, with improved patient satisfaction but little effect on outcomes, care utilisation or spending ( Stokes et al., 2015 ; Baxter et al., 2018 ). A recent study using data of hip fracture patients analysing the coordination reform in Norway, which aims to increase integration, shows a modest effect when comparing the trends in the capital areas of Finland and Norway ( Häkkinen et al., 2018b )

Section: 3. Data and methods

This study analyses annual cohorts of first-time hip fracture patients using the PERFECT hip fracture database ( Sund et al., 2011 ). Analyses of volume and concentration use provider-specific data for the whole country. Vertical integration reforms are examined in the Kainuu (2005) and Eksote (2011) areas, where the involved municipalities have exceptionally given the responsibility to provide all health and social services to a single upper-level organisation (the federation of municipalities). In addition, the two most important local hip-fracture-specific interventions aiming to increase co-ordination and performance using integrated patient pathways (one in Lahti in 2006 and another in Espoo in 2011) will be studied. The main analysis is based on patient cohorts (N = 37,499) from the years 2007–2015. A detailed analysis of an earlier Kainuu reform and Lahti intervention also utilises patient cohorts from the years 2001–2006 (an additional 23,696 patients). The database is constructed by linking various national registers (hospital discharge register, cause-of-death register, register of prescribed medicines, and tax files) covering the whole population in Finland. Episodes of hip fracture start with an acute phase in the hospital immediately after the event. The beginning of the episode—the index date—was defined as the first day of a hospital admission with the primary diagnosis of hip fracture (ICD-10 S72.0–S72.2) using four exclusions: (1) patients who had a hospital admission-related hip fracture during the 10 years prior to the index date; (2) patients that did not have surgery during the first hospital admission; (3) patients under the age of 50 and (4) patients who were in long-term institutional care before the index admission. The data are known to be well-suited to the follow-up of treatment pathways ( Sund et al., 2007 ).
The hospital volume was measured using the annual number of hip fracture patients per hospital. We classified patients by volume quintiles, using the whole data set (all year cohorts). As the Finnish hospital system is not very homogenous (15–17% of hip fracture patients are treated in the biggest hospital), we tested two alternative ways to construct the quintiles (Appendix) and ended up reclassifying the quintiles so that the highest volume quintile consists only of patients treated in the biggest hospital, while the four lower quintiles were calculated as quartiles of the annual volume of the hospital where they have been treated ( Fig. 1 ).

The volume for post-acute rehabilitation institutions was calculated only for those patients who were transferred to rehabilitation units within 10 days from the beginning of admission. Here we included only patients over the age of 64. Again, the volume was analysed using quintiles (Appendix). This subset of patients contains about 61% of all hip fracture patients (total number per year increasing from the years 2007–2015, from 2230 to 3100).
Regional concentration of care was measured within hospital districts and local regions responsible for specialist care in treating hip fracture patients. Concentration was measured using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI). The mean HHI value increased from 7900 to 9100 from the years 2007–2015. Again, we divide concentration into quintiles based on the annual HHI value in the patient's hospital district. Generally, hip fracture surgery is very concentrated within hospital districts, and the distribution of HHI is very skewed, with a considerable share of patients treated in hospital districts with high HHI values ( Fig. 1 ).
In the Kainuu Regional Experiment (2005–2012), public services (including all health and social services and funding) were arranged at the regional level (counties). Before the reform, the primary health care and social services were produced and financed separately by 10 municipalities, whereas specialist services were produced by a hospital district (federation of municipalities) and financed by the ten municipalities. The total population of Kainuu is about 70,000. After 2012, a new federation of municipalities took both service and financial responsibilities for the county without two municipalities.
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) was established in 2010 in order to ensure the availability of services with the limited financial resources of the nine participating municipalities. Eksote produces health services, family and social welfare services, and services for senior citizens that promote health and everyday well-being and functioning. The population of the social and health care district is about 132,000.
In the beginning of the 2000s, hip fracture patients in the city of Lahti had to wait over 15 days before discharge from the acute hospital because of the lack of appropriate supplementary services provided by the city. To intensify the care pathways , an orthopaedic geriatric rehabilitation ward was set up in Lahti's City hospital in the first half of 2006 ( Hakala et al., 2014 ). The local acute hospital was responsible for operations of all hip fracture patients in the hospital district (Päijät-Häme), but intervention focuses only on patients living in the city of Lahti. The total population of the hospital district is about 200,000, of which about half are living in Lahti.
The integrated hip fracture pathway intervention in Espoo (started in May 2011) included several activities that start already during the first aid given in the ambulance and continue immediately in the hospital's emergency unit, where a medical rehabilitation professional meets the patient even before the operation. The aim is quicker access to surgery and to take into account the rehabilitation needs in regard to surgical technique execution and mobilisation instructions. The patient will be in the active rehabilitation ward within two days after the operation. The same familiar rehabilitation professional treats the patient from the emergency room to the home, and the rehabilitation is monitored for a month after discharge. The intervention focuses only on patients living in the city of Espoo. The total population of Espoo is about 300,000.
As stated earlier, the Finnish health care system is decentralised. The size and number of hospitals (i.e. volume and concentration) is defined at the hospital district level, i.e. at 20 regional federations of municipalities responsible for providing specialist care for inhabitants living in municipalities belonging to hospital districts. The size (volume) of rehabilitation units and the micro-level local interventions are based on decision of individual municipalities whereas the two local reforms are based on the joint agreement of municipalities belonging to the hospital districts ( Table 1 ).
The performance measurement uses a microeconomic disease-based approach, which is based on modelling the natural progress of a disease, with a specific interest in the role of health services as a determinant in the disease's progress ( Häkkinen, 2011 ; Sund and Häkkinen, 2016 ). The main innovation of the approach is the use of individual-level data available from registers that allow us to measure the outcome (by following what happens to patients), process (treatment practices) and the use of resources (such as number of hospital days , cost, use of specific procedures and drugs) in selected risk-adjusted and well-defined patient groups.
In addition to the usual mortality (30-day, 90-day and 1-year) indicators, we measured outcome by two additional indicators reflecting policy aims in Finland (quick discharge to home and less institutionalisation). The first measure was expressed as the share of patients permanently discharged home within 90 days and still alive at the end of the period. Here, permanently means that a patient must remain continuously at home for at least two weeks after discharge, i.e. without being transferred to an inpatient care facility within that time. Institutionalisation was defined as the patient being in inpatient care (including a nursing home) every day during the first 90 days after the index date. This measure is related to the Finnish practice that a patient is formally defined as a long-term institutional care patient after 90 days of continuous inpatient care.
The use of resources was measured by various indicators of inpatient days and cost. Length of stay (LOS) was defined in two ways: (1) the acute hospital stay, i.e., the surgery admission, and (2) the first institutional episode, which includes (in addition to the acute hospital stay) stays in rehabilitation and long-term care institutions (such as nursing homes) during the first 90 days after the index day if a patient is transferred to these institutions immediately after surgery admission. In addition, the use of hospital care was measured by the total number of inpatient days during a one-year follow-up. The use of inpatient care during the first institutional episode and one year were converted into costs at the 2015 price level , using the information on DRGs from the acute hospital care and the type of provider (health centre, nursing home, etc.) from other institutions.
The waiting time for hip fracture surgery has been widely used as a process measure of quality of care (e.g. Klazinga and Ronchi, 2009 ). The proportion of patients with prolonged waiting times for surgery at the provider level seems to work as an effective evidence-based quality indicator ( Sund and Liski, 2005 ). As a process indicator of performance, we used the share of patients who waited more than two days for surgery.
We analysed the overall effects of volume, concentration, regional reforms and local interventions using appropriate regression models: logistic regression for dichotomous responses (e.g. mortality), negative binomial modelling for discrete count variables (e.g. LOS) and generalised linear modelling for continuous variables (e.g. costs were modelled using a gamma distribution with log link). For volume and concentration measures, the results are presented as adjusted marginal effects from the regression models by the quintiles. The effects of reforms and interventions were measured using dummy variables describing the existence of the reform/intervention.
The main analysis was made using data covering patient cohorts from the years 2007–2015 ( Table 2 ). We analysed the effect of hospital volume, concentration regional reforms and local interventions using a model that included indicators of all these variables, while confidence intervals were calculated with cluster–robust standard errors related to specific clusters (i.e. hospitals/rehabilitation units for volume indicator, and hospital districts for concentration measure). In addition, various patient covariates, such as age, sex, comorbidities, type of fracture, income, education and main activity, were controlled in the models using two approaches (Appendix Table 2 ). First, the marginal effects were estimated from the whole sample, using cohort-year indicators as control variables. Second, in order to describe trends in the marginal effects, we performed a repeated (by day) analysis (without cohort year indicator) so that each daily cohort consisted of patients whose episode began on that date or during the next three years (1095 days). We made 2192 repeated analyses, the first of which included patients with an index day between the date January 1, 2007 and the following 1095 (3*365) days; the second between January 2, 2007 and the following 1095 days; and the last one between 31.12.2013 and the following 1095 days. In Fig. 2 , Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 , we report only the most important and statistically significant differences (non-cutting confidence intervals) between the quintiles. Figures with confidence intervals are included in the supporting material of the article. In a detailed analysis, we did not find any bias associated with patient selection (potential endogeneity) with regard to the hospital volume–performance relationship (Appendix). Table 2 .

The variables included in the volume analysis of post-acute rehabilitation were slightly modified. Mortality figures were calculated from the beginning of rehabilitation admission, and adjusted factors include the length of the surgical admission.
The evaluation of the time-related reforms and interventions can be strengthened if sensible control groups can be constructed, because then possible time-related changes in specific areas can be compared to possible changes in other areas without the same reform or intervention. Therefore, in order to verify the results obtained from the main analyses using simple reform/intervention variables, we made supplementary analyses of their effects by describing time trends in performance indicators in reform/intervention regions and control groups, using the difference-in-difference (DID) and synthetic control (SCM) methods.
In the analysis of the two reforms, we used patients treated in other regions (or in the rest of the country) for constructing control groups. For the analysis of local interventions, we also used other control groups, which consisted of patients treated in the same local acute hospital but who lived in other municipalities (in Päijät-Häme for the Lahti intervention and in the neighbouring cities in the capital area (total population about 700,000) for the Espoo intervention).
The time trends were again analysed by marginal effects (intervention and control groups), using a repeated analysis technique for the 365-day cohorts. A monthly analysis (instead of one-day repetitions) was made to reduce the estimation burden and related convergence problems. Some logit and negbin models failed to converge, in which case marginal effects were approximated using the simpler OLS estimation technique. In addition, we report the marginal effects of performance indicators at the baseline, i.e. time before the reforms and interventions. In Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 , Fig. 9 , Fig. 10 , Fig. 11 , we report only time-trend intervals for the reform/intervention group and for a control group (consisting of the rest of the country) and focus on the outcome variables where the trends differ between the groups.
In the detailed analyses, we used the same above-mentioned patient covariates as control variables (Appendix Table 1 ) with some minor exceptions (see Appendix). In Kainuu and Lahti, it was not possible to include socioeconomic variables. Because applying nonlinear models within a DID framework is challenging and leads to inconsistent estimates of the effect ( Lechner, 2011 ), our DID analyses are based on the OLS models. As a sensitivity analysis, we combined DID with propensity matching and used bootstrapped standard errors (Appendix).
To estimate any causal effect, the DID method should fulfil several assumptions, of which the common trend assumption is the most important in our case. The common trend assumption requires that the (case-mix adjusted) trends of outcomes should have similar shapes between treatment and control groups, also after the intervention in the imaginary case of the absence of intervention. As this assumption is based on non-observable counterfactuals, there is no formal test for it. However, we performed a simple investigation of the assumption by estimating an OLS model explaining the performance indicators by reform/intervention area variable with the covariates and including annual indicators or a time trend (linear, logarithmic and quadratic trends) and their interactions with the reform variables, using the baseline data before the reform/intervention. In Table 3 , Table 4 , the significance of the interactions is reported separately for annual indicators and the trend variables. Table 3 . Estimation results of the local reforms.

We also used a data-driven systematic control method (SCM), which is a useful supplementary method to DID and helps to deal with a parallel trends assumption ( Bouttell et al., 2018 ). SCM allows the construction of control groups by selecting a weighted average of the outcome variable from a group of regions similar to the treated region ( McClelland and Gault 2017 ). The main difference between the approaches is that SCM uses regional-level aggregated data instead of individual-level data used in trend and DID analyses. Here we applied SCM to outcome variables describing regional-level risk-adjusted measures of the performance indicators calculated annually.
In SCM, we used as independent variables and possible confounding variables (predictor variables, see Abadie et al., 2010 ) the following basic variables calculated annually at the regional level: age and sex standardised number of hip fractures per population, share of population over 74, share of population over 74 living at home, average of comorbidity diseases, age categories, gender, and number of hospital days 90 days before hip fracture (see Appendix Table A3 ). In addition, in some cases lagged values of the outcome variable were also included as a predictor. As potential control units (donor regions), we used other hospital districts and local regions responsible for specialist care but excluded regions with reforms or interventions. The specification of predictor variables is described in Appendix.

Section: 4. Results

Hospital volume was not consistently related to performance. In the whole-period analysis, risk-adjusted 30-day and 90-day mortalities were over 1 percentage point higher in the biggest hospital compared to the lowest-volume hospitals ( Table 2 ). The trend analysis indicates that mortality differences between these extreme groups existed during the whole study period ( Fig. 2 a and b), but the difference was not consistently statistically significant (Supporting information figures S2a and S3b ). One-year mortality was higher in the biggest hospital compared to third-quintile hospitals in the whole-period analysis, but this difference did not exist during the whole period ( Fig. 2 c). Among patient cohorts, after the year 2010 one-year mortality in the biggest hospital was considerably higher compared to all lower volume quintile hospitals. It should be noted that the trend for the biggest hospital takes into account the decreasing effect (to be discussed later) of the Espoo intervention (May 2011) on mortality, since the intervention focused on a part of the patients treated in the biggest hospital.
According to the results covering the whole study period, the share of institutionalised patients was about 2 percentage points lower among patients treated in the biggest hospital compared to the fourth and first (lowest) volume quintile hospitals ( Table 2 , Fig. 2 d). The difference was highest during the earliest as well as the latest parts of the study period. During the middle of the study period, the share of institutionalised persons was lowest in the third volume quintile hospitals.
The length of surgical admission increased clearly in the biggest hospital at the beginning of the study period but decreased later to about the same level as in the first volume quintile, where it was somewhat longer than in the three other quintiles during the whole study period ( Fig. 2 e). According to the whole nine-year analysis, the length of surgical admission was statistically significantly higher in the two extreme hospital volume groups compared to other volume quintile hospitals ( Table 2 ).
There were no differences between the quintiles in the number of inpatient days during the first institutional episode, during the one-year follow up, and in the two measures of cost. The share of patients waiting for surgery was lowest in the fourth volume quintile hospitals, with significant differences compared to the first and third - quintile hospitals and the biggest hospital (because of the narrow confidence interval). However, during the study period, the share decreased in other quintiles, and the differences between the quintiles were reduced ( Fig. 2 f).
The volume of the rehabilitation unit was significantly associated with 30-day mortality but not to the other two mortality figures in the analysis covering the whole study period. Thirty-day mortality was over 1 percentage point higher in the lowest volume quintile units compared to the units belonging to the two highest quintiles. A detailed analysis shows that at the beginning of the study period, 30-day mortality was about 2–3 percentage points lower in the fifth quintile units compared to the first-quintile unit and also to the second and third volume quintile units ( Fig. 3 a). Later, there were no clear differences between volume quintiles.
In the third volume quintile rehabilitation units, the share of discharged patients was 3 percentage points higher than in the lowest quintile in the whole period analysis ( Table 2 ). A detailed analysis indicates that differences between the quintiles were highest at the beginning of the research period when the share was highest in the fourth quintile units ( Fig. 3 b). The cost of a first institutional episode was about €4000–5000 per patient, and one-year inpatients cost about €5000–6000 per patient higher in the highest volume quintile compared to the three lowest volume quintiles. But the cost in the highest quintile units have decreased, and by the end of the study period the difference decreased considerably ( Fig. 3 c and d). The other performance variables were not related to the volume of the rehabilitation unit.
Among all performance indicators, we found significant differences between concentration quintiles only in the 30-day mortalities, showing that the mortality indicator was higher in the lowest concentration quintiles compared to the second-lowest quintile. However, this difference was significant only in the whole period analysis but not in time-series considerations, and the trends varied between quintiles ( Fig. 4 ).
In Table 2 , the marginal effect of the Kainuu reform indicator describes the difference between the region and the rest of Finland during the whole period since the reform was implemented before the study period included in the table. Thus they cannot as such interpret the effects of the reform. This seems to be related to four outcome variables with a significant reform marginal effect. The trends describing the share of patients discharged home was somewhat higher ( Fig. 5 a), and the share of institutionalised ( Fig. 5 b) as well as the cost measures during the pre-treatment period ( Fig. 5 e and f) were lower in Kainuu compared to the rest of Finland. Most of the DID and SCM estimates of the four performance indicators are small and insignificant ( Table 3 ). The only exception is a DID estimate from the matched sample for the share of institutionalised, showing a decrease of 12 percentage points during the years 2006–2012 (Appendix, Table A1 ).

A significant effect of the reform seems to be a stable length of surgical admission occurring in Kainuu during the same time as the length of stay has decreased in other parts the country ( Fig. 5 c), affecting the DID estimates to show about a two-day increase. But actually, the increase in the length of surgical admission was substituted by a decrease in other types of inpatient care during the first institutional episode. Before the reform, the length of the first institutional episode was somewhat higher in Kainuu than in the rest of the country ( Fig. 5 d). A DID estimate indicates an approximate 6-day decrease from the years 2006–2012 in the length of stay for the first institutional episode, which was confirmed by sensitivity analyses (Appendix, Table A1 ). The indicator of reform was negatively associated with one-year inpatient days ( Table 2 ) and SCM shows an 8-day decrease in the indicator one year after the reform, which was due to large decreases in 2007 and 2010 in Kainuu ( Fig. 6 ). The DID estimates also show a decrease in the total number of inpatient days, but the decrease was not statistically significant.

The indicator of Eksote reform was negatively associated with the length of the surgical admission, the first institutional episode, one-year inpatient days and the two cost measures ( Table 2 ). However, except for an immediate reduction in the length of the surgical admission ( Fig. 7 a), these associations were not confirmed by the DID estimates, which were not significant, and in some cases, they even had an opposite sign. The trend analysis ( Fig. 7 b and d) and marginal effects before the reform ( Table 3 ) show that the length and cost of the first hospital episode were in pre-reform times lower in Eksote than in the rest of the country. SCM effects even show an increase in the cost of a first hospital admission ( Fig. 8 b). The decrease in one-year hospital days is the only significant association of the main analysis that was confirmed by SCM analysis ( Fig. 8 a). A constant small (about 7 days) and significant decrease can be seen compared to the synthetic region. This corresponds to the insignificant DID estimate (9 days) of the measure.

The surgery waiting time was longer in Eksote before the reform, and the DID estimate shows a 5–9 percentage point decrease, indicating that the area has reached the (lower) level of the rest of the country ( Fig. 7 f). In this performance variable, the evaluation of the common trend assumption suggested that the assumption may not hold ( Table 3 ).
One-year mortality was about 4 percentage points higher in Lahti than in the rest of Finland during the pre-intervention period ( Table 4 ). This difference has also prevailed after the reform and can be seen from Table 2 , which describes the effect of the Lahti intervention during the whole post-treatment time. However, there is a great annual variation in the mortality variable in Lahti ( Fig. 9 a). The SCM results with three donor regions indicate an increase of 3.5 percentage points of the mortality measure ( Table 4 ), which seems to be associated with considerably higher mortality in Lahti after the year 2011 when compared to the synthetic control region ( Fig. 10 a). The DID estimates were insignificant and smaller than SCM estimates. Download: Download high-res image (996KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 9 .

The share of patients discharged home was about 7 percentage points lower than in the two comparison groups before the intervention. Patients from Lahti have reached the same level as in the rest of the country ( Fig. 9 b) and other municipalities in their own hospital district, and the DID estimates show an approximate 8 percentage points increase in the share due to intervention after the year 2007 ( Table 4 ). The sensitivity analyses confirm the positive DID estimate, but the estimates from matched samples and from the local hospital district level were not significant (Appendix Table A2 ). The SCM analysis also gives lower and insignificant effects for the variable.
A similar trend can be seen in the reduction of the share of institutionalised patients 90 days after hip fracture ( Fig. 9 c), where most of the DID estimates were also significant in the sensitivity analysis. The SCM analysis shows an insignificant reduction of 10–7 percentage points.
As can be seen from Fig. 9 d, the long pre-intervention length of surgical admission that was reduced almost to the level prevailing in the control group and the DID estimates, shows a 7- to 10-day decrease in LOS. During the years 2007–2015, the LOS for the first admission was still 1.4 days longer than in the rest of the country ( Table 2 ). The trend before the intervention in the variable has been quite different than in the control groups, which was also verified during the evaluation of the common trend assumption. SCM could not be applied since the fit (high RMSPE) was very poor.
However, a reduction has also occurred in the LOS of the first institution episode, with DID estimates of 4–5 days. Compared to the rest of Finland, LOS of the first institutional episode has even been about 2 days shorter after the intervention ( Table 2 , Fig. 9 e). This decrease was also verified by most of the results of the sensitivity analysis (Appendix, Table A2 ). SCM estimates of the reduction were more than 3 days higher than the DID estimates ( Table 4 and Fig. 10 b). At the whole country level, the DID estimate for the first post-reform year also shows a significant reduction for the one-year inpatient days, but this was not verified by other levels and types of analyses.
The intervention also considerably reduced the cost of the first hospital episode and the one-year costs of inpatient care ( Table 4 ). The decrease was also verified by SCM analysis ( Fig. 10 c and d) and most of the sensitivity analyses. However, the Lahti indicator was insignificantly and marginally associated with the two cost measures during the years 2007–2015, confirming the fact that the intervention lowered the higher costs in Lahti to the average level in Finland, as can be seen in Fig. 9 g and h.
Before the intervention, mortality indicators were at the same level in the rest of Finland as in the control group in the capital area. After the intervention, the 90-day and 1-year mortality indicators clearly decreased in Espoo, especially during the years 2012 and 2013; but they have increased very rapidly during the later years ( Fig. 11 a and b). Thus, the DID estimates using data from 2007 to 2016 show no effect of the intervention ( Table 4 ). When patient cohorts from 2014 to 2015 were excluded, most of the DID estimates of the 90-day and 1-year mortality indicators were negative and significant. The SMC results also indicate a decrease in the two mortality indicators, but they also show an increase in Espoo during the years 2014–2015 ( Fig. 12 a and b). Thus the results of the main analysis ( Table 2 ) showing a 5 percentage points decrease for the Espoo intervention in 1-year mortality got some support from the detailed results.

As in Lahti, the length of surgery admissions in Espoo was very long before the intervention ( Fig. 11 c). The intervention decreased the LOS to the average of the whole country and even somewhat below the level in the control group in the capital area. The DID estimates show about a four-day decrease, but the figures and statistical evaluation strongly suggest a violation of common trend assumptions, and SMC could not be applied since the fit was very poor.
In Espoo, the LOS of the first institutional episode before and after the intervention was at about the same level, but it decreased in the local control groups, which explains the positive DID estimate in the capital area comparison. However, the intervention decreased the costs of inpatient care during the first institutional episode as well as in the one-year follow-up due to the reduction of expensive acute hospital care, and the DID estimate indicates a long-term decrease of about €3200 per patient, which is about 10% of the average one-year cost per patient. As can be seen from Fig. 11 d and e, before the intervention (patient cohorts starting before 2009), both cost measures were lower in Espoo compared to the control group but increased quite rapidly in 2009. The evaluation of common trend assumptions using the 2007–2011 data suggests a violation of assumption, but the evaluation is sensitive to the time horizon used: all evaluation measures were insignificant if we excluded patient cohorts before 2009 from the calculations. In that case, the DID estimates show considerably higher cost reductions. The same phenomenon can be found from the SCM analysis of the two cost measures ( Fig. 12 c and d), in which a best-fit comparison was obtained for years 2008–2010 as the evaluation period ( Table A2 ). The SCM analysis using three donor regions shows an even greater decrease in costs than the DID analysis. Thus the main analysis illustrating a €2000 decrease in costs in the first institutional episode and a €2700 decrease in the one-year costs of inpatient care for the Espoo intervention ( Table 2 ) gets support from the detailed supplementary analysis.
The DID estimates for waiting time for surgery were positive and significant, but this is mainly because the waiting time decreased in the control groups and reached the lower level, which could be seen among the patients from Espoo during the whole evaluation period.

Section: 5. Conclusions

Our results indicate that macro-level integration of the production or financing of health and social services, a bigger hospital volume, and concentration of acute-phase care in fewer hospitals within a hospital district were not consistently related to efficiency in the care of hip fracture patients. Instead, efficiency can be increased using micro-level interventions aiming to coordinate patient pathways at the patient group level. The motivation for the two local interventions evaluated in the study was the recognized poor performance (e.g. a long length of surgery admission) in the areas before the intervention. The intervention in Lahti decreased costs by reducing the use of expensive specialist hospital care and by increasing the number of patients discharged home, rather than institutionalisation, after a hip fracture. In Espoo, we found short-term reduced mortality and a decrease in hospital inpatient costs.
The evaluation of volume and concentration of care was based on a cross-sectional type analysis covering several years, which were specified using repeated analyses of patient cohorts over the course of time. We did not find any bias related to selection and endogeneity in the volume–performance relationship (Appendix). This enabled us to evaluate the time trend in the association between performance and organisational factors, but not to reveal any causal effects. In Finland, the volume of hospitals and concentration of care have increased gradually without the possibility to create clearer treatment and control groups. For example, the average volume of hospitals has increased because smaller hospitals have discontinued hip fracture surgery, and surgeries have gradually moved to the existing higher-volume hospitals.
The evaluation of the reforms and interventions can be interpreted to tell more about causality since we were able to extend a cross-sectional type analysis by establishing longitudinal control groups by two complementary ways. The main conclusions of the study were confirmed by both of the two approaches and additional sensitivity analysis, using combined DID with propensity matching and bootstrapped standard error (Appendix).
Earlier studies on the association between the volume of hospitals treating hip fractures and short-term mortality have given contradictory results. As in two previous studies made in Italy ( Franzo et al., 2005 ) and Denmark ( Kristensen et al., 2014 ), we found that mortality was highest in the high-volume hospital. Kristensen et al. (2014) have speculated that this could be a result of decreased attention to hip fracture patients, as those admitted to high-volume hospitals typically would have to ‘compete’ with more complicated orthopaedic surgery patients (e.g. with major trauma). For whatever reason, our results do not support centralisation of procedures or patients in fewer and bigger facilities or the definition of minimum volume standards in hospitals in treating hip fracture patients.
Our results confirm the earlier Finnish evidence that a higher-volume rehabilitation unit was associated with lower mortality ( Sund, 2010 ). However, this association prevailed only in the earlier periods of our study and had mainly disappeared after 2010. We did not find clear support for an earlier study ( Häkkinen et al., 2015 ) suggesting that costs were lower in areas with a high concentration of hip surgery in fewer hospitals. Moreover, our results point out some concerns about current policy actions in Finland that aim to increase the concentration of the provider structure (horizontal integration) as well as the vertical integration of care between specialist, primary and social services. For example, vertical integration of health and social services, in a similar way as in Eksote 2010, has after 2017 been adopted in several other regions in Finland. Our study illustrates that this kind of reform as such does not guarantee a more efficient system and requires at least patient group–level actions aiming to develop patient pathways over micro-level organisational or producer boundaries.
The study are based on rich data covering homogenous first-time hip fracture patents in Finland during the years 2007–2015 who were not in long-term care before the surgery. In addition, the effects of organisational reforms and local interventions were analysed using versatile analytical approaches that verified the main conclusions. The study results can to some extent be generalised outside of Finland to other tax-funded health care systems where decision-making is decentralised to local authorities with separate organisations providing hospital, primary and social care. The main caveats of the study is the lack of data on the clinical quality of care ( Voeten et al., 2018 ), the functional ability of patients (such as measures of activities in daily living), the use of outpatient services in primary care as well as home-help services, which are not yet available for a longer time period and not from all regions ( Häkkinen et al., 2018a , 2018b).
