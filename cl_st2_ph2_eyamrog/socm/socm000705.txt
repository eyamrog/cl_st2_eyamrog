Title: Expectant parents’ emotions evoked by pregnancy: A longitudinal dyadic analysis of couples in the Swedish Pregnancy Panel


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Rationale

Holistic antenatal care requires knowledge of individuals’ emotional response to pregnancy. Little is known about how a pregnant woman and her partner influence each other emotionally during a pregnancy.

Abstract_Section: Objective

This study examines six discrete emotions that expectant couples experience during pregnancy, how these emotions change mid-to late-pregnancy, and whether the partners’ emotional responses influence each other.

Abstract_Section: Methods

A longitudinal dyadic study where pregnant women and their partners (1432 couples) rated the extent to which the pregnancy evoked joy, strength, security, worry, shame , and anger at pregnancy week 12–19, 22–24, and 36. Latent curve models with structured residuals identify levels of and change in these emotions over time, while accounting for between- and within-couple variance.

Abstract_Section: Results

Pregnancy evoked mainly joy, strength, security, and worry, and lower levels of anger and shame. Pregnant women and partners felt similar levels of joy, strength, and security, but pregnant women felt more worry, shame, and anger. There was little to no mean-level change in all six measured emotions evoked by pregnancy (between-couple change), and no reciprocal effects between the partners (within-couple change).

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Emotions in mid-pregnancy were also felt in late pregnancy. Furthermore, the pregnant woman and her partner have individual emotional trajectories. The results can assist healthcare professionals and researchers target interventions to expectant mothers and partners, specifically by understanding emotional response to pregnancy as a stable confound and by not approaching the couple as one emotional unit.

Section: 1. Introduction

Pregnancy is one of the major events in a person's life ( Monroe and Slavich, 2019 ) and can influence the physical and mental health of parents to be ( Edelstein et al., 2015 ; Miller, 2014 ; Wong et al., 2016 ). Holistic antenatal care requires knowledge of not only pregnancy physiology and medical risks, but also of psychological changes in the expectant parents, to be able to prevent and address risks and complications during this crucial time ( Berglund et al., 2016 ). A topic often examined regarding pregnancy is emotion. Negative emotions such as stress, depression, and anxiety have been associated with adverse health outcomes including increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight, pathological fetal heart rate, and impaired emotional reactivity and immune responses ( Bussières et al., 2015 ; Entringer et al., 2010 ; Monk et al., 2000 ; Swales et al., 2018 ) in the child, and development of mood disorders for the mother ( Bos et al., 2013 ). On the other hand, positive emotions such as self-esteem and optimism have been found to be associated with higher birth weight, longer length of gestation, and reduced risk of preterm delivery ( Lobel et al., 2000 ; Rini et al., 1999 ; Voellmin et al., 2013 ). Changes in emotions during pregnancy may also be associated with risk of adverse outcomes . Increases in feelings of distress and stress may undermine bonding with the infant or maintenance of optimal health behaviors (i.e., exercise, eating) ( Auerbach et al., 2017 ; Buist et al., 2003 ; Weaver et al., 2008 ) and may increase vulnerability to postnatal distress ( Morse et al., 2000 ) while increases in security and joy can promote coping, which can reduce emotional distress and protect against adverse health effects ( Guardino and Dunkel Schetter, 2014 ; Waugh, 2020 ).
Studies on emotional change during pregnancy have mostly focused on the broad conceptualizations of negative and positive emotions, such as Positive Affect Negative Affect Scales (PANAS) or pathologies such as anxiety and depression. From these studies, we find that during pregnancy, negative emotion increases in pregnant women ( Lips, 1985 ; Pesonen et al., 2016 ; Wilkinson, 1999 ), increases in partners ( Morse et al., 2000 ), or decreases in partners ( Buist et al., 2003 ), and positive affect does not change ( Wilkinson, 1999 ). However, negative and positive emotions may include different components of negative and positive feelings (e.g., worry vs. anger, joy vs. security; Watson and Clark, 1992 ), with each progressing differently throughout pregnancy and associated with different health outcomes. For instance, feelings of anger, even after controlling for other negative moods, is associated with postnatal depression ( Ou and Hall, 2018 ), while feelings of security are associated with having a positive birth experience ( Nilsson et al., 2013 ). In past studies on emotions during pregnancy, to the best of our knowledge, only Morse et al. (2000) addresses the individual emotion of anger, finding that it increases in partners over the course of pregnancy. The dearth of attention on specific, non-pathologized emotions that individuals experience (e.g., joy, worry, anger) during pregnancy may reflect a restricted understanding of how pregnancy influences feelings broadly ( Lobel and Ibrahim, 2018 ).
It is also rare to let the individual evaluate how the pregnancy influences their emotions. To this end, we aimed to provide an improved understanding of emotional responses to pregnancy. Emotions have two classifications: an unconscious reaction and a cognitive appraisal of a situation ( Izard, 2007 ). While previous studies utilize questions on emotions that fall between the two classifications ( Bowen et al., 2012 ; Buist et al., 2003 ; Lips, 1985 ; Morse et al., 2000 ; Pesonen et al., 2016 ; Wilkinson, 1999 ), we used survey items where individuals assess specifically which emotions were evoked by the pregnancy (i.e., cognitive appraisal). Since appraisals can be targeted by antenatal care to enhance healthy thought and decision-making about pregnancy, we should better understand how individuals define their emotional responses to pregnancy.
Furthermore, research on emotions during pregnancy often investigates the emotions of expectant parents separately ( Bowen et al., 2012 ; Buist et al., 2003 ; Pesonen et al., 2016 ) or uses analytical approaches that do not account for measurement error and bias ( Lips, 1985 ; Morse et al., 2000 ; Wilkinson, 1999 ). Within a couple, pregnancy is a life event shared between a pregnant woman and a partner, and they may influence each other emotionally during this time ( Edgley and Roberts, 2021 ; Morse et al., 2000 ; Werner-Bierwisch et al., 2018 ). Especially in recent years, as partners are seen as important actors during pregnancy and encouraged to participate in pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare (2), the couple's relationship may be of even more importance to the pregnancy and its associated emotions. Although some studies include the partner in the study design, the analyses are based on ANOVAs and logistic regression ( Lips, 1985 ; Morse et al., 2000 ; Wilkinson, 1999 ), which prevents a comparison of the means and trajectories of pregnant women and partners over the course of pregnancy. The lack of studies investigating emotions using dyadic data makes it difficult to form a comprehensive picture of how expectant couples' emotions change and the degree to which emotions are influenced by the partners. Given how the roles of partners in pregnancy has changed dramatically in the past decades, studies that do not fully address the couple dynamics in emotion analysis can only portray an incomplete view of pregnancy-related emotions.
The partner's role may be especially important in certain contexts and countries where the other parent is expected to be involved throughout the childbearing process. Sweden is a Nordic country known for its high levels of gender equality, welfare, support of parental leave, and partners being involved in the pregnancy and childcare process ( Oláh and Bernhardt, 2008 ; World Bank Group, 2019 ). The partner is the first support in Sweden, compared to other contexts where the couple's parents and other family members may be the first to help ( Plantin, 2015 ). In the Swedish circumstances, where the expectant mother and partner deal with the challenges (and joys) of the pregnancy together, antenatal care may need to consider the partners' emotions, rather than relying on the pregnant woman to speak for the couple.
To our knowledge, no attempt has been made to investigate how emotional responses to pregnancy change during pregnancy in both pregnant women and their partners. We examine the trajectories of six discrete emotions from a dyadic perspective, using a large sample and an analytical model that accounts for both between- and within-person change. Our data also allows us to rule out that differences depend on whether the pregnancy was planned, whether the pregnant woman is a first-time mother, the extent to which the couple felt affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their household income and educational attainment.
Based on previous literature, we hypothesize that across all couples, (1) pregnant women will increase in negative emotions (worry, shame , and anger) and remain stable in positive emotions (joy, security, and strength), and (2) partners will remain stable in all six emotions. In addition, we hypothesize that within couples, (3) pregnant women and partners will influence each other's emotions over time.

Section: 2. Methods

This study is based on data from the Swedish Pregnancy Panel (SPP) ( Naurin et al., 2021 ), a longitudinal survey of pregnant women and their partners, combined with data on the health of the woman and child from the Swedish Pregnancy Register, a national quality register ( Stephansson et al., 2018 ). The Swedish Ethical Review Authority approved the SPP on April 15, 2019 (Dnr: 1061–18). We use data from pregnancy week 12–19 (N = 1432 couples), pregnancy week 22–24 (N = 1247 couples), and pregnancy week 36 (N = 919 couples). A partner is defined as a person who is married or living together with or apart from the pregnant person or is the biological or non-biological parent of the child/children to be born. At the first time point, 1.6 percent of the partners were women. Data collection ranged from September 2019 to September 2020.
Recruitment to the SPP occurred in the ultrasound waiting area of a tertiary care hospital in Sweden with around 10,000 births per year (10,156 in 2020). Almost all pregnant women in Sweden undergo routine ultrasound scans in the first and second trimester, due to the free antenatal care offered to all pregnant women. Participants were recruited as they were waiting for the scheduled first (in pregnancy week 12–19) or second trimester routine ultrasound screening (week 18–20). Ninety-six percent of all the routine second-trimester ultrasound and 55 percent of all first trimester ultrasounds in the studied city area were performed at the hospital where recruitment took place. Thus, the current sample was recruited from a general pregnant population within the city area.
Participants were recruited in face-to-face approaches, signed paper consent forms, and filled in a self-administered profile questionnaire on tablets. Online questionnaires were sent out by email in pregnancy week 12–19, 22–24, and 36. Participants received online vouchers worth SEK 100 after finishing the second questionnaire. The questionnaire could be taken in Swedish, English, Arabic, or Somali, although 92.9–95.3% filled it in Swedish across all three questionnaires.
Emotional response to pregnancy was measured by the question “Has the pregnancy evoked any of the following feelings in you [joy, worry, strength, shame , sense of security, anger]?” Participants responded to each emotion on a 7-point Likert scale , with the response options 1 “No, not at all”, 2 “Yes, but very little”, 3 “Yes, but relatively little”, 4 “Yes, a bit”, 5 “Yes, quite a lot”, 6 “Yes, very much”, and 7 “Yes, enormously”. Participants did not see any numbers attached to the response labels; the numbers were only used in the analyses. The emotions were selected based on previous qualitative analyses of open-ended responses from pregnant women and partners of pregnant women that were available to us via the Swedish Citizen Panel (SCP), a longitudinal web-based survey of 55,000 Swedish respondents. In the SCP, participants were asked to describe how they remembered feeling during their (or their partner's) most recent pregnancy. The free-text answers to the open-ended question were examined using qualitative content analyses where meaningful emotions were identified. For this study, we selected the answers that were often reported, easily distinguishable from other emotions, and had clear relevance in previous work. Those answers included typical emotions from the emotions research, such as anger, joy, worry, and shame ( Ekman and Cordaro, 2011 ), as well as those relevant to someone going through pregnancy (e.g., strength, sense of security).
We control for five factors related to the context in which the couple's emotional interaction takes place. These factors include: whether the pregnancy was planned, if it was the mother's first time giving birth, the degree of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the economic (household income) and human capital (education). Details about the control variables are located in the supplementary document.
Analyses were conducted using M plus version 8.6, using a dyadic data structure. We used a robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) to account for non-normal distributions of observed variables and full information maximum likelihood procedure to account for missing data. To compute fit indices for model comparisons, we use the Satorra-Bentler scaled (mean-adjusted) chi-square, which adjusts for non-normality in the samples, and comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) with 95% confidence intervals. Acceptable fit thresholds for CFI and TLI are set at 0.95 (with adequate model fit by change in less than or equal to 0.01), and values less than or equal to 0.06 for RMSEA ( Hu and Bentler, 1998 ).
Each emotion was modelled individually as latent curve models with structured residuals (LCM-SR). Accurately representing change in unobserved constructs (i.e., emotion) require accounting for measurement error and bias (e.g., missing data), and evaluating model fit, which are better offered in a structured-means-modeling (latent) approach ( Breitsohl, 2019 ). Yet even popular latent approach models, such as traditional latent growth curve models (LCM) and cross-lagged panel models (CLPM), only consider change in ordering between individuals over time, confounding between- and within-person effects. In an effort to understand within-person changes and bidirectional relationships while accounting for individual differences, we use the latent curve model with structured residuals (LCM-SR; Curran et al., 2014 ). Model comparisons were first carried out to determine whether including the slope parameter significantly improved model fit. Final analyses were run with the best-fitting univariate models. Constraints were used to determine whether intercepts (mean level of emotions) were significantly different for pregnant women and partners, whether autoregressive paths (association of one's own emotions over time) were significantly different, and whether cross-lagged paths (reciprocal associations between the pregnant women and partners' emotions) were similar across time. We used the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons (α = 0.05/6 = 0.009).
To determine the robustness of our findings, we ran sensitivity analyses to test model specification, whether control variables significantly changed the models, and whether data from female-partners significantly influenced the results.
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Section: 3. Results

A majority of the pregnant women and partners in the SPP were Swedish citizens and had at least three years of tertiary education. Almost all of the participants (99.1%) were either married or cohabiting and about half the sample was aged 31–35 years. Three-quarters of the sample had a household income above SEK 600,000 annually before taxes. Table S1 shows the characteristics of the sample at pregnancy week 12–19 (time point 1) and 36 (time point 3). Table S2 summarizes the descriptive statistics and correlations among the study variables.
Which emotions are evoked by pregnancy in pregnant women and their partners throughout pregnancy?
Fig. 1 shows the unadjusted mean plots for the six emotions. Pregnant women and their partners experience similar levels of positive emotion (joy, security, and strength). Joy was the emotion most evoked by pregnancy ( M = 5.80, “Yes, very much”), followed by strength ( M = 4.54, between “Yes, a bit” and “Yes, quite a lot”), and security ( M = 4.32, “Yes, a bit”). For negative emotions, worry is more likely to be felt than shame and anger, but all three were more likely to be felt by pregnant women. Pregnant women feel more worry (M = 4.39, “Yes, a bit”), shame (M = 1.75, “Yes, but very little”) and anger ( M = 2.17, “Yes, but very little”) compared to the partners’ worry (M = 3.74), shame ( M = 1.29, “No, not at all”) and anger ( M = 1.60).

Models were adjusted for first-time birth, planned pregnancy, the degree of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, household income, and educational attainment. a Assigned scale numbers within parenthesis and actual labels within quotes: 7-point Likert scale , (1) “No, not at all”, (2) “Yes, but very little”, (3) “Yes, but relatively little”, (4) “Yes, a bit”, (5) “Yes, quite a lot”, (6) “Yes, very much”, and (7) “Yes, enormously”.
For pregnant women and their partners, emotions evoked by pregnancy did not change throughout pregnancy week 12–36, see Table S3 . Univariate model comparisons indicated that including the slope in the model worsened fit ( Table S3 ). Thus, our final models included only intercept, autoregressive, and cross-lagged parameters, along with the control variables. Model fit indices are presented in Table S4 .
In other words, across couples, there was no overall trend (between-couple change) in how these emotions change from mid-to late pregnancy.
How do pregnant women and their partners influence each other's emotional perceptions?
The pregnant woman and her partner report corresponding levels of emotion for four emotions, as shown by the significant correlations between intercepts for the pregnant woman and the partner for joy ( ρ = 0.23), strength ( ρ = 0.18), security ( ρ = 0.17), and worry ( ρ = 0.22). A joyful pregnant woman tends to also have a joyful partner. However, pregnant women's and partners' level of shame and anger were not associated.
Even though there was no between-couple (slope) change, we examined whether there was within-couple change (cross-lagged). In other words, while pregnant women's and partners' emotions may not change on average, emotions felt by the pregnant woman, or the partner may influence the other person in the couple. However, within couples, we found no significant reciprocal effects between pregnant woman and their partner over time. Effects were similar for pregnancy week 12–19 to 22–24 and pregnancy week 22–24 to 36, and neither the effects of pregnant woman to partner nor the effects of partner to pregnant woman were significant. This suggests that within a couple, the pregnant woman's emotions do not depend on the partner's emotions at the previous time point, and the partner's emotions do not depend on the pregnant woman's emotions at the previous time point.

Sensitivity analyses confirmed that our findings were robust. Intercept and slope models retained non-significant slopes and parameters similar to those in the intercept-only model. Parameters from models without controls and male-partner-only data are similar to those from the main analysis. Attrition analyses of study variables found no significant differences ( p < .05) between those who dropped out and those who responded at pregnancy week 36 on joy, worry, shame, security, and anger at pregnancy week 12–19. However, participants felt less strength at week 12–19 compared to those who dropped out. In addition, participants who responded at pregnancy week 36 were more likely to be Swedish citizens, first-time parents, more educated, older, from a higher income household, and have had a planned pregnancy.

Section: 4. Discussion

This study investigated the emotions evoked by pregnancy in a large sample of Swedish pregnant women and partners. We find that both pregnant women and partners reported that pregnancy evoked joy, strength, security, and worry, and some shame and anger, and those emotions remained consistent throughout pregnancy. Contrary to our first hypothesis, we found that pregnancy-related emotions of pregnant women do not change from mid-pregnancy to late pregnancy. However, our findings do support our second hypothesis, in that pregnancy-related emotions of pregnant women's partners do not change. Thus, this study offers a contrasting viewpoint manifesting stability in pregnancy-related emotions during pregnancy, compared to previous studies, which find that negative affect, anxiety, and depression tend to increase during pregnancy in pregnant women ( Lips, 1985 ; Pesonen et al., 2016 ; Wilkinson, 1999 ) and partners ( Morse et al., 2000 ). While the other studies' smaller sample sizes could explain the difference in findings, it may also be that younger participants ( Lips, 1985 ) have more limited emotional regulation capabilities, leading to more variation ( Burr et al., 2021 ). In addition, given that studies with similar sample characteristics find complex patterns within emotional changes, such as participants experiencing no change in PANAS but increasing in depression and anxiety ( Pesonen et al., 2016 ), change in emotions could be attributed to the use of various tools and measurements. Future research will need to clarify and compare how changes in emotions and affect are captured differently by the various measurements.
Using dyadic data collected in 2019 and 2020, we also contribute to the current literature on couple emotions during pregnancy, which is primarily composed of older studies published more than twenty years ago ( Buist et al., 2003 ; Lips, 1985 ; Morse et al., 2000 ; Wilkinson, 1999 ). While initial levels of emotions are associated within the couple, our study found no significant reciprocal associations between pregnant women's and partners' emotions evoked by pregnancy over time for all the six studied emotions, contrary to our third hypothesis. The lack of reciprocal associations over time suggests that joy, strength, security, worry, shame, and anger during pregnancy may be influenced by factors outside of the couple dyad and develop independently for pregnant women and partners.
We find that pregnancy evoked similar levels of joy, strength, and security in pregnant women and partners, but pregnant women felt that pregnancy evoked significantly more feelings of worry, shame, and anger, compared to partners. Women, on the whole, do experience more feelings of worry in life in general ( Robichaud et al., 2003 ; Wood et al., 2005 ) and this may carry over into pregnancy. In addition, due to the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant women may experience more feelings of shame in terms of body appearance ( Parker and Pausé, 2019 ) and disruptions in one's regular work and lifestyle ( Graham et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, shame and anger were not correlated within couples, suggesting that experiences of shame and anger depend on different internal and external factors of the pregnancy ( Werner-Bierwisch et al., 2018 ). Pregnant women's shame and anger evoked by pregnancy may revolve around physiological and health concerns ( Pilkington and Bedford-Dyer, 2021 ), whereas for partners, shame and anger could be more related to one's ability to support the family or being there for their significant other ( Åsenhed et al., 2014 ). In addition, emotions including shame and anger may be more stigmatized, compared to emotions such as joy and worry ( Lee and Stott, 1993 ; Scheff, 2016 ). Because pregnant women and partners may feel guilty about feeling and expressing shame and anger ( Beck, 1996 ; Hoffman, 2003 ), couples may be less likely to talk about these emotions or events that may cause these feelings. As a result, it may be even more unlikely that these emotions influence the other person in the couple. Given these differences and the importance of the partner's role during the pregnancy, we should better understand why these two emotions are not associated between expectant couples. Future research can investigate the different emotional responses for shame and anger, and individual and contextual factors that influence the association within couples, by delving into the conversations about emotions that couples have regarding pregnancy, how often they talk about specific emotions, and the extent to which they work on these emotions together.
Our findings should be considered in the context of the limitations of the study. The data is limited in the sense that it was collected in one cultural setting. Given that cultural context influences the experiences and expressions of emotion ( Boiger et al., 2013 ), it could be that in the Swedish context, more stigma is attached to expressing certain negative emotions such as shame and anger, even within a couple. In addition, Sweden is known for its high levels of gender equality, welfare, support of parental leave, and partners being involved in the pregnancy and childcare process. Thus, conclusions drawn here may need to be replicated in pregnant couples in other countries in order to assess validity across contexts. However, the fact that our data is from a country with universal healthcare might have reduced the confounds of healthcare utilization that may be present in other countries. In addition, our data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though Sweden's response to the pandemic was not as limiting as those in other countries, it is known that pregnant women and partners worried more during the pandemic ( Naurin et al., 2021 ). In our study, we address this limitation by controlling for the degree to which participants describe being affected by the pandemic, although future studies may be needed to understand how different emotions in pregnant women and partners may differ depending on the proximity to a global health crisis.
Another limitation is the high levels of joy and low levels of shame and anger, as well as lack of mean-level change, which might impede detection of reciprocal associations. Simply put, if there is little change in the data, it is more difficult for associations to emerge. Future studies should investigate this question with more frequent measurements during pregnancy to identify whether dyadic systems of emotional responses occur within a certain time frame between couples. It may be the case that emotions are aligned at the beginning of or even before pregnancy, especially since the majority of the study population had planned the pregnancy. In this study, we could not capture emotions during the first trimester, which might have been impacted by the physiological and psychological changes of pregnancy. Moreover, since our question formulation stems from subjective reports of pregnant women and partners of their emotional response to pregnancy, it is not directly comparable to measures of objective emotional response. Social desirability might have affected how participants describe how the pregnancy has made them feel. Yet, by explicitly asking about emotions evoked by pregnancy, we are able to target an experience of emotions that is often not examined in the literature, allowing a more holistic view of experiences during pregnancy. Our questions on emotions evoked by the pregnancy also did not provide a timeframe (e.g., in the past two weeks), which could have caused some participants to rate their emotions across their full pregnancy. However, the questions were placed in a section of the survey where participants were asked other questions pertaining to their current state of the pregnancy, with some specifically reminding them to think about the situation right now. Thus, there is good reason to assume that responses would capture their feelings at that particular point during the pregnancy. Lastly, since participants who responded at pregnancy week 36 were more likely to be Swedish citizens, first-time parents, educated, older, and have higher income than participants who dropped out of the study, our findings of emotional stability may be more generalizable to populations who have higher levels of human and economic capital. Furthermore, the development of strength during pregnancy in our data may be less clear, as participants who remained in our sample were likely to feel less strong mid-pregnancy.

Section: 5. Conclusions

Despite these limitations, this study offers a novel perspective into changes (or lack thereof) in emotions during pregnancy for pregnant women and partners. It is the first study to use longitudinal dyadic data on couples to analyze emotional responses during pregnancy, focusing on discrete non-pathologized emotions, and a latent curve model with structured residuals, which accounts for between- and within-couple effects. In addition to showing that emotions in mid-pregnancy are felt also in late pregnancy, we find the pregnancy evoked mainly joy, strength, security, and worry, with pregnant women and partners feeling similar levels of positive emotions and different levels of negative emotions. While there are similarities in the levels of emotions felt during mid-pregnancy, we find no reciprocal associations between partners’ emotions across time points, suggesting that emotions during pregnancy may be developing separately for pregnant women and partners.
Understanding the relationship between pregnant women's and partners' emotions during pregnancy can help healthcare professionals and researchers adapt interventions to the needs of expectant couples, thus promoting the health of the parents and child. We found that pregnancy is a foreseeable emotional process, in that the emotions experienced in mid-pregnancy are also experienced at the end of pregnancy. Even though the pregnant woman and her partner experience many emotions, especially joy, strength, security and worry, in general pregnancy-related emotions are not shifting back and forth. Combined with previous research, these findings posit the need for research to better understand why certain emotions, such as joy and worry, are shared between pregnant women and partners, while others, such as shame and anger, are less associated, and for antenatal care to address the emotions of both pregnant woman and partner rather than approaching the couple as one emotional unit.
