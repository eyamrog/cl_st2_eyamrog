Title: Skill-mix change and outcomes in primary care: Longitudinal analysis of general practices in England 2015–2019


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Increasing the employment of staff with new clinical roles in primary care has been proposed as a solution to the shortages of GPs and nurses. However, evidence of the impacts this has on practice outcomes is limited. We examine how outcomes changed following changes in skill-mix in general practices in England.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We obtained annual data on staff in 6,296 English general practices between 2015 and 2019 and grouped professionals into four categories: GPs, Nurses, Health Professionals, and Healthcare Associate Professionals. We linked 10 indicators of quality of care covering the dimensions of accessibility, clinical effectiveness, user experiences and health system costs. We used both fixed-effect and first-differences regressions to model changes in staff composition and outcomes, adjusting for practice and population factors.

Abstract_Section: Results

Employment increased over time for all four staff groups, with largest increases for Healthcare Professionals (from 0.04 FTE per practice in 2015 to 0.28 in 2019) and smallest for Nurses who experienced a 3.5 percent growth. Increases in numbers of GPs and Nurses were positively associated with changes in practice activity and outcomes. The introduction of new roles was negatively associated with patient satisfaction: a one FTE increase in Health Professionals was associated with decreases of 0.126 [-0.175, −0.078] and 0.116 [-0.161, −0.071] standard deviations in overall patient satisfaction and satisfaction with making an appointment. Pharmacists improved medicine prescribing outcomes. All staff categories were associated with higher health system costs. There was little evidence of direct complementarity or substitution between different staff groups.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Introduction of new roles to support GPs does not have straightforward effects on quality or patient satisfaction. Problems can arise from the complex adaptation required to adjust practice organisation and from the novelty of these roles to patients. These findings suggest caution over the implementation of policies encouraging more employment of different professionals in primary care .

Section: 1. Introduction

For several decades general practice in England has suffered a workforce crisis, which can be framed as a shortage of General Practitioners (GPs), nurses and support staff or more broadly as a mismatch between demand and capacity ( Majeed, 2017 ; Bodenheimer and Smith, 2013 ). Alongside failures in GP recruitment and retention, the NHS has been experiencing a stagnation in the training and recruitment of new nurses and a related sharp increase in the number of nursing vacancies ( Buchan et al., 2019 ; Spooner et al., 2020 ). . The situation has been exacerbated by pressures on the National Health Service (NHS) budget, the transfer of care from hospital to community settings, and demographic changes ( Gale et al., 2015 ; Robertson et al., 2017 ; National Health Service, 2019 ). In addition to this difficult starting situation, the disruptions to care caused by the Covid-19 pandemic generated a large backlog of elective care which is expected to increase the burden on primary care services in the years to come ( Macdonald et al., 2020 ).
These trends have contributed to the increased workload pressure on GPs and nurses ( Gibson et al., 2018 ; Walker et al., 2020 ; Spooner et al., 2020 ). High workload reduces job satisfaction and may harm recruitment and retention, further exacerbating the problem ( Cheshire et al., 2017 ; Van Greuningen, Heiligers, and Van der Velden, 2012 ). The increased burden on existing staff is detrimental for the quality of care provided ( Sizmur and Raleigh, 2018 ; Hobbs et al., 2016 ) and for the mental health of staff themselves, especially among the nursing workforce ( Monsalve-Reyes et al., 2018 ; Dall’Ora et al., 2020 ). As a result, new generations of GPs have expressed preferences for a better work-life balance a desire for reduced time commitments, and earlier retirement ( Lloyd and Brenda, 2006 ; Cheshire et al., 2017 ).
In response to these complex long-term trends in healthcare supply and demand, two main strategies have emerged. Firstly, policymakers in England have pushed for an increase in recruitment of GPs and improvement in retention and workforce planning strategies, although this is proving difficult to realise ( Beech et al., 2019 ; Primary Care Workforce Commission, 2015 ; Anderson et al., 2021 ).
Secondly, new non-medical clinical roles have been proposed. Deployment of practitioners from allied health professions who can contribute to the delivery of care in practice-based multidisciplinary teams is intended to relieve workload pressures on GPs and nurses. For example, the UK GP Forward View, published in 2016, committed to employing 5,000 more clinical staff such as pharmacists, nurses and physician associates, alongside 5,000 more GPs ( NHS England 2016 ). The NHS Long Term Plan ( National Health Service, 2019 ) went further, committing significant funding to support groups of GP practices (collaborating in Primary Care Networks) to employ a wide range of staff in so-called ‘additional roles’, including social prescribers, clinical pharmacists , paramedics , physician associates (British Medical Association and NHS England 2019 ). Alongside tackling nursing shortages and broadly improving retention and working conditions, adapting the skill mix in primary care to the new challenges of the 21st century is also a key action proposed by the NHS Interim People Plan ( NHS England 2019 ). Importantly, this trend of skill-mix adaptation in primary care is common to most high-income countries ( Freund et al., 2015 ; Josi and De Pietro, 2019 ).
In this context it is important to understand whether and how the changing skill-mix in general practices affects the outcomes of care provision by practices. A central unresolved question is the extent to which these new professionals in general practice act as substitutes for GPs, or complement care traditionally delivered by GPs and nurses ( Dixon et al., 2010 ; Dennis et al., 2009 ). Although this can also be examined in terms of processes of care, we focus on substitution and complementarity in terms of outcomes.
The impact of some roles appears clearer than others. For example, clinical pharmacists contribute towards detailed tasks related to medicine prescription, reducing the burden of these activities for existing staff ( Salisbury, 2018 ; Yeung and Mohammed, 2018 ; Nabhani-Gebara et al., 2020 ). On the other hand, physician associates seem to contribute by independently managing ‘less complex’ patients ( Drennan et al., 2018 ). The expansion of nursing in primary care is also a major lever to alleviate GPs' workload ( Rashid, 2010 ). For example, depending on their training and support, advanced nurse practitioners can effectively manage acute ‘same day’ patients, allowing GPs to focus on complex patients ( Evans et al., 2020 ). Whilst some evidence suggests positive contributions to overall care processes and reductions in costs, many authors have called for further research to explore the complex interactions and trade-offs that occur as skill-mix changes ( Sibbald et al., 2004 ; Nelson, 2018 ; Richardson et al., 1998 ; Bosley and Dale, 2008 ; Buchan et al., 2002 ). For example, an international scoping review found that the successful implementation of the advanced nurse practitioners role in primary care was influenced by the extent to which the working environment fosters collaboration among healthcare professionals, and by the team consensus about roles and integration into the wider team ( Torrens et al., 2020 ). The same is likely to apply to other roles, although differences in design, regulation, resources, roles, and expectations in different health systems make the comparative analysis of policies addressing workforce shortage and composition across countries very difficult ( Spooner et al., 2022 ; Buchan et al., 2002 ).
Overall, the existing literature does not provide conclusive evidence on the effects of including these new roles in primary care. Most current evidence is focused on a limited set of outcomes, types of professionals, and healthcare organisations ( Pianori et al., 2021 ). We report the findings of a study using nationwide data for England, for a wide range of primary care outcomes at organisational level, and measuring skill-mix across multiple professional roles. The setting of the English NHS is particularly interesting for three main reasons. Firstly, primary care is delivered by a large number of independent general practitioners with substantial autonomy in staffing decisions but also facing the influence of higher-level organisations (e.g. clinical commissioning groups, primary care networks) including direct incentives to broaden skill-mix. This creates wide variation in the number and type of roles employed in GP practices across England. Secondly, the unified nation-wide NHS system offers a quasi-universal availability of detailed linked administrative data. Finally, given the size of its infrastructure and workforce, and the complex nature of its activity ( Bailey, 2020 ), the English NHS can offer interesting insights on the effect of expanding skill-mix in primary care relevant to a broader international audience ( Mossialos et al., 2018 ).
Most of the existing evidence is also based on cross-sectional data ( Aiken and Douglas, 2017 ; Gibson et al., 2022 ). The main limitation of these studies is that associations between skill-mix diversification and outcomes may be caused by unobserved heterogeneity (i.e. unmeasured factors influencing both outcomes and skill-mix, for example case-mix) or reverse causality (i.e. changes to skill-mix in response to outcomes). To overcome these limitations, we analyse a five-year panel of all primary care practices in England.
Finally, the majority of studies examining the effects of skill-mix on primary care outcomes make the over-simplified assumption that the underlying production process is a simple linear additive function of staff inputs, rather than considering the non-linear and interrelated nature of staff group marginal contributions to outcomes ( Dixon et al., 2010 ; Pianori et al., 2021 ).
Any structural analysis of the relationship between inputs and outputs - in healthcare and other economic activities – entails assuming a model for the production process ( Griffin et al., 1987 ). In selecting the most appropriate empirical model, balance between flexibility, implied theoretical assumptions, and the implications of functional forms is required. Our study is focused on production processes of GP practices, which include strong human/behavioural components in their daily activities. This suggests that flexible formulations are more appropriate than strict functional forms, which are better suited for technically efficient production procedures ( Olsen et al., 2013 ; Gaynor and Pauly, 1990 ; Thurston and Libby, 2002 ).
In summary, this paper addresses a gap in the literature on the implications of skill-mix change for primary care outcomes using a large representative longitudinal dataset and analysing a broad set of outcomes at patient, practice, and health system level.

Section: 2. Methods

Firstly, we examine how skill-mix changes over time are associated with changes in patient-level outcomes across primary care practices in England. Building on a previous framework (S. M. Campbell, Roland, and Buetow, 2000 ), we identify 10 outcomes classified into two broad dimensions of quality of primary care (accessibility and effectiveness) across three separate components (structure, process, and outcome). Secondly, we explore how workforce changes are associated with later changes in health system costs. This approach allows us to study consequences experienced by patients and the healthcare system, covering the main areas of interest in the broad spectrum of activities in primary care.
We obtained data from NHS Digital on the range of practitioners employed in practices across England. We created a longitudinal practice-level workforce dataset using the practice-level General Practice Workforce Datasets. These data contain both headcount and full-time equivalent (FTE) employment for 38 categories of staff (5 GP categories, 8 nurse categories, 16 direct patient care categories and 9 admin categories). This data is updated regularly, with new staff roles being added as they emerge; we worked closely with NHS Digital to understand the nature of the data. For our analysis, we compiled workforce information from 2015 to 2019; the most recent data we report is from the quarterly update to September 2019. In this latest update, out of the 6,867 practices for whom some workforce data was available, there was complete data for all variables for 6,296 (91.8%) practices. The excluded practices had implausible or missing information for some key variables.
We focus on categories of staff responsible for directly providing healthcare to patients. Following the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of health workers ( World Health Organization, 2010 ), we define four distinct primary care staff groups: General Practitioners (GPs), Nurses, Healthcare Professionals (HPs), and Healthcare Associate Professionals (HAPs). The HPs group includes staff with a direct involvement in clinical assessment and delivery of therapeutic interventions. HAPs include supporting staff providing patient treatment but without higher level skills and responsibilities. Table 1 shows the mapping between NHS roles observed in the General Practice Workforce Dataset and the four WHO staff groups. Table 1 . Staff groups based on WHO healthcare staff classification. WHO staff group NHS roles included GPs Partners Salaried GPs Locum GPs Nurses Practice Nurses Advanced and Specialist Nurses Healthcare Professionals (HPs) Pharmacists Physiotherapists Physician Associates Paramedics Podiatrists Counsellors Occupational and other therapists Other allied health professionals Healthcare Associate Professionals (HAPs) Dispensers Health Care Assistants Nurse Associates Pharmacy technicians Psychological well-being practitioners Social Prescribing Link Workers Apprentices (therapists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and others) Source: Based on World Health Organisation classification (2010).
In selecting our outcomes of interest we followed the conceptual framework developed by Campbell, Roland and Buetow (S. M. Campbell, Roland, and Buetow, 2000 ). This framework, building upon previous work by Donabedian (2005) , decomposes quality of primary care for individual patients into two main dimensions (accessibility and effectiveness) and three related sub-components (health care system or structure; patient-centred care or process; consequences of care or outcome). Unfortunately, the limited data available and linked to practices restricted our choice set substantially.
To measure practice activity and accessibility (structure component of quality) we use data from the GP Patient Survey (GPPS), whose respondents report how recently they had seen a GP or Nurse. In absence of more precise data on the number of consultations in each practice, we use these measures as proxy indicators of practice activity, with the assumption that shorter intervals indicate higher volumes of activity. Unfortunately, due to a change in the survey questions, this outcome is only available for the first three years (2015–2017).
To capture the dimension of effectiveness (process component of quality) we explore three separate indicators.
Firstly, to measure clinical effectiveness, we use data from the national pay-for-performance scheme for primary care, the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). For each practice, we obtained the total number points awarded in the clinical domains as a global marker of the technical quality of patient care. We express QOF achievement as a percentage of maximum points achievable.
Secondly, to explore another specific area of clinical effectiveness, we obtain detailed prescribing data to focus on medicines prescribing behaviour. Since a comprehensive definition of good quality in prescribing is difficult and disputed ( Barber, 1995 ), we use two separate indicators to capture different aspects of prescribing behaviour. Given the globally recognized problem of antibiotic resistance , we measure the percentage of all antibiotics prescribed that were narrow-spectrum. The underlying assumption is that a higher share of narrow-spectrum antibiotics represents an overall sign of good prescribing behaviour ( Melander et al., 2018 ; Pont et al., 2017 ). Additionally, we measure the overall volume of prescriptions using total number of items per patient.
With regards to the outcome component of quality, we explore changes in user experiences (and to some extent in the effectiveness of interpersonal care) using self-reported satisfaction (1) with making an appointment and (2) with overall practice experience from the GPPS (J. Campbell et al., 2009 ).
To explore health system costs (i.e. the cost of care dimension of the outcome component of quality) our main data source are the NHS Payment to Practices series and the prescribing records. These data include NHS payments to individual providers of general practice services in England, but do not include prescribing expenditure nor use of secondary care . Hence, payments to practices represent only a proportion of NHS expenditure on services delivered or generated by general practices. To address this issue, we compute the total NHS expenditure for each practice, summing payments made to practices, prescribing expenditure, and expenditure associated with hospital care based on volumes of hospital care and official NHS tariffs. We focus on NHS expenditure rather than costs to practices, hence treating staff salaries and other costs to practices as covered by the payments they receive from the NHS. Given limits to the availability of hospital activity data, this variable is available only for years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Hence, we also analyse NHS expenditure excluding secondary care (NHS payments to practices and prescription costs). Finally, because GP-prescribed medicines represent a significant proportion of overall expenditure on community dispensed prescriptions, we measure prescribing costs as a separate expenditure component, computing it as the net ingredient cost divided by the number of items prescribed. Appendix 1 includes further details about the construction of our NHS expenditure indicators.
To facilitate the interpretation of our results for primary care outcomes, we standardize all these outcomes to z-scores using mean and standard deviation in the relevant analytical sample. Additionally, to avoid the potential influence of outliers we trim our sample below the 1st and above the 99th percentiles for each outcome. To adjust the skewness in the distribution of expenditure data, we apply a logarithmic transformation. A detailed list of outcomes and sources is included in Appendix 2 .
Finally, we included some relevant contextual characteristics of GP practices that could affect healthcare provision. These control variables are described in Appendix 3, whilst we Appendix 1 indicate the source of the variables.
Building on previous literature modelling production processes of multi-output hospitals and physician practices, we adopted a flexible cubic production function specification ( Delhy et al., 2020 ; Carey, 1997 ; Mitchell and Carey, 2016 ), allowing interactions between GP and other roles (Nurses, HPs and HAPs). This flexible cubic specification has been found to approximate well the popular translog formulation, with the advantage of imposing fewer constraints on both the theoretical and empirical requirements ( Delhy et al., 2020 ).
We explore the association between outcomes and staffing levels by exploiting the full panel structure of our data, featuring repeated yearly observations of the same GP practices.
Our empirical specification uses a flexible function as follows: (1) y i t j = β × f 3 ( S t a f f i t ) + ξ × Staff _ interactions it + γ × Practice i t + τ × Year t + u i + ε i t
In equation (1) , y i , t j is the observed value for outcome j ∈ J for practice i in year t , where all J outcomes are listed in Table 2 . The vector S t a f f i , t represents the level of staff FTE for our 4 roles (GPs, Nurses, HPs, and HAPs) for practice i in year t . We modelled the role of staff in the production process of practice i using a cubic polynomial f 3 ( S t a f f i , t ) , with the vector β capturing the related coefficients. The vector Staff _ interactions it models potential outcome-level dependencies between GPs and other staff groups. The vector Practice i , t includes the comprehensive set of practice-level covariates described in Appendix 4. Y e a r t is a vector of year fixed effects that captures common factors affecting all practices in each year (e.g. wide policy changes, changes in tariffs, etc.). Finally, u i is a time-invariant unobserved practice-specific error component, whilst ε i , t is an orthogonal error component. Table 2 .

(2000) . Observations refer to the analytical samples used in the regression models, with complete data across all covariates. Samples were trimmed below 1st and above 99th percentiles for all variables to avoid outliers.
We estimate model (1) with a fixed effects (FE) estimator, and using heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors. The FE specification aims to reduce concerns related to a potential endogeneity bias introduced by u i , differencing this term out using a within-practice transformation. This allows us to remove any latent practice-specific time-invariant heterogeneity which may affect our outcomes (e.g. practice leadership, other local circumstances), irrespective of whether it is correlated (hence requiring a fixed effects specification), or orthogonal, in which case a random effects specification is sufficient ( Greene, 2012 ; Wooldridge, 2010 ).
We also explored the robustness of the findings using a first-difference (FD) approach, exploring changes between the first and last period available (i.e. “long differences”). On the one hand, this approach allows to focus on more substantial differences in staffing at the level of practices, which display a limited variability from year to year. On the other hand, long differences are computed only for primary care practices that are active and observed in both the first and last period considered, hence reducing generalisability. This allows us to focus on a sub-sample of relatively stable GP practices, excluding the potential noise introduced by newcomers that may need time to optimise internal processes, or GP practices that have already decided to close down. However, the focus of long differences on net changes between first and last period fails to capture year to year and shorter-term changes in staff, potentially missing part of the impacts of staffing on outcomes. Analogously to our main FE approach, a FD estimator on long differences allows us to account for unobserved time-invariant practice characteristics. Formally, we estimate the following empirical specification: (2) Δ y i j = β ~ × f 3 Δ S t a f f i + ξ ~ ΔStaff _ interactions i + γ ~ × Δ Practice i + Ε i
Here, the vector Δ y i j represents the difference between first ( t ) and last ( T ) period available for outcome j ∈ J and practice i . Similarly, Δ S t a f f i represents changes in staffing levels for practice i over the same period. Similarly to (1), we use a cubic polynomial specification f 3 ( Δ S t a f f i ) to model the role of changes in staffing in the production process at GP practice level. We also include interaction terms between changes in GPs FTE and changes in other staff groups ( ΔStaff _ interactions i ). Finally, Ε i = ε i , T − ε i , t is an autocorrelated error term. We estimate the model in (2) using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), reporting standard errors robust to unspecified heteroscedasticity.
We report the results for all specifications computing marginal effects on the outcome for unit-changes in each staff FTE, holding other variables at their median values. We estimate our models for a trimmed sample which excludes the bottom and top percentile of the distribution. However, we also check the stability of the results in the full non-trimmed sample. All analyses are conducted using the statistical software Stata, version 17.

Section: 3. Results

Table 2 describes the distribution and variability of our staffing variables and outcomes on their original scales. In our sample, Staff FTEs increased over time for all the role groups considered (except for HAPs in 2019). The strongest growth is observed for Healthcare Professionals, whose number of FTE rose on average by a factor of 7 (from 0.04 FTE per practice in 2015 to 0.28 in 2019, or a 0.24 FTE change in the sub-sample of practices observed in 2015 and 2019). This trend is consistent with the well-known trend of change in the skill-mix of healthcare providers in English primary care.
The patient-reported time interval since their last GP and Nurse appointment also increased slightly. Whilst average QOF achievement and prescribing activity shows mild increases in terms of quality (percentage of narrow-spectrum antibiotics over total antibiotics prescribed) and quantity. Over our study period there has been a negative trend in patient satisfaction. In line with the overall increasing trend in health spending ( OECD, 2022 ), average NHS payments to GP practices increased steadily.
In Appendix 3 we report histograms describing the distribution of z-scores of outcomes and log-transformed expenditure variables, pooling all years available. The distributions of our trimmed outcomes appear overall well-behaved.
The sample of GP practices varies across years due to missing data and natural compositional changes (e.g. closures and openings of new practices), causing some sample attrition in our data, as suggested by the variability in sample size across years. In Appendix 4 we explore the nature of attrition our sample and show that - based on the set of covariates used in our analysis - the characteristics of practices remain relatively stable over time.
Our main results are reported in Table 3 as marginal effects of unit changes in staff FTE, for the median practice. Full regression results for all FE models are reported in Appendix 6. An increase in the number of GPs increases patient experience and items prescribed and decreases the percentage of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. The marginal effects for unit changes in Nurses FTE were positive and significant for total QOF points achieved and for prescribing outcomes: the percentage of narrow-spectrum antibiotics and the items prescribed both increase slightly. Our analysis also suggests that additional Nurse FTE is associated with a reduction in time since last appointment with a Nurse. All effects related to GPs and Nurses FTE are very small in magnitude, roughly between 0.01 and 0.03 standard deviations in the outcome for a 1-unit change in FTE. The influence of Health Professionals and Healthcare Associate Professionals on outcomes is different. A one FTE increase in HPs is associated with drops in patient satisfaction with making an appointment (−0.116 standard deviations, 95% CI [−0.161, −0.0708]) and overall (−0.126 standard deviations, CI [−0.175, −0.0775]). These effects are relatively large compared to the magnitudes measured for GPs and Nurses. Table 3 . Marginal effects for unit-changes in staff FTE across all outcomes.

On the other hand, a unit change in HAP FTE is associated with slight decreases in overall patient satisfaction and a modest increase in prescription volumes. The marginal effects related to HAPs are again small in magnitude, roughly between 0.005 and 0.03 standard deviations in the outcome.
The results for our measures of cost of care (prescribing costs and NHS expenditure) are reported in the last part of Table 3 . Over our limited study period, all staff categories are associated with very small increases in expenditure, although these increases are not statistically significant in relation to HPs and HAPs for total NHS expenditure.
The results obtained applying our main approach to the full non-trimmed sample (Appendix 7) are fully consistent with our main findings.

Overall, our results reveal very limited interaction in the production of outcomes by GPs and other staff groups. All estimated coefficients are very small in magnitude, and most are not statistically significant. Regarding Nurses, the only significant effect is a negative interaction for the time since last appointment with a GP. Albeit small in magnitude, this estimate may indicate complementarity between GPs and Nurses, potentially with the latter facilitating the work of GPs and ultimately increasing their volume of consultations.
We also find moderate evidence of a detrimental substitution effect between the work of GPs and the work of HPs and HAPs across the indicators of quality of care explored in our analysis. Additionally, increasing simultaneously the number of GPs and HAPs increases the volume of prescriptions slightly more than the independent contribution of the two staff categories, suggesting some complementarity. This effect could be driven by the inclusion of Dispensers in the broader HAPs definition, or by contacts with additional patients.
Finally, we find little evidence of interactions in terms of health system costs. Nurses appear to make GPs work slightly less expensive. We find a similar small negative interaction between GPs and HPs for the NHS payments to practices that exclude secondary care .
The FD results are remarkably close to FE, both in terms of magnitude and in terms of precision ( Table 5 ). There are only two notable differences related to Healthcare Professionals. Table 5 .

Firstly, the analysis of long differences suggests a positive and significant effect (0.1 standard deviations, CI 0.0499–0.164) on the percentage of narrow antibiotics prescribed. This result can be explained by the inclusion of Pharmacist in the HPs category. Secondly, we find a positive effect of unit changes in HP FTE on the time since the last appointment with a GP, as well as a small substitution effect in appointment volume between HPs and GPs ( Table A8.3 ). These coefficients are estimated with very little precision in our FE models, exploiting year to year changes in staff FTE. Our interpretation is that the findings are likely due to the wider difference in FTE employed for this specific staff category when exploiting long differences.
To better visualize the limited differences in results obtained with FE and FD, Appendix 8 also includes coefficient plots for both analyses.

Section: 4. Discussion

We found that a higher number of GPs and Nurses is generally positive for accessibility and user experience. In contrast, triangulating the results of fixed effects and long differences regression models, we found substantial evidence of independent detrimental effects on patient satisfaction of additional Health Professionals and Healthcare Associate Professionals, as well as a detrimental substitution effect between GPs and HPs for two dimensions of patient satisfaction.
As expected, increases in FTE in the staff group that includes Pharmacists (i.e. HPs) is associated with better medicines prescribing. The positive effect of unit changes in HP FTE on the time since the last appointment with a GP could indicate a shift of some activities from GPs to other clinicians included in the HP category. This latter hypothesis is supported by the positive and significant interaction coefficient between GP and HPs in the long differences model (see Appendix 8).
Finally, our analysis also suggests that additional FTE across all staff categories are associated with higher NHS expenditure, overall and also when we exclude secondary care costs. We also find a small cost-saving substitution effect between GPs and Nurses, suggesting that additional Nurses make the GPs activity more efficient economically.
Our study has some relevant limitations. Firstly, despite a wide range of reliable data sources and detailed information on staff employed, these new roles continue to account for only a small proportion of the overall general practice workforce. This prevented us from disentangling the effects of distinct professions , forcing us to generate four larger staff categories and limiting the power of our statistical analyses. To this end, future research could exploit the introduction of primary care networks in England– after these organisations gain the necessary inertia – to explore the influence of skill-mix on practice-level outcomes on a finer level of detail in terms of staff roles ( Nussbaum et al., 2021 ). Secondly, we were limited in the selection of outcomes by the lack of practice-level data on primary care activity volumes and access to care. Our second-best solution was to rely on average number of months elapsed since patients last saw a GP and a Nurse. Finally, although we included several population and practice characteristics that may affect the relationship between workforce composition and outcomes, we cannot completely rule out a potential bias due to relevant omitted variables. We mitigate these concerns by accounting for time-invariant sources of unobserved heterogeneity with our longitudinal regression approach.
Our results are in line with previous ( Dennis et al., 2009 ; Rashid, 2010 ; Aiken and Douglas, 2017 ) and more recent evidence ( Gibson et al., 2022 ) of the impact of changing skill-mix. Policy narratives around the introduction of new roles into primary care suggest that a main goal is to relieve pressure on GPs ( Sibbald et al., 2004 ; Nelson, 2018 ; Richardson et al., 1998 ; Buchan et al., 2002 ). Contrary to expectation ( Dixon et al., 2010 ; Sibbald et al., 2004 ; Bosley and Dale, 2008 ), our study suggests that the introduction of other professionals to support GPs does not necessarily have straightforward effects on quality or satisfaction. In addition, beyond the few examples mentioned above, our analysis found limited evidence of interaction (either substitution or complementarity) between the role of GPs and other roles, suggesting that they contribute independently to outcomes and quality in primary care. Regarding these aspects, compared to the previous literature, our study offers stronger evidence based on longitudinal data and on a wide range of outcomes.
Recent qualitative evidence gathered by a wider research team provides observations relevant to the interpretation of these findings ( Spooner et al., 2021 , 2022 ). Firstly, the introduction of several of these new roles requires substantial supervision from GPs and complex changes to how work is organised that may ultimately reduce efficiency. Secondly, patients have reported lack of familiarity with these new professionals and their competencies as a barrier in the care experience. Thirdly, our study found significant heterogeneity even within staff groups, with practitioners with the same title performing their role quite differently. For example, some advanced nurse practitioners were able to provide care for patients with mental health problems, whilst others were not. Finally, patients tend to dislike the pattern of case escalation that comes with intermediary roles when less experienced practitioners are unable to independently deal with issues that require the attention of a more experienced colleague.
These findings have profound implications for the implementation of policies emphasising the benefits of introducing staff with non-traditional roles in primary care, such as Primary Care Networks in England ( Smith et al., 2021 ). Future research should further unpack facilitators, barriers and implications of skill-mix in primary care. For example, our analysis suggests mixed effects on patient satisfaction. The qualitative evidence described above points to patient expectations as a potential driver for these changes in patient satisfaction ( Branson et al., 2003 ; Bosley and Dale, 2008 ). However, other drivers such as an increased workload putting more time pressure on staff (hence less time to spend with patients) or causing a decrease in staff motivation could also be combining with patient expectations to determine poor user experiences. The rich set of quantitative data available on the activity of GP practices across England – for example from the GPPS - could help to confirm or disprove these hypotheses.
Furthermore, the patterns of heterogeneity in our results suggest that some roles might be more directly linked to positive changes in outcomes (e.g. pharmacists and prescribing). Yet, increasing skill-mix is typically promoted as a monolithic approach without much detail on the rationale for introducing the different roles and or the mechanisms of integration (e.g. the role of supervision). To successfully inform the development of future policies, research will need to focus on the heterogeneity in the effects of skill-mix with a finer level of detail on the different staff groupings, and a clearer understanding of the factors affecting how individual practitioners perform their roles.
Finally, increasing the skill-mix involves trade-offs between different new roles, reflecting different relative costs and benefits of different staff groups. For example, for a practice manager, the marginal decision to hire one additional physician associate instead of a pharmacist will depend on the (financial) costs and benefits at practice level that are attached to these roles and will also affect the availability of resource to hire other additional staff. It will also depend upon the local availability of staff to fill those roles. Future work in this area should consider these trade-offs at the workforce planning stage by simultaneously modelling decision making and labour supply factors, as they will shape the success of policies targeting skill-mix change.
