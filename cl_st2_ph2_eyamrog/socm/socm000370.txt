Title: Correlates of early stimulation activities among mothers of children under age two in Siaya County, Kenya: Maternal mental health and other maternal, child, and household factors


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Rationale

The first two to three years of life are critical for early child development (ECD), which affects later life trajectories in health, development, and earning potential. Global calls for early stimulation activities to support optimal development among young children are increasing and there is a need to better understand the factors associated with maternal engagement in early stimulation activities, particularly maternal mental health .

Abstract_Section: Objective

This study examined important factors associated with early stimulation activities performed by mothers of children ages 0–2 in rural Kenya.

Abstract_Section: Methods

Baseline cohort data from an evaluation of an integrated maternal mental health and an ECD intervention included 374 interviews with mothers of children under 24 months. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed.

Abstract_Section: Results

Maternal mental health was not associated with maternal early stimulation activities. Having worked in the past week was associated with more frequent early stimulation activities. At the child level, female sex was associated with more frequent early stimulation activities but prematurity at birth was associated with less frequent early stimulation activities. At the household level, ownership of children's toys and books was associated with more frequent early stimulation activities.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

This study indicates that both mothers and families could benefit from availability of ECD-friendly resources such as homemade toys and children's books (particularly for low-income families), and tailored messaging to support early stimulation activities for both girl and boy children and for those prematurely-born. Local governments and community-based programs can aim to both raise awareness about the importance of early childhood development and educate caregivers on specific age-appropriate early stimulation activities that promote optimal growth. Future research should also explore the reciprocal and temporal relationships between maternal mental health and early stimulation activities to inform and elucidate their potential synergistic impact on ECD.

Section: 1. Introduction

Globally, about 43% of under-5 children are at risk of not reaching their full developmental potential due to risk factors such as stunting and poverty ( Black et al., 2017 ). Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of under-5 children at such risk (66%) ( Black et al., 2017 ). Optimal health and development require a life course perspective and early childhood is a particularly critical and sensitive period in which later life trajectories in terms of health, development, and earning potential are affected ( Black et al., 2017 ; Chan et al., 2016 ; Daelmans et al., 2016 ; Machel, 2016 ).
Global research, policies, and practices regarding early childhood development (ECD) have dramatically increased in the last decade with significant attention being garnered via the Lancet Series on ECD in 2007 ( Engle et al., 2007 ; Grantham-Mcgregor et al., 2007 ; Walker et al., 2007 ), 2011 ( Engle et al., 2011 ; Walker et al., 2011 ) and 2016 ( Black et al., 2017 ; Britto et al., 2017 ; Richter et al., 2017 ). Increasing numbers of publications in the field have resulted in a significant accumulation of evidence for what shapes early development ( Black et al., 2017 ; Britto et al., 2017 ; Chan et al., 2016 ). Breakthrough studies in health, nutrition, psychology, and neuroscience have produced convincing empirical evidence that utilizing essential health services, adequate nutrition, child safety, and protection, responsive caregiving and early learning and stimulation in the first two to three years of life have an important contribution to children's development ( Black et al., 2017 ; Britto et al., 2017 ). Collectively, these components are brought together in the recently released Nurturing Care Framework developed by WHO, UNICEF, and the World Bank and also in the WHO guideline on improving ECD ( Black et al., 2017 ; Britto et al., 2017 ; World Health Organization, 2020 ; World Health Organization et al., 2018 ). In conjunction with the life course perspective, the five components of nurturing care are designed to have protective effects on children's development in their early years, which in turn sets off a cascade of positive effects on later life stages such as mid-childhood, adolescence, adulthood and even on the lives of future generations ( Black et al., 2017 ).
Responsive caregiving and early learning, two of the five components of the Nurturing Care Framework , encompass child-caregiver social and emotional bonding through physical and eye contact, positive facial expressions (smiling), gestures and vocalizations (talking and singing), engaging in playful acts, exploring new environments and learning through children's books, toys and other play materials among others ( Black et al., 2017 ; World Health Organization et al., 2018 ). While there are increasing intervention trials to promote early stimulation by caregivers, the evidence base on what supports and predicts these caregiver-mediated early stimulation and early learning behaviors for children is limited, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa ( Jeong et al., 2018 ). There is also a dearth of information on which types of age-appropriate early stimulation activities are being performed by caregivers in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Only a few qualitative studies have examined caregiver motivations and barriers to ECD-promoting behaviors in this context ( Gladstone et al., 2018 ; Hollowell et al., 2019 ). For example, in Burkina Faso, Hollowell et al. conducted focus groups with mothers, fathers, and grandmothers living in rural villages with no electricity, running water, or paved roads to essential health, education, and commercial services ( Hollowell et al., 2019 ). Study participants were mainly involved with agricultural activities and stimulation activities as well as responsive caregiving was largely limited. Participants reported engaging in behaviors that were primarily instructive although they were receptive to broadening their ECD activities. Barriers to practicing ECD stimulation and responsive caregiving behaviors included limited time to spend with the baby, unpleasant couple relationship, the beliefs that a baby's character or intelligence is predetermined and that too much praise will bring negative child outcomes ( Hollowell et al., 2019 ). Similar findings have also been reported in Malawian context by Gladstone et al. (2018) . Mothers, fathers, and grandparents from rural fishing and agricultural villages as well as from urban and sub-urban areas were recruited for in-depth interviews, focus groups, participatory research focus groups, and observations ( Gladstone et al., 2018 ). In Malawi, children's play was considered more as a sign of children being healthy rather than as something that promotes their opportunities for learning and development ( Gladstone et al., 2018 ). Gladstone et al. also thematically categorizes barriers to early stimulation, responsive caregiving, and communication according to the multiple levels described in the socio-ecological framework. These barriers ranged from those pertaining to the child-level to the caregiver-child dyad level, the community level and the cultural and policy levels ( Gladstone et al., 2018 ).
The current study incorporates potentially important factors identified using the socio-ecological framework to bridge the existing knowledge gap for what supports and predicts maternal early stimulation behaviors in rural Kenya. Specifically, our study considers maternal-, child-, and household-level factors (see Methods).
At the maternal level, for example, maternal mental health is identified a priori as theoretically important in predicting early stimulation activities because prior literature highlights its role in affecting parenting quality and children's development ( Herba et al., 2016 ; Wachs et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, positive maternal mental health may strengthen the bidirectional relationship between quality maternal engagement and children's development as clear developmental signals can elicit greater levels of stimulation from the mothers. Past studies have reported this bidirectional, transactional relationship between parental engagement and children's development ( Barnett et al., 2012 ; Paschall and Mastergeorge, 2016 ; Tucker-Drob and Harden, 2012 ). Maternal mental health has also been prioritized by the WHO guideline on improving ECD ( World Health Organization, 2020 ). The new guideline recommends supporting maternal mental health and integrating psychosocial interventions into ECD programming ( World Health Organization, 2020 ).
The aims of the current study are 1) to examine which age-appropriate early stimulation activities are being performed most and least frequently by mothers of children under age two, 2) to determine whether maternal mental health is associated with performing age-appropriate early stimulation activities by mothers of children under age two, and 3) to identify other maternal, child-related, and household level factors associated with performing age-appropriate early stimulation activities by mothers of children under age two in Siaya County, Kenya. Findings of our study will support the evidence base for the Nurturing Care Framework by identifying important maternal-, child-, and household-level predictors for maternal early stimulation in rural Kenya.

Section: 2. Methods

Data for this study come from a parent study for a longitudinal impact evaluation of the Integrated Mothers and Babies Course & Early Childhood Development program (iMBC/ECD) delivered by Catholic Relief Services in Siaya County, Kenya ( Kim et al., 2021 ).
Data were obtained from a pre-intervention baseline survey. The iMBC/ECD program, informed by cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, was designed to support pregnant women and mothers with children below the age of two years to successfully manage daily stressors, particularly related to the pregnancy period and childrearing , to mitigate depression symptoms in the future. Key ECD messages were also integrated into the iMBC curriculum. Study eligibility at enrollment included women who were pregnant and/or who had a child under the age of 24 months old. Trained facilitators met with groups/clusters of women every two weeks over a 7-month intervention period and mother/index child dyads were followed up for about two years. Within Siaya county, Rarieda sub-county was selected as the intervention area and Ugunja sub-county was selected as the control area. Twenty-three groups/clusters were facilitated in the intervention area, while 30 were facilitated in the control area. Key ECD messages were also delivered bi-weekly to the control group. For this study using baseline data from both sub-counties, the two sub-counties were used to assess and compare residence-level factors as detailed in the study setting section.
The baseline questionnaire included questions on maternal early stimulation activities based on the age of the index child, maternal mental health , sociodemographic and reproductive health background questions among others. In total, 417 participants (193 women in Rarieda sub-county and 224 women in Ugunja sub-county) were surveyed at baseline (August 2018). Of the 417 participants, there were 374 non-pregnant women with at least one child 0–24 months of age and 43 women who were pregnant. The number of observations relevant for this analysis was therefore 374 women (with at least one child 0–24 months of age). The number of women with complete data on the predictors of interest was 361 women. Since the number of observations containing missing values was only about 4% of the total available observations, no imputation was performed.
All participants provided written informed consent . The study received ethical approval from the Duke University Campus IRB (#2018-0595) and from Maseno University Ethics Review Committee (#MUS/DRP/MUERC/00587/18) in Kenya.
In 2019, the populations of Rarieda and Ugunja sub-counties were around 152,570 and 104,241 people respectively ( Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2019 ). For population density, Rarieda sub-county had fewer number of people per square kilometer than Ugunja sub-county (379 vs. 519 people per square kilometer respectively), and for the average household size, both Rarieda and Ugunja sub-counties were around 4 members per household (4.1 vs. 3.9 members per household respectively) ( Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2019 ). In terms of healthcare availability, Rarieda sub-county had a total of 37 health facilities compared to 19 health facilities in Ugunja sub-county ( County Government of Siaya, 2018 ). At the county level, the doctor-to-population ratio (1:17236) and the nurse-to-population ratio (1:1997) were much lower compared to the national average in Kenya (1:8500 and 1:600 respectively) ( County Government of Siaya, 2018 ), indicating less healthcare access. In addition, nearly 49% of the population in Siaya county participated in the labor force in 2018, most in agriculture , ( County Government of Siaya, 2018 ), which was much lower than the national average of around 74% ( The World Bank, 2021 ).
In order to increase the quality and access to pre-primary early childhood education for under-5 children who make up about 17% of the total county population, Siaya county has continued to build ECD education centers and recruit teachers ( County Government of Siaya, 2018 ); a number of donor-funded ECD programs work in the area.
The outcome variable, maternal early stimulation activities in the past 2 weeks for children 0–24 months, was coded as a continuous variable. It was constructed using a series of age-appropriate early stimulation practices suggested by UNICEF ( UNICEF & World Health Organization, 2012 ). Accordingly, different behavioral questions were asked for children 0–6 months of age (6 items), 6–9 months of age (4 items), 9–12 months of age (5 items) and 12–24 months of age (8 items) ( UNICEF & World Health Organization, 2012 ). Example items include “Talked, sang, smiled and laughed with (NAME)” for 0–6 month olds, “Given (NAME) clean, safe household things to handle, bang, and drop” for 6–9 month olds, “Pointed and named things around (NAME)'s environment” for 9–12 month olds, and “Initiated conversations with (NAME) by asking simple questions” for 12–24 month olds.
For each question, participants could have answered “never”, “rarely”, “sometimes,” or “frequently” in the past 2 weeks. To construct a single composite continuous variable, individual responses to the age-appropriate early stimulation questions were first averaged with “never” counted as 0 points, “rarely” counted as 1 point, “sometimes” counted as 2 points, and “frequently” counted as 3 points. As a result, each mother had a mean score ranging between 0 and 3 points across all child age groups. In the computation of the mean score, one mother with a child age 0–6 months was missing responses for two age-appropriate early stimulation items. For this mother, mean early stimulation score was calculated without the two items that were missing responses. The individual mean scores across all child age groups were then combined into a single composite variable measuring early stimulation for all children ages 0–24 months.
The primary explanatory variable was maternal mental health as measured by the World Health Organization's Self-Reported Questionnaire (SRQ-20) ( Beusenberg and Orley, 1994 ) which has been previously used to assess women's mental health in the extended postpartum period in Africa ( Baumgartner et al., 2016 ). The SRQ-20 items include depression, anxiety and somatic symptoms thus capturing a broader category of mental distress. A few studies conducted in the Sub-Saharan context have reported a reliability of about 0.84 for SRQ-20 ( Kootbodien et al., 2015 ; Scholte et al., 2011 ; van der Westhuizen et al., 2016 ). The reliability estimate (Cronbach's alpha) for our study sample was 0.88. In our current analysis, we use this measure as a continuous summed score, however, a commonly accepted global cut-off ( Harpham et al., 2005 ) of 7/8 showed that about 21% of our study population would be classified as having poor mental health (higher SRQ-20 scores indicate worse mental health). In order to explore the possibility that maternal depression only begins to impact early stimulation at higher levels and the assumption of a linear effect is not valid, we also examined the dichotomized version of the SRQ-20 score (8 or higher) in a separate model for comparison.
Additional explanatory variables included: (1) number of pregnancies (continuous), mother's education (binary; 1 = secondary or higher; 0 = no education or primary education), status of cohabitation with a husband/romantic partner (binary; 1 = married and living with husband or living with unmarried romantic partner; 0 = married but not living with husband, in a romantic relationship but not living together or not currently in a romantic relationship), general support from female friends and relatives in the past month (binary; question was “how much assistance did you receive from your female friends and female relatives in the last month?“; 1 = sufficient; 0 = insufficient), mother's self-reported health (binary; question was “in general, would you say your health is”; 1 = excellent, very good or good health; 0 = fair or poor health) and whether there was any work in the past week (binary; 1 = yes; 0 = no) as maternal factors; (2) female sex of the child (binary; 1 = female; 0 = male), maternal report of delivering earlier than expected/prematurity (binary; question was “did your child come earlier than expected?“; 1 = yes; 0 = no) and mother's perception of their child's health (binary; question was “in general, would you say your child's health is”; 1 = excellent, very good or good health; 0 = fair or poor health) as child-related factors; and (3) household hunger status in the past 4 weeks (binary; see Appendix), ownership of manufactured toys, homemade toys or other household objects as toys (binary; 1 = yes; 0 = no), ownership of at least one children's book (binary; 1 = yes; 0 = no) and the sub-county of residence which corresponds to intervention assignment of the iMBC/ECD program (binary; 1 = Rarieda; 0 = Ugunja) as household-level factors. Number of pregnancies was included as a proxy for parity inclusive of child loss to indicate greater familiarity and experience with childrearing and also the amount of attention that may be available for the index child in the household by the mother. Work in the past week was included as a proxy for maternal availability as it can potentially influence frequency of maternal early stimulation. Household level of hunger was included as a proxy for socioeconomic status because income- or asset-based measure of household wealth was not collected at baseline. Due to very high collinearity with number of pregnancies, mother's age was not included in the model but its mean and range are still descriptively presented. As a sensitivity analysis, however, we also examined a separate model with mother's age in place of number of pregnancies.
General data management and basic descriptive analysis were performed in Stata/SE 16.1. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) analyses were conducted to regress the continuous outcome of maternal early stimulation activities on a set of factors described above, using an identity link so that the regression coefficients have the interpretation of mean differences on the early stimulation composite variable. Clustering of the data at the group/cluster level was accounted for in the model using an exchangeable working correlation, with robust standard errors. All sensitivity analyses aforementioned were also conducted with the same specifications but results are not shown.

Section: 3. Results

The mean age of mothers in the sample was 26 years (range 17–42 years) [See Table 1 ]. The mean number of pregnancies was about 3 (range 1–10). Women in the sample had a mean maternal mental health score of 4.43 (range 0–19). About a third of the sample (34%) had secondary, college, or university education. Close to 80% were living with a husband/romantic partner. Over 60% reported that they did not have sufficient support from their female friends and female relatives in the past month. About 22% of the mothers reported that they had fair or poor health. Thirty-seven percent of women had any work in the past week (from the time of the survey). With regards to the index children, nearly 48% were female and about 17% were reported to have been born earlier than expected/prematurely. Thirteen percent of the mothers reported that their children had fair or poor health. Table 1 .

Number of observations (N) and frequency (%) were reported for categorical variables. For continuous variables, number observations (N), mean, standard deviation (std dev) and range were reported. a Higher scores indicate worse maternal mental health. b “Not living with husband/romantic partner” also includes women who are currently not in a relationship. c Participants were asked if the child was born earlier than expected.
At the household-level, about 17% experienced moderate or severe hunger in the past 4 weeks. About three-quarters (74%) also owned either manufactured toys, homemade toys, or household objects as toys. Close to 34% owned at least one children's book for their children 0–24 months in the home. Forty-five percent of the sample was in Rarieda sub-county; the remainder, 55%, was in Ugunja sub-county.
Overall, the mean early stimulation score for children ages 0 to 24 months was 1.97 and nearly 60% of the mothers reported practicing all of the measured age-appropriate early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average in the past two weeks.
Mothers with an index child ages 0–6 months had a mean early stimulation score of 1.63 and 43% of these mothers performed early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average [See Table 2 ]. Only two of the six early stimulation activities considered appropriate for children ages 0–6 months were performed “sometimes” or “frequently” in the past two weeks by more than 60% of the mothers. These activities were “gently soothing, stroking and holding child” and “talking, singing, smiling and laughing with child”. Activities that did not receive as much attention for children ages 0–6 months were “providing ways for child to see, hear, move arms and legs freely and touch the mother”, “slowly moving colorful things for child to see and reach for”, “copying child sounds or gestures” and “taking the child to different environments to enhance exploration and exposure to the environment outside the home”.

The same person was missing both items. For the purposes of the scoring, these were ignored and the participant had an average score based on the four items available. b Mean early stimulation scores were calculated by taking the average of the item scores that are relevant to the child's age range. For example, the mean early stimulation score for age range 0–6 months was calculated by averaging the item scores of 6 activities relevant for child's age 0–6 months. The response options, “Never”, “Rarely”, “Sometimes” and “Frequently” were assigned scores of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively. c Percentage of mothers practicing age-appropriate early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average was calculated by dividing the number of mothers who had mean early stimulation scores between 2 and 3 by the total number in the corresponding age range. For example, for the age range 0–6 months, the percentage of mothers practicing age-appropriate early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average was 40 divided by 94 (42.6%).
Mothers with an index child ages 6–9 months had a mean early stimulation score of 2.08 and 63% of these mothers performed early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average. All early stimulation activities considered appropriate for children ages 6–9 months were performed “sometimes” or “frequently” in the past 2 weeks by more than 60% of the mothers.
Mothers with an index child ages 9–12 months had a mean early stimulation score of 1.89 and 54% of these mothers performed early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average. Four of the five early stimulation activities considered appropriate for children ages 9–12 months were performed “sometimes” or “frequently” in the past two weeks by more than 60% of the mothers. “Playing peek-a-boo with child” was performed “sometimes” or “frequently” by 54% of the mothers for children ages 9–12 months.
Mothers with an index child ages 12–24 months had a mean early stimulation score of 2.14 and 69% of these mothers performed early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average. All early stimulation activities considered appropriate for children ages 12–24 months were performed “sometimes” or “frequently” in the past 2 weeks by around or more than 60% of the mothers.
Maternal mental health was not associated with maternal early stimulation activities for children 0–24 months (Estimate: 0.017; 95% CI: −0.005, 0.040) [See Table 3 ]. The dichotomized SRQ-20 based on the cutoff of 7/8 was also not associated with maternal early stimulation activities (Estimate: 0.146; 95% CI: 0.065, 0.356; not shown in tablesEstimate: 0.146; 95% CI: −0.065, 0.356; not shown in tables). Ownership of manufactured toys, homemade toys, or household objects as toys compared to not having any toys (Estimate: 0.535; 95% CI: 0.343, 0.727) and ownership of at least one children's book (Estimate: 0.206; 95% CI: 0.076, 0.336) were associated with more frequent maternal early stimulation activities. The index child being female was associated with more frequent maternal early stimulation activities compared to the index child being male (Estimate: 0.136; 95% CI: 0.029, 0.242).

Section: 4. Discussion

The main findings of this study have important programmatic and policy implications. About 60% of women in the sample performed early stimulation activities “sometimes” or “frequently” on average. Despite evidence of some within-county differences, there has been ongoing political commitment by the Siaya county government to prioritize ECD and prior programmatic activities in the region to promote ECD. While this finding is encouraging for a lower-resource setting, it also indicates that there is still room for improvement in promoting optimal age-appropriate early stimulation behaviors overall, especially for earlier months of infancy (0–6 months). We found that quite a few early stimulation activities considered appropriate for children ages 0–6 months were not performed sometimes or frequently by mothers in the past two weeks. Furthermore, prior studies in Burkina Faso and Malawi hint that there could be a general lack of knowledge and awareness linking early stimulation and responsive play with children's development ( Gladstone et al., 2018 ; Hollowell et al., 2019 ). Participants of these prior studies share some important similarities with participants of our current study such as living in rural areas and primarily engaging in agricultural-based income-generating activities ( Gladstone et al., 2018 ; Hollowell et al., 2019 ). Despite the similarities, cultural variation in caregiving practices has been well noted in the anthropological literature ( Levine and New, 2008 ). It is also important to acknowledge that in some contexts, child development occurs in a larger family setting that involves interactions with other members of the household ( Lancy, 2015 ). We therefore encourage future interventions to assess what is culturally acceptable and tailor their strategies to raise awareness about the benefits of engaging in appropriate stimulation activities at the household/community levels and also highlight that responsive caregiving and children's development occur in a transactional and bidirectional manner ( Barnett et al., 2012 ; Paschall and Mastergeorge, 2016 ; Tucker-Drob and Harden, 2012 ).
Maternal mental health was not associated with maternal early stimulation activities in our model. This further suggests that we cannot simply assume better maternal mental health will automatically lead to greater engagement in early stimulation activities without raising awareness about their benefits and conducting targeted education on optimal practices. Considering that the iMBC/ECD intervention was not yet implemented in the study area, it may be reasonable to expect caregiver mental health to be a necessary but insufficient determinant of early stimulation activities at baseline. Prior studies and international guidelines have highlighted maternal mental health as a vital component of nurturing care and in children's development ( Herba et al., 2016 ; Wachs et al., 2009 ; World Health Organization, 2020 ). Hence, maternal mental health as well as the broader caregiving environment need to be considered in future ECD programming in order to address the proximal, intermediate, and distal contributors to children's development outlined in the Nurturing Care Framework ( Black et al., 2017 ; World Health Organization, 2020 ; World Health Organization et al., 2018 ).
Ownership of toys and at least one children's book were associated with more frequent early stimulation activities in the model, even after controlling for household food security , which we used as a proxy measure of household wealth . This finding is also in line with a prior study examining the “association between availability of children's book and the literacy-numeracy skills of children” ( Manu et al., 2019 ). Manu et al. reported that ownership of at least one children's book at home was associated with a higher likelihood of being on track for literacy and numeracy ( Manu et al., 2019 ). It is intuitive that owning children's toys and books at home will lend itself to more frequent play using toys and books. However, ownership of these materials, regardless of household wealth, may also be measuring parents' awareness, interest and commitment to children's play and development in general. Whether the toys and books were purchased, homemade or handed down, the mere ownership of these materials may indicate that financial and/or time investments were made by the caregivers. Many women in our study sample reported owning children's toys (74%) and books (34%), which is encouraging. However, families in extreme poverty or living in rural locations may not have access to these essential resources. Ensuring that low-income families have access to basic ECD-friendly resources should be a programmatic priority. Guiding families on creating low-cost homemade toys with locally available materials can be one possible approach to de-couple availability of ECD-friendly resources from household economic status.
Having delivered earlier than expected/prematurity was associated with less frequent maternal early stimulation activities. This is in contrast to recent findings from a meta-analysis in which mothers with preterm children were as sensitive and responsive to their children's need as mothers with full-term children ( Bilgin and Wolke, 2015 ). However, the meta-analysis only looked at studies conducted in Europe and North America and thus, its implications may not be relevant for Sub-Saharan Africa ( Bilgin and Wolke, 2015 ). Mothers in our sample may have been trying to be protective of their premature children by focusing primarily on surviving. Children born prematurely may be less clear in their signals compared to those born full-term, thus eliciting basic caregiving behaviors by mothers. Depending on the level of prematurity, not performing some of the same age-appropriate early stimulation activities suited to children born full-term is understandable (i.e. exploring other environments outside the home). Nevertheless, programs should consider directly targeting parents with prematurely-born children and including developmentally appropriate materials that could help them. In addition, female sex of the child was associated with more frequent maternal early stimulation activities. Differences in parenting styles for boys versus girls have been reported in South Africa where boys reported having more authoritarian mothers than did girls ( Roman et al., 2016 ). Frequent early stimulation and responsive caregiving should be for all children.
Working in the past week was also found to be associated with more frequent maternal early stimulation activities in the past two weeks. Work in the past week was included in the model as it could have been related to women's availability and time spent with the index child. We speculate that working women may have been compensating for lost time at home by engaging in more frequent early stimulation when they were at home with their young children . However, we are not able to make definitive conclusions based on the current study.
Recent cluster-randomized trials of community-based parenting programs in low-resource settings have already shown convincing evidence that these programs can be effective in fostering ECD ( Chang et al., 2015 ; Singla et al., 2015 ; Yousafzai et al., 2014 ). For example, a program implemented in rural Uganda utilized lay community volunteers to conduct sessions on a variety of relevant topics such as interactive play with children using pictures, story-telling, and objects, provision of adequate nutrition, keeping good hygiene, using gentle discipline strategies as well as mother-care strategies for their psychosocial wellbeing ( Singla et al., 2015 ). This study found that cognitive and receptive language scores were much higher for children in the intervention group compared to those in the control group ( Singla et al., 2015 ). Maternal depression was also much lower for the intervention group as well ( Singla et al., 2015 ). The participants were recruited from rural communities in Lira district where there had previously been civil conflict ( Singla et al., 2015 ). The main income-generating activities in the region are subsistence agriculture and unskilled labor ( Singla et al., 2015 ). Evidence of program impact for a rural district in Uganda that also experienced civil conflict is an encouraging finding for other low-resourced rural communities such as the ones in the current study.
It is becoming more evident that such community-based interventions promote ECD. Important questions still remain however about how to effectively promote such interventions in varying cultural and societal contexts and the mechanisms for changing parenting outcomes via early stimulation interventions ( Jeong et al., 2018 ; Shonkoff et al., 2016 ). The current study contributes to the growing body of literature by: 1) offering important insights about age-appropriate early stimulation activities that are being performed most and least frequently by mothers of children under age two, 2) discussing contextualized perspectives on the role of maternal mental health in influencing maternal early stimulation activities, and 3) examining the effects of other maternal, child-related and household level factors on maternal early stimulation activities in a rural Kenyan context. Collectively, our findings contribute to the Nurturing Care Framework which emphasizes responsive caregiving and early learning to foster early child development. Understanding factors that are associated with maternal early stimulation and learning in rural Kenya is critical to further promoting facilitators of early stimulation activities in similar regions.
There were limitations in the study. First, this was a cross-sectional study using baseline cohort data. This has implications for the direction of effect between maternal mental health and maternal early stimulation activities. The current model is specified such that maternal mental health predicts maternal early stimulation activities. However, there is a possibility that maternal early stimulation also bidirectionally influences maternal mental health. A carefully designed longitudinal study with optimally-spaced time intervals between each data collection point will be needed to assess potential reciprocal effects ( Cole and Maxwell, 2003 ). Second, there could have been key variables omitted from the model. One example is parenting confidence or parenting self-efficacy. Greater parenting self-efficacy may be associated with more frequent maternal early stimulation activities. We were not able to include this measure in our model because the parenting self-efficacy scale (the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale) we collected had low reliability. Another example is cultural attitudes and beliefs regarding mother-child interaction. If the prevailing cultural belief is that babies do not need stimulating play for their development, then it will likely have a significant impact on the likelihood of mothers and families practicing early stimulation activities. Likewise, if the mother was not the primary caregiver, then the study would have underestimated the children's exposure to early stimulation activities. We encourage future studies to examine these potentially important factors in their models. Third, maternal early stimulation was not measured by a standardized scale. Relatedly, the psychometric properties are unknown and there is no validated scoring criteria. As a result, the overall mean early stimulation score may not have an intuitive interpretation. For example, the mean score does not distinguish between mothers who perform a few early stimulation activities very frequently and those who perform many early stimulation activities at a lower frequency. Finally, the local understanding or appropriateness of the individual items is also unknown, which has implications for validity. Despite this limitation, our study is unique in that it used age-appropriate early stimulation indicators for children ages 0–24 months. We also descriptively show which of the age-appropriate early stimulation activities mothers in our study context practiced more or less often. We believe this is an important contribution to the literature as it provides valuable contextual information about maternal early stimulation behaviors for similar regions and cultures.

Section: 5. Conclusions

There has been accumulating evidence in the literature that responsive caregiving and early stimulation behaviors promote ECD. However, identifying key determinants of early stimulation activities by parents to inform programming in Sub-Saharan Africa is still nascent. This study in Kenya indicates that both mothers and families could benefit from availability of ECD-friendly resources such as homemade toys and children's books (particularly for low-income families), and tailored messaging to support early stimulation activities for both girl and boy children and for prematurely-born children. More qualitative research on responsive caregiving/parenting practices for children ages 0–2 could help illuminate gaps in early stimulation behaviors. We also believe that programming that raises awareness more broadly about the importance of early stimulation and educates caregivers on specific age-appropriate early stimulation activities will help support county-level ECD goals. This is especially relevant in communities that may not be fully aware of the benefits of early stimulation on children's development. Finally, future research should explore the reciprocal and temporal relationships between maternal mental health and early stimulation activities in order to inform and elucidate their potential synergistic impact on ECD.
