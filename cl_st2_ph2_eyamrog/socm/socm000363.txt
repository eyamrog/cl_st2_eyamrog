Title: Can individual, dyadic, or collaborative planning reduce sedentary behavior? A randomized controlled trial ☆


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Rationale

Although effects of individual planning interventions on physical activity (PA) are well established, less is known about the relationships between planning and sedentary behavior (SB).

Abstract_Section: Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy of individual planning, dyadic planning (i.e., joint planning, targeting the behavior of one person only: the target person), and collaborative planning (i.e., joint planning and joint behavioral performance) on sedentary behavior among dyads.

Abstract_Section: Methods

Dyads ( N = 320 target persons and their partners, aged 18–90 years) were randomized into three PA planning conditions (individual, dyadic, or collaborative) or an active (education) control condition. Main outcomes, i.e., sedentary time, proportion of time spent in SB and light-intensity PA, proportion of time spent in SB and total PA were measured with GT3X-BT accelerometers at baseline, 1-week follow-up, and 36-week follow-up. Two-level models with measurement points nested in participants were fit, separately for target persons and partners.

Abstract_Section: Results

Findings for target persons obtained at 1-week follow-up indicated that in the collaborative planning condition SB time significantly decreased, compared to the control condition ( p = .013). There was an improvement in the proportion of time spent in SB and light-intensity PA ( p = .019), and the proportion of time spent in SB and total PA ( p = .018), indicating that SB time was displaced by PA. Effects of individual and dyadic planning were not significant, compared to the control condition. None of interventions had a significant effect on SB indices at 36-week follow-up. Regarding dyadic partners, there were no effects of planning interventions at 1-week follow-up or 36-week follow-up, compared to the control condition.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Collaborative planning may prompt a short-term reduction of SB time and result in a shift towards a healthier balance between SB time and PA time among target persons, who did not adhere to PA guidelines at baseline.

Section: 1. Introduction

Sedentary behavior (SB) can be defined as any waking activity characterized by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting, lying, or reclining posture ( Tremblay et al., 2017 ). SB has become prevalent across domains of human activity as a result of changes in transportation, communications, workplace, and domestic entertainment technologies ( Owen et al., 2020 ). One in five Europeans sit for more than 7.5 h each day ( Loyen et al., 2016 ). High levels of SB are associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases , such as fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes, and lower physical quality of life ( Boberska et al., 2018 ; De Rezende et al., 2014 ). The population-attributable mortality fraction estimated across 54 countries suggest that SB time may be responsible for approximately 433,000 deaths/year, representing 3.8% of all-cause mortality ( De Rezende et al., 2016 ). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults should limit the amount of SB and replace it with physical activity (PA) of any intensity to help reduce its detrimental effects on health ( WHO, 2020 ).
SB, light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are interrelated or co-dependent behaviors ( van der Ploeg and Hillsdon, 2017 ): reducing one often means incorporating more of the other behavior during the waking hours. SB, LIPA, and MVPA all refer to energy expenditure, the key difference between them referring to the levels of energy expended. Time spent on one naturally displaces time spent on another (referred to as the displacement hypothesis ; Matthews et al., 2015 ). For instance, time spent on SB may be replaced by time spent on stretching, aerobic, or strength exercises. In line with the displacement hypothesis, interventions targeting a reduction of SB time are suggesting to ‘sit less, stand up, and move more’ ( Owen et al., 2020 ). Even replacing SB for a short time (e.g., 1–10 min) may be associated with a reduced likelihood of metabolic syndrome ( Ekblom-Bak et al., 2016 ).
Since they may displace one another, it makes sense to assess SB, LIPA, and MVPA simultaneously ( Hamilton et al., 2008 ; Matthews et al., 2015 ), and consider ratios of SB versus LIPA (including such activities as standing, stretching), or SB time versus total PA time (LIPA + MVPA). Such approach may offer an insight into a healthy energy expenditure balance, characterized by less SB time and more LIPA or MVPA time ( Spittaels et al., 2012 ).
Replacing time spent on SB with bouts of PA may require not only strong intentions ( Gollwitzer and Crosby, 2018 ; Hagger et al., 2016 ), but also post-intentional self-regulatory efforts ( Sheeran and Webb, 2016 ). Theoretical models, such as the health action process approach ( Luszczynska and Schwarzer, 2020 ), suggest that planning is one of the key post-intentional predictors of behavior change . The formulation of action plans (referring to when, where, and how the individual will act) and coping plans (specifying actions to be taken if obstacles to action plans are encountered) are critical to the enactment of intentions ( Luszczynska and Schwarzer, 2020 ).
The use of planning to promote PA has been thoroughly investigated ( Bélanger-Gravel et al., 2013 ; Carraro and Gaudreau, 2013 ; Silva et al., 2018 ; Zhang et al., 2019 ) but less is known about the effects of planning on SB time reduction. The existing SB-related evidence evaluates the effects of individual planning only ( De Cocker et al., 2016 ; Maher and Conroy, 2015 ; Rollo and Prapavessis, 2020 ; Schroé et al., 2020 ), without considering the social context of planning. Research including significant others in the individuals' specific action planning and ‘if-then’ planning is needed ( Hagger et al., 2016 ), as significant others are often involved in health behavior change ( Lüscher et al., 2019 , Scholz et al., 2020 ). The present study will investigate whether individual planning and two forms of planning involving social interactions (i.e., dyadic and collaborative planning) influence SB.
Dyadic and collaborative planning refer to target persons forming plans together with a partner ( Keller et al., 2020 ; Knoll et al., 2017 ). Dyadic planning has been defined as formulating plans together with a partner which specify where, when, and how the target person will perform an intended behavior ( Burkert et al., 2011 ). The partner's role refers to supporting the target person in the planning process. By contrast, collaborative planning refers to two people jointly formulating joint plans to be enacted together ( Prestwich et al., 2012 ). To the best of our knowledge, effects of individual, dyadic, and collaborative planning have not been directly compared, previously. Moreover, research has focused on romantic dyads ( Burkert et al., 2012 ; Knoll et al., 2017 ) while joint planning of sitting and exercising together may involve other types of partners, including coworkers, family members, or friends. Among adults, hours of SB may be spent in company of coworkers (e.g., sitting at work) or close friends (e.g., leisure time activities such as playing computer games; De Cocker et al., 2016 ). Effects of dyadic or collaborative planning have been mainly evaluated using short-term follow-ups (i.e., ≤3 months; Knoll et al., 2017 ; Prestwich et al., 2012 ) and evidence for long-term effects is scarce ( Keller et al., 2020 ). Previous studies have investigated dyadic or collaborative planning for PA ( Knoll et al., 2017 ; Prestwich et al., 2012 ) but the effects of dyadic or collaborative planning on SB remain unclear. We found no previous studies of planning to reduce SB assessed using ‘objective’ measures (but see De Cocker et al., 2016 for a report of ‘objective’ assessment in a subsample).
Plans to reduce health-compromising behaviors may refer either to avoiding an undesirable habitual behavior or replacing (displacing) the undesirable behavior with an alternative health-enhancing behavior. A meta-analysis on individual planning and unhealthy eating habits has shown that planning to increase healthy eating was more effective than planning to diminish unhealthy eating patterns ( Adriaanse et al., 2011 ). Instead of planning to avoid an undesirable habitual behavior (SB), planning to engage in alternative health-enhancing behaviors (i.e., PA), may be a more promising approach ( Gardner and Rebar, 2019 ). Similarly, previous research testing effects of individual planning on SB used PA planning as the intervention strategy ( Schroé et al., 2020 ).
This randomized controlled trial investigates if, compared to SB/PA education, three types of planning (individual, dyadic, and collaborative) reduce SB time (the primary outcome). In addition, the ratios of time spent on SB to (1) time spent on LIPA, and (2) time on LIPA combined with MVPA time, were evaluated at short-term (post-intervention, 1-week) and long-term (36-week) follow-ups. Target person--partner dyads were enrolled.

Section: 2. Methods

In total, N = 320 dyads (320 target persons and 320 partners) participated at baseline (Time 0). Fig. 1 presents participant flow across measurement points.

All dyads were in a close relationship, defined as a romantic, work-related, family relationship , or a close friendship, lasting for at least one year and involving at least several meetings every week. Further inclusion criteria for dyads were: (1) target persons and partners being at least 18 years old; (2) during the initial interview at least one person in the dyad (henceforth called as target person) declared PA levels that were below the recommended threshold ( WHO, 2010 , 2020 ), that is, 150 min of MVPA per week and/or were recommended by a specialist to reduce SB and increase their PA levels due to type-2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases; (3) target persons were reporting at least moderate intention to initiate regular PA; (4) providing informed consent .
Individuals with chronic conditions were encouraged to obtain medical clearance for regular MVPA participation from their general practitioner/specialist consultant. When both dyad members did not meet recommended PA levels and/or were recommended by a specialist to reduce SB and increase their PA levels due to type-2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases, participants were asked to self-assign the roles of target persons/partners.
‘Target persons’ were defined as individuals who met the inclusion criteria and who declared that they did not adhere to PA guidelines ( WHO, 2010 , 2020 ) or were recommended to increase their PA and reduce SB due to type-2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. ‘Partners’ were the second dyad members, who were target persons' romantic partners, coworkers, family members, or friends. In other words, the term ‘partner’ denotes the dyad member other than the target person, and it is not used to represent ‘partner’ as proposed in the actor-partner interdependence model ( Kenny and Kashy, 2014 ).

This study reports results for the secondary outcome of a larger randomized controlled trial , registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03011385). The study was approved by Research Ethics Committee at the first author's institution. The trial follows the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ( Supplemental File 1 ) and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication guidelines ( Supplemental File 1 ).
Data were collected between December 2016 and February 2020 in 24 urban locations and 7 rural locations in south-western Poland. Participants were recruited via advertisements published in social media or at websites of non-governmental organizations; recruitment was also conducted in person (by experimenters) or via advertisements during health promotion events organized by the city council, at hospitals, specialist clinics, general practitioners' offices, health-related non-governmental organizations, universities, and senior clubs, etc. Potential participants were informed about the study aims, inclusion criteria, and study procedures. After familiarizing themselves with the study information materials participants were asked to provide informed consent. Measurements and intervention/control group procedures took place at the first author's university or in other locations (e.g., at participants' homes, in non-governmental organizations, senior clubs) if such preferences were indicated by participants. Experimenters were psychologists, psychology master students, nurses, or teachers ( n = 38), trained to collect data and deliver experimental procedures. There was no financial compensation for participation; participants received a thank-you gift (value 5–10 EUR) after each measurement.
After checking for the inclusion criteria and before the Time 0 (T0) measurement, dyads were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: individual planning ( n = 82), dyadic planning ( n = 83), collaborative planning ( n = 79), or the educational control condition ( n = 76). Participants, but not experimenters, were blinded to participants’ assignment to experimental groups. Randomization was conducted using random digit generator (no stratification was applied). The researcher conducting randomization was blinded to the participant enrollment and the intervention assignment. The following behavior change techniques (BCTs) were used in the three planning conditions: action planning, barrier identification, coping planning , prompting self-talk, social support/social change ( Abraham and Michie, 2018 ; Michie et al., 2011 ).
Across conditions, dyads participated in five face-to-face assessment meetings: Time 0 [T0], baseline; Time 1 [T1], 1 week after baseline; Time 2 [T2], 2 weeks after baseline; Time 3 [T3], 9 weeks after baseline; Time 4 [T4], 36 weeks after baseline. Additionally, four booster phone-calls were conducted (3 calls at 1–4 weeks after T2; 1 call at 1 week after T3). Fig. 2 presents the details of the study design.

N ote: Figure presents the study procedure which was conducted in target person-partner dyads ( N = 320). In the current analyses we included three time points T0, T1, and T4. T = Time, PA = physical activity, SB = sedentary behavior.
All dyads participated in a face-to-face education and received brochures regarding nutrition (at T0, T3), SB, and PA (at T1, T2, T3). Dyads assigned to the individual, dyadic, or collaborative planning conditions took part in respective planning interventions procedures, conducted face-to-face (at T1, T2, T3). Interventional materials (PA planning sheets) for each planning condition had a similar structure, but differed in their content. Phone-call booster sessions (3 after T2 and 1 after T3) aimed at reminding participants of the educational information across all conditions and repeating the planning procedures for participants from the three planning conditions. All participants wore accelerometers for 6 days following the T0, T1, and T4 assessments.
Before T0, potential participants completed self-reports to assess if they met the WHO guidelines regarding PA (see Supplemental File 1 ). Self-reported data were collected at T0, T1, T2, and T3. For example, demographic variables were collected at T0, intention to reduce SB was assessed at T1, self-reported plans were assessed at T2. Other self-report measures (not used in this study), applied across the assessment points, included social cognitive variables, such as PA self-efficacy, risk perception, and the use of social control strategies.
Across the experimental procedures, the term ‘target person’ denotes the member of the dyad who did not meet recommended PA levels and/or was recommended to reduce SB and increase PA due to type-2 diabetes or cardiovascular diseases. The term ‘partner’ refers to the second person in the dyad. In case both participants did not meet the respective recommendations, the dyads were asked to self-assign the roles of target persons/partners and follow the procedures of these assigned roles.
Control Condition. Nutrition, PA, and SB education were delivered to target persons and partners and included discussion of the respective WHO guidelines and a takeaway leaflet. Participants were introduced to the study website which included all information available in leaflets and key issues discussed during the face-to-face education (for details see Supplemental File 1 ). The educational component, leaflets, and the website were introduced in the same way to all participants across the study conditions. The 4 phone-call booster sessions repeated the education component.
Individual Planning Condition. After the education session at T1, dyads participated in an individual PA planning, including a formation of a detailed action plan and a detailed coping plan for the PA in the following week (7 days) ( Knäuper et al., 2018 ; Luszczynska, 2006 ; Luszczynska et al., 2007 ). Participants were instructed by the experimenters on how to form action plans (action planning), asked to identify the barriers that may prevent them from acting as planned, and also instructed on how to form coping plans (coping planning, barrier identification). Next, participants completed their planning forms (action planning). The completed forms were discussed with the experimenter who encouraged participants to use self-talk and self-instruction to reflect on whether the plans could fit into their daily schedule (prompting self-talk). Participants were also supported and praised by the experimenter for their engagement in forming detailed plans (social support/social change) fitting their daily routines (for details see Supplemental File 1 ). Weekly planning sheets were used in the intervention, in line with previous research ( Knäuper et al., 2018 ; Luszczynska, 2006 ).
Target persons and partners were asked to form PA plans for their own PA. The 4 phone-call booster sessions repeated individual planning and education.
Dyadic Planning Condition. The procedures were the same as those used in the individual planning condition except that PA plans were created by both dyad members together, with PA plans referring to PA of the target person only. Partners were instructed to support the target person in creating their PA plans. Procedures were adapted from previous research ( Keller et al., 2020 ; Knoll et al., 2017 ; Radtke et al., 2018 ; Prestwich et al., 2014 ). The 4 phone-call booster sessions included dyadic planning and education.
Collaborative Planning Condition. Target persons and partners received the intervention using very similar procedures to those employed in individual and dyadic planning conditions. In this case, however, the dyads were asked to discuss preferred types of PA that they could do together and then to create a joint plan that they could execute together in the next week. Procedures were adapted from previous research ( Prestwich et al., 2012 , 2014 ). The 4 phone-call booster sessions repeated collaborative planning and education.
Three indices of SB were computed: (1) SB time was calculated as the average minutes of SB per hour of wear time; (2) SB/LIPA proportion ( Spittaels et al., 2012 ), calculated as the average minutes of SB per hour of wear time divided by average LIPA time per hour of wear time; (3) SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion ( Hamilton et al., 2008 ; Prestwich et al., 2014 ), calculated as average minutes of SB per hour of wear time divided by average total PA time (light, moderate, vigorous, and very vigorous) per hour of wear time. Thus, all SB indices accounted for within-person adjustment for individual wear time, as the total minutes of SB (obtained across the days included in a respective measurement point) were divided by the number of hours of wear time per participant.
The three indices were assessed using accelerometers ActiGraph GT3X-BT. This method shows reasonable sensitivity and accuracy in distinguishing different types of PA and SB ( Skotte et al., 2014 ). Participants were instructed to wear accelerometers above their right hip during their waking hours (at least 14 h a day) for 6 days.
Data from each participant were identified as ‘valid wear time’ and used in the analyses only if devices had been worn for at least 8 h per day, for a minimum of 3 days during the respective assessment period ( Prescott et al., 2020 ). Data scoring methods were based on the Freedson VM3 (2011) ( Sasaki et al., 2011 ) and the Freedson Adult (1998) ( Freedson et al., 1998 ) algorithms with the Actilife software ( Sasaki et al., 2011 ). The first day of the T0 measurement was excluded. Non-wear time was calculated using epoch-based algorithm based on Choi ( Choi et al., 2011 ). To better capture SB as well as MVPA, 10-sec epochs were used ( Quante et al., 2015 ).
SB intention was measured at T1 (i.e., one week after T0, before SB-related intervention at T1) using 2 items ( Maher and Conroy, 2015 ), ‘I intend to take active breaks from sitting at least once an hour over the next week’ and ‘I intend to sit for a maximum of 5 h (in total) a day over the next week’. Responses ranged from 1 (definitely not) to 4 (definitely yes). The two items were weakly but significantly correlated in target persons: r = .21, p < .01, M = 3.11, SD = 0.68 and marginally correlated in partners: r = .11, p = .05, M = 3.11, SD = 0.68.
To conduct the manipulation check, self-reported own planning was assessed with 3 items ( Schwarzer et al., 2008 ), for example, ‘During the last week I have formed my own plans regarding when to exercise’ with Cronbach's alpha of .98 for measures applied in target persons and in partners. Self-reported collaborative planning was assessed with 3 parallel items, for example, ‘During the last week, I and my partner have formed joint plans regarding where to exercise together’ with Cronbach's alpha of .98 for target persons and .97 for partners. Response scales and descriptive statistics are reported in Supplemental File 1 .
Body height was measured with standard medically-approved telescopic height measuring rods. Body weight and percent of body fat were assessed with certified bioimpedance floor scales with a measurement error <1% (Beurer, model BF-18 and BF-530).
Sociodemographic covariates were: age; gender; education, measured as years of education; perceived economic status, measured by a question ‘Compared to the economic situation of the average family in Poland, how would you rate the economic status of your family?’ with answers ranging from ‘much below the average’ (1) to ‘much above the average’ (5); the type of relationship measured by a question ‘How would you describe the type of your relationship with your dyad partner?’ with following answers: romantic relationship , close family relationship , close friendship, work-related relationship, other (please specify). For responses on the latter item, a ‘dyad in a romantic relationship’ variable was coded with 1 = romantic relationship and 0 = other relationship.
Sample sizes were determined with G*Power calculator to secure power of .80, assuming medium-size effects of planning on the primary outcome, SB time. Assuming effect size of ς 2 = 0.25, power of .80, p = .05, and four experimental conditions the total sample should include 279 dyads. Analyses were performed in IBM SPSS 26. Missing data were accounted for with full information maximum likelihood method ( Cham et al., 2017 ). Although data for target persons' sociodemographic variables, SB intention, the type of relationship (romantic vs other), SB time, SB/LIPA proportion and SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion was missing completely at random, Little's MCAR χ 2 = 168.517 ( df = 145), p = .088, respective data for partners were not missing at random, Little's MCAR χ 2 = 204.143 ( df = 157), p = .007. Linear mixed models ( Bolger and Laurenceau, 2013 ) were used to model effects of the three planning interventions on SB indicators. To model effects over time, a linear time variable (number of weeks since T0) was created and coded as ‘0’ for baseline (T0), ‘1’ for 1-week follow-up (T1) and ‘36’ for 36-week follow-up (T4).
All of the models including long-term changes (T0-T4) were analyzed with intercept and linear time variable estimated as random effects predictors. Models including short-term changes (T0-T1) did not converge upon inclusion of the linear time variable, therefore, in this case, only intercept was modelled as a random effects predictor ( Barr et al., 2013 ). The true R 2 (the squared correlation between the actual outcome and the outcome predicted by fixed effects ; Hoffman, 2015 ) was computed to estimate the size of total effects.
The linear mixed-models were calculated to test SB changes measured from T0 to T1 as well as from T0 to T4, with the control condition as a reference group, the three planning conditions as respective dummy-coded predictors, and time × planning conditions interactions as predictors. The models were calculated for target persons and partners separately.
To assess the robustness of the findings, three sensitivity analyses were conducted (see Supplemental File 1 ). The first sensitivity analysis controlled for gender (dummy coded, 1 = male, 0 = female) and grand-mean centered age and BMI . The second sensitivity analysis included additional covariates: grand-mean centered intention to reduce SB (T1), years of schooling, the type of relationship (romantic relationship = 1 vs other relationships = 0), and perceived economic status. The third sensitivity analysis accounted for covariates included in the second sensitivity analysis and, additionally, for meeting the WHO recommendations for physical activity ( WHO, 2020 ) (meeting the guidelines = 1, not meeting the guidelines = 0), assessed in target persons and partners.
To explore whether the effects of collaborative planning differed from effects observed in other conditions, additional analyses with the collaborative planning condition as a reference group were conducted ( Supplemental File 1 ).

The dropout rates are presented in Fig. 1 . Dyads who dropped out before T4 did not differ from continuing dyads across the outcome variables and covariates (see Supplemental File 1 ), except for BMI . Participants who dropped out had a higher BMI (target persons: M = 30.17, SD = 7.49; partners: M = 27.53, SD = 6.07) compared to completers (target persons: M = 27.76, SD = 6.23, F [1, 319] = 4.44 , p = .036, η 2 = 0.01; partners: M = 25.50, SD = 4.38, F [1, 319] = 5.49 , p = .020, η 2 = 0.03).
Details of the randomization check are presented in Supplemental File 1 . Among target persons, the three planning groups significantly differed from the control group at T0 regarding SB/LIPA proportion, F (3,299) = 2.98, p = .032, η 2 = 0.03 and SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion, F (3,299) = 2.95, p = .033, η 2 = 0.03. Among partners, there were no significant between-condition differences for SB indicators at T0. There were no significant baseline between-condition differences across the majority of sociodemographic variables ( Table 1 ).
At T2 (one week after the first planning session), target persons assigned to the three planning conditions tended ( p = .063) to report that they have formed plans more often than those in the control condition, whereas partners assigned to individual or collaborative conditions reported forming own plans more often ( p = .017) than those assigned to the control or dyadic conditions. Furthermore, target persons and partners taking part at the collaborative condition reported forming collaborative plans more often at T2 ( p < .001), compared to individuals assigned to any other conditions. Concluding, target persons and partners differed in self-reported own and collaborative planning.
No unintended effects or harms due to study participation were observed.
Target Persons. Two-level models predicting SB time (average minutes per hour of wear time) between T0 (baseline) and post-intervention (T1) showed that SB in the control condition on average started at 34.50 min/h at T0 and increased by 1.02 min/h at T1 (see Table 3 , upper panel). A significant time × collaborative planning condition interaction (Estimate = −1.73; SE = 0.69; p = .013; see Table 3 , upper panel) was found, indicating that target persons in the collaborative planning condition reduced their SB from T0 to T1 (a decrease from 36.34 at T0 to 35.57 at T1; see Table 2 ) compared to the control condition (an increase from 34.45 at T0 to 35.53 at T1; see Table 2 ). The sensitivity analyses, controlling for three sets of covariates (age, gender, and BMI ; additional covariates in the second analysis: education, intention, the type of relationship, and perceived economic status; additional covariates in the third analysis: meeting PA guidelines by the target person and the partner) yielded similar findings (see Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3 in Supplemental File 1). When contrasting target persons from the collaborative planning condition with those from the 3 remaining conditions at T1, it was found that the time × condition interaction effect was significant for the comparison made between collaborative planning and control conditions, but not for individual or dyadic planning conditions (see Supplementary Table 4 , Supplemental File 1).

Among the two-level models predicting changes in SB time between T0 and T4, there were no significant effects of the time × condition interactions (see Table 3 , bottom panel).
Partners . Changes in partners’ SB time were not predicted by time × condition interactions between T0 and T1 or between T0 and T4 (see Table 3 ).
Target Persons. A significant effect of time × condition interaction for collaborative planning (Estimate = −0.26; SE = 0.11; p = .019; see Table 3 , upper panel) was found, indicating that between T0 and T1 target persons in the collaborative planning condition displaced time spent on SB by time spent on LIPA (a decrease in SB/LIPA proportion from 2.13 to 2.02; see Table 2 ), which significantly differed from the change in the control condition (an increase from 1.88 at T0 to 2.05 at T1; see Table 2 ). The sensitivity analyses, controlling for two sets of covariates (age, gender, and BMI ; additional covariates in the second analysis: education, intention, the type of relationship, and perceived economic status) yielded similar significant findings (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 in Supplemental File 1). The third sensitivity analysis, accounting for two additional covariates, meeting PA guidelines by the target person and the partner, showed a statistical trend ( p = .052) for time × condition interaction for collaborative planning (see Supplementary Table 3 in Supplemental File 1). When contrasting target persons from the collaborative planning condition with those from the 3 remaining conditions at T1, it was found that the time × condition interaction effect was significant for the comparison made between collaborative planning and control conditions, but not for individual or dyadic planning conditions (see Supplementary Table 4 in Supplemental File 1).
The findings for the two-level models testing the effects of planning on SB/LIPA proportion across the 36 weeks (T0-T4) showed no significant time × condition interactions (see Table 3 , bottom panel).
Partners. Regarding the findings for partners, SB/LIPA proportion was not predicted by time × condition interactions, neither when short term effects (T0-T1) were tested, nor when the long-term effects (T0-T4) were considered (see Table 3 ).
Target Persons. A significant effect of the time × condition interaction for collaborative planning (Estimate = −0.20; SE = 0.08; p = .018; see Table 3 , upper panel) was found, indicating that between T0 and T1 target persons in the collaborative planning condition displaced time spent on SB by time spent on LIPA or MVPA: SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion values decreased from 1.66 to 1.57 (see Table 2 ), which significantly differed from the change in the control condition (an increase from 1.46 at T0 to 1.59 at T1; see Table 2 ). Similar significant patterns of associations were obtained in sensitivity analyses, controlling for two sets of covariates (age, gender, and BMI; additional covariates in the second analysis: education, intention, the type of relationship, and perceived economic status; see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 in Supplemental File 1). The third sensitivity analysis, accounting for two additional covariates, meeting PA guidelines by the target person and the partner, showed a statistical trend ( p = .053) for time × condition interaction for collaborative planning (see Supplementary Table 3 in Supplemental File 1). When contrasting target persons from the collaborative planning condition with those from the 3 remaining conditions at T1, it was found that the time × condition interaction effect was significant for the comparison made between collaborative planning and control conditions, but not for individual or dyadic planning conditions (see Supplementary Table 4 in Supplemental File 1).
Next, the effects of three types of planning interventions on target persons’ SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion across the 36-weeks (T0-T4) were tested with linear mixed-models. No significant of time × condition interactions were found (see Table 3 , bottom panel).
Partners. The changes in partners’ SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion were not predicted by time × condition interactions, neither for T0-T1 period (see Table 3 , upper panel) nor T0-T4 period (see Table 3 , bottom panel).

Section: 4. Discussion

This study is among the first to evaluate the effects of different kinds of planning on short- and long-term changes in accelerometer-assessed sedentary behavior. We extended existing evidence by testing effects of individual, collaborative, and dyadic planning in dyads that were composed of target persons who did not meet PA guidelines and partners, including romantic partners, coworkers, family members or friend. Across all analyses conducted for three indices of SB and then repeated for various covariates, a consistent pattern of associations emerged: effects were observed only among target persons making collaborative plans, not individual or dyadic plans, and observed only at a short-term follow-up only.
The findings correspond to previous research showing no effects of individual PA planning on short-term changes in objectively measured SB ( De Cocker et al., 2016 ) or self-reported SB (unless planning was combined with other self-regulatory strategies, e.g., self-monitoring; Schroé et al., 2020 ). Previous experimental research on effects of dyadic planning yielded no significant effects on target persons' and partners’ PA ( Keller et al., 2020 ; Knoll et al., 2017 ) which, again, corresponded to our findings, indicating no influence of dyadic planning on SB indicators, including SB/PA proportion.
Collaborative planning generated beneficial short-term changes in SB time and shifts towards a healthier balance between SB time and PA time. Earlier research had shown that collaborative planning influences self-reported PA levels ( Prestwich et al., 2012 ), but, until now, there was no evidence for its effects on SB. Collaborative planning involves a social exchange in a dyad, including a joint discussion about plans and forming joint plans for joint future actions. The collaboration in dyads during the plan formation may trigger various social co-regulation processes, such as modelling, social support provision and receipt ( Lüscher et al., 2019 ; Bolger and Laurenceau, 2013 ). Moreover, such collaborative planning involves a strong and accountable commitment to someone who is important in one's social network. Joint engagement in PA has also been shown to be an important predictor of individual physical activity ( Berli et al., 2018 ). Future research could disentangle the complex social exchange and co-regulation processes which, together may make collaborative planning a more effective action-regulation strategy.
In contrast to collaborative planning, dyadic planning did not affect SB outcomes. Dyadic planning may also trigger social co-regulation processes ( Burkert et al., 2011 , 2012 ; Keller et al., 2020 ; Knoll et al., 2017 ) but it remains individual in that the plan represents future actions of just one person (i.e., the target person) rather than the joint action of a dyad. Dyadic planning has been developed in a context of post-surgery adaptation, where roles of target persons (i.e., patients) and partners were clear-cut and behavior change was recommended for patients only ( Burkert et al., 2011 , 2012 ). Further exploration of the role of the dyadic planning partner (e.g., expert versus intimate confidante) could identify what kind of planning support is most effective.
The findings indicated significant effects of collaborative planning for the target persons only. The inclusion criteria for being a target person in the present study included not meeting PA guidelines ( WHO, 2010 , 2020 ). This criterion may serve as a proxy indicator of less favorable balance between SB and PA time before entering the study. Target persons, who defined themselves as living an unbalanced life in terms of SB/PA, may have had stronger motivation to initiate a behavior change in terms of SB reduction.
It is noteworthy that no long-term effects were observed. All three planning interventions involved several repetitions of planning (face-to-face and by phone), therefore a lack of long term-effects cannot be explained merely by the limitations of the format/delivery of the intervention. The majority of planning research shows short-term effects and evidence for effects lasting >6 months is limited ( Hagger et al., 2016 ). In addition, several theoretical models indicate that SB is influenced by physical environmental cues such that interventions involving changes in the physical environment (e.g., standing desks or standing meeting rooms) may assist with maintenance of reduced SB ( Sallis and Owen, 2015 ).
The study has limitations. Triaxial hip-worn accelerometers were used to capture both SB and PA aspects, whereas more preferable devices would involve ActivePal or comparable instruments allowing for a better differentiation between sitting and standing or SB and LIPA ( Dempsey et al., 2020 ). The design accounted for a very short (1-week) and longer (36-week) follow-ups. Adding mid-term follow-ups (e.g., at 4 weeks) would allow to clarify change patterns over time after initial changes. The analyses were sufficiently powered to detect medium size effects , however, it is unlikely that very small changes could be detected. The planning referred to engaging in different forms of PA, whereas alternative approaches could focus on shortening sitting bouts or replacing sitting with standing. The randomization was not successful in terms of SB time, but all analyses were conducted controlling for the respective T0 index of SB. Although the overall dropout was low and not systematic across the majority of the study variables, participants who dropped out had higher BMI levels than those who completed the study. Therefore, BMI was controlled in sensitivity analyses. Future research should test if planning interventions are equally feasible and acceptable among people with normal and higher BMI levels, and carefully investigate the causes of dropout among participants with overweight/obesity.

Section: 5. Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial testing short-term and long-term effects of individual, dyadic, and collaborative planning showed short-term effects of collaborative planning on SB behavior of target persons, who were not meeting WHO PA guidelines (or were recommended to change their PA due to diabetes/cardiovascular diseases) prior to the study. The effects were consistent, observed across accelerometer-measured SB time, SB/LIPA proportion, and SB/LIPA + MVPA proportion. The successful initiation of behavior change (SB reduction) was not maintained at 36-week follow-up. Collaborative PA planning may be a valuable component of interventions, targeting SB change. Mechanisms underpinning the initial SB change and those behind sustainable SB reduction require further research.
