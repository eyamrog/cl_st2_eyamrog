Title: Land loss and the intergenerational transmission of wellbeing: The experience of iwi in Aotearoa New Zealand


Abstract: Abstract

We analyse the impact of land loss, through colonisation, on contemporary cultural wellbeing and health outcomes of Māori, the Indigenous population of Aotearoa New Zealand. In 1840, Māori legally owned all land in the country; by 2017, Māori owned just 5% of land. Ties to the land (whenua) have been identified as being critical to spirituality (wairua) and health (hauora). All tribes (iwi) experienced major land loss, but the timing, extent and nature of land loss differed across iwi. In some cases, land was confiscated following the New Zealand wars of the nineteenth century. We draw on recently derived data for historical landholdings of 70 (North Island) iwi to link the extent of historical landholdings, and whether land was confiscated, to contemporary outcomes for five cultural wellbeing and health outcomes for each iwi: te reo Māori (Māori language) proficiency, importance of involvement in Māori culture, visiting an ancestral marae (meeting place), difficulty in finding support for Māori cultural practices, and rates of regular smoking. We find that higher land retention within an iwi's rohe at the end of the nineteenth century is supportive of contemporary cultural wellbeing outcomes, while confiscation is linked to higher contemporary rates of smoking. The evidence is consistent with historical trauma having significant effects on the cultural wellbeing and health outcomes of Aotearoa New Zealand's Indigenous population over a century later.

Section: 1. Introduction

The Indigenous Māori population in Aotearoa New Zealand has considerably worse health outcomes than does the more numerous and politically dominant European population. Barnes and McCreanor (2019) document a persistent gap in life expectancy of around 7 years since the 1990s, with an even larger gap prior to then. One explanation for this disparity is that the country's health system is primarily designed around a Western model of health and illness. Prominent Māori scholars and health practitioners consider that Māori health is underpinned by different pillars than those which underpin the health of Europeans. Hence a single health system modelled along European lines does not result in equitable health outcomes for Māori ( Reid et al., 2017 ; Wirihana and Smith, 2014 ).
The most prominent model of Māori health, Te Whare Tapa Whā, was promulgated by Mason Durie (1985) in this journal. Its formulation followed extensive consultations with Māori elders in traditional settings. Within Te Whare Tapa Whā, Māori health is underpinned by four pillars: te taha wairua (spiritual component), te taha hinengaro (psychic/mental/emotional component), te taha tinana (bodily/physical component) and te taha whānau (family/social component). While all four pillars must be present for full health, Durie (1985, p.483) states that te taha wairua “is generally acknowledged to be the most basic and essential requirement for health”. Reflecting te ao Māori (Māori worldview), Durie states that spiritual wellbeing entails, inter alia , communion with the land: “Without access to traditional or tribal land, many Māori elders would diagnose poor health” (p.483). Given the underpinning nature of te taha wairua, poor health linked to divorce from traditional land is manifested across all four pillars. Barnes and McCreanor (2019) similarly note the importance of connections to the land for other Indigenous peoples.
Whenua (land) was a critical aspect for te ao Māori that was lost during colonisation. Through Crown purchases under pre-emption rights, land confiscation through the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, and land title individualisation and private acquisitions via the Native Land Court, Māori had most of their lands alienated from them ( Bennion et al., 2009 ; Durie, 1998 ). Māori freehold land today comprises 1.4 million hectares, approximately 5 per cent of the country's land area.
Given this foundational role for whenua, we explore the importance of land for the cultural wellbeing and health of Māori, concentrating on outcomes across iwi (tribes). Specifically, we examine current cultural wellbeing and health outcomes of iwi members in relation to colonisation experiences that resulted in differential land loss across iwi. The differential degree of land loss (while drastic for all iwi) enables us to test quantitatively the importance of Māori people's ties to the land for their ongoing cultural wellbeing and health. We also test whether cultural wellbeing outcomes differ between iwi depending on the type of alienation (confiscation versus other mechanisms) that occurred.
To investigate these issues, data on Māori land ownership, defined in this paper as the proportion of land held by iwi within their traditional iwi boundaries (rohe), are matched to data on cultural wellbeing and health outcomes for current iwi members. Reflecting the work of Durie and others, we hypothesise that contemporary cultural wellbeing and health outcomes will be positively linked to the retention of land, given the important role that whenua has in te ao Māori. Section 2 provides background on Māori cultural wellbeing and summarises relevant literature. Sections 3 Data , 4 Methodology , 5 Results present our data, methodology and results respectively, while section 6 concludes.
Our research contributes not only to the literature on health determinants of Indigenous peoples – in this case, Māori – but also to the understanding of Indigenous historic trauma. High-quality qualitative research has been conducted on these topics, but little quantitative research exists reflecting a lack of suitable quantitative data to enable such testing. The results provide insights into the importance that reconnecting whānau (family) with their whakapapa (genealogy) and whenua has for cultural wellbeing outcomes and hence for health. Within Aotearoa New Zealand, a new Māori Health Authority is currently being established, with the steering group headed by Mason Durie. The results of our research, which builds on the shoulders of Durie and others, can assist the development of policies targeted towards addressing the pillars that are critical for improving health and wellbeing outcomes for Māori.

Section: 2. Background

The history surrounding Māori land can be understood within the context of contrasting views towards land held by Māori and colonists. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, Māori land was communally owned, based on traditional Māori custom. In te ao Māori, Māori traditionally affiliate to different collective sub-groups, including whānau (extended family), hapū (subtribe) and iwi (tribe) and it was through these collectives that communal ownership was based ( Muriwai et al., 2015 ). In te ao Māori, whenua is seen as taonga (treasured possession in Māori culture) and holds significant importance in both a spiritual and economic context, with Māori considering themselves as kaitiaki (guardians) of taonga.
In contrast, European perspectives on land ownership revolved around individualism and property rights established through deeds. This perspective differs from traditional Māori beliefs, where proof of ownership is determined by occupation and use. Determining the value of land is also different within the two perspectives, with the colonial view focusing primarily on economic value rather than the cultural value that the land possesses. Understanding these differing attitudes and the cultural and spiritual importance that land has in tikanga Māori (Māori customs and practices) is crucial to understanding the impact that land loss has had on the intergenerational wellbeing of Māori.
Between 1840 and 1865, the majority of land alienated from Māori was acquired through the Crown. Article 2 of te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi, signed by iwi Māori Rangatira (Chiefs) and the British Crown, included a pre-emption clause which gave the Crown the sole right to purchase land held under customary title from Māori ( Daamen, 1998 ). Under this pre-emption clause, considerable tracts of land were alienated from Māori, including almost the entire South Island (Te Waipounamu) and Stewart Island (Rakiura), and a significant amount of the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui).
While the vast majority of Māori land alienations occurred through Crown purchases under pre-emption and the decisions made through the Native Lands Courts that followed, the most egregious treatment of Māori and their rights to land occurred through land confiscation under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and the Suppression of Rebellion Act 1863), which were passed during the peak of the New Zealand Wars. These land confiscations are known by Māori as the Raupatu.
The Acts gave the Crown powers to confiscate land from iwi who were deemed to be “engaged in rebellion” against the authority of the Crown ( Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2020a ). The Acts did not clearly define what a “rebel” was, and as a result, lands were confiscated from both “loyal” and “rebel” iwi, despite a later proclamation that the land of “loyal” iwi would not be taken, unless it was “absolutely necessary for the security of the country” ( Hickford, 2008 ). Iwi that had land confiscated under these Acts were not entitled to any compensation.
These confiscations covered extensive areas throughout the North Island totalling 1.32 million hectares (11.6% of the North Island). Thom (2020) documents that the confiscated land was disproportionately of high (economic) quality; 41% of confiscated land was suited to arable use compared with just 28% for the whole North Island. The Raupatu impacted many iwi across Waikato, Taranaki, Bay of Plenty, Tauranga and Hawke's Bay ( Durie, 1998 ). While some of this land was later returned, it was usually land considered as low quality by European settlers and in many cases was not returned to the correct owners ( Boast, 2008b ). The land returned was also not in the same title as previously. When confiscated, the land was held in customary title but the returned land held the title of freehold land, in line with colonial attitudes towards land ownership ( Bennion et al., 2009 ). This land conversion further contributed to the deterioration of Māori landholdings and Māori culture.
Given the explicitly aggressive way in which these areas of land were alienated, our analysis separately identifies land that was confiscated from Māori. We examine whether the act of confiscation helps explain contemporary outcomes separately from the effects of other forms of land loss across iwi.
In 1862, the Native Lands Act was created, which gave European settlers the ability to purchase land directly from Māori. This situation changed following the establishment of the Native Land Court, which was one of the key products of the Native Lands Act 1865 ( Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2020b ). The primary function of this legislation was to convert Māori lands from Māori customary land title to Māori freehold land title, allowing more land to be purchased by settlers for colonisation ( Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2016 ). This loss of customary land title further undermined and dismantled Māori social structures, leading to “rapid Māori land loss and consequential impoverishment” ( Boast, 2008a ).
The Native Land Court established the custom that no more than 10 owners could be named to a particular land block, regardless of its size. This action effectively dispossessed Māori individuals and iwi from land where they were not recognised as a named owner. While the legislation stated that the title of land blocks greater than 2000 ha should be entrusted to iwi, the Land Court judges avoided implementing this provision until 1867 ( Bennion et al., 2009 ). Those individuals who were recognised as named owners were legally recognised as the blocks' owners, effectively giving these individuals the ability to make decisions about the land, including sale of the land. This rule was later abolished in 1873, at which point all Māori with interests in the land became equal owners ( Whaanga, 2012 ). However, this created further issues for Māori, as this legislative change meant that the descendants of Māori landowners also became recognised as legal owners through their inheritance of the land. This was not a traditional Māori custom, but rather an attempt by the Native Land court to keep Māori freehold land individualised across generations and avoid having it reabsorbed into a group or reverted back into Māori customary land ( Kingi, 2008 ). The result has been additional fragmentation of what little land remains in Māori ownership, with shares in these land blocks being further split with each passing generation.
The accumulation of these alienations means that, as of 2013, Māori land comprised only 5 per cent (1.4 million ha) of the total area of Aotearoa New Zealand ( Kingi, 2013 ). Furthermore, complexities surround Māori land due to fragmented ownership, complex legal structures, and disproportionately high amounts of economically low-quality land.
The loss of land for Māori meant the loss not just of arable land ( Thom, 2020 ) but also loss of access to awa (rivers), ngahere (forests) and mahinga kai (food resource areas). Moreover, there was loss of critical cultural assets that contribute to many facets of te ao Māori, with these same rivers, forests and food resources considered as important taonga. It also often meant that Māori lost access to urupā (burial grounds) and pā sites (fortified villages); areas which hold considerable cultural importance and are considered as tapu (sacred).
Whenua holds special importance to Māori and has a strong relationship with wairua (spirituality) which is vital for sustaining the wellbeing of each generation ( Reid et al., 2016 ). Māori consider the whenua itself as a taonga and consider themselves as kaitiaki (guardians) of taonga. These relationships form an integral part of Māori identity. The relationship that Māori have with whenua and the importance of kaitiakitanga (guardianship over the natural environment) are aspects of tikanga Māori that are vital in understanding the social, cultural and health impacts of Māori land loss.
Māori land loss has contributed to the intergenerational degradation of Māori culture and many of the socioeconomic deficits that Māori face are related to this cultural loss ( Robson and Harris, 2007 ; Marie et al., 2008 ; Barnes and McCreanor, 2019 ). The intergenerational impoverishment inflicted by land alienation has led to a deterioration of Māori cultural identity, knowledge of whakapapa (lineage), understanding of cultural heritage, understanding of tikanga and proficiency in te reo Māori, the Māori language ( Karena, 2013 ). Te reo is particularly important. In addressing a formal enquiry into the status of the language, a prominent Māori leader, Sir James Hēnare, stated: “Ko te reo te mauri o te mana Māori” (the language is the core of our Māori culture and respect) ( Matthews, 2016 ). The intergenerational loss of language is evident to this day. In 2013, 17% of older Māori stated that they could speak te reo Māori well or very well compared to 8%–11% for younger demographics, and they were also more likely to have learned te reo Māori as their first language: 15% compared with 8% of Māori aged 15–34 ( MacPherson, 2014 ).
The centrality of whenua for cultural wellbeing underpins the choice of Māori landholdings (within iwi rohe) as a determinant of wellbeing and health outcomes of iwi in our modelling work. The importance of te reo Māori, in turn, underpins its inclusion as a key cultural wellbeing outcome in the modelling. It is supplemented by three other measures identified by Māori as indicators of cultural wellbeing ( Cram, 2014 ) and by one health measure (the smoking rate) which, as discussed below, may be indicative of a reaction to historic trauma.
The perpetuation of the impacts of land alienation and other injustices is conceptualised as historical trauma, a situation experienced by many Indigenous peoples ( Paradies, 2016 ; Walters et al., 2011 ). Historical trauma is defined as cumulative trauma through emotional and psychological wounding originating from group trauma experiences ( Brave Heart, 2003 ). The experiences are transmitted between generations with high levels of collective distress being the result ( Duran and Duran, 1995 ; Sotero, 2006 ; Bustamante et al., 2019 ). Historical trauma can also refer to trauma endured through the “systematic destruction or wilful neglect of the animals, plants, flora, fauna, soil, trees, and waterways” ( Walters et al., 2011 , p. 180).
The response to this intergenerational grief may manifest itself in a range of dysfunctional and self-destructive behaviours, such as anxiety, depression and suicide ( Brave Heart and DeBruyn, 1998 ). The enduring stress from one generation can alter the health and wellbeing outcomes of descendant generations. This is especially the case when the initial cause of the distress, such as land loss following colonisation, remains intact ( Van der Kolk, 1994 ).
The effects of the enduring nature of the source of distress is emphasised by post-development theorists (e.g. Pieterse, 2000 ; Rapley, 2004 ; Reid et al., 2014 ). Gagné (1998) emphasises that historic trauma is not only a result of a historic trauma event, but that it is perpetuated across generations by the structures enforced by the dominant system. Sotero (2006, p. 99) considers that the primary aspect of trauma resulting from colonisation is a result of the “subjugation of a population by a dominant group” requiring four elements: “overwhelming physical and psychological violence, segregation and/or displacement, economic deprivation, and cultural dispossession”. All four of these elements occurred in Aotearoa New Zealand ( Barnes and McCreanor, 2019 ; Wirihana and Smith, 2014 ). The loss of land for Māori meant the loss of economic independence, culture and spiritual connection and political power. Assimilative policies restricted Māori ability to develop and participate fully in their own culture, reducing opportunities to thrive within te ao Māori ( Moeke-Pickering, 1996 ; Pihama et al., 2014 ).
Prior research has addressed the role of culture as a means of combating trauma, with Muriwai et al. (2015) finding that high levels of cultural efficacy offer protective effects against negative psychological outcomes and other related risk factors for Māori. Thus, the revival of Indigenous culture offers recuperative functions which can strengthen resilience ( Denham, 2008 ).
Recent work has begun to build a base of quantitative research connecting historic trauma with health-related measures, such as mental health ( Guenzel and Struwe, 2020 ) and smoking ( Soto et al., 2015 ). This literature is relatively new. There is little quantitative research examining the relationship that historic trauma has with contemporary cultural wellbeing and health outcomes; the paucity of quantitative studies is particularly evident with respect to Māori experience of colonisation and land loss. Furthermore, much historical trauma research focuses on the responses to historical trauma at an individual level, foregoing one of the main strengths of the theory in that it places historical contextualisation to these events of trauma ( Reid et al., 2014 ; Fast and Collin-Vézina, 2010 ). Because many of the disparities that exist today between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities are the result of actions that targeted and affected entire communities of people, research that interprets these issues from a collective perspective may offer greater insights beyond what may be identified at the individual level.
The current paper contributes to the historic trauma literature by quantifying the relationship between the loss of whenua and four measures of cultural wellbeing and one measure of health. While the trauma event of the loss of Māori land is something common amongst all iwi, the amount of land loss, the periods in which it was lost, and how it was lost, differ between iwi. As a result, some iwi have suffered a greater number of traumatic events; hence experiences resulting from historic trauma may have differed. We leverage the different experiences of land loss across iwi. Previous literature has recommended that future research expand historical trauma theory in this way, by attempting to measure historical trauma events and investigating their “intensity, duration and time period of exposure for particular tribal populations” ( Krieger, 1999 , p. 310). Our analysis focuses on identifying the collective responses of iwi in terms of their cultural wellbeing and physical wellbeing (health) to a historical trauma event, land loss, measured both by the amount of land alienated and by the method through which the land was alienated. Where past research has examined the different outcomes between different ethnicities, this research analyses outcomes within an ethnicity, examining the diverse iwi experiences of land loss and the corresponding impacts on cultural and health outcomes.
Universal perspectives of wellbeing are premised on the notion that all people have common definitions of wellbeing and that their wellbeing can be measured in similar ways ( Duran, 2006 ; Cram, 2014 ). However, this approach ignores cultural considerations and socioeconomic context which marginalises and disempowers Indigenous minorities. Indigenous wellbeing can be defined broadly as a “simultaneously collective and individual intergenerational continuum” that is intertemporal, existing in the past, present and future ( Walker et al., 2013 , p. 208). Culture forms an integral part of wellbeing for Indigenous peoples. Connection to one's culture provides a protective factor, buffering against adversity and risk-taking, so contributing to physical and emotional wellbeing ( Fast and Collin-Vézina, 2010 ). For Māori, Muriwai et al. (2015, p. 14) find that “access to, awareness of and engagement in Māori cultural traditions (e.g. Tikanga Māori, Te Reo Māori, Whanaungatanga)" form a protective function against many negative outcomes that Māori face.
Land facilitates functions that are fundamental to many aspects of wellbeing ( Rao, 2018 ). The relationship that indigenous people share with the land is profound in many cultures, with this strong sense of unity with the environment being perhaps the most defining aspect of indigeneity ( Durie, 2004 ). Accordingly, the loss of land is considered to have had a detrimental impact on the cultural and spiritual wellbeing of Māori. It has separated and destabilised whānau, hapū and iwi and the place-based identities central to these rōpū (groups), interrupting the transmission of cultural knowledge.

Section: 3. Data

We use iwi affiliation data derived from 132 individual iwi and 180 total iwi categories from the 2013 New Zealand census ( Statistics New Zealand, n.d. ). We use the 2013 census as a data source both to provide consistency with our wellbeing measures which were surveyed in 2013, and to avoid under-coverage problems in the 2018 census which especially affected Māori. In modern censuses, an individual can list multiple iwi, so data on iwi affiliation (which we use for weighted estimates presented in the Appendix) exceed the total population of Māori. As detailed in Thom (2020) , the data for some iwi have been aggregated (based on iwi lineage and association) to create a dataset of 103 iwi groupings, together with their respective rohe (tribal areas). When referring to iwi in the analysis of this paper, we are referring to these groupings. We focus solely on North Island iwi as most iwi rohe are in the North Island; and the South Island experience and timing of land loss was quite different to that in the North Island.
Māori land in this study refers to the legal definition of the status of land that is provided by section 129 of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993), being land that holds the status of either Māori customary land or Māori freehold land. The construction, properties and sources of the geospatial data for Māori landholdings in various years (1840, 1864, 1880, 1890, 1910, 1939 and 2017) are detailed in Thom (2020) which includes maps of Māori land at each of these dates. Note that 1864 could be represented as being (late) 1864 or (early) 1865, but 1864 is used to emphasise that this snapshot of Māori landholdings was prior to the land confiscations that occurred under the New Zealand Settlements Act. Both the Māori landholdings data and the confiscations data are linked with the iwi rohe geospatial data representing “iwi land” in each of the study years. For indicative maps of individual iwi rohe (not using the iwi groupings of the current analysis), see Te Puni Kōkiri (n.d.) .
As detailed in Appendix Table A1 , Table A3 , we use data for four Māori cultural wellbeing measures plus one Māori health measure ( Statistics New Zealand, 2018 ). The cultural wellbeing data were gathered through the Stats NZ 2013 Te Kupenga sample survey of 5548 Māori and include iwi-level estimates for each of: (1) Te reo Māori (language) proficiency; (2) Ease of getting help with Māori cultural practices; (3) Importance of involvement in Māori culture ; and (4) Visited ancestral marae in the last 12 months. A marae is a traditional Māori meeting ground belonging to an iwi, hapū or whānau, normally including a wharenui (carved meeting house), open space and other facilities. These four measures provide quantitative data on key factors that contribute to Māori cultural wellbeing: te reo Māori (language), wairuatanga (spirituality), tikanga (customs), and whanaungatanga (social connectedness). The responses for these measures are reported as percentages of iwi members. Since this data is from 2013, not all iwi outlined within the iwi codes from the 2018 census have cultural wellbeing data associated with them. Only the 89 iwi included in Te Kupenga 2013 are captured; of these, we use data for 70 of the iwi groupings, with each of these pertaining to iwi within the North Island. In addition, reflecting the work of Soto et al. (2015) in relation to smoking and historic trauma, we use data for the proportion of each North Island iwi grouping reported as being regular smokers in the 2013 census.
The five cultural wellbeing and health variables are presented in Table 1 , together with response categories and the proportions responding in each category. At the aggregate level, as shown in Table 1 , the various cultural wellbeing measures indicate different degrees of cultural wellbeing. For instance, 57% find it (quite/very) important to be involved in Māori culture. By contrast, only 15% of respondents speak te reo well or very well. Table 1 . Cultural wellbeing and health measures: Summary statistics. Variable Response categories % Te reo Māori Proficiency No more than a few words or phrases 36.7 Not very well 32.4 Fairly well 15.6 Very well/well 15.3 Ease of getting support with Māori cultural practices Hard/very hard 10.4 Sometimes easy/sometimes hard 15.4 Easy 31.2 Very easy 38.0 Don't need help 4.9 Importance of involvement in Māori culture Not at all important 6.4 A little important 13.8 Somewhat important 22.5 Quite important 24.5 Very important 32.6 Visited ancestral marae in past 12 months Yes 46.3 No 53.7 Regular smoker Yes 28.8 No 71.2
The distribution across iwi groupings (inclusive of South Island iwi) for each question plus the distribution of Māori landholdings in 2017 is presented in Table 2 . Three-quarters of these iwi groupings today hold less than 12.5% of their rohe as Māori land, and a quarter hold less than 2.7%. The range for te reo proficiency shows that high proficiency (Speaks Very well/Well) varies from 5.7% to 29.1% indicating material differences in te reo competence across iwi. The smoking rate (proportion of regular smokers) covers a range from 17.5% to 42.3%, again indicating material differences in outcomes. Table 2 . Distribution across iwi groupings of Māori land ownership, cultural wellbeing and health measures.

Section: 4. Methodology

Our aim is to establish whether the alienation and confiscation of Māori land and the differing experiences iwi had with land loss are associated with four contemporary wellbeing outcomes and one contemporary health outcome across iwi. As discussed in related literature, the loss of Māori land was a historic trauma event affecting all iwi; this loss of land can therefore be considered as an indirect proxy measuring the historic trauma experienced by iwi Māori. Given the importance of te reo for Māori cultural wellbeing, we place considerable emphasis on the relationship of this variable with the experiences of land loss. Our data do not enable us to identify a direct causal association although, following Soto et al. (2015) , the smoking rate may be indicative of an historic trauma channel.
In our modelling, we consider each iwi (i.e. the collective rather than individuals) to be the unit of analysis. For that reason, the estimates that we present in the main text are unweighted (i.e. do not use population weights). For comparison purposes, we include population-weighted estimates in the Appendix; to ensure a consistent sample of iwi across both methods, we drop any iwi without population data.
Our primary analysis regresses each of the cultural wellbeing and health measures on a confiscation dummy variable and on Māori land ownership in different years. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) with robust standard errors reported. A separate regression is estimated corresponding to the land variable for each historical period as follows: (1) w e l l b e i n g i x = γ 0 + γ 1 c o n f i s c a t i o n i + γ 2 l a n d i t + e i where w e l l b e i n g i x is the current cultural wellbeing or health measure of interest, x , of iwi i ; c o n f i s c a t i o n i is a dummy variable for whether iwi i suffered confiscation under the Raupatu; l a n d i t is the proportion of rohe retained as Māori land by iwi i as at year t ; and e i is the residual.
Each of the dependent (cultural wellbeing or health) variables is expressed as the proportion of iwi responses for one or more aggregated categories. For instance, the dependent variable for te reo proficiency is the proportion of respondents within an iwi who speak the language well or very well.
We perform two robustness checks on our primary analysis. First, we estimate population-weighted OLS estimates of equation (1) . Second, we estimate ordered logit regressions for two measures, Te reo Māori proficiency and Importance of involvement in Māori culture , which have ordered response categories. To estimate the ordered logit regression, a generated dataset containing ordinal data for each of the two cultural wellbeing measures was created. This dataset reflects the percentage of each response for the variable for each iwi, represented as the number of responses for that category out of 100, with each percentage response rounded to the nearest whole number; hence we report 7000 observations (70 iwi each with 100 observations) for these estimates. The ordered logit regressions have standard errors clustered by the 2013 iwi affiliation. An assumption of the ordered logit model is that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same: i.e. the parallel regression assumption ( Fullerton, 2009 ). To test this assumption, we performed a likelihood-ratio test and a Brant test, neither of which rejected the parallel regression assumption. Results of each of these robustness checks are presented in the Appendix.

Section: 5. Results

Table 3 presents our core results. Each panel presents estimation results for a separate wellbeing variable, while each column displays results of a separate regression for that wellbeing variable where the land variable represents the percentage of rohe retained as Māori land in the year that heads the column.

The results for the four cultural wellbeing variables show a consistent pattern. In each case, landholdings are a significant predictor of current cultural wellbeing outcomes, and it is landholdings around the end of the nineteenth century (1890 or 1910) that have the greatest explanatory power. Iwi that retained a greater proportion of their land at that time now have higher rates of te reo proficiency, place greater importance on involvement in Māori culture and are more likely to have visited an ancestral marae over the previous year; they are less likely to find it hard getting support with Māori cultural practices. Thus, greater retention of land has – over a century later – assisted those iwi in the retention of their cultural roots.
In 1910, the lower and upper quartiles of landholdings for our estimation sample (covering North Island iwi groupings) were 6.0% and 30.7% respectively. The effect of moving from the lower to the upper quartile of land retention in 1910 is estimated to be an extra 1.6 percentage points (p.p.) of that iwi grouping being able to speak te reo proficiently (well/very well) today. The same change in landholdings is estimated to have led to an increase in the current proportion of iwi members who find it important to be involved in Māori culture of 1.8 p. p., and an increase in the proportion who have visited a marae of 2.8 p. p.; the proportion who finds it difficult to find support for Māori cultural practices is estimated to decline by 0.6 p. p.
Land retention is estimated to have had no significant effect on smoking rates across iwi, but experience of confiscation does. An iwi that was subject to land confiscation during the Raupatu is estimated to have a smoking rate that is 2.6 p. p. higher than in an iwi for whom confiscation did not occur. This gap is almost equal to the difference between the median and upper quartile rates of smoking across iwi. The higher smoking rate associated with historical confiscation is consistent with the lingering effects of historical trauma resulting from the Raupatu.
Table A2 in the Appendix presents the population-weighted OLS estimates corresponding to Table 3 . We again find a significant association between land retention and te reo proficiency and being able to find support for Māori cultural practices. The emphasis switches to confiscation for each of the other two cultural wellbeing variables. A positive relationship remains between smoking and confiscation although the effect is no longer statistically significant.
Table A3 presents the ordered logit results for the two outcomes that have ordered responses. Landholdings again show a significant positive relationship with te reo proficiency, although more recent indicators of land retention (1939 and 2017) now have the stronger relationships. The ordered logit results for importance of involvement in Māori culture emphasise confiscation as a driver of contemporary outcomes.
The results presented in Table 3 and the Appendix support a positive association between historical land retention and te reo proficiency. The 1.6 p. p. increase in te reo proficiency that is associated with a move from lower to upper quartile 1910 landholdings represents 10.5% of the proportion of Māori who report speaking te reo well or very well. The effects of the same change in landholdings on the other three wellbeing indicators range from 3.2% to 6.0% of the relevant cultural wellbeing category. The 2.6 p. p. increase in the smoking rate for an iwi that suffered the Raupatu represents 9.0% of the Māori smoking rate. Thus while other factors clearly influence cultural wellbeing and health outcomes, these quantitative findings are consistent with the qualitative analysis of Durie (1985) that identified ties to the land as being crucial influences on Māori wellbeing today.

Section: 6. Discussion

The results in section 5 indicate that wellbeing and health impacts caused by Māori land loss persist to this day. Iwi who experienced greater land alienations have suffered a greater intergenerational loss in te reo Māori knowledge and proficiency. The other cultural wellbeing and health outcomes also reflect the land alienations, illustrating the importance that whenua has in te ao Māori and hauora ( Barnes and McCreanor, 2019 ). The loss of land interrupted the intergenerational transmission of mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledge) and te reo Māori, so impacting interpersonal and environmental relationships in Māori communities ( Wakefield et al., 2006 ; Wirihana, 2012 ; Wirihana and Smith, 2014 ). Those iwi who endured significant land loss early in the colonisation period may have experienced this interruption to the intergenerational transmission of knowledge sooner, resulting in a greater deterioration of te reo Māori proficiency and other indicators of cultural wellbeing.
Iwi that experienced a greater proportional loss of land and those who experienced confiscation may have been more likely to move away from their rohe and into westernised urban areas, so experiencing physical disconnection from their whenua, hapū and iwi and spiritual disconnection from tikanga Māori and te ao Māori within their daily lives. For those iwi who avoided urbanisation and remained living in their rohe, the historic trauma caused by land loss, in particular that taken through confiscation, may have been exacerbated by the fact that they remained living near where the historic trauma event of land loss occurred, thereby experiencing constant reminders of this trauma ( Walters et al., 2011 ).
Collective memories held by Indigenous peoples may nevertheless serve an important function in strengthening collective identity and providing narratives of resilience that can be passed down from one generation to the next ( Walters et al., 2011 ). Thus, historic trauma events and historic trauma responses are by no means mutually exclusive. The threats to Māori identity and cultural wellbeing perpetuated by land alienation have, in some ways, acted as a channel to support Māori identity and cultural wellbeing through these acts of resilience ( Moeke-Pickering, 1996 ). Acknowledging and validating the existence of historic trauma is therefore important in the healing process ( Wirihana and Smith, 2014 ).
The role that collective memories and the intergenerational transfer of cultural knowledge have as a potential historical trauma response illustrates the importance of education in this cultural knowledge and how it can support Māori healing from historical trauma ( Denham, 2008 ). For instance, the action of visiting one's ancestral marae can be seen as a form of cultural healing, with one's marae being a means to facilitate social interaction and strengthen cultural and spiritual connections with whenua and among whānau, hapū and iwi. Perhaps the ultimate way in which aspects of tikanga Māori are facilitated is through tangihanga (traditional Māori funeral, rites for the dead), a spiritual and cultural experience in which many aspects of tikanga Māori are practised and in which many distant whānau attend to show their respect and honour those who have passed. It is one of the most powerful forms of cultural expression through which tikanga Māori has been maintained over generations ( Durie and Hermansson, 1990 ; Nikora et al., 2010 ).
The alienation of Māori land isolated many iwi from their ancestral origins and tribal organisations, affecting Māori individual and collective identity, which stems from the land ( Moeke-Pickering, 1996 ). Since 1989, binding settlements have occurred between the Crown and individual iwi designed to address historic injustices. In addition to formal apologies for the injustices plus some financial recompense, settlements have incorporated a (partial) return of lands including urupā and other sacred sites to iwi ( Orange, 2021 ). These settlements acknowledge the importance of whenua for Māori wellbeing. In addition, health services designed to address poor wellbeing outcomes for Māori are being overhauled (e.g. through the new Māori Health Authority). These services need to embody not only culturally appropriate values but also need to provide trauma-informed community and health services to facilitate healing from historic injustices.
Our work sets the scene for several potential quantitative research extensions (in addition to research based on Kaupapa Māori methodologies). For instance, research could shed light on the impact of land loss on iwi population and migration flows – and on wellbeing outcomes for those tangata whenua Māori who reside in their rohe relative to those who do not. In addition, the impact of historical land loss on contemporary economic outcomes for iwi members, and for Māori economic development more generally, is a natural extension of the approach taken here. A further extension is to examine the impact that Treaty settlements have had for iwi Māori in recovering from the impacts of land loss.
Our work has demonstrated that historical context is important for explaining contemporary outcomes for Māori. The research indicates the importance of reconnecting people with their whenua and rohe, and the central role that they have in improving the wellbeing outcomes of iwi. The process of individuals reconnecting with their rohe is a form of active healing, in which they are strengthening and expressing culture, rebuilding relationships and addressing trauma and grief. Incorporating these insights into future policy development ( Trickett et al., 2011 ) will enable interventions to be developed that benefit from insights that are relevant both at a cultural and a community level.
