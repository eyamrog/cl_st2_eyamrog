Title: Geospatial analysis of associations among mental health need, housing need, and involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County


Abstract: Abstract

The purpose of this study was to use geospatial indicators of mental health need and homelessness in Los Angeles County Service Planning Areas (SPAs) and a psychiatric sample of adults who were homeless to investigate 1) overlap between SPA level of mental health need and corresponding volume of involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations over time; 2) overlap between SPA level of unsheltered homelessness and corresponding volume of involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations over time; and 3) associations between SPA level of mental health need, SPA level of unsheltered homelessness, and initiation of a mental health conservatorship for grave disability. A sample of 373 adults who were homeless and hospitalized on an involuntary psychiatric hold from 2016 to 2018 were linked to data from the Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count on unsheltered homelessness and from the California Health Interview Survey on need for mental health services and suicidality, using admission zip codes to link variables at the SPA level. Geospatial mapping and bivariate tests were used to examine geographic overlap of SPA mental health need and unsheltered homelessness with volume of involuntary psychiatric admissions over the study period. Multiple logistic regression modeling was used to examine associations of SPA mental health need and unsheltered homelessness with conservatorship initiation. The volume of patients admitted from SPAs with higher levels of mental illness need grew from 2016 to 2018 (Tau = 0.27, P < 0.001; Tau = 0.40, P < 0.001), but there were fewer patients admitted from SPAs with higher levels of unsheltered homelessness over the same years (Tau of −0.33, P < 0.001). Being admitted from SPAs with the highest levels of unsheltered homelessness was associated with higher odds of conservatorship initiation (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.82–16.74). Results suggest a need for targeted mental health and housing services to reach areas of highest need in Los Angeles County.

Section: 1. Introduction

Serious mental illness (SMI) is disproportionately prevalent among people experiencing homelessness. According to estimates from Los Angeles County, 25% of adults who are homeless have SMI, compared to only 4.6% of adults in the general United States (US) population (Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority [ National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2021 ). SMI can refer to any mental or behavioral disorder that severely impairs function in work, school, relationships, health, or other areas of life, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder ( National Institute of Mental Health, 2020 ). The higher prevalence of SMI among people experiencing homelessness is associated with higher rates of suicidality, substance use disorder, disability, and premature mortality ( Desai et al., 2003 ; Doran et al., 2018 ; Nishio et al., 2017 ; Martens, 2001 ). Disparities in morbidity, disability, mental illness, and mortality among people experiencing homelessness highlight the need for improved services for people living at the intersection of homelessness and mental illness.
There are also regional disparities in homelessness that have implications for mental health service planning. In the general US adult population, an estimated 18 out of 10,000 people were experiencing homelessness in 2020, but this rate was nearly four times higher in Los Angeles County, California ( LAHSA, 2020 ). High levels of homelessness in Los Angeles are driven in part by unaffordable housing, stagnant income growth, insufficient tenant protections, and insufficient investment in mental health services relative to population size ( LAHSA, 2020 ). According to the 2020 LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, an estimated 66 out of 10,000 people living in Los Angeles County were experiencing homelessness in 2020 ( LAHSA, 2020 ). Seventy-two percent of this population was experiencing unsheltered homelessness, which is associated with a greater decline in physical and mental health conditions and increased risk for violence compared to people experiencing sheltered homelessness ( LAHSA, 2020 ; Petrovich et al., 2020; Rountree et al., 2019 ). Unsheltered homelessness is defined as an individual or family that has a primary nighttime dwelling that is either public or private and not meant for regular human habitation, including on the street or in tents, cars, or other similar settings ( US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2008 ) . Sheltered homelessness, on the other hand, refers to residing in a supervised public or private shelter that is meant for temporary habitation ( US Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2008 ).
Despite high levels of need for both housing and mental health care in Los Angeles County, there are multiple barriers to providing services to people living at the intersection of homelessness and SMI in the region. First, there is a shortage of psychiatric hospitals and beds available to treat individuals with SMI both in Los Angeles County and in the State of California. Approximately 25% of California's psychiatric facilities have closed since 1995, resulting in a corresponding 42% reduction in available psychiatric beds when combined with population growth in the same time period ( California Hospital Association, 2018 ). Although 50 psychiatric beds per 100,000 population is the recommended minimum in the US, California only has 17 beds per 100,000 population ( California Hospital Association, 2018 ). There are similar declines in supportive residential facilities for adults with mental illness or disabilities ( Wiener, 2019 ). From 2016 to 2019, 45 board and care facilities and 1226 mental health beds were closed in Los Angeles County ( Steinberg Institute, 2020 ). Given these mental health service declines, people with SMI who are homeless often fall into a pervasive cycle of movement between emergency rooms, short-term involuntary psychiatric holds, jails, temporary shelters , and the streets without resolution of long-term mental health or housing needs ( Compton et al., 2016 ). Often, people with SMI who are homeless only make contact with safety net service systems when they are experiencing a visible, acute psychiatric crisis in the community (e.g., psychosis , suicidality) that brings them to the attention of emergency response personnel and results in an involuntary psychiatric hold ( Trivedi et al., 2019 ). This cycle of failed, short-term service encounters also contributes to the unhoused community's mistrust of service providers and safety net systems of care, where there is a long history of stigmatization, mistreatment, and misunderstanding of people with SMI who are experiencing homelessness ( Kryda and Compton, 2009 ; Odoh et al., 2020 ).
Targeted services are needed to reach the areas of greatest homelessness and mental illness need in Los Angeles County and other similar counties and cities with high levels of homelessness; however, the sheer size of Los Angeles County—the most populous in the US with over 10 million people—and transience of this population can inhibit effective service planning ( Ferguson et al., 2016 ). Each year, the LAHSA conducts the Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count in Los Angeles County, which is a point-in-time estimate of homelessness and its characteristics like unsheltered or sheltered homelessness, age, and geographic location ( LAHSA, 2020 ). The LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count presents a unique opportunity to identify localized areas of unsheltered homelessness within Los Angeles County where there may be high levels of untreated SMI. Although the LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count does not assess mental health factors or history of involuntary psychiatric holds, other sources of survey and clinical data from Los Angeles County can feasibly be linked to LAHSA data to understand relationships among homelessness, mental health need, and involuntary psychiatric holds within Los Angeles County.
This study leveraged geospatial data on mental health need and unsheltered homelessness in Los Angeles County Service Planning Areas (SPAs) and data from a sample of adults experiencing homelessness who were involuntarily hospitalized for a psychiatric emergency . The purpose of the study was to investigate 1) overlap between SPA level of mental health need and corresponding volume of involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations over time; 2) overlap between SPA level of unsheltered homelessness and corresponding volume of involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations over time; and 3) associations between SPA level of mental health need, SPA level of unsheltered homelessness, and initiation of a mental health conservatorship for grave disability. Although SPAs are only a rough approximation of geographic differences in Los Angeles County and more granular differences exist within SPAs, SPAs are an ideal unit for geospatial analysis in Los Angeles County because they are used to organize the delivery of health, housing, and other social services. Identifying areas of Los Angeles County with the highest level of homelessness and mental health need could allow for development of targeted mental health and housing services (e.g., street-based psychiatric outreach, community health worker programs, prioritization of supportive housing developments) and more effective use of mental health resources ( Choi et al., 2021 ; Robles et al., 2019 ).

Section: 2. Methods

This observational study linked data from three sources from 2016 to 2018: (1) data on involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations of individuals who were homeless from a not-for-profit, psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles County; (2) data on unsheltered homelessness in Los Angeles County from the LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count; and (3) data on mental illness need in Los Angeles County from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS).
Los Angeles County is divided into eight SPAs that are used to organize delivery of safety net health, housing, and social services ( Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 2017 ). The three data sources described above were linked at the level of SPAs, the most granular geographic unit available in all three data sources. We examined unsheltered homelessness (LAHSA) and mental illness need (CHIS) at the level of SPAs and linked these data to patients using their admission SPA. This project was approved by the [blinded for review] and the Research Committee at [blinded for review].
Data on Involuntary Psychiatric Hospitalizations of Individuals Experiencing Homelessness . We used administrative data from a safety net psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles to examine a sample of adults experiencing homelessness who were hospitalized on an involuntary psychiatric hold between 2016 and 2018. The 28-bed hospital, which primarily cares for uninsured adults, was selected for the current study because it is one of very few psychiatric hospitals in Los Angeles County that has a large patient population of individuals experiencing homelessness (approximately 50% of adult patients are homeless at the time of admission) and that receives patients from all eight Los Angeles County SPAs ( Choi et al., 2021 ).
Data on Unsheltered Homelessness in Los Angeles . Publicly available data was accessed from the LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count from 2016 to 2018. LAHSA conducts a count of people experiencing homelessness in January each year to provide a point-in-time estimate of homelessness in Los Angeles County, including population size , SPA and city council district location, and demographics, including unsheltered/sheltered status ( LAHSA, 2018a ). We used LAHSA data on percentages of unsheltered homelessness in Los Angeles County SPAs for each study year.
Data on Mental Illness Need in Los Angeles . Data from CHIS were used to characterize level of mental health need by SPA in Los Angeles County during the study period ( California Health Interview Survey, 2012 ). CHIS continuously surveys California residents via web and phone to assess the health status and healthcare needs of the state population ( California Health Interview Survey, 2012 ). We used CHIS data on percentages of individuals reporting unmet need for mental health services and suicidal ideation in each Los Angeles County SPA for each study year ( California Health Interview Survey, 2012 ).
According to hospital administrative records, there were 849 adult patients (≥18 years) admitted on an involuntary psychiatric hold from January 2016 to December 2018. Individuals who were not experiencing homelessness at the time of admission, who were already conserved, or who were hospitalized for forensic reasons were omitted from the sample (N = 444). Individuals with no recorded SPA admission location or those admitted from outside of Los Angeles County were also omitted from the sample (N = 32), yielding an analytic N of 373 adults who were homeless at the time of the involuntary psychiatric hold and subsequent admission to the facility.
Outcome Variable . To assess mental illness severity from hospital administrative records, we examined whether a mental health conservatorship was initiated during hospitalization. Mental health conservatorships are reserved for individuals experiencing grave disability from SMI. The criteria for conservatorship and the progression of involuntary commitments were established by the State of California's Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) Act of 1967 ( The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, 1967 ). According to the LPS Act, an individual is initially placed on a 5150 (72-h involuntary hold). After 72-h, if the person continues to meet LPS criteria for grave disability, danger to self, or danger to others, a 14-day hold is initiated. A longer hold of 30 days can be initiated if the individual continues to meet grave disability criteria. After the completion of a 30-day hold, the patient becomes eligible for initiation of a temporary conservatorship if grave disability criteria continue to be met and, subsequently, a full one-year conservatorship ( The Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, 1967 ). Since conservatorship is reserved only for individuals with severe, ongoing disability from mental illness that cannot be resolved by any other means, temporary conservatorship initiation was used as an indicator of mental illness severity.
Exposure Variables . Exposure variables were patient demographics, SPA level of unsheltered homelessness, and SPA mental health need.
Patient demographics . Hospital administrative data were used to identify each patient's admission SPA for data linkage. Homelessness status on admission was identified per patient report from admission notes, which is systematically assessed during all admissions at the facility. We also examined age, gender, admitting facility type (psychiatric urgent care , safety net hospital, or walk-in patient under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act), admission year (2016, 2017, 2018), length of stay, and psychiatric hold type at discharge (72-h hold, 14-day hold, 30-day hold, or conservatorship initiated) from administrative records as control variables.
SPA mental health need . Mental health need was measured using CHIS data based on the “Needed help for emotional/mental health problems or use of alcohol/drug” section of the survey. Suicidality was based on the “Ever seriously thought about committing suicide” section of the survey ( California Health Interview Survey, 2012 ). We ranked SPAs into quartiles to identify regions with the greatest levels of mental illness need for each CHIS variable in each study year. The 1st quartile represented SPAs with the lowest level of the mental illness need while the 4th quartile represented SPAs with the highest levels of mental illness need. As there are eight SPAs in total in Los Angeles County, each quartile contained two SPAs.
SPA level of unsheltered homelessness . The percentage of unsheltered homelessness by SPA was calculated for each study year from LAHSA data. Then, we ranked SPAs into quartiles by study year to identify regions with the greatest levels of unsheltered homelessness. The 1st quartile represented SPAs with the lowest levels of unsheltered homelessness while the 4th quartile represented SPAs with the highest levels of unsheltered homelessness.
SPA-level indicators of mental illness need and unsheltered homelessness were linked to patients using their admission SPA, resulting in a tabular dataset with all variables (suicidality, unmet mental health need, unsheltered homelessness, volume of involuntary psychiatric admissions) linked at the level of SPA to individual patients for analysis. Analyses were conducted in R, version 4.0.3 and ArcGIS Hub Version 2.19 ( Esri, 2021 ; The R Foundation, 2021 ).
Aim 1 . We used bivariate tests to examine the relationship between mental health need indicators (suicidality, unmet mental health need) and involuntary psychiatric admission volume over the study period. Kendall's Rank Correlation Tests were performed to determine the magnitude and direction of correlation between patient admissions by need quartiles and study years.
Aim 2 . The above analysis (Kendall's rank correlation test) was repeated using unsheltered homelessness to examine differences in psychiatric admission volume over the three study years. To visualize the extent to which involuntary psychiatric admissions of individuals who were homeless corresponded to SPAs with the greatest levels of unsheltered homelessness, ArcGIS Hub Version 2.19 was used to create geospatial maps ( Esri, 2021 ). A separate map was generated for each study year (2016, 2017, 2018). The base layer was a map of Los Angeles County divided into its eight SPAs ( Los Angeles County Internal Services Department, 2022 ). We used a bivariate choropleth map layer to visualize SPA unsheltered homelessness quartiles, with darker red representing higher levels of unsheltered homelessness and darker blue representing volume of involuntary psychiatric admissions of individuals who were homeless from each SPA. With this color scheme, maps with areas of purple thus represented greater overlap between unsheltered homelessness and volume of involuntary psychiatric admissions, while maps more distinct red and blue coloring represented less overlap.
Aim 3 . We examined relationships between geospatial need indicators and whether or not a mental health conservatorship for grave disability was initiated during hospitalization. We used multiple logistic regression models to estimate the odds of conservatorship initiation from level of suicidality, unmet mental health need, and unsheltered homelessness in the patient's admitting SPA in three separate models. All models were adjusted for patient gender (male or female), patient age (years), and admission year (2016, 2017, or 2018).

Section: 3. Results

The number of individuals admitted on an involuntary psychiatric hold who were homeless increased slightly from 2016 to 2018 (N = 116 in 2016; N = 121 in 2017; N = 136 in 2018) ( Table 1 ). Of the 373 patients admitted across the study period, the majority were male (N = 299, 80.2%), and the average age was 34.5 years (standard deviation [SD] = 10.4 years). Patients were primarily admitted from a psychiatric urgent care (N = 164, 44.0%) or a safety net hospital emergency room within Los Angeles County (N = 194, 52.0%). Patients had a median length of stay of 17 days (range: 0–483 days) with a mean of 42.1 days (SD = 67.8 days). The most common psychiatric hold type at discharge was a 14-day hold (N = 171, 45.8%), followed by a 30-day hold (N = 114, 30.6%). There were 72 patients (19.3%) for whom a mental health conservatorship was initiated. Table 1 .

Aim 1: Overlap Between SPA Mental Illness Need and Involuntary Psychiatric Admission of Individuals who were Homeless.
When considering unmet need for mental health services in SPAs, an increasing number of patients were admitted from higher-need SPAs over time from 2016 to 2018 (P < 0.01) ( Table 2 ). For suicidal ideation, there was a decrease in the number of admissions from higher-need SPAs from 2016 to 2017 (N = 24/20.7% in 2016 and N = 4/3.2% in 2017), but an increase in admissions from higher-need SPAs from 2017 to 2018 (N = 86/63.2%). Need for behavioral health services and suicidality at the level of SPA each had a significant positive association with year of admission (Tau of 0.27 and 0.40, respectively), indicating that the hospital was increasingly admitting patients from areas of greatest mental health need over the study time period ( Fig. 1 ).

Aim 2: Overlap Between SPA-Level Unsheltered Homelessness and Involuntary Psychiatric Admission of Individuals who were Homeless.
Over the study period, most patients were admitted from lower need SPAs (quartiles one and two) in terms of unsheltered homelessness (P < 0.01). In 2016, there were 82 admissions (70.7% of the total admission population for that year) from lower need quartiles of unsheltered homelessness. In 2017 and 2018, there were 76 admissions (62.2%) and 121 admissions (89%), respectively. There was a moderate, negative correlation between unsheltered homelessness quartile and year of admission (Tau of −0.33), indicating fewer hospital admissions from areas with the greatest levels of unsheltered homelessness over time. In examining levels of homelessness severity across SPAs, geospatial maps provided face evidence for a trend of decreased hospital admissions from areas with the highest levels of unsheltered homelessness ( Fig. 2 ).

Aim 3: Association between Admission SPA Mental Illness Need, SPA Unsheltered Homelessness, and Initiation of a Mental Health Conservatorship.
In multiple logistic regression models, unsheltered homelessness was the only need indicator that was significantly associated with odds of conservatorship initiation during hospitalization ( Table 3 ). Patients admitted from a SPA ranked in the 4th quartile of unsheltered homelessness had 1.73 times higher odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82–16.74) of temporary conservatorship initiation compared to patients from SPAs ranked in the 1st quartile of unsheltered homelessness. The SPA-level mental illness indicators (unmet mental health need, suicidality) were not significantly associated with initiation of a temporary conservatorship. Table 3 .

Section: 4. Discussion

This study linked data on involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations of individuals who were homeless from a safety net psychiatric hospital to countywide mental health and homelessness indicators to understand overlap between involuntary psychiatric admissions of individuals who were homeless and areas of greatest need in Los Angeles County. The study leveraged novel data sources to investigate relationships of SPA mental illness need and unsheltered homelessness to level of emergency psychiatric services provided to individuals experiencing homelessness, contributing to improved understanding of where misalignment exists between need and available services. One prior study examined relationships between mental health and social need indicators at the level of SPAs in Los Angeles County and found that SPAs with higher levels of economic hardship were associated with moderate levels of psychological distress and there was a lack of mental health facilities throughout the county ( Robles et al., 2019 ). Our study extends this work by linking homelessness and mental health need indicators to involuntary psychiatric hospital admissions data.
We found that the safety net hospital in this study was increasingly admitting patients from SPAs with higher levels of mental health service need and suicidality over time. These findings may be a signal that safety net psychiatric hospitals are improving their ability to admit individuals from areas of Los Angeles County with higher levels of mental health need, but at the same time, growing involuntary psychiatric admissions for acute psychiatric crises may also point to a failure of primary and secondary prevention in mental health care . Studies have found that people with SMI have higher levels of perceived unmet mental health services need compared to people with any mental illness ( Walker et al., 2015 ) and compared to people without SMI but who require mental health services ( Jones et al., 2014 ). For example, individuals with a depressive disorder are more likely to schedule a mental health visit compared to an individual with either schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder ( Reeves et al., 2011 ). A recent study performed in Los Angeles County found a lack of mental health facilities across the county ( Robles et al., 2019 ), highlighting the importance of existing safety net facilities in caring for people in underserved areas and a need for innovative approaches to addressing SMI ( Enos, 2020 ).
Our study found that fewer individuals were admitted from SPAs with the highest levels of unsheltered homelessness over the study time period, despite findings in Aim 3 suggesting that these areas might have a population of individuals with severe disability from SMI meeting criteria for conservatorship initiation. SMI plays a role in increasing risk for unsheltered homelessness. The most common type of illnesses implicated in SMI are schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar spectrum disorders. Each of these disorders has a unique set of cardinal features (e.g., hallucinations and delusions in schizophrenia, manic or hypomanic episodes in bipolar spectrum disorders) that are often accompanied by a broad spectrum of cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and executive function ( Basso et al., 2002 ; Martínez-Áran et al., 2000 ; Mueser, 2000 ). Given the importance of these cognitive domains in daily function, several studies have investigated the impact of cognitive impairments in SMI, and there is a growing consensus that cognitive impairments are at the core of SMI-related disability ( Elvevag and Goldberg, 2000 ). Without adequate support structures and timely access to appropriate interventions, the combined deficits in mood , thought and cognition associated with SMI can impair an individual's ability to maintain social function, work capacity, and independent living ( McCleery and Nuechterlein, 2019 ). Loss of housing is a particularly harmful outcome for individuals with SMI, as symptomatic individuals who are too impaired to independently seek services may move further away from systems of care, which perpetuates their time spent living in the streets without treatment.
Our study found an association between the level of unsheltered homelessness in a patient's admission SPA and odds of conservatorship initiation, a proxy for mental illness severity. Because there was a trend towards fewer admissions from SPAs with the highest levels of unsheltered homelessness found in Aim 2, findings suggest that populations of individuals with SMI who are also homeless may be underserved. It is important to note that a majority of people experiencing homelessness do not have SMI and the implications of this study only apply to a minority of people experiencing homelessness who also have SMI ( LAHSA, 2020 ). The most recent LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count estimated that the rates of SMI among adults (≥18 years) decreased slightly from 2016 to 2018 (32%, N = 13,921 in 2016; 31%, N = 15,354 in 2017; 27%, N = 12,748 in 2018) ( LAHSA, 2018a ; LAHSA, 2018b ; LAHSA, 2019 ). This decrease may be attributed to the prioritization to house people based on severity indicators such as disabling SMI and length of homelessness. Nevertheless, there are still substantial needs for mental health services in this population ( Fleury et al., 2021 ; Isaacs et al., 2019 ). People experiencing unsheltered homelessness have persistently higher incidence of physical and mental health disorders compared to people who are experiencing sheltered homelessness or who are housed ( Kuhn et al., 2020 ; Petrovich et al., 2020 ), and these needs are often unaddressed or inconsistently addressed by public service systems. Although there is some evidence that people experiencing unsheltered homelessness with SMI are more likely to engage with the homeless service system and emergency services compared to people experiencing sheltered homelessness or unsheltered homelessness without SMI ( Metraux et al., 2016 ), service engagements are often transient and do not often result in resolution of long-term mental health or housing needs ( Choi et al., 2021 ).
Given known overlap between street-based homelessness and SMI, there are several innovations that safety net mental health systems can consider to better meet the psychiatric and residential needs of this population. Los Angeles County has a history of initiatives aimed at meeting housing and mental illness needs for underserved populations (e.g., Whole Person Care; Health Neighborhood Initiative; integration of county physical and mental health services; Housing for Health) ( Favot, 2015 ; Housing for Health, 2022 ; Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, 2022 , Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, 2022 ). However, those programs focused on housing outreach have traditionally focused on linking individuals experiencing homelessness to local programs for psychiatric treatment or housing rather than directly providing psychiatric treatment ( Olivet et al., 2010 ). This focus on service connection rather than direct service provision is likely due to the lack of trained psychiatric providers in street-based settings who could empower outreach teams to initiate treatment ( Koh, 2020 ; Lo et al., 2021 ; Lo et al., 2021 ). Given the critical role of psychiatric treatment in managing the symptoms of SMI, experts have argued that it is essential for outreach teams to include both case managers and mental health providers, such as psychiatrists, nurses, case managers, social workers, and peers to jointly address psychiatric treatment and psychosocial needs while providing culturally and structurally competent care ( Lo et al., 2021b ). The Homeless Outreach & Mobile Engagement (HOME) Team is one such example of a treatment-focused homeless outreach team that was piloted in Los Angeles County in 2018 ( Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, 2021 ). Street-based mental health programs like the HOME Team build trust and rapport with a person experiencing homelessness through consistent and long-term engagement, which, when combined with the team's ability to address treatment and residential needs, can decrease the duration of street homelessness and improve long-term stability ( Christensen, 2009 ; Rowe et al., 2016 ).
Creating more community-based, non-inpatient options for mental health care, including psychiatric urgent care and outpatient mental health facilities, may also help provide more geographically accessible and less restrictive treatment options for people experiencing homelessness ( Maness and Khan, 2014 ; Robles et al., 2019 ). These settings should establish partnerships with housing services to ensure that both mental health and housing needs are addressed together ( Patterson et al., 2014 ; O'Campo et al., 2009 ). Given the sociodemographic diversity of Los Angeles, it is important to offer affordable and culturally competent mental health services and while simultaneously combatting stigma associated with using mental health care, especially among historically marginalized communities. Along all levels of the psychiatric care continuum from street-based outreach to residential facilities, service providers should ensure that resources for meeting basic needs (e.g., food, water, emergency shelter, medical care, clothing, hygiene, harm reduction) are available to individuals with mental health or housing needs.
In considering solutions to addressing mental illness among people experiencing homelessness, it is essential to apply a ‘housing first’ framework and understand that the critical shortage—and in some cases complete absence—of housing options for individuals with SMI in Los Angeles County (e.g., supportive housing, affordable/subsidized housing, residential treatment centers) is ultimately the root of the problem ( Kuehn, 2019 ; Kuhn et al., 2020 ; Padgett et al., 2006 ; Zhu et al., 2021 ). It is difficult, if not impossible, to stabilize mental illness of any kind when people's basic needs are not met, first and foremost of which is a need for shelter ( Brown et al., 2016 ; Kerman et al., 2018 ; Pearson et al., 2009 ). Though Los Angeles County can make progress in reaching people experiencing homelessness with mental health services and building stronger partnerships between existing housing services and mental health systems, progress is unlikely to be sustained without corresponding efforts to increase the supply of community-based mental health residential treatment centers and permanent supportive housing units for people with disability , mental illness, or substance use disorders ( Brown et al., 2016 ; Kerman et al., 2018 ; Pearson et al., 2009 ). Although impairments in insight, cognition, and judgement associated with SMI combined with justified mistrust in health/social service systems by individuals experiencing homelessness can result in them declining services, a truly integrated continuum of psychiatric services that prioritizes relationship-building at all levels of care can help ensure long-term psychiatric and residential stability for this population.
There are strengths and limitations to this study to consider when applying the findings. The study was observational and we were unable to geocode variables at a more granular level than SPA (e.g., census tract). The de-identified hospital administrative data did not include diagnosis or psychiatric severity information, race/ethnicity data, or detailed information on patient housing history. These and other unmeasured confounders could have affected the study results. We also could not determine whether patients were admitted more than once during the study period. The LAHSA Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count data provide a point-in-time estimate of homelessness in Los Angeles County, which does not capture all homelessness or the dynamic changes that can occur in homelessness throughout a year. The CHIS survey data is collected via phone and web-based platforms, which could miss a large proportion of people experiencing homelessness. Our study covered a three-year period, but the rapidly changing nature of homelessness may mean our study is potentially subject to temporal bias . In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic and a temporary pause on enforcement of anti-camping ordinances during the pandemic may have changed the distribution of unsheltered homelessness in Los Angeles County in recent years. Despite these data limitations, LAHSA and CHIS are considered to among the best available measures in Los Angeles County of homelessness and psychosocial status, respectively, and they are frequently used to guide service planning decisions. Our study is one of the few to link psychiatric inpatient admission data to countywide geospatial data on homelessness and mental health severity indicators. Detailed geocoded admission data within Los Angeles County allowed us to explore relationships between psychiatric admissions of adults experiencing homelessness and the extent to which the hospital was admitting individuals from areas of greatest mental health and homelessness need. Because SPAs are used for organizing health and social service delivery in Los Angeles County, this analysis may inform local service planning and resource allocation decisions.
In summary, our study found an association between admission SPA level of unsheltered homelessness and initiation of a mental health conservatorship for grave disability from mental illness. Although fewer patients were admitted from such areas from 2016 to 2018, admissions from areas with higher levels of mental illness need in the county increased over the same time period. These findings highlight potential gaps in mental health outreach services for people experiencing homelessness and where innovations in mental health care provision (e.g., street-based psychiatry teams, community health workers , expanded community-based options for mental health care) should be expanded in areas where unsheltered homelessness is most severe. With such service expansions, inpatient beds and acute mental health care services can be utilized more efficiently to promote population mental health.
