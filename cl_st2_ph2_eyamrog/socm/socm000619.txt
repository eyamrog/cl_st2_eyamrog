Title: How does home ownership affect migrants’ sense of relative deprivation? An investigation based on field theory


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

China is continuing to witness rising numbers of migrants (e.g., individuals migrating from rural to urban areas), and alongside this are the social restrictions and institutional barriers migrants face . Such restrictions and barriers are a consequence of the long-standing urban-rural dualist system and can create a sense of relative deprivation among migrants—that is, dissatisfaction when migrants perceive they are at a disadvantage compared with local residents of an area.

Abstract_Section: Objective and method

Based on Pierre Bourdieu's field theory, the current study used data from the 2017 Chinese General Social Survey ( N = 1849) to explore the mechanism through which migrants' home ownership or non-ownership in the migration process affects their sense of relative deprivation. To do so, a ranked regression and parallel multiple mediation model were developed. Additionally, a heterogeneity analysis was conducted to account for the region in which migrants lived and their age.

Abstract_Section: Results

The results revealed that home ownership significantly reduced migrants' relative deprivation. Moreover, the perception of economic and symbolic capital was found to play a role in the effects of wealth and class, respectively. From the heterogeneity analysis, the direct and mediated effects of housing attributes on migrants’ relative deprivation were more significant for migrants in the eastern versus central and western regions of China, as well as among new-versus older-generation migrants.

Abstract_Section: Conclusion

To improve the feasibility of home ownership among migrants and, thus, alleviate their relative deprivation in the inflow area, relevant policies (e.g., improving the housing system pathway) should be developed and implemented.

Section: 1. Introduction

Since the Reform and Opening-up (a policy of internal reform to the outside world, which China began to implement in December 1978), and due to gaps in regional economic development , China has witnessed large-scale migration among its population. The peak of this migration significantly contributed to the industrialisation, urbanisation, and modernisation that have occurred in China. However, due to the long-standing urban-rural dualist system, migrants continue to face many social restrictions and institutional barriers. For historical reasons, many of the social institutions and constructs in China (e.g., the household registration and social security systems, and employment policies) were formed in the period of the planned economy (1949–1992). Those social institutions and the welfare system in the inflow area contained many limitations, which made it difficult for the migrant population to benefit from them. This made qualification for home ownership among migrants challenging—specifically, it prevented them from accessing sufficient capital for such ownership. This additionally limited their employment opportunities and housing security, ultimately resulting in disparities in the allocation of housing resources between migrants and local residents. In recent years, the Chinese Government has shown a commitment to alleviating the housing problems among migrants by establishing reforms to the housing market ( Jia and Liu, 2007 ). On the one hand, the household registration reform promised a removal of restrictions or a relaxing of conditions in terms of individuals settling in non-first-tier mega cities ( Lin et al., 2021 ). On the other hand, to enhance housing affordability among migrants, coverage of the provident housing-fund system has been extended to migrants who live in cities and have permanent jobs. Notably, although the institutional constraints affecting migrants' access to housing rights in cities have now been weakened, the formulation and implementation of housing policies vary significantly from province to province ( Ping and Zhong, 2018 ). Therefore, migrants’ access to such rights also varies depending on the city in which they live and work. In addition, access to such rights among migrants has changed as a result of differences between provinces in terms of the socioeconomic and institutional environment.
With developments to housing-market reforms and the differentiation between migrant groups increasing (e.g., regional differences exist between eastern, central, and western China, as do generational variations in migrants' individual characteristics), the influence of migrants' socio-economic status, family factors (e.g., number of members) and the housing market on housing choice beyond institutional factors is gradually emerging ( Liu, 2017 ). In terms of social networks, economic capital accumulation and the Chinese Government's local-public administration and service systems, migrants remain disadvantaged compared with local residents living in the same area ( Guan, 2014 ). Therefore, migrants can develop internal feelings of deprivation with respect to their interests. Beyond cross-sectional comparisons with local residents, migrants may longitudinally compare their labour returns in the place of entry with their actual input, such as net labour income earned. In other words, when they perceive their returns do not equal their input, they may begin to perceive that they are experiencing relative deprivation. Thus, migrants' comparisons between themselves and the local residents during migration may lead to a strong sense of relative deprivation among migrants, which is not conducive to their sustainable residence within cities, nor to the growth and productivity of cities more broadly.
Stable housing constitutes a basic human need ( Zhu and Su, 2016 ) and it plays a vital role in migrants' successful integration into the inflow area. Stable housing is not simply a place for individuals to shelter from the natural elements; it provides psychological benefits invaluable to one's sense of security and stability ( Liu and Zhang, 2021 ). Home ownership is closely linked with public management and service systems on a local level and is tied to children's schooling, medical resources, and employment opportunities ( He and Yang, 2013 ). Thus, the residential and social attributes that home ownership offers generate a positive psychological experience and the richer accumulation of resources among migrants, in turn potentially alleviating their sense of social deprivation in the inflow area. Given such notions, the current study addresses the following research questions: 1) Does home ownership among migrants affect their sense of relative deprivation? 2) What are the mechanisms through which this sense of deprivation is influenced?
Addressing these questions can provide important theoretical support and practical guidance towards developing and improving housing security and housing funding systems for the migrant population.

Section: 2. Literature review and theoretical framework

Relative deprivation, first introduced in 1949 by the American sociologist Samuel Stouffer in his study investigating the relationship between morale and promotion among American soldiers, is an important concept in social psychology . This concept covers anger, resentment, and other issues related to deprivation, all of which can arise when one compares oneself to others who are perceived to be at a greater advantage with respect to income, prestige, and power (among others; Stouffer et al., 1949 ). Migrants are at a disadvantage compared with local residents of a given place due to various institutional and environmental factors and, thus, are more likely to feel deprived. Such feelings can threaten how well individuals integrate into the cities to which they migrate ( Wang and Ding, 2019 ).
In recent years, scholars in various fields have investigated the factors contributing to and influencing relative deprivation among migrants. Beginning at the individual level, several scholars have shown that relative deprivation is significantly related to migrants' perceptions of their social class ( Gallo and Matthews, 2003 ). Kraus et al. (2011) found that individuals who perceive they are from a lower social class have higher threat sensitivity and are more likely to exhibit a hostile attribution bias in an ambiguous situation, which in turn can lead to hostile responses. ( Hostile attribution bias is a kind of interpretation bias in which individuals are more likely to interpret ambiguous situations as hostile than benign.) Other scholars have focused on the social justice perspective, arguing that the unequal distribution of external resources is the root cause of migrants' sense of relative deprivation ( Zhang, 2012 ). For example, many countries in transition are currently experiencing a dilemma around the coexistence of rising wealth and its unequal distribution. Accordingly, economic growth has meant that an increasing number of migrants are experiencing a low socioeconomic status ( Brockmann et al., 2009 ), leading to a strong sense of relative deprivation among some groups ( Knight and Gunatilaka, 2011 ) and affecting their re-socialisation (the integration of migrants into the inflow area). Therefore, investigating migrants’ relative deprivation is of great theoretical and practical importance.
As a special material asset, housing is closely related to migrants' micro-behaviours and subjective feelings ( He et al., 2020 ). On the one hand, home ownership is a direct material asset of a household and is a stable value-add; on the other, home ownership provides migrants with a strong socioeconomic status when socially interacting with others. Therefore, most studies have found a significant positive impact of housing ownership on migrants' social-activity participation, asset mix, wealth accumulation, health status, their children's education and, more generally, their quality of life ( Yang et al., 2018 ; Wang, 2019 ). However, there is a lack of existing research that focuses on the housing attributes affecting migrants' relative deprivation and the mechanisms through which such deprivation is sustained. Additionally, considerable socioeconomic differences exist between eastern, central and western China, and there also exist many inter-generational variations in migrants' individual endowments, value aspirations, and career development . It is important, therefore, to acknowledge the impact such differences could have on the findings of the current study.
Based on the literature outlined above, the current study can contribute to the current body of knowledge in two ways. First, it explores the impact of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation in a large developing country with increasing migration numbers in its population. Housing in all countries has always been linked with socio-economic status and has represented an indispensable basis for survival. For migrants, a lack of housing in the place of inflow can affect the stability of their stay and a country's overall development ( Liu et al., 2019 ). Thus, the findings of the current study have policy implications relevant to housing for migrants in developing countries such as China.
Second, this study is based on Bourdieu's field theory and used a parallel mediation model to explore the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between housing attributes and migrants' relative deprivation perceptions. While some studies have analysed this relationship through simple mediation analyses , the effect of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation operates through more than one mediation pathway. Hence, to address this limitation, the current study used parallel mediation to simultaneously analyse multiple mediation pathways, an approach that is consistent with the aims of the study.
In Practice and Reflection: An Introduction to Reflective Sociology , Bourdieu defines the term ‘field’ as ‘a network or a configuration of objective relations between positions’ ( Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1998 ). In other words, it is a network whose logic and laws of operation ensure that the field exists independently of the actor's will and is closely related to the position of the actor within it, the capital at his or her disposal, and the actor's volitional capacity. Therefore, the network exerts certain constraints on the actor's behaviour. The field is jointly constructed by society members following specific logical requirements and is the central place where individuals participate in social activities. Fields are everywhere. As Bourdieu (1997) explains, the world is divided into several small, relatively autonomous social fields that have specific logic and necessity and can become basic units of social analysis.
If the inflow area is a small field, migrants in this area and other actors together constitute this field. This small field has its own operating rules when migrants enter the field and, therefore, they face disadvantages concerning the living environment, income level, and status. They also face unequal treatment concerning population management and social security. They are in a position of social restriction and marginalisation , which is more likely to generate a sense of hostility and the humiliation associated with deprivation (i.e., a sense of relative deprivation; Li, 2012 ). Perceiving relative deprivation can cause individuals great psychological stress and is highly detrimental to migrants' successful integration into urban life . A property (e.g., a house) may influence an individual's or group's sense of relative deprivation since it is among life's essential and vital resources ( Hu and Gong, 2021 ). In contemporary Chinese society, this occurs specifically because home ownership is closely linked with marriage, status, and class, representing a place to live and the distribution of limited urban resources and power, a person's or family's wealth, and their status. Therefore, people (the actors) who own homes occupy a certain position, whereas those who do not are excluded from other positions. Migrants can gradually reduce the distance between themselves and other actors in this small field by purchasing a house and gaining access to a share of the city's resources and power, which may help to reduce their sense of relative deprivation via cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. Thus, the first hypothesis was developed, as follows. Hypothesis 1 Home ownership can reduce migrants' sense of relative deprivation in the inflow area.
Capital is the key to determining an actor's position in a given field. It is the result of historical accumulation and is an exclusive resource. The individual must be able to centre on the main line of capital to take a higher position in the field. The actor's struggle depends on the capital at their disposal, and the aim of the struggle is to gain more capital ( Li, 2002 ). Bourdieu (1999) divided capital into four types: economic, social, cultural and symbolic. Economic capital is an economic strength consisting of income, property, and so on. Social capital is predominantly represented by social networks. Cultural capital broadly refers to any (in) tangible assets related to culture and cultural activities. Finally, symbolic capital refers to resources useful to individuals with respect to credit, fame, and recognition ( Wacquant, 1989 ). All capital forms force, which manifests as power and creates power relationships ( Zhou, 2000 ).
In the context of China, migrants' capital stock and structure play a role in how housing attributes affect their sense of relative deprivation. Housing not only acts as a physical space to meet individuals' survival needs but is also a symbol of a family's wealth and social status, a material carrier of the family culture, and an ideal form of investment ( Tao, 2020 ). Therefore, home ownership in the area of inflow provides migrants with more resources and rights, as well as enriches their capital accumulation. Migrants with more capital can quickly reach a higher position in their new place of residence by purchasing property, in turn reducing the sense of relative deprivation that is created through the inequitable allocation of resources. Therefore, we suggest that capital might play a mediating role in migrants' housing attributes and their sense of relative deprivation. Furthermore, any objective or environment must be reacted to at the level of consciousness via an individual's subjective perceptions ( Nie, 2020 ). While capital itself is only instrumental in nature, it is the perception of capital that is key to influencing the dynamism and creativity of the subjects in the field ( Huang, 2010 ). Thus, the richer and more structured the capital stock that individuals perceive themselves to have, the greater the likelihood they will be able to use their capital gainfully and adapt to their new area of residence.
Therefore, the current study used capital perceptions as part of an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms through which housing attributes affect migrants’ sense of relative deprivation. We proposed the second hypothesis, as follows. Hypothesis 2 Migrants' home ownership affects their sense of relative deprivation by influencing their perception of capital.
Based on Bourdieu's classification of capital types, this study also measured capital perceptions in four ways. First, economic capital (e.g., employment status and household income) represents the main capital in the field, and the degree of perception of economic capital determines which housing decisions migrants may make. Second, perception of social capital refers mainly to the perception of the number of relational network resources that migrants believe they can mobilise during decision-making around housing ( Guarnizo, 2003 ). Social capital becomes key to migrants' ability to own their own homes as early as possible. Third, the perception of cultural capital (i.e., identifying with one's potential human and intellectual capital) plays an important role when seeking a career ( Becker and Tomes, 1979 ). Fourth, the perception of symbolic capital refers to the perception of positioning oneself concerning class in the field and is a key factor in measuring a nation's social mindset and cognitive tendencies. Different types of capital perceptions play different roles in terms of the impact of housing decisions on migrants' sense of relative deprivation; therefore, the mediating role of different capital perceptions should be separately investigated.
Therefore, we developed the following hypotheses. Hypothesis 2a Home ownership increases migrants' perception of economic capital and reduces their sense of relative deprivation. Hypothesis 2b Home ownership increases migrants' perception of social capital and reduces their sense of relative deprivation. Hypothesis 2c Home ownership increases migrants' perception of cultural capital and reduces their sense of relative deprivation. Hypothesis 2d Home ownership increases migrants' perception of symbolic capital and reduces their sense of relative deprivation.
We proposed a theoretical framework based on the current research results and China's current context ( Fig. 1 ). Download: Download high-res image (176KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 . Theoretical framework between housing attributes and the sense of relative deprivation.
In summary, the current study examined the relationship between housing attributes and migrants’ sense of relative deprivation (and the capital perceptions contributing to this relationship) in migrant inflow areas. Focusing on the mediating role of the four capital perceptions, the study sought to answer how housing attributes affect relative deprivation and which effect is more significant.

Section: 3. Methods

The data used in the current study were taken from the 2017 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS). The CGSS was conducted by the Survey and Data Centre of the Renmin University of China. The survey covers 125 counties (districts), 500 streets (townships and towns), 1000 neighbourhood (village) committees, and 10,000 individuals in 10,000 households across China. The sampling method used in the CGSS was multi-order stratified probability proportional to size (PPS) random sampling. However, as the CGSS is a large, continuous interdisciplinary survey, its sampling frame, stratification variables and the sampling stages on which it was based were systematically programmed (on the website of http://cgss.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm ). The CGSS provides a wealth of information on demographic characteristics, housing attributes and capital status, which makes it appropriate for use in the current study.
Referring to Ning and Duan (2017) definition of ‘migrants’, this study selected for its valid sample migrants from the CGSS who had been in the inflow area for one or more months, were not registered in the household of their inflow district (county or city), and were adults (i.e., 18 years or older). Some migrant children were not included in the current study because they were not of an age to purchase a house or earn a wage. Ultimately, 2157 cases met the criteria established for the current study.
The current study focused on relative deprivation and referred to the methodology set out by Cui (2012) . The researcher measured the gap between migrants' subjective perceived economic and social status and that of local residents. The question in the CGSS addressing this reads as follows: ‘ In general, what is your socio-economic status in the current society? ’ Specifically, ‘upper class’ was coded as 1 (lowest relative deprivation) and ‘lower class’ was coded as 5 (highest relative deprivation).
This study drew on the relevant literature ( Zhai et al., 2007 ) and measured housing attributes based on the question in the CGSS that reads ‘ Who owns your current home (partially or totally)? ’ The responses to this question were answered as ‘rented’ or ‘owned’. For those who answered ‘rented’, the variable was coded as 0, and for those who answered ‘owned’, the variable was coded as 1.
Based on the extant literature, this study selected family economic status evaluation, social interaction frequency, Mandarin-level assessment, and social-class orientation as the mediating variables to correspond to the four dimensions (the perception of economic, social, cultural and symbolic capital; Ye and Qian, 2016 ; Zhang et al., 2016 ).
A series of control variables were added to the model to minimise regression errors due to the omitted variables. Based on the existing literature (e.g., Liu and Lei, 2020 ; Xiong and Ye, 2016 ), this study used gender, age, and education level (among others) as control variables, all of which could impact migrants’ sense of relative deprivation. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the variables used. Table 1 . Descriptive statistics of variables. Variable Description Mean Std. Dev.

In the migrant sample, 25 (1.2%) lacked a description of the dependent variable of relative deprivation. For the independent variable, 34 (1.58%) did not respond to the current housing attributes. The missing values for the mediating variables perception of economic capital, social capital, cultural capital and symbolic capital were 32 (1.48%), 29 (1.35%), 19 (0.88%) and 28 (1.30%), respectively. Of the control variables, 19 (0.8%) lacked health status, 14 (0.65%) missed educational attainment, and 24 (1.11%) missed the number of co-residents. According to the 80-% rule set out by Bijlsma et al. (2006) , these cases with missing values were removed from the data set. The final number of valid cases was 1849.
There was a progressive relationship between the options for the dependent variable, relative deprivation. Therefore, this study used a ranked regression model to explore the effect of housing attributes on migrants’ sense of relative deprivation. The specific model used is as follows: (1) D e p r i v a t i o n 1 i = α 2 i + β 1 i P r o p e r t y i + γ 1 i X i + ε 1 i
In equation (1) , Deprivation 1i represents migrants' relative deprivation at the place of inflow, and Property i represents housing attributes. Additionally, Xi represents other control variables, and β 1i represents the effect of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation in the inflow city. Additionally, the current study used the same measurement formula to calculate the degree of influence of housing attributes on local residents' (i.e. who were born in the local area and have lived in the local area since birth) sense of relative deprivation as a reference point in the comparative analysis conducted. This was also performed to evaluate more intuitively the effect of housing attributes on migrants’ sense of relative deprivation.
The parallel mediation model reflects a situation where multiple variables simultaneously mediate the independent and dependent variables. In the theoretical framework established in the current study, it was appropriate to test the role of different capital perceptions in the relationship between housing attributes and migrants’ sense of relative deprivation. Therefore, the following regression equations were key to determining the parallel multiple mediating effects: (2) Y = τX + ε x (3) M i = α i X + ε i (4) Y = τ ′ X + ∑ i = 1 n β i M i + ε
Specifically, X represents housing attributes, Y represents migrants’ sense of relative deprivation, and M i represents the mediating variables—that is, the perception of economic, social, cultural, and symbolic capital. In the formula, i = 1 … n, τ is the total effect of X on Y, τ ′ represents the direct effect of X on Y, and α i β i represents the individual mediating effect. This study examined the possible mediating effects of the four types of capital perceptions.

Section: 4. Results

Table 2 reports the results of the baseline regression estimates of the impact of housing attributes on relative deprivation. The coefficients from models 1–1 and 1–3 show that migrants' housing attributes significantly affected their sense of relative deprivation at the place of inflow. More specifically, migrants’ relative deprivation with housing decreased by 41%. This effect (models 2–1 and 2–3) was relatively weak for local residents. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is supported.

Since the local residents had been living in the local area since birth, their duration of local residence was used as a proxy variable for the variable ‘duration of having local household registration’.
Among the individual characteristics of the control variables, gender, junior college and above, health, number of children, and number of co-residents were all significant. The relative deprivation of women was higher than that of men. Furthermore, higher educational attainment, marriage, greater physical and mental health , a decreasing number of children and increasing co-residents significantly reduced migrants’ relative perceptions of deprivation in the inflow area. In contrast, among local residents, education level and health status significantly affected sense of relative deprivation, and the significance of the other variables (e.g., sex) was lower than that of the migration group.
To ensure the accuracy of the findings, this study also used the OLS model for robustness testing. The significance and direction of the estimated coefficients of the two regression results were essentially consistent with the theoretical hypotheses presented in this paper. Therefore, using the ranked regression model for the regression analysis conducted in the study can be considered suitable.
It is important to note that there may be endogeneity between the decision to purchase a house and migrants' relative sense of deprivation—that is, the decision to purchase a house and migrants' sense of deprivation may have interrelationship. For example, an individual's relative deprivation reflects their income and wealth (two potential determinants of their ability to purchase a home), meaning that the higher migrants' sense of deprivation, the more likely they are not to purchase a home. There may also be problems in this study with confounding factors such as an individual's investment preferences. Such issues have the potential to impact the findings of this study and should be acknowledged. To minimise the possible endogeneity problem between housing attributes and migrants' sense of relative deprivation, and referring to similar studies domestically and internationally ( Hildebrandt et al., 2005 ; Dong and Dai, 2021 ), we used the provincial average home-ownership rate as an instrumental variable in the model. The results obtained were very similar to those obtained for the benchmark model, which demonstrates the robustness of the estimation results in this study. For brevity, we have not included the results here.
According to the test proposed by Fang and Wen (2018) , the parallel mediating effect in the relationship between housing attributes and migrants’ sense of relative deprivation was analysed (see Table 3 for results). The results of the specific analysis are outlined, as follows: (1) The coefficient of path 1 was found to be −0.064 ( p < 0.01) after including the four different types of capital perceptions, indicating that acquiring housing property can reduce migrants' relative deprivation by 6.4%. Therefore, there was a direct negative effect between housing property and migrants' sense of relative deprivation. (2) The coefficients of paths 2, 3 and 5 were found to be 0.182, 0.120 and 0.238, respectively. The three paths were significant, indicating that housing attributes can effectively enhance migrants' perception of economic, social and symbolic capital.

As shown in Table 4 , the mediating effect values for economic and symbolic capital perceptions were found to be −0.064 and −0.063, respectively, and significant at the 1% level. This suggests that housing attributes can reduce migrants’ sense of relative deprivation by increasing their perception of economic and symbolic capital. Therefore, support was found for hypotheses 2a and 2d, but not for 2b and 2c. Table 4 . Decomposition of total, direct and mediating effects.

The study included a heterogeneity analysis regarding migrants in the eastern, central, and western regions ( Fig. 2 ) and among those from the older versus younger generation (the new generation was born after 1980; Fig. 3 ). This analysis was performed to further verify whether capital perception played a mediating role across the different regions of China and among the different generations of migrants, and if so, what those differences were.

Fig. 2 depicts the mechanism of influence between housing attributes and migrants' sense of relative deprivation across different regions. The results revealed a direct effect of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation ( B = −0.042) in the eastern region, and this was mediated by the perception of economic ( B = −0.048) and symbolic capital ( B = −0.068). In the western region, access to housing property was found to reduce migrants' sense of relative deprivation by 14.8%, while the mediating effect of economic capital perception was found to be −0.121. Therefore, housing property also reduced migrants' sense of relative deprivation by increasing their economic capital perception. Compared with the eastern and western regions, the central region showed no significant effect on migrants’ relative deprivation, with economic capital perceptions fully mediating the two. Therefore, variability in the relative deprivation of housing attributes among migrants in different regions was also revealed.
Fig. 3 depicts the mediation pathway between housing attributes and migrants' sense of relative deprivation for the new and older generation. The results revealed that the housing attributes of new-generation migrants in the inflow area significantly affected their sense of relative deprivation, with a direct and significant effect ( B = −0.095, p < 0.01). Additionally, economic- ( B = −0.063, p < 0.01) and symbolic-capital ( B = −0.073, p < 0.01) perceptions played a part in mediating the effect. In contrast, the mechanism influencing housing attributes towards alleviating older-generation migrants' sense of relative deprivation was only mediated through the direct effect ( B = −0.079, p < 0.1) and the mediating role was played by the perception of economic capital ( B = −0.066, p < 0.01). Therefore, this suggests it is necessary to adopt targeted measures in the development of housing policy to reduce migrants’ sense of relative deprivation based on different generational characteristics.

Section: 5. Discussion

The current study revealed three important empirical findings, as follows.
First, compared with local residents, home ownership markedly reduced migrants’ sense of relative deprivation at the place of inflow. In contemporary Chinese society, home ownership can reduce this because it represents for migrants more than merely a place to live. It is largely linked with urban resources and power, representing access to urban domicile, benefits, prestige, and status. This positive psychological experience brought about by housing itself, as well as its associated public benefits, can alleviate the relative deprivation that comes with moving between areas. For local residents, as housing is considered a family asset and passed down from generation to generation in China, it becomes fixed capital owned since birth ( Wu and Wei, 2018 ) and, thus, it is difficult to alleviate the sense of relative deprivation through acquiring home ownership.
Second, housing attributes further influence migrants' sense of relative deprivation by affecting their perception of economic and symbolic capital. Home ownership increases the stock of fixed assets and generates a positive ‘wealth effect’ from rising house prices ( Wang and Pang, 2019 ), increasing migrants' perceived economic capital in the field by narrowing the housing wealth gap. This factor, in turn, reduces the likelihood of migrants judging themselves to be at a disadvantage. Hence, economic capital perception may play a mediating role in the relationship between housing attributes and a sense of relative deprivation. Against the social stratification caused by housing wealth in China, housing enhances migrants' position in terms of social class and can increase the ‘class effect’ brought about by the perception of symbolic capital, reducing migrants' emotional dissatisfaction and resentment. Therefore, the perception of symbolic capital also plays an essential role. The acquisition of cultural capital is only slowly passed on to future generations via family education and investing in education ( Louis, 1938 ), whereas social relations of origin are likely to be replicated and transplanted as migrants enter new arenas ( Paul, 2013 ). Therefore, capital perception only partially mediated the effect of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation.
Third, the mechanism underpinning the influence of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation can play a more important role for this population in the eastern versus central and western regions of China. On the one hand, the supply of eastern urban residential land exceeds the demand, and housing prices are high and continue to increase. On the other hand, most cities on the eastern seaboard have formulated and implemented the policy of purchase restrictions to ensure the normal functioning of cities. Therefore, if migrants were able to obtain their own homes in these cities, such problems would be solved both at the market and institutional level, in turn improving migrants' quality of life and access to urban resources. Once they have secured a home, migrants' sense of relative deprivation in the local area can significantly be reduced. In contrast, the central and western regions are experiencing a lag in real-estate market development. This, in turn, can diminish the impact of housing attributes and migrants’ sense of relative deprivation.
Compared with older migrant generations, home ownership among the new generation can significantly reduce their sense of relative deprivation. The new generation of migrants exhibits a stronger desire for urban life and citizenship during the migratory process due to the changing context of the times, and they may exhibit a stronger desire to establish themselves in the city. In both quantitative and qualitative studies , scholars generally agree that the economic stress experienced by new-generation migrants ranks first among family stressors ( Xu and Bao, 2007 ). Furthermore, the wealth and class effects brought about by property rights could make new-generation migrants more comfortable coping with the pressure ( Cai, 2010 ). Thus, economic and symbolic capital perceptions can mediate between home ownership of new-generation of migrants and their sense of relative deprivation, what is verified by the social reality.
The empirical findings of this study have important policy implications. First, the progressive development pathway of the housing system for migrants should be improved. The system of ‘renting and selling’ should be strictly implemented to ensure that migrant groups who rent private housing can enjoy public rental housing or low-cost housing and other public services in the city. Another important recommendation is that it would be advantageous to strengthen migrants' ability (especially in the eastern region) to cope with housing risks. The local governments could set up a buffer mechanism for migrants against housing pressure through the community, labour unions, and other organisations. Third, the accessibility of social security services for all migrant generations should be improved, especially for the new generation. The main objective is to create conditions for migrants and their children to enjoy better public services and gradually integrate them into a unified public service system to reduce their sense of relative deprivation.
The current study has some limitations that need to be addressed in future studies. First, the research design adopted in the current study contains some limitations around the selection of these variables based on the content of the CGSS questionnaire. The selection of variables in future studies could delve deeper into their relationship with relative deprivation from multiple dimensions (e.g., housing conditions , environment, house prices, and location). In contrast, the proxies selected for the mediating variables (the perception of economic, social, cultural and symbolic capital) are not limited to self-assessed household economic status, frequency of social interaction, level of Mandarin, or social class orientation. As such, they can also include employment status, political participation , social security, and the like. Second, the attempt to apply Bourdieu's field theory in a Chinese context to empirically study the impact of the housing problem on migrants' sense of relative deprivation, the canalisation of this theory, and the study's conclusions must be further verified. Thus, our study can be taken as a starting point, inspiring more contextually relevant hypotheses for future research.

Section: 6. Conclusions

Applying the field theory framework, the current study used data from the 2017 CGSS to measure the impact of housing attributes on migrants' sense of relative deprivation at the place of inflow. The study explored the parallel mediating role played by capital perceptions (e.g., economic capital perception). A heterogeneity analysis was conducted to account for the region in which migrants lived and their age. The results revealed that home ownership significantly reduced migrants' sense of relative deprivation. The perception of economic and symbolic capital was found to play a role in terms of the ‘wealth effect’ and ‘class effect’, respectively. From the heterogeneity analysis, the direct and mediated effects of housing attributes on migrants' relative deprivation were more significant for migrants in the eastern versus central and western regions of China, as well as among new-versus older-generation migrants. This result helped us understand the relationship between housing attributes and migrants' sense of relative deprivation. The findings have important practical implications for improving systems, such as housing security systems and housing provident funds, towards helping migrants minimise their sense of relative deprivation and enabling them to successfully integrate into the place of inflow.
