Title: Revisiting the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide: An alternative approach


Abstract: Abstract

Previous research provides evidence that economic uncertainty is powerful enough to precipitate suicide. This study examines whether the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide in the US is (i) context dependent and (ii) asymmetric. To answer these questions, we link US monthly total- age- and gender-specific suicide rates to the US Economic Policy Uncertainty index between 1999 and 2019, controlling for month fixed effects , year fixed effects and unemployment rates. We find that the relationship between economic uncertainty and the suicide rates of males in their mid-career (aged 25–54) and late career (aged 55–64) is context dependent. Our results show that absolute monthly changes in economic uncertainty have no effect on suicide rates of males aged 25–54 and 55–64, whereas when these changes are unexpected – departing from the economic uncertainty regime during which they occur – they precipitate the suicide of these age- and gender-specific groups. Additionally, our findings provide evidence of the presence of negativity bias in these relationships. We show that extreme unexpected increases in economic uncertainty induce suicide of males aged 25–54 and 55–64, while extreme unexpected decreases in economic uncertainty do not significantly decrease suicide rates of these age- and gender-specific groups. Females, with the exception of those aged 65 plus, are perceived to be predominantly insulated from changes in economic uncertainty. Our results suggest that females aged 65 plus are particularly affected by extreme unexpected increases in economic uncertainty, suggesting that the relationship for females aged 65 plus is context dependent and exhibits negativity bias.

Section: 1. Introduction

Suicide in the US is a serious public health issue. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021), suicide was responsible for the death of more than 47,500 people in 2019. Particularly concerning, the suicide rate in the US increased 33 per cent from 1999 through 2019. This dramatic surge in suicide incidences has provoked a debate across policymakers and researchers alike, with regard to its causes, correlates and protective factors.
Economic uncertainty has only recently gained empirical attention in the literature on suicide. Extant literature on the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide shows that the threat of job loss and the associated financial insecurity are sufficiently powerful to induce suicide. Vandoros et al. (2019) employ time series analysis to investigate this relationship in the UK in the short run. Their findings suggest that daily spikes in economic uncertainty are associated with increases in daily suicide counts. Studies using suicide data in the US come to a similar conclusion in the long run ( Antonakakis and Gupta, 2017 ) as well as in the short-run ( Vandoros and Kawachi, 2021 ). The above studies use the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index developed by Baker et al. (2016) to proxy economic uncertainty experienced by the general population. Recently, Abdou et al. (2020) utilize stock market volatility as an alternate measure to capture economic insecurity and find that the relationship in the US is limited to males aged 15–24 and females aged 55–64. Nevertheless, they suggest that future research could potentially use the EPU index to better capture economic insecurity at the population level .
While the findings from previous studies examining the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship are novel and informative, their analysis inspires several questions with respect to some unexplored aspects of this relationship. The current paper addresses two of these questions. First, their analytical framework does not account for the regime of economic uncertainty within which rises in economic uncertainty occur. In other words, it conceals potential heterogeneity by the nation's economic uncertainty context. The question we ask in this study is, “Does the general population perceive changes in economic uncertainty relative to a reference point of the prevailing economic uncertainty variability or on the basis of the absolute changes?” Put differently, do changes in economic uncertainty impact the psychological health of the general population in absolute or when they are unexpected? Second, previous studies implicitly assume that the response of suicide is symmetric to changes in economic uncertainty, ignoring potential asymmetry in this relationship. This, in turn, raises an important question, “Do changes in economic uncertainty have an asymmetric effect on suicide?” By shedding light on these unexplored aspects of the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship, this paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of this relationship.

Section: 2. Literature review and hypotheses development

With respect to the first of these questions, the analytical approach of previous studies does not account for the economic uncertainty regime within which changes in economic uncertainty occur. Therefore, they offer little guidance as to whether the adverse effect of economic uncertainty on suicide differs according to the economic uncertainty context. However, there is a theoretical basis as well as empirical findings for proposing that the effect may be context dependent.
The theoretical basis for the possibility of heterogeneous response by economic uncertainty context can be found in Helson's (1964) Adaptation-Level Theory. The proposition of this theory is that individuals' perceptions and judgements of stimuli are in relation to their previous experience with them. This prior experience defines a reference point or adaptation level to which the current level of a stimulus is perceived as exceeding or not in comparison with it. Furthermore, according to the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) , individuals tend not to evaluate situations in absolute magnitude but rather as gains or losses relative to a reference point. The past level of a certain experience to which individuals have become accustomed defines this reference point.
This raises concerns that the general population may not perceive changes in economic uncertainty (stimulus) on the basis of the absolute changes, but rather with reference to the economic uncertainty regime within which they occur (reference point) , which at an aggregate-level defines the population's previous experience of economic uncertainty (adaptation level) . Does the general US population adapt to an economic uncertainty regime so that shocks to economic uncertainty impact the mental health of the population if they are unexpected? Despite the policy relevance of this question, such investigations at an aggregate level of the role of economic uncertainty context as a reference point in shaping individuals' response to economic uncertainty fluctuations are lacking. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the mental health of the general population respond more strongly to economic shocks when they are unexpected. By rescaling stock market returns by the volatility regime during which they occur, Engelberg and Parsons (2016) demonstrate that they affect the psychological health of investors more aggressively when they are unexpected.
However, at the individual level, a number of studies lend support to the theoretical propositions set out above and provide empirical evidence of the role of anticipation and adaptation in psychological wellbeing to job insecurity. The present research will use these studies as a proxy that sheds light on the behaviour of the general population towards economic uncertainty. In fact, micro-level studies suggest that the adverse psychological impact associated with the onset of job insecurity, such as anxiety, depression, and feeling of insecurity, did not become more potent over the duration of the job insecurity spell, rather partially subsided over time ( Kinnunen et al., 1999 ; Rocha et al., 2006 ). Research explains this finding by the fact that individuals adapt to the new normal and shift their perception of what constitutes a threatening situation, that is, they experience a shift in the reference level of insecurity ( Klug et al., 2020 ).
Furthermore, research suggests that unanticipated shocks to individuals' perception of their job security has a detrimental effect on their psychological wellbeing . Permanent jobs are perceived to be more secure than temporary contracts. However, empirical studies by De Cuyper and De Witte (2006) and Bernhard-Oettel et al. (2005) , counterintuitively, show that temporary employees do not respond with the same strong adverse reactions to rises in job insecurity as employees with permanent contracts. The explanation for these rather contradictory findings rests on job insecurity expectations ( De Cuyper et al., 2008 ). From the perspective of temporary workers, job insecurity is anticipated, therefore, when it happens, it has little impact on their psychological wellbeing ( De Cuyper and De Witte, 2007 ). This is contrary to permanent employees for whom perceiving more job insecurity is not expected. Corroborating these findings, a recent longitudinal study by Bernhard-Oettel et al. (2020) suggests that the average levels of perceived job insecurity over time act as a reference point according to which individuals perceive and respond to rises in job insecurity. The findings of this study reveal that the longer the past experience of job insecurity, the lower the adverse impact of increases in job insecurity on one's psychological wellbeing.
In summation, there is evidence at the micro-level indicating that the adaptation to, and anticipation of, job insecurity plays a role in shaping individuals' response to rises in job insecurity. Put differently, individuals’ response to changes in job insecurity is not on the basis of the absolute changes but rather reference dependent. If job insecurity is not anticipated – deviating from their past experience of job insecurity to which they have become adapted, it will have a significant impact on wellbeing.
That said, we predict that if the general population adapts and adjusts its expectations to the regime of economic uncertainty, one would expect that increases in economic uncertainty occurring within high regimes of economic uncertainty will have little impact on suicide, given that they are anticipated. In other words, the population's expectations are revised upward to a high level of economic uncertainty. In the opposite scenario, equal changes of economic uncertainty when they occur during regimes of economic stability will have a greater psychological impact as they are deviating from the population's expectations. Therefore, a testable prediction is that changes in economic uncertainty will have a greater effect on suicide when they are unexpected.
We now focus on the second question. Previous studies implicitly assume that suicide rates exhibit a symmetrical response to changes in economic uncertainty ( Antonakakis and Gupta, 2017 ; Vandoros et al., 2019 ; Vandoros and Kawachi, 2021 ). That is, the impact of increases in economic uncertainty on suicide is similar in absolute value (and significance) to the impact of decreases in economic uncertainty on suicide. Generally, the majority of studies in the economic literature on suicide ignore the potential asymmetric response of suicide to its risk factors . However, recently, some research has challenged this assumption. Botha and Nguyen (2022) , Chang and Chen (2017) and Wu and Cheng (2010) examine the asymmetric response of suicide rates to changes in the unemployment rate. Their studies provide empirical evidence supporting the asymmetry in the unemployment-suicide relationship. Whether suicide fluctuates asymmetrically in response to changes in economic uncertainty remains an open empirical question, one that this paper addresses. Therefore, this research departs methodologically from the majority of the economic literature on suicide implicitly assuming the symmetric response of suicide to its determinant and builds upon a small but growing literature examining its potential asymmetric response .
In fact, there is a growing body of research in other subject domains showing that individuals' psychological wellbeing responds asymmetrically to positive and negative stimuli. The psychological literature has long documented a positive-negative asymmetry in how individuals evaluate events, precisely documenting a negativity bias in human behaviour. Negativity bias is the idea that “negative events are more salient, potent, dominant in combinations, and generally efficacious than positive events” ( Rozin and Royzman, 2001 , p. 297 ) . In cases when positive and negative stimuli are of equal intensity, the negative stimuli provoke an elevated physiological response compared to their positive counterparts. This negativity bias echoes with the concept of loss aversion – a fundamental principle of prospect theory – postulating that individuals are more psychologically aroused by losses than corresponding gains. Furthermore, experimental investigations of individuals‘ psychological responses to real news reveal that negative economic and political news arouse stronger psychophysiological reactions than positive news ( Soroka et al., 2019 ; Soroka, 2006 ). Some empirical findings that lend support to negativity bias emerge from a recent study investigating the short-run relationship between investors’ psychological health and stock market fluctuations ( Engelberg and Parsons, 2016 ). By splitting stock market returns into quintiles as an alternative approach to investigate the asymmetry in this relationship, their analysis shows that extreme negative stock market shocks (lowest quintile) increase hospital admissions for psychological disorders , while extreme positive shocks (top quintile) have no corresponding benefit on the psychological health of US investors. This current study will adopt Engelberg and Parsons's (2016) methodology to examine whether the economic uncertainty-suicide is asymmetric.
Most relevant to our study is the growing bodies of population-level studies in the political economy literature repeatedly documenting negativity bias in public responsiveness to economic news and information. The most consistent finding in this literature is that negative economic information elicits a stronger public response than positive economic information ( Soroka, 2006 ). Additionally, research distinguishing between the short-run effect of economic expansions and contractions on voting behaviours suggests that economic downturns depress the voting for the party of the incumbent president, but the president reaps little benefit from economic upturns ( Bloom and Price, 1975 ; Dassonneville and Lewis-Beck, 2014 ; Kappe, 2018 ).
The growing body of research providing evidence of the asymmetric relationship between economic news and public response together with the large psychological literature suggesting the negativity bias in human behaviour provides the motivation for the current research to examine the asymmetric response of suicide to economic uncertainty. Against this background, we hypothesize that short-run increases in economic uncertainty will significantly increase suicide, while short-run decreases in economic uncertainty will have limited or no impact on suicide.

Section: 3. Data

Our analysis employs data on the monthly number of deaths by suicide stratified by age and gender from January 1999 to December 2019 provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER Database (ICD-10 codes: suicide (*U03, X60-X84,Y87.0)). We collect monthly population estimates by gender and age from the US Census Bureau. Monthly population estimates are not available for all months. Similar to Abdou et al. (2020) and Harper and Bruckner (2017) , missing values are interpolated under the assumption of linear growth. Suicide rates are calculated as the monthly number of deaths by suicide divided by the monthly population estimates per 100,000 persons. Suicide rates are calculated separately for total, males and females for four age groups: 15–24 years, 25–54 years, 55–64 years, and 65 plus years. As shown in Table 1 , the mean suicide rates for males aged 15–24, 25–54 and 55–64 are approximately four times higher than those of their female counterparts. The gender gap in suicide rates widens in the age group 65 plus and is approximately seven times higher in males than in females. Table 1 . Summary statistics, January 1999 to December 2019.

Economic insecurity measures are numerous ( Richiardi and He, 2020 ). Previous population-level studies examining the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship have employed two different measures: stock market volatilities ( Abdou et al., 2020 ) and the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index developed by Baker et al. (2016) ( Antonakakis and Gupta, 2017 ; Vandoros et al., 2019 ; Vandoros and Kawachi, 2021 ). Notably, the EPU measure shows capabilities of capturing economic uncertainty experienced by the general population in different countries as well as different time frames. Therefore, we follow previous studies in measuring economic uncertainty using the EPU index.
Baker et al. (2016) use three types of components to construct the US EPU index. The first is a news coverage index that draws on the search results from ten leading US newspapers for articles containing economic and policy uncertainty-related terms – ‘uncertainty’ or ‘uncertain’, ‘economic’ or ‘economy’ and one or more of the following terms: 'congress', ‘federal reserve’, ‘regulation’, ‘white house’, ‘legislation’ or ‘deficit’. The second component uses the lists of temporary federal tax code provisions compiled by the Congressional Budget Office due to expire over the next ten years. Because Congress usually extend these temporary tax measures at the last minute, they cause uncertainty for households and businesses. The third component exploits disagreement between economic forecasters on future levels of federal government purchases and the Consumer Price Index that are impacted by monetary and fiscal policy. As shown in Table 1 , the monthly changes in the EPU index are on average 1.97 per cent, but reach as high as 123.1 per cent in some months and as low as −47.4 per cent in other months. One-year volatility, that is, the standard deviation of the monthly changes in the EPU index over the past year, shows great variability over the study period ranging from 6.5 per cent to 42.05 per cent. This, in turn, suggests a great variability in the economic uncertainty context over the study period.
We also utilize data on monthly unemployment rates obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Given the substantial variation in unemployment rates across age groups and by gender, we employ total and gender-specific unemployment rates stratified into four age groups (16–24, 25–54, 55–64, and 65 plus). As shown in Table 1 , mean unemployment rates differ across ages and genders, with notable variation in unemployment rates across age groups rather than between males and females. For both genders, the mean unemployment rates are higher among early careers (aged 16–24) than mid-careers (aged 25–54), late careers (aged 55–64) and older workers (aged 65 plus).
One concern when dealing with time series data is whether it is generated by a stationary process. We perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root tests on each of our variables (available in the online Appendix). The results suggest that all variables are either integrated of order one (I(1)) or zero (I(0)). We also test all models for cointegration using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration methodology (available upon request). The results generally provide no evidence of a cointegration relationship among the underlying variables in our models. Therefore, to address the issue of nonstationary of our variables (in addition to the absence of cointegration relationships), suicide, the EPU index and unemployment rates will all be represented as changes rather than levels.

Section: 4. Methods

We begin our analysis by examining the relationship between suicide and economic uncertainty. Previous studies suggest considerable heterogeneity by age and gender in the relationship between suicide and a broad range of macroeconomic variables , including unemployment ( Chang et al., 2013 ), austerity ( Antonakakis, 2015 ) and in particular, economic uncertainty ( Abdou et al., 2020 ; Antonakakis and Gupta, 2017 ; Vandoros et al., 2019 ). We, therefore, investigate the economic uncertainty-suicide nexus across males and females at different stages of career development : early careers (aged 15 to 24), mid careers (aged 25 to 54), late careers (aged 55 to 64) and older workers (aged 65 plus). This allows us to identify the stage in career development where economic uncertainty becomes a suicide risk factor .
We design a model linking changes in total, age- and gender-specific suicide rates to changes in the monthly US EPU index between January 1999 and December 2019. (1) Suicide t = γ + α EPU t + β Unemployment t + ρ X t + ε t s u i c i d e t is the rate of change in US monthly total, age- and gender-specific suicide rates; E P U t is the rate of change in the monthly US EPU index scaled by the standard deviation of the monthly rate of changes in the index averaged over the full sample. Therefore, the coefficient α captures the effect of one standard deviation increase in the monthly rate of change in the uncertainty index on the monthly rate of change in suicide rates. Research suggests that unexpected shocks to the EPU index significantly impact unemployment rates in the US ( Caggiano et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, unemployment is a well-established risk factor for suicide. Therefore, unemployment may be a pathway through which changes in the EPU index impact upon suicide incidences. To disentangle the effect of unemployment from the effect of economic uncertainty on suicide, we include the term U n e m p l o y m e n t t in all models. Additionally, the term X t represents a vector of controls that we believe are important to include in our model. Previous research suggests that suicide exhibits strong seasonal patterns ( Christodoulou et al., 2012 ), therefore, month fixed effects are included to control for suicide seasonality. Additionally, we control for year fixed effects to account for temporal changes in suicide rates.
To test our prediction that changes in economic uncertainty will have a stronger impact on suicide when they are unexpected, we adopt Engelberg and Parsons's (2016) approach in testing the effect of stock market returns on the psychological health of investors when they are unexpected. We scale the monthly changes in the EPU index by a rolling one-year volatility, that is, the standard deviation of the monthly rate of changes in the EPU index over the past year instead of the standard deviation over the full sample as in Equation (1) . The central idea behind this approach is that, as shown in Table 1 , one-year volatility shows great variability over the study period ranging from 6.5 per cent to 42.05 per cent. As illustrated by Engelberg and Parsons (2016) , increases in economic uncertainty of a given magnitude (100 per cent, for example) may evoke a stronger response, if they occur during periods of economic stability (low-volatility regimes), where such extreme shocks to economic uncertainty are relatively unusual. Therefore, scaling the monthly changes in the EPU index by a rolling one-year volatility assigns a higher weight to increases in economic uncertainty that occur during periods of economic stability (6.5 per cent, for example - low volatility regime) versus those occurring during periods of economic uncertainty (42.05 per cent, for example - high volatility regime). The volatility over the past year will, therefore, play the role of a reference point – economic uncertainty context. Put differently, we rescale changes in the uncertainty index and assign them weight corresponding to the economic uncertainty context or regime within which they occur, where more weight is assigned to changes when they are unexpected (individuals are surprised) versus those anticipated. As demonstrated by Engelberg and Parsons (2016) , if individuals perceive economic uncertainty changes by reference to the economic uncertainty regime, in other words, the relationship is context dependent, we would observe the effect will increase in magnitude in the specification using the weighted EPU index in comparison with the specification using the unweighted index.
To test our second hypothesis in relation to negativity bias in the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship, we adopt Engelberg and Parsons's (2016) methodology in examining the asymmetric effect of stock market changes on hospitalizations related to mental health conditions. We replicate the specification of Equation (1) , however, we incorporate changes in the EPU index (divided by a rolling one-year standard deviation) into our model by dividing them into quintiles. As shown in Table 1 , the bottom quintile represents extreme negative changes in the scaled EPU index ranging from −72.9 per cent to −210.5 per cent, the second quintile represents moderate negative changes in the index ranging from −27.2 per cent to −71.1 per cent, the third quintile ranges from −26.1 per cent to 19.9 per cent, the fourth quintile represents moderate positive changes in the scaled index ranging from 20.6 per cent to 81.5 per cent, and the top quintile represents extreme positive changes in the index ranging from 86.1 per cent to 313.3 per cent. We omit the third quintile. Engelberg and Parsons's (2016) methodology has advantage over other approaches that examine asymmetrical relationships that only consider positive and negative changes in the variable of interest. Their approach allows separate examination of the effects of extreme increases and declines as well as moderate increases and declines in the EPU index on suicide rates whose effects might be obscured in alternative asymmetric methodologies.

Section: 5. Results

Table 2 presents the results from the estimation of Equation (1) examining the linear relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide rates. Panel A shows the results of the contemporaneous impact (within the same month) of changes in the uncertainty index on changes in total, age- and gender-specific suicide rates. We find that the relationship is insignificant in all models with the exception of females aged 65 plus for whom we find a significant positive relationship. The coefficients of unemployment rates are statistically insignificant in all models, with the exception of females aged 55–64 and 65 plus, for whom the coefficients are statistically significant.

It is possible that changes in economic uncertainty do not impact suicide immediately, but rather take time to manifest into suicide actions. To explore this possibility, in Panel B, we introduce two lags of the changes in the uncertainty index into our models. The results indicate that changes in the uncertainty index have no lagging effects on suicide rates across all models, with the exception of a lagging effect on the suicide of males aged 65 plus. The impact of one standard deviation increase in the rate of change of the uncertainty index today is significantly associated with a 0.008 per cent increase in the monthly suicide rate of males aged 65 plus in the next month.
We now turn our attention to our second and also the primary empirical investigation. In Table 3 , we repeat the specification of Table 2 but we scale the monthly changes in the EPU index by a rolling one-year volatility to examine whether the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship is context dependent. As illustrated by Engelberg and Parsons (2016) , if the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide is context dependent, we will observe that the effect will increase in magnitude in Table 3 compared to the results obtained in Table 2 . This will indicate that economic uncertainty changes impact suicide when they are surprising. The results in Panel A of Table 3 (the contemporaneous relationship) show that the association between changes in the uncertainty index and changes in the total suicide rate of individuals aged 25–54 turns significant and increases in magnitude compared to the results obtained in Table 2 . The coefficient estimate is 0.006 per cent for those aged 25–54 in the dynamic specification of Table 3 vs. 0.003 per cent in the static specification of Table 2 . Nevertheless, we find that the relationship remains insignificant for individuals aged 15–24, 55–64 and 65 plus. Investigating the relationship per gender, however, reveals that males are responsible for this relationship in the age group 25–54 and that the effect has also increased in magnitude relative to the specification of Table 2 (0.009 per cent in Table 3 vs. 0.006 per cent in Table 2 ). The increase in suicides associated with changes in economic uncertainty for males aged 25–54 is sufficiently large to yield a statistically significant association in the total suicide rate of this age group, even with the lack of significant effects for their female counterparts. By contrast, we find no evidence of a significant association between changes in the uncertainty index and changes in suicide rates for males aged 15–24, 55–64 and 65 plus or females in any age group.

The results in Panel B, Table 3 examining the lag relationship, are consistent with the results in Table 2 indicating that the impact of changes in our constructed uncertainty index (EPU scaled by a rolling one-year volatility) on the suicide of males aged 65 plus show up the next month. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the effect remains unchanged between the specification in Table 2 , Table 3 (0.008 in both specifications). This suggests that the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide of males aged 65 plus is not context dependent.
So far, changes in economic uncertainty are assumed to be linearly related to suicide rates. In Table 4 , we replicate the specification in Table 3 (Panel A), but incorporate changes in the EPU index (scaled by a rolling one-year volatility) into our model by dividing them into quintiles. Results in Table 4 provide evidence of the presence of negativity bias in the relationship between economic uncertainty and the suicide of males aged 25–54 and 55–64 and females aged 65 plus. The results show that extreme unexpected positive changes in the uncertainty index (top quintile) result in significant positive changes in the suicide rates of these age- and gender-specific groups, while extreme unexpected negative changes in the uncertainty index (bottom quintile) – increases in economic stability – do not improve the mental health of these age- and gender-specific groups. In contrast, the models evaluating total suicide in all age groups, males aged 15–24 and 65 plus as well as females aged 15–24, 25–54 and 55–64 are lacking statistical significance for all quintiles.

Two important findings to draw from our analysis of the asymmetric relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide. First, while the linear specification of Table 3 obscured the relationship between changes in economic uncertainty when they are surprising and changes in the suicide rate of males aged 55–64 and females aged 65 plus, the nonlinear specification of Table 4 uncover its presence. Correct model specification is then crucial to our understanding of economic conditions-suicide relationships ( Botha and Nguyen, 2022 ). Second, by using our constructed measure of economic uncertainty (EPU scaled by a rolling one-year volatility) that accounts for the economic uncertainty context in the examination of the asymmetry in this relationship, our results indicate that not only the suicide of males aged 25–54 and 55–64 and females aged 65 plus responds to increases in economic uncertainty when they are surprising, but also conditioned on being extreme positive surprising shocks. Declines in economic uncertainty even when they are surprising do not reduce suicide rates of these age and gender-specific groups.

Section: 6. Discussion

The investigation of the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship is still at an early stage and particularly in terms of its methodological discussion. Our study establishes several novel empirical findings regarding this relationship.
Notably, our analysis demonstrates age as well as gender specificity in the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship. With respect to males, our results provide evidence that the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide of males in their mid-career (aged 25–54) and late-career (aged 55–64) is context-dependent and exhibits negativity bias. Using a static model to examine the relationship between economic uncertainty and male suicides, we found that absolute monthly changes in economic uncertainty are not significantly associated with changes in monthly suicide rates for all age groups, with the exception of a lagging effect by one month on males aged 65 plus. However, using a dynamic model that accounts for the regime of economic uncertainty over the past year – economic uncertainty context – as well as the asymmetry in the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship, we found that the relationship for males aged 25–54 and 55–64 is driven entirely by extreme unexpected increases in economic uncertainty – departing from the economic uncertainty regime during which they occur, while no corresponding decreases in suicide rates of these age- and gender-specific groups following extreme unexpected decreases in economic uncertainty. Conversely, for males aged 15–24 and 65 plus, there is no evidence of either a negativity bias or the relationship being context dependent.
Therefore, from these results, it could be inferred that increases in economic uncertainty per se do not precipitate suicide of males in their prime working years (aged 25–54) and in late careers (aged 55–64) but rather when these increases are extreme and unexpected, they impact negatively on the psychological health of males in these stages of their career development . This lends empirical support to the Adaptation-Level Theory of Helson (1964) and the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) that individuals do not perceive stimuli (economic uncertainty changes) on the basis of absolute magnitude but rather by reference to their previous experience (volatility of economic uncertainty changes over the past year). Therefore, by accounting for the negativity bias in this relationship as well the economic uncertainty context within which shocks in economic uncertainty occur, we gain an appreciation as to how important it is to specify the entire economic uncertainty context and to account for the negativity bias in this relationship without which the effect of economic uncertainty on suicide of males aged 25–54 and 55–64 can be obscured.
In fact, the adverse impact of unexpected extreme increases in economic uncertainty on suicide being particularly marked in males in mid-career (aged 25–54) and late-career (aged 55–64) is not surprising. Males in these age groups are potentially carrying the economic burden of their families and are expected to fulfil their masculine role ( Norris, 2016 ). Therefore, it could be speculated that when negative economic news comes as a surprise, it may cause financial turbulence. Subsequently, one may feel a strong urge to cut spending dramatically in order to accumulate precautionary savings to protect against potential income shocks. Indeed, research suggests that individuals anticipating future financial troubles tend to reduce or delay consumption ( Benito, 2006 ) and postpone health care spending ( Stiglitz et al., 2009 ). Perhaps also individuals revise downward their expectations of their future incomes as a result of sudden shocks to economic uncertainty. According to Hamermesh and Soss's (1974) economic theory of suicide, suicide may involve a rational act where individuals are likely to commit suicide when their total remaining discounted lifetime utility, as a function of income, reaches zero.
Furthermore, the fact that extreme increases in economic uncertainty increase the propensity to commit suicide among males aged 25–64, while decreases in economic uncertainty – economic stability – does not improve their mental health, suggests that negative economic news is not the sole factor but rather the breaking point that triggers suicide acts. Individuals who attempt suicide typically have multiple suicide risk factors ( WHO, 2021 ). Shocks to economic uncertainty may precipitate suicide in individuals who are already worried about their financial position. This asymmetry finding, therefore, re-emphasizes Vandoros et al. ‘s (2019) interpretation of the immediacy of the effect of daily negative economic news on daily suicide deaths suggesting an impulsivity in suicide.
With respect to females, we observe a stark gender disparity in response to economic uncertainty. Females are perceived to be predominantly insulated from changes in economic uncertainty. However, females aged 65 plus are a notable exception. Our results suggest that they are particularly affected by absolute changes in economic uncertainty as well as extreme unexpected increases in economic uncertainty, suggesting that the relationship for females aged 65 plus is context dependent and exhibits a negativity bias. It is not unexpected that males in their mid and late careers are adversely affected by economic uncertainty given their high labour force participation , but the particular vulnerability for females aged 65 plus together with the absolute impact of changes in economic uncertainty on the suicide of males aged 65 plus is somewhat unexpected. We do not believe that anxiety regarding potential job destruction is the mechanism through which economic uncertainty impacts suicide of individuals aged 65 plus. In fact, the EPU index captures various economic and policy uncertainty-related aspects that go beyond the job market. Perhaps, the effect on older individuals is coming through shocks to economic and policy uncertainty that are particularly affecting older individuals, such as public pensions and health-related policies. For instance, research shows that austerity measures strongly impact suicide of older individuals ( Antonakakis, 2015 ). Future analysis can take advantage of the Categorical EPU index to gain insights on the category of news that particularly affect males and females aged 65 plus.
Notably, the negativity bias we find in the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship particularly relates to the literature examining the asymmetric response of suicide to its determinant that has been to date limited to unemployment ( Botha and Nguyen, 2022 ; Chang and Chen, 2017 ; Wu and Cheng, 2010 ), pushing against empirical models that implicitly assume the symmetric effect of economic conditions on suicide.
Lastly, a number of interesting findings emerge from the inclusion of changes in the unemployment rate in our models. First, the distinction between the impact of changes in economic uncertainty and changes in the unemployment rate suggests that the detected effect on suicide is most likely coming through economic anxiety rather than the actual job loss. Second, our findings suggest that, generally, unemployment does not significantly impact suicide. This finding is in line with the most recent studies using US data suggesting that the unemployment-suicide relationship is no longer present in recent years ( Abdou et al., 2020 ; DeFina and Hannon, 2015 ). A recurring interpretation of this finding is that the generosity of the unemployment insurance programs in the US affords protection and capacity to deal with job loss which in turn reduces its psychological toll. Nevertheless, a recent study examining the unemployment-suicide relationship in Australia provides evidence that losing one's job plays an important role in the suicide of males and females in Australia ( Botha and Nguyen, 2022 ). This, in turn, suggest that our findings are not generalizable to other countries. Third, while the effect of unemployment on suicide is absent, our results suggest that unexpected shocks to economic uncertainty are strongly associated with suicide. It is reasonable to think that if unemployment insurance programs, on the one hand, shield against the detrimental impact of unemployment on suicide, employment protection regulations on the other hand should shield against shocks from economic insecurity. In fact, Caroli and Godard (2016) suggest that workers' perception of job insecurity is likely to be higher in countries where employment protection legislation is less stringent. According to the OECD indicators of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) strictness and Unemployment Insurance Benefit (UIB) generosity, while the US is relatively generous in terms of UIB, it has the least strict employment protection regulations. This, in turn, provides some intuition as to why, while the effect of unemployment on suicide is absent, economic uncertainty impacts suicide. However, this is not the case in all countries. In 2019, the EPL index was 0.09 in the US, while the average across the OECD countries was 2.06. This again speaks against the generalizability of our findings.
The interpretation of our findings is nonetheless subject to limitations. First, as demonstrated by Engelberg and Parsons (2016) , measures of psychological health generally are themselves implicitly asymmetric. In the case of our research, the beneficial impact of decreases in economic uncertainty on psychological health is only captured in so far as suicide is reduced. Our analysis, therefore, does not provide information on the beneficial impact of decreases in economic uncertainty on the population's mental health. Secondly, it is important to note that suicide is a severe indicator of mental health deterioration. Economic uncertainty may result in less severe outcomes, such as self-harm and not necessarily completed suicide. Therefore, our analysis may underestimate the detrimental impact of shocks to economic insecurity on the psychological health of the population.

Section: 7. Conclusion and policy recommendations

The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship. Our analysis advances the literature on economic uncertainty and suicide in two ways. We show that the relationship between economic uncertainty and suicide is (i) context dependent and (ii) exhibits negativity bias. While we did not find population-wide evidence supporting the presence of negativity bias and context dependence in the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship, the evidence is limited to males aged 25–65 and females aged 65 plus, the findings of this study have important policy implications. As shown in Table 1 , the suicide rates of individuals aged 25 plus are higher than those of their younger counterparts. Particularly concerning, in recent years, suicide rates among individuals aged 25–44 have surpassed the suicide rates of older adults (65 plus). Thus, our results help us gain a better understanding of the economic uncertainty-suicide relationship of groups with potentially increased vulnerability to suicidal behaviour. In terms of policy recommendations, we suggest the following, firstly, the immediacy of the effect of economic uncertainty on the suicide of males aged 25–64 and females aged 65 plus suggests that anxiety concerning future economic status impact current mental health. Individuals follow economic news concerning the aggregate economy to make predictions about their personal future economic situation. This, in turn, calls for quick intervention and support for the most vulnerable individuals following negative economic news that promotes economic anxiety among the general population. Secondly, the negativity bias that exists in this relationship implies that the detrimental effect of increases in economic uncertainty on mental health are not reversible. That is, short-run decreases in economic uncertainty (economic stability) will not be powerful enough to eliminate the effect of prior increases in economic uncertainty on the mental health of the population. Hence, implementing policies aimed at promoting economic stability following large increases in economic uncertainty are, to a large extent, bound to fail. Thirdly, by providing empirical evidence in relation to the adverse psychological effect of extreme unexpected increases in economic uncertainty, our results offer insights to policymakers and employers alike into the potential psychological effect of major labour market disruptions. For instance, labour market policy changes, organizational downsizing, technology shocks – such as artificial intelligence and automation – can raise significant economic anxiety ( Pierce and Schott, 2020 ). Therefore, such labour market disruptions that precede large-scale layoffs should be accompanied by financial reassurance plans for potentially affected employees.
