Title: Time to retire? A register-based study of GPs’ practice style prior to retirement


Abstract: Abstract

In many healthcare systems a large share of general practitioners (GPs) is retiring. The literature has shown a negative correlation between physicians' age and their quality of care. However, little is known about whether GPs exhibit different practice styles in the years prior to retirement. This study investigates whether GPs who are closer to retirement make different professional choices than GPs who are not as close to retirement. Using detailed administrative data on 555 Danish GPs and their patients from 2005 to 2017, we study GPs' practice styles across a ten-year period prior to retirement and compare these with GPs who retire at a later date (‘non-retiring GPs’), while controlling for age differences as well as exogenous factors affecting healthcare provision. We focus on the GPs' number of enlisted patients, revenue, provision of consultations, and treatment behaviour in consultations. We find no differences between retiring and non-retiring GPs for key outcomes such as ‘revenue per patient’ and ‘consultations per patient’. However, we find that retiring GPs have fewer enlisted patients in their final years of practicing. This finding is driven by more patients leaving rather than fewer patients joining their lists. We also find that retirement is associated with other dimensions of GPs' practice style, e.g. their provision of home visits, prescribing, and referral rates. Overall, we find a modest association between GPs' retirement and their practice style.

Section: 1. Introduction

Many healthcare systems are dealing with an ageing workforce. The increasing number of general practitioners (GPs) approaching pensionable age is causing concern due to potential adverse effects on patients' access to healthcare ( Scott et al., 2006 ) and the quality of their care ( Zhang, 2018 ). In response to this concern many countries are attempting to retain retiring GPs ( Barriball et al., 2015 ). These efforts have only increased during the coronavirus pandemic, see for example Italy ( Paterlini, 2020 ), the UK ( Mahase, 2020 ) and the USA ( Glied and Levy, 2020 ). However, in the literature there has been little focus on GPs’ treatment behaviour in the years prior to retirement.
This study seeks to investigate if retiring GPs’ practice style differs from that of non-retiring GPs. As it is increasingly likely that patients receive treatment by a soon-to-retire GP, these results are important not only for efficiency and quality assurance , but also as a means of detecting inequalities in access to health care as the prevalence of retiring GPs is typically unevenly distributed across geographical areas ( Chevillard et al., 2019 ). In addition, studying which practice style can be expected from soon-to-retire GPs is pertinent for assessing expected outcomes of retainment policies.
Only a few quantitative studies have investigated how GPs choose to practice in the years prior to retirement ( Hedden et al., 2017 ; Joyce et al., 2015 ; Simkin et al., 2019 ). Overall, these studies conclude that retiring GPs reduce the amount of care provided. These studies do, however, not separate the impact of retirement from cohort effects and exogenous factors that may drive physicians' practice style. A number of studies have, however, studied the association between ageing and physician behaviour. Typically, these studies find a negative association between physicians’ age and their quality of care (see Choudhry et al. (2005) for a literature review). Recent studies also find that older GPs prescribe more antibiotics than younger GPs ( Silverman et al., 2017 ) and that patients who are under the care of older physicians in hospitals have higher mortality rates ( Tsugawa et al., 2017 ).
The observed ‘age effect’ is likely driven by both cohort effects and factors related to the retirement choice. Retirement may be driven by personal circumstances, experiences and/or changes in preferences. The underlying preferences that ultimately make GPs choose to retire may also differ across GPs who choose to retire earlier or later than others. A number of qualitative studies have investigated the specific factors that are associated with physician retirement. Silver et al. (2016) conducted a literature review on this topic and found that, in addition to age and health, more subjective factors such as workplace frustration, workload pressures, career dissatisfaction, and preferences for income and leisure were the major drivers of physicians' retirement decision. Lazear (1986) and Lumsdaine and Mitchell (1999) also found that preferences for both leisure and income change as individuals approach retirement, with leisure becoming increasingly valuable and the value of income falling. The literature has yet to uncover whether these underlying circumstances and preferences drive GPs' practice style up to the time of retirement.
This paper contributes to the literature by investigating variations in GPs' practice styles that are associated with being closer to retirement. We define the ‘retirement effect’ as the association between GPs' practice style and their years from retirement over and above a ‘cohort effect’ as well as exogenous factors affecting their provision of care, such as patients' preferences and needs, time trends, and access to secondary care. Hence, the ‘retirement effect’ captures the circumstances and preferences that drive both the retirement decision and possibly also GPs' behaviour in the time up to retirement (as described by Silver et al. (2016) , Lazear (1986) , and Lumsdaine and Mitchell (1999) ).
Using rich and high-quality administrative data, we provide evidence of a possible ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style. We make use of a balanced sample of Danish GPs over a ten-year period. We estimate the ‘retirement effect’ by comparing retiring GPs' practice style with that of non-retiring GPs while controlling for their own age (to control for cohort), their patient characteristics (to control for demand for care), the calendar year (to control for time trends), and their geographical area (to control for access to secondary care). The ‘retirement effect’ is thus the remaining variation in practice styles across retiring GPs and non-retiring GPs.
As a next step, we investigate whether GP characteristics drive the ‘retirement effect’ on practice style. Among these GP characteristics are their gender, number of children, marital status, previous family income (proxy for wealth), and health status . To further explore variation in care between retiring and non-retiring GPs, we also investigate whether the identified ‘retirement effect’ is driven by unobserved differences in the underlying circumstances and preferences across GPs who choose to retire early and late. Thus, we conduct a heterogeneity analysis by splitting our sample based on whether GPs choose to retire before or after the state pension age of 65 years.
Our results show evidence of a ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style. However, the effect appears to be modest as we see no differences between retiring and non-retiring GPs in key outcomes such as ‘generated revenue per patient’ and ‘the number of consultations per patient’. This overall finding is reassuring to policymakers who are facing an ageing GP workforce, they are seeking to retain. However, we do find a ‘retirement effect’ on some dimensions of GPs' practice style, such as their list size, provision of home visits, prescribing, and referrals. These findings are in some cases driven by GPs' choice of retirement age.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the institutional setting for Danish GPs. Section 3 presents our methods. Section 4 describes our data and inclusion criteria for the retiring and non-retiring GPs. Section 5 presents our results, which we discuss in section 6 . Section 7 concludes the paper.

Section: 2. The institutional setting

Our empirical analysis is based on data from Danish GPs. Denmark has a public health insurance system financed through general taxation. Thus, health care is free at the point of consumption. However, GPs act as gatekeepers to secondary care, implying that referrals are needed for patients to access most secondary care. Patients are enlisted with a specific general practice of their own choice as long as it is located within 15 km of their home (5 km in the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area) and has its list open for new patients. Patients can change their GP free of charge if they move more than the allowed distance from their current GP. However, if patients do not move area, they must pay an administrative fee (around €27) to change their GP. GPs themselves are unable to forcefully remove patients from their lists, unless patients have exhibited unacceptable behaviour.
In 2017 there were 3436 GPs in Denmark. The GPs are self-employed but working under a contract with the Danish Regions. They are remunerated through a mixture of fee-for-service and capitation, which make up approximately two-thirds and one-third of their income, respectively ( Forde et al., 2016 ). The GPs are operating in either a single-handed or partnership practice. Single-handed practices make up around 55% of the total number of general practices in Denmark ( Danish Ministry of Health, 2016 ), and are operated by around 30% of the GPs ( PLO, 2020 ). As GPs both own and work in their practices, it is uncommon for them to change practice affiliation.
The GPs set-up their individual private pension schemes and define the size of their contributions. There is no mandatory pension age, though the state pension age was 65 years during our analysis period ( OECD, 2015 ). In 2017 around 59% of the GPs were older than 50 years and around 11% of the GPs were older than 65 years ( PLO, 2020 ). Thus, it is likely that a large fraction of the GPs will retire in the years to come. The GPs are responsible for selling their own practice, which may be an extensive process. The maximum selling price (goodwill), a GP can receive, corresponds to their average revenue over the last three years plus 30%. Thus, Danish GPs in principle have a financial incentive to keep a high-activity level in the last years up to retirement. However, during our period of analysis this incentive is weak as the selling price for GPs was on average much lower than this maximum selling price, indicating that it is challenging finding a buyer ( PLO, 2019 ).

Section: 3. Methods

This section describes the methods we use to analyse the ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style. First, we present our measures of GPs' practice style. Second, we present our empirical strategy of how to estimate the ‘retirement effect’ on practice style. Third, we describe how we investigate the degree to which the ‘retirement effect’ is driven by observable GP characteristics as well as underlying circumstances and preferences related to early or late retirement.
Retiring GPs may change their practice style by changing the number of patients on their list. GPs' list size can only be reduced if more patients choose to leave the list relative to patients entering the lists. We therefore measure the number of enlisted patients as well as the number of patients leaving and joining the lists. The number of patients joining the list can be driven by GPs actively choosing to close their list, or patients choosing not to enter. As Danish GPs are not allowed to forcefully remove patients from their lists, patients will only leave the list at their own discretion. We focus on patients leaving the GP without changing residence, because this indicates an active choice of changing the GP (see section 2 ). The time at which patients leave retiring GPs is of interest. If patients leave just prior to the GPs’ retirement, it could be an indicator of patients being pro-active in choosing a new GP. If patients on the other hand choose to leave retiring GPs at earlier conveniences, quality and access issues are more likely the main drivers ( Nagraj et al., 2013 ).
Another way in which we may identify changes in retiring GPs' practice style is by observing their revenue per patient. On average around two-thirds of Danish GPs' revenue is generated by fee-for-services (see section 2 ). GPs receive a fee for consultations as well as for selected services within consultations. GPs who approach retirement may reduce their activity, e.g. due to fatigue, ill health or preferences for leisure, or on the other hand increase their activity levels to boost their revenue if they are e.g. seeking to obtain financial means to retire. We measure GPs’ revenue by the total amount of fee-for-services they generate per year.
One way in which GPs may change their activity level prior to retirement is by changing their provision of consultations. Face-to-face consultations, such as regular practice consultations and especially home visits, may be resource demanding. In fact, GPs have indicated that home visits impose a significant workload ( Theile et al., 2011 ) and typically GPs feel that they are insufficiently remunerated for these services ( Soh and Low, 2018 ). Retiring GPs may therefore seek to reduce the number of these consultations as they approach retirement. We therefore include as outcome measures both the GPs’ provision of regular practice consultations and their provision of home visits to their patients.
Retiring GPs may also alter their practice style in the consultation. If they wish to reduce their activity level, they may for example choose to refer patients more often instead of taking on the role as gatekeepers and discussing the need for referrals or treating the patients themselves. Thus, evidence exists of practices with a high workload referring more to secondary care (see O'Donnell (2000) for a literature review). However, a high referral rate may also indicate that the GPs are more aware of patients' needs for specialised care. We measure the GPs' rate of referrals to private practicing secondary care specialists per year. As the majority of these specialists (with the exception of podiatry and radiologists) receive a separate fee for patients' consultations related to a new referral, we use this fee to quantify the number of referrals.
GPs may also change their prescription patterns as they approach retirement. This change can be related to GPs being more aware of patients’ medical needs but may also reflect an attempt to reduce their workload. Previous work has found that practices with a high workload have higher prescription rates per patient ( Aabenhus et al., 2017 ; Cadieux et al., 2007 ). As Danish GPs issue almost 90% of prescription drugs purchased by patients ( Pottegård et al., 2021 ), we measure their prescribing behaviour by the costs of all patient purchased prescription drugs per year.
We wish to estimate the ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style. We define this effect as the association between GPs' practice style and their years from retirement over and above a ‘cohort effect’ as well as exogenous factors affecting their provision of care, such as patients' preferences and needs, time trends, and access to secondary care. Model 1 thus describes GP i 's practice style, y i t , in year t as: (1) ln ( y i t ) = β 1 yearfro m i t + β 2 a g e i t + β 3 pa t i t + β 4 ge o i + β 5 l i s t s i z e i t + T t + ε i t , where the GP's practice style, y i t , is measured as either their list size, total revenue, total number of consultations, and total treatments in consultations. Table 1 provides a detailed overview of these outcomes. We log the outcome variable such that we, independently of the chosen outcome, can interpret our estimates as percentage differences in practice style. This log-transformation also alleviates issues related to several of our outcomes being skewed to the right. As our practice style outcomes are reported at GP level, and therefore depend on the number of patients enlisted with a GP, we control for l i s t s i z e i t (with the exception of when the outcome itself is a measure of list size, i.e. l i s t s i z e i t , j o i n i t , l e a v e i t ).

The patient population (and list size) includes only patients at the age + 18 years. Differences between the retiring and non-retiring GPs are tested using t-tests. *p < 0.10, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01.
The vector yearfro m i t includes dummy variables indicating the number of years the retiring GP is from retirement. We observe the GPs for ten years up to retirement. We choose this long analysis period to uncover whether potential differences in practice styles between retiring and non-retiring GPs reflect changes in practice styles up to retirement or more permanent differences that may be driven by GP choice of retiring early or late. As GPs' exact retirement date is uncertain (see section 4 ), we disregard the GPs’ year of retirement in our analyses. Thus, the vector yearfro m i t includes dummy variables capturing year 10 to 1 before retirement. We set the reference category to be GPs who are not retiring during our analysis period.
We are interested in estimating GPs' behaviour as they near retirement while controlling for cohort effects, time trends, and exogenous factors. Model 1 therefore includes a control for GP's a g e i t . A number of exogenous factors may also drive GPs' practice style. Danish GPs cannot select their patients (see section 2 ), but their patient populations' preferences and need for care may affect their treatment patterns. We therefore control for the characteristics of their patient population using the vector pa t i t . The vector includes their patients' average age, gender, family status, socioeconomic status, health status , and country of origin. Table 1 provides a detailed overview of these covariates.
The practices' geographical location both in terms of region and degree of urbanisation may influence their patients' access to secondary care and thereby also their need for primary care . We therefore also include a vector of variables capturing geographical area, ge o i , which includes region dummies (baseline is The North Denmark Region) as well as an indicator of the location being urban (a city or town), where the baseline is a rural location as defined by Eurostat (see Albertone et al. (2018) ). We capture potential time trends in practice style by including the vector T t of calendar year dummies (baseline 2005). The term ε i t is the model's error term.
We estimate separate regressions for each of our practice style outcome variables. Our vector of estimates of interest is β ˆ 1 , which measures the association between GPs' practice style and their years from retirement over and above a ‘cohort effect’ as well as exogenous factors affecting their provision of care, such as patients' preferences and needs, time trends, and access to secondary care. If these estimates are statistically significantly different from zero, there exists a ‘retirement effect’.
As a next step, we investigate whether differences in GP characteristics (beyond age) may drive differences in practice style otherwise observed between retiring and non-retiring GPs. The purpose of this investigation is to uncover the extent to which observable GP characteristics drive the ‘retirement effect’. Model 2 thus expands model 1 with a number of GP characteristics: (2) ln ( y i t ) = γ 1 yearfro m i t + γ 2 a g e i t + γ 3 pa t i t + γ 4 ge o i + γ 5 l i s t s i z e i t + T t + γ 6 g p i t + ε i t , where g p i t is a vector of GP characteristics (beyond age) that the literature has shown to be associated with retirement. Among these characteristics are the GP's gender ( Schils, 2008 ), number of children (Maximiliane E. Szinovacz et al., 2001 ), marital status (Maximiliane E Szinovacz and DeViney, 2000 ), previously generated income (proxy for savings) ( De Preter et al., 2013 ), and their health status ( Christensen and Kallestrup-Lamb, 2012 ; Roberts et al., 2009 ). Table 1 provides the exact definitions of these variables. We determine whether GP characteristics drive the estimated ‘retirement effect’, γ ˆ 1 , by comparing the estimates' magnitude and statistical significance across model 1 and 2.
In addition to GP observable characteristics, the retirement age may also drive the estimated ‘retirement effect’. Whether GPs choose to retire early or late may reflect underlying circumstances and preferences which may drive practice style in the years up to retirement (beyond the observable characteristics already controlled for). As early or late retirees may represent two types of GPs with a different set of preferences, they may also more persistently differ in their practice style from GPs who do not retire in our study period. To explore the potential presence of such differences in preferences further, we conduct a heterogeneity analysis. We estimate both model 1 and model 2 using two different subsamples of retiring GPs, which we define by whether GPs choose to retire before or after the state pension age of 65 years. The comparison group (‘non-retiring GPs’) remains unchanged throughout all of our analyses.
We estimate both model 1 and model 2 using a balanced sample of GPs over a ten-year observation period. The choice of a balanced sample ensures stability in our practice style outcomes (as for example list size may be small for incoming GPs) across years. To obtain consistent estimates, we augment our models with the Mundlak correction terms, i.e. a vector of variables containing the means for GP i of all time-varying covariates (with the exception of yearfro m i t and T t ). Including these correction terms allows us to control for time-invariant patient and GP characteristics. We estimate the models using random effects with standard errors clustered at GP level. This approach corresponds to a Mundlak type correlated random effect model ( Mundlak, 1978 ). However, appendix A6 shows our results are robust to estimating the models without the time-averaged covariates using an OLS with standard errors clustered at GP level.
As our results are based on a balanced sample of GPs over a ten-year period, we are operating with a restrictive sample. To ensure that our results are not driven by this selection of GPs, we reduce our analysis period to only five years (see appendix A4). With the exception of the outcome ‘the number of patients joining the list per year’, our results are robust to reducing our analysis period. Thus, our findings for the key outcome ‘the number of patients on the list’ remains robust.

Section: 4. Data, sample, and analysis period

Our analysis is based on high-quality administrative data on Danish GPs and their patients (aged 18 and above). Approval for the use of this data was provided by the Danish Data Protection Agency (reference number 17/6021). Following the Danish Act on Research Ethics Review of Health Research Projects §14, section 2, informed consent was waived as data is from administrative registers.
We use the provider register to obtain detailed information on the GPs such as whether they are in a partnership or single-handed practices and their date of retirement. We identify GPs by their social security number being linked to a provider number. When GPs no longer appear in the provider register, we define them as retired. We only have access to complete information on GPs' social security number from 2015 to 2017. We therefore define retiring GPs as those who retire within 2015–2017, whereas non-retiring GPs are those who have not retired by the end of 2017. ‘Retired’ GPs may, however, continue to consult patients after selling their provider number, e.g. as a locum in another practice. As we are interested in the GPs' behaviour up to their retirement from being practice owners, it is outside the scope of this paper to analyse retiring GPs' practice styles after they have given up their provider numbers.
We use the National Health Service register to retrieve patient-level information on GPs' practice style, i.e. their provided services and obtained fees as well as referrals made to private practice specialists. We would like to observe the GPs' practice style over a long enough time period to capture behavioural differences between retiring and non-retiring GPs. We therefore choose to observe retiring GPs for ten years up to retirement. As GPs' exact retirement date is uncertain, we disregard the GPs’ year of retirement in our analyses. Thus, GPs retiring in 2015 enter our sample in 2005 and remain until 2014, whereas GPs retiring in 2017 (16) enter our sample in 2007 (06) and remain until 2016 (15).
We use the National Patient Register from 1996 to 2016 to obtain information about patients' and GPs' ICD 10 codes at hospitals. We use these codes to calculate the Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Charlson et al., 1987 ; Thygesen et al., 2011 ). We obtain information on patients' purchase of prescription drugs at pharmacies from the Danish Drug Database. We retrieve both GPs' and their patients' socioeconomic information from Statistics Denmark's income register (IND), education register (FAIK), family register (FAM), population register (BEF), and employment register (DREAM).
We have seven exclusion criteria for GPs in our dataset. First, as we are unable to identify which GP provides which service in partnership practices, we focus on single-handed GPs. Second, to ensure a balanced panel, GPs are excluded if they change practice or are affiliated to multiple practices during the analysis period. Third, GPs should be active throughout our analysis period. We define GPs as being active if they have billed at least one service per year continuously throughout our analysis period. Fourth, though being defined as a solo practice in the registers, practices are excluded if they have had multiple owners in at least one year in the analyses period, as we cannot link services provided to the specific GP. Fifth, retiring due to acute and/or severe illness or a wish for a career change do not reflect a ‘typical’ retirement decision. To minimise the number of these more ‘acute’ retirement decisions, we only include GPs who retire above the age of 60, which marks when individuals could access their private pensions. This cut-off follows other studies based on a Danish setting (see e.g. Chetty et al. (2014) ). Sixth, GPs are excluded if they have less than 500 patients on their lists. This criterion ensures focusing on GPs working full time. A similar cut-off has been used in other studies (see e.g. Olsen and Laudicella (2019) ). Seventh, GPs must have a social security number registered in the provider register such that we can link to other registers with information on their personal characteristics. Appendix A1 shows the number of GPs excluded as a consequence of each criterion. Our final sample consists of 555 single-handed practices with 398 non-retiring GPs and 157 retiring GPs.

Section: 5. Results

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the covariates and outcomes for both the retiring GPs and the non-retiring GPs. The descriptive statistics are based on averages at practice level across our analysis period 2005 to 2016. As expected, the retiring GPs are older than the non-retiring GPs (6.4 years) and are in a slightly worse health state (0.11 points on the Charlson Comorbidity Index). There are also some small differences in the characteristics of patients enlisted with the retiring versus the non-retiring GPs as well as differences in their practice styles. Appendix 2 reports similar descriptive statistics for retiring GPs split by their retirement age.
We wish to estimate a potential ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style. We measure GPs' practice style by the number of patients on their list, their revenue, their provision of consultations, and their treatments within consultations. Table 2 reports the estimated ‘retirement effect’ on each of these outcomes in the ten years prior to retirement (model 1).

Our results show a negative, but statistically insignificant, association between retirement and ‘revenue generated per patient’. For the outcome ‘the number of consultations provided per patient’ we also find a statistically insignificant association with retirement. We therefore conclude that for these two key practice style outcomes there does not exist a ‘retirement effect’. However, we observe statistically significant associations with retirement for other dimensions of GPs' practice style. Already 5–6 years prior to retirement, the average number of enlisted patients is 4 percent lower for retiring GPs compared to non-retiring GPs. This difference is even larger (8–11 percent) in the final years of practicing. The smaller list size is primarily driven by more patients leaving the retiring GPs rather than fewer patients joining their list. For example, the last year before retirement the average number of patients leaving is around 2.5 times larger than for non-retiring GPs, whereas the number of patients joining is 13% less. We also find that retiring GPs on average provide fewer home visits per patient (16–20 percent) and prescribe fewer drugs per patient (3–4 percent) in the last couple of years prior to retirement. As stated in section 3.1 , the fewer home visits indicate that retiring GPs reduce their workload, whereas the interpretation of the fewer prescribed drugs is unclear. Interestingly, there appears to be a persistent ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' referral rates per patient. Across our ten-year observation period, retiring GPs refer around 6–9 percent more patients to private practice specialists compared to non-retiring GPs.
As a next step, we investigate whether GP characteristics drive the ‘retirement effect’ on practice style. First, we expand our model with observable GP characteristics that may drive the differences in practice style between retiring and non-retiring GPs (model 2). Among the GP characteristics are their gender, their number of children, marital status, previously generated income (proxy for savings), and their health status. Second, we conduct a heterogeneity analysis to verify whether the ‘retirement effect’ is driven by GPs' choice of whether to retire early or later. We therefore present results from model 1 and 2 for two different samples of retiring GPs split by the retirement age of 65 years (the state pension age). Sections 1 Introduction , 2 The institutional setting , 3 Methods , 4 Data, sample, and analysis period , 5 Results present our results from these analyses. As we focus on drivers of the ‘retirement effect’, we do not describe our results for outcomes in which we find no ‘retirement effect’, i.e. ‘revenue’ and ‘number of consultations’. However, appendix A3 reports the results from these analyses for all practice style outcomes.
Supplementary table 2 in appendix A3 shows the estimates for the association between GPs' years from retirement and the number of patients enlisted with a GP. As the magnitudes and statistical significances of these estimates are similar across our models, we find that the ‘retirement effect’ on list size (model 1) is not driven by our observable GP characteristics (model 2). We do, however, find differences in the ‘retirement effect’ for this outcome across early and late retirees. Across our ten-year observation period, the early retirees on average have 4–11 percent fewer patients on their lists compared to non-retiring GPs. The late retirees, however, only experience a smaller list size (5–10 percent) compared to non-retiring GPs in the final three years of practicing. Across early and late retirees, the smaller list size in the final years of retirement is primarily driven by patients' leaving the GPs' list. However, both the early and late retirees also experience fewer patients joining their list especially in the final years of practicing.
Supplementary table 4 in appendix A3 shows the estimates for the association between GPs' years from retirement and the number of home visits per patient. As the magnitudes and statistical significances of these estimates are similar across our models, we find that the identified ‘retirement effect’ on home visits (in model 1) is not driven by observable GP characteristics (in model 2). However, when we split our sample based on GPs' chosen age of retirement, we gain a better understanding of the drivers of this effect. We find that the ‘retirement effect’ is only present for late retirees. In the final three years of practicing they provide 20–26 percent fewer home visits per patient than non-retiring GPs. As non-retiring GPs on average provide 125.8 home visits per year (see Table 1 ), the sizes of these estimates do not reflect a large difference in the number of home visits provided per patient.
Supplementary table 5 in appendix A3 shows the estimated associations between the years from retirement and the drug costs and referrals per patient. We identified a small but statistically significant ‘retirement effect’ on drug costs in the final years of practicing (model 1). As the magnitudes and statistical significances of these estimates are similar across our models, the ‘retirement effect’ is not driven by the observed GP characteristics, which we include in model 2. However, it appears that the ‘retirement effect’ on drug costs is mainly driven by the early retirees. The early retirees have 4–5 percent lower drug costs per patient than non-retirees in the eight years prior to retirement. We also identified a ‘retirement effect’ on referrals to private practice specialists. This association is on the other hand primarily driven by the late retirees. Throughout our ten-year observation period late retirees provide on average 7–10 percent more referrals per patient than non-retirees.

Section: 6. Discussion

As many countries are seeking to retain retiring GPs to combat staffing shortages, retirement of GPs remains an important policy question. Identification of a ‘retirement effect’ on practice style is also highly policy relevant as it creates valuable information about efficiency, quality assurance , and inequalities in access to health care . As a ‘retirement effect’ is potentially amenable to policy initiatives, it is also pertinent information for assessing expected outcomes of retainment policies.
The literature is scarce in terms of investigating whether retiring GPs have different practice styles than other GPs. Our study offers a unique contribution to the literature as we estimate the association between GPs' practice style and their years from retirement over and above a ‘cohort effect’ as well as exogenous factors affecting their provision of care, such as patients' preferences and needs, time trends, and access to secondary care. Hence, the identified ‘retirement effect’ captures preferences that drive both the retirement decision and possibly also GPs' behaviour in the time up to retirement. To assess whether GP characteristics drive the association between the ‘retirement effect’ and practice style, we include controls for a number of GP characteristics (beyond age) related to their preferences for delivering care.
We find evidence of a ‘retirement effect’ on several dimensions of GPs' practice styles. We find that retiring GPs have fewer patients on their lists in the years prior to retirement than non-retiring GPs. This difference is primarily driven by patients choosing to leave the retiring GPs' practices. Our finding is in line with previous studies showing that GPs reduce their activity as they approach retirement ( Hedden et al., 2017 ; Joyce et al., 2015 ; Simkin et al., 2019 ). Interestingly, the ‘retirement effect’ on list size is not driven by observable GP characteristics, such as their gender, number of children, marital status, previously generated income, and health status. We do, however, find that early retirees have a relatively smaller list size across our entire analysis period, whereas the late retirees only experience a smaller list size in the final years of practicing. This finding may indicate that early retirees are different types of GPs in terms of preferences for workload. We also observe that late retirees provide fewer home visits compared to non-retiring GPs up to three years before retirement. As home visits are an infrequent service, the observed differences are small in magnitude.
The ‘retirement effect’ appears to be more persistent on the late retirees' referrals to private practice specialists. We find that these GPs refer more to other specialists than non-retirees across our ten-year observation period, which indicates that they in general have a different referral pattern. It is unclear whether we should interpret this result as late retirees exerting more or less effort into their consultations (see section 3.1.4). It should here be noted that GPs of old age are less prevalent among non-retiring GPs. As we observe consistent differences across our non-retirees and our late retirees throughout our study period, we cannot exclude the possibility that a cohort effect is imperfectly separated from the ‘retirement effect’ and thereby (partly) driving our results. Thus, more work is needed to confirm our results and to uncover the underlying mechanisms at play for the late retirees' referral decisions.
We also find that early retirees' practice style differs from that of non-retirees within consultations. We find that patients enlisted with early retirees have lower drug costs for several years up to GPs’ retirement. It is unclear whether this finding is an indication of the early retirees exerting more or less effort into their consultations (see section 3.1.4). Previous qualitative work has, however, indicated that workload and job dissatisfaction may be drivers to earlier retirement ( Sansom et al., 2016 ). More work is needed to understand if these underlying factors may also explain prescription patterns in the years up to retirement.
Even though we identify a ‘retirement effect’ on several practice style outcomes, the associations are modest and not present for key outcomes such as ‘the generated revenue per patient’ and ‘the number of consultations provided’. This overall finding is reassuring to policymakers who are facing an ageing GP workforce that they are seeking to retain. However, we do find a ‘retirement effect’ on some dimensions of GPs' practice style, such as their list size, provision of home visits, prescribing, and referrals. From a policy perspective it is especially interesting that early retirees seem to have a smaller list size throughout our ten-year analysis period. This finding indicates that retaining these types of GPs who (plan to) retire early may not lead to as large increases in capacity of care as if other types of GPs were retained. Across practice style outcomes where we find a ‘retirement effect’ further research is needed to understand whether this variation indicates quality or access issues, and thus whether policy initiatives are needed to combat these differences in care. However, as our study finds only modest differences in practice style across retiring and non-retiring GPs, we conclude that the need for such policy initiatives appears to be limited. The implications of retaining otherwise retiring GPs should therefore be of less concern to policymakers.
There may be several explanations for why our estimated ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style is reasonably modest. First, GPs are altruistic meaning that they care about the health of their patients. Therefore, GPs would be unlikely to engage in activities which may harm their patients ( Di Guida et al., 2019 ). Second, as countries, such as Denmark, are experiencing an undersupply of GPs ( Beech et al., 2019 ), GPs are under pressure to continue working due to their commitment to care for their patients until replacements can be found. Therefore, GPs may have a limited ability to alter their behaviour as they approach retirement. Third, in the present study we focus on single-handed GPs. Though these GPs make up a large percentage of the total GP population in Denmark (see section 2 ), they may behave differently compared to GPs in partnership practices. As these GPs are the sole providers of care in their practices, they have a special duty to provide continuous high-quality care to their patients. GPs in partnership practices may thus have more of an ability to reduce activity as they may be able to rely on help from non-retiring GPs. In that case our estimated ‘retirement effect’ is likely conservative compared to what we would observe in partnership practices.
There may also be context specific factors affecting retiring GPs' behaviour. Danish GPs' maximum selling price (goodwill) of their practice is a function of their revenue the last three years prior to retiring (see section 2 ). Thus, in theory, they have an extra financial incentive to maintain or even increase their revenues. However, as the average selling price of general practices has been falling drastically since 2000, leading to a severe weakening of the financial incentive ( PLO, 2017 ), we believe it is unlikely that this incentive has played a role in the GPs' retirement decision and their behaviour in the years up to retirement. If their goodwill did play a role, our estimates are conservative estimates of the true ‘retirement effect’. Also, Danish GPs are primarily remunerated through fee-for-services. This type of remuneration provides a financial incentive to maintain a high activity level in the years up to retirement. Our results may therefore not hold when GPs are paid by other payment schemes. Therefore, more work should be done to investigate the ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style in other settings than the Danish.
Our study also faces a number of limitations related to both our methodology and data, which may also contribute to our modest findings. We estimate the ‘retirement effect’ by comparing the practice style of retiring GPs with that of GPs who will, at some point, retire after our observation period. As indicated by the relatively small age difference across the retiring and non-retiring GPs (6.4 years) a significant share of the non-retiring GPs may also be nearing retirement. By comparing our retirees with other soon-to-retire GPs, we obtain a conservative estimate of the true ‘retirement effect’. Meanwhile, this approach also has the benefit of enabling us to control for potential cohort effects. In this regard, we are challenged by only a limited number of non-retiring GPs being of the same ‘old’ age as the late retirees. Thus, it is possible that the cohort effect for these retirees is not perfectly separated from the ‘retirement effect’ on GPs' practice style.
Our choice of practice style outcomes is limited by the content of our administrative registers. We can therefore not capture all clinically relevant behaviour retirees exhibit or measure the quality of their care. For example, one can imagine that retirees may find it too costly to keep up to date with new technology and treatments, which may reduce their quality of care. Another factor worth investigating is GPs' contribution to the profession in terms of mentoring and training other GPs. An avenue for future research is therefore to investigate a potential ‘retirement effect’ on these types of outcomes.
Lastly, we should mention that the administrative registers do not include a precise measure of GPs' and their patients' health statuses. Similar to other studies (e.g. Smith et al. (2014) ), we make use of the Charlson Comorbidity Index as a proxy for individuals' health status. Using such an index has its limitation. The Charlson Comorbidity Index predicts mortality rather than quality of life . Thus, the index does not capture potential heterogeneity in how a given illness affects patients’ current health states. Additionally, as the index is based on administratively recorded diagnoses of selected illnesses, it does not capture all health conditions, just as it is limited by the health care providers registration practices.

Section: 7. Conclusion

This study finds evidence of an association between GPs' practice style and their years from retirement over and above a ‘cohort effect’ as well as exogenous factors affecting their provision of care, such as patients' preferences and needs, time trends, and access to secondary care. We find that GPs have fewer patients on their list in the years prior to retirement. This finding is primarily due to patients leaving their list. We also find that the late retirees provide relatively fewer home visits and more often refer patients to other specialists than non-retirees. The early retirees on the other hand seem to prescribe less medications (lower drug costs) to patients prior to retirement. However, key outcomes such as revenue and number of regular practice consultations per patient do not differ between retiring and non-retiring GPs. We therefore conclude that there is modest evidence of a ‘retirement effect’ related to GPs' practice style. The need for policy initiatives to combat these differences in practice styles therefore appears to be limited. However, policymakers should be careful generalising our findings to settings where GPs' market conditions are markedly different than in Denmark.
