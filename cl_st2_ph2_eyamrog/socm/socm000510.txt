Title: Policy of free GP care for children under 6 years: The impact on daytime and out-of-hours general practice


Abstract: Abstract

Ireland does not yet have a comprehensive system of universal access to primary care . In 2015, access to general practitioner (GP) care at no charge was introduced for the 70% of children aged under six who previously paid out-of-pocket fees. This study uses data from 16 practices and a regional out-of-hours (OOH) GP service to assess the impact of this policy on attendance.
A difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis was applied to visit records of paediatric patients over a period of five years, two years of which were pre-policy, with treatment and control differentiated by age.
Attendance at daytime GP by children aged under-six increased by 20%–21% in the three years following the introduction of the policy, largely explained by an increase in the number of patients attending (17.4%–18.6%). Of children aged under-six attending pre-policy, 14.9%–15.8% had >6 visits annually, increasing to 18.5%–20.3% post-policy. OOH GP attendance also increased by 20.5%–29.4% over the same period.
Findings are consistent with international literature on the provision of financially accessible healthcare. Prior unmet need, the provision of additional assessments to children aged under six, parental response to a service at no charge, and rerouting of access to the ED through GP, are all possible contributors to this increased demand. A more integrated policy of boosting supply as well as demand is desirable, particularly in the context of future expansion plans, to ensure the health benefits anticipated from the introduction of this policy have every opportunity to be realised.

Section: 1. Introduction

Access to primary care is associated with lower mortality and morbidity and is essential to reducing health disparities and ensuring health equity ( Cecil et al., 2016 ; Currie et al., 2008 ; Starfield et al., 2005 ). Over the last decade, policy makers have focused on the delivery of universal health coverage (UHC), which ensures affordable, effective access to healthcare for all to improve health and wellbeing ( Das et al., 2018 ; Jha et al., 2016 ). Widening access to healthcare for low-income families through public insurance such as Medicaid in the US has resulted in beneficial effects on health outcomes for children, including improving mortality and later life outcomes ( Currie et al., 2008 ). General practitioners (GPs) are an essential component in the delivery of primary care within the community, both in and out of normal working hours. Accessible GP care plays an important role within health systems and is associated with lower emergency department (ED) utilization, and fewer unplanned and ambulatory care sensitive hospital admissions in children ( Cecil et al., 2016 ).
Ireland is an outlier in Europe as the only EU country without free or nearly free access to GP care ( Thomson, 2014 ). As of 2017, 43% of the Irish population qualified for free access to GP care ( Department of Health, 2019 ) as holders of either a medical card issued under the General Medical Scheme (GMS) (33%) or GP visit (10%) card, with the remainder paying an average of €51 per visit to their GP ( The Competition Authority, 2010 ) or an out-of-hours (OOH) GP service. The medical card entitles individuals with income below a threshold or with specified illnesses to publicly funded hospital care, primary care access at no charge including GP visits, medication at a nominal cost, as well other services, while a GP visit card, also granted on an income basis with a threshold above that of the GMS scheme, provides access at no charge to GP care. Previous research has identified that GP consultation charges in Ireland act as a deterrent to seeking healthcare. Amongst paying patients, the poorest and those with the worst health were most likely to defer attending their GP ( O'Reilly et al., 2007 ). A nationally representative survey found that one in three respondents had previously decided not to attend their GP due to the cost ( O'Dowd et al., 2017 ).
Reforms to the financing of healthcare with the intention of moving towards UHC were proposed in 2011, with commitments to extend free at-the-point-of-delivery GP care to all. Children under six and those aged over 70 were the first to benefit from this reform in July 2015, and entitlements are expected to be expanded on a phased basis ( Collins and Homeniuk, 2021 ; Nolan and Layte, 2017 ). At a policy level, all-party commitment to UHC was achieved with the publication of Sláintecare in 2017 ( Houses of the Oireachtas, 2019 ). This was the first time there had been cross-party political consensus on major health reform in Ireland. Sláintecare sets out a policy roadmap to deliver whole system reform and UHC, phased over a ten-year period ( Burke et al., 2018 ).
This study assesses how the introduction of free GP care for children aged under six in July 2015 impacted attendance at daytime and OOH GP. The under-six GP visit card entitles the holder to care at a GP practice by a GP or a practice nurse without charge. Such care includes blood tests carried out to diagnose or monitor a condition, health assessments at ages two and five, care for children with asthma, and OOH urgent GP care ( Health Service Executive, 2014 ). It does not, however, entitle the holder to other primary care services such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy without charge. Early childhood vaccinations are provided free to all children in Ireland and are generally administered at GP practices by a GP or practice nurse.
GPs in Ireland are self-employed and are reimbursed for treating medical and GP visit card patients through an annual capitation payment, and reimbursement for the under-six scheme is at an annual rate of €125 per registered patient plus additional payments for asthma care and special services ( Health Service Executive, 2014 ). While no central register of GPs currently exists in Ireland, estimates suggest between 3500 and 4800 GPs carry out 21.4 million daytime consultations in Ireland per year, with a further 7.7 million consultations conducted by practice nurses ( Collins and Homeniuk, 2021 ). GPs holding a GMS contract are contracted to make suitable arrangements to enable contact outside of normal hours for urgent cases ( Health Service Executive, 2014 ). OOH GP services in Ireland are generally provided by a regional co-operative of GPs, providing urgent care by a GP from 6pm to 8am during the week and 24 h at weekends and holidays ( Health Service Executive, 2010 ). OOH services provided an estimated 1.12m visits in 2019 ( Health Service Executive, 2020 ). GPs with GMS patients must work their assigned cooperative shifts or pay fees to ensure their patients have the contracted access to a doctor. There are 15 OOH services throughout the country and the Health Service Executive funds the infrastructure, drivers for home-based consultations and call-takers ( Health Service Executive - Primary Care Reimbursement Service, 2020 ). GPs who look after patients with GMS entitlement receive an OOH supplement of €3.64 per patient per annum, however this does not apply to patients with an under-six GP visit card ( Health Service Executive, 2020 ). Many OOH services, including the OOH service in this study, operate a nurse-led telephone triage with patients initially screened and provided with advice, and those in need of a GP consultation provided with an appointment.
There is currently an undersupply of GPs practicing in Ireland, and demand is projected to increase substantially over the coming years ( McGovern and Morris, 2015 ). Consequently, the introduction of free GP care for children under six raised concerns that reducing cost would result in higher utilization of GP services. Evidence from other countries following the expansion of health insurance for children supported this expectation. The expansion of Medicaid in the US led to increased use of medical care ( Howell and Kenney, 2012 ), and the introduction of health insurance programmes for children in a number of low- and middle-income countries has also increased utilization ( Mitra et al., 2017 ). In Ireland, studies have highlighted the significantly higher average rates of attendance at GP for those eligible for free access (based on low income or specified health condition) compared to private patients ( Behan et al., 2014 ; Nolan and Layte, 2017 ; O'Regan et al., 2018 ).
This study makes a significant contribution to the assessment of the impact of the policy of free GP care on attendance through extending assessment to a period of three years following its introduction. Furthermore, using visit records of all children aged 12 and under attending a sample of 16 GP practices in 12 counties and a regional OOH service operating across six counties, this study builds on the local analysis carried out by O'Callaghan et al. (2018) . Utilising data from eight practices and an OOH service in North Dublin and comparing attendance by children aged under six in the year pre-policy with the first year post-policy, O'Callaghan et al. (2018) found GP consultations by children under six increased by 28.7% during normal working hours, and by 25.7% at the OOH service. Using longitudinal data from Growing Up in Ireland, Nolan and Layte (2017) applied difference-in-difference propensity score matching and estimated that gaining free access to GP care increased attendance for children aged three years of age by 25%. This study is the first to apply difference-in-difference (DiD) estimation to a nationwide sample of GP practices and a regional OOH service over a period of five years to estimate the effect of the introduction of free GP care for children aged under six on temporal trends of GP utilization.

Section: 2. Methods

This study uses data from 16 GP practices located across 12 of the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland and a large OOH GP service operating in the South-East of Ireland ( Fig. 1 ) to assess the impact of the provision of GP care at no charge to children aged under six on GP attendance ( McAuliffe et al., 2020 ).

Counties in which participating GP practices are located (Panel A) and counties in which study OOH service operated (Panel B).
A stratified sampling framework was adopted, with the aim of recruiting at least one practice from each county in Ireland, and additional practices from the more populated counties. Participation was restricted to practices using the Socrates™ practice management system, which is used by approximately 50% of GPs in Ireland, and data were extracted via an extraction report designed by the research team and software specialists at Clanwilliam Health responsible for supporting Socrates™. Recruitment began with the selection of 87 practices from the UCD School of Medicine Academic Network, with six additional practices approached later in the recruitment process to augment the sample. Of the 93 practices invited to participate, 39 agreed, with most of those declining doing so as they did not use Socrates™. However, the onset of COVID-19 had a significant impact on the data collection process due to the pivotal role played by GPs throughout the pandemic in Ireland, which resulted in a shift in both the workload and priorities of GPs. Consequently, despite repeated reminders, of the 39 practices who agreed to participate, only 17 provided data. One of these practices did not use Socrates™ during the pre-policy period and was therefore excluded from the analysis. The remaining 16 practices collectively had an estimated 95,000 registered patients.
Anonymised retrospective visit records of children aged 12 and under were extracted, including visit date, gender, year of birth, medical/GP visit card status, and an anonymised patient identifier connecting visits at each GP for each patient. Visits were defined as consultations conducted by a GP or practice nurse. Data on diagnosis and medication prescribed were also collected, however the extent of missing data meant this data could not be reliably used. Due to increased measures to protect patient anonymity (General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and Ireland’s Health Research Regulations 2018), date and month of birth could not be extracted, with year of birth used to approximate age when attending. A practice profile questionnaire was also completed, providing information such as the number and type of healthcare professionals working at the practice, practice size, waiting list and appointment policy, and accessibility of the local OOH service and nearest ED . Full details of the data extraction process, including a table of variables extracted and the practice profile questionnaire, are available in the online appendix.
Similar data were also extracted from the OOH service which, over the five-year study period, provided urgent OOH GP access from 6pm to 8am on weekdays and 24 h on weekends and bank holidays at 12 centres for an estimated population of 0.7 million. Unlike the daytime GP service, consultations at this OOH service were conducted by GPs only, with a nurse-led telephone triage screening patients for those requiring an urgent consultation. Consultations were generally conducted at OOH centres, though GPs also conducted house calls where necessary. The OOH dataset included an additional variable not available from the daytime GP dataset indicating whether the patient was referred to the ED following the consultation. Also, given the larger catchment area for the OOH service, month of birth in addition to year of birth could be extracted without risk of identifying a patient, allowing a more precise estimate of age when attending. Unlike the daytime GP dataset, the OOH dataset did not include a patient identifier so visits could not be connected for each patient, nor did it include diagnosis or medication prescribed. A table of variables extracted from the OOH service is available in the online appendix.
The population of children aged under six decreased nationally over the five years of this study period and the population of the comparison cohort, children aged six to 12, increased year-on-year. Therefore, adjustment to cater for these age trends was needed. This analysis presents adjusted aggregate estimates indexed by the local trend in population from the pre-policy year (2014/15) based on Ireland’s 2016 Census, with movements in population for the post-census periods based on local area changes in births (see online appendix for further details).
The difference-in-difference (DiD) quasi-experimental design makes use of longitudinal data to obtain a relevant counterfactual to estimate a causal effect by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a population that is enrolled in a programme (children aged under six) and a population that is not (children aged six to 12) ( Angrist and Pischke, 2008 ). DiD removes biases that could result from permanent unobserved differences between both groups, and from comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the result of trends due to other causes of the outcome ( Angrist and Pischke, 2008 ).
The impact of the policy on visits is assessed using the following model: Eq (1) Σ V a m p = b 0 + b 1 Under 6 + b 2 Year + b 3 U n d e r 6 * Year + b 4 M a l e a m p + b 5 Month + b 6 Practice + U a m p where V is visits per single year of age (SYOA) per month for each practice. Under6 is a binary indicator of an age group under six, with children aged six to 12 as the control. Year indicates each of the five years in the study, with T-1 (2014/15), the pre-policy year, as the reference category. The coefficient b 2 captures time trends common to both treatment and comparison groups. The b 3 parameter measures the effect of the policy for each of the three years following introduction of the policy and is estimated using ordinary least squares regression. The proportion of visits by male patients is captured by b 4 . Calendar month ( Month ) captures fixed effects for seasonality and U is the error term. The model also includes practice or centre level fixed effects ( b 6 ) and is estimated for both attendance at daytime GP and OOH. A similar estimation is carried out to quantify the policy effect on the number of patients attending daytime GP. As the policy assignment is based on time, standard errors are clustered at month-level, with 60 clusters. Estimation is also carried out at under-six level i.e. without consolidating visits at SYOA, to ensure consistency.
The introduction of this policy may have altered ED referral practices of GPs. While the daytime GP dataset does not include an indicator for consultations that concluded in an ED referral, the OOH dataset does. A linear probability model (OLS) was estimated at the individual level to assess the marginal effect of the policy on ED referrals from OOH: Eq (2) y i = b 0 + b 1 Under 6 + b 2 Year + b 3 Under 6 ⋅ Year + b 4 M a l e i + b 5 M o n t h + b 6 C e n t r e + U i where y i is the probability of the visit by individual i concluding in an ED referral. Standard errors are clustered at centre-level to capture the possible non-independence of observations within centres. Due to the small number of clusters (12 centres) and the chance of erroneously small standard errors ( Cameron and Miller, 2015 ), we use the Moulton correction to adjust standard errors ( Moulton, 1986 ).
DiD estimation is dependent on the assumption that the two groups would have evolved over time at the same rate in the absence of the intervention, known as the common trend assumption. This assumption is untestable, as the counterfactual is not observed. However, by examining pre-intervention trends using a number of methods, we assess if this assumption is reasonable. Firstly, each model includes the estimated “policy-effect” for the two pre-policy periods, with year one (T-2) interacted with Under6 (placebo effect). A significant effect between year one (T-2) and year two (T-1) would suggest that the pre-treatment time trends for both groups were not comparable. Secondly, a DiD model is estimated with both T-2 and the combined 24-month pre-policy period as the baseline, allowing the consistency of estimated results to be assessed. Finally, the trend in outcomes over time for both cohorts are assessed graphically.

Section: 3. Results

The impact of the introduction of this policy on both the number of visits and patients attending daytime GP, and on the number of visits to the OOH service and the proportion of visits referred to the ED from OOH was assessed. Visit is defined as a consultation, with all consultations at the OOHs service conducted by a GP, while a consultation at daytime GP may be conducted by a GP or practice nurse.
The mean number of full-time equivalent GPs per practice in our sample was 2.4, with 39 FTE GPs in the overall sample. All practices had a practice nurse, with approximately 17.2% of consultations recorded as being conducted by a practice nurse. The estimated mean practice size was 5800 patients. GPs were asked to rate accessibility to the local OOH and ED on a scale of one to five, with five representing very accessible. Mean accessibility to OOH was 4.25 and to the nearest ED was 3.9. Many practices had some level of waitlist for new patients (50%), and while all practices offered same-day appointments for urgent cases and 31.5% offered daily walk-in appointments, 63% of practices could not offer same-day routine appointments. The absence of a central register of GPs in Ireland makes it challenging to compare the profile of participating practices with the national profile. Online appendix Table A.4 compares some characteristics of the practices in our sample with those included in two larger studies ( Collins and Homeniuk, 2021 ; Smith et al., 2019 ).
Table 1 details key statistics on attendance by children aged 12 and under over the five years of this study at the participating 16 practices. As the policy was introduced on 1 July 2015, each of the five years run from 1 July to 30 June, with two years pre- and three years post-policy. Table 1 .

In 2014/15 (T-1), 67.5% of visits by children aged 12 and under were by patients aged five and under, 42.4% of whom had free access through either a medical or GP visit card. In 2015/16 (T1), following the introduction of the policy, 69% of visits were by this younger cohort, with 80.2% having free access. As we do not have the date or month of birth, visits by those turning six are separately presented, and comprise 5.6% of the sample in T-1, with 57.3% of visit by patients with free access. This increased to 5.8% in T1, with 80% having free access. Across all time periods and ages, boys visited more than girls (51%–51.7%), reflective of the national gender profile for children per Census 2016 (boys 51.5%, girls 48.5%).
Table 2 details the impact of the policy on the number of visits per month by SYOA by children aged under six versus those aged over six. This analysis excludes children in the year they turn six as their eligibility is unclear. Table 2 . Effect of free GP care for Under 6s on monthly attendance at daytime general practice.

Estimates are for SYOA and are adjusted for local population movements. Eligibility for Under-6 scheme defined by age. Month and date of birth not available. Therefore, children turning 6 are excluded as it is not known when they are eligible/ineligible for free GP care.
The overall policy effect in the two years following the introduction of the policy (T1& T2) was an additional 3.6 visits (21% increase) per month per practice for each SYOA under six. This effect remained consistent in T3, with an additional 3.4 visits (20% increase). The number of children under six seen each month increased by 2.5 per SYOA (18.3%) in T1, 2.6 (18.6%) in T2 and 2.4 (17.4%) in T3. Therefore, much of the increased attendance (approximately 70%) related to additional patients attending, most of whom were existing rather than newly registered patients ( Fig. 3 ). Patients were also, on average, attending more often ( Fig. 2 ), with a statistically significant increase in the proportion of attending patients with >6 visits per annum (T-2: 14.9%; T-1: 15.8%; T1: 20.3%; T2: 19.2%; T3: 18.5%).

Table 3 details key statistics on attendance by children aged 12 and under during the five years of this study. 23.1% of telephone calls to OOH in relation to children aged 12 and under in T-1 concluded with telephone advice, usually provided by a nurse. The absolute number of calls resolved by phone in T1 was in-line with prior year, but both the number and proportion dropped in T2 and T3. In T1, following the introduction of the policy, 71.2% of consultations for children aged 12 and under were for children aged under six, 92.4% of whom had free access. Across all time periods and ages, boys visited OOH more than girls (52.7%–53.4%). Table 3 . Profile of visits to OOH Service by year (children aged 12 and under).

In T1 the number of consultations for children aged under six increased by 23%, and this increased level was sustained over all three post-policy years. However, the number of consultations by children aged six and over also increased by 20.8% in T1, and by 15.8% and 22.1% in T2 and T3. The proportion of OOH consultations that resulted in an ED referral for children aged under six remained similar to the pre-policy period for T1 (4.3%–4.5%) but increased to 5.8% in both T2 and T3. ED referral rates for the older cohort were higher, though a similar pattern can be observed, with comparable rates over the two pre-policy years and T1 (5.3%–6%), increasing in both T2 (6.9%) and T3 (6.3%).
OOH attendance increased substantially as a result of this policy ( Table 4 ; Fig. 5 ). Visits by the under-six cohort increased by 8.7 visits (20.5%) per month per centre for each SYOA in T1, 11 visits (26%) in T2 and 12.5 (29.4%) in T3. As a patient ID is not recorded on the OOH system, it was not possible to determine how much of this increase was accounted for by increased frequency of visits or increased number of patients attending.

Information on ED referrals from daytime GP services was not available, therefore this analysis is restricted to the OOH service only. There was no overall change in the marginal probability of an OOH visit resulting in an ED referral for children aged under six in T1 and T2, with an increase of 0.67 percentage points in T3 ( Table 5 ). However, the year effect common to both cohorts and an inspection of the graph of the trend in ED referrals ( Fig. 6 ) shows an increase in the proportion of visits referred to the ED for both cohorts in T2. The statistically significant policy effect for T3 was the result of a decrease in the referral rate for the older cohort, while the rate for the younger cohort remained consistent with prior year (T2).

Inspection of pre-policy trends ( Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 ) reveals consistent annual trends between both the younger and older cohorts over the two pre-policy periods: T-2 and T-1. Effects were also consistent using either pre-treatment period as a baseline (Appendix: Table A.11 ). Similarly, there was no statistically significant effect for the interaction with T-2 (also known as the placebo effect) i.e. the year before the year in which the policy came into effect, for any of our regressions ( Table 2 , Table 4 , Table 5 ). Therefore, while the counterfactual assumption cannot be assured, the statistical non-significance of the interaction between the annual trend and the T-2 dummy, and the consistency of effects across choice of baselines, provides some assurance that the common trend assumption is reasonable.

As the data extraction from daytime GP included only year of birth, Table 2 excluded children from the model in the year they turned six. The potential impact of this limitation of the data was assessed (Appendix: Table A.8 ). Effects estimated with the inclusion of children turning six in the treatment cohort were comparable with effects estimated when these children were included in the comparison cohort. Statistical significance remained unchanged throughout. Therefore, our analysis provides a robust and reasonable estimate of the policy effect.
As estimation depends on the use of an appropriate comparison group, sensitivity analysis was conducted (Appendix: Tables A.9 & A.10 ) to determine if the removal of older children (aged 9 and over) altered the results. Statistical significance remained unchanged throughout, with a marginal change in each of the estimated effects. Furthermore, children aged under nine but over five were assessed as a placebo treatment group and measured against children aged nine and over (Appendix Table A.12 ). Estimated placebo effects for daytime GP for T1 and T2 were not significant, although there was a small but nonetheless statistically significant effect for T3. While placebo estimates for T2 and T3 were not statistically significant for OOH, there was a small statistically significant effect for T1 and a small negative effect for ED referrals in T2.

Section: 4. Discussion

The introduction of this policy on 1 July 2015, which provided access to daytime and OOH GP care at no charge for children aged under six who were not existing holders of a medical or GP visit card, led to an increase in attendance at daytime GP of between 20.1% and 21.1%. and at OOH services of between 20.5% and 29.4%. These effect sizes are consistent with those estimated by O'Callaghan et al. (2018) also using daytime and OOH GP records, and greater than those estimated by Nolan and Layte (2017) using longitudinal survey data. The larger effect identified at the OOH service is consistent with the findings from a qualitative study of GPs, which highlighted the perception by GPs that the effects of the policy was more keenly felt in OOH services ( McCombe et al., 2019 ).
Consumer demand for healthcare responds to the out-of-pocket price consumers pay. By lowering, or in this case eliminating, the marginal cost of care to the individual (the out of-pocket price of care), healthcare usage generally increases ( Einav and Finkelstein, 2018 ). Research from the US has shown that having health insurance (Medicaid) increases healthcare spending across the board, including hospital admissions, ED visits, primary care , preventive care , and prescription drugs ( Finkelstein et al., 2016 ). Indeed, having Medicaid has been shown to increase the probability of having a primary care visit in the last six months by 21% ( Einav and Finkelstein, 2018 ). Better access to primary care, if this translates into timely and effective management of health conditions and preventative care, should improve health, and in turn reduce future healthcare utilization ( Einav and Finkelstein, 2018 ; Jatrana and Crampton, 2021 ). However, findings on the impact of improved access to healthcare on health outcomes vary. The Oregon Medicaid Experiment found no significant health benefits from health insurance during the first two years of coverage ( Taubman et al., 2014 ). Currie et al. (2008) found that while eligibility for public health insurance improved current utilization of preventive care , it had little effect on current health status . De La Mata (2012) also identified no short- or medium-term effects of Medicaid coverage on children's health. However, viewed over a longer timeframe, there is evidence of a positive impact of a sustained period of insurance and regular use of medical care on health outcomes. Miller and Wherry (2019) found Medicaid entitlement from early childhood resulted in lower rates of chronic conditions in adulthood, and fewer hospitalizations related to diabetes and obesity. Currie et al. (2008) found similar long term beneficial effects. Wherry et al. (2018) also found long run positive health effects of Medicaid, though these effects were confined to black cohorts who gained coverage.
This policy includes the provision of periodic wellness checks for children, focused on health, wellbeing and disease prevention , at ages two and five. Also included, with an additional fee to the GP, is an assessment visit for a child with asthma and an annual review visit starting in the year of registration on the Asthma Cycle of Care programme. With 10% of children in Ireland suffering from asthma, and with 40,000 children now registered under this programme ( Asthma Society of Ireland, 2019 ), these measures would lead to higher attendance at daytime GP, but also have the potential for long term health benefits for many children. It will therefore be important to monitor how this policy impacts child health over the longer term.
Those without free primary care are more likely to report an unmet healthcare need ( Connolly and Wren, 2017 ). An increase in the number of children under six referred by a GP to the ED following the introduction of this policy ( McDonnell et al., 2021 ; Walsh et al., 2019 ) may suggest previous unmet need. However, as a GP referral letter results in a waiver of the standard ED charge of €100 for those without free access as holders of a medical card, it is also possible that some parents of children with a GP visit card may attend GP wishing to obtain an ED referral at no cost. However, data limitations meant we were unable to determine if this policy resulted in a change in ED referral practices from the daytime service. While the OOH analysis does point to a general overall increase in the referral rate over the study period, this cannot be directly attributed to the policy, nor does it provide any insight on potential referral rates from daytime GP, and may be indicative of the pressure placed on the OOH service due to increasing demand. EDs in many countries are struggling to meet demand ( Benahmed et al., 2012 ; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ), and much attention has been given to redirecting patients, particularly those presenting with low acuity conditions, to the care of GPs. However, while not the primary aim of the provision of free GP care, there is no evidence, as yet, that the extension of this policy is alleviating pressure on EDs ( McDonnell et al., 2021 ; Walsh et al., 2019 ).
The World Health Organisation states UHC exists when all people receive the quality health services needed without suffering financial hardship ( World Health Report, 2010 ). This policy has certainly removed the barrier of cost for many parents. However, it is important that access to quality GP care is preserved. GPs have expressed concern that the policy has resulted in less availability of appointments in general, with some GPs introducing waiting lists to take up cancelled appointments due to high demand ( McCombe et al., 2019 ). GPs also highlighted the pressures they face due to a shortage in resourcing, staffing and inadequate funding ( McCombe et al., 2019 ). Children aged under six are more frequent attenders at GP compared to older children. Should this policy be extended to children aged under 12, the increase in the number of visits would be relatively less severe due to lower attendance rates by this older cohort ( Health Service Executive, 2015 ). Nonetheless, the pace of change needs to be realistic, with further entitlement expansion linked to capacity building ( Thomas et al., 2021 ). Over one third of GPs in Ireland are aged over 55, with some unable to retire due to the lack of a replacement, particularly in rural areas (House of the Oireachtas, 2019). Indeed, the challenge of filling GP vacancies is one currently faced by many countries ( Iacobucci, 2019 ; Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, 2019 ). If increased demand results in patients being unable to access timely GP care, then the success of this policy in terms of improved health outcomes may be limited.
While this policy has resulted in increased utilization of healthcare, some of which is by design through the provision of assessment visits, many factors determine where, when and from whom parents seek healthcare for their child. There is an urgent need to increase the number of GPs ( Health Service Executive, 2015 ), however there are health system adaptions that could help meet growing demand. The Sláintecare plan includes the aim of providing universal access to a range of primary care services ( Houses of The Oireachtas Committee on The Future of Healthcare, 2017 ). Many patients currently face delays in accessing primary care services such as physiotherapy , speech and language therapy and mental health supports ( Health Service Executive, 2020 ). GPs are unable to obtain timely referrals for patients, and therefore continue to treat patients who should be supported by other parts of the health system. Greater investment in these services and improved access is needed. Furthermore, diagnostics such as x-rays, ultrasound and MRI are available in hospital settings only. The availability of diagnostics in a primary care setting would require investment but could result in greater efficiencies and access for those in need ( O'Dowd et al., 2017 ). Improved funding and training of practice nurses could also ensure GP time is spent efficiently ( O'Dowd et al., 2017 ). The widespread adoption of remote consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic ensured the provision of accessible healthcare at a challenging time. With perceived urgency and the need for reassurance often driving a parent's decision to seek healthcare for their child ( Conlon et al., 2021 ; Nicholson et al., 2020 ), this model of care might provide an accessible option for parents seeking reassurance and guidance. Indeed, approximately 20% of calls to the OOH service in this study were triaged by telephone by a nurse without further need for a consultation with a GP. However, current data systems, particularly in primary care, make assessing the impact of policy initiatives challenging, and this needs to be addressed if future Sláintecare developments are to be robustly evaluated.
This study is subject to some limitations, primarily due to data availability. The absence of diagnosis codes from OOHs and the extent of missing data in daytime GP, meant the impact of the policy on reason for attendance could not be assessed. Similarly, severity of presenting illness is not recorded, for example through the use of a triage scale, so conclusions on the change in the urgency of presentations cannot be made. Compliance with GDPR meant the GP data extraction did not include the date or month of birth of children in this sample, therefore exact age could not be calculated. Month of birth was extracted from the larger OOH sample, however. The manner in which ED referral information is stored on the Socrates™ system (i.e. in letter format), meant we were also unable to extract this information from daytime GP. Similarly, the extraction of data on registered children who did not attend was not possible. The sample size meant calculation of catchment populations that would allow the expression of the findings as a rate per local population was also not possible. Therefore, the adjustments for changes in population is indicative and is not an exact representation of the change in the registered patients at each participating practice. While data were extracted from GP practices of varying size and location and a large regional OOH service, this study cannot claim that these findings are nationally representative.
Through the use of data from a nationwide sample of GPs and an OOH service covering a large geographical region, an analysis that extends to three years post-policy, and detailed examination of the common trend assumption, this study provides a robust assessment of the impact of the introduction of free GP care for children aged under six on attendance at daytime and OOH GP. Our findings show the removal of a fee for access to GP, including OOH, resulted in a substantial increase in attendance, a finding that is consistent with international comparisons. While this policy has resulted in an increase in health seeking by parents on behalf of their children and has added pressure to GP services ( McCombe et al., 2019 ), some of the increased attendance may be addressing previous unmet need, may be preventative, and may lead to better management of health conditions in the long term. However, if the international experience is anything to go by, it will take some time for these health benefits to become apparent.

Section: 5. Conclusion

In July 2015, children in Ireland aged under six became entitled to GP visit cards, allowing free at the point of delivery access to GP care. Policy makers viewed this as an initial step in the transition from a mixed public and privately funded health system to a system of universal healthcare ( Department of Health, 2019 ). These results show that this policy led to a substantial increase in the number of children attending daytime and OOH GP services and an increase in the frequency of their visits. Prior unmet need, the provision of additional assessments to children aged under six, parental response to a service at no charge, and rerouting of access to the ED through GP by some parents, are all likely contributors to this increased demand. A more integrated policy of boosting supply as well as demand is desirable, particularly in the context of future expansion plans, to ensure the health benefits anticipated from the introduction of this policy have every opportunity to be realised.
