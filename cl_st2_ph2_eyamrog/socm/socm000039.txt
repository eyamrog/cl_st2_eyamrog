Title: Rural life and suicide: Does the effect of the community context vary by country of birth? A Swedish registry-based multilevel cohort study


Abstract: Abstract

Contextual factors varying by residence in rural or urban areas may have different effects on the suicide of residents by nativity, but evidence on the urban-rural gap in suicide according to nativity is lacking. This study aims to evaluate the effect of cross-level interaction between nativity and rurality of residence on suicide risk, at two levels of aggregation (municipalities/neighborhoods). Study design was nationwide register-based cohort study in Sweden, 2011–2016. Participants were all residents 20 years or older. We calculated Incidence Rate Ratios comparing suicide incidence by nativity using three-level (individuals, neighborhoods, and municipalities) Poisson regression, stratified by gender. Among men, suicide incidences were the highest among those born in other Nordic countries, followed by those born in Sweden, other European countries, Middle Eastern countries, and the rest of the world. Residing in rural areas was associated with high IRR of suicide regardless of nativity, compared to residing in urban areas. When evaluating rurality at municipality level, we observed an increased suicide risk from living in rural areas in men born in other European (rural-urban ratio of nativity-specific IRRs: 1.39) and other Nordic (1.37) countries, followed by native Swedes (1.22). When evaluating rurality at neighborhood level, rurality was associated with increased suicide risk in men for all nativities, with the foreign-born showing higher risk than the Swedish-born. Individual sociodemographic characteristics explained the excess suicide risk in rural municipalities, but not the excess risk in rural neighborhoods. Among women, urban residents showed higher suicide incidence than rural residents. We found no consistent patterning of interaction with nativities among women. Foreign-born individuals residing in rural municipalities may have less access to economic resources and employment opportunities. Furthermore, ethnic discrimination, stigma, and exclusion from social networks and community may be more common in rural neighborhood contexts, leading to an increased risk of suicide.

Section: 1. Introduction

International migration is a global phenomenon. The number of international migrants has continued to grow rapidly in recent years, reaching 258 million in 2017 ( United Nations, 2017 ). Migration can offer significant socioeconomic benefits to those who have migrated as well as the countries accepting them. While migration can offer positive health benefits, public health literature has reported potential strong mental-health risks among immigrants, due to a psychosocial process of loss and change ( Carta et al., 2005 ; Close et al., 2016 ). Forte et al. (2018) have suggested that some groups of migrants have higher suicide risks, while others have similar or lower suicide risks, compared to the native population ( Forte et al., 2018 ). Hence, migration is a potential risk factor for suicide. In Sweden, people with a foreign background (born abroad or having two foreign-born parents) comprise 24.1% of all residents in 2017, and this figure is increasing ( Statistics Sweden, 2018a ). Studies in Sweden have reported a higher suicide risk in immigrants from Finland and lower risk in immigrants from Southern Europe and the Middle East, compared to the Swedish-born ( Gilliver et al., 2014 ). The prevalence of depression and anxiety – the primary risk factors for suicide – were also reported to be higher among immigrants from the Middle East ( Tinghög and Carstensen, 2010 ) and those born outside Scandinavia ( Tinghög et al., 2007 ), compared to the Swedish-born.
Multilevel and multidimensional factors can explain the complex pattern of suicide risk among immigrants. At the individual level, some individual behavioral and socioeconomic risks are likely accumulated more in immigrants; and the political, environmental, and cultural contexts of their country of birth and current countries of residence are another factor to consider. A systematic review has suggested that the suicide rate of immigrants’ birth country continues to influence their suicide rate in the destination country ( Spallek et al., 2015 ). These contextual factors potentially affecting individual mental health include social norms, accessibility to healthcare and other public services, area-level socioeconomic disadvantage, social capital, gender relations, and prejudice regarding specific subpopulations ( Cairns et al., 2017 ; Durkheim, 1897 ; Johnson et al., 2017 ; Judd et al., 2006 ; Payne et al., 2008 ; Williams and Mohammed, 2013 ). Therefore, suicide risk among immigrants can vary across their countries of birth.
The contextual factors potentially altering suicide risk also vary across areas within a country. Specifically, rurality is a factor that can structure these social contexts ( Judd et al., 2006 ). For example, rural areas generally have disadvantages in labor market size and variability. Consequently, in rural areas immigrants’ employment rates tend to be is lower than in urban areas ( Hedlund et al., 2017 ). Compared to urban cities, in rural areas racist prejudice is likely to be stronger due to the lower diversity in ethnic groups and the conservative notions that likely marginalize immigrants ( Chakraborti and Garland, 2006 ). There is evidence of high suicide rates in rural areas, and a potential link between area deprivation, social isolation and rural ideologies to suicide ( Hirsch, 2006 ; Hirsch and Cukrowicz, 2014 ; Solmi et al., 2016 ). In Australia, Morrell et al. showed higher suicide incidence in men residing in rural areas compared to urban areas, which may have mostly been due to excess suicide among migrants ( Morrell et al., 1999 ). Hence, given the vulnerability of foreign-born people and the potential disadvantages in rural areas, the contextual factors in rural areas may affect the suicide risk among them.
Measures of rurality at different levels of aggregation may reflect different contextual features, and different potential mechanisms might be active ( Kondo et al., 2012 ; Rehkopf and Buka, 2006 ; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2006 ). The municipality level, which is the smallest politically independent unit of aggregation in Sweden, may reflect variations in the consequences of urban-rural political decisions. For example, if we hypothesize that rurality affects suicide through the characteristics of the labor market, then a politically meaningful unit of aggregation, such as a municipality, is appropriate for testing this hypothesis ( Rostila et al., 2012 ). When evaluating rurality at smaller units of aggregation, such as neighborhoods or areas within municipalities, an excess suicide risk among particular groups in rural areas might represent interpersonal factors, such as social network processes. Nevertheless, a municipality could include both densely populated and less populated neighborhoods/areas. Measuring rurality only at the municipality level ignores such a variation. In line with the hypothesis suggesting an elevated suicide risk in rural areas/neighborhoods ( Judd et al., 2006 ), the contextual effect of rurality on suicide may be more accentuated among those residing in depopulated neighborhoods than among those in populated ones within the same municipality. Moreover, rurality at municipality level and at a smaller unit level may interact with each other on suicide risk, as the municipality's structural features may exaggerate/buffer the beneficial/detrimental effects of interpersonal relationships and vice versa. Therefore, when studying rurality and suicide risk it is important to consider both levels of aggregation – i.e. municipalities and smaller units (neighborhoods) – and the ways they interact.
However, evidence of an urban-rural gap in suicide rates according to country of birth is lacking. Using national registry data in Sweden, this study examined the urban-rural inequality of suicide in Sweden, at two different levels of aggregation (municipality and neighborhood). First, we examined whether suicide rates differ by neighborhood- and municipality-level rurality, respectively, and then we examined the contribution at each level to suicide risk. Second, we tested whether the excess risk of living in rural areas is greater for the foreign-born than for natives, by examining the effect of cross-level interaction between country of birth and rurality on suicide risk. Third, we explored whether individual sociodemographic characteristics explain suicide risk by country of birth and rurality. Fourth, we tested whether there is interaction on suicide risk between municipality-level rurality and neighborhood-level rurality.

Section: 2. Method

We used multiple linked Swedish registry data covering the total Swedish population. We set the baseline population with address information in 2011 (n = 9,482,855), and excluded data on individuals who were duplicated (n = 159) or who could not be linked to general information such as sex or age (n = 3485). We analyzed people 20 years or older at baseline. Using the data, we designed a cohort study . The baseline year is 2011 and we followed up until suicide, censoring (dead from cause other than suicide, or moved from Sweden), or end of follow-up in 2016, whichever came first. A total of 3,606,487 men nested within 6261 neighborhoods in 290 municipalities and 3,696,095 women nested within 6226 neighborhoods in 290 municipalities met our inclusion criteria. Since some very small Swedish neighborhoods are only populated by men – i.e. values are missing for women – there are more neighborhoods for men than women ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ).
The outcome is suicide, classified using the ICD codes for intentional self-harm (ICD9: E950-E959; ICD10: X60-X84, Y870). As suicide has different incidence rates by gender and age, we stratified all the analyses by gender and adjusted by age ( Socialstyrelsen, 2018 ), which was categorized in ten-year increments. Country of birth was classified using five categories: Sweden, other Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and other Nordic countries besides Sweden), other European countries except Nordic countries, Middle Eastern countries (Iraq, Iran, Lebanon , and Syria), and the rest of the world. We categorized these five categories based on a number of previous studies on country of birth and health in Sweden ( Hjern, 2012 ; Honkaniemi et al., 2017 ; Westman et al., 2006 ). It was also important to separate the large group of Middle Eastern migrants, consisting primarily of refugees, from other categories of foreign-born ( Abbott, 2016 ).
We used municipality-level and neighborhood-level rurality indicators, and used the municipal classification established by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions in 2017, found at the Statistics Sweden website ( Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, 2016 ). This municipal grouping was done based on population, distance from populated areas and commuting patterns. This municipal classification contains three main groups, A, B, and C: A includes 46 large cities and municipalities near large cities, which we defined as “urban”; B includes 108 medium-sized towns and municipalities near medium-sized towns, which we defined as “suburban”; and C includes 136 smaller towns/urban areas and rural municipalities, which we defined it as “rural”.
Our definition of neighborhood was based on the Demographic Statistical Area (DeSO) area-level measure, developed by Statistics Sweden, whereby DeSO refers to demographic statistics areas established by the government ( Statistics Sweden, 2018b ). Each DeSO has between 1000 and 3000 people per area within each municipality, and the rurality of each unit is classified as one of the three categories A, B or C, or “other. A includes areas largely outside major population concentrations or urban areas, which we defined as “rural”. B includes areas largely in a population concentration or urban areas, but not central in the municipality, which we defined as “suburban”. C includes areas located centrally in the municipality, which we defined as “urban”. In the DeSO criteria, the remaining residents whose addresses were not classified to other DeSO areas are coded as other, and we treated these as missing. Analyzing cross-level interactions aims to additionally uncover some of the complex contextual-level dynamics between rurality and suicide risk. These analyses will reveal, for example, whether suicide risk is influenced by residing in a rural neighborhood within a densely populated urban municipality, i.e. whether the surrounding municipality context matters.
We used individual sociodemographic characteristics – marital status (divorced, partner, single, and widowed), education (primary, secondary, tertiary, and unknown), employment status (employed and unemployed), and individual disposable income quintile (highest, high, middle, low, and lowest) – all of which were observed at baseline.
We calculated Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) using three-level (individual, neighborhood, and municipality) Poisson regression, stratified by gender. Although survival analysis is frequently used in epidemiologic studies , we used the Poisson model, for which the validity of Median Rate Ratios (MRRs) and estimated general contextual effects using three-level data was available, as described below. We did not find validated methods for calculating MRRs using three-level survival models. We used the mepoisson command in STATA/MP 15.1 and incorporated random intercepts at the neighborhood level and the municipality level (StataCorp, LLC, College Station, Texas, USA). The offset variable was the logarithm of person-year. We created dummy variables for missing data in covariates and modelled them. We first analyzed a null (empty) model to evaluate the variance of the random parameters, and then added variables in the following order: age (Model 1), country of birth (Model 2), municipality-level rurality (Model 3) or neighborhood-level rurality (Model 4), and both neighborhood- and municipality-level rurality to examine the independent contributions of the rurality, evaluated at two different levels of aggregation, to suicide (Model 5). To interpret the magnitude of the effects of clustering at municipal or neighborhood level, we calculated MRRs from the estimated variance of the random parameters, which means the median relative change in the incidence rate of suicide when comparing a randomly selected resident from a group with a higher suicide rate and one from another with a lower suicide rate ( Austin et al., 2018 ). Comparing MRRs calculated from each model with the fixed effect of the different level rurality, we evaluated the magnitude of the effects of rurality. Then, to assess whether differences in suicide rates by rurality varied by country of birth, we tested the cross-level interaction term between rurality and country of birth. To evaluate the urban-rural gap in estimated suicide rate by country of birth, we calculated Pair Ratios of rural areas (reference: urban areas) by country of birth, using the Health Disparities Calculator, 2017 version 2.0.0 ( Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Surveillance Research Program and Healthcare Delivery Research Program, National Cancer Institute, 2019 ). The Pair Ratio in suicide between urban and rural areas is the simple arithmetic ratio ( Health Disparities Calculator, 2017 ). Next, to assess how the effect of the neighborhood-level rurality differed from the municipality-level rurality, we tested the interaction term between municipality-level rurality and neighborhood-level rurality, adjusted for age and country of birth. We also described differential suicide incidence by rurality by age groups, adding the cross-level interaction term between rurality and age groups. Finally, to explore whether individual sociodemographic characteristics explained differential suicide risk across rurality, we added individual sociodemographic characteristics in Model 6 and compared the results with Model 5. We calculated the percent change from Model 5 to Model 6 in the excess risk of suicide among those residing in rural areas compared to that among those in urban areas.
We conducted two types of sensitivity analyses, namely for measurement and for the statistical modeling approach. First, since the definition of rural areas is relative and can vary by comparative area, we used the Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA) by Eurostat (2016) for municipality-level rurality. DEGURBA is an area classification for Europe based on geographical contiguity and minimum population threshold applied to 1 km 2 population grid cells , using a 2011 population grid and the 2016 local administrative unit boundaries. Densely populated municipalities are classified as “cities,” intermediate density areas as “towns and suburbs,” and thinly populated areas as “rural areas.” Second, instead of IRR, we calculated Hazard Ratio (HR) using parametric three-level (individual, neighborhood, and municipality) survival model, which assumes a Weibull distribution. We used the mestreg command in Stata/MP 15.1 to fit multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival models, assuming normally distributed random effects, estimated with maximum likelihood utilizing Gaussian quadrature.

Section: 3. Results

Among men, descriptive data showed that the suicide incidence rates per 1000 person-years were higher among those born in other Nordic countries, followed by those born in Sweden, other European countries, Middle Eastern countries, and the rest of the world ( Table 1 ). Compared to urban municipalities or urban neighborhoods, the suicide incidence rates were higher among men residing in rural municipalities and rural neighborhoods. The null model of multilevel regression analysis showed that the incidence rate varied between municipalities and between neighborhoods: the MRRs were 1.21 and 1.33, respectively ( Table 2 ). In the models with regional and individual fixed-effects estimators, the IRRs were 1.23 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.09 to 1.38) in rural municipalities and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.28) in rural neighborhoods, compared to urban municipalities or urban neighborhoods ( Table 2 , Model 5). When we added age, country of birth, municipality-level rurality, and neighborhood-level rurality, the MRRs changed slightly ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Table 1 .

We found cross-level interaction effects between country of birth and rurality among men, and the effects relied on the areal unit to evaluate rurality. The Pair Ratios of estimated suicide rates in rural municipalities were 1.39 (95% CI: 1.38 to 1.40) among persons born in other European countries, 1.37 (95% CI: 1.36 to 1.39) among those born in other Nordic countries, and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.22 to 1.23) among the Swedish-born ( Table 3 and Fig. 1 ). The suicide risk among men born in Middle Eastern countries and the rest of the world was lower in rural municipalities than urban municipalities. At the neighborhood level, the excess risk in rural municipalities for men was observed in all categories of country of birth (Pair Ratios [95% CI] for those residing in rural neighborhoods: 1.24 [1.24 to 1.24] for Sweden, 1.12 [1.11 to 1.12] for other Nordic countries, 1.42 [1.41 to 1.43] for other European countries, 1.65 [1.61 to 1.69] for Middle Eastern countries, and 2.89 [2.85 to 2.92] for the rest of the world).

After cross-level interaction terms between municipality-level rurality and neighborhood-level rurality were added to Model 5, men residing in rural neighborhoods in rural municipalities showed the highest suicide rate ( Fig. 2 ).

Among women, urban residents showed a slightly higher suicide incidence than rural residents (IRR 0.97 for those residing in rural municipalities and IRR 0.84 for those residing in rural neighborhoods; Table 2 ). Analyses with cross-level interaction terms between country of birth and rurality showed that the excess risk of suicide among those residing in rural municipalities or rural neighborhoods, compared to urban municipalities or urban neighborhoods, was only observed in those born in other Nordic countries or in other European countries, respectively ( Table 3 and Fig. 1 ).
Our sensitivity analyses showed that the results of the regression models using the alternative municipality-level rurality classified by Eurostat were mostly the same as those of our original models ( Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, Figs. 2 and 3 ). The multilevel survival models also showed almost identical results as those of our original Poisson models ( Supplementary Tables 7 and 8, Figs. 4 and 5 ).

Section: 4. Discussion

We found urban-rural inequalities in suicide incidence among foreign-born and native Swedish adult men. Comparing based on country of birth when evaluating rurality at the municipality level, the excess suicide risk from residing in rural municipalities was higher among men born in other European or Nordic countries than among native Swedes. When evaluating rurality at the neighborhood level, the excess risk from residing in rural neighborhoods was higher among men born in the rest of the world, Middle Eastern countries, and other European countries than among native Swedes. While the IRRs of men born in Middle Eastern countries and the rest of the world were high if they resided in rural neighborhoods, this was not the case for rural municipalities. The excess risk of residing in rural municipalities among men was explained by their individual sociodemographic characteristics, whereas the excess risk of residing in rural neighborhoods was only slightly explained by this. On the other hand, women residing in urban areas generally showed higher suicide incidence than in rural areas, but we found no consistent patterning of interaction with country of birth. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the urban-rural inequality in suicide using different units of aggregation while also accounting for differences by country of birth. As the previous review suggested that origin-specific contextual factors such as the culture of the birth country continue to exert influence in the destination country ( Spallek et al., 2015 ), the order of suicide rates among countries of birth was generally similar between urban and rural areas. Our findings of high suicide rates among foreign-born men living in rural areas are in line with the results of the Australian study from the 1990s ( Morrell et al., 1999 ), but are not concordant with the study by Morrell et al. also showing high suicide rates among native Swedes in rural areas. Our novel findings suggest the existence of contextual factors affecting all men living in rural areas regardless of their country of birth.
We found a different interaction between country of birth and rurality by level of aggregation among men. Individual sociodemographic characteristics explained more of the rurality-suicide association in municipalities. We speculate that this is because municipalities are politically independent while neighborhoods are not, and municipalities have an effect on sociodemographic characteristics through labor market and social benefits . Swedish municipalities have a relatively high degree of political autonomy . Rural municipalities have faced several problems related to economic and demographic decline, including lower tax revenues and the cutback of public services ( Hedlund, 2017 ). Residents may have difficulty accessing mental health services and higher education, obtaining stable employment, and so on. Thus, the lack of stable job opportunities and available resources in rural municipalities can be suggested as a potential explanation for the excess suicide risk among European-born and native men in these areas, since area-level socioeconomic disadvantages were reported to link to a high suicide rate or suicidal behavior ( Cairns et al., 2017 ; Rehkopf and Buka, 2006 ). Further, foreign-born people may be further disadvantaged in terms of education mismatch or exposure to discrimination ( Dunlavy et al., 2016 ; Rydgren, 2004 ). Immigrants from Finland have historically formed the largest group of Nordic migrants in Sweden. Finns generally have higher suicide rates than Swedes ( Titelman et al., 2013 ), and it is possible that this higher suicide risk persists when they have migrated to Sweden. Statistics also show that they are more likely to be single and unemployed, and to have a low education, compared to native Swedes ( Westman et al., 2008 ). These are well-known risk factors for suicide ( Blakely et al., 2003 ; Garcy and Vagerö, 2013 ; Lorant et al., 2018 , 2005 ).
On the other hand, in our analysis, men's excess suicide risk in rural neighborhoods was only slightly explained by individual sociodemographic characteristics. Thus, we need other factors to explain this. Compared to urban communities, rural communities generally have rich social ties and cohesive characteristics within the local community ( Sørensen, 2016 ). While numerous studies have reported that social relationships were positively associated with good mental and physical health ( Ehsan et al., 2019 ), overly strong ties could harm health due to an “exclusion of outsiders” and “restrictions on individual freedom,” as Portes (1998) suggests as being a dark side of cohesive communities ( Portes, 1998 ). Foreign-born men might suffer more than native Swedish men from these negative effects of cohesive rural communities. In addition, difficulty with acculturation and a discrimination of ethnic minorities might exaggerate suicide risk among foreign-born men. Wiking et al. (2004) reported that the self-rated health of immigrants from the Middle East in Sweden was poorer than that of native Swedes, which was largely explained by poor Swedish language proficiency and discrimination ( Wiking et al., 2004 ). Although the suicide rate among the Middle Eastern-born has generally been reported to be lower than that of native Swedes ( Gilliver et al., 2014 ), the observed high IRR in rural neighborhoods among the Middle Eastern-born in this study might be due to disadvantages in social interactions in their local communities.
We found the excess suicide risk from residing in rural areas mostly only among men. The perspective of socially constructed masculinities in rural areas may be useful in explaining this ( Campbell and Michael, 2000 ). Alston (2012) argued that the disadvantaged context in rural areas could be deeply associated with the dominant construction of masculine norms like stoicism – pushing on through hardship, illness, and despair ( Alston, 2012 ). Consequently, rural masculinities may restrict men in taking advantage of social support from friends and families, and may serve as a barrier to help-seeking behavior ( Seidler et al., 2016 ). Although Sweden is known to be a highly gender-equal country, with a Gender Inequality Index ranked fourth in 2015 ( United Nations Development Programme, 2016 ), and nationwide political and structural actions expanding women's social roles, Backhans et al. argued that this did not largely change the behavioral patterning of the gendered norm ( Backhans et al., 2007 ). Thus, it may be difficult for men in rural regions to get mental health services.
Although the excess risks were observed predominantly among men, it is important to emphasize that the gender difference in the association between rurality and suicide risk is complicated and relates to the gender paradox in mental health. Men are overrepresented in terms of completed suicides, while the prevalence of mental health problems and suicide attempts is higher in women ( Canetto and Sakinofsky, 1998 ). Future studies should examine the association between rurality and other indicators of mental health problems, such as psychiatric hospitalization, suicide attempts, or use of psychotropic medication.
In this study, we included people who were 20 years or older at baseline. Thus, the majority of the study population has entered the labor market or tertiary education in Sweden. This facilitates studying the contribution of sociodemographic factors in our models.
Our study has notable strengths. Although the concept of rurality has many geographical, political, and cultural dimensions, our rurality indicators were based on population density and distance from city areas, which were reported to be sensitive to the relationship between rurality and suicide in a comparison of urbanicity indicators ( Helbich et al., 2017 ). The similarity of the results using two different municipality-level ruralities strengthens the robustness of the findings. The use of total population data for Sweden is a strength in our study. The mechanisms and processes linking rurality and suicide we discuss in this paper might be applicable in other countries, and should therefore be tested. Furthermore, our study could stimulate research on the rurality-suicide association in different migration groups in other countries, as there is currently little evidence within the field.
This study also has several limitations. First, misclassification can occur when the cause of death is registered as suicide; it may be classified as an injury-related death, traffic death, undetermined, and so on ( Tøllefsen et al., 2012 ). Further studies should take these diagnoses into consideration and confirm the robustness of the results. Second, we did not consider migration within Sweden during the observation period for two reasons: 1) we found that the regression models considering changing addresses was too complex to calculate estimates, and 2) evaluating the interaction effects of domestic and international migration should be another independent topic for future studies. However, in general, there are more immigrants moving to cities than to rural areas ( Statistics Sweden, 2016 ), and in our study we placed people in the rural resident category if they resided in a rural area in 2011, regardless of the actual duration of their rural residence. This may have led to an underestimation of the excess suicide rates in rural areas. Third, as the number of suicides among people born in Middle Eastern countries was very small, the association between suicide and rurality among these people should be interpreted with caution. Further studies should examine long-term trends and confirm the robustness of the findings.

Section: 5. Conclusion

Men in rural municipalities/neighborhoods showed a higher suicide risk than those in urban areas regardless of country of birth, with a potential stronger impact of residing in rural areas among foreign-born men. Our findings of differential suicide risk and the potential mechanisms of residing in rural municipalities and rural neighborhoods warrant further study. Particularly, identifying the relevant community characteristics, including local policies and cultural norms/behaviors, may contribute to public health interventions to prevent suicide and its inequalities by rurality, migration status, and gender. Continuous monitoring actions for health policy should focus more on the distribution of suicide and its risk factors by regional characteristics and immigration status.
