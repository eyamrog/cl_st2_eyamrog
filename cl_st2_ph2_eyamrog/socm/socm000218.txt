Title: Early life programming of adult ischemic heart disease within and across generations: The role of the socioeconomic context


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

The developmental origins of ischemic heart disease (IHD) have been widely documented but little is known about their persistence across more than one generation. This study aimed to investigate whether the effects of early life disadvantages on adult IHD have changed between generations and are mediated by adult socioeconomic circumstances, and further explore the transgenerational effects of grandparental and parental exposures to disadvantaged circumstances on adult offspring's IHD.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We used register-based data from the Uppsala Multigenerational Study, Sweden. The study populations were the parents born 1915–1929 and their offspring born 1932–1972 with available obstetric data. The offspring were further linked to grandparents who had their socioeconomic and demographic data recorded. The outcome was incident IHD assessed at ages 32–75 during a follow-up from January 1, 1964 till December 31, 2008. The exposures included birthweight standardized-for-gestational age, ponderal index, gestational length, and parental socioeconomic position (SEP). Education and income were analyzed as mediators. Potential transgenerational associations were explored by linking offspring IHD to parents' standardized birthweight and gestational length, grandparental SEP, and to grandmothers’ age, parity, and marital status at parental birth. All associations were examined in Cox proportional hazard regression models.

Abstract_Section: Results

Lower standardized birthweight and lower parental SEP were found to be associated with higher IHD rates in both generations, with no evidence of effect modification by generation. Education and income did not mediate the association between standardized birthweight and IHD. Disadvantaged grandparental SEP, younger and older childbearing ages of grandmothers, and paternal preterm birth affected offspring's IHD independent of parental education, income, or IHD history.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

The findings point to similar magnitudes of IHD inequalities by early life disadvantages across two historical periods and the existence of transgenerational effects on IHD. Epigenetic dysregulation involving the germline is a plausible candidate mechanism underlying the transgenerational associations that warrant further research.

Section: 1. Introduction

The early life environment as a determinant of adult health received worldwide attention since David Barker promulgated the hypothesis of the fetal origins of adult diseases in the late 1980s ( Barker and Osmond, 1986 ; Barker et al., 1989 ). It has now been well-established that children with small body size at birth are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, especially ischemic heart disease (IHD), as adults ( Barker et al., 1989 , 1993a ; Osmond and Barker, 2000 ; Huxley et al., 2000 ; Bergvall and Cnattingius, 2008 ; Risnes et al., 2011 ). Previous studies also demonstrated an association between preterm birth , defined as births before 37 weeks of completed gestation , and increased risks of stroke ( Koupil et al., 2005 ; Ueda et al., 2014 ), heart failure ( Carr et al., 2017 ), and cardiovascular mortality ( Crump et al., 2011 ) in adulthood. With regard to IHD and preterm birth, however, the majority of studies showed a null association ( Koupil et al., 2005 ; Ueda et al., 2014 ; Kaijser et al., 2008 ; Kajantie et al., 2015 ) while a recent nationwide Swedish study reported an increased risk of developing IHD in preterm children ( Crump et al., 2019 ).
Evidence from animal studies further suggests that the prenatal and postnatal disturbances may establish a transmissible epigenetic ‘memory’ that can extend across several generations ( Franklin et al., 2010 ; Dunn and Bale, 2011 ; Burdge et al., 2007 ; Cropley et al., 2012 ). The developmental origins of disease across more than one generation have not been adequately explored in human observational studies which typically focus on the first-generation offspring. Thus far, the available evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in humans is indirect and based primarily on interpretations of results from three small birth cohorts in northern Sweden, known as the Överkalix cohorts. Studies on these cohorts have shown that grandparents' access to food supply during the so-called slow growth period in mid-childhood was associated with deaths from all-causes, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in the grandchildren ( Bygren et al., 2001 , 2014 ; Kaati et al., 2002 ). Although mired in controversy ( Senn, 2006 ), findings of the Överkalix studies were later partially confirmed by a replication study conducted on a larger cohort and their descendants in the Uppsala region in Sweden ( Vågerö et al., 2018 ), sparking a renewed interest in the study of human transgenerational responses to ancestral environment.
Over the last half of the 20th century, there has been a secular increase in mean birthweights in many high income countries ( Chike-Obi et al., 1996 ; Koupilova et al., 2000 ; Kramer et al., 2002 ), probably due to changes in socioeconomic circumstances and pregnancy complications , improved nutrition, and reduced maternal smoking ( Kramer et al., 2002 ). In Sweden, the gradual development of social welfare systems and universal health care coverage throughout the twentieth century has been instrumental in improving health and living conditions ( Sundin and Willner, 2007 ). Accordingly, the generations who were born and grew up at different stages in the development of the social welfare systems may have had differential exposures both to the intrauterine nutritional environment and the postnatal social environment. Consequently, any change in the strength of developmental origins of adult diseases across generations would be consistent with the contextual changes in the respective historical periods. Drawing on the Uppsala Birth Cohort Multigenerational Study (UBCoS Multigen), the current study has the aim to investigate whether the effects of early life social and biological disadvantages on the onset of IHD in adult life (i) have changed between generations and (ii) are mediated by adult socioeconomic circumstances (see diagram A in Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, we investigated (iii) potential transgenerational effects of grandparents' and parents' exposures to disadvantaged circumstances on offspring's adult IHD and (iv) to what extent these are robust to the control for parental socioeconomic circumstances and the history of IHD (see diagram B in Fig. 1 ).

Section: 2. Methods

Data were derived from UBCoS Multigen which compiles information on birth characteristics and adult socioeconomic and health circumstances from multiple sources including sociodemographic and healthcare registers, archives, and census records in Sweden ( Koupil, 2007 ). To compare the associations between early life exposures and adult IHD between generations, we used data from Generation 1 (G1) born in the Uppsala University Hospital during 1915–1929 and their offspring (G2) born 1932–1972. Out of the 14 192 live born members in G1 (female 48%), 12 168 were traced until they were given unique personal identification numbers. We restricted the analysis to singletons who were alive and living in Sweden in 1964 (n = 11 580). A total of 10 568 (91%) persons who had complete data on the variables of interest were included in the analysis. As for G2, the study sample was restricted to individuals whose parents were resident in the Uppsala region because obstetric data of children born outside could not be obtained. Of the 9248 G2 members (female 48%) born during 1932–1972, we managed to track 7238 individuals. Those who died or emigrated before 1964 (n = 182) as well as the twins/triplets (n = 113) were excluded. Due to missing data on some study variables (n = 388), 6555 (94%) subjects were included in the final analysis ( Fig. 2 ).

To assess the transgenerational effects of grandparental and parental characteristics on offspring's adult IHD, we linked 3730 G2 members to their mothers (G1) and maternal grandparents (G0), and 3606 G2 members to their fathers (G1) and paternal grandparents (G0). Thus, individuals with complete data across three generations contributed to the transgenerational analysis ( Fig. 2 ). The study was approved by the regional ethics committee in Stockholm.
The outcome of the study was incident IHD occurring at ages 35–75 in G1 and at ages 32–75 in G2. The outcome was defined as the first recorded hospitalization or death with IHD as the main or contributing diagnosis in accordance with the following international classification of diseases (ICD): ICD 10 (I20–I25), ICD 9 and ICD 8 (410–414), and ICD 7 (420–422). The Swedish inpatient register ( Ludvigsson et al., 2011 ) and the cause of death register ( Brooke et al., 2017 ) were the sources of IHD data. Follow up of the study subjects for incident IHD commenced on January 1, 1964 when the Swedish hospital discharge register was initiated in the Uppsala region ( Ludvigsson et al., 2011 ; Rajaleid et al., 2009 ). Individuals younger than age 32 at baseline entered the follow up on their 32nd birthday. Follow up continued until the date of first IHD diagnosis, death, emigration, 75th birthday, or December 31, 2008 whichever was the earliest.
The main exposures of interest were parental socioeconomic position (SEP), length of gestation , and two measures of fetal growth : birthweight standardized for gestational age, and an index of birthweight in relation to length known as ponderal index. Parental SEP in G1 was based on the occupation of the father (80%), or of the mother if father's occupation was unavailable (20%) ( Goodman et al., 2010 ). In G2, the occupation of the household head was used to assess parental SEP. Data on G1's parental occupation were derived from obstetric and school records, and from the population and housing census of 1930 ( Axelsson and Wisselgren, 2016 ) while G2's parental occupational data came from the census of 1960. Drawing on the Swedish socioeconomic classification ( Statistics Sweden, 1983 ), we classified the occupational categories into three socioeconomic groups in both generations: high (self-employed professionals; the non-manual workers at upper and intermediate levels), medium (lower non-manuals; military; farmers; self-employed excluding professionals), and low (skilled and unskilled workers; parents with no occupation).
Data on birthweight, gestational length, and ponderal index came from obstetric records. Gestational length was ascertained by the date of the mother's last menstrual period , and the weeks of gestation were classified into three categories: preterm (birth before the completed 37th week of gestation), term (birth between 37 and 41 weeks of gestation), and post-term (birth after 41 weeks of gestation). Birthweight was standardized for gestational weeks for men and women separately. In G1, we mainly used an internal reference based on the observed mean and standard deviation of the cohort member's birthweight within a given gestational week ( Juárez et al., 2016 ) while the standardization of birthweight in G2 was based on national data from the Swedish Medical Birth Register in 1973–1978. The ponderal index was a measure of thinness at birth and was defined as: birthweight (kg)/length at birth (m) 3 ( Fay et al., 1991 ). Standardized birthweight and ponderal index were analyzed as both continuous measures and quintiles. For mediation analysis, we dichotomized standardized birthweight using the median as a cut-off point. In the same context, we dichotomized parental SEP by merging the low and medium groups into a single category.
Archived obstetric records also provided information on the following maternal characteristics: maternal age at childbirth (<25, 25–29, 30–34, and ≥35), maternal marital status (married and others including single, divorced, and widowed), and parity (1, 2, and ≥3). The early life characteristics of G1 (that were partly derived from the adult social characteristics of G0) were further used to investigate the transgenerational associations, as shown in Fig. 1 .
Two main social mediators used in the study were own educational attainment and average lifetime income. The population censuses, the education register, and the Longitudinal integrated database for health insurance and labor market studies (LISA) ( Ludvigsson et al., 2019 ) available until 2008 provided data on education. The highest lifetime education achieved at age 21 and above was recorded, and was classified into three levels: high (post-secondary ≥3 years; post-graduate), medium (upper secondary; post-secondary <3 years), and low (<upper secondary). Income data was available in Census (1970), and then in LISA yearly from 1990 to 2008. Disposable income equivalised for family composition was standardized each calendar year by age and sex and then averaged across all available calendar years in which the descendant was aged 21–65 years ( Lawson et al., 2013 ). Income was used as tertiles in the analysis.
Supplementary analysis also included occupation as a mediator in G1 only, as the younger members of G2 were not old enough for registration of occupational attainment in the latest census (conducted in 1990) with available occupational data. Information on G1 occupation was derived from Census (1960) and was grouped into three socioeconomic classes: high, medium, and low.
Other measures used as controls in the study were year of birth (continuous), sex (male and female), and a dummy ‘generation’ variable (G1 and G2) indicating two historical periods.
Analyses were carried out using Stata version 15.0. The distribution of IHD events by early life exposures is presented as counts and rates. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of the exposure-outcome associations and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with age as the underlying time scale. Robust standard errors were estimated to deal with intra-cluster correlations between siblings born to the same biological mother. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated within each generation by the Schoenfeld residuals method. The global trend tests suggested no evidence of violation of the proportionality assumption in either generation. The statistical analyses were carried out at three stages:
To address the first aim, we examined whether the associations between early life exposures and adult IHD significantly differ across generations. The Cox regression models were fitted separately for each exposure variable, including an exposure*generation interaction term in each model in addition to the relevant confounders. The analyses were stratified by sex while birth year was additionally controlled for to take into account the potential period effects. The interaction effect represents the ratio of the HRs in the two generations and a statistically significant interaction effect would imply a change in the magnitude of the association. The generation-specific HRs and CIs of the associations were obtained in post-estimation by combining the main effects and interaction effects, using the ‘lincom’ command in Stata. Lincom is a shorthand for linear combinations of parameters and a powerful postestimation tool for displaying any linear expression of the coefficients and its standard errors after fitting a regression model. We combined the coefficients of interest on the original scale i.e., log hazard ratios and then exponentiated them, using the following command: lincom exposure + exposure#generation, eform . Moreover, the overall significance of the associations with more than one parameter was assessed by Wald test.
To address the second aim, the mediation analysis examining the role of education and income in the associations between early life exposures and adult IHD was carried out separately for each generation and sex. The total effects of the two binary exposures – standardized birthweight and parental SEP - were decomposed into natural direct and indirect effects, using a counterfactual method of mediation known as Inverse Odds Weights (IOW) ( Tchetgen Tchetgen, 2013 ). The mediation analysis began by fitting a logistic regression model where the exposure was entered as an outcome and all mediators and confounders as exposures. The inverse of the predicted odds derived from the logistic model was used to generate the IOWs which were later entered in a Cox model to estimate the natural direct effect. The natural indirect effect was obtained by taking the difference between the total effect and the direct effect. The details of the estimation procedure together with the Stata code are available elsewhere ( Nguyen et al., 2015 ; Hossin et al., 2019 ).
For the third aim, the transgenerational analysis documenting the associations of grandparental and parental exposures with offspring's adult IHD was stratified by sex of the parents. The robustness of these associations (aim four) was assessed by controlling for potential confounders as well as mediators in a series of Cox regression models in which offspring age was used as the time scale. For an exposure with more than two categories, Wald test was performed to assess the significance of the overall association.
As our G2 sample excluded individuals whose parents were not resident in the Uppsala region, we explored if the available socioeconomic characteristics differ between the study sample born in Uppsala and the excluded group. Given that data on parental SEP and IHD was available for the entire G2 population, we utilized this information in a sensitivity analysis to further investigate the parental SEP-IHD association in the whole G2 population. To assess the possibility of genetic confounding in the relationship between birthweight and IHD, we explored if offspring birthweight was associated with father's and mother's IHD ( Davey Smith et al., 2007 ). Besides, for more valid assessment of the changes in the estimated associations across generations, we repeated the relevant analyses by restricting the G2 sample to those born between 1946 and 1960.

Section: 3. Results

During the 45-year follow up period from January 1, 1964 to December 31, 2008, a total of 2159 IHD events were recorded in G1 and 310 events in G2. The IHD distribution was dominated by acute myocardial infarctions which represented almost 54% of the total events in G1 and 46% of the total events in G2. The age-specific hazard rates of IHD did not differ considerably between generations ( Figure S1 ). Table 1 further shows that the age-adjusted rates of IHD was relatively high among individuals with lower parental SEP and at the lower ends of the distributions of standardized birthweight and ponderal index.

The distribution of the exposure variables across the two generations are shown in Figure S2 . In both sexes, there was an evidence of upward intergenerational social mobility from low and medium parental SEPs to high parental SEP. The average birthweight slightly increased while the proportion of preterm births fell to some extent in both sexes. The available socioeconomic characteristics and incident IHD of the studied G2 sample are compared with those of the excluded sample in Table S1 .
The generational changes in the associations between early life exposures and adult onset of IHD for males and females are presented in Table 2 and Table 3 , respectively. Among the males, the quintiles of standardized birthweight were associated with IHD in a linear fashion in both generations, as suggested by the p-values for trend. Each standard deviation unit increase in standardized birthweight decreased the hazards of IHD by 9% in G1 and 16% in G2. Controlling for parental SEP did not affect the strength of the association. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of potential genetic confounding revealed no association between offspring birthweight and fathers' IHD, but an association was detected with mothers’ IHD (data not shown). Despite an apparently stronger association between birthweight and IHD in G2, the test for interaction suggests that the HRs in the two generations were not statistically different (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80–1.08). Among the females, the association did not reach statistical significance in any generation. Table 2 .

The ponderal index and length of gestation did not show any association with IHD. Low parental SEP in G1 was associated with 22% increased rate of IHD in males and 38% increased rate in females when compared to high parental SEP. The corresponding association between parental SEP and IHD in G2 was significant in females but not in males (p-value for interaction between parental SEP and sex in G2: <0.05). However, the association showed no significant change over generations, neither in males nor in females ( Table 2 , Table 3 ). The stability of the association was further observed when compared between G1 and the pooled G2 born in or outside Uppsala. As shown in Table S2 , the low versus high parental SEP among the males was associated with 1.24 times higher rate of IHD in G1 (95% CI: 1.02–1.51) compared to 1.19 times higher rate in G2 (95% CI: 0.99–1.43). Among the females, the effect size was estimated to be an HR of 1.35 in both generations. Moreover, the persistence of the studied associations across generations held when the analyses were repeated restricting G2's year of birth to the period 1946–1965 ( Table S3 and Table S4 ).
Table 4 displays the extent to which the total effects of the two binary exposures - standardized birthweight and parental SEP - on incident IHD is mediated by education and income. We found that the association between standardized birthweight and adult IHD in the two generations was robust when accounting for education and income ( Table 4 ) as well as for occupation which was additionally included as a mediator in G1 ( Table S5 ). As for the association between parental SEP and adult IHD in G1, an estimated 45% of the total effect in males was mediated by education and income altogether while the total effect in females, although non-significant, was almost fully mediated. The estimated proportion mediated among the G2 females was 24% ( Table 4 ). Table 4 .

The associations linking grandparental and parental characteristics to offspring's adult IHD are shown in Tables 5 and 6 , separately along paternal and maternal lineages . We found that offspring with fathers born preterm had 1.78 times greater rate of IHD compared to those with fathers born at term. Paternal grandmother's age at the time of father's birth showed a U-shaped association with offspring's adult IHD. That is, offspring whose paternal grandmothers gave birth at younger or older ages had higher IHD rates ( Table 5 ). Along the maternal lineage, the elevated IHD incidence was significant in the offspring with younger aged grandmothers ( Table 6 ). Furthermore, an association was found between maternal grandfather's SEP and offspring IHD, with a 1.65-fold increased rate of IHD in individuals born to mothers with low parental SEP. The corresponding increased rate of IHD in the offspring of fathers with low parental SEP did not reach statistical significance. Adjustments for parents' education, income, and IHD history did not considerably affect the strengths of the estimated associations ( Table 5 , Table 6 ). The associations persisted when offspring's birth characteristics and adult socioeconomic circumstances were adjusted for (data not shown). Table 5 .

Section: 4. Discussion

A major aim of the study was to compare two generations that largely represent two different historical contexts, with the older generation being born and grown up in poorer and less egalitarian socioeconomic conditions. The main finding was that the magnitude of the estimated inequalities in IHD remained principally unchanged, even though a majority of the younger generation benefited from better and more equitable socioeconomic conditions. Further, our transgenerational analysis based on data from grandparents, parents, and offspring documented increased risks of offspring IHD associated with younger and older grandmother's age at parental birth, with a history of socioeconomic disadvantage in the family, and with paternal premature birth .
In line with the past single-generation studies ( Risnes et al., 2011 ), we found an inverse dose-response association between birthweight for gestational age and the incidence of adult IHD in both generations. Low birthweight can be a function of fetal growth retardation and lower gestational age ( Andersen and Osler, 2004 ; Wilcox, 2001 ). The association between birthweight and adult IHD in this study persisted when gestational age and parental SEP at birth were taken into account. If genes were the common causes of both birthweight and IHD, one would find offspring birthweight associated with the IHD of parents as well ( Davey Smith et al., 2007 ). Such an association in fathers is more likely to be explained by genetics than environment, unlike an association in mothers that can be driven by both intra-uterine environment and genetic determinants. In our sensitivity analysis, the finding of an association in mothers and absence of such association in fathers is compatible with the existing body of literature ( Davey Smith et al., 2007 ; Naess et al., 2013 ; Shaikh et al., 2018 ). We therefore conclude that the estimated association between standardized birthweight and adult IHD primarily reflects intrauterine growth restriction.
While ponderal index is sometimes claimed to be a more reliable indicator of intrauterine growth retardation than birthweight for gestational age ( Fay et al., 1991 ), we found no association between ponderal index and IHD in the present study. This finding contrasts with a few earlier studies that reported associations between ponderal index and cardiovascular disease outcomes among the men ( Barker et al., 1993b ; Forsén et al., 1997 ; Kajantie et al., 2005 ). The reported associations in previous studies were possibly susceptible to confounding biases due to, for instance, the severity of growth restriction. Research has shown that body disproportionality may have greater variations among the growth retarded infants compared to their normal growth counterparts of similar birth weight ( Kramer et al., 1989 ). Such confounding was illustrated in a study by Leon and colleagues ( Leon et al., 1998 ) who found that the association between ponderal index and IHD disappeared once birthweight for gestational age was taken into account.
We observed a greater risk of adult IHD associated with disadvantaged socioeconomic background at birth. The magnitude of the association did not differ between the two generations. This finding is in agreement with a Danish study of men born in 1953 and their parental generation that demonstrated a consistent association between parental social class and own adult mortality across the two generations ( Osler et al., 2005 ). Despite policy efforts to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in childhood, their persistent impact implies that the major mechanisms through which such inequalities affect health might have changed across generations ( Mackenbach, 2010 ). Similarly, the strength of the association between standardized birthweight and IHD did not show any decline in the younger generation of our study. Although the standard of living and nutritional conditions in Sweden has substantially improved over time ( Sundin and Willner, 2007 ), the generally consistent impact of birthweight on IHD across generations might be partly attributed to the compositional changes of the determinants of fetal growth ( Koupilova et al., 2000 ; Kramer et al., 2002 ). It is likely that the rise of pregnancy complications (e.g., excessive gestational weight gain and gestational diabetes) have become more common causes of variation in fetal growth in the more recent period ( Kramer et al., 2002 ). Besides, impaired fetal growth might operate predominantly through latent biological pathways to affect health in later life given that its effect was not mediated by adult socioeconomic circumstances.
The transgenerational analyses showed that children whose grandparents had disadvantaged SEP were at greater risk of developing IHD compared to those whose grandparents were socioeconomically advantaged. We also found that grandmother's age at parental birth was associated with offspring's IHD in a U-shaped fashion which was more clearly evident along the paternal lineage . Early motherhood may reflect social disadvantages and physiological immaturity which may cause permanent physiological alterations to the pregnant mother, with far reaching implications for maternal and child health ( Duncan et al., 2018 ). Advanced maternal age , on the other hand, might affect child health through diminished physiological health of the gestating mother ( Liu et al., 2011 ). Moreover, younger and older maternal ages might be associated with differential parenting practices and suboptimal social environment in early years of life ( Bornstein et al., 2006 ). Intriguingly, maternal age at delivery was not associated with the immediate offspring's IHD risk in our data, although it considerably affected the descendants' risk of IHD further down the line.
Unlike the recent Swedish study conducted on a younger cohort born 1973–1994 ( Crump et al., 2019 ), we did not find any relationship between preterm birth and IHD in any generation. However, we found an association between father's preterm birth and offspring's IHD, while no association was observed via the maternal lineage . In a recently published study on the same generations ( Hossin et al., 2020 ), we demonstrated an identical association between father's preterm birth and offspring's adult socioeconomic achievement.
Although the mechanisms to explain the transgenerational associations are not clearly known, our results are partly in accord with the Överkalix studies linking all-cause and cardiovascular mortality of grandchildren to food supply during ancestors’ prepuberty period ( Bygren et al., 2001 , 2014 ; Kaati et al., 2002 ). As parental socioeconomic conditions in our study were not on the causal pathways, we believe the underlying causal processes might involve epigenetic mechanisms . The idea of the environmental basis of transgenerational inheritance has a long root in the work of the classical evolutionary biologists including Lamarck and Darwin ( Skinner, 2015 ; Penny, 2015 ). Yet, the molecular mechanisms through which environmentally induced epigenetic information are carried forward across generations have only recently begun to be understood. Multiple epigenetic routes including DNA methylation , histone modifications , and changes in small non-coding RNAs have been implicated ( Skinner, 2015 ; Gluckman et al., 2009 ; Vo and Hardy, 2012 ; Pembrey et al., 2014 ). For epigenetic inheritance to occur trans-generationally, a recent line of thought in evolutionary biology postulates misregulation in the germline , either during the early embryonic period or during the slow growth period in childhood ( Pembrey et al., 2014 ; Anway and Skinner, 2008 ; Skinner et al., 2010 ). The transfer of epigenetic information can be better understood along the paternal lineage since it effectively eliminates confounding associated with the maternal in-utero environment ( Pembrey et al., 2014 ; Cheong et al., 2016 ). Rodent experiments have shown that adverse early life experiences such as maternal stress or modulated maternal diet alter DNA methylation patterns in the germline of the male offspring. These alterations are maintained and partly transmitted to the future generations in a complex and sex-specific manner, predisposing them to increased disease risks ( Franklin et al., 2010 ; Dunn and Bale, 2011 ; Burdge et al., 2007 ).
The observed transgenerational associations in our data need cautious interpretations. True transgenerational inheritance would be plausible if G0's environmental exposures subsequently affected G1 germ cells during the pre-puberty period (due to G1's suboptimal somatic development in the utero, for example). Contrarily, if G0 exposures instead altered G1's primordial germ cells during embryonic development , G2 germline would also be directly exposed to the same environmental influences. In the latter case, a definitive evidence for the germ-line mediated epigenetic inheritance would require further examination of adult onset disease phenotypes in the next generation G3 ( Skinner, 2008 ). It is, therefore, safer to interpret the results as “transgenerational epigenetic effects”, a term which, unlike “transgenerational epigenetic inheritance”, is agnostic to the underlying mechanisms ( Youngson and Whitelaw, 2008 ). As our limited knowledge of transgenerational inheritance primarily comes from plants and mammalian studies ( Skinner, 2014 ), the novel findings of the current study should stimulate further investigations around transgenerational fetal programming of adult diseases in humans.
While our study populations were geographically restricted to the Uppsala region, the G1 population largely represent the broader Swedish population in terms of infant mortality and fertility rates in that period ( Rajaleid et al., 2008 ). As for G2, the results would be susceptible to bias if both the early life exposures and the IHD outcome differed between the subpopulations born in versus out of Uppsala. Although the average socioeconomic profile of the Uppsala-based G2 sample was somewhat lower, the risk of their IHD was not significantly different from the excluded group ( Table S1 ). Therefore, the exclusion of G2 subjects born outside Uppsala is unlikely to alter our conclusions (see also Table S2 ). However, to draw a more valid inference of any changes in the associations across historical periods, it would be more appropriate to compare two successive cohorts that are biologically unrelated to each other.
The hospitalized cases of IHD were derived from the Swedish hospital discharge registry which was initiated in 1964 in Uppsala and was gradually expanded until 1987 to cover the whole of Sweden ( Ludvigsson et al., 2011 ; Rajaleid et al., 2009 ). This may lead to misclassification of the outcome, with less sensitivity in the older generation. On the other hand,there was a shorter follow-up time and fewer cases in G2 relative to G1. Although we took this into account in our study design and restricted the upper age at follow-up to make the age at follow-up comparable, the relatively low statistical power in G2 precluded us from exploring whether the transgenerational associations were modified by the sex of the offspring. A further weakness was the determination of gestational age by last menstrual period which may overestimate the gestational age compared to ultrasound estimation ( Savitz et al., 2002 ), although the latter is not without its limitations either ( Skalkidou et al., 2010 ).
Despite weaknesses, our data allowed us to account for gestational age and parental SEP in the birthweight-IHD association and to explore additionally the potential confounding role of genetics. With the comparable and consistent indicators of early life socioeconomic and biological disadvantages across two generations, the current study had a unique advantage to assess the historical changes in the magnitude of health inequalities originating in early life. A further strength is the decomposition of generation-specific associations into natural direct and indirect effects within the inverse odds weighting framework which effectively handles exposure-mediator and mediator-mediator interactions ( Nguyen et al., 2015 ; Hossin et al., 2019 ). Importantly, the study adds to the scant evidence of transgenerational epigenetic effects in humans by systematically linking the grandparental and parental disadvantages on descendant health along both paternal and maternal lines.

Section: 5. Conclusions

We found persistent IHD inequalities by early life socioeconomic background and impaired fetal growth over time. The estimated inequalities generally persisted irrespective of historical contexts and adult socioeconomic circumstances. We also found that certain prenatal and perinatal disadvantages continue to affect the descendants’ health via paternal and/or maternal lines. While mechanisms remain elusive, interventions targeted to optimising health and living conditions during critical periods of development and growth are crucial to prevent the transmission of fetal programming effects across multiple generations. Further research is warranted to confirm evidence of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of adult disease phenotypes and to uncover the mechanisms.
