Title: The role of financial conditions for physical and mental health. Evidence from a longitudinal survey and insurance claims data


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that financial conditions are influential for mental health and might contribute to physical health outcomes.

Abstract_Section: Methods

Using longitudinal survey data and health insurance claims data from 1209 employees in a large U.S. health insurance company, we examined temporal associations between measures of financial safety, financial capability, financial distress, their summary index (financial security) and six subsequently measured mental and physical health outcomes.

Abstract_Section: Results

We found that financial safety and financial capability were positively associated, while financial distress was negatively associated, with subsequent self-reported measures of physical and mental health, even after controlling for these health measures at baseline and other confounders. Additionally, financial conditions were associated with reduced risk of depression based on health insurance claims data. Financial safety was also associated with anxiety.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Policy-makers might consider the introduction of more effective measures for ensuring favorable financial conditions as an important contributor to better population health. Furthermore, policy could encourage teaching adequate financial management techniques and the importance of understanding of long-term consequences of financial decisions, as those might be pivotal for health outcomes.

Section: 1. Introduction

A substantial body of literature has already established a detrimental relationship between poor financial conditions and mental health ( Dean et al., 2018 ; Dean and Nicholas, 2018 ; Houle et al., 2015 ; Israel et al., 2014 ). Financial hardship, including unsecured debt, leads to lower sleep quality ( Ferreira et al., 2021 ) and decreased life satisfaction ( Bialowolski and Weziak-Bialowolska, 2021 ). It contributes to mental disorders ( Richardson et al., 2013 ) culminating in suicidal thoughts and ideation ( Turunen and Hiilamo, 2014 ). The effects are particularly pronounced among vulnerable populations, such as mothers of newborns ( Reading and Reynolds, 2001 ), people at the verge of bankruptcy ( Selenko and Batinic, 2011 ) or those over-indebted ( Białowolski et al., 2019 ). Despite the impact of financial hardship on mental health, the evidence for an association between financial difficulties and subsequent physical health remains limited. Some experimental evidence suggests that financial stress contributes to an increase in reported heath complaints among arthritis patients ( Skinner et al., 2004 ), but these findings were not confirmed among healthy individuals. A difficult financial situation, as reflected in a lower credit score, has been shown to correlate with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease ( Israel et al., 2014 ), but this cross-sectional analysis was unable to address causality.
The association between financial distress and poor health extends beyond the lack of economic resources. It is often that physical stress , experienced by those facing economic difficulties, triggers physiological processes, such as production of cortisol ( Grossi et al., 2001 ; Steptoe et al., 2005 ), which has been already established as an important contributor to various mental health issues including depression ( Burke et al., 2005 ).
In addition to studies on financial distress, research has investigated the positive aspects of financial situations on maintaining and improving health and well-being. A financial cushion in a form of savings protects against negative health and subjective well-being outcomes ( Arber et al., 2014 ; Gupta et al., 2018 ). Based on experimental and observational longitudinal data, the positive impacts of savings were confirmed for emotional health and positive health behaviors ( Białowolski et al., 2019 ; Gubler and Pierce, 2014 ), for improvements in the abnormal blood-test results ( Gubler and Pierce, 2014 ), as well as for making favorable financial choices leading to increased lifelong well-being ( Thaler and Benartzi, 2004 ). Exercising financial control was found to be favorably associated with emotional health outcomes, physical health outcomes, and social well-being outcomes ( Bialowolski et al., 2021 ). Exercising financial control has its underpinnings in financial literacy, which in turn is associated with a decreased risk of mortality ( Stewart et al., 2020 ), higher subsequent psychological well-being ( Yu et al., 2021 ), and positive financial behaviors that, in turn, help to reduce cost-related nonadherence to health regimens ( Patel et al., 2016 ).
Theoretical arguments from positive health and positive psychology ( Kubzansky et al., 2018 ; Seligman, 2008 ; Seligman et al., 2005 ; VanderWeele et al., 2020 ), as well as empirical evidence on various determinants of positive health impacts ( Chen et al., 2019 ; Kim et al., 2017 ; Trudel-Fitzgerald et al., 2019 ; Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ; Węziak-Białowolska et al., 2018 ), suggest that properly executed precautionary financial behaviors, leading to increased financial security and financial capability, may promote well-being and translate into better health outcomes. For example, economic resources may affect health conditions indirectly by granting a healthier life-style ( Molarius et al., 2007 ), which has been shown for savings limiting smoking and promoting sport activities ( Białowolski et al., 2019 ).
While some evidence has been already presented in the previous studies, to the best of our knowledge, evidence of the impacts of financial conditions on health using longitudinal observational data and both self-reported and more objectively-measured health outcomes is still limited. It is worth underscoring that the association between health and one's financial situation may be bidirectional. On the one hand, financial hardship may lead to worsened mental and physical health. On the other hand, those who are sick might lose income and become debt-trapped. Using longitudinal data with repeated measures can help address residual confounding and reverse causation and provide additional insights into the role of financial conditions for health.
This study uses longitudinal observational data merged with participants' medical insurance claims data and applies an outcome-wide analytical approach ( Pawlikowski et al., 2019 ; VanderWeele, 2017 ; VanderWeele et al., 2020b ) to examine the impact of both positive (i.e., financial safety and financial capability) and negative (i.e., financial distress) aspects of people's financial conditions on a spectrum of physical and mental health outcomes. Financial safety relates to material well-being, whereas financial capability reflects people's ability to manage their money and take control of their finances by making right financial decisions about investing financial resources, as well as managing credit and debt ( Atkinson et al., 2006 ; Taylor et al., 2011 ). Financial distress is understood as an adverse financial condition and involves worry about debt ( Białowolski and Węziak-Białowolska, 2014 ; Prawitz et al., 2006 ). These three concepts are reflected in the financial security domain of the Well-Being Assessment ( Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ). In our analysis we consider multiple health outcomes – both self-reported and measured by the diagnostic information from the health insurance claims data, including clinical diagnosis of anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular disease, as well as heart disease risk factors identified by a medical specialist.

Section: 2. Methods

We used two waves of data from the Well-Being Survey reported by a random sample of employees of a large, national employer based in the United States. The company – being among the 100 largest public companies in the US – operates principally in the market of health insurance serving a range of sectors, including education, government, technology, private business, and healthcare. It has operated for more than 100 years, with corporate offices is several regions of the U.S. The company's yearly revenue amounts to $60 B with profits of $3.5 B. The workforce consists mostly of white-collar employees.
Study participants were randomly sampled. The invitation and reminders to participate were sent to 15,000 employees in June 2018 through the work email system. 2364 respondents (response rate of 15.8%) participated in the first wave. The same individuals were subsequently invited to participate in the second wave of the study in July 2019. 1209 respondents participated in both waves and their records were included in the primary analysis. The retention rate from wave 1 was 51.2%. In the panel sample, consistent with the largely female workforce at the organization ( Lee et al., 2021 ), females accounted for 84.5% vs. 74.5% for the entire target population (p < 0.001). The mean age of participants was 43.5 years in the sample vs. 45.6 in the target population (p < 0.001). Participants were mostly white, relatively well-educated, office employees, which was also consistent with the structure of employees in the target population. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics at baseline. Table 1 . Participant characteristics at study baseline (N = 1209).

The Well-Being Survey was designed to comprehensively assess employee well-being in general and while at work. Data collection was preceded by a communication campaign one week prior to the survey administration to invite employees to participate in the survey. A cash prize ranging from $100 to $1000 was offered as an incentive to 52 randomly selected participants. The survey was administered online to give participants a secure, anonymous space to report on sensitive health topics.
All current employees at least 18 years of age were eligible to participate in the survey. Participation was voluntary and confidential. Informed written consent was obtained from the participants. All protocols for recruitment and participation were reviewed and approved by the Harvard Longwood Campus Institutional Review Board.
The survey data of 1209 participants were merged with health insurance data covering the period 2017–2019. Health insurance data shared by the employer comprised diagnostic information on selected medical conditions and provided treatments, along with financial measures such as billed amounts and patient cost sharing. This kind of diagnostic information from the insurance claims data has been shown to closely reflect actual medical records ( Quam et al., 1993 ; Tyree et al., 2006 ). The health conditions were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) ( WHO, 2004 ).
Self-reported Health Outcomes. We used two self-reported health outcomes from the Flourishing Index ( VanderWeele, 2017 ; VanderWeele et al., 2019 ; Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2019 ) and from an expanded measure of well-being based on this Index ( Lee et al., 2021 , Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ). The first one referred to physical health [In general, how would you rate your physical health? (0 = poor and 10 = excellent)], while the second assessed mental health [In general, how would you rate your mental health? (0 = poor and 10 = excellent)].
Objective Health Outcomes. Two outcomes (i.e., number of heart disease risk factors [diabetes, hypertension, metabolic syndrome , obesity, unhealthy blood cholesterol – HDL and LDL – levels] and a diagnosed cardiovascular disease) derived from participants’ medical insurance claims data served as measures of individual physical health. Additionally, two objective mental health outcomes (i.e., clinical diagnosis of depression and of anxiety) were also examined.
Financial safety. Four items addressing material well-being, secure standard of living and financial freedom were used: (1) I am able to meet my normal monthly living expenses without any difficulty [modified from ( Prawitz et al., 2006 )], (2) I have sufficient savings that I could cover six months of expenses [an often-adapted threshold for financial security ( Scott et al., 2013 )]; (3) My financial circumstances give me freedom to pursue my goals, and (4) I have money left over at the end of the month that I save or invest ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2017 ). All were measured on an 11-point scale (0 = Strongly disagree, 10 = Strongly agree) and were also included in the comprehensive well-being assessment ( Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ).
Financial capability. Financial capability reflects people's ability to manage their money and take control of their finances by making right financial planning regarding investing financial resources, as well as managing credit and debt ( Atkinson et al., 2006 ; Taylor et al., 2011 ). Consequently, one question from the comprehensive well-being assessment ( Weziak‐Bialowolska et al., 2021 ) was used to measure financial capability: Given my age, I have done adequate financial planning for the future. This was also measured on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (Strongly disagree) to 10 (Strongly agree).
Financial distress. Two questions were used to measure financial distress understood as an adverse financial condition and involving worrying about debt ( Prawitz et al., 2006 ): (1) The amount of debt I have often overwhelms me (0 = Strongly disagree, 10 = Strongly agree), and (2) How often do you worry about food, housing, or health expenses? (0 = Do not ever worry, 10 = Worry all of the time) (modified from VanderWeele et al., 2019 ).
Financial security. We also included in the analysis a summary measure of financial safety, capability, and distress. This composite measure of financial security represents self-assessments of sufficient financial resources and financial capabilities to be able to pursue one's life goals and plan for the future without excessive worry about making ends meet ( Roll et al., 2021 ; Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ). It is a composite of seven items listed in financial safety, financial capability and financial distress domains above. The measure demonstrated satisfactory reliability (alpha = 0.911), test–retest correlation (r = 0.833), convergent/discriminant validity in relation to stability over time and relevant health measures, as well as a good fit to the data that was invariant over time, and across gender, age, education and marital status ( Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ).
We used a rich set of control variables already established as influencing changes in health. Specifically, we controlled for demographics [gender (male vs. female), age (≤30, 31–40, 41–50, and >50), race (white, black/African American, other), educational attainment (high school, some college, associate degree, bachelor's degree, graduate degree), marital status (married vs. not married), presence of children at home (yes vs. no), and taking care of an elderly (yes vs. no)] and wealth and income [owning a house (yes vs. no) and salary (the mid-point salary bands obtained from the human resource department of the employer)]. We also controlled for community and civic engagement [(voting in the last elections (yes vs. no/not registered voter), religious service attendance (at least once a week, less than once a week, never), spiritual practices (at least once a week, less than once a week, never), volunteering (at least once a week, less than once a week, never), and community work (at least once a week, less than once a week, never)]. Finally, we controlled for work characteristics: number of work hours, supervisor support [‘My supervisor supports me’ (0–10)], job fit [‘At work, I am able to do what I am good at’ (0–10)], job control [‘I have a lot of freedom to decide how to do my job’ (0–10)], job demand [‘I have too much to do at work to do a good job’ (0–10)], and job meaning [‘I find my work meaningful’ (0–10)]. As two waves of survey data were available, the variables used as controls were measured in the first wave. Additionally, in each regression, the outcome that was used in the follow-up wave was also controlled using its baseline value to further reduce the risk of reverse causation. In particular, in the case of self-reported health outcomes, we controlled for the baseline outcome value from the first wave (since only two waves of survey data were available). In the case of objective health outcomes, control was made for an outcome prior to exposure.
We used longitudinal data to provide more robust evidence on a potential causal link between people's financial situation and health. A set of separate regression models was used to regress each health outcome at a follow-up wave on each financial condition exposure at baseline, adjusting for covariates (including the baseline value of the outcome variable and the number of diagnosed health conditions to control for the history of diseases, as described in the Control variables section). Logistic regression was used for dichotomous outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes. Odds ratios (for dichotomous outcomes) and standardized regression estimates (betas; for continuous outcomes) were provided to report standardized effect sizes. All continuous outcomes were standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), so that the effect estimates were reported in terms of standard deviations of the outcome variables. Complete case analysis was conducted. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing.
To provide evidence for the robustness of the results, a series of sensitivity checks was conducted. First, we ran a set of supplementary analyses (presented in the Supplementary Material). Specifically, for four regressions of diagnosed conditions (i.e., depression, anxiety, health risk factor, and cardiovascular disease based on the medical insurance claims) supplementary analyses were conducted on a restricted sample of those who did not experience the examined health condition prior to exposure (as opposed to the primary analysis run on the entire sample controlling for the baseline outcomes in the case of self-reported health outcomes, and for the outcomes prior to exposure in the case of medical records outcomes; Supplementary Material Table A1 ). Next, two additional sets of controls were added to the primary set of analyses: (1) an alternate overall 2018 well-being index excluding the financial security domain in 2018 ( Supplementary Material Table A2 ); (2) all five well-being domain-specific scores in 2018 (excluding the financial security specific domain score; Supplementary Material Table A3 ). Subsequently, since our use of an extensive set of controls might have contributed to overfitting the models, we validated them by rerunning the primary analyses excluding some sets of confounders ( Supplementary Material Table A4 ). For each health outcome, two additional models were considered. Model 1 controlled only for demographics, wealth, and income. Model 2 still controlled for reduced number of variables than the baseline model but with respect to Model 1 it additionally added community and civic engagement. Both models also controlled for the history of disease to limit the risk of reverse causation. Further, the primary set of analyses was rerun on the imputed dataset to examine the robustness of the results to the attrition between the baseline and the follow-up wave ( Supplementary Material Table A5 ). In the imputation procedure, chained equations were used ( Lloyd et al., 2013 ; White et al., 2011 ) and 10 datasets were generated. Additionally, the multiple imputation estimates pooled using the Rubin's rule ( Rubin, 1987 ) are presented. Finally, the effects of financial conditions on depression and anxiety were examined by employing the survey question about depression and anxiety instead of clinical diagnoses derived from the health care insurance data ( Supplementary Material Table A6 ).
Second, robustness against unmeasured confounding was examined by conducting a sensitivity check with E-values – a measure that assesses the extent to which an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the exposure and the outcome to explain away the observed temporal association ( VanderWeele and Ding, 2017 ). Specifically, the E-value reports how strongly an unmeasured confounder would have to be associated with both the outcome and the exposure/independent variable on the risk ratio scale for the estimate or the confidence interval to be reduced to the null.
Analyses were performed using Stata 15.

Section: 3. Results

Between 2018 and 2019 participants improved in terms of self-assessed physical health (p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). Yet, no improvement in self-reported mental health was noted (p = 0.094). The incidence of diagnosed depression but not of diagnosed anxiety increased across the 2017–2019 period. The number of respondents with diagnosed heart disease risk factors increased between 2017 and 2018 and subsequently decreased in 2019 to a level below that observed in 2017. No changes in prevalence of cardiovascular diseases were noted. Table 2 . Participant characteristics according to financial conditions and health outcomes (N = 1209).

Most changes in the financial conditions of study participants were positive. Financial safety and financial capability improved between 2018 and 2019, while financial distress declined as measured by the perception of the amount of debt participants have. However, no changes were noted in the frequency of worrying about food, housing, or health expenses. Overall, financial conditions, as measured by a summary index of financial security, improved between 2018 and 2019.
Each financial safety item was found to be associated with the subsequent self-reports of mental health ( Table 3 , left panel). Specifically, each standard deviation increase in financial safety was associated with an increase of at least 0.088 standard deviation in self-assessed mental health (for ‘I have money left over at the end of the month that I save or invest’; β = 0.088, 95% CI: 0.035, 0.140; p < 0.0083) with the maximum effect being 0.139 (β = 0.139, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.191; p < 0.001, for ‘I am able to meet my normal monthly living expenses without any difficulty’).

(r) – negatively oriented question; R 2 for multivariate regressions . a A set of regression models was used to regress each outcome on each financial situation exposure separately, to estimate odds ratio (OR) for binary outcomes or β (for continuous outcomes). Each analysis was controlled for demographics (gender, age, race, education, marital status, having children at home, taking care of an elderly), wealth and income (home ownership and salary), community and civic engagement (voting in the last elections, religious service attendance, spiritual practices, volunteering, community work) and work characteristics (number of work hours, supervisor support, job control, job demand and job meaning). These variables were controlled for in the first wave (in the same wave as the exposure), since only two waves of survey data were available. Additionally, in each regression the baseline value of the outcome variable and the number of diagnosed health conditions (ranging from 0 to 37 possible diagnosed health conditions) prior to exposure were included as covariates. b All continuous outcomes, exposures and controls were standardized and β was the standardized effect size. c The number of diagnosed health conditions (ranging from 0 to 37 possible diagnosed health conditions) prior to exposure was not used as a control since it is highly correlated with the outcome prior to exposure which is already used in the regression. d 0 = Completely disagree, 10 = Completely agree. e 0 = Do not ever worry, 10 = Worry all of the time. f As all outcomes from medical records were assessed with logistic regression , reported R 2 is McFadden's R 2 .
Self-reports of physical health were also found to be associated with all financial safety items. The lowest equaled 0.073 (β = 0.073, 95% CI: 0.020, 0.125; p < 0.0083) and was recorded for ‘I have money left over at the end of the month that I save or invest’, whereas the highest reached 0.096 (β = 0.096, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.148; p < 0.001) for the item ‘I am able to meet my normal monthly living expenses without any difficulty.’ Overall, the largest effect size for physical health self-assessment was for the financial capability measure (‘Given my age, I have done adequate financial planning for the future’). It equaled to 0.118 (β = 0.118, 95% CI: 0.065, 0.170; p < 0.001).
Both financial distress items were found to be negatively associated with subsequent self-reports of both mental and physical health with the size effects being β = −0.065 (95% CI: −0.114, −0.016; p < 0.01), and β = −0.083 (95% CI: −0.133, −0.033; p < 0.0083) for an overwhelming amount of debt, and β = −0.033 (95% CI: −0.052, −0.015; p < 0.001) and β = −0.039 (95% CI: −0.057, −0.020; p < 0.001) for worrying about food, housing, or health expenses.
Regarding the summary measure of financial conditions as assessed by the financial security index, this was found to be prospectively associated with both self-reported measures of health, with a larger effect size observed for mental health (β = 0.145, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.198; p < 0.001) than for physical health (β = 0.114, 95% CI: 0.060, 0.168; p < 0.001).
Each financial safety item was found to be associated with the subsequent reduced odds of diagnosed depression ( Table 3 , right panel). After adjusting for covariates, each standard deviation increase in the financial safety question was associated with a 36%–49% reduced odds of subsequent onset o depression. The strongest association was observed for ‘My financial circumstances give me freedom to pursue my goals’ (OR = 0.513, 95% CI: 0.389, 0.677; p < 0.001) and the weakest with having sufficient savings that one could cover six months of expenses (OR = 0.638, 95% CI: 0.483, 0.842; p < 0.0083). We found a 22% reduction in the odds for the onset of anxiety over a one-year follow-up period for one of the financial safety items ‘I am able to meet my normal monthly living expenses without any difficulty’ (OR = 0.777, 95% CI: 0.617, 0.963; p < 0.05).
The measure of financial capability was linked to diagnosed depression. A one standard deviation improvement in the financial capability measure decreased the odds for depression diagnosis in the following year by 38% (OR = 0.622, 95% CI: 0.477, 0.809; p < 0.001). The link between financial conditions and diagnosed depression was corroborated by a prospective association between financial distress and this outcome. After adjusting for covariates, each standard deviation increase in financial distress was associated with a 17%–51% increased odds of subsequent onset of depression, depending on the measure of distress. A weaker link was noted for the financial distress question ‘How often do you worry about food, housing, or health expenses?’ (OR = 1.168, 95% CI: 1.068, 1.278; p < 0.0083), while a much stronger association was evidenced for the second financial distress question ‘The amount of debt I have often overwhelms me’ (OR = 1.508, 95% CI: 1.171, 1.941, p < 0.0083). Finally, each standard deviation increase in our summary financial security index was associated with a 46% reduced odds of subsequent onset of depression.
No significant effects for physical health outcomes (cardiovascular disease, heart disease risk factors) based on health insurance claims records were found for any of the financial conditions’ individual or summary measures. Moreover, all but one measure of financial safety, all measures of financial capability and distress as well as the summary measure of financial security showed no association with diagnosed anxiety after the covariate adjustment.
We conducted four regressions of diagnosed conditions (i.e., diagnosed depression, diagnosed anxiety, diagnosed cardiovascular disease, and diagnosed heart disease risk factor determined from the medical claims data) on a restricted sample of respondents who did not have a history of the respective health condition prior to exposure. The results remained very similar to those obtained analyzing the entire sample ( Table A1 in the Supplementary Material) supporting the robustness of our findings. However, when controlling for the alternate 2018 overall well-being ( Table A2 in the Supplementary Material) and simultaneously for the five domain-specific scores in 2018 ( Table A3 in the Supplementary Material), many of the associations remained in the same direction, but were somewhat attenuated, and with wider confidence intervals. Nevertheless, the general pattern of the significantly protective role of financial safety, financial capability and financial security against diagnosed depression and for improved self-assessed mental health remain discernible.
The secondary analyses with the use of limited sets of controls ( Supplementary Material Table A4 and rerun on the imputed dataset Supplementary Material Table A5 ) showed that the pattern of significant associations remained the same with very comparable effect sizes. The only differences were noted for a few associations with diagnosed anxiety providing evidence that the respective associations presented in the primary analyses were rather conservative. We have additionally confirmed robustness of our results with respect to gender imbalance and above-average incomes of our respondents. Analyses executed with weights correcting for those imbalances yielded similar results as the primary analysis. Finally, the effects of financial conditions on diagnosed depression and diagnosed anxiety were confirmed with the use of the self-reported depression and anxiety measures from the survey with an even larger number of significant effects noted for the link between financial conditions and anxiety ( Supplementary Material Table A6 ).
The robustness of the results was further assessed with E-values – a measure reflecting sensitivity of the results to unmeasured confounding ( Table 4 ). With all of the financial safety, capability, and financial distress indicators that were found to be statistically significant in explaining self-reported mental and physical health measures, there was also evidence that the association between financial indicators and self-reported mental and physical health measures was moderately robust to unmeasured confounding. Specifically, E-values for effect estimates were between 1.21 and 1.53 for the self-reported physical and mental health outcomes. In contrast, there was no significant association between either financial security, financial conditions or financial distress indicators and the number of heart disease risk factors or the occurrence of a cardiovascular disease. However, for diagnosed anxiety and diagnosed depression a number of robust relationships with financial security items was identified. Robustness of prospective associations, as assessed through the E-values, ranged from 1.61 for the link between worry about food, housing, or health expenses and diagnosed depression to 3.31 for the link between financial circumstances giving the freedom to pursue one's goals and diagnosed depression.

For example, in the studied population an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the ability to meet normal monthly living expenses without any difficulty and anxiety by 1.24-fold each, above and beyond the measured covariates, to shift the upper limit of the confidence interval to include the null value for the association between two variables. *See VanderWeele and Ding (2017) for the formula for calculating E-values.

Section: 4. Discussion

We examined the prospective associations between individual health and financial conditions, including its three dimensions – financial safety, financial capability, financial distress – and a summary measure of financial security. We used both self-reported measures of health and objectively measured health outcomes derived from the diagnostic information of the insurance claims data. Since our analyses focused on perceived financial conditions, to provide results independent of the objective financial situation, we controlled for individual incomes (using information on salary bands provided by the employer) as well as a self-reported measure of wealth (i.e., possession of a house). The study results suggest that all measured aspects of financial security were prospectively associated with the risks of diagnosed depression and self-reports of mental health and physical health.
It has been earlier shown that favorable social factors [e.g., social engagement ( Cruwys et al., 2013 ; Min et al., 2016 )], psychological factors [e.g., positive affect, purpose in life ( Chen et al., 2019 ; Wood and Joseph, 2010 )], and behavioral factors [e.g., helping others, being a good person, participating in cultural activities ( Kim et al., 2020 ; Seligman et al., 2005 ; Weziak-Bialowolska et al., 2021 ; Węziak-Białowolska et al., 2018 )] can play a protective role for mental health. Our results provide additional evidence that mental health can be nurtured and protected by subjective financial factors. Specifically, our results suggest that the perception of financial safety and security as well as the perception of financial capability (i.e., ability to make sound financial decisions) play protective roles against depression diagnosis.
Our results complement the findings of Reading and Reynolds (2001) who showed that debt is a correlate of depression. In our study debt-related financial distress was shown to be an independent predictor of depression associated with a 51% increased odds of subsequent onset of depression. Despite earlier evidence on the adverse effects of indebtedness on self-reported anxiety ( Drentea, 2000 ), our results did not provide evidence for such an effect. Instead, we found that the ability to meet monthly expenses may be protective against diagnosed anxiety (23% reduced odds of onset of anxiety with each standard deviation of the measure). Despite prior evidence of a negative association between credit scores and cardiovascular disease ( Israel et al., 2014 ), we did not find associations between financial conditions and either a cardiovascular disease or heart disease risk factors (i.e., physical health outcomes from the insurance claims records), which might indicate that financial conditions that extend beyond income and wealth do not play a role for these outcomes.
Regarding the impact of financial conditions on self-reported health outcomes, this study found temporal effects for both mental and physical health self-reports with a clear indication of a stronger association with the mental health outcome. These effects were present for both favorable and adverse financial conditions with the effect sizes of the protective roles of favorable financial conditions being higher than the effect sizes of the harmful consequences of financial distress. This finding on the asymmetry between the effect sizes of positive and negative financial stimuli was in line with the previously reported findings by Bialowolski et al. (2021) .
Regarding these positive impacts, we corroborated findings previously reported by Gubler and Pierce (2014) , Kim et al. (2003) and Bialowolski et al. (2019) that financial capability (i.e., exercising financial planning) and saving (i.e., feeling financially safe) are prospectively associated with self-reports of mental and physical health as well as the risk of diagnosed depression.
This study adds to the literature on positive health, positive psychology and positive epidemiology ( Kubzansky et al., 2018 ; Seligman, 2008 ; Seligman et al., 2005 ; VanderWeele et al., 2020 ) in the following ways. First, by using both self-reported health outcomes and the diagnostic information of the insurance claims data, our findings provided a broader examination of the role that favorable financial conditions may play in improving health, as well as the role of adverse financial conditions in health deterioration. We also studied an array of exposures and outcomes, thus highlighting associations that may not have been discernible if single outcomes had been examined in separate studies. Second, the longitudinal design and the adjustment for a wide range of covariates allowed us to establish a temporal association. Third, the robustness analyses along with the sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding provided further support for the relationships emerging from our findings.
We note the following limitations. First, even though we used a large number of potential confounders as controls, the evidence for causality relied on the use of observational data. Additionally, this same rich set of controls contributed to the risk of model overfitting. However, the results of our robustness analyses with the reduced sets of controls provided substantial reasurance against this risk. Second, although most of the relationships studied proved to be relatively robust, the results may still be subject to unmeasured confounding by, for example, personality and core self-evaluations ( Curry et al., 2018 ; Huppert, 2009 ). This is more likely for financial worry, which was relatively weakly associated with self-reported mental health and physical health outcomes and diagnosed depression. However, even in the case of the link between financial worry and self-reported physical health, our sensitivity analysis indicated that an unmeasured confounder would have to be relatively strong to explain the effect of the observed temporal associations.
Third, only working adults, mostly female, white, white-collar, well-educated employees, provided data for the analyses. Since labor market status (employed vs. unemployed) as well as type of work (white-, blue- and pink-collar workers), along with other social determinants have proven to be highly influential for health ( Basu et al., 2015 ; Johansson et al., 2020 ; Marmot et al., 1991 ; Thern et al., 2017 ; von Bonsdorff et al., 2012 ), further efforts should be undertaken to replicate the results in either the general population or specific populations not covered by the current study. In a general population it could be possible to study the effects related to changing jobs but also the effects associated with losing employment. Fourth, since our study used self-reports of financial conditions, our findings may be subject to social desirability bias ( Fisher, 1993 ; Fisher and Katz, 2000 ), which might limit the reliability of our results. However, our use of salary data provided by the employer as well as the longitudinal nature of the study provide additional support for the validity of our findings. Finally, the attrition rate between the baseline and the follow-up wave might be of concern. This was likely affected by structural changes that occurred at the company during the period of the study. This affected the size of workforce but was beyond our control. Neverthelles, the robustness analysis conducted on imputed data provided evidence that our results were robust to the pattern of missing data.
Perceptions of financial safety and financial capability are associated with improved health as well as lower risks of ill-health, as shown by earlier findings in previous studies ( Białowolski, 2018 ; Białowolski et al., 2019 ; Michalos et al., 2005 ; Taylor et al., 2011 ). Perception of financial distress has, instead, been shown to contribute to ill-health, especially in the mental health domain ( Archuleta et al., 2013 ; O'Neill et al., 2006 ). Since individual financial conditions are modifiable, policy-makers and practitioners should consider such conditions as important factors for influencing population mental and physical health. The role of financial conditions, including safety, capability, and distress, for mental health may be mitigated by ensuring higher income security and better protection against income shocks . As suggested by Liu (2016) , more equitable access to health insurance might also be a solution because these benefits materialize in reducing the need for using costly income smoothing mechanisms. The issue of financial conditions improvement might be subject to special scrutiny in the U.S., where, due to the weaker welfare state, health effects of a negative income shock tend to be significantly more severe than in other developed countries ( Burgard et al., 2013 ). Positive benefits can be achieved by the promotion of financial literacy (e.g., including in the school curriculum, providing credit counselling), and not merely promoting savings because of the limited effectiveness of such savings in shaping positive health behaviors ( Betz-Hamilton et al., 2019 ; Kim et al., 2003 ; Quigley, 2013 ; Bialowolski et al., 2021 ). Financial literacy improves financial behaviors ( Białowolski et al., 2020 ; Klapper et al., 2013 ) and reduces financial distress, which in turn may affect mental and physical health. This contribution may be direct, as shown by our and other scholars' findings indicating a temporal association between financial distress and diagnosed depression. It may also be indirect since stress in general and financial stress in particular have been shown to contribute to, for example, cardiovascular diseases (see, e.g., Cohen et al., 2015 ; Hare et al., 2013 ; Musselman et al., 1998 ; Tully et al., 2016 ).
