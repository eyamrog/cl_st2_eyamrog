Title: Heterogeneity in preventive behaviors during COVID-19: Health risk, economic insecurity, and slanted information


Abstract: Abstract

The present study examines whether people respond heterogeneously to statewide social distancing mandates as a function of factors that proxy for health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. Using longitudinal data of 7400 American adults between March 10 and June 23, 2020, the study examines social-distancing and mask-wearing behaviors. We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates. The adoption of the behaviors is also polarized between CNN users and Fox News/Social Media users, with greater compliance by the former.

Section: 1. Introduction

In 2020, in the absence of a nationwide mandate, state governments required U.S. residents to engage in preventive behaviors to reduce interpersonal COVID-19 transmission ( Gostin and Wiley, 2020 ). A majority of state governors ordered nonessential business closures (NEBC), such as restaurants, bars, and shopping malls, and discouraged social activities and person-to-person contact by restricting people's access to venues where such behaviors occur ( Adolph et al., 2020 ). Some governors limited social contact by issuing statewide stay-at-home (SAH) orders ( Andersen, 2020 ) that required people to limit their travel to essential journeys (e.g., work, grocery shopping, medical appointments, etc.). Many complied with these policies using social distancing and other preventive measures—the efficacy of which depends on their widespread use ( Courtemanche et al., 2020 )—aware that non-compliance might exacerbate a public health crisis by accelerating the spread of the virus ( Lewnard and Lo, 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ).
Although governments are doubling down on social distancing mandates to combat its spread, some people are likely to resist preventive behaviors, including minimal acts such as wearing face masks, due to COVID-19 fatigue and a growing concern about the economy. In light of the effectiveness of preventive behaviors in flattening the epidemic curve ( Courtemanche et al., 2020 ; Lyu and Wehby, 2020 ), understanding individual characteristics that account for heterogeneity in adopting and maintaining such behaviors is increasingly important as voluntary efforts decline ( López and Rodó, 2020 ). The present study explains why some people are more likely than others to comply with statewide social distancing policies.
Several studies have examined the impact of state restrictions on social distancing behaviors, but their findings are mixed. Using mobility data collected at the state- or county-level, researchers have found evidence for reduced movement after social distancing mandates ( Andersen, 2020 ; Borgonovi and Andrieu, 2020 ; Dave et al., 2020 ; Engle et al., 2020 ; Painter and Qiu, 2020 ). A study by Liu and Mattke (2020) , relying on individual-level self-reported responses, found that state orders intensify risk reduction behavior. People choose to comply with guided behaviors because mandates increase the cost of interacting with others ( Andersen, 2020 ). Other studies find that the observed decline in mobility is better explained by the public's voluntary actions than the mandates ( Glaeser et al., 2020 ; Goolsbee and Syverson, 2020 ; Gupta et al., 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ). Even so, the limited impact of statewide social distancing policies does not imply that these efforts are ineffective ( Wright et al., 2020 ). Rather, it suggests that not all people homogeneously cooperate with government policies ( Abouk and Heydari, 2020 ; Allcott et al., 2020 ; Baker et al., 2020 ; Bruine de Bruin and Bennett, 2020 ; Engle et al., 2020 ; Painter and Qiu, 2020 ).
Optimal decisions about compliance depend on the perceived risk of infection and the severity of the illness ( Papanastasiou et al., 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ). Adopting social distancing behaviors presents health benefits to compliers by reducing not only their infection probability but also by keeping local healthcare services within their capacity, with some valuing such benefits more than others. For example, age is a well-known risk factor associated with developing severe symptoms and even mortality from COVID-19: 80 percent of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. occur to those aged 65 and older ( Lai et al., 2020 ). For this reason, the elderly and those living with them may perceive greater benefits from government policy efforts and cooperate with them more than low-risk groups do.
Nevertheless, statewide social distancing policies are increasingly seen as threats to the economy ( Baker et al., 2020 ; Goolsbee and Syverson, 2020 ; Gormsen and Koijen, 2020 ; Stapleton, 2020 ), especially by those who face greater uncertainty in financial status and a higher chance of economic loss ( Western et al., 2012 ). Quarantine and business closures have led to a dramatic decline in demand and supply ( Bauer et al., 2020 ; Gupta et al., 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ), which may trigger a deep and protracted recession. Since March 2020, more than 60 million unemployment insurance claims have been filed in the U.S. ( Cajner et al., 2020 ). What is more, economic crises disproportionately affect those with preexisting economic insecurities, such as low income, job insecurity ( Watson et al., 2020 ), and inadequate savings ( Roll and Despard, 2020 ).
For those vulnerable to economic insecurity, the perceived costs may outweigh the benefits of statewide social distancing practices and lead to non-compliance. When people feel their employment is threatened, they are more likely to “engage in defensive sensemaking and react more strongly to (a) perceived threat” ( Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984 , p.445). Experience of job loss further leads to behaviors detrimental to health, such as alcohol abuse ( Catalano, 1991 ). Similar perceptional and behavioral patterns may be observed among those with high economic insecurity since such people might see state mandates for social distancing as a threat to their livelihood. Researchers find a class divide in preventive behaviors in which low-income is associated with increased mobility, even after state directives ( Chiou and Tucker, 2020 ), and a reluctance to follow hygienic precautions such as washing hands ( Fan et al., 2020 ). Also, a low socioeconomic status (SES) suggests a lack of resources and information for adequate protection ( Clouston et al., 2020 ). The economically vulnerable may therefore choose not to comply with state social distancing mandates and even engage in resistant behaviors against public health guidelines.
The media is another factor that affects social distancing compliance ( Andersen, 2020 ; Fan et al., 2020 ; Romer and Jamieson, 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ). For information about COVID-19, people usually turn to one or more of three sources—major cable news, local news, and social media. These media use different frames to construe the pandemic's progress and the importance of preventive behaviors. Initially, Republican leaders and the Trump administration played down the seriousness of COVID-19, which slanted coverage by the major cable news networks ( Calvillo et al., 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ). A recent content analysis of COVID-19 news revealed a significant politicization and polarization of information reported in newspapers and broadcasts ( Hart et al., 2020 ). Moreover, misleading or false information about COVID-19, such as conspiracy theories ( Romer and Jamieson, 2020 ), anti-mask advocates, bogus cures, and anti-vaxxers ( Simonov et al., 2020 ), permeates social media. When official information is scarce, distrusted, or confusing, misinformation proliferates ( Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984 ). Compared to the national media, local news networks focus on local cases and deaths and, therefore, shape their greater salience as a community threat.
To counter conflicting information, people try to assess threats to their health and the economy, which shapes their perceptions accordingly ( Greenhalgh and Rosenblatt, 1984 ). They might give credence to information from one media source more than they do to others ( Wright et al., 2020 ). As a result, their compliance behaviors may show distinctive patterns according to their media consumption. Indeed, communities with high CNN viewers show greater cooperation with social distancing behaviors than those with high Fox ratings ( Andersen, 2020 ; Simonov et al., 2020 ).
The present study examines whether individuals respond heterogeneously to state social distancing mandates as a function of individual factors that proxy for health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. Using the UAS COVID-19 longitudinal survey, we analyze five preventive behaviors of 7400 adults between March 10 and June 23: ‘cancel/postpone social activities,’ ‘avoid public gatherings and spaces,’ ‘avoid eating at restaurants,’ ‘visit a doctor,’ and ‘wear a face mask.’ We construct four policy intervention periods to incorporate variations in type and timing of statewide social distancing orders and further control for COVID-19 metrics and individual-fixed effects. With these approaches, we can identify the impact of state mandates on individual behaviors by mitigating possible endogeneity biases.
Our contribution to the growing literature on COVID-19 is three-fold. First, this study examines how people respond heterogeneously to state policies by individual factors. Previous literature investigating the impact of state mandates on social distancing behaviors relied heavily on aggregated mobility data collected at the county level ( Andersen, 2020 ; Borgonovi and Andrieu, 2020 ; Engle et al., 2020 ; Goolsbee and Syverson, 2020 ; Wright et al., 2020 ) or state level ( Abouk and Heydari, 2020 ; Glaeser et al., 2020 ). However, using aggregated data prevents researchers from discovering who is more likely to comply with or voluntarily adopt preventive behaviors. Our research bridges this gap by identifying those factors that predict the adoption of preventive behaviors in compliance with state mandates or voluntarily. The findings highlight the importance of providing supportive resources to relevant population subgroups and delivering trusted information about the significance of preventive behaviors. Through such policy efforts, state governors can encourage greater cooperation with health and safety practices in the event of future pandemics.
Second, we characterize state government policies according to the extent to which they restrict social contact. The existing research that examined the effectiveness of SAH and NEBC generally treated their impact monolithically based on a typical difference-in-difference (DiD) design using an indicator of whether a state government adopts each policy (e.g., Abouk and Heydari, 2020 ; Andersen, 2020 ; Engle et al., 2020 ). However, such policies may have a more nuanced impact on behavior as state actions evolve. Thus, we construct finely-tuned policy measures to differentiate policy periods by the varying interventions for social distancing: NEBC only, SAH only, both SAH and NEBC, and lifting the policies. This process moves beyond assessing state-level restrictions as simple monolithic activities to provide a nuanced assessment of the variations in statewide social distancing efforts. Furthermore, our results on wearing face masks in response to social distancing measures cast light on the spillover effects on preventive behaviors.
Finally, to our knowledge, this research is among the first to examine how preventive behaviors change after policies are lifted. One study finds that state-level mobility and restaurant activities generally rise after lifting SAH orders ( Glaeser et al., 2020 ), but our research extends these findings by examining who is more likely to maintain preventive behaviors even in the absence of policies. Although lifting restrictions may signal that a pandemic is under control and that venturing away from home is safe ( Glaeser et al., 2020 ), the public may not perceive or interpret the signal homogeneously because of preexisting attitudes and beliefs. Some people may still pursue preventive behaviors because they are skeptical of state actions or even see a higher risk after the lift due to the increased social activity of others.

Section: 2. Method

Our identification strategy is to exploit variations across states in the timing of statewide social distancing policies. We use a special case of the difference-in-difference (DiD) design with two staggered sets of statewide policies ( Athey and Imbens, 2018 ; Goodman-Bacon, 2018 ): non-essential business closures (NEBC) and stay-at-home (SAH) orders.
Fig. 1 illustrates the adoption and timing of these two policies across states. Although a few states adopt one of the two ‒ either NEBC only (seven states: case 4) or SAH only (two states: case 6) ‒ a majority adopted both. The most common scenario is case 1: states start implementing NEBC and SAH on the same date, repeal NEBC first and lift SAH later (13 states). Nine states order and lift both restrictions on the same date (case 2). Seven states implement NEBC first and SAH later, lifting both on the same date (case 3) or lifting NEBC first and then SAH (four states: case 5). To account for variations in the implementation of statewide policies, we generate four policy periods as treatments: NEBC only, both NEBC and SAH, SAH only, and SAH lift . In general, NEBC only begins at an early stage of the pandemic, except for three states (cases 7 and 8). Similarly, the period of SAH only generally exists after lifting the NEBC at a later stage of the study period, except for three states (cases 9 and 10). While these six states show atypical sequences of policy interventions, the duration of the NEBC only in the later stage and the SAH only in the early stage lasts for 2 day at most. Moreover, policy efficacy is expected to be minimal when businesses remain closed even after the SAH lift or when people are prohibited from going out before business closures. Therefore, we reclassify the six exceptional states as follows: treating the NEBC only for cases 7 and 8 and the SAH only for cases 9 and 10 as no treatment . We have only 45 observations that fall into these cases. Download: Download high-res image (924KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 . Timing of different state orders. Note.

Based on the identification strategy described above, as a full model, we estimate the staggered DiD model as follows: (1) P B i s t = β 1 N E B C s t + β 2 B O T H s t + β 3 S A H s t + β 4 L I F T s t + β 5 F M s t + β 6 X i t + β 7 C O V I D s t + β 8 C O V I D t + i i + ε i s t where P B i s t denotes whether individual i who resides in state s engages in each of the preventive behaviors on day t . State policy indicators are N E B C s t , B O T H s t , S A H s t , and L I F T s t denoting the distinct policy periods of NEBC only , both NEBC and SAH , SAH only , and SAH lifts in state s in day t . F M s t is an indicator of the period with face mask mandates. While this study focuses on social distancing policies, we include face mask mandates in the model to examine their impact on social distancing behaviors via their own policy mechanisms, such as reducing outdoor activities to avoid wearing masks and increasing the perceived risk of COVID-19. X i t denotes a vector of individual time-variant characteristics associated with decisions for preventive behaviors such as household income, employment, and marital status. C O V I D s t is a vector of the metrics measuring the severity and progression of COVID-19 in state s in day t . C O V I D t indicates a vector of the nationwide daily COVID-19 metrics to account for behavioral changes driven by the pandemic progression at the national level. This metric will capture people's adoption of preventive behaviors even when there are few COVID-19 cases in their community. i i denotes individual-fixed effects. By controlling for the metrics reflecting the national and state-level progress of COVID-19 and individual-fixed effects, we address the potential reverse causality of the state policies. If the implementation of the state mandates is responsive to the national- and state-level COVID-19 surges, the timing of the directives is not entirely random. We expect that our DiD estimates are less likely to be biased, conditional on the national- and state-level progress of COVID-19 and individual fixed effects . ε i s t is the idiosyncratic error term.
We further explore heterogeneous responses in people's preventive behaviors to state policies based on their characteristics using a difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) design. (2) P B i s t = α 1 N E B C s t + α 2 B O T H s t + α 3 S A H s t + α 4 L I F T s t + α 5 F M s t + α 6 C i t + α 7 C i t N E B C s t + α 8 C i t B O T H s t + α 9 C i t S A H s t + α 10 C i t L I F T s t + α 11 C i t F M s t + α 12 X i t + α 13 C O V I D s t + α 14 C O V I D t + i i + ε i s t where C i t denotes time-variant or invariant individual characteristics. These include factors that proxy for health risk for COVID-19 (e.g., age), economic insecurity (e.g., unemployment), and trust in the media (e.g., CNN, Fox). The coefficients of interest are α 7 ~ α 10 .
To explore the impact of statewide social distancing policies on the public's preventive behaviors, the present study merges several data. The unit of analysis is individuals . We primarily use individual-level data from the Understanding America Study (UAS) COVID-19 longitudinal survey. The University of Southern California (USC) administers the online survey of a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 18 or older ( Kapteyn et al., 2020 ). For the few panel members without access to appropriate technology, the UAS provides a tablet and/or an internet subscription ( Kapteyn et al., 2020 ) to reduce sample attribution. Launching the first wave on March 10, the UAS has conducted COVID-19 surveys bi-weekly ( Kapteyn et al., 2020 ). The present study covers six waves from March 10 to June 23.
We then merge state-level data with the UAS individual-level data using the respondent's state of residence. If respondents miss giving this information, we exclude them from our sample. To trace only those behavioral changes contingent upon state policies within the same state over time, we excluded 20 unique individuals who moved to another state during our study period. In total, we have approximately 7403 individuals (individual-wave: 36,345) in our sample. Table 1 provides our sample characteristics. The proportions of female, married, and employed respondents are 0.52, 0.56, and 0.59, respectively. About one third of all respondents have a bachelor's degree or higher. Our sample is comparable to the national population. Based on the 2019 Census data, for those aged 18 or older, 52% were female, 53% were married, 62% were employed, and 33% had a bachelor's degree or higher. Table 1 . Descriptive statistics of sample.

The outcome variables are five preventive behaviors that potentially reduce the risk of transmitting the virus ( P B i s t ). The UAS survey asks whether the respondent has used preventive behaviors to stay safe from infection. Five dummy variables are employed to measure an individual's adoption (coded as one) of each of the following preventive behaviors: canceled or postponed personal or social activities ( limit social activity), avoided public spaces, gatherings, or crowds (avoid public spaces) , refrained from eating at restaurants (limit eating at restaurants), visited a doctor (visit a doctor), and wore a mask or other face-covering (wear a face mask) . The first three behaviors measure social distancing practices that are likely adopted in response to state mandates. Doctor visit is also an alternative indicator of social distancing practices since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends postponing doctor visits unless they are essential. While the survey does not separate essential from nonessential doctor visits, we expect that the number is reduced because of statewide social distancing orders. This study also includes wearing a face mask because it might be affected by statewide social distancing mandates through indirect mechanisms such as an increased awareness of COVID-19 and social norm precautions.
Fig. 2 presents the daily average proportion of the sample adopting each of the five preventive behaviors. It seems that there are considerable variations in preventive behaviors over time. We observe little adoption of the three social distancing behaviors in early March before most states implemented social distancing orders, a sharp increase in adoptions under state orders, and a gradual decrease afterward. The proportion of people visiting a doctor peaks in late March and troughs in early April, and then gradually increases over time. More people wear a mask over time with a rapid increase in April.

The weekly average proportions of the respondents who avoid eating at restaurants and wear a mask are presented by state in Figures A1-A11 in Appendix. We do not visualize the trends for states with less than 100 observations because few outliers distort the trendlines in the small sample states. The shaded areas indicate the period when NEBC or SAH is effective in a given week. A majority of states show similar patterns of these two behaviors to daily national trends as seen in Fig. 2 . Even for states without statewide policies, similar patterns are found (e.g., Nebraska). In some states, upward trends of limiting eating at restaurants begin even before statewide social distancing policies are implemented (e.g., Alabama, Georgia, etc.). These results might be affected by national and/or statewide COVID-19 progression and social distancing policies set by subdivisions of a state government (e.g., county). The effect of statewide social distancing policies is well represented in California, New York, and New Jersey, although there are slight declines in social distancing in later weeks. Mask-wearing generally shows an increasing trend if we disregard non-smoothing patterns caused by a small sample.
To measure state government policy interventions for social distancing, we retrieve information from an OpenICPSR data depository ( Raifman et al., 2020 ). Raifman and her colleagues collected and updated information about state policies such as business closures, stay-at-home orders, reopenings, and mask mandates by reviewing each state government website. The data cover state directives or mandates that apply to the entire state only; they are not guidance or recommendations. To verify the information, we also cross-check other online sources such as state executive directives or orders. The data are merged with the UAS data based on the individual's state of residence. We create four indicators denoting the distinct policy periods of NEBC only, both NEBC and SAH, SAH only , and SAH lifts . An indicator of mask mandates is also controlled.
The present study controls for state-level COVID-19 metrics ( C O V I D s t ). Retrieved from the CDC, we control for the number of daily cumulative cases per 100,000 people across states after taking a log transformation. We also control for new case rates among tested individuals , death rates among positive cases , and days with decreasing case numbers , drawing from the University of Maryland's COVID-19 impact analysis platform ( Maryland Transportation Institute, 2020 ). Using the data from the CDC, nationwide daily COVID-19 metrics ( C O V I D t ) are also controlled for. The metrics include average new case rates for the last seven days , average death rates for the last seven days , and total case rates per 100,000 people .
We further explore whether people's responses in preventive behaviors to state policies systematically differ according to their health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. For health risk factors , we use age and living arrangements . Even if the respondent is at low risk, living with someone at high-risk can influence preventive behaviors. To account for this heterogeneity, we use two indicators of living with children under age 18 and the elderly aged 65 or higher in the household, respectively. Although the risk of serious illness due to COVID-19 is low for children, we consider both living arrangements to test differences in preventive behaviors of those who live with low vs. high-risk individuals. Each of the indicators is coded as one if the respondent lives with children under the age of 18 and the elderly aged 65 or older, and zero otherwise. Among individual-level risk factors, age is time-invariant ( C i ) while living with high vs. low-risk members in the household varies over the study period ( C i t ). All risk factors are retrieved from the UAS COVID-19 survey. An average person in our sample is aged 49. The proportion of our sample living with either a child or a senior is 0.29 and 0.21, respectively.
Related to economic insecurity, we consider health insurance ownership, household income, net worth, and employment status. Using the UAS comprehensive data, as a time-invariant indicator, we code the health insurance ownership variable as one if the person is covered by health insurance provided by current/previous employers, private, or government, and zero otherwise. Slightly more than three quarters of our sample is covered by a health insurance plan. Information about household income is retrieved from the UAS COVID-19 data. The responses consist of 16 categories ranging from less than $5000 to $150,000 or more. We recategorize this variable into four groups to align with quartile measures: $0-$29,999; $30,000-$59,999; $60,000-$99,999; $100,000 or more. The proportions of our sample falling into each category are 0.27, 0.27, 0.24, and 0.23. Retrieved from the UAS comprehensive data collected between 2017 and 2020, household net worth captures the respondent's stock of economic capital defined as the net value of assets accounting for liabilities. As a time-invariant factor, we categorize this variable into four groups based on the quartile measures. The mean net worth of each group is -$19,532, $44,793, $203,918, and $1,293,313. Retrieved from the UAS COVID-19 data, we use three categories of employment status : the proportion of people who are employed, unemployed, and retired is 0.59, 0.29, and 0.19, respectively.
Finally, to account for heterogeneous media consumption behaviors, we combine people's use of and trust in the media. The UAS COVID-19 survey measures whether the respondent uses different media to learn about the coronavirus and how much they trust the information. Since this question is included in the first wave only, we assume that people's media consumption is stable over a study period ( C i ). The responses to the trust variables are one (do not trust at all), two (trust somewhat), three (trust mostly), and four (trust completely). We create media consumption indicators coded as one if the respondent uses and trusts (trust somewhat to completely) information provided by each of the four media: social media (contacts on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.), CNN, Fox, and local media (local newspaper and TV news). On average, the proportion of social media, CNN, Fox, and local media users is 0.24, 0.37, 0.33, and 0.58, respectively. More detailed information about all the variables and summary statistics are available in Table A1 in Appendix.

Section: 3. Results

Table 2 presents the individual-fixed effect estimators from staggered DiD models after including additional covariates from Panels A to B. Controlling for individual time-variant factors only (Panel A), state orders promote preventive behaviors. The implementation of NEBC and/or SAH leads to a higher probability of limiting social activity, avoiding public spaces or gatherings, not eating at restaurants, and not visiting a doctor. Enacting such policies and mask mandates also leads to an increased probability of wearing a face mask.

After further controlling for national- and state-level COVID-19 metrics (Panel B), implementing NEBC and/or SAH still leads to an increased likelihood of engaging in social distancing although the effect size becomes much smaller. The impact of state orders is heterogeneous across different social distancing behaviors. Enacting any of the social distancing policies (i.e., NEBC and/or SAH) increases the probability of limiting eating at restaurants. Implementing NEBC only increases the probability of limiting social activities and avoiding public spaces while SAH only increases the probability of avoiding public spaces and decreases doctor visits. It should be noted that during the NEBC only period, people are less likely to wear face masks. Since the NEBC only usually takes place in the pandemic's early stage, the recommendation for saving masks for health workers and a lack of mask supply to the public at that time may contribute to this relationship. As expected, mask mandates increase the probability of mask-wearing.
In this section, we report the results from multiple robustness tests. In Table 3 , we replicate the full model using an alternative sample of respondents. The UAS COVID-19 surveys provide start and completion dates. In our empirical analysis, we use the completion dates to match the timing of state policies (and other covariates). A majority of the UAS respondents completed the survey within one day while 1.81–4.18 percent took multiple days. An extreme case spent 19 days from start to completion. Because the present study uses the different timings of state policies as identification strategies, such date discrepancies might influence our results. To address this issue, we exclude respondents who did not complete the survey within one day to deal with the potential selection bias that those who took several days to complete the survey might differ systematically from those who did not (Panel A). In general, our results are robust to these adjustments. Table 3 . Robustness tests. Empty Cell Limit social activity Avoid public spaces Limit eating at restaurant Visit a doctor Wear a mask Coef.

In Panel B, we estimate the full model after excluding the residents of California, New Jersey, and New York. These states are outliers in the distribution of the number of new cases in the early stage of the pandemic ( Dave et al., 2020 ). The NEBC only treatment still has an impact on an increase in the probability of avoiding public spaces and the SAH only treatment decreases doctor visits ‒ although NEBC and/or SAH no longer lead to changes in people's other social distancing behaviors. While mask mandates increase mask-wearing behaviors, implementing and lifting statewide social distancing policies reduce such behaviors.
We present heterogeneous responses in preventive behaviors to statewide policies by individual health risk factors such as age and living arrangements (see Table A2 in Appendix for full results). The coefficients and their 95 percent confidence intervals from regression models using equation (2) based on the DDD design are presented in Fig. 3 . Imposing the NEBC and/or SAH has a greater impact on older individuals, who have a higher probability of adopting all types of preventive behaviors. Even after the SAH lift, older individuals are likely to maintain their preventive behaviors except for increasing doctor visits.

Living with vulnerable people also influences compliance with state orders ( Fig. 4 ). Those who live with the elderly are more likely to engage in preventive behaviors, especially wearing face masks and not eating at restaurants when the NEBC and/or SAH is in effect. Such tendencies remain even after SAH lifts. In contrast, those who live with children under 18 are less likely to engage in preventive behaviors such as limiting social activities, avoiding public gatherings or spaces, staying away from restaurants, and wearing face masks.

We further investigate the heterogeneous impact of state orders on preventive behaviors by individual economic insecurities measured by health insurance ownership, household income, net worth, and employment status ( Fig. 5 , Fig. 6 , Fig. 7 , Fig. 8 , Table A3 in Appendix). Our findings show that those with health insurance, household income greater than $30,000, and in higher net worth quartiles are more likely than others to adopt most preventive behaviors in response to state policies, although they show an increased probability of visiting a doctor during the SAH and/or NEBC. The unemployed are less likely than the employed to engage in all preventive behaviors in response to state orders while the retired are more likely to do so under the state orders and even after their lifts.

In Fig. 9 , we present whether individuals comply with state policies according to their use and trust in the media ( Table A4 in Appendix). The results show that people divide into mask-wearing behaviors, either wearing them or not, according to media consumption. Specifically, those who use local media as a trusted COVID-19 information source are more likely to wear masks under state orders and even after their lift whereas those who use social media and Fox News are less likely to do so. As with their social distancing behaviors, CNN users are more likely to reduce their social activities, avoid public gatherings or spaces, and limit eating at restaurants during the implementation of NEBC and/or SAH and after lifts. Social media, local media, and Fox users are less likely to engage in social distancing behaviors under state orders. After lifting the SAH, social media and Fox users further decrease social distancing behaviors, but local media users do not.

Section: 4. Discussion

With several COVID-19 vaccines proving effective, governments have authorized their widespread use, but health experts say that it will take several months or more to achieve anything close to nationwide immunity ( World Health Organization, 2020 ). Until then, communities should maintain preventive behaviors to “coexist with the health threat posed by COVID-19” ( Borgonovi and Andrieu, 2020 , p.10). This study examined how individuals change their behavior in response to statewide social distancing restrictions and identified several factors associated with their compliance.
Consistent with previous studies, our findings show that social distancing mandates encourage the adoption of preventive behaviors ( Andersen, 2020 ; Borgonovi and Andrieu, 2020 ; Dave et al., 2020 ; Engle et al., 2020 ; Liu and Mattke, 2020 ; Painter and Qiu, 2020 ). Even after controlling for COVID-19 infection trends, our findings show that state mandates confirm their promise to induce targeted behaviors, particularly the avoidance of dining out under any form of state mandate (i.e., NEBC and/or SAH). State policies have been successful in reducing dining-out activities either by reducing the supply of such services through venue closures or by suppressing demand. However, controlling for the COVID-19 metrics cancels the significant impact of state mandates on some social distancing behaviors that are scarcely affected by restrictions on commercial activities, such as reducing social activities and visiting public spaces. The magnitude of the influence of state mandates is also considerably reduced. These findings indicate that the observed increase in social distancing behaviors, especially during NEBC and SAH, is attributable to people's voluntary reaction to the surge of infection numbers as well as compliance with statewide mandates.
Our results also show that compliance with state mandates for preventive behaviors differs according to health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The elderly are more likely than others to adopt preventive behaviors during and even after lifting the mandates, except visiting a doctor. Similarly, those living with an elderly family member are more likely to adopt some preventive behaviors during the mandates, while those with children are not. The latter may have a lower motivation to take precautions due to the substantially lower risk of serious illness among the young ( CDC, 2020 ). That high-risk individuals maintain preventive behaviors even after the lift can be explained by strategic behaviors to avoid additional risks imposed by others ( Chen et al., 2011 ). High-risk individuals may perceive less social distancing after the lift as a health threat and strategically choose to self-protect by maintaining social distancing behaviors except for essential activities such as visiting doctors.
However, preventive behaviors are compromised when individuals are economically disadvantaged. The unemployed or those who lack health insurance are less likely to comply with social distancing policies, and this can affect their health. Since such individuals lack the resources for timely and adequate diagnosis and treatment, their non-compliance and risk of consequent infection may result in severe illness for themselves and others. Also, during state orders and even after their lift, social distancing and mask-wearing behaviors are more prevalent among those with higher income and net worth. These findings provide persuasive evidence that the adoption of preventive behaviors is often determined by economic status and support the view that socioeconomic inequalities can lead to health inequalities ( Clouston et al., 2020 ). For the economically insecure, social distancing mandates can create tensions between the economic costs and health benefits of state policy compliance. A low level of participation in preventive behaviors, either voluntarily or necessarily, aggravates their economic insecurity if they become ill or lose income. Furthermore, social distancing practices may widen inequalities in health and economic conditions between rich and poor ( Watson et al., 2020 ), especially if implemented without financial compensation for the predicted loss. Such adverse effects can be mitigated by additional policy efforts to reduce economic risk ( Western et al., 2012 ) and incentivize the adoption of preventive behaviors such as increases in stimulus transfers ( Wright et al., 2020 ) and wage subsidies ( Papanastasiou et al., 2020 ).
We also find that individuals show distinct patterns in preventive behaviors according to their media consumption. Specifically, CNN users are more likely to limit their social activities during state orders and even after the lift, whereas Fox News users tend to do the opposite. Because social distancing has been politicized by the Trump administration and some supportive politicians, this has led some media pundits to doubt its effectiveness ( Fan et al., 2020 ). Heterogeneity in social distancing behaviors may also reflect the public divide on health issues by political belief ( Andersen, 2020 ; Baker et al., 2020 ; Fan et al., 2020 ; Painter and Qiu, 2020 ). Our findings show that people's anti-social distancing and anti-mask behaviors are also guided by information delivered via social media. Lack of credible and consistent information from government officials and major cable news contribute to the spread of false and misleading information among social media users ( Romer and Jamieson, 2020 ) and place public health at risk.
It is worth noting that local media users are less likely than others to limit their social activities, especially visiting public spaces, during statewide restrictions. However, they also show a higher likelihood of mask-wearing regardless of state orders and limiting restaurant dining when state orders are lifted. These findings conflict in part with the previous literature, which shows that local media users are likely to have a greater risk perception of COVID-19 and cooperate with policies to reduce the spread of infections ( Ye and Lyu, 2020 ). Our findings are also counterintuitive because, when functioning well, local news media builds social capital that enhances civic participation and facilitates coordination and cooperation for community benefits ( Hess, 2015 ).
To further explore the mixed effects of local media use on social distancing behaviors, we conducted additional analyses to examine how different media users respond to statewide restrictions according to social capital scores calculated by Rupasingha et al. (2006, with updates) . When dividing samples into four quartiles according to the social capital score of their states, the anti-social distancing behaviors of local media users during state orders are observed only in those states with low levels of social capital whereas those living in high-social capital states are more likely to avoid public spaces (see Table A5 in the Appendix). These findings indicate that local media may play a significant role in shaping perceptions of COVID-19 issues and encouraging people to comply with public health guidelines. Where social norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness are low, local media users may be less likely to perceive COVID-19 issues as a problem requiring collective effort and do not limit their social interactions. Such tendencies may become more prevalent when local media viewers find information from government officials and major cable news inconsistent and/or unreliable. Our findings on the heterogeneous responses to state orders among different media users shed light on the importance of reliable information distribution and communication during a public health crisis. Media outlets influence public perception and retain the ability to convey ( Hess, 2015 ) the importance of cooperating with government guidelines to solve the issues. Government officials should also actively respond to false and misleading information across social and mass media , especially when the information risks public health.

Section: 5. Conclusion

This study has several limitations. Because the publicly available geographic information of the UAS survey is limited to the state of residence, the lack of local-level residence data limits our ability to incorporate further variations in social distancing policies employed at the county- or city-levels. Nor do we differentiate social distancing associated with essential activities (e.g., grocery or pharmaceutical shopping) and nonessential behaviors (e.g., going to a bar, club, or other public places). Since the UAS survey begins by asking about such behaviors after the first wave, missing data issues arise for pre-policy behaviors. Future researchers might explore differences in compliance between essential and non-essential activities.
Nevertheless, the present study adds important findings to a growing body of pandemic literature. First, statewide social distancing policies lead to preventive behaviors. Second, individuals with a high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 are more likely than others to comply with state policies and even voluntarily maintain preventive behaviors after the lift. This includes the elderly and those who live with them. Third, economic insecurity deters people from adopting preventive behaviors in response to state mandates. The unemployed, those with low income and net worth, or who lack health insurance, often forego preventive behaviors as a tradeoff to minimize threats to their economic security. Finally, CNN users are compliers and voluntary adopters of preventive behaviors while Fox News and social media users tend toward non-compliance. These findings have important policy implications to address economic risks and misleading information while encouraging greater public cooperation with preventive behaviors. Such implications should guide policy interventions in response to future pandemics.
