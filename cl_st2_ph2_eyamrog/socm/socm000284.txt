Title: Resistance as a form of resilience in sexual and gender minorities: Differential moderating roles of collective action on the discrimination–depression relationship among sexual minority men and women


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

As a fundamental means for transforming and advancing the conditions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, collective action has gained increasing attention in research, policy, and practice over the past decade. While collective action is influential in driving public awareness and policy changes, less is known about its psychological effects on individuals undertaking collective action.

Abstract_Section: Methods

The present study developed a scale to measure collective action for LGBT rights and examined the underlying dimensions of collective action in a sample of 1050 LGBT individuals in Hong Kong. The moderating roles of collective action on the relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms were also examined.

Abstract_Section: Results

The LGBT Collective Action Scale measured two dimensions of collective action, i.e., private and public collective action. Private collective action moderated the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among sexual minority men and women; however, the moderating effect of public collective action was only found in sexual minority women.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

These differential moderating effects could be attributed to gender role socialization and gender-specific coping mechanisms in response to minority stress. Although public collective action is more powerful in triggering structural changes than private collective action, individuals in less democratic societies may not necessarily have access to public collective action due to the absence of opportunity structures. Private collective action, which is able to be initiated and undertaken individually, can be directed to transform heterosexist biases in interpersonal context . For LGBT individuals in less democratic societies, private collective action may be a more manageable way to maintain mental health in the face of stigmatization.

Section: 1. Introduction

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals across the globe experience prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, and many different forms of victimization ( Bostwick et al., 2014 ; Harper and Schneider, 2003 ). Despite the experiences of marginalization in different domains of life, LGBT individuals may resort to collective action as a means to resist social injustice ( DiFulvio, 2011 ). Collective action refers to action undertaken by an individual or a group in pursuit of common interests and goals ( Marwell and Oliver, 1993 ). A group member engages in collective action whenever they act as a representative of the group and when the action is directed at improving the conditions of the group as a whole ( Wright et al., 1990 ). Collective action varies greatly in the scale of participation, including interpersonal (e.g., engagement in critical dialogue), institutional (e.g., participation in advocacy organization), and societal levels (e.g., protest for social change) ( Becker et al., 2013 ; Szymanski, 2004 ). As revealed in previous studies ( DeBlaere et al., 2014 ; Szymanski and Owens, 2009 ), engaging in collective action may leave people less vulnerable to the psychological distress caused by discrimination. Nevertheless, most research has been conducted in Western liberal democracies ( Jones and Brewster, 2017 ; Velez and Moradi, 2016 ; Watson et al., 2018 ), whereas little attention has been given to investigate collective action in less democratic societies or whether participation in collective action can moderate the negative relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among LGBT individuals in these societies.
Collective action has received growing public attention and interest, as evidenced by the tremendous increase in public campaigns and social activism in recent years, such as the Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movements. Collective action is also used as a means to advocate for LGBT rights, such as anti-discrimination laws, marriage equality, adoption and parenting, and legal recognition of gender ( DeBlaere et al., 2014 ; DiFulvio, 2011 ). Earlier research showed that LGBT individuals are particularly vulnerable to oppression due to their stigmatized identity ( Bostwick et al., 2014 ; Harper and Schneider, 2003 ). In many parts of the world, the rights of LGBT individuals are still not protected by laws, and they are subjected to unequal treatment in education, employment, housing, and relationship recognition ( Bostwick et al., 2014 ; Suen et al., 2020 ; Szymanski, 2006 ). LGBT individuals often face oppression and discrimination because of their sexual and gender minority status, contributing to a disproportionate burden of mental health problems ( Harper and Schneider, 2003 ; Kuyper and Fokkema, 2011 ).
Despite the growing amount of research on LGBT collective action, there is a paucity of measures available to assess participation in collective action for sexual and gender minority rights ( Becker et al., 2013 ). Most previous studies on LGBT collective action have used the Involvement in Feminist Activities Scale ( Szymanski, 2004 ) and adapted the items for sexual minority people ( DeBlaere et al., 2014 ; Dunn and Szymanski, 2018 ; Jones and Brewster, 2017 ; Velez and Moradi, 2016 ; Watson et al., 2018 ). The scale was used as a unidimensional measure of involvement in sexual minority-related activism. However, collective action does not always come in one form; instead, it has many different ways of expression. In an early study by Corning and Myers (2002) , they developed the Activism Orientation Scale to assess the propensity to engage in a variety of activist behaviors, including conventional activism (e.g., “distribute information representing a particular social or political group’s cause”) and high-risk activism (e.g., “engage in a political activity in which you suspect there would be a confrontation with the police”). Becker et al. (2013) specifically identified three forms of collective action for supporting the legalization of same-sex marriage, including private actions (e.g., “vote for political candidates who make same-sex marriage rights one of their serious concerns”), public protest actions (e.g., “participate in peaceful demonstrations that call for official recognition of same-sex marriage in California”), and violent actions (e.g., “participate in violent protests against those responsible for banning same-sex marriage in California”). Nevertheless, the above scales only capture behavioral intentions and do not measure actual participation. Furthermore, they fail to account for the fact that opportunities for high-risk activism and violent actions are not always available, especially in less democratic societies ( Hildebrandt, 2011 ; Ho, 2007 ). Therefore, the present study was designed to fill this gap by developing a scale to capture different dimensions of collective action for LGBT rights in less democratic societies.
Collective action is a vital tool that ordinary people have to participate in the democratic process and drive social change ( Marwell and Oliver, 1993 ). However, the right to take collective action is not always guaranteed, especially in less democratic societies where civil rights are curtailed and where collective action is seen as a threat to the existing political order ( Chua, 2012 ). While large-scale demonstrations and rallies for LGBT rights are commonly observed in Western liberal democracies, this kind of action is usually not allowed in less democratic societies due to strict government control over protest and activism ( Chan and Mak, 2020 ; Ho, 2007 ). To maintain regime stability, laws and legal procedures are used to suppress crowd mobilization and prohibit participation in nonnormative collective action that disrupts the rules of the current system ( Hildebrandt, 2011 ; Wright, 2009 ). In addition, grassroots activism has a less pronounced influence on the governance in less democratic countries, and LGBT advocacy organizations in some of these countries have even been declared illegal and forcibly shut down ( Capell and Elgebeily, 2019 ). To ensure the movement’s survival, LGBT individuals and activists need to lobby strategically and avoid direct, overt confrontation with the state. Oftentimes, their action has to stay within the confines of the law to play to the norm of legal legitimacy, so that they are not perceived as a challenge to existing arrangements of power ( Chua, 2012 ). With a lack of opportunity structure for pursuing progressive social change, people in less democratic societies also turn to micro-activism in an attempt to bring about attitudinal changes in their immediate environment ( Bennett, 2012 ). Examples include blogging, engaging in critical dialogue, and confronting hate speech. Although micro-activism may not necessarily result in structural change, it reflects personal beliefs and values, signifying one’s resistance to oppression ( Leibold, 2011 ).
In Hong Kong, sexual intercourse between men was historically criminalized during British colonial rule. Although it has been almost three decades since the decriminalization of male homosexual acts in 1991, not much progress has been achieved in improving LGBT rights compared to other East Asian societies, such as Taiwan ( Capell and Elgebeily, 2019 ). Despite widespread evidence of discrimination against LGBT individuals, no comprehensive legislation exists to protect them from discrimination ( Suen et al., 2016 ). In recent years, there has been increasing debate over same-sex relationship recognition. Although same-sex marriage is not currently legal, same-sex relationships are acknowledged in limited domains, including dependent visa application, tax and spousal benefits, and protection of cohabiting same-sex couples against domestic violence ( Capell and Elgebeily, 2019 ). Research also documented a gradual increase in the number of community organizations and social action for LGBT rights in Hong Kong, indicating the growing awareness of sexuality-based oppression and inequity ( Kong et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, opportunity structures for collective action have been increasingly constrained due to less freedom of expression and tightened government control over mass demonstrations and organized protests in recent years. It is therefore important to understand the undertaking of collective action in Hong Kong and how it affects LGBT individuals who participate in collective action.
Collective action is often considered influential in raising public awareness and driving social change, but less is known about its psychological benefits on the individuals undertaking collective action ( DeBlaere et al., 2014 ; Velez and Moradi, 2016 ). Engaging in collective action to confront oppression may transform the oppressive experiences and enable people to develop resistance to social vulnerabilities and adversity ( Watts et al., 2011 ). Specifically, Klar and Kasser (2009) showed that participation in conventional activism, but not high-risk activism, was related to increased levels of well-being. Becker et al. (2011) also demonstrated an association between participation in collective action and self-directed positive affect. Furthermore, involvement in LGBT collective action was positively correlated with psychological well-being ( Watson et al., 2018 ).
The social identity theory ( Tajfel and Turner, 1979 ) was proposed to explain the psychological basis of intergroup behavior. The theory asserts that individuals define themselves in terms of their group membership and are motivated to maintain a positively distinct social identity in part to satisfy their need to maintain their self-esteem ( Abrams and Hogg, 1988 ). As a threatened social identity can impact self-concept, individuals in low-status groups strive to protect their self-esteem by responding to their disadvantaged position with three types of strategies, including individual mobility, social creativity, and social competition ( Tajfel and Turner, 1986 ). Particularly, social competition is a group-level strategy that requires group members to join force collectively to improve their devalued group status and protect the value of the groups in which they belong. Social competition is likely to occur when intergroup boundaries are impermeable, and when intergroup status is perceived to be illegitimate ( Tajfel and Turner, 1979 ). Collective action is one of the group-level responses, in which members of the disadvantaged groups come together to bring about social change and improve the standing of their groups ( Branscombe and Ellemers, 1998 ). As a means to challenge the position of privileged groups and confront illegitimate intergroup status, collective action may salvage personal and group-based self-esteem for members of disadvantaged groups.
Previous investigations have provided initial support for the protective role of collective action against discrimination in sexual and gender minorities ( Friedman and Leaper, 2010 ). Szymanski and Owens (2009) showed that feminist collective action moderated the association between sexism and psychological distress among sexual minority women, such that increased involvement in feminist activities provided a buffer against the adverse effects of sexism. DeBlaere et al. (2014) also found that collective action moderated the negative association between heterosexist experiences and psychological distress among sexual minority women. This line of research reveals that collective action has the potential to enable LGBT individuals to be less affected by minority stress, leading to improved mental health ( Dutt and Grabe, 2014 ; Szymanski and Owens, 2009 ). It was therefore hypothesized that collective action would moderate the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms, such that the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms would be weaker among LGBT individuals with higher levels of collective action. Nevertheless, Breslow et al. (2015) found that collective action did not attenuate the association between discrimination and psychological distress among transgender individuals. These inconsistent results might be attributed to differences in gender and/or gender identity. Given that people of different genders may differentially experience and respond to minority stress ( Kuyper and Fokkema, 2011 ), it is necessary to examine gender differences in the protective effect of collective action against discrimination among LGBT individuals. In addition, there is an absence of research examining the resilience effect of collective action in less democratic societies that have fewer opportunity structures to engage in collective action.
The present study aimed to (1) adopt an inductive approach to develop a scale for measuring collective action for LGBT rights in less democratic societies, (2) examine the underlying dimensions of collective action for LGBT rights, (3) investigate the moderating roles of collective action on the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health among LGBT individuals, and (4) examine gender differences in the moderating roles of collective action.

Section: 2. Methods

This research was part of a larger study on LGBT community mental health in Hong Kong. Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics review committee before the study began. The study was advertised through local LGBT social media (e.g., Facebook and online forums), community organizations, advocacy groups, and social venues. Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (1) 18 years old or older, (2) self-identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or otherwise not heterosexual, and (3) living in Hong Kong. Participants who met inclusion criteria and showed initial interest in the study were invited to participate in an online survey study hosted by Qualtrics. They were instructed to read the background and purposes of the study and were then provided informed consent before participation in any study procedures. It was emphasized that their participation was voluntary and that the information they provided would be treated confidentially. The consent form and questionnaire were available in both English and Chinese. Participants could complete the questionnaire in the language with which they felt most comfortable. Those who completed the survey were given HK$50 (US$6.40) as compensation for their time spent on the study.
One thousand fifty participants were recruited and completed the study. While 52.7% ( n = 483) of the participants were female, 46% ( n = 553) were male, and 1.3% ( n = 14) indicated their gender as other, including transgender, non-binary, gender fluid, etc. Participant mean age was 25.07 years old (S.D. = 6.40). Around three-quarters of participants had a bachelor’s degree or higher level of education (73.7%) and most were employed (54.2%, n = 569). A majority of participants identified as gay or lesbian (62.7%; n = 658), 30.8% ( n = 323) identified as bisexual or pansexual, and 6.6% ( n = 69) identified as asexual, questioning, queer, or other. Most of the participants (64.5%, n = 677) had a monthly income of below HK$15,000.
Collective action was assessed using the LGBT Collective Action Scale, which was adapted from existing measures related to collective action ( Corning and Myers, 2002 ), particularly those for gender equality ( Foster and Matheson, 1995 ; Kelly and Breinlinger, 1995 ; Szymanski, 2004 ) and sexual minority rights ( Becker et al., 2013 ). We first scanned existing measures to create a pool of items that could be refined into a scale of LGBT collective action. Measures, including the Activism Orientation Scale ( Corning and Myers, 2002 ), Collective Action Scale ( Foster and Matheson, 1995 ), Involvement in Feminist Activities Scale ( Szymanski, 2004 ), Collective Action Intentions Measure ( Becker et al., 2013 ) and scale measuring participation in gender-related political action ( Kelly and Breinlinger, 1995 ), were reviewed. An initial pool of 100 items was gathered from these five measures. In reviewing and selecting items, we were guided by the definition of collective action, i.e., a group member engages in collective action whenever they act as a representative of the group and when the action is directed at improving the conditions of the group as a whole ( Wright et al., 1990 ). Items were evaluated to determine whether they (1) fall within the definition of collective action and (2) are relevant or applicable to the political systems in less democratic societies. In addition, items that involve illegal action and might create serious concerns among participants in less democratic societies were excluded. For items that were considered as measuring relevant aspects of collective action, they were directly adapted, combined, contextualized, and/or modernized to fit into the sociopolitical context in less democratic societies. The details and examples of the item development process are provided in Table 1 . The development and refinement were conducted by a research team consisting of psychologists, graduate students in psychology, and LGBT individuals. They were familiar with the collective action literature and had experience in participating in collective action for LGBT rights. The items were developed in English. The original items were translated into Chinese and back translated into English by two independent bilingual researchers. The two versions of the items were then reviewed to check for accuracy and equivalency of the translation as well as to improve face validity and clarity, so that the language used in the scale was appropriate for participants. To evaluate the comprehensibility and applicability of the items, the initial version of the scale was administered to several LGBT individuals for pilot testing. After receiving feedback and comments, the wording of the items was modified. The final version of the scale includes 12 items that reflect different forms of collective action for LGBT rights in less democratic societies. Participants were asked to assess how often they participated in LGBT-related collective action during the past year. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 ( never ) to 5 ( frequently ). Higher scores indicate more frequent participation in collective action for LGBT rights. Table 1 . Development of the items of the LGBT Collective Action Scale based on existing measures. Process Details Original items (Example) Items of the LGBT Collective Action Scale (Example) 1.

Ten items from the Heterosexist Harassment, Rejection, and Discrimination Scale (HHRDS; Szymanski, 2006 ) were used to assess perceived discrimination from different sources in the past year. A sample item includes “How many times have you been treated unfairly by your co-workers, fellow students, or colleagues because of your sexual orientation?” Items were rated on a 6-point Likert scale from 1 ( the event has never happened to you ) to 6 ( the event happened almost all the time; more than 70% of the time ). Participants could select “not applicable” if there is no such person or group of people in their life. Higher scores indicate more frequent experiences of discrimination. Items were translated into Chinese using the back-translation procedure described above. Cronbach’s α in this study was 0.92.
The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2001 ) was used to assess levels of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks. A sample item includes “little interest or pleasure in doing things”. Participants were asked to respond on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 ( not at all ) to 4 ( nearly every day ). Higher scores reflect more severe levels of depressive symptoms. The scale was translated into Chinese and validated in Chinese populations ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Cronbach’s α in this study was 0.90.
Factor analysis was conducted to examine the underlying dimensions of collective action for LGBT rights. The participant sample ( N = 1050) was randomly divided into two equal subsamples of 525 participants. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted on the first subsample to understand the underlying dimensions of collective action. Before conducting the EFA, the Bartlett’s test of sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy were conducted to assess the factorability of the data. The EFA was conducted in SPSS 24.0 using principal axis factoring extraction and oblimin rotation because the factors were expected to correlate with each other as different dimensions of collective action. Four criteria were used to determine the number of factors to extract for the final solution: (1) Kaiser’s criterion of eigenvalues greater than 1, (2) Cattell’s scree test, (3) parallel analysis, and (4) interpretability of the solution. Parallel analysis was used to determine the appropriate number of factors to retain and was interpreted based on a comparison between the actual eigenvalues from the existing sample and random eigenvalues from 1000 simulated random data sets ( Horn, 1965 ). Item retention was determined by the following criteria: (1) a factor loading of 0.40 or above on the primary factor, and (2) a discrepancy of loadings between primary and secondary factors of 0.10 or above ( Morrison and Lent, 2018 ; Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007 ).
To evaluate the factor structure obtained in the EFA, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on the second subsample using the maximum likelihood estimation method in MPlus 7.1. All items were specified to load on their respective factors. The goodness-of-fit of the CFA model was evaluated using the χ 2 statistic and four other fit indices, including the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) ( Hu and Bentler, 1999 ). Criteria for acceptable model fit included: CFI and TLI values of 0.90 or above, RMSEA value of 0.08 or below, and SRMR value of 0.08 or below ( Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007 ). While the χ 2 statistic is used to evaluate model fit, it is highly sensitive to large sample size.
The psychometric properties of the scale were examined using the entire sample. The internal consistency of the subscales was assessed using Cronbach’s α coefficient. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relationship of collective action with other variables of interest, including perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms. An additional analysis was conducted to compare the strength of correlations of different types of collective action with other variables ( Eid et al., 2011 ).
Prior to the moderation analysis, we first identified demographic variables to be included as control variables in the moderation analysis. As age and socioeconomic status (i.e., educational level, employment status, and income level) have been found to be related to depressive symptoms ( Kessler et al., 2003 ) and might influence one’s exposure to discrimination and experience of depressive symptoms ( Burgess et al., 2007 ), their potential confounding effects need to be adequately considered. We estimated the relationships between these demographic variables and depressive symptoms in univariate analysis . Demographic variables that were significantly related to depressive symptoms were included as control variables in the moderation analysis.
Moderation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro 3.5 for SPSS ( Hayes, 2018 ) with 5000 bias-corrected bootstrap samples. We examined whether different types of collective action (Z) moderate the association between perceived discrimination (X) and depressive symptoms (Y), controlling for demographic variables that were related to depressive symptoms in preliminary univariate analyses. The entire sample was used in the analysis. The predictor variables were mean-centered before the analysis. The effect size of moderation was estimated using Δ R m o 2 , which represents the proportion of the variance uniquely explained by the moderator variable Z (the XZ term) to the additional variance jointly explained by X and XZ ( Liu and Yuan, 2020 ). R 2 values of 0.02, 0.13, and 0.26 indicate small, medium, and large effects, respectively ( Cohen, 1988 ). Significant interactions were probed using the 16th 50th, and 84th percentiles to estimate the conditional effects of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms at low, moderate, and high levels of collective action. In addition, the Johnson–Neyman (J–N) technique was used to demarcate the “regions of significance” of the effect of the predictor variable on the outcome variable along the continuum of the mediating variable ( Hayes and Matthes, 2009 ). This technique was used to identify regions in the range of collective action where the effects of perceived discrimination on depressive symptoms were statistically significant and not significant.
Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the moderating roles of collective action among cisgender sexual minority men and women. Since there was only a small proportion (1.3%) of participants who identified their gender as other (e.g., transgender, non-binary, gender fluid), their sample size was inadequate to perform subgroup analysis; therefore, we focused on the experiences of cisgender men and women to understand gender differences in the moderating effect of collective action on the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms.

Section: 3. Results

The significance of the Bartlett’s test of sphericity ( p < .001) supported that the items were sufficiently related for factor analysis. The size of the KMO (0.90) also indicated “marvelous” sampling adequacy for factor analysis ( Kaiser, 1974 ).
To identify the underlying dimensions of collective action, EFA was conducted. Two factors had eigenvalues greater than 1, and together they accounted for 61.24% of the variance. Eigenvalues and percent of variance accounted for by each factor were as follows: Factor 1 (eigenvalue = 5.82, 48.54% of variance) and Factor 2 (eigenvalue = 1.52, 12.70% of variance). An inspection of the scree plot showed a break between the steep slope of the first factor and the gradual trailing of the remaining factors. In addition, the results of parallel analysis showed that the first two factors had raw data eigenvalues (i.e., 5.82 and 1.52) that were greater than the stimulated random eigenvalues (i.e., 1.25 and 1.19), supporting a two-factor solution (see Fig. 1 ). Based on the converging evidence of eigenvalues and parallel analysis, two factors were retained for subsequent conceptual investigation.

The two-factor model provided a meaningful interpretation of items. Factor 1 was interpreted as public collective action (9 items), describing collective action taken by a group of individuals to promote structural changes for LGBT rights. Factor 2 was identified as private collective action (3 items), reflecting collective action taken by an individual to foster awareness and support for LGBT rights at an interpersonal level.
To evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the two-factor model, CFA was conducted. The results did not yield satisfactory model fits, χ 2 (53) = 501.85, p < .001, CFI = 0.85, TLI = 0.81, RMSEA = 0.13, SRMR = 0.07. We also estimated the goodness-of-fit of a one-factor model, χ 2 (54) = 653.42, p < .001, CFI = 0.80, TLI = 0.76, RMSEA = 0.15, SRMR = 0.08. A χ 2 difference test was conducted to compare the goodness-of-fit between the one-factor and two-factor models. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in goodness-of-fit between the two models, Δχ 2 = 151.57, Δ df = 1, p < .001. The model with more parameters and fewer degrees of freedom (i.e., two-factor model) showed a better fit and was therefore preferred.
Using a post-hoc model modification approach ( Kaplan, 1990 ), we inspected the modification indices to determine areas of model misspecification and improve the fit of the two-factor model. The results indicated that a major source of model misfit was attributed to the presence of correlated residual error terms for several sets of items. Examination of the items revealed that three sets of items tap into a similar area of collective action behavior. Specifically, both items 1 and 2 focus on the sensitivity to heterosexist language (i.e., conscious use of non-heterosexist language and correct others’ use of heterosexist language), and items 6 and 7 are related to conventional methods of political engagement (i.e., writing letters to the editor and contacting politicians). Furthermore, items 11 and 12 involve mass mobilization and participation in public spaces (i.e., participating in community events and demonstration). Since these three pairs of items were conceptually related, their residual error terms (i.e., items 1 and 2, items 6 and 7, and items 11 and 12) were allowed to correlate. The model was then respecified, and the CFA results showed a clear improvement in model fit, χ 2 (50) = 210.99, p < .001, CFI = 0.95, TLI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.08, SRMR = 0.04. All the items were significantly loaded onto the two factors ( ps < .001), with standardized factor loadings ranging from 0.47 to 0.78. Table 2 presents the standardized factor loadings of the two-factor model. Table 2 . Factor loadings of factor analyses and corrected item-total correlations.

The internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of the private and public collective action subscales was 0.71 and 0.90 respectively. Corrected item-total correlations for each subscale were all above 0.40 (see Table 2 ). The subscales were moderately correlated with each other ( r = 0.49, p < .001), suggesting that private and public collective action are distinct but related dimensions. The skewness and kurtosis values for private collective action (skewness = −0.15, kurtosis = −0.48) and public collective action (skewness = 0.83, kurtosis = 0.01) were within acceptable ranges (between −1 and 1).
As shown in Table 3 , perceived discrimination was positively correlated with private collective action ( r = 0.10, p = .001) and public collective action ( r = 0.29, p < .001). Perceived discrimination exhibited a significantly stronger association with public collective action than with private collective action ( z = −6.26, p < .001). Neither private nor public collective action was significantly correlated with depressive symptoms ( ps > .05). Table 3 . Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations of the variables.

The results of one-way analysis of variance showed a significant difference in depressive symptoms between LGBT individuals of different educational levels ( F = 10.59, p < .001), with LGBT individuals with secondary education or below showing higher levels of depressive symptoms. Independent-sample t-tests also showed a significant difference in depressive symptoms between LGBT individuals of different employment statuses and income levels. Particularly, LGBT individuals who were not in employment reported significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who were in employment ( t = 3.57, p < .001). LGBT individuals who had a monthly income level of below HK$15,000 showed significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who had a monthly income of HK$15,000 or above ( t = 5.01, p < .001). Age was also significantly related to depressive symptoms ( r = −0.16, p < .001). Based on the results, these demographic variables were included as control variables in the following analyses.
Perceived discrimination was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms ( B = 0.25, 95% CI = [0.19, 0.31]) (see Table 4 ), controlling for demographic variables, including age, educational level, employment status, and income level. The results of model 1 showed a significant interaction between private collective action and perceived discrimination, suggesting that private collective action significantly moderated the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms ( B = −0.07, 95% CI = [−0.14, −0.01], Δ R m o 2 = 0.06). As shown in Table 5 , for individuals with low levels of private collective action, perceived discrimination was positively and strongly associated with depressive symptoms ( B = 0.32, 95% CI = [0.23, 0.41]). For individuals with high levels of private collective action, the positive association between perceived discrimination with depressive symptoms was weaker ( B = 0.18, 95% CI = [0.10, 0.26]). In addition, the J-N technique indicated a significant, positive relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms only for those scoring < 1.80 on private collective action. These findings suggested that for LGBT individuals who were highly engaged in private collective action, perceived discrimination was not significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Table 4 .

We also examined the moderating role of public collective action on the discrimination–depression relationship (see model 2 in Table 4 ). The results indicated that the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was contingent on public collective action ( B = −0.07, 95% CI = [−0.13, −0.01], Δ R m o 2 = 0.06). An examination of the conditional effect at varying levels of public collective action revealed stronger association of perceived discrimination with depressive symptoms ( B = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.24, 0.44]) at low levels of public collective action (see Table 5 ). The positive relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms ( B = 0.22, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.28]) was weaker at higher levels of public collective action. The J-N technique showed that the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms became significant at a public collective action score of < 2.30.
Subgroup analyses were performed to examine the moderating roles of private and public collective action among sexual minority men and women. The results showed that the moderating effect of private collective action was significant in both sexual minority men ( B = −0.09, 95% CI = [−0.17, −0.001], Δ R m o 2 = 0.07) and women ( B = −0.10, 95% CI = [−0.20, −0.003], Δ R m o 2 = 0.19). For those with low levels of private collective action, perceived discrimination was positively and strongly associated with depressive symptoms (men: B = 0.39, 95% CI = [0.26, 0.51]; women: B = 0.29, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.42]). For sexual minority men with high levels of private collective action, the positive association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was weaker ( B = 0.22, 95% CI = [0.11, 0.32]). For sexual minority women with high levels of private collective action, there was no significant association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms ( B = 0.08, 95% CI = [−0.04, 0.21]).
The results revealed gender differences in the moderating role of public collective action. A significant moderating effect of public collective action was found in sexual minority women ( B = −0.11, 95% CI = [−0.21, −0.01], Δ R m o 2 = 0.19), but not in sexual minority men ( B = −0.05, 95% CI = [−0.13, 0.03], Δ R m o 2 = 0.02). For sexual minority women with lower levels of public collective action, perceived discrimination was positively and strongly associated with depressive symptoms ( B = 0.32, 95% CI = [0.18, 0.45]). The positive association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was weaker among those with higher levels of public collective action ( B = 0.13, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.24]).

Section: 4. Discussion

The present study is one of the first to examine the relationships among collective action, perceived discrimination, and depressive symptoms in a sample of LGBT individuals. While collective action has been recognized as a means to resist social oppression and bring about structural changes, less attention has been paid to understanding the psychological benefits of collective action ( Becker et al., 2011 ; Klar and Kasser, 2009 ). Our research filled this important gap by examining how different types of collective action moderate the negative relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health ( DeBlaere et al., 2014 ; Szymanski and Owens, 2009 ). Furthermore, this study identified two underlying and related dimensions of collective action for LGBT rights. Private collective action refers to collective action behavior intended to promote awareness and positive changes concerning LGBT rights at an interpersonal level, whereas public collective action refers to collective action behavior intended to advocate for positive changes concerning LGBT rights at a community or societal level. Interestingly, our results revealed that perceived discrimination had a significantly stronger association with public collective action than private collective action. For LGBT individuals who encountered heterosexism in everyday life, they reported more frequent engagement in public collective action to advocate for structural changes. This finding corroborates work by Friedman and Leaper (2010) , who found that experiences of heterosexism were associated with commitment to LGBT collective action in public.
Contrary to previous studies ( Klar and Kasser, 2009 ), our findings showed that participation in collective action was not directly related to mental health in sexual and gender minorities. This might be because collective action is often associated with mixed emotional experiences, i.e., simultaneous manifestation of positive and negative emotions ( van Zomeren et al., 2008 ). On the one hand, people may channel their beliefs and passion into collective action, resulting in enthusiasm and hope ( Christens et al., 2013 ). On the other hand, for those who find the system does not respond to their needs and see low potential to improve group status, they may experience frustration, resentment, and despair ( Watts et al., 2011 ). Another source of distress may arise when there are discrepancies between expectations and realities regarding LGBT rights. Therefore, different types of emotions commonly co-exist in people who are actively engaged in collective action for LGBT rights. They might not necessarily have lower levels of psychological distress due to their engagement in collective action.
The present study indicated that collective action moderated the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health, and the effect was of small-to-moderate size. As hypothesized, the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms was weaker among those with higher levels of collective action participation. Resilience effects were consistently observed in both private and public collective action. With higher levels of collective action, discrimination exerts a smaller negative effect on mental health. This is likely because participating in collective action has the potential to transform the oppressive experiences, which may offer people the ability to regain control over self-definition ( Dutt and Grabe, 2014 ). Collective action may foster a sense of empowerment and agency, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of discrimination on mental health ( Matthews and Adams, 2009 ). Although the present study only focuses on LGBT individuals, it is reasonable to believe that the psychological benefits of collective action might be observed in people from other oppressed groups, including women, people of color, people with lower socioeconomic status, and people with differing abilities. Future research could extend this work to understand whether the resilience effect of collective action is relevant for people from different oppressed groups.
Moreover, this study revealed differential moderating roles of collective action between sexual minority men and women. While private collective action significantly moderated the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among both sexual minority men and women, the protective effect of public collective action was only observed in sexual minority women. Also, the magnitude of the moderating effect was larger among sexual minority women than among sexual minority men. These results are consistent with findings by Szymanski and Owens (2009) as well as DeBlaere et al. (2014) in lesbian and bisexual women. These differences may reflect gender role socialization experiences and gender-specific coping mechanisms in response to minority stress, with males favoring problem-focused coping and females relying more on emotion-focused coping ( Matud, 2004 ; Ptacek et al., 1994 ). It is plausible that undertaking public collective action may be considered by sexual minority men as problem-focused coping to resolve and alter the current oppressive situation, whereas sexual minority women may utilize public collective action as emotion-focused coping to seek community support in managing the distress associated with heterosexism. In particular, public collective action not only builds positive connections with other sexual minority individuals, but also creates supportive social spaces that facilitate understanding, validation, and self-acceptance ( Velez and Moradi, 2016 ). Sexual minority women may therefore derive emotional satisfaction and fulfillment from being connected to in-group members through collective action. For sexual minority men, public collective action may be conceived as problem-focused coping, and thus the psychological benefits of public collective action would not be attained until the goal of the action (e.g., marriage equality) is reached. This might partly explain why sexual minority men were less likely than their female counterparts to perceive positive benefits from public collective action.
Differentiation between private and public collective action is contextually relevant to LGBT individuals in less democratic societies ( Capell and Elgebeily, 2019 ). Despite public collective action being more powerful in triggering structural changes than private collective action, it is not necessary that people in all societies have access to public collective action due to the absence of opportunity structures ( Chua, 2012 ; Hildebrandt, 2011 ). This is particularly valid for people in less democratic societies where bottom-up public collective action is prohibited ( Ho, 2007 ). Private collective action that can be undertaken individually offers an alternative way to make a personal statement about one’s identity and values ( Bennett, 2012 ). Although its extent and impact are limited compared to public collective action, private collective action may serve as a form of resistance toward oppressive relationships and institutions ( Hyers, 2010 ; Leibold, 2011 ). Particularly, private collective action (e.g., correcting people when they use heterosexist language) can be directed to transform heterosexist biases in interpersonal context , as evidenced in previous research that confrontation may lead perpetrators to reduce their subsequent expressions of prejudice and discriminatory response ( Hyers, 2010 ). Other private collective action (e.g., discussing LGBT issues with family and/or friends) may also create a “teachable moment” by engaging significant others in a critical dialogue about LGBT rights ( Rondini, 2015 ). Most importantly, private collective action may foster emotional resilience in both sexual minority men and women. Compared to public collective action which often incurs high personal costs and legal risks, private collective action may be a more manageable way in less democratic societies to maintain mental health in the face of stigmatization ( Wright, 2009 ).
Despite thirty years of collective action in Hong Kong, not much progress has been made in laws and policies protecting LGBT rights ( Suen et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, a gradual and growing acceptance of homosexuality has been evident over the years. Private collective action is as important as public collective action in shifting social attitudes and attention toward sexual and gender diversity. Although private collective action may not necessarily change or transform social structures as public collective action does, it can raise awareness of LGBT rights at an interpersonal level, potentially generating a ripple effect in one’s family and social networks ( Poteat, 2015 ). Fundamental and enduring social changes do not only rely on public collective action, but also necessitate private collective action in cultivating supportive attitudes toward LGBT individuals; this has been the case in Hong Kong ( Kong et al., 2015 ).
As the nature and instances of collective action behaviors may vary across societies, adaptation of the items may be needed before the application of the LGBT Collective Action Scale in different cultures and societies. Specifically, researchers may need to contextualize the measure by providing relevant examples in the items, so that participants can have a clear understanding of and distinction between different collective action behaviors. This may also improve the accuracy and validity of the measure ( Tourangeau et al., 2014 ). For instance, “Pink Dot Hong Kong” is an annual public gathering to show support for diversity and the freedom of love since 2014. As a community event originated from Singapore, Pink Dot is intended to avoid direct confrontation with the existing regime ( Wang, 2016 ). Another example of collective action is pride parade, which may be considered as a protest (item 12) or a community event (item 11) in different societies. In Bangkok Pride, activists are involved in staging street rallies to protest for equal rights for LGBT individuals in Thailand ( Jackson, 2011 ), which falls into the scope of item 12. On the other hand, Shanghai Pride is a month-long event to promote and celebrate diversity and inclusion for LGBT community in China ( Deklerck, 2019 ). It involves different activities, including dance parties, athletic contests, art exhibitions, film screenings, job fairs, and themed talks, which is a community event (item 11). In addition, while social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter may serve as an online tool to raise awareness of LGBT rights, these platforms are not available in some less democratic societies due to strict state censorship. For instance, in China, WeChat and Weibo can be listed as examples of online tools for awareness raising and advocacy.
As the results demonstrate empirical support for the protective effect of collective action in the face of stigmatization, it is important for psychologists, social workers, and other mental health practitioners to carefully consider how oppression leads to poor mental health in LGBT individuals ( American Psychological Association, 2012 ). Practitioners need to shift their work from an individual-focused, deficit-based paradigm to consideration of social actions that remove social injustice and inequities that are perpetuating unequal treatment and mental health disparities ( Sakamoto and Pitner, 2005 ). In addition, mental health practitioners should create an affirming therapeutic context for discussion of how social background and identity shape their clients’ life experiences, as a means of raising collective action and promoting positive engagement in life. This can equip LGBT individuals with the capacity to cope with everyday oppression, ultimately improving their psychological wellness .
Another implication of the present study is the potential to integrate critical consciousness in educational settings ( Rondini, 2015 ). Educational practitioners should go beyond the instruction of technical and practical knowledge to instill students with emancipatory knowledge through critical pedagogy ( Freire, 1970 ). Teachers can engage students to reflect on how systems of power and oppression variously shapes their life experiences and empower them to take a proactive role in challenging heteronormativity ( Watts et al., 2011 ). By developing critical consciousness, students across the sexual orientation and gender identity spectrum are more prepared to undertake collective action to resist oppression, thereby protecting them against the detrimental effect of perceived discrimination on mental health ( Diemer et al., 2015 ). Although critical pedagogy has received considerable attention and support in the literature, future work should carefully examine how educational interventions (e.g., didactic teaching, critical dialogue, and mentoring) on critical consciousness should be designed and implemented to best support LGBT students and others with marginalized identities.
Despite the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, a few limitations deserve consideration. First, the present study used a cross-sectional study design, which restricted our ability to make causal inferences. Longitudinal research is needed to examine how LGBT individuals may resort to collective action in the face of stigma over time and determine the temporal relationship among these variables. Second, this study was limited by a non-probability sample, which might affect the generalizability of findings to the larger LGBT population. In particular, the majority of participants had a bachelor’s degree or higher level of education. These findings need to be replicated in a more diverse sample, particularly with regard to education, before a conclusion can be reached. Third, three pairs of error terms were allowed to correlate to improve the model fit, as suggested by modification indices. The relationships among error terms identified in the study might indicate confounded measurement and therefore further investigation and refinement are necessary ( Levine, 2005 ). Fourth, this study provides limited validity evidence for the LGBT Collective Action Scale, and as such, further validation is required to establish the convergent, discriminant, and criterion-related validity of the scale. Replication studies are needed before any solid conclusions can be drawn about the protective role of collective action in LGBT individuals. Fifth, the present study only examined 12 different forms of collective action behavior for LGBT rights. While the LGBT Collective Action Scale covers a large spectrum of political action and activism discussed in the literature ( Becker et al., 2013 ; Corning and Myers, 2002 ; Foster and Matheson, 1995 ; Kelly and Breinlinger, 1995 ), it may not necessarily capture all forms of collective action behavior in different cultures and societies. Future work should examine the cross-cultural validity of the LGBT collective action scale.

Section: 5. Conclusions

The present study provides empirical support for the resilience effect of collective action in sexual and gender minorities ( Velez and Moradi, 2016 ; Watson et al., 2018 ). Collective action enables LGBT individuals to counteract heterosexism in various forms: either privately, by confronting the biased language and attitudes of others, or publicly, by taking part in protests for LGBT rights. Participating in private and public collective action can buffer the negative effect of discrimination on mental health in LGBT individuals ( DeBlaere et al., 2014 ; Szymanski and Owens, 2009 ). Although mobilizing collective action can protect LGBT individuals against minority stress, it is equally important that the awareness and demands on LGBT rights are reflected in social policies, structures, and norms. Only by simultaneously cultivating intrapersonal resilience and creating structural changes will the mental health of LGBT individuals be improved.
