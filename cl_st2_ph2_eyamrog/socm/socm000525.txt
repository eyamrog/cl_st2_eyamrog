Title: Informal payments and patients’ perceptions of the physician agency problem: Evidence from rural China


Abstract: Abstract

Informal payment for medical services is a common phenomenon in China. Patients make informal payments, in cash or in kind, to physicians in addition to official charges billed for medical services. This paper assesses the associations between patients' perceptions of the physician as an agent for the patient's interests (physician agency problem) and informal payment behavior. Using data of 24,000 and 6700 rural households respectively from the Health Development of Rural China Program database (collected in 2008) and Ningxia data source (collected in 2015), we find that patients' concern about physician agency problems is significantly associated with informal payments. The data shows that patients are more likely to make informal payments when they show low trust towards their physicians. For example, in the surgical cases, among patients who strongly distrusted the physicians, 17.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]:]: 13.5, 22.3) initiated informal payments, compared to 8.0% (95% CI: 5.1, 10.9) who expressed “strong trust” in their physicians. Poor communication was also significantly associated with an increase in the informal payment rate. For example, in the non-surgical setting, among the patients who rated the physicians' explaining skills as “poor,” 5.9% (95% CI: 5.0, 6.9) of them made informal payments, significantly higher than the patients who rated “excellent” (of whom 1.8% made informal payments 95% CI, 0.9, 2.7). In this study, we provide an explanation for this finding: patients may initiate informal payments to physicians in order to mitigate the physician agency problem. It suggests that to mitigate informal payments, improving alignment between doctors' incentives and patients' interests would be essential.

Section: 1. Introduction

Informal payments refer to additional cash payments or gifts that patients pay to physicians for services in addition to official charge ( bib_Gaal_et_al_2006Gaal et al., 2006a,b ). This phenomenon is known to be widespread in low- and middle-income countries, including India , China, Iran, the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries of Europe ( Bloom et al., 2000 ; Gaal and McKee, 2004 ; Piroozi et al., 2017 ; Rechel and McKee, 2009 ; Stepurko et al., 2013 ; Tripathi et al., 2020 ). In China, informal payments began to proliferate in the surgical departments of public hospitals in the late 1980s ( Zhou and Zhang, 2014 ) and was most prevalent in the 1990s ( Huang, 1996 ). A survey conducted in Liaoning province in 1999–2000 indicated that 20%–25% of the patients made informal payments ( Meng et al., 2001 ). Although informal payments could be viewed as a means to supplement physician income in underfunded healthcare systems ( Chawla et al., 1998 ; Gaal et al., 2006), they raise serious welfare concerns. Such payments impose heavy financial burdens on patients (in particular for the poor), impede public confidence in the standards of care and create negative attitudes towards the medical system ( Lewis, 2007 ; Stepurko et al., 2013 ).
The motivations of informal payments were complex. For example, some studies argued that informal payments could be understood as “rent-seeking” behavior among the physicians when they were not well regulated, which considered informal payments as equivalent to corruption with doctors making illegitimate use of their power to force patients to make informal payments ( Ensor, 2004 ; Lewis, 2000 ; Lindkvist, 2013 ; Khan, 2006 ). However, evidence from other studies showed that a majority of the informal payments were initiated by patients (Gaal et al., 2006; Stepurko et al., 2013 ; Vian and Burak, 2006 ). For example, some studies found that informal payments were given by the patient after treatment to express gratitude (Gaal et al., 2006; Kornai, 2000 ; Stepurko et al., 2013 ). Yet, previous literature also showed that pre-treatment informal payments are far more frequent than post-treatment payments ( Arrow, 2001 ; Gaal et al., 2006; Vian and Burak, 2006 ; Vian et al., 2006 ). Some other articles regard informal payments as a way to acquire immediate access or extra services ( Ensor, 2004 ; Gaal and McKee, 2005).
Several previous literatures argued that patients made informal payments because they were afraid that physicians might not deliver appropriate services that are in the patients' best interests ( Arrow, 2001 ; McGuire, 2000 ). This discussion pointed to the physician agency problem, which arises when physicians are motivated by other goals, such as making profits, instead of taking the best care of the patients ( Nguyen, 2011 ). In China, due to insufficient public funding during the economic transition beginning in the late 1970s, the compensation for procedures based on physicians’ efforts and skills was deliberately kept low by the government ( Cao, 2015 ; Yang, 2008 ). Yet physicians could earn a lot more than their salary by moonlighting where services were paid out-of-pocket ( Kornai and Eggleston, 2001 ). Moreover, the unregulated pharmaceutical industry offered kickbacks to physicians for prescribing their products ( Hsiao and Heller, 2007 ; Vian, 2008 ; Yu et al., 2010 ). Such price distortion gave physicians strong incentives to practice procedures that are more profitable or involve kickbacks, rather than the ones that are the best for the patients. Perceiving this problem, patients may try to minimize the risk of the agency behavior through informal channels ( Gaal et al., 2006a , Gaal et al., 2006b ). Similar problem of distorted prices and imperfect regulation is also widespread in other transitional economies , which might be an important cause of informal payments.
For this study, we aim to do an in-depth analysis to identify the relationship between informal payments and patients' perceptions of the physician agency problem. Given the data availability, we focused on the motivations of informal payments in rural. We found strong associations between patients' perceptions of the physician as an agent for the patient's interests (measured by patients' trust levels and ratings of doctors' communication performance) and the informal payment behavior, where a low trust level and communication rating correspond to a high informal payment rate.

Section: 2. Method and data

This paper adopts a cross-sectional dataset produced in 2008 to explore patients' motivations for making informal payments. The data source is the baseline survey of the Health Development of Rural China Program (HDRCP data) sponsored by the World Bank and UK's Department for International Development (DFID). The survey was conducted in 8 provinces according to area stratified sampling, covering 24,000 rural households. Within each county, 5 randomly-selected sample townships were surveyed. In each township or neighborhood, two randomly-selected administrative villages or neighborhood committees were surveyed. It contains detailed information about the patients' experience of their most recent hospital visits in the past year. To construct our sample of patients, we exclude cases that relate to labor and delivery because the meaning of red packets may be more complex at the birth of a baby according to the Chinese social customs (e.g. some Chinese parents believe providing red packets for birth service would bless the babies). We are left with 3934 observations, 1297 of which involve surgeries.
Appendix Table 1 exhibits the informal payment rates among adult inpatients of various categories in the sample. Overall, 4.9% of the inpatient patients reported that they made informal payments to the physicians. Such payments are far more frequent among patients undergoing surgeries, which reached 8.7%, comparing to 3.1% among the non-surgical cases. Based on such apparent difference, this paper divides patients into those undergoing surgeries and those not when doing the analysis. Table 1 .

For example, looking at the first column of data, we see that out of the 380 people who reported strong trust, the average age was 50.9 years, 51% were women, and 80.2% were married, etc.
It should be noted that the informal payment rate in our sample should not be interpreted as a national prevalence rate of informal payments due to possible underestimation. The survey only asked respondents about the most recent hospital stay. People who had multiple hospital stays might make informal payments in one of the past stays. Moreover, it is possible that patients underreported their informal payment behavior, though respondents were anonymous and the doctors involved could not be tracked through the survey. If people underreported their informal payment behavior in a random pattern, we are likely to be underestimating the effects of relevant factors on informal payments in this paper. In this case, an underestimation of the overall prevalence is likely to create difficulty in finding any significant association. If we still observe significant associations between factors that we are interested in and the informal payments, these factors are potentially more powerful when underestimation are corrected.
The HDRCP data source cannot distinguish the trust levels before and after the informal payments, which could cause concern of reverse causality (i.e. the physicians asked for informal payment, causing both the occurrence of informal payment and low trust rate). Moreover, the HDRCP data source didn't ask for the patients' motivations of making informal payments. Therefore, we designed a short survey to identify the trust levels before and after informal payment. We first conducted focus group discussion among the local patients to ensure the survey questions could be understand correctly among the general population. Then, the survey was piloted in a county in Ningxia Province and further implemented along with the 2015 household survey of the Ningxia Provider Payment System Reform Project (hereafter, Ningxia Project) carried out by Harvard-Oxford research team, covering 5 rural counties in Ningxia. In each county, the Ningxia Project research team sampled every town and select villages in each town randomly based on their economic status. In each selected village, 20–33 households were involved. A total of approximately 6700 households were involved with all household members aged 15 years or older interviewed. Among them, 1443 houehold members reported utilization of inpatient medical services in the past three years. There were 711 non-surgical cases and 732 surgical cases. This survey identified 101 households reported that their household members made informal payments to the physicians in the past three years. Out of these, 75 were inpatient cases including 54 surgical cases and 21 non-surgical cases (see Appendix Table 1 ). We checked the consistency of the questionnaire.
We presented the comparisons between the HDRCP data source and the Ningxia data source in Appendix Table 2 . Table 2 . Regression estimates of informal payment behavior on patient-reported trust, data from Health Development of Rural China Program.

Robust standard errors clustered at the county level are reported in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.
The survey asked respondents: “Did you ever give a cash packet or gift to physicians during the period of your latest hospitalization?” We identify the informal payment behavior from this question by constructing a 0–1 variable. 1 indicates that the patient reported either cash or gift or both.
To measure patients' perceptions of the physician agency problem, we adopt two measurements: patient-reported trust in their doctors and patient-reported ratings of doctor's communication performance.
The measurement of patient-reported trust in their doctors is obtained from the following survey question: “To what extent do you trust the doctor?” The options are: 1. Strong distrust, 2. Some distrust, 3. Neither distrust nor trust; 4. Some trust; 5. Strong trust; and 6. No answer. We group Option 1–2 into “distrust”, Option 3–4 into “neutral or some trust”, and Option 5 into “strong trust”.
In additional to trust, we also use patients' subjective ratings of physician-patient communication as a measurement of patients' perception of the physician as an agent for the patient's interests. Asymmetry of information is a usually source of physician agency problem - the patients know that they have less information about their health comparing to the physicians, and are therefore, concerned that the physicians are not practicing in their best interests. In this case, communication could play a central role in helping the patients understand the professional information and knowledge that is originally only known by the physicians ( Fiscella et al., 2004 ; Thom, 2001 ; Zolnierek and Dimatteo, 2009 ). It is well documented that how physicians communicate with patients affects the patients' conclusion about whether doctors have maintained the highest level of professionalism and put their patients' interests first ( Roter and Hall, 2006 ; Thom, 2001 ). As a result, we would expect that a low patient-reported rating of doctors' communication would be associated with a high probability of informal payments.
There are two relevant questions about how doctors communicated with patients in the survey. The first question asks patients: “To what extent do you feel the doctor has explained your disease condition to you?” The second question asks patients: “To what extent do you feel the doctor has listened to your feedback about the treatment plan?” The options include: 1. Very poor; 2. Poor; 3. Some poor; 4. Good; 5. Excellent; and 6 No answer. We group Option 1–3 into “poor “to construct a 3-level measurement for both aspects of communication.
Beside these measurements discussed above, the survey covered standard demographic information and socioeconomic background of a respondent. The survey also collected information on hospital levels, which categorized the hospitals into township hospitals, county hospitals, municipal/provincial hospitals, and unclassified hospitals in consideration of the administrative location and population size of the region. Moreover, the survey also divided patients’ diseases (pre-existing chronic conditions and the disease leading to hospital admission) into 126 categories according to “International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems-9 (ICD-9)” hierarchy and linkage. Based on that information, we can further control disease categories of admission in our analysis.
For the Ningxia data source, individuals were asked about informal payments, and at which level of health facilities did the informal payments occur and what services they went for. There were two critical questions relevant to our primary research question. First, they were asked how their trust levels changed before and after the payments. The questions were “How much did you trust the doctor BEFORE you gave the red packets or/and gifts?” and “How much did you trust the doctor AFTER you gave the red packets or/and gifts?” The answers were in 1–5 scales. One stands for strong distrust, and five stands for strong trust. Second, they were asked about their primary goals for making the payments, with the options of the question based on existing theories (listed behind a dash) in the literature. The question was “what was the primary reason for you to give the red packets or/and gifts?” There were either answers to choose from, including: 1) doctors asked for them directly or indirectly —provider rent-seeking behavior, 2) to avoid undertreatment by doctors —agency problem, 3) to avoid overtreatment by doctors—agency problem, 4) to prevent medical negligence by doctors —agency problem, 5) other patients gave them —social-psychology, 6) for particular needs (e.g. to order specific medical tests or procedures, change wards or hire outside doctors) —consumer choices, 7) to express gratitude, and 8) other. The detailed survey questions are listed in Appendix Table 3 . Table 3 . Regression analysis of informal payment behavior on doctors’ communication ratings, data from Health Development of Rural China Program.

Robust standard errors clustered at the county level are reported in parentheses. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the proportion of patients who made informal payments, including the means and standard deviations . We stratified the analysis by patient-reported trust in their doctors and patient-reported ratings of doctor's communication performance.
We also assessed the relationship between patients' perceptions of the physician agency problem and the decision of patients making informal payments with logistic regression models. The dependent variable is whether the patients made informal payments. The independent variable is patient-reported trust in their doctors or patient-reported ratings of doctor's communication performance. We are concerned that the association between informal payment and patient-recorded trust might be a reflection of underlying disease severity or risk - patients who have a relapse or resistance to treatment may present low trust levels, and some of them may want immediate access to health care and/or the ability to bypass the rationing rules or clinical protocol that a physician follows. To deal with this issue, we controlled for hospital levels and disease categories of hospital admission, as well as other individual characteristics including age, sex, ethnicity, education, occupation/job, log of household income, medical insurance, length of hospital stay, and adapted Charlson index for pre-existing chronic conditions. Moreover, it is possible that if doctors demand extra payments from patients, patients who have to make the payments will report low trust. This factor raises the concern of reverse causality between making informal payments and distrusting the physicians. To deal with this issue, we applied the Ningxia data source to consider the patients' trust levels before and after these payments.
In the regressions with “patient-reported trust in their doctors” as the independent variable, we treat trust levels as categorical and use “strong trust” as a reference, so the coefficients show to what extent lower trust levels will change the rate of informal payments compared to the rate when there is strong trust. In the regressions with “patient-reported ratings of doctor's communication performance” as the independent variable, we set the category of “excellent” communication as the reference group. So the coefficients present comparing to the patients rated doctors with “excellent” communication, how rating the doctors with poorer communication performance will change the rate of informal payments.
We used Stata (version 14.2) for all analyses procedures and accounted for the cluster survey design. All statistical tests were two-sided and p < 0.05 was considered to determine statistical significance.
Approval for the study was obtained from the University of Oxford's Ethical Review Committee and Ningxia Medical University's Ethical Review Board.

Section: 3. Results

Table 1 presented the summary statistics of the sample by patients’ trust levels towards the physicians. Among patients who distrusted the physicians, 8.2% of them made informal payment; while 3.1% of the patients who showed strong trust for the physicians made informal payment. Comparing to the patients who strongly trusted physicians, those who distrusted physicians were more likely to be ethnic minority, with no education or primary education , visit township or county-level hospitals, with lower income, and in non-surgical settings. For example, among the patients who strongly trusted physicians, 79.8% visited township or county-level hospitals, comparing to 91.2% among those who distrusted physicians.
Fig. 1 showed the mean and standard deviation (SD) of informal payment rates by patient-reported ratings of trust in their doctors at three levels, ranging from distrust to strong trust. We found that higher trust level was associated with lower informal payment rate. For patients who strongly distrusted the physicians, 17.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.5, 22.3) of them initiated informal payments in the surgical setting. While such rates for patients who expressed “neutral or some trust” and “strong trust” to the physicians were significantly smaller, which were 7.9% (95% CI: 6.9, 8.9) and 8.0% (95% CI: 5.1, 10.9) respectively. In the non-surgical setting, 5.0% (95% CI: 3.7, 6.3) of the inpatient patients who distrusted the physicians reported made informal payments, significantly higher than 2.9% (95% CI: 2.2, 3.6) by the patients with “some trust” to the physicians. Informal payments were rare among non-surgical patients who strongly trusted the physicians. Download: Download high-res image (333KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 1 .

Note: The full content for category of “Some trust” is “Neutral or some trust”.
We presented the regression results in Table 2 , controlling for hospital levels and disease categories of hospital admission, as well as other individual characteristics. Column 1 showed that, in the surgical setting, the difference in the informal payment rates between “Distrust” and “Strong trust” is as large as 11.2 (95% CI: 2.6, 19.8) percentage points, which was statistically significant at the 5% level. In the non-surgical setting, the difference in the informal payment rates as shown in Column 2 was smaller in magnitude between “Distrust” and “Strong trust”, up to 4.1 (95% CI: 0.8, 7.5) percentage points, and this amount was also significant.
Using the Ningxia data source, we further investigated whether the strong association between distrust and informal payment was caused by forced payment (the patients were forced to give physicians extra payments, and consequently, led to the occurrence of both informal payment and distrust). The Ningxia data asked those who made informal payments to consider their trust levels before and after these payments. Results in Fig. 2 clearly show that informal payments largely improved the self-reported trust of those who made them. Before the payments were made, 79% of patients expressed that their trust levels towards the physicians were below 3. The average trust score towards physicians was 2.8. While after the payments were made, only 16% of patients indicated that their trust level towards the physicians were below 3. The average trust score increased to 4.2. Moreover, we did not observe anyone reporting his/her trust levels dropped after making the informal payments. Download: Download high-res image (239KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 2 .

Fig. 3 showed the relationship between informal payment practice and patient rating of doctor's communication. Doctors' communication is divided into “Explaining to patients” and “Listening to patients.” In terms of “Explaining to patients”, we found that for the surgical cases, 16.2% (95% CI: 13.6, 18.8) patients who expressed that their doctors have done “poor” to explain the medical procedures initiated informal payments, significantly higher than the patient-rated “good” (6.8%, 95% CI: 5.8, 7.8) or “excellent” (10.2%, 95% CI: 7.8, 12.6). In the non-surgical setting, among the patients who rated the explaining skills of the doctors as “poor,” 5.9% (95% CI: 5.0, 6.9) of them made informal payments, significantly higher than the patients who rated their physicians' explaining skills as “good” (2.0%, 95% CI: 1.8, 2.2) or “excellent” (1.8%, 0.9, 2.7). The patterns were quite similar when we measured the physicians' communication using “listening to the patients”. Download: Download high-res image (630KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 3 . Informal payment rates among different ratings for doctors' communication performance, data from Health Development of Rural China Program.
The regression results were presented in Table 3 . We found that after controlling for the covariates, the associations between informal payment practice and patient rating of doctor's communication were still significant in most cases - for example, in the surgical setting, comparing with patients who rated the physicians' listening skills as “excellent”, the rating of “poor” was significantly associated with an increase in the informal payment rate by 6.9 (95% CI: 0.5, 13.2) percentage points. The associations were also significant for both explaining skills and listening skilled in the non-surgical setting. However, we didn't find a significant association between explaining skilled and informal payment rate in the surgical setting.
In this case, we were less concerned about the reverse causality between communication ratings and informal payments: It was possible that the ex-post communication will improve after informal payments. However, this could only make the negative correlation between communication ratings and informal payments less strong. There was no particular reason that informal payments would make patients feel that the doctor's communication performance became worse afterward than before. Therefore, the correlation between low communication ratings and high informal payment rating suggested that poor communication was likely to increase informal payments, but not the other way around.
As shown in Table 4 , from the Ningxia survey, we gained some further insights about patients’ motivations for making informal payments. Among the 75 inpatient cases in Ningxia, over 68% of informal payments reported that the primary reason for them to give red packets or/and gifts were to avoid undertreatment (42.7%), overtreatment (5.3%) and medical negligence (20.0%) by doctors. This finding suggested that one critical motivation for making informal payments was to offset the agency problem. Other patient motives did coexist, but none of them played a dominant role.

Section: 4. Discussion and conclusion

This paper proposed that an important motivation for patients to initiate informal payments – to mitigate the physician agency problem. We found that patients' concern about physician agency problems is a significant driver for informal payments. The data showed that patients were more likely to make informal payments when they showed low trust towards their physicians. In line with the proposition, the HDRCP data source showed that lower ratings of doctor's communication skills given by the patients, which reflected patients' perceptions of the physician as an agent for the patient's interests, were strongly associated with higher informal payment rates. The physicians' skills in listening to the patients were particularly strongly associated with the trust levels reported by the patients. The Ningxia data further found that after patients made informal payments, their reported trust level towards the physicians largely improved. Among the 75 informal payment cases, about two-thirds of informal payments were directly related to patients' concerns about physicians' behavior (avoiding undertreatment, overtreatment, or medical negligence), which indicated that patients made informal payments to avoid undertreatment and medical negligence.
Our results suggest that, in a health system , where misalignment between doctors' incentives/motivations and patients' interests is widespread, informal payment can be viewed as an effort by the patients to align the physicians. This is consistent with the previous literature on other low- and middle-income countries, such as Greece, Hungary, Albania , arguing fear to be a key motivation for informal payment – the patients were afraid that the physicians would provide inappropriate services if they didn't give extra payment ( Gaal et al., 2006a , Gaal et al., 2006b ; Gaal et al., 2006). A recent paper by Currie et al. (2013) also showed that in a field experiment in urban Chinese hospital outpatient clinics , when patients gave small gifts, doctors responded with better service and fewer unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics ( Curriea, Lin and Meng, 2013 ). China, similar to the other low- and middle-income countries, particularly those in transitional economies , had severe physician agency problem - the public perceived a low level of medical professionalism as many physicians redirected their discontent toward a system which underappreciated their efforts to a bad attitude toward patients, and recommended unnecessary drugs and procedures merely for short-term profits, without fully considering patients' needs. All these institutional features stimulated distrust between patients and doctors ( Blumenthal and Hsiao, 2005 ). In this case, informal payment occurred as a breaking point to align the motivations of the physicians and patients by improving the income of the physicians. Our result supported this point by presenting the finding that trust level actually improved to a large extent after the informal payments were made.
Furthermore, our result suggests that in order to curtail informal payments, policymakers may take steps to reverse the loss of trust between patients and doctors. Merely raising physician salaries may have limited effect, because higher salaries may not be sufficient to ensure physicians' commitments to patients' best interests. Realigning physicians' incentives with patients' interests with payment system reforms is one of the factors, which facilitates a trust relationship between patients and doctors. Since informal payments could be regarded as patients’ self-protection, it is also important to set up channels for patients to make complaints and have access to resolution-dispute mechanisms to reduce informal payments. There was evidence from Moldova showing that enabling the patients to address a complaint directly to the physicians or to the Ministry of Health (MoH) increased public confidence towards the medical staff and MoH ( Vian et al., 2014 ).
Yet it is notable, that the motivations of informal payments are rather complex; related actors and institutions could perform very different in different developing countries ( Kelsall et al., 2016 ). The incentive to mitigate physician agency problem is only one of them. The other motivations include to bypass waiting queue, compete for the scarce resource, express gratitude, rent-seeking, etc. ( Ensor, 2004 ; Kaitelidou et al., 2013 ; Lewis, 2000 ; Zhou and Zhang, 2014 ). Context-based actions and policies are needed to overcome this problem. However, better regulation is generally required in all settings. The basis of the regulation system is to increase the cost of accepting informal payments ( Ensor, 2004 ). This method has been widely practiced in developed countries ( Zandian et al., 2019 ). Broadly speaking, the reform of governmental regulation systems in the health sector, and the reform of governance in medical organizations to establish accountability are all relevant to eliminate the informal payments. However, the regulation approach didn't yield tangible results in addressing informal payments in the context of Greece, probably because regulation itself cannot fully mitigate the physician agency problems and provide assurance to patients ( WHO, 2018 ). Similar argument was also made by Khan with the example of the Enclosures of the 16th century ( Khan, 2012 ). Therefore, regulation should not be considered as the panacea for informal payments and other related problem. Rather, as Khan argued, that a more holistic approach that involves a wide range of social, normative, cultural, and institutional factors should be developed to shape the health system ( Khan, 2012 ).
We recognize that this paper has five limitations: First, First, patient-reported trust may not capture the perception of physician agency. For example, trust may reflect confidence in a physician's technical competency ( Hall et al., 2001 ; Mechanic and Meyer, 2000 ), which can be partially addressed by controlling for primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Nevertheless, if a physician's technical competency plays a dominant role in the trust measurement, we may instead observe patients who reported trust or strong trust come with high informal payment rates, especially when a patient made payments to recruit a capable doctor. The correlation between low patient-reported trust levels and high informal payment rates is to be expected if trust measures the perception of the physician agency problem, and informal payments are made to address patients' concerns about the agency behavior.
Second, we use patient-reported trust and patient-rated doctor's communication as measurements for patients' perceptions of the physician agency problem, and both measures suffer from the concerns of reverse causality. Although the Ningxia data allows us to identify the trust levels/communication ratings both before and after the informal payments were made and therefore, provide a solution to the reverse causality, we are not able to replicate it with the national data.
Third, due to data unavailability, we are not able to analyze informal payments in urban areas. Fourth, the Ningxia Survey didn't allow for multiple choices about patients' primary goals of payment informal payment, yet it is possible that a payment made as both a gift and an obligation ( Vian et al., 2015 ). Last, the data we used in this study were self-reported and might suffer from self-report bias.
This paper is among the first ones investigating the motivations of informal payment from a physician agency problem perspective in the context of China. As informal payment is still a concerning issue for many developing countries, this study shed light on the potential behavioral factors in explaining informal payments, on which the current literature has put insufficient attention. Our study suggests that to mitigate informal payments, improving alignment between doctors' incentives and patients’ interests would be essential. It would be important for future investigation to determine how physicians reacted after receiving informal payments, for example, whether or not physicians were more likely to provide appropriate care and even reduce medical expenditures by reducing unnecessary care.
