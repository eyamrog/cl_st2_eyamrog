Title: Grandparenthood and risk of mortality: Findings from the Health and Retirement Study


Abstract: Abstract

Grandparenthood constitutes a significant role for older adults and may have important health implications. Our study examines the grandparenthood-mortality nexus, controlling for an array of potentially confounding variables. Longitudinal survey data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used, comprising twelve biennial waves from 1992 to 2014 with linked data on vital status derived from the National Death Index. The sample included 27,463 participants aged ≥51 years with at least one child. Cox proportional hazard models tested the association between grandparenthood and mortality risk with adjustment for socio-demographic variables, for social variables including characteristics of and contact with children, and for health variables, including measures of general, functional and mental health. Grandparenthood overall was unassociated with mortality risk in both women and men. However, the subpopulation of younger, partnered grandmothers with a larger number of grandchildren tended to exhibit a substantial increase in mortality risk as compared to women without grandchildren.

Section: 1. Introduction

Research on the health implications of grandparenthood is bourgeoning. A large number of relevant studies have focused on the role of active grandparenting and, specifically, the provision of childcare in grandparents' well-being (e.g., Chen et al., 2015 ; Di Gessa et al., 2016 ; Hughes et al., 2007 ), including mortality (e.g., Choi, 2020 ; Hilbrand et al., 2017 ). Substantially fewer studies have investigated the relationship between grandparental status and well-being (e.g., Arpino et al., 2018 ; Sheppard and Monden, 2019 ) and, to the best of our knowledge, only one study thus far has examined the association between grandparenthood and mortality ( Christiansen, 2014 ). This is unfortunate, because the grandparent role clearly extends beyond active grandparenting, encompassing, for example, grandparent expectations, meaning, and satisfaction ( Thiele and Whelan, 2006 ). These other aspects of grandparenthood may also have implications for grandparents’ health and survival, but their potential effects remain poorly understood.
Our overall objective is therefore to examine the relationship between grandparental status and health in further detail, comparing grandparents with non-grandparents and using mortality as our endpoint. We consider this as an important goal for several reasons: Previous evidence suggesting short-term salutary effects of grandparenthood and, specifically, the provision of non-intensive grandchild care has recently been challenged by studies employing fixed effects models (e.g., Ates, 2017 ; Danielsbacka et al., 2019 ; Sheppard and Monden, 2019 ). However, whereas most individuals today will experience grandparenthood ( Margolis and Verdery, 2019 ), only about half of U.S. and European grandparents do provide some kind of grandchild care at all ( Hank and Buber, 2009 ; Harrington Meyer and Kandic, 2017 ). Furthermore, the grandparent role often extends across several decades (see Leopold and Skopek, 2015 ), that is, well into grandparents' later life and grandchildren's adulthood, when the provision of grandchild care is no longer part of the grandparent role (e.g., Silverstein, 2019 ; Wetzel and Hank, 2020 ). The long-term health consequences of grandparent status as distinct from the grandparent role involving caregiving responsibilities are mostly unknown. A substantial body of research suggests, though, that parenthood is associated with individuals' long-term, post-reproductive, health and mortality (e.g., Barclay and Kolk, 2019 ; Hipp et al., 2019 ; Högnäs et al., 2017 ). Despite some differences by sex, timing, and partnership history (e.g., Henretta, 2007 ; Mirowsky, 2005 ), there is fairly robust evidence suggesting a U-shaped relationship, where parents of two children exhibit the lowest mortality risk (see Barclay and Kolk, 2019 ; Högnäs et al., 2017 ). However, these findings, whose underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood, cannot be generalized to grandparents, whose commitments and roles differ substantially from parents. Gaining further knowledge about possible health and survival differences between grandparents and non-grandparents is therefore badly needed.
We advance previous research—specifically Christiansen's (2014) study of register data from Norway—in several ways: First , exploiting twelve waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), our study assesses the association between grandparenthood and mortality in a different demographic and welfare state context, namely the United States. Resulting from differences in fertility and mortality patterns, Norwegians—on average—experience the transition to grandparenthood later than their American counterparts and spend fewer years with their grandchildren (see Leopold and Skopek, 2015 ). They are also less likely then U.S. grandparents to co-reside with grandchildren in a three- or skipped-generation household, due to the more generous ‘social democratic’ welfare regime in Norway (e.g., Bordone et al., 2021 ; see Grundy (2009) for a related discussion of welfare state arrangements and mothers' post-reproductive survival). Both aspects might impact the grandparenthood-mortality nexus. Second , we control for an array of social and health variables, which were not available in the Norwegian register data. We pay particular attention to differential associations between grandparenthood and mortality by gender, education, race and age. Our analysis is also sensitive to grandparents' partnership and work status to account for temporal overlap with job and marital obligations. Third , we assess the grandparenthood-mortality relationship across the entire mid- and late-adulthood range (51–106) so as to capture a much greater proportion of mortality compared to Christiansen (2014) study which was limited to mortality before the age of 73.

Section: 2. Mechanisms linking grandparenthood and mortality: Theory and evidence

Grandparenthood and mortality may be linked through various not mutually exclusive social mechanisms. A first mechanism relates to the grandparent role or status, which does not necessarily include active grandparenting. It is one of the few new roles taken on in middle and later life and has been proposed to be characterized by a number of principal dimensions, namely grandparent expectations, behaviors, meanings, and satisfaction ( Thiele and Whelan, 2006 ). A vast majority of older people indeed perceives the grandparent role as important (e.g., Mahne and Motel-Klingebiel, 2012 ). Also, there is some empirical evidence suggesting, for example, associations between grandparenthood and greater life-satisfaction ( Arpino et al., 2018 ; Powdthavee, 2011 ) and younger subjective age ( Bordone and Arpino, 2016 ; Kaufman and Elder, 2003 ). Positive effects are consistent with evolutionary reasoning that having and nurturing grandchildren should result in emotional benefits (e.g., Tanskanen and Danielsbacka, 2019 : Chapter 7), which may translate into survival benefits. Other studies, however, did not find effects of grandparent role importance ( Muller and Litwin, 2011 ) or of the transition to grandparenthood ( Condon et al., 2018 ; Sheppard and Monden, 2019 ) on psychological/subjective well-being. In fact, the work by Christiansen (2014) even suggested a significant survival disadvantage among grandparents in Norway. Whereas this was a stable result in grandfathers, grandmothers exhibited elevated mortality risks only if they were married, had many grandchildren (4+), or made the transition to grandparenthood early in the life course (<age 50). While the observed gender differences clearly require further investigation, the general finding of grandparental excess mortality might be explained along the lines of parental depletion models (see Barclay and Kolk, 2019 ), according to which emotional or social stress associated with the (grand-)parent role may result in adverse health effects.
This leads to the second mechanism, which relates to social interaction and social support. Whereas active grandparenting may be associated with positive emotional outcomes and healthier life styles (see Harrington Meyer and Kandic, 2017 ), the overall evidence for salutary effects of grandparents' engagement with grandchildren, specifically the provision of childcare, is mixed (e.g., Ates, 2017 ; Choi, 2020 ; Hughes et al., 2007 ). Importantly, custodial grandparenting has been found to be associated with greater psychological distress (e.g., Hadfield, 2014 ; Hayslip et al., 2019 ). Moreover, Moorman and Stokes (2016) showed that more frequent contact with adult grandchildren and the receipt of functional support without also providing it increased grandparents' depressive symptoms. Although adult grandchildren are more likely to receive support from grandparents than to provide it, they might still constitute an important source of help and care in times of need (e.g., Fruhauf et al., 2006 ; Huo et al., 2018 ). Finally, having grandchildren may also affect grandparents' relationship to their children, although the direction of the effect—and its health-related consequences—are not clear: Tanskanen (2017) , for example, found that grandmothers’ frequency of contact with daughters increased, but their emotional closeness and intimacy with sons decreased after the birth of the first grandchild.
These first two mechanisms, grandparent role and social interaction, cannot be clearly distinguished from one another. For example, the provision of childcare naturally involves both mechanisms. Yet, the first mechanism puts more emphasis on psychological pathways that do not necessarily rely on direct interaction with grandchildren (e.g., identifying as grandparent, worrying about grandchildren), while the second mechanism focuses more on actual contact and social exchanges within intergenerational relationships (e.g., active grandparenting and role enactment).
The third mechanism linking grandparental status with mortality involves selection processes ( Christiansen, 2014 ; also see Choi, 2020 ). For example, the likelihood of becoming a grandparent as well as the timing of the transition depend on prospective grandparents’ own reproductive behaviors (e.g. the age at first birth and the number of children), which have been shown to be associated with mortality ( Henretta, 2007 ; Högnäs et al., 2017 ).
Finally, a fourth mechanism relates to the potential social stratification of the relationship between grandparent status and mortality. Most importantly, educational differences in the likelihood and timing of grandparenthood ( Skopek and Leopold, 2017 ) are paralleled by educational disparities in adult survival (see Hayward et al., 2015 ). Whereas the subjective importance of the grandparent role does not seem to vary by social class ( Mahne and Motel-Klingebiel, 2012 ), education has been suggested to matter for the types of activities grandparents are involved in with their grandchildren ( King and Elder, 1998 ) and for their ability to cope with stressful aspects of grandparenthood ( Mahne and Huxhold, 2015 ). For instance, lower educated grandparents may be called to invest more time and energy, while more highly educated grandparents may provide mainly advisory and financial resources. Importantly, less educated grandparents may perceive their role as more strenuous, because they are more likely to experience a temporal overlap with worker and filial roles ( Leopold and Skopek, 2015 ; Skopek and Leopold, 2017 ). Racial differences in the demography of grandparenthood have decreased substantially and are small for recent cohorts, except for the duration of grandparenthood, which continues to be longer for Whites than Blacks ( Margolis and Verdery, 2019 ). Also, Black grandparents have been shown to be more likely to live in multigenerational and skipped generation households and to provide more hours of grandchild care than their White counterparts. Without sufficient resource buffers they may well be at increased risk of experiencing health disadvantages (e.g., Chen et al., 2015 ; Choi, 2020 ).
Gender differences in the grandparenthood-mortality nexus may result from gendered expectations and actual behaviors regarding the enactment of the grandparent role (e.g., Horsfall and Dempsey, 2015 ; Neuberger and Haberkern, 2014 ). Grandmothers might be at a disadvantage, because they likely face greater obligations to provide childcare than grandfathers (but see Christiansen, 2014 ). Married grandfathers, on the other hand, are fairly free to opt in and out of activities with grandchildren that they enjoy the most, reaping the benefits of active grandparenting (in addition to the survival ‘premium’ for married men; e.g., Rendall et al., 2011 ).
The lack of a coherent theoretical framework and the scarcity of previous empirical research make it difficult to derive specific hypotheses about potential associations between grandparenthood and mortality. Even if our analysis therefore remains explorative, we can still formulate several expectations based on the mechanisms and processes discussed above (also see Choi, 2020 ): Possible survival disadvantages should be largest among less educated, young, Black, working and female grandparents, for whom fulfilling grandparental role expectations may be more challenging and who are therefore less able to reap the role's potential benefits than their counterparts. Conversely, survival advantages should be largest in more highly educated, White, and male grandparents, especially if they are married and thus able to share the potential ‘burden of grandparenthood’ with the grandmother. Finally, because active grandparenting is only one aspect of the grandparent role ( Thiele and Whelan, 2006 ), we expect possible differences in grandparents' and non-grandparents’ survival to remain, even if we control for the provision of grandchild care.

Section: 3. Method

Data stem from the first twelve waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; Sonnega et al., 2014 ), collected biennially between 1992 and 2014 in the U.S. among adults aged 51 years and older. The maximum age in our analytical sample was 106 years. We combined the RAND HRS longitudinal file (version 2), which included data on the respondents' mortality, health and socio-demographic variables, with the RAND HRS family kids file (version 1), which contained data on the respondents’ family structure. Our sample included respondents with at least one biological living child recorded in the family structure data. Non-parents, step-parents only, adoptive parents only, former parents only, and parents with missing information on children were excluded. This was to rule out selection bias caused by parenthood when comparing non-grandparents with grandparents, and to avoid reproduction-driven differences between biological and non-biological parents. Similarly, the variables on family structure pertained to currently alive children only, but disregarded deceased children and those with missing information on vital status. Since the percentage of deceased children was very low (<3% in all waves), the analyses did not further account for potential effects from deceased offspring . To be included in the analyses, respondents had to have complete information on the outcome, predictor and control variables in a wave. Out of 32,578 eligible respondents, 5115 respondents did not fulfil these criteria, resulting in 15.7% missing cases. All but few constant variables (e.g., race) were time-varying and thus updated at every follow-up, including the grandparenthood indicators – i.e., respondents could transition from non-grandparenthood into grandparenthood, and/or have additional grandchildren over time. Respondents on average had 4.8 complete waves, covering a time span of 12.7 years. The final sample consisted of 81,239 observations from 16,041 women, and 49,610 observations from 11,422 men.
Information on our outcome variable ‘mortality’ was retrieved from death dates registered by the National Death Index (NDI), which was linked to the HRS up to December 31, 2014. Later HRS waves no longer incorporated NDI as a source for death dates and thus were disregarded in our analysis. Survival duration was measured in days, beginning with a respondent's first interview. The duration ended with the death date for deceased respondents, i.e., those who had an NDI entry. For surviving respondents, the duration ended on December 31, 2014, but only if their latest interview was completed prior to that date. If their latest interview was completed after that date—few respondents were interviewed only by March 2015—a duration ended with the latest interview date. A respondent was still included in the analysis and the information on mortality was still used when a respondent dropped out of the survey early and alive.
Every wave incorporated a comprehensive module on the respondents' family structure. In the remainder, we refer to the middle-generation as children and to their respective offspring as grandchildren. Per child, several characteristics were assessed, including number of their own children (i.e., respondent's grandchildren). Our main explanatory variable ‘grandparenthood’ was operationalized as a binary variable that equaled 1 if the respondent had reported at least one grandchild. We also counted the total number of grandchildren, as well as sets of grandchildren, operationalized as the number of children who had at least one child (i.e., one respondent's grandchild). For example, if all grandchildren routed in the same child, there was only one set of grandchildren. If multiple grandchildren pertained to two different children, there were two sets of grandchildren. The number of sets could not exceed the number of grandchildren, and both numbers were identical when all the grandchildren routed in different children, e.g. three children had one child each. The data did not include information on whether a grandchild resided in their parents' household.
Next to accounting for the control variables used in Christiansen's (2014) analysis, we added a number of further potentially important controls, such as indicators of grandparents' health and several characteristics of the children (i.e., the middle-generation). Socio-demographic variables encompassed respondents' age in years, race (non-Hispanic White versus Black and other), education (lower than high-school, high-school, some college, college and above), partnership status (married/partnered, separated/divorced, widowed, never married) and weekly hours of paid work. Parenthood variables that likely influenced survival and the likelihood of becoming a grandparent were additionally considered. These regarded respondents' age at first birth (derived from the age of the oldest child), age at last birth (derived from the age of the youngest child) the respondents' number of children (truncated to a maximum of six to reduce skewness), whether at least one child was a daughter (1 = yes), and the respondents' number of married children. Health variables comprised of five well-established measures: Subjective health was assessed through respondents' self-rated health (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor). Functional health was measured with three indices. First, the IADL index measured limitations in instrumental activities of daily living , namely meal preparation, grocery shopping, making phone calls, taking medication. Second, the mobility index captured limitations in being able to walk several blocks, walk one block, walk across the room, climb several flights of stairs and climb one flight of stairs. Third, the large muscle index indicated limitations in being able to sit for 2 h, get up from a chair, stoop or kneel or crouch, and push or pull a large object. The latter three indices were dichotomized into 1 when at least one limitation was reported versus 0 no limitations reported. Correlations between the three functional health measures were low to moderate, ranging from r = 0.16 to r = 0.49. Mental health was assessed with self-reports of depression, using the abbreviated CES-D scale of eight binary items, with total depression scores ranging from 0—low to 8—high.
Additional control variables concerned caregiving, help and contact frequency. These variables served for robustness tests only, as they were not available for all waves. Importantly, from Wave 2 onwards, respondents indicated whether they provided grandchild care for a year or longer (1 = yes). From Wave 3 onwards, respondents reported whether they received any help from their children (1 = yes). Help may have involved assistance with general or instrumental activities of daily living, household chores, errands and transportation, managing the respondent's money, financial transfers and paying health care costs. In addition, per child, number of contact—in person, by phone or mail—was calculated from the frequency and period of contacts within the past 12 months reported by respondents. The average across children captured a respondent's yearly contact frequency with children, which is closely associated with grandparents' contacts to grandchildren (e.g., Wetzel and Hank, 2020 ). This variable was available from Wave 3 onwards, but skipped for re-interviewed households in Wave 4 and all even-numbered waves from Wave 8 forward.
These additional variables, as well as the grandparenthood and parenthood variables, comprised of composite measures from respondents' children. The following imputation rules were handled for missing items on children. Sum scores, such as total number of a respondent's grandchildren, were computed only when all children had information on the item ‘number of children’. A dummy, such as having at least one daughter, was coded 0 if all children were male. If any of the childrens' items contained a missing value, the dummy was set to missing—however, only if all remaining non-missing items indicated a male gender (since having a daughter was still possible, yet unknown). The dummy was coded 1 if any of the children was female, regardless of the number of missing items (since having a daughter was evident). In other words, observing one daughter sufficed. Average scores, such as contract frequency with children, and maximum scores, such as childrens' age (needed to compute respondents' age at first birth) were constructed when information existed for at least 50% of the children (e.g., contact frequency was known for two out of four children), but set to missing otherwise. Descriptive statistics of all variables are summarized in Table 1 . They refer to the latest observation to allow better comparison between non-grandparents and grandparents, who may have transitioned into grandparenthood only later during the study. Table 1 .

Cox proportional hazard models tested the association between grandparenthood and risk of mortality. These survival models are suitable for estimating non-reoccurring events based on time-continuous data. Cox models rely on the assumption that the hazards of the different strata, e.g., age cohorts, are proportional over time and thus survival curves run parallel. However, with increasing age , the risk of mortality increases disproportionally (the very old have a higher likelihood of dying than the young old), while with increasing follow-up time life expectancy rises (younger cohorts live longer than older cohorts). There was a significant violation of the proportional hazard assumption for age and wave. A common solution to this problem is stratification, where each stratum is assigned its own baseline hazard. We therefore stratified the Cox models for three age groups (<65 years, 65–79 years, >79 years) and all HRS waves.
The Cox models were sequentially adjusted for the set of socio-demographic variables (Model 1), parenthood variables (Model 2) and, finally, health variables (Model 3). All models were estimated separately for women and men to allow gender-specific baseline hazards and examine the modifying role of gender. Likewise, the fully adjusted models including all variables (Model 3) were run separately for the different categories of education, race, age, partnership status and hours worked for the inspection of subpopulation-specific effects. Note that this inspection used the temporal status (and respective risk of mortality at this time point) of a person, meaning that if during the study, for example, partnership status changed from married to separated, a person may have been included in both groups of married and separated participants. Furthermore, we tested for linear associations between grandparenthood and mortality by estimating the fully adjusted models with number and sets of grandchildren as predictors. Finally, our analyses were complemented with robustness tests that focused on additional adjustment variables. We outline the analytical details in the results section.

Section: 4. Results

The results of the Cox proportional hazard models accounting for socio-demographic control variables only (Models 1) suggest no association between grandparenthood and earlier death for either women ( Table 2 ; HR = 1.091, 95% CI: 0.958–1.242) or men ( Table 3 ; HR = 1.113, 95% CI: 0.975–1.271). Associations also remained statistically insignificant, when parenthood and health variables were considered in Models 2 & 3. It seems important to note, however, that even in the fully adjusted models the size of the ‘grandparenthood’ coefficients (HR = 1.076 for women; HR = 1.088 for men) remained in an order of magnitude very similar to the 9% survival disadvantage for Norwegian men reported by Christiansen (2014) .

In addition to these main models, we ran further gender-specific analyses distinguishing socio-demographic subgroups by education, race, age, partnership and work status, re-estimating the fully adjusted model separately for each group ( Table A4 in the appendix). Overall, there is neither indication of a systematic educational gradient in the grandparenthood-mortality nexus, nor do we observe statistically significant racial differences. When turning to age and partnership status, however, our results suggest strongly elevated mortality risks for younger (<age 65) grandmothers (HR = 1.408, 95% CI: 1.063–1.863) and for partnered grandmothers (HR = 1.493, 95% CI: 1.177–1.893). Furthermore, there was a borderline significant survival advantage for widowed grandmothers over non-grandmothers (HR = 0.819, 95% CI: 0.670–1.000). While mortality risks varied largely across the amount of hours worked, risks not differ significantly. Fig. 1 summarizes the significant findings for the subpopulations.

Hazard ratios (HR) with confidence intervals (CI) from fully adjusted Cox models for subgroups where grandparenthood was associated with significant differences in mortality: young, married and widowed grandmothers (ref. = non-grandmothers).
To test for nonlinearities in the association between survival and grandparenthood, we re-estimated the fully adjusted Cox models with the number (sets, respectively) of grandchildren as a factor variable, using zero as reference category ( Table A5 in the appendix). Grandmothers with four or more grandchildren exhibit a substantially higher risk of mortality than non-grandmothers, even after controlling for parenthood and health variables (HR = 1.225, 95% CI: 1.034–1.452). This finding was corroborated when looking at sets of grandchildren. The number of grandchildren was unrelated to men's survival, whereas having four sets yielded an increased mortality risk similar to the one in women (HR = 1.327, 95% CI: 1.050–1.678).
In a final step, several additional control variables were included in the fully adjusted Cox models (see Table A6 in the appendix). Because these variables were not measured across all waves and respondents, the sample sizes were much smaller for these analyses. To avoid that our conclusions rested on differences in sample sizes, we first performed the fully adjusted Cox models excluding the additional variables but using the reduced sample (Model 1). Next, the additional variables were included and tested on the same reduced sample (Model 2). The most important finding from this supplementary analysis is that the provision of grandchild care turned out to be unrelated to mortality for both women (HR = 0.894, 95% CI: 0.782–1.023) and men (HR = 0.961, 95% CI: 0.840–1.099). The hazard ratios for grandparental status remained insignificant and similar to those in the main analyses. Likewise, effect sizes for young and partnered grandmothers were comparable between the models without and with the additional control variables.

Section: 5. Discussion

This study set out to investigate a largely neglected aspect in recent discussions about the consequences of grandparenthood for well-being, namely differential mortality between grandparents and non-grandparents. Using longitudinal data from twelve waves of the Health and Retirement Study, we did not find statistically significant survival differences by grandparental status. In contrast to our initial expectations, this finding is fairly robust among women and men, Whites and non-Whites, as well as across different levels of educational attainment and work status.
Our analysis also suggests some important exceptions: grand mothers who live with a partner, are younger (<65 years), or have a larger number (more sets, respectively) of grandchildren (≥4) exhibit substantially elevated risks of mortality compared to non-grandmothers. We explain these findings mainly with role strain resulting from gendered role expectations and obligations ( Horsfall and Dempsey, 2015 ; Neuberger and Haberkern, 2014 ). Partnered grandmothers more often than grandfathers (and separated or widowed grandmothers) face contemporaneous overlap with spousal caregiver roles. In addition, younger grandmothers have a higher propensity to be employed rather than retired, which imposes greater time and energy constrains on them. They also likely became mothers at an early age themselves and may have fewer socio-economic resources at their disposal than older grandmothers (e.g., Pienta, 1999 ). Although differences were not statistically significant, the subpopulation-specific results point in this direction: mortality risks were highest among less educated and working grandmothers (note that additionally controlling for household income did not alter these findings). In contrast, there was a survival advantage for widowed grandmothers over widowed non-grandmothers. This may reflect the possibility that grandchildren provide important meaning and joy to their lives, buffering some of the adverse effects on mental health through loss of a spouse.
Importantly, though, the provision of grandchild care—which we accounted for in the additional analyses—turned out to be unrelated to mortality and did not modify the afore-mentioned differences. The potential stresses associated with the grandparent role do not seem to be limited to caregiver burden , but also appear to result from other worries and concerns related to one's grandchildren. Larger numbers and, particularly, more sets of grandchildren—where grandchildren are distributed over multiple families in the middle-generation—require the managing of social contacts with multiple children and sets of grandchildren, which may add to worries about kin and intergenerational transfers (e.g., the provision of emotional and instrumental support) as compared to a focus on a more restricted number or set of grandchildren.
Our analysis of American grandmothers is largely consistent with Christiansen's (2014) Norwegian study, which found elevated mortality risks in women who become grandmothers at an early age, are married and have many children. However, although Christiansen also found a stable survival disadvantage in grand fathers , our data did not find such differences in men. Although our sample was much smaller, it yielded sufficient number of respondents and deaths to detect potential differences. In other words, we interpret our non-statistically result as a null finding. Christiansen (2014: 95) speculates that grandfathers might derive less benefit from the grandparent role than grandmothers and might feel “ignored” after the birth of a grandchild. These arguments, however, are not entirely convincing given that relationships with grandchildren typically are more distant, both physically and emotionally, than with children. Most grandchildren do not live in their grandparents' household and compete for affection with the partner to a negligible extent. Neither do these arguments contribute to explaining the observed differences between Norway and the United States. More research investigating possible context effects on the grandparenthood-mortality nexus is therefore desirable (also see Grundy, 2009 ).
Our study is not without limitations . The lack of information on the gender and age of grandchildren is particularly unfortunate. In contrast to Christiansen (2014) , we were unable, for example, to calculate the age at which the transition to grandparenthood took place (also see Sheppard and Monden, 2019 ). Next to accounting better for the transition into the grandparent role, it would have been potentially important to consider variations in the association between grandparenthood and mortality across different stages of the family life course (characterized, for example, by changes in grandparents’ role enactment; see Silverstein, 2019 ). Also, we could not accurately account for social contexts, as the measures on social interaction were crude and pertained to contact frequency with the children instead of the grandchildren. Another issue with survey data as opposed to register data is that time-variant variables like grandparenthood were not updated for respondents who dropped out of the survey early. The earlier HRS waves lacked specific measures of grandparental care, which may have suppressed racial patterns in our analysis. Using later waves and a smaller sample from the HRS, Choi (2020) found that providing intensive non-co-resident and multigenerational household grandparenting was associated with lower mortality risk for White grandparents, but the effect was opposite for Black grandparents.
Although we excluded childless respondents and included crucial parenthood (e.g., age at first and last birth) and health variables in our analysis, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of selection processes. First, in our sample, non-grandparents on average were higher educated, had more likely delayed their first birth, had more often paid work and better health than grandparents. Given that early parenthood in the U.S. may reflect a more challenging transition from adolescence into adulthood, survival disadvantages could result from processes earlier in life-course. Having said this, we still believe in a gendered component (e.g., role strain theory) in the grandparent-mortality nexus, as we found survival disadvantages only in younger and partnered grandmothers, not grandfathers. Second, future research could more explicitly address an evolutionary perspective (e.g., Tanskanen and Danielsbacka, 2019 : Chapter 7). On the one hand, grandparenthood may be positively related to survival, as it could be a marker of intrinsic biological robustness: humans are selected first into marriage and their offspring is next selected into marriage, and so on, because of having a genetic endowment that is more adaptable or attractive within a certain population context. On the other hand, grandparenthood may be harmful for maternal survivorship : Producing offspring comes at a biological cost, because parental depletion may result in vulnerability to illness and accelerated aging ( Ziomkiewicz et al., 2016 ). Depletion starts sooner (and thus lasts longer) when offspring is produced earlier, and the reproductive cost is greater for higher number of offspring. Because of this, future research may put more emphasis on the physical health of grandparents, also provided that relevant studies have almost exclusively focused on psychological well-being.
Finally, although our study does not suggest socially stratified grandparental survival penalties along educational or racial lines, it seems nevertheless important to be aware of possible heterogeneities in the grandparenthood-mortality nexus. Future research should therefore closely monitor the degree to which survival disadvantages among grandparents evolve in particularly vulnerable groups , such as non-intact families (e.g., Steinbach and Silverstein, 2019 ).
