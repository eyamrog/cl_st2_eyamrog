Title: Does long-term care insurance reduce hospital utilization and medical expenditures? Evidence from China


Abstract: Abstract

This study examines the effect of long-term care insurance (LTCI) on hospital utilization and expenditures among the elderly in China. We exploit the introduction of public LTCI in Shanghai, China, and implement a difference-in-difference technique to disentangle the effects of LTCI. We find that the introduction of LTCI significantly reduces the length of stay, inpatient expenditures, and health insurance expenditures in tertiary hospitals by 41.0%, 17.7%, and 11.4%, respectively. We find a greater effect on people over 80 years old. Outpatient visits in tertiary hospitals decrease by 8.1% per month after LTCI. The possible mechanisms are the substitution of long term care for hospitalization and health improvement. Our cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that every extra 1 yuan spent in LTCI will generate a decrease of 8.6 yuan in health insurance expenditures.

Section: 1. Introduction

Long-term care (LTC) services for a rapid aging population are in great demand for people with chronic illnesses or disabilities. For instance, across 26 European OECD countries, 50% of people aged 65 and over reported having at least some limitations in their daily activities, among which 33% reported some limitations and a further 17% reported severe limitations in 2017 ( OECD, 2019 ). An insufficient supply of LTC services has led to hospital bed-blocking and increased medical expenditures, often causing allocative inefficiency ( Gaughan et al., 2015 ; Forder, 2009 ). China faces a greater challenge than other countries as it has the largest elderly population over 60 in the world, with 2.41 billion in 2018. Approximately 40 million of China's elderly population have disabilities, according to the “Fourth survey of the living status of the old rural and urban population” conducted by the National Commission for Population Aging of China in 2015. The unmet LTC needs receive increasing concern ( Yu and Sloan, 2017 ; Zhu and Österle, 2017 ). Insufficient LTC services have been partly complemented by medical care using health insurance. Owing to the low quality of primary health care in China, patients persistently overuse costly tertiary hospitals ( Yip et al., 2019 ).
As a response to these challenges, China introduced long-term care insurance (LTCI) program for the elderly in 15 pilot cities in 2016. As one of those cities, Shanghai implemented the LTCI at the beginning of 2017. It covers the elderly over 60 years old who participate in public health insurance schemes, including Urban Employees Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban and Rural Residents Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI). It reimburses the eligible elderly for approximately 85%–90% of the LTC services in the categories recorded in Shanghai LTCI.
The sustainability of the program relies on balancing the aims of providing an affordable LTC service and managing the financial balance of the program. One important question that needs to be addressed, and has attracted interest in the literature is: “will the LTC service reduce hospital utilization and medical expenditures”. Some evidence of the substitution of LTC for hospital care is found. For example, Rapp et al. (2015) find among patients with Alzheimer's disease in France that beneficiaries of LTC subsidies have a significantly lower rate of emergency care than non-beneficiaries. Kim and Lim (2015) find that subsidies for formal home care can lead to a decrease in expenditures for the least able elderly in Korea. Hyun et al. (2014) also report a decrease in the length of hospital stays in Korea. Costa-Font et al. (2018) find that the public subsidization of LTC services in Spain leads to a reduction in hospital admissions (at both intensive and extensive margin) and utilization. These studies address issues caused by confounding unobserved characteristics or non-random allocation of the LTC using the Instrumental Variable method ( Rapp et al., 2015 ), Difference-in-Difference ( Kim and Lim, 2015 ; Hyun et al., 2014 ), or Regression Discontinuity ( Costa-Font et al., 2018 ).
The availability of formal care subsidized by the government may enable the provision of post-acute care at home or in a nursing facility, particularly for patients with rehabilitation care needs (rather than clinical care needs) in the later stages of treatment, thus reducing their length of stay ( Costa-Font et al., 2018 ; Forder, 2009 ). LTC may also improve health through better follow-up and disease management, such as regular nursing rehabilitation and good outpatient medication, provided by an individual care plan, thereby reducing the hospital admission rate ( Rapp et al., 2015 ; Bragstad et al., 2012 ; Scheurer et al., 2012 ). In addition to these mechanisms, LTC may reduce hospitalization by improving psychosocial contact and support ( Deraas et al., 2011 ).
Shanghai's public LTCI program differs from LTC subsidy programs in countries such as France and Spain in that the expenditure of LTC either in a facility or at home will be reimbursed by the insurance program. By contrast, government subsidy programs provide a certain amount of financial support to disabled elderly to pay for home-based formal or informal care. In most OECD countries, LTCI has exhibited limited development. Some interests in financing LTC by insurance exist with the pressure of growing LTC expenditure on government expenditure ( Barr, 2010 ). Evaluating the benefit and cost of Shanghai's LTCI will provide a reference for other aging countries on the feasibility of introducing LTCI.
We examine the effect of introducing LTCI on hospital utilization and medical expenditures in Shanghai, China using 2016–2017 administrative data that contain detailed information about diseases, medical expenditures, hospital admission, length of stay in the hospital, and outpatient visits. We make the following contributions to the literature. First, we employ a policy experiment of introducing LTCI in some districts in Shanghai to identify the effects of LTCI. Second, China, as a developing country with a large elderly population, provides an excellent case for investigating the effect of LTCI on the health care system. Thus, we contribute to the literature by providing broader policy evaluations related to population aging. Third, our analysis contributes to the literature on the substitutability of formal care for health care utilization and, more generally, the cost-effectiveness of the public financing of LTC.
Our main finding is that the introduction of LTC significantly reduces the length of stay, inpatient expenditures, and health insurance expenditures in tertiary hospitals by 41.0%, 17.7%, and 11.4%, respectively. Specifically, through heterogeneity analysis, we find that the mechanism is mainly revealed by the substitution of hospital care for hospitalization and improvement of health. In addition, we find that the savings from the health insurance fund are substantially greater than the cost of the LTCI. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that every extra 1 yuan spent in LTCI can generate a decrease of 8.6 yuan in health insurance expenditures.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the institutional background. Section 3 describes the data and the sample selection procedure. Section 4 presents the empirical framework, and Section 5 presents the results, robustness checks, heterogeneity, and mechanism. Section 6 provides a brief discussion and Section 7 concludes the paper.

Section: 2. Institutional background

To cope with the ever-increasing need for LTC, the Chinese government declared in July 2016 that it would launch the LTCI program in 15 pilot cities. The LTCI arrangement varies across the cities, to ensure the most appropriate institutional designs. The Chinese government aims to create a widespread LTCI system adapted to national conditions by 2020. Shanghai was one of 15 pilot cities in China that implemented LTCI. At the beginning of 2017, the Shanghai government conducted the program on a pilot basis in three of its 16 districts—Xuhui, Putuo, and Jinshan—before launching a LTCI program in 2018 (as shown in Fig. 1 A). Thus, it provides a quasi-natural experimental setting in which we can examine the impact of LTCI on hospital utilization and expenditures.

Notes: The districts adjacent to the pilot districts is used as the control group for robustness check.
The LTCI in Shanghai automatically covers those over 60 years old who are beneficiaries of public health insurance, UEBMI and URRBMI. Public health insurance in China, including UEBMI and URRBMI, has nearly reached a universal coverage at present. Citizens are covered by either UEBMI or URRBMI. The coverage of public health insurance includes outpatient care , inpatient care, and prescription pharmaceuticals . The LTCI is mainly financed by public health insurance funds and the government. To be eligible for LTCI benefits, insured elderly must receive disability assessments and have a specific level of disability.
LTCI covers three categories of service benefits: home care, institutional care, and hospital care (See Table 1 ). Services for home care include support for physical activities or housework, assistance with home bathing, and primary clinical care. Home care is provided at the beneficiary's residence or in the community through local elderly care facilities and community health centers. Institutional care includes long-term residence, meals, residential care , the necessities of daily life, and primary clinical care. Hospital care is provided by community health centers and rehabilitation hospitals, which includes residence, and more medical-intensive clinical care services than institutional care. Table 1 . Description of LTC services. Category Description Benefit Home Care A care worker or nurse in local elderly care facilities and community health centers provides services at the beneficiary's residence or Community Day Care Center. It provides daily life care and primary clinical care, with about 40 kinds of services in total. The daily life care mainly includes bathing, using the restroom, changing clothes, washing hair, assistance in eating and drinking, cleaning, and clearing up surroundings and so on. The primary clinical care mainly includes nursing, measuring blood pressure, measuring blood glucose, injection, oxygen therapy, dental hygiene services, blood draw and so on. The length of home care time depends on the level of disability assessment. If the disability assessment is Level 2 or Level 3, at least three 1-h care packages should be provided weekly. If the disability assessment is Level 4, at least five 1-h care packages should be provided weekly. If the disability assessment is Level 5 or Level 6, at least seven 1-h care packages should be provided weekly. The copayment for home care services is 10%. Institutional Care Private elderly care facilities provide with long-term residence and same kinds of service as home care. The copayment for institutional care services is 15%. Hospital Care Beneficiaries stay in community health centers or rehabilitation hospitals and receive clinical care services. The benefit for hospital care is the same as inpatient benefits of public health insurance. If elderly is covered by UEBMI, the deductible is 700 yuan or 1200 yuan annually which depends on the date of retirement, and the copayment is 8% according to the terms of UEBMI. If elderly is covered by URRBMI, the deductible is 50 yuan, 100 yuan or 300 yuan per time which depends on hospital level. And, the copayment for primary hospital is 10%, that for secondary hospital is 20%, and that for tertiary hospital is 30%.
The copayment is 10% for home care services and 15% for institutional care. To encourage home care, beneficiaries who receive home care continuously over a specific length of time are provided with extra care hours or cash benefits. The LTC provided in rehabilitation hospitals is reimbursed according to the beneficiaries’ health insurance status, that is, either UEBMI or URRBMI.
China did not develop nationwide, integrated, and formal LTC until 2016. According to the survey of the “Status of the elderly in rural and urban China” (2010), about 36.9% of respondents required health care at home, but only 2.7% received it, and roughly 36.5% required rehabilitation nursing services but only 1.7% were provided. Health and daily care services are the primary needs of elderly people with disabilities, but many in China cannot obtain timely access to LTC.
Due to this under-developed LTC, most patients in need of care in China must delay hospital discharge or receive care from their families. As Moses et al. (2019) indicate the global hospitalization rate in 2016 was about 0.1 admissions per capita, whereas that in China it was about 0.18, which is higher than the global average. The average length of hospital stay in China was about 9.4 days in 2016 (China Health Statistics Yearbook), which is longer than that of OECD countries at only about 4.8 days ( OECD, 2019 ). The lack of a developed LTC can partly account for this, as this event may lead to increased hospital care inefficiency. Re-admission rates have also been estimated to be higher among older people, due to the lack of options for transitioning to LTC after hospitalization ( Wang et al., 2014 ).
This study mainly discusses the effect of LTCI on patients who are in tertiary hospitals and LTC facilities. Tertiary hospitals in China are responsible for providing specialist health services and have the largest market share. According to the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA), approximately 54.7% of inpatients in China stayed in tertiary hospitals in 2018. As mentioned above, we define LTC facilities as all community health centers and those rehabilitation hospitals that mainly provide recovery for the elderly. More than 40% of secondary hospitals in Shanghai provide rehabilitation, and nursing care services. Thus, we can expect that the establishment of LTCI would have a negative effect on hospital utilization in tertiary hospitals, but a positive effect for LTC facilities.

Section: 3. Data and samples

This study relies on health insurance claim data. The dataset is a repeated cross-sectional annual sample of those enrolled in public health insurance (including UEBMI and URRBMI). We examine patient-level data for two years, 2016 and 2017 in Shanghai, which cover the period before and after the implementation of LTCI. The data center uses a stratified sampling method, by which it randomly selects 5% of patients in the city and collects all of their health-care utilization records. Patient information includes the dates of admission and discharge, diseases, and health care utilization , and their personal characteristics including gender, date of birth, and type of health insurance. The disadvantage of this data is that individual demographics information, such as education and income, is limited.
This patient dataset has various advantages. First, the dataset provides the latest administrative patient-level data for Shanghai, one of the 15 pilot cities in China that implemented LTCI in 2017. Second, it contains precise and comprehensive information for measuring health-care use and medical expenditures including dates of admission and discharge and the diseases treated.
As discussed, our sample comprises inpatients aged 60 and above who are covered by public health insurance. We exclude patients who are admitted to specialist hospitals such as ophthalmic , infectious disease, dermatology , maternity , and rectal hospitals. We also exclude those with incorrect medical expense records, which account for approximately 6.7% of the entire sample.
To define the treatment status of patients, we must identify the districts they live in, but unfortunately the patient data do not provide information about residence. However, we use the following procedure to establish the exact districts the patients live in. If all primary health care facilities visited were in the same district over the previous year, then we deem that to be the district the patient lived in. Thus, we restrict our sample to patients with information about their residential district. This approach is supported by the fact that: first, each primary health care facility provides very similar medical services, including primary health care, rehabilitation, and disease prevention. Thus, the choice of primary hospital is mainly determined by distance. Second, at least one primary health care facility exists for every block in the district of Shanghai. Shanghai has 246 primary health care facilities across the 214 blocks. Typically such a facility provides services for residences in the same district, so patients will unlikely seek primary care in other districts.
Table 2 shows the summary statistics for the dataset. As our main analysis focuses on tertiary hospitals and LTC facilities, the statistics are reported by the type of medical providers. Table 2 reports the mean values and standard deviations of the key dependent and control variables. The average length of stay in LTC facilities is about 50 days, much longer than that in tertiary hospitals, which is about 8 days. The expenditure per day in LTC facilities is about one-sixth of that in tertiary hospitals. Table 2 . Summary statistics.

Inpatient expenditures per day = Inpatient expenditures/Length of inpatient stay; Reimbursement expenditures per day = Reimbursement expenditures/Length of inpatient stay.

Section: 4. Methods

To evaluate the impact of the LTCI on hospital utilization and medical expenditures, we exploit the variation in the timing of the policy implementation in the three pilot districts of Xuhui, Putuo and Jinshan. We use the following empirical strategy to investigate the effect of LTCI within a standard DID framework. (1) O u t c o m e i t = β 0 + β 1 T r e a t i × P o s t t + β 2 T r e a t i + X i t ' β + θ d + γ t + δ d t + ε i t where the dependent variable Outcome it denotes the length of inpatient stay and a series of inpatient expenditure variables for individual i in month t . The dependent variables in this study are estimated in logarithm form due to the skewed distribution of hospital utilization and medical expenditures. Post t is a binary variable taking a value of 1 for 2017, and a value of 0 for 2016. X i t includes diseases coded in one-digital ICD-10, type of public health insurance, birth month fixed effect, and admission month fixed effect. Θ d is a set of district fixed effects, which absorbs time-invariant differences in observable and unobservable characteristics. γ t is a set of month fixed effects (1–24), which captures time-varying regional changes. δ dt is a set of district-by-month fixed effects, which captures time-varying changes across districts. ε it is the error term.
We use a binary indicator of treatment, Treat i , which equals 1 if individual i resides in any of the three pilot districts of Xuhui, Putuo, or Jinshan, and otherwise the value is 0. This variable captures “treatment” with a LTCI. The point estimate β 1 denotes the effect of the implementation of LTCI. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.

Section: 5. Results

Table 3 shows the estimated effects of LTCI on inpatient care and expenditures in tertiary hospitals using equation (1) . The coefficient of interaction Treat×Post indicates the effect of the implementation of LTCI. Our results show that as expected LTCI did reduce the length of inpatient stay, inpatient expenditures, and reimbursement expenditures in tertiary hospitals. The length of inpatient stay decreased by 41.0%, inpatient expenditures decreased by 17.7%, and reimbursement expenditures decreased by 11.4%. Table 3 .

Table 4 illustrates the effects of LTCI on inpatient care and expenditures in LTC facilities. As expected, estimates of equation (1) show a positive effect on the length of inpatient stay in LTC facilities, with an improvement of about 54.9%. This finding suggests that LTCI encourages more utilization of LTC hospitals and institutions. However, a negative effect is observed on inpatient expenditures and no effect is found on reimbursement expenditures, implying less medical expenditures in LTC facility. Notably, the inpatient expenditures in our data only cover expenditures related to medical services per visit, not including long-term care services. Therefore, a negative effect on inpatient expenditures means that the implementation of LTCI has promoted more elderly to receive long-term care in LTC facilities. As a result, they will spend more on care services than medical services, which drives the lower inpatient expenditures on average. Although the length of stay increases, the health care expenditure covered by health insurance does not. Table 4 . Impact of LTCI on inpatient care and expenditures (LTC facilities).

As indicated in the literature, the negative effect of LTCI on hospital utilization and expenditures is mainly a substitution and a health effect. The former suggests that LTCI can help to transfer patients in need of LTC from hospitals to LTC facilities and reduces the length of hospital stay ( Kemper et al., 2008 ; Rice et al., 2009 ). The latter effect suggests that LTC can improve patients’ health by providing better follow-up, and disease management with individual care plans., and reduces the length of hospital stay ( Deraas et al., 2011 ; Bragstad et al., 2012 ; Scheurer et al., 2012 ; Rapp et al., 2015 ). Although we do not provide direct evidence of substitution and health effects empirically, due to the limited individual information in our administrative data, we can investigate the heterogeneity and attempt to provide indirect evidence for the mechanism.
Age is a primary indicator of care dependence for the elderly. A national survey conducted in 22 provinces in China finds that IADL performance is lower in older people ( Hu, 2012 ), so we use the age group as a proxy for disability. We next explore the effect of LTCI across different age groups to provide indirect evidence for the substitution effect. The premise of the test is that if the substitution effect is present, then we should observe a greater effect among those with more severe disabilities.
Table 5 shows the effects of LTCI on inpatient care and expenditures in tertiary hospitals across younger and older people. Here, we define a binary indicator, older , which equals 1 if the patient is over 80 years old. The specification in Table 5 is the same as that in Table 3 except it includes interaction, Treat×Post×Older, which measures heterogeneity across different age groups. As shown in Table 5 , we find LTCI has a greater effect on inpatient care and expenditures among older people. Table 5 . Heterogeneity analysis: under and over 80 years old (Tertiary hospitals).

Tertiary hospitals in China are responsible for providing specialist health services, rather than the nursing rehabilitation and medication for chronic diseases provided by primary or rehabilitation hospitals. Thus, we use inpatient admissions and outpatient visits in tertiary hospitals as a proxy for health. We next explore the effect of LTCI on inpatient admissions, outpatient visits and expenditures to provide indirect evidence for the health effect. The premise of this test is that if the health effect is present, then we should observe a negative effect on inpatient admissions, outpatient visits and expenditures. Table 6 shows the effect of LTCI on inpatient and outpatient behavior in tertiary hospitals. Table 6 . The effect of LTCI on inpatient and outpatient behavior (Tertiary hospitals).

And in column (2) and (3), outpatient samples are aggregated into individual-month level by patient ID and admission month. The specification is same as equation (1) . Hospital covariates include time-varied characteristics of hospitals, district fixed effects, month fixed effects, and district-by-month fixed effects. Individual covariates include age, gender, type of public health insurance, birth month fixed effect, admission month fixed effect. Standard errors clustered at the district level are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * denote the significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
We use inpatient samples from a tertiary hospital to aggregate inpatient visits by hospital-month, and finally, we can obtain a hospital-month level panel data. Specifically, we estimate similar specifications as equation (1) , and we control time-varied characteristics of hospitals, district fixed effects, month fixed effects, and district-by-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. We define the hospitals in the pilot hospitals as the treatment group and others as a control group. The first column of Table 6 shows the results. As expected, we find that the LTCI reduced significantly hospital admissions, and the magnitude of the effect is approximately 9.7% (the mean of inpatient visits is 27.8).
We aggregate outpatient samples to individual-month levels by patient ID and admission month. Then we can obtain the number of outpatient visits and expenditures per individual per month and use the same specification as in Table 3 . The results in the columns (2) and (3) of Table 6 indicate that LTCI reduces outpatient visits per month by 8.2% and outpatient expenditures by 17.7% in tertiary hospitals.
The key assumption in the DID specification is that the selection of pilot districts is uncorrelated with other determinants of changes in health care and expenditures. A common trend test is typically conducted to address this, as it can empirically determine the same time trends of the dependent variables over time between treatment and control groups. Following Moser et al. (2014) , we estimate the DID coefficient β q separately for each month, (2) O u t c o m e i t = β 0 + ∑ t = − 5 5 β t T r e a t i × M o n t h t + X i t ' β + θ d + γ t + δ d t + ε i t where the variable Month t represents an indicator variable for each month before and after the implementation of LTCI. Here, we exclude December of 2016 as the benchmark category. Fig. 2 depicts the estimates of each month's coefficients and shows that the coefficients are close to 0 before the implementation of LTCI and decrease toward the end. These results suggest that there are no confounding pre-existing trends in the key outcomes. Download: Download high-res image (381KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig. 2 . Common Trend Test.

Figure A, B, C show the time tends for inpatient care and expenditures in tertiary hospitals. The dash line are 95 percent confidence intervals.
Furthermore, we use the districts adjacent to the pilot districts as the control group ( Fig. 1 B) to show the robustness of the main results ( Table 7 ). As expected, we observe a consistent and similar estimate, suggesting that the estimates are robust across different control groups. Table 7 .

To address the issue that the results may be driven by other policies, we restrict the sample to people aged between 40 and 60, younger than eligible age of LTCI and replicate the regression in equation (1) . The premise of the test is that if other policies drove the results, then we should also have observed a significant effect on people aged between 40 and 60 years old. As shown in Table 8 , we find no significant effect over this subsample. These results provide evidence that estimated effects are unlikely to be driven by other policies. Table 8 .

Section: 6. Discussion

To compare the benefit and cost of LTCI, we conduct a simple cost-benefit analysis. We simplify the analysis by combining the LTCI payment and relevant management costs to derive the overall cost, whereas the benefit is the decrease in health insurance payments for patients in tertiary hospitals. In fact, the benefits include many other aspects, such as health improvements in beneficiaries and caregivers, substitution to informal care provided by family members, and labor performance improvement ( Rice et al., 2009 ; Charles and Sevak, 2005 ; Schmitz and Westphal, 2015 ; Fu et al., 2017 ). Omitting these benefits leads to a conservative result. According to a recent report by the Shanghai government, 13.6 million yuan has been paid out from LTCI for long-term care by the end of 2017. As a rule of thumb, the management cost is estimated to be approximately 5% of the LTCI payment. Thus, the cost of LTCI implementation is roughly 14.3 million yuan.
The benefits of LTCI include the reduction in inpatient expenditures per visit (as shown in Table 3 ) and the reduction in inpatient admissions (column (1) of Table 6 ). Multiplying our baseline estimate (column 3 of Table 3 ) by the total health insurance payment for inpatient care in tertiary hospitals in treated districts during 2016 implies that approximately 45 million yuan of health insurance was saved after the LTCI was implemented. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the LTCI reduced hospital admissions by 9.7%, and total hospital admissions in tertiary hospitals were roughly 58,560 among treated districts during 2016. Then, we multiply the reduction in inpatient admission by the average payment by health insurance. Finally, we can obtain the savings due to the reduction in inpatient admissions of approximately 78 million.
Our estimates suggest that the benefit of decreased health insurance payments after LTCI began (approximately 123 million yuan) is greater than the cost of implementing LTCI (approximately 14.3 million yuan). Our conservative result shows that every 1 yuan spent on LTCI will generate a reduction in health insurance expenditures that corresponds to approximately 8.6 yuan fall in expenditures.
The findings in the literature suggest a negative relationship between LTC services and health care utilization (expenditures). For example, Costa-Font et al. (2018) examine a reform in Spain that extended the qualification of LTC beneficiaries, and they find a less intense reduction in hospital admissions and length of stay. Rapp et al. (2015) examine the effect of home care subsidies in France on emergency care rates and find that the rate of using emergency care was reduced by roughly 1.3%. Gaughan et al. (2015) investigate the effect of a greater supply of nursing home beds or lower prices on delayed hospital discharges in England. They find that an increase in care home beds by 10% (approximately 250 additional beds) can reduce delayed discharges by approximately 6%–9%.
However, we find a larger effect. Previous studies mainly examine the effect of formal LTC or informal care subsidies on health care utilization and expenditures, but we provide credible evidence for the effect of LTCI implementation. As LTCI program provides benefits proportional to the expenditure, whereas subsidies provide a certain amount of financial support, the severely disabled beneficiaries enjoy more benefits in LTCI. This case is one of the explanations that the magnitude of our estimates is greater than that in other studies.
Hyun et al. (2014) examine the effects of the introduction of LTCI on the length of stay for senior citizens in South Korea. They found that the length of stay of levels 1 and 2 LTCI beneficiaries decreased by 18.2% and 7.2%, respectively. Our estimate for the length of stay in tertiary hospitals is greater partly because the LTCI program in Shanghai covers more services, either in home care or institutional care. Another possible reason is that the long-standing lack of LTC in China caused a larger short term effect than countries, such as Korea, which introduced LTCI earlier.

Section: 7. Conclusion

Although developed and developing countries face the challenge of rising health expenditures driven by increasingly ageing populations, previous studies mainly focus on developed countries such as England, South Korea, and France, and examine the effect of LTC subsidies on health care (expenditures). Studies focus on the effect of the introduction of LTCI in China are limited. The elderly in China suffer from an insufficient LTC supply and a fragmented health care system, and a cost-effectiveness of LTCI remains unknown. We address these questions by drawing on quasi-experimental evidence from the implementation of LTCI in Shanghai, China to examine the effect on hospital utilization and expenditures.
Three findings emerge from DID estimations. First, the implementation of LTCI significantly reduces the length of stay, inpatient expenditures, and reimbursement expenditures in tertiary hospitals by 41.0%, 17.7%, and 11.4%, respectively. In addition, we find an increase of 54.9% in the length of stay in LTC facilities. Second, our analysis of heterogeneity and the mechanism finds that the effect on inpatient care and expenditures is stronger among those over 80, and the introduction of LTCI also decreases outpatient visits in tertiary hospitals. These results provide indirect evidence that the implementation of LTCI not only substitutes for the patient receiving LTC in hospitals, but also improves the health status of LTCI beneficiaries. Third, the cost-effectiveness analysis of LTCI indicates that every extra 1 yuan spent in LTCI will generate a decrease of 8.6 yuan in inpatient expenditures, suggesting that the implementation of LTCI helps to improve the allocation of health insurance funds.
This study has several limitations. For instance, we acknowledge that the evidence for the mechanism is suggestive only because of the limited individual information. We do not differentiate the treatment effects from different mechanisms, which may have important policy implications. Identifying and differentiating such mechanisms in future studies will thus be beneficial.
