Title: Education, immigration and rising mental health inequality in Sweden


Abstract: Abstract

Educational and income gradients in health are well established in the literature but there is need for a better understanding of how mental health inequalities change over time, and what drives the development. We aim to study how psychiatric diagnosis and its income-related inequality have changed over time in Sweden and to make a first attempt at disentangling the development by decomposing any changes in terms of changes in two important demographic characteristics: education and migration background.
We use administrative patient data to study psychiatric inpatient diagnosis in the years 1994 and 2011. The study population comprises all individuals aged 31–64 years living in Sweden. Income-related inequalities are measured by the Concentration Index (CI). We decompose changes in the probability of receiving a diagnosis and changes in income-related inequality over time to understand the role of changing demographics.
Our results show that over the study period the probability of receiving a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis increased by 12.6%, while the relative and absolute income-related inequalities in diagnosis increased by 48.2% and 66.7% respectively. In 2011, more than half of psychiatric inpatients were found among the poorest fifth of the population. The decomposition results suggest that changes in education and migration background have not played a substantial role in determining these increases. Education levels increased substantially over the study period which would be expected to protect against mental ill-health. Instead, we find that diagnoses have become more concentrated amongst the lowest educated individuals and the lowest income families, groups who appear to be increasingly disadvantaged. The growing proportion of individuals with foreign background in Sweden does, in fact, predict small increases in the probability of diagnosis, while the impact on diagnosis inequality varies depending on the definition of foreign background.

Section: 1. Introduction

Educational and income gradients in health are well established in existing research ( Conti et al., 2010 ; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2006 ; van Doorslaer and Koolman, 2004 ). Several health gradients have been found to increase over time ( Hu et al., 2016 ; J. P. Mackenbach et al., 2016 ; J. P. Mackenbach et al., 2015 ; Johan P. Mackenbach et al., 2018 ), also for mental health ( Barr et al., 2015 ; Hong et al., 2011 ), but overall there is a dearth of published research studying trends in mental health inequality. There is a need for a better understanding of mental health gaps that are related to socioeconomic status, how such inequalities develop and what drives them.
Education is closely linked to mental health. In Sweden, there is evidence of a negative correlation between educational performance and attainment in 9th grade and suicide in young adulthood ( Bjorkenstam et al., 2011 ; Kosidou et al., 2014 ; Zammit et al., 2014 ). Low school performance has also been linked to depression-related hospitalization in adolescence ( Jonsson et al., 2012 ). The Lancet Commission on global mental health and sustainable development identifies education as one of the most important social determinants of mental health ( Patel et al., 2018 ), but individuals who suffer from poor mental health are often exposed to a combination of risk factors , making the causal effect of education on mental health difficult to disentangle. Similarly, migration status has been linked to mental health problems ( Bronstein and Montgomery, 2011 ; Fazel et al., 2005 ) but such associations are likely to vary with different factors, for example, if the displacement was forced or not (refugees vs labour migrants), sociodemographic characteristics of the migrant, economic opportunities in the immigration country as well as the health measures under consideration ( Lindert et al., 2009 ; Porter and Haslam, 2005 ).
Over the past decades, overall education levels in Sweden have increased substantially. The share of the population with only mandatory schooling almost halved while the share of higher educated individuals nearly doubled ( Statistics Sweden, 2019b ). At the same time, Sweden has seen a steady increase in the share of the population with foreign background resulting both from immigration during global refugee crises, the reunification of family members, as well as immigration due to labour and studies ( Statistics Sweden, 2019a ). These demographic changes may very well be linked to the development of mental health and its distribution, which motivates our interest in looking at changes in mental ill-health, and its inequality, over the past decades. Our aim is to study how income-related inequalities in psychiatric inpatient diagnosis have changed among the adult population in Sweden and to make a first attempt at disentangling the development by explaining any changes in health and health inequality, in terms of demographic changes in education level and foreign background. Because our focus is inequality, and specifically income-related mental health inequality over time, we use the commonly applied Concentration Index (CI) that allows for a consistent and meaningful comparison of inequality over time. We are the first to decompose changes in health inequality over time by using a newly developed method to decompose summary measures of health inequality, combined with the well-known Oaxaca–Blinder (OB) decomposition technique ( Blinder, 1973 ; Oaxaca, 1973 ) commonly used in the field of economics. This is an important contribution since we illustrate how OB decomposition of changes in health can be complemented with decomposition of changes in relative and absolute inequality, with similar interpretations. The findings of this study could be a first step to improving our understanding of the development of mental health inequalities, specifically how population changes may relate to the development over time.

Section: 2. Data

We use register data from the Swedish Interdisciplinary Panel (SIP) administered by the Centre for Economic Demography at Lund University, Sweden. SIP contains data from various administrative databases such as hospital registers from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, as well as the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market Studies and the Register of the Total population from Statistics Sweden. The study population used in this study comprises of cross-sections of all individuals aged 31–64 years, living in Sweden in calendar years 1994 or 2011. Ethical approval for the study has been obtained through the Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden (2012/627 and 2017/813).
Psychiatric inpatient diagnoses that are common among adults are included (see supplementary materials for a detailed description). Individuals are coded as having a psychiatric diagnosis if they had at least one such diagnosis in the given year, zero otherwise. We use household disposable income to rank individuals by socioeconomic status. Household disposable income is equivalised (taking into account the household composition) according to the Statistics Sweden equivalence scale from 2001.
Our aim is to explain potential changes in the probability of getting a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis and its income-related inequality in terms of changes in education level and foreign background among the population. Foreign background is defined in two variables: foreign-born or not; foreign-born parents or not. Education level is categorised in three levels by years of schooling: mandatory <10 years; secondary 10–12 years; and higher >12 years. Explanatory variables also include sex (female or male) and age (continuous by year and centred on age 31 years). Data on income is extracted from the year before diagnosis to reduce the impact of that specific diagnosis, while data on other variables are extracted on the year of diagnosis. Individuals with missing information on income are dropped from the sample and we control for missing information on foreign background and education in our analyses.

Section: 3. The empirical approach

First, we investigate the associations between our identified demographic and socioeconomic factors and i) the probability of getting a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis, and ii) the concentration indices of relative and absolute income-related inequality in psychiatric inpatient diagnosis in each calendar year 1994 and 2011. Second, we investigate the contribution of each demographic/socioeconomic factor by decomposing the changes in probability of diagnosis and diagnosis inequality over time.
To summarize the degree of income-related relative inequality in psychiatric diagnoses in calendar years 1994 and 2011 we use the Relative Concentration Index (CI r ), which is a mean-standardized measure allowing for comparison of inequality over time. By using a standardized population-level measure of inequality, we make sure that differences over time are meaningful and not just driven by changes in the composition of the population ( Wagstaff et al., 1991 ). We estimate the CI r using the following formula: (1) CI r = 2 μ H cov ( Y H , R ) where Y H represents psychiatric inpatient diagnosis, μ H , represents the mean probability of receiving at least one psychiatric inpatient diagnosis in a given year and R is the cumulative socioeconomic rank (measured by lag of income) running from zero to one (poorest to richest). The CI r is a summary statistic that reflects the degree of inequality in the population. It can range from −1 to +1, where 0 reflects an equal distribution, and −1 (+1) reflects a complete concentration of the outcome among the poorest (richest). Since the outcomes reflect the presence of a diagnosis, a negative CI r means that diagnoses are disproportionately concentrated among the poor.
There is no consensus among researchers regarding which measures should be used to evaluate changes in health inequality (J. P. Mackenbach et al., 2016 ). Yet, the choice between different measures of health inequality could radically change the interpretation of the same underlying data. For example, absolute and relative health inequalities develop differently depending on the initial levels of health and the rate of health improvements (impairments) between different subgroups. Absolute health inequality refers to the magnitude of the difference in health between subgroups, while relative health inequality refers to the proportional difference in health between subgroups. Reporting only relative changes is a partial assessment of the progress in eliminating inequalities since it ignores the level of health. In order to ensure that a health improvement (or impairment) is improving health for all groups similarly, it is necessary to evaluate the relative change in combination with the absolute change in inequality ( Harper et al., 2010 ). Therefore, we also calculate the absolute concentration index (CI a ) using the following formula: (2) CI a = μ H CI r
The CI a is a summary statistic of the level of absolute health inequality. The magnitude of absolute inequality lies between a positive and a negative value of the mean diagnosis level and the sign is determined by a pro-rich (+) or a pro-poor (−) concentration of diagnoses, as with the CI r .
While the absolute and relative concentration indices provide useful summary statistics that are comparable over time, they do not necessarily give a complete picture of the distribution of the outcome by income in the population. To more comprehensively illustrate the (in)equality in the distribution of diagnoses we also produce concentration curves (relative) for the years 1994 and 2011. The relative concentration curve is a mapping of the cumulative share of diagnoses along the y-axis and the cumulative share of population ranked by (increasing) income along the x-axis. The further away from the line of equality (45° line) the concentration curves are situated, the greater is the inequality.
To investigate the associations between our selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and the probability of receiving a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis we use a (binary) Linear Probability Model for the years 1994 and 2011: (3) Y H = X ' β + ε where Y H represents psychiatric inpatient diagnosis, X is a vector of the potential explanatory variables, β is a vector of coefficients of the explanatory variables on diagnosis-status and ε is the error term. Under the following assumptions the coefficients in vector β can be interpreted as the associated impact a marginal increase in X would have on Y H : Assumption I The error term in equation (3) has zero conditional mean Assumption II The probability of diagnosis is additively linear in the covariates.
The same technique that is used to investigate the associations between the probability of receiving a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis and our selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics can be applied to study associations between the income-related inequality in psychiatric diagnosis and the potential contributing factors, with one difference. Instead of using psychiatric inpatient diagnosis as the outcome variable Y H in equation (3) , we use the Re-centred Influence Function (RIF) of each of the concentration indices. The RIF of the CI is a transformation of the CI that tells us how each individual influences the CI. Each individual thus has their own RIF value, and the average of these values is the CI itself. Because of this property, we can use standard regression techniques to estimate the marginal effects of the explanatory factors on the concentration indices ( Heckley et al., 2016 ). Under the following assumptions (in addition to the zero conditional mean assumption), we are able to identify which factors have the highest correlation with relative and absolute inequality in diagnosis: Assumption III The CI is a continuously differentiable function. Assumption IV The RIF of the CI is additively linear in covariates.
We use the OB decomposition method to investigate the contribution of each demographic and socioeconomic characteristic to the change in diagnosis probability and its inequality over time between calendar years 1994 and 2011 ( Blinder, 1973 ; Oaxaca, 1973 ). Let β ˆ 94 and β ˆ 11 respectively be the regression estimates from eq. (3) in 1994 and 2011. Under the assumption that X and ε are independent ( E ( ε | X ) = 0 ), we can express the changes in the probability of diagnosis and in the concentration indices of diagnosis inequality over time as:
(4)
Equation (4) breaks down the change in Y H into an explained part and an unexplained part ; the first and second parts of the right-hand side of eq. (4), respectively. The explained part, sometimes referred to as the composition effect, reflects how much of the change in diagnosis would be predicted from overall changes in the composition of the population, had the coefficients of the explanatory factors remained unchanged from their 1994 values. The unexplained part, sometimes referred to as the structural effect, reflects the contribution of the change in the coefficients of the explanatory factors, i.e. the changes in the association between the explanatory factors and psychiatric inpatient diagnosis. The explained component of the decomposition can be broken down further into a detailed decomposition describing the contribution of each explanatory factor, for example, how much of the change in diagnosis that is predicted by the change in the proportion of foreign-born in the population. The unexplained component can also be broken down further, providing information as to how much of the change in diagnosis is related to an unexplained increasing/decreasing concentration of diagnosis among those foreign-born.
In equation (3) , the regression coefficient β is a vector in which the first row is the constant term. The constant term has an important interpretation in OB decomposition analysis since it captures the changes in the unexplained part of the decomposition for the reference category. It is well known in OB decomposition analysis that the choice of the omitted group is very important and has an impact on the interpretation of the detailed unexplained decomposition ( Fortin et al., 2010 ). In our analysis, the explanatory variable education is categorised in three levels. We have chosen the middle level “10–12 years of schooling” as the reference category since this is believed to be the most stable education category over our sample period. Male sex, being born in Sweden and having parents born in Sweden are the reference categories for the other explanatory variables.

Section: 4. Results

In Fig. 1 , the change in the mean probability of psychiatric inpatient diagnosis (per 100,000) is plotted along the x-axis, the change in absolute inequality (per 100,000) is plotted along the y-axis, and the change in relative inequality is represented by how the scatter points locate relative to the dotted contour lines (themselves representing different levels of relative inequality). By construction, if relative inequality is zero, so is absolute inequality. If relative inequality increases or decreases so does absolute inequality. The probability of receiving a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis increased from 587.9 to 661.7 per 100,000, relative inequality increased from CI r −0.249 to CI r −0.369 and absolute inequality increased from CI a −146.3 to CI a −243.9 per 100,000.

This figure shows the probability of getting at least one psychiatric inpatient diagnosis plotted along the x-axis. Absolute inequality is plotted along the y-axis and is measured by the absolute concentration index CI a which lies between ±mean probability of diagnosis. Relative inequality is plotted along the dotted contour lines and is measured with the relative concentration index CI r which is bounded between ±1. Note that the values on the y-axis and the contour lines are negative which means that diagnoses are disproportionately concentrated among those with lower income. The sample consists of individuals aged 31–64 years living in Sweden in the years 1994 and 2011. Socioeconomic status is ranked by household disposable income in the previous calendar year.

The (relative) concentration curves for psychiatric inpatient diagnosis in the years 1994 and 2011 are plotted in Fig. 2 . These curves show that psychiatric inpatient diagnoses were disproportionately concentrated among those with lower socioeconomic rank (lower income) in both calendar years, and more so in 2011. Half of the psychiatric inpatients were concentrated among the poorest fifth of the population in 2011; an increase from less than a third of psychiatric inpatients in 1994.

This figure shows the concentration curves of relative income-related inequality in psychiatric inpatient diagnosis in years 1994 and 2011. The diagonal (45-degree line) represents no inequality. If the concentration curve is situated above (below) the diagonal, the health outcome is disproportionately concentrated among the poor (rich). The relative concentration index CI r equals two times the area between the diagonal and the concentration curve divided by the whole area above the diagonal.

The composition of the Swedish population has changed substantially over time, which may potentially explain the observed change in the probability of receiving a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis and its income-related health inequality between 1994 and 2011 (see Table 1 , columns 1 and 2). The proportion in the population with only mandatory schooling decreased from 29.9% to 14.1%, while the proportion with more than 12 years of schooling increased from 25.0% to 37.7% over this period. The share of the population with a foreign background also grew. The proportion of foreign-born individuals increased from 13.4% to 19.1%, and the proportion of individuals who had foreign-born parents increased from 1.1% to 2.7%. Since the study samples are cross-sections of the population (31–64 years) living in Sweden in the years 1994 and 2011, the population did not change regarding the sex ratio (49.3% female) and there was only a small increase in mean age, from 46.37 to 47.32 years over this period.

Includes individuals aged 31–64 years living in Sweden in years the 1994 and 2011. Socioeconomic status is ranked by equivalised household disposable income in the previous calendar year. Mean income changed from 112,500 SEK (sd 108,700) in 1994 to 198,900 SEK (sd 404,400) in 2011. Individuals with missing information on income are excluded (n = 439,973 in 1994 and n = 508,782 in 2011). We control for missing information on education and foreign background. Age is continuous in years, centred on 31 years. Secondary education (10–12 years of education) is reference group for education.

Our results show that being a woman, low educated and having foreign background are all associated with an increased risk of psychiatric inpatient diagnosis (see Table 1 , columns 3 and 4). Having foreign-born parents is a stronger risk factor than being foreign-born, but the most important risk factor is low education. On the contrary, higher education level and age (increasing) are associated with a decreased risk of psychiatric inpatient diagnosis. We also find that the strength of most of these associations increased over time, especially the association between low education and diagnosis, which more than doubled over the study period. The strength in the protective association of higher education also increased over time, while the association between age and probability of diagnosis decreased substantially.
The concentration indices are calculated based on the covariance between income and diagnosis; if one factor is associated with lower inequality, for example being foreign-born, it means that the covariance between income and diagnosis is lower in this group, compared to those born in Sweden. The opposite (higher covariance between income and diagnosis) is true for the factors that are associated with higher inequality.
Age, low education and having foreign-born parents are associated with higher relative and absolute inequality in diagnosis (negatively associated with the concentration indices CI r and CI a ) (see Table 1 , columns 5–8). Conversely, being foreign-born is associated with lower relative and absolute inequality (positively associated with the CI r and CI a ). Being a woman is associated with lower relative inequality but for absolute inequality the direction of the relationship changes; in 1994 female sex is associated with lower absolute inequality while in 2011 it is associated with higher absolute inequality. Higher education is associated with lower absolute inequality in both years and with higher relative inequality only in 1994.
The strength in several of these associations intensifies over time. Low education and having foreign-born parents are associated with higher inequalities in 2011 compared to 1994 and being foreign-born is associated with lower inequality over time. Conversely, the strength of the associations between age and higher relative and absolute inequality decreases over time, and the strength in the association between being a woman and lower relative inequality decreases over time.
To further our understanding of the changes over time in psychiatric inpatient diagnosis and the income-related inequalities, we decompose these changes into the contributions from each of our selected population characteristics . A key assumption in the interpretation of the OB decomposition results is that the predicted impact of the changing population characteristics is based on the associations of these characteristics remaining as they were in the year 1994.
The probability of getting a psychiatric inpatient diagnosis increased by 73.8 per 100,000 individuals between 1994 and 2011. The OB decomposition results (see Table 2 , columns 1 and 2) show that overall changes in population characteristics regarding education, foreign background, sex and age during this period predict −121.9% of the observed increase in the probability of diagnosis. Thus, the explained part of the OB decomposition predicts a decrease of 95.5 per 100,000 individuals. As we have mentioned earlier, the strength of the associations between diagnosis and several population characteristics changed between 1994 and 2011, which is reflected in the unexplained part of the decomposition. Changes in the associations of the population characteristics contributed to 221.9% of the observed increase in diagnosis, i.e. an increase in the probability of diagnosis by 163.8 per 100,000 individuals.

Since our focus is to examine how changes in education level and foreign background among the Swedish population may have impacted changes in diagnosis and diagnosis inequality, we turn to the detailed decomposition results which show how much of the change in diagnosis that can be predicted by changes in each specific characteristic. We find that changes in the distribution of the population by foreign background contribute to the increase in diagnosis. The increases in the proportions of foreign-born individuals and individuals with foreign-born parents predicts 10.8% and 9.9% of the observed increase in diagnosis, respectively. This means that if the impact of foreign background stayed as it was in 1994, considering only the changes in foreign background, this is how much the probability of diagnosis is predicted to change by year 2011.
The increase in education among the population over the study period instead predicts a substantial decrease in the probability of diagnosis. In 2011 there was a smaller proportion of low educated individuals (risk factor) and a larger proportion of higher educated individuals (protective factor) which predicts decreases in diagnosis in 2011 compared to 1994, whereas the diagnosis actually increased (the respective contributions are negative, −100.6% and −49.2% of the observed increase in probability of diagnosis).
Moreover, the strength in the associations with education increased over time. Psychiatric inpatient diagnosis became significantly more concentrated among those lowest educated, which contributed to 99.0% of the increase in probability of diagnosis, and significantly less concentrated among the high educated, which contributed to −22.9% of the observed increase in diagnosis.
Relative and absolute inequalities in diagnosis increased substantially over the study period, the CI r decreased by −0.120 and the CI a decreased by −97.6 per 100,000. The OB decomposition shows that overall changes in the population regarding education, foreign background, sex and age between 1994 and 2011 are not significantly associated with any of the increases in relative and absolute diagnosis inequality. In fact, changes in the population regarding these characteristics instead predict −5.9% and −38.8% of the observed increases in relative and absolute inequality (see Table 2 , columns 3 and 5). Thus, the explained part of the OB decomposition actually predicts decreases in both relative and absolute inequality. Overall changes in the associations between the concentration indices and the population characteristics (the unexplained part) contribute to 105.8% and 138.8% of the observed increases in relative and absolute inequality, respectively.
For the detailed decomposition results, we find that the changes in education level and proportion with a foreign background mostly predict decreases in diagnosis inequality. Increased schooling among the population is the most important contribution to decreased inequality; the decreasing proportion of low educated individuals predict −9.2% and −35.5% of the observed increases in relative and absolute inequality respectively, and while the increased proportion of high educated individuals predicts nothing of the change in relative inequality, it predicts −13.5% of the observed increase in absolute inequality. The impact of foreign background depends on how foreign background is defined. The growing proportion of foreign-born individuals predicts −6.7% and −2.4% of the observed increases in relative and absolute inequality. Conversely, the growing proportions of individuals with foreign-born parents predict smaller parts, 0.5% and 2.2%, of the increases in relative and absolute inequality that are observed, respectively.
Changes in the strength of the associations between the concentration indices and the population characteristics are related to larger increases in diagnosis inequality. The covariance between diagnosis and income increases among the lowest educated in such a way that it contributes to 10.8% and 48.0% of the increases in relative and absolute inequality, respectively. In the same way, the covariance between diagnosis and income increases among those with foreign-born parents, which contributes to 0.2% and 0.8% of the increases in relative and absolute inequality. Conversely, among those higher educated and foreign-born the covariance between diagnosis and income changes in such a way that it contributes to decreases in inequality. The changing association of having higher education is related to −8.0% and −19.5% of the observed increases in relative and absolute diagnosis inequality, respectively, and the association of being foreign-born is related to another −5.4% of the observed increase in relative inequality. As explained in the methods section, the choice of reference group is important for the interpretation of the unexplained part of the OB decomposition. Particularly for the unexplained contributions of a group defined by a categorical variable, since it is difficult to distinguish how much of the “contribution” is due to actual changes in the coefficient of that category compared to changes in the coefficient in the reference category ( Fortin et al., 2010 ). Our results show that the constant term is associated with substantial increases in relative and absolute inequality, which implies that the coefficients in the unexplained part of the decomposition likely are driven by changes in the reference group. Thus, the contributions of the unexplained part of the decomposition should be interpreted with caution.

Section: 5. Discussion

We find that approximately 0.6% of individuals aged 31–64 years in Sweden receive at least one psychiatric inpatient diagnosis each year. The probability of diagnosis increased somewhat between the years 1994–2011 when looking at this population group as a whole. Our results, however, show that the risk of getting a diagnosis differs significantly by income. Relative income-related inequalities in psychiatric inpatient diagnosis in Sweden are substantial, and more importantly, increasing over time. In year 1994, around one-third of psychiatric inpatients were found among the poorest fifth of the population. In 2011, more than half of the psychiatric inpatients were concentrated among this economically disadvantaged group . Absolute inequalities are also increasing. In fact, the increase in absolute inequality is even larger than the increase in probability of diagnosis which could reflect different scenarios: 1) that diagnosis increased along the whole income rank but relatively more among the poor, or 2) that diagnosis decreased among the rich and increased among the poor. Descriptive results showing how probability of diagnosis changes over time in different income quintiles imply that the latter is true (see supplementary materials figure A4 ). While the probability of diagnosis nearly doubled among the poorest fifth of the population, it decreased among all other income groups. Our findings show that the seemingly modest increase in probability of diagnosis conceals heterogenous trends among different groups in the population. These results highlight the importance of taking into account heterogeneous trends in the population, and also how different measures of inequality contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the development over time.
The decomposition results show that neither the observed increase in probability of diagnosis, nor the increasing inequalities, are substantially explained by changes in education level and the proportion with foreign background. During the study period, the proportion of individuals with only mandatory education halved and the share of individuals with more than 12 years of schooling doubled. Moreover, foreign background became more common; the share of foreign-born individuals increased by a half and the share with foreign-born parents doubled.
Whilst the overall decomposition did not substantially explain the changes, the detailed decomposition provided some interesting insights including that the increased proportions of foreign-born and individuals with foreign-born parents actually predict a small but meaningful part, 17.3%, of the observed increase in probability of diagnosis. Interestingly the impact on inequalities differs depending on how foreign background is defined; the growing proportion of individuals with foreign-born parents predicts smaller parts of the increasing relative and absolute inequalities in diagnosis, but the growing proportion of foreign-born individuals predicts a substantial decrease in relative inequality and a smaller decrease in absolute inequality. It is likely that the impact of foreign background on mental health and income is more complicated and depends on more factors than if oneself or one's parents are born outside of Sweden. The reason for immigration is one, region or country of origin is another. In 1994, around half of the foreign-born individuals in our sample were born outside of the EU-27 and Norway. In 2011, this proportion had increased to almost three-quarters. Since the associations between being foreign-born and diagnosis (probability and inequalities) intensifies over time, it is possible that the predicted changes related to being foreign-born are underestimated. We are unable to take such heterogeneity into account in this study, but future studies should try to disentangle these variations more thoroughly.
It is also interesting to note that the overall decreased probability of diagnosis and lower inequality that were predicted by a smaller proportion of low educated individuals are almost completely offset by the higher concentration of diagnoses, and a higher covariance between diagnosis and income, among those lowest educated. This means that while the population in general is becoming more educated and mentally healthier, a smaller group of the lowest educated are facing increased mental ill health, leading to larger relative and absolute inequalities in diagnosis.
Research from Canada has shown that while mental health problems such as depression and anxiety are more than twice as common among low income and low educated groups, use of mental health care services are more common among those with higher income and education ( Steele et al., 2007 ). This suggests that there could be an unmet need for mental health care also among low socioeconomic status groups in Sweden and that the income-related inequalities in mental health that we find, in fact, could be even larger. In this study, we use psychiatric inpatient diagnosis as an indicator of mental ill-health. It is likely that those who receive such a diagnosis suffer from mental ill-health, however, the probability of being diagnosed also reflects issues such as attitudes toward reporting poor mental health, stigmatisation, as well as behaviour and access regarding use of health care services. Such factors are likely also related to education and income. If, for example, low-income people seek health care at a later point when symptoms are already severe, they are perhaps more at risk of being hospitalized. Then, inequalities in mental health largely depend on how we identify mental ill-health, with inpatient or outpatient diagnoses, diagnoses in primary care , pharmaceuticals , self-reported health, etc. Future research should look further into this, that is how the identification of mental ill-health impacts the distribution of mental ill-health.
It is difficult to infer a causal interpretation from these results; while we find that schooling is related to better mental health in adult life it may also be that poorer mental health causes lower education level. While some of the characteristics we study are fixed – sex, age and foreign background – health selection related to schooling is likely reflected in our findings. Besides this endogeneity issue, another limitation is worth mentioning. The OB decomposition “explained part” is calculated based on a viewpoint from 1994. That is, given the associations of the explanatory factors in 1994, the change in those explanatory factors in the population predicts X much change in the probability of diagnosis or inequality in diagnoses between 1994 and 2011. This is actually only true for a marginal increase of the particular factor, and several of the associations change substantially over time, which this approach cannot explain. In sensitivity analyses, we have estimated the reverse and shifted the viewpoint to 2011 which resulted in similar interpretations and conclusions.

Section: 6. Conclusion

In this study, we show that mental health trends differ based on income among the adult population in Sweden. Mental health inequalities, as measured by the absolute and relative concentration indices between psychiatric inpatient diagnosis and income, are substantial and have increased over time between the years 1994 and 2011. Further, we show that while the increasing trend in inequalities coincide with large sociodemographic changes, such as increases in education level and migration, these population changes have not played a substantial role in determining the increasing inequalities. Education levels increased substantially over the study period which would be expected to protect against mental ill-health. Instead, we find that the health-promoting impact of higher education was almost completely offset by an increasing concentration of diagnoses among the lowest educated individuals. A small part of the increase in psychiatric diagnoses was explained by the growing proportion of individuals with foreign background in Sweden. Interestingly, the impact on diagnosis inequality varies depending on the definition of foreign background. The growing proportion of people with foreign-born parents contributed to a small part of the increase in inequality while the growing proportion of foreign-born individuals contributed to decreased inequality. These contributions were modest in size, but they are empirically important since they imply that the recent large inflow of migrants into Sweden may have increased psychiatric inpatient diagnoses and decreased its inequality, during the last decade. This prediction, however, contains a high level of uncertainty which we leave to be assessed by future research.
