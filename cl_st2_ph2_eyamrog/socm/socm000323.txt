Title: Effect of healthcare system reforms on public hospitals’ revenue structures: Evidence from Beijing, China


Abstract: Abstract

To reduce the heavy reliance of public hospitals on drug sales and use of advanced technologies and to contain the escalating medical expenditures, Beijing implemented two rounds of comprehensive public hospital reform in 2017 and 2019, respectively. The first round focused on separating drug sales from hospital revenue (reform1), and the second round extended to include zero markup on medical consumables and price adjustments for medical services (reform2). To estimate how these two rounds of reform have affected public hospitals' revenue structures, we used observational data of medical revenues from 2016 to 2019 covering 354 healthcare facilities. A Panel-interrupted time-series (PITS) model was used to analyze the effects. The results suggest that the reforms have changed the structure of public hospitals' revenues. The proportion of drug sales in hospital revenues fell from 43.96% in 2016 (pre-reform) to 34.08% in 2019 (post-reform); the proportions of medical consumables decreased by 0.73% after reform 2; and the proportion of medical consultation service fees increased from 15.16% in 2016 to 24.51% in 2019. PITS analysis showed that the proportion of drug sales dropped by 5.46% in the month of reform 1, and it dropped by 0.20% per month on average after reform 2(p < 0.001). The proportion of medical consumables decreased by 0.04% per month on average after reform 2 (p < 0.001). The proportion of medical consultation service increased by 7.13% in the month of reform 1, and it increased by 0.14% per month on average after reform 2(p < 0.001). Similar trends were seen in hospital revenue structures from both inpatient services and from outpatient and accident and emergency services. Thus, Beijing's reforms successfully contained rising medical expenditures and optimized hospitals' revenue structures. These reforms can provide a reference for further public hospital reforms in China and other countries with similar systems.

Section: 1. Introduction

Escalating medical expenditures pose major challenges for healthcare systems worldwide ( Yip et al., 2012 ). In China, total health expenditures accounted for 6.58% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019, up from 5.03% in 2009 ( National Health Commission of China, 2019 ), equating to an average annual growth rate of 12.2%, which is higher than the annual GDP growth rate of 8.1% ( Yip et al., 2019 ). This steep growth of medical expenditures is associated with many factors, such as population aging , changes in the disease spectrum, rapid increase in health care utilization , and advancements in medical technology . Evidence suggests that the compensation mechanism in public hospitals has also contributed to this growth ( Chen et al., 2014 ). Considering these issues, many countries have implemented various policies, including price control and provider payment reform, to contain rising medical expenditures ( Figueras et al., 2005 ; Pauly and Town, 2012 ).
The issue of increasing medical expenditures in China is especially complex because of the public hospital financing mechanism resulting from the history of China's health systems . In the 1950s, under the planned economy, public hospital infrastructure, medical equipment , and staff salaries were fully subsidized by the Chinese government, and healthcare prices were also set by the government, which implemented a low-price policy. Without sufficient government investment and the underlying cost structure, healthcare facilities could not make ends meet, causing them to increasingly rely on profits from markups on drugs and medical consumables ( Xu et al., 2019 ). In response, the government introduced drug and consumable markup policies, comprising a special tax on the users of healthcare services, which allowed public hospitals to compensate for their loss through the provision of services priced artificially low ( Yi et al., 2015 ). This policy helped supplement hospital financing to some extent and support the normal operation of healthcare facilities. From the 1950s to the mid-to-late 1980s, the government strictly managed the revenues of public hospitals and their distribution; hospitals did not have the freedom to redistribute surplus. The policy was smoothly implemented. In the late 1980s, healthcare in China started to transition towards a more market-oriented system. Although the government budget for healthcare services was increasing, its share in total health expenditure declined ( Blumenthal and Hsiao, 2015 ). Public hospitals were given greater management autonomy . Government supervision of the healthcare system was reduced as well. Public hospitals increasingly relied on profits from high-volume drug sales and revenue from the healthcare services that they provided. The total revenue from drug sales in China was estimated to be ¥176 billion in 2016, accounting for 36.32% of total medical revenues ( Li et al., 2018 ). The revenues were associated with doctors' income ( Yip et al., 2010 ), which means hospitals may have strong incentives to realize profit by increasing treatment doses and frequency, especially for drugs and services with higher profit margins ( Liu et al., 2019 ; McGuire and Pauly, 1991 ). Combined with the undermining of doctors' professional value—which led to low fees for professional services—it became common for healthcare facilities to rely heavily on drug sales to ensure that doctors were not underpaid. This distorted the health financing mechanism, incentivized over-prescription, and caused excess use of consumables ( Xu et al., 2019 ), leading to a fragmented, hospital-centric healthcare system in China with high costs and low efficiency ( Ding et al., 2016 ; Quan et al., 2017 ; Yip, 1998 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ) and the social problem of expensive and inaccessible medical services for patients. Therefore, reform in the public hospital financing mechanism is pressing and considered an important lever for modifying public hospital service provision toward public interests and guiding distribution of medical resources.
Since 2009, the government has introduced new rounds of healthcare system reforms, with public hospital reform being one of several key areas of reform ( Meng et al., 2019 ). The reforms have included separating drug sales from hospital revenues and establishing mechanisms to compensate for public hospitals' financial losses ( Xiao et al., 2015 ). Before the reforms, charges were low for most basic medical services (e.g., surgery, diagnosis, therapy, nursing) but very expensive for services involving advanced technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There was a higher proportion of drug sales and consumable use in total hospital revenues while services reflecting healthcare workers’ professional value only accounted for a small fraction.
The reforms in China's healthcare system over the last 10 years suggest that the sequence of reform is vital ( Meng et al., 2019 ). Investing too much in the healthcare system before the reform of the system itself could lead to inefficiencies. In a large country like China, it is difficult to find a universal model for healthcare reform. Local pilot reforms could inform national policy formulation and implementation. Therefore, based on the lessons learnt from the past 10 years' health reform, the government has done substantial preparatory work before the implementation of a new round of health reforms, such as information systems upgrades, technical staff training, medical insurance revisions (e.g., cancelation of drugs and consumables bonuses).
The challenges of increasing medical expenditure, hospitals’ reliance on drug and consumable sales have not been adequately dealt with; nor has the profit driven behavior of the public hospitals been thoroughly reversed; and the utilization of primary medical services was still insufficient ( Liu et al., 2019 ). In this context, the healthcare reform was initiated in Beijing and is referred to as the “Beijing Comprehensive Health Care Reform.” It was introduced in two rounds. In April 2017, the first round of public hospital reform was implemented, including policies such as removing drug markups, registration fees, and consultation fees; introducing a medical consultation service fee to transform the compensation mechanism; implementing classified drug procurement on a government platform based on the cheapest available price to lower drug costs and curb other healthcare expenditure as well; and adjusting medical service pricing (e.g., decreasing prices for CT and MRI while increasing prices for surgery and traditional Chinese medicine , which reflect professional value and require experience, skill, and labor) ( Liu et al., 2019 ; Meng et al., 2019 ). After this round of reform, public hospitals saw an increasing trend in the use of medical consumables and other expenditures. The cost of consumables became a driving factor in the growth of medical expenditures in tertiary hospitals. In light of this, the Beijing government initiated the second round of reform in June 2019, intending to remove markups and adjust the pricing of medical service items. The pricing of 6621 medical service items was standardized; on top of zero markups for drugs, the 10% markup for consumables below ¥500 and 5% markup for consumables above ¥500 were removed. From the perspective of policy makers, the purpose of these reforms were to reduce the heavy reliance of medical institutions on drug and consumables sales, improve the enthusiasm of medical staff, and contain escalating medical expenditure.
In this paper, the two above-mentioned rounds of reform in 2017 and 2019 are collectively referred to as the “Beijing Comprehensive Healthcare Reform.” The reform aimed to optimize the hospital revenue structure without placing more financial burden on patients and contribute to a healthcare system that functions appropriately, efficiently, affordably, and sustainably ( Liu et al., 2018 ). The Beijing reform can potentially provide a direction for public hospital reform in China. We used observational data related to the Beijing Comprehensive Healthcare Reform from January 2016 (one year before the 2017 reform) to December 2019 (half a year after the 2019 reform) to investigate how medical expenditure and hospital revenue structure changed and how well the value of medical professionals’ work was reflected in hospital revenue.

Section: 2. Methods

First, we conducted a quantitative analysis of medical revenue data (before and after the healthcare reform in Beijing). Since changes in the medical revenue structure may directly reflect the effect of the reform, we analyzed changes in the proportion of five types of revenue in the total revenue: drug sales, consumable sales, laboratory tests , medical examinations, and medical services. The proportion of medical services in the total revenue could reflect the labor value of medical professionals ( Zhao and Ma, 2009 ). It included services provided by healthcare professionals in hospitals, such as surgery, treatment, nursing, and consultation, and was calculated by subtracting drug sales, consumable sales, laboratory tests, and medical examinations from total hospital revenues. We also calculated the average per-visit expenditure for outpatients and inpatients to evaluate whether the reform kept payments at the same level as before.
Data were from the Beijing Municipal Health Commission observational database. To fully understand and periodically update the implementation of the reform, the Beijing Municipal Health Commission established a monitoring system containing monthly observational data. It includes a total of 354 healthcare facilities, including 79 tertiary hospitals, 71 secondary hospitals, and 204 primary healthcare facilities. These cover 90% of secondary and tertiary public hospitals and 10% of primary healthcare facilities in Beijing, accounting for more than 70% of medical revenues and healthcare services in the city. Data were collected through a standard interface system and online reporting via the Beijing Health Comprehensive Statistics Information Platform. System logic verification, key quality control index calculation, and year-to-year comparison were used to identify and manage missing or incorrect data in a timely manner to ensure high data quality.
Since the data between years might not be comparable, we described the data according to the time period: pre-reform (January 2016 to March 2017), post-reform 1 (i.e., separating drug sales from hospital revenue; April 2017 to June 2019), and post-reform 2 (i.e., adjusting the prices of consumables and services; July 2019 to December 2019).
Panel-interrupted time-series (PITS) design for the three time periods was employed as the quantitative analytic method, which is based on segmented regression models with institutional fixed effect (Equation (1) , and the monthly observational data for each hospital from January 2016 to December 2019 was adopted to estimate the effect of reform 1 and reform 2 on changes in medical revenue. We used Fourier terms (pairs of sine and cosine functions) to control for the seasonal effect and other long-term trends, and Huber-White SEs clustered at institution-level throughout were included to control for serial correlation in the institution level ( Zhu et al., 2019 ). Additionally, all expenditure data was adjusted by the consumer price index (CPI) so that medical expenditures reflect the CNY values comparatively during 2016 and 2019. (1) Y i t = β 0 + β 1 * t i m e t + β 2 * r e f o r m 1 + β 3 * r e f o r m 1 * t i m e t + β 4 * r e f o r m 2 + β 5 * r e f o r m 2 * t i m e t + α X i t + μ i + ε i t where Y i t denotes the outcome variables in institution (i) and month (t); t i m e t is a continuous variable that refers to time from the start of the observation; r e f o r m 1 and r e f o r m 2 indicate the two interventions, with a value of 0 denoting pre-intervention and 1 denoting post-intervention. β 0 is the estimated value of the baseline level of the indicator; β 1 is the estimated value of the baseline trend; β 2 and β 4 are the estimated values of changes in the indicator due to the two reforms (i.e., the estimated value of instantaneous changes in medical revenue before and after the intervention), which represents the change level of observational indicator in the month of reform; β 3 and β 5 are the estimated values of trend changes in the indicator due to the two reforms (i.e., the estimated value of the difference between the slope of the medical revenue change after the intervention and the slope of the medical revenue before the intervention), which represents the change level of observational indicator per month on average; X i t are control variables, namely number of health technicians, hospital beds, and equipment costing more than ¥10,000 ; μ i are an institution's individual fixed effects, which control for mean differences across institution; ε i t refers to the error term.
We did not include data from January 2020 since medical revenues were heavily affected by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, and the inpatient service volume of tertiary and secondary hospitals in Beijing decreased by 49.2% and 38.9%, respectively ( Lu et al., 2020a , b ). This would not accurately reflect hospitals’ revenue structures.

Section: 3. Results

After reform 1 (separating drug sales from hospital revenue) and reform 2 (adjusting the prices of consumables and services), the proportion of drug sales in total hospital revenues decreased. After reform 1, the proportion was 35.47%, which was 8.49 percentage points lower than that before the reform. The proportion of medical consultation service fees increased greatly, accounting for 22.25% of hospital revenue—an increase of 7.09 percentage points compared with before the reform. The proportion of medical consultation service fees in the total revenues from outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) services increased by 8.26 percentage points, higher than the proportion for inpatient services at 5.56%. After reform 2, the proportion of consumables was 18.76%, which was 0.73 percentage points lower than that before the reform, and the proportion of inpatient consumables dropped by 1.95 percentage points, which was higher than the proportion for outpatients and A&E (−0.31 percentage points) ( Table 1 ).

The pre-reform average total expenditure per visit and the average total expenditures per hospitalization were ¥427.49 and ¥19,038.12, respectively. After both rounds of reform, both total expenditures per visit and per hospitalization increased. After reform 1 (separating drug sales from hospital revenue), the corresponding total expenditure per visit/hospitalization were ¥453.69 and ¥19,892.51, respectively—increases of 6.13% and 4.49%, respectively, compared with pre-reform ( Table 2 ). After reform 2 (adjusting the prices of consumables and services), the average total expenditure per visit/hospitalization were ¥445.31 and ¥20,307.72, respectively—a decrease of 1.85% in total expenditure per visit and an increase of 2.09% in total expenditure per hospitalization, compared with those after reform 1 ( Table 2 ).

In terms of total revenue structure ( Fig. 1 ), in the month of reform 1, the proportion of drug sales dropped by 5.46%, that of medical examinations dropped by 0.56%, that of medical consumables decreased by 0.49%, and that of medical consultation service fees increased by 7.13%. All of these changes were statistically significant (p < 0.001). On average, the proportion of medical consumables decreased by 0.04% per month with statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). In the month of reform 2, the proportion of medical consumables decreased by 0.20% and that of laboratory tests decreased by 0.27% (p < 0.05). On average, the proportion of drug sales dropped by 0.20% per month, that of medical consumable dropped by 0.04% per month, and that of medical consultation service fees increased by 0.14% per month.

As shown in Tables S2 and S5 , the absolute amount of the revenue is rising after the two-round reforms, but the increase rate is modest. Analysis of average expenditure per visit is shown in Fig. 4 . As can be seen from Table 6 , in the first month of implementing reform 1, the average expenditure per visit among all healthcare facilities in Beijing slightly increased; after that, this expenditure dropped significantly by 0.30% per month on average (p < 0.001). In the first month of implementing reform 2, the average expenditure per visit among all healthcare facilities in Beijing decreased by 4.30% which was statistically significant (p < 0.001); after that, this expenditure dropped by 0.30% per month on average; the change was significant (p < 0.05).

In terms of average expenditure per hospitalization ( Fig. 4 ), in the first month of implementing reform 1, the average expenditure per hospitalization in Beijing slightly increased; the change was not significant (p > 0.001). After that, this expenditure was basically unchanged compared with the pre-reform period. In the first month of implementing reform 2, the average expenditure per hospitalization in Beijing decreased by 3.63%, with statistical significance (p < 0.05); after that, the average expenditure per hospitalization decreased by 0.07% per month, but this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) ( Table 7 ).

We also conducted analyses for different levels of healthcare facilities separately (i.e., tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals, and primary care facilities). Results of the analyses were consistent (shown in Supplementary Material), and it showed a more significant change on tertiary hospitals’ revenue structure.

Section: 4. Discussion

The Beijing Comprehensive Healthcare Reform was designed to optimize the hospital revenue structure without placing more financial burden on patients ( Liu et al., 2019 ). Two rounds of reform were conducted, with the 2017 reform focusing on separating drug sales form hospital revenues and the 2019 reform focusing on price adjustment of consumables and services. In this study, both descriptive analysis and PITS analysis were applied to evaluate the effect of the healthcare reform on hospital revenue structure. The results suggest that the structure of public hospitals' revenues has been changed. It was shown in the descriptive analysis that the proportion of drug sales in hospital revenues fell from 43.96% in 2016 (pre-reform) to 34.08% in 2019 (post-reform), suggesting an early sign of reversing the trend of significant contribution of drug sales to total hospital revenues; the proportion of medical consultation fees had increased from 15.16% to 24.51%, indicating that the value of professionals’ work has been increasingly reflected; and the proportions of medical consumables decreased after reform 2, implying the positive effect of the price adjustment policy. Consistent with the descriptive analysis results, PITS analysis showed that the proportion of drug sales in hospital revenues dropped by 5.46% in the month of reform 1, and it dropped by 0.20% per month on average after reform 2(p < 0.001). The proportion of medical consumables in hospital revenues decreased by 0.04% per month on average after reform 2 (p < 0.001). At the same time, the proportion of medical consultation service in hospital revenues increased by 7.13% in the month of reform 1, and it increased by 0.14% per month on average after reform 2(p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed in hospital revenue structures from both inpatient services and outpatient and A&E services. Our findings could support the conclusion that the reform is progressing as intended.
Our study provides the evidence of the positive effects of two-round Beijing healthcare reforms on the control of the increase rate of the hospital revenues and the possible influence on the tiered medical services. The absolute amount of the hospital revenue is rising after the two-round reforms, but the increase rate is modest. Our PITS analysis indicated that the average change per month of the overall average expenditure per visit had slightly decreased after reform1, which dropped again after reform 2. Whereas, the average change per month of the overall average expenditure per hospitalization was not significant. The two-round reforms have shown a positive effect on the total expenditure control. The possible reason might be its successful effects on the control of the increase of the inpatient expenditure and on the control of the number of the outpatient/A&E visit, which was probably contributed by the tiered medical consultation service fee, the improved availability of medicines at primary healthcare facilities and the downward adjustment of the prices. On the one hand, the establishment of a tiered medical consultation service fee in Beijing made higher level hospitals and senior physicians can charge higher service fees. Patients' co-payments on medical consultation service fees at primary healthcare facilities (¥1 for an outpatient visit) are less than those at tertiary hospitals (¥ 10 for an outpatient visit), which redirected the flow of outpatients from tertiary hospitals to primary healthcare facilities to a certain extent; On the other hand, the reform improved the availability of medicines at primary healthcare facilities and extended the length of prescriptions for patients with non-communicable diseases from one month to 2 months at primary healthcare facilities, which also encouraged the use of primary care services. Because the average outpatient cost per visit of primary healthcare facilities is lower than that of tertiary hospitals, the relative decrease of outpatient visits in tertiary hospitals indirectly reached the effect of total cost control. And the reform's impact on inpatient cost control may directly come from the downward adjustment of the prices of drugs, examinations, and laboratory tests.
Our study has indicated that there was a more significant influence on tertiary hospitals’ revenue structure. More discussion about the reforms effects on orienting the patients from higher tiered hospital to lower ones were not included in this study. Whereas another study stated that the number of outpatient and emergency services in tertiary hospitals has decreased by 5.43% compared with that before the reform1 and increased by 3.81% compared with that before the reform2; while the primary facilities increased by 39.91% and 7.70% compared with that before the reform1 and reform2 respectively ( Wang et al., 2020 ), implying that the two reforms have promoted diverting the outpatient and emergency treatment patients in different hospitals. Additionally, our results showed that the spill-over effects of the 1st reform on consumables seem stronger than the intended effects of the 2nd reform, the interesting phenomenon was also found by another study ( Lu et al., 2020a , b ). To an extent, it may truly reflect the indirect effect on consumables that resulting from the success of orienting patients from tertiary hospital toward primary facilities after the 1st reform, which was slightly higher than the influence of merely abolishing the markup of medical consumables; another possible reason is that the research data included in the analysis was only six months after the 2nd reform, some policy effects have not been fully released during the relatively short observation period, and it may also because of the less robustness of regression equation, but it needs further exploration.
Compared with healthcare reforms in other Chinese provinces and cities, the price adjustment in the Beijing Comprehensive Healthcare Reform seems to have been more successful, which might explain the positive results observed here. In Chongqing's (another metropolitan city of China) healthcare reform ( Gong, 2016 ), there was excessive price adjustment of healthcare services. The reform included 7886 healthcare services covering six major categories. Among the 7886 service items, the prices of 1309 were reduced, and the prices of 6577 were increased. Within only six days of implementation, the reform triggered protests by hundreds of patients with kidney failure undergoing dialysis. Before the reform, the out-of-pocket payment for a dialysis session was ¥95; after the reform, it was ¥200. The costs of medications for dialysis and complications increased by more than 100%. This means that with 10 dialysis sessions, two filtration sessions, and one perfusion session per month, the cost would be at least ¥3500. Moreover, the reform in Chongqing was not well coordinated with the health insurance system, leading to a lack of communications with the general public, and lack of estimation of changes in the cost structure of hospitals and prices the patients faced. These resulted in high out-of-pocket payments and consequently the failure of that reform.
In other regional healthcare reforms, there were inadequate price adjustments, which also led to unsuccessful outcomes. For example, the prices of certain services in Jiangsu's (an economically well-developed province of China) healthcare reform did not fully reflect the value of professional services ( Yan, 2019 ). The medical consultation service fee was a tiered charge based on hospital level and doctor seniority ( Liu et al., 2019 ), and it was a direct measure of the value of healthcare professionals' labor. The actual costs of professionals' time and energy investment were much higher than the charges reflect. Although Jiangsu adjusted medical consultation fees, they were still far below their actual value. One study analyzing Jiangsu's public hospital reform ( Wu et al., 2018 ) concluded that there were problems such as insufficient price adjustment (i.e., prices of some services should be increased) and suboptimal implementation of policy. However, due to the unavailability of detailed reform data in Jiangsu, it was not possible for us to use similar outcome measures to compare the results between regions. In Beijing and Shanghai, meanwhile, medical consultation fees are much higher than in Jiangsu, and the same fees apply to both outpatient and A&E services ( Table S1 in Supplementary Material). This might explain why the effect was more significant than in Jiangsu.
This study could provide some insights on the healthcare system reforms at the national level or regional level. First, a dynamic price-adjustment mechanism for healthcare services should be established. Separating drug sales from hospital revenues adjusted the prices of 435 items while adjusting the pricing of consumables and services affected more than 6000 items, with 1000 more pending. Adjusting the prices of a large number of services at once requires a huge amount of work. Thus, we recommend that in the later stages of healthcare reform, a dynamic price-adjustment mechanism for healthcare services should be established based on feedback from facilities and related calculations. This could help gradually achieve the goal of restructuring hospital revenues. Second, service delivery behavior changes should be further monitored, and evaluations of service quality should be emphasized. After the reform that adjusted the prices of consumables and services, there were substantial changes in the prices of services, as well as great changes in the service delivery behavior of professionals (e.g., a significant escalating trend in revenues from outpatient and A&E services and an increasing number of patient visits). These could indicate changes in people's demand for healthcare services. Thus, there is a need to strengthen monitoring and evaluation, especially with regard to the quality of medical services. Third, hospital expenditures are opportunity costs for critical services such as public health and primary health care. Without containing expenditures from the hospital sector, it is challenging to generate the fiscal space for healthcare system development ( Xu et al., 2020 ). A diagnostic related group (DRG)-based payment method should be promoted ( Xu et al., 2019 ). Using price adjustments to change hospital revenue structures is heavily affected by socioeconomic levels. The effect on professionals' behaviors may be gradually attenuated. In the operation and management of public hospitals, DRGs would not only standardize professionals' behavior by providing references but also incentivize hospitals to change management modes, optimize disease spectrum and resource allocation , and reverse inappropriate behaviors by developing standard clinical pathways .
This study has some limitations. First, the PITS analysis method can determine whether the level and trend of the outcome variables change after the intervention by setting the intervention time. However, it cannot estimate the effect of other policies implemented during the study period if the time points of intervention were not correspondingly set in the analysis; and PITS analysis was not able to determine whether there is a clear causal relationship between reform implementation and changes in revenue structure due to the presence of other explanatory variables, which can directly or indirectly affect the outcome variables. Additionally, it was only possible to analyze short-term effects after reform 2 (adjusting the prices of consumables and services) due to COVID-19. Although healthcare facilities have been able to complete the change in the pricing system, it may take some time for them to adapt to the new operation mode. For example, the strategic responses of healthcare facilities to price adjustments may pose a challenge to the revenue structure change. Therefore, further monitoring and evaluation are needed to continuously evaluate the long-term effects ( Meng et al., 2019 ). This would enable timely policy adjustment to ensure that the long-term behavioral adjustments in healthcare facilities are consistent with policy goals. Second, our dataset covered 90% of secondary and tertiary public hospitals in Beijing, which suggests very good representativeness. However, some primary healthcare facilities were excluded due to low-level information systems and poor data quality. The primary healthcare facilities data may not be fully representative of all primary healthcare facilities because only those with good data quality were used and these may be the better facilities. Therefore, we should be cautious about generalizing this study's results to all healthcare facilities and especially to primary healthcare facilities in Beijing.

Section: 5. Conclusion

China initiated healthcare system reforms in 2009 aiming to improve the quality and efficiency of services. Beijing, the capital city of China, implemented a series of policies in 2017 and 2019 in order to contain escalating medical expenditures, reduce the proportion of revenues from drug and consumable sales, more properly reflect professional value, and build a sustainable healthcare system. Our analysis showed that Beijing's reforms successfully contained rising medical expenditures and reshaped hospitals' revenue structures by reducing the proportion of drug and consumable sales and increasing the proportion of medical consultation fees in total hospital revenues. The reform has been effectively implemented and is progressing as intended. Therefore, the experiences gained from the Beijing reform can inform further public hospital reforms in China and in other countries with similar systems.
