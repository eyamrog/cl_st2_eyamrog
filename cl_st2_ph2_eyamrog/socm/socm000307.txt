Title: Green space and suicide mortality in Japan: An ecological study


Abstract: Abstract

Although numerous studies have investigated the effect of green space on mental health, as yet, little is known about the association between green space and suicide. To address this deficit, we conducted the first Japan-wide study of the relationship between green space and suicide mortality. Results from spatial analyses of municipality-level panel data for the 1975–2014 period that included 886,440 suicide deaths with a fixed-effect estimator showed that green space was associated with suicide mortality, and that this relationship was conditioned by the form of greenness, level of urbanity and demographic characteristics. In densely populated cities, park density (parks per 1000 of the population) was associated with reduced suicide mortality among females aged 18 and above and among males aged 18 to 39 and aged 65 and above. In small- and medium-sized cities, park coverage (% by area) was linked to fewer suicide deaths among middle-aged and older females (aged 40 and above). In contrast, in non-cities (rural areas), parks were not associated with suicide mortality whereas woodland coverage (% by area) was linked to reduced suicide deaths among middle-aged and older males (aged 40 and above). Our findings suggest that urban green space and rural forest coverage may have a protective effect against self-harming behavior. Future suicide prevention efforts should consider an increased greening of the residential environment in terms of both availability and accessibility, especially with better designs that accommodate population needs and local conditions.

Section: 1. Introduction

One of the consequences of urbanization may be reduced access to natural green space such as grassland and forests ( Richards and Belcher, 2020 ). This might have significant implications for physical wellbeing given the association revealed between greenery and health in earlier research. Studies have linked the perception and availability of a green environment to lower overweight/obesity ( Coombes et al., 2010 ), stroke, neonatal mortality ( Hu et al., 2008 ; Kihal-Talantikite et al., 2013 ), and a healthier sleep duration ( Astell-Burt et al., 2013 ) possibly as a result of greater physical activity ( de Vries et al., 2013 ) and enhanced social interactions ( Lachowycz and Jones, 2013 ). An earlier study also showed that walkable green streets and spaces near an individual's residence were positively associated with the longevity of senior citizens in Tokyo—a densely populated and developed megacity in Japan ( Takano et al., 2002 ). These associations are not due to confounding by genetic and socioeconomic variation ( Cohen-Cline et al., 2015 ; Triguero-Mas et al., 2015 ), and the benefits of greenness may be sustainable over the life course ( Alcock et al., 2014 ).
There is also an increasing focus on the role of green space in mental health ( Barton and Rogerson, 2017 ), with cross-sectional ( Van den Berg et al., 2016 ) and longitudinal research ( Alcock et al., 2014 ) indicating that exposure to greenness may be associated with better mental health. A review study found that there was an intermediate strength of evidence for the greenness-improved mental health association ( Fong et al., 2018 ), a finding that is seemingly supported by the results of a more recent scoping review, which reported that there was a positive association between green space and mental health and wellbeing in around 70% of 263 reviewed studies, with another 25% producing ‘mixed’ support for study hypotheses ( Wendelboe-Nelson et al., 2019 ). It is uncertain what underlies these sometimes mixed findings. They might stem, for example, from wide-ranging methodological differences across studies ( Wendelboe-Nelson et al., 2019 ). Alternatively, these variations may be indicative of the potential complexity of the association. Previous research has shown for instance, that the association between green space and mental health can vary across the life course ( Astell-Burt et al., 2014 ). Various mechanisms may link exposure to green space and better mental health including its facilitation of increased physical activity and psychologically restorative capacity ( Markevych et al., 2017 ).
As yet, however, there is comparatively little evidence about whether green space is also linked to suicide, and those studies that have been undertaken have produced inconsistent results. An ecological, cross-sectional study that examined the association between green space coverage and suicide in the 50 largest cities in England in 2002–2009 found that there was no difference in suicide mortality between the greenest and least green cities ( Bixby et al., 2015 ). Another ecological study from England that used green space data for 32,482 lower layer super output areas from 2001 and deaths from intentional self-harm in 2001–2005 found that differences in green space exposure were not associated with suicide in individuals younger than retirement age ( Mitchell and Popham, 2008 ). In contrast, two more recent studies found that green space may be associated with fewer suicides. Specifically, while undertaking a cross-sectional, ecological study that used aggregated suicide deaths in 2005–14 and the Geographic Information System (GIS) measurement of greenery in 2007 in 398 Dutch municipalities with a spatially explicit Bayesian model, Helbich et al., (2018) found that the municipalities with a higher proportion of green space, including agricultural land , forests and parks, had significantly lower suicide mortality. While using individual-level data from the 2009 Korean Community Health Survey (n = 169,029), Min et al. (2017) found that respondents living in areas with the lowest amount of greenery (parks and general green areas) had higher odds for both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
Other studies have indicated that the green space-suicide mortality association is also sensitive to the selection of analytical covariates and the way green space is measured. For example, a Taiwanese study showed that patch area had a negative association but fragmentation and patch distance had a positive association with the suicide rate in the Taipei Metropolitan Area in 2010 ( Shen and Lung, 2018 ). Helbich et al. (2020) used longitudinal normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) data for 1997 to 2016 and data on 9757 individual-level suicide deaths in 2007–2016, and found that an initial negative association was fully attenuated when adjusting for factors such as urbanicity and social disadvantage, although for females NDVI concentric exposure areas (buffers) of 300 m with high levels of greenery were associated with a differing suicide risk depending on whether they were in highly urbanized (increased suicide risk) or rural (reduced suicide risk) areas.
While it is uncertain whether these differing results are due to the different social and national contexts or different units of analysis (area/individual) with individual-level data presumably less prone to confoundedness, further research on the relationship between greenness and suicide mortality is warranted for several reasons. First, the association between greenness and suicide may tie in with various theories of suicide. For example, Durkheim's assertion that social integration is important for suicide ( Durkheim, 1951 ), may be relevant in this context given that it has been suggested that green space may facilitate increased social cohesion ( Markevych et al., 2017 ). Second, green space might also be linked with suicide in a conditioned way, given the potential heterogeneity of mental and physical responses towards greenness in the population ( Richardson and Mitchell, 2010 ) and the fact that the statistical analysis may be sensitive to covariate selection ( Chang and Gunnell, 2018 ; Helbich et al., 2020 ). For example, older age may be associated with a higher reliance on public green space for social engagement ( Pleson et al., 2014 ; Tinsley et al., 2002 ) as well as a higher suicide risk ( Waern et al., 2002 , 2003 ). Despite this, most previous research has not examined the association in age-specific subgroups. Instead, the age of the population has either been used as a control variable ( Min et al., 2017 ; Mitchell and Popham, 2008 ; Shen and Lung, 2018 ), or the analysis has been age-adjusted ( Bixby et al., 2015 ; Helbich et al., 2018 ). Third, while the benefits of green space might be manifest over a longer time period, with the exception of Helbich et al.'s study (2020) that included 10 years of suicide observations and double that for greenness, existing research has relied exclusively on cross-sectional data where green space and associated covariates typically comprised one-off measurements, giving rise to the possibility of omitted variable bias from potentially idiosyncratic observations. Accordingly, the addition or subtraction of relevant covariates, such as the unemployment rate and urbanization that were measured at a single time point can significantly affect the magnitude of the estimation, resulting in misleading inferences ( Chang and Gunnell, 2018 ; Helbich et al., 2020 ).
The current study investigates the association between green space and suicide mortality in Japan using panel data for the 1975–2014 period. Japan may be an apt study setting for two reasons. First, suicide has been a public health problem in Japan in recent decades with the suicide rate remaining high today in comparative terms ( World Health Organization, 2018 ). Although there has been extensive research on possible factors linked to high suicide mortality in Japan, to the best of our knowledge, as yet, there has been no research on the potential effects of green space. Second, while previous studies used suicide data for a maximum period of 10 years, we are able to draw on suicide data stretching back to 1975, i.e. , over 880,000 suicide deaths that provide multiple decades of variation in both time and space. Together with green space data that have been updated decennially since 1980, this unique longitudinal Japanese dataset allows us to use a fixed-effect estimator that better deals with omitted variable biases ( Halaby, 2004 ) by relying on only within-unit variations in green space and suicide over time.

Section: 2. Methods

This ecological study used data from Japanese municipalities, i.e. , the cities, towns, villages and 23 special wards of Tokyo (semi-autonomous subdivisions within Tokyo that are comparable to other forms of municipalities) within the 47 Japanese prefectures. As there are large variations in demographic and economic features across municipalities, and given that the type of greenness associated with mental health responses may depend on a locality's degree of urbanization in Japan ( Nishigaki et al., 2020 ), we classified the municipalities into designated large cities ( N = 43), small- and medium-size cities ( N = 790), and rural non-cities ( N = 908) according to the official urban-rural division as of 2015 published by Official Statistics of Japan (total N = 1741). While there are several approaches to determine the degree of urbanization of a given municipality in Japan, to the best of our knowledge, Official Statistics of Japan uses the most systematic classification that takes three factors into consideration holistically: (1) population size ; (2) the population living in densely inhabited districts (DIDs); and (3) the industrial structure. Specifically, the 20 designated large cities plus the 23 special wards of Tokyo are the most populous and industrialized municipalities/areas of Japan, which are normally the central city of a region, each accommodating over 500,000 residents. Overall, they included around 21% of the Japanese population in 2015. The 790 small- and medium-size cities include populations between 50,000 and 500,000, with over 60% of them dwelling in DIDs and working in secondary and tertiary industries. They included approximately 63% of the national population in 2015. The remaining 908 municipalities with the remaining 16% of the national population were classified as rural non-cities, where residents are more scattered, fewer in number and working mainly in primary industries.
In light of the frequent municipal mergers that have occurred in recent decades in Japan, we developed a panel dataset from 1975 to 2014 based on all the municipalities that existed during this time period ( e.g. , 3387 municipalities in 1975), and mapped them to the 1741 municipalities that officially existed in 2015 ( Kondo, 2019 ). As we lost track of 11 (0.16%) municipality-years ( i.e. , observational units in the panel data) in the mapping process, 12 (0.17%) for the fiscal strength data, and another 45 (0.65%) for a balanced panel for spatial statistical analysis, the total number of valid observations was 6896 municipality-years. We used row-wise deletion, as the proportion of missing data (0.98%) was small and was unlikely to bias the estimation ( Harrell, 2015 ). As identification in fixed-effect models relies on within-municipality variations, all variables were measured in ten-year intervals to guarantee significant within-variations in green space. The population size of the municipalities ranged from 192 (Aogashima village in 1980) to around 3,690,000 (Yokohama in 2010), with an average population size of 71,237 and an average 14.91 suicide cases per 100,000 each year. The analytic period was determined based on the availability of green space and suicide data.
Suicide death data were taken from death records in the Vital Statistics collected by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, which cover all reported deaths in Japan (1975–2014) with information on the date of death, place where the death was reported, and the cause of death based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 8th/9th revisions (up to 1994) and ICD-10 (1995 to the present). We focused on deaths from suicide (ICD-8/9: E950-E959, ICD-10: X60-X84), and selected the sample based on several criteria. First, deaths of non-Japanese citizens and of individuals who died from suicide outside Japan were excluded. Second, given the small number of cases, we disregarded data from individuals who were under 18 years old. Third, we omitted deaths without valid information on the place of death.
The suicide rate in the statistical model, S i t , refers to the average number of suicides per 100,000 persons in municipality i over year t − 5 t o t + 4 . We use the average suicide rate over ten years centering around year t as opposed to a single year t for two main reasons. First, our observations were based on municipalities, some of which have small populations with few suicide cases in a single year. The annual suicide rate in some of these municipalities can fluctuate drastically, whereas the suicide rate over a longer period that averages the annual randomness should be more stable and much closer to actual local suicide severity. Second, it is likely that green space can have a continuing impact on individuals’ mental health and self-harming behavior beyond the point at which it is measured ( Alcock et al., 2014 ; Helbich et al., 2020 ; Takano et al., 2002 ). Suicide rates were examined for the entire population and for three age groups, 18–39 years old, 40–64 years old, and age 65 and above, for both males and females. We use age- and gender-specific rates because the impact of green space, as we described above, may differ across demographic groups ( Helbich et al., 2020 ; Shen and Lung, 2018 ).
To show the spatial distribution and temporal change of suicide mortality in Japan, we calculated the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) for the entire population in each municipality in the years 1975–1984 and 2005–2014, and fitted a binomial distribution to compute the probability of whether the SMR in each municipality was 20% above the national SMR. We further used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine urban-rural and gender differences in SMRs against the null hypothesis that both pairs were drawn from the same underlying distribution.
Green space data consisted of two land categories, woodlands and parks ( Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2010 ; National Spatial Planning and Regional Policy Bureau of Japan, 2011 ). The woodland data refers to the area size of all forests, grasslands, and wildwoods (excluding agricultural lands) of a municipality in year t ; while park data in the format of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) shapefile documents each park's geographic map coordinate point, area size, and the creation year of all 84,370 existing natural and artificial parks as of 2011. The geographic point data were used to determine the municipality where each park is located in Python GeoPandas (ver. 0.8.0). The park data were further measured in terms of coverage—the proportion of the total park area size to the municipal area, and density—the number of parks per 1000 of the population, which approximate the availability and accessibility of parks in a certain municipality. The largest park is Haruna Park located in the city of Takasaki covering an area of 520 ha, while the smallest park is Teganomori No.5 Greenway located in the city of Kashiwa covering an area of 8 square meters.
The main forms of greenness had a clear urban-rural division in Japan. While parks were highly concentrated in the designated large, small- and medium-sized cities, accounting for 85.3% of the total park area and 90.1% of the total number of parks, a majority of woodland areas (53.6%) were in rural non-cities in 2010. However, woodlands comprised the overwhelming majority of green space in both urban and rural municipalities. Specifically, 93.5%, 99.4%, and 99.8% of the total green area (parks and woodlands) in designated large cities, small- and medium-sized cities, and non-cities, respectively, in 2010.
Various covariates that may correlate with local suicide mortality were controlled for in the analysis. Specifically, information was included on: the population density of each unit area that might affect the level of local social integration ( Durkheim, 1951 ); the proportion of the population living in one-person households, the number of marriage and divorce cases per 1000 and the number of foreign residents per 1000 that may approximate the degree of social fragmentation; the demographic distribution (proportion of the population) working in different industrial sectors (agriculture, industry and service sectors); the unemployment rate; the level of economic development approximated by local fiscal strength, measured by governmental per capita tax revenue in thousands of Yen; and the number of psychiatric hospitals per 100,000 that may approximate the prevalence of mental illness.

All the data, other than the suicide mortality data, are publicly available and thus approval from an ethics committee was not necessary. Informed consent and ethics approval were also not necessary for the suicide data because these data were collected by a third party for administrative purposes and an anonymized version was made available for research purposes.
As suicides may be spatially clustered ( e.g. , Helbich et al., 2018 ), we first tested if there was any spatial autocorrelation of suicide cases that might violate the assumption of mutual independence across observations in non-spatial models. Moran's I statistic was used, with a pseudo p derived from 9999 Monte-Carlo simulations against the null hypothesis of spatial independence in designated large cities, small- and medium-sized cities, and rural non-cities in each decade. Significant Moran's I values indicated the use of spatial statistical models .
To accommodate the panel structure of our data with spatial autocorrelations, we estimated the following regression model with a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator with both municipality- and year-specific fixed effects ( Elhorst, 2003 ), assuming that the suicide mortality rate in each municipality is determined as a linear function of green space coverage or density, which has been typical in earlier studies that have similarly used aggregated suicide data ( Bixby et al., 2015 ; Shen and Lung, 2018 ). While Poisson or negative binomial regression modeling of count variables has been more commonly used in epidemiological studies , we used the suicide rate in its log form as an analogous response variable to accommodate the current statistical and software limitations of the Generalized Linear Model in dealing with spatially-autocorrelated panel data ( Millo and Piras, 2012 ). Our baseline model can be written as: (1) S i t = λ S L ( S i t ) + ∑ j = 1 3 β j G j i t + ∑ j = 1 m γ j x j i t + ∑ j = 1 3 κ j S L ( G j i t ) + ∑ j = 1 m η j S L ( x j i t ) + α i + θ t + ε i t (2) where ε i t = ρ S L ( ε i t ) + ν i t where our explanatory variables of concern, G j i t , denotes the ratio of parks or woodlands to the area size of municipality i in year t ( t = 1980 , 1990 , 2000 , 2010 ), and the park number per 1000 citizens in each municipality-year. Our outcome variable of interest, S i t , represents the average suicide rate per 100,000 in municipality i in a decade centering around t. We use an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, or a quasi-log transformation, for S i t in the baseline model to account for its percentage change with the presence of zeros ( Bellemare and Wichman, 2020 ). In equation (1) , we incorporate our control covariates by x j i t , including the unemployment rate and industrial structure among others. We also incorporate α i and θ t in our model, which represents municipality-specific and year-specific fixed effects respectively. The municipality-specific fixed effects capture the effect of time-invariant unobserved factors that could be associated with suicide rates, which include, but are not limited to, cultural norms and the stable socioeconomic conditions in each municipality, while the year effect captures the potential impact of economic shocks, natural disasters and any other major events in Japan in a particular decade. Finally, we include a municipality-year specific error term ε i t .
We used Moran's I with pseudo p < 0.05 to test spatial autocorrelations of suicide deaths in the three classes of municipalities with different levels of urbanicity in each decade (see Table A1 online), we incorporate in Equation (1) the spatial adjustment—the spatial lag function S L ( . ) that measures spatially-weighted suicide mortality, green space, and the covariates of the neighboring municipalities that share a common border with municipality i ( Anselin, 2013 ; Cliff and Ord, 1972 ). In the form of the matrix computation, (3) S L ( υ ) = W υ where the ( n × 1) vector υ is multiplied by a row-standardized ( n × n ) spatial weighting matrix W with zeros in the diagonal cells. In essence, each element of the vector S L ( υ ) measures the weighted average of variable υ of all neighboring units ( Anselin, 2013 ). We further include a spatially dependent error term ε i t with disturbance from neighboring error terms. In the Results section, we report the spatial autoregressive (SAR) coefficient λ measuring the interference effect of the neighboring suicide mortalities and the spatial error dependence (SEM) effect ρ .
Spatially lagged covariates and year- and municipality-specific fixed effects were included in all models, but not reported. Analyses were performed with the package spml in R (Version 1.4–11) ( Millo and Piras, 2012 ), with significance levels set at p = 0.001, 0.01 and 0.05.

Section: 3. Results

In total, 886,440 suicide deaths were registered in the study period, with a non-trivial urban-rural division and age-gender differences in suicide mortality. While the overwhelming majority (80.3%) of suicide cases occurred in large designated and small- and medium-sized cities (urban areas), the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the SMR in urban areas was distinct from and significantly lower than the SMR in rural areas ( p < 0.0001). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov D of the urban-rural SMR increased over time, from a low of 0.205 in 1980 to a high of 0.261 in 2010, indicating a widening gap in suicide mortality between urban and rural areas in Japan across time. As shown in Fig. 1 , while municipalities with a high probability of having exceedingly high suicide SMRs (20% above the national SMR) in 1980 (Panel A) were more evenly distributed across the nation, in 2010 (Panel B), municipalities that were particularly vulnerable to suicide deaths were mostly clustered in northeastern and southwestern Japan, and were typically rural, with primary industries. Suicide mortality also differed by age and gender, with the highest mean SMR observed among young females (18–39) (1.52, SD 1.24) and the lowest among middle-aged females (40–64) (0.84, SD 0.80). Overall, males had a significantly higher SMR than females in both urban and rural regions as assessed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests ( p < 0.0001).

Results based on the spatial statistical model for those cities designated as large cities are presented in Table 2 , with coefficient estimates for six age- and gender-specific subpopulations reported in each column. As shown in all columns except column (4) of Table 2 , in the most densely populated cities, park density was negatively associated with suicide mortality among all subpopulations except middle-aged males, while neither park coverage nor woodland consistently affected suicide mortality at a statistically significant level. The largest effect of park density was observed for females aged 65 and above, with a coefficient of −1.24 which indicates that an increase of one within-municipality standard deviation in park density (0.200) was associated with around a 24.8% reduction in suicide mortality, or 8.1 fewer cases per 100,000, among older females in designated cities. Smaller but non-trivial magnitude reductions in suicide mortality were also observed for all other subpopulations, except middle-aged males.

The importance of park density approximating the accessibility of public green space as opposed to park coverage in densely populated large cities can be visualized in the 23 wards of Tokyo ( Fig. 2 ). A visual inspection of Panel A in Fig. 2 depicting the distribution and the scaled size of each park in 2010, shows that the number of city parks was distributed fairly homogeneously in space in each ward with a few particularly large-scale parks close to the ward borders within Tokyo, while Panel B, which plots the park distribution across the wards by kernel density estimation shows that the parks were more densely clustered in the western part of the city. By contrast, Panel C, which depicts the park coverage in each ward with the five-level Jenks natural breaks classification, shows that the highest park coverage was seen in the eastern part of the city. Using the same five-level Jenks natural breaks classification, the average suicide rates in each ward in 2005–14 were also highest in the northern and western parts of the city (Panel D), having a more significantly negative association with park density ( r = −0.125) rather than coverage ( r = 0.535) in a cross-municipal perspective. Indeed, the highest average suicide rate in the city, 28.8 per 100,000 of the population, was observed in the same ward that has the highest park coverage (Taitō −7.4% of the total municipal area).

In designated large cities, significant spatial autocorrelations that imply suicidal interference across municipal borders were only observed in Column (2) and (4) among young and middle-aged males in the form of spatial error disturbance (spatial ρ ), possibly due to the two subgroups more frequent spatial mobility within large cities. Moreover, whereas some covariates such as the number of psychiatric hospitals had a consistently positive association with suicide mortality across subgroups, variables such as the unemployment rate had a varying effect, with negative associations found among females aged 40 and above and males aged 65 and above, and positive associations among males aged 18–64, who are typically expected to be employed and earning wages in Japan.
Columns (5) and (7) of Table 3 , which summarize the estimation based on 790 small- and medium-sized cities, show that park coverage was negatively associated with suicide mortality among middle-aged and older females in small- and medium-sized cities, whereas woodland had no significant effect on suicide mortality for any age-gender groups. The result in column (6) suggests that park density may also have a mitigating effect on older males’ suicide, although this effect was small in magnitude. In contrast with the limited spatial interference of suicide observed in designated large cities in Table 2 , suicide deaths in small- and medium-sized cities were highly clustered in space, with significant spatial autocorrelations identified in the form of either error disturbance (spatial ρ ) or a spatial lag effect (spatial λ ) for all age-gender specific subpopulations except young males aged 18–39.

Table 4 shows the results for 908 rural non-cities. There was no association between park space and suicide mortality for any of the demographic groups in rural areas. In contrast, Columns (4) and (6), show that woodland coverage was negatively associated with the suicide rate among middle-aged and older males, where, for instance, an increase in woodland coverage by one within-standard deviation (0.016) corresponded to an approximately 5.5%, or 14.9 cases per 100,000 decrease in suicide mortality among older males. Significant spatial autocorrelations were present among middle-aged and older females and among older males, potentially due to the concentration of older adults in rural areas. Table 4 .

Section: 4. Discussion

There has been comparatively little research to date on the association between greenness and suicide and results have been mixed. Research from the Netherlands has underlined the potential complexity of the greenness-suicide mortality association by suggesting that the relation may be limited to specific groups of the population and depend on the setting (urban/rural) and extent of greenness exposure ( Helbich et al., 2020 ). The results from our study are in line with this finding as we showed that although increased green space was associated with reduced suicide mortality, the association varied according to demographic factors (age, sex), the form of exposure (park, woodland) and location (large city, small- and medium-sized city, and non-city).
Although an earlier study found that green space was not associated with suicide mortality in the 50 largest cities in England ( Bixby et al., 2015 ), in the current study green space was linked to reduced suicide mortality in both large and small- and medium-sized cities. However, the association varied depending on the level of urbanity, with park density (parks per 1000 of the population) being important for suicide in large cities, while total park coverage was associated with fewer suicide deaths in small- and medium-sized cities. It can be speculated that different mechanisms might be involved in these associations. For example, as increasing urbanization has been linked to the perception of lower levels of greenness ( Coldwell and Evans, 2018 ), it is possible that in highly urbanized areas a greater number of per capita parks might result in more perceived green space, which in turn, has been associated with better psychological and mental health ( Cleary et al., 2019 ; Sugiyama et al., 2008 ), and which therefore, might also be important for suicide given the close link observed between psychiatric disorder and suicide ( Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009 ). Alternatively, it is possible that other factors such as greater park accessbility ( Wood et al., 2017 ) and quality ( Francis et al., 2012 ), which have been related to better mental health, might also be important in this setting.
In small- and medium-sized cities greater park coverage was linked to lower suicide rates. This corresponds with the finding from a recent systematic review that the extent of city park/green space coverage is associated with better mental health ( Houlden et al., 2018 ). It is uncertain what underlies this finding but it can be speculated that more urban parks are associated with an increased proximity to green space, which an earlier study linked to better psychological health ( Sturm and Cohen, 2014 ). Interestingly, another study, which found that the overall number of parks that were accessible within a 1.6 km walking distance was associated with positive mental health also showed that this relationship differed by park type/size ( Wood et al., 2017 ). This highlights the necessity of more research to determine how individuals interact with local green space, especially as our study suggests that there may be sex differences in the types and location of green space linked to suicide in Japan.
An extended discussion of the mechanisms linking green space and suicide mortality in Japan is beyond the scope of this study although several factors might be involved. Recent review studies have found an association between green space and mental health and wellbeing ( Fong et al., 2018 ; Houlden et al., 2018 ; Wendelboe-Nelson et al., 2019 ), which, as mentioned above, other research has highlighted has a proximal role in suicide mortality ( Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009 ). Some studies have also indicated that green space might have a restorative capacity (in terms of stress and attention) ( Markevych et al., 2017 ), which other research has connected (indirectly) to better mental health ( Dzhambov et al., 2018 ). It is possible that this might have been a factor in the current study as experimental research has shown that greenness exposure (forest therapy) is associated with physiological and psychological benefits in middle-aged Japanese women ( Ochiai et al., 2015 ). The role of greenness in reducing heat exposure ( Markevych et al., 2017 ; Zhou et al., 2011 ) should also be considered. In particular, research has shown that urban parks of all sizes ( Aram et al., 2019 ), including those in Japan ( Hamada and Ohta, 2010 ), can have a cooling effect on the surrounding environment. This might have been important as ecological research has linked increased temperature to suicide morality in Japan in the 1972–2015 period with the association being stronger in women and older adults ( Sim et al., 2020 ). Finally, the way in which green space is used might also be relevant. For example, previous research has shown that there is an association between greater green space availability and increased levels of physical activity ( Barton and Rogerson, 2017 ) and that engaging in ‘green exercise’ is associated with better psychological health ( Pretty et al., 2007 ).
This study has several limitations. First, we were not able to control for the effects of variables such as air pollution that have been linked to both green space ( Markevych et al., 2017 ) and suicide mortality ( Ng et al., 2016 ). Second, it was not possible to refine our measures of green space to better understand their association with suicide mortality. This may be an important omission as a recent study from Taiwan has shown that different aspects of green structure (patch area, fragmentation, patch distance) are all associated with suicide mortality but in different ways ( Shen and Lung, 2018 ). Moreover, we were also not able to examine the role of other forms of urban greennesss on suicide such as informal urban green space (e.g. vacant lots, brownfield sites), which a recent study showed were used by more than one-third of Japanese respondents for recreational activities ( Rupprecht et al., 2015 ). Third, we also had no information on the perceptions of green space, on the motivation to use green space or on its actual use ( Gascon et al., 2015 ) – all of which might be important for understanding the green space-suicide mortality association. Finally, as suicidality can develop over the life course, a cumulative (dynamic) measure of greenness exposure over time may be needed to properly understand the green space-suicide mortality association ( Helbich, 2018 ).
Our findings suggest that greater urban park and rural woodland coverage may be linked to lower suicide rates. With the common decline in vegetation cover in urban areas in recent decades ( Richards and Belcher, 2020 ), countries that face a growing suicide problem may be able to improve population mental health and reduce suicide rates by better preserving, designing, and expanding urban public green areas by increasing both the availability (coverage) and accessibility (density) of city green space, especially if they incorporate better designs to accommodate population needs. Indeed, considering that parks still form a very small part of total green space in urban areas, these policies might be important in attempts to improve population mental health and wellbeing in Japan. Further, as green space can affect mental and physical health via various channels, future research on suicide and greenness should attempt to shed light on the various pathways through which individuals might benefit from access to green space, as this might further improve the effectiveness of spatial planning and suicide prevention. Finally, as suicide among children and adolescents continues to be an important public health/social issue in Japan ( Isumi et al., 2020 ), research is also needed to determine the role of green space in the psychological wellbeing of young people in this setting.
