Title: Air quality and the risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Singapore (PAROS): a time series analysis


Abstract: Summary


Abstract_Section: Background

Previous studies have reported positive associations between out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and air pollutant concentrations, but there are inconsistencies across studies. We aimed to investigate the association between pollutant concentrations and the risk of OHCA in Singapore.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We did a time series analysis of all cases of OHCA in Singapore reported between July 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2018, to the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS), a prospective, population-based registry. Using multivariable fractional polynomial modelling, we investigated the immediate (day 0) and lagged (up to 5 days after exposure) association between 10 μg/m 3 increases in concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 2·5 μm or smaller (PM 2·5 ), particulate matter with a diameter of 10 μm or smaller (PM 10 ), ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and 1 mg/m 3 increase in carbon monoxide (CO) and relative risk (RR) of OHCA.

Abstract_Section: Findings

We extracted data for 18 131 cases of OHCA. The median age of this cohort of cases was 65 years (IQR 56–80), 6484 (35·8%) were female, 11 647 (64·2%) were male, 12 270 (67·7%) were Chinese, 2873 (15·8%) were Malay, and 2010 (11·1%) were Indian. Every 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2·5 was associated with increased risk of OHCA (RR 1·022 [95% 1·002–1·043]) over the next 2 days, which decreased over the subsequent 3 days (3–5 days after exposure; 0·976 [0·955–0·998]). For PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , and SO 2 , we did not observe any associations between increased concentration and risk of OHCA on day 0 or cumulative risk over time (ie, at 0–1 days, 0–2 days, 0–3 days, 0–4 days, 0–5 days, and 3–5 days after exposure). For CO, we observed a cumulative decreased risk of OHCA across 0–5 days after exposure (0·876 [0·770–0·997]) and at days 3–5 after exposure (0·810 [0·690–0·949]). We observed effect modification of the association between increasing PM 2·5 concentration and OHCA 0–2 days after exposure by cardiac arrest rhythm (non-shockable 1·027 [1·004–1·050] vs shockable 1·002 [0·956–1·051]) and location of OHCA (at home: 1·033 [1·008–1·057] vs not at home 0·955 [0·957–1·035]). In hypothetical modelling, the number of OHCA events associated with PM 2·5 could be reduced by 8% with a 1 μg/m 3 decrease in PM 2·5 concentrations and by 30% with a 3 μg/m 3 decrease in PM 2·5 concentrations.

Abstract_Section: Interpretation

Increases in PM 2·5 concentration were associated with an initial increased risk of OHCA and a subsequent reduced risk from 3–5 days after exposure, suggesting a short-term harvesting effect. A decrease in PM 2·5 concentrations could reduce population demand for emergency health services.

Section: Introduction

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the most severe presentation of cardiovascular diseases, with an incidence of 84 cases per 100 000 persons-years and a survival rate of less than 10%. Because of the considerable disease burden of OHCA, understanding and reducing the contributors to cardiovascular diseases and OHCA is important. Air pollution is one of the major modifiable causes of disease, accounting for approximately 4·2 million all-age all-cause deaths in 2015 globally. One of the most studied air pollutants is particulate matter (PM), including those with a median aerodynamic diameter of 2·5 μm or less (PM 2·5 ) and of 10 μm or less (PM 10 ). Exposure to PM 2·5 is a major recognised cardiovascular risk factor, such that the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health highlighted air quality action plans to address cardiovascular diseases. Short-term increases in concentrations of PM 2·5 and PM 10 have been associated with acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and death due to cardiovascular diseases.
The WHO air quality guideline values were lowered in 2021, from a target annual PM 2·5 concentration of 10 μg/m 3 to 5 μg/m 3 , and from a target annual PM 10 concentration of 20 μg/m 3 to 15 μg/m 3 , because of new evidence of adverse health outcomes at lower concentration levels than previous thought. Studies investigating the correlation between risk of OHCA and the concentration of air pollutants have reported inconsistent results, especially at pollution concentrations below the WHO air quality guideline values. PM 2·5 has been found to be associated with OHCA in cities such as New York (NY, USA), Houston (TX, USA), and Melbourne (VIC, Australia), but not in areas with lower concentrations of pollutants, such as Denmark and Seattle (WA, USA). Findings from studies on other pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O 3 ) have equally been mixed. For example, a systematic review done in 2017 found that NO 2 and O 3 were associated with increased risk of OHCA, whereas some nationwide studies have found no significant associations. Additional research is needed to clarify whether there is an association between ambient air pollutants and risk of OHCA.

Singapore has variations in air quality that are contributed to by both local and non-local sources of emissions, including regional land fires. The resultant variation in air quality, in addition to Singapore's robust surveillance, provide optimal real-world data for assessing its effect on population health. We aimed to investigate the association between air pollutant concentrations and risk of OHCA in Singapore.

Section: Methods

In this time series analysis, we used data from the Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) to assess the association between air pollutants and risk of OHCA in Singapore. The PAROS is an ongoing, prospective, population-based registry designed to provide data on the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of OHCA in nine countries across the Asia-Pacific region—namely Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Türkiye, and the United Arab Emirates. Singapore is an urban city-state with a tropical climate characterised by warm temperatures, high humidity, and abundant rainfall. Its major sources of air pollution include motor vehicle, industrial, and maritime emissions, and episodic transboundary pollution from wildfires and land-clearing activities in the wider southeast Asian region. In 2018, the crude incidence of OHCA in Singapore was 52·7 per 100 000 population, and the age-standardised rate was 42·2 cases per 100 000 population.
We collected data on all cases of OHCA in Singapore that were reported to PAROS between July 1, 2010, and Dec 31, 2018. All OHCA cases were attended by the national emergency ambulance service, and all public hospital OHCA data are reported to PAROS. Data were extracted from emergency dispatch records, ambulance case notes, and hospital records. Cases of OHCA were defined according to the Utstein recommendations. We included OHCAs of all causes in this study.
The Centralised Institutional Review Board and the Domain Specific Review Board granted approval for our study with a waiver of patient consent (reference 2017/2380).
We obtained the concentrations of six air pollutants (PM 2·5 , PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , CO, and SO 2 ) from June 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2018, from the National Environment Agency (NEA) Singapore. The NEA collects ambient pollutant concentrations via 22 remote stations, and data on temperature, humidity, and rainfall via 11 weather stations across Singapore. The approximate locations of the remote air quality stations are shown in the appendix (p 3) , in addition to mobile telemetric monitoring stations that travel across the city-state.
We averaged the daily measurements of pollutant concentrations, temperature, humidity, and rainfall across air quality monitoring and weather stations to derive daily national mean (SD) measures. We then linked the environmental exposures to nationally reported OHCA events on a daily timescale to form the dataset used in our analysis. We analysed OHCA events by case, rather than by individual, such that the same individual might be included multiple times if they had multiple events during the study period.
We report demographic variables as frequencies and percentages and air quality variables as medians and IQRs. We developed the core model using generalised Poisson regression and we adjusted the long-term trend using linear and quadratic terms together with trigonometric functions for periodic patterns. We used multivariable fractional polynomial modelling to explore the linearity of the temperature effect using the R function mfp. For example, l o g ⁡ ( 𝐸 ⁡ [ c a r d i a c _ a r r e s t t ] ) ⁢ 𝛼 + s i n ⁡ ( 2 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ t / 3 6 5 ) + c o s ⁡ ( 2 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ t / 3 6 5 ) + f p ⁡ ( t e m p t ) + f p ⁡ ( t e m p t − 1 ) + f p ⁡ ( t e m p t − 2 ) (1)
where E denotes cardiac arrest event, t denotes the day, fp denotes the fractional polynomial, and k is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 to denote the cycles of 12, 6, 4, 3, and 2 months, respectively.
We examined the same-day (lag 0 days) and delayed effects (up to 5 days after exposure) of each air pollutant for an association with OHCA incidence. A lag of up to 5 days was selected because this was commonly adopted in previous studies, and across ten US cities the estimated effect of air pollution and daily deaths did not reach zero until 5 days after exposure, which might be due to the distribution of sensitivities to air pollution in the general population. We assessed the independent immediate and lag-specific effects of each air pollutant and their cumulative effects on risk of OHCA using the core model. The daily number of OHCA cases was the dependent variable. We reported the cumulative and adjusted relative risk (RR) and 95% CI, for every 10 μg/m 3 increase in the concentration of PM 2·5 , PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 and SO 2 , and every 1·0 mg/m 3 increase in CO concentration, adjusted for daily mean temperature, daily relative humidity, and daily total rainfall.
We also explored the association between PM 2·5 and risk of OHCA in the subgroups of age (<65 and ≥65 years), arrest rhythm (non-shockable and shockable; shockable rhythms include ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and non-shockable rhythms include asystole and pulseless electrical activity), and location of arrest (at home and not at home) concentration. We determined that effect modification from these factors was present if a significant association between an air pollutant concentration and risk of OHCA was found in one subgroup but not the other. Additionally, we did a stratified analysis by sex to explore any sex differences in risk of OHCA with increasing PM 2·5 .
To established how reduction in air pollutant concentrations would reduce the number of the OHCA events, we did a prespecified analysis using equation 2 to estimate the attributable fraction and equation 3 to estimate the absolute number of OHCA events associated with a 10 μg/m 3 increase in the concentration of PM 2·5 on the present day.
A F d = R R d − 1 R R d (2) A N d = A F d × N d (3)
AF d refers to the attributable fraction for the air pollutant of interest on the day d, N d refers to the number of OHCA on day d, RR d refers to the cumulative RR corresponding to the increase in concentration of the air pollutant of interest, for which the reference value is the lowest observed concentration in our study period, and AN d refers to the absolute number of OHCA events on the day of interest. To obtain the air pollutant-specific total attributable fraction for the study, we took the sum of its immediate and lagged contributions from all days of the study and divided it by the total number of cases of OHCA reported. We used the 95% CIs for the RRs to calculate the 95% CIs for the attributable fractions. We then assumed two hypothetical scenarios in which the PM 2·5 concentrations on each day were reduced by 1 μg/m 3 and 3 μg/m 3 and calculated the corresponding change in the number of OHCA events. We only did the attributable burden analysis for PM 2·5 because this is the pollutant of greatest concern internationally and is often selected as an overall indicator of the health risks from the overall mix of pollutants.
We did all analyses using R (version 4.04), and we considered p values of less than 0·05 to be significant.

Section: Results

There were 18 131 cases of OHCA in Singapore during the study period. 35 people had more than one OHCA event and were included in our analysis for each event. The mean number of daily cases was 5·8 (SD 3·0). The median age at the time of OHCA was 65 years (IQR 56–80) and 6484 (35·8%) patients were female, 11 647 (64·2%) were male, 12 270 (67·7%) were Chinese, 2873 (15·8%) were Malay, and 2010 (11·1%) were Indian ( table 1 ). The most common medical comorbidities were hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, heart diseases, and diabetes ( table 1 ). The most common first arrest rhythm was shockable (ie, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation). Most OHCA events occurred at home, with the other events occurring at a public or commercial building, on a street or highway, or at other locations ( table 1 ).
Across the study period, the mean daily temperature was 27·8°C (SD 1·1), and the mean relative humidity was 79·6% (SD 5·4). The median daily concentration of PM 2·5 was 15·9 μg/m 3 (IQR 12·6–20·4), PM 10 was 27·4 μg/m 3 (22·8–33·4), O 3 was 23·2 μg/m 3 (17·9–30·8), NO 2 was 23·6 μg/m 3 (19·1–28·9), CO was 0·53 mg/m 3 (0·46–0·61), and SO 2 was 10·4 μg/m 3 (5·8–14·9). The distributions of the daily concentrations of the six air pollutants were positively skewed ( appendix p 1 ). There were two major peaks in concentrations of PM 2·5 , PM 10 , and CO between June and July, 2013, and between September and October, 2015, corresponding to the 2013 and 2015 southeast Asian haze events ( figure ).
Increases in PM 2·5 , PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , CO, and SO 2 were not significantly associated with risk of OHCA on the same day (ie, 0 days of lag; table 2 ). Every 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2·5 was associated with a cumulative increased risk of OHCA 0–2 days after exposure, and decreased risk over the next 3 days (3–5 days after exposure; table 2 ). An increase in CO of 1·0 mg/m 3 was associated with a significant cumulative decrease in risk of OHCA between days 0 and 5 and between days 3 and 5 after exposure. The increases in the concentrations of PM 10 , O 3 , NO 2 , and SO 2 were not associated with immediate or cumulative risk of OHCA up to 5 days.
We did a subgroup analysis of risk of OHCA with increasing PM 2·5 concentration in patients with shockable and non-shockable rhythms ( table 3 ). In patients with non-shockable OHCA, each 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2·5 was associated with an increased cumulative risk of OHCA in the next 2 days, and a decreased cumulative risk in the subsequent 3 days, but no such associations were seen for those with shockable arrest rhythms. In the subgroup analysis by age group, increasing PM 2·5 concentration was not associated with increased cumulative risk of OHCA but was associated with decreased cumulative risk of OHCA after 3–5 days, and only in those aged 65 years and older ( table 3 ). In the subgroup analysis by location of OHCA, we found an increased cumulative risk of OHCA with increasing PM 2·5 in individuals who had an at-home OHCA 0–2 days after exposure, and a subsequent cumulative decrease in risk 3–5 days after exposure ( table 3 ). We found no associations between PM 2·5 and OHCA events that did not occur at home.
In the exploratory sex-stratified analysis, we did not observe any evidence that sex affected the association between increasing PM 2·5 and risk of OHCA ( appendix p 2 ). An increase in PM 2·5 concentration on day 0 was associated with a cumulative increase in the risk of OHCA in male individuals up to 2 days later (RR 1·034 [95% CI 1·009–1·061]) and in female individuals up to 3 days later (1·041 [1·007–1·077]). For both sexes, we observed a similar cumulative decrease in the risk of PM 2·5 -attributable OHCA risk subsequent to the initial increase in risk (RR for male individuals 3–5 days after exposure 0·963 [95% CI 0·937–0·989] and RR for female individuals 4–5 days after exposure 0·958 [95% CI 0·924–0·993]; appendix p 2 ).
Using the lowest PM 2·5 reference value of 5·69 μg/m 3 observed over the study period, we estimated that 492 (95% CI 43–919) OHCA events on day 0 and the subsequent 2 days (0–2 days after exposure) were attributable to an increase in PM 2·5 concentration on day 0. Assuming that the PM 2·5 reference value remained constant, a hypothetical 1 μg/m 3 decrease in PM 2·5 concentrations could result in an 8% reduction in the number of OHCA events, and a 3 μg/m 3 decrease in PM 2·5 concentration could result in a 30% reduction in the number of events ( table 4 ).

Section: Discussion

In this time series analysis, we found that increasing PM 2·5 concentrations were associated with an immediate increased risk of OHCA over the first 2 days after exposure and a subsequent cumulative decrease in risk 3–5 days after exposure. The association between PM 2·5 concentration and risk of OHCA was affected by the type of arrest rhythm and the location of the arrest event.
Previous studies have found that PM 2·5 concentrations are more strongly associated with OHCA than CO, SO 2 , O 3 , and NO 2 concentrations and had the highest population attributable fraction. A systematic review of 15 studies found that a short term (0–6 days before the OHCA event) 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2·5 concentration was associated with 4·1% increase in risk of OHCA. We found that increases in PM 2·5 concentration increased the risk of OHCA in the first 2 days after exposure, but decreased the risk on days 3–5. One possible explanation is a harvesting effect, such that an increase in PM 2·5 concentration triggered earlier OHCA in those who had compromised health and who would probably have had a cardiac arrest subsequently. After this initial harvesting effect within the first few days of exposure, the number of cases of OHCA might decrease because the population who are susceptible has decreased. Similarly, another study in Nanjing, China, found that the association between PM 2·5 concentration and overall or cardiovascular mortality was initially positive at 0–1 day after exposure but negative 2 days after exposure. Over cumulative lag periods of 0–15 days and 0–30 days, increase in PM 2·5 concentration was associated with increased cardiovascular death. In seven major cities in South Korea, incidence of cardiovascular death associated with PM 10 increased 0–1 days after exposure, but within 28 days of exposure increased PM 10 was associated with reduced incidence of cardiovascular death. However, at 0–45 days after exposure, increased PM 10 concentration was again associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular death. Taken together, PM might lead to an acute increase in OHCA in the first few days of exposure due to a harvesting effect, but in the medium and longer term might lead to a genuine increase in the incidence of OHCA. Further research is needed with longer lag durations to confirm this hypothesis.
Several pathophysiological mechanisms for the association between PM and OHCA have been suggested. PM might cause systemic inflammation, subsequently causing increased coagulation, platelet aggregation, and thrombus formation in the coronary arteries. Furthermore, PM might lead to autonomic imbalance, which has been associated with increased risk of cardiac events, sustained ventricular tachycardia, and mortality. The cause of OHCA is most often cardiac, of which ischaemic heart disease is the most common. In an American Cancer Society study, ischaemic cardiac events were found to account for the largest relative and absolute risk for mortality per 10 μm/m 3 increase in PM 2·5 concentration. In particular, PM 2·5 is more strongly associated with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) than non-STEMI. STEMI is caused by a complete occlusion of a coronary vessel, leading to larger infarct sizes than non-STEMI. PM 2·5 might trigger STEMI through increased oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions, elevation of blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and autonomic dysfunction, and thrombosis caused by the hypercoagulable state. The triggering of acute cardiac events by PM 2·5 might be mediated through epigenetic changes, involving DNA methylation, histone acetylation modification, and chromosome remodelling, which is a potential area for future research in air pollution and OHCA risk.
We found that PM 2·5 was associated with risk of non-shockable arrest rhythm types of OHCA but not shockable arrest rhythm types. Shockable arrests are most commonly caused by ischaemic heart disease and acute myocardial infarction, while non-shockable rhythms are caused by the common reversible causes of cardiac arrest such as hypovolaemia, hypoxia, tamponade, tension pneumothorax, and late manifestations of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (together commonly known as the Hs and Ts). In a study by Rosenthal and colleagues in Helsinki, Finland, PM 2·5 -associated OHCA was found to be mainly caused by acute myocardial infarction. In the initial phase of acute myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation occur due to ischaemia, causing acidosis and electrolyte imbalance in the myocardium. In acute myocardial infarction associated with PM 2·5 , non-shockable OHCA might result from sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation causing cessation of electrical and mechanical cardiac activity. An initial non-shockable rhythm in OHCA caused by STEMI has been found to be associated with worse neurological outcomes and survival. Possibly due to the systemic inflammation effect of PM, PM is also associated with lung inflammation and respiratory diseases, which are important non-cardiac causes of non-shockable OHCA. Therefore, PM-associated OHCA might have poorer outcomes than OHCA due to other causes and should be prioritised in environmental and public health policies.
There is a paucity of published data on how the risk of OHCA associated with air pollution is altered by the location of the arrest event. In our dataset, 72% of OHCAs occurred at home, and such events have higher mortality than OHCAs that occur at other locations do, and might comprise a more vulnerable population because individuals with lower physiological reserve and exercise tolerance are more likely to stay at home. In our stratified analyses, we found that increasing PM 2·5 concentration was associated with OHCA at home 0–2 days after exposure, and so, considering that people at home might be more vulnerable, this increasing risk might further increase the risk of poor OHCA outcomes. Hence, public education on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (known as CPR) might be of importance in improving the outcomes of OHCA in residential areas with high PM 2·5 concentrations. Indoor filtration devices might also have cardiovascular benefits, and a meta-analysis of 14 randomised controlled trials showed that systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, reactive hyperaemia index, and inflammatory markers improved with indoor air purification. However, the effect of air filtration devices on OHCA requires further study. We did not have sufficient evidence to suggest effect modification by age. Although increasing PM 2·5 concentration was significantly associated with lower cumulative risk of OHCA 3–5 days after exposure in those aged 65 years and older, the cumulative risk of OHCA 0–2 days after exposure did not differ significantly in either subgroup (<65 or ≥65 years). The reduction in risk of OHCA 3–5 days after exposure in those aged 65 years and older might be due to an increased harvesting effect in the older age group. In Japan, a short-term effect of an increase in PM 2·5 concentration up to 3 days before the cardiac arrest was associated with cardiac OHCA in individuals aged 65 years and older, but not in those who were younger than 65 years. Similarly, in Houston (TX, USA), increasing PM 2·5 concentration had a greater effect on risk of OHCA in patients younger than 65 years than those aged 65 years and older, but more studies are warranted.
A meta-analysis of 11 studies with a median or mean range of CO concentrations from 0·14 to 2·14 mg/m 3 showed no significant association with OHCA. In our study, we found a negative association between increasing concentrations of CO at 0–5 days and 3–5 days after exposure and risk of OHCA, which differed from findings in a previous meta-analysis. This difference in findings might be due to a more pronounced harvesting effect in our study than in other studies, because CO 0–2 days after exposure was associated with a positive trend in risk of OHCA, which did not reach statistical significance. Further studies are required to ascertain the biological mechanisms through which CO affects risk of OHCA.
Each life saved from an OHCA event might on average reduce 18·1 disability-adjusted life years, defined as the sum of years of life lost and years lived with disability. We found that a 1 μg/m 3 decrease in mean daily PM 2·5 concentrations could potentially reduce the number of acute OHCA events (ie, occuring within 0–2 days) by 8%. A decrease of 3 μg/m 3 in mean daily PM 2·5 concentrations, which would effectively put the mean concentrations below the 2021 WHO air quality guidance value of 15 μg/m 3 , could potentially reduce the number of OHCA events by 30%. On days with high concentrations of PM 2·5 , individuals at high baseline risk of OHCA might be particularly susceptible to PM 2·5 -associated OHCA, and so using remote cardiac telemonitoring to assist with the detection and subsequent management of OHCA would be particularly helpful, and is in development for such situations. Improvements in air quality have good potential to reduce the risk of OHCA and consequently reduce PM 2·5 -attributable population demand for emergency health services.
Our study has several strengths. We used high quality disease data from a prospective, population-based, nationwide database. This database captured OHCA events from the ambulance services in addition to hospital cases; therefore, we were able to capture cardiac arrest events in patients who might have died at the scene who might have been missed in hospital-based studies. Additionally, the quality of the air quality data is also high because of robust surveillance around the island. The concentrations of air pollution is generally comparable with European and North American cities, which might aid the generalisability of our results to these regions. However, this might also cause statistical limitations because of the relatively large increments of air pollutant concentration used in this study, which we selected to allow comparisons with previous literature.
Our study also has several limitations. First, the average pollutant concentration across all the stations might not accurately reflect individual exposures, because pollutant concentrations might vary by proximity to the air pollutant measurement station and might not be the same indoors because of additional emission sources or behaviours such as mask wearing or using air filtration devices. Concentrations of air pollutants might also vary with vertical height, which could affect individual exposure because high-rise residences are common in Singapore. There is scope in future studies with more detailed exposure modelling to account for spatial heterogeneity. Second, this is an observational ecological study, and therefore our findings are not generalisable at an individual level. Third, our results might be biased by unmeasured confounders, such as time of OHCA, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. We analysed the daily counts of OHCA events and rather than individuals who had events because it is unlikely that more than one event for a single individual would occur on the same day, because the individual would either die or be admitted to hospital. Fourth, the air pollutants we considered in our study might not completely reflect the range of other air pollutants that exist concurrently and that might also have contributed to OHCA. However, the air pollutants we included might still be relied on as proxies of the air quality variations on OHCA risk. Finally, potential colinearity of coexposures, such as between copollutants and meteorological factors, can restrict the ability of statistical models to identify the independent effects of each factor. In this regard, this study should be considered in the context of the international literature where other studies have been conducted in settings with a different mix of coexposures.
In summary, increases in PM 2·5 concentration were associated with a short-term increases in cumulative risk of OHCA at days 0–2 after exposure, and a reduced cumulative risk at days 3–5 after exposure, which suggests a short-term harvesting effect. PM 2·5 concentrations might be associated with non-shockable OHCA at home and, therefore, might increase the risk of OHCA with poor outcomes. Improvements in PM 2·5 concentrations might lead to a decrease in the population burden of OHCA and reduce the demand for PM 2·5 -attributable emergency health services.
