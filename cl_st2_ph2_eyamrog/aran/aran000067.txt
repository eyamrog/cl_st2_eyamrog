Title: Broadening Perspectives on the Evolution of Human Paternal Care and Fathers’ Effects on Children


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

Unlike most mammals, human fathers cooperate with mothers to care for young to an extraordinary degree. Human paternal care likely evolved alongside our unique life history strategy of raising slow-developing, energetically costly children, often in rapid succession. Adaptive frameworks generally assume that paternal provisioning played a critical role in this pattern's emergence. We draw on nonhuman primate data to propose that nonprovisioning forms of low-cost hominin male care were potentially foundational and ratcheted up through evolutionary time, helping facilitate social contexts for later subsistence specialization and sharing. We then argue for expanding the breadth of anthropological research on paternal effects in families, particularly in three domains: direct care and teaching;social capital cultivation; and reduction of family conflict. Anthropologists can greatly contribute to conversations about the determinants of children's development across contexts, but we need to ask more expansive questions about the pathways through which caregivers (including fathers) affect child outcomes.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Human males’ potential for extensive, diverse forms of child care and intensive paternal investment (definition from Clutton-Brock 1991 ) evolved alongside a suite of derived human life history characteristics. Our “slow” life history strategy includes raising offspring that often remain dependent on adult care through their second decade of life. Despite this extensive, extended investment period, our shortened interbirth intervals mean that hyperdependent offspring are stacked on top of one another under natural fertility conditions ( Bogin 2006 , Hawkes & Coxworth 2013 , Hill & Kaplan 1999 , Kaplan et al. 2000 , Kramer 2010 ). To support this energetically demanding life history strategy, human mothers generally cooperatively care for children with a variety of partners, including fathers, other kin, and nonkin, which is remarkable for a mammal ( Bribiescas et al. 2012 , Fernandez-Duque et al. 2009 , Gray & Crittenden 2014 , Hawkes & Coxworth 2013 , Hill & Hurtado 2009 , Kaplan et al. 2000 , Kramer 2010 ). Here, our goal is to discuss emerging evolutionarily grounded, comparative research on fathering in hopes of generating new questions about the effects of fathers on children and families and vice versa. These insights are potentially relevant both to how we think about the emergence and function of paternal care evolutionarily and also to contemporary understandings of family systems and health in a globalized world.

Section: THE CONUNDRUM OF COMMITTED MAMMALIAN FATHERS

Although prevalence estimates vary, mammalian paternal care occurs in only ∼3–5% of species ( Kleiman & Malcolm 1981 ; paternal care definition from Clutton-Brock 1991 ). Its rarity almost certainly reflects divergences in male and female reproductive strategies that emerged alongside internal fertilization, internal gestation, and lactation ( Clutton-Brock 1991 , Kokko & Jennions 2008 ). Internal fertilization and gestation reduce paternity certainty, particularly when females mate with multiple males. They also somewhat limit males’ ability to offer beneficial assistance and/or to remain in proximity to their young between fertilization and birth. These factors likely contribute to the predominant pattern of male–male competition for limited mating opportunities with multiple females, a dynamic that is evolutionarily reinforced by the large between-male differences in reproductive success that such competition frequently produces. The evolutionary history and resulting phylogenetic inertia in Class Mammalia severely limits the social conditions, behaviors, and physiological mechanisms necessary for male mammals to regularly care for offspring ( Kokko & Jennions 2008 , Rosenbaum & Gettler 2018a ).
Compared with its expression in most other mammalian Orders, paternal care is more common among primates. However, this is primarily because such behavior is relatively prevalent among the New World monkeys, especially marmosets, tamarins, owl monkeys, and titi monkeys ( Fernandez-Duque et al. 2009 , Storey & Ziegler 2016 , Tardif & Bales 1997 ). There is undoubted utility for evolutionary models in comparing cooperative caregiving in these species with its expression in humans ( Fernandez-Duque et al. 2009 , Rosenbaum & Gettler 2018b , Snowdon & Ziegler 2007 ). However, humans are phylogenetically much more closely related to Old World monkeys and apes ( Fernandez-Duque et al. 2009 ). As we argue below, the social and mating behaviors of these species can provide potential insights on the contexts in which paternal care emerged in the hominin lineage. Thus, we focus our short review on these more closely related species.
As for most mammals and many primates, human phylogenetic history suggests that there would have been barriers to the evolution of hominin paternal investment. Specifically, among nonhuman Old World primates, only siamangs regularly practice intensive biparental care ( Fernandez-Duque et al. 2009 ). Humans’ potential evolutionary history of multimale, multifemale groups with promiscuous mating—homologous to modern Pan species—has long been conceptualized as a difficult-to-overcome obstacle to the evolution of pair-bonding and biparental care. Others argue that these behaviors were more likely to have emerged from social structures characterized by one-male, multifemale units because of increased paternity certainty for males ( Chapais 2013 , Schacht & Kramer 2019 ). However, this polygynous socioecology would also have posed challenges to the evolution of paternal investment owing to the specific competition-oriented male characteristics for which it selects ( Kokko & Jennions 2008 ). Although phylogenetic analyses indicate that transitioning to social monogamy is generally a necessary precursor to the evolution of mammalian biparental care ( Lukas & Clutton-Brock 2013 , Opie et al. 2013 ), findings from some Old World nonhuman primates have raised new questions about the assumption that male care and nonmonogamous mating systems are always incompatible.
Specifically, some Old World nonhuman primates show well-documented patterns of adult male−young interaction. These behaviors have been most thoroughly characterized among macaques and baboons living in multifemale, multimale groups, as may have occurred during our hominin past. Here, we focus on those species, as they can help inform our understanding of the socioecological conditions under which selection could favor male care, but note that similar patterns have been documented in other primates [e.g., colobus monkeys ( Fox 2015 ), snub-nosed monkeys ( Xiang et al. 2009 )]. For example, among macaques, interactions with males make up a relatively small proportion of infants’ socializing, but importantly, such interactions are often affiliative. In some species, males preferentially interact with infants they likely sired ( Langos et al. 2013 , Minge et al. 2016 ), hinting at the existence of paternity discrimination mechanisms. However, males are not similarly discriminatory in other macaque species, potentially indicating context- or population-specific plasticity in the expression and function of these behaviors ( Kerhoas et al. 2016 , Ménard et al. 2001 , Paul et al. 1996 ). Whether infants or males are more likely to initiate these interactions also varies ( Kerhoas et al. 2016 , Langos et al. 2015 , Minge et al. 2016 ). This variation may depend in part on the benefits accrued to infants [e.g., protection ( Kerhoas et al. 2016 )] compared with males [e.g., agonistic buffering; mating opportunities ( Henkel et al. 2010 , Ménard et al. 2001 )] in different species and populations.
Males’ affiliation with infants may be a strategy that increases fitness through subsequent mating opportunities with the mother [“care-then-mate” ( Kerhoas et al. 2016 , Ménard et al. 2001 )]. In some species, males with more frequent positive social interactions with females have higher mating success ( Kulik et al. 2012 ), and preferential male–female social relationships can span multiple female reproductive periods ( Haunhorst et al. 2016 , Ostner et al. 2013 ). Haunhorst and colleagues (2020) found that in Assamese macaques, females compete for the attention of males who have prior histories of affiliation with infants. Despite these hints at potential fitness benefits, male macaques do not typically engage in care consistent with investment [e.g., intervention in conflicts to support offspring ( Kulik et al. 2012 )].
BABOON FRIENDSHIPS
Baboon “friendships” are close social bonds formed between an adult male baboon and a lactating female baboon with an infant, who reside in a larger, multimale, multifemale social group ( Palombit et al. 1997 , Smuts 2017 ). These relationships emerge during pregnancy and may last beyond weaning ( Huchard et al. 2013 , Städele et al. 2019 ) but dissolve if the infant dies ( Palombit et al. 1997 ). Females’ “friends” are often, but not always, the sires of their current infants and are thought to provide protection against feticide ( Zipple et al. 2017 ), infanticide ( Palombit et al. 1997 ), or harassment by group members ( Nguyen et al. 2009 ). Male friends also typically maintain highly tolerant and/or affiliative relationships with the infants themselves (e.g., Moscovice et al. 2009 ). Friendship during lactation does not consistently increase males’ likelihood of siring a female's next infant ( Baniel et al. 2016 , Nguyen et al. 2009 , Städele et al. 2019 ), although successive infants are sometimes sired by the same male ( Städele et al. 2019 ). Some researchers avoid the term friendship because most evidence suggests that such affiliative associations represent a form of “joint parental care” ( Nguyen et al. 2009 ) rather than a relationship based on males’ and females’ affection for one another.

There has also been substantial research on extended male–female “friendships” and paternal care among baboon species ( Smuts 2017 ; see the sidebar titled Baboon Friendships). These relationships appear to reduce the likelihood of infanticide and/or harassment by other group members, both of which represent significant risks for infants and thus to parents’ fitness ( Buchan et al. 2003 , Cheney et al. 2015 , Nguyen et al. 2009 , Palombit et al. 1997 ). This protection may help explain why females compete for access to these associations with males ( Archie et al. 2014 , Cheney et al. 2012 , Palombit et al. 2001 ). Ample evidence also demonstrates that males more frequently form friendships with mothers whose infants they likely sired ( Baniel et al. 2016 , Huchard et al. 2010 , Moscovice et al. 2010 , Palombit et al. 1997 ). Along with providing protection during infancy, males can help facilitate juveniles’ access to preferable foods ( Huchard et al. 2013 , Moscovice et al. 2009 ), and in at least one species, the presence of likely fathers helps accelerate their offspring's reproductive maturity, one determinant of a baboon's lifetime reproductive success ( Charpentier et al. 2008 ). During juvenility and adulthood, baboons may also preferentially interact with paternal siblings ( Lynch et al. 2017 , Smith et al. 2003 ); such interactions are potentially mediated by their father's presence ( Lynch et al. 2017 ). Other research suggests that sibling bonds may improve offspring survival and thus have fitness consequences ( Silk et al. 2009 ).
Great ape research has also generated some surprising insights in the last decade. Among chimpanzees and (especially) gorillas, males aggressively defend their groups ( Watts 1996 ), which for males with offspring is a form of (potentially very costly) indirect care (definition from Kleiman & Malcolm 1981 ). Although current published evidence suggests that adult male and young chimpanzees interact very little, males may preferentially direct these interactions toward immatures they fathered ( Lehmann et al. 2006 , Murray et al. 2016 ). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that chimpanzee fathers and their adolescent and young adult sons form preferential grooming bonds ( Sandel et al. 2020 ). In contrast, male mountain gorillas do not seem to discriminate their own young from those of other males. However, they are highly tolerant of infants and juveniles and regularly interact with them ( Rosenbaum et al. 2011 , 2015 ; Stewart 2001 ). Notably, a recent study showed that males engaging in greater direct care have higher reproductive success ( Rosenbaum et al. 2018 ), independent of their dominance rank. Since some groups contain multiple breeding males, this behavior can occur without high paternity certainty ( Rosenbaum et al. 2015 , Stoinski et al. 2009 ). This suggests that males’ direct care is a form of mating effort, though it does not appear to be a strategy solely employed by low ranking males, unlike in some baboon species ( Huchard et al. 2013 ; direct care definition from Kleiman & Malcolm 1981 ). It is also strikingly consistent with the recent data from macaques showing that females prefer males who affiliate with infants (Haunhorst et al. 2019).
Data on interactions between wild adult male bonobos or western gorillas and young are scarce, but observations of captive animals suggest they are capable of regular, affiliative contact ( Boose et al. 2018 , Enciso et al. 1999 ). Perhaps most interesting of all, male orangutans are routinely successfully housed (and interact) with young in captivity (e.g., McUmber et al. 2016 , Zucker et al. 1978 ). The success of this practice is surprising because males of these nongregarious species rarely or never spend time with young in the wild and may be a threat to infants ( Scott et al. 2019 ).
This marked behavioral plasticity among male Old World primates challenges the notion that high paternity certainty, due to reliable discrimination mechanisms and/or monogamous mating, is a necessary prerequisite for at least rudimentary forms of paternal care to emerge. It also demonstrates the capacity of males to form affiliative, serial bonds with females as one component of mating effort ( Arseneau-Robar et al. 2018 , Haunhorst et al. 2016 , Städele et al. 2019 ). The behavior of male Old World primates suggests that under current socioecological conditions, more costly forms of care and cooperation leave caring males at a disadvantage relative to peers who invest more in mating effort. However, it also indicates that there are relevant, rudimentary behaviors in place on which selection could act. Given the right set of nudges to socioecological conditions, the threshold may be low enough for occasional low-cost behaviors to ratchet up to more costly forms through evolutionary time. Shifting conditions that could contribute to such a nudge include costs to male–male competition that meaningfully shorten male reproductive life spans, changes in population sex ratios that promote male care and/or female choice of caring males, and/or predation and infanticide pressures that motivate stronger female preference for caring males. These observations are consistent with existing theory and past work on this topic ( Alonzo 2010 , Fuentes 2000 , Gavrilets 2012 , Kokko & Jennions 2008 , Lukas & Clutton-Brock 2013 , Opie et al. 2013 ).
That pooling energetic resources played a critical role in the evolution of human life history is empirically supported and widely acknowledged ( Kaplan et al. 2000 ). Early models of the evolution of monogamy and biparental care among hominins focused on “food-for-mating” exchanges ( Lovejoy 1981 ). More recent models emphasize the importance of complementary subsistence and social roles. Among many contemporary forager societies, men's hunting is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that generates large, nutrient-dense, but often unpredictable food packets. Such specialization is generally possible only with the nutritional insurance that women's more-consistent foraging returns provide. Meanwhile, under subsistence foraging conditions, the energetic investment required to maintain stacked dependency periods of human children is possible only if foraging returns are supplemented with calorically dense animal resources. Evolutionary models relying on these data presume that males and females pooled the resources that these specialized tasks generate, requiring prolonged association. In these frameworks, such cooperative dynamics then help facilitate serial social monogamy and increased paternity certainty, generating partnerships that increase fitness for both parties relative to the alternative ( Gurven & Hill 2009 , Hill & Hurtado 2009 , Kaplan et al. 2000 , West & Capellini 2016 ).
However, the difficulty with models that rely on observations about the fitness advantages of a complex social dynamic is that the existence of such advantages is rarely sufficient to explain how they arose in the first place. As Ellison & Ottinger (2014) observed about the grandmother hypothesis, “It is one thing to posit a fitness advantage to the provisioning behavior of postreproductive females, for example, but that behavior cannot be used to explain the existence of postreproductive females capable of doing that provisioning” (p. 329; see also Hawkes & Coxworth 2013 ). We question whether the fitness advantages of male–female subsistence partnerships can be used to explain the initial emergence of such behavior during our evolutionary history (see also McKenna 1979 for discussion of “opportunism”). Food sharing is highly unusual among primates, including between adult males and females. Even in chimpanzee populations where males acquire a modest portion of their calories from hunted meat, they rarely share with females ( Jaeggi & Gurven 2013 ), raising questions about the potential for the spontaneous emergence of proactive meat sharing among early hominins.
The advantages of subsistence specialization (e.g., sexual divisions of labor) in contemporary human societies are highly reliant on modern technological and cultural-linguistic capacities, and the timing of their emergence in the evolutionary past remains unclear. As Marlowe laid out, “Specialization cannot go very far without a reliable trade partner, because targeting high-risk foods is not a viable strategy without someone else targeting more reliable foods and sharing them” ( Marlowe 2007 , p. 191). The collective action problem Marlowe highlights suggests that males and females must have considered one another reliable cooperative partners well before males began regularly specializing in time- and skill-intensive subsistence activities that they could not necessarily count on to meet their own day-to-day needs, let alone enhance their reproductive success.
So, what conditions facilitate the kinds of relationships that might eventually permit specialization? The nonhuman primate data suggest a combination of relevant behaviors—protecting against threats, facilitating resource access, enhancing social connectedness (i.e., via paternal kin), and direct caregiving (in modest amounts). These behaviors could have additively contributed to offspring survival and quality, yielding fitness benefits for hominin males who bonded with specific female(s) and who engaged at least occasionally with infants and juveniles. Though promiscuous mating systems have generally been considered incompatible with the cooperative caretaking that emerged during human evolution ( Winking & Koster 2015 ), macaque, baboon, and gorilla males’ behavior suggests that it is plausible that these forms of care could have been selected for among hominins in groups with promiscuous mating. The male–female friendships commonly observed in baboons make it clear that such mating structures do not necessarily preclude the development of stronger bonds between specific male–female pairs, perhaps coinciding with sexual preference, if not sexual exclusivity (see the sidebar titled Baboon Friendships).
One critical facilitator might be costs: Male gorillas’ direct caretaking appears to be virtually without cost, so if it carries even small fitness advantages, there would be little to impede its spread, particularly in small populations ( Rosenbaum et al. 2018 ). Low costs also help to relax assumptions about the need for precise paternal kin discrimination mechanisms. If there are few costs to accidentally caring for other males’ offspring, and any advantage at all to taking care of your own (or even others’, if females prefer caregiving males), then males should err on the side of providing care ( Alonzo 2012 , Rosenbaum et al. 2018 ). The gorilla, baboon, and macaque data are consistent with the idea that females may prefer, or even compete for, males who provide such care. This would likely be critical to the incremental evolution of more costly behaviors; indeed, female preference for caring males is commonly observed in taxa that have evolved paternal investment, and modeling work suggests that female preference can encourage male care even when paternity certainty is low ( Alonzo 2012 , Tallamy 2000 ). The emergence of social conditions—e.g., increased reliance on cooperation and prosociality, perhaps facilitated by the formation of female/matrilineal coalitions with changing natal dispersal patterns—could have increased females’ capacity to choose caring males. We argue that these suites of low-cost care behaviors could have ratcheted up through evolutionary time, perhaps laying the social foundations for the later emergence of more intensive, proactive food sharing and eventual subsistence specialization and resource pooling. However, based on the theoretical principles we discussed previously, the potential for this process to have occurred would be contingent on other socioecological conditions that reduce reproductive skew between males. In order for this set of behaviors to be selected for, males without an affiliative female partner would need to be better off pursuing such a partnership rather than solely engaging in intrasexual competition. That said, this condition is not unique to the evolutionary ratcheting argument; the same applies to scenarios in which males spontaneously pursued costly food sharing with females.
Compared with its expression in most other mammalian Orders, paternal care is more common among primates. However, this is primarily because such behavior is relatively prevalent among the New World monkeys, especially marmosets, tamarins, owl monkeys, and titi monkeys ( Fernandez-Duque et al. 2009 , Storey & Ziegler 2016 , Tardif & Bales 1997 ).

As Ellison & Ottinger (2014) observed about the grandmother hypothesis, “It is one thing to posit a fitness advantage to the provisioning behavior of postreproductive females, for example, but that behavior cannot be used to explain the existence of postreproductive females capable of doing that provisioning” (p. 329; see also Hawkes & Coxworth 2013 ). We question whether the fitness advantages of male–female subsistence partnerships can be used to explain the initial emergence of such behavior during our evolutionary history (see also McKenna 1979 for discussion of “opportunism”). Food sharing is highly unusual among primates, including between adult males and females. Even in chimpanzee populations where males acquire a modest portion of their calories from hunted meat, they rarely share with females ( Jaeggi & Gurven 2013 ), raising questions about the potential for the spontaneous emergence of proactive meat sharing among early hominins.
The advantages of subsistence specialization (e.g., sexual divisions of labor) in contemporary human societies are highly reliant on modern technological and cultural-linguistic capacities, and the timing of their emergence in the evolutionary past remains unclear. As Marlowe laid out, “Specialization cannot go very far without a reliable trade partner, because targeting high-risk foods is not a viable strategy without someone else targeting more reliable foods and sharing them” ( Marlowe 2007 , p. 191). The collective action problem Marlowe highlights suggests that males and females must have considered one another reliable cooperative partners well before males began regularly specializing in time- and skill-intensive subsistence activities that they could not necessarily count on to meet their own day-to-day needs, let alone enhance their reproductive success.
So, what conditions facilitate the kinds of relationships that might eventually permit specialization? The nonhuman primate data suggest a combination of relevant behaviors—protecting against threats, facilitating resource access, enhancing social connectedness (i.e., via paternal kin), and direct caregiving (in modest amounts). These behaviors could have additively contributed to offspring survival and quality, yielding fitness benefits for hominin males who bonded with specific female(s) and who engaged at least occasionally with infants and juveniles. Though promiscuous mating systems have generally been considered incompatible with the cooperative caretaking that emerged during human evolution ( Winking & Koster 2015 ), macaque, baboon, and gorilla males’ behavior suggests that it is plausible that these forms of care could have been selected for among hominins in groups with promiscuous mating. The male–female friendships commonly observed in baboons make it clear that such mating structures do not necessarily preclude the development of stronger bonds between specific male–female pairs, perhaps coinciding with sexual preference, if not sexual exclusivity (see the sidebar titled Baboon Friendships).
One critical facilitator might be costs: Male gorillas’ direct caretaking appears to be virtually without cost, so if it carries even small fitness advantages, there would be little to impede its spread, particularly in small populations ( Rosenbaum et al. 2018 ). Low costs also help to relax assumptions about the need for precise paternal kin discrimination mechanisms. If there are few costs to accidentally caring for other males’ offspring, and any advantage at all to taking care of your own (or even others’, if females prefer caregiving males), then males should err on the side of providing care ( Alonzo 2012 , Rosenbaum et al. 2018 ). The gorilla, baboon, and macaque data are consistent with the idea that females may prefer, or even compete for, males who provide such care. This would likely be critical to the incremental evolution of more costly behaviors; indeed, female preference for caring males is commonly observed in taxa that have evolved paternal investment, and modeling work suggests that female preference can encourage male care even when paternity certainty is low ( Alonzo 2012 , Tallamy 2000 ). The emergence of social conditions—e.g., increased reliance on cooperation and prosociality, perhaps facilitated by the formation of female/matrilineal coalitions with changing natal dispersal patterns—could have increased females’ capacity to choose caring males. We argue that these suites of low-cost care behaviors could have ratcheted up through evolutionary time, perhaps laying the social foundations for the later emergence of more intensive, proactive food sharing and eventual subsistence specialization and resource pooling. However, based on the theoretical principles we discussed previously, the potential for this process to have occurred would be contingent on other socioecological conditions that reduce reproductive skew between males. In order for this set of behaviors to be selected for, males without an affiliative female partner would need to be better off pursuing such a partnership rather than solely engaging in intrasexual competition. That said, this condition is not unique to the evolutionary ratcheting argument; the same applies to scenarios in which males spontaneously pursued costly food sharing with females.

Section: EXPANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT FATHERS’ CONTRIBUTIONS, PAST AND PRESENT

Comparative insights on the nonprovisioning roles that males may have played as caregivers in the evolutionary past also raise new questions and avenues for research about the flexibility of contemporary fathering within and across cultures. In this section, we prioritize anthropological work on fathers, which has historically placed particular emphasis on paternal effects on children in communities where foraging is a key aspect of their subsistence strategy. Studies of such societies are commonly used as lines of evidence in models of human evolution, given the importance and antiquity of foraging in the hominin lineage. This notion of evolutionary relevance, behaviorally and ecologically, is both widely employed and widely critiqued ( Bodley 1999 , Ember 1978 , Marlowe 2007 ). Those debates are beyond the scope of this article. However, given the current state of the anthropological literature, our review disproportionately focuses on subsistence-level societal contexts, which often have ecological features (e.g., energetic constraints, infectious disease stress) that are shared widely across global populations. Nonetheless, we propose insights that we argue extend to other settings, such as the United States, in which children's health and development are often more strongly shaped by other environmental and social determinants, such as energy overabundance and structural inequality.
However, we briefly explore first the more widely studied intersection between men's hunting/provisioning, reproductive success, and child outcomes, which is often emphasized in evolutionarily oriented human research. In multiple societies where people routinely forage for subsistence, men acquire excess energetic resources (particularly protein) over their lifetimes and contribute that excess to pooled community energy budgets. Many scholars have argued that these contributions are imperative to contemporary foragers’ ability to sustain the human life history strategy of stacking costly dependents and, by extension, that this also would have been necessary to support such a life history strategy in the evolutionary past ( Hill & Hurtado 2009 , Kaplan et al. 2000 ). Moreover, in some foraging communities, more successful hunters have more children and their children survive at higher rates, compared with children of less effective hunters ( Smith 2004 , von Rueden et al. 2011 , von Rueden & Jaeggi 2016 ; cf. Blurton Jones 2016 for offspring survival). These benefits may accrue through a variety of pathways but are thought to emerge because good hunters typically gain status benefits, and in some (even most) settings, families benefit energetically when fathers are better hunters ( Gurven & Hill 2009 , von Rueden et al. 2011 , von Rueden & Jaeggi 2016 , Wood & Marlowe 2013 ).
Yet in a well-known and somewhat countervailing study of natural fertility populations, Sear & Mace (2008) found that fathers’ presence was correlated with improved child survival rates in only 32% of societies surveyed; in contrast, maternal grandmothers’ presence was linked to greater grandchild survival in 69% of societies. In foraging societies specifically, there is also mixed evidence for a father-presence effect on child survival ( Blurton Jones 2016 , Hurtado & Hill 1992 , Winking & Gurven 2011 ). Beyond the data on mortality, there is less research on fathers’ contributions to child health measures, such as morbidity, energetic condition, and growth among foraging communities ( Winking & Koster 2015 ). The few relevant studies have not found that fathers’ presence and provisioning were linked to improved child energetic outcomes ( Boyette et al. 2019 , Hames et al. 2005 , Meehan et al. 2014 ; cf. Blurton Jones 2016 for modest effects). The egalitarianism and cooperation of many foraging communities, which extends to child care, likely account for the relatively minimal paternal effects on child survival and growth, as fathers’ contributions are largely substitutable by other caregivers ( Boyette et al. 2019 , Hill & Hurtado 2009 , Meehan et al. 2014 , Sear & Mace 2008 ).
Men's reproductive skew can potentially reconcile these two apparently conflicting sets of findings. Blurton Jones (2016) has argued that small percentages of men in forager communities are likely to be considered excellent hunters. Thus, a relatively small proportion of these men may accrue the fitness benefits of outsized hunting abilities/reputations, leading to variance in reproductive success ( Blurton Jones 2016 ). Meanwhile, the majority of men contribute resources to family and community energy budgets ( Gurven & Hill 2009 , Hill & Hurtado 2009 ). The egalitarian sharing of these resources helps mitigate what might otherwise be stark contrasts between men for their children's outcomes.
Variance in reproductive success for both men and women in foraging societies is also small compared with the variance in societies practicing horticulture, pastoralism, and agriculture ( Betzig 2012 ). Without inherited wealth that perpetuates inequality ( Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009 ), nonprovisioning care behaviors could be leveling mechanisms that help reduce variance in men's reproductive success in some foraging communities. These could be alternative pathways to enhanced child survival or quality of children's outcomes, such as variation in their physical/mental health, social behavior and opportunities, and acquired skills and knowledge ( Boyette et al. 2018a , b ; Gray & Anderson 2010 ). Here we explore direct caregiving, teaching, cultivating of social capital, and reducing family conflict as domains that are currently understudied in anthropological research on fathers’ effects on children ( Boyette et al. 2018a , b ; Gettler 2010 , 2016 ; Gray & Anderson 2010 ; Scelza 2010 ; von Rueden et al. 2011 ; Winking & Koster 2015 ). In societies with greater inequality, these alternative pathways may play a smaller role than do family resources and the local physical ecology (e.g., water sanitation, exposure to pathogens, safety of the lived environment). Yet human infants and children are highly attuned to the psychosocial qualities of their caregiving environments ( Flinn et al. 2011 , Flinn & Leone 2006 , Worthman 2010 ). Using evolutionary and biocultural approaches to expand the range of questions we ask about the roles and effects of caregivers, including fathers, we can harness strengths of our discipline to improve our understanding of the social and environmental determinants of variation in child health and development (e.g., Boyette et al. 2019 , Flinn & Leone 2006 , Meehan et al. 2014 , Nelson 2016 , Rosenbaum & Gettler 2018b , Sear & Mace 2008 , Winking & Koster 2015 ).
Fathers’ direct care could positively influence child outcomes through a number of pathways ( Gettler 2010 , Hewlett 1993 ), but such pathways have received little attention in the anthropological literature ( Boyette et al. 2018a , Mattison et al. 2014 , Winking & Koster 2015 ). This lack of research may be due in part to the prominence of theoretical frameworks, such as life history theory, that tend to conceptualize time and energy allocated to specific tasks as indicators of their importance (e.g., Hill & Kaplan 1999 ; Gettler 2010 , 2014 ; Kaplan et al. 2000 ; Kramer 2010 ). For example, in foraging societies men spend little of their daytime holding infants and toddlers ( Fouts 2008 ), especially compared with time spent by mothers. This pattern is frequently used as an argument against the evolutionary salience of men's direct interaction with children.
Yet in many societies that practice foraging, men spend a meaningful proportion of in-camp time in close proximity to and interacting with children, compared with men in comparably sized societies with other subsistence regimes ( Marlowe 2000 ). As shown in data from focal-child follows, Hadza children interacted with their fathers in ∼16–17% of the observations, a percentage that is higher than for any other single caregiver except mothers ( Marlowe 2005 ). In Aka and Bofi communities, fathers were in proximity to children for broadly similar percentages of the day, on average ( Fouts 2008 , Hewlett 1993 ). Hiwi fathers were their children's primary caregivers during 30% of mothers’ foraging outings and were qualitatively described as spending substantial time with older children ( Hurtado et al. 1992 ). Although these patterns are not ubiquitous (e.g., Winking et al. 2009 ; Hurtado et al. 1992 for Ache data), these are not trivial quantities of time for either men or children.
We know very little, however, about the content of fathers’ interactions with children. The nature of these interactions is potentially critical to any effects on children's development. Fields focusing explicitly on human development put much stronger emphasis on modeling the quality of interactions, rather than solely emphasizing the quantity, as a contributor to children's behavioral, emotional, and cognitive development (e.g., Cabrera 2020 , Pleck 2010 ). The overwhelming majority of such research has come from the United States, Europe, and similar contexts in which there are often strong cultural values and institutions that centralize the nuclear family as the primary caregiving unit ( Sear 2016 ). A review of that literature is well beyond our scope here, but we argue that there are translatable insights that merit emphasis.
For example, some studies show that fathers play less with children than mothers do in the United States and similar settings ( Yeung et al. 2001 ). Yet the particular qualities of how fathers play (e.g., often in a rough-and-tumble fashion) have been linked to child outcomes ( Flanders et al. 2010 , Fletcher et al. 2013 ). For example, Canadian fathers who exercised less control and boundary setting during rough-and-tumble play with preschoolers had children who were more physically aggressive and had poorer emotional regulation years later as compared with children of fathers who exercised more control ( Flanders et al. 2010 ). Similarly, in a study of German families, children had better social functioning at ages 10 and 16 if their fathers engaged in sensitive but challenging play when they were toddlers; this pattern was not observed for mothers ( Grossmann et al. 2002 ).
In two-parent heterosexual families in the United States, fathers have been studied for their unique effects on children's language development, despite typically spending far less time verbally interacting with children than mothers do ( Varghese & Wachen 2016 ). Fathers have been found to use more challenging language with young children than mothers do, including greater vocabulary diversity, more complex sentence structures, and more “Wh-” questions (who, what, where, when, why) in some US families ( Leech et al. 2013 , Pancsofar & Vernon-Feagans 2006 ). These practices enhance language development and cognitive function, which could be linked to improved academic and social outcomes, and potentially even to later economic success ( Varghese & Wachen 2016 ). This type of research underscores that in key domains, the content and quality of father–child interactions can affect child outcomes at relatively low thresholds of interaction frequency. These studies also illustrate that fathers, like other caregivers, vary in the quality of their engagement, which is rarely a focus of research in anthropology.
In particular, teaching is an understudied domain in which fathers’ roles and the quality of their interactions may matter a great deal in a range of contexts. Our species is, obviously, exceptionally reliant on socially learned culture ( Boyd et al. 2011 ). Teaching, as a class of social learning processes, is critical for acquiring the more opaque, sometimes arbitrary aspects of human cumulative culture ( Kline 2015 ; see the sidebar titled Teaching). Parents are likely critical to children's cultural learning generally, including via teaching, because they are typically proximate, trustworthy, and important role models and social bonding figures ( Hewlett et al. 2011 ). For instance, an observational study of infant-directed teaching among Aka forager infants showed that mothers were primary teachers, contributing 59% of all teaching. However, fathers taught nearly as much as all other adults combined (12% versus 15%, respectively; Hewlett & Roulette 2016 ). This predominance of vertical transmission seems to decrease after early childhood across subsistence-level ( Garfield et al. 2016 , Kline et al. 2013 , Reyes-García et al. 2016 ) and postindustrial state societies (e.g., Berndt 1979 , Ruggeri et al. 2018 ; vertical transmission definition from Hewlett et al. 2011 ). Concordantly, Boyette & Hewlett (2017) observed that Aka 5–14-year-old children received less teaching overall and half as much from their fathers than did infants (6%). Yet relative to their availability, fathers taught twice as often as all other adults except mothers (A.H. Boyette, unpublished information).
TEACHING
Teaching is a social learning process by which an individual modifies her/his behavior in the presence of a learner to increase the probability that the learner acquires information more easily than without teaching or accesses information that would otherwise be inaccessible by individual, trial-and-error learning ( Boyette & Hewlett 2017 ). Teaching is a cooperative behavior because the teacher pays a cost (e.g., time, effort, opportunity cost) to provide a benefit to the learner. Theoretically, for teaching to evolve, the benefits that teachers gain through the enhanced fitness of learners must outweigh the costs. Indeed, teaching is found most commonly among cooperative breeding species, where there is a concentration of close kin and caregivers who can benefit from hastening independence of the young (e.g., by teaching foraging skills). Mothers are by far the most common teachers in noncooperative breeders. In humans, the unique combination of mother–father partnering, sexual division of labor, and dependence on culture all contribute to a cost–benefit structure that could have opened up fathers to selection for a tendency to teach. The evolutionary dynamics between reproductive cooperation and teaching in human evolution needs further theoretical and empirical research.

Moreover, we stress that the content and quality of father–child teaching may be more important than the quantity. In the context of a sexual division of labor, fathers typically have skills and knowledge complementary to those of mothers that children, perhaps especially boys, gain from men's teaching across a variety of domains. For example, among Aka communities, sharing is a core social value, and fathers were the second most commonly reported teacher of sharing norms according to Aka boys in middle childhood ( Boyette 2019 ). For foragers in general, fathers may emphasize preparing their children for independent contributions to subsistence needs by teaching them about where and how to locate environmental resources ( Boyette et al. 2018b , Garfield et al. 2016 ), a practice that yields the proximate benefit of help from their children while they learn (A.H. Boyette & S. Lew-Levy, manuscript under review). In contrast, among Congolese Bondongo fisher-farmers, fathers emphasized the importance of teaching social etiquette to their children ( Boyette et al. 2018b ). Across domains, fathers likely gain fitness benefits by furthering their children's cultural education, meriting further research scrutiny (see the sidebar titled Teaching).
Along these lines, Congolese BaYaka forager fathers who were ranked by their peers as better teachers to their children had a greater number of offspring as compared to fathers who were ranked lower (A.H. Boyette, S. Lew-Levy, and L.T. Gettler, unpublished information). However, those seen as better fathers in multiple culturally valued domains, including teaching, did not have children who were in better energetic condition. Thus, the link between teaching and reproductive success likely occurs through another pathway in this group ( Boyette et al. 2019 ; A.H. Boyette, S. Lew-Levy, and L.T. Gettler, unpublished information). In contrast, among neighboring Bondongo fisher-farmers, fathers who were seen as better direct caregivers had children with healthier indicators of growth and energetic condition. In this community, men's direct caregiving was more robustly linked to children's health than was provisioning, despite the latter being comparatively more culturally valued ( Boyette et al. 2018a ). In complementary findings from Mayangna/Miskito horticulturalists of Nicaragua, fathers who were ranked as more invested in their families, through both wealth and direct care, tended to have children who were in better energetic condition, although wealth was more strongly linked to child outcomes ( Winking & Koster 2015 ). Overall, the evidence increasingly suggests that fathers’ direct care, including through teaching, can affect children's physical, socioemotional, and cultural development through context-specific pathways.
Another pathway through which fathers might aid the development, health, and survival of their children is through the cultivation of social capital ( Bourdieu 1986 , p. 248; Gettler 2016 ; Scelza 2010 ; von Rueden et al. 2011 ). In one of the few tests of this idea, Scelza (2010) showed that among the Martu in Australia, adolescent boys with a father present went through adult-initiation rites at earlier ages, which sped up their reproductive careers and led to enhanced reproductive success (see also Mattison et al. 2014 ). Scelza proposed that boys’ fathers were likely able to advocate on behalf of their sons to community elders and that elders might avoid disrespecting invested fathers, who would typically also be active community members ( Scelza 2010 ).
Other research points to the ways in which social capital interrelates with men's social status and reputations to affect child outcomes. In the Peruvian highlands, household heads who were seen as contributing the most to collective action projects had reputations as being influential and respected within the community. Those with greater reputations had more social support partners, which, in turn, was linked to lower levels of household illness ( Lyle & Smith 2014 ). Meanwhile, among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in Bolivia, men who earned status by conveying benefits to others (prestige) had greater fertility, and their children survived at higher rates compared with lower-status men ( von Rueden et al. 2011 ). Notably, higher-status Tsimane men did not have more food-sharing partners or receive more food from others, nor did they have wives who produced more food. Rather, their social status correlated with greater social capital, including political allies and labor partners, and they received greater deference in community disputes ( von Rueden et al. 2011 ).
Among BaYaka families, fathers who were ranked as more generous sharers within the community had more offspring, and their children had lower physiological indicators of psychosocial stress (A.H. Boyette, S. Lew-Levy, and L.T. Gettler, unpublished information; L.T. Gettler et al., manuscript under review). Because BaYaka fathers’ quality rankings, including for sharing, were not linked to child growth/energetics, it seems likely that correlations between men's egalitarian reputations and their children's outcomes emerged through mechanisms that were independent of energetic status ( Boyette et al. 2019 ). Perhaps through such generosity, individuals generate and become enmeshed in social networks that benefit their families through nonenergetic mechanisms. Recent research from two geographically distant foraging societies, the BaYaka and the Agta (Philippines), found that mothers who were more indirectly centrally located (i.e., being closely connected to other well-connected individuals) within community social networks had more living children ( Page et al. 2017 ). The authors suggested that the benefits to this network location may lie in access to various social, political, informational, and physical resources ( Page et al. 2017 ). In sum, family social capital generally, and fathers’ social capital specifically, may benefit children's health, psychosocial development, and social opportunities and may be a heritable resource that benefits them into adulthood in some settings ( Chaudhary et al. 2016 , Smith et al. 2010 ). We need further research on how these benefits potentially accrue.
The influences of parental conflict and divorce on child social development, physiological function, and health have been widely studied in US and European contexts ( Amato 2001 , Harold & Sellers 2018 ). In these settings, cultural value has long been placed on marital stability and the centrality of the nuclear family, owing in part to the influence of political economic factors and Christian religious traditions ( Chiappori et al. 2002 , Schulz et al. 2019 ). These cultural dynamics may shape how conflict between parents affects children's health and development (e.g., by prolonging their exposure to conflict or reducing the availability of other caregivers to buffer children from such disputes). Much less is known about the effects of parental conflict on children in societies where divorce is less stigmatized. For example, under more divorce-permissive circumstances, children may experience relatively briefer exposure to the strain and stress of parental fighting ( Morrison & Coiro 1999 ).
However, divorce often entails children's separation from one of their parents, frequently the father, though this practice is far from ubiquitous cross-culturally ( Anderson 2011 ). Such separation could negatively affect children if it leads to diminished resources or additional psychosocial stress, which could manifest because of parental absence or because separation leads to exposure to poorer-quality care (e.g., from stepfathers in some contexts) ( Amato & Sobolewski 2004 , Anderson et al. 1999 , Flinn & England 1995 , Flinn & Leone 2006 ). Thus, in settings where one or both of these outcomes occur, fathers may be able to enhance the well-being of their children by maintaining cooperative and supportive relationships with their children's mothers. Such parental social dynamics contribute to more cohesive family environments and presumably generally extend the duration of parental relationships. This notion complements evolutionary framing that proposes that longer male–female bonds, leading to more shared genetic offspring, reduce parental conflict over resources and enhance cooperative efficiency ( Kaplan & Lancaster 2003 ).
Among Bondongo fisher-farmers, fathers who were viewed as having less conflict with their wives had children with lower physiological indicators of psychosocial stress ( Boyette et al. 2018a ). Bondongo children in families with less parental disputing also tended to have reduced epigenetic age acceleration, an indicator of biological aging that correlates with morbidity and mortality risk in adults ( Gettler et al. 2020 ). Among neighboring BaYaka foragers, children also had lower physiological indicators of psychosocial stress if their parents were seen as having less conflict (L.T. Gettler et al., manuscript under review). These two societies have differing norms around many aspects of family life. BaYaka communities are more egalitarian and disapprove of conflict between wives and husbands, whereas Bondongo communities are more hierarchical and view disputes as part of normal marital relations ( Boyette et al. 2018a , 2019 ). Yet in both communities, verbal and (occasional) physical aggression between spouses does occur, and individuals often divorce and remarry multiple times. Still, because of shared caregiving norms among BaYaka communities, one would predict that BaYaka children might have more alloparental caregivers to help buffer them from these effects compared to Bondongo children. Nonetheless, children show broadly similar physiological profiles associated with family conflict in the two communities. It is possible that BaYaka families with more conflict may have fewer alloparents available to mitigate the effects on children relative to more harmonious families in their community. Alternatively, research has shown that BaYaka children form close emotional bonds with both parents, and they experience the prospect of losing one of them (e.g., to divorce) as socially threatening and challenging, despite receiving care from others ( Hewlett 2005 ; S. Lew-Levy, unpublished information).
In related long-term research among rural Dominican communities, children had elevated cortisol during adverse family events, including parental absence, residence change, or unstable caregiving ( Flinn & England 1995 , Flinn & Leone 2006 ). However, children with grandmothers available to care for them were more buffered from these physiological patterns and had lower morbidity, better growth, and fewer behavioral problems ( Flinn & Leone 2006 ). Thus, these patterns potentially diverge from those described above for BaYaka children. These results and others ( Nelson 2016 , Stieglitz et al. 2018 ) hint that fathers’ psychosocial effects on family systems are likely to vary with a constellation of cultural factors, including marriage norms, residence patterns, kinship networks, and cooperative care. These are foundational areas in anthropological inquiry, yet there remains much unrealized potential for our field to apply these insights to questions of child health and development.
Fathers’ direct care could positively influence child outcomes through a number of pathways ( Gettler 2010 , Hewlett 1993 ), but such pathways have received little attention in the anthropological literature ( Boyette et al. 2018a , Mattison et al. 2014 , Winking & Koster 2015 ).

This predominance of vertical transmission seems to decrease after early childhood across subsistence-level ( Garfield et al. 2016 , Kline et al. 2013 , Reyes-García et al. 2016 ) and postindustrial state societies (e.g., Berndt 1979 , Ruggeri et al. 2018 ; vertical transmission definition from Hewlett et al. 2011 ). Concordantly, Boyette & Hewlett (2017) observed that Aka 5–14-year-old children received less teaching overall and half as much from their fathers than did infants (6%). Yet relative to their availability, fathers taught twice as often as all other adults except mothers (A.H. Boyette, unpublished information).
TEACHING
Teaching is a social learning process by which an individual modifies her/his behavior in the presence of a learner to increase the probability that the learner acquires information more easily than without teaching or accesses information that would otherwise be inaccessible by individual, trial-and-error learning ( Boyette & Hewlett 2017 ). Teaching is a cooperative behavior because the teacher pays a cost (e.g., time, effort, opportunity cost) to provide a benefit to the learner. Theoretically, for teaching to evolve, the benefits that teachers gain through the enhanced fitness of learners must outweigh the costs. Indeed, teaching is found most commonly among cooperative breeding species, where there is a concentration of close kin and caregivers who can benefit from hastening independence of the young (e.g., by teaching foraging skills). Mothers are by far the most common teachers in noncooperative breeders. In humans, the unique combination of mother–father partnering, sexual division of labor, and dependence on culture all contribute to a cost–benefit structure that could have opened up fathers to selection for a tendency to teach. The evolutionary dynamics between reproductive cooperation and teaching in human evolution needs further theoretical and empirical research.

Moreover, we stress that the content and quality of father–child teaching may be more important than the quantity. In the context of a sexual division of labor, fathers typically have skills and knowledge complementary to those of mothers that children, perhaps especially boys, gain from men's teaching across a variety of domains. For example, among Aka communities, sharing is a core social value, and fathers were the second most commonly reported teacher of sharing norms according to Aka boys in middle childhood ( Boyette 2019 ). For foragers in general, fathers may emphasize preparing their children for independent contributions to subsistence needs by teaching them about where and how to locate environmental resources ( Boyette et al. 2018b , Garfield et al. 2016 ), a practice that yields the proximate benefit of help from their children while they learn (A.H. Boyette & S. Lew-Levy, manuscript under review). In contrast, among Congolese Bondongo fisher-farmers, fathers emphasized the importance of teaching social etiquette to their children ( Boyette et al. 2018b ). Across domains, fathers likely gain fitness benefits by furthering their children's cultural education, meriting further research scrutiny (see the sidebar titled Teaching).
Along these lines, Congolese BaYaka forager fathers who were ranked by their peers as better teachers to their children had a greater number of offspring as compared to fathers who were ranked lower (A.H. Boyette, S. Lew-Levy, and L.T. Gettler, unpublished information). However, those seen as better fathers in multiple culturally valued domains, including teaching, did not have children who were in better energetic condition. Thus, the link between teaching and reproductive success likely occurs through another pathway in this group ( Boyette et al. 2019 ; A.H. Boyette, S. Lew-Levy, and L.T. Gettler, unpublished information). In contrast, among neighboring Bondongo fisher-farmers, fathers who were seen as better direct caregivers had children with healthier indicators of growth and energetic condition. In this community, men's direct caregiving was more robustly linked to children's health than was provisioning, despite the latter being comparatively more culturally valued ( Boyette et al. 2018a ). In complementary findings from Mayangna/Miskito horticulturalists of Nicaragua, fathers who were ranked as more invested in their families, through both wealth and direct care, tended to have children who were in better energetic condition, although wealth was more strongly linked to child outcomes ( Winking & Koster 2015 ). Overall, the evidence increasingly suggests that fathers’ direct care, including through teaching, can affect children's physical, socioemotional, and cultural development through context-specific pathways.
Another pathway through which fathers might aid the development, health, and survival of their children is through the cultivation of social capital ( Bourdieu 1986 , p. 248; Gettler 2016 ; Scelza 2010 ; von Rueden et al. 2011 ). In one of the few tests of this idea, Scelza (2010) showed that among the Martu in Australia, adolescent boys with a father present went through adult-initiation rites at earlier ages, which sped up their reproductive careers and led to enhanced reproductive success (see also Mattison et al. 2014 ). Scelza proposed that boys’ fathers were likely able to advocate on behalf of their sons to community elders and that elders might avoid disrespecting invested fathers, who would typically also be active community members ( Scelza 2010 ).
Other research points to the ways in which social capital interrelates with men's social status and reputations to affect child outcomes. In the Peruvian highlands, household heads who were seen as contributing the most to collective action projects had reputations as being influential and respected within the community. Those with greater reputations had more social support partners, which, in turn, was linked to lower levels of household illness ( Lyle & Smith 2014 ). Meanwhile, among Tsimane forager-horticulturalists in Bolivia, men who earned status by conveying benefits to others (prestige) had greater fertility, and their children survived at higher rates compared with lower-status men ( von Rueden et al. 2011 ). Notably, higher-status Tsimane men did not have more food-sharing partners or receive more food from others, nor did they have wives who produced more food. Rather, their social status correlated with greater social capital, including political allies and labor partners, and they received greater deference in community disputes ( von Rueden et al. 2011 ).
Among BaYaka families, fathers who were ranked as more generous sharers within the community had more offspring, and their children had lower physiological indicators of psychosocial stress (A.H. Boyette, S. Lew-Levy, and L.T. Gettler, unpublished information; L.T. Gettler et al., manuscript under review). Because BaYaka fathers’ quality rankings, including for sharing, were not linked to child growth/energetics, it seems likely that correlations between men's egalitarian reputations and their children's outcomes emerged through mechanisms that were independent of energetic status ( Boyette et al. 2019 ). Perhaps through such generosity, individuals generate and become enmeshed in social networks that benefit their families through nonenergetic mechanisms. Recent research from two geographically distant foraging societies, the BaYaka and the Agta (Philippines), found that mothers who were more indirectly centrally located (i.e., being closely connected to other well-connected individuals) within community social networks had more living children ( Page et al. 2017 ). The authors suggested that the benefits to this network location may lie in access to various social, political, informational, and physical resources ( Page et al. 2017 ). In sum, family social capital generally, and fathers’ social capital specifically, may benefit children's health, psychosocial development, and social opportunities and may be a heritable resource that benefits them into adulthood in some settings ( Chaudhary et al. 2016 , Smith et al. 2010 ). We need further research on how these benefits potentially accrue.
The influences of parental conflict and divorce on child social development, physiological function, and health have been widely studied in US and European contexts ( Amato 2001 , Harold & Sellers 2018 ). In these settings, cultural value has long been placed on marital stability and the centrality of the nuclear family, owing in part to the influence of political economic factors and Christian religious traditions ( Chiappori et al. 2002 , Schulz et al. 2019 ). These cultural dynamics may shape how conflict between parents affects children's health and development (e.g., by prolonging their exposure to conflict or reducing the availability of other caregivers to buffer children from such disputes). Much less is known about the effects of parental conflict on children in societies where divorce is less stigmatized. For example, under more divorce-permissive circumstances, children may experience relatively briefer exposure to the strain and stress of parental fighting ( Morrison & Coiro 1999 ).
However, divorce often entails children's separation from one of their parents, frequently the father, though this practice is far from ubiquitous cross-culturally ( Anderson 2011 ). Such separation could negatively affect children if it leads to diminished resources or additional psychosocial stress, which could manifest because of parental absence or because separation leads to exposure to poorer-quality care (e.g., from stepfathers in some contexts) ( Amato & Sobolewski 2004 , Anderson et al. 1999 , Flinn & England 1995 , Flinn & Leone 2006 ). Thus, in settings where one or both of these outcomes occur, fathers may be able to enhance the well-being of their children by maintaining cooperative and supportive relationships with their children's mothers. Such parental social dynamics contribute to more cohesive family environments and presumably generally extend the duration of parental relationships. This notion complements evolutionary framing that proposes that longer male–female bonds, leading to more shared genetic offspring, reduce parental conflict over resources and enhance cooperative efficiency ( Kaplan & Lancaster 2003 ).
Among Bondongo fisher-farmers, fathers who were viewed as having less conflict with their wives had children with lower physiological indicators of psychosocial stress ( Boyette et al. 2018a ). Bondongo children in families with less parental disputing also tended to have reduced epigenetic age acceleration, an indicator of biological aging that correlates with morbidity and mortality risk in adults ( Gettler et al. 2020 ). Among neighboring BaYaka foragers, children also had lower physiological indicators of psychosocial stress if their parents were seen as having less conflict (L.T. Gettler et al., manuscript under review). These two societies have differing norms around many aspects of family life. BaYaka communities are more egalitarian and disapprove of conflict between wives and husbands, whereas Bondongo communities are more hierarchical and view disputes as part of normal marital relations ( Boyette et al. 2018a , 2019 ). Yet in both communities, verbal and (occasional) physical aggression between spouses does occur, and individuals often divorce and remarry multiple times. Still, because of shared caregiving norms among BaYaka communities, one would predict that BaYaka children might have more alloparental caregivers to help buffer them from these effects compared to Bondongo children. Nonetheless, children show broadly similar physiological profiles associated with family conflict in the two communities. It is possible that BaYaka families with more conflict may have fewer alloparents available to mitigate the effects on children relative to more harmonious families in their community. Alternatively, research has shown that BaYaka children form close emotional bonds with both parents, and they experience the prospect of losing one of them (e.g., to divorce) as socially threatening and challenging, despite receiving care from others ( Hewlett 2005 ; S. Lew-Levy, unpublished information).
In related long-term research among rural Dominican communities, children had elevated cortisol during adverse family events, including parental absence, residence change, or unstable caregiving ( Flinn & England 1995 , Flinn & Leone 2006 ). However, children with grandmothers available to care for them were more buffered from these physiological patterns and had lower morbidity, better growth, and fewer behavioral problems ( Flinn & Leone 2006 ). Thus, these patterns potentially diverge from those described above for BaYaka children. These results and others ( Nelson 2016 , Stieglitz et al. 2018 ) hint that fathers’ psychosocial effects on family systems are likely to vary with a constellation of cultural factors, including marriage norms, residence patterns, kinship networks, and cooperative care. These are foundational areas in anthropological inquiry, yet there remains much unrealized potential for our field to apply these insights to questions of child health and development.

Section: FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND BROADER CONVERSATIONS

We have drawn on both cross-species and cross-cultural comparative evidence to argue for stronger consideration of nonprovisioning forms of male care as potentially important to the evolutionary origins of more costly paternal care and investment in the human lineage. Because biological anthropology focuses on questions of human origins, including ultimate explanations for human biology and behavior, our field's long-standing evolutionary perspectives on paternal care (i.e., provisioning) have helped funnel the limited breadth of anthropological research on the effects of fathers in families. Anthropologists are well positioned to contribute new knowledge to interdisciplinary conversations about the physical and social determinants of children's health and development across societies and ecologies. For fathering specifically, this additional research is particularly critical. Interventions aimed toward shifting men's roles increasingly expand to new global settings, with uneven attention paid to cultural variation in family systems and the pathways through which caregivers affect child outcomes ( Levtov et al. 2015 , Panter-Brick et al. 2014 ).
