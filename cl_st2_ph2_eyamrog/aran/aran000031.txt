Early in his engaging and thought-provoking perspectives article, Renato Rosaldo points to “learning el trato , how to treat other guys and girls,” as central to his adolescent—and subsequent—friendships. The term can more broadly mean an agreement or treaty, but in Rosaldo's account it really captures a kind of social contract, enacted interactionally, rarely overtly discussed but learned through attentive participation in social life. One group's trato may, further, be quite different from the interactional practices of another. Rosaldo illustrates this variation through contrasting the Anglo style of leaving a party (slipping away quietly) with that characteristic of Mexican American partygoers in his youth (saying farewell to each individual person), unspoken but socially resonant practices. Rosaldo foregrounds his developing understanding of el trato as an example of how he did “fieldwork without knowing it” from early on, tellingly from “the time [he] began to speak.” In his article, language, culture, history, and a core sense of identity are deeply entangled—and required his always active attention and reflection, in short his ongoing engagement as an ethnographer. His remarkable skills and insights as an anthropologist were built, he suggests, on the quotidian manner in which he learned his way into social life and into his own identity as Mexican American.
Rosaldo's perspectives article illuminates the interplay of language with his growing sense of self and identity and points to a broader social semiotic, one in which form and style play key roles. His commitment to taking linguistic form seriously is evident in the poems and prose poems he has published in recent years, works that at the same time afford him greater freedom of expression and demand “the standards of accuracy and accountability that ethnography demanded of the social world depicted in the poems.”
Rosaldo's article both charts his personal, ethnographically illuminated Bildungsroman and explores the transformation of social anthropology across his career. He foregrounds especially the necessary and generative engagement of anthropological work with historical and literary analyses, the ongoing negotiation of and struggle over cultural citizenship, and the value of experimenting with styles of ethnographic representation.
Many of the reviews in this volume, ranging from the political economy of attention to linguistic anthropological explorations of conversational analysis, touch and interaction, and pidgins and creoles, resonate strongly with themes running through Rosaldo's reflections. Semiotic analysis figures centrally in several articles, including those on Peirce and archaeology, language and the military, and postcolonial semiotics. Questions of style and sensory practice are focal in such reviews as “Music, Language, and Aurality,” while those of ethnographic relevance feature in historical representations of primates.
This year we say farewell with many thanks to two Editorial Committee Members, Bambi Schieffelin and Jason Yaeger, and welcome Graham Jones and Eduardo Góes Neves to our conversations. We want to thank Jen Mann, who is at the heart of the Annual Review of Anthropology and whose intelligence, attentiveness, tact, and good humor are indispensable elements of our collective work.
