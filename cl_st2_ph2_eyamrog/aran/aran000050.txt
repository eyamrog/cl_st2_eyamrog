Title: The Political Economy of Attention


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

Attention has become an issue of intense political, economic, and moral concern over recent years: from the commodification of attention by digital platforms to the alleged loss of the attentional capacities of screen-addicted children (and their parents). While attention has rarely been an explicit focus of anthropological inquiry, it has still played an important if mostly tacit part in many anthropological debates and subfields. Focusing on anthropological scholarship on digital worlds and ritual forms, we review resources for colleagues interested in this burgeoning topic of research and identify potential avenues for an incipient anthropology of attention, which studies how attentional technologies and techniques mold human minds and bodies in more or less intentional ways.

Section: INTRODUCTION

“Exhaustion of attention is a new subtler form of torture,” Gabriel Tarde (1902) once wrote. This observation is as relevant as ever. Indeed, the growing pressure that human attention allegedly faces in the digital age has become a prominent source of moral anxiety and cultural imagination in the twenty-first century—an issue around which ethical, political, and economic discourses and practices congeal. While a concern with the limits and use of human attention is arguably a notable feature of modernity per se (cf. Crary 2001 ), recent years have seen a dramatic rise in its public salience. The popularity of Shoshanna Zuboff's (2019) book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power is exemplary, as is the popularity of other works on advertising as “attention theft” ( Wu 2017 ) and persuasive design as “attentional serfdom” ( Williams 2018 ). Attention is also increasingly becoming an arena for social activism. The Center for Humane Technology (CHT), originating in Silicon Valley, suggests that the aggressive use of persuasive design in digital technologies is responsible for a range of problems, including “shortening of attention spans, polarization, outrage-ification of culture, mass narcissism, election engineering, [and] addiction to technology” ( Lerman 2019 ). As such, CHT suggests that this “digital attention crisis” is the “cultural equivalent of climate change” ( Harris & Raskin 2019 ).
In spite of—or perhaps even because of—this increased popular concern with attention, some researchers, especially psychologists, have lamented that the scientific literature on attention “is still in its nascent stages” ( Wilmer et al. 2017 , p. 2) or even that “there is no such thing as attention” ( Anderson 2011 ). Indeed, for many psychologists and philosophers, attention is an inherently elusive subject. Attention means different things in different contexts, appearing at times synonymous with willpower, perception, valorization, or care. Yet, what figures as a problem for behavioral psychologists and economists may be fruitful for anthropologists: The very fact that attention is slippery, a topic of widespread cultural concern, makes it ripe for critical ethnographic scrutiny. Bracketing the thorny question of what attention is as a matter of fact , we are interested in how attention has emerged as a matter of concern in Latour's (2004) sense: as a phenomenon or an artifact of contemporary economic culture ascribed great importance across many scales at once. Attention is ubiquitous and variable, appearing in an ever-growing range of contexts. As the floating signifier of the digital age par excellence, it seems that there is no popular issue that can avoid being framed in attentional terms. 1 This state of affairs demands anthropological investigation.

Section: THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF ATTENTION

While attention has been studied by philosophers at least since Descartes and Locke, contemporary discussions often depart from William James's (1890) definition: “[A]ttention is…the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought” (p. 403). Since then, scholars from philosophy ( Arvidson 2013 , Gurwitsch 1964 , Husserl 1973 , Marder 2009 , Mole 2017 ), sociology and political science ( Downs 1972 , Peters & Hogwood 1985 , Tarde 1902 , Zerubavel 2015 ), and economics ( Falkinger 2008 , Hotelling 1938 , Simon 1971 ) have sought to study attention from their various disciplinary vantage points.
Within psychology, attention has played a key role in broader paradigm shifts, morphing along introspective, cognitivist, and, more recently, neuropsychological trends ( Kahneman & Treisman 1984 , Lorenz-Spreen et al. 2019 , Posner & Snyder 2004 , Ruz 2006 , Schmidt 2013 , Wilmer et al. 2017 ). Indeed, it was the psychologist Herbert Simon (1971) who first defined the basic terms of what is now called the “attention economy”: When information is abundant, human attention becomes a scarce resource and, hence, an object of economizing. Because consumers’ ability to parse relevant information is limited, producers invest more resources to capture their attention. Citton (2017) calls this the “great reversal,” in which standard assumptions about the dynamics of supply and demand invert. Indeed, early proponents of the Internet suggested that the attention economy would eventually overshadow the conventional economy, making it the ultimate measure of value ( Goldhaber 1997 ), an idea that has recently been revisited by Zuboff (2019) and other scholars doing critical analyses of the political economy of digital platforms (e.g., Crogan & Kinsley 2012 , Morozov 2019 , Moulier Boutang 2012 , Prainsack 2020 ). While we should not take techno-optimistic claims about the economically transformative ascendance of attention at face value, these commentators point to a more abstract sense in which attention has arguably taken on the role of money: as a general-purpose device for cultural commensuration, a common denominator to which all societal problems can be reduced (cf. Maurer 2006 ).
It is important not to be carried away. Arguably, if attention is scarce now, then it was also scarce “more than two and a half thousand years ago” ( Citton 2017 , p. 12). Yet, as Citton argues, it seems that a reconfiguration is taking place in the digital age, in which the distribution of attention “plays a hegemonic role” ( Citton 2017 , p. 10). Indeed, since Simon's (1971) and Kahneman's (2002) foundational work in behavioral economics, attention has been “a central, unifying theme” for that field ( Gabaix 2019 ), linking psychological work on attention as a limited cognitive resource to economic work on scarcity and value ( Dukas 2004 , Falkinger 2008 , Festré & Garrouste 2015 , Johnston & Dark 1986 , Lanham 2006 ). Still, while behavioral economics has produced widely influential insights (think, for example, about the concept of nudging), the question remains whether its focus is not too narrow to allow for a comprehensive social scientific understanding of human attention. A narrow focus on “attention economy” could benefit from being reformulated as a broader social question regarding the political economy of attention. To follow Karl Polanyi (1957) , we would be well-advised to start by recognizing that the “production,” “circulation,” and “consumption” of attention are inherently social and political activities. Social scientists must cast a wider net than seeing attention merely as a scarce resource. As Citton (2017) points out, the task at hand is to “identify the collective ‘attentional regimes’ through which we are led to perceive the world” (p. 17). Furthermore, as economists Festré & Garrouste (2015) point out, what is “call[ed for] is an interdisciplinary approach involving economists, but also historians, philosophers, psychologists [and] sociologists” (p. 15).
But what about the anthropologists? Barring a few notable exceptions ( Cook 2018 , Schüll 2014 ), little ethnographic work has been carried out on attention as a cultural or “emic” object of study. But more work is now emerging. Several ethnographers have undertaken studies of “digital detox” programs. Sutton (2017) , for instance, has described how “detoxers” in Northern California participate in a longer “counter-cultural” history of the software industry, seeking an elusive “nature” that they construct in opposition to “unnatural” digital technologies (see also Baym et al. 2020 , Fish 2017 , Harmon 2015 , Portwood-Stacer 2013 ). Jablonsky (2019) has explored how the developers of meditation apps navigate the tensions inherent in designing for such purposes on tech platforms that are designed to foster compulsive use. Related to her work is the burgeoning ethnographic study of mindfulness, which examines how people reflect on their own mental processes in culturally contingent ways (e.g., Cassaniti 2018 , Cook 2016 ). Current concerns about pathologies of human attention in the digital age were arguably anticipated by discussions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the late twentieth century and concomitant worries about the medicalization and politicization of children's attention spans and well-being ( Bergey et al. 2018 , Filipe 2016 , Nielsen 2017 ).
In spite of this incipient body of anthropological scholarship on attention, it is fair to say that attention has not figured prominently as an explicit ethnographic focus or analytical concept in anthropology. On a more implicit level, however, attention has played a central—indeed, we argue, decisive—role. While also discussing anthropological work about attention, our primary ambition here is to provide an overview of these largely tacit engagements with attention in anthropology. We do so by putting disparate anthropological literatures in critical dialogue with work on attention in cognate disciplines, organized around two broad clusters of themes: ( a ) attention in the anthropology of digital and datafied worlds and ( b ) attention in the anthropology of ritual forms and religious experience. While these themes do not exhaust the ways in which attention has figured explicitly or implicitly in anthropological research, they reflect key domains in which anthropologists have explored this question.
In what follows, we have two objectives. First, we aim to provide an overview and a resource for anthropologists interested in this burgeoning topic of interdisciplinary research in diverse sociocultural and geographic contexts. After all, as economic anthropology has taught us, time and value can intersect in numerous ways, the logics of which may be very different from capitalism. The fact that temporality and value are closely imbricated is one more good reason to posit attention as a political economy: It reminds us about the embeddedness of attentional practices and dynamics within localized and sometimes short-lived contexts. Indeed, as our review of the ethnographic literature will show, attention is not necessarily a scarce resource: For the skilled master in the entrapment of her own or others’ minds, attention is not automatically a zero-sum game, but stretchable and plastic. While the belief that attention is limited and under constant and perhaps growing pressure is undoubtedly one that many people (including the authors) recognize all too well, scholars should seriously consider the possibility that this limitation may be due to the near omnipresence and -potence of capitalist imaginaries in our current age, which figure time as a constrained resource that needs to be optimized (cf. one of the CHT slogans, “time well spent”). Because one key task of ethnography is to “challeng[e] the existence of a single chronopolitics of speed or time scarcity” ( Bear 2016 , p. 488), it follows that we as anthropologists must ask whether attention is, in fact, always limited.
Our second objective, then, is to identify avenues of empirical study and theoretical deliberation for a distinctly anthropological account of human attention—one that understands attention as an irreducibly socially and materially mediated phenomenon, not simply as a scarce resource that is located in and limited by individual mind-brains. We argue more specifically that attention can be theorized as a technology that organizes how humans perceive the world. “Technologies” (along with its sister term “techniques”; on which more below) offer an apt point of departure for theorizing attention anthropologically. In making this point, we follow a number of anthropologists (including Gell 1998 , Ingold 1987 , Sneath et al. 2009 ) who deploy this concept in a somewhat different sense than do Foucauldian studies of “governmentality” and “social technologies” (e.g., Cheney-Lippold 2017 , Rose 1990 ). This approach is germane for our present purposes for two reasons. First, it implies that the specific efficacy of a given technology cannot be separated from its material particularities, including attention technologies that are not physical objects per se but which are still imbued with specific materialities, such as the websites studied by Miller (2000) . Second, theorizing attention in this manner allows for a purposefully underdetermined conception of the relation between attentional inputs and outputs, which is neither determinist nor possibilist ( Ingold 1987 ) but abductive in that these “effects…present themselves only as affordances inherent in the processes that engender them…in ways that, though hardly random, are nevertheless essentially unpredictable and often quite unintended” ( Sneath et al. 2009 , p. 18). This strategy, whereby the generative features of attentional technologies are taken ethnographically and theoretically seriously, may set the anthropology of attention apart from other disciplinary approaches, allowing for an analysis of attention as a mode of action situated neither within people nor outside them but in that interstitial zone under indeterminacy, where anthropological research takes place and ethnographic data are produced.

Section: TECHNOLOGIES OF ATTENTION: ETHNOGRAPHIES OF DIGITIZED AND DATAFIED WORLDS

An extensive anthropological scholarship has arisen in recent years around the study of online worlds, the datafication of society, and media infrastructures. In the following discussion, we outline how questions of attention figure in anthropological studies across these different yet clearly overlapping fields of study.
The general field of media anthropology ( Coleman 2010 , Ginsburg et al. 2002 ) can be taken as a part of the anthropology of attention, especially studies of advertising, journalism, and news media (e.g., Boyer & Hannerz 2006 , Mazzarella 2017 ). Much of this work describes media professionals who account for their work as efforts to catch the attention of fickle audiences, elaborating local ideologies of attention, which may help to mitigate the widespread Eurocentrism of much research on attention. A case in point is Broad & Orlove's (2007) account of how Peruvians attended to the global media coverage of the El Niño climate event in 1997–1998, relying on a form of wary alertness to information deception from the state, locally termed “viveza.” Such research highlights how attention to global events is appropriated across cultural contexts, as well as how states and other powerful actors (be they local, national, or transnational) seek to control not only information flows but also how populations attend to news events.
Another significant strand of research looks into the materiality of media technologies. Larkin's (2008) work on media and infrastructure in Nigeria shows how radio networks and movie theaters were promoted by the state, alongside roads and electricity grids, as part of a project of aligning people's attention toward the same horizons of modernity (see also Petersen 2017 ). Other ethnographies focus on how media technologies shape people's everyday attention practices. Reminiscent of Hirschkind's (2009) crucial work on cassette sermons in Cairo (see also below), Broadbent (2012) describes how mobile phone users create personal boundaries by indicating where their attention is directed ( Broadbent 2012 , p. 130). As Broadbent notes, the adoption of mobile phones in workplaces has challenged attempts by industrial capitalism to control the flow of workers’ attention: “[R]estrictions of access to certain websites and to mobile phones and other communication channels are therefore to be understood as attempts to preserve the boundaries between social spheres and as forms of organizational control on attention” ( Broadbent 2012 , p. 132). Viewed as a form of attention technology, phones and computers come to serve as instruments for individual subjects navigating hierarchies in workplaces and affirming their autonomy. Echoing this point, Miller et al. (2016 , p. 57) note how seeing one's images posted by others on social media creates a sense of social acceptance in industrial China. For disadvantaged factory workers who usually serve as “attention givers,” being on the receiving end of attention implies recognition and self-esteem. This notion in turn mirrors Waltorp's (2020 , pp. 46–47) study of smartphone usage among Muslim women in Denmark, where the question of whether one deserves online attention is a source of constant contestation.
The Internet is perhaps the emblematic setting in which to study technologies of attention ethnographically. As Horst & Miller (2012) wrote almost a decade ago, “A good deal of contemporary digital technologies are, in essence, attention seeking mechanisms, partly because one of the most common clichés about our digital world is that it proliferates the amount of things competing for our attention” (p. 27). Compared with the websites studied by Miller (2000) as part of the first generation of digital anthropology, social media platforms have intensified the competition for attention: Their business models entail controlling the flow of attention of billions of users.
Anthropologists have studied attention mechanisms and practices on social media from various vantage points. Gershon (2008) , for instance, has described how Facebook and LinkedIn encourage particular forms of attention to self-presentation or conduct, not because of their sui generis qualities but because they operate within a broader neoliberal cultural context. Boellstorff (2008) , in his ethnography of the virtual world Second Life, describes how that platform's affordances make it possible for a user to attend to other users’ copresence in the same virtual space while also messaging with virtually distant peers. Such multiplexed communication is not unique to virtual worlds but is now a common feature of life in the age of “polymedia,” where communication and attention range across many channels and scales at the same time, which is particularly evident in cases of migration and digital diasporas ( Madianou & Miller 2013 ; cf. Applin & Fischer 2011 ).
Studies of the online lives of social and political movements describe how activists use social media platforms as arenas in which to make their movements visible and as technologies to capture the attention of the public at large. Platforms facilitate new flows of attention and offer new, virtual fieldsites for researchers who study social movements, despite media ideologies that deride “hashtag activism” as not “real” or as ineffectual (cf. Tufekci 2013 ). For instance, in his study of #Occupy, Juris (2012) describes how online social movements operate through a “logic of aggregation”—collecting individuals together online, who then appear in public space—which may be more prone to dissolution than other collective forms. Similarly, Bonilla & Rosa (2015) show how the use of hashtags on Twitter has allowed messages to be gathered together for Black political activism tied to locations such as #Ferguson or slogans such as #BlackLivesMatter. These new political movements, which draw the technology of the hashtag into their names, recall the collectives that Kelty (2005) named “recursive publics”—online communities defined largely via the technical conditions of their own association.
Such arrangements for attracting and capturing the attention of publics and audiences often come about through emergent social practices that highlight how offline and online activities are mutually constitutive ( Albris 2018 ; Juris 2012 , p. 260; Postill & Pink 2012 , p. 125). This fact also has methodological implications ( Bonilla & Rose 2015 , p. 11) for how anthropologists manage their own attention as fieldworkers who are often participating multimodally ( Pink et al. 2016 ). As Gray notes in her remote study of the 2011 protests in Moscow, “[F]ollowing them online—at home, using multiple devices—enabled me to be virtually in several Moscow locations at once, depending on my capacity for splitting my attention between the various platforms” ( Gray 2016 , p. 504).
As the capacity of digital technologies to command attention (and not only to reroute it) has become an object of popular concern, anthropologists have begun to study the designers of such systems and popular reactions against them. Schüll's (2014) work on the design of gambling machinery, which has been taken up far beyond anthropology, describes how lessons from behaviorist psychology are used to encourage compulsive gambling. Indeed, for her interlocutors, the “machine zone,” where they feel that they can lose themselves in the flow of gambling, is a desired attentional state, despite its often negative social, economic, and health consequences.
Anthropological studies of art and technology show how the deliberate capture of human attention is central to the contemporary Internet. In an early digital ethnographic study, Miller (2000) analyzed how webpages were designed to spread the fame of their makers (cf. Munn 1986 ) and to seduce and entrap the attention of visitors (cf. Gell 1996 ). For Miller and other students of digitized and datafied worlds, Gell's (1998) work on “technologies of enchantment” has provided a model for examining the “attention-seeking mechanisms” ( Horst & Miller 2012 , p. 27) of technologies built with specific psychological effects in mind. Seaver (2019) has described how the developers of algorithmic recommender systems themselves figure their work as a form of “trapping,” enticing users into ever more use. As with conventional animal traps (cf. Lemonnier 2012 ), these systems model their prey's attentional faculties in Gell's (1996) sense. Indeed, Gell's work on art offers perhaps the most elaborated anthropological account of attention. In addition to presenting a theory of social agency as a “nexus of intentionalities” ( Gell 1996 , p. 29), his work suggests that anthropological research on magic (and associated topics such as secrecy, rationality, and knowledge) might be considered part of the anthropology of attention, as these areas depend on the organization and manipulation of attention through simultaneously technical and social means ( McCreery 1995 ).
There is no doubt, then, that the ever-increasing digitization and datafication of everyday life across the world ( Douglas-Jones et al. 2021 , Knox & Nafus 2018 , Walford 2017 ) is transforming attentional practices, forcing researchers to see beyond smartphones and computers not only as mere media devices, but also as part of infrastructural networks that attract and capture attention for political, economic, or social ends. Yet as is also evident from the many current discourses around attention pertaining to new digital technologies as studied by anthropologists, human attention has long been considered valuable and thus something to be cared for and protected as well as controlled and manipulated. Attentional technologies, including digital ones, should not be the only focus of an anthropology of attention.

Attentional technologies, including digital ones, should not be the only focus of an anthropology of attention.

Section: TECHNIQUES OF ATTENTION: ETHNOGRAPHIES OF RITUAL FORMS AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE

Across a wide range of anthropological scholarship, we find ethnographic accounts of attention that are less entangled with external technologies or “traps” such as those described above and more concerned with embodied, internalized, and intentional processes and practices. Recalling Mauss's (1973) notion of “techniques of the body” and more recent invocations of the technique versus technology contrast (e.g., Ingold 1987 ), we refer to these as “techniques of attention,” by which we wish to denote those attentional scaffolds that are integral to—and potentially controllable by—individual agents. We organize our account around three theoretical approaches: ( a ) phenomenological anthropology, ( b ) cognitive anthropology, and ( c ) the anthropology of ethics.
Many phenomenological anthropologists ( Csordas 2009 ; Duranti 2009 ; Gatt 2013 ; Ingold 2001 ; Stewart 2011 ; Throop 2009 , 2012 ) have examined the role of attention in initiation rituals and other contexts of somatic crises and bodily transformation. Drawing on Schutz, Csordas (1993) defines “somatic modes of attention” as “culturally elaborated ways of attending to and with one's body in surroundings that include the embodied presence of others” (p. 138). Keeping with his cultural phenomenological take on human experience as irreducibly intersubjective, Csordas argues that attention is more than just a cognitive tool for the processing of perceptual input. Because it is embodied and culturally embedded, attention involves the “active constitution of a new object which makes explicit and articulate what was until then presented as no more than an indeterminate horizon” (Merleau-Ponty 1962, p. 30, cited in Csordas 1993 , p. 138). For this reason, the “processes in which we attend to and objectify our bodies,” which are typically intensified during initiation and healing ceremonies, “hold a particular interest” for anthropologists (Merleau-Ponty 1962, p. 30, cited in Csordas 1993 , p. 138): They make visible otherwise hidden dynamics by which human subjects come into being.
Building on Csordas's work, Throop (2012) also takes attention to play “a key role in configuring the texture of intersubjective life as mediated through the senses” (p. 413; see also Throop 2003 , p. 232). Drawing on ethnographic cases ranging from experiences of pain in Micronesia to mishaps in international diplomacy, Throop in a string of articles (some coauthored) puts forward one of the most sustained and sophisticated attempts to theorize “the organization and regulation of attention as a key dimension of our cultural existence, which is at work in all kinds of settings” ( Throop & Duranti 2015 , p. 1056). Throop & Duranti (2015 , pp. 1060–62) distinguish between five kinds of what they, invoking Heidegger, call “attentional pull” directed toward things that are ( a ) ready to hand; ( b ) present, but not ready to hand (because they are broken, say); ( c ) usually ready to hand but suddenly absent; ( d ) new, unexpected, or unusually present to senses; and ( e ) directing us toward something new. 2
Despite the quantity and quality of phenomenological anthropological work on intersubjective experience, it is difficult to disagree with Seligman & Brown's (2010) observation that such “discussions of embodiment…mostly lack an adequate account of the biological or cognitive (i.e., memory, attention) mechanisms through which symbolic and social processes shape bodily functioning and experience” (p. 131). Cognitive anthropology, ranging from the work of naturalist evolutionists to relativist studies of cosmology, offers one way to fill this gap.
Overlapping with evolutionary psychological and cognitive neuroscientific scholarship on attention (a vast field far beyond the scope of this review), the interdisciplinary field of cognitive science ( Boyer 1994 , Hirschfeld & Gelman 1994 , Sperber 1996 ) has inspired anthropological works on memory ( Bloch 1998 , Whitehouse 2000 ), iconoclasm ( Højbjerg 2004 ), and ritualization ( Humphrey & Laidlaw 1994 ). Here, Nielbo & Sørensen (2016) explicitly focus on how ritualized action influences the use of attentional resources, whereas Seligman & Brown (2010) offer a more general reflection on how culturally distinct schemas of experience, behavior, and knowledge, like trance and meditation, feed on and into “cognitive affective processes” such as “perceptual distortion, self-deception, memory suppression” (p. 132). Another approach is found in philosophical and archaeological work on distributed or extended cognition ( Clark & Chalmers 1998 , Mithen 1996 ), which anthropologists have drawn on to theorize talismans ( Pedersen 2007 ), handicrafts ( Venkatesan 2010 ), and sculptures ( Küchler 1987 , 2004 ), among other things, as purpose-built attention-grabbing artifacts [see also Hutchins's (1995) celebrated ethnography of a US aircraft carrier]. 3
Following Boyer's (1994) theory of religious beliefs as informationally encapsulated cognitive modules evolved for other evolutionary reasons [see also Sperber (1996) on “cognitive attractors”; Pierre Smith's writings on “mind traps” (cf. Halloy 2015 ) and more generally Sperber & Wilson's (1986) influential theory of “relevance”], Liénard & Boyer (2006) argue that rituals work “because specific aspects of human cognitive architecture make these behavioral sequences attention-grabbing, intuitively appropriate, and compelling” (p. 814). Citing neuropsychological research, they suggest that religious ritual, “when observed by normal human minds,” overwhelms participants’ “working memory, so that the person cannot attend to stimuli and situations outside the ritualized action” ( Liénard & Boyer 2006 , p. 821). On this cognitive anthropological account, effective ritualization amounts to a form of “thought suppression” that is “attention-grabbing and compelling to participants” (p. 821). An equally concerted but more ethnographically involved attempt to combine anthropology and psychology is Luhrmann's work on spiritual experiences as skilled practices. As Luhrmann (2012) writes in her study of West Coast evangelicals, “I would describe what I saw as a theory of attentional learning—that…people learn specific ways of attending to their minds and their emotions to find evidence of God, and that both what they attend to and how they attend changes their experience of their minds and that as a result, they begin to experience a real, external, interacting living presence” (p. xxi). As indicated by the term “attentional learning,” Luhrmann and her colleagues’ (e.g., Cassaniti & Luhrmann 2014 , Corwin & Erickson-David 2020 ) work is an apt case of attentional techniques in our sense.
Luhrmann's and other recent research on prayer points to the centrality of attentional techniques that people seek to learn, master, and manipulate in work within the anthropology of ethics and morality. 4 Here, two orientations are especially relevant. First, Zigon's (2007) work on “moral breakdowns,” where tacit moral dispositions become visible, can be said to be about attention (think about the sudden awareness of physical proximity toward others in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its call for social distancing). More to the point, as part of a general turn to virtue ethics in anthropological studies of especially Christianity ( Bandak 2017 , Robbins 2004 ) and Islam (see below), an influential body of ethnographic work has been published that explores ideals and practices of self-cultivation and -realization in the traditions of Aristotle, Foucault, and MacIntyre (1981) .
Mahmood's ethnography of vernacular Islam (2012) is a case in point. Its ethnographic and theoretical focus on cultivating a pious ethical self, we suggest, makes it a landmark anthropological study of attention. Mahmood, like Luhrmann, explores in rich ethnographic detail how people willfully subject themselves to rigorous attentional disciplines in a manner that calls to mind Foucault's genealogy of self-relational technologies (or indeed, using our term, techniques) in the history of Christianity ( Holbraad & Pedersen 2017 , Keane 2007 ). The same goes for other studies of religious self-cultivation where meta-cognitive processes play a key role (e.g., Mair 2018 ). Nowhere is this clearer than in the work of Joanna Cook, one of a few anthropologists who has studied attention in both “etic” and “emic” terms. In several writings, she unpacks the economic and cultural work performed by “attention” in mindfulness therapy ( Cook 2016 , 2017 , 2018 ). As Cook (2018) writes, the “most common definition of mindfulness…to ‘pay attention in a particular way: on purpose’…offer[s] the romantic possibility of a newly invigorated engagement with life.” Finally, we can consider Hirschkind's work as another major (if partly covert) contribution to the social scientific study of attention. In fact, because it covers everything from ancient “prayer machines” ( Hirschkind 2016 ) over urban soundscapes in postcolonial contexts ( Hirschkind 2009 ) to digital media ( Hirschkind et al. 2017 ) and given his sustained and specific focus on how technological transformations mold experience, Hirschkind's work represents a bridge between the two bodies of literature, around which our review has been organized, namely anthropological work on religion/ritual and media/technology (see also Larkin 2014 ). One can only hope that future anthropological work on attention will foster a deeper dialogue between these two otherwise disparate approaches and debates.
Many phenomenological anthropologists ( Csordas 2009 ; Duranti 2009 ; Gatt 2013 ; Ingold 2001 ; Stewart 2011 ; Throop 2009 , 2012 ) have examined the role of attention in initiation rituals and other contexts of somatic crises and bodily transformation. Drawing on Schutz, Csordas (1993) defines “somatic modes of attention” as “culturally elaborated ways of attending to and with one's body in surroundings that include the embodied presence of others” (p. 138). Keeping with his cultural phenomenological take on human experience as irreducibly intersubjective, Csordas argues that attention is more than just a cognitive tool for the processing of perceptual input. Because it is embodied and culturally embedded, attention involves the “active constitution of a new object which makes explicit and articulate what was until then presented as no more than an indeterminate horizon” (Merleau-Ponty 1962, p. 30, cited in Csordas 1993 , p. 138). For this reason, the “processes in which we attend to and objectify our bodies,” which are typically intensified during initiation and healing ceremonies, “hold a particular interest” for anthropologists (Merleau-Ponty 1962, p. 30, cited in Csordas 1993 , p. 138): They make visible otherwise hidden dynamics by which human subjects come into being.
Building on Csordas's work, Throop (2012) also takes attention to play “a key role in configuring the texture of intersubjective life as mediated through the senses” (p. 413; see also Throop 2003 , p. 232). Drawing on ethnographic cases ranging from experiences of pain in Micronesia to mishaps in international diplomacy, Throop in a string of articles (some coauthored) puts forward one of the most sustained and sophisticated attempts to theorize “the organization and regulation of attention as a key dimension of our cultural existence, which is at work in all kinds of settings” ( Throop & Duranti 2015 , p. 1056). Throop & Duranti (2015 , pp. 1060–62) distinguish between five kinds of what they, invoking Heidegger, call “attentional pull” directed toward things that are ( a ) ready to hand; ( b ) present, but not ready to hand (because they are broken, say); ( c ) usually ready to hand but suddenly absent; ( d ) new, unexpected, or unusually present to senses; and ( e ) directing us toward something new. 2

Section: THEORIZING ATTENTION ANTHROPOLOGICALLY

In The Ecology of Attention , Citton (2017) proposes that, “[i]nstead of asking to what we should be attentive…, we might also try [to] understand what we can do with …our attention. Distinct from the economic metaphor found throughout the vocabulary of attention (‘paying’, ‘lending’, ‘investing’ one's attention),… doing … [attention]…implies the practice of an activity that constitutes its own end” (p. 171, original emphasis). In many ways, this perspective—that attention is a form of action (a “doing”) rather than a property (a “having”) or a state (a “being”) of mind—captures our errand here. Irrespective of the ethnographic context studied, anthropologists have tended to explore attention as an activity, something that does something to people—as a particular mode of action, that is to say, which is either the result of an explicit agenda or motivation or happens more tacitly and less deliberately.
But how does this process of attentional action work in more concrete ethnographic terms? How does attention exercise its considerable sway over social life in particular contexts, and how do we most effectively theorize it anthropologically? To address these questions, we have proposed a heuristic contrast between attentional technologies and techniques. Accordingly, our discussion of anthropological scholarship on digital and datafied worlds has focused on attentional technologies in Gell's sense, that is, an underdetermined (“abductive”) molding of agency by means of purpose-built sociomaterial infrastructures acting independently from human subjects. Then, in our assessment of work on ritual forms and religious experience, we introduce the notion of attentional techniques, where the scaffolding of attentionality is controlled by and ontologically inseparable from conscious and motivated subjects. Although it is debatable whether the participants in, say, an initiation rite have much control over what it does to their attention, ethnographic work on prayer and mindfulness depicts situations where people decide to become “mind trapped” or habituated (in Mahmood's intentional and ethically motivated sense, contra Bourdieu's tacit and instrumental sense) to controlling their minds via intricate metacognitive techniques.
With a nod to Heidegger, one could think of attention as a “clearing” that allows for new figures to come into view and others to recede. Certainly, that “clearing” may be used as a noun and a verb points to a vital insight, namely that attention is a limit point where the contrast between “the active” and “the passive” breaks down—to attend to something as a moment where one is acting and acted upon at the same time ( Csordas 1993 , p. 138). One could also add, attention to some one . Indeed, recent anthropological work on care has focused on attention as interpersonal connection ( Garcia 2010 , Krishnamurti 2020 , Lavau & Bingham 2017 , Pinto 2014 , Semel 2021 ). In more abstract terms, one might think of attention as the “shadow” of care. If the former often connotes investment, exploitation, and scarcity, the latter, as has also been alluded to above, tends to be associated with involvement, engagement, and generosity and may thus be conceived as “loving attention” ( Thelen 2015 ).
Regardless of where one draws the line between what is forced and free, and between what is “social” and what is “individual,” the question is whether the contrast between external attentional technologies and internal attentional techniques itself should not be subjected to critical inquiry. Perhaps the negotiation of what is a coercive, externally imposed attentional technology and an intentional liberating technique—the “fluctuating tension between attentional activity and differing forms of attentional pull” ( Throop & Duranti 2015 , p. 1056)—is what truly needs to be investigated. There is certainly the danger of overlooking the societal structures and cultural discourses surrounding often class-specific and racialized attentional ideologies and practices. For this review, we have decided to stick to the title “The Political Economy of Attention” precisely in order to mitigate the risk of depoliticization, even if the content of our discussions has hardly been political or economic in the conventional sense. In our two renderings of techne , attention as both matter of concern and matter of fact partakes in and reproduces larger political structures and economic flows, often in ways that cannot be separated from other dynamics associated with late capitalism and its relentless expansion into new arenas of commodification. As has been shown by Laura Bear and other anthropologists exploring the intersection between forms of value and temporality ( Nielsen 2011 ), in capitalism, “time is both reduced and abstracted to a technique for bringing capital into being” ( Bear 2016 , p. 491). Given that current research on attention cannot be separated from larger philosophical and psychological debates about the role of time in human intentionality, 5 it follows that by “paying attention to [attention], we can critique and measure inequality in new ways” to paraphrase Bear (2016 , p. 489). Put in more no-nonsense sociological terms, in both practical and symbolic ways, attention is a tool of power and oppression, or as Larkin puts it, “[T]he regulation of attention is central to the production of value” ( Larkin 2013 , p. 339).
Overall, the approach to the anthropological study of attention that we have outlined in this article is in keeping with Miller and colleagues’ “critical take on all attempts to declare that The Internet has done this or that to young people, memory, attention span, or whatever” ( Miller 2016 , emphasis added). Thus, we have argued, attention is not a thing that something is “done to.” Rather, attention “does something” to—or by—someone. We do not mean that attention is an unlimited resource that one can “freely use” to “manage” whatever issues one needs. To claim so would commit the vulgar functionalistic mistake of the “social imaginaries” approach, where virtually every symbolic form or cultural phenomenon is assumed to serve a collective or individual “purpose” ( Sneath et al. 2009 , Pedersen 2011 ). Rather, as we have argued over the preceding pages via targeted readings across the anthropological literature on digital and religious worlds, attention as techne plays a crucial role in the sociocognitive and intersubjective processes through which human beings are made into certain kinds of persons and subjects. Even if it does not have the power to determine to what end and what effect, attention has the capacity to make us turn our minds and bodies to something and thus away from something else.
To close, it is worth remembering that ethnographic fieldwork and anthropological analysis are attentional activities themselves. As a search through assorted anthropology journals for the term “attention” will show, there is no lack of efforts or pleas to direct our professional attention to certain ethnographic phenomena or to reimagine how we as fieldworkers attend to the social world. As professors or students of anthropology, we too are embedded in broader political economies of attention—in academia, in our private lives, and among the people whose worlds we study and write about. We hope that, as the anthropology of attention grows into maturity, more of our colleagues will consider our own taken-for-granted attentional technologies and techniques within the field and beyond by turning their attention to the study of anthropological attention itself.
