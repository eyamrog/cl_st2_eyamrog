Title: Archaeology of Everyday Life


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

Everyday life is critical in the constitution of selves and societies alike. Archaeology, with its attention to material and spatial remains, is in a unique position to further studies of everyday life, as ordinary materials and spaces formalize how people learn about themselves and their world. This review defines an archaeology of everyday life, examines its historical roots, synthesizes new literature on the topic, and outlines future directions. Although there is no established subfield called “everyday archaeology,” a rich and ever-growing body of recent research illustrates the impact of everyday life studies on archaeological interpretations and practice. Research on everyday life peoples the past in a way that few other paradigms do.

Section: INTRODUCTION

What is archaeology if not the study of everyday life? Much of the archaeological record is a palimpsest of the minutiae of people's past day-to-day practices: lithic scatters, sherds, houses, flecks of charcoal, garbage. Yet there is no defined subfield of “everyday archaeology” as there are for other key areas of archaeological research, such as household archaeology, economic archaeology, spatial archaeology, etc. Everyday life matters in people's lives and societies and in our archaeological analyses. Attending to everyday life brings people and their practices to the foreground. It highlights all people—ordinary and underrepresented, as well as wealthy and powerful—and illustrates the central role that people and their daily practices play in shaping society: Humans are not the mere pawns of history and prehistory; they make their own history.
Ordinary objects and places and the attendant things people do in their everyday lives are not as mundane as they first appear. They are sometimes quite extraordinary, and they are always implicated in what is going on in events in the world and the long-term social, economic, political, and ecological dynamics of human societies. To illustrate the breadth and impact of everyday life in archaeology, this review proceeds by ( a ) defining an archaeology of everyday life, ( b ) examining intellectual origins, ( c ) synthesizing new research, and ( d ) providing future directions.
From the footprints of 700,000-year-old Homo heidelbergensis adults and possibly children who tracked and butchered hippopotami in Ethiopia ( Altamura et al. 2018 ) to the hundreds, if not thousands, of Native Americans who labored at Rancho Petaluma between 1834 and 1857 and actively resisted colonial regimes ( Silliman 2004 ), archaeological research on everyday life spans the globe and the temporality of human existence. Books and edited volumes written in the past decade that highlight everyday life illustrate the emergent role of this literature (e.g., Allison 2013 ; Battle-Baptiste 2011 ; Beck et al. 2016 ; Blanke 2019 ; Chesson 2011 ; Dawdy 2016 ; Ebeling 2010 ; Fowles 2013 ; Gilchrist 2012 , 2013 ; Gokee 2016 ; Gokee & Logan 2014 ; Graff & Rodríguez-Alegría 2012 ; Hendon 2010 ; Hutson 2010 ; Hutson & Robin 2014 ; Johnson 2017 ; Khatchadourian 2016 ; Kruczek-Aaron 2015 ; Lightfoot & Gonzalez 2018 ; Martelle et al. 2018 ; Moore 2012 ; Morehart & De Lucia 2015 ; Overholtzer & Robin 2015 ; Pollock 2015 ; Price & Carr 2018 ; Richard 2018 ; Robin 2013 ; Roller 2018 ; Smith 2010, 2010 ; Van Dyke 2015 ; Voss & Casella 2011 ; Wilkie 2010 ). Archaeological studies of everyday life play a crucial role in allowing investigators to interpret and understand human societies and in bringing to light the lives of ordinary and underrepresented people.

Section: DEFINING AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE

Archaeology of everyday life is the study of the daily or near-daily practices of all past people and the far-reaching implications that seemingly mundane acts have for human societies ( Robin 2013 ). This definition draws together three key dimensions of everyday life. First, everyday life encompasses the range of daily, commonplace, routine, ordinary, and mundane activities that form the core of our lives (walking, talking, dwelling, cooking, cleaning, playing, etc.). An archaeology of everyday life establishes the central role that ordinary materials and ordinary places play in making the world meaningful (e.g., Hendon 2010 , Hutson 2010 , Khatchadourian 2016 , Overholtzer & Robin 2015 , Robb 2007 , Van Dyke 2015 ). Building on a crucial insight of premodern studies, that most socialization occurs in the domestic domain rather than in formal institutions such as schools (e.g., Bourdieu 1977 ), it is the case in all societies that everyday life constitutes an important site for the production and reproduction of meaning. Within everyday life, fundamental identities (gender, sexuality, class, status, race, ethnicity, etc.) are produced, reproduced, and passed on to the next generation or transformed. The ordinary objects and spaces of daily life are not passive backdrops for human action: People learn about their world through situated interactions with the materials and spaces of daily life, which encode and express social identities and power relations as well as provide opportunities to question and challenge societal expectations. The material and spatial world can be constraining or enabling and even both simultaneously—it can inform and influence people's actions, and in addition, how people use, reuse, and reconstruct it can create and inscribe new meanings in the world.
Second, archaeological research on everyday life highlights the diversity of actors in any society and the impactful lives that any member of society can have. It peoples the past in a way that few other paradigms do and can take research to the level of face-to-face interaction. Every person has a quotidian life, and the study of daily life can encompass the lives of any member of society. Everyday life perspectives in archaeology have been particularly fruitful in documenting the lives of ordinary and underrepresented people. While ordinary and underrepresented people are often omitted from textual records that focus on grand events and are often written by and for elites, everyone in the course of their daily lives leaves some material and spatial traces in the archaeological record (e.g., Battle-Baptiste 2011 , Richard 2018 , Robin 2013 , Smith 2010 , Stahl 2001 ). Thus, an archaeology of everyday life is poised to provide the missing histories for “people without history” (sensu Wolf 1982 ).
Third, from the minutia of everyday life people create enduring memories and relate to others and the world around them. In this sense, the seemingly banal actions of daily life are not trivial at all but are a nexus of activities and interactions that give shape and meaning to the world and give people the ability to shape their world and make it meaningful. Quotidian life is an important locus of social change. Daily life has a transformative capacity because it can shape or be shaped by the broader world. Outside institutions can shape, sometimes strongly, everyday life, particularly in cases of culture contact, war, climate change, and population expansion, etc. (e.g., Brumfiel 1991 , Hastorf 1991 , Kuijt 2000 , Miller & Tune 2018 , VanDerwarker & Wilson 2015 , Voss 2000 ). When external institutions and power dynamics expressly target the management of everyday life, daily life can become a place of accommodation or a place of resistance. Yet, while grand narratives of human history typically ascribe change to dramatic catalysts, change happens every day as people accept or question, consciously or unconsciously, the meaning of existing social relations (e.g., Johnson 1996 , Robin 2013 , Stahl 2001 , Wall 1994 ). Daily life does not just acquiesce to the changes thrust upon it but has a truly transformative potential. A critical analysis of everyday life exposes both the possibilities that daily practices engender and the structural constraints and power relations that curtail daily practices.

Section: INTELLECTUAL ORIGINS WITHIN THE FIELD OF ARCHAEOLOGY

At one level, it is obvious: Everyday life is a core of human existence and a basic contributor to the archaeological record. Deetz (1977) defined archaeology as the “small things forgotten,” the taken-for-granteds and left-behinds of past daily life. Patterned material remains are often the products of “the little routines that people performed day in and day out” ( Lightfoot 2005 , p. 17). This ordinary nature of the archaeological record “compels us to recognize the impact of the everyday decisions made by ancient people” ( Smith 2010 , p. xiv). However, studies of everyday life have not always been at the forefront of archaeological, anthropological, or other social scientific inquiries.
The grand narratives that dominate human history often overlook everyday life and go further to trivialize and make it invisible. They do so by presenting a narrative of a society as dependent on broader powers and dynamics, denying and overlooking the things people do and the structural changes that develop out of everyday actions. The traditional focus in archaeology, particularly in the study of ancient civilizations, on excavating the exotic and monumental remains of temples and tombs, has amplified the marginalization of everyday life studies. From the halls of museums to the pages of National Geographic magazine and programs on the Discovery Channel, grand monuments and finds attract a larger consumer market than ordinary objects do. In archaeology, as across social science disciplines more broadly, and for the general public, the seemingly routine nature of everyday life lends it to being overlooked. Taking everyday life seriously is paradigm shifting because it asks archaeologists to consider the ancient world not in terms of chronology or artifact types but in terms of the daily practices ( Price & Carr 2018 ).
As with broader social science disciplines, the field of archaeology has a history of polarizing debates surrounding the value of macro versus micro, materialist versus idealist, and objective versus subjective approaches, dichotomies rooted in Cartesian, Platonic, and structuralist dualities. These debates came to a head in the processual (objectivist, materialist) versus postprocessual (subjectivist, idealist) archaeologies of the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., Binford 1977 , Hodder 1982 ). Moving beyond dichotomies is imperative for archaeology as many ancient (and modern) societies were not founded on principles of dualities (e.g., Grauer 2020 , Meskell & Joyce 2003 , Robin & Rothschild 2002 ). Polarizing debates have historically been resolved by taking an everyday life approach because in daily life the micro (self, interaction, experience) and the macro (institutions, power relations, societies) intersect.
The archaeological perspectives from which an everyday life approach emerges develop out of and further research in processual and postprocessual archaeologies. Processual archaeology's focus on social and ecological processes spurred the early development of settlement pattern and household studies, which opened the door to understanding the places where people lived in the past. As well, postprocessual attention to subjectivity and meaning fostered an emphasis on people, ideas, and lived experiences that are key in everyday life studies.
From this broader history of archaeological thought, several established subfields have played a significant role in developing an archaeology of everyday life. This review discusses and relates four groupings of established subfields: ( a ) household, community, and landscape studies; ( b ) gender, sexuality, and life course archaeologies; ( c ) archaeologies of material culture, craft, and cuisine; and ( d ) historical archaeology.
Household archaeology has shown how past peoples organized and made meaningful their domestic spaces. By focusing on the complexity and diversity of domestic life, household studies have been important in demonstrating the key role that actions in the domestic sphere have for the organization of societies (e.g., Allison 1999 , Hendon 1996 , Robb 2007 , Wilk & Ashmore 1988 ). While the domestic domain is a focal point for everyday life, daily life does not stop at the door of a house. Community archaeology expands the domain of study (e.g., Gokee 2016 , Roller 2018 ). Defining community as both a place and a group of people who create a salient social identity based on that place ( Canuto & Yaeger 2000 ) pushes research to address the people, actions, and interactions that created community in the past. Landscape research extends these agendas by showing how all living spaces are meaningfully constructed and experienced across people's lives (e.g., Ashmore 2002 , David & Thomas 2008 , Smith 2003 ).
Gender, sexuality, and life course archaeologies further illustrate the importance of incorporating the lives of all social groups into analyses (e.g., Battle-Baptiste 2011 , Baxter 2005 , Gilchrist 2012 , Joyce 2008 , Robin & Brumfiel 2008 , Voss 2008b ). Feminist household archaeologists were among the first to show that the contemporary Western division between “domestic/house/private/female/consumption/passive” and the active public world of male politics and production was not universal. This division is a construct of particular historical processes such as the development of Western capitalism; it is not an essential or natural division. Thus, we must consider the important roles that households and domestic life play in the broader world (e.g., Joyce 2008 , Robin & Brumfiel 2008 , Wall 1994 ).
Research in materiality, the mutually constitutive relationship between people and the material world, provides a framework for understanding the importance of ordinary materials in societies ( Hubert 2016 , Overholtzer & Robin 2015 ). Two specific areas of material studies, the long established archaeologies of craft production and the more recent archaeologies of cuisine, have fruitfully advanced studies of everyday life in recent years (e.g., Gokee & Logan 2014 , Graff & Rodríguez-Alegría 2012 , Hastorf 2016 , Morehart & De Lucia 2015 ).
Historical archaeology has been particularly attuned to furthering studies of the material remains of everyday life, which are often neglected in the documentary record (e.g., Deetz 1977 , Hall & Silliman 2006 , Hicks & Beaudry 2006 , Leone et al. 2005 , Singleton 1995 ). The archaeological record's material remains of daily life both complement and challenge the macronarratives of powerful people and winners who tend to consume documentary sources.
Although there is no defined subfield of everyday archaeology, insight from established subfields provides a foundation for everyday life research in archaeology. Archaeology's material record of quotidian life provides an important lens to examine the meaningful and impactful daily lives of all peoples in the past.

Section: NEW RESEARCH IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF EVERYDAY LIFE

Recent archaeological research in everyday life foregrounds daily activities that might seem mundane: preparing food and eating, walking along paths, building and cleaning houses, consuming goods and making them at home, working in gardens and fields, etc. However, attending to everyday life reveals the profound implications that daily activities have for people's lives and societies. Archaeological perspectives illuminate how ordinary objects and spatial arrangements formalize relations, which people create, use, and modify and through which people learn about themselves and their social world.
New research illustrates the multifaceted potential of everyday life: It can be habitual and it can be surprising. The materials, places, and practices of the quotidian provide both a structure for the maintenance of the traditional and a platform to challenge and transform society. This review proceeds to highlight new research and address three themes that encompass the breadth and impact of everyday life studies: ( a ) everyday life and identity, ( b ) societal transformations of everyday life, and ( c ) everyday societal transformations.
New research in the archaeology of everyday life has furthered our understanding of how fundamental identities (e.g., gender, sexuality, class, race, ethnicity) are produced, reproduced, and passed on to the next generation or transformed through everyday processes. Studies of houses and households across the world and through time have cogently illustrated how learning about selves and societies happens each day within domestic settings. The material form of dwellings encodes and expresses broader societal expectations through which residents learn traditional values and expectations (e.g., Allison 1999 , Blanton 1994 , Greenberg 2011 , Grenville 2008 , Hendon 2010 , Robb 2007 ). The way houses communicate is not only through architecture, but also through interior spatial arrangements, exterior spaces, and household possessions. There is a mutually constituting relationship between the material form of a house and the social lives of its residents (e.g., Hutson 2010 , Johnson 2015 ). Living and acting in a house turn a house into a home (e.g., Chesson 2012 , Moore 2012 ). The reiterative rebuilding of houses one on top of the other, which produces mounds and tells that form in the archaeological record, creates material connections with past houses ( Overholtzer 2015 ). The wealth of ritual and religious objects commonly found in houses and workshops highlights how daily life is not opposed to ritual and religion but part of the process of the cocreation of belief systems (e.g., Bradley 2005 , Fowles 2013 , Kruczek-Aaron 2015 , Stahl 2015 ). And households can be repositories for the multigenerational transmission of ecological knowledge (e.g., Fisher 2014 ). Through living in a house, learning what is acceptable and unacceptable, formulating and testing new ideas, people come to know the world around them.
Feminist, Black feminist, gender, and sexuality studies opened the door to understanding the diversity of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, and other identities in households and societies (e.g., Battle-Baptiste 2011 , Brumfiel 1992 , Franklin 2001 , Joyce 2008 , Meskell & Joyce 2003 , Robin & Brumfiel 2008 , Voss 2008b ). Solely normative household groups populated neither the more recent past nor the ancient pasts: Plural households were more common than traditional scholarship originally perceived. The formation of identities through daily life is an active process that engages and creates this diversity. This diversity may be the gender, age, and kin diversity of deep prehistory (e.g., Altamura et al. 2018 , Fowler 2005 ) or the increasingly global diversity of more recent prehistory, history, and the recent past. In multicultural Roman Egypt, wealth, status, ethnic heritage, locality, and gender all played a role in how Egyptian, Greek, and Roman residents defined their identities through daily practices within their households ( Boozer 2015 ). In plural households and communities of Alaskan men, Indigenous Californian women, and Russian merchants at Fort Ross, California (1812–1841), daily practices, at multiple scales across the community, framed culture change and persistence. Russian managers organized the rhythms of daily life across Fort Ross by structuring the fort into discrete ethnic neighborhoods. Alaskan Alutiiq principles were employed in the organization of the Native Alaskan neighborhood and the construction of houses there. Kashaya Native Californian food preparation, cooking, and cleaning techniques defined daily practices within and outside of houses ( Lightfoot 2005 , Lightfoot et al. 1998 ). The daily struggles of identity formation in the past can have significant implications for identity today, as shown by the ethnogenesis of a Californio identity from the struggles of diverse people of African, indigenous, and Spanish descent who lived and worked at El Presidio de San Francisco (1776–1846) ( Voss 2008a ).
Life course studies exposed the significance of life stage in understanding situated daily experiences (e.g., Gilchrist 2012 ). The archaeology of childhood, in particular, has sought to identify children as important members of households who not only play, but also play an active role in processes of socialization that are central in social reproduction and its transformation (e.g., Baxter 2005 , Crawford et al. 2018 , De Lucia 2010 , Overholtzer 2012 ). Senior members of society can become generational and gender mediators in their communities, such as African American midwives in the late nineteenth century ( Wilkie 2003 ). Following Emancipation, Lucrecia Perryman embarked on the vocation of midwifery to teach mothering across generations and transmit cultural practices rooted in an African past as well as transmit innovation ( Wilkie 2003 , pp. 79–118). Even in death, quotidian life has a role to play as people can carry their daily lives with them in death through the objects they bring with them and through the physical traces of repetitive daily activities in their bones (e.g., Aranda et al. 2009 , Wesp 2015 ).
The socializing materiality of everyday life extends beyond houses to all the spaces, places, and activities of daily life. Pathways, be they evidenced by footprints and tread marks, or through chemical signatures and microartifact distributions, illustrate the repetitive daily movement of people and their associations and connections with others in their world (e.g., Altamura et al. 2018 , Robin 2002 , Sheets 2011 , Snead et al. 2009 , Özbal 2012 ). Daily activities such as cooking, storing, eating, cleaning, and craft production provide fertile arenas for developing identities.
Food studies in archaeology illustrate that obtaining food is not just a central need of daily life. Preparing and consuming food with others are key aspects of identity formation that can shape and reinforce power relations and gender, class, ethnicity, and other differences in society (e.g., Ebeling & Rowan 2004 , Graff & Rodríguez-Alegría 2012 , Hastorf 2016 , VanDerwarker & Wilson 2015 ). Even something as seemingly simple as how and with whom people collect firewood for cooking shapes the organization of social life (e.g., Morehart & Helmke 2008 , Picornell-Gelabert & Servera-Vives 2017 ). Who sits at the head of the table or who carves the meat can express social hierarchies, and likewise sharing meals in large bowls can express social solidarity (e.g., Wall 1994 ).
As with food, crafting is central to identity making. Indeed, Gokee & Logan (2014) have argued for the utility of taking a holistic approach to studying food and craft practices together to understand situated everyday experiences. Although the field of craft production originally focused on specialized production and workshops, recent research has emphasized the importance of attending to daily life for understanding craft production (e.g., Hendon 1996 , 2010 ; Hirth 2009 ; Morehart & De Lucia 2015 ; Pyburn 2008 ). Domestic multicrafting or complementary crafting was fundamental to economic development, be it in the pre-Aztec world ( De Lucia 2013 ) or precolonial Africa ( Stahl 2016 ). The day-to-day tasks of craft production and the interactions of and training of craft producers create central dynamics not only for making objects, but also for learning about identities. In the pre-Columbian Aztec case, girls learned to weave from their mothers and older sisters in their homes ( Hendon 2010 , pp. 129–35). The backstrap loom could be scaled down to their size. As young girls learned to hold their bodies in particular ways to develop their craft, through the repetitive day-to-day acts of weaving, they shaped their bodies and selves as Aztec women and weavers. The gradual and long-term physical activities of daily life affect not only people's social identities, but also human bodies as is visible in osteological imprints of repetitive daily activities ( Wesp 2015 ).
Far from mundane, the materials, spaces, and activities of daily life constitute the bedrock of learning instrumental in the production and reproduction of selves and societies. An archaeology of everyday life pushes the field beyond faceless structuralist models of social reproduction toward active analyses of the daily constitution of identities by a diverse populace.
Central to archaeological research is the question of change: How and why do cultures, societies, and people's lives change? Dramatic catalysts such as culture contact, conquest, colonialism, and imperialism are traditional prime movers for societal change. Clashing cultures can throw into particular relief the taken-for-granteds of everyday life that may not be comparable between two cultures.
Although often overlooked, because daily life can be considered a bastion for the reproduction of tradition, colonizers and victors can target, often intentionally so, the everyday in an attempt to stifle the maintenance of traditions by colonized or conquered peoples that could be seen as threatening to new structures of power. The entire structure of indigenous villages and the spatial organization of daily activities were reoriented in colonial Alta California to protect women from rape and persecution ( Voss 2000 ). Indigenous lifeways can be as pivotal as those of conquering groups in shaping societies after conquest (e.g., Oland et al. 2012 , Rodning et al. 2018 ). However, culture contact does not always result in social change, as in the case of the early Swahili trade village of Tumbe's incorporation into Indian Ocean trade, which did not result in major alterations to community life ( Fleisher & LaViolette 2013 ).
Two now classic examples from the expansions of the pre-Columbian Aztec and Inca empires in Central and South America, respectively, illustrate how tribute demands in empire building transformed daily life and gender relations. In the case of Aztec imperial expansion, workloads increased to meet tribute demands. Women and girls living in the Valley of Mexico intensified their cooking practices by investing in the laborious process of tortilla making to satisfy mobile agricultural and market labor forces ( Brumfiel 1991 ). In the case of Inca imperial expansion, women intensified maize beer production while at the same time seeing their status in politics and power decline ( Hastorf 1991 ).
Even under the most oppressive conditions, daily life does not simply acquiesce to transformations in society and dominant powers; it can alternatively, or simultaneously, act back on broader societal processes (e.g., Leone et al. 2005 , Yamin 2005 ). In the aforementioned case of Aztec imperial expansion, although women and girls were forced into laborious work to satisfy tribute demands, they did not blindly accept the dominant Aztec ideology: Their use of figurines illustrates no enthusiasm for the dominant ideology ( Brumfiel 1996 ). In Upper Mesopotamia, people living under Neo-Assyrian rule did not fully conform to official dictates of settled agrarian lifeways. Semi-nomadic pastoralism at Tušhan, a provincial capital, illustrates the slippages between a Neo-Assyrian agrarian ideal and actual agrarian practice ( Rosenzweig 2016 ). In the Armenian settlement of Tsaghkahovit, the community's partly concealed semisubterranean architecture provided spaces that simultaneously limited the efficacy of imperial Achaemenid Persian expansion and extended the reach of its sovereignty ( Khatchadourian 2016 ). Daily life in a Pennsylvania coal-mining town, the shanty enclaves of immigrant coal workers, and the 1897 Lattimer Massacre of 19 striking immigrant mine workers illustrate how capitalism's promise of progress is inseparable from its destructive cycles ( Roller 2018 ).
The simple presence of underrepresented peoples in places that states and empires designate as locations for the instantiation of power can undermine policies of domination. In provincial Roman military bases, the presence of women, children, and the enslaved counteracted Rome's attempts to segregate and discipline fighting men ( Allison 2013 ). In nineteenth-century Australian penal colonies for women, collusion allowed women to have some access to their children, defying institutional attempts to deny incarcerated women their motherhood ( Casella 2012 ).
The spaces and places of everyday life, from domestic spaces, to parks, fields, market places, and craft workshops, etc., are fertile grounds for active resistance (e.g., Epperson 2000 , Marshall 2015 , Symonds 1999 ). Leading up to the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 in Colorado, women's housework was a subversive politics through which they struggled for change ( Larkin & McGuire 2009 , Wood 2002 ). The houses, food, and material culture of Fort San Juan, North Carolina, chronicle the deterioration of Native American–Spanish relations, which sparked the Joara to sack the fort just 18 months after it was built ( Beck et al. 2016 ). In the aftermath of the collapse of the pre-Columbian Zapotec state, ordinary people reused a piece of a monument depicting the face of a king to grind corn ( Joyce & Weller 2007 ). And in eighteenth-century Jamaica, street markets (or black markets) were part of the everyday lives of enslaved peoples who exchanged crafts and foods through these informal markets. However, these markets were not just economic in nature; they were also places where enslaved people met, passed on information, and developed social relations beyond the plantation, which at times enabled them to organize armed resistance, such as the rebellion of 1831 ( Hauser 2008 ).
The impact of culture clashes on everyday life provides an important arena to reevaluate the domain of political archaeology. Recent archaeological research illustrates how everyday life is not a lesser opposite of political life in a simplistic dichotomy of the private versus public spheres or domestic versus political domains. New research demonstrates how everyday life is central in the construction, operation, and contestation of political and power relations. Thus if archaeologists want to understand how power and politics work (or fail) they must incorporate everyday life into their analyses.
Situations of culture contact and colonial encounters in history and prehistory bring into particular relief taken-for-granted assumptions about how everyday life works. Out of these encounters “new traditions” emerge ( Pauketat 2001 ). These new traditions are not simply the result of accepting one or the other of two distinctive worldviews, as in structuralist models; they involve the making of new traditions by people across their everyday lives.
While dramatic catalysts are the traditional prime movers for societal change, it is certainly also the case that everyday life itself can be a catalyst for change. Recent everyday life research illustrates how social change happens throughout peoples’ daily lives as they accept and question, consciously or unconsciously, the meaning of existing social relations. The dynamic undercurrents of daily activities—the variations and contradictions that are inherent in the plurality of simultaneously occurring day-to-day practices—are instrumental in social change. Recent research refocuses archaeologists’ interpretive lens onto the ordinary events of human history that illustrate how people organized and changed their world.
The history of capitalism provides a case in point. The institution and expansion of capitalism have long been studied as large-scale economic transformations, but it is also true that capitalism arises from people's everyday practices and decisions. On both sides of the Atlantic, archaeologists have illustrated the everyday choices that led to the development and expansion of capitalism. Upper- and middle-class New Yorkers between 1790 and 1840 and middling classes in medieval and early modern England made daily choices in consumption, presentation, and work that fostered the development of capitalism ( Johnson 1996 , Wall 1994 ).
A new focus on consumption, and not just production, highlights the active role of everyday life in fostering societal change or stasis (e.g., Cowie 2011 , Horning 2000 , Khatchadourian 2016 , Kruczek-Aaron 2015 , Pyburn 2008 ). After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, while indigenous people did adopt Spanish ceramics, they used indigenous value systems to make their choices, shaping the very nature of colonial economies ( Rodríguez-Alegría 2016 ). With British colonialism in Belize, Maya adopted British nineteenth-century china but used it to make Maya cuisines, both expressing indigenous identities through food and accessing the broader colonial economy ( Church et al. 2011 ).
A critical contribution of everyday life studies in archaeology is its transformation of the broader field of economic archaeology. Production has long been the focus of economic archaeology; however, research on consumption is gaining momentum because consumption is not a passive phenomenon: The choices people make in consuming are implicated in the production and reproduction of ideas, information, and goods (e.g., Mullins 2011 , Smith 1999 ). Local taste preferences can guide people's choices in the adoption of new and foreign goods ( Stahl 2001 ). Everyday consumption is a fundamental engine of the economy. In addition, what people consume and produce for themselves is as important as what people produce for broader trade networks in understanding economic processes (e.g., Brumfiel 1991 , Hendon 1996 ).
Daily activities can have a profound effect on how households, communities, and societies operate. People's daily activities and interactions shape their social world and societies. When daily activities enhance dialogue, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration—be it in building projects in third millennium cities of Upper Mesopotamia ( Creekmore 2014 ) or incipient (e.g., Juarez 2018 ) or Classic Maya cities of Mexico (e.g., Hutson & Davies 2015 )—in-group solidarity is stimulated and can lead to the development of systems of power sharing and the stability of households and communities. In an example from my own research ( Robin 2013 ), daily practices in collaborative household work and conservation agriculture, alongside the multigenerational transmission of ecological knowledge and community-oriented social practices, allowed Maya farmers at Chan to develop a community that thrived for two millennia while nearby larger civic centers rose and fell. In the Banda region of Ghana, the daily decisions of farmers in crop production and consumption, such as intercropping “thirsty crops” with drought-tolerant species, allowed people to weather severe environmental disruptions, such as drought, in the periods prior to European incursions ( Logan 2016 ). Studying long-term practices of agriculture and food production and consumption through the archaeological record provides a powerful lens through which archaeology can contribute to understandings of what makes societies sustainable ( Fisher 2020 ).
A fundamental lesson of everyday life research is that things are not always as they appear: The mundane may be truly surprising and impactful. Be it the material culture of freedwoman, Lucy Foster, of Andover, Massachusetts ( Battle-Baptiste 2011 ), or that of ordinary pre-Columbian Maya farmers ( Robin 2013 , Sheets 2002 ), archaeological findings of ordinary people's material culture can challenge assumptions about the poverty and passivity of ordinary people. Although freedwoman Lucy Foster is listed in historical documents as being poor, the variety of pearlwear, redwear, creamwear, Chinese porcelain, delftware, jackfield ware, local stoneware, and whiteware in her possession belies her designation as a poor woman ( Battle-Baptiste 2011 , p. 129). Likewise, the identification of polychrome ceramics, cacao, jade, imported obsidian, exotic shell jewelry, and consistent health indicators of ordinary pre-Columbian Maya farmers questions their identification as an underclass, eking out an existence under the thumb of the state ( Robin 2013 , Sheets 2002 ). Everyday life studies illustrate that it can be fruitful to ask new types of questions of the archaeological record. Archeologists can ask what implications ordinary people's daily practices had for society and change (e.g., Bradley 2005 , Erickson 2006 , Robb 2007 , Robin 2013 , Rodriguez 2006 , Sheets 2002 , Walker 2011 , Yaeger 2000 ); how the daily lives of indigenous peoples impacted colonial relations (e.g., Oland et al. 2012 , Rodning et al. 2018 ); or how changes in the people's daily lives made it possible for leaders, centralization, and hierarchy to emerge (e.g., Hodder & Cessford 2004 , Joyce 2010 , Smith 2010 , Wilson 2008 ). Everyday life research demands that archaeologists investigate the lives of all peoples in society, particularly underrepresented people, because when we do not do so “dominant groups in contemporary society are free to depict them in any way they please” ( Brumfiel 1992 , p. 553).
New research in the archaeology of everyday life has furthered our understanding of how fundamental identities (e.g., gender, sexuality, class, race, ethnicity) are produced, reproduced, and passed on to the next generation or transformed through everyday processes. Studies of houses and households across the world and through time have cogently illustrated how learning about selves and societies happens each day within domestic settings. The material form of dwellings encodes and expresses broader societal expectations through which residents learn traditional values and expectations (e.g., Allison 1999 , Blanton 1994 , Greenberg 2011 , Grenville 2008 , Hendon 2010 , Robb 2007 ). The way houses communicate is not only through architecture, but also through interior spatial arrangements, exterior spaces, and household possessions. There is a mutually constituting relationship between the material form of a house and the social lives of its residents (e.g., Hutson 2010 , Johnson 2015 ). Living and acting in a house turn a house into a home (e.g., Chesson 2012 , Moore 2012 ). The reiterative rebuilding of houses one on top of the other, which produces mounds and tells that form in the archaeological record, creates material connections with past houses ( Overholtzer 2015 ). The wealth of ritual and religious objects commonly found in houses and workshops highlights how daily life is not opposed to ritual and religion but part of the process of the cocreation of belief systems (e.g., Bradley 2005 , Fowles 2013 , Kruczek-Aaron 2015 , Stahl 2015 ). And households can be repositories for the multigenerational transmission of ecological knowledge (e.g., Fisher 2014 ). Through living in a house, learning what is acceptable and unacceptable, formulating and testing new ideas, people come to know the world around them.
Feminist, Black feminist, gender, and sexuality studies opened the door to understanding the diversity of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, race, and other identities in households and societies (e.g., Battle-Baptiste 2011 , Brumfiel 1992 , Franklin 2001 , Joyce 2008 , Meskell & Joyce 2003 , Robin & Brumfiel 2008 , Voss 2008b ). Solely normative household groups populated neither the more recent past nor the ancient pasts: Plural households were more common than traditional scholarship originally perceived. The formation of identities through daily life is an active process that engages and creates this diversity. This diversity may be the gender, age, and kin diversity of deep prehistory (e.g., Altamura et al. 2018 , Fowler 2005 ) or the increasingly global diversity of more recent prehistory, history, and the recent past. In multicultural Roman Egypt, wealth, status, ethnic heritage, locality, and gender all played a role in how Egyptian, Greek, and Roman residents defined their identities through daily practices within their households ( Boozer 2015 ). In plural households and communities of Alaskan men, Indigenous Californian women, and Russian merchants at Fort Ross, California (1812–1841), daily practices, at multiple scales across the community, framed culture change and persistence. Russian managers organized the rhythms of daily life across Fort Ross by structuring the fort into discrete ethnic neighborhoods. Alaskan Alutiiq principles were employed in the organization of the Native Alaskan neighborhood and the construction of houses there. Kashaya Native Californian food preparation, cooking, and cleaning techniques defined daily practices within and outside of houses ( Lightfoot 2005 , Lightfoot et al. 1998 ). The daily struggles of identity formation in the past can have significant implications for identity today, as shown by the ethnogenesis of a Californio identity from the struggles of diverse people of African, indigenous, and Spanish descent who lived and worked at El Presidio de San Francisco (1776–1846) ( Voss 2008a ).
Life course studies exposed the significance of life stage in understanding situated daily experiences (e.g., Gilchrist 2012 ). The archaeology of childhood, in particular, has sought to identify children as important members of households who not only play, but also play an active role in processes of socialization that are central in social reproduction and its transformation (e.g., Baxter 2005 , Crawford et al. 2018 , De Lucia 2010 , Overholtzer 2012 ). Senior members of society can become generational and gender mediators in their communities, such as African American midwives in the late nineteenth century ( Wilkie 2003 ). Following Emancipation, Lucrecia Perryman embarked on the vocation of midwifery to teach mothering across generations and transmit cultural practices rooted in an African past as well as transmit innovation ( Wilkie 2003 , pp. 79–118). Even in death, quotidian life has a role to play as people can carry their daily lives with them in death through the objects they bring with them and through the physical traces of repetitive daily activities in their bones (e.g., Aranda et al. 2009 , Wesp 2015 ).
The socializing materiality of everyday life extends beyond houses to all the spaces, places, and activities of daily life. Pathways, be they evidenced by footprints and tread marks, or through chemical signatures and microartifact distributions, illustrate the repetitive daily movement of people and their associations and connections with others in their world (e.g., Altamura et al. 2018 , Robin 2002 , Sheets 2011 , Snead et al. 2009 , Özbal 2012 ). Daily activities such as cooking, storing, eating, cleaning, and craft production provide fertile arenas for developing identities.
Food studies in archaeology illustrate that obtaining food is not just a central need of daily life. Preparing and consuming food with others are key aspects of identity formation that can shape and reinforce power relations and gender, class, ethnicity, and other differences in society (e.g., Ebeling & Rowan 2004 , Graff & Rodríguez-Alegría 2012 , Hastorf 2016 , VanDerwarker & Wilson 2015 ). Even something as seemingly simple as how and with whom people collect firewood for cooking shapes the organization of social life (e.g., Morehart & Helmke 2008 , Picornell-Gelabert & Servera-Vives 2017 ). Who sits at the head of the table or who carves the meat can express social hierarchies, and likewise sharing meals in large bowls can express social solidarity (e.g., Wall 1994 ).
As with food, crafting is central to identity making. Indeed, Gokee & Logan (2014) have argued for the utility of taking a holistic approach to studying food and craft practices together to understand situated everyday experiences. Although the field of craft production originally focused on specialized production and workshops, recent research has emphasized the importance of attending to daily life for understanding craft production (e.g., Hendon 1996 , 2010 ; Hirth 2009 ; Morehart & De Lucia 2015 ; Pyburn 2008 ). Domestic multicrafting or complementary crafting was fundamental to economic development, be it in the pre-Aztec world ( De Lucia 2013 ) or precolonial Africa ( Stahl 2016 ). The day-to-day tasks of craft production and the interactions of and training of craft producers create central dynamics not only for making objects, but also for learning about identities. In the pre-Columbian Aztec case, girls learned to weave from their mothers and older sisters in their homes ( Hendon 2010 , pp. 129–35). The backstrap loom could be scaled down to their size. As young girls learned to hold their bodies in particular ways to develop their craft, through the repetitive day-to-day acts of weaving, they shaped their bodies and selves as Aztec women and weavers. The gradual and long-term physical activities of daily life affect not only people's social identities, but also human bodies as is visible in osteological imprints of repetitive daily activities ( Wesp 2015 ).
Far from mundane, the materials, spaces, and activities of daily life constitute the bedrock of learning instrumental in the production and reproduction of selves and societies. An archaeology of everyday life pushes the field beyond faceless structuralist models of social reproduction toward active analyses of the daily constitution of identities by a diverse populace.
Central to archaeological research is the question of change: How and why do cultures, societies, and people's lives change? Dramatic catalysts such as culture contact, conquest, colonialism, and imperialism are traditional prime movers for societal change. Clashing cultures can throw into particular relief the taken-for-granteds of everyday life that may not be comparable between two cultures.
Although often overlooked, because daily life can be considered a bastion for the reproduction of tradition, colonizers and victors can target, often intentionally so, the everyday in an attempt to stifle the maintenance of traditions by colonized or conquered peoples that could be seen as threatening to new structures of power. The entire structure of indigenous villages and the spatial organization of daily activities were reoriented in colonial Alta California to protect women from rape and persecution ( Voss 2000 ). Indigenous lifeways can be as pivotal as those of conquering groups in shaping societies after conquest (e.g., Oland et al. 2012 , Rodning et al. 2018 ). However, culture contact does not always result in social change, as in the case of the early Swahili trade village of Tumbe's incorporation into Indian Ocean trade, which did not result in major alterations to community life ( Fleisher & LaViolette 2013 ).
Two now classic examples from the expansions of the pre-Columbian Aztec and Inca empires in Central and South America, respectively, illustrate how tribute demands in empire building transformed daily life and gender relations. In the case of Aztec imperial expansion, workloads increased to meet tribute demands. Women and girls living in the Valley of Mexico intensified their cooking practices by investing in the laborious process of tortilla making to satisfy mobile agricultural and market labor forces ( Brumfiel 1991 ). In the case of Inca imperial expansion, women intensified maize beer production while at the same time seeing their status in politics and power decline ( Hastorf 1991 ).
Even under the most oppressive conditions, daily life does not simply acquiesce to transformations in society and dominant powers; it can alternatively, or simultaneously, act back on broader societal processes (e.g., Leone et al. 2005 , Yamin 2005 ). In the aforementioned case of Aztec imperial expansion, although women and girls were forced into laborious work to satisfy tribute demands, they did not blindly accept the dominant Aztec ideology: Their use of figurines illustrates no enthusiasm for the dominant ideology ( Brumfiel 1996 ). In Upper Mesopotamia, people living under Neo-Assyrian rule did not fully conform to official dictates of settled agrarian lifeways. Semi-nomadic pastoralism at Tušhan, a provincial capital, illustrates the slippages between a Neo-Assyrian agrarian ideal and actual agrarian practice ( Rosenzweig 2016 ). In the Armenian settlement of Tsaghkahovit, the community's partly concealed semisubterranean architecture provided spaces that simultaneously limited the efficacy of imperial Achaemenid Persian expansion and extended the reach of its sovereignty ( Khatchadourian 2016 ). Daily life in a Pennsylvania coal-mining town, the shanty enclaves of immigrant coal workers, and the 1897 Lattimer Massacre of 19 striking immigrant mine workers illustrate how capitalism's promise of progress is inseparable from its destructive cycles ( Roller 2018 ).
The simple presence of underrepresented peoples in places that states and empires designate as locations for the instantiation of power can undermine policies of domination. In provincial Roman military bases, the presence of women, children, and the enslaved counteracted Rome's attempts to segregate and discipline fighting men ( Allison 2013 ). In nineteenth-century Australian penal colonies for women, collusion allowed women to have some access to their children, defying institutional attempts to deny incarcerated women their motherhood ( Casella 2012 ).
The spaces and places of everyday life, from domestic spaces, to parks, fields, market places, and craft workshops, etc., are fertile grounds for active resistance (e.g., Epperson 2000 , Marshall 2015 , Symonds 1999 ). Leading up to the Ludlow Massacre of 1914 in Colorado, women's housework was a subversive politics through which they struggled for change ( Larkin & McGuire 2009 , Wood 2002 ). The houses, food, and material culture of Fort San Juan, North Carolina, chronicle the deterioration of Native American–Spanish relations, which sparked the Joara to sack the fort just 18 months after it was built ( Beck et al. 2016 ). In the aftermath of the collapse of the pre-Columbian Zapotec state, ordinary people reused a piece of a monument depicting the face of a king to grind corn ( Joyce & Weller 2007 ). And in eighteenth-century Jamaica, street markets (or black markets) were part of the everyday lives of enslaved peoples who exchanged crafts and foods through these informal markets. However, these markets were not just economic in nature; they were also places where enslaved people met, passed on information, and developed social relations beyond the plantation, which at times enabled them to organize armed resistance, such as the rebellion of 1831 ( Hauser 2008 ).
The impact of culture clashes on everyday life provides an important arena to reevaluate the domain of political archaeology. Recent archaeological research illustrates how everyday life is not a lesser opposite of political life in a simplistic dichotomy of the private versus public spheres or domestic versus political domains. New research demonstrates how everyday life is central in the construction, operation, and contestation of political and power relations. Thus if archaeologists want to understand how power and politics work (or fail) they must incorporate everyday life into their analyses.
Situations of culture contact and colonial encounters in history and prehistory bring into particular relief taken-for-granted assumptions about how everyday life works. Out of these encounters “new traditions” emerge ( Pauketat 2001 ). These new traditions are not simply the result of accepting one or the other of two distinctive worldviews, as in structuralist models; they involve the making of new traditions by people across their everyday lives.
While dramatic catalysts are the traditional prime movers for societal change, it is certainly also the case that everyday life itself can be a catalyst for change. Recent everyday life research illustrates how social change happens throughout peoples’ daily lives as they accept and question, consciously or unconsciously, the meaning of existing social relations. The dynamic undercurrents of daily activities—the variations and contradictions that are inherent in the plurality of simultaneously occurring day-to-day practices—are instrumental in social change. Recent research refocuses archaeologists’ interpretive lens onto the ordinary events of human history that illustrate how people organized and changed their world.
The history of capitalism provides a case in point. The institution and expansion of capitalism have long been studied as large-scale economic transformations, but it is also true that capitalism arises from people's everyday practices and decisions. On both sides of the Atlantic, archaeologists have illustrated the everyday choices that led to the development and expansion of capitalism. Upper- and middle-class New Yorkers between 1790 and 1840 and middling classes in medieval and early modern England made daily choices in consumption, presentation, and work that fostered the development of capitalism ( Johnson 1996 , Wall 1994 ).
A new focus on consumption, and not just production, highlights the active role of everyday life in fostering societal change or stasis (e.g., Cowie 2011 , Horning 2000 , Khatchadourian 2016 , Kruczek-Aaron 2015 , Pyburn 2008 ). After the Spanish conquest of Mexico, while indigenous people did adopt Spanish ceramics, they used indigenous value systems to make their choices, shaping the very nature of colonial economies ( Rodríguez-Alegría 2016 ). With British colonialism in Belize, Maya adopted British nineteenth-century china but used it to make Maya cuisines, both expressing indigenous identities through food and accessing the broader colonial economy ( Church et al. 2011 ).
A critical contribution of everyday life studies in archaeology is its transformation of the broader field of economic archaeology. Production has long been the focus of economic archaeology; however, research on consumption is gaining momentum because consumption is not a passive phenomenon: The choices people make in consuming are implicated in the production and reproduction of ideas, information, and goods (e.g., Mullins 2011 , Smith 1999 ). Local taste preferences can guide people's choices in the adoption of new and foreign goods ( Stahl 2001 ). Everyday consumption is a fundamental engine of the economy. In addition, what people consume and produce for themselves is as important as what people produce for broader trade networks in understanding economic processes (e.g., Brumfiel 1991 , Hendon 1996 ).
Daily activities can have a profound effect on how households, communities, and societies operate. People's daily activities and interactions shape their social world and societies. When daily activities enhance dialogue, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration—be it in building projects in third millennium cities of Upper Mesopotamia ( Creekmore 2014 ) or incipient (e.g., Juarez 2018 ) or Classic Maya cities of Mexico (e.g., Hutson & Davies 2015 )—in-group solidarity is stimulated and can lead to the development of systems of power sharing and the stability of households and communities. In an example from my own research ( Robin 2013 ), daily practices in collaborative household work and conservation agriculture, alongside the multigenerational transmission of ecological knowledge and community-oriented social practices, allowed Maya farmers at Chan to develop a community that thrived for two millennia while nearby larger civic centers rose and fell. In the Banda region of Ghana, the daily decisions of farmers in crop production and consumption, such as intercropping “thirsty crops” with drought-tolerant species, allowed people to weather severe environmental disruptions, such as drought, in the periods prior to European incursions ( Logan 2016 ). Studying long-term practices of agriculture and food production and consumption through the archaeological record provides a powerful lens through which archaeology can contribute to understandings of what makes societies sustainable ( Fisher 2020 ).
A fundamental lesson of everyday life research is that things are not always as they appear: The mundane may be truly surprising and impactful. Be it the material culture of freedwoman, Lucy Foster, of Andover, Massachusetts ( Battle-Baptiste 2011 ), or that of ordinary pre-Columbian Maya farmers ( Robin 2013 , Sheets 2002 ), archaeological findings of ordinary people's material culture can challenge assumptions about the poverty and passivity of ordinary people. Although freedwoman Lucy Foster is listed in historical documents as being poor, the variety of pearlwear, redwear, creamwear, Chinese porcelain, delftware, jackfield ware, local stoneware, and whiteware in her possession belies her designation as a poor woman ( Battle-Baptiste 2011 , p. 129). Likewise, the identification of polychrome ceramics, cacao, jade, imported obsidian, exotic shell jewelry, and consistent health indicators of ordinary pre-Columbian Maya farmers questions their identification as an underclass, eking out an existence under the thumb of the state ( Robin 2013 , Sheets 2002 ). Everyday life studies illustrate that it can be fruitful to ask new types of questions of the archaeological record. Archeologists can ask what implications ordinary people's daily practices had for society and change (e.g., Bradley 2005 , Erickson 2006 , Robb 2007 , Robin 2013 , Rodriguez 2006 , Sheets 2002 , Walker 2011 , Yaeger 2000 ); how the daily lives of indigenous peoples impacted colonial relations (e.g., Oland et al. 2012 , Rodning et al. 2018 ); or how changes in the people's daily lives made it possible for leaders, centralization, and hierarchy to emerge (e.g., Hodder & Cessford 2004 , Joyce 2010 , Smith 2010 , Wilson 2008 ). Everyday life research demands that archaeologists investigate the lives of all peoples in society, particularly underrepresented people, because when we do not do so “dominant groups in contemporary society are free to depict them in any way they please” ( Brumfiel 1992 , p. 553).

Section: FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Research on everyday life in archaeology has expanded to illustrate the impactful lives of people in the past. Everyday life research will only grow further in the future. Future everyday life research can realize its broadest impact by using studies of everyday life to reconstruct the lives of traditionally neglected social groups, demystify grand narratives of human history, and improve archaeological practice.
A focus on everyday life underscores the crucial role that archaeologists can play in reconstructing the lost voices of traditionally neglected social groups. The materiality of the archaeological record is a critical and unique resource that distinguishes the field from other disciplines. Because everyone over the course of their day-to-day life leaves some material traces in the archaeological record, archaeology is well suited to push everyday life research beyond the constraints of textual sources that often record grand narratives and often are written by and for elites. Textual records can leave out the histories of ordinary people, and when they do discuss ordinary people, they often do so from an indirect perspective.
The archaeological traces of underrepresented peoples’ daily lives can provide the missing social information to understand the past and produce democratic understandings of how society operates. Developing everyday studies fulfills archaeology's promise to investigate the 99% ( Sabloff 2019 , Sheets 2002 ). It provides the evidence to answer a wide range of calls across the social sciences to diversify and democratize our understanding of human history. Archaeologies of everyday life give history to the “people without history” (sensu Wolf 1982 ). They reveal hidden transcripts (the social perspectives developed by members of society through their lived experiences), which are omitted from public transcripts (the overt and public representations of social life inscribed in the text, art, and architecture of society's dominant groups) (sensu Scott 1990 ). And they foreground histories of “common heroes” (sensu de Certeau 1984 ), ordinary people doing ordinary things in the process of history. If we understand the full range of people in the past, we produce better understandings of human history.
Grand narratives of human history present narratives of a society as dependent on broader powers and dynamics, denying and mystifying the things people do and the structural causes that develop through everyday actions. By illustrating how everyday life is a haven for both the reproduction of tradition and the production of innovation, everyday life researchers can demystify grand narratives of human history and put people and their lives into the center stage of historical developments.
Grand narratives simplify the messy and complex engagements that everyday life highlights, enabling top-down paradigms of historical causality. In this sense, archaeologies of everyday life are aligned with broader social theories that propose critical studies of the quotidian as a foundation for understanding human societies, such as practice, feminist, Marxist, critical, and postcolonial theories [e.g., Bourdieu 1977 ; de Certeau 1984 ; Ingold 2011 ; Lefebvre 2008 ( 1958 , 1961 , 1981 ); Scott 1990 ; Smith 1987 ]. What archaeologies of everyday life powerfully have to add to broader social theories is their attention to ordinary objects and spaces. Given that ordinary objects and spatial arrangements formalize how people learn about themselves and their world, archaeology is in a unique position to further social theoretical discussions of the importance of everyday life in human societies. Using archaeology to explore “situated experiences of material life” is an area where archaeology can make significant contributions to social theory ( Preucel & Meskell 2004 , pp. 3–4).
Taking an everyday life approach can improve the practice of archaeology in two significant ways: through the development of robust methods to gain deeper insights into past people's lives and through attention to enhancing the everyday practice of archaeology to better engage the stakeholders and broader publics interested in archaeological research. Understanding everyday life in the past and engaging with everyday life in the present can be mutually fruitful endeavors for the field.
Studies of everyday life promote a close engagement between theory and methods in archaeology, particularly in terms of the development and incorporation of new and existing micromethods of scientific analysis that can reveal more detailed information on past daily life. Everyday life cannot be understood at an abstract level, and its study is deeply committed to furthering empirical analyses. Daily life research provides a healthy bridge between the “two cultures” of academia: science and humanism ( Jones 2002 ). New microscientific methods are allowing even more fine-grained analyses of daily life than are accessible through macroarchaeological methods. Microartifact, soil chemistry, and micromorphology studies identify previously invisible areas of activity. Paleoethnobotany reveals food and environment. Isotopic and ancient DNA studies expose relationships and movement of people and animals. Archaeometric sourcing techniques develop object biographies (e.g., De Lucia 2013 , Dussubieux et al. 2016 , Hodder & Cessford 2004 , Marston et al. 2015 ).
Addressing daily life in the past can lead to fruitful engagements and collaborations with stakeholder communities in the present and draw attention to the ethics of the daily practice of archaeological research in the contemporary world. Just as everyday life studies provide a profitable way to counter dominant narratives about ancient societies, critical engagement with nonacademics today can counteract insularity and provide corrective insights for academic knowledge. Developing community partnerships focused on understanding everyday life highlights the conjoined interests of archaeologists and stakeholders and increases participation in the archaeological research process and cultural preservation.
Attending to everyday life in the past has a role to play in addressing social issues in the present and future. As we uncover through archaeology how ancient people addressed, accepted, and transformed the world around them across their everyday lives, archaeologists illustrate the ways that everyday life today can be a powerful mechanism for social change. Expanding archaeologists’ everyday engagements with stakeholder communities enhances our field, expands our reach, and produces more informative archaeologies (e.g., Atalay 2012 , Bruchac et al. 2016 , Colwell-Chanthaphonh & Ferguson 2007 , Pyburn 2009 , Silliman 2008 ).
Writing about everyday life in a way that is intelligible to everyday life additionally furthers public archaeology. Some everyday life researchers intentionally develop clarity and jargon-free writing as a vehicle for communicating information about past everyday life (e.g., Battle-Baptiste 2011 , Deetz 1977 , Ebeling 2010 , Hodder 2011 , Joyce 2010 , Lightfoot 2005 , Martelle et al. 2018 , Robin 2013 , Smith 2010 ). Others propose a data-based narrative approach that uses fictionalized accounts grounded in a rigorous analysis to present everyday life (e.g., Greene 2018 , Hollenbach & Carmody 2018 , Tringham 1991 ).
Understanding everyday life in the past matters because what people do on a daily basis is central in the construction of selves and societies. As researchers gain better insights into everyday life in the past and enhance the practice of archaeology in daily life today, the field moves toward a broader actualization of presenting democratic pasts. Everyday life research pushes archaeology toward better understandings of the diversity of people in the past. In so doing it illustrates the instrumental transformations that daily life engenders.

Everyday life research pushes archaeology toward better understandings of the diversity of people in the past. In so doing it illustrates the instrumental transformations that daily life engenders.

Section: acknowledgments

I thank Jason Yaeger, Matthew Johnson, Mark Hauser, Amanda Logan, Rana Özbal, Melissa Rosenzweig, and René Rivera for comments, conversations, and references that benefited this article and influenced my thinking about everyday life. Given space limitations, I was not able to cite all the authors and important new research in the archaeology of everyday life. To achieve breadth, I tried to highlight one or two works per author cited; thus even for authors cited, there is a deeper collection of writing on the topic.
