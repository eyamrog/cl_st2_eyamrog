Section: ABSTRACT

The twenty-first century has witnessed a surge of scholarship at the sometimes-perilously sharp edge of anthropology and Native American and Indigenous studies. This review sets forth from a disciplinary conjuncture of the early 2000s, when anthropology newly engaged with the topic of sovereignty, which had long been the focus of American Indian studies, and when the long-standing anthropological interest in colonialism was reshaped by Indigenous studies attention to the distinctive form labeled settler colonialism. Scholars working at this edge address political relationality as both concept and methodology. Anthropologists, in turn, have contributed to Indigenous studies a commitment to territorially grounded and community-based research and theory building. After outlining the conjuncture and its methodological entailments, the review turns to two directions in scholarship: reinvigorated ethnographic research on environment and on culture and economy. It concludes with reflection on the implications of this conjuncture for anthropological epistemology and disciplinary formation.

Section: INTRODUCTION

This review sets forth from a disciplinary conjuncture of the early 2000s and proceeds to the present, describing and analyzing transformations in the ways that anthropology has addressed indigeneity, sovereignty and settler colonialism, and the interdisciplinary field of Native American and Indigenous studies. 1
Let us take you back to 2004. The theme of the biannual conference of the Society for Cultural Anthropology was “Sovereignty.” Held in a Portland, Oregon, hotel whose key cards featured an image of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the conference contributed to the ascendance in American anthropology of the Italian political philosopher Giorgio Agamben's writings on sovereignty. His book Homo Sacer : Sovereign Power and Bare Life ( Agamben 1998 ) had been translated into English and published in the United States in 1998. The United States was at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and social scientists struggled to explain emergent post-9/11 forms of power. Agamben, more than Foucault, offered tools for explaining the indefinite detentions at Guantanamo Bay and the tortures at Abu Ghraib prison. Soon, sovereignty was ubiquitous in anthropology: in dissertation proposals, grant applications, and graduate student research papers (see Hansen & Stepputat 2006 ).
This moment was confounding for scholars working with, from, and for Indigenous communities, especially in the United States and Canada, where sovereignty—legally understood as jurisdiction over territory and people and more broadly understood as political authority and distinctiveness—had long been a key politico-legal principle and, often, a household term. These anthropologists had previously received decidedly mixed, and more often negative, signals about sovereignty's relevance to the anthropology of Native North America. More than a vexing story of scholarly trends, sovereignty's ascendance was confounding in a specific and telling way: Even as anthropology embraced the concept of sovereignty via Agamben, few scholars looked to Indigenous political theories of sovereignty. Nor, in their theorization of sovereignty, did they look to the conditions of dispossession, war, and genocide from which Indigenous peoples were still recovering in parts of North America. These experiences of dispossession and war have been accounted for as genocide ( Kiernan 2007 , Woolford et al. 2014 ) and have formed a critical point of analysis for scholars working in the wake of that experience ( Miranda 2012 , Risling Baldy 2018 ). And yet, in the anthropology of Native North America, these processes took the form of salvage ( Redman 2021 ). Although sometimes very disinterested in the coloniality of the nineteenth century, ethnographic interest in the aftermath of these processes dovetailed with ongoing dispossession and governance directly in early anthropological careers and scholarship. 2 Meanwhile, “sovereignty” allowed Indigenous peoples to hang on to their lands and lives, and, as such, it would preoccupy the American Indian studies (AIS) literature beginning in the late 1960s.
This divergence between anthropology and AIS when it came to investigating both Indigenous and settler forms of sovereignty was the case despite, or perhaps as a symptom of, American anthropology's long focus on Native America. This conundrum of sovereignty being an analytic for some (i.e., AIS) and not for others (i.e., anthropology) was indicative of political anthropology's focus on the elsewhere of colonialism, the state, and, later, the biopolitical.
Meanwhile, trenchant analyses of distinctive forms of power in societies such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand congealed in Indigenous studies and comparative history. As this review discusses, a generation of Indigenous studies scholars theorized sovereignty, settler colonialism, and related political formations while also enacting epistemological commitments to knowledge production and institution building at universities, in professional associations, on editorial boards, and in museums.
In the throes of this conjuncture, the early 2000s marked two interrelated transformations at the intersection of anthropology and AIS: the reworking of anthropological scholarship about indigeneity and settler colonialism, through and with fundamental critique led by Indigenous scholars; and the rapid expansion of Native American and Indigenous studies as a field with a new, global scholarly association, the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association (NAISA).
This review first explains this conjuncture and attendant transformations, which were just under way in 2005 when Strong published her Annual Review of Anthropology article, “Recent Ethnographic Research on North American Indigenous Peoples” ( Strong 2005 ). This article then proceeds to chart major epistemological, methodological, and thematic developments at these disciplinary intersections during the intervening years. In addition to focusing on sovereignty, relationality, and settler colonialism, it highlights development in research on the environment and on culture and economy. Because of the shape of this conjuncture, this review focuses primarily, though not exclusively, on scholarship addressing indigeneity in the United States and Canada.

Section: PART I: THE STRUCTURE OF THE CONJUNCTURE: SOVEREIGNTY, POLITICAL RELATIONALITY, SETTLER COLONIALISM

Ethnographies published in the 2000s express a fluorescence of anthropological and interdisciplinary approaches to Indigenous sovereignty and nation, variously described relationally as entangled ( Dennison 2012 ), interdependent ( Cattelino 2008 ), and nested ( Simpson 2014 ). Indigenous political positionality was described as “relational autonomy” ( Maaka & Fleras 2005 , p. 20). Sovereignty was further expanded beyond the notion of territory and formal law and politics, analyzed as “visual” ( Dowell 2013 , Rickard 1995 ) and “economic” ( Lewis 2019 ), as compromised insofar as it is “need-based” ( Cattelino 2010 ), and as “work” in the context of American Indian labor ( Kamper 2010 ). Ethnographies of twenty-first-century Indigenous communities and peoples have focused on questions of governance and nation building, as in Lambert's (2007) Choctaw Nation: A Story of American Indian Resurgence , and the effects that dispossession and the ongoing processes of colonialism have wrought upon politics. These include ethnographies of claims and governance that have focused on the health of land ( Willow 2012 ) and water ( Hoover 2017 ), land claims ( Nadasdy 2003 ) and jurisdiction ( Pasternak 2017 ), the linguistics of jurisprudence ( Richland 2008 ), the politics of race and recognition ( Blu 2001 , Klopotek 2011 , Miller 2003 , Sturm 2011 ), political consciousness ( Fowler 2002 ), and the presuppositions of sovereignty itself ( Nadasdy 2017 ).
These texts demonstrate that Indigenous interlocutors have stretched the received structures of tribal governance, land claims processes, and tribal courts to include Indigenous languages and interpretations. Dennison's (2012) Colonial Entanglement: Constituting a Twenty-First-Century Osage Nation ethnographically examines an Osage Nation constitutional reform process to show how governance both reflects the legacy of colonialism in the structure of nationhood and also opens up new horizons for sovereignty. Biolsi (2021) takes up Lakota principles and interpretations of law in his analysis of “the treaty imaginary,” which for Lakota interlocuters takes treaties to be original agreements and modes of political relationship that, although frequently abrogated by the state, are maintained and may “trouble the colonial order of things” (p. 240). Sturm's (2002) Blood Politics: Race, Culture, and Identity in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma , resonating with Blu's [2001 (1980)] earlier ethnography of Lumbee identity forged partly in relations with other groups, shows the contradiction and persistence of Cherokee ideas of race and blood that simultaneously adopt and challenge American hegemonic racial formations. Anthropologists and other scholars of race, science, and citizenship ( Kauanui 2008 , Klopotek 2011 , TallBear 2013 ) have revealed how biological science may operate in an adversarial relationship to indigenous polities as self-governing and self-determining nations. Sturm (2011) analyzed how American settlers aim to incorporate, domesticate, and inhabit indigeneity, especially Cherokee. These studies have moved analysis of “identity” away from a mode of modern self-fashioning by describing its calibration to processes of colonial governance and Indigenous self-determination.
“Self-determination” has concerned scholars of transnational Indigenous rights movements beyond the states that claim their land ( Silva 2004 , p. 36; Monture 2015 , pp. 116–33). Recent decades have seen Indigenous peoples articulate claims in terms of international human rights, a process Speed (2007) powerfully analyzed for Zapatista claims. This global turn has marked, as Carpenter & Riley (2014) argue, a “jurisgenerative moment.” Muehlebach (2001) described this turn as an underexamined “transnational cultural and political movement” (p. 416), as a form of placemaking. Niezen (2003) took up the variety of strategies in play for extraterritorial claims to justice in his ethnography of Indigenous politics at the United Nations. Million's (2013) Therapeutic Nations analyzed the relationship between the United Nations and Indigenous claims for justice as a fundamental “impossibility.” Here, she argues, a “claim [to Indigenous self-determination] causes all parties to fiercely articulate what the substance of their nations…will be. Thus, there is an agonistic heart to the self-determination Indigenous peoples affectively work out, a site of ‘intimate,’ painful political, social, and personal conundrums with the state” (p. 4). Lightfoot (2016) , nonetheless, charts Indigenous organizing at the United Nations as successes, a “subtle revolution,” and Callison (2014) shows how the Inuit Circumpolar Council supported human rights claims that gave climate change “a human face” and linked it to Inuit self-determination. In the Canadian context, Hamilton (2009) asks how indigeneity comes to matter to law. Barker (2021) , however, highlights how the United States and Canada deploy the (international) discourse of terrorism in extreme responses to Indigenous mobilizations for justice, including the #NoDAPL and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movements.
Recent calls to return to relationships and relationality, as objects of analysis and research methodology alike ( Moreton-Robinson 2017 , TallBear 2018 ), have productive potential to inform what some may see as a bedrock of anthropological theory: kinship as an ordering principle of society itself. In TallBear's (2018) work grounded in Tiyospaye, the idea of Dakota family that spreads beyond biological kin, one sees an arc from E.C. Deloria's (1988) fictionalized ethnography Waterlily 3 : the necessity and expansiveness of family beyond blood. Relationality is a concept foregrounding human and nonhuman relations and obligations that are rooted in precontact social organization and governance structures but that also are sustained through solidarity ( Yazzie & Risling Baldy 2018 ). “Relationality” in Native American and Indigenous studies not only insists on the “political” in “ecology,” but also, conversely, grounds the political in territorial relationality (see Part III below). Relationality is a distinct political theory of the link between sovereignty and territory, which in classic Euro-American political theory has coupled the sovereign body to control over territory rather than being a relative to territory. Similarly, “identity” as a matter of reterritorialized subjectivity also looked to the city as a “hub” for the construction of Indigenous selves in relation to each other and their homelands, rather than as a site of assimilative loss ( Ramirez 2007 ). All of this engagement with sovereignty, territory, and relationality concerns care and its contradictions. Dhillon's (2017) Prairie Rising takes up the governmentalization of care and its intervention in the lives of Indigenous youth in crisis. Stevenson's (2014) analysis of Inuit life (and death) under a regime of state “care” moves beyond rights into episodic and affective moments of loss.
“Sovereignty” explains the particular focus of Indigenous research in North America because of the treaty-based (nation-to-nation) agreements ( Stark 2016 ) that, on the one hand, recognize Indigenous peoples as distinct political orders ( Asch 1997 , Castile 2006 , Nesper 2002 ), but, on the other hand, also mark the appearance of Native people as they come into ethnographic life as racialized subjects of cultural decline ( Simpson 2018 ). Indigenous peoples appear anthropologically just as they are thought to be disappearing [ Morgan 1962 (1851) ], tangling with waves of colonization: missions, armies, geographers, biological science, courts, and then anthropologists. This process of settlement—of settling land physically and legally—moves territory out of the hands of Indigenous peoples while also moving these groups out of the way in order to put that land in others’ hands.
This settler colonial replacement is paradigmatically described in the writings of Wolfe (1999 , 2006 ) and has also been documented in Indigenous political analysis [ Cook-Lynn 2012 , V. Deloria Jr. 1969 , Trask 1999 (1993) ]. As Sturm (2017) argued, “[A]ny consideration of what sovereignty has come to mean in Native North America, as a conceptual framework that names a particular kind of lived indigenous experience, has to be understood within the context of settler colonialism. Yet anthropology has been slow to take up settler colonialism as a key analytic, even though the discipline has long been engaged with understanding different types of colonial orders” (p. 340).
It is in the context of settler statecraft that Indigenous peoples were redefined as race-like or racialized “populations” rather than political orders ( Kauanui 2008 , Sturm 2002 ). This move to recognize indigeneity as race-like or raced by an emergent settler state has been gendered. The consequence is that Indigenous nationalist movements organized to resist the state's impositions also risked reproducing heteropatriarchy, as Kauanui (2018) shows for the Hawaiian kingdom movement. Morgensen's (2011) analysis of gendered violence explains the relationship between ideological and bodily force against lands, bodies, and genders in the project of civilization, whereas Simpson (2016) clarifies how Indigenous women's deaths are profoundly tied to the life of settler sovereignty. Indigenous populations were, by the closing of the frontier and their 1924 entry into American citizenship, deemed subjects civilized enough to be admitted into the body politic with rights equivalent to those who came after them ( Bruyneel 2007 ).
This settler colonial process of dispossession–subjection–inclusion was, in turn, mediated through the idiom of sovereignty. It remains the legal holdover from the treaty era and the primary means for dealing with nation-states that are predicated upon Indigenous movement away from land, what Sturm (2017) has described as “a specific discursive response to living under conditions of settler colonialism” (p. 341). The framework of settler colonial studies articulates to the twenty-first-century critique of anthropology undertaken by Indigenous scholars, and temporality is key. Settler colonialism operates as more than a historical formation that periodizes the past beyond an imagined break with coloniality ( Nichols 2020 ); as an analytic, it helps to account for the fundamental struggle of maintaining life and land under conditions that disavow the ongoing presence of indigeneity as well as the coloniality of the relation ( Bruyneel 2021 ). Weiss's (2018) ethnography Shaping the Future on Haida Gwaii: Life beyond Settler Colonialism focuses on how Haida people, despite being, and in part because they are, constrained by settler colonialism, commit the day-to-day radical act of making a future.
Anthropology and political theory are now catching up and incorporating Indigenous political and scholarly work that analyzed settler colonial processes, albeit in different terms, years before the term was coined. Part of this lag is due to a prior gulf between Indigenous scholarly work and anthropology. This distance was named with V. Deloria Jr.’s (1969) foundational critique of anthropology in Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto , which parodied the gulf between the imperatives of Indigenous communities and ethnographic research. That critique was precipitated by the fraught historical relationship that anthropology had with Native peoples, a relationship that included Boas's theft of Indigenous bones for science ( Cole 1985 ) and Kroeber's museological relationship to Ishi ( Starn 2005 ). This cultural and corporeal imperative to salvage morphed into a form of advocacy that argued for the legal termination of federal Indian status for the Shoshone by Steward ( Blackhawk 1997 ) and Fletcher's pivotal role in the privatization and alienation of lands through allotment at Nez Perce ( Tonkovich 2012 ). The twenty-first century saw profound disagreements between Haudenosaunee and anthropologists regarding wampum belts, ceremonial masks, and, later, the origins of the US constitution itself ( Landsman & Ciborski 1992 ). The tumult of those relations—animated by notions of “salvage” as much as material relations of taking ( Moreton-Robinson 2015 )—reached its apex in the critique by V. Deloria Jr. and then the 20-year near standstill in ethnographic research in Indigenous communities in North America. This standstill was not the case in the Pacific, where anthropology continued, albeit with deep critiques of the discipline ( Trask 1991 ), along with American military and general occupation of the islands ( Tengan 2008 , Tengan et al. 2010 ).
It was as if the field stopped dawdling with the benign language of cultural change and transformation once that process was named as settler colonial. Wolfe (1999 , 2006 ) trained his eye on the ways in which the desire for territory and settler emplacement rendered Indigenous peoples as matter to be removed. Removal included not only territory but also distinct ways of being and relating: Whereas anthropologists and historians previously focused on acculturation and assimilation as matters of cultural loss, the focus shifted to how such power/knowledge formations themselves reproduced the logics of settler colonialism. This process of removal or “elimination” for settlement found a complicit relationship in Australian anthropology ( Wolfe 1999 ). The desire for land in settler colonial projects, Wolfe held, was distinct from those that sought labor, as territory was “settler colonialism's irreducible element” ( Wolfe 2006 , p. 388). This clean land/labor binary has been challenged by the record of Indigenous enslavement ( Ethridge & Shuck-Hall 2009 , Reséndez 2016 ) and wage labor ( Kamper 2010 ). Wolfe's powerful analysis has also been criticized for centering particular geographies—the United States, Canada, New Zealand/Aotearoa, and Australia, rather than South Africa, Latin America, and Europe, for example—to the analytical project's global reach ( Castellanos 2017 , Kelley 2017 , Speed 2019 ). Speed (2019) has argued for the extension of settler colonial studies to Latin America in accounting for and doing justice to the experiences of Indigenous Mexican and Central American women who migrate north across the US border and are detained in immigration facilities. King's (2019) recent scholarship bridging Black studies to Native studies has taken the whiteness of settler colonial studies to task for disarticulating enslavement from the processes of dispossession, for ignoring Indigenous histories of critique, and for focusing, she argues, on settler subjectivity.
Overall, the engagement with Native American and Indigenous studies brought to anthropology invigorated understandings of sovereignty, political relationality, and settler colonialism.

Section: PART II: METHOD

Twenty-first-century scholarship at the intersection of anthropology and Indigenous studies has two distinctive methodological characteristics: ( a ) ethnographic grounding in territorially based or other forms of located Indigenous community (e.g., an urban one), rather than a less community-specific indigeneity; and ( b ) a focus on relationality. This methodology is embedded in larger epistemological and power-laden commitments.
The anthropology of Native North America has focused largely on community studies, whether those communities were in motion or in willful construction. While boundedness has been criticized more broadly in anthropology ( Gupta & Ferguson 1992 ), given that transnational and intercultural connections of communities were previously overlooked or read as signs of cultural breakdown, it is nonetheless the case that anthropology has much to contribute to Native American and Indigenous studies in light of ethnographers’ attention to the distinctiveness of communities and to the embeddedness of everyday processes in their larger sociopolitical contexts. Awarded since 2010, NAISA book prizes reflect a balance of scholarship that builds theory across Indigenous nations and communities with books that focus on single nations and communities. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the latter have been contributed largely by anthropologists and historians.
More generally, in Native American and Indigenous studies scholarship less territorially specified theorizations of sovereignty ( Barker 2005 , Bruyneel 2007 , Moreton-Robinson 2007 ), settler colonialism ( Wolfe 1999 , 2006 ); empire and discourse ( Byrd 2011 ); knowledge and subjectivity ( TallBear 2013 ); and indigenous mobility, gender, and territoriality ( Goeman 2013 ) have been complemented by ethnographic and historical works that are grounded in the specificity of single Indigenous nations and communities (e.g., Biolsi 2001 , 2018 ; Cattelino 2008 ; Dennison 2012 ; Estes 2019 ; Harmon 2019 ; Kauanui 2008 ; McCarthy 2016 ; Montoya 2018 ; Pasternak 2017 ; Ramirez 2007 ; Simpson 2014 ; Sturm 2002 ; Tengan 2008 ). These nation- and community-specific monographs couple the call to analyze Indigenous life as interconnected and in motion with grounding in the nationhood and territorial specificity of, for example, Kahnawà:ke Mohawks, Osages, Six Nations Haudenosaunee, Lakotas, Navajos, Seminoles, Hawaiians, Cherokees, the urban Indian community of the California Bay Area, and the Quinault and Suquamish nations. This insistence on the empirical, description, and specificity as building blocks of theory is among anthropologists’ key contributions to Native American and Indigenous studies. These contributions do not lose sight of the colonial legacy of anthropology nor the transformations of the field wrought by Indigenous critique ( Biolsi & Zimmerman 1997 ), rendering a heightened awareness in fieldsites of extended relation and responsibility.
Indeed, this awareness is also a matter of method, and while political relationality is a thematic concern, it is also a methodological and ethical one, as TallBear (2019) and Moreton-Robinson (2017) emphasize. Moreton-Robinson (2017 , p. 69) argues that relationality is central to Indigenous research methodology: “Relationality is the interpretive and epistemic scaffolding shaping and supporting Indigenous social research and its standards are culturally specific and nuanced to the Indigenous researcher's standpoint and the cultural context of the research” (see also Smith 1999 ). 4 West (2018) , in the context of controversies about power in disciplinary anthropology and how anthropological theory uses Indigenous philosophy, introduces the collection of writings “From Reciprocity to Relationality: Anthropological Possibilities” with a call for a reorientation from reciprocity in the classic Mauss-to-Sahlins sense to relationality in anthropological praxis and epistemology. Hoover (2017) documents Akwesasne Mohawk public health research collaborations with scientists to study and then fight the toxic contamination of Akwesasne land and water. As Moreton-Robinson, West, TallBear, and Yazzie & Risling Baldy (2018) each emphasize, relationality has been a feminist concept and method. These are matters of not only researcher positionality and ethics, though those are key, but also knowledge production.

Section: PART III: DIRECTIONS

Emergent scholarly conversations demonstrate how the insistent (if sometimes critical) coupling of Native American and Indigenous studies with settler colonial studies, as well as efforts to account ethnographically for life “beyond settler colonialism” ( Weiss 2018 ), has afforded new opportunities for anthropological knowledge production and praxis. In addition to the burgeoning literature on sovereignty and Indigenous governance already discussed, two exciting directions are ( a ) environment and relationality and ( b ) culture and economy.
Anthropological engagements with Indigenous ecologies have taken new directions by focusing on environmental governance and other modes of relationality and on power/knowledge. While scholarship continues to focus on Indigenous communities’ relations to land and water, anthropologists are divided about the explanatory power and the politics of positing ontological difference (for differing approaches, see de la Cadena 2015 , Hunt 2014 , Nadasdy 2021 , Todd 2016 ).
The reorientation to sovereignty and settler colonialism as anthropology intersected with Native American and Indigenous studies reshaped scholarship on Indigenous ecologies. Krech's (1999) earlier positivist claim that American Indian communities were not ecologically sustainable acknowledged the power of essentialist images of Native people as being one with the land (following Berkhofer 1979 ) but, Ranco (2007) argued, Krech's claim weaponized these representational concerns when cataloging Native American environmental harms and thereby unduly dismissing Indigenous claims to “environmental legitimacy” (p. 45) in the context of colonial dispossession and struggle for the land. Similarly, Carroll, following Willow, rejects questions about whether Indigenous peoples are really more ecological because those questions “often mask the politics of what is at stake in indigenous environmental activism, which entails counteracting histories of dispossession by reasserting sovereign claims to land” ( Carroll 2015 , p. xv).
Rather than ask whether narratives about indigeneity and nature are true, ethnographers began to query the sociopolitical processes by which environmental narratives and ways of knowing—for example, climate science—emerged historically and “[came] to matter” ( Callison 2014 ). For example, Cruikshank (2005) takes glaciers and their narrations as agents of encounter that scramble nature/culture divides, attending to how local knowledges—Tlingit and Athabascan, on the one hand, and settler scientific, on the other hand—are produced through glacial encounters.
Such mattering concerns not only truth but also values, sovereignty, and colonialism. As such, scholars increasingly have focused on how and when the environment is the site not only of dispossession but also of governance, solidarity, and flourishing. An exemplary text is Carroll's Roots of Our Renewal: Ethnobotany and Cherokee Environmental Governance , which, through ethnography of a Cherokee Nation ethnobotany project, examines environmental governance as “the process by which Cherokees make decisions with regard to the human relationship to the nonhuman world” ( Carroll 2015 , p. 7). Carroll finds that for Cherokees environmental governance takes place along a continuum of “resource-based” and “relationship-based” environmental values and practices. Both, he argues, are essential to the ongoing claim and practice of Cherokee sovereignty in the context of settler colonialism.
Land and water and all who live in them become points of wanted or unwanted connectivity in settler societies. Montoya (2018) follows the contaminated waters of a mine spill to document and analyze the often-extractive “permeability” of Navajo and settler jurisdiction as a more general condition of indigeneity in the United States. Nadasdy (2003 , 2017 ) follows the bureaucratization of nature in settler state comanagement and land claims processes, showing them to reproduce rather than ameliorate power imbalances. He argues that “sovereignty's entailments” as a state-like aspiration ( Nadasdy 2017 ) preclude Kluane and other First Nation flourishing, as First Nations polities and people must subtly and not-so-subtly attune their most basic orientations to space and time, for example, to the order of the liberal settler state.
If land and water have been the locus of ongoing dispossession, scholars have shown how they are also at the relational center of Indigenous activism and flourishing. Willow (2012) , Pasternak (2017) , Powell (2018) , and Estes (2019) each document the settler colonial force of domination over land and water while foregrounding relations with land and water as sources of Indigenous power, activism, and solidarity (see also Field 2008 on abalone). Grossman (2017) shows how Indigenous and white alliances are forged to defend the land. Todd (2018) identifies human–fish relations in Paulatuuq, Northwest Territories, and the Lake Winnipeg watershed as a site where Indigenous peoples “refract” state laws and colonial orders. In her ethnography of Diné energy politics at the intersection of environment and sovereignty, Powell focuses on Diné anticoal activism and its ethics and generative potential. Estes (2019) reorients the temporality of ecological flourishing not only toward the Lakota past but also to the past-as-future of Lakota resistance and power. He identifies a project of future making in the location and practices of a different “camp” than Agamban's site of unkillable nonlife: Oceti Sakowin Camp, the locus for the movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline ( Estes 2019 , p. 68). That camp was, in Estes's formulation, an instantiation of a before in the present, although as a site for planning direct action it was also an occasion for taking care of each other (p. 19). Taking up abolitionist geographer Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Estes elaborates, “The #NoDAPL camps didn't just imagine a future without settler colonialism and the oppressive institution of the state, but created that future in the here and now” (p. 253). That creation, he explains, recentered relationality (see Part I for Tiyospaye).
Anthropologists working with and in Indigenous studies have approached the Anthropocene, and broader questions of relationality and attendant governance obligation with nonhumans, by bringing forth theories of relationality that account both for social relations and for the material force of water and other physical, chemical, and biological matter and processes. TallBear (2019 , p. 25) describes this spatial and kin-making orientation to caretaking as an “everyday Dakota understanding of existence that focuses on ‘being in good relation.’” Central to relationality, Moreton-Robinson (2017) argues, is the inseparability of the human from other living things and the earth, as inhabited by ancestors and creator beings; this inseparability is shaped by rules and protocols.
At a time when posthumanism pervades the humanities and social sciences, and when anthropological calls to move “beyond the human” ( Kohn 2013 ) resonate widely in the discipline, Indigenous studies offers key insights and sometimes-overlooked intellectual traditions. As TallBear (2011 , 2015 ) emphasizes, Indigenous scholars—she highlights Dakota philosophy, V. Deloria Jr., and Eastman—have long theorized relations among beings, living and not, that go to the core of how people are human in relation with others (see also Povinelli 2016 , Todd 2016 ). Botanist Robin Kimmerer (2013) , in Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants , foregrounds reciprocity in her analysis of Indigenous science and values, opening a potential link to the voluminous anthropological literature, some of it feminist, on reciprocity, value, and regeneration. Davis & Todd (2017) and Whyte (2018) question the historical specificity of the Anthropocene, calling for attention to its colonial form and function. While drawing on and contributing to posthumanist scholarship, such Indigenous studies approaches always consider the stakes of “the environment” for anticolonial and often feminist struggles.
“Culture” enjoys a resurgent form in new works in Native American and Indigenous studies, as well as those anthropologies bridging to Native studies. As with sovereignty, Indigenous peoples are far from done with the bedrocks of anthropological theorizing, including “culture.” This matter(ing) of culture—of social structure, of kinship, of language—forms the basis of movements or alternatives to settler society. It provides the foundation for politics, for deliberate manifestations of life within and beyond the settler state. At the same time, as Mullin (2001 , p. 3) observed, anthropologists and settlers have participated in the “culturalization of difference,” understanding the distinctiveness of Native peoples—and managing and marketing that distinctiveness—primarily as a matter of culture. Anthropologists have also criticized and documented these processes: Ethnographies within Indigenous Australia, Canada, and the United States pointed to the impossibly restrictive form that culture—and anthropological approaches to it—took as it entered into legal imaginations and courts in Indigenous claims to land, water, and hunting rights, not to mention identities ( Asch 1999 , Clifford 1988 , Niezen 2009 , Povinelli 2002 ). This restrictive form of culture, trapped in time before colonialism (see also Wolfe 1999 ) and defined by state forms of recognition, coexisted uneasily with the theory of culture as invented ( Hanson 1989 , Hobsbawm & Ranger 1992 , Linnekin 1991 ). “The invention of tradition” ( Hobsbawm & Ranger 1992 ) was a nod to the processual mode of cultural theory that, when placed in colonial contexts, took on the interpretive veneer of seemingly inauthentic or insincere contrivance (for example, see Clifton 1990 ). Anthropologists have worked against the constraint posed by different theorizations of culture as expert witnesses in Indigenous land claims cases in Canada ( Culhane 1998 , Mills 1994 ) and efforts to achieve nation-state recognition ( Miller 2003 , Povinelli 2002 ). Wickwire's (2019) At the Bridge: James Teit and an Anthropology of Belonging deepens our understanding of anthropological histories of political advocacy in the Pacific Northwest.
True to the commitments of Native studies, anthropologists bridging these fields looked to Indigenous political histories to inform their studies of politics and the life of culture. In Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across the Borders of Settler States , Simpson (2014) embeds the contemporary problem of membership in a Haudenosaunee reserve community within three centuries of movement and dispossession to chart a political commitment and practice of refusal. “Refusal” is animated by a precolonial governance structure and philosophy. The Kaianere'kó:wa or “Great Law of Peace,” whether adhered to or not, animates a politics that refuses the primacy of settler governance and the legitimacy of dispossession. 5 But Simpson also instantiates “refusal” as a form of anthropological writing that does not concede all information in light of anthropological histories of taking and the Haudenosaunee. Culture is charted as a mode of purity and expectation in anthropological writing that disserved Kahnawà:ke Mohawks. Taking up earlier critical work in anthropology, Mohawk Interruptus examines how Indigenous peoples were enmeshed in nineteenth- and twentieth-century processes like the Indian Act of 1876, which sought to dispossess them while making them over as white, settler subjects.
Others have explored the paradoxes of culture as deployed by and for Indigenous communities. Tengan (2008) deftly charts the work of culture as an epistemological and bodily project of gendered renewal for Kanaka Maoli men who are resisting colonial occupation. As Dennison (2012 , p. 78) stated, “[C]ulture has proven to be a dangerous colonial tool of conquest used to signal disrupture and disappearance, but it has at times also been used as a precarious means of holding off colonial forces”; it is also, she shows, a site of desire (see also Ginsburg 2002 ). McCarthy (2016) centers Haudenosaunee philosophy and ritual in her analysis of the Six Nations land reclamation at Caledonia in 2006. Glass (2021) presents a cultural history of the Kwakw a k a 'wakw Hamatsa dance in ethnographic writing, as a site of the objectification of culture in the community and for outside observers. To claim and sustain cultural authority in the face of the Canadian state, Glass argues, Kwakw a k a 'wakw people had to engage with and deploy ethnographic description; they also contributed to that very same ethnographic knowledge production. These works show statecraft, sovereignty, knowledge production, cultural authority, and ethnographic mediation to be deeply entangled.
The attachment to, and weaponization of, culture was a sensibility shared by settler publics that is laid bare in debates about economies and ecologies. Work in anthropology, Native studies, and history took up the virulent anti-Indian racism of white protesters against Anishinaabe who exercised spearfishing rights in Wisconsin ( Nesper 2002 ) and casinos in California ( Bruyneel 2007 , pp. 171–216; Darian-Smith 2004 ) and Mashantucket, Connecticut ( Bodinger de Uriarte 2007 ). Cattelino's (2008) High Stakes: Florida Seminole Gaming and Sovereignty analyzes arguments regarding the presumption of cultural loss and endangerment in the context of capital accumulation among Florida Seminoles. Her ethnography explores anxieties around indigeneity and money, what Spilde (2004) has called “rich Indian racism” (p. 75). Cattelino's study examines how the expectation of Indigenous poverty is linked to the cultural politics of economic form (see also Cattelino 2018 , 2010 ; Harmon 2010 ). Florida Seminoles used their casino revenues to fund infrastructure and health initiatives as well as cultural preservation and curatorial institutions such as the Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Museum, disproving the sense that capital would cause a diminishment of form or that they were willing to forsake their traditions to get rich. Such work analyzes the relationship of economic life and cultural discourses and values with Indigenous sovereignty and political theory, as well as with Indigenous economic actors, and it complements political economic ethnographies of Indigenous dispossession, state economies, and capitalism ( Dombrowski 2001 , Pickering 2000 ). Lewis (2019) , in the ethnography Sovereign Entrepreneurs: Cherokee Small-Business Owners and the Making of Economic Sovereignty , argues that Eastern Band of Cherokees’ small businesses diversify the reservation and regional economies and buffer communities from economic downturns to which Native nations relying on only one industry are otherwise vulnerable. She also shows how small businesses are intertwined with tribal governments, contributing to “economic sovereignty.”
Ethnographies of Indigenous cultural production that address markets grapple with economies of culture. In Painting Culture: The Making of Aboriginal High Art , Myers (2002) analyzes the history of state projects and market conditions contributing to the establishment of Australian and global markets for Aboriginal fine art. He addresses scandals and urban legends surrounding fakes, authenticity, contract breaches, and other troubles, arguing that they concern movements between and among conflicting regimes of value, in which racial and social relationships between Indigenous and white Australians are worked out. Arndt's (2016) ethnography of Ho-Chunk powwow is deeply embedded in the history and economy of the community. While acutely aware of the expectation, in P.J. Deloria's (2004) sense, of a certain form of Indigenous cultural performance, Ho-Chunk powwow is a deeply negotiated, ambivalent, and resistant form of dance and sociality in the Midwest. As Nesper (2002) showed of spearfishing, the culture–sovereignty nexus structures debates over Indigenous relations to other-than-humans, especially when understood by settlers as “natural resources” with exchange value or as “the environment.”
An illustrative case of both the centrality of culture and its practice to Indigenous peoples and, on the other hand, its fraught weight of colonial expectation (and regulation) is Makah whaling. Although the Makah were guaranteed their right to hunt whale by the 1855 Treaty of Neah Bay, overhunting by commercial fishers depleted the gray whale such that by the early twentieth century the Makah agreed to stop hunting them. After these whales were removed from the endangered species list in 1994, the Makah in 1999, upon acquiring permissions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and a waiver to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, conducted their first whale hunt in 70 years. They were accused by environmentalists of animal cruelty, of being out of touch with the present, and, significantly, of betraying their cultural norms as they had been defined not by their own traditions, their own cultural values, but rather by anthropologists, historians, and environmentalists ( Coté 2010 , Erikson 1999 , Reid 2015 ).
Whether concerning economic development or ecological relations, scholars have shown how the matter of culture does indeed matter to Indigenous communities and nations: as a political resource, as a product of everyday life, as a locus of cultural production and institutionalization ( Bodinger de Uriarte 2007 , Geismar 2013 , Harrison et al. 2013 , Lonetree 2012 ), and as deliberate and sometimes sacred work ( Jackson 2005 ) during and through forms of colonialism that would punish it as a continued form of savagery if not deemed recognizable and specifically cultural difference in Western, liberal terms ( Asch 1999 , Povinelli 2002 ).
Anthropological engagements with Indigenous ecologies have taken new directions by focusing on environmental governance and other modes of relationality and on power/knowledge. While scholarship continues to focus on Indigenous communities’ relations to land and water, anthropologists are divided about the explanatory power and the politics of positing ontological difference (for differing approaches, see de la Cadena 2015 , Hunt 2014 , Nadasdy 2021 , Todd 2016 ).
The reorientation to sovereignty and settler colonialism as anthropology intersected with Native American and Indigenous studies reshaped scholarship on Indigenous ecologies. Krech's (1999) earlier positivist claim that American Indian communities were not ecologically sustainable acknowledged the power of essentialist images of Native people as being one with the land (following Berkhofer 1979 ) but, Ranco (2007) argued, Krech's claim weaponized these representational concerns when cataloging Native American environmental harms and thereby unduly dismissing Indigenous claims to “environmental legitimacy” (p. 45) in the context of colonial dispossession and struggle for the land. Similarly, Carroll, following Willow, rejects questions about whether Indigenous peoples are really more ecological because those questions “often mask the politics of what is at stake in indigenous environmental activism, which entails counteracting histories of dispossession by reasserting sovereign claims to land” ( Carroll 2015 , p. xv).
Rather than ask whether narratives about indigeneity and nature are true, ethnographers began to query the sociopolitical processes by which environmental narratives and ways of knowing—for example, climate science—emerged historically and “[came] to matter” ( Callison 2014 ). For example, Cruikshank (2005) takes glaciers and their narrations as agents of encounter that scramble nature/culture divides, attending to how local knowledges—Tlingit and Athabascan, on the one hand, and settler scientific, on the other hand—are produced through glacial encounters.
Such mattering concerns not only truth but also values, sovereignty, and colonialism. As such, scholars increasingly have focused on how and when the environment is the site not only of dispossession but also of governance, solidarity, and flourishing. An exemplary text is Carroll's Roots of Our Renewal: Ethnobotany and Cherokee Environmental Governance , which, through ethnography of a Cherokee Nation ethnobotany project, examines environmental governance as “the process by which Cherokees make decisions with regard to the human relationship to the nonhuman world” ( Carroll 2015 , p. 7). Carroll finds that for Cherokees environmental governance takes place along a continuum of “resource-based” and “relationship-based” environmental values and practices. Both, he argues, are essential to the ongoing claim and practice of Cherokee sovereignty in the context of settler colonialism.
Land and water and all who live in them become points of wanted or unwanted connectivity in settler societies. Montoya (2018) follows the contaminated waters of a mine spill to document and analyze the often-extractive “permeability” of Navajo and settler jurisdiction as a more general condition of indigeneity in the United States. Nadasdy (2003 , 2017 ) follows the bureaucratization of nature in settler state comanagement and land claims processes, showing them to reproduce rather than ameliorate power imbalances. He argues that “sovereignty's entailments” as a state-like aspiration ( Nadasdy 2017 ) preclude Kluane and other First Nation flourishing, as First Nations polities and people must subtly and not-so-subtly attune their most basic orientations to space and time, for example, to the order of the liberal settler state.
If land and water have been the locus of ongoing dispossession, scholars have shown how they are also at the relational center of Indigenous activism and flourishing. Willow (2012) , Pasternak (2017) , Powell (2018) , and Estes (2019) each document the settler colonial force of domination over land and water while foregrounding relations with land and water as sources of Indigenous power, activism, and solidarity (see also Field 2008 on abalone). Grossman (2017) shows how Indigenous and white alliances are forged to defend the land. Todd (2018) identifies human–fish relations in Paulatuuq, Northwest Territories, and the Lake Winnipeg watershed as a site where Indigenous peoples “refract” state laws and colonial orders. In her ethnography of Diné energy politics at the intersection of environment and sovereignty, Powell focuses on Diné anticoal activism and its ethics and generative potential. Estes (2019) reorients the temporality of ecological flourishing not only toward the Lakota past but also to the past-as-future of Lakota resistance and power. He identifies a project of future making in the location and practices of a different “camp” than Agamban's site of unkillable nonlife: Oceti Sakowin Camp, the locus for the movement against the Dakota Access Pipeline ( Estes 2019 , p. 68). That camp was, in Estes's formulation, an instantiation of a before in the present, although as a site for planning direct action it was also an occasion for taking care of each other (p. 19). Taking up abolitionist geographer Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Estes elaborates, “The #NoDAPL camps didn't just imagine a future without settler colonialism and the oppressive institution of the state, but created that future in the here and now” (p. 253). That creation, he explains, recentered relationality (see Part I for Tiyospaye).
Anthropologists working with and in Indigenous studies have approached the Anthropocene, and broader questions of relationality and attendant governance obligation with nonhumans, by bringing forth theories of relationality that account both for social relations and for the material force of water and other physical, chemical, and biological matter and processes. TallBear (2019 , p. 25) describes this spatial and kin-making orientation to caretaking as an “everyday Dakota understanding of existence that focuses on ‘being in good relation.’” Central to relationality, Moreton-Robinson (2017) argues, is the inseparability of the human from other living things and the earth, as inhabited by ancestors and creator beings; this inseparability is shaped by rules and protocols.
At a time when posthumanism pervades the humanities and social sciences, and when anthropological calls to move “beyond the human” ( Kohn 2013 ) resonate widely in the discipline, Indigenous studies offers key insights and sometimes-overlooked intellectual traditions. As TallBear (2011 , 2015 ) emphasizes, Indigenous scholars—she highlights Dakota philosophy, V. Deloria Jr., and Eastman—have long theorized relations among beings, living and not, that go to the core of how people are human in relation with others (see also Povinelli 2016 , Todd 2016 ). Botanist Robin Kimmerer (2013) , in Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants , foregrounds reciprocity in her analysis of Indigenous science and values, opening a potential link to the voluminous anthropological literature, some of it feminist, on reciprocity, value, and regeneration. Davis & Todd (2017) and Whyte (2018) question the historical specificity of the Anthropocene, calling for attention to its colonial form and function. While drawing on and contributing to posthumanist scholarship, such Indigenous studies approaches always consider the stakes of “the environment” for anticolonial and often feminist struggles.
“Culture” enjoys a resurgent form in new works in Native American and Indigenous studies, as well as those anthropologies bridging to Native studies. As with sovereignty, Indigenous peoples are far from done with the bedrocks of anthropological theorizing, including “culture.” This matter(ing) of culture—of social structure, of kinship, of language—forms the basis of movements or alternatives to settler society. It provides the foundation for politics, for deliberate manifestations of life within and beyond the settler state. At the same time, as Mullin (2001 , p. 3) observed, anthropologists and settlers have participated in the “culturalization of difference,” understanding the distinctiveness of Native peoples—and managing and marketing that distinctiveness—primarily as a matter of culture. Anthropologists have also criticized and documented these processes: Ethnographies within Indigenous Australia, Canada, and the United States pointed to the impossibly restrictive form that culture—and anthropological approaches to it—took as it entered into legal imaginations and courts in Indigenous claims to land, water, and hunting rights, not to mention identities ( Asch 1999 , Clifford 1988 , Niezen 2009 , Povinelli 2002 ). This restrictive form of culture, trapped in time before colonialism (see also Wolfe 1999 ) and defined by state forms of recognition, coexisted uneasily with the theory of culture as invented ( Hanson 1989 , Hobsbawm & Ranger 1992 , Linnekin 1991 ). “The invention of tradition” ( Hobsbawm & Ranger 1992 ) was a nod to the processual mode of cultural theory that, when placed in colonial contexts, took on the interpretive veneer of seemingly inauthentic or insincere contrivance (for example, see Clifton 1990 ). Anthropologists have worked against the constraint posed by different theorizations of culture as expert witnesses in Indigenous land claims cases in Canada ( Culhane 1998 , Mills 1994 ) and efforts to achieve nation-state recognition ( Miller 2003 , Povinelli 2002 ). Wickwire's (2019) At the Bridge: James Teit and an Anthropology of Belonging deepens our understanding of anthropological histories of political advocacy in the Pacific Northwest.
True to the commitments of Native studies, anthropologists bridging these fields looked to Indigenous political histories to inform their studies of politics and the life of culture. In Mohawk Interruptus: Political Life Across the Borders of Settler States , Simpson (2014) embeds the contemporary problem of membership in a Haudenosaunee reserve community within three centuries of movement and dispossession to chart a political commitment and practice of refusal. “Refusal” is animated by a precolonial governance structure and philosophy.

Section: CONCLUSION: RELATIONS

The early twenty-first-century conjuncture that brought together Indigenous studies approaches to sovereignty and settler colonialism with reinvigorated anthropological attention to the political and the territorial has reshaped both fields and has profoundly reorganized the epistemological, thematic, and political commitments of the subfield known as the anthropology of Native North America. Still, while some breakout scholarship like Simpson's (2014) Mohawk Interruptus has crossed over to influence general anthropological theorizing, the discipline's long-standing inattention to settler colonialism, despite its engagement with colonialism generally, and the paucity of engagements with AIS scholarship on sovereignty when the discipline turned to sovereignty suggest that work remains to be done to reap the epistemological, methodological, and relational rewards of research at the intersection of these fields. Looking ahead to a future that is also about the past and present, one theme to guide this work is political relationality. Focusing on political relationality includes careful thinking about sovereignty, nation, and self-determination, including by paying attention to interdependencies, entanglements, and nestedness. It includes methodological orientation to good relations with one another and this earth's beings that articulates with long-standing anthropological attention to kinship and reciprocity. And it demands accounts of the structures of those relations, whether ecological, economic, cultural, or otherwise. Relationality in this sense is political, and it entails obligation. It is grounded in place but also aids theorization that moves. Rethinking indigeneity, then, requires ongoing reconsideration of anthropology's epistemological, methodological, political, and ethical relations.
