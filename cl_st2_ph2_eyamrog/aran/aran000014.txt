Title: Race and Racism in Archaeologies of Chinese American Communities


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

This article provides a critical review of archaeological research that addresses race and racism in Chinese American communities. Future directions for Chinese diaspora archaeologies include employing an Asian American studies praxis that centers community-engaged research, using diasporic frameworks, and applying emic language to naming material culture and identities. Other innovative archaeological scholarship on the racialization of Chinese Americans reframes Chinese American communities as part of larger multiethnic neighborhoods, highlights gender and sexuality, and traces the transpacific connections of Chinese transmigrants. The interventions outlined provide archaeologists who are engaged in the study of the Chinese American past with the pathways needed to begin practicing antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies.

Section: 1. INTRODUCTION

Since their beginnings in the late 1960s, the archaeologies of historic Chinese American communities in the United States have developed into a distinctive specialization that engages academics, cultural resource management (CRM) archaeologists, government agencies, and descendant community members. Environmental compliance regulations prompted most early excavations, especially during urban redevelopment, transportation, and resource extraction projects. Research-initiated studies have dramatically increased in the past 15 years, introducing new collaborations, research methods, and theoretical perspectives to the field, including a shift toward a diasporic lens and critical perspectives on race and racism. This transformation coincides with the entry of Chinese American archaeologists to a field whose practitioners have been and continue to be predominantly white. In fact, this article is the first in which the majority of authors are Chinese American, including two authors descended from nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Chinese American communities. Empowered by the work of Black and Indigenous archaeologists, we view our subjectivities as integral to our review, analysis, and critique of the field.
This article reflects on the history of Chinese diaspora archaeologies, focusing on current cutting-edge directions that center discussions of race, racism, racialization, power, and community. Although we focus on Chinese American communities in the United States, we situate our discussion in a diasporic framework that draws on scholarship that Asian American studies and Asian studies scholars have developed since the 1990s.
Chinese diaspora refers to the migration and interconnections between ethnic Chinese people and communities across the globe and their kiùh heūng (qiáoxiāng, 僑鄉, home villages) in China (see Section 2.2 for a discussion on language). We understand diaspora as both social memory and imagination with underlying notions of home, a phenomenon that operates in public space, is not bound by national boundaries, and is integral to identity and community formation within the context of imperialism, capitalism, and empire ( Hu-DeHart 2005 , 2015 ; C. Lee 2005 ; R.G. Lee 2017 ). As such, we locate our work in dialogue with archaeological research across the diaspora in Australia (e.g., Boileau 2017 , Byrne 2016 ), Canada ( Ross 2013 ), Peru (e.g., González-Tennant 2011 ), and New Zealand ( Ritchie 2003 ), as well as Chinese diaspora archaeologies in the United States (for overviews, see Rose & Kennedy 2020 ; Ross 2013 , 2020 ; Staski 2009 ; Voss 2015 ; Voss & Allen 2008 ).
Following passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, CRM archaeologists began documenting sites and assemblages with Chinese diasporic material culture. Large, multiphased projects spurred by urban redevelopment in California resulted in the publication of key monographs about urban Chinatowns (see Voss & Allen 2008 , p. 17, for a full citation list). This research, highly descriptive and exoticizing, was published mainly in the gray literature of unpublished Master's theses and technical or agency reports ( Rose & Kennedy 2020 , p. 13). Most of the analysis focused on identifying ethnicity and ethnic markers ( Staski 2009 , pp. 347–48), wherein questions of assimilation, acculturation, and comparative economic analysis came to dominate these reports in the 1970s and 1980s ( Rose & Kennedy 2020 , pp. 13–14; Staski 2009 , pp. 348–54 for specific studies).
Despite these essentializing frameworks, key developments emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1982, the Asian American Comparative Collection was established at the University of Idaho, which helped standardize typologies across projects. Additionally, Chinese American descendants began to be consulted on these projects, which we explore later in this article. By the 1990s, archaeologists developed a subfield investigating Chinese diasporic material culture; however, most of the research was still embedded in CRM. Within the academy, archaeologists continued advocating for the adoption of research programs that investigated social histories and integrated approaches with oral history (reviewed in Ross 2013 , p. 5679).
Chinese diaspora archaeology has flourished in the past two decades, although development has been uneven. The number of academic archaeology projects focused on Chinese diaspora sites increased over the 2000s. Despite shifts within archaeology that focus on race rather than ethnicity (e.g., Epperson 2004 , Orser 1999 ), earlier assimilation and ethnicity paradigms remain prevalent in Chinese diaspora archaeology. Fueled in part by the greater involvement of Chinese Americans in archaeology, some Chinese diaspora archaeology studies have responded by centering race and racialization in their analyses. Fong's research at Isleton, California, discussed in greater detail below, was the first project directed by a Chinese American archaeologist ( Fong 2013 ). Additionally, since the late 1990s, key Chinese American organizations, such as the Chinese Historical and Cultural Project and the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California, and community historians, including Connie Young Yu, Phil Choy, Eugene Moy, and Sue Fawn Chung, have engaged with archaeologists in government agencies, CRM firms, and academia to develop research programs on the archaeology of historic Chinatown communities ( Allen et al. 2002 , Choy 2014 , Chung et al. 2005 , Sagara 2014 , Voss et al. 2013 , C. Yu 2001 ). A key example of this shift toward substantive community involvement is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the United States, which was used as a motivation to advance archaeological research into the lived experiences of Chinese railroad workers ( Chang & Fishkin 2019 , Voss 2015 ).
Congruent with observations made by Agbe-Davies (2022) in relationship to African American archaeology, the current state of Chinese diaspora archaeologies highlights the centrality of institutions, both in shaping the lives of Chinese Americans in the past and in fostering archaeological research on Chinese diaspora communities. The academic institutions most closely associated with research on Chinese diaspora archaeologies at the time of this writing are also those whose history is entangled with the exploitation of Chinese and Chinese American workers in railroad construction, mining, lumber, and fisheries, as well as the politics of Chinese exclusion and discrimination. However, as Agbe-Davies (2022) observes, “[T]he flip side to the power of the institution…is resistance and transgression” (p. 347). Chinese American heritage organizations and Chinese American archaeologists are leading the struggle for epistemic self-determination in the study of Chinese American sites, landscapes, and collections.
Consequently, Chinese diaspora archaeologies both are shaped by and can disrupt racial discourse in the present. We wrote this article in the context of media accounts of rising anti-Asian violence and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic and shifting US–China political relations that mirror anti-Chinese racism in the nineteenth century ( Lee 2020 ). Racial tropes about hygiene and food are being remobilized and amplified in this moment ( King 2020 ). We also wrote this article in a moment of hope for Asian American communities, who, in the face of this racism, are also experiencing a resurgence of activism that challenges institutions of white supremacy and racialized discourse around xenophobia.
Despite studying the past, archaeologists are not immune to racial discourse in the present. As such, to move the archaeologies of Chinese American communities toward antiracist directions, we challenge fellow archaeologists to recognize the central role of race in our field and in the lived experiences of the people we study. We challenge our colleagues to recognize the power we each hold to contribute to the social construction of race in the past and present by virtue of our credentials and recognized expertise, through our professional roles as educators, cultural resource managers, and museum curators and interpreters. Archaeologists are not neutral observers of the past; we actively shape narratives of the past that simultaneously reflect and impact the present. As the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored, racism is not something that happened only long ago. Racism must be addressed in the present. Moments of extreme violence as well as structural racism hidden within the institutions and routines of everyday life are embedded in the material realities of Chinese Americans. As archaeologists, if we replicate these racialized discourses and materialities, we perpetuate continued harm to Chinese Americans and other racialized communities in both the past and the present.
We challenge archaeologists working on Chinese American, Asian American, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) sites to reflect on how our racialized assumptions impact our work and what we can do to build better future antiracist archaeologies ( d'Alpoim Guedes et al. 2021 , Flewellen et al. 2021 ). To help envision this future, we outline directions for antiracist, community-engaged Chinese diaspora archaeologies in two major sections: Racial Formations and Antiracist Interventions. We advocate for a community-grounded, antiracist epistemology and use this article to foreground key recent work as models for future directions.

Section: 2. RACIAL FORMATIONS

We draw on the work of Omi & Winant (1994) and racial theory from ethnic studies scholarship to understand race as a constantly evolving social construct—a racial formation—rather than a fixed biological essence. This section outlines how and why archaeologists must understand how our discipline and our actions contribute to racial formation processes and what we can do to stop reifying racial discourses.
Archaeology has fallen behind other social sciences in critical studies of race and racialization. Influenced by positivism and processualism, archaeologists have opted to study ethnicity instead of race, searching for ethnic markers from objects while claiming that race was less archaeologically tangible ( Orser 2007 ). In Chinese diaspora archaeologies, archaeologists have inferred levels of Chinese-ness through consumed material culture, reducing analyses to a binary of assimilation or nonassimilation (for overviews, see Fong 2005 , 2013 ; Rose & Kennedy 2020 ; Voss 2005 ). Increasing numbers of archaeologists, while initially the minority in the field ( Fong 2005 , Naruta 2006 , Orser 2007 ), have more directly engaged with race and racialization in Chinese diaspora archaeologies over the past decade ( Fong 2013 , Fong & Lai 2015 , Lowman 2019 , Ng 2021 ).
To move beyond assimilation-based tropes, we advocate for interdisciplinary archaeologies with ethnic studies and critical race theory (CRT) scholarship to build antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies ( Fong & Lai 2015 ). CRT and ethnic studies scholars have theorized on the relationships among race, racism, racialization, and power that inform the lived experiences of BIPOC communities. These experiences impact the everyday lives of BIPOC communities and the material culture they use. This scholarship emphasizes essential understandings that are vital for recognizing the nuanced racialized experiences of Chinese American communities: ( a ) Racism is inextricable from everyday life and is not something occasional or exceptional; ( b ) race is a social construction with tangible, lived consequences; and ( c ) it is absolutely essential to give Chinese American voices epistemic privilege ( Delgado & Stefancic 2017 , Fong 2020 ).
Addressing the first two essential understandings, scholars have developed key theories that understand race as an evolving social construct embedded in popular discourse and institutions rather than a fixed biological essence. Omi & Winant (1994) call this phenomenon racial formation to describe the continual process that constructs race. They argue that this process happens through racial projects, which create meanings of race through linkages between structure and representation. CRT scholars also underscore the role of power and legal institutions in constructing race within social, economic, and political contexts ( Delgado & Stefancic 2017 ). By recognizing race as a social construct beyond phenotype-based stereotypes—one that is pervasive in American institutions beyond mere prejudice—this scholarship forces us to recognize that race, racism, and racialization are inseparable from the racialized communities we study.
Political scientist Kim's (1999) model of racial triangulation is particularly relevant to the racialized experiences of Asian Americans. Racial triangulation understands racialization as a relative and relational process occurring along multiple parameters. Kim notes that Asian American racialized identities cannot be adequately understood without interrogating their positioning relative to Blacks and whites in terms of two intersecting axes of a field of racial positions: relative valorization (superior, inferior) and civic ostracism (insider, foreigner). Her emphasis on civic ostracism links with legal scholar Ancheta's (2006) notion of foreigner racialization: that the combination of laws, policies, and racialized discourse have positioned Asian Americans as outsiders or foreigners excluded from the American civic body.
The essential understanding on epistemic privilege offers immense potential for Chinese diaspora archaeologies to become an antiracist field. Drawing from Crenshaw (1989) and Collins (2000) on Black feminist thought, we recognize the value of epistemic privilege as knowledge created from cumulative everyday experiences as racialized people with intersectional identities. Other scholars ( Bonilla-Silva & Zuberi 2008 , Smith 2012 ) and archaeologists ( Battle-Baptiste 2011 ; Fong 2013 , 2020 ; Franklin 1997 , 2001 ; Mack & Blakey 2004 ) have advocated for centering BIPOC voices in research whether as scholars or as community stakeholders. We cannot separate our work from our experiences as racialized people. Our unique subjectivities position us to recognize and call out racism when it may otherwise go unnoticed, to develop paradigm-shifting interpretations, and to build unique relationships with descendant communities and stakeholders ( Fong 2013 , 2020 ; Morris 2017 ).
Chinese diaspora archaeologies employing these essential understandings are a small but growing minority. Archaeologists often focus on catastrophic moments of racism that are historically documented and/or have clear material signatures, such as arson (see Rose & Kennedy 2020 ). These studies may investigate racism through burn layer stratigraphy but may not equally focus on how institutional racism outside these visible moments of racism also impacts the material culture of the mundane. Likewise, most scholarship on Chinese American sites has not centered the epistemic privilege of Chinese American archaeologists, descendants, and communities to whom these histories belong. Moreover, the field has remained largely siloed in ethnic-based archaeologies and has not widely recognized the benefits of building panethnic Asian American archaeologies that understand the importance of shared racialized experiences to these communities ( Fong & Lai 2015 ).
Through their academic training in Asian American studies and their embodied experiences and subjectivities as Chinese American women, Fong (2013 , 2020 ) and Ng (2020 , 2021 ) make key interventions on how to build future archaeologies that center interdisciplinary approaches. Fong's study on Isleton, California, a rural Chinese American/Asian American community, foregrounds discussions on racialization and institutional racism that impacted residents’ everyday material realities. Ng's work advocates for transnational/transpacific frameworks to understand continued social, economic, and political connections between ancestral villages in Guangdong Province and communities across the Chinese diaspora. Fong and Ng draw on their positionalities and personal relationships as descendant stakeholders, which shape their research questions and archaeological interpretations.
Archaeologists have discretion in their choice of words, categories, and considerations of language more broadly, actions that can contribute to the racialization of the communities we study. Drawing on Freire (1970) , Smith (2012 , pp. 84–86) shows how this power to name is also a power to claim a legitimate way of viewing the world. Selected terminologies enter the researcher into a predetermined lexical field foreclosed to a redefinition of the political and intellectual stakes ( Trouillot 2015 , p. 115). Within Chinese diaspora archaeologies, choices that archaeologists make (or do not make) in English, as well as their decisions to engage (or not) with Chinese languages, affect the type of research that can be conducted and its impact on contemporary communities. As such, it is essential that archaeologists are conscious and reflexive of their role in language and the power of naming.
We argue for the term “Chinese diaspora archaeologies” in contrast to the more widely used term “Overseas Chinese archaeology,” which is based on an English interpretation of wàh kiùh (huáqiáo, 華僑). Used since at least the late nineteenth century by the Qing government, wàh kiùh implies an eventual return and ultimate loyalty to a Chinese state. The larger history and context of the term imply perpetual foreignness and contribute to the racialization of Chinese American communities as outsiders ( Fong 2005 , 2013 ). In contrast, diaspora foregrounds the complexities and choices that Chinese American communities make in the face of state actions and policies, white supremacist social structures, capitalist and imperial formations, and the impacts of both sending and receiving countries on the migration of people and formation of diaspora ( Hu-DeHart 2005 ).
Archaeologists often contribute to racial discourse through terms used for material culture. For example, archaeologists still commonly use an eighteenth-century French chinoiserie term, “celadon,” to refer to green-glazed ceramics commonly found on Chinese American sites, even though the correct nomenclature, Winter Green (dūng chīng, dōng qīng, 冬青), is widely documented ( Choy 2014 , p. 6; Sando & Felton 1993 ). In addition, it is still common for archaeological reports and publications to misidentify glass bottles and other objects as opium paraphernalia despite well-established artifact typologies. These examples reveal how the language used in archaeology can unwittingly perpetuate colonialist and racializing discourses. We call for archaeologists to center the epistemic privilege of Chinese Americans past and present by naming and categorizing artifacts according to terms that are accurate and relevant to their historical context.
Moving forward, we advocate for reflexivity when making decisions around language and naming. We are intentional about highlighting heterogeneity in who is considered “Chinese.” Unless we are specifically talking about people in China, we avoid using the word “Chinese” as an independent qualifier because it minimizes the differences of heterogeneous peoples and elides historical differences. For US contexts, we advocate for Chinese American, which reflects the experiences of a heterogeneous group of people who share a common history of oppression, geographical origins, and political destiny ( Yung 1995 ). Consequently, we explicitly understand Chinese American communities as diasporic while situated within specific political and racial histories in the United States.
In deciding which languages and method of writing to use in their publications, archaeologists must consider those languages used by the historic communities they are studying, as well as the languages currently in use by their intended audiences. Most, but not all, nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Chinese American communities developed through migration from Cantonese-speaking areas with significant differences among the districts and villages in socioeconomic status and language (dialects). The Chinese language in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was in flux ( Tam 2020 ). Chinese Americans living in the United States would be broadly familiar with, if not outright engaged in, these debates. Dialect use and the hegemony of standardized Putonghua (Mandarin) are still political questions today. In both its oral and written forms, Cantonese has a number of unique words and grammar patterns that are not shared with Putonghua. It continues to be written in traditional characters rather than the simplified characters promulgated in the People's Republic of China since the 1950s.
When archaeologists consider this history and the power affiliations of their Chinese–English term choices, they can make critical decisions about who and how contemporary audiences will engage with their studies. To move in this direction, we advocate for understanding the worldview and heterogeneity of stakeholder communities and the political history embedded in transliterations. Moreover, we urge for transparency in this decision-making process to acknowledge the power behind these decisions. For this reason, we present all Chinese terms with the Yale transliteration of Cantonese, followed by the pinyin transliteration, traditional characters, and English translation. Including the Chinese character itself is integral to understanding the context and specificity of what is being named, which is not represented in phonetic transliterations. Although all major academic style guides ( American Psychological Association , Modern Language Association , Chicago Manual of Style ) still call for italicizing non-English words if they are not in a classic English dictionary, the choice to italicize should be at the writer's discretion. We intentionally do not italicize Cantonese or Mandarin terms in order to normalize the need for archaeologists to speak to multilingual communities ( Ha 2018 ).
Archaeology has fallen behind other social sciences in critical studies of race and racialization. Influenced by positivism and processualism, archaeologists have opted to study ethnicity instead of race, searching for ethnic markers from objects while claiming that race was less archaeologically tangible ( Orser 2007 ).

Section: 3. ANTIRACIST INTERVENTIONS

We strongly advocate for an antiracist stance, which the majority of Chinese diaspora archaeology projects in the United States have yet to widely embrace. This section outlines potential future directions for what antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies may look like through four themes: fostering community collaboration, understanding multiethnic communities, examining gender and sexuality, and exploring transpacific connections.
Archaeologists are publicly positioned as experts whose scholarship is accepted as historic truth. Much like our power to shape language and naming, our power to shape historic narratives for racialized communities means that our work in the present contributes to the social construction of ahistorical essentialized ideas about race in the past and present, directly impacting communities to whom this history belongs. Collaboration is one of the antiracist interventions that redistribute archaeologists’ narrative power. True collaboration moves beyond giving voice to the voiceless by centering community memory and action.
Exerting control over the historical narrative and countering racist formations in archaeological and historical discourses are often explicit goals of Chinese American stakeholders. In joining members of the descendant community walking the path of the transcontinental railroad, Peterson (2019) notes how descendants use archaeology in service of constructing collective memory. Material culture served as one touchstone for descendants to build a new narrative, which resulted in national recognition of the efforts of Chinese railroad workers. The development of new narratives about how we recognize and collectively memorialize Chinese American ancestors is one example of how we can use community collaboration to resist racist formations and of how engagement fundamentally shifts which research questions we ask and how we conduct archaeology on the ground or in existing collections ( Gonzalez et al. 2018 , Mack & Blakey 2004 ).
Antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies can build on community-based practices developed by BIPOC scholars ( Atalay 2012 , Blakey 2020 , Franklin & Lee 2020 , Gonzalez et al. 2018 , La Roche & Blakey 1997 ). Colwell-Chanthaphonh & Ferguson (2008) note that archaeology projects occur along a continuum of descendant community engagement. At one end, archaeologists present results to community members and organizations. At the other end, mutual contributions of community members and scholars forge research methods and interpretations that could not result without collaborative synergy. As we discuss below, Chinese Americans’ knowledge of the networks and diasporic connections of historic migrations has shifted archaeological inquiry from assimilation narratives to explore the materiality of the creation and maintenance of Chinese American identity ( Fong 2013 ), transnational communities ( Ng 2021 ), and the incorporation of new material forms in home villages ( Voss et al. 2018 ).
Chinese American communities historically have become involved in archaeological work usually as a reactionary measure because development has posed a threat to cultural heritage sites or the deceased's peaceful rest (e.g., Chung et al. 2005 ). In at least three cases, community activism pressured archaeological investigation and curation. Voss et al. (2013) detail how the Chinese American community of San Jose, California, fought for salvage excavation in Market Street Chinatown and how the subsequent “rediscovery” of the orphaned collection resulted in an explicitly multi-institutional, community-based research and education partnership. This trajectory contrasts with the more common situation where community members must mobilize and sustain pressure to prevent development from destroying historic sites, as with a proposed medical building at the archaeological site of Riverside Chinatown in 2008 ( Fuentes 2011 , Sagara 2014 ), or from disturbing historic cemeteries, as with the 2006 light rail extension in Los Angeles, California ( Gust et al. 2007 , Pierson 2006 ).
There are few published accounts of collaborative, community-based Chinese diaspora archaeology projects. However, projects investigating Chinatowns in San Jose ( Allen et al. 2002 , Massey et al. 2013 , Voss et al. 2013 ); the ongoing Arboretum Chinese Labor Quarters Project (2018) in Stanford, California; and Chinatown–6 Hudson Street, Boston ( City of Boston 2020 ) utilized community-based and collaborative frameworks. Archaeological inquiries by Voss (2005) , Fong (2013) , and Ng (2021) are examples of engaged research initiated and led by descendants where the community is involved in every step of the project as they wish to be. Each of these cases shows why it is not enough for archaeologists to involve communities “if and only when we need them” for our own purposes ( Fong 2020 , p. 69).
We aspire toward collaboration that builds reciprocity and mutually defined benefits to community members and archaeologists. Furthermore, an antiracist field means that more archaeologists will also be members of descendant communities. In practice, antiracist collaboration involves identifying stakeholders at all project stages and building their involvement into research design and conclusions. As Ko (2021) notes, stakeholders include communities impacted by archaeology but elided by the remembrance. Committing to community engagement means ensuring that stakeholders do not remember archaeologists as extractive people who construct ephemeral relationships, pack up, and almost never return again ( Ko 2021 , p. 37). Project budgets must incorporate costs to facilitate community engagement programs and consider the spatial extensions of the descendant community. Because many historic Chinese American communities were displaced by expulsion and racism, archaeologists may need to look beyond the immediate project location to identify community stakeholders. Although they may be far from the project area, Chinese American historical societies, village associations (tùhnghēung wuih, tóngxiāng huí, 同鄉會), and mutual aid societies (wuihgún, huìguǎn, 會館) are a good starting point. Ultimately, robust collaborative archaeologies can respond and be welcome to the spectrum of reasons why Chinese American communities participate in archaeology.
To build antiracist archaeologies, we advocate for viewing Chinatowns (tòhngyàhn gāai, tángrén jiē, 唐人街) as socially constructed and racially segregated neighborhoods that residents built into thriving multiethnic and multiracial communities. They were not isolated, bounded, or foreign neighborhoods. In actuality, Chinatowns are usually only Chinatowns in name. Chinatowns formed as racially segregated areas that the local white elite designated for those excluded from white neighborhoods ( Fong 2013 ). Consequently, structures of white supremacy and power constructed multiracial Chinatown populations, including Latinx, Black, and other Asian ethnic groups (Japanese, Filipino, Korean, South Asian, and Southeast Asians), as well as ethnic Europeans historically excluded from white Anglo-Saxon spaces, such as Italians and Portuguese, particularly those from the Azores. Ethnic studies scholars and community historians have noted that urban and rural Chinatowns across the United States have been and currently remain home to heterogeneous populations, including those in San Francisco ( Shah 2001 ), Los Angeles ( Cho 2004 , Quintana 2015 , Wild 2005 ), and Stockton, California ( Mabalon 2013 ); Seattle, Washington ( Chin 2009 ); and New York ( Lui 2005 , Tchen 1999 ).
Understanding Chinatowns as multiethnic/multiracial spaces helps archaeologists recognize racism as part of the everyday lived experiences of Chinese American communities rather than dismissing racism as isolated episodes of violence. While this section focuses on Chinatowns and not all multiethnic Chinese American spaces (e.g., work camps, farms, suburban communities, and segregated schools), this perspective forces archaeologists to foreground the role of institutional racism and to contend with racialized assumptions about the everyday lived experiences of Chinese American residents.
Ethnic studies and geography scholars provide key research on how to interpret racially segregated multiracial Chinatowns. Anderson (1991) theorizes on how the social construction of Chinatowns contributes to the racialization of Chinese bodies and the spaces they occupy as dirty, diseased, and foreign. Shah (2001) and Molina (2006) discuss the role of public health officials in socially constructing Chinatown and its residents and delineating Chinatown borders to contain public health threats in San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively. Public health officials, Shah (2001) writes, “readily conflated the physical condition of Chinatown with the characteristics of Chinese people,” whom they depicted “as a filthy and diseased ‘race’ who incubated such incurable afflictions such as smallpox, syphilis, and bubonic plague and infected white Americans” (pp. 1–2). Consequently, public health officials used their expertise to justify delineating quarantine boundaries to contain the threat of disease that was projected onto Chinese American bodies, contributing to perceptions of Chinatowns as separate, isolated spaces.
Ethnic studies scholars also study multiethnic/multiracial spaces and the social and economic interactions and relationships that Asian Americans have created in order to survive and thrive. Lai (2006) and Kurashige (2008) focus on interactions in mid-twentieth-century Japanese American and Black communities in San Francisco and Los Angeles, respectively. Cheng (2013) examines contemporary multiracial encounters between Chinese American and Latinx communities in the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California. This broader historical and geographical context is essential to how scholars explore the complex multiethnic/multiracial relationships, coalitions, and tensions that form in these spaces. Shah (2011) provides a theoretical framework of “stranger intimacies” to explore the social, economic, and sexual relationships that formed in segregated multiracial homosocial communities through which South Asian workers traversed in twentieth-century California. He argues that these intimacies were a means of survival under the racial economic cartel that maintained white supremacy in agricultural California.
Some archaeologists acknowledge that Chinese Americans lived and/or engaged in cross-ethnic/racial interactions within their heterogeneous home and work communities (e.g., Barna 2015 , Costello et al. 1998 , Fong 2013 , Kraus-Friedberg 2008 , Massey et al. 2013 , A. Praetzellis & M. Praetzellis 1998 , M. Praetzellis & A. Praetzellis 2004 , Sunseri 2020 , Voss 2020 ). Although these studies may recognize that overlapping racial occupations in segregated spaces had the potential to produce cross-ethnic/racial encounters, interactions, and relationships, this context is often in the background rather than foregrounded as a key example of the everyday impacts of institutional racism that have material consequences. Developing interdisciplinary archaeologies drawing from ethnic studies scholarship provides a theoretical and historical framework to develop increasingly nuanced archaeological understandings of Chinatowns and the multiethnic/multiracial relationships that Chinese Americans formed to survive and thrive within structures of institutional racism and white supremacy.
Antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies require attention to gender and sexuality. Asian American studies scholarship provides critical insight into the ongoing gendered racialization and racialized sexualization of Asian and Asian American bodies and communities (A. Lee 2001 , E. Lee 2005 , Lowe 2006 , Said 1979 , Tchen 1999 , H. Yu 2001 ). Both historically and in the present, moralizing discourses and hygienic movements map sin, depravity, and disease onto gendered Chinese American bodies, which directly impacts the safety and well-being of Chinese American communities ( Boyd 2003 ; Mazumdar 1996 ; Pascoe 1990 ; Peffer 1999 ; Shah 2001 ; Tong 1994 ; Yung 1995 , 1999 ).
Historical archaeologists often reproduce these discourses in ways that amplify racial, gendered, and sexual biases. Many Chinese American archaeology publications include sensationalized discussions of foot-binding and prostitution, even when there is no related archaeological content. Overreliance on government records can occlude the presence of Chinese American families. For example, historic censuses list few Chinese American women and children in San Jose's Chinatowns, but family histories and missionary records describe diverse households, including intergenerational households, heterosexual nuclear families, single parents, and single-gender households ( Voss 2008 , 2018b , 2020 ).
Too often, archaeological efforts to find evidence of Chinese American women rely on stereotypically feminine artifacts, such as jewelry, cosmetics, hair ornaments, and certain medicines and medical devices. This approach reduces Chinese American women to their appearance, sexuality, and reproductive capacities. Antiracist research interprets such artifacts through intersubjective lenses. Ng (2021 , p. 185) observes that, while glass bangles are typically interpreted as Chinese American women's jewelry, they were more commonly used as decorations on sewing baskets marketed by Chinatown merchants (predominantly men) to white consumers (predominantly women). Fong examines Western-style body care artifacts found in Isleton in the context of foreigner racialization. “[A] white glass Pond's cold cream jar, a rectangular glass perfume bottle, and a brass pressed powder lid embossed with ‘Golden Glow’” ( Fong 2013 , pp. 142, 144) are evidence of how women negotiated their positions both within the Chinese American community and as visible racialized subjects.
Gender relations were often central to interethnic alliances. Sunseri describes food sharing between Paiute and Chinese American households in Mono Mills, California, as exchanges that subverted the “European American social world,” which segregated laborers by race and gender ( Sunseri 2015b ; see also Sunseri 2015a , 2020 ). In San Jose, Chinese American women forged alliances with white missionaries by performing strategic Chinese-ness through gifts of imported teas, spices, and preserved fruits; simultaneously, many Chinatown households maintained sets of American-style tableware, utensils, and ingredients for hosting white guests, as well as dual wardrobes, with Western-style clothes to be worn when visiting white homes. In this context, “Western” artifacts in Chinatown homes are in fact indicators of the “double-consciousness” ( Du Bois 1897 ) through which Chinese Americans strategically navigated anti-Chinese racism.
Chinese American men living in predominantly homosocial communities such as work camps and tenements were stigmatized through heteropatriarchal and racist constructs ( Shah 2001 , Ting 1995 ). Williams (2008) examines racial and gendered discourses of porcelain cups: “To some Western eyes, watching [Chinese American men]…drink alcohol from these cups may have fit neatly into a discourse that feminized the Chinese, but for the individuals drinking from the cups, a historically situated Chinese discourse of masculinity tied to other Chinese discourses of class may have been created and recreated” ( Williams 2008 , p. 62). In a study of railroad work camps, Voss (2018a) mobilizes queer theories of precarity to trace how Chinese American men survived gendered labor exploitation under monopoly capitalism. Hunting, fishing, bartering, and craftwork reduced workers’ dependence on company stores, while high frequencies of medical artifacts speak to the structural violence exacted by railroad work on the bodies of Chinese American men ( Voss 2018a , pp. 291–94). In an archaeological and oral history study of worker housing on the Stanford University campus, Lowman (2020) examines Chinese American men's responses to gendered racism. Artifacts related to self-protection (barbed wire and bullet and shell casings) and gaming (coins and glass gaming pieces), along with martial arts practice and watching football, were evidence of team-based fraternal networks tied to performances of “an emergent Chinese American masculinity” ( Lowman 2020 , p. 122). These studies move archaeologies of gender in antiracist directions by challenging racialized gender discourses and foregrounding pluralism in gendered identities and experiences.
Another important shift in Chinese diaspora archaeologies that contributes to antiracist scholarship is research that examines the transpacific connections between the home villages of Chinese transmigrants and the diasporic sites where they lived (e.g., Byrne 2016 ; Ng 2020 , 2021 ; Voss et al. 2018 ). Transmigrants sent remittances and letters (ngàhnseun, yínxìn, 銀信) to their families in the home village, made return visits, and built new homes with money earned abroad ( Hsu 2000 , Liu & Li 2011 ). Transpacific approaches force us to think about communities and connections beyond nation-state boundaries. They provide a lens to understand Chinese transmigrants and Chinese Americans as agents who built lives for themselves in the United States and who cared for their families living on the other side of the Pacific.
Historians of migration from China have shown that those who ended up working and living in the United States and Canada maintained transnational lives in part because of strong anti-Chinese exclusion laws ( Hsu 2000 , Yu 2011 ). While these researchers focus on the impacts of immigration policy, Ng (2020 , 2021 ) uses an archaeological lens to understand how racism structured the everyday lives of Chinese transmigrants in two diasporically and transnationally linked sites: Chinatowns in San Bernardino and Riverside, California, and Wo Hing, a village in China that was built in part by remittances from residents of those Chinatowns. Through a study of material culture and the built environment, Ng provides material evidence that transnationalism and the ability to move across national borders did not elide race. For example, comparative analysis of buildings in the Riverside Chinatown and in Wo Hing reveals that the Chinatown structures reflect local Southern California vernacular architecture rather than emulating traditional building styles and ornamentation found in the home village. Chinese transmigrants had previously experienced racism with local building ordinances that targeted Chinese laundries in wooden structures. These past incidents informed transmigrants’ building practices in the United States and led to the construction of brick structures in the Riverside and San Bernardino Chinatowns, which helped them blend into the Western landscape rather than stand out. Material differences between the home village and Chinatowns force us to contend with a more focused understanding of agency, race, and racism in Chinese American communities.
Byrne (2016) notes that cultural heritage organizations in Australia, Canada, and the United States tend to celebrate the points of arrival of migrants and assimilation narratives, which results in the downplaying of racism. Byrne (2016) argues that drawing attention to the transnationally distributed built environment of Chinese transmigrants has the power to challenge these narratives and open up conversations on the impacts of anti-Chinese policies and white supremacy. In the United States, Chinese American buildings and archaeological sites are significantly underrepresented in the National Register of Historic Places ( Magalong & Mabalon 2016 , Odo 2017 ), even though several transnationally connected sites in China—particularly remittance-built houses and watchtowers—are inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List and are considered sites of global importance ( Tan 2013a , b ). This underrepresentation contributes to the further marginalization of Chinese Americans today and leaves important heritage places vulnerable to destruction. One way that archaeologists can protect and preserve Chinese American archaeological sites is to highlight the transpacific connections between Chinese American cultural heritage and remittance-built structures in China.
Archaeologists are publicly positioned as experts whose scholarship is accepted as historic truth. Much like our power to shape language and naming, our power to shape historic narratives for racialized communities means that our work in the present contributes to the social construction of ahistorical essentialized ideas about race in the past and present, directly impacting communities to whom this history belongs. Collaboration is one of the antiracist interventions that redistribute archaeologists’ narrative power. True collaboration moves beyond giving voice to the voiceless by centering community memory and action.
Exerting control over the historical narrative and countering racist formations in archaeological and historical discourses are often explicit goals of Chinese American stakeholders. In joining members of the descendant community walking the path of the transcontinental railroad, Peterson (2019) notes how descendants use archaeology in service of constructing collective memory. Material culture served as one touchstone for descendants to build a new narrative, which resulted in national recognition of the efforts of Chinese railroad workers. The development of new narratives about how we recognize and collectively memorialize Chinese American ancestors is one example of how we can use community collaboration to resist racist formations and of how engagement fundamentally shifts which research questions we ask and how we conduct archaeology on the ground or in existing collections ( Gonzalez et al. 2018 , Mack & Blakey 2004 ).
Antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies can build on community-based practices developed by BIPOC scholars ( Atalay 2012 , Blakey 2020 , Franklin & Lee 2020 , Gonzalez et al. 2018 , La Roche & Blakey 1997 ). Colwell-Chanthaphonh & Ferguson (2008) note that archaeology projects occur along a continuum of descendant community engagement. At one end, archaeologists present results to community members and organizations. At the other end, mutual contributions of community members and scholars forge research methods and interpretations that could not result without collaborative synergy. As we discuss below, Chinese Americans’ knowledge of the networks and diasporic connections of historic migrations has shifted archaeological inquiry from assimilation narratives to explore the materiality of the creation and maintenance of Chinese American identity ( Fong 2013 ), transnational communities ( Ng 2021 ), and the incorporation of new material forms in home villages ( Voss et al. 2018 ).
Chinese American communities historically have become involved in archaeological work usually as a reactionary measure because development has posed a threat to cultural heritage sites or the deceased's peaceful rest (e.g., Chung et al. 2005 ). In at least three cases, community activism pressured archaeological investigation and curation. Voss et al. (2013) detail how the Chinese American community of San Jose, California, fought for salvage excavation in Market Street Chinatown and how the subsequent “rediscovery” of the orphaned collection resulted in an explicitly multi-institutional, community-based research and education partnership. This trajectory contrasts with the more common situation where community members must mobilize and sustain pressure to prevent development from destroying historic sites, as with a proposed medical building at the archaeological site of Riverside Chinatown in 2008 ( Fuentes 2011 , Sagara 2014 ), or from disturbing historic cemeteries, as with the 2006 light rail extension in Los Angeles, California ( Gust et al. 2007 , Pierson 2006 ).

However, projects investigating Chinatowns in San Jose ( Allen et al. 2002 , Massey et al. 2013 , Voss et al. 2013 ); the ongoing Arboretum Chinese Labor Quarters Project (2018) in Stanford, California; and Chinatown–6 Hudson Street, Boston ( City of Boston 2020 ) utilized community-based and collaborative frameworks.

Section: 4. CONCLUSION

In the introduction to a thematic journal issue, “The Archaeology of Chinese Immigrant and Chinese American Communities,” Williams & Voss (2008) write that the articles within should be taken as a weathervane rather than a compass, indicating the state of research and emerging directions. In this article, we have attempted to take the compass in hand and chart a course for explicitly antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies that draw on interdisciplinary scholarship from ethnic studies and the work of BIPOC archaeologists.
Why is it essential for our field to be antiracist? Race and racism affect all parts of archaeological practice. It is crucial for archaeologists to take responsibility for the fact that investigating the materiality of Chinese American communities in the past affects the lives and experiences of Chinese Americans in the present. Archaeologists must similarly recognize the Chinese American community—past and present—as complex, heterogeneous, and constantly shifting within specific local, national, and global geopolitics and racialization ( Hsu 2015 , Lee 2015 ). Before we can build antiracist archaeologies, archaeologists must recognize the role of race in the development and operation of our discipline, including how racist structures prevent BIPOC archaeologists from entering and staying in the field. Archaeologists must also be reflexive about the ways in which archaeologists themselves often unintentionally produce and reproduce essentializing racial discourses.
This course we chart is based on maps created by Black and Indigenous archaeologists, who understand why it is absolutely necessary to diversify our field, in terms of both the stakeholders with whom we collaborate and the archaeologists conducting these studies (e.g., Atalay 2012 , Battle-Baptiste 2011 , Brunache 2019 , Franklin 1997 ). To diversify our field, there must be an institutional shift that supports BIPOC archaeologists who are creating their own inclusive space to recruit, retain, and mentor a community of practitioners that reflect the communities we study. Scholars at various intersections of identity (race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, disability, and indigeneity) have already called out the exclusionary structure in archaeology and the barriers to success outside the normative identity of a white cisgendered man ( Flewellen et al. 2021 , Heath-Stout 2020 , Ike et al. 2020 , Voss 2021 ). BIPOC archaeologists have begun creating institutional change in archaeology, including the establishment of the Society for Black Archaeologists in 2011 and the founding of the Indigenous Archaeology Collective and the Coalition for Diversity in California Archaeology in 2020. Building antiracist archaeologies requires sustained efforts such as these. Archaeologists in positions of power need to acknowledge inequities present in the structures of our discipline and commit to practicing self-reflection, employing active listening, and taking concrete steps toward disciplinary transformation.
Antiracist archaeologies must also move toward more nuanced understandings about how race, racism, and racialization operate and their impacts on archaeological research and practice. Interdisciplinary approaches drawing from ethnic studies and CRT help archaeologists recognize that race is a social construct with tangible consequences and that racism is inextricable from everyday life. Moreover, archaeology as a discipline needs to recognize the epistemic privilege of Chinese American archaeologists in the study of Chinese American communities. Their perspectives as racialized people uniquely position them to offer interpretations and nomenclature that provide key interventions in our field.
Our course to antiracist archaeologies begins with the understanding that “Chinese America” is not a monolith nor an easy category to define, despite historical discourses perpetuated today that amplify racial, gendered, and sexual biases of Western heteronormative and white-centric paradigms. As we discuss in this article, there are a multitude of potential avenues to dismantle this discourse and build antiracist archaeologies. Community-engaged projects that build reciprocity and mutually defined benefits into the structure of an archaeological investigation help challenge these assumptions by centering Chinese American epistemic privilege. This work highlights key components of the Chinese American experience, including an examination of multiethnic/multiracial relationships and spaces and a critical interrogation of the heterogeneity of Chinese American communities and experiences that challenge racialized assumptions. Likewise, the many gendered and racialized assumptions that archaeologists often bring to their interpretations about gender and sexuality in Chinese diaspora settings can be dismantled through engagement with Chinese American feminist and queer scholarship, as well as histories of gender and sexuality in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century China that provide potential avenues for dismantling gendered racialized discourse within archaeology and force a critical conversation of the assumptions we bring about Chinese American men and women to the archaeological past. Finally, a transpacific orientation that examines connections between home villages and the diasporic sites they built complicates the place-based tendency of archaeologists to stay within the frame of US national borders.
The directions we chart in this article are by no means the only ways to build antiracist Chinese diaspora archaeologies. They do provide, however, starting points for many possible courses. Other potential courses include developing Asian American archaeologies that study panethnic histories rather than separating experiences by ethnic group, as is typically done now ( Fong & Lai 2015 ). Furthermore, expanding transnational research beyond the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Pearl River Delta offers the promise of a truly global Chinese diaspora archaeology (e.g., McKeown 2001 ). We hope this review article encourages the imagination of many possible antiracist archaeological futures and inspires a deepening commitment to archaeologies that are responsive to the needs of descendants and stakeholders.
