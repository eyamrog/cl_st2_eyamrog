Title: Food Insecurity, Nutritional Inequality, and Maternal–Child Health: A Role for Biocultural Scholarship in Filling Knowledge Gaps


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

Food insecurity, a significant contributor to nutritional inequality, disproportionately affects women and children in low- and middle-income countries. The magnitude of the problem has inspired research on its impacts on health, especially on nutritional status and, more recently, mental well-being. Current research is dominated by surveillance-type studies that emphasize access, one of food security's four dimensions. Findings are inconclusive regarding the association between food insecurity and women and children's nutritional status, but some evidence indicates that it is a key contributor to mental distress in women. To understand these inconsistent findings, we emphasize the need for research on the strategies that people use to cope with inadequate access to food. We contend that biocultural approaches that recognize the importance of local contexts and the role of broader political-economic factors in shaping them are well suited for addressing current knowledge gaps.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Food is essential for survival, development, and function and has profound social and cultural significance as it functions to establish and maintain social bonds, acts as a signal of social status, and serves as an important component of one's identity. The inability to obtain sufficient food, i.e., being food insecure, therefore, has far-reaching biological as well social consequences. Unfortunately, the number of food-insecure people in the world is significant and has been increasing since 2015, reversing the steady downward trend seen earlier this century ( FAO et al. 2020 ). In 2019, an estimated 2 billion people—25% of the global population, or one in four people on the planet—were food insecure ( FAO et al. 2020 ). Although it is true that the majority (96%) of food-insecure individuals live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) ( FAO et al. 2020 ), food insecurity is also a reality for citizens of high-income nations. In the United States, for example, an estimated 14% of children live in food-insecure homes, and estimates for African American (23%) and Hispanic (17%) children are significantly higher ( Coleman-Jensen et al. 2020 ).
This review was written during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. In the 12 months since the pandemic was declared in March 2020, it has amplified existing food insecurity by disrupting global and local food systems, as well as through the loss of incomes ( HLPE 2020 ). In Latin America alone, the pandemic almost tripled the number of people requiring food assistance in the summer of 2020 ( United Nations 2020 ). In fact, the FAO et al. (2020) estimated that the pandemic would force an additional 83–132 million people into the ranks of the food insecure and undernourished in 2020.
Food insecurity is highly correlated with poverty and is a key contributor to nutritional inequality, i.e., disparities in the ability to consume a diet that meets nutritional needs. The increasing prevalence of food insecurity and related nutritional inequality is not the result of an insufficient food supply ( FAO et al. 2020 ) but, rather, unequal access to available food resulting from political-economic systems and related policies that concentrate wealth and power over food production, distribution, and consumption in the hands of the few ( Patel 2012 ). The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the inequities in these systems and policies, and thus long-term trends in food insecurity, remains to be seen.
The sheer magnitude and global pervasiveness of food insecurity have inspired a growing body of scholarship on the relationship between food insecurity and human health. Dominating this research are surveillance-type surveys that provide valuable information on the prevalence of food insecurity but offer inconclusive evidence of the linkages between food insecurity and health (e.g., Moradi et al. 2019 ). Anthropologists, however, are interested in understanding the strategies that people use to cope with food insecurity and in identifying the proximal pathways that link food insecurity and health while also recognizing that local dynamics are influenced by the broader political-economic context ( Hadley & Crooks 2012 ).
We have two goals in writing this review. The first is to provide a critical assessment of our current state of knowledge regarding the food security–health relationship. The second is to demonstrate the insights that biocultural approaches used by anthropologists and those in related disciplines can contribute to our understanding of this relationship. We begin with a brief overview of the concept of food security, including its four dimensions. We follow this with a discussion of the tools used to measure food security in the health-oriented literature and a critical review of our current state of knowledge regarding the association between food security and health. We limit our review to studies conducted in LMICs, which are home to most of the world's food insecure ( FAO et al. 2020 ). Within these countries, we focus on women as well as children under five years of age, as both have been the target of most research owing to their greater biological needs ( Prentice et al. 1996 , Torun et al. 1996 ) and, often, social vulnerabilities ( Ivers & Cullen 2011 , Pelto 1987 ). In terms of health outcomes, we concentrate on measures of women's and children's nutritional status as these are the focus of the current literature. However, we also review the newer body of work that has focused on maternal mental health. In the final section, we turn our attention to current gaps in knowledge and use case studies that emphasize anthropological methods to demonstrate the potential of a biocultural approach for refining our understanding of the food security–health relationship.

Section: FOOD SECURITY: A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONCEPT

The concept of food security, as used today, first appeared in The State of Food and Agriculture 1973 , the report where FAO Director General A.H. Boerma called attention to a deterioration in “world food security” resulting from poor harvests and subsequent depletion of grain stocks ( FAO 1973 ). The following year, the World Food Conference report defined food security in terms of availability and stability as “availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices” ( FAO 2003 , p. 27). In 1983, owing in part to the influence of Amartya Sen's work, which drew attention to unequal access to available food ( Jones et al. 2013 ), the FAO broadened the definition to include an access component: “ensur[ing] that all people at all times have both physical and economic access to the basic food they need” ( FAO 1983 , section 26a). The 1996 Rome Declaration on World Food Security expanded the definition to encompass nutrition and wellbeing: “Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” ( FAO 1996 ). This 1996 definition is the most often cited in the current literature, but, as Jones et al. (2013) note, there are many others.
As conceptualized by the FAO et al. (2013) , and used here, food security has four dimensions: availability, access, utilization, and stability ( Figure 1 ). The availability dimension is concerned with food production, food stocks, and trade. The access dimension recognizes that while food may be available, it may not be physically or economically accessible. The third dimension, utilization, includes the strategies that people use to cope with inadequate access to food—such as food choice, preparation, and intrahousehold food distribution—and culminates in biological utilization, the literal physical and mental embodiment ( Krieger 2001 ) of food in/security. The final dimension, stability, adds a time element to the other three dimensions and refers to the constancy of food at global, national, local, and household scales.

Linkages between the dimensions and the hierarchical relationships among availability, access, and utilization are illustrated in analysis by Block et al. (2004) of the household-level consequences of the 1997–1998 financial crisis and drought in central Java, Indonesia. The drought resulted in poor harvests, limiting food availability and driving up prices, which were already rising rapidly owing to the financial crisis. High food prices constrained household economic access to food. In the utilization domain, constrained access was reflected in food choices that included fewer higher-priced animal source foods and dark green leafy vegetables and resulted in a decline in diet quality. The weight-for-age of young children remained stable, but maternal body weight declined, leading the authors to suggest that mothers had modified intrahousehold food distribution to buffer children during the crisis. Child micronutrient status deteriorated as assessed by the increased prevalence of anemia, which the authors speculate was the result of a decline in the consumption of higher-priced, nutrient-rich foods.

Section: MEASURING FOOD SECURITY: ACCESS AND UTILIZATION

Jones et al. (2013) provide a useful overview of common tools used to measure the four dimensions of food security, including their scale (e.g., national, regional, household) and recall period (e.g., month, year), as well as specifics on data required and methods used to gather those data (e.g., aggregated food supply data, focus groups, surveys). While all four dimensions play a role in influencing health, access and utilization have been the foci of food security–health research.
Research in LMICs investigating the food security–health linkage emphasizes the access dimension and relies heavily on a core set of household-level questionnaires designed to measure the experience of being food insecure. Most common is the Household Food Insecurity Assessment Scale (HFIAS), a tool that became available in 2007 and was based on the US Household Food Security Survey Module (HFSSM) developed in the 1990s ( Supplemental Table 1 ). The newest tool is the FAO's Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) intended for global use ( Cafiero et al. 2018 ). All these tools include questions that probe respondents’ perceptions of having enough to eat and the quality/quantity of food in the diet, and they use standard cutoff values to classify households as food secure or mildly, moderately, or severely food insecure ( Coates et al. 2007 ).
In the utilization dimension, the food-related components—food choice, preparation, and distribution ( Figure 1 )—capture the complex human behaviors that shape what people eat. All are influenced by inadequate access to food. Thus, if the goal is to understand how food insecurity is embodied, physically and mentally, then studying utilization is essential. Unfortunately, few standardized tools are available. The tool most often used is the dietary diversity score (DDS), a count of the different food groups in the diet, e.g., cereals, leafy greens, white roots, and tubers ( Kennedy et al. 2010 ). Differences in the criteria for categorizing foods into groups, and for determining the level of measurement (e.g., household, individual), complicate comparisons between studies. For a helpful review of DDS as an indicator of food security, see Ruel (2003) . There are currently no standardized instruments for measuring the other food-related components of utilization such as food preparation or intrahousehold distribution, and they remain understudied.
The biological component of the utilization dimension is ultimately reflected in the nutritional status of individuals, that is, the biological status of individuals resulting from nutrient intake and the body's ability to digest, absorb, and utilize those nutrients for maintenance, growth, and reproduction. Malnutrition is a general term referring to poor nutritional status that encompasses under- and overnutrition. The tool of choice for assessing nutritional status is anthropometry. Among children, the most common measure is height-for-age, where the height-for-age z-score (HAZ) is used to define stunting (HAZ ≤ −2), a reflection of growth faltering over a sustained period owing to inadequate nutrition and/or repeated infections ( WHO 2006 ). Less common is the weight-for-height measure, where a low weight-for-height z-score (WHZ ≤ −2) is used to define wasting, a measure of thinness and generally indicative of recent nutritional deficiencies ( WHO 2006 ). The nutritional status of adult women is most often measured as body mass index [BMI; weight (kg)/height (m 2 )] and by applying the World Health Organization ( WHO 1995 ) cutoffs for underweight (BMI <18.5) and overweight/obesity (BMI ≥25).
Micronutrient deficiencies are also indicators of nutritional status but are rarely measured, even though standardized tools are available. The most frequently assessed micronutrient is iron, measured via blood hemoglobin. The adequacy of other micronutrients is sometimes inferred from measures of dietary diversity. In studies exploring the relationship between food security and mental health, questionnaires assessing mental distress, e.g., anxiety and depression, are commonly employed.

Section: FOOD SECURITY AND HEALTH

In reviewing the current state of knowledge on food security and the health of children 0–5 years of age and women of reproductive age, we focused on studies that directly tested the relationship between food security and health by measuring both food security and specific health outcomes of interest, namely, measures of nutritional status and maternal mental distress. Details on search criteria are included in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 .
Stunting and wasting are indicative of suboptimal growth and development, and both increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and measles ( Black et al. 2013 ). In addition, stunting, especially in children under age 3, is a well-known risk factor for poor motor and cognitive development ( Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007 ). In the studies we reviewed, stunting was the most common measure of nutritional status and hence health. All studies emphasized the access dimension of food security, with the HFIAS being the most common instrument employed. A few included data on dietary diversity, an indicator of utilization.
The national-level studies reviewed utilized cross-sectional data from nationally representative surveys to assess the relationship between household food security and children's nutritional status ( Supplemental Table 2 ). The findings are mixed; four studies reported a significant relationship, and three did not. Differences in analytical approaches make direct comparisons difficult. That said, two studies deserve further comment. The studies from Malawi ( Jones 2015 ) and Nepal ( Dorsey et al. 2018 ) use robust models that control for confounding variables, and neither identified a significant association between household food security and children's nutritional status. Both also included data on dietary diversity and aimed to determine if dietary diversity moderated the relationship between household food access and child outcomes; it did not. The study by Habib et al. (2016) was the only one that assessed micronutrient status. While they reported a significant association between food insecurity and anemia, they did not include dietary data.
The regional studies ( Supplemental Table 2 ) focused on resource-poor subpopulations in specific districts known, or suspected, to have a high prevalence of child undernutrition. Studies in rural areas of Africa and Asia predominated, and findings are inconsistent. All reported high levels of household food insecurity, and most reported high levels of stunting. However, half of the studies found a positive association between food insecurity and stunting; half did not. The reasons for the disparate results between studies are not apparent, but variation in local environmental and household contexts is likely responsible, at least in part. For example, the work of M'Kaibi et al. (2016) with small-scale Kenyan farmers considered two factors significant to rural agricultural communities: seasonality and district-level differences in agricultural productivity. They found that household food insecurity was associated with stunting in the preharvest season (season of scarcity) in both agricultural districts, but not in the postharvest and not when both seasons were combined. This finding highlights the need for longitudinal studies, especially in agricultural communities in seasonal environments.
Studies in urban settings in Africa and Asia are scarce. Unlike in rural zones, food production in urban settlements is minimal to nonexistent. Hence, access to food is income dependent, and the poor are at greatest risk of food insecurity. An elegant study by Mutisya et al. (2015) looked specifically at the potentially modifying effect of household wealth on the relationship between food security and child stunting in low-income urban households in Kenya. After stratifying households into wealth tertiles, the authors observed that within each tertile, increasing food insecurity tended to increase the risk of stunting. However, the association was significant only for the middle wealth tertile. This finding is contrary to the expectation that the relationship would be strongest in the poorest homes and suggests that the effect of wealth on the food security–stunting relationship may not be as straightforward as expected. Of the regional studies, only a few included dietary data, and only the study in India by Chandrasekhar et al. (2017) reported a significant association between dietary diversity and the likelihood of stunting.
The current literature does not consistently support the idea that inadequate access to food at the household level results in child undernutrition. In the 25 studies reviewed, only 13 found a positive relationship. The reasons for these mixed results can be attributed to differences in study methods and design but are more likely related to the fact that household food security is only one of the determinants of child nutritional status. For example, nonfood factors such as the impact of infection on child nutritional status are well known but rarely controlled for ( Black et al. 2013 ). The mixed findings may also be explained by variation in the actual foods in the diet, their preparation and distribution among household members, and the nuances of child feeding practices across studies (i.e., utilization domain). Unfortunately, these data are largely missing in the current literature. Finally, the assumption that the period of inadequate access to food corresponds to the timeframe when a child crosses the threshold between nourished and undernourished may not be warranted, an issue that Galvin (1988) points to in her work among the Turkana.
The linkages between household food insecurity and women's health in resource-poor settings in LMICs have received little attention compared with the research on children. The two main concerns have been undernutrition in mothers, especially as it relates to reproduction, and maternal mental distress. A recent concern has been on overweight mothers (BMI ≥25) with stunted children, a phenomenon referred to as the dual burden of malnutrition ( Wells et al. 2020 ). It occurs in a small percentage of households ( Dieffenbach & Stein 2012 , Jehn & Brewis 2009 ), particularly in places experiencing the nutrition transition ( Popkin et al. 2012 ), and is thought to be due, in part, to the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, where fetal undernutrition and early childhood undernutrition place individuals at an increased risk of overweight/obesity in adulthood in these contexts ( Jehn & Brewis 2009 , Wells et al. 2020 ). In the literature reviewed, we distinguish, where relevant, income levels within LMICs (i.e., low income, low-middle income, and upper-middle income) to highlight differences in food insecurity and health outcomes ( Supplemental Table 3 ).
Underweight (BMI <18.5) in women is most often a manifestation of chronic dietary energy deficiency and is prevalent in LMICs, especially in Africa and Asia ( Black et al. 2013 ). Underweight in women is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, lower levels of physical activity, and an increased risk of birthing a low-birth-weight infant ( Kurpad et al. 2005 ). Overweight, by comparison, reflects chronic positive energy balance. It is increasingly prevalent in upper-middle-income countries experiencing economic growth and dietary transitions and is associated with the risk of chronic, diet-related diseases ( Popkin et al. 2012 ). BMI cutoffs for underweight (BMI <18.5) and overweight (BMI ≥25) are the same for all populations, although a lower cutoff for overweight is sometimes used for Asian populations ( WHO Expert Consult. 2004 ).
The association between food insecurity and women's BMI is different in low-income in comparison with upper-middle-income countries. In rural settings in low-income countries, the prevalence of underweight is high (15–40%), and regional studies consistently report that food insecurity is associated with underweight ( Abdu et al. 2018 , Abraham et al. 2015 , Bekele et al. 2020 , McDonald et al. 2015 ). In contrast, in both rural and urban settings in upper-middle-income countries, the prevalence of underweight tends to be low and the BMI distribution is shifted to the right. Findings from regional studies in these settings are inconsistent, but positive associations between food insecurity and higher BMI are common ( Jomaa et al. 2017 , Pei et al. 2018 ). Similarly, nationally representative studies from the upper-middle-income countries of Mexico and Brazil have found that mild food insecurity is associated with higher BMIs ( Jones et al. 2017 , Velásquez-Melendez et al. 2011 ).
The most common indicator of micronutrient deficiencies in women is anemia, a symptom of iron deficiency, the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the world ( de Benoist et al. 2008 ). Anemia is associated with a number of adverse health consequences, including reduced work capacity ( Haas & Brownlie 2001 ), poor iron transfer from mothers to infants, and preterm and low-birth-weight infants ( Balarajan et al. 2011 ). Although anemia has multiple causes ( Balarajan et al. 2011 ), it is often assumed to be the result of inadequate dietary iron intake. Hence, intuitively we would expect anemia to be associated with food insecurity. Available studies support this assumption for the low-income countries of Bangladesh and Cambodia ( Ghose et al. 2016 , McDonald et al. 2015 ) and the upper-middle-income countries of Mexico and Ecuador ( Jones et al. 2017 , Weigel et al. 2016 ).
In summary, we found limited data on the association between food insecurity and women's nutritional status. In low-income countries, food insecurity is associated with underweight, whereas in upper-middle-income countries it is associated with overweight. In both low- and upper-middle-income countries, food insecurity is associated with anemia. The limited research available and the lack of information on dietary intake limit our ability to understand the pathways between food insecurity and the health outcomes measured.
For many reasons, we should expect food insecurity to undermine mental well-being. Most studies suggest that nonnutritional pathways related to the management of inadequate access to food drive this association ( Weaver & Hadley 2009 ). We found the relationship between food insecurity and mental well-being to be the most consistent of any of the health outcomes reviewed ( Supplemental Table 3 ). While studies varied geographically, in sample size, and in women's age and reproductive status, as well as in the instruments used to measure the two principal variables, all studies have found food insecurity to be a predictor of mental distress. We highlight two particularly insightful studies to support this association.
The first is a study by Hadley & Patil (2008) among Sukuma agropastoralists and Pimbwe horticulturists in Tanzania. The authors demonstrated that a decline in food security across seasons was associated with a decline in mental well-being, with the Pimbwe disproportionately affected. Their ethnographic data suggested that group differences may be related to the fact that the lean season among the Pimbwe, unlike the Sukuma who rely on animals for labor, coincides with increased physical labor. Hadley & Patil (2008) provide a unique longitudinal study that captured changes in food security over time and directly addressed the question of directionality, i.e., does food insecurity lead to poor mental health, or does poor mental health lead to food insecurity?
The second study, by Sparling et al. (2020) , addressed the relative role of micronutrient deficiencies versus social pathways linking food security and mental health. It is one of the few studies to include data on food access (HFIAS), dietary diversity, and micronutrient levels (anemia status). The authors found that both more severe food insecurity and lower dietary diversity predicted mental distress among women in rural Bangladesh. A lack of data on women's micronutrient status as it relates to dietary diversity is a limitation. Also lacking are data on the social meaning of the foods women consume, which should be considered when exploring the relative importance of biological and social pathways linking food security and mental health.
Although the literature offers consensus regarding the food security–mental distress relationship, as with the studies focused on nutritional status, most studies lack contextual data and fail to investigate how food insecurity undermines mental well-being, which would include the mental strain of managing inadequate access to food.
Stunting and wasting are indicative of suboptimal growth and development, and both increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases such as diarrhea, pneumonia, and measles ( Black et al. 2013 ). In addition, stunting, especially in children under age 3, is a well-known risk factor for poor motor and cognitive development ( Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007 ).

In both low- and upper-middle-income countries, food insecurity is associated with anemia.

It is one of the few studies to include data on food access (HFIAS), dietary diversity, and micronutrient levels (anemia status). The authors found that both more severe food insecurity and lower dietary diversity predicted mental distress among women in rural Bangladesh. A lack of data on women's micronutrient status as it relates to dietary diversity is a limitation. Also lacking are data on the social meaning of the foods women consume, which should be considered when exploring the relative importance of biological and social pathways linking food security and mental health.
Although the literature offers consensus regarding the food security–mental distress relationship, as with the studies focused on nutritional status, most studies lack contextual data and fail to investigate how food insecurity undermines mental well-being, which would include the mental strain of managing inadequate access to food.

Section: THE POTENTIAL OF BIOCULTURAL APPROACHES

The current literature is dominated by studies relating one dimension of food security—access—with health outcomes. This limited scope is likely due to the development of the HFIAS instrument, which is easy to administer and has been validated for use in many different countries. The focus on access bypasses the utilization domain ( Figure 1 ), obscuring the strategies that people use to manage food insecurity and, thus, the proximal pathways by which inadequate access to food is ultimately embodied. These strategies play out within the household, which, as pointed out 30 years ago by Gittelsohn (1991) , remains a black box. Household-level strategies are, of course, embedded in broader sociocultural, political-economic, and environmental contexts, and we suggest that using biocultural approaches to investigate household coping strategies can help explain how food insecurity affects health.
While the term biocultural remains loosely defined in the anthropological literature ( Wiley & Cullin 2016 ), a goal of biocultural scholarship has been to trace the pathways by which everyday lived experiences shape health ( Leatherman & Goodman 2020 ). To do so, scholars advocate for a deep understanding of the local context to identify and operationalize the cultural variables relevant to the biological outcome(s) of interest ( Dufour 2006 , 2009 ), while also recognizing that the broader political economy shapes local contexts and influences human agency ( Goodman & Leatherman 1998 , Hicks & Leonard 2014 , Himmelgreen et al. 2013 ). Here we highlight research that delves into the black box to explore how people manage inadequate access to food to demonstrate how biocultural scholarship can advance understanding of the food security–health relationship. We organize our discussion around the components of the utilization domain: food choice, food preparation, and intrahousehold food distribution. These components have a hierarchical relationship; e.g., food choice precedes preparation and prepared foods are distributed among household members, which together ultimately determine the nutritional intakes of individuals. In the final section of this review, we turn to a neglected topic encapsulated within the utilization domain: physical activity levels. Because a reduction in physical activity is a response to inadequate dietary intake, with significant implications for people's ability to manage food insecurity, we see this topic as essential for future research.
Food choice is most often measured using a DDS, i.e., a count of food groups consumed by a household or individual ( Ruel 2003 ). In terms of food security, investigators have generally hypothesized that poor access results in a low DDS, which increases the risk of nutrient inadequacy and hence undernutrition ( Arimond & Ruel 2004 , Rah et al. 2010 ). However, as illustrated in this review, data on food choice are often lacking in the food security–health literature, and, when they are included, findings are inconclusive ( Supplemental Table 2 ). If a key question is how inadequate access to food affects food choice and, consequently, people's health, then DDS is a blunt instrument because it tells us little about the actual foods consumed and nothing about their meaning to those who select and consume them. For example, farmers in Lao People's Democratic Republic, who rely on glutinous rice as a base for meals, will mix rice with less expensive and less socially valued cassava roots during periods of seasonal food stress ( Van Esterik 2006 ). This practice increases the DDS score but obscures the fact that the increased DDS is a coping strategy.
The longitudinal study by Dufour et al. (1997) among urban Colombian women illustrates the power of a biocultural approach for understanding food choices under conditions of inadequate access. The women in the study lived in a state of chronic income uncertainty owing to a reliance on work in the informal economy, and when money was in short supply, they altered meal composition. A common strategy was to substitute eggs for more valued meat and to omit vegetables; these choices altered their DDS but did not necessarily affect the protein or energy content of the diet. Another choice was to substitute chicken feet for meat, which did not alter DDS but did reduce protein intake. For most women, these meal alterations were intermittent, not chronic, and were not associated with nutritional status. However, ethnographic data on the social meaning of foods revealed that these strategies invoked feelings of shame.
The mental health consequences of altering food choice in response to inadequate access have been explored in greater depth by Hadley, Weaver, and colleagues in their work in Brazil and Ethiopia ( Hadley et al. 2016 , 2019 ; Weaver et al. 2019 ). These studies confirm that within a cultural group, people agree on the prestige value of foods and, when access is inadequate, are forced to consume less prestigious foods and a lower variety of foods. Piperata et al. (2016 , 2020) report similar findings in Nicaragua. In all three settings, changes in the types and variety of foods undermined mental health owing to their association with poverty and low social status. In some of these settings, additional pathways linked food choice to poor mental health. For example, in Ethiopia, food choice alterations precluded households from participating in important social activities and, for Nicaraguan mothers, undermined their ability to meet the cultural definition of a good mother.
Food preparation methods are also opportunities for managing inadequate access to food. One is food stretching. Hampshire et al. (2009) describe the stretching of the dietary staple, boule , during the 2004–2005 food crisis in Niger. Boule , a porridge of millet, water, sugar, and curdled milk, was stretched by increasing the water-to-millet ratio as food insecurity worsened and simplified by eliminating the sugar and milk. Piperata et al. (2020) report that Nicaraguan mothers altered the staple dish, gallo pinto (rice, beans, fried onion), by increasing the ratio of rice to beans when money was inadequate. The nutritional implications of these strategies for coping with inadequate access to food would be invisible if dietary data were lacking or limited to a DDS.
That most food preparation requires water argues for biocultural research to investigate the synergistic effects of food and water insecurity on health ( Brewis et al. 2020 , Wutich 2020 , Wutich & Brewis 2014 ). We know, for example, that boiling improves the digestibility of carbohydrate staples such as roots and grains ( Wang & Copeland 2013 ) and that water is essential for detoxifying staple crops such as manioc ( Dufour 1995 ), but few data are available to demonstrate how inadequate access to water can exacerbate food insecurity via food choice and preparation. A recent qualitative study indicates that water insecurity impacted infant feeding practices by altering the foods that mothers chose and delaying the timing of feeding ( Schuster et al. 2020 ). This area deserves further inquiry.
A third component of the utilization dimension is the distribution of food within the household. Cultural beliefs and values influence who eats what and how much ( Berti 2012 , Haddad et al. 1996 ). A common assumption is that adults, particularly mothers, buffer children from food insecurity, an idea that is grounded in ethnographic research ( Coates et al. 2006 , Radimer et al. 1992 ). However, few studies include the quantitative data required to measure it or frame it as a response to food insecurity ( Berti 2012 ). Gittelsohn and colleagues’ work in Nepal ( Gittelsohn 1991 , Gittelsohn et al. 1997 ) illustrates the power of a biocultural approach for understanding intrahousehold food distribution and its effects on intakes. To generate locally salient hypotheses regarding potential nutritional inequalities among household members, the authors began with systematic direct observations of family meals (e.g., serving order, amounts served), which they then tested with quantitative data on dietary intakes of individuals. They found no differences in the distribution of carbohydrate staples or dietary energy adequacy among family members. However, meat and vegetables, foods rich in important micronutrients, were preferentially allocated to adult men and young children of both genders.
Another example is Leonard's (1991) study in highland Peru, where he documents adults nutritionally buffering children in the preharvest food scarcity season and its positive association with children's nutritional status. Piperata et al. (2013) , in their study of mother–child pairs in rural Amazonian communities, demonstrate that children's energy and protein intakes were more adequate (intake/need) than those of their mothers and that younger children were buffered more than older children. The authors also show that buffering was most evident when households had some food but not enough to meet the needs of all members. In contrast, when food stocks were extremely low (severe food insecurity) or adequate (food secure), buffering was less pronounced or absent. In both studies, ethnographic data, including detailed field observations, help explain the quantitative findings. In Peru, seasonal nutritional buffering allowed children to maintain activity levels necessary to accomplish important subsistence chores year-round. In the Amazon, buffering was related to maternal perceptions of child vulnerability and the inability to reason with young children when food supplies were low, which led mothers to acquiesce to children's demands.
These biocultural studies illustrate how quantitative data on individual intakes can reveal how food insecurity is differentially experienced by members of the same household and can explain how adult perceptions of household food access might not align with children's nutritional status. Although intrahousehold food distribution is clearly important, it is also worth noting that in many parts of the world, food exchange between households is likely a critical strategy for coping. Some of the most informative work on this topic has been conducted among First Nations people living in the Canadian Arctic (e.g., Collings et al. 2016 , Harder & Wenzel 2012 ). As made clear in a recent review ( Nosratabadi et al. 2020 ), this strategy deserves more attention in the food security literature.
The coping strategies discussed above shape the intakes of household members. In terms of children, the period of complementary feeding (6–24 months) is critical because growth and development are most rapid and the decline in HAZ leading to stunting progresses most precipitously during this time ( Victora et al. 2010 ). It is also a critical window for the development of the gut microbiome, which is shaped in large part by diet ( Dominguez-Bello et al. 2011 ). The WHO (2003) and extensive work by Pelto and colleagues (e.g., Pelto et al. 2013 ) assert that complementary feeding is as much about the foods (e.g., types, special preparation) as it is the context of feeding and care (e.g., timing of initiation, frequency, and assistance with eating). Furthermore, Panter-Brick (1992) reminds us that the context of feeding is shaped by mothers’ work patterns and the broader household economy. Thus, a critical question is how inadequate access to food influences complementary feeding and hence children's health.
While the influence of inadequate food access on feeding and health is addressed in the food security–health literature (e.g., Janmohamed et al. 2020 , Osei et al. 2010 , Saha et al. 2008 ), data are limited to DDS and, in some cases, minimal meal frequency, which are crude measures of intake. In contrast, biocultural studies reveal variation in the quality of the diet among populations and offer insights into how the local context shapes feeding practices in food-insecure environments (e.g., Dettwyler 1986 , Gray 1996 , Panter-Brick 1992 ). For example, the complementary diet of Ngisonyoka pastoralists in Kenya ( Gray 1996 ), which includes milk and butterfat, would have a low DDS but is likely more nutrient dense than that of children in Mali and Nepal, whose diets include a greater variety of foods but are dominated by bulky staples (i.e., foods with low nutrient density) ( Dettwyler 1986 , Panter-Brick 1992 ). These detailed biocultural studies also reveal substantial variation in feeding practices. Ngisonyoka infants are fed frequently and force-feeding was observed. In Mali and Nepal, feeding was infrequent (3–4 times per day), and, in Mali, young children were expected to initiate their own feeding ( Dettwyler 1986 ).
Across contexts, maternal work demands influenced complementary food choices and feeding frequencies. For example, Panter-Brick (1992) attributes better intakes among low-caste Kami (blacksmith) children compared with higher-caste Tamang (agropastoral) children to differences in seasonal maternal work patterns. Among the Tamang, younger children ate more frequently and had higher intakes during the monsoon season, owing in part to consuming snacks while accompanying their mothers in agricultural work. Older children, left behind during the day, had poorer intakes. Future biocultural research on this topic could adopt many of the methods used in these studies, as well as the ethnographic tool developed by Pelto et al. (2013) . Considering the central role of women in provisioning children, studies should also consider how maternal health and the time and energy demands involved in coping with food insecurity influence child feeding practices.
The biological component of the utilization domain captures the outcomes of inadequate access to food at the individual level. Nutritional status has been the primary outcome measure of inadequate dietary intakes, although other biological measures could also be used. These include intestinal absorption, state of the microbiome, infant birth weight, and physical activity. The last measure, physical activity, includes reductions in total energy expenditure that are physiologically driven and hence are not under conscious control, as well changes in behavior that alter the types of activities undertaken. These activity changes are strategies for coping with inadequate dietary energy intake, which biocultural approaches can help illuminate.
Experiments have demonstrated the effect of changes in dietary energy intake on physical activity. The most known is the Minnesota experiment in which adult males spent more time at rest as energy intake was systematically reduced ( Keys et al. 1950 ). In contrast, supplementation studies among marginally nourished Indonesian and Mexican children showed that higher energy intakes resulted in increased physical activity ( Chavez et al. 1995 , Jahari et al. 2000 ).
Studies of objectively measured physical activity in free-living populations suffering energy stress are scarce. We focus here on studies of adult women because of their central role in household food procurement, preparation, and provisioning, all of which require physical work. For example, Ferro-Luzzi et al. (1992) report that underweight Ethiopian women devoted more time to rest and less to work activities than did women with normal BMIs. The study does not clarify, however, the significance of these findings in terms of women's strategies for coping with food insecurity.
In comparison, Jenike's (1996) study of Lese agriculturalists in Zaire provides insights into the changes in physical activities that women used to manage food insecurity. He found that women increased the time devoted to some work activities, specifically those with immediate payoffs in terms of food, and the water and fuel needed to prepare it, but reduced time in activities that were less essential to immediate survival. This observation is a good example of how changes in physical activity may interact with other aspects of food security such as food preparation and the provisioning of children.
In sum, making changes to physical activity is one of the ways that individuals accommodate inadequate access to food. Biocultural studies can provide insight into how these accommodations affect women's capacity to manage household food insecurity.
Food choice is most often measured using a DDS, i.e., a count of food groups consumed by a household or individual ( Ruel 2003 ).

Section: CONCLUSION

Food security is a complex, multidimensional concept that is challenging to operationalize. As a result, research on the topic typically focuses on a single dimension. In the food security–health literature, the focus has been on the access dimension. This review has revealed an inconsistent relationship between food access and health outcomes. The strongest relationship is between food access and women's mental health, which is logical considering that food security questionnaires measure women's perceptions of their ability to successfully procure food and provision those in their care. The relationship between food access and the nutritional status of women and children, however, is less direct, which may explain the inconsistent findings. The proximal pathways linking access to actual dietary intakes, which include food choice, preparation, and intrahousehold distribution, are shaped by the local context and, therefore, are expected to vary. All these pathways fall under the utilization domain and remain underexplored. We maintain that biocultural approaches are well suited to illuminate these pathways and thus to clarify how food insecurity is ultimately embodied. Anthropologists are theoretically and methodologically well equipped to conduct this needed research. Finally, as the number of food-insecure people continues to rise, anthropologists working in affected communities worldwide are witness to the impacts on individuals and households and are thus positioned to draw attention to the inequities faced by those whose bodies get counted but whose voices remain largely unheard and for whom sustained relief remains elusive.
