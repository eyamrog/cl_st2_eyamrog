Title: Liminal Light and Primate Evolution


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

The adaptive origins of primates and anthropoid primates are topics of enduring interest to biological anthropologists. A convention in these discussions is to treat the light environment as binary—night is dark, day is light—and to impute corresponding selective pressure on the visual systems and behaviors of primates. In consequence, debate has tended to focus on whether a given trait can be interpreted as evidence of nocturnal or diurnal behavior in the primate fossil record. Such classification elides the variability in light, or the ways that primates internalize light in their environments. Here, we explore the liminality of light by focusing on what it is, its many sources, and its flux under natural conditions. We conclude by focusing on the intensity and spectral properties of twilight, and we review the mounting evidence of its importance as a cue that determines the onset or offset of primate activities as well as the entrainment of circadian rhythms.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Light is devoid of mass, but it is hardly immaterial, supporting practically all life on Earth. The profound importance of light lies in its energy and the transfer of that energy , on impact, to bound electrons—a process termed photoexcitation or absorption. Photopigments absorb light and begin the reactions that transform photon energy into a different state, such as chemical energy in the case of photosynthesis or electrical energy in the case of vision. This latter process, termed phototransduction, transforms photons and the absorbing organisms in fundamental ways. Here, our focus is on the photopigments of primates and the conditions that determine phototransduction. In short, we are concerned with light itself and its transmission, transformation, and internalization in primate bodies, a sequence of transitions that invites use of the term liminal.
Liminality refers to any “betwixt and between” situation or object ( Turner 1967 , p. 93). Initially, van Gennep [1960 ( 1909 )] used the term to categorize the importance of transitional experiences, particularly rites of initiation among small-scale societies. It was intended to capture process, the in-between periods when important events are unfolding. A strength of the concept is that it has no ambition to explain anything ( Thomassen 2009 ). It merely calls attention to transitional moments and argues that the importance of such moments is out of proportion to their duration. Liminality has since become an enduring concept in cultural anthropology, and some authors describe it as a master concept across the social and political sciences (for a review, see Thomassen 2009 ).
The flexibility of the term creates some challenges, however, for it is applicable to both time and space, which is fitting when discussing light and vision. Take, for example, the light of V762 Cas, the most distant star visible to the unaided eye. It is located 16,308 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. We see it due to a succession of liminal states over varying temporal domains—the transit of photons across space (thousands of years), the transformation of photons during transduction (picoseconds), and their manifestation as a visual image (milliseconds). If light is a form of information ( Dusenbery 1992 ), then seeing V762 Cas is a form of information gathering; and given that some primates are better equipped than others to see dim starlight, there is an underlying evolutionary timescale too.
Yet another temporal scale involves the rotation of Earth and the daily conditions of day and night. The differences between these light environments have had a profound impact on the adaptive radiation of life on Earth and have been a subject of enduring interest among biological anthropologists, especially those with an interest in anthropoid origins ( Ross 2000 ). But these conditions are in a constant state of transition or flux. Passing clouds, for example, can affect the amount and color of light available for vision. And, of course, many primates are agents in their own light conditions, moving vertically or laterally into the forest understory, which has its own distinct quality of light ( Endler 1993 ). Twilight is perhaps the quintessential example of liminal light, existing betwixt and between day and night. It is also the subject of growing interest in several biological disciplines, and it emerges as a central topic in the present review.
As a framing concept, liminality is practical for drawing attention away from binary states such as night and day and toward transient light conditions. Such conditions are challenging for animal visual systems, which must shift from filtering overabundant light reaching the retina to capturing scarce photons and amplifying photoexcitation ( Munz & McFarland 1973 ). It stands to reason that liminal light conditions have exerted a selective pressure on primate photopigments, a subject that extends beyond vision to include the subliminal—the level below which sensation is perceptible but nonetheless critical for primate physiology and behavior. Our goal with the present review is to call attention to recent advances in the measurement of liminal light and to cast this light on our understanding of primate evolution. But first, we must briefly introduce each type of photoreceptor and its response to light.
The number of photons incident on the cornea is always greater (by a factor of 2 to 10) than those available to photoreceptors in the retina. This loss of light occurs during transmission through ocular media (cornea, lens, and vitreous humor). The lenses of primates also filter wavelengths <400 nm ( Douglas & Jeffery 2014 ), which sets the lower limit to our visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm). These factors shape the properties of light available for transduction in the primate retina, which is equipped with two types of image-forming photoreceptors—cones and rods—as well as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). The luminance range over which cones operate is approximately 0.03–10 8 cd/m 2 (candela per square meter, the photopic range), whereas the dynamic range of rods is much lower: approximately 10 −6 –10 cd/m 2 . Such a span includes the scotopic range, when cones are inactive, and the mesopic range, when rods and cones are both active (typically defined as luminance levels between 0.03 and 3 cd/m 2 ). Each receptor absorbs light according to its own spectral sensitivity and generates a measure of illuminance , which is ultimately combined via retinal wiring (including the ipRGCs themselves) to produce a weighted, integrated signal with downstream effects on primate physiology and behavior.
Cones are an ancient cell type that arose under diurnal conditions among early metazoans. Vertebrates possess ciliary-type cones, which are less sensitive than the microvillar photoreceptors of invertebrates but more energetically efficient ( Fain et al. 2010 ). The threshold for mammalian cone activation is relatively high; in humans, for example, activation requires about 200 photons ( Koenig & Hofer 2011 ) to initiate the phototransduction cascade from the cone cell to the synapsed horizontal and bipolar cells and onward through the optic nerve. Cones have high temporal and spatial resolution and are responsible for visual acuity and—when neighboring retinal cone cells are maximally sensitive to different wavelengths of light—color vision ( Bowmaker 1998 , Kefalov 2012 ). The spatial and color vision functions of cones are facilitated by relatively low signal summation (i.e., cone cells synapse with one or a few retinal neurons), resulting in high resolution ( Peichl 2005 ).
Primate cones contain a visual pigment, the cone opsin, that is covalently linked to 11- cis- retinal, a vitamin A–derived chromophore. Exchanging the amino acids of the cone opsins shifts the wavelengths of light to which the cone cell is maximally sensitive (λ max ), a tuning mechanism that has been shaped repeatedly during vertebrate evolution, including in primates, by the color and amount of ambient light in the environment ( Levine & MacNichol 1982 , Yokoyama 2002 , Hunt et al. 2009 , Kawamura & Melin 2018 ). When a single cone type is present, the λ max typically matches the most abundant wavelengths of light; however, when retinal cones express two or more opsins, the neural comparison of their response provides the basis for color vision. Four different classes of cone were present in the ancestral vertebrate: two shortwave-sensitive (SWS1, λ max 355–445 nm, and SWS2, λ max 400–470 nm), a middlewave-sensitive (MWS, λ max 480–530 nm), and a longwave-sensitive (LWS, λ max 500–570 nm) ( Peichl 2005 , Bowmaker 2008 ). Two of these opsins (SWS1 and LWS) remained functional in the ancestor of placental mammals following an extended phase of low-light activity, often referred to as the nocturnal bottleneck, enabling dichromatic color vision. Uniquely among mammals, many primates have added a third color channel and possess trichromatic color vision through duplication or allelic variation of the opsin gene coding for LWS pigments, OPN1LW ( Jacobs & Nathans 2009 ). Owing to the reclamation of additional sensitivity to middle wavelengths, these cones are termed LWS and MWS in primates, and their λ max spans 530–563 nm.
The evolution of rod photoreceptors dramatically expanded the dynamic range of the retina. With a derived photopigment, rhodopsin , rods are 100 times more sensitive than cones. Their evolution added the capacity for vision under scotopic conditions, augmenting the existing cones for fast photopic vision ( Fain et al. 2010 ) ( Figure 1 a ). A duplex retina was a major contributor to the adaptive radiation of vertebrates, including primates, and it has been maintained in a wide diversity of extant species, although the cone-to-rod ratio is highly variable and responsive to selective pressures ( Walls 1942 ). For example, rods represent 0–95% of retinal photoreceptors ( Peichl 2005 ) among diurnal mammals whose evolutionary roots include a prolonged nocturnal period ( Maor et al. 2017 ). Species with minority populations of rods include the ground squirrel, for which cones comprise 70% (periphery) to 95% (visual streak) of photoreceptors, and tree shrews (order Scandentia), for which cones comprise 86–99% of photoreceptors ( Müller & Peichl 1989 , Kryger et al. 1998 ). Among nocturnal mammals, a great majority (approximately 97%) of photoreceptors are rods, revealing their essential function in low-light photic environments ( Peichl 2005 ).

Rods can generate single- photon responses that propagate through the retina to produce visual images. This level of sensitivity is simply astounding, having attained the limit dictated by quantum physics ( Pugh 2018 ). It is also conserved in vertebrates despite considerable variation in rod morphology ( Morshedian & Fain 2017 ), including in primates ( Joffe et al. 2014 ), which is most likely related to rod recovery rates. Another source of variation lies with the spectral sensitivity (λ max ) of rhodopsin. Yokoyama et al. (2008) reported a wide range of λ max values among vertebrates (480–525 nm) and found that it was governed by amino acid replacements at 12 critical sites in the RH1 gene. In primates, there is some evidence for functional variation at these sites. For example, Zhao et al. (2009b) inferred λ max values ranging from 497 nm in Homo and Pan to 499 nm in Macaca spp. to 501 nm in Otolemur crassicaudatus . These values differ somewhat from those obtained via microspectrophotometry [ Homo : λ max = 498 nm ( Bowmaker & Dartnall 1980 ); Macaca : λ max = 500 nm ( Bowmaker et al. 1980 )] or physiological recordings [λ max = 491 nm for humans and macaques ( Schnapf et al. 1988 )], which would suggest that much of this variation is methodological. In any event, prereceptor filtering is expected to shift these values toward somewhat longer wavelengths (e.g., 507 nm in the standard human observer) ( Figure 1 a ). The amino acid positions in RH1 with the greatest effect on λ max (13, 225, and 346) are invariant across seven diurnal primate species and O. crassicaudatus ( Fernández-Sampedro et al. 2016 ), a nocturnal strepsirrhine with cone monochromatic vision. Taken together, the available evidence suggests little meaningful variation in the activation threshold and broad spectral sensitivity of rods in primate visual systems.
In a groundbreaking paper, Berson et al. (2002) found that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) express blue-sensitive (λ max ≈ 480 nm) melanopsin in the cellular membrane and are therefore photosensitive. The proportion of RGCs expressing melanopsin is small—accounting for about 2% of cells ( Hattar et al. 2002 )—but the pigment is widespread and spectrally invariant across chordates ( Lucas et al. 2014 ). The quantum efficiency of melanopsin is comparable to that of cone opsins and rhodopsin ( Do et al. 2008 ); however, ipRGCs lack specialized photopigment-concentrating organelles (such as rod/cone outer segments) to maximize the absorbance of light. The probability of photon capture is therefore over one million times lower than in rods or cones for a given area of photostimulation ( Do et al. 2008 ). The ipRGC phototransduction cascade has high amplification ( Do et al. 2008 ), but photoreception is much less sensitive than that of cones or rods. When the threshold for melanopsin activation is reached (at radiance levels equivalent to indoor lighting: approximately 214 cd/m 2 ) ( Allen et al. 2019 ), the response scales with stimulus intensity over several decimal orders ( Berson et al. 2002 ) and is remarkably persistent, being sustained over long durations of constant illumination ( Wong 2012 ).
Additionally, immunohistochemistry has revealed melanopsin-containing cones in the human peripheral retina ( Dkhissi-Benyahya et al. 2006 ). They are sparse (5–25 cones/mm 2 ), present only in the periphery (approximately 20° from the foveal area), and devoid of any other photopigment. Other researchers have found melanopsin labeling in mouse cones, but it is uncertain whether melanopsin-expressing cones produce a meaningful physiological signal.
The photosensitivity of ipRGCs has functional consequences that persist long after the discontinuation of light exposure ( Do et al. 2008 ). For example, recent findings suggest that RGCs directly mediate pupil constriction and behaviors such as vigilance and sleep, phenomena that also vary with the color of light ( Lucas et al. 2014 , van der Meijden et al. 2018 ). Many authors describe ipRGCs as irradiance detectors ( Dacey et al. 2005 ) due to their importance during photoentrainment (the setting of circadian rhythms), a concept that invites interrogation with an eye toward natural variation in irradiance (ambient light in the environment) across primate habitats.
The sun generates most of the light used during primate vision, but it is the modification of sunlight in terms of intensity and spectral composition that influences a given photic environment. For primates, the photic environment can vary minute to minute due to cloud cover and atmospheric turbidity, but these changes are relatively minor compared to the systematic variation that occurs over a 24-hour (diel) cycle. For example, the luminance of daylight is about a million times brighter than moonlight, which, in turn, is about 10,000 times brighter than overcast starlight. These extremes represent the total range of primate visual abilities—a span of approximately 10 billion photons/m 2 /sr 1 /s 1 ( Land & Nilsson 2002 ).
The sun is the greatest source of daylight. When solar elevation ( θ S ) exceeds 30°, there is little variation in the intensity of direct sunlight, although cloud cover can reduce it by as much as approximately 0.4 log units ( Figure 2 ). The typical range of light intensities experienced by diurnal primates is estimated at 500–4,000 lux, but these data are limited to feeding events and represent the approximations of human observers ( Dominy & Lucas 2004 , Yamashita et al. 2005 ). The surface temperature of the sun is about 6,000°C, and the color of direct sunlight is similar to that of an efficiently radiating surface, known as a blackbody. Sunlight is scattered by particles as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. These particles can vary in size from molecules to snowflakes, and it is this scattering that determines the radiance of the sky. The blue color (to the primate eye) of clear sky is the result of Rayleigh scattering, whereas the white and gray colors of misty, cloudy, or overcast sky are due to scattering from larger particles, such as water droplets, dust, and ice crystals.

The irradiance spectrum of direct sunlight is roughly flat, although it declines at wavelengths below 470 nm ( Figure 3 a ). It is described as whitish ( Endler 1993 ), and it has the same essential shape wherever it is measured ( Henderson 1977 , Lythgoe 1979 , Endler 1993 ). Clouds have little or no effect on the shape of this spectrum ( Endler 1993 , Regan et al. 2001 ), and it is the prevailing daytime illuminant for primates using the upper canopy, open grasslands, or large canopy gaps. Endler (1993) termed it open/cloudy, and many researchers have used variants of this illuminant to calculate the radiance spectra of plant tissues in primate habitats ( Regan et al. 1998 , Dominy & Lucas 2001 , Lucas et al. 2003 , Osorio et al. 2004 ). In forests, however, there is a striking vertical variation in the properties of light.

Middle-canopy daylight. The attenuation of downwelling light in rainforests is nonlinear, with the greatest rate of extinction occurring at depths between 5 and 20 m ( Anhuf & Rollenbeck 2001 , Fauset et al. 2017 ). The spectral composition of this light can change rapidly and significantly, progressing from open/cloudy light at the canopy surface to woodland shade conditions in the middle canopy ( Endler 1993 ) ( Figure 4 ). Woodland shade spectra are bluish or bluish-gray ( Figure 3 b ) because the light is shaded from direct sunlight but still dominated by blue-sky radiance. It is therefore extremely sensitive to the effects of cloud cover, which varies seasonally in most primate habitats. In the absence of clouds, woodland shade is rich in short (blue) wavelengths ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). If clouds are present and the sun is unobstructed, the blueness diminishes in proportion to cloud cover, trending toward a white spectrum in overcast conditions. Woodland shade is grayish if there are no clouds but the sky is filled with fog, haze, smoke, or air pollution. Woodland shade is particularly common in forests with a high treefall rate or human disturbance.

Understory daylight. The amount of visible light reaching the forest floor is typically 1–2% of that incident on the surface of the canopy ( Chazdon & Fetcher 1984 ) ( Figure 4 ), a difference in quantal irradiance of 4 log units ( Regan et al. 2001 ). The color of light in the forest understory is practically invariant across forest types, with a broad peak around 550 nm and a rapid increase above about 680 nm ( Pariente 1980 , Endler 1993 , Regan et al. 2001 ). This light is termed forest shade, and it appears greenish or yellow-green to the human eye ( Endler 1993 ) ( Figure 3 c ). It has this color because the light is filtered through or reflected by leaves, which are relatively rich in middle wavelengths, while absorbing shorter and longer wavelengths of light. By one estimate, it is the prevailing illuminant in forests at heights between 0 and 16 m or when canopy cover exceeds 95% ( Endler 1993 ).
When natural gaps exist in the canopy overstory, the size can vary from small (such as from branch falls or regenerated treefalls) to large (recent treefalls). This variation determines the intensity and spectral composition of downwelling light in gaps at every level of the subcanopy. The spectral composition of gap light, which includes sunflecks, differs from woodland shade or forest shade due to the geometry of encircling vegetation ( Endler 1993 ). When the canopy opening subtends a solid angle less than 2° (equivalent to a 1-m patch of sunlight on the forest floor), the prevailing light is dominated by solar radiance and is distinctly long wavelength–shifted relative to larger gaps and open/cloudy light conditions, so it tends to be yellowish-red rather than whitish ( Endler 1993 ).
The intensity of daylight changes systematically and most rapidly around twilight ( Figure 2 ), decreasing (at dusk) or increasing (at dawn) as a function of decreasing or increasing θ S ( Kern 1992 , Cronin et al. 2014 ) ( Figure 4 ). Twilight is classified into three phases according to θ S and prevailing visibility: ( a ) civil twilight (−6° < θ S < 0°), when terrestrial objects can still be distinguished by human observers; ( b ) nautical twilight (−12° < θ S < −6°), when only object outlines are visible; and ( c ) astronomical twilight (−18° < θ S < −12°), when the illumination level is low enough that stars and other astronomical objects are available for observation. This period of changing light intensity can be challenging for duplex retinas because it spans the transition from cone-mediated ( photopic ) vision to cone-and-rod-mediated ( mesopic ) vision to rod-mediated ( scotopic ) vision ( Zelle & Cao 2015 ). The process of dark adaptation is readily experienced as the Purkinje shift , the moment when our peak luminance sensitivity shifts perceptibly to shorter (bluer) wavelengths at approximately 0.1 cd/m 2 ( Figure 1 a ; also see the sidebar titled Thayer Blue).
THAYER BLUE
Abbott H. Thayer (1849–1921) was one of the finest figure painters of his era, recognized for his ethereal angels, portraits of women and children, landscapes, and delicate flower paintings. He is also remembered as the father of camouflage. An ardent naturalist, Thayer drew attention to the effects of light and background on the conspicuousness of animals. “Animals are painted by nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and vice versa ,” he wrote, in an article titled “The Law Which Underlies Protective Coloration” ( Thayer 1896 , p. 125). These ideas were later consolidated in a splendid magnum opus, Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom ( Thayer 1909 ), cowritten with his son Gerald ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). The central concept behind these works is now known as countershading—or Thayer's Law ( Behrens 2009 ).
Thayer is also immortalized as a color of paint, Thayer Blue (US Navy specification 52P47, formula 5-B), due to its effectiveness during wartime. Ships are conspicuous when viewed from submarines, a fact that motivated substantial military research during World War I and World War II. It is difficult to reduce the visibility of ships via countershading because the two dominant backgrounds—the sea and sky—are constantly changing in color and intensity. At high latitudes, however, long winter nights and overcast days offer some predictability to the light conditions (night and twilight) favored by enemy Unterseeboot (U-boat) commanders. The US Navy developed Thayer Blue (a pure light blue) for these conditions, and it was widely deployed on ships in North Atlantic and Aleutian waters in 1943 and early 1944. A special feature of Thayer Blue was its changeable character due to the Purkinje effect. Ships appeared white under low levels of illumination and were therefore difficult to see at night or twilight.

Changes in θ S affect the path length of direct sunlight in the Chappuis band of atmospheric ozone ( Hulburt 1953 , Fosbury et al. 2011 ), which attenuates and scatters green/yellow light (approximately 570–600 nm). This phenomenon is responsible for the vivid changes in the spectral composition (color) of twilight, such as the yellowish twilight arches of civil twilight and the purple and red sky of nautical twilight ( Lee 1994 , Lynch & Livingston 2001 , Lee & Hernández-Andrés 2003 ). In general, the short-wavelength (blue) content of ambient light (with a broad peak around 450 nm) increases steadily with decreasing θ S ( Johnsen et al. 2006 ; for twilight irradiance measures in primate habitats, see Pariente 1980 , Endler 1993 , Regan et al. 2001 , Melin et al. 2012 , Moritz et al. 2017 ) ( Figure 5 b ). This period is informally termed the blue hour in photography. When the sun is below the horizon ( θ S < 0°) and no longer directly illuminating Earth, the sky is lit in part by the refraction and scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere.

Palmer & Johnsen (2015) explored the effects of moonlight (described below) on the downwelling irradiance of twilight. They found that moonlight has little effect on either the brightness or the color of downwelling irradiance during civil twilight and early nautical twilight. Its contribution to the total illuminance increased steadily during twilight and peaked at the onset of night, when θ S = −12°.
The night is lit by multiple sources with different spectra, including a low-elevation sun or moon, high-elevation moon, starlight, airglow emissions, and scattered sun or moonlight ( Leinert et al. 1998 ). The intensities and spatial extents of these sources vary by orders of magnitude, so the spectral quality of light at night can change rapidly and significantly, particularly during the rising and setting of the sun or moon. The intensity of moonlight can vary over a range of 1.45 log units (28-fold). Much of this variation is due to elevation and phase. For example, the intensity of light from a rising full moon can increase from 0.016 cd/m 2 at 30° elevation to 0.042 cd/m 2 at 90° elevation ( Smith et al. 1994 ). At the same time, the surface of the moon varies in its reflectance , so that the irradiance of moonlight is not directly proportionate to phase. For example, a half-moon has one-tenth the downwelling irradiance of a full moon ( Lawrence et al. 2003 ), whereas a first-quarter (waxing) moon is 20% brighter than a third-quarter (waning) moon. The distance of the moon from Earth also varies during the lunar cycle, which affects light levels by about 26% ( Martin 1990 ). Variation in the intensity of moonlight on a given night and over ensuing nights is therefore much greater than one would expect based on the amount of surface area lit by the sun.
The intensity of moonlight can affect primate behavior ( Gursky 2003 , Erkert 2008 , Fernández-Duque et al. 2010 ), but the extent to which it supports primate color vision is a subject of debate. The moon is a radiating body with a temperature of about 400 K ( Johnsen 2012 ), but the great majority of lunar radiance is reflected sunlight. In fact, the reflectance of the moon is relatively flat, so the irradiance spectrum is nearly indistinguishable from a typical daylight spectrum, reflecting about twice as much red light (700 nm) as blue light (400 nm) ( Lynch & Livingstone 2001 ) ( Figure 5 c ). In understory conditions, the downwelling moonlight can resemble forest shade, with a broad peak around 560 nm ( Veilleux & Cummings 2012 ). Moonlight is about 500,000 times dimmer than sunlight, and convention holds that it is well below cone activation thresholds ( Kelber et al. 2017 ) ( Figure 1 b ). Yet outdoor experiments with human subjects have revealed the potential for modest color discrimination under full moonlight conditions ( Smith et al. 1994 ). This ability is most likely the result of dual processing by rod and LWS photoreceptors ( Zelle & Cao 2015 ). Thus, the spectral irradiance of moonlight, and exposure to this light source in the upper canopy, may hold some importance when discussing the evolution of primate visual systems ( Melin et al. 2012 , Veilleux et al. 2013 ).
Star- and moon-free night spectra are composed primarily of airglow (emission spectra of the various molecular components of the upper atmosphere) and zodiacal light (sunlight scattered from the dust in the plane of the solar system) ( Johnsen 2012 ). Airglow is relatively constant over the entire hemisphere, and zodiacal light is concentrated in a small region near the horizon, so the former is the primary contributor (approximately 80%) to the diffuse irradiance of a star-free night sky ( Lynch & Livingstone 2001 ). Stars contribute approximately 23–33% of the total irradiance, depending on the solar activity level (which affects the airglow intensity). In the absence of the moon, the irradiance spectrum is shifted to longer wavelengths and displays four prominent but narrow peaks (at 560, 590, 630, and 685 nm) ( Johnsen et al. 2006 ). In a region with large amounts of light pollution, a moonless night sky is substantially long-wavelength shifted, with a broad peak centered at 590 nm.
Setting aside indoor lighting and its effects on human biology (see the sidebar titled Firelight), another contributor to nocturnal illumination—light pollution—is artificial and globally variable. The intensity of light from direct emissions can vary dramatically depending on proximity to cities and cloud cover (because clouds reflect terrestrial lights); and light emitted or reflected upward can be scattered by water, dust, and gas molecules in the atmosphere, resulting in skyglow ( Gaston et al. 2014 ). Skyglow can be detected over a much wider area than direct artificial lighting can be, extending tens and perhaps hundreds of kilometers from the source ( Kyba et al. 2015 ). For many smaller mammals, greater illumination at night tends to reduce foraging behaviors, presumably because it increases the risk of predation ( Longcore & Rich 2004 ). It can also affect the photoentrainment of animals to moonlight ( Kronfeld-Schor et al. 2013 ). The orange color of light pollution [with a color temperature of approximately 2,700 K and a narrow wavelength band centered on 590 nm ( Johnsen 2012 )] stems from the many mercury-vapor lamps and low- and high-pressure sodium lights that illuminate streets, public spaces, and commercial and industrial real estate. It is distinct from any natural source of light and is particularly disruptive during nautical twilight, affecting the intensity and spectral composition of this important photoperiod ( Spitschan et al. 2016 ).
FIRELIGHT
Fire is a topic of enduring interest for anthropologists because it is viewed as a tool with many practical uses—termed pyrotechnology—most of which revolve around heat. Firelight is rarely viewed as a tool except for its ability to extend the day, providing another four hours of light for social interactions without compromising daytime foraging efficiency ( Gowlett 2010 , Dunbar & Gowlett 2014 ). Recently, Wiessner (2014) coupled this idea with data on the form of these interactions, linking firelight to storytelling and social cohesion among the Ju/’hoansi San. We call attention to these studies for two reasons. First, the emission spectrum of wood-burning firelight ( Figure 1 b ) would suggest that it is too dim to excite our SWS1 cones but sufficient to excite our rods and LWS cones. It is also too dim to excite melanopsin and suppress melatonin production, contrary to the arguments of Burton (2009) . Melatonin is the “hormone of darkness” ( Utiger 1992 , p. 1377) and is critical for regulating sleep cycles ( Brennan et al. 2007 ). Thus, a tremendous amount of recent research has focused on the negative health outcomes of melatonin inhibition due to artificial light exposure at night. Firelight, however, would appear optimal for facilitating storytelling and community building without the negative effects of disrupted sleep. Our second point concerns Wiessner's proposed mechanism for how firelight mediates empathy, bonding, and the transmission of cultural norms—it is because flickering firelight puts storytellers and listeners “on the same [psychological] wavelength” ( Wiessner 2014 , p. 14033). To put it differently, the periodic pulsation of firelight may elicit collective neural entrainment in a group of observers. It is a compelling and testable idea and a priority for future research.
Firelight is also implicated in the development of Upper Paleolithic parietal artwork. The firelight from fat-fueled stone lamps was dim, with a power of about 10 watts ( Delluc & Delluc 2009 ) or luminance of 0.002 cd/m 2 ( de Beaune 1987 ), equivalent to a large candle. In the total darkness of caves, the visible area around such light is about 4 m in diameter ( Pastoors & Weniger 2011 ), and it is natural to envision the darkness as opening up and closing in on oneself when moving forward: a liminal light in a liminal setting ( Pettitt 2016 , Pettitt et al. 2017 ). The color of naked flame ( Figure 1 b ) is expected to enhance the brightness of red pigments, which may partially explain why parietal art is red-shifted ( Pettitt 2016 ). It is also flickering, a feature that will produce dynamic shadows on the rocky relief. This property may explain why a small proportion (3.5%) of animals in French cave art are deconstructed (i.e., animals with multiple heads or limbs), which may stem from repeated painting or retouching or a wish to express movement under flickering light ( Azéma & Rivère 2012 , Azéma 2015 ).

Typical white LEDs emit considerably more light in the blue portion of the spectrum than conventional white lighting does ( Gaston et al. 2014 ). As these LEDs replace high‐pressure sodium outdoor lighting, blue emissions are expected to increase at night, and blue light is one of the most impacting wavelengths of the visible spectrum for terrestrial organisms, including primates. The effects of light pollution on the physiology and circadian rhythms of nonhuman primates are emerging as active areas of research ( LeTallec et al. 2013 , 2015 , 2016 ). At the other extreme, atmospheric pollution has produced dimmer night skies in areas buffered from light pollution, a phenomenon termed global dimming ( Wang et al. 2009 ). The effects of global dimming on forest illumination at night and the behavior of primates are essentially unexplored.
The number of photons incident on the cornea is always greater (by a factor of 2 to 10) than those available to photoreceptors in the retina. This loss of light occurs during transmission through ocular media (cornea, lens, and vitreous humor). The lenses of primates also filter wavelengths <400 nm ( Douglas & Jeffery 2014 ), which sets the lower limit to our visible spectrum (approximately 400–700 nm). These factors shape the properties of light available for transduction in the primate retina, which is equipped with two types of image-forming photoreceptors—cones and rods—as well as intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). The luminance range over which cones operate is approximately 0.03–10 8 cd/m 2 (candela per square meter, the photopic range), whereas the dynamic range of rods is much lower: approximately 10 −6 –10 cd/m 2 . Such a span includes the scotopic range, when cones are inactive, and the mesopic range, when rods and cones are both active (typically defined as luminance levels between 0.03 and 3 cd/m 2 ). Each receptor absorbs light according to its own spectral sensitivity and generates a measure of illuminance , which is ultimately combined via retinal wiring (including the ipRGCs themselves) to produce a weighted, integrated signal with downstream effects on primate physiology and behavior.
Cones are an ancient cell type that arose under diurnal conditions among early metazoans. Vertebrates possess ciliary-type cones, which are less sensitive than the microvillar photoreceptors of invertebrates but more energetically efficient ( Fain et al. 2010 ). The threshold for mammalian cone activation is relatively high; in humans, for example, activation requires about 200 photons ( Koenig & Hofer 2011 ) to initiate the phototransduction cascade from the cone cell to the synapsed horizontal and bipolar cells and onward through the optic nerve. Cones have high temporal and spatial resolution and are responsible for visual acuity and—when neighboring retinal cone cells are maximally sensitive to different wavelengths of light—color vision ( Bowmaker 1998 , Kefalov 2012 ). The spatial and color vision functions of cones are facilitated by relatively low signal summation (i.e., cone cells synapse with one or a few retinal neurons), resulting in high resolution ( Peichl 2005 ).
Primate cones contain a visual pigment, the cone opsin, that is covalently linked to 11- cis- retinal, a vitamin A–derived chromophore. Exchanging the amino acids of the cone opsins shifts the wavelengths of light to which the cone cell is maximally sensitive (λ max ), a tuning mechanism that has been shaped repeatedly during vertebrate evolution, including in primates, by the color and amount of ambient light in the environment ( Levine & MacNichol 1982 , Yokoyama 2002 , Hunt et al. 2009 , Kawamura & Melin 2018 ). When a single cone type is present, the λ max typically matches the most abundant wavelengths of light; however, when retinal cones express two or more opsins, the neural comparison of their response provides the basis for color vision. Four different classes of cone were present in the ancestral vertebrate: two shortwave-sensitive (SWS1, λ max 355–445 nm, and SWS2, λ max 400–470 nm), a middlewave-sensitive (MWS, λ max 480–530 nm), and a longwave-sensitive (LWS, λ max 500–570 nm) ( Peichl 2005 , Bowmaker 2008 ). Two of these opsins (SWS1 and LWS) remained functional in the ancestor of placental mammals following an extended phase of low-light activity, often referred to as the nocturnal bottleneck, enabling dichromatic color vision. Uniquely among mammals, many primates have added a third color channel and possess trichromatic color vision through duplication or allelic variation of the opsin gene coding for LWS pigments, OPN1LW ( Jacobs & Nathans 2009 ). Owing to the reclamation of additional sensitivity to middle wavelengths, these cones are termed LWS and MWS in primates, and their λ max spans 530–563 nm.
The evolution of rod photoreceptors dramatically expanded the dynamic range of the retina. With a derived photopigment, rhodopsin , rods are 100 times more sensitive than cones. Their evolution added the capacity for vision under scotopic conditions, augmenting the existing cones for fast photopic vision ( Fain et al. 2010 ) ( Figure 1 a ). A duplex retina was a major contributor to the adaptive radiation of vertebrates, including primates, and it has been maintained in a wide diversity of extant species, although the cone-to-rod ratio is highly variable and responsive to selective pressures ( Walls 1942 ). For example, rods represent 0–95% of retinal photoreceptors ( Peichl 2005 ) among diurnal mammals whose evolutionary roots include a prolonged nocturnal period ( Maor et al. 2017 ). Species with minority populations of rods include the ground squirrel, for which cones comprise 70% (periphery) to 95% (visual streak) of photoreceptors, and tree shrews (order Scandentia), for which cones comprise 86–99% of photoreceptors ( Müller & Peichl 1989 , Kryger et al. 1998 ). Among nocturnal mammals, a great majority (approximately 97%) of photoreceptors are rods, revealing their essential function in low-light photic environments ( Peichl 2005 ).

Rods can generate single- photon responses that propagate through the retina to produce visual images. This level of sensitivity is simply astounding, having attained the limit dictated by quantum physics ( Pugh 2018 ). It is also conserved in vertebrates despite considerable variation in rod morphology ( Morshedian & Fain 2017 ), including in primates ( Joffe et al. 2014 ), which is most likely related to rod recovery rates. Another source of variation lies with the spectral sensitivity (λ max ) of rhodopsin. Yokoyama et al. (2008) reported a wide range of λ max values among vertebrates (480–525 nm) and found that it was governed by amino acid replacements at 12 critical sites in the RH1 gene. In primates, there is some evidence for functional variation at these sites. For example, Zhao et al. (2009b) inferred λ max values ranging from 497 nm in Homo and Pan to 499 nm in Macaca spp. to 501 nm in Otolemur crassicaudatus . These values differ somewhat from those obtained via microspectrophotometry [ Homo : λ max = 498 nm ( Bowmaker & Dartnall 1980 ); Macaca : λ max = 500 nm ( Bowmaker et al. 1980 )] or physiological recordings [λ max = 491 nm for humans and macaques ( Schnapf et al. 1988 )], which would suggest that much of this variation is methodological. In any event, prereceptor filtering is expected to shift these values toward somewhat longer wavelengths (e.g., 507 nm in the standard human observer) ( Figure 1 a ). The amino acid positions in RH1 with the greatest effect on λ max (13, 225, and 346) are invariant across seven diurnal primate species and O. crassicaudatus ( Fernández-Sampedro et al. 2016 ), a nocturnal strepsirrhine with cone monochromatic vision. Taken together, the available evidence suggests little meaningful variation in the activation threshold and broad spectral sensitivity of rods in primate visual systems.
In a groundbreaking paper, Berson et al. (2002) found that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) express blue-sensitive (λ max ≈ 480 nm) melanopsin in the cellular membrane and are therefore photosensitive. The proportion of RGCs expressing melanopsin is small—accounting for about 2% of cells ( Hattar et al. 2002 )—but the pigment is widespread and spectrally invariant across chordates ( Lucas et al. 2014 ). The quantum efficiency of melanopsin is comparable to that of cone opsins and rhodopsin ( Do et al. 2008 ); however, ipRGCs lack specialized photopigment-concentrating organelles (such as rod/cone outer segments) to maximize the absorbance of light. The probability of photon capture is therefore over one million times lower than in rods or cones for a given area of photostimulation ( Do et al. 2008 ). The ipRGC phototransduction cascade has high amplification ( Do et al. 2008 ), but photoreception is much less sensitive than that of cones or rods. When the threshold for melanopsin activation is reached (at radiance levels equivalent to indoor lighting: approximately 214 cd/m 2 ) ( Allen et al. 2019 ), the response scales with stimulus intensity over several decimal orders ( Berson et al. 2002 ) and is remarkably persistent, being sustained over long durations of constant illumination ( Wong 2012 ).
Additionally, immunohistochemistry has revealed melanopsin-containing cones in the human peripheral retina ( Dkhissi-Benyahya et al. 2006 ). They are sparse (5–25 cones/mm 2 ), present only in the periphery (approximately 20° from the foveal area), and devoid of any other photopigment. Other researchers have found melanopsin labeling in mouse cones, but it is uncertain whether melanopsin-expressing cones produce a meaningful physiological signal.
The photosensitivity of ipRGCs has functional consequences that persist long after the discontinuation of light exposure ( Do et al. 2008 ). For example, recent findings suggest that RGCs directly mediate pupil constriction and behaviors such as vigilance and sleep, phenomena that also vary with the color of light ( Lucas et al. 2014 , van der Meijden et al. 2018 ). Many authors describe ipRGCs as irradiance detectors ( Dacey et al. 2005 ) due to their importance during photoentrainment (the setting of circadian rhythms), a concept that invites interrogation with an eye toward natural variation in irradiance (ambient light in the environment) across primate habitats.
The sun generates most of the light used during primate vision, but it is the modification of sunlight in terms of intensity and spectral composition that influences a given photic environment. For primates, the photic environment can vary minute to minute due to cloud cover and atmospheric turbidity, but these changes are relatively minor compared to the systematic variation that occurs over a 24-hour (diel) cycle. For example, the luminance of daylight is about a million times brighter than moonlight, which, in turn, is about 10,000 times brighter than overcast starlight. These extremes represent the total range of primate visual abilities—a span of approximately 10 billion photons/m 2 /sr 1 /s 1 ( Land & Nilsson 2002 ).
The sun is the greatest source of daylight. When solar elevation ( θ S ) exceeds 30°, there is little variation in the intensity of direct sunlight, although cloud cover can reduce it by as much as approximately 0.4 log units ( Figure 2 ). The typical range of light intensities experienced by diurnal primates is estimated at 500–4,000 lux, but these data are limited to feeding events and represent the approximations of human observers ( Dominy & Lucas 2004 , Yamashita et al. 2005 ). The surface temperature of the sun is about 6,000°C, and the color of direct sunlight is similar to that of an efficiently radiating surface, known as a blackbody. Sunlight is scattered by particles as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. These particles can vary in size from molecules to snowflakes, and it is this scattering that determines the radiance of the sky. The blue color (to the primate eye) of clear sky is the result of Rayleigh scattering, whereas the white and gray colors of misty, cloudy, or overcast sky are due to scattering from larger particles, such as water droplets, dust, and ice crystals.

The irradiance spectrum of direct sunlight is roughly flat, although it declines at wavelengths below 470 nm ( Figure 3 a ). It is described as whitish ( Endler 1993 ), and it has the same essential shape wherever it is measured ( Henderson 1977 , Lythgoe 1979 , Endler 1993 ). Clouds have little or no effect on the shape of this spectrum ( Endler 1993 , Regan et al. 2001 ), and it is the prevailing daytime illuminant for primates using the upper canopy, open grasslands, or large canopy gaps. Endler (1993) termed it open/cloudy, and many researchers have used variants of this illuminant to calculate the radiance spectra of plant tissues in primate habitats ( Regan et al. 1998 , Dominy & Lucas 2001 , Lucas et al. 2003 , Osorio et al. 2004 ). In forests, however, there is a striking vertical variation in the properties of light.

Middle-canopy daylight. The attenuation of downwelling light in rainforests is nonlinear, with the greatest rate of extinction occurring at depths between 5 and 20 m ( Anhuf & Rollenbeck 2001 , Fauset et al. 2017 ). The spectral composition of this light can change rapidly and significantly, progressing from open/cloudy light at the canopy surface to woodland shade conditions in the middle canopy ( Endler 1993 ) ( Figure 4 ). Woodland shade spectra are bluish or bluish-gray ( Figure 3 b ) because the light is shaded from direct sunlight but still dominated by blue-sky radiance. It is therefore extremely sensitive to the effects of cloud cover, which varies seasonally in most primate habitats. In the absence of clouds, woodland shade is rich in short (blue) wavelengths ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). If clouds are present and the sun is unobstructed, the blueness diminishes in proportion to cloud cover, trending toward a white spectrum in overcast conditions. Woodland shade is grayish if there are no clouds but the sky is filled with fog, haze, smoke, or air pollution. Woodland shade is particularly common in forests with a high treefall rate or human disturbance.

Understory daylight. The amount of visible light reaching the forest floor is typically 1–2% of that incident on the surface of the canopy ( Chazdon & Fetcher 1984 ) ( Figure 4 ), a difference in quantal irradiance of 4 log units ( Regan et al. 2001 ). The color of light in the forest understory is practically invariant across forest types, with a broad peak around 550 nm and a rapid increase above about 680 nm ( Pariente 1980 , Endler 1993 , Regan et al. 2001 ). This light is termed forest shade, and it appears greenish or yellow-green to the human eye ( Endler 1993 ) ( Figure 3 c ). It has this color because the light is filtered through or reflected by leaves, which are relatively rich in middle wavelengths, while absorbing shorter and longer wavelengths of light. By one estimate, it is the prevailing illuminant in forests at heights between 0 and 16 m or when canopy cover exceeds 95% ( Endler 1993 ).
When natural gaps exist in the canopy overstory, the size can vary from small (such as from branch falls or regenerated treefalls) to large (recent treefalls). This variation determines the intensity and spectral composition of downwelling light in gaps at every level of the subcanopy. The spectral composition of gap light, which includes sunflecks, differs from woodland shade or forest shade due to the geometry of encircling vegetation ( Endler 1993 ). When the canopy opening subtends a solid angle less than 2° (equivalent to a 1-m patch of sunlight on the forest floor), the prevailing light is dominated by solar radiance and is distinctly long wavelength–shifted relative to larger gaps and open/cloudy light conditions, so it tends to be yellowish-red rather than whitish ( Endler 1993 ).
The intensity of daylight changes systematically and most rapidly around twilight ( Figure 2 ), decreasing (at dusk) or increasing (at dawn) as a function of decreasing or increasing θ S ( Kern 1992 , Cronin et al. 2014 ) ( Figure 4 ). Twilight is classified into three phases according to θ S and prevailing visibility: ( a ) civil twilight (−6° < θ S < 0°), when terrestrial objects can still be distinguished by human observers; ( b ) nautical twilight (−12° < θ S < −6°), when only object outlines are visible; and ( c ) astronomical twilight (−18° < θ S < −12°), when the illumination level is low enough that stars and other astronomical objects are available for observation. This period of changing light intensity can be challenging for duplex retinas because it spans the transition from cone-mediated ( photopic ) vision to cone-and-rod-mediated ( mesopic ) vision to rod-mediated ( scotopic ) vision ( Zelle & Cao 2015 ). The process of dark adaptation is readily experienced as the Purkinje shift , the moment when our peak luminance sensitivity shifts perceptibly to shorter (bluer) wavelengths at approximately 0.1 cd/m 2 ( Figure 1 a ; also see the sidebar titled Thayer Blue).
THAYER BLUE
Abbott H. Thayer (1849–1921) was one of the finest figure painters of his era, recognized for his ethereal angels, portraits of women and children, landscapes, and delicate flower paintings. He is also remembered as the father of camouflage. An ardent naturalist, Thayer drew attention to the effects of light and background on the conspicuousness of animals. “Animals are painted by nature darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and vice versa ,” he wrote, in an article titled “The Law Which Underlies Protective Coloration” ( Thayer 1896 , p. 125). These ideas were later consolidated in a splendid magnum opus, Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom ( Thayer 1909 ), cowritten with his son Gerald ( Supplemental Figure 1 ). The central concept behind these works is now known as countershading—or Thayer's Law ( Behrens 2009 ).
Thayer is also immortalized as a color of paint, Thayer Blue (US Navy specification 52P47, formula 5-B), due to its effectiveness during wartime. Ships are conspicuous when viewed from submarines, a fact that motivated substantial military research during World War I and World War II. It is difficult to reduce the visibility of ships via countershading because the two dominant backgrounds—the sea and sky—are constantly changing in color and intensity. At high latitudes, however, long winter nights and overcast days offer some predictability to the light conditions (night and twilight) favored by enemy Unterseeboot (U-boat) commanders. The US Navy developed Thayer Blue (a pure light blue) for these conditions, and it was widely deployed on ships in North Atlantic and Aleutian waters in 1943 and early 1944. A special feature of Thayer Blue was its changeable character due to the Purkinje effect. Ships appeared white under low levels of illumination and were therefore difficult to see at night or twilight.

Changes in θ S affect the path length of direct sunlight in the Chappuis band of atmospheric ozone ( Hulburt 1953 , Fosbury et al. 2011 ), which attenuates and scatters green/yellow light (approximately 570–600 nm). This phenomenon is responsible for the vivid changes in the spectral composition (color) of twilight, such as the yellowish twilight arches of civil twilight and the purple and red sky of nautical twilight ( Lee 1994 , Lynch & Livingston 2001 , Lee & Hernández-Andrés 2003 ). In general, the short-wavelength (blue) content of ambient light (with a broad peak around 450 nm) increases steadily with decreasing θ S ( Johnsen et al. 2006 ; for twilight irradiance measures in primate habitats, see Pariente 1980 , Endler 1993 , Regan et al. 2001 , Melin et al. 2012 , Moritz et al. 2017 ) ( Figure 5 b ). This period is informally termed the blue hour in photography. When the sun is below the horizon ( θ S < 0°) and no longer directly illuminating Earth, the sky is lit in part by the refraction and scattering of sunlight in the upper atmosphere.

Palmer & Johnsen (2015) explored the effects of moonlight (described below) on the downwelling irradiance of twilight. They found that moonlight has little effect on either the brightness or the color of downwelling irradiance during civil twilight and early nautical twilight. Its contribution to the total illuminance increased steadily during twilight and peaked at the onset of night, when θ S = −12°.
The night is lit by multiple sources with different spectra, including a low-elevation sun or moon, high-elevation moon, starlight, airglow emissions, and scattered sun or moonlight ( Leinert et al. 1998 ). The intensities and spatial extents of these sources vary by orders of magnitude, so the spectral quality of light at night can change rapidly and significantly, particularly during the rising and setting of the sun or moon. The intensity of moonlight can vary over a range of 1.45 log units (28-fold). Much of this variation is due to elevation and phase. For example, the intensity of light from a rising full moon can increase from 0.016 cd/m 2 at 30° elevation to 0.042 cd/m 2 at 90° elevation ( Smith et al. 1994 ). At the same time, the surface of the moon varies in its reflectance , so that the irradiance of moonlight is not directly proportionate to phase. For example, a half-moon has one-tenth the downwelling irradiance of a full moon ( Lawrence et al. 2003 ), whereas a first-quarter (waxing) moon is 20% brighter than a third-quarter (waning) moon. The distance of the moon from Earth also varies during the lunar cycle, which affects light levels by about 26% ( Martin 1990 ). Variation in the intensity of moonlight on a given night and over ensuing nights is therefore much greater than one would expect based on the amount of surface area lit by the sun.
The intensity of moonlight can affect primate behavior ( Gursky 2003 , Erkert 2008 , Fernández-Duque et al. 2010 ), but the extent to which it supports primate color vision is a subject of debate. The moon is a radiating body with a temperature of about 400 K ( Johnsen 2012 ), but the great majority of lunar radiance is reflected sunlight. In fact, the reflectance of the moon is relatively flat, so the irradiance spectrum is nearly indistinguishable from a typical daylight spectrum, reflecting about twice as much red light (700 nm) as blue light (400 nm) ( Lynch & Livingstone 2001 ) ( Figure 5 c ). In understory conditions, the downwelling moonlight can resemble forest shade, with a broad peak around 560 nm ( Veilleux & Cummings 2012 ). Moonlight is about 500,000 times dimmer than sunlight, and convention holds that it is well below cone activation thresholds ( Kelber et al. 2017 ) ( Figure 1 b ). Yet outdoor experiments with human subjects have revealed the potential for modest color discrimination under full moonlight conditions ( Smith et al. 1994 ). This ability is most likely the result of dual processing by rod and LWS photoreceptors ( Zelle & Cao 2015 ). Thus, the spectral irradiance of moonlight, and exposure to this light source in the upper canopy, may hold some importance when discussing the evolution of primate visual systems ( Melin et al. 2012 , Veilleux et al. 2013 ).
Star- and moon-free night spectra are composed primarily of airglow (emission spectra of the various molecular components of the upper atmosphere) and zodiacal light (sunlight scattered from the dust in the plane of the solar system) ( Johnsen 2012 ). Airglow is relatively constant over the entire hemisphere, and zodiacal light is concentrated in a small region near the horizon, so the former is the primary contributor (approximately 80%) to the diffuse irradiance of a star-free night sky ( Lynch & Livingstone 2001 ). Stars contribute approximately 23–33% of the total irradiance, depending on the solar activity level (which affects the airglow intensity). In the absence of the moon, the irradiance spectrum is shifted to longer wavelengths and displays four prominent but narrow peaks (at 560, 590, 630, and 685 nm) ( Johnsen et al. 2006 ). In a region with large amounts of light pollution, a moonless night sky is substantially long-wavelength shifted, with a broad peak centered at 590 nm.
Setting aside indoor lighting and its effects on human biology (see the sidebar titled Firelight), another contributor to nocturnal illumination—light pollution—is artificial and globally variable. The intensity of light from direct emissions can vary dramatically depending on proximity to cities and cloud cover (because clouds reflect terrestrial lights); and light emitted or reflected upward can be scattered by water, dust, and gas molecules in the atmosphere, resulting in skyglow ( Gaston et al. 2014 ). Skyglow can be detected over a much wider area than direct artificial lighting can be, extending tens and perhaps hundreds of kilometers from the source ( Kyba et al. 2015 ). For many smaller mammals, greater illumination at night tends to reduce foraging behaviors, presumably because it increases the risk of predation ( Longcore & Rich 2004 ). It can also affect the photoentrainment of animals to moonlight ( Kronfeld-Schor et al. 2013 ). The orange color of light pollution [with a color temperature of approximately 2,700 K and a narrow wavelength band centered on 590 nm ( Johnsen 2012 )] stems from the many mercury-vapor lamps and low- and high-pressure sodium lights that illuminate streets, public spaces, and commercial and industrial real estate. It is distinct from any natural source of light and is particularly disruptive during nautical twilight, affecting the intensity and spectral composition of this important photoperiod ( Spitschan et al. 2016 ).
FIRELIGHT
Fire is a topic of enduring interest for anthropologists because it is viewed as a tool with many practical uses—termed pyrotechnology—most of which revolve around heat. Firelight is rarely viewed as a tool except for its ability to extend the day, providing another four hours of light for social interactions without compromising daytime foraging efficiency ( Gowlett 2010 , Dunbar & Gowlett 2014 ). Recently, Wiessner (2014) coupled this idea with data on the form of these interactions, linking firelight to storytelling and social cohesion among the Ju/’hoansi San. We call attention to these studies for two reasons. First, the emission spectrum of wood-burning firelight ( Figure 1 b ) would suggest that it is too dim to excite our SWS1 cones but sufficient to excite our rods and LWS cones. It is also too dim to excite melanopsin and suppress melatonin production, contrary to the arguments of Burton (2009) . Melatonin is the “hormone of darkness” ( Utiger 1992 , p. 1377) and is critical for regulating sleep cycles ( Brennan et al. 2007 ). Thus, a tremendous amount of recent research has focused on the negative health outcomes of melatonin inhibition due to artificial light exposure at night. Firelight, however, would appear optimal for facilitating storytelling and community building without the negative effects of disrupted sleep. Our second point concerns Wiessner's proposed mechanism for how firelight mediates empathy, bonding, and the transmission of cultural norms—it is because flickering firelight puts storytellers and listeners “on the same [psychological] wavelength” ( Wiessner 2014 , p. 14033). To put it differently, the periodic pulsation of firelight may elicit collective neural entrainment in a group of observers. It is a compelling and testable idea and a priority for future research.
Firelight is also implicated in the development of Upper Paleolithic parietal artwork. The firelight from fat-fueled stone lamps was dim, with a power of about 10 watts ( Delluc & Delluc 2009 ) or luminance of 0.002 cd/m 2 ( de Beaune 1987 ), equivalent to a large candle. In the total darkness of caves, the visible area around such light is about 4 m in diameter ( Pastoors & Weniger 2011 ), and it is natural to envision the darkness as opening up and closing in on oneself when moving forward: a liminal light in a liminal setting ( Pettitt 2016 , Pettitt et al. 2017 ). The color of naked flame ( Figure 1 b ) is expected to enhance the brightness of red pigments, which may partially explain why parietal art is red-shifted ( Pettitt 2016 ). It is also flickering, a feature that will produce dynamic shadows on the rocky relief. This property may explain why a small proportion (3.5%) of animals in French cave art are deconstructed (i.e., animals with multiple heads or limbs), which may stem from repeated painting or retouching or a wish to express movement under flickering light ( Azéma & Rivère 2012 , Azéma 2015 ).

Typical white LEDs emit considerably more light in the blue portion of the spectrum than conventional white lighting does ( Gaston et al. 2014 ). As these LEDs replace high‐pressure sodium outdoor lighting, blue emissions are expected to increase at night, and blue light is one of the most impacting wavelengths of the visible spectrum for terrestrial organisms, including primates. The effects of light pollution on the physiology and circadian rhythms of nonhuman primates are emerging as active areas of research ( LeTallec et al. 2013 , 2015 , 2016 ). At the other extreme, atmospheric pollution has produced dimmer night skies in areas buffered from light pollution, a phenomenon termed global dimming ( Wang et al. 2009 ). The effects of global dimming on forest illumination at night and the behavior of primates are essentially unexplored.

Section: LIMINAL LIGHT AND PRIMATE EVOLUTION

Preceding sections touched on the internalization and transformation of light in primate visual systems and the transmission and transformation of light in primate habitats. The articulation of these subjects draws attention to the great variation in natural illuminants that inform primate physiology and behavior. We also emphasize the transitional nature of light—its liminality—in time and space and the extent to which primates must navigate these changing conditions. In rainforests, for example, vertical movement exposes primates to rapidly changing illuminant conditions within seconds ( Figure 4 ). These changes can affect primate color discrimination ( Regan et al. 2001 , Osorio et al. 2004 ), but the primate visual system is generally quite facile and capable of adjusting quickly to changing light conditions. The exception is mesopic light. The refractory periods of cones and rods differ, and full dark adaptation can take 20–30 min (see the sidebar titled Liminal Light, Landscape of Fear).
Twilight exemplifies liminal light conditions. It spans the photopic-mesopic-scotopic continuum and does so quickly, with corresponding changes in color. Rapid changes in illuminant conditions are expected to tax the visual abilities of any animal, and it is telling that automobile accidents peak during civil twilight ( Leibowitz & Owens 1991 ). In marine biology, there is long-standing debate over whether predators exploit twilight conditions (the twilight hypothesis) ( Munz & McFarland 1973 ). This hypothesis has been echoed by others in the context of primate origins and evolution ( Melin et al. 2013 , 2016 ), a subject that typically draws sharp distinctions between nocturnality and diurnality ( Ankel-Simons & Rasmussen 2008 ).
Melin et al. (2016) estimated that the λ max of SWS1 cones shifted from ultraviolet to blue light (430 nm) at the base of Euarchonta about 90 million years ago. The implications of this spectral shift are twofold: First, it is accompanied by a signature of purifying selection, indicating selection for the retention of dichromatic vision; and second, it is associated with a shift toward greater visual acuity ( Douglas & Jeffery 2014 ). When coupled, these factors argue for primate origins under conditions that include cone-active (mesopic or photopic) light levels, and the evidence points to mesopic light conditions because early primates were small-bodied and dependent in part on invertebrate prey ( Gebo 2004 , Silcox & López-Torres 2017 ), which are less active under daylight. The fact that downwelling twilight in the forest understory can be green (civil twilight; see Figure 3 c ) or blue (nautical twilight; see Figure 5 b ) is important because it will preferentially excite the rod and cone photoreceptors that are sensitive to this spectral range and make chromatically cryptic food targets in this range appear brighter, particularly prey in the leaf litter ( Moritz et al. 2017 ).
LIMINAL LIGHT, LANDSCAPE OF FEAR
It is notable that some sit-and-wait avian predators perch in the midcanopy, a height that corresponds with large shifts in light conditions, both in intensity and in color ( Figure 4 ). Moving into and within this photic environment is expected to cause momentary shifts (e.g., periods of light and dark adaptation) in the primate visual system, increasing the vulnerability of some species to perched eagles. For example, the African crowned eagle ( Stephanoaetus coronatus ) is a large (3.8-kg) raptor with exceptionally strong hindlimbs and talons. It has been observed ambushing primates ( Shultz 2001 ) and is often cited as a major selective pressure on forest-dwelling monkeys. Tellingly, a plurality of eagle kills (46%) in the Taï Forest belong to the genus Cercopithecus ( McGraw et al. 2006 ), which occupies midcanopy heights [mean ± 1 SD: C. campbelli (8.4 ± 6.7 m), C. petaurista (13.3 ± 8.6 m), and C. diana (19.7 ± 9.3 m)] ( Fannin & McGraw 2020 ). In Kibale Forest, Uganda, the redtail monkey ( C. ascanius ) is overrepresented in an assemblage of eagle kills, making up 66% of monkeys identified to species ( Sanders et al. 2003 ). It is also found at heights between 6 and 15 m during much (62%) of the day ( Gebo & Chapman 1995 ). Taken together, these reports would suggest that S. coronatus exploits liminal light conditions in the middle canopy when hunting primates.

By way of illustration, it is useful to turn to the tarsier, an exemplary visual predator that is usually described as nocturnal. Yet sunset and civil twilight are important cues for initiating activity. Tarsiers exit their sleeping sites and initiate travel about 15 min before sunset or between 18:00 and 18:15 h (range: 17:45–19:10 h) ( Moritz et al. 2017 ). In Borneo, light levels at the onset of activity (mean: 6.8 lux; range: 1.4–15 lux) demonstrate synchronization with light conditions that support color vision. Nocturnal lemurs are also sensitive to prevailing illumination ( Pariente 1980 ), but mono- and dichromatic genera ( Phaner and Lepilemur , respectively) initiate their activities under much darker conditions ( Pariente 1974 ). The upshot of these limited data is that high visual acuity and visual predation are associated with greater levels of illumination, and that some nocturnal primates exploit twilight conditions more than others. It is misleading to categorize the activity patterns of primates as simply nocturnal or diurnal, and framing any discussion of primate origins and evolution around these two light conditions is likely to obscure some of the most important aspects of our evolutionary history.
The challenge of detecting items of ecological importance, be they food, conspecifics, or predators, under differing light conditions, including dawn, dusk, and night, is an enduring interest of anthropologists focused on the adaptive origins of primates or clades within the order (e.g., Sussman 1991 , Cartmill 1992 , Crompton 1995 , Martin & Ross 2005 , Heesy 2009 , Williams et al. 2010 ). This line of inquiry has spurred numerous research programs spanning molecular ecology, computational models of visual conspicuity, and behavioral ecology. To date, most of these studies have examined food items, although recent work has emerged on the perception of primate pelage and skin color, as well as predators ( Kamilar et al. 2013 , Pessoa et al. 2014 , Hiramatsu et al. 2017 , Moreira et al. 2019 ). A thorough synthesis of this large body of work on primate visual ecology would take many pages to address. Rather, we distill several advances in knowledge focusing on liminal light environments.
The persistence of two spectrally distinct cone opsin genes across vast stretches of evolutionary time, together with evidence of purifying selection maintaining opsin gene function among so-called nocturnal primate species, suggests natural selection favors a capacity for hue-based discrimination between objects and their backgrounds, at least under some conditions. Conversely, the loss of function in the short-wave opsin among other night-active species hints at variation in the selective pressures due to variation in timing of activity, diet, or phylogenetic constraint ( Zhao et al. 2009a , Carvalho et al. 2012 , Jacobs 2013 , Veilleux et al. 2013 , Melin et al. 2016 ). New insight into the visual ecology of nocturnal species has been generated by integrative study of viewing tasks modeled under varying nocturnal environments and in species-specific color spaces ( Melin et al. 2012 , Veilleux & Cummings 2012 ).
Taken together with data on visual systems, including retinal cone densities, spectral sensitivities, and estimates of neural noise, computational models estimating the visual contrast of targets in the color space of different species and habitats have generated many insights. We have learned that the appearance of food items shifts dramatically with receiver color vision types and from open to closed canopies during daylight, twilight, and moonlight ( Regan et al. 2001 ; Osorio et al. 2004 ; Yamashita et al. 2005 ; Melin et al. 2012 , 2014 ; Veilleux & Cummings 2012 ). This variation has important implications for selection acting on opsin genes. For example, the amount of light and the hues of food targets appear ample to generate noticeable color (chromatic) contrast under twilight and bright moonlight in open areas, but not under other nocturnal conditions, such as moonless nights under deep, thick canopies. This establishes the potential for adaptation to specific niches within and across diel cycles and habitats via color vision maintenance or loss, which could facilitate niche divergence across species. It is the heterogeneity of nocturnal environments, rather than nocturnality per se, that may explain why aye-ayes and some other lemurs retain an S opsin while dwarf lemurs, lorises, and others do not ( Tan et al. 2005 , Perry et al. 2007 , Veilleux et al. 2013 , Peichl et al. 2019 ).
Contra early thoughts around advantages due to seeing red in bright daylight as the evolutionary advantage of trichromacy, recent research suggests that long wavelength–medium wavelength contrast may be more useful to foraging primates under low-light conditions and for fruits that differ more subtly in hue from background leaves (e.g., brown and yellow fruits versus reddish fruits). This is because reddish hues are often darker in luminance , and thus visible in the absence of color vision, against leaves than are yellow and brown hues. Under bright light, the achromatic contrasts among targets and backgrounds are more salient, which might then favor trichromacy under low-light conditions ( Melin et al. 2013 ). Additionally, some lines of evidence suggest that color camouflage (i.e., preventing perception of shapes, movement, or achromatic differences between targets and backgrounds) is most effective under low light ( Morgan et al. 1992 ). If true, dichromats are predicted to have an advantage over trichromats for tasks involving breaking camouflage in dim environments. Studies of wild and captive primates foraging for cryptic invertebrates or experimentally altered food targets have supported this idea ( Melin et al. 2007 , Caine et al. 2010 ), but more work under low-light conditions is warranted.
Moving beyond visual ecology in the narrow sense, twilight has been described as a zeitgeber (time giver) for primates, aligning their circadian rhythms to the solar day. Kern (1992) argued for the steep rate of illuminance change as the primary cue for photoentrainment , but most recent attention has pivoted around melanopsin and the spectral composition of twilight ( Roenneberg & Foster 1997 , Walmsley et al. 2015 , Thiermann et al. 2018 ). What is clear from these studies is that transitional or liminal light conditions are important—they are both a problem for visual systems and a reliable cue for primate physiology and behavior—but field data on the physical properties of liminal light in primate habitats are scant. A thorough, creative, and thoughtful examination of these areas would seem a productive area for future research.

Section: ANTHROPOGENIC LIGHT DISRUPTION AND PRIMATE CONSERVATION

Discussions on primate conservation have (rightfully) focused on habitat loss and degradation, along with other major causes of declining primate biomass including disease and deforestation ( Estrada et al. 2018 ). Largely absent from these discussions, however, is an evaluation of the impact of light pollution, or the way that primate sensory ecology can inform conservation efforts ( Dominoni et al. 2020 ). Anthropogenic light sources are fundamentally changing the interactions between primates and their habitats by altering the visual environment ( LeTallec et al. 2015 ), an effect likely felt by nocturnal species around the world ( Longcore & Rich 2004 , Gaston et al. 2015 ). In species with rod-dense retinas, bright lights may be consistently blinding by light-saturating rhodopsin without room for recovery. In other cases, circadian rhythms and timing of reproduction may be disrupted, or the risk of predation by visually oriented aerial or feline predators capitalizing on high ambient light may be increased substantially ( LeTallec et al. 2015 ). What is more, these effects likely occur in concert, differentially placing scotopic -niche specialists at risk. We suggest that risk assessments may benefit from including the impact of visual environment, in addition to other aspects of disturbance and pollution, to best inform conservation decisions about primates in peril.
