Title: Socio-Ecological Challenges as Modulators of Women's Reproductive Trajectories


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

Amenorrhea, anovulatory cycles, miscarriages, and other reproductive outcomes are often seen as pathological. Life history theory, in contrast, treats those outcomes as adaptations that helped women optimize the timing of reproductive ventures across our evolutionary history. Women's bodies adjust their reproductive strategies in response to socio-ecological conditions, a process mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). Here, we review the links between socio-ecological conditions, HPAA activity, and the pace of women's reproductive transitions such as puberty, age at first birth, interbirth interval, and perimenopause. We also discuss the HPAA's role as a modulator of reproductive function: It not only suppresses it but may also prime women's bodies for future reproductive ventures. We conclude by reviewing challenges and opportunities within our subfield, including the need for transdisciplinary teams to develop longitudinal studies to improve our understanding of women's reproductive trajectories and outcomes from the moment they are conceived.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Two decades ago, the New England Journal of Medicine published “Implantation and the Survival of Early Pregnancy,” a review that begins, “Human reproduction entails a fundamental paradox: although it is critical to the survival of the species, the process is relatively inefficient” ( Norwitz et al. 2001 , p. 1400). Poignantly, the article was included in a “Mechanisms of Disease” section.
From a clinical perspective, women's reproductive function may appear “inefficient.” To wit, compared to most other mammalian females, women's reproductive maturation is delayed. Their transition from the pre-reproductive to the reproductive stage is comparatively slow, and, after menarche, young women go through a long, sub-fecund stage in which they experience amenorrheic periods, anovulatory cycles, luteal deficiencies, implantation failures, and miscarriages ( Ashley-Montagu 1946 , Hartman 1931 ). Indeed, approximately 5% of ovarian cycles from sexually active women not using contraception are estimated to be anovulatory, only 36% result in implantation, and less than 25% result in a live birth ( Baird & Strassmann 2000 ). Women finish their reproductive life (menopause) decades before the end of their biological life, which is also a rare phenomenon among mammals ( Brent et al. 2015 , Croft et al. 2017 , Foote 2008 , Lahdenpera et al. 2014 , Nattrass et al. 2019 ).
Despite these apparent reproductive inefficiencies, Homo sapiens’ demographic growth has been sustained over its evolutionary history ( Bongaarts 2009 , Lutz & Qiang 2002 ). Clearly, social and technological innovations linked to agricultural advances resulting in increases in food security and reductions in mortality and social systems that provide high levels of allomaternal care may have helped ( Antón & Snodgrass 2012 , Hrdy 2009 , Kuzawa & Bragg 2012 ). Yet human demographic growth precedes many of these innovations. What other factors could, then, explain human demographic growth in spite of women's high frequencies of amenorrhea, anovulatory cycles, and miscarriages?
Key to solving this putative paradox ( Norwitz et al. 2001 ), the field of women's reproductive ecology has produced an alternative theoretical framework. Indeed, within this field, many of those so-called inefficiencies are hypothesized to be evolved biological and behavioral mechanisms that regulate the timing of reproductive ventures, rather than the reflection of a reproductive system that is “broken by design.” These mechanisms are present in most vertebrates and tend to be activated when conditions become inauspicious for the production of new offspring. Here, we argue that mechanisms that regulate the timing of reproductive events are particularly important for species such as Homo sapiens . While most other mammalian females ovulate seasonally or opportunistically, women's ovulatory cycles succeed each other continuously, one after the other, creating approximately 12 opportunities per year to conceive. Thus, mechanisms that regulate which of these ovulatory events results in a live birth are critical.
Importantly, humans are cooperative breeders. Not only do mothers need to be able to invest in each of their offspring, at least until they reach reproductive maturity ( Gurven & Walker 2006 ), but they also depend on a vast, reliable social support network committed to providing critical material resources, protection, and training for their children across the same period ( Antón & Snodgrass 2012 , Hrdy 2009 , Kuzawa & Bragg 2012 ). Thus, mechanisms that optimize the timing of reproductive events according to availability and fluctuations in all these resources (hereafter referred to as “challenges”) are paramount to the maximization of women's reproductive success. These mechanisms, together with a unique combination of behavioral, social, dietary, and physiological traits, allowed for the evolution of an unusual reproductive strategy for a primate: simultaneous high fertility rates and offspring survival.
Stress is one of the best-studied modulators of reproductive function. Physiologically, the stress response is broadly defined as the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA). HPAA activation, marked by departures from normative cortisol profiles, allows individuals to respond and adapt to internal and external demands resulting from physical, energetic, health, and social challenges ( McEwen 2004 , Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 , Provencal & Binder 2015 ). This response is achieved through the reallocation of metabolic energy from postponable tasks to those required to overcome pressing challenges. Briefly, HPAA activation involves an increase in the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which, in turn, promotes the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulates the secretion of glucocorticoids, including cortisol, by the adrenal cortex, which triggers gluconeogenesis ( Oh et al. 2013 ). Increases in circulating glucose fuel the tissues involved in responding to challenges ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 ). This physiological response can vary broadly, as it changes depending on the predictability of the challenge; its type, frequency, and intensity; the developmental stage of the individual when the challenge takes place; and each individual's history with that particular challenge.
HPAA basal function and activation are frequently quantified using cortisol ( Altemus et al. 2001 , Joseph & Whirledge 2017 , McEwen & Wingfield 2010 ). Cortisol can be measured in a relatively noninvasive manner in a variety of matrices (e.g., urine, saliva, hair), facilitating its use in longitudinal studies. Importantly, stress response involves pathways beyond changes in cortisol levels, including variation in cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), insulin, adiponectin, oxytocin, cytokine, and catecholamine levels as well as heart rate ( Breuner & Orchinik 2002 , Hammond 2016 ). Additionally, changes in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor numbers and their distribution across tissues can also modulate the stress response ( Colli et al. 2007 , Joëls et al. 2008 ).
Life history trajectories are determined by the pace of growth, development, and reproductive maturation; timing of ovulation, conception, and first reproduction; birth frequencies; litter size; reproductive effort; duration of the reproductive lifespan; and overall survival. The HPAA modulates the timing of these events through its role as a metabolic energy modulator ( Ellison 2017 , Levins 1968 , Sibly & Calow 1986 ). By regulating energy flow, storage, and expenditure, the HPAA can accelerate or delay development and reproduction ( Ellison 2017 , Levins 1968 , McEwen & Wingfield 2010 , Romero et al. 2009 , Sibly & Calow 1986 ).
Challenges can be predictable or unpredictable. Life history transitions such as menarche, gestation, or menopause constitute predictable challenges because going through them can be trying, as they impose psychosocial and energetic demands on individuals. Similarly, seasonal changes in biomass productivity or physical activity budgets (e.g., planting and harvest seasons in agropastoralist societies) are also considered predictable challenges. Unpredictable challenges, by contrast, are chance events such as natural catastrophes (e.g., droughts, floods, earthquakes), predation attempts, social violence, and infections. A third type of challenge cannot be easily accommodated in the two previous categories: the perception of future risks. For example, the death of a member of an individual's social support network may signal the future risk of a decrease in social status, losing access to housing or nutrition, or an increase in social harassment or even violence. Solving future risk challenges could require an energetic investment in the present or the future but may also involve other activities that are not directly related to energy, such as rebuilding one's social network. Responding to all predictable and unpredictable challenges as well as future risks triggers HPAA activation.
Predictable challenges are often preceded by increases in basal cortisol and, consequently, circulating glucose, which prepare the individual to face future challenges. Unexpected challenges are met with rapid cortisol increases, quickly followed by sharp increases in circulating glucose levels. Risks, however, trigger different HPAA responses depending on their nature and expected timing. There can be an initial activation to increase energy availability to boost cognitive function or muscle activity, followed by a dampening of HPAA basal activity to promote energy storage in preparation for meeting the future challenge. All these responses are influenced by a variety of factors besides those linked to the challenges being currently faced. Those factors include the individual's reproductive status and prospects of future reproduction; the amount of accumulated (chronic) stress; her energetic status at the time; her access to energetic, material, and social resources; and the overall predictability of future resources and other challenges. No current model exists that fully incorporates all these covariates. Furthermore, the neurological pathways linking risk perception by challenge type, intensity, and the mounting of appropriate responses are yet to be investigated.
The HPAA and the reproductive axis [hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA)] are intimately interconnected. This is logical given the costs and risks involved in mammalian reproduction, including internal gestation and changes in metabolic, circulatory, and immune function ( Bonney 2016 , Herrera 2002 , Thiele et al. 2018 ); increased predation risk ( Creel et al. 2009 ); and, for women, elevated parturition-related mortality risks resulting from delivery complications, bleeding, eclampsia, and infections, among others ( Hirshberg & Srinivas 2017 , Leonard et al. 2019 , Mascarello et al. 2017 ). Thus, costs and risks have affected women's survival and reproduction throughout human history, leading to the evolution of physiological mechanisms that adjust reproductive development and trajectories ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 ).
Currently, there is no comprehensive, longitudinal model that explains how HPAA-HPGA interactions change across women's lifespans. This is partly because long-term longitudinal studies are logistically difficult and costly. Consequently, our understanding of these interactions is based primarily on cross-sectional studies focused on discrete reproductive stages (e.g., menarche, ovarian cyclicity during reproductive maturity, gestation, or perimenopause) ( Kajantie 2008 , Ntusi & Mayosi 2009 , Poser 1984 , Treadway et al. 1969 ). Most of those studies have focused on the HPAA's suppression of the HPGA ( Joseph & Whirledge 2017 ; Kalantaridou et al. 2004 , 2010 ; Toufexis et al. 2014 ; Whirledge & Cidlowski 2010 ). Yet HPAA activation can have other effects depending on females’ age, reproductive history and status, energetic and immune conditions, and a variety of socio-ecological factors ( Bonier et al. 2009a , b ; Breuner et al. 2008 ). This complexity is illustrated by the “brood value hypothesis,” in which a mother's reaction to a threat faced by her and her offspring should be determined by her age, her status, and the value of her current offspring vis-à-vis future offspring. This hypothesis has been tested in birds and small mammals by evaluating maternal HPAA reactivity to an acute stressor such as predator presence. Studies conducted in birds have shown an inverse relationship: The higher the value of current offspring, the weaker the HPAA response ( Bokony et al. 2009 ) and the lower the chances of nest desertion, which, in turn, leads to higher chances of current offspring survival ( Schultner et al. 2013 ). When the current offspring's value is lower than that of future offspring, stronger HPAA responses increase maternal survival at the expense of the survival of current offspring ( Crespi et al. 2013 ). This example demonstrates the importance of assessing the ultimate consequences of HPAA activity when developing testable predictions. Current versus future reproduction trade-offs are critical determinants of reproductive trajectories and function.

Section: THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS AND WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE TRAJECTORIES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN

The relationship between the HPAA and life history trajectories is evolutionarily primitive (ancestral) ( Crespi et al. 2013 ; Denver 2009a , b ). Indeed, changes in HPAA activity modulate critical life history milestones in most vertebrates, including amphibian metamorphosis, avian hatching, and mammalian births ( Crespi & Denver 2005 , Crespi et al. 2013 , Glennemeier & Denver 2002 , Wada et al. 2006 , Weiss et al. 2007 ).
In humans, the HPAA-HPGA interplay during reproductive maturation is still under investigation. Nonetheless, it is already clear that the HPAA's basal activity increases during the puberty-adolescent transition ( Adam 2006 , Gunnar et al. 2009 ) and that those changes affect gonadal maturation and, subsequently, reproductive hormone levels, the emergence of secondary sexual traits, and behavior ( Hoyt & Falconi 2015 ). Girls also become more sensitive to socio-ecological challenges ( Gunnar et al. 2009 ). This sensitivity appears to be the result of HPGA effects on the HPAA. Estrogen, for example, can both affect the way HPAA reacts and be inhibited by repeated or chronic HPAA activation ( Kirkpatrick et al. 1998 , Toufexis et al. 2014 ).
Age at menarche varies broadly among urban, rural, hunter-gatherer, and pastoralist populations, ranging from a mean age of 9 to 17 ( Broekmans et al. 2009 , Cabrera et al. 2014 , Hillard 2008 , Low et al. 2008 ). A significant proportion (44–72%) of the observed variation is heritable ( Anderson et al. 2007 , Towne et al. 2005 , van den Berg & Boomsma 2007 ). The remainder of this variation appears to be a response to the three key environmental variables mentioned above: risk, predictability, and energy availability ( Stearns 1992 ). The modification of developmental trajectories in response to environmental cues early during development, starting in utero, has been argued to be an evolved response that allows individuals to adjust their phenotype to expected postnatal conditions ( Coall et al. 2016 , Gluckman et al. 2005 , Hales & Barker 2001 , Worthman et al. 2019 ).
The transition from childhood to adulthood involves rapid physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics as well as other physiological and psychological changes ( Blakemore et al. 2010 ). During this time, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulses stimulate the anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) ( Ellison et al. 2012 ). Concurrently, growth hormone begins to increase, promoting insulin resistance in adipose tissue, leading to transient hyperinsulinemia that stimulates somatic growth. FSH and LH stimulate the secretion of gonadal steroids (estrogen and progesterone), which stimulate the development of secondary sexual traits. When gonadal steroids reach mature levels, hyperinsulinemia is resolved, and fat deposition is resumed. These hormonal regulators act like interlocking gears, so that changes in one component drive changes in the system as a whole ( Ellison 2017 ).
In industrialized countries, age at menarche has been declining at a rate of 3–4 months per decade ( Ong et al. 2006 , Papadimitriou 2016 ). This secular trend has been attributed to dietary improvements and reductions in physical activity leading to accelerated somatic growth ( Papadimitriou 2016 ). Yet, importantly, the relationship between metabolic energy and age at menarche does not appear to be straightforward. Indeed, contrary to this hypothesis, nutritional restriction in utero also appears to be linked to early menarche. Studies using birth weight as a marker of intrauterine environment quality report that girls with lower birth weights are more likely to experience catch-up growth and earlier menarche ( Sloboda et al. 2007 ). The effects of catch-up growth on girls exposed to undernutrition in utero are illustrated by the results of nutritional interventions aimed at supporting marginalized women in Guatemala ( Ramakrishnan et al. 1999 ) and the adoption of stunted Indian girls by Swedish families ( Proos 2009 ; Proos et al. 1991 , 1993 ). In both cases, girls whose energetic, material, and social conditions improved in comparison to those faced by their mothers during gestation showed clear evidence of catch-up growth. They also initiated reproductive maturation and reached menarche earlier than girls that did not receive the intervention or remained in their country of origin. The observed links between catch-up growth and the timing of reproductive maturation have led to several evolutionary hypotheses attempting to explain their functional origin ( Stearns 1992 ). Prevailing hypotheses are based on the putative advantages these traits may provide in unpredictable and risky environments. To review them, we first need to discuss the role of the HPAA.
In most vertebrates, HPAA activation is equated with physiological stress caused by exogenous factors. Nonetheless, particular life history transitions involve changes in activity in this axis that result from the internal processes that accompany these transitions ( Romero 2002 ). Thus, to appropriately monitor physiological stress levels, we first need to describe and understand life history stage–specific HPAA activity profiles. Reproductive maturation, for example, appears to be accompanied by an increase in basal glucocorticoid levels ( Gunnar et al. 2009 , Legro et al. 2003 , Shirtcliff et al. 2012 ), which mediates the reallocation of metabolic energy from growth to reproductive development and, subsequently, reproductive function. Importantly, individuals approaching reproductive maturation who present increases in HPAA activity above those normative stage-specific profiles appear to be more likely to experience a delay in the timing of their pubertal growth spurt and age at menarche ( Goos & Consten 2002 , Shi et al. 2011 ).
Across species, predictable, low-risk environments (low morbidity and mortality) tend to result in slow life histories. In contrast, unpredictable or risky environments tend to result in faster life histories and opportunistic strategies ( Roff 1992 , Stearns 1992 ). Adjusting life histories to environmental predictability and risk has been argued to ( a ) in low-risk environments, allow individuals to grow slowly, thus achieving an optimal size and resources before reproducing, and ( b ) in high-risk environments, accelerate the pace of maturation, increasing individuals’ chances of reproducing before dying ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Crespi et al. 2013 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Hutchings 1993 , Nettle 2014 , Promislow & Harvey 1990 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). Homo sapiens enjoy more predictable and lower-risk environments than most other mammalian species and, as expected, present a comparatively slow life history ( Antón & Snodgrass 2012 , Hrdy 2009 , Kuzawa & Bragg 2012 ).
Importantly, beyond cross-species analyses, life history principles have also been used to explain within-species variation. Indeed, the rapid catch-up growth and fast development observed among the daughters of marginalized Guatemalan and Indian women described above ( Proos 2009 ; Proos et al. 1991 , 1993 ; Ramakrishnan et al. 1999 ) could be interpreted within this theoretical framework. Their mothers’ experiences in terms of resource availability and reliability, as well as morbidity and mortality, are likely to have affected maternal HPAA activity during gestation and, thus, fetal development ( Barha et al. 2019 ). The catch-up growth and early reproductive maturation observed in these girls could be interpreted as part of an opportunistic strategy aimed at taking advantage of resources present in their new environments, which are very different from those in which they were conceived, gestated, and born ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). In contrast, young elite female athletes subjected to energetic stress experience functional hypothalamic hypogonadism, late menarche, and delays in the development of secondary sexual traits ( Kapczuk 2017 ). Within this theoretical framework, maturational delay experienced by the athletes could be interpreted as a response to the stringent energy balance they experience in the context of a predictable, lower-risk environment, which allows them to complete their somatic development, thereby helping them to optimize reproductive outputs ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ).
The role of risk and predictability has been highlighted by numerous studies. These studies argued that individuals facing elevated mortality rates ( Gaudineau et al. 2010 , Jacobsen et al. 2007 ), the absence of the biological father, or the presence of genetically unrelated men ( Moffitt et al. 1992 , Sear et al. 2019 , Webster et al. 2014 ), as well as other social or physical challenges, such as loss of social support ( Belsky 2012 , Chisholm et al. 2005 ), develop faster and experience early menarche. Yet these results contradict those of other studies. For example, a recent meta-analysis reports the opposite of what life history theory predicts, showing that in countries with high overall mortality, menarche occurs later ( Ellis 2004 , Saffa et al. 2019 ). Nonetheless, it is important to note that most studies investigating the effects of ecological factors on timing of women's reproductive maturation have reported rather small effects, ranging from two to nine months in age at menarche ( Awal et al. 1995 , Karapanou & Papadimitriou 2010 , Mendle et al. 2006 ). Future studies should investigate whether those small effects are biologically meaningful in terms of women's lifetime reproductive success.
In humans, menarche is frequently followed by a period of subfecundity, characterized by ovarian irregularities including anovulatory cycles, luteal deficiencies, and intermittent amenorrhea ( Ellison 2017 ). The length of this period varies widely among individuals, lasting until the late teens in some cases and well into the twenties in others ( Ellison 1996 , Lipson & Ellison 1992 ). As with menarche, risky and unpredictable environments may result in an acceleration of this transition, which is hypothesized to increase the probability of reproducing before dying ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). Consistent with this hypothesis, age at menarche and at first birth are correlated in several populations ( Chisholm et al. 2005 , Coall et al. 2016 , Nettle et al. 2011 ).
Trade-offs between current and future reproduction are important for females of all species but particularly for human females (women from this point forward). Unlike most other mammalian females, women ovulate approximately every 29 days throughout the year ( Bull 2019 ). This trait lowers the opportunity cost of foregoing a single ovulatory event in women relative to other mammalian females, many of which are seasonal or opportunistic breeders that ovulate very infrequently. Southern elephant seals ( Mirounga leonina ), which ovulate only once a year, provide an example of a strict seasonal breeder with an extremely concentrated period of maternal investment. As expected, most of these single, annual ovulatory events in M. leonina result in a live birth ( Le Boeuf et al. 2019 ). In contrast, among sexually active women who do not use contraception, less than 25% of menstrual cycles result in a live birth ( Baird & Strassmann 2000 ). These differences in the ratio of live births to ovarian cycles between women and females of species that do not ovulate continuously could be linked to women's high sensitivity to environmental challenges. Consistent with this hypothesis, HPAA activation resulting from energetic, psychosocial, and immune challenges has been shown to affect ovarian function, conception, pregnancy maintenance, birth outcomes, and the resumption of ovarian function postpartum ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , 2015 ).
In eumenorrheic women, HPAA activation has been associated with reduced sensitivity to and altered secretion of GnRH, leading to decreases in gonadotropin (FSH and LH) secretion ( Charmandari et al. 2004 , Chrousos et al. 1998 ). Reduced FSH and LH levels can affect follicle maturation and ovulation and lead to luteal insufficiencies, reducing the chances of successful implantations and pregnancies ( Ferin 1999 , Nakamura et al. 2008 , Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 ). HPAA activity can change as a result of a number of challenges, including energetic ones, increasing the risks for hypothalamic amenorrhea, anovulation, hypoestrogenism, luteal deficiencies, and infertility ( Ellison & Lager 1986 , Meczekalski et al. 2014 ). Results from our long-term Society, Environment and Reproduction (SER) cohort study among Mayan women from an agropastoralist community in Guatemala are consistent with those observations. Cycling women showed a positive association between increased cortisol and adrenal progesterone during the follicular phase, which has been linked to decreased fecundability ( Baird & Strassmann 2000 , Baird et al. 1999 , Nepomnaschy et al. 2004 ). Elevated cortisol levels were also associated with reductions in midluteal progesterone, providing a pathway linking stress response to luteal insufficiencies and degenerative endometrium ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2004 ), both of which can negatively affect the implantation process ( Palomba et al. 2015 , Strowitzki et al. 2006 ).
Despite not being seasonal breeders, women's ovarian function has been observed to vary across the year in populations that depend on biomass productivity to meet their energetic demands ( Pierre et al. 2018 ). Seasonal variation in physical activity has also been linked to changes in ovarian function ( Crespi et al. 2013 ; Jasienska & Ellison 1998 , 2004 ). Together, energy availability and expenditure have been hypothesized to explain seasonal variation in birth frequencies ( Bronson 1995 ).
Our team uncovered an important preparative role for HPAA in terms of conception and implantation. A within-women analysis of ovarian cycles from participants in our SER study showed that conceptive cycles were preceded by cortisol increases not observed in non-conceptive cycles ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2015 ). We propose that these apparently normative preconception increases in basal HPAA activity could play an important role in women's preparation to invest in the upcoming conception and gestation. Importantly, in conceptive cycles, cortisol continues to increase, which may mediate the allocation of metabolic energy to the maintenance of a new pregnancy ( Jung et al. 2011 ). However, as discussed above, unexpected pre-ovulatory elevations in cortisol and other stress markers, such as salivary alpha-amylase, beyond the aforementioned normative increases are linked with lower chances of ovulation, conception, and implantation ( Buck Louis et al. 2011 ; Lynch et al. 2014 ; Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 , 2015 ; Rivier & Rivest 1991 ).
Socio-ecological challenges during pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss. A recent meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant positive association between self-reported stressful life events before and during pregnancy and the risk of miscarriage ( Qu et al. 2017 ). Yet, representative of the existing literature, most studies included in this meta-analysis were retrospective, a design known to be susceptible to recall biases. Nonetheless, the results of our own long-term, prospective, SER cohort study among Mayan women in Guatemala are consistent with those based on self-reports. We found that women who experienced cortisol increases during the first three weeks after conception were 2.7 times more likely to experience a miscarriage ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2006 ). Also consistent with our results, in vitro studies have offered a potential mechanism. Smith and colleagues (2017) , for example, showed that cortisol administration to placental precursor cells inhibits signaling molecules critical for placental development, decreasing initial placental invasion.
Pregnancy involves important trade-offs for mothers. On the one hand, gestation imposes extra energetic demands to meet the requirements of the developing fetus. On the other hand, mothers need to store energy in preparation for nursing and child care postpartum ( Piers et al. 1995 ). This trade-off is also regulated by changes in HPAA activity. During the second and third trimesters, placental CRH secretion stimulates the production of ACTH and cortisol ( Petraglia et al. 1993 ), which feed back onto the placenta to secrete more CRH ( Robinson et al. 1988 ). This positive feedback loop explains late-gestation's maternal hypercortisolemia ( Jung et al. 2011 , Mastorakos & Ilias 2003 ). Cortisol increases may also be partially explained by gestational estrogen, which stimulates the production of CBG, increasing cortisol's half-life ( Nenke et al. 2017 ). Importantly, in contrast to its stimulatory effect on placental CRH production, elevated late-gestation cortisol downregulates hypothalamic CRH production, attenuating HPAA reactivity to psychosocial and physiological stressors ( de Weerth & Buitelaar 2005 ). This suppression of HPAA reactivity is proposed to protect the fetus from the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure during late gestation ( Kajantie & Phillips 2006 ). This protective mechanism, however, appears to be limited. Extremely poor intrauterine conditions may result in preterm birth, it being the “lesser of two evils.” Indeed, stressful life events, perceived stress, and pregnancy-related anxiety have all been linked to increased risk of preterm birth (i.e., delivery at <37 weeks of gestation) ( Shapiro et al. 2013 ). This is not surprising given that, mechanistically, placental CRH plays an important role in regulating gestational length. CRH increases steeply immediately prior to birth, promoting uterine contractions directly through placental receptors and indirectly through fetal adrenal receptors, which stimulate dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) production ( Stevens et al. 1998 ). DHEAS, aromatized to estrogen in the placenta, promotes myometrium contractions ( Romero et al. 1988 ). Maternal ACTH and cortisol also increase during labor, then decline within four days postpartum ( Mastorakos & Ilias 2003 ). This decline is proposed to limit the transfer of cortisol into breast milk, which has been associated with subsequent fear behavior in two-month old infants ( Glynn et al. 2007 ).
In vertebrate species with maternal care, HPAA activity changes during postpartum, mediating a delicate balance between the mother's survival and maternal investment in offspring survival and growth. This balance is achieved by increasing maternal basal HPAA activity but downregulating HPAA reactivity to a variety of immunological, energetic, and psychosocial challenges, maximizing investment in lactation and offspring care ( Lightmann et al. 2001 , Tu et al. 2006 , Walker et al. 2004 ). Suckling, in particular, seems to exert anxiolytic effects on mothers ( Tu et al. 2005 , Uvnäs-Moberg 1998 ). Nonetheless, in rats, threats to the offspring (e.g., by an infanticidal intruder) trigger maternal HPAA responses that are comparable to those of nonlactating, control dams ( Deschamps et al. 2003 ; Walker et al. 1995 , 2004 ). As observed in rat models, in humans, dampening of the maternal stress response postpartum appears to vary according to the type of challenge women face ( Tu et al. 2005 ). Studies evaluating breastfeeding women's physiological reactions to mild laboratory physical and psychosocial challenges report attenuated ACTH, cortisol, and glucose responses ( Altemus et al. 1995 ).
Maternal investment is particularly intense immediately after birth. This period, known as postpartum amenorrhea (PA), is energetically subsidized via the suppression of ovarian function. This reproductive suppression period helps mothers to recover energetically from their last pregnancy and reduces the chances of a new conception while the mother is still heavily investing in her last born.
The length of PA is related to women's ability to regulate maternal investment and is an important determinant of their lifetime reproductive success ( Lawson & Mace 2011 ). As the infant grows and complementary foods are introduced, suckling frequency declines, leading to decreases in milk production and fat content. The overall energetic demands on mothers lessen, and energy allocation begins shifting from nursing toward ovarian function, eventually resulting in the resumption of ovarian cyclicity (ROC) ( Jasienska & Ellison 2004 , Valeggia & Ellison 2003 ).
There is a paucity of data regarding HPAA activity and the postpartum amenorrhea–resumption of ovarian cyclicity (PA-ROC) transition. Valeggia & Ellison (2009) collected monthly urine specimens, recorded nursing behavior, and evaluated body mass index from 70 women undergoing the PA-ROC transition. They evaluated monthly urinary cortisol and C-peptide levels, observing an increase in these metabolites as the transition progressed. Women overcame insulin resistance in the period that preceded ROC, and cortisol levels stabilized, while C-peptide continued to increase, reaching a peak immediately before the first menstrual bleeding and dropping to normal eumenorrheic levels immediately thereafter. Valeggia & Ellison (2009) argued that, as infants grow, the observed increases in maternal basal cortisol levels may help direct metabolic energy toward ovarian function.
Longitudinal HPAA-HPGA interactions during women's first postpartum ovarian cycles have yet to be described. Metabolic energy investment continues to shift toward future reproductive opportunities after the first menstrual bleeding postpartum (FBPP) and, with it, the quality of ovarian cycles is expected to gradually improve. Importantly, ovarian function quality appears to vary broadly among women after the FBPP. While some women experience multiple anovulatory cycles and luteal insufficiencies, others conceive on their first ovulation, without even experiencing a FBPP. In one of the few studies on the subject, McNeilly and colleagues (1982) found that only 45% of first cycles were ovulatory. The percentage of ovulatory cycles subsequently increased but only peaked after weaning occurred. Luteal insufficiencies also appear to be common, with approximately 75% of the first three cycles following FBPP presenting lower progesterone levels than those observed in regularly cycling women ( Howie et al. 1982 ). Heinig & Dewey (1997) suggested that longer PA periods should be followed by faster transitions, including higher ovulatory frequencies. As with women who are cycling regularly, those in the early ROC stages should be highly sensitive to HPAA activation and prone to HPGA suppression. To our knowledge, this hypothesis has not yet been tested.
The relatively high costs of raising concurrent human offspring, in terms of the necessary time, attention, and energetic resources required, would suggest that women's reproductive pace (number of offspring/time) should be slower than that of other primates. Yet women present higher fertility rates, earlier weaning, and shorter interbirth-intervals (IBI) than other primate species ( Robson & Wood 2008 ). This counterintuitive fast reproductive pace may be partially explained by the significant amounts of allomaternal care that human nonmothers provide to children ( Antón & Snodgrass 2012 , Hrdy 2009 , Kuzawa & Bragg 2012 ). Today's urban institutional sources of allomaternal care, including day care facilities and schools, replace the care traditionally provided by large networks of allomaternal care providers (e.g., grandmothers, older siblings, and friends) ( Hill & Hurtado 2009 , McKerracher et al. 2020 ). The availability of this intense and reliable reproductive support is likely to account for the comparatively fast speed of women's energetic recovery postpartum, resulting in shorter IBI than other primate species ( Szabo et al. 2017 ). Within this theoretical framework, it is easy to understand why the loss of important members of a woman's social support network would trigger HPAA activation ( Irwin et al. 1988 ).
In humans, the HPAA-HPGA interplay during reproductive maturation is still under investigation. Nonetheless, it is already clear that the HPAA's basal activity increases during the puberty-adolescent transition ( Adam 2006 , Gunnar et al. 2009 ) and that those changes affect gonadal maturation and, subsequently, reproductive hormone levels, the emergence of secondary sexual traits, and behavior ( Hoyt & Falconi 2015 ). Girls also become more sensitive to socio-ecological challenges ( Gunnar et al. 2009 ). This sensitivity appears to be the result of HPGA effects on the HPAA. Estrogen, for example, can both affect the way HPAA reacts and be inhibited by repeated or chronic HPAA activation ( Kirkpatrick et al. 1998 , Toufexis et al. 2014 ).
Age at menarche varies broadly among urban, rural, hunter-gatherer, and pastoralist populations, ranging from a mean age of 9 to 17 ( Broekmans et al. 2009 , Cabrera et al. 2014 , Hillard 2008 , Low et al. 2008 ). A significant proportion (44–72%) of the observed variation is heritable ( Anderson et al. 2007 , Towne et al. 2005 , van den Berg & Boomsma 2007 ). The remainder of this variation appears to be a response to the three key environmental variables mentioned above: risk, predictability, and energy availability ( Stearns 1992 ). The modification of developmental trajectories in response to environmental cues early during development, starting in utero, has been argued to be an evolved response that allows individuals to adjust their phenotype to expected postnatal conditions ( Coall et al. 2016 , Gluckman et al. 2005 , Hales & Barker 2001 , Worthman et al. 2019 ).
The transition from childhood to adulthood involves rapid physical growth and the development of secondary sexual characteristics as well as other physiological and psychological changes ( Blakemore et al. 2010 ). During this time, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulses stimulate the anterior pituitary to secrete gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) ( Ellison et al. 2012 ). Concurrently, growth hormone begins to increase, promoting insulin resistance in adipose tissue, leading to transient hyperinsulinemia that stimulates somatic growth. FSH and LH stimulate the secretion of gonadal steroids (estrogen and progesterone), which stimulate the development of secondary sexual traits. When gonadal steroids reach mature levels, hyperinsulinemia is resolved, and fat deposition is resumed. These hormonal regulators act like interlocking gears, so that changes in one component drive changes in the system as a whole ( Ellison 2017 ).
In industrialized countries, age at menarche has been declining at a rate of 3–4 months per decade ( Ong et al. 2006 , Papadimitriou 2016 ). This secular trend has been attributed to dietary improvements and reductions in physical activity leading to accelerated somatic growth ( Papadimitriou 2016 ). Yet, importantly, the relationship between metabolic energy and age at menarche does not appear to be straightforward. Indeed, contrary to this hypothesis, nutritional restriction in utero also appears to be linked to early menarche. Studies using birth weight as a marker of intrauterine environment quality report that girls with lower birth weights are more likely to experience catch-up growth and earlier menarche ( Sloboda et al. 2007 ). The effects of catch-up growth on girls exposed to undernutrition in utero are illustrated by the results of nutritional interventions aimed at supporting marginalized women in Guatemala ( Ramakrishnan et al. 1999 ) and the adoption of stunted Indian girls by Swedish families ( Proos 2009 ; Proos et al. 1991 , 1993 ). In both cases, girls whose energetic, material, and social conditions improved in comparison to those faced by their mothers during gestation showed clear evidence of catch-up growth. They also initiated reproductive maturation and reached menarche earlier than girls that did not receive the intervention or remained in their country of origin. The observed links between catch-up growth and the timing of reproductive maturation have led to several evolutionary hypotheses attempting to explain their functional origin ( Stearns 1992 ). Prevailing hypotheses are based on the putative advantages these traits may provide in unpredictable and risky environments. To review them, we first need to discuss the role of the HPAA.
In most vertebrates, HPAA activation is equated with physiological stress caused by exogenous factors. Nonetheless, particular life history transitions involve changes in activity in this axis that result from the internal processes that accompany these transitions ( Romero 2002 ). Thus, to appropriately monitor physiological stress levels, we first need to describe and understand life history stage–specific HPAA activity profiles. Reproductive maturation, for example, appears to be accompanied by an increase in basal glucocorticoid levels ( Gunnar et al. 2009 , Legro et al. 2003 , Shirtcliff et al. 2012 ), which mediates the reallocation of metabolic energy from growth to reproductive development and, subsequently, reproductive function. Importantly, individuals approaching reproductive maturation who present increases in HPAA activity above those normative stage-specific profiles appear to be more likely to experience a delay in the timing of their pubertal growth spurt and age at menarche ( Goos & Consten 2002 , Shi et al. 2011 ).
Across species, predictable, low-risk environments (low morbidity and mortality) tend to result in slow life histories. In contrast, unpredictable or risky environments tend to result in faster life histories and opportunistic strategies ( Roff 1992 , Stearns 1992 ). Adjusting life histories to environmental predictability and risk has been argued to ( a ) in low-risk environments, allow individuals to grow slowly, thus achieving an optimal size and resources before reproducing, and ( b ) in high-risk environments, accelerate the pace of maturation, increasing individuals’ chances of reproducing before dying ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Crespi et al. 2013 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Hutchings 1993 , Nettle 2014 , Promislow & Harvey 1990 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). Homo sapiens enjoy more predictable and lower-risk environments than most other mammalian species and, as expected, present a comparatively slow life history ( Antón & Snodgrass 2012 , Hrdy 2009 , Kuzawa & Bragg 2012 ).
Importantly, beyond cross-species analyses, life history principles have also been used to explain within-species variation. Indeed, the rapid catch-up growth and fast development observed among the daughters of marginalized Guatemalan and Indian women described above ( Proos 2009 ; Proos et al. 1991 , 1993 ; Ramakrishnan et al. 1999 ) could be interpreted within this theoretical framework. Their mothers’ experiences in terms of resource availability and reliability, as well as morbidity and mortality, are likely to have affected maternal HPAA activity during gestation and, thus, fetal development ( Barha et al. 2019 ). The catch-up growth and early reproductive maturation observed in these girls could be interpreted as part of an opportunistic strategy aimed at taking advantage of resources present in their new environments, which are very different from those in which they were conceived, gestated, and born ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). In contrast, young elite female athletes subjected to energetic stress experience functional hypothalamic hypogonadism, late menarche, and delays in the development of secondary sexual traits ( Kapczuk 2017 ). Within this theoretical framework, maturational delay experienced by the athletes could be interpreted as a response to the stringent energy balance they experience in the context of a predictable, lower-risk environment, which allows them to complete their somatic development, thereby helping them to optimize reproductive outputs ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ).
The role of risk and predictability has been highlighted by numerous studies. These studies argued that individuals facing elevated mortality rates ( Gaudineau et al. 2010 , Jacobsen et al. 2007 ), the absence of the biological father, or the presence of genetically unrelated men ( Moffitt et al. 1992 , Sear et al. 2019 , Webster et al. 2014 ), as well as other social or physical challenges, such as loss of social support ( Belsky 2012 , Chisholm et al. 2005 ), develop faster and experience early menarche. Yet these results contradict those of other studies. For example, a recent meta-analysis reports the opposite of what life history theory predicts, showing that in countries with high overall mortality, menarche occurs later ( Ellis 2004 , Saffa et al. 2019 ). Nonetheless, it is important to note that most studies investigating the effects of ecological factors on timing of women's reproductive maturation have reported rather small effects, ranging from two to nine months in age at menarche ( Awal et al. 1995 , Karapanou & Papadimitriou 2010 , Mendle et al. 2006 ). Future studies should investigate whether those small effects are biologically meaningful in terms of women's lifetime reproductive success.
In humans, menarche is frequently followed by a period of subfecundity, characterized by ovarian irregularities including anovulatory cycles, luteal deficiencies, and intermittent amenorrhea ( Ellison 2017 ). The length of this period varies widely among individuals, lasting until the late teens in some cases and well into the twenties in others ( Ellison 1996 , Lipson & Ellison 1992 ). As with menarche, risky and unpredictable environments may result in an acceleration of this transition, which is hypothesized to increase the probability of reproducing before dying ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). Consistent with this hypothesis, age at menarche and at first birth are correlated in several populations ( Chisholm et al. 2005 , Coall et al. 2016 , Nettle et al. 2011 ).
Trade-offs between current and future reproduction are important for females of all species but particularly for human females (women from this point forward). Unlike most other mammalian females, women ovulate approximately every 29 days throughout the year ( Bull 2019 ). This trait lowers the opportunity cost of foregoing a single ovulatory event in women relative to other mammalian females, many of which are seasonal or opportunistic breeders that ovulate very infrequently. Southern elephant seals ( Mirounga leonina ), which ovulate only once a year, provide an example of a strict seasonal breeder with an extremely concentrated period of maternal investment. As expected, most of these single, annual ovulatory events in M. leonina result in a live birth ( Le Boeuf et al. 2019 ). In contrast, among sexually active women who do not use contraception, less than 25% of menstrual cycles result in a live birth ( Baird & Strassmann 2000 ). These differences in the ratio of live births to ovarian cycles between women and females of species that do not ovulate continuously could be linked to women's high sensitivity to environmental challenges. Consistent with this hypothesis, HPAA activation resulting from energetic, psychosocial, and immune challenges has been shown to affect ovarian function, conception, pregnancy maintenance, birth outcomes, and the resumption of ovarian function postpartum ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2004 , 2006 , 2007 , 2015 ).
In eumenorrheic women, HPAA activation has been associated with reduced sensitivity to and altered secretion of GnRH, leading to decreases in gonadotropin (FSH and LH) secretion ( Charmandari et al. 2004 , Chrousos et al. 1998 ). Reduced FSH and LH levels can affect follicle maturation and ovulation and lead to luteal insufficiencies, reducing the chances of successful implantations and pregnancies ( Ferin 1999 , Nakamura et al. 2008 , Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 ). HPAA activity can change as a result of a number of challenges, including energetic ones, increasing the risks for hypothalamic amenorrhea, anovulation, hypoestrogenism, luteal deficiencies, and infertility ( Ellison & Lager 1986 , Meczekalski et al. 2014 ). Results from our long-term Society, Environment and Reproduction (SER) cohort study among Mayan women from an agropastoralist community in Guatemala are consistent with those observations. Cycling women showed a positive association between increased cortisol and adrenal progesterone during the follicular phase, which has been linked to decreased fecundability ( Baird & Strassmann 2000 , Baird et al. 1999 , Nepomnaschy et al. 2004 ). Elevated cortisol levels were also associated with reductions in midluteal progesterone, providing a pathway linking stress response to luteal insufficiencies and degenerative endometrium ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2004 ), both of which can negatively affect the implantation process ( Palomba et al. 2015 , Strowitzki et al. 2006 ).
Despite not being seasonal breeders, women's ovarian function has been observed to vary across the year in populations that depend on biomass productivity to meet their energetic demands ( Pierre et al. 2018 ). Seasonal variation in physical activity has also been linked to changes in ovarian function ( Crespi et al. 2013 ; Jasienska & Ellison 1998 , 2004 ). Together, energy availability and expenditure have been hypothesized to explain seasonal variation in birth frequencies ( Bronson 1995 ).
Our team uncovered an important preparative role for HPAA in terms of conception and implantation. A within-women analysis of ovarian cycles from participants in our SER study showed that conceptive cycles were preceded by cortisol increases not observed in non-conceptive cycles ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2015 ). We propose that these apparently normative preconception increases in basal HPAA activity could play an important role in women's preparation to invest in the upcoming conception and gestation. Importantly, in conceptive cycles, cortisol continues to increase, which may mediate the allocation of metabolic energy to the maintenance of a new pregnancy ( Jung et al. 2011 ). However, as discussed above, unexpected pre-ovulatory elevations in cortisol and other stress markers, such as salivary alpha-amylase, beyond the aforementioned normative increases are linked with lower chances of ovulation, conception, and implantation ( Buck Louis et al. 2011 ; Lynch et al. 2014 ; Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 , 2015 ; Rivier & Rivest 1991 ).
Socio-ecological challenges during pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss. A recent meta-analysis of eight studies showed a significant positive association between self-reported stressful life events before and during pregnancy and the risk of miscarriage ( Qu et al. 2017 ). Yet, representative of the existing literature, most studies included in this meta-analysis were retrospective, a design known to be susceptible to recall biases. Nonetheless, the results of our own long-term, prospective, SER cohort study among Mayan women in Guatemala are consistent with those based on self-reports. We found that women who experienced cortisol increases during the first three weeks after conception were 2.7 times more likely to experience a miscarriage ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2006 ). Also consistent with our results, in vitro studies have offered a potential mechanism. Smith and colleagues (2017) , for example, showed that cortisol administration to placental precursor cells inhibits signaling molecules critical for placental development, decreasing initial placental invasion.
Pregnancy involves important trade-offs for mothers. On the one hand, gestation imposes extra energetic demands to meet the requirements of the developing fetus. On the other hand, mothers need to store energy in preparation for nursing and child care postpartum ( Piers et al. 1995 ). This trade-off is also regulated by changes in HPAA activity. During the second and third trimesters, placental CRH secretion stimulates the production of ACTH and cortisol ( Petraglia et al. 1993 ), which feed back onto the placenta to secrete more CRH ( Robinson et al. 1988 ). This positive feedback loop explains late-gestation's maternal hypercortisolemia ( Jung et al. 2011 , Mastorakos & Ilias 2003 ). Cortisol increases may also be partially explained by gestational estrogen, which stimulates the production of CBG, increasing cortisol's half-life ( Nenke et al. 2017 ). Importantly, in contrast to its stimulatory effect on placental CRH production, elevated late-gestation cortisol downregulates hypothalamic CRH production, attenuating HPAA reactivity to psychosocial and physiological stressors ( de Weerth & Buitelaar 2005 ). This suppression of HPAA reactivity is proposed to protect the fetus from the adverse effects of excess glucocorticoid exposure during late gestation ( Kajantie & Phillips 2006 ). This protective mechanism, however, appears to be limited. Extremely poor intrauterine conditions may result in preterm birth, it being the “lesser of two evils.” Indeed, stressful life events, perceived stress, and pregnancy-related anxiety have all been linked to increased risk of preterm birth (i.e., delivery at <37 weeks of gestation) ( Shapiro et al. 2013 ). This is not surprising given that, mechanistically, placental CRH plays an important role in regulating gestational length. CRH increases steeply immediately prior to birth, promoting uterine contractions directly through placental receptors and indirectly through fetal adrenal receptors, which stimulate dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) production ( Stevens et al. 1998 ). DHEAS, aromatized to estrogen in the placenta, promotes myometrium contractions ( Romero et al. 1988 ). Maternal ACTH and cortisol also increase during labor, then decline within four days postpartum ( Mastorakos & Ilias 2003 ). This decline is proposed to limit the transfer of cortisol into breast milk, which has been associated with subsequent fear behavior in two-month old infants ( Glynn et al. 2007 ).
In vertebrate species with maternal care, HPAA activity changes during postpartum, mediating a delicate balance between the mother's survival and maternal investment in offspring survival and growth. This balance is achieved by increasing maternal basal HPAA activity but downregulating HPAA reactivity to a variety of immunological, energetic, and psychosocial challenges, maximizing investment in lactation and offspring care ( Lightmann et al. 2001 , Tu et al. 2006 , Walker et al. 2004 ). Suckling, in particular, seems to exert anxiolytic effects on mothers ( Tu et al. 2005 , Uvnäs-Moberg 1998 ). Nonetheless, in rats, threats to the offspring (e.g., by an infanticidal intruder) trigger maternal HPAA responses that are comparable to those of nonlactating, control dams ( Deschamps et al. 2003 ; Walker et al. 1995 , 2004 ). As observed in rat models, in humans, dampening of the maternal stress response postpartum appears to vary according to the type of challenge women face ( Tu et al. 2005 ). Studies evaluating breastfeeding women's physiological reactions to mild laboratory physical and psychosocial challenges report attenuated ACTH, cortisol, and glucose responses ( Altemus et al. 1995 ).
Maternal investment is particularly intense immediately after birth. This period, known as postpartum amenorrhea (PA), is energetically subsidized via the suppression of ovarian function. This reproductive suppression period helps mothers to recover energetically from their last pregnancy and reduces the chances of a new conception while the mother is still heavily investing in her last born.
The length of PA is related to women's ability to regulate maternal investment and is an important determinant of their lifetime reproductive success ( Lawson & Mace 2011 ). As the infant grows and complementary foods are introduced, suckling frequency declines, leading to decreases in milk production and fat content. The overall energetic demands on mothers lessen, and energy allocation begins shifting from nursing toward ovarian function, eventually resulting in the resumption of ovarian cyclicity (ROC) ( Jasienska & Ellison 2004 , Valeggia & Ellison 2003 ).
There is a paucity of data regarding HPAA activity and the postpartum amenorrhea–resumption of ovarian cyclicity (PA-ROC) transition. Valeggia & Ellison (2009) collected monthly urine specimens, recorded nursing behavior, and evaluated body mass index from 70 women undergoing the PA-ROC transition. They evaluated monthly urinary cortisol and C-peptide levels, observing an increase in these metabolites as the transition progressed. Women overcame insulin resistance in the period that preceded ROC, and cortisol levels stabilized, while C-peptide continued to increase, reaching a peak immediately before the first menstrual bleeding and dropping to normal eumenorrheic levels immediately thereafter. Valeggia & Ellison (2009) argued that, as infants grow, the observed increases in maternal basal cortisol levels may help direct metabolic energy toward ovarian function.
Longitudinal HPAA-HPGA interactions during women's first postpartum ovarian cycles have yet to be described. Metabolic energy investment continues to shift toward future reproductive opportunities after the first menstrual bleeding postpartum (FBPP) and, with it, the quality of ovarian cycles is expected to gradually improve. Importantly, ovarian function quality appears to vary broadly among women after the FBPP. While some women experience multiple anovulatory cycles and luteal insufficiencies, others conceive on their first ovulation, without even experiencing a FBPP. In one of the few studies on the subject, McNeilly and colleagues (1982) found that only 45% of first cycles were ovulatory. The percentage of ovulatory cycles subsequently increased but only peaked after weaning occurred. Luteal insufficiencies also appear to be common, with approximately 75% of the first three cycles following FBPP presenting lower progesterone levels than those observed in regularly cycling women ( Howie et al. 1982 ). Heinig & Dewey (1997) suggested that longer PA periods should be followed by faster transitions, including higher ovulatory frequencies. As with women who are cycling regularly, those in the early ROC stages should be highly sensitive to HPAA activation and prone to HPGA suppression. To our knowledge, this hypothesis has not yet been tested.
The relatively high costs of raising concurrent human offspring, in terms of the necessary time, attention, and energetic resources required, would suggest that women's reproductive pace (number of offspring/time) should be slower than that of other primates. Yet women present higher fertility rates, earlier weaning, and shorter interbirth-intervals (IBI) than other primate species ( Robson & Wood 2008 ). This counterintuitive fast reproductive pace may be partially explained by the significant amounts of allomaternal care that human nonmothers provide to children ( Antón & Snodgrass 2012 , Hrdy 2009 , Kuzawa & Bragg 2012 ). Today's urban institutional sources of allomaternal care, including day care facilities and schools, replace the care traditionally provided by large networks of allomaternal care providers (e.g., grandmothers, older siblings, and friends) ( Hill & Hurtado 2009 , McKerracher et al. 2020 ). The availability of this intense and reliable reproductive support is likely to account for the comparatively fast speed of women's energetic recovery postpartum, resulting in shorter IBI than other primate species ( Szabo et al. 2017 ). Within this theoretical framework, it is easy to understand why the loss of important members of a woman's social support network would trigger HPAA activation ( Irwin et al. 1988 ).

Section: STRESS AND THE END OF REPRODUCTION

Women who face chronic stress should have less energy for somatic maintenance and, therefore, experience accelerated reproductive aging. Consistent with this prediction, a meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies reported that underweight women have over twice the risk of experiencing early menopause (before age 45; 2.15 relative risk ratio) compared to lean to normal weight women ( Zhu et al. 2018 ). Once again, given its role in metabolic energy mobilization, the HPAA should play a role as a mediator of the relationship between energetic constraints and early menopause ( Meczekalski et al. 2014 ). Indeed, chronic stress has been linked to accelerated ovarian aging, as indexed by early increases in follicular FSH ( Pal et al. 2010 ), while perceived stress has been associated with increased rates of ovarian follicle loss ( Bleil et al. 2012 ). Also, women experiencing chronically elevated ACTH and cortisol present earlier age at menopause ( Bromberger et al. 1997 ). Studies using telomere length (TL) as a marker of stress and cellular aging provide additional evidence ( Hanna et al. 2009 ). Women who exhibit shorter TLs present symptoms of premature ovarian failure, including recurrent miscarriages, increased infertility, and chromosomal nondisjunction ( Keefe & Liu 2009 ). Conversely, women with long leukocyte TLs experience menopause three years after those with shorter ones ( Gray et al. 2014 ), which, in natural fertility conditions, could result in the production of an additional child.
Life history theory predicts that high-risk, challenging environments should favor individuals who develop fast life history trajectories: early menarche and early menopause ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). As predicted, high mortality environments have been linked with earlier age at menarche ( Gaudineau et al. 2010 , Jacobsen et al. 2007 ). Faster reproductive trajectories may optimize reproductive fitness in said high mortality environments. This optimization, however, is hypothesized to come at a cost. Early investment in reproduction would leave fewer resources to be invested in maintenance, leading to accelerated aging. Consistent with this prediction, earlier menarche has been linked to early menopause and numerous health problems later in life, including higher risk of cardiometabolic disorders, cognitive decline, osteoporosis and bone fracture, premature mortality, and decreased life expectancy and longevity ( Gold 2011 , Szegda et al. 2017 , Wellons et al. 2012 ). Yet, chronologically, these risk factors occur before early menopause and subsequent cardiovascular disease and stroke. Thus, increased risk of cardiovascular disease–related morbidity and mortality could be a contributing factor to early menopause ( Haussmann & Marchetto 2010 ). Together, these observations suggest that socio-ecological challenges may lead to reproductive strategies in women whereby they may accelerate reproduction early in life to mitigate fitness losses linked to the earlier onset of menopause. More prospective, longitudinal studies that incorporate physiological stress markers into their study designs are needed to further our understanding of how exposure to chronic stress affects the reproductive aging process. An important phenomenon to consider in future studies is that HPAA responsiveness appears to increase with chronological age ( Kudielka et al. 1999 , Seeman et al. 2001 , Veldhuis et al. 2013 ).

Section: CONCLUSIONS

The HPAA acts as a critical mediator of the effects that energy, risks, and predictability have on the pace of reproductive trajectories. Human studies have often focused on HPAA's suppressive effects on the HPGA. Yet HPAA-HPGA interactions are complex. Increases in basal HPAA activity can also prepare women's bodies for investment in reproduction, as appears to be the case during reproductive maturation and the resumption of ovarian function postpartum. Furthermore, HPAA reactivity can be selectively dampened at particular times, as during late pregnancy and early postpartum, to prioritize offspring survival.
HPAA reactivity and sensitivity at specific life stages appear to be influenced by the type, intensity, and duration of environmental challenges each individual experienced during development ( Provencal & Binder 2015 ). In high-risk, unpredictable environments, life histories can be accelerated, leading to early menarche and shorter IBIs ( Belsky et al. 2012 , Griskevicius et al. 2011 , Nettle 2014 , Simpson et al. 2012 ). These adaptations, however, come at a cost as menopause is also reached earlier and may be accompanied by higher morbidity and mortality.

Section: FUTURE DIRECTIONS

To further our understanding of the role that socio-ecological challenges play in modulating women's reproductive trajectories, we need to fully describe HPAA-HPGA interactions across the entirety of their lifespans. This endeavor will require large, prospective, longitudinal studies that include the frequent collection of biological specimens during key reproductive transitions. Anthropologists have pioneered those study designs, but funding and logistic constraints have often resulted in small sample sizes and studies focused on particular reproductive stages rather than the entire lifespan. Additionally, the current focus on energy availability and expenditure needs to be expanded to investigate in more detail the roles of risk and predictability ( Stearns 1992 ). Information regarding morbidity and mortality risks are available for many populations, but they are seldom considered when developing hypotheses and models or interpreting results. Some environmental variables can be “easily” predicted, such as seasonal variation in light exposure, temperature, or rainfall. Others are harder to predict, such as individuals’ probability of survival until their children reach reproductive maturity or the probability of intrafamilial violent conflicts or sexual abuse. The advancement of machine learning techniques may help us advance with this task, as well as with the development of overall population and individual-specific environmental predictability factors to help generate more accurate models ( Ellison 2017 ).
Appropriate biomarker choices would also facilitate advances. Logistic and ethical constraints involved in working with humans have made urinary and salivary cortisol the “stress” markers of choice. Yet, as with all biomarkers, these are not free from limitations. Briefly, given the dynamic nature of HPAA activity, single cortisol measurements are extremely difficult to interpret; thus, multiple data points are needed per participant ( Nepomnaschy et al. 2007 , 2011 , 2012 , 2015 ). Saliva is appropriate only to evaluate stress reactivity before and after a challenge, but not to evaluate changes in basal HPAA activity. Cortisol awakening response presents challenges, as it depends on participants’ strict adherence to collection protocols in terms of the time of collection—not always easy upon awakening ( Sarkar et al. 2013 ). First morning urine cortisol presents advantages, including a reduction of the confounding effects of food consumption and physical activity, yet it still offers a partial understanding of the physiological phenomena of interest. CBG levels, tissue-specific expression of glucorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, their affinity for cortisol and other steroids, and their variation over time regulate the effects of free cortisol ( Breuner & Orchinik 2002 , Colli et al. 2007 , Hammond 2016 , Joëls et al. 2008 ). Evaluating said factors in individuals living their regular everyday lives in nonurban populations is logistically complex and often prohibitively expensive. Thus, our data sets are limited; we should keep in mind that we are observing only a small fraction of the phenomenon of interest when we are interpreting and discussing results and be cautious in our conclusions.
To conclude, the HPAA plays many intricate physiological roles. Modulating reproductive trajectories is only one of them and is affected by the HPAA's other roles. The resulting complexities have led numerous colleagues to suggest that there may not actually be a general pattern that describes HPAA-HPGA interactions, or, if there is one, there are many exceptions to it ( Bonier et al. 2009a , Breuner et al. 2008 , Crespi et al. 2013 ). Our review suggests that a pattern may exist, but it is, indeed, extremely complex and is context and life stage dependent.
