Elinor Ochs characterizes herself in her subtle and thought-provoking Perspective article as always liminal, inhabiting a transgressive and generative interdisciplinary space, in this instance at the nexus of linguistics, anthropology, and psychology. She claims to have been, in her own phrase, “disciplinarily errant,” moving with abandon, curiosity, and imagination across multiple perspectives and canonical traditions, yet always on the margins. Another way of viewing her career might, however, be to focus on its profound role in shaping contemporary anthropology, working at the field's heart rather than on its edges. The breadth of the questions with which she engages and the range of approaches she employs in pursuing them are remarkable. They also mirror the capacious and multiangled character of anthropology at its best.
While the Perspectives genre by definition focuses on a particular scholar, Ochs's article—and the lifetime of work and creativity it captures—foregrounds the deep and lively collaborations central to her scholarship. This shared intellectual work can be seen in the decades of “thinking with others,” of collectively imagining revelatory ethnographic points of entry, analytical approaches, and ways of representing complex and often open-ended findings that her article lays out. The five key elements she discusses as central to making cothinking possible—having a life, being willing to transgress, working through collective conversation, sharing a literal table in real time, and eating very well together—are not routine scholarly advice. They do, however, emphasize the relationality at the heart of scholarship, as well as of those communities within which we work.
The reviews in this volume exemplify the broad methodological, theoretical, and topical range of anthropology. At the same time, many of them can generatively be put into conversation with each other, for example, the cluster of articles on North American archaeology; the pieces exploring digital approaches in both archaeology and cultural anthropology; and the ways in which biological anthropology investigations into race, health, and culture uniquely intersect with other subfields and disciplines. In her Perspective article, Ochs claims that, for her, “bibliographies become a gateway drug,” a guide for exploration, reframing, and intellectual challenge and opportunity. The critical reviews in this volume will, we hope, afford similar pleasures, challenges, and resources for rethinking. These articles offer a welcome respite to “think together,” providing an antidote to global political and ideological divisions that tend to pull us apart.
As always, we thank our Annual Reviews community, and especially our colleagues on the Editorial Committee. We say farewell to Tine Gammeltoft, who is rotating off the Committee in December, and welcome Annemarie Samuels of the University of Leiden, who will be joining us in 2023. We particularly thank our production editor, Jennifer Mann, for her exquisite attention to detail, incomparable expertise, and collaborative leadership; she is wonderful to think with. This volume, like Ochs's Perspective article, is a tribute to all.
