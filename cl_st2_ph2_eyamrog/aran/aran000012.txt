Title: Retranslating Resilience Theory in Archaeology


Section: 


Section: ABSTRACT

The environmental crisis is rendering increasingly large areas of the planet inhospitable. As it reaches a tipping point, global warming is initiating cascades of ecological transformation, mass extinction, and irreversible damage—all of them increasingly beyond human control. To mitigate this situation, we need intellectual tools that can call on both the sciences and the humanities and spark integrated approaches that address deep-time scales. Archaeology can make a substantial contribution here. This article reviews the merits and limitations of the resilience concept in archaeology. Despite its ever-increasing relevance, resilience is still frequently understood within the framework of positivist approaches and branches of systems thinking that cannot capture our unfolding predicament and pay too little attention to the embodied historical asymmetries between more-than-human social worlds. This review identifies the potential for reformulations of resilience theory and its attendant concepts within a less positivistic and human-centered conceptual register. New translations of resilience in archaeology pave the way for more nuanced approaches to concepts of history and their sociopolitical use, as well as alternative time dynamics of historical change.

Section: 1. INTRODUCTION

The concept of resilience has been promoted as a promising boundary concept 1 ( Brand & Jax 2007 , Bollig 2014 ) that can slip the narrow confines of science and be used to inform policy, planning, and practice as an antidote to the social and environmental crises of modernity. Resilience theory is the theory of how capable a system is “to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks” ( Walker et al. 2004 ). Resilience typically applies to how societies adapt to major environmental and social transformations. In addition, resilience is used to mean several different things: not only the capacity to absorb disturbances, to bounce back, and to recover after a hazard, but also coping, withstanding, elasticity, resistance, and stubbornness ( Holling 1973 ; Mitchell et al. 2000 , p. 145; Walker & Salt 2006 , p. xiii; Olsson et al. 2015 ).
As well as being a response to disturbance, resilience inherently refers to a time frame. When used in an archaeological research setting, resilience refers to time frames far longer than most ecological timescales. In so doing, resilience can reveal the breadth of the diverse responses available to us as we deliberate on how to mitigate crises. This capability is what makes resilience such a powerful tool in bringing the important historical dynamics of cultural change and adaptation to the fore.
At the same time, resilience thinking comes with its own epistemological baggage. The term was initially introduced into archaeology from a branch of postwar systems ecology that ran into multiple epistemological problems stemming from its sustained dichotomy between nature and culture through flows of matter and energy ( Odum 2007 ), from positivist methodological approaches based on simplified relations, and from a lack of time dynamics alternative to those of the adaptive cycle (for a critique, see Barrios 2017 ). In addition, the use of resilience theory in the technocratic fields of landscape planning, management, and conservation ( Taylor 1988 ) led to its being seen as ahistorical—and insensitive both to issues of political economy and to ontological asymmetries in social worlds inhabited by more-than-humans. These charges called resilience theory into question as a useful concept, with the further effect of preventing archaeological research from extending its horizons into the environmental turn ( Hussain & Riede 2020 ) or into multispecies ethnographies (pp. 12–13). Resilience theory thus became yet another symptom of archaeology's struggle to find its way across the science–humanities divide [ Snow 2001 (1959) ]. This struggle is the point of departure for this review.
I therefore set out to explain how resilience theory—and key related ecological concepts, such as the adaptive cycle—came into archaeology, focusing on a range of salient themes that resilience is commonly called on to address, including responses to catastrophe, collapse of empires and civilizations, modeling for climate and agricultural regimes, and causal inference. The prolific interest in resilience theory means that some of the existing resilience literature has already been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Fisher et al. 2009 ; Marston 2015 , p. 587ff; Faulseit 2016 ; Bradtmöller et al. 2017 ). Much of that literature has critically engaged with the misalignments between archaeological data and resilience modeling in terms of methods and archaeological data resolution ( Carpenter et al. 2001 ). But in-depth discussions of the underlying epistemological basis to resilience theory have remained largely absent from archaeology. I therefore reengage with the salient themes more critically in Sections 4 and 5; in these sections, I evaluate where resilience thinking falls apart and yet where we need to retain core concerns but translate them into new approaches. I particularly note how resilience thinking expresses a valuable concern with adaptation, risk mitigation, and the temporal dynamics of cultural and ecological change but tends to be ahistorical and inattentive to other temporalities and asymmetries in more-than-human social worlds. I then focus on alternative translations of resilience thinking. I argue that concepts from the environmental humanities and from evolutionary biology, such as landesque capital, adaptive capacity, and niche construction theory, can be deployed to shed new light on some of the problematic sociopolitical translations of resilience thinking if developed and translated by archaeologists in new ways. Drawing on this work, I suggest that an archaeology attuned to resilience is most constructive when it integrates temporal, relational, and multispecies sensitivities. These must include addressing how humans, animals, plants, and materials can cocreate mutually constrained and mutually beneficial persistence so that disturbances to those relations are not necessarily to be seen as catastrophes and so that change does not necessarily occur as swift and all-encompassing regime shifts.

Section: 2. RESILIENCE THEORY IN ARCHAEOLOGY

The introduction of resilience theory into archaeology is strongly associated with the history of collapse studies ( Tainter 1988 , Yoffee & Cowgill 1988 ; see also McAnany & Yoffee 2010 , Faulseit 2016 , Middleton 2017 , Weiss 2017 ). Collapse was seen for a long time as the ultimate cultural breakdown—a population crash or a considerable decrease in complexity ( Tainter 1988 , p. 4). However, in the mid-1980s, archaeologists began to explore what happens after a collapse: transformation, survival, and regeneration. Yoffee & Cowgill (1988 , p. 15) noted that although states can end, state collapse does not necessarily mean the end of cultures, populations, or societal orders. Renfrew (1984 , pp. 369–71, 383) initially addressed resilience by speculating that state collapse may be cyclical and that past chiefdoms and state societies may have regenerated quite rapidly. In this context, resilience emphasized the capacities of innovation and reorganization in the aftermath of a catastrophe rather than seeing collapse as a terminus.
This work was followed by a stream of explorations of what collapse means and to whom. Collapse has mainly been seen either as something imposed from the outside (e.g., by climate change or natural disasters: Middleton 2017 , p. 80ff; Weiss 2017 ) or as something that unintendedly but inevitably builds up owing to sociopolitical evolution (e.g., overpopulation and exploitation: Tainter 1988 , Diamond 2005 ).
A much-debated theme has been the rise and fall of states and civilizations such as the Roman or Akkadian Empires, the classical Maya, the Chou dynasty, or the Mycenaean kingdom ( Hodell 1995 , Dunning et al. 2012 , Manning 2013 , Tainter 2014 , Storey & Storey 2017 ). According to Weiss (2017 ; see also Weiss et al. 1993 ), the collapse of the Akkadian Empire and its correlation with the 4.2–4 ka bp “megadrought” in Mesopotamia ( Middleton 2012 , p. 274) can be explained by the catastrophic consequences of precipitation reduction and desertification for irrigated field areas. High-yield cereal dry-farming agriculture became impossible to sustain, leading to the collapse not only of the Akkadian Empire but also of adjacent regions. Tainter, however, sees this collapse as the consequence of an inescapable circle of increasing complexity, which built from various problem-solving initiatives to a sudden loss of social complexity ( Tainter 1988 , pp. 4–18).
Diamond's (2005) Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed brought collapse studies to wider public attention and debate. Both Diamond and Hardin, with the latter's concept of the tragedy of the commons, presented a simple cause-and-effect story that was easy to communicate. They presented a direct link between collapse and climate change, mismanagement, and “ecocide.” In this story, the complexities of culture and political economy played a very insignificant part. A comparable narrative of hubristic societies whose insensitive behaviors prevented them from surviving is presented by Johnson (2017) , for whom the collapse of the Maya Empire was the consequence of the “failure to react to changes in local conditions” (p. 59) intrinsically related to “excessive pride or arrogance” (pp. 1–2).
Redman (2005 , 2014 ; Redman & Kinzig 2003 ) was the first scholar to explicitly introduce resilience concepts from ecology into archaeology. His work substantially shaped the archaeological integration of resilience theory. He promoted a series of ecological concepts of how ecosystems behave and change. One concept was the adaptive cycle ( Gunderson & Holling 2002 ), a cyclical pattern of change in four phases, depicted as a loop moving continuously through four phases: growth (r phase), reorganization (α phase), conservation (K phase), and release (Ω phase). This loop depicted change as episodic, building up gradually to a sudden release and major qualitative regime change (Ω). Another key theory was panarchy, introduced as a way to link different scales of social interaction ( Holling 2001 , Gunderson & Holling 2002 ). The panarchy consists of multiple, hierarchically nested adaptive cycles of different durations. It implies that the speed of change varies across scales and that rapid change is linked to long-term processes—not unlike Braudel's [1996 (1949) ] theorization of plural temporalities. A third attendant concept was that of coupled social-ecological systems, related to general systems and cybernetics. This concept saw resilience as a measure of the persistence of complex adaptive systems ( Folke 2006 ).
After Redman, a significant strand of archaeological research subsequently addressed how deteriorating climate events have historically impacted more-than-human social worlds. These climate events include drought ( Weiss 2017 , Weiberg & Finné 2018 , Carolin et al. 2019 , Manning et al. 2020 ), volcanic eruptions ( Riede 2008 , 2017 ; Torrence 2016 ), sea level rise ( Astrup 2018 ), cooling episodes ( Zhang et al. 2011 , Bradtmöller et al. 2012 , Flohr et al. 2015 ), and earthquakes ( Forlin & Gerrard 2017 ). In this context, resilience is often measured in terms of societies’ responses to climate stress, ranging from population crashes ( Hodell et al. 1995 , Zhang et al. 2011 ) and loss of complexity to less rapid change.
Many scholars working in this strand of research have targeted the chronology of testing for issues of timing and causality ( Marston 2015 , p. 587; Marchant et al. 2018 ). Some see climate change as the principal driver of major systemic change. Riede (2008) studied the Laacher See volcanic eruption in Western Germany at 13 ka bp , focusing on its repercussions for peoples’ isolation and networks. For Riede, mobility and intergroup connectedness were key for peoples’ resilience and ability to sustain technological complexity. Nelson et al. (2006) studied the effects of drought and environmental degradation in the Mimbres region of New Mexico in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries. Nelson et al. used the adaptive cycle to describe the phases in which societies grew and expanded: For example, aggregated villages and irrigation systems constituted the growth phase (the r phase). This aggregation and growth, however, led to an unsustainable stage and, subsequently, under social and environmental stress, to village depopulation (the Ω phase) and reorganization to dispersed hamlets (the α phase). Carolin et al. (2019) investigated the 4.2 ka bp megadrought in northern Mesopotamia in terms of dust levels. They focused specifically on modeling timing and argued that environmental change caused the permanent abandonment of agricultural and urban settlements.
Later works increasingly paved the way for multifaceted causal mechanisms and for exploration of resilience at the local level. For example, Manning et al. (2020) used Bayesian modeling to test the chronological correlation between two major episodes of climate change and their effects on tell settlement patterns in the Northern Levant (4.2 ka bp and 3.2 ka bp ). They found no direct relationship between climate change and systemic collapse of palatial economies and trading networks and large-scale site abandonment, stressing how lower-risk subsistence strategies and stable access to underground aquifers made societies more resilient to the drought ( Manning et al. 2020 ). Weiberg & Finné (2018) investigated how Late Bronze Age societies in the Peloponnese responded to a long-term increase in aridity. They combined quantitative data on a number of archaeological sites with climate change and stable oxygen isotope data to model an adaptive cycle of climate volatility across 750 years. They found no unequivocal link between climate change and societal decline but pointed to a nonlinear relationship between catastrophe and its delayed societal reaction.
A substantial group of archaeological scholars believe that resilience should be rendered measurable and operational through quantitative methods and modeling. This work has generated extensive modeling of large ranges of climate and archaeological data (e.g., Lawrence et al. 2016 , Allcock 2017 , Brewer & Riede 2018 , Marchant et al. 2018 ), meaning that resilience can be studied within millennial-scale perspectives. For example, Flohr et al. (2015) studied early farming communities’ responses to climate change across 2,000 years in Southwest Asia, based on 3,397 carbon-14 ( 14 C) dates. Redman & Kinzig (2003) placed the history of the ancient Mesopotamian societies within a 1,500-year cycle. Torrence (2016) modeled the societal impacts of volcanic events across 40 ka years in Papua New Guinea. Weiberg & Finné (2018) studied the impact of climate change on agrarian societies in the Late Bronze Age Peloponnese across 750 years.
The adaptive cycle is frequently used as a tool for modeling causal links between climate change and societal transformations. Rosen & Rivera-Collazo (2012) used it to model Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene foraging systems in the Southern Levant. Their mapping of how human adaptive cycles interlocked with cycles of plants and animals allowed them to see climatic fluctuations as leading shifts in resource focus to alternative stable states. Bradtmöller et al. (2012) modeled the North Atlantic Heinrich events and their effects on Neanderthal population dynamics on the Iberian Peninsula in 50–20 ka bp . They proposed a four-step cascade model of the interaction between climate cycles and population dynamics, seeing extreme climatic deterioration as leading to cycles of population breakdown and cultural change. Marston (2015 , pp. 589ff) used modeling to investigate the relationship between different observable shifts in prehistoric agricultural regimes across 2,000 years in Central Anatolia (pp. 589ff). In parallel with Weiberg & Finné (2018) , Marston (2015) points to unsustainable “mismatches” (pp. 586ff) between agricultural and social processes such as mobility, grazing intensity, and population pressures, when populations change their technologies more rapidly than their mindsets.
A smaller group of resilience scholars have explored the core concerns of resilience in a less quantitative mode. Some have focused on landscape histories, often featuring multifaceted resilience strategies of land use and risk mitigation, investigating how forms of collective governance have reduced the damage caused by natural disasters ( Kaland 2014 , Oosthuizen 2016 ). Lagerås & Magnell (2020) studied preindustrial farm–village relationships in Southern Scandinavia across nearly 800 years, 1025–1800 ce . They focus on the economic latitude that humans have created for themselves, using mixed farming to move nutrients from the outfield to the infield along with three-course rotation systems. This setup was relatively stable in terms of crop/livestock ratio and abundances. The authors argue that intergroup coordination and collaborative forms of governance played a vital role in the intergenerational persistence of this system.

Section: 3. REASONS TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT RESILIENCE

In the last two decades, resilience thinking has offered a substantial alternative to seeing system collapse as breakdown. In place of systems breakdown, resilience thinking emphasizes reorganization and survival. However, during the same period, translations of resilience theory and its attendant concepts have been deployed within relatively narrow frameworks deriving from 1970s ecology. This limited translation and reshaping have shaped a research field that resonates strongly with the natural sciences, advocating hypothesis testing, quantification, and causal modeling. One advantage of this intellectual horizon is its concern with deep-time and quantifiable dimensions, and it may embody how different subdomains may be differentially susceptible to change, yielding differential resilience potentials ( Bollig 2014 ). A downside is that the less developed attunement to recent ontological perspectives in the social sciences means that some of this research runs into problems when it confronts more-than-human systems and deep-time change.
There are hence several reasons for skepticism about particular ways in which resilience has been formulated. The first of these reasons is that the integration of resilience theory into archaeology has brought with it a series of epistemological issues connected to human–environment relations. The adoption of a resilience concept that was inherently derived from ecology has led to an overly apocalyptic emphasis on climate change and environmental crises as the principal drivers of innovation and societal change (also noted by Butzer & Endfield 2012 ). This tendency is particularly pronounced in studies that rely on resilience modeling. Here, cultural practices are turned into proxies and often analyzed against “natural” ones ( Marston 2015 , p. 587). Critical awareness of sociocultural dynamics is reflected in studies of so-called coupled social and ecological systems (e.g., Folke et al. 2002 ; Folke 2006 , p. 253; Costanza et al. 2007 ; Liu et al. 2007 ; Rosen & Rivera-Collazo 2012 ; Marston 2015 ; Weiberg & Finné 2018 ); but despite their wish to integrate ecological and social insights, the notion of coupled systems in itself implies an identifiable boundary where the social ends and the ecological starts because, if something is coupled, it can also be uncoupled. In this respect, many resilience modeling studies sustain Western dichotomies between nature and culture (also noted by Fitzhugh et al. 2019 , p. 1083) in ways that cannot account for more profound entanglements such as human-induced climate change, domestication, or landscape formation.
Moreover, many resilience studies adopt a highly anthropocentric focus, failing to engage with the question of other embodied historical, more-than-human beings. This problem is particularly pronounced in resilience modeling studies of empires and civilizations, which stress human centrality, sovereignty, and essentialism. In this context, such relations are addressed in terms of resource exploitation, environmental engineering, and rational economic choice, with the consequence that other, more-than-human species are reduced to natural capital (cf. Rosen & Rivera-Collazo 2012 ). This bias is also visible in Diamond's (2005) work, in which it is these relationships, implying environmental ignorance, overexploitation, and unwillingness to change, that lead to a collapse.
The second reason to be skeptical about using resilience theory in archaeology is that it relies on a rather narrow set of methodological approaches. Initially, archaeology adopted resilience theory and its related concepts from a particular branch of ecology and midcentury approaches to systems thinking. It then attempted to quantify the archaeological material accordingly. Such is the case, for example, in studies that model “cultural cycles,” “thresholds,” and alternative stable states. At first sight, modeling looks like a significant strength of resilience theory ( Carpenter et al. 2001 , p. 767), including the fact that different types of resilience can be distinguished ( Bollig 2014 , pp. 274ff), quantified, and turned into operational indicators. But Fitzhugh et al. (2019 , p. 1083) remind us that the transformation of past life into quantifiable variables does not come without a cost. Absent a thorough engagement in both critical theory and landscape histories, such studies run the risk of missing the multiplicity of relations and capacities that are relevant to resilience (such as flexibility) but cannot be accurately modeled.
A third reason for skepticism is that the adaptive cycle model embodies a particular understanding of the nature of change. It implies that change is episodic and takes place in the form of regime shifts as tipping points are crossed, at which point a system moves from slow accumulation phases to sudden release. Thus change occurs rapidly and qualitatively, not gradually or quantitatively over time. Understanding historical transitions in this way has critical implications, not least when such dynamics are directly transferred from the evolution of ecosystems to historical regimes, epochs, and civilizations. The idea of the tipping point implies that societal activity becomes ever more intense until just before the point when everything (almost) goes wrong, e.g., within a given year, 1177 bce (cf. Cline 2014 ) or epoch ( Zimmermann 2012 , p. 251; Peters & Zimmermann 2017 ). The tipping point also embodies a particular understanding of the past as something that can be overwritten every time the system bounces back from a given perturbation, with the objective that the system will remain unchanged. Furthermore, the adaptive cycles model implies a certain determinism about levels of time-transgressive macropatterns of change ( Redman & Kinzig 2003 , Marston 2015 , Zimmermann 2012 , Solich & Bradtmöller 2017 ). The question is, however, to what extent this pathway is contingent and contextually sensitive.
The archaeological record can be fragmented or have poor resolution in comparison with contemporary ecology, and for some resilience modelers this is grounds for expressed frustration. These researchers stress that more and better resolution data are required to investigate resilience quantitatively and comprehensively ( Costanza et al. 2007 ; Bradtmöller et al. 2012 ; Zimmermann 2012 ; Flohr et al. 2015 ; Carolin et al. 2019 ; Manning et al. 2020 , p. 2). A similar frustration has been expressed in connection with the lack of terminological, methodological, and conceptual consistency in the field ( Carpenter et al. 2001 , p. 766ff; Brand & Jax 2007 ; Flohr et al. 2015 ; Faulseit 2016 , pp. 6–7; Peters & Zimmermann 2017 ; Brewer & Riede 2018 ) and in connection with the difficulties of fully integrating qualitative properties with strictly quantitative, ecology-inspired models. Olsson et al. (2015) , on the other hand, are skeptical about this endeavor and see it as a form of scientific imperialism. They advocate instead for methodological and conceptual pluralism, using resilience as a form of middle-range theory that may or may not fit every ontology and definition.
Hence, developing the integration between quantitative and qualitative resilience approaches remains key. One way to do so is perhaps to dramatically redefine some of the core resilience concepts (such as the adaptive cycle and panarchy) without abandoning their core concerns (such as the relationship between persistence and change).
The above discussion brings me to the fourth hesitation: Resilience as a quality of complex adaptive systems does not fully account for the complexity of historical dynamics. Resilience thinking as originally introduced into the archaeology research field relies fundamentally on general systems ontologies ( Redman & Kinzig 2003 , Folke 2006 , Walker & Salt 2006 , Costanza et al. 2007 ). The systemic perspective seems attractive for addressing the macrohistorical dynamics of modern environmental crises ( Steffen et al. 2015 , 2018 )—the more so if combined with thick histories and operationalized archaeological data from regions subject to recent development-led excavation data booms ( Bradley et al. 2014 ). However, the specific system approaches as practiced in the archaeological resilience literature tend to run into problems in terms of the compatibility of scales and accounting for contingencies, legacy effects, and variable outcomes of change (see, however, Janssen & Scheffer 2004 , Scheffer & Nes 2007 , Marston 2015 , Weiberg & Finné 2018 ). Studies of kingdoms and civilizations can look like rather self-contained, highly anthropocentric systems or like idealized sociopolitical models that are fundamentally disconnected from wider biosocial worlds. Paradoxically, although the panarchy builds on the notion of nested scales and hierarchies, it is precisely in the meeting between macrohistory and metanarratives—and in the social and microlevel perspectives—that it runs into problems ( Butzer & Endfield 2012 , p. 3628). For example, whereas on the macro systems scale the adaptive cycle can be an explanatory measure of continuity, on the micro scale neither humans nor nonhumans necessarily survive a collapse. Even though it has the unique capacity to contribute historical depth and context, archaeology has still achieved only limited exploration of this potential and the fact that there are profound differences between sections—not necessarily “scales”—of societies in their predispositions for dealing with major pressures and disruptions.
The Anthropocene evokes multispecies relations in an essentially multiscalar fashion, connecting local markets to global economies ( van Dooren 2014 ) without evoking the panarchy. For example, Tsing (2015) unfolds how present-day mushroom pickers in Oregon's Cascade mountain range are deeply entangled in global assemblages of labor, industrial infrastructures, and supply chains. Ogden et al. (2013) show how open-water travel for the Iñupiat on the Chukchi Sea has become subject to “double exposure” (citing Leichenko & O'Brien 2008 ) in that risk has increased dramatically along with global environmental and market-driven processes of change. The Atlantic heathlands, having survived radical climate change over the past 5,000 years, are currently giving way to grasslands owing to supraregional atmospheric pollution ( Fagúndez 2013 ). These processes point to structures and systems that exert a linear pathway toward extinction so that these examples therefore challenge the adaptive cycle. Thus, we may want to revive ideas of collapse as a real and present phenomenon in the Anthropocene. The examples also suggest that a better understanding of resilience needs to integrate larger planetary perspectives and world systems.
A final reason for skepticism is the failure of resilience theory to absorb questions of political economy and inequality into the survival prospects of both humans and more-than-humans (noted by, e.g., Carpenter et al. 2001 , Bollig 2014 , Olsson et al. 2015 , Barrios 2016 , Fitzhugh et al. 2019 ). Resilience often comes across as a sort of passive state in which societies must somehow be prepared to accept and react to whatever is to come ( Walker & Cooper 2018 ) rather than intentionally navigating their future. As noted by Evans & Reid (2014 , p. 36), some strands of the resilience discourse support survival-of-the-fittest narratives, turning historical dynamics into a win–lose game in which either one is resilient (success) or one collapses (failure) (see also McAnany & Yoffee 2010 , p. 14). The resilience discourse works within a capitalist model, whereas there are other scenarios of political economy that could also be accounted for. Within capitalist models, societal success or failure is a matter of choice ( Diamond 2005 , p. 221) or decision-making ( Redman 2012 , p. 241) and, hence, comes down to the willingness of societies to transform independently of their political conditions and internal societal dispositions and incentives (see Bollig 2014 for a critique). In this sense, resilience thinking embraces concepts of governmentality ( Olsson et al. 2015 , Walker & Cooper 2018 ) and technopolitical regimes ( Taylor 1988 ) that direct responsibility away from governments to the self-correcting processes of communities. Moreover, much of the resilience discourse silences questions of political economies, the historical production of unequal exposures to climate change, and sociopolitical vulnerabilities (e.g., Ekblom 2012 , Kok et al. 2016 , Weiberg & Finné 2018 ), questions that archaeology seems particularly capable of addressing.

Section: 4. NEW TRANSLATIONS OF RESILIENCE THINKING IN ARCHAEOLOGY

The key challenge, then, if we are to unfold new translations of resilience, is to move to bring in the more-than-human constructedness of the landscape from the very beginning, unfolding “thick” deep-time landscape histories that exceed the “thinness” of systems ontology. As we attempt this task, we can draw on a series of intellectual discourses and useful concepts that are already established. These include alternative philosophies of time and the multispecies as well as the concepts of niche construction theory, landesque capital, and adaptive capacities—all of which build on core concerns of resilience and intergenerational persistence but which archaeologists could use to develop future translations of resilience theory.
One strand of research addresses how more-than-humans carve out niches that make landscapes livable and persistent ( Odling-Smee 2007 , Laland & O'Brien 2010 , Laland et al. 2014 ). Niche construction emphasizes the relentless cocreation of anthropological and nonhuman domains. Even though the application of engineering in archaeological resilience thinking has so far been very human-focused, all organisms engineer their surroundings. The constructed nature of the niche emphasizes the cumulative nature of more-than-human relationships. Niches do not simply develop in complexity until they collapse; rather, they tend to shore up social, biogeochemical, and morphological relations to produce an environment that is bequeathed to future generations. In addition, niches generate long-term inter- and supragenerational effects in terms of cultural transmission and inheritance, social memory, and the passing on of already altered environments ( van Dooren 2014 , p. 29). In this way, both humans and nonhumans navigate in biosocial environments that are inherited. With this approach, resilience cannot be boiled down to quantitative evaluations of environmental factors applied to social systems, and it is no longer an abstract characteristic of an isolated ecosystem concept. In its most essential capacity, it is a multispecies achievement—and one of persistent relations. Moreover, we can begin to study how human/more-than-human niches—not just ecosystems or production models—might be transported to new areas, subject to climate change, stress, or radical transformation.
One circle of scholars has taken up this track, pointing to the contribution that archaeology can make to approaching long-term alterations of niches and global Holocene and Anthropocene species distributions ( Boivin et al. 2016 , Fox et al. 2017 , Brewer & Riede 2018 , Ellis et al. 2018 ). Petraglia et al. (2020) show how Mesopotamian societies with developed oasis water management systems survived through the 4.2–4.0 ka bp drought, not because of any well-designed system, but because a niche that afforded buffers in the encounter with otherwise catastrophic events was maintained over the long term and hence allowed people to adapt. Other studies stress that the distributed capacity of resilience also involves forms of organization based on sustained principles of collective access or governance ( Ostrom 1990 , Oosthuizen 2016 , Hütten 2018 , Lagerås & Magnell 2020 ). For example, Thompson et al. (2020) studied Native American oyster harvesting along the US Atlantic coast over a 5-ka span and showed that even though significant population fluctuations were associated with the size of the oysters and the species composition of the reefs, the niche appeared highly resilient in the sense that, in spite of fishery disruptions, changes in harvesting practices, competition, and estuarine and marine habitats, it remained persistent across the long term. Thompson et al. speculate that this continuity may be related to equally persistent, collectively governed harvesting territories.
Related studies focus specifically on niches that thrive on, or are held together by, evolved anthropogenic disturbances. Examples include the Western Desert of Australia ( Gould 1971 ), the Japanese matsutake forests ( Tsing 2015 ), the Pacific Northwest's “forest gardens” ( Armstrong et al. 2021 ), the tallgrass prairie of the US Midwest ( Kimmerer & Lake 2001 ), the Western Desert of Australia ( Bliege Bird et al. 2020 ), the wet grasslands of Vattenrike in southern Sweden ( Manton et al. 2016 ), and the Northern European heathlands ( Kaland 2014 , Løvschal 2021 ). These landscapes have persisted through sustained institutionalized practices of disturbance in the form of, e.g., grazing or fire. In fact, in these cases, disturbances play a vital integrative role in resilience ( Seidl et al. 2014 ), forming part of wider regenerative and interactive (rather than reactive) dynamics. Hence, disturbance ecologies teach us the important lesson that the very definition of a disturbance depends on the ecocultural entanglements in question and their sensitivities toward them: Not all events will count as a transformative shock or build up to a tipping point. Disturbance ecologies also point to the limits of feasible and possible options and preestablishes a particular quasi-trajectory ( Løvschal 2020 ). For example, in the case of the Northern European anthropogenic heathlands, the long-term governance of a persistent repertoire of extraction practices ( Christiansen 2001 ) that directed nutrients away from the heathlands and into settlements, fields, and funerary structures created a domesticated niche of inherited geological historicity and practices pertaining to soil fertility and modified rejuvenation cycles—one that entrapped both humans and heathlands in mutual deep-time dependencies that restrained alternative landscapes. The more locked in and stable a system is, the less flexible it is, and hence the less likely it is to be capable of adapting to changing conditions and pertubations.
Another aspect of resilience is that of adaptive capacity, which is used to specify the abilities pertaining to societies’ adaptational strategies and pathways in terms of the creation of irrigation or rotation systems or the transition to new or larger crop ranges ( Carpenter et al. 2001 , pp. 766, 778; Sulas & Pikirayi 2018 , pp. 5ff). Whereas resilience is fundamentally conceived as a systems property, adaptive capacity shifts the focus to social and technical skills, land-use forms, and food sources. In this sense, adaptive capacity emphasizes the political and praxiographic aspects of resilience building ( Van de Noort 2013 ; Torrence 2016 , p. 7). Flohr et al. (2015) studied the impact of climate deterioration events at 9.2 ka bp and 8.2 ka bp on Asian societies. They compared 14 C dates against the two cooling events in regional summed probability plots ( Flohr et al. 2015 , figure 5) and found no evidence of associated site abandonment. Instead, they suggest that these communities had already increased their adaptive capacity locally, for instance by developing storage facilities and resource diversification, and were therefore able to absorb the disturbance. A similar emphasis on how resilience is tied to connectedness and cooperation is emphasized by Torrence's (2016) study of volcanic events on Papua New Guinea, across a 40-ka span. Torrence shows how, following extreme events, continuity is demonstrable in the form of lifestyle persistence, technological consistency, and reoccupation. He ascribes this continuity to group memory and long-distance social networks that ensured the movement of obsidian.
Another potential trajectory lies at the heart of the disciplines of archaeology and philosophy. It has to do with deep-time landscape histories and forms of time that may uncover what resilience might be, if change is not considered a stepwise and catastrophic event. The world is made of a myriad of alternative temporal dynamics to account for historical change to those implicit in the adaptive cycle. There are quasi-events ( Povinelli 2016 , p. 21ff) and quasi-trajectories ( Løvschal 2020 ), traces ( Crossland 2018 ), extinction and “double deaths” ( Rose 2004 ), rhythms [ Lefebvre 2004 (1992) ], vibrations ( Bergson 1920 ), and sediments ( Koselleck 2018 ). Such reorientations of time offer alternative vocabularies that can capture new dimensions of resilience, rather than relying so heavily on ecology-derived models of how change comes about.
Archaeology could play a much more active role in evoking radically different time dynamics of deep-time persistence than those associated with the adaptive cycle—time dynamics that are not attached to midcentury enlightenment theories. And by, for example, exploring how different subdomains may be differentially susceptible to change ( Bollig 2014 ) or defining different chronotypes of resilience in relation to deep-time intergenerational temporalities, we may be able to analyze the dynamics between them. Fostering short-term resilience, for instance, might have serious ramifications for the long-term resilience of the same system. Even more importantly, archaeology may also outline new intellectual horizons of persistence thinking and how long-term persistence was achieved in the past in the absence of catastrophic shifts.
This approach is also capable of capturing temporalities of change that were not directly planned by humans, such as legacy effects, resonance, and persistence, whereby prior technologies and material practices continue to resonate and provoke further (re)actions. Olivier (2011) and Hamilakis (2011) propose that we are constantly surrounded by multichronologies, meaning that we have to live with the material remains and resonance of the past. Related concepts of the long-term dimension of landscape constructedness include the notion of landesque capital ( Håkansson & Widgren 2014 ) as an enduring modification, with soils becoming an inherited resource. Examples might include raised agricultural fields and “dark earths” in the Amazonian ( Maezumi et al. 2018 , de Souza et al. 2018 ), the embanked and terraced fields of Northern Europe ( Løvschal 2020 , Løvschal et al. 2021 ), and garden manuring on Neolithic Orkney ( Dockrill & Bond 2009 ). Landesque capital resonates with concepts of niche construction and adaptive capacity in the sense that such modifications reflect intergenerational landscape practices, increasing their adaptive capacity and hence resilience.
Other related strands of research from critical theory, feminist posthumanities, and ecofeminism embrace the socioecological complexities of resilience more fully ( Plumwood 1993 ; Margulis & Sagan 2002 ; Latour 2004 , 2017 ; Haraway 2008 , 2016 ; Kirksey & Helmreich 2010 ; Kohn 2013 ; Gilbert et al. 2015 ; Tsing 2015 , 2017 ). Multispecies research insists on the interweaving of ecocultural dimensions through forms of multispecies entanglements and becomings. Genes, cells, microbes, fungi and plant communities, soils, and mammals all contribute to resilience building. This kind of approach leads us to recognize the criticality of nonintended outcomes—as well as the general difficulty of engineering resilience—precisely because most areas are not under strict human control. As a counter to the anthropocentric orientation of approaches that see resilience as an essential property of human systems, resilience could be approached as a distributed property of multispecies configurations, a multispecies affair and achievement ( Haraway 2008 ). Moreover, “symmetrical archaeology” offers a complementary way of bringing materiality into such relational ontologies ( Shanks 2007 , Witmore 2007 ).
A small but growing group of archaeological scholars have worked explicitly with multispecies ( Overton & Hamilakis 2013 , Boyd 2018 , Goldhahn 2019 , Hussain 2019 , Kveiborg et al. 2020 ). To date, their work awaits integration into larger syntheses pertaining to, for instance, the agricultural revolution. There is therefore substantial potential in further developing the integration of archaeological deep-time perspectives and material approaches in the multispecies. This work may help unfold how multispecies relations come into being and change across generations, creating different conditions for resilience.
One strand of research addresses how more-than-humans carve out niches that make landscapes livable and persistent ( Odling-Smee 2007 , Laland & O'Brien 2010 , Laland et al. 2014 ).

Section: 5. CONCLUSION

In the Anthropocene epoch, the systemic human impact on geological processes and ecologies is initiating incalculable, planetary, long-term cascade effects and constrained trajectories as species become extinct and cultural heritage is destroyed permanently ( Steffen et al. 2018 ). The human impact on landscapes is now so pervasive that it is penetrating deep-time geological sediments: Plastic is not only a new geological marker of our time, but also cropping up in terrestrial and archaeological deposits ( Mytum & Meek 2021 ) as well as altering our understanding of the deep past ( Lund & Sindbæk 2022 ). Hence, resilience conceptualizations are clearly needed to embrace sensitivities to persistence and change within much deeper frameworks than those of the natural sciences ( Conolly & Lane 2018 ).
However, where resilience thinking currently falls apart is in its inability to account for systemic inequalities produced by global industrial capitalism, and for historically produced asymmetries between more-than-human social worlds, and in its heavy reliance on mid-twentieth-century ecological approaches to systemic change. These are approaches that we need to push past and move beyond.
I have argued here that we need to retain the core concerns of resilience thinking but translate them into new approaches and that archaeological research can play a central role in this exploratory advancement. Archaeological cases can show the breadth of variation in adaptive capacities and mitigation strategies; they can help to promote a more reflective use of the concept of history, of material conditions, of predispositions, and of the wider schemes of political economy within which these strategies exist. These are the historical processes that lead more-than-humans to form relations and create niches that, from a long-term perspective, build up landesque capital, both evoking a beneficial persistence and also—unintentionally—constraining their own options through time. New translations of the coupling between resilience thinking and archaeology have immense potential to contribute to a better understanding of the long-term paths and entrapments that make up the Anthropocene and, consequently, of the historical scope for resilience in the present day and to help shed light on why we find it so difficult to change our current ways of making social worlds.
