Section: ABSTRACT

Fleeing violence, poverty, abuse, war, and climatic change, tens of millions of people have fled their homes in the Global South seeking refuge in adjacent nations and in the Global North. This modern migration entails a material, sensual experience in time. The craft of archaeology has traditionally engaged with the material, the sensual, and the temporal. Archaeologists who study the materiality of modern undocumented migration embrace activist-engaged research that applies the craft of archaeology to the contemporary world. They study the materiality of migration to reveal and comprehend the lived experience of displaced persons. They seek to understand the barriers erected to that journey, the things migrants acquire and leave on the trail, migrant placemaking, their stranded lives, how they build new lives, what the migrants have left behind in their home countries, and the heritage of forced migration. They approach this work in critical solidarity with displaced peoples.

Section: INTRODUCTION

Globally, people are fleeing violence, poverty, want, abuse, war, and harmful climatic events. Tens of millions have left the Global South to seek refuge in Europe, Australia, the United States, and other nations. Undocumented migration from the Global South to the Global North is not new, but the number of displaced persons has soared into the millions. We must look back to the displacement of people during the Second World War and the collapse of empires that followed to find comparable migrations. The nations of the Global North have passed legislation, erected barriers, and fielded agents to deter the movement of undocumented migrants and refugees ( Besteman 2019 ). Displaced persons cross continents, pay thousands of dollars, walk through blistering deserts, and float in storm-tossed seas. Tens of thousands have died; thousands end up in squalid detention centers. Some make it to their destinations where they live in hiding from deportation. Populist politicians dehumanize migrants and refugees, calling them criminals and deadbeats who invade the Global North to rob, murder, rape, and steal jobs from citizens. These fears drive the political process and breed racism, hate, and violence.
Archaeologists appreciate that migration entails a material, sensual experience in time. The craft of archaeology has traditionally engaged with the material, the sensual, and the temporal. Thus, we can use archaeological methods to study and understand modern migration ( Hamilakis 2018 ). Other disciplines have barely addressed the materiality, sensorial experience, and mnemonic aspects of modern migration, leaving a gap for archaeologists to fill. Some archaeologists have engaged with migration studies in various disciplines to try to develop a unifying theory of ancient and contemporary migrations ( Baker & Tsuda 2015 , Trabert 2020 ). Others have followed the lead of refugee and forced migration studies ( Fiddian-Qasmiyeh et al. 2014 ) to engage with modern migrations as a humanitarian crisis and to seek social justice for displaced persons ( De León 2015 , Hamilakis 2018 , Soto 2018a , McGuire & Van Dyke 2019 ).
Archaeologists who study the materiality of modern forced migration embrace engaged research that applies the craft of archaeology to the contemporary world. They study the materiality of migration to reveal and comprehend the lived experience of displaced persons. They seek to understand the barriers erected to that journey, the things that migrants acquire and leave on the trail, their stranded lives, how they build new lives, what the migrants leave behind in their home countries, and the heritage of forced migration ( Basu & Coleman 2008 ).

Section: MODERN FORCED MIGRATION

Forced migration entails the movement of displaced peoples. The International Organization for Migration ( 2020 ) defines displacement as “[t]he movement of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters.”
Refugees International identifies 70.8 million displaced people (both internally and internationally displaced) in today's world ( Refug. Int. 2019 ). This number greatly exceeds the number of refugees in Europe following World War II [11 million ( Wyman 1998 )] and the number in the Partition of India in 1947 [14 million ( Riggs & Jat 2018 )]. In the first two decades of the twenty-first century, more than six million undocumented migrants attempted to cross the US–México border ( Undocumented Migrant Project 2019 ). The “refugee and migrant crisis” began in Europe in 2015 when millions of displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa tried to enter European Union countries ( Migr. Data Portal 2019b ).
The journey to the Global North is perilous. Migrants and refugees entering the United States have to cross deserts and/or the Río Grande. The US Border Patrol ( 2019 ) reported 7,505 migrant deaths along the US southern border in the previous decade. Between 2014 and 2019, more than 19,000 migrants disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea ( Migr. Data Portal 2019a ). In both of these cases, the numbers must represent a fraction of the sum total of people who died. Many bodies go unrecovered in the vast, inhospitable stretches of desert along the US–México border ( Beck et al. 2015 ). Recently, CNN has criticized the US Border Patrol for incomplete estimates that failed to record hundreds of individuals ( Ortega 2018 ). Likewise, the true number of people lost in the Mediterranean Sea will never be known.
The statistics are overwhelming, but these statistics do not reveal the lived experience of displaced individuals and families. Indeed, statistical analysis tends to reinforce the idea that this situation is a border security crisis when, in fact, it is a humanitarian crisis. To understand it as a humanitarian crisis, we need to humanize the lived experience of the migrants and refugees. Archaeology speaks directly to that lived reality by studying the materiality of displacement. This materiality is both a product of lived experience and part of the process shaping that experience ( Soto 2018a ).

Section: HOW AND WHY DID ARCHAEOLOGISTS BEGIN STUDYING CONTEMPORARY MIGRATION?

Archaeologists have long studied ancient migration. Some use modern migration to create analogies for understanding past migration, while some argue that we can develop understandings that transcend the ancient and the modern phenomena. More recently, activist archaeologists seek to directly engage the current phenomena. Two interrelated trends at the turn of the twenty-first century led to this activism: ( a ) Archaeologists argued for an engaged, activist scholarship ( McGuire 2008 , Atalay et al. 2014 ), and ( b ) researchers elaborated an archaeology of the contemporary ( González-Ruibal 2019 ).
Some archaeologists see contemporary migration as a recent manifestation of longer-term processes of human movement ( VanValkenburgh 2018 , Trabert 2020 ). Baker & Tsuda (2015) maintain that archaeologists can develop a unified theory of migration that applies in all times and places. They study the disruptions that motivate migration and the disruptions that result from migration as the keys to a unifying theory. The Coalition for Archaeological Synthesis (CfAS) has scheduled academic sessions
to develop long-term, comparative and synthetic understandings of the factors stimulating human migration, the conditions and processes implicated in the success of the incorporation of immigrant groups at their destination, and how these new understandings might inform contemporary public policy. ( CfAS 2019 )

Despite these efforts, the majority of archaeologists studying modern migration do not pursue a unified theory ( Anthony 1997 , Burmeister 2000 , Bender 2001 , Hakenbeck 2008 ). Many worry that the emphasis on abstractions inferred from deep time and universal processes will only exacerbate the dehumanization of modern migrants and refugees. A unified theory does not lend itself to truly getting at the lived experience, nuance, and angst of contemporary forced migration around the globe. Archaeologists studying lived experience see forced migration as a contemporary reality and seek social justice. Caraher & Rothaus (2016) call the study of lived experience an “archaeology of care.” Their archaeology springs not from an academic desire to create a universal theory of migration but rather from an attention to detail and to the personal experiences of living people. They argue that, through caring, archaeologists can create a connection between displaced persons and the wider world.
This emphasis on the political originated in the twilight of the twentieth century. Critical archaeologists argued that our research into the past is also sociopolitical action in the present ( Fernandez 2006 ). These included post-processual scholars ( Tilley 1989 ), feminists ( Gero & Conkey 1991 ), Marxists ( McGuire 1992 ), Indigenous archaeologists ( Watkins 2000 ), and Queer theorists ( Schmidt & Voss 2000 ). These scholars accepted that archaeology cannot transform capitalism, or end war, or mitigate global inequality. They argued, however, that archaeological research can affect contemporary politics. They believed that a theoretically informed and politically grounded archaeology might make a difference in peoples’ lives and could contribute to creating a more humane world. They saw archaeologists as intellectuals who produce narratives and, as such, should take responsibility for the privilege of being able to engage directly with the material past and to write stories about it ( Hamilakis 1999 ). By the first decade of the twenty-first century, many researchers realized that archaeology could be a form of sociopolitical action in the present ( McGuire 2008 , Schiffer 2017 ).
The archaeology of modern migrations also participates in an archaeology of the present-day world. In the 1980s, behavioral archaeologists initiated an archaeology of the contemporary ( Gould & Schiffer 1981 , Rathje & Murphy 1992 ), and in the twenty-first century, it has reemerged as an ever-increasing research practice.
Archaeologists of the contemporary examine the dynamics of materiality and the corporeal experience of modern life ( Graves-Brown et al. 2013 , González-Ruibal 2019 ). Archaeologists dig to make the invisible visible. Excavation also trains the archaeologist to be skeptical of the surface appearance of things, to look carefully behind the façade, to pay close attention to context, and to place events in diachronic perspective ( Voss 2010 , p. 189). Archaeologists have devised nondiscursive techniques and methods to understand the human condition through the study of mute, ancient artifacts. Archaeologists of the contemporary integrate these techniques with history and ethnography to provide a distinctive perspective on today's world. They study the modern landscape as material process. They use archaeological techniques to find patterns in the apparent pandemonium of the contemporary material world. Patterns reveal the complex relationship that the material shares with social relations, meaning, and agency.
The lived experience of material process occurs in a dialectic between the material world and conscious human action. Humans fashion objects, but once in existence, things in turn affect human consciousness and agency. Things simultaneously constrain and enable possible human action. Thus, human agency both transforms materiality and is transformed by the material.
When activist archaeologists encountered modern forced migration, they took up the tools of archaeology to engage it. Soto (G. Soto, personal communication) grew up in southern Arizona, where her father owned a small construction company doing work near the border. While visiting him, she came into contact with the things migrants had left behind, and in Tucson, she participated in humanitarian efforts. De León (2012b) worked on an excavation in Tlaxcala, México. There he met Victor who had entered the United States without documents and had then been deported back to México. Victor's story intrigued De León and inspired him to study the archaeology of contemporary migration. Kiddey did her dissertation on the contemporary archaeology of homelessness in Great Britain (R. Kiddey, personal communication). While visiting Greece, she realized the parallels between the experiences of displaced persons and those of the homeless. Two of the most important places for contemporary forced migration have been in the southwest United States and in Greece. By coincidence, these are also two of the most intensively researched archaeological regions in the world. Archaeologists including Hamilakis and Kourelis in Greece and myself in the Sonoran Desert observed the inhumanity of forced migration swirling around our excavations (Y. Hamilakis & K. Kourelis, personal communication; McGuire 2018 ).

Section: WHAT DOES ARCHAEOLOGY TELL US ABOUT MODERN FORCED MIGRATION?

The material and sensual experiences of forced migration lend themselves to archaeological analysis. Archaeologists reveal the ignored, forgotten, and deliberately concealed aspects of migrants’ lived experience. In doing so, they expose both suffering and how people claim dignity and justice ( VanValkenburgh 2018 , p. 231). Exposing and publicizing this experience humanizes migrants and refugees as people who if pricked will bleed and if tickled will laugh. Making migrants human helps local communities accommodate and understand migrants and their experience.
The key to all archaeological analyses lies in the relationship of objects, people, and landscapes. Archaeologists ask, what significance do people give to possessions? The material also supplies a mnemonic that assists with remembering and understanding the experience of forced migration ( Harrison et al. 2018 , p. 211). Landscape is the medium of meaning and action; acts of uprooting from, passing through, and landing in different landscapes are an essential part of this story. Archaeologists take on great responsibility when they study the material and sensual experiences of forced migration. Archaeological study raises important ethical concerns.
An archaeology of forced migration begins with the relationships among things and migrants. Archaeologists focus on both the affective and generative capacities of things and their representational politics ( Harrison et al. 2018 , p. 210). These relationships reveal what migrants and refugees carry with them, what they need during their journeys, and how they make a new life in a foreign place. These relationships go beyond the practical needs of life because they include objects that link migrants to their homes. As Caraher (2015) states, “We care about this connection between an individual and an object. It's what we do.” Archaeology valorizes the objects and the material, lived experience of migrants and refugees as things worthy of collection, study, and curation ( Hamilakis 2018 ).
Placemaking refers to how people transform spaces into places that they inhabit and with which they identify. People use materials in placemaking, and it is the interactions among objects and people that create and transform places. Migrants leave places (their homes), enter into a state of placelessness, and hopefully define new places in their destinations. During their journey, migrants enter into what Augé (1995) calls “nonplaces,” that is spaces that people pass through but do not reside in. Placemaking is difficult when placelessness or nonplaces in the supermodernity of contemporary life dominate peoples’ lives ( Caraher 2017 ). Archaeologists seek to understand the nature and reality of this experience by studying how migrants build history and create a sense of place in the nonplaces ( Soto 2018c ).
Things are a powerful mnemonic to help people remember and understand the experience of migration. For example, consider the Undocumented Migrant Project's (2019) exhibit Hostile Terrain 94. The title refers to the US government's 1994 Prevention Through Deterrence policy. Under this policy, the US Border Patrol forces migrants away from cities into the hostile terrain of the Sonoran Desert. In the desert, they are in mortal danger and are easier to capture than in crowded cities. This weaponization of the landscape hides the culpability of US policy. The exhibit consists of a 25-foot-long map of the Arizona/México border with 3,200 handwritten toe tags pinned to the map. Each tag represents someone who died crossing the US/México border between 1994 and 2019. The most powerful participatory element of this project involves the time and effort required of volunteers to meticulously fill out the 3,200 individual toe tag cards. These tags include the name, age, sex, cause of death, condition of body, and location of recovery for each person. The toe tags mark the migrants as individual people and personalize a larger map of the dead.
The fundamental ethical dilemma that faces us is, an archaeology of modern migration for whom? Two tropes dominate the discussions of contemporary migrations: the victim–humanitarianism trope and the criminalization–militarization trope. Hamilakis (2018 , p. 3) urges us to reject and abandon both of these tropes. They both treat the displaced person as an object, specifically an object to be pitied or an object to be feared. Archaeology's focus on material things and time provides us a means to discard these tropes. Such studies, however, still bear the dangers of scholarship for the sake of the scholar and of making “refugee porn” replete with shocking photographs and sensationalized text ( Hamilakis 2018 , p. 14).
Alternatively, archaeologists can work in critical solidarity with migrants and refugees and use our craft to better understand how displaced persons interpret and fashion their own history. This approach is called the “autonomy of migration” ( Casas-Cortes et al. 2015 ). It focuses not on apparatuses of state control but rather on how the migrants respond to, operate independently from, and in turn shape the migration experience. To do this work, we must first recognize that migrants exercise social and political agency and that this agency can be transformative of them and of others. Their agency sparks change in the places they leave behind, the places that they pass through, and the places where they arrive. As scholars, we may ally ourselves with the migrants and refugees. Instead of offering pity or charity, we should offer understanding, support, and critical solidarity. We can also use our privilege and access to the institutions (universities, schools, museums, etc.) of the Global North to assist contemporary migrants and refugees in their struggle for social justice.
An activist archaeology that engages the materiality and heritage of contemporary forced migration strives to avoid exploiting the phenomena for purely academic purposes and eschews making often painful and tragic experiences artistically pleasing ( Hamilakis 2018 ). An archaeology in critical solidarity with the border crossers cannot simply adopt objectifying principles to look for unifying, universal theories. It cannot unequivocally embrace archaeological methods such as the current fad for big data that distances the archaeologists from the phenomena of forced migration and reduces the lived experience of individuals to data points. Hamilakis (2018 , p. 14) fears that an objectifying and universalizing approach to the archaeology of forced migration risks becoming the heritage branch of the border control agencies. He and others call for a transformative, politically aware archaeology ( Tilley 1989 , Gero & Conkey 1991 , Watkins 2000 , Fernandez 2006 , McGuire 2008 , Voss 2010 , Schiffer 2017 , González-Ruibal 2019 ).

Section: ARCHAEOLOGIES OF FORCED MIGRATION

Archaeologists studying contemporary forced migration focus on the experience of displaced persons in landscapes and seascapes. The analysis of landscapes has long been a mainstay of archaeology, and this analysis applies to the landscapes and seascapes that migrants and refugees must cross. They carry things with them, and they leave things as they pass. Many displaced persons find their lives stranded in camps and detention centers. They seek to make a new life at their destinations, and they leave empty places behind them. Finally, they live history and create heritage. In each of these topics, archaeology brings distinct methods and insights to understand and engage with the lived experience of forced migration.
Modern migration entails movement through space and a kinesthetic experience of landscapes and seascapes. Contemporary archaeologists have excelled in the study of landscapes/seascapes as kinesthetic, emotive, and corporeal experiences. Archaeological studies of landscape treat places and spaces as dynamic participants in the lived experience of people ( Branton 2009 , p. 51). The migrant's movement and interaction with landscapes and seascapes are fraught with danger and death ( Sheridan & McGuire 2019 ).
States militarize their borders to channel migrants into hostile terrains. State policies intentionally put migrants at risk and make these “scapes” material agents of violence. Nation-states erect walls and other barriers to hinder and channel the flow of migrants ( Soto 2018a , McAtackney & McGuire 2020 ). In addition to archaeologists, geographers ( Dear 2013 , Vallet 2014 , Jones 2016 ) and cultural anthropologists ( Jusionyte 2018 , Han & Antrosio 2019 , Díaz-Barriga & Dorsey 2020 ) have studied these barriers. Archaeologists analyze these barriers as a dynamic assemblage with three parts: the neoliberal state, the material wall, and the human bodies of those who attempt to move across the barriers ( McGuire 2013 , McGuire & Van Dyke 2019 ). This analysis allows them to demonstrate how the state materializes the difference between citizens and displaced persons, how the bodily experience of crossing differs for each, and how people protest and transgress the barriers.
Migrants and refugees move through a landscape leaving intentional marks of their passing that create physical and emotional points of reference. States and humanitarian aid groups also mark the migrants’ routes. Soto (2016 , 2018c ) discusses how migrants use graffiti and shrines in placemaking during transient moments of placelessness in the Sonoran Desert. Obradovic-Wochnik & Bird (2019) walked the Balkan Route through Europe where they recorded posters, signs, directions, notices, flyers, and maps produced by state authorities and volunteer-led aid networks. They analyzed how these seemingly banal notices govern space and are implicated in acts of bordering and its resistance.
Migrants carry and use distinctive material cultures. These things both reflect and shape ways of being specific to the particular migration process ( Crow 2013 ). This material culture helps migrants to navigate the disorienting, transient, threatening, and complex processes into which they enter ( Grabowska & Doering-White 2016 ). Many items are essential for survival such as water jugs in the desert ( De León 2012a ) and life jackets in the Mediterranean Sea ( Tyrikos-Ergas 2018 ). Other items help make places in a state of placelessness ( Kourelis 2018 ); some items embody the personal and familial ( Stewart et al. 2018 ); and all are tangible artifacts of struggle, persistence, and agency ( Lee 2019 ).
Since 2009, De León's (2015) Undocumented Migrant Project (UMP) has used archaeology, ethnography, and forensics to examine the dynamic interactions of migrants, material culture, and the landscape of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. The UMP seeks to understand how undocumented migrants covertly cross the desert, the socioeconomic relations that structure the process, and the various forms of suffering and violence (including death) that the migrants experience. The UMP examines the distinct experiences of migrant subpopulations (e.g., women, children, LGBT, non-Mexican nationals) and the evolving material culture associated with crossing. UMP research shows that the US Prevention Through Deterrence policy has failed to deter migration but has succeeded in shaping border crossing into a well-organized and violent social process with a unique set of material culture and technologies ( De León 2015 ). More recently, De León (2019) has conducted research in Palenque on the México–Guatemala border.
The project uses archaeological methods to collect and analyze migrant artifacts to gain insight into the ways that border crossers interact with the desert. The UMP has done archaeological surveys to locate migrant stations (lay-up camps) where people paused on their journey. The archaeologists systematically collected the objects left behind and recorded the makeshift architecture of the camps ( Crow 2013 , Gokee & De León 2014 , De León et al. 2015b , Grabowska 2016 , Grabowska & Doering-White 2016 ). Researchers employed use wear analysis to find material evidence, such as holes worn in shoes, of the suffering and misery that crossers endure ( De León 2013 , De León et al. 2015a ).
Archaeological data collected along the migrant trails demonstrate the routinized techniques and tools associated with the violent process of border crossing and the dialectical and often oppressive relationship that exists between migrants and objects. UMP's research reveals a well-established social process in which migrants have adapted dark clothes, shag carpet slippers over their shoes, and black water bottles as tools for subterfuge. Shag carpet slippers obliterate foot prints but make walking harder. Black water bottles do not gleam in the light but water in them gets hotter and is less refreshing ( Soto 2018a , p. 124).
Soto (2018b) discusses some of the tensions that the UMP's method of systematic and total collection of migrant artifacts evoked for some of her local interlocutors. She argues that researchers need to acknowledge the complex set of relations and affects related to these migrant objects, even beyond deposition. Treating these objects as purely functional, or as if meaning/interpretative value ends at deposition, forecloses these social relationships and the wider afterlife behind these objects that can be political and inspirational and result in action. Encounters with such objects by nonmigrants inspires a range of potent negotiations, even within the context of clean-ups. In an active contemporary struggle field, these negotiations form part of the social lives of these objects. She worries that the UMP and others ( Squire 2014 ) have been overly dismissive of these postdepositional processes.
UMP asks how migrants and refugees die in the desert and studies the taphonomy of the bodies. They did forensic research with the bodies of dead pigs and discovered that desert scavengers would destroy the body in a couple of weeks or less. Beck and colleagues (2014; De León 2015 , pp. 62–84) conclude that the killing desert allows the US government to carry out multiple forms of state-crafted violence against migrants while the environment simultaneously obscures culpability and erases material traces of brutality. The US government has turned the desert into an agent of state-sanctioned violence.
Sometimes, on the US–México border, especially in Texas, local officials recover and bury the remains of migrants without attempting to identify the individuals or adding to counts of the dead. Spradley at Texas State University uses bioarchaeological and forensic methods to recover the remains of these migrants, identify them, and return them to their families ( Anderson & Spradley 2016 ).
Migrants are not the only ones to drop things in the desert. Humanitarian groups like No More Deaths leave out jugs of water, canned food, and other items ( Figure 1 ). Radziwinowiczówna (2018) examines the materiality of US Border Patrol's capture of undocumented migrants. She proposes that before a migrant can be deported, agents of the state must detect, seize, control, and catalog his/her body. She discusses how the migrants bodily experience the material things such as guns, chains, handcuffs, uniforms, or syringes that US Border Patrol uses to accomplish these goals.

Migrants crossing from Asia and Africa into Europe face distinct obstacles and dangers. These crossings require a very different material culture of migrant life. Following the migrant crisis of 2015, thousands of bright orange life jackets covered the beaches of the Greek island of Lesvos, and the locals stacked them into great piles ( Tyrikos-Ergas 2018 ). Each life jacket had participated in the lived experience of a migrant who crossed the Mediterranean Sea, and as refuse on the beaches, they interacted with the local population that had received the migrants.
From 2015 to 2016, as sea and land routes became more difficult and dangerous across the Mediterranean and through the Balkans, many migrants forged the Arctic Route across Russia into Finland and the European Union. The migrants often pooled their money to buy cheap, broken down cars in Russia that they drove to, and abandoned on, the Finnish border. Seitsonen et al. (2018) found that the abandoned vehicles and items left or forgotten inside them illustrated the lived experience of refugees on their risky trek through the frozen wilderness.
Although an excessive number of migrants die, many more migrants end up living in deportation centers, refugee camps, or squats (unofficial, clandestine or illegal dwellings). As migrants are stranded in these places, their lives stop; they cannot go forward or backward ( Kirtsoglou 2018 , pp. 225–28). Archaeological studies have focused on how even in these alienating contexts migrants use material things to engage in placemaking, to give meaning, and to regain control of their lives ( Dudley 2011 , p. 743; Kiddey 2019 ).
Scholars have examined the materiality of placemaking in a variety of refugee camps. Dudley (2011) studied the Karenni refugee camps on the Thailand–Burma border. She emphasized the importance in placemaking of producing and consuming things such as food and clothing. In Palestine, Butler & Al-Nammari (2018) found the same processes manifest in food and in a traditional women's embroidered dress called a thobe.
Tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and refugees have washed up on the shores of Greece, and thousands remain stranded there unable to move on. Archaeologists have focused on the Kara Tepe and Moria refugee camps on Lesvos ( Hamilakis 2016 , 2018 , 2019a ) and on alternative refugee shelters ( Kourelis 2018 , Kiddey 2019 ). These camps and alternative shelters contain a great diversity of refugees from the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. The diversity makes the material process of placemaking much more difficult in Greece. This is especially true with food where the officially provided food rations usually end up in the trash or as ingredients in home-cooked dishes ( Thomopoulos et al. 2018 , pp. 205–6; Hamilakis 2019a ). Occupants of the Greek refugee camps and migrants stranded in Athens also use art, poetry, song, and gardens in placemaking ( Arbelaez & Mulholland 2018 , Coelho 2018 , Thomopoulos et al. 2018 ). Kiddey (2019) compares and contrasts the material lived experience in alternative shelters in Athens that include temporary accommodations run by nongovernmental organizations and squats. She finds that refugees occupy empty buildings and adapt other materials in resourceful and creative ways that seek to retain pre-exile ways of life.
The largest and most famous refugee squat in Europe was the Calais Jungle (La Camp de la Lande) in France ( Agier et al. 2019 , Hicks & Mallet 2019 ). From January 2015 to October 2016, migrants and refugees seeking to cross the channel to the United Kingdom built and occupied the camp. At its peak, up to 10,000 people lived in tents and shacks in an illegal shanty town with grossly inadequate utilities, water, and sewage. French ethnographer Agier did an ethnographic study of the camp that includes detailed discussions of the camp's material and visual worlds and clear maps ( Agier et al. 2019 ). Archaeologists Hicks & Mallet (2019) focused on the dismantling of the Calais camp by authorities and the struggles to contest that disappearance.
The lucky and resourceful migrants and refugees make it to the Global North. Here they must engage in a new less transient placemaking. The places and people that they left behind must also engage in placemaking to heal the empty spaces that the migrants leave.
When undocumented migrants and refugees arrive in their destinations, they must adapt to a new environment that they may not have imagined (or incorrectly imagined) or desired. Forced migration breaks people's life plans; they lose family space and cultural context. Colomer (2013 , p. 18) examined the materiality of this placemaking among elderly Chilean political refugees who had fled to Sweden in the 1970s. They sought to maintain a cultural heritage and materialized loss and longing in their homes. Like forced migrants, the people who moved to the Bakken Oil Patch in North Dakota were driven into transient life ( Caraher et al. 2018 ). The mortgage crisis of 2008 pushed them out of their homes and into RV (recreational vehicle) camps, modular crew housing, and squatter camps. Caraher and colleagues’ (2018) archaeological study of these housing sites showed how the occupants succeeded and failed at placemaking. The Partition of India in 1947 displaced millions of people. Riggs (2020) has studied the housing provided by the Indian government for these refugees in New Delhi and how these landscapes developed over the subsequent 70 years. She found that post-Partition changes in Delhi's landscapes demonstrated that refugees who are accepted and provided with even minimal support can thrive.
The experience of modern migration creates empty spaces, both social and physical, in the places left behind. Miller (2008) analyzed what Caribbean migrants to the United Kingdom left behind. He concluded that individuals found themselves caught up in processes beyond their ability to act or control. This loss of agency happened because the migrants’ cultural aspirations suited their origins but had damaging consequences where they went. Riggs & Jat (2018) address the Partition of 1947 from the Pakistani side and the management of Hindu historic properties and out-migrants’ homes. They argue that the management of homes is just as seeded with political symbolism as is the management of historic monument spaces. Pistrick & Bachmeier (2018) took a camera to Albania where they photographed empty migrant bedrooms. Like department store window displays, they are too clean and well-ordered, lacking any evidence of being lived in. In all these examples, the materiality of absences is powerful.
Archaeological research collects lots of stuff. Are the things that displaced persons abandon still their property, or do they become the heritage of nation-states, or is all of this simply garbage ( Soto 2018a , b )? Usually archaeologists send the stuff that they collect to museums for curation. For a contemporary archaeology of modern forced migration to engage in political activism, it must interact with a larger public. Again, archaeologists traditionally do this work in museum displays, so we must ask what role museums should take in understanding forced migration.
The migrant things that archaeologists find in the desert, washed up on the beach and in a demolished camp, are intensely personal. They are the meager, treasured contents of the migrants’ bags ( Lee 2019 ). International Rescue Committee asked displaced persons fleeing to Europe to show “what's in my bag” ( Int. Rescue Comm. 2015 ). Each individual's possessions told a personal story about their past, their present, and their hopes for the future. A mother brought medicine to protect her baby, adults carried cell phones with pictures of family, children carried favorite snacks, and teenagers had personal care items. Nonmigrants can relate to the things in the bags; we can ask ourselves what we would take with us and what we would leave. In camps, displaced persons assemble cast-off goods to make their spaces more comfortable and engage in placemaking ( Hicks & Mallet 2019 ).
Hamilakis (2019b , p. 1376) and Soto (2018a ,b) raise ethical issues about these things. “Who owns these objects and who has the right to exhibit them and how?” Hamilakis (2018 , p. 13) notes that displaced persons might want to forget their experience and not be reminded by the material remains of it. Archaeologists tend to argue for the preservation and exhibition of the material remnants of migration as heritage and as political acts. Migrants may struggle with art, poetry, and song to create heritage from their own experiences ( Thomopoulos et al. 2018 ). As scholars, we must embrace the tension embodied in these questions.
Many citizens of the Global North regard as garbage the backpacks in the desert, the life jackets on the beach, and the smoldering piles of household goods in camps. They view material objects as environmental pollution brought by migrants and refugees who culturally pollute receiving societies. In Arizona, a public–private southern Arizona partnership seeks to remove migrant “trash” both to discourage crossers and to restore the wilderness character of the region for “legitimate” visitors ( Soto 2018b , p. 462). People sympathetic to the crossers tend to see the abandoned stuff as heritage in the making ( De León & Gokee 2019 , p. 71). De León (2015 , p. 171) notes that cleaning up migrant trash is a political act because it removes all traces of their existence from the desert, and Soto (2018b , p. 471) sees the archaeological remains of migration as inhabiting a politically charged dialectical space between trash and heritage. Many things have happened to the stuff that migrants leave behind. Most of it gets hauled away as trash, and some gets sold on eBay as “illegal immigrant artefacts” ( De León & Gokee 2019 , p. 72).
Some ends up in museum displays. From 2013 to 2017, the UMP exhibit State of Exception/Estado de Excepción toured the United States. At the Parsons School of Design, in New York City, it started with a video of a fast-flowing river projected across the gallery floor ( Cotter 2017 ). Visitors enter the show by walking over it, and the shuddering current makes them feel woozy. The exhibit consisted of migrant debris—cast-off clothing, backpacks, water bottles—a display of relics. The relics and the documents mounted a particularly powerful indictment of Prevention Through Deterrence. From April 27, 2019, to November 29, 2019, the Pitt Rivers Museum mounted a modest display on the Calais Jungle ( Hicks & Mallet 2019 , Hamilakis 2019b ). The exhibit included objects from the camp, photographs, and visual art, much of it made by people who lived in the camp. The combination of material and visual culture made the exhibit evocative ( Hamilakis 2019b , p. 1373). In February 2020, the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown University opened the exhibit “Transient Matter: Assemblages of Migration in the Mediterranean.” This exhibit includes border-crossing remnants, as well as art and objects made by migrants, in the effort to foreground their agency and personalize the tragedy of forced migration.
These exhibits raise the question of what role museums should have in the heritage of contemporary forced migration. Most museums have simply ignored contemporary migration processes. Schofield (2018 , p. 189) posits that as long as politicians and the general public hold mixed feelings about migrants and refugees, heritage institutions will intentionally avoid the controversial issue. Other museums have built exhibitions that distort and/or malign the migrant/refugee experience ( Labadi 2013 , 2018 ; Breene 2018 ; Byrne 2018 ). Should museums recognize the heritage of migrants, and should they treat the experience of migration as national heritage in the Global North ( Holtorf et al. 2019 )? Traditionally museums have participated in the colonial project by displaying the colonized other and by promoting national identity and citizenship. But more recently they have represented immigration and diversity ( Gouriévidis 2014 ; Levin 2016 ; Harrison et al. 2018 , pp. 211–13). This representation appears in a fast-growing body of research and critique on the complex issue of migration and museums ( Labadi 2018 ). This critique goes beyond representation to consider how museums may assist migrants in language training, employment, and volunteering.
Modern migration entails movement through space and a kinesthetic experience of landscapes and seascapes. Contemporary archaeologists have excelled in the study of landscapes/seascapes as kinesthetic, emotive, and corporeal experiences. Archaeological studies of landscape treat places and spaces as dynamic participants in the lived experience of people ( Branton 2009 , p. 51). The migrant's movement and interaction with landscapes and seascapes are fraught with danger and death ( Sheridan & McGuire 2019 ).
States militarize their borders to channel migrants into hostile terrains. State policies intentionally put migrants at risk and make these “scapes” material agents of violence. Nation-states erect walls and other barriers to hinder and channel the flow of migrants ( Soto 2018a , McAtackney & McGuire 2020 ). In addition to archaeologists, geographers ( Dear 2013 , Vallet 2014 , Jones 2016 ) and cultural anthropologists ( Jusionyte 2018 , Han & Antrosio 2019 , Díaz-Barriga & Dorsey 2020 ) have studied these barriers. Archaeologists analyze these barriers as a dynamic assemblage with three parts: the neoliberal state, the material wall, and the human bodies of those who attempt to move across the barriers ( McGuire 2013 , McGuire & Van Dyke 2019 ). This analysis allows them to demonstrate how the state materializes the difference between citizens and displaced persons, how the bodily experience of crossing differs for each, and how people protest and transgress the barriers.
Migrants and refugees move through a landscape leaving intentional marks of their passing that create physical and emotional points of reference. States and humanitarian aid groups also mark the migrants’ routes. Soto (2016 , 2018c ) discusses how migrants use graffiti and shrines in placemaking during transient moments of placelessness in the Sonoran Desert. Obradovic-Wochnik & Bird (2019) walked the Balkan Route through Europe where they recorded posters, signs, directions, notices, flyers, and maps produced by state authorities and volunteer-led aid networks. They analyzed how these seemingly banal notices govern space and are implicated in acts of bordering and its resistance.
Migrants carry and use distinctive material cultures. These things both reflect and shape ways of being specific to the particular migration process ( Crow 2013 ). This material culture helps migrants to navigate the disorienting, transient, threatening, and complex processes into which they enter ( Grabowska & Doering-White 2016 ). Many items are essential for survival such as water jugs in the desert ( De León 2012a ) and life jackets in the Mediterranean Sea ( Tyrikos-Ergas 2018 ). Other items help make places in a state of placelessness ( Kourelis 2018 ); some items embody the personal and familial ( Stewart et al. 2018 ); and all are tangible artifacts of struggle, persistence, and agency ( Lee 2019 ).
Since 2009, De León's (2015) Undocumented Migrant Project (UMP) has used archaeology, ethnography, and forensics to examine the dynamic interactions of migrants, material culture, and the landscape of Arizona's Sonoran Desert. The UMP seeks to understand how undocumented migrants covertly cross the desert, the socioeconomic relations that structure the process, and the various forms of suffering and violence (including death) that the migrants experience. The UMP examines the distinct experiences of migrant subpopulations (e.g., women, children, LGBT, non-Mexican nationals) and the evolving material culture associated with crossing. UMP research shows that the US Prevention Through Deterrence policy has failed to deter migration but has succeeded in shaping border crossing into a well-organized and violent social process with a unique set of material culture and technologies ( De León 2015 ). More recently, De León (2019) has conducted research in Palenque on the México–Guatemala border.
The project uses archaeological methods to collect and analyze migrant artifacts to gain insight into the ways that border crossers interact with the desert. The UMP has done archaeological surveys to locate migrant stations (lay-up camps) where people paused on their journey. The archaeologists systematically collected the objects left behind and recorded the makeshift architecture of the camps ( Crow 2013 , Gokee & De León 2014 , De León et al. 2015b , Grabowska 2016 , Grabowska & Doering-White 2016 ). Researchers employed use wear analysis to find material evidence, such as holes worn in shoes, of the suffering and misery that crossers endure ( De León 2013 , De León et al. 2015a ).
Archaeological data collected along the migrant trails demonstrate the routinized techniques and tools associated with the violent process of border crossing and the dialectical and often oppressive relationship that exists between migrants and objects. UMP's research reveals a well-established social process in which migrants have adapted dark clothes, shag carpet slippers over their shoes, and black water bottles as tools for subterfuge. Shag carpet slippers obliterate foot prints but make walking harder. Black water bottles do not gleam in the light but water in them gets hotter and is less refreshing ( Soto 2018a , p. 124).
Soto (2018b) discusses some of the tensions that the UMP's method of systematic and total collection of migrant artifacts evoked for some of her local interlocutors. She argues that researchers need to acknowledge the complex set of relations and affects related to these migrant objects, even beyond deposition. Treating these objects as purely functional, or as if meaning/interpretative value ends at deposition, forecloses these social relationships and the wider afterlife behind these objects that can be political and inspirational and result in action. Encounters with such objects by nonmigrants inspires a range of potent negotiations, even within the context of clean-ups. In an active contemporary struggle field, these negotiations form part of the social lives of these objects. She worries that the UMP and others ( Squire 2014 ) have been overly dismissive of these postdepositional processes.
UMP asks how migrants and refugees die in the desert and studies the taphonomy of the bodies. They did forensic research with the bodies of dead pigs and discovered that desert scavengers would destroy the body in a couple of weeks or less. Beck and colleagues (2014; De León 2015 , pp. 62–84) conclude that the killing desert allows the US government to carry out multiple forms of state-crafted violence against migrants while the environment simultaneously obscures culpability and erases material traces of brutality. The US government has turned the desert into an agent of state-sanctioned violence.
Sometimes, on the US–México border, especially in Texas, local officials recover and bury the remains of migrants without attempting to identify the individuals or adding to counts of the dead. Spradley at Texas State University uses bioarchaeological and forensic methods to recover the remains of these migrants, identify them, and return them to their families ( Anderson & Spradley 2016 ).
Migrants are not the only ones to drop things in the desert. Humanitarian groups like No More Deaths leave out jugs of water, canned food, and other items ( Figure 1 ). Radziwinowiczówna (2018) examines the materiality of US Border Patrol's capture of undocumented migrants. She proposes that before a migrant can be deported, agents of the state must detect, seize, control, and catalog his/her body. She discusses how the migrants bodily experience the material things such as guns, chains, handcuffs, uniforms, or syringes that US Border Patrol uses to accomplish these goals.

Migrants crossing from Asia and Africa into Europe face distinct obstacles and dangers. These crossings require a very different material culture of migrant life. Following the migrant crisis of 2015, thousands of bright orange life jackets covered the beaches of the Greek island of Lesvos, and the locals stacked them into great piles ( Tyrikos-Ergas 2018 ). Each life jacket had participated in the lived experience of a migrant who crossed the Mediterranean Sea, and as refuse on the beaches, they interacted with the local population that had received the migrants.
From 2015 to 2016, as sea and land routes became more difficult and dangerous across the Mediterranean and through the Balkans, many migrants forged the Arctic Route across Russia into Finland and the European Union. The migrants often pooled their money to buy cheap, broken down cars in Russia that they drove to, and abandoned on, the Finnish border. Seitsonen et al. (2018) found that the abandoned vehicles and items left or forgotten inside them illustrated the lived experience of refugees on their risky trek through the frozen wilderness.
Although an excessive number of migrants die, many more migrants end up living in deportation centers, refugee camps, or squats (unofficial, clandestine or illegal dwellings). As migrants are stranded in these places, their lives stop; they cannot go forward or backward ( Kirtsoglou 2018 , pp. 225–28). Archaeological studies have focused on how even in these alienating contexts migrants use material things to engage in placemaking, to give meaning, and to regain control of their lives ( Dudley 2011 , p. 743; Kiddey 2019 ).
Scholars have examined the materiality of placemaking in a variety of refugee camps. Dudley (2011) studied the Karenni refugee camps on the Thailand–Burma border. She emphasized the importance in placemaking of producing and consuming things such as food and clothing. In Palestine, Butler & Al-Nammari (2018) found the same processes manifest in food and in a traditional women's embroidered dress called a thobe.
Tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and refugees have washed up on the shores of Greece, and thousands remain stranded there unable to move on. Archaeologists have focused on the Kara Tepe and Moria refugee camps on Lesvos ( Hamilakis 2016 , 2018 , 2019a ) and on alternative refugee shelters ( Kourelis 2018 , Kiddey 2019 ). These camps and alternative shelters contain a great diversity of refugees from the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. The diversity makes the material process of placemaking much more difficult in Greece. This is especially true with food where the officially provided food rations usually end up in the trash or as ingredients in home-cooked dishes ( Thomopoulos et al. 2018 , pp. 205–6; Hamilakis 2019a ). Occupants of the Greek refugee camps and migrants stranded in Athens also use art, poetry, song, and gardens in placemaking ( Arbelaez & Mulholland 2018 , Coelho 2018 , Thomopoulos et al. 2018 ). Kiddey (2019) compares and contrasts the material lived experience in alternative shelters in Athens that include temporary accommodations run by nongovernmental organizations and squats. She finds that refugees occupy empty buildings and adapt other materials in resourceful and creative ways that seek to retain pre-exile ways of life.
The largest and most famous refugee squat in Europe was the Calais Jungle (La Camp de la Lande) in France ( Agier et al. 2019 , Hicks & Mallet 2019 ). From January 2015 to October 2016, migrants and refugees seeking to cross the channel to the United Kingdom built and occupied the camp. At its peak, up to 10,000 people lived in tents and shacks in an illegal shanty town with grossly inadequate utilities, water, and sewage. French ethnographer Agier did an ethnographic study of the camp that includes detailed discussions of the camp's material and visual worlds and clear maps ( Agier et al. 2019 ). Archaeologists Hicks & Mallet (2019) focused on the dismantling of the Calais camp by authorities and the struggles to contest that disappearance.
The lucky and resourceful migrants and refugees make it to the Global North. Here they must engage in a new less transient placemaking. The places and people that they left behind must also engage in placemaking to heal the empty spaces that the migrants leave.
When undocumented migrants and refugees arrive in their destinations, they must adapt to a new environment that they may not have imagined (or incorrectly imagined) or desired. Forced migration breaks people's life plans; they lose family space and cultural context. Colomer (2013 , p. 18) examined the materiality of this placemaking among elderly Chilean political refugees who had fled to Sweden in the 1970s. They sought to maintain a cultural heritage and materialized loss and longing in their homes. Like forced migrants, the people who moved to the Bakken Oil Patch in North Dakota were driven into transient life ( Caraher et al. 2018 ). The mortgage crisis of 2008 pushed them out of their homes and into RV (recreational vehicle) camps, modular crew housing, and squatter camps. Caraher and colleagues’ (2018) archaeological study of these housing sites showed how the occupants succeeded and failed at placemaking. The Partition of India in 1947 displaced millions of people. Riggs (2020) has studied the housing provided by the Indian government for these refugees in New Delhi and how these landscapes developed over the subsequent 70 years. She found that post-Partition changes in Delhi's landscapes demonstrated that refugees who are accepted and provided with even minimal support can thrive.
The experience of modern migration creates empty spaces, both social and physical, in the places left behind. Miller (2008) analyzed what Caribbean migrants to the United Kingdom left behind. He concluded that individuals found themselves caught up in processes beyond their ability to act or control. This loss of agency happened because the migrants’ cultural aspirations suited their origins but had damaging consequences where they went. Riggs & Jat (2018) address the Partition of 1947 from the Pakistani side and the management of Hindu historic properties and out-migrants’ homes. They argue that the management of homes is just as seeded with political symbolism as is the management of historic monument spaces. Pistrick & Bachmeier (2018) took a camera to Albania where they photographed empty migrant bedrooms. Like department store window displays, they are too clean and well-ordered, lacking any evidence of being lived in. In all these examples, the materiality of absences is powerful.
Archaeological research collects lots of stuff. Are the things that displaced persons abandon still their property, or do they become the heritage of nation-states, or is all of this simply garbage ( Soto 2018a , b )? Usually archaeologists send the stuff that they collect to museums for curation. For a contemporary archaeology of modern forced migration to engage in political activism, it must interact with a larger public. Again, archaeologists traditionally do this work in museum displays, so we must ask what role museums should take in understanding forced migration.
The migrant things that archaeologists find in the desert, washed up on the beach and in a demolished camp, are intensely personal. They are the meager, treasured contents of the migrants’ bags ( Lee 2019 ). International Rescue Committee asked displaced persons fleeing to Europe to show “what's in my bag” ( Int. Rescue Comm. 2015 ). Each individual's possessions told a personal story about their past, their present, and their hopes for the future. A mother brought medicine to protect her baby, adults carried cell phones with pictures of family, children carried favorite snacks, and teenagers had personal care items. Nonmigrants can relate to the things in the bags; we can ask ourselves what we would take with us and what we would leave. In camps, displaced persons assemble cast-off goods to make their spaces more comfortable and engage in placemaking ( Hicks & Mallet 2019 ).
Hamilakis (2019b , p. 1376) and Soto (2018a ,b) raise ethical issues about these things. “Who owns these objects and who has the right to exhibit them and how?” Hamilakis (2018 , p. 13) notes that displaced persons might want to forget their experience and not be reminded by the material remains of it. Archaeologists tend to argue for the preservation and exhibition of the material remnants of migration as heritage and as political acts. Migrants may struggle with art, poetry, and song to create heritage from their own experiences ( Thomopoulos et al. 2018 ). As scholars, we must embrace the tension embodied in these questions.
Many citizens of the Global North regard as garbage the backpacks in the desert, the life jackets on the beach, and the smoldering piles of household goods in camps. They view material objects as environmental pollution brought by migrants and refugees who culturally pollute receiving societies. In Arizona, a public–private southern Arizona partnership seeks to remove migrant “trash” both to discourage crossers and to restore the wilderness character of the region for “legitimate” visitors ( Soto 2018b , p. 462). People sympathetic to the crossers tend to see the abandoned stuff as heritage in the making ( De León & Gokee 2019 , p. 71). De León (2015 , p. 171) notes that cleaning up migrant trash is a political act because it removes all traces of their existence from the desert, and Soto (2018b , p. 471) sees the archaeological remains of migration as inhabiting a politically charged dialectical space between trash and heritage. Many things have happened to the stuff that migrants leave behind. Most of it gets hauled away as trash, and some gets sold on eBay as “illegal immigrant artefacts” ( De León & Gokee 2019 , p. 72).
Some ends up in museum displays. From 2013 to 2017, the UMP exhibit State of Exception/Estado de Excepción toured the United States.

This critique goes beyond representation to consider how museums may assist migrants in language training, employment, and volunteering.

Section: CONCLUSIONS

The ultimate goal of a contemporary archaeology of forced migration should not be migrant artifacts in glass cubes or stacked on shelves in museum basements. The craft of archaeology gives us the tools to study modern migration as a material, sensual experience in time. Archaeologists have used these tools to research the materiality of forced migration, but such study has little meaning or worth as solely an academic exercise. Rather we need to engage in research that participates in an activist attempt to aid social justice.
Some archaeologists would have us use the craft of archaeology to develop a universal theory of migration from prehistoric to modern times ( Baker & Tsuda 2015 , CfAS 2019 ). They seek to know what stimulates migration, how migrants are successfully incorporated at their destination, and how such theory might inform contemporary public policy. This top-down approach assumes that the archaeologist knows more about migration than the people migrating. Such a theory mobilizes abstractions and big data. Abstractions dehumanize the migrants, and big data ignore the lived experience of individuals who suffer and bleed today.
Instead, archaeologists can work in critical solidarity with migrants and refugees. We can use our craft to better understand how migrants understand and construct their own history. Hamilakis (2018 , p. 15) contends that an archaeology of forced migration must be “constantly under suspension, ready to abandon any research practices that may harm the migrants, and give up archaeological work when a more pressing activist and solidarity task is required.” Such an archaeology critically collaborates with migrants to understand, alleviate, valorize, and legitimate their lived experience both for them and for a broader public.
Given the growing xenophobia in the Global North and increasing reactionary populism, we need to address broader publics. This effort involves education in popular outlets, including museum exhibits. The most basic task is to humanize the migrants and refugees. We can use the material to make the lived experience of migration into a corporeal, sensual experience in time that our publics can understand and relate to.
Building archaeologies of forced migration that engage our craft, that critically collaborate with migrants, and that politically affect broader publics is not an easy task. Archaeology, however, should welcome these challenges. Archaeologies of forced migration may realize the promises of both the political action archaeology of the end of the twentieth century and the twenty-first-century archaeology of the contemporary.
