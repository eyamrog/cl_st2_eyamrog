Title: Bimekizumab versus Adalimumab in Plaque Psoriasis


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Bimekizumab is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin-17A and interleukin-17F. The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab as compared with the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor adalimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis have not been extensively examined.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We randomly assigned patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous bimekizumab at a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks for 56 weeks; bimekizumab at a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, then every 8 weeks for weeks 16 to 56; or subcutaneous adalimumab at a dose of 40 mg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, followed by bimekizumab at a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks to week 56. The primary end points were a 90% or greater reduction from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (PASI 90 response; PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease) and an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1, signifying clear or almost clear skin (scores range from 0 [clear skin] to 4 [severe disease]), at week 16. The analysis of the primary end points tested noninferiority at a margin of −10 percentage points and then tested for superiority.

Abstract_Section: Results

A total of 614 patients were screened, and 478 were enrolled; 158 patients were assigned to receive bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 161 to receive bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 159 to receive adalimumab. The mean age of the patients was 44.9 years; the mean PASI score at baseline was 19.8. At week 16, a total of 275 of 319 patients (86.2%) who received bimekizumab (both dose groups combined) and 75 of 159 (47.2%) who received adalimumab had a PASI 90 response (adjusted risk difference, 39.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30.9 to 47.7; P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority). A total of 272 of 319 patients (85.3%) who received bimekizumab and 91 of 159 (57.2%) who received adalimumab had an IGA score of 0 or 1 (adjusted risk difference, 28.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 19.7 to 36.7; P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority). The most common adverse events with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections, oral candidiasis (predominantly mild or moderate as recorded by the investigator), hypertension, and diarrhea.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

In this 56-week trial, bimekizumab was noninferior and superior to adalimumab through 16 weeks in reducing symptoms and signs of plaque psoriasis but was associated with a higher frequency of oral candidiasis and diarrhea. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab as compared with other agents in the treatment of plaque psoriasis.

Section: Introduction

The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) play roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Additional involvement of interleukin-17 and interleukin-23 in the pathogenesis of this condition has been identified; however, TNF inhibitors remain a mainstay treatment for psoriasis. The cytokines interleukin-17A and interleukin-17F form homodimers (interleukin-17A/17A and interleukin-17F/17F) and heterodimers (interleukin-17A/17F) and act synergistically with TNF in stimulating inflammation. Some evidence suggests that interleukin-17A inhibition is superior to TNF inhibition in controlling the pathologic features of psoriasis. Bimekizumab is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits both interleukin-17A and interleukin-17F, which — unlike inhibitors of interleukin-17A alone — results in the inhibition of all three dimeric isoforms, including interleukin-17F/17F. Other phase 3 trials involving patients with plaque psoriasis (BE VIVID, BE READY, and BE RADIANT) have shown clinical improvements with bimekizumab as compared with placebo, the interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 inhibitor ustekinumab, or the interleukin-17A inhibitor secukinumab. Here, we report results of the BE SURE phase 3 trial, which compared the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab with adalimumab in patients with plaque psoriasis. This trial also aimed to assess the maintenance of efficacy with bimekizumab when administered every 8 weeks or every 4 weeks.

Section: Methods

Patients were recruited through waiting-room flyers, and eligibility assessments were performed by the trial investigators. Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older, had plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months before screening, and had moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at screening and baseline. Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis was defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of at least 12 (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease), a body-surface area affected by psoriasis of at least 10%, and an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3 on a 5-point scale (with 0 representing complete clearance and 4 representing severe psoriasis). Patients with previous exposure to bimekizumab or adalimumab were excluded, as were patients who had had primary failure (no response within 12 weeks) to any anti–interleukin-17 biologic agent or to more than one biologic agent of any other class. (Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)
The trial was funded by UCB Pharma and designed by the ninth through the twelfth authors and UCB Pharma. UCB Pharma provided the trial drugs and conducted the statistical analyses. The second through sixth authors and the last author gathered the data. All the authors had full access to the trial data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. The sponsor had no restrictions on publication of the article by the academic authors. Confidentiality agreements were in place between UCB Pharma and the authors. All the authors collaborated on writing the manuscript with the assistance of a professional medical writer funded by UCB Pharma. All the patients provided written informed consent, documented in accordance with local regulations, the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonisation, and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
This was a 56-week, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind trial of bimekizumab as compared with adalimumab; it was conducted at 77 sites (clinics, hospitals, research units, and private practices) in nine countries. The trial consisted of a screening period of 2 to 5 weeks (detailed in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org), a 16-week initial treatment period, and a 40-week maintenance treatment period (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ).
After the screening period, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous bimekizumab at a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks for 56 weeks; subcutaneous bimekizumab at a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks for 16 weeks, then every 8 weeks for weeks 16 to 56; or subcutaneous adalimumab at a dose of 80 mg at baseline, followed by 40 mg 1 week later and every 2 weeks thereafter until week 24, when these patients were switched to bimekizumab at a dose of 320 mg every 4 weeks to week 56. After completing the 56-week trial, patients could be enrolled in the BE BRIGHT open-label trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03598790 ). Patients who were not enrolled in the open-label trial underwent a safety follow-up visit 20 weeks after their last dose of trial treatment.
Randomization was carried out with the use of interactive-response technology, stratified according to geographic region (North America, western Europe, central and eastern Europe, or Asia and Australia) and previous exposure to biologic agents (yes or no). To maintain double blinding, patients in all groups received dummy injections at some trial visits to account for the differences in dosing schedules among the treatment groups.
All trial medication was administered subcutaneously in the clinic. The investigators, other trial-site personnel, and the sponsor (with the exception of site staff responsible for the preparation and administration of trial treatments and bioanalytic sample analysis) were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Efficacy end points were assessed by the investigator, another delegated physician, or an appropriately qualified medical professional, all of whom were unaware of the trial-group assignments.
The primary end points were a PASI 90 response (≥90% reduction from baseline in the PASI score) at week 16 and an IGA score of 0 or 1 (“clear” or “almost clear,” respectively, with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline) at week 16. The primary end points were assessed for noninferiority (both end points were required to meet the noninferiority margin), followed by testing for superiority. The five ranked secondary efficacy end points were a PASI 100 response (complete skin clearance) at week 16, a PASI 75 response (≥75% reduction from baseline in the PASI score) at week 4, a PASI 100 response at week 24, a PASI 90 response at week 24, and an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 24. Exploratory end points included a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0 or 1 (on a scale from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating lower health-related quality of life) at week 24 and a PASI 90 response, a PASI 100 response, and a DLQI score of 0 or 1 at week 56 in patients who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab and did not have a PASI 90 response or a DLQI score of 0 or 1 at week 24.
Adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to withdrawal were prespecified secondary end points. Adverse events with an onset on or after the first dose of trial treatment and up to 140 days after the final dose are reported. Adverse events were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities , version 19.0. Serious adverse events were defined as any adverse event meeting one or more of the following criteria: death, life-threatening illness, medically significant or persistent disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect (including that occurring in a fetus), important medical event, and initial inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. The intensity of adverse events was recorded at each trial visit by the investigator as mild (the patient is aware of the sign or symptom, but it does not interfere with usual activities or is of no clinical consequence), moderate (the adverse event interferes with the usual activities of the patient or is of some clinical consequence), or severe (the patient is unable to work normally or to carry out usual activities, or the adverse event is of definite clinical consequence). Prespecified safety topics of interest were infections (serious, opportunistic, fungal, and tuberculosis), neutropenia, hypersensitivity, suicidal ideation and behavior, depression, major adverse cardiovascular events, changes on liver-function tests or elevated enzyme levels, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease.
Sample-size calculations were based on the testing of the superiority of bimekizumab to adalimumab with respect to a PASI 90 response and an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 16. On the basis of data from previous trials of bimekizumab and adalimumab involving patients with plaque psoriasis (BE ABLE 1, VOYAGE 1, and VOYAGE 2), the assumed incidences of a PASI 90 response were 75% with bimekizumab and 50% with adalimumab, and the assumed incidences of an IGA score of 0 or 1 were 85% and 68%, respectively. Under the assumption of a sample size of 150 patients in the adalimumab group and 300 patients in the pooled bimekizumab groups, the power to detect a significant difference between bimekizumab and adalimumab at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 was more than 99% for a PASI 90 response and 97% for an IGA score of 0 or 1. These calculations were based on a two-group continuity-corrected chi-square test of equal proportions.
For all efficacy end points, comparisons were performed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the patients who underwent randomization. The analyses of the primary, secondary, and exploratory end points were based on a stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test, in which geographic region and previous exposure to biologic agents (yes or no) were used as stratification variables. For efficacy variables, imputation of nonresponse was used to account for missing data. When the efficacy variables up to and including week 16 were examined, the two bimekizumab groups were pooled. All between-group differences that are presented for efficacy variables are adjusted risk differences from the stratified Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.
The primary end points were first tested for noninferiority of bimekizumab as compared with adalimumab and were then tested for superiority. For the assessment of noninferiority, a margin of −10 percentage points was used and evaluated on the basis of the confidence intervals for the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel risk difference between bimekizumab and adalimumab. For the primary and ranked secondary end points, multiplicity and type I error were controlled for with the use of a fixed-sequence testing procedure with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Details of the statistical hierarchy are provided in Figure S2. The results for all end points not part of the statistical hierarchy are summarized with point estimates only, from which no conclusions can be drawn. Sensitivity analyses of the primary end points with multiple imputation for missing data and with additional logistic-regression models were conducted.
Safety to week 24 was analyzed for all the patients who received at least one dose of either trial treatment (safety set). For weeks 24 to 56, safety variables were analyzed for all the patients who had received at least one dose of bimekizumab at week 24 or beyond (bimekizumab week-24 set) because all the patients had switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab at week 24.

Section: Results

The trial was carried out between January 26, 2018, and February 26, 2020. The delay in reporting the trial results was due to the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 614 patients were screened and 478 were enrolled; 158 patients were assigned to receive bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 161 to receive bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 159 to receive adalimumab every 2 weeks, followed by bimekizumab every 4 weeks starting at week 24. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar across all treatment groups ( Table 1 ). The mean age of the patients was 44.9 years; 88.1% of the patients were White. The mean PASI score at baseline was 19.8. A total of 18 patients assigned to bimekizumab (5.6%) and 10 assigned to adalimumab (6.3%) discontinued treatment in the first 24 weeks ( Figure 1 ).
Among patients receiving bimekizumab, 275 of 319 (86.2%) had a PASI 90 response (first primary end point) at week 16, as compared with 75 of 159 (47.2%) receiving adalimumab (adjusted risk difference, 39.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 30.9 to 47.7; P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority) ( Figure 2A and Table 2 ). A total of 272 of 319 patients (85.3%) in the combined bimekizumab groups had an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 16 (second primary end point), as compared with 91 of 159 (57.2%) in the adalimumab group (adjusted risk difference, 28.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 19.7 to 36.7; P<0.001 for noninferiority and superiority) ( Figure 2B and Table 2 ).
With respect to secondary end points, 194 of 319 patients (60.8%) receiving bimekizumab had a PASI 100 response (complete skin clearance) at week 16, as compared with 38 of 159 (23.9%) receiving adalimumab (adjusted risk difference, 37.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 28.6 to 45.3; P<0.001) ( Figure 2C and Table 2 ). At week 4, after one dose of treatment, 244 of 319 patients (76.5%) receiving bimekizumab had a PASI 75 response, as compared with 50 of 159 (31.4%) receiving adalimumab (adjusted risk difference, 44.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 36.3 to 53.4; P<0.001) ( Figure 2D and Table 2 ). The percentages of patients with a PASI 100 response, a PASI 90 response, and an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 24 were significantly higher with bimekizumab than with adalimumab ( Table 2 ).
A total of 134 of 158 patients (84.8%) receiving bimekizumab every 4 weeks and 133 of 161 (82.6%) receiving bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks had a PASI 90 response at week 56 ( Figure 2A ). Similar results were observed for an IGA score of 0 or 1 ( Figure 2B ). With respect to exploratory end points (from which no definite conclusions can be made because of the lack of a plan for adjustment of confidence intervals for multiple comparisons), 114 of 158 patients (72.2%) receiving bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 113 of 161 (70.2%) receiving bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 106 of 159 (66.7%) who switched from adalimumab to bimekizumab at week 24 had a PASI 100 response at week 56 ( Figure 2C ).
A total of 106 of 158 patients (67.1%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 108 of 161 (67.1%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 76 of 159 (47.8%) assigned to adalimumab had a DLQI score of 0 or 1 at week 24 (Fig. S3). Through week 56, a total of 117 of 158 patients (74.1%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and 127 of 161 (78.9%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks had a DLQI score of 0 or 1. Among patients switching from adalimumab to bimekizumab every 4 weeks at week 24, a total of 116 of 159 (73.0%) had a DLQI score of 0 or 1 at week 56.
All the patients who were initially assigned to adalimumab were switched to bimekizumab every 4 weeks at week 24. By week 24, a total of 82 of 159 patients (51.6%) who were assigned to adalimumab had a PASI 90 response. After switching to bimekizumab, 130 of 159 patients (81.8%) had a PASI 90 response at week 56. The percentage of patients who had a PASI 90 response and a DLQI score of 0 or 1 increased among patients initially assigned to adalimumab who did not have either a PASI 90 response or a DLQI score of 0 or 1 by week 24, after switching to bimekizumab. By week 56, a total of 54 of 65 patients (83%) had a PASI 90 response and 48 of 69 (70%) had a DLQI score of 0 or 1 (Fig. S4). Among patients who did not have a PASI 90 response at week 24, a total of 40 of 65 (62%) went on to have a PASI 100 response after switching to bimekizumab. The results of the sensitivity analyses of the primary end points were consistent with the results of the primary analysis (Table S1).
From weeks 0 to 24, adverse events occurred in 112 of 158 patients (70.9%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 116 of 161 (72.0%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 111 of 159 patients (69.8%) assigned to adalimumab ( Table 3 ). From weeks 0 to 24, oral candidiasis and diarrhea occurred more frequently in patients assigned to bimekizumab than in those assigned to adalimumab . Serious adverse events were reported in 4 of 158 patients (2.5%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 1 of 161 (0.6%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 5 of 159 (3.1%) assigned to adalimumab. Discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in 3 of 158 patients (1.9%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 6 of 161 (3.7%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 5 of 159 (3.1%) assigned to adalimumab. One death occurred during the first 24 weeks of the trial in a 50-year-old male patient who received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue 6 weeks after the start of adalimumab treatment, which led to death 5 months later ( Table 3 ).
From weeks 24 to 56, adverse events occurred in 101 of 152 patients (66.4%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 104 of 149 (69.8%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 111 of 149 (74.5%) assigned to adalimumab who switched to bimekizumab every 4 weeks at week 24 ( Table 3 ). Serious adverse events were reported in 2 of 152 patients (1.3%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks, 8 of 149 (5.4%) assigned to bimekizumab every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks, and 9 of 149 (6.0%) assigned to adalimumab who switched to bimekizumab every 4 weeks at week 24 ( Table 3 ).
From weeks 0 to 56, there were 76 cases of oral candidiasis with bimekizumab, 36 of which were rated by investigators as moderate and 2 of which were rated as severe; none of the cases of oral candidiasis resulted in trial discontinuation. Of the other adverse events of interest, there were no instances of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events, adjudicated suicidal ideation or behavior, inflammatory bowel disease, serious hypersensitivity reactions, or active tuberculosis among patients treated with bimekizumab ( Table 3 ). The incidence of serious infections was similar across treatment groups.

Section: Discussion

Bimekizumab was noninferior and superior to adalimumab with respect to a PASI 90 response and an IGA score of 0 or 1 at week 16 in patients with plaque psoriasis. By week 4, a higher percentage of patients receiving bimekizumab had a PASI 75 response than patients receiving adalimumab. Levels of skin clearance that were observed in patients who received bimekizumab were maintained through week 56, regardless of dosing regimen. More patients who received bimekizumab had a DLQI score of 0 or 1 at week 24, which was maintained through week 56.
Clinical responses were observed among patients who did not have a PASI 90 response or a DLQI score of 0 or 1 after 24 weeks of treatment with adalimumab and were switched to bimekizumab treatment without a period of washout of adalimumab. After 4 to 8 weeks of bimekizumab treatment, these patients had clinical responses that were similar to those of patients who had received bimekizumab from baseline.
Oral candidiasis and diarrhea were more common with bimekizumab than with adalimumab. Most cases of oral candidiasis were mild to moderate in intensity (97%). The incidence of oral candidiasis was similar to that reported in other phase 3 trials of bimekizumab and is presumed to be the result of the role of interleukin-17 in host defense against candida at the oral mucosa.
Limitations of this trial included the 24-week active-comparator period, which was too brief for a comparison of safety between bimekizumab and adalimumab in a lifelong disease. We used imputation of nonresponse for missing data, which has the potential to underestimate the standard error and alter estimates of differences between groups. The results of the sensitivity analyses of the primary end points that used different imputation methods were in the same direction as the results of the primary analysis. The trial drugs were administered in a clinic setting, and adherence may not be generalizable to home use by patients.
In this phase 3 trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, bimekizumab resulted in higher incidences of clinical response than adalimumab over a period of 24 weeks. Longer, larger trials are required to determine the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab for the treatment of psoriasis.
