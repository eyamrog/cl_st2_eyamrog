Title: Breast Cancer Risk Genes — Association Analysis in More than 113,000 Women


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility is widely used, but for many genes, evidence of an association with breast cancer is weak, underlying risk estimates are imprecise, and reliable subtype-specific risk estimates are lacking.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We used a panel of 34 putative susceptibility genes to perform sequencing on samples from 60,466 women with breast cancer and 53,461 controls. In separate analyses for protein-truncating variants and rare missense variants in these genes, we estimated odds ratios for breast cancer overall and tumor subtypes. We evaluated missense-variant associations according to domain and classification of pathogenicity.

Abstract_Section: Results

Protein-truncating variants in 5 genes ( ATM , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CHEK2 , and PALB2 ) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.0001. Protein-truncating variants in 4 other genes ( BARD1 , RAD51C , RAD51D , and TP53 ) were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.05 and a Bayesian false-discovery probability of less than 0.05. For protein-truncating variants in 19 of the remaining 25 genes, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio for breast cancer overall was less than 2.0. For protein-truncating variants in ATM and CHEK2 , odds ratios were higher for estrogen receptor (ER)–positive disease than for ER-negative disease; for protein-truncating variants in BARD1 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , RAD51C , and RAD51D , odds ratios were higher for ER-negative disease than for ER-positive disease. Rare missense variants (in aggregate) in ATM , CHEK2 , and TP53 were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall with a P value of less than 0.001. For BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and TP53 , missense variants (in aggregate) that would be classified as pathogenic according to standard criteria were associated with a risk of breast cancer overall, with the risk being similar to that of protein-truncating variants.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

The results of this study define the genes that are most clinically useful for inclusion on panels for the prediction of breast cancer risk, as well as provide estimates of the risks associated with protein-truncating variants, to guide genetic counseling.

Section: Introduction

Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility is an established part of medical practice. Until recently, testing was performed mainly in patients with a strong family history of cancer and involved a limited number of genes known to be associated with a high risk of cancer or with specific cancer syndromes. With the advent of affordable sequencing, testing with larger panels of genes has become possible. However, for many genes on such panels, evidence of an association with cancer is often weak and accurate estimates of the cancer risks associated with variants are often not available.
To better define the set of genes associated with breast cancer risk, we designed a panel consisting of 34 known or suspected breast cancer susceptibility genes, including genes provided on commercial panels. Using this panel, we sequenced germline DNA from more than 60,000 women with breast cancer and more than 53,000 controls participating in studies of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). We used these data to estimate the risks of breast cancer overall and tumor subtypes associated with germline protein-truncating variants and rare missense variants in these genes.

Section: Methods

We included samples from women with breast cancer and unaffected controls participating in 44 BCAC studies (Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). All the studies were approved by the relevant ethics review boards and used appropriate consent procedures. Overall, 30 studies did not select patients or controls on the basis of family history (population-based studies); the remaining 14 studies oversampled patients with a family history of breast cancer (family-based studies). After all quality-control steps were taken, 53,461 controls and 60,466 women with an invasive tumor (54,624 [90.3%]), in situ tumor (4187 [6.9%]), or tumor of unknown invasiveness (1655 [2.7%]) were included in the analyses. Of these, 48,826 patients and 50,703 controls were from population-based studies.
We analyzed a panel of 34 known or suspected breast cancer susceptibility genes (Tables S3 and S4), including genes provided on commercial panels. Details regarding library preparation, sequencing, variant calling, quality-control procedures, and variant classification are provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix .
The primary analyses were burden analyses in which odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for breast cancer associated with the presence of any variant in a given category were estimated by means of logistic regression. The two main categories were protein-truncating variants and rare missense variants (i.e., variants with a population frequency of <0.001). Missense-variant associations were evaluated according to domain and classification of pathogenicity. Analyses were also conducted according to tumor subtype, age, and ancestry (European vs. Asian).
We conducted separate analyses for the population-based studies and the family-based studies. The inclusion of studies that oversampled patients with a family history of breast cancer improves the power to detect association but leads to biased risk estimates. Therefore, we report risk estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and P values from the population-based studies but also report the results of association tests from all studies when appropriate. For protein-truncating variants in each gene, evidence of an association is also expressed in terms of Bayesian false-discovery probabilities, reflecting both evidence from the data in this study and evidence from previous research. Absolute risks were calculated by combining age-specific estimated odds ratios with population incidences in the United Kingdom in 2016 as a baseline. Details regarding the statistical analysis are provided in Supplementary Methods.

Section: Results

Protein-truncating variants in 5 genes ( ATM , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CHEK2 , and PALB2 ) were associated with a significant risk of breast cancer overall (P<0.0001) ( Table 1 and Figure 1 and Figure 2 ). For these genes, odds ratios ranged from 2.10 to 10.57. In CHEK2 , the c.1100delC variant accounted for approximately 80% of the protein-truncating variants. The effect size for this variant (odds ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.27 to 3.11; P=1.1×10 [P=5.3×10 in all studies]) did not differ significantly from the effect size for all other protein-truncating variants in CHEK2 (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.84; P=3.0×10 [P=7.4×10 in all studies]), with a P value of 0.19 for the difference in the odds ratios.
There was more modest evidence of an association with breast cancer overall for protein-truncating variants in 7 other genes: BARD1 (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.35 to 3.23; P=0.00098 [P=0.00011 in all studies]), RAD51C (odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.11; P=0.0070 [P=0.00026 in all studies]), RAD51D (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.93; P=0.018 [P=0.0018 in all studies]), PTEN (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.85 to 6.00; P=0.10 [P=0.0040 in all studies]), NF1 (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.96 to 3.21; P=0.068 [P=0.011 in all studies]), TP53 (odds ratio, 3.06; 95% CI, 0.63 to 14.91; P=0.17 [P=0.015 in all studies]), and MSH6 (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.33; P=0.013 [P=0.021 in all studies]) ( Table 1 ). For 4 of these genes ( BARD1 , RAD51C , RAD51D , and TP53 ), the Bayesian false-discovery probability was less than 0.05 ( Table 1 ).
For the 12 genes that had evidence of an association with breast cancer overall, the effect size for protein-truncating variants did not differ significantly between European women and Asian women (Table S7). Of the remaining 22 genes, all but 3 ( AKT1 , MSH2 , and STK11 ) had an upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio of less than 2.0 in the population-based studies.
Of the 12 genes that had evidence of an association with breast cancer overall, 2 had a stronger association with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer than with ER-negative breast cancer: ATM (odds ratio, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.87 to 2.91] for ER-positive disease vs. 1.01 [95% CI, 0.64 to 1.59] for ER-negative disease; P=0.00055 for the difference) and CHEK2 (odds ratio, 2.67 [95% CI, 2.30 to 3.11] for ER-positive disease vs. 1.64 [95% CI, 1.25 to 2.16] for ER-negative disease; P=3.6×10 for the difference) ( Figure 2 and Table S8). CHEK2 also had evidence of an association with ER-negative, non–triple-negative breast cancer (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.67) but not with triple-negative breast cancer (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.76) (Table S9).
In contrast, for BARD1 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , RAD51C , and RAD51D , odds ratios were higher for ER-negative breast cancer than for ER-positive breast cancer (P<0.05 for all genes). Of these genes, 3 had a stronger association with triple-negative breast cancer than with ER-negative, non–triple-negative breast cancer: BARD1 (P=0.044), BRCA1 (P=9.6×10 ), and BRCA2 (P=7.8×10 ) (Table S8).
Among the genes that had no evidence of an association with breast cancer overall, FANCM had some evidence of an association with ER-negative breast cancer (P=0.0050 in all studies) and FANCC had evidence of an association with triple-negative breast cancer (P=0.0021 in all studies) (Table S9).
For BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 , odds ratios were higher for invasive tumors than for in situ tumors. In contrast, for ATM and CHEK2 , odds ratios for invasive tumors and in situ tumors were similar (Table S10).
In the population-based studies, odds ratios decreased significantly with increasing age for 6 genes: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CHEK2 , PALB2 , PTEN , and TP53 (P<0.01 for all genes) (Tables S11 and S12). Estimated absolute risks of breast cancer were derived by combining age-specific estimated odds ratios with population incidences in the United Kingdom ( Figure 3 ). For carriers of protein-truncating variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 , the estimated absolute risks by 80 years of age exceeded the 30% threshold for high risk, as defined by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. For carriers of protein-truncating variants in ATM , BARD1 , CHEK2 , RAD51C , and RAD51D , the estimated absolute risks by 80 years of age were within the 17 to 30% range for moderate risk.
There was evidence of an association with breast cancer overall for rare missense variants in 6 genes: CHEK2 (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.58; P=2.5×10 [P=2.9×10 in all studies]), ATM (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.13; P=0.051 [P=0.0010 in all studies]), TP53 (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.31; P=0.32 [P=0.00080 in all studies]), BRCA1 (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.20; P=0.010 [P=0.027 in all studies]), CDH1 (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.23; P=0.096 [P=0.042 in all studies]), and RECQL (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.26; P=0.047 [P=0.036 in all studies]) ( Table 2 ). Of these 6 genes, 2 had a stronger association with ER-positive breast cancer than with ER-negative breast cancer ( CHEK2 [P=9.1×10 ] and CDH1 [P=0.012]) and 1 had a stronger association with ER-negative breast cancer than with ER-positive breast cancer ( BRCA1 [P=0.01]). Odds ratios decreased with increasing age for BRCA1 (P=0.0026), CHEK2 (P=0.00022), and TP53 (P=0.00023).
For missense variants (in aggregate) in BRCA1 , the risk of breast cancer overall differed according to domain (P=3.0×10 ); there was an increased risk associated with variants located in the regions encoding the RING domain (P=1.0×10 ) and the BRCT1 domain (P=0.00020) (Tables S13 and S14 and Fig. S1A). For missense variants in CHEK2 , the odds ratios did not vary according to location (P=0.52), such that the risk associated with variants within domains (P=4.2×10 ) was similar to the risk associated with variants outside domains (P=0.001) (Tables S13 and S15 and Fig. S1B). For ATM , there was an increased risk associated with variants in the FRAP–ATM–TRRAP (FAT) domain (P=0.00019 in all studies) and the protein kinase domains (P=0.00092 in all studies) (Tables S13 and S16 and Fig. S1C). There was no evidence of a risk associated with missense variants in specific domains in BRCA2 (P=0.27) or PALB2 (P=0.48) (Tables S13, S17, and S18 and Figs. S1D and S1E).
We specifically examined rare missense variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and TP53 that would be classified as pathogenic according to clinical guidelines. There was clear evidence of an association with breast cancer overall for pathogenic variants (in aggregate) in each gene (odds ratio, 16.11 [95% CI, 5.83 to 44.50] in BRCA1 , 5.68 [95% CI, 2.62 to 12.29] in BRCA2 , and 2.91 [95% CI, 1.71 to 4.98] in TP53 ) but not for other missense variants (in aggregate) in each gene (odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.15] in BRCA1 , 0.97 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.02] in BRCA2 , and 0.94 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.14] in TP53 ) (Table S19 and Figs. S2A, S2B, and S2C).

Section: Discussion

This large study, in which we evaluated coding variation in putative breast cancer susceptibility genes, involved more than 60,000 patients and 53,000 controls, permitting the calculation of risk estimates that are more precise than those obtained previously. We found strong evidence of an association with breast cancer risk (Bayesian false-discovery probability, <0.05) for protein-truncating variants in 9 genes, with a P value of less than 0.0001 for 5 genes ( ATM , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CHEK2 , and PALB2 ) and a P value of less than 0.05 for the other 4 genes ( BARD1 , RAD51C , RAD51D , and TP53 ). We found that, for protein-truncating variants in most of these genes, the odds ratio differed according to breast cancer subtype. Protein-truncating variants in ATM and CHEK2 were more strongly associated with ER-positive disease than with ER-negative disease, a finding consistent with earlier observations, whereas protein-truncating variants in BARD1 , BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , RAD51C , and RAD51D were more strongly associated with ER-negative disease than with ER-positive disease. None of the other 25 genes in the panel had a Bayesian false-discovery probability of less than 0.10. Of note, 19 genes had an upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio of less than 2.0, with 2.0 representing a proposed threshold for “pathogenic, moderate risk alleles” ; we therefore conclude that these genes are not informative for the prediction of breast cancer risk. We confirmed that missense variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and TP53 that would be classified as pathogenic according to clinical guidelines are indeed associated with clinically significant risks. We also found that rare missense variants in CHEK2 overall, as well as variants in specific domains in ATM , are associated with moderate risk.
Our results are broadly consistent with the results of an analysis by Lee et al., in which the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) clinical validity framework was used (Table S20). Of the 10 genes that were regarded as having definitive evidence of an association with breast cancer risk in that analysis, 7 genes had variants associated with breast cancer risk in our analysis; deleterious variants in the remaining 3 genes ( CDH1 , PTEN , and STK11 ) are very rare and confer a predisposition to specific cancer syndromes. Of the 18 genes that were regarded as having moderate, limited, or disputed evidence of an association with breast cancer risk in that analysis, 2 genes ( RAD51C and RAD51D ) had protein-truncating variants associated with breast cancer risk in our analysis; 13 of the remaining genes had an upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio of less than 2.0 (and thus were classified as not conferring moderate or high risk according to our analysis), and the other 3 genes ( MSH2 , MSH6 , and NF1 ) could not be classified. An association between breast cancer risk and variants in RAD51C and RAD51D is highly plausible, given that the functions of these genes are related to one another, that both genes had a stronger association with ER-negative breast cancer than with ER-positive breast cancer, and that both genes have evidence of an association with ovarian cancer.
Association analyses of rare variants are susceptible to bias. Inclusion of studies that oversampled patients with a family history of breast cancer improves the power to detect an association but leads to an upward bias in estimated odds ratios. The expected larger effect size in the family-based studies (as compared with the population-based studies) was seen for protein-truncating variants in all the genes with evidence of an association with breast cancer, except BRCA1 and BRCA2 , and was seen for missense variants in ATM , CHEK2 , and TP53 (Tables S21 and S22). Protein-truncating variants in some of these genes are also associated with other types of cancer. Moreover, testing for cancer susceptibility genes in cancer genetics clinics can lead to a downward bias, because carriers identified through previous testing may be excluded. We observed a depletion of carriers of protein-truncating variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 among women with breast cancer in the family-based studies. Therefore, we regard the estimates from the population-based studies to be the most reliable.
With regard to rare missense variants, the clearest evidence of an association with increased breast cancer risk was for CHEK2 . For rare missense variants (in aggregate) in CHEK2 , the odds ratio was approximately 1.4. The association was independent of location, which suggests that a large proportion of missense variants in CHEK2 confer risk (albeit below the threshold suggested for “pathogenic, moderate risk alleles” ). We also found some evidence of an association with risk for rare missense variants (in aggregate) in ATM , BRCA1 , CDH1 , and TP53 , with odds ratios of approximately 1.1 (P<0.05) for all genes. Furthermore, we found evidence of an association with risk for missense variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and TP53 that would be classified as pathogenic according to standard criteria but not for other missense variants in these genes; the odds ratios for the pathogenic variants (in aggregate) were similar to odds ratios for protein-truncating variants in these genes. For ATM , evidence of an association with risk appeared to be restricted to variants located in the regions encoding the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and 4-kinase and FAT domains, a finding consistent with previous observations.
The absolute risk estimates for protein-truncating variants in previously established risk genes were broadly consistent with previous estimates, except estimates for BRCA2 and TP53 , which were lower than risks reported in previous family-based studies. However, the estimate for TP53 in this study was based on data from only seven carriers and had a wide confidence interval. The low estimate may reflect the significant early mortality among carriers of protein-truncating variants in TP53 ; alternatively, it is possible that the earlier family-based studies had overestimated the risk. The analysis for TP53 is further complicated by the possibility of unrecognized somatic mutations in the blood due to age-related clonal hematopoiesis. The fact that the estimate for BRCA2 was lower than the estimate for BRCA1 may reflect the older age distribution in this study, as compared with previous studies, and perhaps a disproportionately large effect of genetic modifiers on risk among BRCA2 carriers, as compared with BRCA1 carriers.
Among European women, approximately 6.8% of the patients and 2.0% of the controls had protein-truncating variants in any of the 9 genes associated with breast cancer risk; in addition, 2.2% of the patients and 1.4% of the controls had missense variants in CHEK2 . The frequency of protein-truncating variants among Asian women (4.4% of the patients and 1.3% of the controls) was lower than the frequency among European women; this finding is attributable to the much lower frequency of the c.1100delC variant in CHEK2 among Asian women.
The absolute risk estimates place protein-truncating variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 in the high-risk category and place protein-truncating variants in ATM , BARD1 , CHEK2 , RAD51C , and RAD51D in the moderate-risk category. These results may guide screening, as well as prevention with risk-reducing surgery or medication, in accordance with national guidelines. However, because breast cancer risk is influenced by other genetic and lifestyle factors, in addition to family history, the incorporation of this information into risk models would be required to give appropriate estimates.
Despite the size of this study, the evidence of an association with breast cancer risk for several of the genes we analyzed (e.g., FANCM , MSH6 , and NF1 ) remains equivocal, and even for the genes that had a clear association with risk, the confidence intervals for the risk estimates are wide. Incorporation of pedigree data and combined analyses with other studies may improve the precision of these estimates. In the meantime, these results may help to guide the clinical reporting of results generated by multigene-panel testing and the counseling of women who are undergoing genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility.
