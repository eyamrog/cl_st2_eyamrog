Title: Atezolizumab for First-Line Treatment of PD-L1–Selected Patients with NSCLC


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

The efficacy and safety of the anti–programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody atezolizumab, as compared with those of platinum-based chemotherapy, as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 expression are not known.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving patients with metastatic nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC who had not previously received chemotherapy and who had PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells or at least 1% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells as assessed by the SP142 immunohistochemical assay. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab or chemotherapy. Overall survival (primary end point) was tested hierarchically according to PD-L1 expression status among patients in the intention-to-treat population whose tumors were wild-type with respect to EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. Within the population with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors, overall survival and progression-free survival were also prospectively assessed in subgroups defined according to findings on two PD-L1 assays as well as by blood-based tumor mutational burden.

Abstract_Section: Results

Overall, 572 patients were enrolled. In the subgroup of patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had the highest expression of PD-L1 (205 patients), the median overall survival was longer by 7.1 months in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (20.2 months vs. 13.1 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; P=0.01). Among all the patients who could be evaluated for safety, adverse events occurred in 90.2% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and in 94.7% of those in the chemotherapy group; grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 30.1% and 52.5% of the patients in the respective groups. Overall and progression-free survival favored atezolizumab in the subgroups with a high blood-based tumor mutational burden.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Atezolizumab treatment resulted in significantly longer overall survival than platinum-based chemotherapy among patients with NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression, regardless of histologic type. (Funded by F. Hoffmann–La Roche/Genentech; IMpower110 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02409342 .)

Section: Introduction

Inhibitors of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, either as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, have emerged as a new standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) or translocations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ). Pembrolizumab monotherapy has been approved as a first-line treatment for patients with tumors with high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score [the fraction of tumor cells expressing PD-L1], ≥50%) in the United States and European Union. In the United States, this approval has been extended to patients with advanced NSCLC with a tumor proportion score of at least 1%; however, most of the clinical benefit appears to be limited to the subgroup with the highest PD-L1 expression. The phase 2 BIRCH and POPLAR trials as well as the phase 3 OAK trial showed an overall survival benefit with atezolizumab, an anti–PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, as a monotherapy in patients with NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression (as assessed by the SP142 PD-L1 immunohistochemical assay) across multiple lines of therapy.
Despite advances in the landscape of first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC, additional treatment options are needed. IMpower110 is a global, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab as compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in PD-L1–selected patients (positive for PD-L1 on the SP142 assay) with EGFR and ALK wild-type metastatic NSCLC who had not previously received chemotherapy.
Currently, several PD-L1 immunohistochemical assays are routinely used to guide decisions about immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatment. We performed prespecified efficacy analyses of subgroups defined with the use of other frequently used PD-L1 immunohistochemical assays (22C3 and SP263), allowing for their evaluation within the enrolled population. In addition, we performed efficacy analyses in subgroups defined according to blood-based tumor mutational burden, which is a noninvasive approach for identifying patients who may benefit from immunotherapy. Here, we report primary efficacy and safety results of the interim analysis of overall survival among patients with high PD-L1 expression as assessed by the SP142 immunohistochemical assay, as well as efficacy in subgroups defined according to additional biomarkers.

Section: Methods

Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older; had stage IV nonsquamous or squamous NSCLC, measurable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1; had a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale in which higher scores indicate greater disability); and had not previously received chemotherapy. PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells covering at least 1% of the tumor area as determined by the SP142 assay was required. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted by a central laboratory on archival tumor tissue or tissue obtained through biopsy at the time of screening. Full details on eligibility are provided in the protocol , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Initially, patients with a known sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK translocation were eligible provided they had received previous targeted therapy. The protocol was subsequently amended to exclude these patients from the analysis (18 patients) because emerging data suggested that they may not benefit from immune-checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy. All the patients were evaluated for central nervous system (CNS) metastasis at the time of screening with the use of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both; patients with active or untreated CNS metastases were ineligible for enrollment in the trial.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously) or platinum-based chemotherapy (4 or 6 cycles) once every 3 weeks. In the chemotherapy group, patients with nonsquamous NSCLC received either cisplatin (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or carboplatin (area under the concentration−time curve [AUC], 6) in addition to pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter) intravenously; patients with squamous NSCLC received a regimen of cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) plus gemcitabine (1250 mg per square meter) or a regimen of carboplatin (AUC, 5) plus gemcitabine (1000 mg per square meter) intravenously. Randomization was stratified according to sex (male vs. female), ECOG performance-status score (0 vs. 1), histologic type (nonsquamous vs. squamous), and PD-L1 status (≥1% PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and any level of PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells vs. <1% PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and ≥1% PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells). Continuation of atezolizumab after disease progression was allowed in patients who had continued clinical benefit. No crossover to the atezolizumab group was permitted.
Genentech (a member of the Roche Group) funded the trial, provided the trial treatments, and collaborated with the academic authors on the design of the trial and the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The trial was conducted in full accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki or the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever afforded the most protection. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Safety data were regularly reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee. The committee was also responsible for evaluating efficacy data at the prespecified interim analysis of overall survival. The protocol was approved by independent ethics committees for each site. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. Earlier versions of the manuscript were developed by the authors, with editorial and writing assistance funded by the sponsor.
Overall survival was the primary end point in the PD-L1–selected population that excluded patients with EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. Secondary efficacy end points included investigator-assessed progression-free survival according to RECIST, version 1.1; the occurrence and duration of a response; and overall and investigator-assessed progression-free survival according to RECIST, version 1.1, in prespecified subgroups with respect to PD-L1 expression (defined by the SP263 immunohistochemical assay) and blood-based tumor mutational burden. Safety was assessed in all the patients who received a trial agent regardless of PD-L1 expression status or status with respect to EGFR or ALK alterations. Exploratory end points included overall and investigator-assessed progression-free survival according to RECIST, version 1.1, in prespecified subgroups with respect to PD-L1 expression defined by the 22C3 immunohistochemical assay.
Tumor assessments were conducted at baseline, every 6 weeks for 48 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter, until radiographic disease progression (or loss of clinical benefit for patients in the atezolizumab group who were treated beyond disease progression), withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first. Adverse events were reported according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities , version 22.0.
The scoring algorithm of the SP142 immunohistochemical assay (Ventana) measures PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells; the algorithms of the 22C3 assay (Dako) and SP263 assay (Ventana) specifically measure PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. The cutoffs of a tumor proportion score of at least 1% and at least 50% were evaluated for the 22C3 assay, and the cutoffs of at least 1% of tumor cells and at least 50% of tumor cells were evaluated for the SP263 assay. The blood-based tumor mutational burden assay (Foundation Medicine) identifies single-nucleotide variants at a variant allele fraction of at least 0.5% across 394 genes and estimates the tumor fraction according to maximum somatic allele frequency, filters out germline events, and counts nondriver somatic mutations to generate a score. The cutoff scores for blood-based tumor mutational burden that were evaluated were at least 10, at least 16, and at least 20. A score of 16 (16 mutations per 1.1 megabases) equates to approximately 14.5 mutations per megabase.
Full details of the statistical analyses, including sample size and power, are provided in the protocol. To control for the overall type I error rate at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, the primary end point of overall survival was tested hierarchically in the population with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors: high PD-L1 expression (≥50% of tumor cells or ≥10% of tumor-infiltrating immune cells), then combined high and intermediate PD-L1 expression (≥5% of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells), and then any PD-L1 expression (≥1% of tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells; intention-to-treat population) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). If the results for the primary end point of overall survival were significant in all three primary analysis populations, a two-sided significance level of 0.05 would be passed down to compare progression-free survival between the atezolizumab and control groups.
An interim analysis of overall survival was conducted when approximately 96 deaths and an event–patient ratio of 45% had occurred among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression. Analyses of overall and progression-free survival were performed with the use of a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated with a stratified Cox regression model. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate medians, and the Brookmeyer–Crowley method was used to generate 95% confidence intervals for the medians. The percentages of patients with a response and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the Clopper–Pearson method. Response duration was estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method. We performed prespecified subgroup analyses to assess the consistency of the treatment effect using unstratified hazard ratios that were estimated from a Cox proportional-hazards model.

Section: Results

Between July 21, 2015, and February 20, 2018, a total of 572 patients underwent randomization at 144 centers in 19 countries, with 285 patients assigned to receive atezolizumab and 287 assigned to receive chemotherapy (Fig. S2). The population with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors comprised 554 patients (277 patients in each group). A total of 18 patients with an EGFR mutation or ALK translocation were enrolled and were excluded from the primary analysis population but were included in the safety population.
The baseline characteristics of the patients were generally balanced between the treatment groups ( Table 1 and Table S1). Overall in the population with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors, 107 patients (38.6%) in the atezolizumab group and 98 (35.4%) in the chemotherapy group had high expression of PD-L1; 166 patients (59.9%) in the atezolizumab group and 162 (58.5%) in the chemotherapy group had high or intermediate PD-L1 expression ( Table 1 , Table S1, and Fig. S3).
At the data cutoff date (September 10, 2018), the median follow-up times for survival among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression, high or intermediate PD-L1 expression, and any PD-L1 expression were 15.7 months (range, 0 to 35), 15.2 months (range, 0 to 35), and 13.4 months (range, 0 to 35), respectively. In the specified population, 101 of 205 patients (49.3%) who had high PD-L1 expression, 154 of 328 patients (47.0%) who had high or intermediate PD-L1 expression, and 253 of 554 patients (45.7%) who had any PD-L1 expression had died.
Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression, the median overall survival was significantly longer — by 7.1 months — in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (20.2 months vs. 13.1 months; stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.89; P=0.01) ( Figure 1A ). The effect of the treatment in patient subgroups is shown in Figure S4.
The results for overall survival among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high or intermediate PD-L1 expression did not cross the prespecified alpha boundary (median, 18.2 months in the atezolizumab group and 14.9 months in the chemotherapy group; stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99; P=0.04) ( Figure 1B ); therefore, in accordance with the statistical analysis plan, overall survival among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression was not formally tested. The median overall survival among these patients was 17.5 months with atezolizumab and 14.1 months with chemotherapy (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.07) ( Figure 1C ). The results of an exploratory sensitivity analysis of overall survival with adjustment for patients whose data were censored owing to early withdrawal are shown in Table S2.
Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression, 2 patients (1.9%) in the atezolizumab group and 29 patients (29.6%) in the chemotherapy group received subsequent immunotherapy (Table S3). Across subgroups with respect to PD-L1 expression, the percentage of patients receiving different classes of subsequent anticancer therapies was similar.
At data cutoff, 146 of 205 patients (71.2%) with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression had had disease progression or had died. Progression-free survival was 8.1 months in the atezolizumab group and 5.0 months in the chemotherapy group (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88) (Fig. S5A). Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high or intermediate PD-L1 expression, progression-free survival was 7.2 months in the atezolizumab group and 5.5 months in the chemotherapy group (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88) (Fig. S5B).
Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression, the percentage of patients who had an investigator-assessed confirmed response was 38.3% in the atezolizumab group and 28.6% in the chemotherapy group (Table S4). At data cutoff, confirmed responses were ongoing in 68.3% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and 35.7% of those in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high or intermediate PD-L1 expression, the percentage of patients who had an investigator-assessed confirmed response was 30.7% in the atezolizumab group and 32.1% in the chemotherapy group, with confirmed responses ongoing in 70.6% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and 34.6% of those in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression, the percentage of patients who had an investigator-assessed confirmed response was 29.2% in the atezolizumab group and 31.8% in the chemotherapy group, with confirmed responses ongoing in 70.4% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and 33.0% of those in the chemotherapy group.
Of the 554 patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression, 534 could be evaluated by the 22C3 assay and 546 by the SP263 assay. Key baseline characteristics for each biomarker subgroup were consistent with those for the patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression (Table S5). The prevalence of PD-L1 expression as determined by the 22C3 and SP263 assays was similar (Fig. S6). High overlap was observed between the subgroup with a tumor proportion score of at least 50% on the 22C3 assay and the subgroup with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells on the SP263 assay ( Figure 2A ). In addition, approximately 30% of the patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression as assessed by the SP142 assay were encompassed within the subgroup with a tumor proportion score of at least 50% on the 22C3 or the subgroup with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells on the SP263 assay ( Figure 2A ).
Among patients with high PD-L1 expression as assessed by the SP142 assay, the median overall survival was 20.2 months in the atezolizumab group and 13.1 months in the chemotherapy group (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.89) ( Figure 1A ). Patients with a tumor proportion score of at least 50% on the 22C3 assay had an overall survival of 20.2 months in the atezolizumab group and 11.0 months in the chemotherapy group (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.86) ( Figure 2B ), and patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells on the SP263 assay had values of 19.5 months and 16.1 months, respectively (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.00) ( Figure 2C ).
In the population of patients who could be evaluated for biomarker levels, those who were PD-L1–positive as assessed by the SP142 assay had a median overall survival of 17.5 months in the atezolizumab group and 14.1 months in the chemotherapy group (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.07). Patients who had a tumor proportion score of at least 1% on the 22C3 assay had an overall survival of 17.8 months in the atezolizumab group and 14.0 months in the chemotherapy group (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.97), and patients who had PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumor cells on the SP263 assay had values of 17.8 months and 14.0 months, respectively (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.02) (Fig. S7). Among patients who had intermediate or low PD-L1 expression as assessed by the SP142 assay, the median overall survival was 12.9 months in the atezolizumab group and 14.9 months in the chemotherapy group (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.44). Patients with a tumor proportion score of 1 to 49% on the 22C3 assay had an overall survival of 16.5 months in the atezolizumab group and 15.7 months in the chemotherapy group (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.58), and patients with PD-L1 expression on 1 to 49% of tumor cells on the SP263 assay had values of 13.3 months and 10.6 months, respectively (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.53) (Fig. S8). Progression-free survival with atezolizumab as compared with chemotherapy across subgroups of patients who could be evaluated for PD-L1 biomarker levels is shown in Figure S9.
Of the 554 patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression, 389 could be evaluated for blood-based tumor mutational burden. Baseline characteristics were consistent between the patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression and those who could be evaluated for blood-based tumor mutational burden (Table S6). A total of 22.4% of the patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who could be evaluated for mutational burden had a blood-based tumor mutational burden score of at least 16, and this burden level appeared to identify a distinct population as compared with the population identified as having high PD-L1 expression on the SP142 or 22C3 immunohistochemical assay ( Figure 3A ). The median overall survival among patients with a blood-based tumor mutational burden score of at least 16 was 13.9 months in the atezolizumab group and 8.5 months in the chemotherapy group (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.35) (Fig. S10). The median progression-free survival among patients with a blood-based tumor mutational burden score of at least 16 was 6.8 months in the atezolizumab group and 4.4 months in the chemotherapy group (unstratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.92) ( Figure 3B ).
Safety analysis was performed in all the patients who received a trial agent, including patients who received any amount of atezolizumab (286 patients) and those who received chemotherapy only (263 patients). The median treatment duration for atezolizumab was 5.3 months. In the chemotherapy group, the median treatment duration was 2.1 months for cisplatin, 2.3 months for carboplatin, 2.6 months for gemcitabine, and 3.5 months for pemetrexed.
Adverse events occurred in 90.2% of the patients receiving atezolizumab and in 94.7% of those receiving chemotherapy ( Table 2 and Tables S7 and S8). Adverse events with a 5-percentage-point difference in incidence between the treatment groups are described in Figure S11. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 30.1% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and in 52.5% of those in the chemotherapy group ( Table 2 ), with the most common (≥5% in either group) being anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (all with chemotherapy). Serious adverse events occurred in 28.3% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and in 28.5% of those in the chemotherapy group (Table S7). A total of 11 patients (3.8%) in the atezolizumab group and 11 patients (4.2%) in the chemotherapy group had a grade 5 adverse event ( Table 2 and Table S7).
Immune-mediated adverse events, which were defined according to a list of sponsor-specified terms, regardless of whether these events led to use of systemic glucocorticoids, endocrine therapy, or other immunosuppressants, occurred in 40.2% of the patients in the atezolizumab group and in 16.7% of those in the chemotherapy group; grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 6.6% and 1.5% of the patients in the respective groups (Table S9). No grade 5 immune-mediated adverse events were noted. Hepatic laboratory abnormalities, rash, and hypothyroidism were the most commonly reported immune-mediated adverse events (≥5% in either group) (Table S9). Immune-mediated adverse events that resulted in systemic glucocorticoid treatment are reported in Table S10.

Section: Discussion

We conducted a phase 3 trial of atezolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with nonsquamous or squamous metastatic NSCLC who had not previously received chemotherapy. The median overall survival was significantly longer — by 7.1 months — with atezolizumab than with chemotherapy among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high PD-L1 expression. The observed safety profile was consistent with that observed in previous studies of atezolizumab monotherapy across indications, histologic type, and lines of therapy.
The testing boundary for overall survival was not crossed among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had high or intermediate PD-L1 expression; therefore, patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who had any PD-L1 expression could not be formally tested. The trial is ongoing to provide data on the final analysis of overall survival. Among patients with EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors who received atezolizumab, observed results for overall survival according to level of PD-L1 expression were similar to those seen in the phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial comparing pembrolizumab with chemotherapy; in both trials, the patients with high PD-L1 expression had the most benefit.
Our trial evaluated as exploratory end points how different PD-L1 scoring methods perform to predict the activity of atezolizumab as compared with chemotherapy. The analytic performance and concordance of the different assays were evaluated previously ; these analyses have shown that the 22C3 and SP263 PD-L1 assays were highly concordant, whereas the SP142 assay was less sensitive for staining of both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In the clinical setting, the 22C3 and SP263 assays evaluate PD-L1 expression on tumor cells only, whereas the SP142 assay evaluates expression on both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Our trial selected patients who had any level of PD-L1 expression as assessed by the SP142 assay. Hence, the assessment of additional biomarkers provided results from a double-selected patient population, which is a limitation of the analysis. A benefit favoring atezolizumab was observed in patients with high PD-L1 expression across all three assays, despite different analytic sensitivities and scoring algorithms.
The role of tumor mutational burden (in blood and tissue) as a predictive biomarker of response to cancer immunotherapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC remains uncertain. Although the predictive value of tumor mutational burden in patients receiving the cancer immunotherapy–chemotherapy combination appears to be limited, recent data suggest its predictive value in the context of immunotherapy without chemotherapy. Various cutoffs (≥20 and ≥10 mutations per megabase and ≥175 mutations per exome) have been used retrospectively across cancer immunotherapy studies and have been shown to be predictive of overall survival, progression-free survival, or both in this context. It is difficult to compare results across trials owing to differences in the assays and cutoffs used. The prospective, phase 2 B-F1RST trial examined blood-based tumor mutational burden as a potential biomarker in patients with metastatic NSCLC receiving atezolizumab monotherapy as a first-line treatment. The median progression-free survival was 5.0 months among patients with a blood-based tumor mutational burden score of at least 16 and 3.5 months among those with a blood-based tumor mutational burden score of less than 16 (unstratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.80; 90% CI, 0.54 to 1.18), and the median overall survival was 23.9 months and 13.4 months, respectively (unstratified hazard ratio for death, 0.66; 90% CI, 0.40 to 1.10). In our trial, outcomes also favored atezolizumab, with an apparent plateau of clinical benefit in the subgroup with a blood-based tumor mutational burden score of at least 16; the greatest magnitude of benefit was seen for progression-free survival, a finding consistent with those of previous trials. The ongoing randomized, phase 3 Blood-First Assay Screening Trial (BFAST; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03178552 ) is prospectively evaluating first-line treatment with atezolizumab monotherapy as compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have a positive blood-based tumor mutational burden score.
We found that atezolizumab monotherapy resulted in longer overall survival than platinum-based combination chemotherapy among patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCLC with high expression of PD-L1. Toxic effects were consistent with those that have been reported previously.
