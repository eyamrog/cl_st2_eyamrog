Title: Avelumab Maintenance Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Platinum-based chemotherapy is standard-of-care first-line treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma. However, progression-free survival and overall survival are limited by chemotherapy resistance.

Abstract_Section: Methods

In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who did not have disease progression with first-line chemotherapy (four to six cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin) to receive best supportive care with or without maintenance avelumab. The primary end point was overall survival, assessed among all patients who underwent randomization (overall population) and among those with tumors positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Secondary end points included progression-free survival and safety.

Abstract_Section: Results

Among all 700 patients who underwent randomization, the addition of maintenance avelumab to best supportive care significantly prolonged overall survival as compared with best supportive care alone (control). Overall survival at 1 year was 71.3% in the avelumab group and 58.4% in the control group (median overall survival, 21.4 months vs. 14.3 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.86; P=0.001). Avelumab also significantly prolonged overall survival in the PD-L1–positive population; overall survival at 1 year was 79.1% in the avelumab group and 60.4% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.79; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 3.7 months in the avelumab group and 2.0 months in the control group in the overall population (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75) and 5.7 months and 2.1 months, respectively, in the PD-L1–positive population (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.73). The incidence of adverse events from any cause was 98.0% in the avelumab group and 77.7% in the control group; the incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 47.4% and 25.2%, respectively.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

Maintenance avelumab plus best supportive care significantly prolonged overall survival, as compared with best supportive care alone, among patients with urothelial cancer who had disease that had not progressed with first-line chemotherapy.

Section: Introduction

Combination platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma in patients who are suitable candidates for platinum-based therapy. Although chemotherapy is active (objective response in 40 to 50% of patients; disease control in 75 to 80%), most patients have disease progression within approximately 9 months, and the median overall survival is 14 to 15 months with cisplatin-based regimens and 9 to 10 months with carboplatin-based regimens among patients who are not suitable candidates for cisplatin-based therapy. In several tumor types, maintenance therapy with an alternative agent after initial chemotherapy has been shown to prolong overall survival. However, trials exploring this approach in advanced urothelial carcinoma with the use of targeted therapies or conventional chemotherapies have not shown prolonged overall survival.
Urothelial carcinoma is characterized by genomic instability, high programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression, DNA damage-response mutations, and a high tumor mutational burden, which are features associated with an increased response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in several cancer types. Regulatory approvals of anti–PD-L1 and anti–PD-1 (anti–programmed cell death 1) antibodies have changed the treatment landscape for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, including those who have disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy, those who are not suitable candidates for first-line cisplatin-based therapy and have PD-L1–positive tumors, and those who are not suitable candidates for platinum-based therapy. Because chemotherapy has various immune-priming effects and depletes immunosuppressive cells, maintenance therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor after first-line chemotherapy may result in enhanced antitumor activity while avoiding potential interactions, including cross-resistance and cumulative toxicity. In a small, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial of maintenance pembrolizumab (an anti–PD-1 antibody) after chemotherapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, progression-free survival was longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group.
Avelumab is an anti–PD-L1 antibody that has been approved in several countries for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after disease progression during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, on the basis of results from a large, phase 1b cohort (involving 242 patients) in which an objective response was observed in 16.5% of the patients and the overall survival at 2 years was 20.1%. We hypothesized that avelumab maintenance therapy would improve outcomes in patients who had received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma.

Section: Methods

In the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial, we enrolled patients who had histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma; documented stage IV disease (according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer–International Union for Cancer Control tumor–node–metastasis system, 7th edition) that was measurable according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, before the receipt of first-line chemotherapy; no disease progression (i.e., an ongoing complete response, partial response, or stable disease) after the receipt of four to six cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin; and a treatment-free interval of 4 to 10 weeks since the last dose of chemotherapy. Other key inclusion criteria were an age of 18 years or more; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers indicating greater disability); a recently obtained or archival tumor specimen; and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Key exclusion criteria were the receipt of adjuvant or neoadjuvant systemic therapy within the preceding 12 months and a contraindication for or previous exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Full eligibility criteria are provided in the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
In this international, open-label, phase 3 trial, patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive either maintenance therapy with avelumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously every 2 weeks) plus best supportive care (avelumab group) or best supportive care alone (control group). To mitigate the occurrence of infusion-related reactions, an antihistamine and acetaminophen were administered approximately 30 to 60 minutes before the first four avelumab infusions. Best supportive care was administered according to local practice on the basis of the clinical judgment and the patient’s condition and included antibiotic agents, nutritional support, hydration, and pain management; other systemic antitumor therapy was not permitted, but palliative local radiotherapy for isolated lesions was acceptable.
Randomization was stratified according to the best response to first-line chemotherapy (complete or partial response vs. stable disease) and to the metastatic site when first-line chemotherapy was initiated (visceral vs. nonvisceral). The nonvisceral-site stratum included patients with unresectable locally advanced disease in addition to those with only nonvisceral disease, including bone metastasis. Patients continued treatment until disease progression, an unacceptable level of toxic effects, withdrawal of consent, or any other criterion for withdrawal occurred. Reductions in the avelumab dose were not permitted, but subsequent infusions could be omitted because of persisting adverse events. The primary objective of the trial was to assess the benefit of maintenance avelumab therapy over control therapy in prolonging overall survival among all the patients who had undergone randomization (overall population) and among patients with PD-L1–positive tumors (PD-L1–positive population).
The trial was conducted in accordance with the ethics principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines defined by the International Council for Harmonisation. All the patients provided written informed consent. The trial protocol and amendments were approved by an institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each participating center. An independent data and safety monitoring committee periodically reviewed safety data and reviewed the results of the interim analysis.
The trial was sponsored by Pfizer as part of an alliance between Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and Pfizer. All the authors attest that they had access to the data and that they participated in the writing, reviewing, and editing of the manuscript. A professional medical writer funded by the sponsors assisted with manuscript preparation. The first author had final responsibility for the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol and the statistical analysis plan.
The primary end point was overall survival, which was assessed in both the overall population and the PD-L1–positive population. The inclusion of two primary populations was based on observations from previous studies of avelumab and other similar agents used as second-line treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma, which suggested that response was higher among patients with PD-L1–positive tumor cells or immune cells than among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors.
Secondary end points included progression-free survival, objective response (complete response or partial response, according to RECIST, version 1.1, as recorded from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause), time to response, duration of response, disease control (defined as complete response, partial response, non–complete response or non–progressive disease, or stable disease for ≥6 weeks, according to RECIST, version 1.1, as recorded from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause) as determined on the basis of blinded independent central review, and safety. Tumors were assessed according to RECIST, version 1.1. Imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed every 8 weeks for 12 months and then every 12 weeks until confirmed disease progression. Imaging of the head at baseline was required in patients with a history of brain metastases or in whom brain metastases were suspected. Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.
PD-L1 expression was assessed in tumor samples by means of the Ventana PD-L1 assay (SP263, Ventana Medical Systems). Patients were classified as having PD-L1–positive status if at least one of the following three criteria were met: at least 25% of tumor cells stained for PD-L1, at least 25% of immune cells stained for PD-L1 if more than 1% of the tumor area contained immune cells, or 100% of immune cells stained for PD-L1 if no more than 1% of the tumor area contained immune cells.
We estimated that 668 patients, including 334 patients (50%) with PD-L1–positive tumors, would undergo randomization. A one-sided test was performed against the null hypothesis that avelumab plus best supportive care would not be superior to best supportive care alone. The type I error rate was maintained at or below the one-sided level of 0.025 by allocating an alpha of 0.015 to the overall survival comparison in the overall population and an alpha of 0.01 to the overall survival comparison in the PD-L1–positive population. A two-look, group-sequential design with a Lan–DeMets (O’Brien–Fleming) alpha-spending function was used to preserve the overall type I error rate and determine efficacy boundaries.
The trial was to be considered to be positive if the stratified log-rank test for overall survival was significant in either primary population. For the primary analysis of overall survival in the overall population, we estimated that 425 deaths would provide the trial with 93% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7, using a one-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.015. For the primary analysis of overall survival in the PD-L1–positive population, we estimated that 219 deaths would provide the trial with 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.65 using a one-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 0.01. The protocol prespecified the reporting of one-sided P values, but, in accordance with Journal policy, two-sided P values are reported.
An interim analysis was planned after 74% and 66.7% of the target events (deaths) were estimated to have occurred in the overall population and the PD-L1–positive population, respectively. Results of the interim analysis were reviewed on December 20, 2019, by the independent data and safety monitoring committee, which reported that the efficacy boundaries for overall survival in the overall population and the PD-L1–positive population (P<0.0053 and P<0.0014, respectively) had been crossed. Data from the interim analysis are reported, but since the efficacy boundaries were crossed, this report represents the final analysis.
Efficacy end points were assessed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Safety was assessed in all the patients who received at least one dose of avelumab in the avelumab group and in all the patients who completed the cycle 1, day 1, visit in the control group (safety population). Overall survival and progression-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. To account for the group-sequential design, two-sided repeated confidence intervals were constructed for the hazard ratio in the analysis of overall survival, and unadjusted 95% confidence intervals were also reported. Exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals for objective response according to treatment group were calculated by the Clopper–Pearson method. Stratified odds ratios for objective response were calculated by the Mantel–Haenszel method, which is analogous to logistic regression.

Section: Results

Between May 11, 2016, and June 4, 2019, a total of 700 patients were enrolled at 197 sites in 29 countries. Patients were randomly assigned to receive best supportive care either with avelumab (avelumab group; 350 patients) or without avelumab (control group; 350 patients) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). A total of 358 patients (51.1%) had PD-L1–positive tumors. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were balanced between the two treatment groups and between the overall population and the PD-L1–positive population ( Table 1 and Table S1). Among patients with tumors that could be evaluated for PD-L1 status, tumors were PD-L1–positive in 189 of 328 patients (57.6%) in the avelumab group and in 169 of 300 patients (56.3%) in the control group.
At data cutoff on October 21, 2019, a total of 85 patients (24.3%) in the avelumab group and 26 patients (7.4%) in the control group were still receiving trial treatment. The most common reasons for permanent discontinuation of treatment were progressive disease (in 189 patients in the avelumab group [54.0%] and 263 in the control group [75.1%]), adverse events (in 39 [11.1%] and 2 [0.6%], respectively), withdrawal of consent (in 16 [4.6%] and 29 [8.3%]), and death (in 5 [1.4%] and 14 [4.0%]) (Fig. S1). In the overall population, a subsequent anticancer drug therapy was received by 148 patients (42.3%) in the avelumab group and by 216 patients (61.7%) in the control group, including an anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 antibody in 22 patients (6.3%) in the avelumab group and in 153 patients (43.7%) in the control group (Table S2). The median follow-up for overall survival was more than 19 months in each treatment group.
In the overall population, overall survival was significantly longer in the avelumab group than in the control group. Overall survival at 1 year (measured from randomization) was 71.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.0 to 76.0) in the avelumab group, as compared with 58.4% (95% CI, 52.7 to 63.7) in the control group; the median overall survival was 21.4 months (95% CI, 18.9 to 26.1) and 14.3 months (95% CI, 12.9 to 17.9), respectively (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.86; repeated CI, 0.54 to 0.92; P=0.001) ( Figure 1A ).
In the PD-L1–positive population, overall survival was also significantly longer in the avelumab group than in the control group. The overall survival at 1 year was 79.1% (95% CI, 72.1 to 84.5) in the avelumab group, as compared with 60.4% (95% CI, 52.0 to 67.7) in the control group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.79; repeated CI, 0.39 to 0.94; P<0.001) ( Figure 1B ).
Overall survival in protocol-specified subgroups in the overall population is shown in Figure S2. Among patients with PD-L1–negative tumors, the median overall survival was 18.8 months (95% CI, 13.3 to 22.5) in the avelumab group and 13.7 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 17.8) in the control group (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.18) (Fig. S3A). In a stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis that was performed in the overall population, the overall survival benefit with avelumab therapy as compared with control therapy, after adjustment for relevant baseline factors of potential prognostic effect, was consistent with the primary results (Table S3).
Progression-free survival was longer in the avelumab group than in the control group in both primary populations. In the overall population, the median progression-free survival was 3.7 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 5.5) in the avelumab group and 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.7) in the control group (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.75) ( Figure 2A ). In the PD-L1–positive population, the median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 7.4) in the avelumab group and 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 3.5) in the control group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.73) ( Figure 2B ).
Progression-free survival in protocol-specified subgroups is shown in Figure S4. In patients with PD-L1–negative tumors, the median progression-free survival was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.0 to 3.7) in the avelumab group and 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) in the control group (stratified hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.85) (Fig. S3B). Response data are shown in Table 2 .
Among all treated patients, the median duration of trial treatment was 24.9 weeks (range, 2.0 to 159.9) in the avelumab group and 13.1 weeks (range, 0.1 to 155.6) in the control group. Adverse events of any grade occurred in 337 of 344 patients (98.0%) in the avelumab group and in 268 of 345 patients (77.7%) in the control group, with adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurring in 163 patients (47.4%) and 87 patients (25.2%), respectively ( Table 3 and Table S4). Serious adverse events are summarized in Table S5. In the avelumab group, adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 41 patients (11.9%). Adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to treatment are listed in Table S6.
Death was attributed by the investigator to the toxicity of trial treatment in two patients (0.6%) in the avelumab group. One patient had sepsis after a urinary tract infection and possible central venous catheter infection after receiving 11 infusions of avelumab. The other patient had an ischemic stroke 100 days after receiving a single dose of avelumab and after disease progression and adverse events of limb venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and acute myocardial infarction.
Among the avelumab-treated patients, 101 (29.4%) had an adverse event that was categorized as being immune-related according to a prespecified case definition, including 24 patients (7.0%) with a grade 3 event (Table S7). No grade 4 or fatal immune-related adverse events occurred. The most frequent category of immune-related adverse events was thyroid disorders, which occurred in 42 patients (12.2%). High-dose glucocorticoids (≥40 mg total daily dose of prednisone or equivalent) were administered after an immune-related adverse event in 31 patients (9.0%) who received avelumab.

Section: Discussion

This phase 3 trial showed that patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who had disease that had not progressed with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy had significantly longer overall survival with maintenance avelumab therapy than with best supportive care alone; this finding applied to both the overall population and the PD-L1–positive population. Patients in the avelumab group also had longer progression-free survival than patients in the control group. Overall survival was longer in the avelumab group despite the more frequent use of subsequent treatment in the control group (in 61.7% of patients), including immune checkpoint inhibitors (in 43.7%), a finding that highlights the benefit of starting avelumab immediately after first-line chemotherapy instead of waiting for disease progression. Furthermore, separation of the overall survival curves and the progression-free survival curves in favor of avelumab occurred early in the course of treatment and was maintained, which suggests that so-called hyperprogression (a potential and unexpected deleterious effect of treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor in which tumors would paradoxically progress faster than if they were untreated) did not occur with avelumab maintenance therapy in patients with advanced urothelial cancer. As expected, there was a higher incidence of adverse events in the avelumab group (active treatment) than in the control group (no active treatment), with adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurring in 47.4% and 25.2% of the patients, respectively. However, no new safety signals were identified, and 11.9% of the patients receiving maintenance avelumab discontinued the therapy because of adverse events.
The clinical usefulness of PD-L1 as a biomarker in advanced urothelial carcinoma is an area of uncertainty. PD-L1 expression in tumor or immune cells, detected by means of the Ventana SP142 and Agilent–Dako 22C3 assays, appears to be predictive of outcomes with first-line checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma. PD-L1 expression appears to be prognostic in the context of second-line therapy. In this trial, we used the Ventana SP263 assay, which shows PD-L1 staining that is highly concordant with the Agilent–Dako 22C3 assay; however, because of their different manufacturer-specified algorithms, the SP263 assay classifies a higher proportion of samples as PD-L1–positive. In our trial, the overall survival benefit with avelumab as compared with control was somewhat greater in the PD-L1–positive population than in the overall population, but the result was significant in both populations. Furthermore, in the control group, the median overall survival was longer in the PD-L1–positive population (17.1 months) than in the overall population (14.3 months), a finding that suggests that PD-L1 expression may not be an indicator of worse prognosis in this population of patients who have disease control after chemotherapy. Further biomarker development in this context of the disease, including exploration of composite biomarker panels, may identify subgroups of patients with differences in clinical benefit.
Maintenance treatment with avelumab after chemotherapy is an extension of first-line treatment. The efficacy seen in the avelumab group may be due in part to maintenance treatment being administered only to patients with disease control; therefore, patients with rapidly progressive disease during first-line chemotherapy, which might be refractory to immunotherapy, were not included. However, these patients were not enrolled in either trial group, so no bias was introduced, and further studies to characterize patients with rapidly progressive (primary resistant) disease will be useful.
Several other phase 3 trials are exploring immune checkpoint inhibitors as first-line treatment for advanced urothelial carcinoma using different approaches (DANUBE [ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02516241 ]), KEYNOTE-361 [ NCT02853305 ], CheckMate901 [ NCT03036098 ], NILE [ NCT03682068 ], LEAP-011 [ NCT03898180 ], and EV-302 [ NCT04223856 ]). Interim data have been reported from the IMvigor130 trial of first-line atezolizumab administered either concomitantly with platinum-based chemotherapy or as monotherapy, as compared with chemotherapy plus placebo, in patients with advanced disease. A final progression-free survival analysis showed a significant advantage with the combination therapy over placebo plus chemotherapy (median, 8.2 months vs. 6.3 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.96), whereas an interim overall survival analysis did not reach the prespecified threshold for significance (median, 16.0 months vs. 13.4 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.00); the trial is ongoing until the final planned overall survival analysis. In both the JAVELIN Bladder 100 and IMvigor130 trials, immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment was continued until disease progression or until an unacceptable level of toxic effects occurred. In our trial, the overall survival benefit with avelumab maintenance therapy was similar in patients who had received first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin-based treatment and in those who had received carboplatin-based treatment. In the subgroup analysis of the IMvigor130 trial, overall survival appeared to be longer among patients who received atezolizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy (median, 21.7 months, vs. 13.4 months in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.94) than among those who received atezolizumab plus carboplatin-based chemotherapy (median, 14.2 months, vs. 13.4 months in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.14). Final results from this and other ongoing large, randomized trials in advanced urothelial carcinoma are awaited.
We found that first-line maintenance avelumab therapy in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma with disease that had not progressed with platinum-based chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than best supportive care alone.
