Title: Two Phase 3 Trials of Baricitinib for Alopecia Areata


Abstract: Abstract


Abstract_Section: Background

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition characterized by rapid hair loss in the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes, for which treatments are limited. Baricitinib, an oral, selective, reversible inhibitor of Janus kinases 1 and 2, may interrupt cytokine signaling implicated in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata.

Abstract_Section: Methods

We conducted two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials (BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2) involving adults with severe alopecia areata with a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 50 or higher (range, 0 [no scalp hair loss] to 100 [complete scalp hair loss]). Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2:2 ratio to receive once-daily baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg, baricitinib at a dose of 2 mg, or placebo. The primary outcome was a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36.

Abstract_Section: Results

We enrolled 654 patients in the BRAVE-AA1 trial and 546 in the BRAVE-AA2 trial. The estimated percentage of patients with a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36 was 38.8% with 4-mg baricitinib, 22.8% with 2-mg baricitinib, and 6.2% with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and 35.9%, 19.4%, and 3.3%, respectively, in BRAVE-AA2. In BRAVE-AA1, the difference between 4-mg baricitinib and placebo was 32.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.6 to 39.5), and the difference between 2-mg baricitinib and placebo was 16.6 percentage points (95% CI, 9.5 to 23.8) (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). In BRAVE-AA2, the corresponding values were 32.6 percentage points (95% CI, 25.6 to 39.6) and 16.1 percentage points (95% CI, 9.1 to 23.2) (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). Secondary outcomes for baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg but not at a dose of 2 mg generally favored baricitinib over placebo. Acne, elevated levels of creatine kinase, and increased levels of low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were more common with baricitinib than with placebo.

Abstract_Section: Conclusions

In two phase 3 trials involving patients with severe alopecia areata, oral baricitinib was superior to placebo with respect to hair regrowth at 36 weeks. Longer trials are required to assess the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for alopecia areata.

Section: Introduction

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder characterized by nonscarring hair loss that can affect any hair-bearing site. The disorder causes emotional and psychosocial distress. Mild episodes with a duration of less than 12 months may resolve spontaneously, but extensive alopecia areata is unlikely to remit without treatment. Current treatments — including glucocorticoids (topical, intralesional, and systemic), other immunosuppressive agents, and contact immunotherapy — have variable efficacy for severe disease and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
The pathogenesis of alopecia areata involves genetic and immune factors. Cytokines that are implicated in pathogenesis, including interferon-γ and interleukin-15, depend on Janus kinases (JAKs) for intracellular signaling. Previous reports have indicated that JAK inhibitors may reverse hair loss in patients with alopecia areata. The oral, selective, and reversible JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib, administered at a dose of 4 mg or 2 mg once daily, was reported to be superior to placebo with respect to hair regrowth after 36 weeks of treatment in a phase 2 trial involving adults with severe alopecia areata. We conducted two phase 3 randomized trials of baricitinib for alopecia areata, BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2.

Section: Methods

BRAVE-AA1 and BRAVE-AA2 are double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials conducted at 169 centers in 10 countries. BRAVE-AA1 was an adaptive phase 2–3 trial ; the results of the phase 3 portion are included here. The trials have identical eligibility criteria and identical primary and key secondary outcomes for the 36-week placebo-controlled treatment periods. In the BRAVE-AA1 phase 3 portion and BRAVE-AA2, the first patients began receiving baricitinib or placebo in March 2019 and July 2019 in the respective trials, and the last patients began receiving baricitinib or placebo in June 2020 and May 2020, respectively. None of the patients who were enrolled in the phase 2 cohort are included in the phase 3 cohort.
The trials were designed by the sponsor, Eli Lilly, and an advisory board including an author not employed by Eli Lilly (the first author). Eli Lilly or its representatives provided baricitinib and placebo, analyzed the data, performed laboratory testing, monitored the trial sites, and paid for professional medical writing. The authors who participated in planning the trials, analyzing the data, and writing the manuscript are listed in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trials to the protocols (available at NEJM.org). The investigators had confidentiality agreements with the sponsor. The trials were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the trial protocols were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each center. All the patients provided written informed consent for participation in the trials.
Male patients were 18 to 60 years of age, and female patients were 18 to 70 years of age (upper age thresholds were used to limit the risk of inclusion of patients with extensive androgenetic alopecia). Recruitment was performed by clinicians at the trial sites and by means of advertisements. Among the inclusion criteria were a Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score of 50 or higher (range, 0 to 100, with 0 representing no scalp hair loss and 100 complete scalp hair loss) and a current episode of alopecia areata lasting more than 6 months to less than 8 years, without spontaneous improvement (≤10-point reduction in the SALT score) during the previous 6 months. Patients with episodes lasting at least 8 years were permitted to enroll only if episodes of hair regrowth, spontaneous or while receiving treatment, were observed on the affected areas of the scalp during the past 8 years. Patients were excluded if they had “diffuse” pattern alopecia areata or other forms of alopecia. Patients who had been treated with the following agents were excluded: topical glucocorticoids on the scalp or eyebrows within 1 week before randomization, systemic or intralesional glucocorticoids (including intraarticular injections) within 8 weeks before randomization, and topical or oral JAK inhibitors within 4 or 8 weeks, respectively, before randomization. Patients who had had an inadequate response to oral JAK inhibitors after at least 12 weeks of treatment were excluded. Additional eligibility details are listed in the Supplementary Appendix and the trial protocols.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2:2 ratio to receive once-daily oral baricitinib at a dose of 4 mg, baricitinib at a dose of 2 mg, or placebo for 36 weeks (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ). Randomization was performed by a computer-generated random sequence with the use of an interactive Web-response system and was stratified according to geographic region (North America, Asia, or rest of the world) and duration of current episode (<4 years or ≥4 years). A double-dummy design was used to conceal the trial-group assignments from the patients and investigators. Throughout each trial, patients were prohibited from using other treatments for alopecia areata, including but not limited to systemic, intralesional, and injected glucocorticoids; other systemic immunosuppressants; topical therapies; phototherapy; platelet-rich plasma; and statins. Topical glucocorticoids were allowed except on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids. Treatment with finasteride (or other 5α-reductase inhibitors) and with oral or topical minoxidil was permitted if patients had been receiving a stable dose for 12 months before randomization and were anticipated to continue receiving a stable dose until week 36. Treatment of eyelids with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution was permitted if patients had been receiving a stable dose for at least 8 weeks before randomization.
The primary outcome was a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36. A SALT score of 20 or less has been identified as a meaningful treatment outcome for patients with severe alopecia areata. There were 10 key secondary outcomes analyzed in a graphical scheme as summarized in the statistical analysis plans (available with the protocols): a Scalp Hair Assessment Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) score of 0 or 1 (0 to 20% of scalp is missing hair) with a decrease (improvement) of at least 2 points from baseline at week 36 (among patients with a baseline score of ≥3 [with 3 indicating 50 to 94% of scalp is missing hair and 4 indicating 95 to 100% of scalp is missing hair]) ; a Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss score of 0 or 1 (full eyebrow coverage or minimal gaps) with a decrease (improvement) of at least 2 points from baseline at week 36 (among patients with a baseline score of ≥2 [with 2 indicating significant gaps and 3 no notable eyebrows]) ; a ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss score of 0 or 1 (full eyelash coverage or minimal gaps) with a decrease (improvement) of at least 2 points from baseline at week 36 (among patients with a baseline score of ≥2 [with 2 indicating significant gaps and 3 no notable eyelashes]) ; the percent change from baseline in the SALT score at week 36; a SALT score of 10 or less at week 36; a decrease (improvement) of at least 90% from baseline in the SALT score (SALT 90 ) at week 36; a SALT score of 20 or less at week 24; a SALT score of 10 or less at week 24; a decrease (improvement) of at least 50% from baseline in the SALT score (SALT 50 ) at week 12; and a SALT score of 20 or less at week 16. (For details on the ClinRO and PRO measures, see Table S1.) Additional secondary outcomes that were not analyzed in a statistical graphical plan are listed in Table S7.
Clinical laboratory tests, the taking of vital signs, and other safety assessments were conducted at scheduled visits. The incidence and severity of adverse events were recorded at each visit. Reporting of adverse events and their severity was based on the investigator’s subjective assessment. An independent data and safety monitoring committee regularly reviewed data. Deaths, cerebrocardiovascular events, and arterial and venous thromboembolic events were adjudicated by an independent clinical end-point committee whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments.
Both trials were planned to achieve 90% power to test the superiority of either baricitinib dose to placebo for the primary outcome, under the assumption of response rates of 30%, 20%, and 5% for 4-mg baricitinib, 2-mg baricitinib, and placebo, respectively. Primary and key secondary outcome testing was adjusted for multiple comparisons by graphical testing schemes to control the overall familywise type I error at a two-sided 5% significance level (Figs. S2 and S3). After the results of BRAVE-AA2 were known, the order of the key secondary outcomes in the graphical testing scheme for BRAVE-AA1 was changed to reflect the data obtained from BRAVE-AA2. Differences in outcomes between the two baricitinib dose groups were not analyzed.
Efficacy analyses included all the patients who had undergone randomization, independent of whether they received the assigned regimen (intention-to-treat analysis). Treatment comparisons of categorical and continuous outcomes were analyzed with the use of logistic regression and analysis of covariance, respectively, with geographic region, duration of current episode at baseline (<4 years or ≥4 years), baseline value, and trial group as factors. A logistic-regression model for the primary analysis was an adequate fit to the data (P>0.05).
The safety analysis included all the patients who had undergone randomization and had received at least one dose of baricitinib or placebo and who did not discontinue for the reason “lost to follow-up” at the first postbaseline visit. Fisher’s exact tests were used for all adverse events, discontinuations, and other categorical safety data. Continuous safety data were analyzed with an analysis-of-covariance model with adjustment for trial group and baseline value.
For categorical efficacy analyses, patients were considered to have not had a response if they did not meet clinical response criteria. For data missing owing to the patient’s permanent discontinuation of the trial regimen, discontinuation from the trial at any point, or censoring if data were collected remotely owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic (Table S5), multiple imputation was applied with 100 imputations generated with the use of the regression method, with the response at previous postbaseline visits, baseline covariates, and trial group as covariates in SAS Enterprise Guide 7.12. Multiple imputation was applied ad hoc to be consistent with Journal statistical standards. The results of the prespecified analyses in which nonresponse was imputed for missing data are provided in Figures S4 and S5 and Table S6. In the analyses of covariance of continuous outcomes, the results in which multiple imputation was used to handle missing data are provided below, and the results in which the modified last-observation-carried-forward approach was used to handle missing data (with imputation using the most recent nonmissing data from a postbaseline assessment, as prespecified in the statistical analysis plans) are provided in Figures S4 and S5 and Table S6.

Section: Results

In the BRAVE-AA1 phase 3 portion and BRAVE-AA2, 654 and 546 patients, respectively, were randomly assigned to a trial group, and 598 (91.4%) and 490 (89.7%), respectively, completed 36 weeks of baricitinib or placebo (Figs. S6 and S7). The planned sample size was 625 for BRAVE-AA1 and 476 for BRAVE-AA2; however, to mitigate against dropout and potential missing data amid the Covid-19 pandemic, additional patients were permitted to be enrolled. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar across the groups in both trials ( Table 1 ). Overall, 98 of 1200 enrolled patients (8.2%) were Black; the representativeness of the trial populations is shown in Table S2, and race and ethnic groups are shown in Table S3. The mean (±SD) duration of the current episode of alopecia areata was 3.6±3.9 years in BRAVE-AA1 and 4.3±4.9 years in BRAVE-AA2. Overall, 53.2% of the patients had very severe disease as reflected by a SALT score of 95 to 100; 90.6% reported at least one previous therapy for alopecia areata (Table S4). Approximately 10 to 15% of data for primary and secondary outcomes were missing and were analyzed with multiple imputation; there were generally more missing data in the baricitinib group than in the placebo group in both trials.
The percentages of patients who had a SALT score of 20 or less at week 36, estimated from multiple imputation for missing data, were 38.8% with 4-mg baricitinib, 22.8% with 2-mg baricitinib, and 6.2% with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and 35.9%, 19.4%, and 3.3%, respectively, in BRAVE-AA2 ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). In BRAVE-AA1, the difference between 4-mg baricitinib and placebo was 32.6 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.6 to 39.5), and the difference between 2-mg baricitinib and placebo was 16.6 percentage points (95% CI, 9.5 to 23.8) (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). In BRAVE-AA2, the corresponding values were 32.6 percentage points (95% CI, 25.6 to 39.6) and 16.1 percentage points (95% CI, 9.1 to 23.2) (P<0.001 for each dose vs. placebo). Outcomes after imputation of nonresponse was applied to missing data, as prespecified in the original statistical analysis plans, are shown in Table S6.
In BRAVE-AA1, the results with 4-mg baricitinib differed significantly from those with placebo for all outcomes within the graphical testing scheme ( Table 2 and Figure 2 ). For 2-mg baricitinib, the graphical testing procedure failed at a SALT score of 20 or less at week 16, and the subsequent outcome in the graphical testing scheme that did not pass statistical testing was a ClinRO Measure for Eyelash Hair Loss score of 0 or 1 with a decrease of at least 2 points from baseline at week 36.
In BRAVE-AA2, the results with 4-mg baricitinib differed significantly from those with placebo for the first seven secondary outcomes but failed for a SALT score of 10 or less at week 24, and the subsequent two secondary outcomes did not pass statistical testing. For 2-mg baricitinib, the graphical testing procedure failed at a ClinRO Measure for Eyebrow Hair Loss at week 36, and the results for the subsequent eight outcomes did not differ significantly from those with placebo. Secondary outcomes not included within the graphical testing scheme and not adjusted for multiple comparisons are shown in Table S7.
Adverse events that emerged or worsened during the treatment period were reported in 167 of 280 patients (59.6%) with 4-mg baricitinib, 93 of 183 (50.8%) with 2-mg baricitinib, and 97 of 189 (51.3%) with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and in 154 of 233 patients (66.1%), 106 of 155 (68.4%), and 97 of 154 (63.0%), respectively, in BRAVE-AA2 ( Table 3 ). Investigators assessed most events as being mild or moderate in severity, but there was no independent adjudication of severity and no scale or measure for severity in the protocols. The percentages of patients who discontinued the trial regimen because of adverse events were low and were similar across the trial groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 6 of 280 patients (2.1%) with 4-mg baricitinib, 4 of 183 (2.2%) with 2-mg baricitinib, and 3 of 189 (1.6%) with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and in 8 of 233 patients (3.4%), 4 of 155 (2.6%), and 3 of 154 (1.9%), respectively, in BRAVE-AA2 ( Table 3 and Table S8). Acne was more common with baricitinib than with placebo, occurring in 16 of 280 patients (5.7%) with 4-mg baricitinib, 10 of 183 (5.5%) with 2-mg baricitinib, and 1 of 189 (0.5%) with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and in 11 of 233 patients (4.7%), 9 of 155 (5.8%), and 3 of 154 (1.9%), respectively, in BRAVE-AA2. The incidence of urinary tract infection was higher with baricitinib than with placebo in BRAVE-AA2, with such infection occurring in 11 of 233 patients (4.7%) with 4-mg baricitinib, 12 of 155 (7.7%) with 2-mg baricitinib, and 2 of 154 (1.3%) with placebo.
Infections were reported in 88 of 280 patients (31.4%) with 4-mg baricitinib, 46 of 183 (25.1%) with 2-mg baricitinib, and 53 of 189 (28.0%) with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and in 69 of 233 patients (29.6%), 58 of 155 (37.4%), and 45 of 154 (29.2%), respectively, in BRAVE-AA2 ( Table 3 ). Herpes zoster infections — occurring in 2 of 280 patients (0.7%) with 4-mg baricitinib, 1 of 183 (0.5%) with 2-mg baricitinib, and 1 of 189 (0.5%) with placebo in BRAVE-AA1 and in 3 of 233 patients (1.3%), 3 of 155 (1.9%), and 1 of 154 (0.6%), respectively, in BRAVE-AA2 — were localized with no disseminated infections ( Table 3 ). Serious infections included one case of Covid-19 pneumonia and one case of pyelonephritis with 2-mg baricitinib and one case of pyelonephritis with 4-mg baricitinib in BRAVE-AA2 (Table S8). There were no venous thromboembolic events, opportunistic infections, or gastrointestinal perforations in either trial. In BRAVE-AA1, a myocardial infarction occurred in a patient who received 2-mg baricitinib and had cardiovascular risk factors. In BRAVE-AA2, one case of B-cell lymphoma was reported in a patient who received 4-mg baricitinib, and one case of prostate cancer was reported in a patient who received placebo.
Changes in laboratory values are summarized in Table S9. One case of grade 4 anemia (defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, as a hemoglobin level of <6.5 g per deciliter) occurred in a patient who received 4-mg baricitinib in BRAVE-AA1; the patient had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and discontinued the trial. Two cases of grade 4 neutropenia (neutrophil count, <500 cells per cubic millimeter) with each baricitinib dose in BRAVE-AA2 were one-time abnormalities in laboratory values; both recovered to normal levels, and the patients remained in the trial. Most other instances of reduced hemoglobin levels were grade 1 (10 to <12 g per deciliter for women and 10 to <13.5 g per deciliter for men); most instances of neutropenia were grade 1 (1500 to <2000 cells per cubic millimeter). Thrombocytosis in one patient who received 2-mg baricitinib and in two patients who received 4-mg baricitinib in BRAVE-AA1 represented a one-time platelet elevation of more than 600 billion per liter; all three patients recovered without treatment and remained in the trial. In both trials, elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were observed in approximately 25% and 40% of patients in the baricitinib groups, respectively, and an elevated creatine kinase level to more than 5 times the upper limit of the normal range was observed in small percentages of patients in the baricitinib groups.

Section: Discussion

Because JAKs play roles in intracellular signaling of cytokines involved in the immunopathogenesis of alopecia areata, JAK inhibitors are being investigated as therapies for this disorder. Oral JAK inhibitors have shown efficacy in phase 2 trials and small clinical studies involving patients with alopecia areata. In the current trials involving adults with severe alopecia areata, baricitinib was superior to placebo with respect to hair regrowth at 36 weeks, with higher percentages of patients having a SALT score of 20 or less with 4-mg baricitinib or 2-mg baricitinib than with placebo. Similar results were reported by patients through the Scalp Hair Assessment PRO instrument. Most patients in whom the primary outcome was met had SALT scores of 10 or less at week 36. The results for most key secondary outcomes with 4-mg baricitinib supported the results for the primary outcome, but the results for most key secondary outcomes with 2-mg baricitinib in the two trials did not support the results for the primary outcome. The hierarchical analysis for BRAVE-AA1 was changed on the basis of the results of BRAVE-AA2, which may limit conclusions with respect to secondary outcomes in BRAVE-AA1.
Common adverse events in both trials included acne, upper respiratory tract infections, headache, urinary tract infection, and elevated creatine kinase levels. Herpes zoster occurred in a low percentage of patients but was slightly more common among those who received baricitinib than among those who received placebo in BRAVE-AA2. Increases in the LDL cholesterol level were observed in approximately one quarter of the patients who received baricitinib, and increases in the HDL cholesterol level were observed in approximately 40% of patients who received baricitinib. Extension phases of the trials are ongoing because observations for adverse effects over longer periods of time are required.
Several groups of patients were excluded from the trials — specifically, patients with a previous inadequate response to oral JAK inhibitors and patients with an episode lasting at least 8 years without any hair regrowth. Therefore, the populations in the trials are selective, and whether these patients would have benefited or been harmed by baricitinib is unknown. In addition, although enrollment criteria limited the influence of androgenetic alopecia in the overall hair loss, it is possible that androgenetic alopecia has partially affected the assessment of disease severity and response to treatment. A small percentage (1.3%) of the patients used finasteride (or other 5α-reductase inhibitors) and oral or topical minoxidil treatment if they had been receiving a stable dose. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, some assessments were performed remotely and therefore were considered as being missing for the purpose of the analyses.
In these two phase 3 trials involving adults with severe alopecia areata, once-daily oral baricitinib was superior to placebo with respect to hair regrowth. Longer trials are necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of baricitinib for alopecia areata, and the current trials are ongoing and are planned to remain randomized and blinded for up to 200 weeks.
