Title: Two-component spike nanoparticle vaccine protects macaques from SARS-CoV-2 infection


Abstract: Summary

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is continuing to disrupt personal lives, global healthcare systems, and economies. Hence, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that prevents viral infection, transmission, and disease. Here, we present a two-component protein-based nanoparticle vaccine that displays multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Immunization studies show that this vaccine induces potent neutralizing antibody responses in mice, rabbits, and cynomolgus macaques. The vaccine-induced immunity protects macaques against a high-dose challenge, resulting in strongly reduced viral infection and replication in the upper and lower airways. These nanoparticles are a promising vaccine candidate to curtail the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Section: Introduction

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the globe and infected more than 100 million individuals since late 2019 ( https://covid19.who.int/ ). SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which manifests itself as a mild respiratory illness in most infected individuals but can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in a significant percentage of cases. As of February 1 st , 2021, COVID-19 has caused over 2 million casualties and continues to place a significant burden on healthcare systems and economies worldwide. Hence, the development of a safe and effective vaccine that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission has rapidly become a top priority.
Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers are an important immune correlate of protection ( Addetia et al., 2020 1. Addetia, A. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Dingens, A. ... Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate J. Clin.

DNA vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :806-811 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is supported by several passive immunization studies showing that administration of potent neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can significantly reduce lung viral loads ( Cao et al., 2020 11. Cao, Y. ∙ Su, B. ∙ Guo, X. ...

Isolation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and protection from disease in a small animal model Science. 2020; 369 :956-963 Crossref Scopus (891) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, a successful vaccine will likely need to induce a potent NAb response. The main target for NAbs on SARS-CoV-2 is the spike (S) protein. This homotrimeric glycoprotein is anchored in the viral membrane and consists of the S1 domain, which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the S2 domain, which contains the fusion peptide. Upon binding to ACE2, the prefusion S protein undergoes several structural changes that induce a shift to a postfusion state that enables merging of the viral envelope and host cell membrane ( Shang et al., 2020 55. Shang, J. ∙ Wan, Y. ∙ Luo, C. ... Cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :11727-11734 Crossref Scopus (2239) PubMed Google Scholar ). As most NAb epitopes are presented on the prefusion conformation, vaccine candidates should include the prefusion S protein, which, as for other class I viral fusion proteins ( Krarup et al., 2015 33. Krarup, A. ∙ Truan, D. ∙ Furmanova-Hollenstein, P. ... A highly stable prefusion RSV F vaccine derived from structural analysis of the fusion mechanism Nat.

More than 200 candidate vaccines are currently under preclinical or clinical evaluation, and several have been licensed ( https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines ). Recombinant subunit vaccines provide a welcome alternative to the inactivated, viral-vector- and RNA-based vaccines that are currently in phase 3 clinical trials or in use, as they have a track record of safety and efficacy. In addition, recombinantly expressed S proteins represent an efficient antigen to induce potent NAb responses, as recently reported in non-human primate studies ( Guebre-Xabier et al., 2020 22.

A well-established strategy to generate strong humoral immune responses against soluble antigens is multivalent antigen display ( Bachmann and Jennings, 2010 5. Bachmann, M.F. ∙ Jennings, G.T.

Nanoparticles presenting a high density of antigen on a repetitive array facilitate numerous immunological processes such as B cell activation, lymph node trafficking, and retention on follicular dendritic cells ( Kelly et al., 2019 29.

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers Science. 2019; 363 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (202) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the several nanoparticle designs that are currently being employed to present viral glycoproteins, self-assembling protein nanoparticle systems represent promising platforms, as they allow for efficient and scalable nanoparticle assembly ( López-Sagaseta et al., 2015 39.

J. 2015; 14 :58-68 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). Homomeric protein complexes such as the 24-subunit ferritin and 60-subunit mi3 nanoparticles self-assemble intracellularly and have been used to display immunogens such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA), HIV-1 Env, malaria cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA), and also SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD ( Bruun et al., 2018 10.

Recently, two-component 120-subunit icosahedral nanoparticles, such as the I53-50 and dn5 designs, have been developed that self-assemble in vitro , allowing for controlled nanoparticle formation. We and others have been using these nanoparticles to multivalently present trimeric type 1 viral fusion proteins of HIV-1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza ( Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020 7.

Induction of potent neutralizing antibody responses by a designed protein nanoparticle vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus Cell. 2019; 176 :1420-1431.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Presentation of these immunogens on two-component protein nanoparticles significantly improved NAb titers, which supports pursuing this platform for the generation of nanoparticle immunogens displaying prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S proteins.
Here, we describe the generation and characterization of two-component protein nanoparticles displaying stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Immunization studies in mice, rabbits, and macaques demonstrated that these nanoparticles induce robust humoral responses. Vaccinated macaques challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus had strongly reduced viral loads in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and developed fewer lung lesions when compared to unvaccinated animals.

Section: Results

The computationally designed I53-50 nanoparticle (I53-50NP) constitutes 20 trimeric (I53-50A or variants thereof) and 12 pentameric (I53-50B.4PT1) subunits that self-assemble to form monodisperse icosahedral particles with a diameter of ∼30 nm ( Bale et al., 2016 6. Bale, J.B. ∙ Gonen, S. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Accurate design of megadalton-scale two-component icosahedral protein complexes Science. 2016; 353 :389-394 Crossref Scopus (394) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate I53-50NPs presenting SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, we genetically fused the C terminus of the previously described stabilized prefusion S protein to the N terminus of the I53-50A variant, I53-50A.1NT1, using a glycine-serine linker ( Figure 1 A; Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ). The fusion protein was purified from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cell supernatant using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) purification followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Collection of the appropriate SEC fractions yielded ∼2 mg/L trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 fusion protein ( Figure 1 B). To initiate assembly of nanoparticles presenting SARS-CoV-2 S proteins (SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs), the pooled trimer fractions were incubated overnight at 4°C with I53-50B.4PT1 in an equimolar ratio. The nanoparticle preparation was further purified using an additional SEC step to remove unassembled components. Negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) of the pooled higher-molecular-weight fractions revealed a considerable portion of monodisperse and well-ordered icosahedral nanoparticles ( Figure 1 C). Biolayer interferometry (BLI)-based binding experiments with a panel of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific monoclonal NAbs, previously isolated from recovered COVID-19 patients ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed strong binding of RBD-specific COVA1-18, COVA2-02, COVA2-15, and COVA2-39 and N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific COVA1-22 to trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 and SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP ( Figure 1 D). This suggests that presentation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein on I53-50NPs did not compromise the structure of these S protein epitopes. Altogether, SEC, nsEM, and BLI confirmed the successful generation of nanoparticles presenting multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
As approximately one-third of the mass of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein consists of N-linked glycans, we sought to identify the site-specific glycosylation of S protein presented on I53-50NPs using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). All sites presented high levels of occupancy, with only N1074 displaying 15% of sites lacking an N-linked glycan ( Figure S1 A). The compositions of glycans present at the 19 N-linked glycan sites on the S protein were determined and revealed a diverse range of structures ( Figure S1 B). Underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans were observed at sites N61, N234, N717, and N801 and to a lesser extent at N1098. The average oligomannose-type glycan content across all sites was 11%. Processed complex-type glycans were observed at all sites and were highly fucosylated (73%) but mostly lacked sialylation (8%) ( Figures S1 A and S1B). The glycoforms present on SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs are more processed compared to other recombinant S protein immunogens ( Watanabe et al., 2020 70. Watanabe, Y. ∙ Allen, J.D. ∙ Wrapp, D. ... Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike Science. 2020; 369 :330-333 Crossref Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ) but are reminiscent of the composition on S proteins presented on virions ( Yao et al., 2020 73. Yao, H. ∙ Song, Y. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Molecular Architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus Cell. 2020; 183 :730-738.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Multivalent display of antigens can enhance cognate B cell activation over soluble antigen ( Antanasijevic et al., 2020 4. Antanasijevic, A. ∙ Ueda, G. ∙ Brouwer, P.J.M. ...

Commun. 2019; 10 :4272 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veneziano et al., 2020 66. Veneziano, R. ∙ Moyer, T.J. ∙ Stone, M.B. ... Role of nanoscale antigen organization on B-cell activation probed using DNA origami Nat. Nanotechnol. 2020; 15 :716-723 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess if the same would apply for SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs, we generated B cells that expressed B cell receptors (BCRs) for previously described RBD-targeting monoclonal NAbs and measured their activation by monitoring Ca 2+ influx in vitro ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ). Soluble trimers only weakly activated COVA1-18-expressing B cells at the highest concentration used (5 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1), while an equimolar amount of SARS-CoV-2 S presented on I53-50NPs efficiently activated the same B cells ( Figure 2 ). COVA2-15-expressing B cells were activated by soluble SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 trimers but markedly more efficiently so by SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP. The more efficient activation of COVA2-15-expressing B cells compared to those expressing COVA1-18 may be explained by the fact that COVA2-15 can interact with the RBD in both the up and down state, which may result in higher-avidity interactions ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ). In control experiments, I53-50NPs displaying soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (BG505 SOSIP) did not activate any of the B cell lines. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs improve the activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells compared to soluble trimers.
We assessed the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs in two small-animal models. Eight BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 μg SARS-CoV-2 S presented on I53-50NPs, adjuvanted in polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). In addition, five New Zealand white rabbits were immunized with 30 μg SARS-CoV-2 S presented on I53-50NPs, adjuvanted in squalene emulsion. Mice and rabbits received three subcutaneous and intramuscular immunizations, respectively, at weeks 0, 4, and 12 ( Figure 3 A). The adjuvants were chosen based on our previous positive experiences with them in the respective animal models.
Two weeks after the first immunization, mice and rabbits induced detectable SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a median endpoint binding titer of 2,920 and 5,105 respectively. In mice, median endpoint titers were further boosted after the second immunization to 57,943 at week 6 and slightly decreased after the third immunization to 47,643 at week 14 ( Figure 3 B). In rabbits, median endpoint titers were boosted to 544,503 at week 6 and 594,292 at week 14 ( Figure 3 C). Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was already detectable in the majority of mice and rabbit sera 2 weeks after the first immunization. NAb titers, which are represented by the inhibitory dilutions at which 50% neutralization is attained (ID 50 values), increased to a median of 16,792 at week 6 and 49,039 at week 14 in mice ( Figure 3 D; Table S1 ). In rabbits, NAb titers were boosted to a median ID 50 of 68,298 and 135,128 at weeks 6 and 14, respectively ( Figure 3 E; Table S1 ). Neutralization titers of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus at week 14 reached a median ID 50 of 4,065 and 15,110 in mice and rabbits, respectively ( Figures 3 D and 3E; Table S1 ). Collectively, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs were able to induce robust binding and NAb responses in both mice and rabbits after two and three immunizations.
The high binding and neutralization titers in mice and rabbits supported subsequent assessment of the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs in cynomolgus macaques, an animal model that is immunologically closer to humans. Six cynomolgus macaques were immunized with 50 μg SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs formulated in monophospholipid A (MPLA) liposomes by the intramuscular route at weeks 0, 4, and 10 ( Figure 4 A). The MPLA liposome adjuvant was chosen because it is used in several human clinical trials (e.g., NCT03816137, NCT03961438, and NCT04046978) and is a component of the widely used AS01 adjuvant, which was safe and effective in several phase 3 clinical trials ( Lal et al., 2018 34.

Med. 2012; 367 :2284-2295 Crossref Scopus (578) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To analyze the frequency of S protein and RBD-specific IgG-positive B cells in macaques after vaccination, peripheral blood mononuclear cells at week 12 were gated on the expression of CD20 and IgG and stained with fluorescently labeled prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein or RBD ( Figure 4 B). We observed a clear expansion of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific B cells by vaccination, which constituted on average ∼1% of total B cells ( Figure 4 C). Within the population of IgG-positive SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific B cells, on average, ∼30% bound to the RBD ( Figure 4 C). Within the CD27 + B cell population (marker for memory B cells), on average, 0.77% were SARS-CoV-2 S protein specific, of which, again, ∼30% were specific for the RBD ( Figure S2 ). In addition to B cells, SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific T cells were also markedly expanded, as determined by an enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay (ELISpot) ( Figure 4 D). Furthermore, we studied circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh cells), the circulating counterpart of germinal center Tfh cells ( Heit et al., 2017 25. Heit, A. ∙ Schmitz, F. ∙ Gerdts, S. ... Vaccination establishes clonal relatives of germinal center T cells in the blood of humans J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2139-2152 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vella et al., 2019 65. Vella, L.A. ∙ Buggert, M. ∙ Manne, S. ... T follicular helper cells in human efferent lymph retain lymphoid characteristics J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3185-3200 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed pronounced expansion of S-protein-specific cTfh cells (CD69 + CD154 + CXCR5 + ) within the CD4 + T cell subset, as determined by the activation-induced marker (AIM) assay ( Figures 4 E and S3 A–S3C). Within CD4 − T cells (CD8 + T cells by inference), a trend toward higher expansion of cells was observed in the vaccinated macaques ( Figure S3 D)
Sera of the immunized macaques exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific binding IgG responses with median endpoint titers of 211, 1,601 and 2,190, at weeks 2, 6, and 12, respectively ( Figure 5 A). To compare binding titers to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD between sera from vaccinated macaques and those from convalescent humans from the COVID-19 Specific Antibodies (COSCA) cohort (sampled ∼4 weeks after the onset of symptoms) ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ), a different ELISA protocol was used. Specifically, binding responses were compared to a standard curve of species-specific polyclonal IgG so that a semiquantitative measure of specific IgG concentrations could be obtained. Week 6 and 12 sera elicited markedly higher IgG binding titers to SARS-CoV-2 S protein than serum from convalescent humans ( Figure 5 B). This was also the case for RBD-specific binding titers ( Figure 5 C).
Using a custom Luminex-bead-based serological assay, we analyzed the induction of several Ig isotypes in serum, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva samples of the vaccinated macaques over time. S-protein-specific IgG levels in serum showed a similar course as observed by ELISA ( Figures 5 D and S4 A). This was also the case for IgA, albeit with a more rapid onset and waning after vaccination. As expected, IgM levels peaked after the first immunization and gradually waned thereafter, presumably as a result of Ig class switching ( Figures 5 D and S4 A). We also observed an increase in S-specific IgG and IgA levels in nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva after consecutive immunizations. This was particularly clear for IgG in nasopharyngeal swabs ( Figures 5 D and S4 B). The results in saliva samples were more variable ( Figures 5 D and S4 C). Thus, in addition to a systemic antibody response, SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs induced detectable mucosal IgA and IgG responses, a relevant finding considering that the respiratory mucosa is the first port of entry for SARS-CoV-2 ( Sungnak et al., 2020 59. Sungnak, W. ∙ Huang, N. ∙ Bécavin, C. ..., HCA Lung Biological Network SARS-CoV-2 entry factors are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells together with innate immune genes Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :681-687 Crossref Scopus (1803) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-specific serum antibodies to bind to immune proteins that play a role in Fc-mediated effector functions. The levels of FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa, and C1q binding tracked with IgG levels, suggesting that the induced IgGs can perform effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and complement activation ( Figure S4 D).
Serum neutralization titers in the vaccinated macaques were overall robust. Two weeks after the first immunization, macaques induced pseudovirus neutralization with a median ID 50 of 475. The second immunization increased the neutralization titers to a median ID 50 of 8,865, which then declined only modestly up to the third immunization. NAb titers were further increased to a median ID 50 of 26,361 at week 12 ( Figure 5 E; Table S2 ). At week 6, the neutralization titers were similar to those in sera from convalescent humans, but neutralization titers at week 12 were significantly higher in vaccinated macaques than convalescent humans (median ID 50 of 26,361 versus 8,226, p = 0.0012) ( Figure 5 F). Neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 was lower than that of pseudovirus but remained potent (median ID 50 of 1,501 and 3,942 at weeks 6 and 12, respectively) ( Figure 5 G; Table S2 ).
To assess the protective potential of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs, vaccinated macaques and contemporaneous control macaques (n = 4) were infected with a total dose of 1 × 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate (BetaCoV/France/IDF/0372/2020; passaged twice in VeroE6 cells) by combined intranasal (0.25 mL in each nostril) and intratracheal (4.5 mL in the trachea) routes at week 12, 2 weeks after the final immunization. This represents a high-dose challenge in comparison with other studies, where 10- to 100-fold lower doses were used ( van Doremalen et al., 2020 64. van Doremalen, N. ∙ Lambe, T. ∙ Spencer, A. ...

Control animals had high viral load levels in nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples (swabs), as assessed by qRT-PCR for viral RNA, as early as 1 day post-exposure (dpe). In tracheal samples, viral loads peaked between 1 and 3 dpe, with a median value of 6.9 log 10 copies/mL. Subsequently, viral loads progressively decreased, and all animals had undetectable viral loads by 14 dpe ( Figures 6 A and S5 ). Similar profiles were observed in nasopharyngeal swabs, although viral loads remained detectable in some macaques at 14 dpe ( Figures 6 A and S5 ). Viral loads were markedly lower in rectal samples but stayed above the limit of detection during the course of sampling for two out of four control macaques ( Figure S5 ). Viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), which is believed to reflect viral replication, peaked at 2 dpe in tracheal and nasopharyngeal swabs (median viral sgRNA load 4.8 and 6.1 log 10 ,respectively) and was still detectable (>2.5 log 10 copies/mL of viral sgRNA) at 5 and 6 dpe in the nasopharynx for three and two animals, respectively ( Figure 6 B).
In vaccinated macaques, median peak viral loads were 300-fold lower in tracheal samples (6.8 log 10 versus 4.3 log 10 ; p = 0.0095) and 500-fold lower in nasopharyngeal samples compared to unvaccinated controls (7.9 log 10 versus 5.2 log 10 ; p = 0.0095). With the exception of MF7, all vaccinated animals had undetectable loads at 6 dpe in tracheal and nasopharyngeal swabs ( Figures 6 A and S5 ). In addition to the upper airways, SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP vaccination significantly decreased viral loads in the lower airways, as demonstrated by a 275-fold lower median viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (6.5 log 10 versus 4.1 log 10 ; p = 0.0095). Viral replication was also significantly reduced in vaccinated animals. Only two out of six vaccinated animals (MF5 and MF6) showed detectable sgRNA in the trachea at 2 dpe, and median viral loads were 160-fold lower than in control animals (4.7 log 10 versus 2.5 log 10 ; p = 0.0095). In the nasopharynx, sgRNA remained below the limit of detection at any of the time points. At 2 dpe, median sgRNA loads in the vaccinated animals were 5,400-fold lower than in controls (6.2 log 10 versus 2.5 log 10 ; p = 0.0048) ( Figure 6 B). In BAL samples, we observed a 120-fold reduction of median sgRNA at day 3 dpe (4.6 log 10 versus 2.5 log 10 ; p = 0.0048) ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
An anamnestic response after challenge (i.e., an increase in NAb titers following challenge after vaccination) implies that vaccination is unable to induce sterilizing immunity. We observed no increase in median NAb titers in vaccinated macaques at 2, 3, and 6 weeks after challenge, in contrast to the control animals ( Figure S6 ). Instead, NAb titers generally continued to wane, suggesting that vaccine-induced immunity rapidly controlled infection following challenge, preventing a boost of the immune system.
To assess the potential emergence of viral escape mutants in macaques after challenge, viral RNA in the challenge inoculum, nasal swabs at 3 and 5 dpe, and in BAL at 3 dpe was sequenced. Two main viral variants were identified in the inoculum (V367F in the S protein and G251V in ORF3a), which were later also found in the nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL samples. A median of six subclonal mutations were found per sample over all corresponding time points and anatomical sites, but no major differences were observed between control and vaccinated animals ( Figure 6 C). The majority of the variants observed in ORF1ab were mostly missense mutations and consisted of a C > T nucleotide change ( Figure S6 D; Table S3 ). A distinct variant in the S sequence arose in two vaccinated macaques at day 3 in the nasopharyngeal swab but disappeared at day 5 post-challenge, suggesting that no NAb escape mutations emerged in vaccinated animals ( Figure 6 C).
Similar to previous observations ( Maisonnasse et al., 2020 41. Maisonnasse, P. ∙ Guedj, J. ∙ Contreras, V. ... Hydroxychloroquine use against SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates Nature. 2020; 585 :584-587 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2020 74. Yu, J. ∙ Tostanoski, L.H. ∙ Peter, L. ... DNA vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :806-811 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ), during the first 14 dpe, all contemporaneous and historical control animals showed mild pulmonary lesions characterized by nonextended ground-glass opacities (GGOs) detected by chest computed tomography (CT) ( Figure 6 D). By contrast, only three out of six vaccinated animals showed low CT scores characteristic of mild and nonextended GGOs. Of note, the vaccinated macaque (MF6) with the highest CT score at day 14 showed the lowest S protein and RBD binding titers, the lowest NAb titers, and the highest viral load and sgRNA at day 5 pe. Whereas all control animals experienced lymphopenia at 2 dpe, corresponding probably to the installation of the response to infection, lymphocyte counts remained stable after challenge for the vaccinated macaques ( Figures 6 E and S6 ), in agreement with the absence of detectable anamnestic response. Together, these data further support that vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs reduces the severity of infection.

Section: Discussion

The development and distribution of a protective vaccine is paramount to bring the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to a halt. Over the last few months, numerous vaccine candidates of different modalities have entered clinical and preclinical studies, including inactivated-virus-, DNA-, mRNA-, vector-, and protein-based vaccines ( Klasse et al., 2020 30. Klasse, P.J. ∙ Nixon, D.F. ∙ Moore, J.P. Immunogenicity of clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in non-human primates and humans Preprints. 2020; 2020090166 Google Scholar ). Multivalent presentation of RSV and influenza antigens on two-component self-assembling protein nanoparticles has generated remarkably potent immune responses in non-human primates ( Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020 7. Boyoglu-Barnum, S. ∙ Ellis, D. ∙ Gillespie, R.A. ... Elicitation of broadly protective immunity to influenza by multivalent hemagglutinin nanoparticle vaccines bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marcandalli et al., 2019 42. Marcandalli, J. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Ols, S. ... Induction of potent neutralizing antibody responses by a designed protein nanoparticle vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus Cell. 2019; 176 :1420-1431.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, I53-50NPs presenting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 induced potent NAb titers and significantly decreased viral loads in humanized mice ( Walls et al., 2020b 68. Walls, A.C. ∙ Fiala, B. ∙ Schäfer, A. ... Elicitation of potent neutralizing antibody responses by designed protein nanoparticle vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; 183 :1367-1382.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). This RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, as well as an RSV vaccine using the I53-50 nanoparticle platform, is in clinical development ( https://www.icosavax.com/ ), illustrating the feasibility of large-scale good manufacturing practices (GMP) production. Here, we show that I53-50NPs presenting 20 copies of prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein induce robust NAb responses in mice, rabbits, and cynomolgus macaques. Vaccination of the latter prevented lymphopenia, reduced lung damage, and significantly reduced viral loads and replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs could reduce the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2-associated pathology in vaccinated humans and control viral shedding and transmission.
Evidence is mounting that NAb titers are the immunological correlate of protection for SARS-CoV-2 ( Addetia et al., 2020 1. Addetia, A. ∙ Crawford, K.H.D. ∙ Dingens, A. ... Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate J. Clin.

DNA vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :806-811 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it is increasingly accepted that a successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will need to induce potent NAb responses. We observed notable differences in NAb titers by our vaccine and previously described candidates, although comparisons may be biased by differences in vaccination schedules, assay variability, and inconsistencies in data presentation. Here, SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP-vaccinated macaques neutralized authentic virus with a median ID 50 of ∼4,000 after the final immunization, while NAb titers induced by adenovirus vector vaccines, including ChAdOx1 ( van Doremalen et al., 2020 64. van Doremalen, N. ∙ Lambe, T. ∙ Spencer, A. ... ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine prevents SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques Nature. 2020; 586 :578-582 Crossref Scopus (640) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Janssen ( Mercado et al., 2020 44.

DNA vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques Science. 2020; 369 :806-811 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Inovio ( Patel et al., 2020 49. Patel, A. ∙ Walters, J. ∙ Reuschel, E.L. ... Intradermal-delivered DNA vaccine provides anamnestic protection in a rhesus macaque SARS-CoV-2 challenge model bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and the inactivated vaccines Sinopharm ( Wang et al., 2020 69. Wang, H. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Huang, B. ...

Gao, Q. ∙ Bao, L. ∙ Mao, H. ... Development of an inactivated vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :77-81 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ), were at least 10-fold lower. However, NAb titers induced by SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs were similar to the Moderna mRNA vaccine ( Corbett et al., 2020 12. Corbett, K.S. ∙ Flynn, B. ∙ Foulds, K.E. ... Evaluation of the mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman primates N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :1544-1555 Crossref Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ) and lower than the Novavax and Clover Biopharmaceuticals protein vaccines ( Guebre-Xabier et al., 2020 22. Guebre-Xabier, M. ∙ Patel, N. ∙ Tian, J.-H. ... NVX-CoV2373 vaccine protects cynomolgus macaque upper and lower airways against SARS-CoV-2 challenge Vaccine. 2020; 38 :7892-7896 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liang et al., 2020 38. Liang, J.G. ∙ Su, D. ∙ Song, T.Z. ... S-Trimer, a COVID-19 subunit vaccine candidate, induces protective immunity in nonhuman primates bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Besides protecting an individual from COVID-19, a key component of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will be its ability to prevent viral transmission. Hence, sgRNA levels in the upper and lower airways are valuable endpoints in the evaluation of vaccine candidates. Similar to the Janssen and Novavax vaccines, vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs decreased median sgRNA to undetectable levels in the upper airways of all vaccinated animals within 5 dpe, while several other vaccines were unsuccessful in achieving such an effect ( van Doremalen et al., 2020 64. van Doremalen, N. ∙ Lambe, T. ∙ Spencer, A. ... ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine prevents SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques Nature. 2020; 586 :578-582 Crossref Scopus (640) PubMed Google Scholar ; Patel et al., 2020 49.

One should consider that the Janssen and Novavax studies used 10- to 100-fold lower challenge doses than used here. On the other hand, our regimen consisted of three immunizations, a number that may not be practical in the context of large-scale vaccination campaigns. However, even though three immunizations were used, the high NAb titers at week 6 indicate that two immunizations may be sufficient to confer protection. As in the Novavax study, the animals here were challenged 2 weeks after the final immunization (i.e., at peak NAb titer). It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions on the durability of the protection, but we note that SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells are expected to remain stable over a long period of time ( Gaebler et al., 2021 18. Gaebler, C. ∙ Wang, Z. ∙ Lorenzi, J.C.C. ... Evolution of antibody immunity to SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2021; Crossref Scopus (1073) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, the rapid decrease in sgRNA levels, the low level of viral mutations in the S protein, and the absence of an anamnestic response after challenge emphasize SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP vaccination’s profound ability to control infection and replication.
We propose two factors that may have been responsible for the potent humoral responses and protective efficacy by SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs. First, the high density of antigen on the I53-50NPs may have facilitated efficient activation of relevant NAb B cell lineages, which is in line with previous studies ( Antanasijevic et al., 2020 4. Antanasijevic, A. ∙ Ueda, G. ∙ Brouwer, P.J.M. ... Structural and functional evaluation of de novo-designed, two-component nanoparticle carriers for HIV Env trimer immunogens PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16 :e1008665 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Brouwer et al., 2019 8. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Antanasijevic, A. ∙ Berndsen, Z. ... Enhancing and shaping the immunogenicity of native-like HIV-1 envelope trimers with a two-component protein nanoparticle Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4272 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) and supported by B cell activation experiments described here. Second, by using an S protein that has been stabilized in the prefusion state, we have likely improved the conformation of key NAb epitopes (such as the RBD) and decreased the exposure of non-NAb epitopes. Indeed, it has recently been shown that introduction of the two appropriately positioned prolines and removal of the polybasic-cleavage site significantly improved the protective ability of an S protein vaccine ( Amanat et al., 2020 3. Amanat, F. ∙ Strohmeier, S. ∙ Rathnasinghe, R. ... Introduction of two prolines and removal of the polybasic cleavage site leads to optimal efficacy of a recombinant spike based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the mouse model bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, these mutations alone might not be sufficient to generate stable trimeric S proteins, and introducing additional stabilizing mutations, such as the previously described HexaPro mutations ( Hsieh et al., 2020 26. Hsieh, C.-L. ∙ Goldsmith, J.A. ∙ Schaub, J.M. ... Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes Science. 2020; 369 :1501-1505 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ; Juraszek et al., 2021 27. Juraszek, J. ∙ Rutten, L. ∙ Blokland, S. ... Stabilizing the closed SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ), may further improve the SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP-induced humoral responses. Recently, nasal immunization has been shown to dramatically improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy over intramuscular dosing ( Hassan et al., 2020 23. Hassan, A.O. ∙ Kafai, N.M. ∙ Dmitriev, I.P. ... A single-dose intranasal ChAd vaccine protects upper and lower respiratory tracts against SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2020; 183 :169-184.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using this alternative administration route may allow SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs to elicit protective NAb titers in the mucosa and could advance its protective efficacy toward fully sterilizing immunity.
The data presented here show that three immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs can induce protective immunity to a high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge. There are some limitations in our study that we should note. First, we challenged the macaques 2 weeks after the final immunization, generally corresponding to the peak of NAb titers. We therefore cannot ascertain that our vaccine would be as efficacious in the context of a delayed SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Second, our regimen included three immunizations (i.e., one more than vaccines currently in use or under consideration). Although we observed potent NAb responses after two immunizations, we cannot draw firm conclusions on the protective efficacy after two immunizations. Finally, recent months have seen the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 strains that may have the potential to evade NAb responses. Whether our vaccine is able to protect against these mutants warrants further investigation.

Female cynomolgus macaques ( Macaca fascicularis ), aged 56-66 months and originating from Mauritian AAALAC certified breeding centers were used in this study. All animals were housed in IDMIT infrastructure facilities (CEA, Fontenay-aux-roses), under BSL-2 and BSL-3 containment when necessary (Animal facility authorization #D92-032-02, Préfecture des Hauts de Seine, France) and in compliance with European Directive 2010/63/EU, the French regulations and the Standards for Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, of the Office for Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW, assurance number #A5826-01, US). The protocols were approved by the institutional ethical committee “Comité d’Ethique en Expérimentation Animale du Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives” (CEtEA #44) under statement number A20-011. The study was authorized by the “Research, Innovation and Education Ministry” under registration number APAFIS#24434-2020030216532863v1.
Female New Zealand White rabbits of 2.5-3 kg from multiple litters were used. Animals were sourced and housed at Covance Research Products, Inc. (Denver, PA, USA) and immunizations were performed under permits with approval number C0084-20. Immunization procedures complied with all relevant ethical regulations and protocols of the Covance Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Female BALB/cAnNCrl mice, aged 8 weeks, were ordered from Charles River Laboratories and housed at the Animal Research Institute Amsterdam under BSL-2 conditions. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Dutch Experiment on Animals Act and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Amsterdam UMC (Permit number 17-4045).
Sera were collected from male and female patients aged between 18 and 75 years through the COVID-19 Specific Antibodies (COSCA) study, which was performed at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, location AMC, the Netherlands under approval of the local ethical committee of the AMC (NL 73281.018.20) ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To create the SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 construct, the previously described pPPI4 plasmid encoding the prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ) was digested with PstI and BamHI and ligated in a PstI-BamHI-digested pPPI4 plasmid encoding a modified I53-50A.1NT1 sequence. The original I53-50A.1NT1 plasmid was described previously ( Brouwer et al., 2019 8. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Antanasijevic, A. ∙ Berndsen, Z. ... Enhancing and shaping the immunogenicity of native-like HIV-1 envelope trimers with a two-component protein nanoparticle Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4272 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Modifications constitute the introduction of GSLEHHHHHH after the final residue to introduce a C-terminal histidine-tag. To generate S proteins for FACS analyses, the prefusion S protein sequence was cloned into a pPPI4 backbone encoding a I53-50A.1NT1 sequence that had an Avi- and histidine-tag after the final residue. The RBD probe was generated by digesting this plasmid with PstI-BamHI and introducing, by Gibson assembly, a gene encoding the RBD (residues 319-541) directly downstream of a TPA leader sequence. For ELISAs, Luminex assays, and ELISpots, histidine-tagged versions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD were produced by cloning the aforementioned sequences into a pPPI4 plasmid containing a hexahistidine tag using PstI and BamHI digestion and ligation.
All constructs were expressed by transient transfection of HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) maintained in Freestyle medium (Life Technologies) at a density of 0.8-1.2 million cells/mL. On the day of transfection, a mix of PEImax (1 μg/μL) with expression plasmids (312.5 μg/L) in a 3:1 ratio in OptiMEM (GIBCO) were added to the cells. Six days post transfection, supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm, filtered using 0.22 μm Steritop filters (Merck Millipore), and subjected to affinity purification using Ni-NTA agarose beads. Protein eluates were then concentrated and buffer exchanged to PBS using Vivaspin filters with the appropriate molecular weight cutoff (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined by the Nanodrop method using the proteins peptidic molecular weight and extinction coefficient as determined by the online ExPASy software (ProtParam).
Lemo21 (DE3) (NEB) cells expressing I53-50B.4PT1 were grown in a 10L BioFlo 320 Fermenter (Eppendorf) or a 2L shake flask. Cells were grown in LB (10 g Tryptone, 5 g Yeast Extract, 10 g NaCl) at 37°C to an OD600 of 0.8. After the cells were induced with 1 mM of IPTG, temperature was reduced to 18°C and cells were grown for 16h. The cells were then lysed in 50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 0.75% CHAPS using a Microfluidics M110P at 18,000 psi. Lysate was centrifuged at 24,000 g for 30 minutes. Clarified lysate was next applied to a Ni Sepharose 6 FF column (Cytiva) linked to an AKTA Avant150 FPLC system (Cytiva) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography. I53-50B.4PT1 was eluted using a 30 mM to 500mM imidazole linear gradient in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 500 mM NaCl and 0.75% CHAPS. Fractions containing I53-50B.4PT1 were pooled, concentrated using centrifugal filters with a 10,000 kDa cutoff (Millipore), sterilized and applied to a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 (Cytvia) for further purification. Batches were tested for endotoxin levels before use.
Ni-NTA eluates of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 (expressed as described above) were buffer exchanged to Tris-buffer-saline (TBS), sterile filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to a Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL column (GE healthcare) linked to a NGC chromatography system (Bio-Rad) in TBS supplemented with 5% glycerol. Size exclusion fractions between 12-14 mL were pooled and an equimolar amount of I53-50B.4PT1 was added. After an overnight incubation at 4°C, the assembly mix was applied to a Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL column in TBS+5% glycerol to remove unassembled components. Fractions corresponding to assembled SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs (8.5-9.5 mL) were collected and concentrated using Vivaspin columns with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 kDa (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined by the Nanodrop method using the proteins peptidic molecular weight and extinction coefficient as determined by the online ExPASy software (ProtParam).
BN-PAGE was performed as described previously ( de Taeye et al., 2015 14. de Taeye, S.W. ∙ Ozorowski, G. ∙ Torrents de la Peña, A. ... Immunogenicity of stabilized HIV-1 envelope trimers with reduced exposure of non-neutralizing epitopes Cell. 2015; 163 :1702-1715 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (265) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 2.5 μg of S protein was mixed with loading dye and run on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen).
SARS-CoV-2 S-153-50NPs were added to carbon-covered 400 mesh copper grids and stained with 2% uranyl formate. Micrographs were imaged on a Tecnai F12 Spirit microscope with a 4k FEI Eagle CCD. Leginon ( Potter et al., 1999 50. Potter, C.S. ∙ Chu, H. ∙ Frey, B. ... Leginon: a system for fully automated acquisition of 1000 electron micrographs a day Ultramicroscopy. 1999; 77 :153-161 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Appion ( Lander et al., 2009 35. Lander, G.C. ∙ Stagg, S.M. ∙ Voss, N.R. ... Appion: an integrated, database-driven pipeline to facilitate EM image processing J. Struct. Biol. 2009; 166 :95-102 Crossref Scopus (622) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to collect and process micrographs.
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 and SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP were diluted to 100 nM and 5nM, respectively, in BLI running buffer (PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.02% Tween20) and antibody binding was assessed using a ForteBio Octet K2. The binding assays were performed at 30°C and with agitation set at 1000 rpm. Antibody was loaded on protein A sensors (ForteBio) at 10 μg/mL in running buffer until a binding threshold of 1 nm was reached. Association and dissociation were measured for 300 s.
Gycopeptide analysis was essentially performed as described previously ( Watanabe et al., 2020 70. Watanabe, Y. ∙ Allen, J.D. ∙ Wrapp, D. ... Site-specific glycan analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike Science. 2020; 369 :330-333 Crossref Scopus (1020) PubMed Google Scholar ). A 30 μg aliquot of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 was denatured, alkylated, reduced and cleaved by the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin and alpha-lytic protease. Clean-up of the resulting peptide/glycopeptides was performed using C18 Zip-tips and the sample was analyzed by nanoLC-ESI MS with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system coupled to a Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Peptides were separated using an EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 μm × 75 cm). Glycopeptide fragmentation data were extracted from the raw file using Byonic™ (Version 3.5) and Byologic™ software (Version 3.5; Protein Metrics Inc.).
The B cell specific expression plasmid was constructed by exchanging the gl2-1261 gene of the pRRL EuB29 gl2-1261 IgGTM.BCR.GFP.WPRE plasmid ( McGuire et al., 2014 43. McGuire, A.T. ∙ Dreyer, A.M. ∙ Carbonetti, S. ... HIV antibodies. Antigen modification regulates competition of broad and narrow neutralizing HIV antibodies Science. 2014; 346 :1380-1383 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) with heavy and light chain genes of either COVA1-18 and COVA2-15 using Gibson assembly (Integrated DNA Technologies). The production of lentivirus in HEK293T and the subsequent transduction was conducted as described elsewhere ( ter Brake et al., 2006 60. ter Brake, O. ∙ Konstantinova, P. ∙ Ceylan, M. ... Silencing of HIV-1 with RNA interference: a multiple shRNA approach Mol. Ther. 2006; 14 :883-892 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting the expression plasmid with pMDL, pVSV-g and pRSV-Rev into HEK293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post transfection, IgM-negative Ramos B cells cultured in RPMI (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) (RPMI++) were transduced with filtered (0.45 μm) and concentrated (100 kDa molecular weight cutoff, GE Healthcare) HEK293T supernatant. Seven days post transduction, BCR-expressing B cells were FACS sorted on IgG and GFP double-positivity using a FACS Aria-II SORP (BD biosciences). B cells were then expanded and cultured indefinitely.
B cell activation experiments of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific Ramos B cells were performed as previously described ( Brouwer et al., 2019 8. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Antanasijevic, A. ∙ Berndsen, Z. ... Enhancing and shaping the immunogenicity of native-like HIV-1 envelope trimers with a two-component protein nanoparticle Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4272 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sliepen et al., 2019 58. Sliepen, K. ∙ Han, B.W. ∙ Bontjer, I. ... Structure and immunogenicity of a stabilized HIV-1 envelope trimer based on a group-M consensus sequence Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2355 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, 4 million cells/mL in RPMI++ were loaded with 1.5 μM of the calcium indicator Indo-1 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C, washed with Hank’s Balance Salt Solution supplemented with 2 mM CaCl 2 , followed by another incubation of 30 min at 37°C. Antigen-induced Ca 2+ influx of COVID-specific B cells were monitored on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) by measuring the 379/450 nm emission ratio of Indo-1 fluorescence upon UV excitation. Following 30 s of baseline measurement, aliquots of 1 million cells/mL were then stimulated for 100 s at RT with either 5 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 200 ng/mL or 40 ng/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 or the equimolar amount presented on I53-50NPs. Ionomycin (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL to determine the maximum Indo-1-fluorescence. Kinetics analyses were performed using FlowJo v10.7.
Cynomolgus macaques were randomly assigned in two experimental groups. The vaccinated group (n = 6) received 50 ug of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP adjuvanted with 500 μg of MPLA liposomes (Polymun Scientific, Klosterneuburg, Austria) diluted in PBS at weeks 0, 4 and 10, while control animals (n = 4) received no vaccination. Vaccinated animals were sampled in blood, nasal swabs and saliva at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. At week 12, all animals were exposed to a total dose of 10 6 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/France/ lDF0372/2020 strain; GISAID EpiCoV platform under accession number EPI_ISL_406596) via the combination of intranasal and intra-tracheal routes (0,25 mL in each nostril and 4,5 mL in the trachea, i.e., a total of 5 mL; day 0), using atropine (0.04 mg/kg) for pre-medication and ketamine (5 mg/kg) with medetomidine (0.042 mg/kg) for anesthesia. Saliva, as well as nasopharyngeal, tracheal and rectal swabs, were collected at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14 and 21 days past exposure (dpe) while blood was taken at days 2, 4, 6, 10, 14 and 21 dpe. Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were performed using 50 mL sterile saline on 3 dpe. A single BAL was performed at 3 dpe in order to be close to the peak of viral replication and to be able to observe a difference between the vaccinated and control groups. In our earlier study ( Maisonnasse et al., 2020 41. Maisonnasse, P. ∙ Guedj, J. ∙ Contreras, V. ... Hydroxychloroquine use against SARS-CoV-2 infection in non-human primates Nature. 2020; 585 :584-587 Crossref Scopus (246) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that at later time-points, viral loads in the BAL were very low or negative. Chest CT was performed at baseline and on 3, 7 and 14 dpe in anesthetized animals using tiletamine (4 mg/kg) and zolazepam (4 mg/kg). Blood cell counts, haemoglobin and hematocrit were determined from EDTA blood using a HMX A/L analyzer (Beckman Coulter).
Female New Zealand White rabbits were given two intramuscular immunizations, one in each quadricep, at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The immunization mixture involved 39 μg of SARS-CoV-2-S-I53-50NPs (equal to 30 μg of SARS-CoV-2-S) formulated 1:1 in Squalene Emulsion adjuvant (Polymun, Klosterneuburg, Austria). The rabbits were bled on the day of immunization and then at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 14.
Female Balb/cAnNCrl mice received subcutaneous immunizations into the neck skin-fold at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The immunization mixture contained 13 μg of SARS-CoV-2-S-I53-50NPs (equal to 10 μg of SARS-CoV-2-S) adjuvanted with 50 μg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly-IC; Invivogen). Blood was collected at weeks −1, 2, 6 and 14. Two out of eight mice were sacrificed at week 6 to allow interim analysis of the induced humoral response.
Patients with at least one nasopharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 as determined by qRT-PCR (Roche LightCycler480, targeting the Envelope-gene 113bp) were included. Patients using immunosuppressive mediation (equivalent of > 7.5 mg prednisolone) were excluded from the study. Included patients signed written informed consent forms. A venipuncture was performed to obtain blood in Acid Citrate Dextrose tubes for serum collection approximately four weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms ( Brouwer et al., 2020 9. Brouwer, P.J.M. ∙ Caniels, T.G. ∙ van der Straten, K. ... Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability Science. 2020; 369 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (771) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Ni-NTA plates (QIAGEN) were loaded with 2 μg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in TBS for 2 h at RT. Next, washed plates were blocked for 1 h with TBS/2% skimmed milk. Four-fold serial dilutions of inactivated sera, starting from a 1:200 dilution for mice and rabbit sera, and 1:100 dilution for macaque sera, were added in TBS/2% skimmed milk/20% sheep serum and incubated for 2 h at RT. Following plate washing, a 1:3000 dilution of secondary antibody in TBS/2% skimmed milk was added for 1 h at RT. For mice, rabbit and macaque sera horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mice IgG, HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used, respectively. Finally, after washing plates with TBS/0.05% Tween-20, developing solution (1% 3,3′,5,5′-tetranethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% H 2 O 2 , 100 mM sodium acetate and 100 mM citric acid) was added to each well and a colorimetric endpoint was obtained by adding 0.8 M H 2 SO 4 after 1.5 min. Binding endpoint titers were determined using a cutoff of 5x background.
As affinity differences between species-specific secondary Abs may bias comparisons between endpoint titers of macaque and convalescent human sera, we used a different ELISA setup to compare S protein and RBD binding responses. Specifically, ELISA binding responses are compared to a standard curve of species-specific polyclonal IgG so that a semiquantitative measure of specific IgG concentrations can be obtained. High-binding plates were direct-coated overnight at 4°C with 2 μg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S or 0.4 μg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in PBS. For capture of the standard curve (i.e., macaque and human polyclonal IgG), plates were coated with 1:2000 (for capture of polyclonal macaque IgG) or 1:1000 (for capture of polyclonal human IgG) of goat anti-Human IgG λ and κ (Southern Biotech). The next day, plates were washed with TBS than contained 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and blocked for 1 h with Casein buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10,000 dilution of macaque or human serum in Casein buffer were then added to the wells containing S protein or RBD. Five-fold serial dilutions of polyclonal macaque (Molecular Innovations) or human IgG, starting at a concentration of 1 μg/mL, were added to wells containing the coated goat anti-Human IgG λ and κ. Standards and samples were applied in duplicate. Following a 1 h incubation at RT, the plates were washed with TBST and secondary antibody diluted in Casein buffer was added for 1 h. For the plates containing human sera and standard, a 1:3000 dilution of HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used. For plates containing macaque sera and standard, a 1:50,000 dilution of biotinylated mouse anti-monkey IgG was used (Southern Biotech), followed by a 1 h incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of HRP-labeled streptavidin (Biolegend) in Casein. Finally, after washing plates with TBST, developing solution (1% 3,3′,5,5′-tetranethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% H 2 O 2 , 100 mM sodium acetate and 100 mM citric acid) was added to each well and a colorimetric endpoint was obtained by adding 0.8 M H 2 SO 4 after 5 min. OD 450 -values that fell within the linear range of the standard curve were fitted and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD-specific IgG was determined.
To generate SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were transfected with a pHIV-1 NL43 ΔENV-NanoLuc reporter virus plasmid and a SARS-CoV-2-S Δ19 plasmid ( Schmidt et al., 2020 54. Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Muecksch, F. ... Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric viruses J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20201181 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell supernatant containing the pseudoviruses was harvested 48 h post transfection, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g and sterile filtered through a 0.22 μm pore size PVDF syringe filter. For neutralization assays HEK293T expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (HEK293T/ACE2) were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL).To determine the neutralization activity in serum, saliva or nasopharyngeal samples, HEK293T/ACE2 cells were first seeded in 96-well plates coated with 50 μg/mL poly-l-lysine at a density of 2x10 4 /well in the culture medium described above but with GlutaMax (GIBCO) added. The next day, duplicate serial dilutions of heat inactivated samples were prepared in the same medium as used for seeding of cells and mixed 1:1 with pseudovirus. This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 h before adding it to the HEK293T/ACE2 cells in a 1:1 ratio with the cell culture medium. After 48 h, the cells were lysed and lysate was transferred into half area 96-well white microplates (Greiner bio-one). Luciferase activity was measured in the lysates using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with a Glomax system (Turner BioSystems). Relative luminescence units (RLU) were normalized to those from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in the absence of sera/saliva/swabs. Neutralization titers (ID 50 -values) were determined as the serum dilution at which infectivity was inhibited by 50%.
Serum samples were tested for their neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 (German isolate; GISAID ID EPI_ISL 406862; European Virus Archive Global #026V-03883) as described previously ( Okba et al., 2020 46. Okba, N.M.A. ∙ Müller, M.A. ∙ Li, W. ... Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific antibody responses in coronavirus disease patients Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2020; 26 :1478-1488 Crossref Scopus (1092) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, serum samples were serially diluted in 50 μL Opti-MEM I (GIBCO), supplemented with GlutaMAX (GIBCO) and penicillin (100 U/mL). Serum dilutions were mixed with 400 plaque-forming units of virus to a total of 100 μL. This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation, the mixtures were put on Vero-E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and incubated for 1 h. Cells were then washed, Opti-MEM I supplemented with GlutaMAX (GIBCO) was added, and incubated for 8 h. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV Ab (Sino Biological) and secondary Alexa488 conjugated goat-anti-rabbit Ab (Invitrogen). Plates were scanned on the Amersham Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (channel Cy2; resolution 10 μm; GE Healthcare). Data was analyzed using ImageQuant TL 8.2 image analysis software (GE Healthcare).
Proteins were covalently coupled to Magplex beads (Luminex Corporation) using a two-step carbodiimide reaction and a ratio of 75 μg protein SARS-CoV-2 S protein to 12,5 million beads. Magplex beads (Luminex Corporation) were washed with 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate pH 6.2, activated for 30 min on a rotor at RT by addition of Sulfo-N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The activated beads were washed three times with 50 mM MES pH 5.0 and added to SARS-CoV-2 S protein which was diluted in 50 mM MES pH 5.0. The beads and protein were incubated for 3 h on a rotator at RT. Afterward, the beads were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20 and 0.05% Sodium Azide at pH 7.0 for 30 min on a rotator at RT. Finally, the beads were washed and stored in PBS containing 0.05% Sodium Azide at 4°C and used within 3 months.
50 μL of a working bead mixture containing 20 beads per μL was incubated overnight at 4°C with 50 μL of diluted serum, saliva or nasopharyngeal swab. Pilot experiments determined the optimal dilution for detection of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies in serum to be 1:50,000, for the detection of antibody binding to FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa and C1q in serum at 1:500 and for detection of S protein-specific IgG and IgA in saliva and nose fluid at 1:20. Plates were sealed and incubated on a plate shaker overnight at 4°C. The next day, plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) using a hand-held magnetic separator. Beads were resuspended in 50 μL of Goat-anti-human IgG-PE, Goat-anti human IgA-PE or Mouse-anti human IgM-PE (Southern Biotech) and incubated on a plate shaker at RT for 2 h. For C1q binding, beads were resuspended in 50 μL purified human C1q (Complement Technology, Inc.), which was biotinylated and conjugated to Streptavidin-PE. For the detection of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa binding, beads were resuspended in 50 μL biotinylated human FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa ectodomain dimers (courtesy of Bruce Wines and Mark Hogarth) for 2 h incubation, after which the beads were washed with TBST and then incubated with 50 μL Streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen) on a plate shaker for 1 h. Afterward, the beads were washed with TBST and resuspended in 110 μL Bioplex sheath fluid (Bio-Rad). The beads were agitated for a few minutes on a plate shaker at RT and then readout was performed on the Bioplex 200 (Bio-Rad). Resulting mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were corrected by subtraction of MFI values from buffer and beads only wells. Relative MFI values were obtained by dividing the MFI by the background MFI at week 0. Reproducibility of the results was confirmed by performing replicate runs.
Cryopreserved macaque PBMCs from 2 weeks after final immunization (week 12) were thawed and counted. 1x10 6 cells per condition were plated in 96 U-shape well plates (CELLSTAR, Kremsmünster) and rested for 2-3 h in RPMI (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% FBS, 1mM HEPES (GIBCO), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). Subsequently, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL anti-CD40 (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min at 37°C, to prevent downregulation of CD40 ligand (CD40L) by blocking CD40-CD40L interaction. PBMCs were stimulated for 18 h at 37°C with 5 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S protein. As a negative control no stimulants were added, and as a positive control 1 mg/mL Staphylococcal enterotoxin B was used. Thereafter, PBMCs were washed using FACS buffer (PBS, supplemented with 1% FBS). PBMCs were then incubated with the cTfh-specific chemokine receptor antibody CXCR5 PE-Cy7 (clone MU5UBEE; eBioscience) for 10 min at 37°C. Next, the following antibodies and viability dye were incubated with PBMCs at RT for 20 min: anti-CD3 BUV395 (clone SP34-2; BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 BUV495 (clone SK3; BD Biosciences), anti-CD154 BV421 (clone TRAP1; BD Biosciences), anti-CD69 BV785 (clone FN50; BD Biosciences), anti-4-1BB APC (clone 4B4-1; Biolegend) and LiveDead-eF780 (eBioscience). Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer before acquisition on the BD LSR II Fortessa 5 lasers flow cytometer (BD biosciences). Analysis was performed on FlowJo v.10.7.1.
Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD were conjugated to streptavidin-bound fluorophores. Briefly, the biotinylated proteins were incubated for a minimum of 1 h at 4°C with the streptavidin-conjugates AF647 (Biolegend), BV421 (Biolegend) and BB515 (BD Biosciences) at a 1:2 protein to fluorochrome ratio. The fluorescent probes were incubated for at least 10 min with 10mM biotin (GeneCopoeia) to saturate the unconjugated streptavidin-fluorochrome complexes. Cryopreserved macaque PBMCs from 2 weeks after final immunization (week 12) were thawed and counted. 5x10 6 cells were stained for 30 min at 4°C with the fluorescent probes, a viability marker (LiveDead-eF780, eBiosciences) and the following B cell-specific antibodies: anti-CD20-PE-CF594 (clone 2H7; BD Biosciences), anti-IgG-PE-Cy7 (clone G18-145;BD Biosciences), anti-CD27-PE (clone M-T271; BD Biosciences), and anti-IgM-BV605 (clone MHM-88; Biolegend). Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and acquired on the FACS-ARIA-SORP 4 laser (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed on FlowJo v.10.7.1.
For the cynomolgus macaque challenge study, SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/France/ lDF0372/2020 strain; GISAID EpiCoV platform under accession number EPI_ISL_406596) was isolated by the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) ( Lescure et al., 2020 36. Lescure, F.-X. ∙ Bouadma, L. ∙ Nguyen, D. ... Clinical and virological data of the first cases of COVID-19 in Europe: a case series Lancet Infect. Dis. 2020; 20 :697-706 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (802) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM + 5% FBS. PCR-positive sample from patient 0371 was diluted 1:2 with DMEM with antibiotics but without FBS and supplemented with 1ug/ml trypsin-TPCK (Sigma-Aldrich), added to the cells and incubated one hour at 37°C. The inoculum was then replaced with DMEM medium containing antibiotics and 1μg/ml trypsin-TPCK at 37°C. Three days later, clear cytopathogenic effects were observed and RT-qPCR was performed to detect presence of virus. Culture supernatant was harvested, aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
Before the challenge experiment, virus stocks were first subjected to an additional passage on Vero E6 cells in DMEM (GIBCO) without FBS, supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and 1 μg/mL TPCK-trypsin at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Virus was then titrated on Vero E6 cells by plaque reduction assay.
Upper respiratory (nasopharyngeal and tracheal) and rectal specimens were collected with swabs (Viral Transport Medium, CDC, DSR-052-01). Tracheal swabs were performed by insertion of the swab above the tip of the epiglottis into the upper trachea at approximately 1.5 cm of the epiglottis. All specimens were stored between 2°C and 8°C until analysis by RT-qPCR with a plasmid standard concentration range containing an RdRp gene fragment including the RdRp-IP4 RT-PCR target sequence. SARS-CoV-2 E gene subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) levels were assessed by RT-qPCR using primers and probes previously described ( Corman et al., 2020 13. Corman, V.M. ∙ Landt, O. ∙ Kaiser, M. ...

The protocol describing the procedure for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is available on the WHO website ( https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/real-time-rt-pcr-assays-for-the-detection-of-sars-cov-2-institut-pasteur-paris.pdf?sfvrsn=3662fcb6_2 ).
Acquisition was done using a computed tomography (CT) system (Vereos-Ingenuity, Philips). Animals were anesthetized and put in a supine position. Body temperature, oxygen saturation and heart rate were monitored. The collimation of the CT detector was 64 × 0.6 mm, with a 120 kV tube voltage and around 120 mA intensity. The intensity was regulated by dose optimization tools (Dose Right, Z-DOM, 3D-DOM; Philips Healthcare). The reconstructed CT images had a slice thickness of 1.25 mm, with an interval of 0.25 mm. Lesions were defined, by internationally standard nomenclature, as ground glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation or pleural thickening ( Pan et al., 2020 48. Pan, F. ∙ Ye, T. ∙ Sun, P. ... Time course of lung changes at chest CT during recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Radiology. 2020; 295 :715-721 Crossref Scopus (1889) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2020 56. Shi, H. ∙ Han, X. ∙ Jiang, N. ... Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study Lancet Infect. Dis. 2020; 20 :425-434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2591) PubMed Google Scholar ) (none, 0; GGO, 1; pleural thickening, 1; crazy-paving pattern, 3; consolidation, 3). Lesions and scoring were assessed in each lung lobe blindly and independently by two persons and final results were made by consensus. Overall CT scores include the lesion type, scored from 0 to 3 (None, 0; Slight, 1; Mild, 2; Severe, 3) and lesion volume, scored from 0 to 4 (None, 0; < 25% of the lobe, 1; 25 < x < 50% of the lobe, 2; 50 < x < 75% of the lobe, 3; 75 < x < 100% of the lobe; 4) and summed for each lobe.
IFNγ ELISpot assay of PBMCs was performed using the Monkey IFNγ ELISpot PRO kit (Mabtech Monkey IFNγ ELISPOT pro, #3421M-2APT) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were plated at a concentration of 200,000 cells per well and were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 S protein at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Plates were incubated for 42 h at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 , then washed 5 times with PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with a biotinylated anti-IFNγ antibody. After 5 washes, spots were developed by adding 0.45 μm-filtered ready-to-use BCIP/NBT-plus substrate solution and counted with an automated ELISpot reader ELRIFL04 (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). Spot forming units (SFU) per 1.0x10 6 PBMCs are means of duplicates for each animal.
30 RNA samples from nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage at day 3 and 5 were selected for sequencing. cDNA and multiplex PCR reactions were prepared following the ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocol v2 ( Tyson et al., 2020 63. Tyson, J.R. ∙ James, P. ∙ Stoddart, D. ... Improvements to the ARTIC multiplex PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing using nanopore bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The inoculum was also sequenced. V3 primer scheme ( https://github.com/artic-network/primer-schemes/tree/master/nCoV-2019/V3 ) was used to perform the multiplex PCR for SARS-CoV-2. All samples were run for 35 cycles in the two multiplex PCRs. Pooled and cleaned PCR reactions were quantified using QubitTM fluorometer (Invitrogen). The Ligation Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used to prepare the library following the manufacturer’s protocol (“PCR tiling of COVID-19 virus,” release F; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 24 samples were multiplexed using Native Barcoding Expansion 1-12 and Native Barcoding Expansion 13-24 kits (EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Two libraries of 24 samples were prepared independently and quantified by QubitTM fluorometer (Invitrogen). Quality control of two R9.4 flowcells (FLO-MIN106; Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was performed to assess pores viability. Next, 45 and 32 ng of library were respectively loaded as recommended by the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing was performed on a GridION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) for 72 h with high-accuracy Guppy basecalling (v3.2.10). After sequencing, demultiplexing was performed using Guppy v4.0.14 with the option–require_barcodes_both_ends to ensure high quality demultiplexing. Reads were then filtered by Nanoplot v1.28.1 based on length and quality to select high quality reads. Then, reads were aligned on the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome NC_045512.2 using minimap2 v2.17. Primary alignments were filtered based on reads length alignment and reads identity. Finally, variant calling was performed with Longshot v0.4.1. Identified variants were then analyzed using in-house scripts. Variants absent from the inoculum but present in one or more samples were selected for further analysis.
Details on the statistical analysis for the experiments can be found in the accompanying figure legends. Statistical significance between groups is indicated in the figures by stars: ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ , p < 0.0001. In addition, statistical significance between viral loads in the control and vaccinated groups are also indicated in the Results section by p values. Medians are plotted for all experiments and comparisons between two groups were made using a Mann-Whitney U test (Excel 2016, GraphPad Prism 8.0/7.0). For mouse experiments 8 animals were used up to week 6, when 2 animals were euthanized for preliminary assessment of (N)Ab titers. Due to low sample volumes the eight mouse samples at week −1 were randomly paired and pooled into 4 samples. The rabbit experiments were performed using 5 animals. In the macaque experiments, 6 animals were used in the vaccinated group and 4 animals were used in the control group.
