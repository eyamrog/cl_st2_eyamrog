Title: Budding epithelial morphogenesis driven by cell-matrix versus cell-cell adhesion


Abstract: Summary

Many embryonic organs undergo epithelial morphogenesis to form tree-like hierarchical structures. However, it remains unclear what drives the budding and branching of stratified epithelia, such as in the embryonic salivary gland and pancreas. Here, we performed live-organ imaging of mouse embryonic salivary glands at single-cell resolution to reveal that budding morphogenesis is driven by expansion and folding of a distinct epithelial surface cell sheet characterized by strong cell-matrix adhesions and weak cell-cell adhesions. Profiling of single-cell transcriptomes of this epithelium revealed spatial patterns of transcription underlying these cell adhesion differences. We then synthetically reconstituted budding morphogenesis by experimentally suppressing E-cadherin expression and inducing basement membrane formation in 3D spheroid cultures of engineered cells, which required β1-integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion for successful budding. Thus, stratified epithelial budding, the key first step of branching morphogenesis, is driven by an overall combination of strong cell-matrix adhesion and weak cell-cell adhesion by peripheral epithelial cells.

Section: Introduction

Branching morphogenesis is widely used by epithelial organs to maximize their functional surface area ( Wang et al., 2017 58. Wang, S. ∙ Sekiguchi, R. ∙ Daley, W.P. ... Patterned cell and matrix dynamics in branching morphogenesis J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216 :559-570 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). All branching organs have a core epithelium encased by a layer of basement membrane (BM) surrounded by mesenchymal cells. The mesenchyme secretes growth factors critical for epithelial growth and morphogenesis ( Affolter et al., 2009 1. Affolter, M. ∙ Zeller, R. ∙ Caussinus, E.

However, when suitable growth factors and extracellular matrix are provided, the epithelium of many organs can branch without the mesenchyme ( Ewald et al., 2008 9.

Branching epithelia can be single layered with a lumen or stratified without a lumen. Branching of a single-layered epithelium involves buckling of the epithelial sheet ( Nelson, 2016 29. Nelson, C.M. On buckling morphogenesis J. Biomech. Eng. 2016; 138 :021005 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). The buckling of single-layered lung epithelium can be guided by external sculpting forces from airway smooth muscle cells ( Goodwin et al., 2019 12. Goodwin, K. ∙ Mao, S. ∙ Guyomar, T. ... Smooth muscle differentiation shapes domain branches during mouse lung development Development. 2019; 146 :1-13 Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2015 20. Kim, H.Y. ∙ Pang, M.-F. ∙ Varner, V.D. ... Localized smooth muscle differentiation is essential for epithelial bifurcation during branching morphogenesis of the mammalian lung Dev. Cell. 2015; 34 :719-726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ), among other cell types ( Young et al., 2020 61. Young, R.E. ∙ Jones, M.K. ∙ Hines, E.A. ...

Cell. 2020; 53 :73-85.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). In stratified epithelia, however, the concept of buckling cannot be easily applied due to the apparent lack of a sheet-like structure.
Embryonic salivary gland and pancreas are classical examples of stratified epithelia that undergo branching morphogenesis involving budding and ductal morphogenesis ( Shih et al., 2013 46. Shih, H.P. ∙ Wang, A. ∙ Sander, M. Pancreas organogenesis: from lineage determination to morphogenesis Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2013; 29 :81-105 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steinberg et al., 2005 49. Steinberg, Z. ∙ Myers, C. ∙ Heim, V.M. ...

Wang, S. ∙ Sekiguchi, R. ∙ Daley, W.P. ... Patterned cell and matrix dynamics in branching morphogenesis J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216 :559-570 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). In budding morphogenesis, numerous epithelial buds arise by repeated clefting of a single initial epithelial bud, and ductal morphogenesis generates tubular structures connecting terminal end buds together. Budding morphogenesis is characterized by extensive dynamics of epithelial cells and the BM matrix ( Harunaga et al., 2014 16. Harunaga, J.S. ∙ Doyle, A.D. ∙ Yamada, K.M.

ECM signaling regulates collective cellular dynamics to control pancreas branching morphogenesis Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :169-179 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it remains unclear how buds arise.
Here, we use volumetric live-organ imaging to follow individual cells within virtually the entire mouse embryonic salivary gland during branching morphogenesis. We find that surface-localized epithelial cells form an integral layer with the BM, which together expands and folds inward to drive budding morphogenesis. We use mathematical modeling and experimental perturbations to corroborate a model that a combination of weak cell-cell adhesion and strong cell-matrix adhesion of peripheral epithelial cells drives the expansion and folding of the surface epithelial sheet. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization reveal distinct transcriptional features of these surface epithelial bud cells. Importantly, we demonstrate successful reconstitution of budding morphogenesis by experimentally reducing E-cadherin expression and inducing BM formation in 3D spheroid cultures of engineered epithelial cells that normally do not form buds. Our results reveal a fundamental self-organizing mechanism based on preferential cell-matrix adhesion versus cell-cell adhesion that can explain how stratified epithelia undergo budding morphogenesis.

Section: Results

To visualize cellular mechanisms of stratified epithelial branching, we developed live-organ imaging strategies using two-photon microscopy to image nearly the entire 3D volume of transgenic mouse embryonic salivary glands at high spatiotemporal resolution ( Figures S1 A–S1C; Video S1 ). 3D cell tracking revealed extensive cell motility throughout the developing gland, with cell migration rates increasing near the periphery of the branching epithelial buds as previously described ( Hsu et al., 2013 17.

Volumetric time-lapse video of a branching embryonic salivary gland, related to Figure 1 Salivary gland from a 13-day transgenic mouse embryo expressing membrane-tdTomato and histone-EGFP. Time-lapse volumetric two-photon microscopy images were acquired at 2-μm z steps over a 100 μm z range at 5-minute intervals for 20 hours. The first half of the video shows different views of the imaging volume at the first time point. The second half of the video shows time-lapse sequences of the middle x-y plane (left) or 3D rendering of the middle 40 μm-thick volume of a branching epithelial bud (right).
Next, we evaluated whether cells exchange freely between the outer epithelial layer and gland interior during morphogenesis or whether branching salivary glands are composed of distinct interior and surface cell populations. We photoconverted patches of cells near the epithelial surface in transgenic salivary glands expressing KikGR, a photoconvertible fluorescent protein emitting green or red fluorescence before or after conversion ( Hsu et al., 2013 17. Hsu, J.C. ∙ Koo, H. ∙ Harunaga, J.S. ... Region-specific epithelial cell dynamics during branching morphogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2013; 242 :1066-1077 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tsutsui et al., 2005 55. Tsutsui, H. ∙ Karasawa, S. ∙ Shimizu, H. ... Semi-rational engineering of a coral fluorescent protein into an efficient highlighter EMBO Rep. 2005; 6 :233-238 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most photoconverted peripheral epithelial cells moved rapidly along the tissue surface while maintaining intimate contact with the BM ( Figure 1 A; Video S2 ), suggesting tight adherence of these cells to the BM. We then used an epithelial RFP reporter (Krt14p::RFP) with elevated expression in peripheral versus interior epithelial cells ( Figure S1 C) to enable automated rendering of the epithelial surface ( Figures 1 B and 1C). We analyzed cell movements at the epithelial surface (located within 15 μm of the surface at any point within the tracked time window) to reveal that most cell movements remain confined to the surface ( Figures 1 D and 1E; Video S3 ). During new bud formation by clefting, the peripherally enriched Krt14p::RFP reporter clearly delineated a distinct surface cell sheet, whose expansion and folding seemed to underlie clefting ( Video S4 ).

Different views of a branching epithelial bud from a developing salivary gland, related to Figures 1 and 2 Salivary gland from a 13-day transgenic mouse embryo expressing histone-EGFP and a heterozygous epithelial RFP reporter driven by the Krt14 promoter (Krt14p::RFP). Note that the surface-layer epithelial cells expressing high RFP comprise a cell sheet that folds inward during clefting.
We next determined whether new surface cells are added uniformly around the epithelial surface or locally at the cleft to distinguish between clefting as a systemic or local process. We traced nuclear histone-EGFP intensities of peripheral epithelial cells over time and computed local peripheral curvature to track surface deformation ( Figures 1 F–1J and S1 F). Local expansion to form a cleft would predict an abrupt change in slope angles of temporal nuclear traces at cleft sites ( Figure S1 G). Instead, the observed changes of slope angles were gradual, and surface expansion rates near clefts were indistinguishable from other locations, suggesting that clefting is a systemic activity ( Figures 1 I, 1J, and S1 J–S1L). Moreover, increasing peripheral nuclear counts over time closely matched expansion of the bud perimeter, indicating constant peripheral cell density ( Figures 1 H, S1 H, S1I, and S1M).
Taken together, we conclude that clefting in salivary glands is caused by uniform expansion and inward folding of the surface epithelial cell sheet.
We next determined the origin of new epithelial surface cells. The distinct boundary of Krt14p::RFP expression levels between peripheral and interior epithelial cells hinted that new surface cells arise primarily from proliferation of preexisting surface cells ( Figure S1 C; Video S4 ). However, no surface cells divided locally to directly produce two daughter cells remaining in the surface layer (n = 289 surface-derived cell divisions; Figure 2 A). Instead, 92.4% of division-ready surface cells moved to a subsurface level to divide into two daughter cells in the gland interior (type I; Figures 2 A and S2 A), and the remaining 7.6% divided into one surface daughter cell and one interior daughter cell (type II; Figures 2 A and S2 B). Importantly, all surface-derived interior daughter cells eventually returned to the surface by reinserting between surface cells for delayed surface expansion ( Figures 2 B, S2 C, and S2D; Video S5 ). Most cells returned within 4 h, but a few took a little over 12 h ( Figure 2 B). Rapid-returning cells generally moved in proximity to the surface, while slow-returning cells stochastically wandered deep into the bud interior and were delayed or temporarily trapped before returning ( Figure S2 E). Cell reinsertion sites were uniformly distributed around the surface (red dots in Figure S2 D), revealing the cellular basis of uniform surface expansion.

The second part shows tracking of 16 pairs of daughter cells in the “tracked cell centered” style. Tracked cell is marked by a white dot. Distance indicated is from the coverslip. Time indicates minutes from the onset of anaphase (0 min).
What drives the robust surface return of surface-derived cells? Based on the lower E-cadherin expression level of peripheral epithelial cells compared to interior epithelial cells ( Walker et al., 2008 56. Walker, J.L. ∙ Menko, A.S. ∙ Khalil, S. ... Diverse roles of E-cadherin in the morphogenesis of the submandibular gland: insights into the formation of acinar and ductal structures Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237 :3128-3141 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 C and 2D), we hypothesized that differential cell-cell adhesion directed sorting out of low-E-cadherin surface-derived cells from high-E-cadherin interior cells ( Steinberg, 1963 48. Steinberg, M.S. Reconstruction of tissues by dissociated cells. Some morphogenetic tissue movements and the sorting out of embryonic cells may have a common explanation Science. 1963; 141 :401-408 Crossref Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine whether surface-derived cells maintained low E-cadherin expression when temporarily interior located after cell division, we fixed transgenic glands immediately after live imaging and immunostained for E-cadherin ( Figure 2 E) to identify surface-originating interior-located cells by cell tracking to compare their E-cadherin expression with surface cells. There was a clear negative correlation between E-cadherin intensity at cell-cell junctions and the average Krt14p::RFP intensity of the two adjacent cells ( Figure 2 F). We then identified interior-located daughter cells after surface cell division by cell tracking and quantified E-cadherin intensities at cell-cell junctions between these cells and their neighbors. Importantly, E-cadherin intensity at these junctions were indistinguishable from randomly sampled junctions between high-RFP cells (mostly at the surface) and their neighbors ( Figure 2 G). We conclude that surface-derived cells maintain low E-cadherin expression after moving into the gland interior, which probably underlies their robust return to the surface ( Figure 2 B).
Live imaging and the E-cadherin expression pattern led us to propose a model of salivary gland clefting based on the interplay between the BM matrix and two cell types with distinct cell adhesion properties ( Figure 2 H). In this testable model, provisional surface cells are first generated by proliferation of surface cells and temporarily stored in the interior domain to build up “branching potential” (i.e., the relative abundance of interior-located low E-cadherin cells). These cells then return to the subsurface layer by cell sorting driven by differential cell-cell adhesion, reinsert between surface cells adhering weakly to each other, and use strong cell-matrix adhesions to remain adherent to the BM. The expanded extra surface then folds to cause clefting and new bud formation ( Figure 2 H).
This model has an interesting prediction: if the number of stored interior low-E-cadherin cells could be increased, then it might be possible to accumulate branching potential separate from actual branching. We tested this by treating salivary glands with collagenase to disrupt the major BM component collagen IV. High-concentration collagenase treatment caused existing epithelial buds to fuse together to revert branching ( Figure 3 A; Grobstein and Cohen, 1965 13. Grobstein, C. ∙ Cohen, J. Collagenase: effect on the morphogenesis of embryonic salivary epithelium in vitro Science. 1965; 150 :626-628 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rebustini et al., 2007 40. Rebustini, I.T. ∙ Patel, V.N. ∙ Stewart, J.S. ... Laminin α5 is necessary for submandibular gland epithelial morphogenesis and influences FGFR expression through β1 integrin signaling Dev. Biol. 2007; 308 :15-29 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we discovered greatly accelerated catch-up branching after collagenase washout ( Figures 3 A and 3B), likely resulting from attaching of accumulated surface-originated low-E-cadherin cells to the restored BM. The accumulation of surface-originated cells in the bud interior can be directly visualized by Krt14p::RFP after 24-h collagenase treatment ( Figure 3 C), when both collagen IV and laminin were greatly reduced at the BM ( Figure 3 D). We conclude that BM disruption can uncouple surface expansion from the buildup of an interior pool of low-E-cadherin cells. BM restoration enables rapid surface expansion and branching due to BM anchorage of these interior low-E-cadherin cells.
We next asked how BM disruption affects surface-originating cell divisions and cell dynamics. Interestingly, we observed a small proportion of in-plane divisions (type III, 3.9%) and two new types of cell divisions where one or two daughter cells were temporarily extruded outward from the surface layer ( Figure 3 E), indicating BM normally serves as a mechanical barrier to bias the extrusion toward the interior. Surface-derived daughter cells took much longer to initially return to the surface ( Figure 3 F, left) and importantly failed to remain on the surface ( Figure 3 F, right), suggesting adhesion to the BM normally keeps surface cells in place. In contrast, collagenase treatment only slightly affected mesenchymal cell shape and motility without changing cell proliferation rates in either the mesenchyme or epithelium ( Figures 3 G–3K), suggesting the effect of collagenase treatment was mainly due to BM disruption.
We derived a mathematical model of budding morphogenesis (see STAR Methods ) incorporating the characteristic cell divisions ( Figure 2 A), robust return of surface-originating cells ( Figure 2 B), high affinity between surface cells and BM ( Figures 1 D, 1E, and 3 F), and mainly constant cell division rates over time ( Figure S2 F). The initial state is a two-compartment sphere with a surface layer enveloping an interior core, where some division-ready cells in the surface layer are about to enter the subsurface to divide and with twice as many returning cells in the subsurface layer ( Figure S2 G). A key parameter dictating the occupancy ratio of low-E-cadherin cells in surface versus subsurface layers is the free energy difference ( ΔE ) of a unit event when a subsurface low-E-cadherin cell inserts into the surface layer ( Figures S2 H–S2J). From experimentally measurable values including division-ready cell abundance (ω) and the geometric ratio (β), we estimated the interior-to-surface expansion ratio (α) ( Figure S2 K). We found all data mapped to the parameter space permissive for surface folding ( Figure S3 L), supporting our model.
The model predicts that increasing ΔE (i.e., making surface insertion harder) will inhibit budding ( Figure S2 J). We tested this by weakening cell-matrix binding with integrin blocking antibodies or increasing BM thickness using inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which all inhibited budding as predicted ( Figures S3 A–S3C). We then evaluated the effects of low-concentration collagenase treatment to presumably soften the BM and observed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on both budding and collagen IV abundance in the BM ( Figures S3 D and S3E). BM softening would simultaneously ease its stretching and weaken cell-matrix binding ( Discher et al., 2005 8. Discher, D.E. ∙ Janmey, P. ∙ Wang, Y.-L. Tissue cells feel and respond to the stiffness of their substrate Science. 2005; 310 :1139-1143 Crossref Scopus (5164) PubMed Google Scholar ), which would have opposite effects on budding ( Figures S2 I and S2J). Our results identify reduction of cell-matrix binding strength as the dominant factor ( Figure S3 D).
To explore regulatory mechanisms underlying differential cell adhesion properties among epithelial cells, we profiled single-cell transcriptomes of the E13 salivary gland epithelium by scRNA-seq. The 6,943 single-cell transcriptomes formed seven main clusters with distinct marker genes ( Figures 4 A–4C). The cluster identities were assigned based on expression profiles of known marker genes, including the bud marker Sox10, duct marker Sox2, basal epithelial (outer bud and duct) marker Krt14, and the luminal (or inner) duct marker Krt19 ( Lombaert and Hoffman, 2010 26.

We validated the bud enrichment of Sox10 expression and the duct enrichment of Sox2 expression by single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) ( Figures S4 A and S4B; Raj et al., 2008 39.

We also identified Cldn10 as a marker with strong inner bud enrichment and found that claudin 10 protein was indeed highly expressed in the inner bud ( Figures 4 B, 4C, and S4 C). Although perhaps counterintuitive, calculations based on gland dimensions confirmed that there should be significantly more outer bud cells than inner bud cells ( Figure S4 D).
To evaluate the dynamics of single-cell transcriptomes, we calculated RNA velocity ( Bergen et al., 2020 4. Bergen, V. ∙ Lange, M. ∙ Peidli, S. ... Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1408-1414 Crossref Scopus (1083) PubMed Google Scholar ; La Manno et al., 2018 22. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1950) PubMed Google Scholar ), which predicts the future state of individual cells based on their unspliced and spliced mRNAs ( Figure 4 D). This analysis revealed two prominent patterns, a cycling vector field covering all four outer bud clusters and a directional flow from the bud-to-duct clusters. The cycling vector field across outer bud clusters suggested outer bud cells were cell-cycling progenitors ( Bergen et al., 2020 4. Bergen, V. ∙ Lange, M. ∙ Peidli, S. ... Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :1408-1414 Crossref Scopus (1083) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was confirmed by the cell-cycle phases of these cells ( Figure 4 E). In fact, many marker genes of outer bud clusters were related to cell division or cell-cycle regulation ( Figure 4 B). On the other hand, the directional bud-to-duct flow suggested some bud cells would differentiate into duct cells ( Figure 4 D).
We next compared expression patterns of major cell adhesion genes. For cell-matrix adhesion, all prominently expressed integrin genes (Itgb1, Itga6, and Itga9) had either comparable or slightly lower mRNA expression levels in the inner bud compared to outer bud cells ( Figures 4 F and S4 E). However, both ITGB1 and ITGA9 proteins had notable peripheral enrichment ( Figures S4 F–S4J), which might enhance cell sorting by differential cell-cell adhesion. For cell-cell adhesion, the E-cadherin gene Cdh1 showed clear enrichment in the inner bud compared to outer bud cells ( Figures 4 F and S4 E), consistent with E-cadherin protein expression ( Figures 2 C–2E). We confirmed this pattern of Cdh1 mRNA expression by smFISH ( Figures 4 G and 4H). This pattern was specific, since expression of the P-cadherin gene Cdh3 is similar between inner and outer bud cells ( Figures 4 F and S4 E). Among transcription factors involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( Stemmler et al., 2019 50. Stemmler, M.P. ∙ Eccles, R.L. ∙ Brabletz, S. ... Non-redundant functions of EMT-TFs Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :102-112 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ), only Snai2 was prominently expressed, and its pattern was negatively correlated to Cdh1 and positively correlated to Krt14 ( Figures 4 C and 4I), suggesting a regulatory role for Snai2 in shaping the expression pattern of Cdh1, consistent with prior in vitro findings ( Bolós et al., 2003 5. Bolós, V. ∙ Peinado, H. ∙ Pérez-Moreno, M.A. ... The transcription factor Slug represses E-cadherin expression and induces epithelial to mesenchymal transitions: a comparison with Snail and E47 repressors J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 :499-511 Crossref Scopus (973) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next evaluated whether stratified epithelial branching could be reconstituted using primary salivary gland epithelial cells. Our lab had previously demonstrated self-assembly of dissociated salivary gland epithelial cells and partial primitive branching of self-assembled epithelial aggregates after embedding dissociated cells in solidified high-concentration Matrigel (basement membrane matrix extract) ( Kleinman et al., 1986 21. Kleinman, H.K. ∙ McGarvey, M.L. ∙ Hassell, J.R. ... Basement membrane complexes with biological activity Biochemistry. 1986; 25 :312-318 Crossref Scopus (1284) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cultured on a polycarbonate filter ( Wei et al., 2007 59. Wei, C. ∙ Larsen, M. ∙ Hoffman, M.P. ... Self-organization and branching morphogenesis of primary salivary epithelial cells Tissue Eng. 2007; 13 :721-735 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ). The results might have been limited by epithelial cell attachment to the filter. We optimized culture conditions to recapitulate prominent branching morphogenesis of either isolated single epithelial buds or completely dissociated single epithelial cells with rates comparable to intact salivary gland culture ( Figures 5 A–5G). Reconstituted branching from single buds or dissociated cells formed both end bud and duct structures ( Figure 5 H), and live imaging confirmed that peripheral cells in both cultures undergo out-of-layer divisions characteristic of intact glands ( Figures 5 I and 5J). Thus, we conclude that key aspects of stratified epithelial branching morphogenesis can be reconstituted from primary epithelial cells without the mesenchyme. Consequently, partial reconstitution of budding or branching morphogenesis might be possible using non-embryonic engineered cells.
Our model suggests that the key initial process of stratified epithelial budding is driven by cells with weak cell-cell adhesions plus strong cell-matrix adhesions. Reducing cell-cell adhesion can enhance branching morphogenesis in mammary gland and embryonic pancreas ( Nguyen-Ngoc et al., 2012 31. Nguyen-Ngoc, K.V. ∙ Cheung, K.J. ∙ Brenot, A. ... ECM microenvironment regulates collective migration and local dissemination in normal and malignant mammary epithelium Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :E2595-E2604 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shih et al., 2016 47. Shih, H.P. ∙ Panlasigui, D. ∙ Cirulli, V. ... ECM signaling regulates collective cellular dynamics to control pancreas branching morphogenesis Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :169-179 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), but whether it alone is sufficient to drive branching remained unknown. We thus attempted to reconstitute epithelial branching by engineering cell adhesion. We chose the human adult colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 as a starting point, because DLD-1 expresses abundant E-cadherin and forms near-spherical spheroids in 3D cultures ( Riedl et al., 2017 41. Riedl, A. ∙ Schlederer, M. ∙ Pudelko, K. ... Comparison of cancer cells in 2D vs 3D culture reveals differences in AKT-mTOR-S6K signaling and drug responses J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :203-218 Crossref Scopus (341) PubMed Google Scholar ). To modulate cell adhesion molecules, we established a clonal DLD-1 cell line with transgenes enabling CRISPR/dCas9-based inducible transcriptional repression and activation ( Gao et al., 2016 10. Gao, Y. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Wong, S. ... Complex transcriptional modulation with orthogonal and inducible dCas9 regulators Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :1043-1049 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S5 A and S5B). To stably express single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and monitor their expression, we constructed lentiviral vectors co-expressing sgRNAs with bright nuclear fluorescent reporters ( Figure S5 C).
To reduce cell-cell adhesion strength, we identified two Cdh1 sgRNAs that efficiently reduced E-cadherin expression after cells were treated with abscisic acid (ABA), a dimerizer used to recruit the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) transcriptional repression domain ( Figures 6 A and S5 D–S5F). Without ABA, sg1-Cdh1 had minimal effects, whereas sg2-Cdh1 reduced E-cadherin to ∼20% of controls ( Figures S5 D–S5F), likely due to direct transcriptional blockade ( Qi et al., 2013 38. Qi, L.S. ∙ Larson, M.H. ∙ Gilbert, L.A. ... Repurposing CRISPR as an RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific control of gene expression Cell. 2013; 152 :1173-1183 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3625) PubMed Google Scholar ). The reduction of E-cadherin could be titrated by ABA concentrations, approaching maximum reduction at 3 days for sg1-Cdh1 and 2 days for sg2-Cdh1 ( Figures S5 G and S5H). Inhibiting E-cadherin in DLD-1 resulted in only a moderate reduction of total β-catenin ( Figure S5 I) and did not reduce cell proliferation or survival, as reported for breast cancer cells ( Padmanaban et al., 2019 35. Padmanaban, V. ∙ Krol, I. ∙ Suhail, Y. ... E-cadherin is required for metastasis in multiple models of breast cancer Nature. 2019; 573 :439-444 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, β-catenin in the cytoplasm and nucleus remain unchanged despite a severe loss from cell junctions upon E-cadherin downregulation ( Figure S5 J). Importantly, we observed sorting out of low-E-cadherin cells in spheroid cultures of mixed sg-Control and sg-Cdh1 cells, suggesting E-cadherin reduction successfully lowered cell-cell adhesion strength ( Figure S6 A).
DLD-1 spheroids failed to spontaneously form a BM, a structure critical for salivary gland branching ( Figure 3 ). To induce BM formation, we supplemented culture media with a non-solidified, low-concentration suspension of the BM extract Matrigel. Strikingly, this led to robust budding morphogenesis in spheroids containing sg1-Cdh1 or sg2-Cdh1 cells after ABA-induced E-cadherin reduction ( Figures 6 B–6F and S6 B–S6F; Video S6 ). Importantly, a condensed layer of BM formed around the spheroids with high levels of the BM components laminin and collagen IV ( Figures 6 G and 6H). In spheroids with both sg-Cdh1 and sg-Control cells, cells contacting the BM were primarily sg-Cdh1 cells lacking E-cadherin expression ( Figures 6 H and S6 G). Furthermore, live-spheroid imaging revealed preferential outward expansion of contact surfaces between sg-Cdh1 cells (magenta) and the BM (yellow), whereas contact surfaces between sg-Control cells (green) and the BM were mainly found at the cleft bottom ( Figures 6 H and 6I; Video S7 ). Bud formation could also occur in spheroids containing only low-E-cadherin cells, but these spheroids were often flatter, and their buds were less striking ( Figures S6 H and S6I), suggesting high-E-cadherin cells may play a structural role by forming a more robust spheroid core. To summarize the process of reconstituted budding morphogenesis, cells with experimentally reduced E-cadherin expression sorted out to the surface by differential cell-cell adhesion and then interacted with the BM to promote budding as strong cell-matrix adhesions replaced weak cell-cell adhesions ( Figure S6 J).

Our model predicts that strong cell-matrix interactions are required for reconstituted budding morphogenesis. Inhibiting cell-matrix interactions by a function-blocking β1-integrin antibody inhibited bud formation ( Figures S7 A and S7B). In addition, enzymatic disruption of the BM reverted budding, which recovered upon BM reformation ( Figures S7 C and S7D). We then identified an Itgb1 sgRNA to reduce β1-integrin expression in subsets of cells ( Figures S7 E–S7G). Bud formation was completely blocked when β1-integrin was reduced in low-E-cadherin cells or in all cells, but not when only in high-E-cadherin cells ( Figures 7 A–7D and S7 H), demonstrating that β1-integrin-dependent cell-matrix interactions were specifically required in low-E-cadherin cells for budding. Importantly, reducing E-cadherin or β1-integrin expression selectively inhibited cell attachment to E-cadherin extracellular domain or Matrigel-coated surfaces, respectively ( Figures S7 I–S7L).
We next tested whether enhancing cell-matrix adhesion strength could enhance budding. We capitalized on the low-level bud formation observed in mixed sg-Control/sg2-Cdh1 spheroid cultures without ABA, providing a sensitized assay ( Figures S6 C–S6F). Using MnCl 2 to enhance integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion strength ( Bazzoni et al., 1995 3. Bazzoni, G. ∙ Shih, D.T. ∙ Buck, C.A. ... Monoclonal antibody 9EG7 defines a novel β 1 integrin epitope induced by soluble ligand and manganese, but inhibited by calcium J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 :25570-25577 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (258) PubMed Google Scholar ) produced a modest but definitive increase in bud formation ( Figures 7 E–7G). Thus, enhancing cell-matrix adhesion strength could enhance budding.
Finally, we tested whether changing the matrix composition or thickness of BM would affect the extent of budding. Matrigel contains ∼60% laminin and ∼30% collagen IV ( Kleinman et al., 1986 21. Kleinman, H.K. ∙ McGarvey, M.L. ∙ Hassell, J.R. ... Basement membrane complexes with biological activity Biochemistry. 1986; 25 :312-318 Crossref Scopus (1284) PubMed Google Scholar ). When mixing Matrigel with an increasing ratio of laminin, we observed reduced budding morphogenesis ( Figures 7 H–7J), indicating the importance of optimal matrix composition. Budding was also inhibited when MMPs were inhibited ( Figures 7 K–7M), which significantly increased BM thickness ( Figure S7 M). Spheroids with a BM were clearly stiffer than spheroids without matrix supplement, as measured by the apparent Young’s modulus using atomic force microscopy ( Figures 7 N and S7 N), supporting a putative mechanical role of the BM for the expanding surface cell layer. Interestingly, increasing BM thickness by MMP inhibition or changing its composition by laminin supplementation did not seem to alter the intrinsic stiffness of BM ( Figure 7 N). The inhibitory effects on budding were probably due to reduced cell-matrix binding strength with altered composition and increased energy cost to stretch a thicker BM after MMP inhibition.

Section: Discussion

Our work reveals the critical role of a specific combination of strong cell-matrix adhesions and weak cell-cell adhesions for driving budding morphogenesis of stratified epithelia, the key first step of branching morphogenesis. We discovered that budding morphogenesis of stratified salivary gland epithelium is driven by the comparatively faster expansion and inward folding of a cryptic surface epithelial sheet, which we could visualize by single-cell tracking. Mechanistically, the expansion of this epithelial sheet is driven by the subsurface cell division and back-insertion of surface-derived daughter cells that retain weak cell-cell adhesions and re-establish strong cell-matrix adhesions to the BM. Importantly, these two parameters were sufficient to successfully reconstitute budding morphogenesis of a stratified epithelium by experimentally reducing E-cadherin expression and inducing BM formation to provide cell-matrix adhesion.
Cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesions play important roles in epithelial morphogenesis, including cell sorting by differential cell-cell adhesion ( Steinberg, 1963 48. Steinberg, M.S. Reconstruction of tissues by dissociated cells. Some morphogenetic tissue movements and the sorting out of embryonic cells may have a common explanation Science. 1963; 141 :401-408 Crossref Scopus (794) PubMed Google Scholar ) or alternative self-organization strategies ( Cerchiari et al., 2015 6. Cerchiari, A.E. ∙ Garbe, J.C. ∙ Jee, N.Y. ... A strategy for tissue self-organization that is robust to cellular heterogeneity and plasticity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :2287-2292 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). In general, tissues minimize systemic interfacial energy by maximizing interfaces with stronger interactions. Following this principle, we find that strong cell-matrix adhesions combined with weak cell-cell adhesions are sufficient to drive clefting and bud formation of a stratified epithelium.
Weak cell-cell adhesions of peripheral epithelial cells (and their progeny) likely play two important roles in promoting expansion of the surface epithelial sheet. First, surface-derived epithelial cells that temporarily localize to the bud interior for cell division presumably rely on their inherited weak cell-cell adhesion to sort back out to the surface. Second, weak cell-cell adhesions between surface cells will allow returning cells to intercalate between them to engage with the BM.
Conversely, the strong cell-matrix adhesions of peripheral epithelial cells to the BM would both promote expansion of the surface epithelial sheet and maintain its integrity. When integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion is inhibited in salivary glands, surface cells frequently detach from the BM and migrate into the bud interior, which inhibits branching ( Hsu et al., 2013 17. Hsu, J.C. ∙ Koo, H. ∙ Harunaga, J.S. ... Region-specific epithelial cell dynamics during branching morphogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2013; 242 :1066-1077 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 A). After enzymatic BM disruption in branched salivary glands, preexisting epithelial buds fuse ( Grobstein and Cohen, 1965 13. Grobstein, C. ∙ Cohen, J. Collagenase: effect on the morphogenesis of embryonic salivary epithelium in vitro Science. 1965; 150 :626-628 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). In both normal branching and accelerated branching upon BM recovery, the surface cell sheet expands, because cells with low E-cadherin prefer to engage with the BM rather than with other low E-cadherin cells ( Figure S2 H). By increasing interfaces with stronger interactions, the epithelial cells and the BM comprise a system proceeding toward a state of lower overall interfacial energy—a prescribed end state.
Surface epithelial cells in the salivary gland epithelium mainly divide in the subsurface layer after delaminating from the surface ( Figure 2 A). Similar out-of-layer cell divisions occur in the stratified embryonic pancreatic epithelium ( Shih et al., 2016 47. Shih, H.P. ∙ Panlasigui, D. ∙ Cirulli, V. ... ECM signaling regulates collective cellular dynamics to control pancreas branching morphogenesis Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :169-179 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ) and single-layered embryonic lung and kidney epithelia ( Packard et al., 2013 34. Packard, A. ∙ Georgas, K. ∙ Michos, O. ... Luminal mitosis drives epithelial cell dispersal within the branching ureteric bud Dev. Cell. 2013; 27 :319-330 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schnatwinkel and Niswander, 2013 43. Schnatwinkel, C. ∙ Niswander, L. Multiparametric image analysis of lung-branching morphogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2013; 242 :622-637 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We speculate division-ready cells delaminate due to mitotic cell rounding and cell crowding in the surface layer. Mitotic cells round up by outward osmotic pressure and inward contraction of the actomyosin cortex ( Stewart et al., 2011 51. Stewart, M.P. ∙ Helenius, J. ∙ Toyoda, Y. ... Hydrostatic pressure and the actomyosin cortex drive mitotic cell rounding Nature. 2011; 469 :226-230 Crossref Scopus (497) PubMed Google Scholar ) while losing adhesion to the matrix ( Li and Burridge, 2019 25. Li, Y. ∙ Burridge, K. Cell-Cycle-Dependent Regulation of Cell Adhesions: Adhering to the Schedule: Three papers reveal unexpected properties of adhesion structures as cells progress through the cell cycle BioEssays. 2019; 41 :e1800165 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in extrusion. Because BM is stiffer than cells, cell extrusion is biased toward the interior mass of cells. In fact, we observed outward cell extrusion upon BM disruption ( Figure 3 E).
A major advantage of out-of-layer divisions may be to facilitate redistribution of rapidly dividing surface cells. If several adjacent surface cells were to divide locally to generate new surface daughter cells, they could build up considerable stress by over-stretching the associated BM. Instead, the out-of-layer division strategy is self-adjusting, because extruded and dividing cells can insert between jostling soft cells compared to the stiff BM, and they can subsequently reinsert back into the surface layer at sites of easiest entry (lowest ΔE ).
With the insight that stratified epithelial budding can be conceptualized as folding of an expanding surface cell sheet, our findings reveal hidden similarities between the seemingly discrepant branching mechanisms used by single-layered and stratified epithelia. Both can now be seen as buckling of an epithelial sheet ( Nelson, 2016 29. Nelson, C.M. On buckling morphogenesis J. Biomech. Eng. 2016; 138 :021005 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ), except that the surface cell sheet in a stratified epithelium is more cryptic until visualized by cell tracking.
Buckling of the two types of epithelial sheets is shaped by differing constraints imposed by surrounding tissues. Outside the BM of both is a mesenchyme consisting of cells and extracellular matrix. However, the epithelial sheet in a stratified epithelium is directly attached to an inner cell core, while a single-layered epithelium encloses a fluid-filled lumen. As a result, buckling of a single-layered epithelium is primarily constrained by the surrounding mesenchyme, as in mouse embryonic lung and intestine ( Goodwin et al., 2019 12. Goodwin, K. ∙ Mao, S. ∙ Guyomar, T. ... Smooth muscle differentiation shapes domain branches during mouse lung development Development. 2019; 146 :1-13 Google Scholar ; Hughes et al., 2018 19. Hughes, A.J. ∙ Miyazaki, H. ∙ Coyle, M.C. ... Engineered Tissue Folding by Mechanical Compaction of the Mesenchyme Dev. Cell. 2018; 44 :165-178.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2015 20. Kim, H.Y. ∙ Pang, M.-F. ∙ Varner, V.D. ... Localized smooth muscle differentiation is essential for epithelial bifurcation during branching morphogenesis of the mammalian lung Dev. Cell. 2015; 34 :719-726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, buckling of the surface epithelial sheet in a stratified epithelium is constrained by both the surrounding mesenchyme and the interior epithelium. During branching of stratified terminal end buds of mammary gland epithelium, the bifurcation angle is constrained by localized matrix in the surrounding mesenchyme ( Nerger et al., 2021 30. Nerger, B.A. ∙ Jaslove, J.M. ∙ Elashal, H.E. ... Local accumulation of extracellular matrix regulates global morphogenetic patterning in the developing mammary gland Curr. Biol. 2021; 31 :1903-1917.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the stratified salivary gland epithelium, however, the role of the interior epithelium appears more dominant than that of the surrounding mesenchyme. In our mesenchyme-free cultures of primary salivary gland epithelial cells, budding morphologies closely resembled intact salivary gland cultures with mesenchyme ( Figure 5 H). In fact, as demonstrated by our model, preferential expansion of a surface layer attached to an inner cell core alone is sufficient to drive folding of the surface layer ( Figure S2 G).
In conclusion, our study establishes the concept of the critical role of a specific combination of strong cell-matrix adhesion and weak cell-cell adhesion of peripheral epithelial cells for the expansion and buckling of a cryptic surface epithelial sheet, which in turn drives budding morphogenesis of a stratified epithelium. We anticipate that this unifying view of branching morphogenesis as buckling of an epithelial sheet will facilitate development of unifying physical models of branching morphogenesis that encompass single-layered and stratified epithelia. Importantly, understanding branching morphogenesis will pave the road to engineer functional branched organs from stem cells.
Our mathematical model predicts the overall extent, but not patterns, of budding, which would require incorporating mechanical properties of cells and basement membrane. The proposed role of Snai2 in regulating Cdh1 expression is correlative and should be verified experimentally.

All mouse experiments were performed under animal study protocols 14-745, 17-845, and 20-1040 approved by the NIDCR Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC). Mouse housing, care and maintenance were provided by the NIDCR Veterinary Resources Core. All mouse embryos were used without sex identification (mixed sexes). All transgenic mice were in FVB/N background. The mT/mG;Histone-EGFP ( Hadjantonakis and Papaioannou, 2004 14. Hadjantonakis, A.K. ∙ Papaioannou, V.E.

Ewald (Johns Hopkins University). The Krt14p::RFP ( Zhang et al., 2011 62. Zhang, L. ∙ Stokes, N. ∙ Polak, L. ... Specific microRNAs are preferentially expressed by skin stem cells to balance self-renewal and early lineage commitment Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8 :294-308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ) mouse was a gift from M.P. Hoffman (NIDCR, NIH) and was originally from E. Fuchs (Rockefeller University). Krt14p::RFP mice were crossed with mT/mG;Histone-EGFP mice to generate Krt14p::RFP;Histone-EGFP mice. Our KikGR mouse was generated as described ( Hsu et al., 2013 17. Hsu, J.C. ∙ Koo, H. ∙ Harunaga, J.S. ... Region-specific epithelial cell dynamics during branching morphogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2013; 242 :1066-1077 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transgenic mice 8-16 weeks old were bred to obtain 12- or 13-day old embryos. For timing of embryonic stage, the day after a vaginal plug was found was considered to be embryonic day 1. For experiments using wild-type embryos, timed pregnant ICR (CD-1) outbred mice were obtained from Envigo.
The HEK293T cell line used for lentivirus packaging was obtained from Takara (632273). The DLD-1 cell line was obtained from ATCC (CCL-221). DLD-1 cells were co-transfected with a PiggyBac transposase vector (System Biosciences, PB210PA-1) and a PiggyBac-ABA-CRISPRi vector (pSLQ2818; Addgene, 84241) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L3000015), selected by 5 μg/mL puromycin (MilliporeSigma, P8833) and sorted for the presence of tagBFP to generate “Di” cells. Di cells were co-transfected with the above transposase vector, PiggyBac-ABA-CRISPRi vector and a modified PiggyBac-GA-CRISPRa vector (pW210, see Plasmids ) using Lipofectamine 3000, selected by 5 μg/mL puromycin and 250 μg/mL hygromycin (MilliporeSigma, H3274) and sorted for brighter tagBFP than Di cells to generate “Dia” cells. Single cell clones of Dia cells were isolated by limiting dilution, and selected clones were functionally validated. The clonal Dia-C6 cells were used for lenti-sgRNA transduction followed by 20 μg/mL blasticidin (InvivoGen, ant-bl-1) selection and fluorescence cell sorting for mNeonGreen or mScarlet (see Plasmids ) to obtain final DLD-1 derived cell lines used for spheroid culture experiments.
pSLQ2818 (PiggyBac-ABA-CRISPRi) was a gift from Stanley Qi (Addgene: 84241). pMD2.G and psPAX2 were gifts from Didier Trono (Addgene: 12259; Addgene: 12260). The modified PiggyBac-GA-CRISPRa vector (pW210) was generated by replacing the Zeocin resistance cassette of pSLQ2842 (Addgene, 84244) with a synthesized Hygromycin resistance cassette (IDT) by Gibson Assembly ( Gibson et al., 2009 11. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.-Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6582) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lentiviral vectors for co-expressing sgRNAs and fluorescent nuclear reporters (pLenti-spsg-mNG/pW211, pLenti-spsg-mSL/pW212) were made by replacing the Cas9 expression cassette of lentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene, 52961) with an NLS-mNeonGreen-P2A-BlastR or NLS-mScarlet-I-BlastR cassette using Gibson Assembly. For lenti-sgRNA cloning, a pair of complementary oligos containing the desired sgRNA sequence (see sgRNA design ) plus a 4-bp 5′-extension (“cacc” for the forward oligo and “aaac” for the reverse complementary oligo) was annealed to form an oligo duplex, which was ligated into Esp3I (NEB, R0734S) digested vectors by a 1:2 mixture of T4 ligase (NEB, M0202L) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, M0236L) in T4 ligase buffer. The ligation mix was transformed using NEB stable competent cells (NEB, C3040) for single colony isolation. The Miraprep ( Pronobis et al., 2016 37. Pronobis, M.I. ∙ Deuitch, N. ∙ Peifer, M. The Miraprep: A protocol that uses a Miniprep kit and provides Maxiprep yields PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0160509 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) protocol was used to increase the yield of miniprep DNA, which was directly used for lentivirus packaging. Correct insertion of sgRNA sequence was confirmed by Sanger sequencing using primer 5′-gagggcctatttcccatgat-3′. Sanger sequencing was mostly performed by the NIDCR Combined Technical Research Core and occasionally by a local company (ACGT Inc., Germantown, MD).
Mouse submandibular salivary glands were isolated at embryonic day 12 or 13 (E12 or E13) as previously described ( Sequeira et al., 2013 45. Sequeira, S.J. ∙ Gervais, E.M. ∙ Ray, S. ... Genetic modification and recombination of salivary gland organ cultures J. Vis. Exp. 2013; e50060 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a scalpel (Fine Science Tools, 10011-00 and 10003-12) was used to decapitate the mouse embryo. While the detached head was held on its side with one prong of forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11251-20) pierced through the top, a scalpel was used to slice across the mouth opening to isolate the mandible and tongue, between which the submandibular glands were sandwiched. Under a dissecting microscope, the detached mandible tissue was placed on a glass plate with the tongue facing down. A pair of forceps was used to slice through the midline of the mandible tissue to expose the tongue and the two submandibular glands attached to the base of the tongue. After surrounding tissues were removed, glands were detached using forceps and collected into a 35-mm dish with 3 mL DMEM/F-12 (Thermo Fisher, 11039047) medium until all embryos were dissected. Isolated salivary glands were cultured on 13 mm diameter 0.1 μm pore polycarbonate filters (MilliporeSigma, WHA110405) floating on 200 μL Organ Culture Medium in the glass bottom area of a 50 mm MatTek dish (MatTek, P50G-1.5-14-F) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Organ Culture Medium was DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 150 μg/mL vitamin C (MilliporeSigma, A7506), 50 μg/mL transferrin (MilliporeSigma, T8158) and 1 × PenStrep (100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin; Thermo Fisher, 15140163).
Paired salivary glands from the same embryo were separated into control and collagenase treatment groups. Purified collagenase (Elastin Products Company, CL103) was resuspended in water (Quality Biological, 351-029-131) for a 2 mg/mL stock (aliquoted and stored at −20°C). For collagenase washout, the polycarbonate filter with attached glands was transferred onto 2 mL fresh DMEM/F-12 in a 35 mm dish (Corning, 430165) and incubated for 15 min at 37°C for one wash. After 3 × 15-min washes, the filter with glands was transferred onto 200 μL fresh Organ Culture Medium in a new 50 mm MatTek dish (see Salivary gland isolation and culture ).
Up to 6 intact salivary glands (see Salivary gland isolation and culture ) were treated with 150 μL 2 units/mL dispase (Thermo Fisher, 17105041; diluted in DMEM/F-12) in a well of a Pyrex spot plate (Fisher Scientific 13-748B) for 15 min at 37°C. The glands were washed twice with 5% BSA (MilliporeSigma, A8577; diluted in DMEM/F-12) in the same well to quench the dispase activity. The mesenchyme of each gland was removed using a pair of forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11254-20) and a tungsten needle (Fine Science Tools, 10130-05 and 26016-12) under a dissecting microscope. The forceps were mostly used to hold the gland still, whereas the needle was gently inserted between the mesenchyme and epithelium to separate them. Isolated epithelial rudiments were transferred to a new well of the spot plate with 150 μL DMEM/F-12 medium using low-retention pipette tips (cut for larger opening; Rainin, 30389190). When needed, a pair of forceps was used to cut off single epithelial buds from the isolated epithelial rudiments.
Single-cell dissociation of the salivary gland epithelium was performed as previously described with modifications ( Sekiguchi and Hauser, 2019 44. Sekiguchi, R. ∙ Hauser, B. Preparation of Cells from Embryonic Organs for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2019; 83 :e86 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thank R. Sekiguchi for sharing tissue dissociation protocols before publication. Depending on experiments, 8-12 isolated epithelial rudiments from E13 submandibular salivary glands (see Isolation of salivary gland epithelial rudiments ) were rinsed in 1 mL HBSS (Thermo Fisher, 14170161) in a 2 mL protein LoBind tube (Eppendorf, 022431102). After the rudiments were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 × g for 30 s, liquid was removed as much as possible using a 1 mL pipette followed by a 200 μL pipette under a dissecting microscope to avoid accidentally discarding the samples. 100 μL Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, AT104) was added to the tube, which was immediately incubated for 2 minutes in a 37°C water bath to disrupt cell-cell adhesion. While being monitored under a dissecting microscope, the epithelial rudiments were triturated using a 200 μL pipettor set at 50 μL using a low-retention tip (Rainin, 30389187) for 2 min, when most cells were clearly dissociated. 900 μL 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GE Healthcare/Cytiva, SH30070.03) diluted in PBS was added to quench the Accutase. The 1 mL cell suspension was passed through a 40 μm Flowmi (VWR, H13680-0040) cell strainer into a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 15 mL tube (Corning, 430053). It is critical to use PET tubes instead of polypropylene tubes for efficient cell recovery. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 100 × g for 2 minutes in a swinging-bucket rotor. After the supernatant was carefully removed, cells were resuspended in 1% FBS in PBS and pelleted again. About 50 μL liquid was retained to resuspend the cells, which was used for single cell capture (for scRNA-seq) or diluted in DMEM/F-12 medium for 3D culture.
Single cell capture and library construction were performed using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit (v2 Chemistry) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer. The 10x Genomics Cell Ranger (v3.0.1) software suite was used for demultiplexing, read alignment and UMI (unique molecule identifier) counting. The above steps were performed by the NIDCR Genomics and Computational Biology Core.
To calculate RNA velocity, the spliced and unspliced RNAs for each gene and each cell were counted using the command line tool velocyto.py following instructions on its tutorial website (“velocyto run10x”; see the next paragraph for the link) ( La Manno et al., 2018 22. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1950) PubMed Google Scholar ). The output loom file from the velocyto run contains the spliced and unspliced counts, which was merged into the AnnData object from the Scanpy (v1.6.0) ( Wolf et al., 2018 60. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (2975) PubMed Google Scholar ) analysis pipeline using the filtered features, barcodes and matrix output files from Cell Ranger. Genes with less than 20 total counts (spliced and unspliced) were filtered out, and the first and second order moments (i.e., mean and uncentered variance) of spliced and unspliced counts were computed. The moments were used to compute the RNA velocity vector (with the length of gene number after filtering) of each cell using the stochastic model of scVelo (v0.2.2) ( Bergen et al., 2020 4. Bergen, V. ∙ Lange, M. ∙ Peidli, S. ... Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling Nat.

Finally, the velocity vector was used to compute a velocity graph that summarizes the transition probabilities between all cells. This velocity graph was used to project the velocities into a low-dimensional UMAP embedding.

Ultra-low attachment 96-well V-bottom (S-bio, MS-9096VZ) plates were used for 3D culture of salivary gland epithelial buds (see Isolation of salivary gland epithelial rudiments ) or dissociated cells (see Single-cell dissociation of salivary gland epithelium ). One epithelial bud or ∼3,000 dissociated epithelial cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate with 50 μL DMEM/F-12 medium. Immediately after seeding, the plate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 3 min to sediment the epithelial bud or dissociated cells. 50 μL 2 × culture mix containing 400 ng/mL FGF7 (R&D Systems, 5028-KG-025), 2 × ITS supplement (Thermo Fisher, 41400045) and 1 mg/mL growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 356231; stock 9-10 mg/mL) were added to each well. This culture media was modified from ( Nakao et al., 2017 28. Nakao, A. ∙ Inaba, T. ∙ Murakami-Sekimata, A. ... Morphogenesis and Mucus Production of Epithelial Tissues of Three Major Salivary Glands of Embryonic Mouse in 3D Culture Zool. Sci. 2017; 34 :475-483 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). 20 ng/mL NRG1 (R&D Systems, 9875-NR-050) was also included in the 2 × culture mix in earlier experiments, but it was omitted later as follow-up studies showed removing it did not affect epithelial growth or branching. Surrounding wells were filled with 100 μL HBSS to reduce culture media evaporation. The plate was cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
smFISH probe sets targeting Cdh1, Sox2 and Sox10 mRNAs were designed using the Stellaris probe designer and synthesized with either TAMRA-C9 or Quasar 670 dyes by LGC Biosearch Technologies. smFISH of wholemount E13 salivary glands was performed as previously described ( Wang, 2019 57. Wang, S. Single Molecule RNA FISH (smFISH) in Whole-Mount Mouse Embryonic Organs Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2019; 83 :e79 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, E13 salivary glands were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour or overnight at 4°C, rinsed in PBSTx (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100), dehydrated sequentially in 30%, 50%, 70% and 100% methanol on ice, rehydrated sequentially in 70%, 50%, 30% methanol on ice, rinsed in PBSTx for 10 min at RT, permeabilized in 0.5% SDS in PBS at RT, equilibrated in smFISH Wash Solution (2 × SSC and 10% formamide in DEPC-treated water) for 10 min at RT, hybridized in smFISH Hybridization Solution (2 × SSC, 10% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate and 50 μg/mL yeast tRNAs in DEPC-treated water) containing 50 nM probes (1-2 nM each probe) at 37°C for 12 to 16 hours, washed in smFISH Wash Solution for 30 min at RT, stained with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI in smFISH Wash Solution for 2 hours at RT, washed 2 more times for 30 min at RT, rinsed in 2 × SSC (30 mM sodium citrate and 300 mM sodium chloride; K D Medical, RGF-3240) and mounted in ProLong Diamond Anti-fade Mountant (Thermo Fisher, P36961) for imaging.
smFISH dot counting was performed using a suite of custom-written ImageJ macros as previously described ( Wang, 2019 57. Wang, S. Single Molecule RNA FISH (smFISH) in Whole-Mount Mouse Embryonic Organs Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2019; 83 :e79 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, smFISH images were smoothened by a Gaussian filter, contrast enhanced by a morphological top-hat filter ( Legland et al., 2016 24. Legland, D. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Andrey, P. MorphoLibJ: integrated library and plugins for mathematical morphology with ImageJ Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :3532-3534 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ), and local maxima points beyond a user-specified threshold level were identified and counted. An identical set of parameters was used to process all images from the same experiment.
DMEM (Thermo Fisher, 11965118) and RPMI-1640 (ATCC, 30-2001) media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; GE Healthcare/Cytiva, SH30070.03), 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher, 25030081) and 1 × PenStrep to make DMEM Complete and RPMI-1640 Complete media. Phenol red-free DMEM (GE Healthcare/Cytiva, SH30284.01) or RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher, 11835030) were used when cells were used for imaging or cell sorting. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM Complete medium in 37°C incubators with 10% CO 2 . DLD-1 and DLD-1 derived cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 Complete medium in 37°C incubators with 5% CO 2 . For passage, cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher, 25300120) after rinsing with HBSS (Thermo Fisher, 14170161). Cell density was determined using an automated cell counter (Nexcelom Cellometer Auto 2000).
Ultra-low attachment 96-well U-bottom (Corning, 7007) or V-bottom (S-bio, MS-9096VZ) plates were used for 3D spheroid culture. DLD-1 cells expressing different sgRNAs were detached, pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 3 min, resuspended in RPMI-1640 Complete medium, counted and diluted to 60,000 cells/mL. For co-cultures of two cell types (e.g., sg-Control and sg-Cdh1 cells), appropriate volumes of the two cells were mixed in a separate tube to achieve desired mixing ratios. A multichannel pipette (Rainin, 17013810) was used to seed 50 μL cell suspensions in each well for 3,000 cells per spheroid. The 36 outer edge wells were filled with 100 μL HBSS to reduce medium evaporation over long culture periods (≥7 days). Immediately after seeding, the plate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 3 min to sediment the cells. The next day, a 2 × treatment mix of 44.8 μL RPMI-1640 Complete medium, 5 μL growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 356231; 9-10 mg/mL) and 0.2 μL DMSO (MilliporeSigma, D2650) or 50 mM abscisic acid (ABA; MilliporeSigma, A1049) was prepared for each well. A multichannel pipette was used to add 50 μL 2 × treatment mix to each well for a final concentration of 5% Matrigel (450-500 μg/mL) and 100 μM ABA. Care was taken to minimize bubbles during pipetting. For integrin stimulation by MnCl 2 , 0.1 μL 50 mM MnCl 2 was supplemented to every 50 μL 2 × treatment mix. For integrin antibody blocking, two rat monoclonal antibodies (mAb13: anti-β1-integrin; mAb16: anti-α5-integrin) were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL in RPMI-1640 and passed through a desalting spin column (Thermo Fisher, 89883) pre-equilibrated for 4 times with RPMI-1640. Antibody concentrations were re-measured by absorbance at 280 nm on a nanodrop spectrophotometer (Denovix, DS-11). The per-well 2 × treatment mix was adjusted to include 20 μL 0.5 mg/mL antibody solution, 19.4 μL RPMI-1640, 4.5 μL FBS, 0.45 μL 200 mM L-glutamine, 0.45 μL 100 × PenStrep, 5 μL Matrigel and 0.2 μL 50 mM ABA. Unless specified otherwise, DLD-1 spheroids were all cultured for 6 days from the day of Matrigel and ABA supplementation.
sgRNAs for target genes (Cdh1 or Itgb1) were designed on the CRISPOR ( Haeussler et al., 2016 15. Haeussler, M. ∙ Schönig, K. ∙ Eckert, H. ... Evaluation of off-target and on-target scoring algorithms and integration into the guide RNA selection tool CRISPOR Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :148 Crossref Scopus (1101) PubMed Google Scholar ) website using 500 bp sequences centered around the transcription start site (TSS ± 250 bp). sg1-Cdh1: 5′-gCCGAGAGGCTGCGGCTCCAA-3′. sg2-Cdh1: 5′-gTGGCCGGGGACGCCGAGCGA-3′. sg-Itgb1: 5′-GGACGCCGCGCGGAAAAGGT-3′. Control guide RNAs for both the S. pyogenes Cas9 (5′-gTGCGAATACGCCCACGCGAT-3′) and the S. aureus Cas9 (5′-gCCTTCCCAACAGTTGCGCAGC-3′) were designed from the bacterial lacZ gene against the human genome. An extra “g” was added to the 5′ end if the guide sequence did not begin with “g” to facilitate transcription by the U6 promoter.
All lentivirus work was performed using in a BSL2 room with a dedicated incubator. Lenti-sgRNA vectors (see plasmids ) were co-transfected with psPAX2 (Addgene, 12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, 12259) into HEK293T cells by calcium co-precipitation to produce infectious lentiviral particles. Briefly, 4 × 10 6 HEK293T cells were seeded in a 10 cm dish one day before packaging. Next morning, culture media were changed and supplemented with 25 μM chloroquine (MilliporeSigma, C6628). Two 15 mL tubes (A and B) were used to prepare the transfection mix. 1 mL 2 × HBS (50 mM HEPES, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7.10) was added to tube A. 10 μg of each plasmid (the lenti-sgRNA vector, psPAX2 and pMD2.G) and 1 mL 0.3 M CaCl 2 were sequentially added to tube B and mixed by pipetting. The DNA-CaCl 2 mixture in tube B was then added dropwise into the 2 × HBS in tube A and mixed by pipetting. The transfection mix was then added dropwise to the 10 cm dish. Culture media were changed twice at about 12- and 36-hours post transfection, and lentivirus-containing media were collected twice at about 36- and 60-hours post transfection into a 50 mL tube (stored at 4°C). Pooled lentivirus-containing media were passed through a 0.45 μm filter (MilliporeSigma, SE1M003M00) to remove cell debris. To concentrate the lentivirus, 4 mL 5 × PEG reagent (System Biosciences, LV825A-1) was added and mixed by pipetting. After ≥ 12 hours incubation at 4°C (up to 4 days), lentivirus was pelleted by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 μL DMEM/F-12 with 1 × PenStrep and stored at −80°C.
The titer of concentrated lentivirus was estimated using Lenti-X GoStix Plus (Takara, 631281) after 100 × dilution. A GoStix Value (GV) of 50 was empirically considered to be equivalent to a lentivirus titer of 5 × 10 5 IFU/mL. The typical titer of concentrated sgRNA lentivirus was 1.5 × 10 8 IFU/mL.
One day before transduction, 1 × 10 5 cells were seeded in a well of a 12-well plate. Next day, 2 μL 4 mg/mL polybrene (MilliporeSigma, H9268) was added to 1 mL medium (final 8 μg/mL). An appropriate amount of lentivirus for an MOI (multiplicity of infection; ratio of infectious viral particles to cells) of 10-15 (typically 20 μL for concentrated sgRNA lentivirus) was then added. One day later, the virus-containing medium was replaced with regular medium after 4 × HBSS washes, and cells were re-plated to a 75 cm 2 flask in culture medium supplemented with 20 μg/mL blasticidin (InvivoGen, ant-bl-1) to begin the antibiotic selection.
For cell sorting, DLD-1 derived cells were trypsinized for 5 min longer than for passage (∼15 min total) to increase the ratio of single cells, pelleted at 1,000 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in phenol-red free, serum-free RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher, 11835030) for a cell density of 5-10 × 10 6 /mL. The cell suspension was passed through a 40 μm Flowmi cell strainer (VWR, H13680-0040) and sorted on a BD FACSAria III or SONY SH800 cell sorter operated by the NIDCR Combined Technical Research Core.
DLD-1 derived cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning, 3512) at 20,000 cells/well on day 0, treated with DMSO vehicle or desired concentrations of ABA in DMSO on day 1 (or each day of days 1-5 per well for an ABA time course), and harvested on day 6. Culture media were changed once on day 4 or 5. For harvesting, 100 μL RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors (MilliporeSigma, 11836170001) was added to each well after rinsing with PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline; Lonza, 17-517Q). Cells were scraped into RIPA buffer on ice using 1 mL pipette tips. Cell suspensions were transferred to pre-cooled 1.5 mL tubes (Eppendorf, 022363212), incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 × rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Cleared cell lysates were transferred to a new set of pre-cooled 1.5 mL tubes and stored at −20°C. Protein concentrations of cell lysates were determined by Bradford assays (Bio-Rad, 5000201). Lysate aliquots with 16 μg protein were denatured in 1 × Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad, 1610747) for 5 min at 95°C. Samples of 8 μg protein or 10 μL protein ladder (Thermo Fisher, 26623) were loaded per lane onto a precast gel (Bio-Rad, 4561096) for electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, 1704159) using the Turbo Transfer system (Bio-Rad, 1704150). The membrane was stained with Ponceau S (MilliporeSigma, P7170) to assess transfer quality, washed for 5 min in TBST (Tris Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween-20; Quality Biological, 351-086-101; MilliporeSigma, P2287) to remove Ponceau staining, blocked in Blocking Solution (5% nonfat dry milk in TBST) for 30 min at room temperature (RT), incubated in primary antibodies (see antibody usage for western blotting ) diluted in Blocking Solution overnight at 4°C, washed 4 × 5 min with TBST at RT, incubated in LI-COR secondary antibodies diluted in Blocking Solution for 1-2 hours at RT, washed 4 × 5 min in TBST at RT, and imaged on a LI-COR Odyssey CLx imaging system controlled by LI-COR Image Studio software. Western blotting band intensities were quantified using LI-COR Image Studio Lite software.
Primary antibodies used for western blotting: anti-E-cadherin (Thermo Fisher, 13-1900), 0.5 μg/mL; anti-β-catenin (Abcam, ab32572), 1:5,000 (0.0126 μg/mL); anti-β1-integrin (MilliporeSigma, MABT821), 1 μg/mL; anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 2118L), 1:2,000; anti-α-tubulin (MilliporeSigma, T6199), 0.5 μg/mL. All western blotting secondary antibodies were from LI-COR and used at 1:5,000 for 800CW conjugates and 1:10,000 for 680RD conjugates.
Cells were seeded, immunostained and imaged in 8-well ibidi chambers (ibidi, 80826). All procedures were performed at room temperature with gentle rocking. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with PBSTx for 15 min, blocked in 5% donkey serum in PBS for 30 min, incubated in primary antibodies (see antibody usage for immunostaining ) diluted in PBS for 1 hour, washed 4 × 5 min with PBS, incubated in 0.5 μg/mL DAPI (Thermo Fisher, D1306) and secondary antibodies diluted in PBS for 1 hour, washed 4 × 5 min with PBS, stored at 4°C and imaged within 3 days.
For immunostaining not involving keratins or prelabeled hamster anti-β1 integrin antibodies, spheroids were rinsed in 2 mL PBS in a 35 mm dish and transferred into sample baskets (one basket per staining group; Intavis, 12.440) using low-retention pipette tips (cut for larger opening; Rainin, 30389187 or 30389190) under a dissecting microscope. For fixation, each basket was soaked in 1 mL fixative (4% PFA in PBS; Electron Microscopy Sciences, 15710) in a well of a 24-well plate (Corning, 3524) overnight at 4°C (all incubations were with gentle rocking). Cultured salivary glands were fixed on the filter by replacing Organ Culture Medium under the filter with 200 μL fixative for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 4°C. Fixed glands were detached from the filter and transferred into sample baskets in PBS in a 35 mm dish using a pair of forceps (Fine Science Tools, 11251-20) under a dissecting microscope. Fixed samples in baskets were permeabilized in PBSTx (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100; Thermo Fisher, 28314) for 30 min at RT, blocked in 5% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 017-000-121) in PBSTx for 2 hours at RT, incubated in primary antibodies (see antibody usage for immunostaining ) diluted in either PBSTx or 5% donkey serum for 2 days at 4°C, washed 4 × 15 min in PBSTx at RT, incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in either PBSTx or 5% donkey serum for 2 days at 4°C, washed 4 × 15 min in PBSTx at RT, rinsed in PBS and mounted under a dissecting microscope. To preserve fluorescence and to minimize compression, samples were mounted in 20 or 40 μL antifade mountant (Thermo Fisher, P36930) supported by one layer (for salivary glands) or two layers (for spheroids) of imaging spacers (Grace Bio-labs, 654004) attached to a glass slide (Thermo Fisher, 3011-002).
For immunostaining of mesenchyme-free salivary gland epithelial cultures with prelabeled hamster anti-β1 integrin antibodies (Atto-565-labeled Hamster anti-β1-integrin; see protein labeling ; clone Ha2/5, IgM, BD Biosciences 555002), the PFA fixation and permeabilization steps were identical to above, but a much higher antibody concentration (10 μg/mL) was used and the incubation time was extended to 6 days at 4°C, because of anticipated tissue penetration difficulties using IgM antibodies, which are 5 times as large as typical IgG antibodies.
For immunostaining of keratins (KRT19), spheroids and salivary glands were fixed in 1 mL ice-cold 1:1 mixture of acetone and methanol in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and incubated for 1 hour to overnight at −20°C. The mixture of acetone and methanol was exchanged to 100% methanol for longer storage. Before staining, samples were re-hydrated in a sequential methanol gradient (70%, 50%, 30%, 0% methanol in PBSTx) on ice for 5 min incubation at each step. The remaining procedures were identical to those for PFA-fixed samples as described above (beginning from permeabilization by PBSTx).
Primary antibodies used for immunostaining: anti-E-cadherin (Thermo Fisher, 13-1900), 1 μg/mL; anti-collagen type IV (MilliporeSigma, AB769), 2 μg/mL; anti-laminin (MilliporeSigma, L9393), 2.5 μg/mL; anti-histone H3 (phospho S10) (Abcam, ab47297), 1 μg/mL; anti-β1-integrin (MilliporeSigma, MABT821), 1 μg/mL; anti-Claudin 10 (Thermo Fisher, 38-8400), 1 μg/mL; anti-KRT19 (DSHB, TROMA-III-c), 2 μg/mL; anti-α6-integrin (clone GoH3, BD Biosciences, 555734), 2 μg/mL; anti-α9-integrin (R&D Systems, AF3827-SP), 1 μg/mL; Atto-565-labeled Hamster anti-β1-integrin (see Protein labeling ; clone Ha2/5, BD Biosciences 555002), 10 μg/mL. All immunostaining secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch (an equal volume of glycerol was added for storage at −20°C after reconstitution as instructed) and used at 1:200 (1.5-3 μg/mL).
Hamster anti-β1-integrin (BD Biosciences,), isotype-matched control IgM (BD Biosciences,), rat anti-α6-integrin (BD Biosciences, 555734) and isotype-matched control IgG (BD Biosciences, 553992) were used at 100 μg/mL each for function blocking or control after overnight dialysis into 1 l DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 1 × PenStrep at 4°C with gentle agitation, using a dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher, 66383).
Rat anti-β1-integrin (in-house clone mAb13; available from MilliporeSigma, MABT821) was used at 100 μg/mL for function blocking. Rat anti-α5-integrin (in-house clone mAb16; available from MilliporeSigma, MABT820) was used at 100 μg/mL. Stock antibodies (1.9-5 mg/mL) were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL in RPMI-1640 medium and further exchanged to RPMI-1640 medium using spin desalting columns (Thermo Fisher, 89882) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Tissue clearing was performed for the images shown in Figure 6 G to enable imaging over 200 μm thickness. For tissue clearing, regular immunostaining steps were carried out except for mounting. Spheroids were instead sequentially transferred to each well of a 3-well silicone chamber slide (ibidi, 80381), each containing 500 μL CytoVista clearing reagent (Thermo Fisher, V11315). After 5 min incubation in the last well, spheroids were transferred to 200 μL CytoVista clearing reagent per well of an 8-well glass-bottom ibidi chamber (ibidi, 80827) for imaging with two-photon microscopy (see Immunostaining light microscopy ). Note that this clearing reagent preserved mScarlet but not mNeonGreen fluorescence.
DLD-1 derived cells (sg-Control, sg1-Cdh1, sg2-Cdh1 and sg-Itgb1) were pre-treated with 100 μM ABA for 5-10 days before being used. The glass surface of MatTek 6-well plates (MatTek, P06G-0-14-F) was coated with 200 μL 91 μg/mL Matrigel in PBS or 8 μg/mL E-cadherin extracellular domain (E-cad-ECD; R&D Systems, 8505-EC-050) in PBS for 1-3 hours at 37°C. Coated wells were rinsed once with 3 mL PBS, blocked with 2 mL 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA; MilliporeSigma, 10735108001) in PBS for 30 min at 37°C, and washed twice with 3 mL PBS. During the blocking step, cells were detached, pelleted, resuspended, counted and diluted to 5 × 10 4 cells/mL. 2 mL cell suspension was seeded in each well. 3 or 4 wells were used per experimental group. After 15 min (for Matrigel coating) or 2 hours (for E-cad-ECD coating) incubation at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , unattached cells were removed from each well, which was then gently washed 3 × with 3 mL PBS, fixed with 2 mL 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at 37°C, washed 2 × with 3 mL PBS, and imaged under a microscope (see Live-spheroid imaging and cell-attachment assay imaging ) to quantify attached cell densities (see Image processing and analysis). For assay consistency, a 2 mL aspirating pipette was capped with a 200 μL pipette tip to attenuate vacuum strength, and the house vacuum valve was pre-adjusted using PBS to reach a liquid removal rate of ∼1 mL/second. During liquid removal and addition, tips of aspirating or transferring pipettes were always placed to the side of the bottom of the MatTek well away from the coated glass surface, resulting in ∼200 μL leftover liquid between washes. Care was taken throughout the assay to avoid agitating the plates. The incubation time for each coating was determined to be the time at which ∼50% of control cells were attached in pilot assays.
All microscopy systems for live imaging were equipped with an environmental chamber to maintain samples at 37°C with 50% humidity and 5% CO 2 . The custom-built environmental chamber (Precision Plastics Inc., Beltsville, MD, USA) is comprised of black Lucite to block environmental light, and it encloses the entire upper body of the microscope with two front doors through which samples can be loaded onto the stage. Temperature and humidity was maintained by heated circulating air controlled by a temperature/humidity controller (Air-Therm ATX-H; Model # 300391; World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL, USA) connected to a humidifier (Model # V5100NS; Kaz USA Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA). CO 2 level was maintained by CO 2 infusion controlled by a controller unit (S/N: 827-1009; OKOLAB, Ambridge, PA, USA). Transgenic salivary glands expressing fluorescent markers were isolated and cultured on a floating 13 mm filter at 37°C with 5% CO 2 (see Salivary gland isolation and culture ) for at least 1 hour before being mounted for live imaging. Double-adhesive imaging spacers (Grace Bio-labs, 654008; cut into 8 separated wells, each 120 μm thick with 9 mm diameter opening) were sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol for 3 min and attached to the glass bottoms of 50 mm MatTek dishes (MatTek, P50G-1.5-30-F). Under a dissecting microscope, 5 μL Organ Culture Medium was transferred to the center of the imaging spacer, and the filter with glands was flipped onto the imaging spacer so that glands were sandwiched between the filter and the glass bottom. Care was taken to ensure the filter was flat and center-aligned with the imaging spacer. The edge of the filter was pressed to ensure tight adherence to the imaging spacer. 2 mL Organ Culture Medium was then added to the MatTek dish, which was incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 for at least 2 hours before imaging. A Nikon 40 ×, 1.15 NA, Apo LWD, water-immersion objective or a Nikon 25 ×, 1.05 NA, Plan Apo, silicone-immersion objective was used for live-organ imaging using two-photon microscopy on a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope System equipped with a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent, Chameleon Vision II). Image acquisition was controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software. Images were acquired at 2 μm z intervals over 100 μm thickness and 5 min intervals for 20-36 hours. The tunable laser was used at 950 nm for simultaneous two-photon excitation of histone-EGFP and membrane-tdTomato (or heterozygous Krt14p::RFP), and 920 nm for histone-EGFP and homozygous Krt14p::RFP. The laser power was adjusted to compensate for z-depth changes using the “Z Intensity Correction” option with criteria that the bulk histograms of both channels spanned 500-1500 gray values (at typically 1%–8% or 12-100 mW power).
Single-bud and single-cell salivary gland epithelial cultures (referred to “spheroids” hereafter; see 3D culture of primary salivary gland epithelial buds or dissociated cells ) from transgenic salivary glands were mounted in custom-assembled imaging chambers (see below) and imaged by two-photon microscopy using the same system and imaging setup steps as described in Live-organ imaging of intact salivary glands by two-photon microscopy . To assemble the imaging chamber, a 4-well silicone chamber was removed from an ibidi dish (ibidi, 80466) and attached to a glass-bottom Bioinert dish (ibidi, 81150). 2 mL 2% agarose (MilliporeSigma, A9539) in DMEM/F12 medium were dissolved by heating in a microwave and added outside of the silicone chamber to hold the chamber to prevent detaching from the Bioinert surface. 30 μL 2% agarose was added inside each chamber to form a thin agarose pad and incubated for 5 min at room temperature to allow the agarose to solidify. A 30 μL glass micropipette (Drummond Scientific Company, Cat # 2-000-030) was used to poke 1 or 2 micro wells in each chamber toward the center of the dish bottom. 100 μL DMEM/F12 medium was added to each well, and a pair of forceps was used to remove the agarose insert from each micro well to expose the glass surface. The medium in each well was then replaced by 80 μL DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 200 ng/mL FGF7 (R&D Systems, 5028-KG-025), 1 × ITS supplement (Thermo Fisher, 41400045) and 0.5 mg/mL growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 356231; stock 9-10 mg/mL). Spheroids were transferred from the 96-well plate into the imaging chamber using low-retention pipette tips (cut for larger opening; Rainin, 30389190) and each spheroid was gently pushed into one micro well for immobilization during live imaging. Immediately before imaging, 1 mL DMEM/F12 medium was added on top of the agarose pad outside the silicone chambers to help maintain humidity. Spheroid cultures from dissociated salivary gland epithelial cells need to be cultured for 1 day in 96-well plates to allow spheroid formation before being mounted for imaging.
E13 KikGR transgenic glands were cultured on the filter with Organ Culture Medium supplemented with 5 μg/mL AF680-anti-collagen IV (see Protein labeling ) for ∼10 hours. Under a dissecting microscope, a 10 μL pipette tip was used to spot vacuum grease (MilliporeSigma, 18405) around glands on the filter, which was then flipped onto the glass area of a 35 mm dish (MatTek, P35G-1.5-20-C). The vacuum grease limited gland compression and also served as a bio-inert glue to adhere the filter to the glass. 2 mL Organ Culture Medium supplemented with 1 μg/mL AF680-anti-collagen IV (see Protein labeling ) were added to the dish for imaging after 2 hours incubation at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . A Nikon 40 ×, 1.15 NA, Apo LWD, water-immersion objective was used for photoconversion and imaging on a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope System equipped with 4 laser lines (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 640 nm; Nikon LU-N4). Photoconversion and image acquisition were controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software. For photoconversion, a 405 nm laser was used at 1%–5% power (0.15-0.75 mW) with the pinhole set at 1 AU (Airy Unit; 30.7 μm) to stimulate user-specified polygonal ROIs (Regions of Interest) in the “ND Stimulation” module of the software. Short 1-5 s pulses (depending on ROI sizes) were repeated until all green fluorescence inside ROIs was converted to red fluorescence. For image acquisition, 488 nm and 561 nm lasers were used at 2% power (0.3 mW), whereas the 640 nm laser was used at 5% (0.75 mW) with the pinhole set at 1.2 AU (58.7 μm). Images were acquired at 10 min time intervals and 2 μm z intervals.
Live-spheroid imaging (time-lapse or single-time-point) and cell-attachment assay imaging were performed by phase contrast and epifluorescence microscopy using a Nikon 10 ×, 0.3 NA, Plan Fluor objective on a Nikon Ti-E brightfield microscope system with a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4.0 V3 sCMOS camera. Spheroids were imaged in the same 96-well U-bottom or V-bottom plates for culture. Image acquisition was controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software. The JOBS module of the software was used to automatically set up multiple positions in a 96-well plate (spheroids) or a 6-well plate (cell attachment assay). For time-lapse live-spheroid imaging by confocal microscopy, spheroids were incubated in 40 μg/mL Atto647N-fibronectin (see Protein labeling ) overnight at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and transferred into a 4-well 35 mm dish (ibidi, 80466), each well of which contained 2 or 3 spheroids in 100 μL spheroid culture medium with 10 μg/mL Atto647N-fibronectin. A Nikon 20 ×, 0.75 NA, Plan Apo objective was used on a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope System equipped with 4 laser lines. A resonant scanner was used for high-speed laser scanning. Image acquisition was controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software at 10 min time intervals and 2 μm z intervals.
Immunostained spheroids in Figure 6 G were imaged by two-photon microscopy using a Nikon 20 ×, 0.75 NA objective on a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope System equipped with a Ti:sapphire laser (used at 760 nm, 3% or 90 mW) controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software. All other immunostained spheroids and salivary glands were imaged by laser scanning confocal microscopy using Nikon 20 ×, 0.75 NA or 60 ×, 1.4 NA Plan Apo objectives on a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope System controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software or a Zeiss 20 ×, 0.75 NA or 63 ×, 1.4 NA Plan Apo objective on a Zeiss LSM 880 system controlled by Zeiss ZEN software. Immunostained tissue culture cells were imaged using a Nikon 40 ×, 1.25 NA, Plan Apo, silicone-immersion objective on a Nikon spinning disk confocal system equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 unit and a Prime 95B sCMOS camera (Photometrics) controlled by Nikon NIS-Elements software.
Human plasma fibronectin was purified as previously described ( Akiyama, 1999 2. Akiyama, S.K. Purification of fibronectin Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 1999; 2 :1-13 Google Scholar ). For fibronectin labeling, NHS-Atto647N (ATTO-TEC, AD 647N-31) was dissolved in DMSO to 10 mM and stored in a desiccated container at −20°C as 10 μL aliquots. Labeling buffer was 20 parts PBS with 1 part 0.2 M NaHCO 3 (pH 9.0), which was adjusted to pH 8.3. For labeling, 1 mL fibronectin was exchanged to the labeling buffer using a spin desalting column (Thermo Fisher, 89891). The fibronectin concentration after buffer exchange was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (2.3 mg/mL), which was used to calculate the amount of NHS-Atto647N equivalent to 4 × times molar excess of fibronectin (3.4 μL). The labeling mix was incubated for 45 min at room temperature, then unlabeled dye was removed by buffer exchange into PBS using a spin desalting column. Insoluble Atto647N-fibronectin was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The concentration of cleared Atto647N-fibronectin and the degree of labeling (DOL) were calculated from absorbance at 280 nm and 646 nm with a dye-specific correction factor 0.03 (using the Atto calculation formula; 0.84 mg/mL, DOL 1.7). Atto647N-fibronectin was then aliquoted and stored at −80°C. A similar procedure was used to label the hamster anti-β1 antibody (Ha2/5) with NHS-Atto565 (ATTO-TEC, AD 565-31) and the goat collagen IV antibody (MilliporeSigma, AB769) with NHS-AF680 (Thermo Fisher, A20008). For collagen IV antibody labeling, a 50 mM borate buffer (pH 9.0) was used as the labeling buffer and labeled antibodies were stored in PBS at 4°C.
All images acquired on the Nikon A1R Confocal System were denoised using the Denoise.ai function of the Nikon NIS-Elements software. All other image processing was performed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 42. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ), an ImageJ distribution. Customized Python, Jython and ImageJ Macro scripts were used for automating or facilitating image analysis and data visualization in this study (see Data and code availability ).
DLD-1 spheroids containing only sg-Control cells cultured for 7 days were used for AFM measurements to minimize effects of complex tissue geometries. To immobilize spheroids, CellTak (Corning, 354240) was coated at ∼3.5 μg/cm 2 inside a 4-well silicone chamber (removed from ibidi, 80466; reusable for many times) attached to the center area of the glass bottom of a specialized AFM dish (World Precision Instruments, FluoroDish FD35-100). For coating of each dish, 5.4 μL 1 mg/mL CellTak was added to 300 μL 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.0; accurate pH is important). Immediately before dispensing, 2.7 μL 1N NaOH was added to the CellTak solution and vortexed. 75 μL was dispensed into each well and coating incubation was between 30 min and 4 hours. When the AFM system was ready, CellTak coating solution was removed and the coated wells were rinsed once with water. The borders of coated area were marked on the outside bottom of the AFM dish to facilitate sample locating during AFM measurements. The silicone chamber was removed and the AFM dish was filled with 3 mL warm RPMI-1640 Complete medium. 10-15 spheroids were rinsed 4-6 times in 2 mL RPMI-1640 Complete medium in a clean 24-well plate under a dissecting scope until milky carryover matrix condensates were removed. Spheroids were transferred using low-retention pipette tips (cut for larger opening; Rainin, 30389190). Cleaned spheroids were transferred into the AFM dish and arranged toward the center of the coated area. A pair of forceps with blunt tips were used to gently push each spheroid against the glass bottom to aid immobilization by CellTak. The AFM dish was then carefully transferred and mounted in the sample holder with a heating stage.
AFM measurements were performed using a Bruker JPK NanoWizard 4XP BioScience AFM system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) mounted on an inverted Axio Observer.7 microscope system (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) equipped with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope 900 with Airyscan 2 and Multiplex module (LSM 900, Carl Zeiss) and a 10 × (0.6 NA, Plan-Apochromat) objective (Carl Zeiss). A Petri dish heating stage (Bruker) was used to maintain a physiological temperature of 37°C for spheroids during measurements. Modified AFM microcantilevers with an attached 35 μm polystyrene microsphere were obtained from Novascan (Novascan, Ames, IA; Catalog # PT.PS.SN.35.CAL.). The AFM probe spring constant was obtained using the thermal tune methods built in the AFM system. Calibrated spring constant for cantilevers ranged from 0.173-0.577 N/m. After cantilever calibration, the AFM probe was moved on top of an immobilized spheroid to perform the quasi-static force spectroscopy measurements. The applied force was set to be 1-2 nN for spheroids cultured without the matrix and 3-5 nN for spheroids cultured with matrix supplement, yielding an indentation of 2-3 μm. The force curve ramp rate was set to 0.5 Hz and the speed ranged between 2-6 μm/s. For each spheroid, 5 consecutive force-indentation curves were collected to obtain the average value of measurements.

Below, we will first derive the boundary condition for the sphere to expand without changing shape (uniform spherical expansion).
The volumes of each compartment: 𝑉 𝐼 = 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑟 3 3 (eq.1) 𝑉 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 = 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ ( 𝑟 + ℎ ) 3 3 (eq.2) 𝑉 𝑆 = 𝑉 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 − 𝑉 𝐼 (eq.3) The cell number in each compartment: 𝑁 𝐼 = 𝑉 𝐼 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 (eq.4) 𝑁 𝑆 = 𝑉 𝑆 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 (eq.5) The expansion rate of cell numbers in each compartment: 𝑅 𝐼 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑁 𝐼 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 (eq.6) 𝑅 𝑆 = 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 (eq.7) Substituting Equations 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 into Equations 6 and 7 , we get: 𝑅 𝐼 = 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑟 2 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 (eq.8) 𝑅 𝑆 = 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ ( 2 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ ℎ + ℎ 2 ) 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 (eq.9) From definitions 11-12: 𝛼 = 𝑅 𝐼 𝑅 𝑆 (eq.10) 𝛽 = 𝑟 ℎ (eq.11) Substituting Equations 8 , 9 , and 11 into Equation 10 , we get: 𝛼 = 𝛽 2 2 ⁢ 𝛽 + 1 (eq.12) Equation 12 gives the boundary condition for uniform spherical expansion. When 𝛼 > 𝛽 2 2 ⁢ 𝛽 + 1 , the interior expands faster than the surface layer and will thus disrupt tissue integrity. Conversely, when 𝛼 < 𝛽 2 2 ⁢ 𝛽 + 1 , the surface layer expands faster and will promote budding.
We could experimentally quantify the apparent cell proliferation rates in each compartment ( 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐴 and 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 ) by immunostaining for a mitosis marker (phospho-Histone H3) and measuring the cross-sectional area of interior epithelium ( 𝑆 ) using E-cadherin staining. In order to estimate 𝛼 and 𝛽 from experimentally measurable values, we derive the following parameter relationships.
From definitions 13-20: 𝑅 𝐼 = 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑁 𝐼 + 𝜏 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 − 𝜏 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 (eq.13) 𝑅 𝑆 = 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 − 𝜏 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 + 𝜏 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 (eq.14) 𝛿 = 𝑉 𝐼 𝑉 𝑆 (eq.15) 𝜔 = 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐴 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 (eq.16) From assumptions 4-8: 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 = 0 (eq.17) 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 = 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐴 (eq.18) 𝜏 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 = 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 (eq.19) From assumptions 5, 9 and definitions 24-27: Δ ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 = 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 (eq.20) Δ ⁢ 𝑁 𝐵 = 2 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 (eq.21) 𝐾 = 𝑒 − 𝑐 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝐸 (eq.22) Both the loss of surface cells and increase of new subsurface cells contribute to 𝜏 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 through re-distribution of low E-cadherin cells between surface and subsurface layers to achieve equilibrium, so: 𝜏 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 = Δ ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 𝐾 + 1 + 𝐾 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝑁 𝐵 𝐾 + 1 (eq.23) Substituting Equations 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , and 23 into Equation 10 : 𝛼 = 𝜔 ⁢ 𝛿 𝑒 − 𝑐 ⁢ Δ ⁢ 𝐸 + 𝜔 ⁢ 𝛿 − 1 (eq.24) Substituting Equations 1 , 2 , 3 , and 11 into Equation 15 : 𝛿 = 1 ( 1 + 1 / 𝛽 ) 3 − 1 (eq.25) We could use Equation 24 to estimate 𝛼 from experimentally measurable values as follows.
First, from experimental observation of the surface cell residence ratio under normal conditions (0.930), the estimated 𝐾 = 1 3 . 2 8 5 .
Second, the interior-to-surface volume ratio ̃ 𝛿 can be calculated from the size ratio ̃ 𝛽 using Equation 25. To estimate the geometrical ratio ̃ 𝛽 , we measured the middle cross-sectional area of the interior epithelium 𝑆 and estimated the horizontal interior radius ̃ 𝑟 as the radius of a circle with area 𝑆 . The surface layer thickness ̃ ℎ is consistently ∼15 μm. Thus, we have: ̃ 𝑟 = √ 𝑆 / 𝜋 (eq.26) ̃ 𝛽 = √ 𝑆 / 𝜋 1 5 (eq.27) Third, to estimate the apparent cell proliferation ratio ̃ 𝜔 , we immunostained salivary glands with the mitosis marker phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3) and estimated ̃ 𝜔 as the interior-to-surface ratio of normalized pHH3-positive areas.
Substituting the above estimated values to Equation 24 to calculate ̃ 𝛼 : ̃ 𝛼 = 0 . 9 3 0 ⁢ ̃ 𝜔 ⁢ ̃ 𝛿 − 1 (eq.28)
Parameter changes in experimental perturbations
𝛼 is the interior-to-surface volume expansion ratio. Intuitively, a smaller value of 𝛼 below the boundary condition of uniform spherical expansion (given by Equation 12 ) promotes extra surface production and causes budding. From Equation 24 , we can see that 𝛼 is positively correlated with 𝜔 , 𝛿 and Δ ⁢ 𝐸 , which are the interior-to-surface apparent proliferation ratio ( 𝜔 ), the interior-to-surface volume ratio ( 𝛿 ) and the free energy difference when a subsurface low E-cadherin cell inserts into the surface layer ( Δ ⁢ 𝐸 ).
When a subsurface cell inserts into the surface layer, the following changes will cost free energy: 1 To stretch and bend the basement membrane ( 𝐸 1 ). 2 To deform and move neighboring cells ( 𝐸 2 ). 3 To break contact between the new surface cell and previous neighbors ( 𝐸 3 ). 4 To break the contact opened up between surface cells ( 𝐸 4 ).
Second, it releases free energy from the following changes: 5 To establish contact between previous neighboring cells ( 𝐸 5 ). 6 To establish contact between the new surface cell and other surface cells ( 𝐸 6 ). 7 To establish contact between the new surface cell and basement membrane ( 𝐸 7 ).
Overall, the free energy difference is: Δ ⁢ 𝐸 = 𝐸 1 + 𝐸 2 + 𝐸 3 + 𝐸 4 − 𝐸 5 − 𝐸 6 − 𝐸 7 (eq.29) Comparing before and after states, most cells have retained the same types and sizes of contacting surface, except for the new surface cell, which has a net loss of cell-cell contact and a net gain of cell-matrix contact that is the size of its bottom (basal) area ( 𝑆 B ). Denoting the binding energy between cell-cell or cell-matrix contact per unit area as 𝑒 c c and 𝑒 c m , we have: 𝐸 3 + 𝐸 4 − 𝐸 5 − 𝐸 6 = 𝑒 c c ⁢ 𝑆 𝐵 (eq.30) 𝐸 7 = 𝑒 c m ⁢ 𝑆 𝐵 (eq.31) Substituting Equations 30 and 31 to Equation 29 , we get: Δ ⁢ 𝐸 = ( 𝑒 c c − 𝑒 c m ) ⁢ 𝑆 𝐵 + 𝐸 1 + 𝐸 2 (eq.32) Equation 32 can help us to predict and understand the effects of various perturbations: 1 Downregulating E-cadherin in peripheral cells reduces 𝑒 c c and promotes budding. 2 Integrin blocking reduces 𝑒 c m and inhibits budding. 3 Ablating the basement membrane by collagenase reduces 𝑒 c m close to 0, which makes Δ ⁢ 𝐸 positive and thermodynamically not favorable. 4 Low-concentration collagenase treatment presumably softens the basement membrane, which makes it easier to stretch and thus reduces 𝐸 1 . At the same time, softened matrix has weaker interaction with cells and reduces 𝑒 c m . In this case, whether Δ ⁢ 𝐸 increases or decreases depends on the magnitude of 𝐸 1 and 𝑒 c m changes. Our experimental results suggest the reduction of 𝑒 c m dominates. 5 Inhibiting MMP activity by BB-94 or GM-6001 makes the basement membrane thicker and harder to stretch, which increases 𝐸 1 and inhibits budding. It is important to note that although BB-94 treatment significantly increases the basement membrane thickness, the intrinsic stiffness as measured by its apparent Young’s modulus remains unchanged. Therefore, we do not expect 𝑒 c m to change.
All statistical analysis was performed using customized Python scripts (see Data and code availability ). Comparisons of 2 groups of paired or independent data were performed using paired or unpaired two-sided Student’s t test, respectively. For comparisons of the expression of many genes between 2 subgroups of the scRNA-seq data, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Pairwise comparisons of 3 or more groups were performed using Tukey’s HSD test. When the raw data did not meet the homogeneity of variance requirement of Tukey’s test, statistical comparisons were performed on log-transformed data (e.g., comparisons of Young’s moduli derived from AFM). Error bars in all plots represent 95% confidence intervals. Details of sample number, data representation, and statistical comparison method of each plot can be found in the figures and figure legends.
Automatic 3D cell tracking and surface rendering were performed using Imaris 9.5.0 (Bitplane). Manual curation of semi-automatic cell tracking was performed in Fiji using the TrackMate ( Tinevez et al., 2017 54. Tinevez, J.Y. ∙ Perry, N. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrackMate: An open and extensible platform for single-particle tracking Methods. 2017; 115 :80-90 Crossref Scopus (1886) PubMed Google Scholar ) plugin. Manual surface reconstruction was performed by drawing polylines along the epithelial surface at sparse z planes (∼6 μm intervals) on x-y view and resliced y-z view image stacks in Fiji, which were used for interpolation and plotting using customized Python scripts (see Data and code availability ).
To determine the “on-surface ratio” of surface cells in control or collagenase-treated salivary glands, newly returned or randomly selected pre-existing surface cells were manually tracked using TrackMate (Fiji plugin) for an average of 5.4 hours (control) or 5.1 hours (collagenase). The “on-surface ratio” was calculated as the weighted average of the proportion of time frames that the tracked cell was at the epithelial surface (weighted by the total tracked time of each cell).
Automated segmentation of mesenchymal cells were performed using cellpose ( cellpose.org ) ( Stringer et al., 2021 52. Stringer, C. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Michaelos, M. ... Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :100-106 Crossref Scopus (1083) PubMed Google Scholar ). Segmented masks were used to compute shape metrics using customized Python scripts (see Data and code availability ).
For quantification of phospho-Histone H3 (pHH3) staining, the pHH3 image was binarized by automatic thresholding followed by Gaussian filtering to measure the area covered by pHH3 fluorescence. To quantify the % pHH3 area in different regions of interest (ROIs), the epithelial ROI was segmented from E-cadherin staining, whereas the total cell-occupied tissue ROI was segmented from DAPI staining, both by automatic thresholding followed by Gaussian filtering. The mesenchymal ROI was computed by subtracting the epithelial ROI from the tissue ROI. When a whole epithelial bud was within the field of view, epithelial ROIs were shrunk by 15 μm to obtain the interior epithelium ROI, which was subtracted from the epithelial ROI to obtain a ring-shaped surface epithelium ROI. When only part of the epithelial bud was included in the image, the initial epithelial ROI and the 15 μm-shrunk interior epithelium ROI were both intersected with a user-drawn polygon ROI to obtain two pie-slice-shaped ROIs that only differed by a fan-shaped surface-layer ROI. The % pHH3 area of each ROI was calculated as the ratio of pHH3 area to the total ROI area. Parameters of Gaussian filtering and automatic thresholding were kept consistent for all images in the same dataset for comparison.
For automated cell counting in the attachment assay, nuclear fluorescence images were smoothed by Gaussian filter (sigma = 2 pixels), contrast enhanced by the MorphoLibJ ( Legland et al., 2016 24. Legland, D. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Andrey, P. MorphoLibJ: integrated library and plugins for mathematical morphology with ImageJ Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :3532-3534 Crossref Scopus (783) PubMed Google Scholar ) white top hat filter (disk, radius = 10), binarized and counted using the Analyze Particles function of ImageJ.
For manual bud counting, several efforts were made to minimize bias. First, file names of all images were scrambled before counting for observer blinding. Second, the same investigator performed the counting of all spheroids (K.M.) or all salivary glands (S.W.) to avoid between-person variance. Third, an explicit criterion was used such that a bud was counted only when the convex edge occupied at least one third of a circle. Finally, S.W. decoded and plotted the counting.
For quantification of the percentage of protruded bud area in DLD-1 spheroids, a similar observer-blinded procedure was used as above. First, file names of all images were scrambled. Second, K.M. manually drew a polygon along the spheroid perimeter excluding protruding buds delineated by a straight line drawn between the bottoms of bud clefts. This polygon encloses the spheroid interior and its area is measured as Area_in . Third, S.W. ran a script (available on Github; see Data and code availability ) that automatically segmented the total occupied area of each spheroid from the bright fluorescence images by automatic thresholding after image smoothing with a Gaussian filter ( Area_total ; see Figure S6 B). Fourth, S.W. decoded the data from K.M. for the interior area of spheroids, calculated the percentage of protruded bud area ( %Protruded bud area = 100 × ( Area_total - Area_ in) / Area_total ) and plotted them.
The DLD-1 spheroids apparent Young’s modulus (E, in Pa) was calculated by fitting each recorded force-indentation curve with the Hertz contact mechanics model for a rigid spherical probe indenting an infinite isotropic elastic half-space: 𝑭 𝑯 𝒆 𝒓 𝒕 𝒛 = 4 ⁢ 𝑬 ⁢ √ 𝑹 ⁢ 𝜹 3 / 2 3 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝝊 2 ) In the above equation, 𝑭 is the applied force, 𝑬 is the elastic Young’s modulus, 𝝊 is the Poisson’s ratio (assumed to be 0.5 for soft material), 𝑹 is the radius of the AFM probe (17.5 μm), and 𝜹 is the spheroid indentation. AFM data analysis was performed using the JPK SPM Data Processing software. A 2 μm deformation range was selected from near the maximum indentation to fit the Hertz model.
Model assumptions and parameter constraints: 1 All epithelial cells are tightly packed with no empty spaces. 2 The average cell size 𝑉 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 is constant, so the net volume is proportional to cell number. 3 The initial epithelium contains an interior sphere with radius 𝑟 enveloped by a surface layer with a constant thickness ℎ = 1 5 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑚 . In branching salivary glands, ℎ ≈ 1 5 𝜇 ⁢ 𝑚 when surface cells are very crowded and columnar, so this is an upper bound of possible surface layer thickness. The interior radius 𝑟 is bounded by ℎ ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 6 ⁢ ℎ , since bud diameters are approximately 60-200 μm. We note that the constant-thickness assumption disadvantages the system from increasing the surface area, because the surface area can be increased by reducing the surface-layer thickness without increasing the surface-layer volume. 4 The volume expansion or shrinkage of each compartment is contributed by a combination of local cell division and material (cell) transfer across the surface-interior interface. Specially, the interior cell layer at this interface is defined as the subsurface layer. 5 Without cell divisions, the material transfer at the surface-interior interface depends on the abundance of low-E-cadherin cells near the surface-interior interface. We assume low E-cadherin cells at this interface can swap between the surface (contacting the basement membrane; cell status 𝑆 , cell number 𝑁 𝑆 ) and subsurface layer (contacting other cells; cell status 𝐵 , cell number 𝑁 𝐵 ). Analogous to a chemical reaction 𝐵 ↔ 𝑆 , we assume their free energy difference 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 = 𝐸 𝑆 − 𝐸 𝐵 determines which direction is thermodynamically favored (e.g., 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 < 0 : surface is favored; 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 > 0 : subsurface is favored). Due to high cell motility, we assume swapping is fast and equilibriumcan be reached quickly. The cell number ratio at equilibrium 𝐾 = 𝑁 𝑆 ⁢ 0 𝑁 𝐵 ⁢ 0 = 𝑒 − 𝑐 ⁢ 𝛥 ⁢ 𝐸 , where 𝑐 is a constant. Under normal conditions, the surface-residence ratio of both nascent and randomly sampled surface cells is about 0.930, corresponding to 𝐾 = 1 3 . 2 8 5 and indicating a strong preference for low-E-cadherin cells to stay on surface. 6 When interior cells are ready to divide (division-ready cells), they all divide locally to produce two interior cells. Thus, the local cell division rate in the interior 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐿 is identical to the production rate of division-ready cells, which we denote as the apparent cell proliferation rate 𝑃 𝐼 ⁢ 𝐴 . 7 In contrast, no surface cells divide locally to produce two surface cells. Thus, the local cell proliferation rate in the surface layer 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 = 0 . As a result, the surface layer expansion is solely contributed by the material transfer between the interior and surface. 8 We assume division-ready cells at the surface all delaminate to divide in the interior to produce 2 interior cells. In practice, this is the case for the 92.4% of divisions that are Type I, but we note that the 7.2% Type II divisions can be viewed as a special case of Type I division in which one daughter cell has immediately returned to the surface. This simplification slightly disadvantages the expansion rate of the surface layer. 9 Each division-ready cell at the surface will cause one surface-to-interior transfer event and contributes two subsurface low-E-cadherin cells at steady state, because 100% of the daughter cells return, and most return within a short time. Denoting 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 as the apparent surface cell proliferation rate, i.e., the production rate of division-ready cells in the surface layer, we have a transient loss of 𝑁 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 low-E-cadherin cells from the surface and a gain of 2 ⁢ 𝑁 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐴 low-E-cadherin cells to the surface. 10 Another possible contribution to low-E-cadherin cells in the subsurface layer could theoretically come from putative events in which high-E-cadherin cells downregulate E-cadherin and then sort out to the subsurface layer. We think it is rare because all interior-to-surface transfer events have we observed could be traced back to be originating from the surface, whenever it was possible to trace them. For simplicity, we will ignore this term and note that this simplification will slightly disadvantage the expansion rate of the surface layer.
