Title: Cryo-EM Reveals Integrin-Mediated TGF-β Activation without Release from Latent TGF-β


Abstract: Summary

Integrin αvβ8 binds with exquisite specificity to latent transforming growth factor-β (L-TGF-β). This binding is essential for activating L-TGF-β presented by a variety of cell types. Inhibiting αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation blocks immunosuppressive regulatory T cell differentiation, which is a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer. Using cryo-electron microscopy, structure-guided mutagenesis, and cell-based assays, we reveal the binding interactions between the entire αvβ8 ectodomain and its intact natural ligand, L-TGF-β, as well as two different inhibitory antibody fragments to understand the structural underpinnings of αvβ8 binding specificity and TGF-β activation. Our studies reveal a mechanism of TGF-β activation where mature TGF-β signals within the confines of L-TGF-β and the release and diffusion of TGF-β are not required. The structural details of this mechanism provide a rational basis for therapeutic strategies to inhibit αvβ8-mediated L-TGF-β activation.

Section: Introduction

Studies in the past three decades have elucidated the diverse and essential functions of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in immunity and vascular biology ( Sanjabi et al., 2017; van Meeteren et al., 2011 52. Sanjabi, S. ∙ Oh, S.A. ∙ Li, M.O. Regulation of the Immune Response by TGF-β: From Conception to Autoimmunity and Infection Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 Crossref Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar 64. van Meeteren, L.A. ∙ Goumans, M.J. ∙ ten Dijke, P. TGF-β receptor signaling pathways in angiogenesis; emerging targets for anti-angiogenesis therapy Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 2011; 12 :2108-2120 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). While TGF-β and its receptors are ubiquitously expressed ( Gordon and Blobe, 2008 19. Gordon, K.J. ∙ Blobe, G.C. Role of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily signaling pathways in human disease Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1782 :197-228 Crossref Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ), TGF-β is always expressed in a latent form (L-TGF-β). During biosynthesis, TGF-β is cleaved by furin from its prodomain, latency associated peptide (LAP), but remains associated with it forming a latent complex, in which LAP forms a ring-like structure shielding the active domains of mature TGF-β from its receptors ( Figure S1 A) ( Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, activation is a major point of regulation of TGF-β function ( Miyazono et al., 1990 36. Miyazono, K. ∙ Yuki, K. ∙ Takaku, F. ... Latent forms of TGF-beta: structure and biology Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1990; 593 :51-58 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is widely presumed that TGF-β activation requires mature TGF-β to be released from LAP to enable receptor binding ( Annes et al., 2003; Massagué, 2012; Moses et al., 2016 5. Annes, J.P. ∙ Munger, J.S. ∙ Rifkin, D.B. Making sense of latent TGFbeta activation J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 :217-224 Crossref Scopus (1400) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Massagué, J.

The Discovery and Early Days of TGF-β: A Historical Perspective Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of therapeutics in development are conceptually tied to inhibiting freely diffusible TGF-β but have been associated with toxicities ( Akhurst, 2017 3. Akhurst, R.J. Targeting TGF-β Signaling for Therapeutic Gain Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Targeting TGF-β activation thus has the potential to increase specificity while limiting toxicities associated with such global TGF-β inhibition strategies ( Nishimura, 2009 41. Nishimura, S.L.

Pathol. 2009; 175 :1362-1370 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Integrin αvβ8 is particularly important for TGF-β activation since it is essential for T cell, myeloid, and endothelial cell differentiation during development ( Aluwihare et al., 2009; Arnold et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2018; Travis et al., 2007 4.

In post-natal life, αvβ8 plays important roles in fibroinflammatory processes ( Kudo et al., 2012; Melton et al., 2010; Minagawa et al., 2014 26. Kudo, M. ∙ Melton, A.C. ∙ Chen, C. ...

Selective targeting of TGF-β activation to treat fibroinflammatory airway disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 :241ra79 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) and anti-tumor immunity ( Takasaka et al., 2018 60. Takasaka, N. ∙ Seed, R.I. ∙ Cormier, A. ... Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T (Treg) cells, which is a major mechanism of tumor immune evasion, is determined by the activation of L-TGF-β presented by GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant) on their cell surface to αvβ8 ( Stockis et al., 2009 57. Stockis, J. ∙ Colau, D. ∙ Coulie, P.G. ... Membrane protein GARP is a receptor for latent TGF-beta on the surface of activated human Treg Eur. J. Immunol. 2009; 39 :3315-3322 Crossref Scopus (219) PubMed Google Scholar ). How αvβ8 binds to and activates L-TGF-β has not been elucidated.
A structural model of TGF-β activation by a different integrin, αvβ6, suggests that L-TGF-β binding to αvβ6 triggers a global conformational change from extended-closed to extended-open, which allows actin cytoskeletal force to be transmitted through the β subunit to release mature TGF-β from its latent complex ( Figure S1 B) ( Dong et al., 2017 13. Dong, X. ∙ Zhao, B. ∙ Iacob, R.E. ... Force interacts with macromolecular structure in activation of TGF-β Nature. 2017; 542 :55-59 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the αvβ8 integrin has a divergent cytoplasmic domain that does not interact with the actin cytoskeleton and exists only in an extended-closed conformation whether alone or in complex with L-TGF-β ( Cormier et al., 2018; Minagawa et al., 2014; Mu et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2017 9. Cormier, A. ∙ Campbell, M.G. ∙ Ito, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the αvβ8 integrin reveals a mechanism for stabilizing integrin extension Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :698-704 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar 35. Minagawa, S. ∙ Lou, J. ∙ Seed, R.I. ... Selective targeting of TGF-β activation to treat fibroinflammatory airway disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 :241ra79 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Mu, D. ∙ Cambier, S. ∙ Fjellbirkeland, L. ... The integrin alpha(v)beta8 mediates epithelial homeostasis through MT1-MMP-dependent activation of TGF-beta1 J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157 :493-507 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Wang, J. ∙ Dong, X. ∙ Zhao, B. ... Atypical interactions of integrin α V β 8 with pro-TGF-β1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E4168-E4174 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, αvβ8-mediated L-TGF-β activation can occur without drastic conformational rearrangements and without cytoskeletal force. Thus, its mechanism of activation must be different from the model proposed for αvβ6 ( Figure S1 C).
αvβ8 only binds efficiently to L-TGF-β, which is distinct from all other αv integrins, which bind to many other ligands in addition to L-TGF-β ( Humphries et al., 2006; Mu et al., 2002; Ozawa et al., 2016 24. Humphries, J.D. ∙ Byron, A. ∙ Humphries, M.J. Integrin ligands at a glance J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119 :3901-3903 Crossref Scopus (1292) PubMed Google Scholar 39. Mu, D. ∙ Cambier, S. ∙ Fjellbirkeland, L. ... The integrin alpha(v)beta8 mediates epithelial homeostasis through MT1-MMP-dependent activation of TGF-beta1 J.

Chem. 2016; 291 :11551-11565 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, determining the basis of αvβ8 specificity for L-TGF-β is of general importance for understanding integrin-mediated TGF-β activation and to guide development of therapeutic antibodies and integrin-specific small molecules, the latter of which has proved difficult ( Hatley et al., 2018 22. Hatley, R.J.D. ∙ Macdonald, S.J.F. ∙ Slack, R.J. ... An αv-RGD Integrin Inhibitor Toolbox: Drug Discovery Insight, Challenges and Opportunities Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57 :3298-3321 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined structures of three complexes between the αvβ8 ectodomain and L-TGF-β, or two inhibitory Fabs, one of which is ligand mimetic. Together with structure-guided mutagenesis, we reveal a binding intermediate and the two key regions that define the specificity of αvβ8 for L-TGF-β, suggesting an alternative strategy to inhibit αvβ8/L-TGF-β binding. The dynamic nature of αvβ8/L-TGF-β interactions suggest an alternative activation mechanism that does not require release and diffusion of mature TGF-β, which we confirmed through cell-based assays. Our findings present a model and conceptual framework to understand the cell-specific regulation of TGF-β activation.

Section: Results

To gain mechanistic insights into TGF-β activation and αvβ8 ligand specificity, we used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of a stable complex of the human αvβ8 ectodomain with porcine L-TGF-β1, which has 94% sequence identity with human L-TGF-β. This L-TGF-β has two point substitutions: C4S that increases expression and R249A that disrupts the furin cleavage to stabilize the L-TGF-β complex for structural studies. The biochemical relevance of this complex was established in previous studies ( Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). From the entire cryo-EM dataset, we isolated a subset of particles that give a structure with an overall nominal resolution of 3.3 Å; however, the local resolution varies ( Figures 1 A–1C and S2 A). In our map, most of the integrin headpiece has well-resolved side chains for reliable atomic model building. In the αv subunit, the resolution of the thigh domain near the headpiece is sufficient to separate β strands and to trace the backbone, but it becomes less well resolved toward the lower leg. In the β8 subunit, the resolution of the hybrid domain is also sufficient to trace the backbone of all β strands with the bulky side chains resolved. However, the resolution of the PSI/EGF1 domain is significantly lower, suggesting that the linkage between the PSI/EGF1 and hybrid domains is flexible. Overall, our reconstruction suggests that there is considerable motion between the headpiece and the legs, which is consistent with our previous studies of the αvβ8 ectodomain ( Cormier et al., 2018 9. Cormier, A. ∙ Campbell, M.G. ∙ Ito, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the αvβ8 integrin reveals a mechanism for stabilizing integrin extension Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :698-704 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The integrin-binding loop of L-TGF-β1 is strikingly well resolved with clear density for the side chains suggesting that this binding interface between integrin αvβ8 and L-TGF-β1 is very stable. In comparison, the rest of L-TGF-β1 is at a lower resolution (5–10 Å) suited for rigid body fitting suggesting that bound L-TGF-β1 is flexible ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Using the arm domain of L-TGF-β as a mainstay, the crystal structure of L-TGF-β1 (PDB: 3RJR [ Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ]) is well accommodated by our map ( Figure 1 B).
The L-TGF-β (Arg-Gly-Asp) RGD loop is composed of two main components: the proximal RGD loop, which shows significant variance in length and sequence between TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, and the RGDLXXI/L integrin-binding motif, which is composed of the tripeptide RGD recognition motif followed by a consensus accessory binding site ( 218- LATI -221 in L-TGF-β1 and 244- LGRL -247 in L-TGF-β3) ( Mu et al., 2002; Ozawa et al., 2016 39. Mu, D. ∙ Cambier, S. ∙ Fjellbirkeland, L. ... The integrin alpha(v)beta8 mediates epithelial homeostasis through MT1-MMP-dependent activation of TGF-beta1 J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157 :493-507 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Ozawa, A. ∙ Sato, Y. ∙ Imabayashi, T. ... Molecular Basis of the Ligand Binding Specificity of αvβ8 Integrin J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :11551-11565 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). From here on, we refer to the RGDLXXI/L consensus motif as the integrin-binding motif. A crystal structure of L-TGF-β alone shows proximal loop is disordered, and the LXXI/L motif forms a loop ( Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). When crystallized in complex with αvβ6, the LXXI/L motif organized into a short one and half turn α helix ( Dong et al., 2014, 2017 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Dong, X. ∙ Zhao, B. ∙ Iacob, R.E. ... Force interacts with macromolecular structure in activation of TGF-β Nature. 2017; 542 :55-59 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), which we will refer to as the integrin-binding helix.
In our map, the density of the entire integrin-binding loop is well resolved. The RGD sequence is located in the ligand-binding cleft immediately followed by the integrin binding helix ( Figure 1 D). Overall, the integrin-binding motif and helix and the αvβ8 ligand-binding cleft are similar to the crystal structures of the αvβ6 headpiece in complex with L-TGF-β1 or with a L-TGF-β3 RGD peptide ( Figure S3 ) ( Dong et al., 2014, 2017 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Dong, X. ∙ Zhao, B. ∙ Iacob, R.E. ... Force interacts with macromolecular structure in activation of TGF-β Nature. 2017; 542 :55-59 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The specificity-determining loop 2 (SDL2) is a loop between the α1 and α2 helices of β8 and is located at the back of the ligand binding cleft. A disulfide bond is formed between two conserved residues (C169 and C176) forming the SDL2 C-C loop. The SDL2 C-C loop bends inward toward the integrin binding helix of L-TGF-β1 and positions its Y172 to form a hydrophobic patch with multiple residues of SDL1–3 ( Figures 1 E and S3 E). The Arg RGD interacts with the side chain of αv D218. The Asp RGD , together with S114 and S116 of the SDL1 α1 helix, coordinate the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) cation consistent with other αv integrins in complex with RGD ( Figures S3 J–S3M) ( Takagi, 2007 59. Takagi, J. Structural basis for ligand recognition by integrins Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19 :557-564 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In our previous ligand-free structure of αvβ8, we found that SDL2 was flexible and therefore could not be modeled ( Cormier et al., 2018 9. Cormier, A. ∙ Campbell, M.G. ∙ Ito, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the αvβ8 integrin reveals a mechanism for stabilizing integrin extension Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :698-704 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). To define the structure of αvβ8 in the ligand-free state, we used the Fab domain of C6D4 to capture SDL2 in a specific conformation. C6D4 is a potent neutralizing antibody that we previously developed to bind to the αvβ8 headpiece with high affinity and to effectively inhibit binding of L-TGF-β ( Takasaka et al., 2018 60. Takasaka, N. ∙ Seed, R.I. ∙ Cormier, A. ... Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further facilitate high-resolution structure determination, we added an additional Fab, 11D12V2, that binds the αv thigh. Since 11D12V2 is used solely for facilitating alignment and does not impact L-TGF-β binding nor headpiece conformation, for simplicity, we refer to this complex as αvβ8/C6D4. We determined a cryo-EM structure of αvβ8/C6D4 in an extended conformation at an overall nominal resolution of 3.9 Å. With further focused alignment on the region of interest, which includes the headpiece and the variable domain of C6D4 Fab, the resolution was improved to 3.5 Å ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S3 C). The variable domains of C6D4 contact all SDL loops and D218 of the αv head, thus directly competing with L-TGF-β ( Figures 2 B, 3 , and S3 C; Tables S1 , S3 , and S4 ).
Although C6D4 interacts with the ligand-binding pocket, it does not participate in coordination of the MIDAS cation ( Figure 2 B). Comparison between the αvβ8/L-TGF-β1 and αvβ8/C6D4 structures shows that upon ligand binding the S116 at the tip of the SDL1 α1-helical position shifts slightly toward the ligand-binding pocket (∼1 Å) but the majority of the SDL1 α1 helix itself remains at a similar position ( Figures 2 C, S3 G, S3R, and S3S). This result is surprising because other integrin structures show both larger shifts and straightening of the SDL1 α1 helix upon ligand binding ( Figures S3 N–S3S) ( Dong et al., 2014, 2017; Zhu et al., 2013 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar 13. Dong, X. ∙ Zhao, B. ∙ Iacob, R.E. ... Force interacts with macromolecular structure in activation of TGF-β Nature. 2017; 542 :55-59 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Complete integrin headpiece opening in eight steps J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :1053-1068 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The differences in SDL2 positioning are the largest overall conformational differences between the αvβ8/L-TGF-β and αvβ8/C6D4 complexes. C6D4 captures the SDL2 C-C loop in an outward position through interactions with complementary determining regions (CDRs) CDR L1 , L3 and CDR H1 , H3 ( Figures 2 D and 3 ; Table S1 ). Notably, the inhibitory Fab Act-1 captures the β7 integrin SDL2 C-C loop in the same position, indicating that SDL2 can assume similar ligand free conformations in other integrins ( Figures S3 T and S3U) ( Yu et al., 2012 73. Yu, Y. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Mi, L.Z. ... Structural specializations of α(4)β(7), an integrin that mediates rolling adhesion J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196 :131-146 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, our structure demonstrates that C6D4 captures αvβ8 in a conformation corresponding to an unliganded state and completely occludes the ligand binding cleft. Thus, it provides a clear mechanism of inhibition and explains the potency of C6D4 in vitro and in vivo ( Takasaka et al., 2018 60. Takasaka, N. ∙ Seed, R.I. ∙ Cormier, A. ... Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We hypothesized that the inward position of the SDL2 C-C loop in the αvβ8/L-TGF-β structure is a critical feature that facilitates formation of the integrin-binding helix, which is necessary for positioning of the RGD sequence into the αvβ8 ligand binding pocket. To address this hypothesis, we took advantage of the binding footprint of C6D4, which covers SDL1, 2 and 3 in addition to having its CDR L1 extended into the ligand-binding cleft. It is therefore possible to exchange the CDR L1 with the RGD loop of L-TGF-β while still maintaining binding of the Fab to αvβ8. This would allow visualization of the RGD loop in the ligand binding cleft with SDL2 in an inactive conformation. We designed a chimeric Fab with the CDR L1 loop replaced by the RGD loop of L-TGF-β3. This antibody (C6-RGD3) binds to and blocks function of αvβ8 ( Figures S3 V and S3W). We determined the structure of αvβ8 in complex with C6-RGD3 and 11D12V2 Fabs to a resolution of 3.9 Å ( Figures 2 E, S2 C, and S3 D). The angle and position at which the C6-RGD3 binds integrin is very similar to C6D4 with the major differences in the engineered CDR L1 loop ( Figures 2 E–2G and 3 ; Tables S2 , S3 , and S4 ). The conformation of this loop is distinct from the canonical position of the RGD in the αvβ8/L-TGF-β1 structure with Arg RGD in a pocket formed by SDL2/3, which we will refer to as the proximal SDL2/3 pocket, where it interacts with D 148 of the αv head ( Figures 2 F, S3 D, and S3F). This residue is conserved in α8, the only other integrin α subunit that binds to L-TGF-β, suggesting it may play a key role in L-TGF-β binding ( Table S3 ). In the αvβ8/C6-RGD3 structure, the integrin-binding helix does not form and SDL2 remains in an outward position as in the αvβ8/C6D4 complex ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S3 D). In contrast, the position of the SDL1 α1 helix is similar to its position in αvβ8/L-TGF-β and the Asp RGD coordinates with the MIDAS cation ( Figures 2 F, 4 , S3 H, S3R, and S3S). These features suggest that this is an intermediate state of L-TGF-β binding and its biological relevance is tested below.
C6-RGD3 binds efficiently to αvβ8 and αvβ6, but not αvβ1, αvβ3, or αvβ5, mirroring the binding preference of these integrins to L-TGF-β ( Figure S3 W). Since C6D4 does not bind to αvβ6, we assume that C6-RGD3 binding to αvβ6 is entirely through canonical positioning of the integrin-binding loop of CDR L1 . We reasoned that the C6-RGD3 CDR L1 loop could also reach a canonical conformation with αvβ8 without a contribution from rest of the Fab binding footprint. Indeed, upon intensive classification, we identified a minor population (∼6% of particles) that showed the C6-RGD3 integrin-binding motif in a canonical binding position with helix formation ( Figure S4 ). These results suggest that the C6-RGD3 Fab is able to bind to αvβ8 in two distinct modes, one reflecting an alternative L-TGF-β RGD position with no integrin-binding helix formation and no contact with the β8 SDL2, and the other, a canonical positioning of L-TGF-β RGD with the integrin-binding helix.
When αvβ8 is bound with L-TGF-β the position of the SDL1 α-helical tip is similar to the ligand-bound state of other integrins. In other integrins, the inward motion of the SDL1 α1 helix is accompanied by swinging out of the hybrid domain, a process that is inhibited by Ca 2+ and stimulated by Mn 2+ ( Zhu et al., 2013 77. Zhu, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Springer, T.A. Complete integrin headpiece opening in eight steps J. Cell Biol. 2013; 201 :1053-1068 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously found that αvβ8 binding to L-TGF-β is not significantly enhanced by Mn 2+ over Ca 2+ and that hybrid domain swing out is not seen in Mn 2+ containing buffers, suggesting that metal-binding properties are different for αvβ8 than other integrins studied so far ( Minagawa et al., 2014 35. Minagawa, S. ∙ Lou, J. ∙ Seed, R.I. ... Selective targeting of TGF-β activation to treat fibroinflammatory airway disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 :241ra79 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Existing crystal structures of integrin ligand binding pockets show that three adjacent conserved cation-binding sites Synergistic Metal ion Binding Site (SyMBS), MIDAS, and ADjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) are coordinated by residues in SDL1 and SDL3 ( Takagi, 2007; Xiong et al., 2001 59. Takagi, J. Structural basis for ligand recognition by integrins Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19 :557-564 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Xiong, J.P. ∙ Stehle, T. ∙ Diefenbach, B. ... Crystal structure of the extracellular segment of integrin alpha Vbeta3 Science. 2001; 294 :339-345 Crossref Scopus (1160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such cation coordination is widely thought to be a key determinant of integrin binding affinity and conformational dynamics ( Takagi, 2007 59. Takagi, J. Structural basis for ligand recognition by integrins Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19 :557-564 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although coordinating residues are conserved across all β subunits in the MIDAS and SyMBS sites, in the β8 ADMIDAS site, two Asn residues replace otherwise conserved adjacent Asp residues. We find no density for the ADMIDAS cation in any of our structures, while densities corresponding to the SyMBS and MIDAS cations are clearly observed ( Figures 4 A–4H). The absence of an ADMIDAS in αvβ8 provides a structural explanation for the lack of cation preference and movement of SDL1 α1 helix upon L-TGF-β binding, which are expected features in other integrins where conformational coupling between the hybrid domain and ligand binding were observed.
To gain further insight into conformational flexibility of L-TGF-β1 bound to αvβ8, we analyzed the complete αvβ8/L-TGF-β1 dataset through comprehensive classification ( Figure S5 ). We define seven subclasses that represent conformational snapshots of the movements adopted between L-TGF-β1 and the integrin headpiece. Each structure exhibits high resolution in the integrin headpiece and binding interface (3.3–3.6 Å) and a well-defined shape for L-TGF-β1 prodomain. This conformational lineup shows different degrees of rotation between L-TGF-β1 and the αvβ8 headpiece ( Figure 5 ). In all seven classes, the key structural elements that mediate major interactions between αvβ8 and L-TGF-β are similar to those shown in Figure 1 . The proximal RGD loop of L-TGF-β is not as well resolved in most of these structures, and the distal linker that follows the integrin binding helix is resolved but varies considerably from subclass to subclass. This suggests that the proximal RGD loop and the distal sequence act as flexible linkers, which allow the rest of L-TGF-β to tilt around the αvβ8 headpiece in a wide range. This allows the arm domain of L-TGF-β to make contacts with the β8 headpiece in some of the subclasses. The overall density of the prodomain and TGF-β itself varies noticeably indicating a range of plasticity throughout L-TGF-β ( Figure 5 ).
The position of the SDL1 α1 helix is the same, and no movement of the β8 hybrid domain is observed in any subclass. The lower leg domains in these subclasses are similarly and consistently at a lower resolution than the rest of the complex. This is in line with what we observed previously and suggests that movement in the lower legs is not correlated with the motion of bound L-TGF-β ( Cormier et al., 2018 9. Cormier, A. ∙ Campbell, M.G. ∙ Ito, S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the αvβ8 integrin reveals a mechanism for stabilizing integrin extension Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25 :698-704 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such flexibilities in both αvβ8 and L-TGF-β are unlikely to generate any force to liberate the TGF-β from the latent complex. Therefore, our structural data reveal a model where TGF-β can be activated without being released from the latent complex. In such a model, the structural flexibility of L-TGF-β upon binding to αvβ8 would be sufficient to expose the active domain of TGF-β to its receptors.
Differences in the proximal SDL2/3 binding pocket and the SDL2 C-C loop define three distinct conformational states captured in our structures. We hypothesized that a series of sequential restructuring steps of the L-TGF-β integrin-binding motif and αvβ8 headpiece lead to stable ligand binding ( Figure 6 A). To test this model, we carried out a series of mutations. To ensure that all mutants were properly folded, we confirmed that C6D4, which recognizes a non-linear epitope on the αvβ8 headpiece ( Takasaka et al., 2018 60. Takasaka, N. ∙ Seed, R.I. ∙ Cormier, A. ... Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), binds to these mutants as expected ( Figure S6 A).
To rule out the possibility that the alternative binding mode is an artifact of grafting the RGD L-TGF-β loop onto the C6D4 Fab, we mutated the SDL3 reside I208 to its corresponding Arg residue in β3 (I208R). Based on our structure and hypothesis, this substitution would occlude the proximal SDL2/3 binding pocket and prevent the alternative binding mode, while not affecting the placement of RGD in the canonical binding position ( Figures S6 E–S6G). The I208R mutant completely inhibited L-TGF-β binding and activation suggesting that the alternative RGD binding mode is a required initial or intermediate step in the L-TGF-β binding and activation process ( Figure 6 B). Mutational validation of the importance of the proximal SDL2/3 pocket, including I208 in ligand binding, reinforces the potential of this domain as a therapeutic target.
The differences in position of the SDL2 C-C loop in the αvβ8/C6D4 and αvβ8/RGD3 compared to the αvβ8/L-TGF-β structures suggest a critical role for Y172 in the formation of the L-TGF-β integrin-binding helix ( Figure 6 C). The conservation of the hydrophobic patch in β6 suggests a similar role for β6 I183 ( Figure 6 C). The positioning of the aromatic ring of Y172 in our structure, along with the knowledge that in αvβ6 the corresponding residue is an Ile (I183) suggest that the hydrophobic interaction is imperative for L-TGF-β integrin-binding helix formation ( Figure 3 ). In order to test the importance of this residue, we made the following substitution mutants: one conservative, Y172M, and one non-conservative, Y172N. As expected, the conservative substitution, Y172M, did not affect L-TGF-β activation. Replacing Y172 with the polar Asn significantly reduced L-TGF-β activation to a level similar to when the entire SDL2 region is removed ( Figure 6 B) ( Dong et al., 2014 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). A secreted version of αvβ8 expressing Y172A dramatically reduced L-TGF-β binding ( Figure S6 C).
The highly flexible SDL2 is poorly conserved between integrin β subunits and provides the main β8 residues of the hydrophobic patch interacting with the L-TGF-β helix. Despite large sequence variation in SDL2 between the β6 and β8 subunits, the footprint of hydrophobic interactions that promotes stabilization of the L-TGF-β helix appears to be absolutely conserved ( Figure 6 C) ( Dong et al., 2014 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a test of the generalizability of our model to the αvβ6 integrin, we made the non-conservative mutation of β6 I183N, which corresponds to β8 Y172N ( Figure 3 ). As expected, I183N dramatically inhibits αvβ6-mediated L-TGF-β activation and binding ( Figures 6 B and S6 D). This suggests that the β6 and β8 SDL2 have similar roles.
Our data reveal two main features that are required for efficient L-TGF-β binding: a conserved hydrophobic residue in the β8 SDL3 I208 position of the proximal SDL2/3 pocket and a bulky hydrophobic residue at the tip of the SDL2 C-C loop. The β3 and β5 integrins contain a charged residue in the β8 SDL3 I208 position, while integrin β1, β2, β4, and β7 subunits do not have a bulky hydrophobic residue in the position of β8 SDL2 Y172 ( Figure 3 ). Thus, the absence of one or the other features explains the relatively inefficient L-TGF-β binding to these integrins ( Dong et al., 2014 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Previous studies showed that peptides derived from the TGF-β3 compared to the TGF-β1 RGDLXXI/L sequence have increased ability to inhibit L-TGF-β binding to αvβ6 ( Dong et al., 2014 12. Dong, X. ∙ Hudson, N.E. ∙ Lu, C. ... Structural determinants of integrin β-subunit specificity for latent TGF-β Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :1091-1096 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the formation of integrin binding helix is a critical step in L-TGF-β binding to integrin, the ability of the LXXI/L motif to form a helix may underlie this difference. Therefore, we synthesized a series of peptide mutants that were designed to differ in their predicted abilities to form a helix. As expected, the ability to form a helix correlated with the IC 50 of each peptide, and the peptides with proline substitutions in the terminal hydrophobic position of LXXI/L that were designed to disrupt the helix had the highest IC 50 . Similarly, the TGF-β3 peptide has a lower IC 50 than the TGF-β1 peptide because TGF-β3 peptide has a higher propensity to form a helix ( Figure 6 D). Overall, our findings suggest that conformational dynamics within the L-TGF-β integrin-binding helix are critical for binding ability to αvβ8.
In the latent form, the active domain of TGF-β is shielded by a flexible loop of the prodomain known as the latency lasso. Without extensive conformational changes and cytoskeletal linkage, force cannot be transmitted through the β8 subunit to release TGF-β from its latent complex. However, the flexible nature of L-TGF-β we observed in our structure may expose the active domain of mature TGF-β without releasing it.
A recent crystal structure of the L-TGF-β/GARP complex reveals how GARP functions as a stable platform for L-TGF-β presentation, which suggests that a complex of αvβ8 with L-TGF-β/GARP forms between two opposing cells with one presenting αvβ8 and the other presenting L-TGF-β ( Liénart et al., 2018 28. Liénart, S. ∙ Merceron, R. ∙ Vanderaa, C. ... Structural basis of latent TGF-β1 presentation and activation by GARP on human regulatory T cells Science. 2018; 362 :952-956 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, it is already known that L-TGF-β/GARP-presenting immune cells also present its receptor, TGF-βR2 ( Li et al., 2006 27. Li, M.O. ∙ Sanjabi, S. ∙ Flavell, R.A. Transforming growth factor-beta controls development, homeostasis, and tolerance of T cells by regulatory T cell-dependent and -independent mechanisms Immunity. 2006; 25 :455-471 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus envision a new TGF-β activation model in which L-TGF-β binding to αvβ8 exposes the active domain of mature TGF-β so that it can bind to TGF-βR2 and recruit a type I TGF-βR (i.e., ALK5) to form the minimal TGF-β signaling module to initiate the TGF-β signaling cascade ( Huang et al., 2011 23. Huang, T. ∙ David, L. ∙ Mendoza, V. ... TGF-β signalling is mediated by two autonomously functioning TβRI:TβRII pairs EMBO J. 2011; 30 :1263-1276 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated a structural model using our cryo-EM structure of αvβ8/L-TGF-β with crystal structures of L-TGF-β/GARP ( Liénart et al., 2018 28. Liénart, S. ∙ Merceron, R. ∙ Vanderaa, C. ... Structural basis of latent TGF-β1 presentation and activation by GARP on human regulatory T cells Science. 2018; 362 :952-956 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TGF-β in complex with TGF-βR2 ( Groppe et al., 2008; Hart et al., 2002; Radaev et al., 2010 20. Groppe, J. ∙ Hinck, C.S. ∙ Samavarchi-Tehrani, P. ...

Chem. 2010; 285 :14806-14814 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 A). In this multicomponent model, TGF-β signaling can occur within the confines of L-TGF-β, and release and diffusion of TGF-β are not required.
To test this hypothesis, we sought to express a form of TGF-β that could not be released from L-TGF-β in a model system that reproduces a physiologic milieu where αvβ8 normally activates TGF-β. Stimulated T cells present L-TGF-β on their cell surfaces via covalent linkage to transmembrane adaptor proteins such as GARP and demonstrate TGF-β-dependent differentiation into Treg cells ( Edwards et al., 2014 14. Edwards, J.P. ∙ Thornton, A.M. ∙ Shevach, E.M. Release of active TGF-beta1 from the latent TGF-beta1/GARP complex on T regulatory cells is mediated by integrin beta8 J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :2843-2849 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings indicate that cell-surface L-TGF-β can be activated to interact with its own TGF-β receptors in a T cell-intrinsic mechanism of TGF-β activation and signaling. The integrin αvβ8 provided from either contacting cells or Treg cells themselves has been implicated in stimulating such cell-intrinsic T cell differentiation ( Takasaka et al., 2018; Edwards et al., 2014; Stockis et al., 2017 14. Edwards, J.P. ∙ Thornton, A.M. ∙ Shevach, E.M. Release of active TGF-beta1 from the latent TGF-beta1/GARP complex on T regulatory cells is mediated by integrin beta8 J.

Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). No reporter system currently exists to investigate the mechanistic basis of cell-intrinsic TGF-β activation, whereby the L-TGF-β-presenting cell is also the cell that responds to TGF-β signaling. The most widely used in vitro TGF-β activation system relies on co-culturing a highly sensitive and specific TGF-β reporter cell line (TMLC) with integrin-expressing and/or L-TGF-β/GARP-presenting cells ( Wang et al., 2012 68. Wang, R. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Dong, X. ... GARP regulates the bioavailability and activation of TGFbeta Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 :1129-1139 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). In such systems, TMLC must be in contact with these other cell types for detection of TGF-β activation ( Munger et al., 1999 40. Munger, J.S. ∙ Huang, X. ∙ Kawakatsu, H. ... The integrin alpha v beta 6 binds and activates latent TGF beta 1: a mechanism for regulating pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Cell. 1999; 96 :319-328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1761) PubMed Google Scholar ). TMLC cells are a stable subclone of mink lung epithelial cells (MLECs) stably transfected with an expression construct containing a TGF-β-specific promoter fragment, consisting of a truncated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter, fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene ( Abe et al., 1994 1. Abe, M. ∙ Harpel, J.G. ∙ Metz, C.N. ... An assay for transforming growth factor-beta using cells transfected with a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter-luciferase construct Anal Biochem. 1994; 216 :276-284 Crossref Scopus (692) PubMed Google Scholar ). TMLC cells are widely used to measure active TGF-β because of their low background, specificity for TGF-β, and abundant expression of TGF-β receptors and downstream signaling molecules that allow measurement of dose-dependent increases in TGF-β concentration in the physiologic range ( Abe et al., 1994 1. Abe, M. ∙ Harpel, J.G. ∙ Metz, C.N. ... An assay for transforming growth factor-beta using cells transfected with a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter-luciferase construct Anal Biochem. 1994; 216 :276-284 Crossref Scopus (692) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, TMLC cells cannot report cell-intrinsic TGF-β activation since they do not present L-TGF-β themselves.
To build a cell-intrinsic TGF-β activation system, TMLC cells were stably transfected with wild-type (WT) TGF-β. Without co-transfecting GARP, TMLCs do not present L-TGF-β on their cell surface. When co-transfected with TGF-β and GARP, high levels of cell-surface expression of L-TGF-β can be detected ( Figures S7 A and S7C). To build a cell-intrinsic TGF-β activation system, which express a non-releasable form of TGF-β, we similarly expressed the L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP complex on the surface of TMLCs in which the L-TGF-β carries the same mutation (R249A) as described above that prevents cleavage of TGF-β from its prodomain during biosynthesis ( Figures S7 B and S7D). We verified that the transfected L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP reporter cells expressed the cell-surface complex at equivalent levels as the WT L-TGF-β/GARP reporter cells ( Figures S7 C and S7D) and confirmed the absence of cleaved mature TGF-β from LAP in the R249A mutant ( Figure S7 G). The resulting cell lines were used to determine cell-intrinsic TGF-β activation and signaling and as well as the role for release of mature TGF-β.
TMLC non-transfected or transfected with WT L-TGF-β, L-TGF-β (R249A), WT L-TGF-β/GARP, or L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP were plated on the immobilized αvβ8 ectodomain or control substrates (αvβ3 as a low-affinity TGF-β binding integrin, an antibody to LAP as a high-affinity L-TGF-β binder, or BSA) ( Figure S7 E). In this configuration, actin cytoskeletal force cannot be generated or applied from the integrin to cause release of TGF-β. Robust TGF-β activation was observed at similar levels using cells expressing L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP or WT L-TGF-β/GARP when plated on αvβ8, while no activation was seen when these same cells were plated on control substrates ( Figure 7 B). Activation in this system was significantly enhanced by cell-surface presentation of L-TGF-β by GARP since minimal TGF-β activation was seen when TMLCs transfected with WT L-TGF-β or L-TGF-β (R249A) without GARP were plated on αvβ8 ( Figure S7 F). The ability of GARP to present L-TGF-β and to increase efficiency of integrin-mediated TGF-β activation is consistent with previous findings ( Wang et al., 2012 68. Wang, R. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Dong, X. ... GARP regulates the bioavailability and activation of TGFbeta Mol. Biol. Cell. 2012; 23 :1129-1139 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). No active TGF-β was detected in the supernatant from reporter cells expressing either WT or L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP when plated on αvβ8 ( Figure 7 B). These results demonstrate that αvβ8-dependent TGF-β activation can occur independently of actin-cytoskeletal force and does not require release of mature TGF-β ( Figure 7 C).

Section: Discussion

Our studies reveal an intermediate step of L-TGF-β binding to αvβ8 and the flexible nature of L-TGF-β in complex with αvβ8. Together with mutagenesis and cell-based assays, we reveal an unanticipated mechanism for TGF-β activation, where mature TGF-β signals within the confines of L-TGF-β. Thus, αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation does not require actin-cytoskeletal force nor release and diffusion of mature TGF-β. This model differs from all other activation models that require release and diffusion of mature TGF-β ( Annes et al., 2003; Massagué, 2012; Moses et al., 2016 5. Annes, J.P. ∙ Munger, J.S. ∙ Rifkin, D.B. Making sense of latent TGFbeta activation J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116 :217-224 Crossref Scopus (1400) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Massagué, J. TGFβ signalling in context Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :616-630 Crossref Scopus (2468) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Moses, H.L. ∙ Roberts, A.B. ∙ Derynck, R. The Discovery and Early Days of TGF-β: A Historical Perspective Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation directs TGF-β signaling to the opposing L-TGF-β/GARP-expressing cell through formation of a large multicomponent cell-cell protein complex.
Protein inhibitors in clinical development that globally inhibit mature TGF-β or TGF-β receptors have been associated with toxicities ( Akhurst, 2017; Tolcher et al., 2017 3. Akhurst, R.J. Targeting TGF-β Signaling for Therapeutic Gain Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Tolcher, A.W. ∙ Berlin, J.D. ∙ Cosaert, J. ...

Pharmacol. 2017; 79 :673-680 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, our model predicts that such global TGF-β inhibition strategies would be ineffective in blocking αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation due to the inaccessibility of their targeted epitopes within the geometrically constrained cell-cell αvβ8/L-TGF-β/GARP complex. In contrast, targeting αvβ8 prevents the complex from forming, which would increase specificity and efficacy while mitigating the risks of global TGF-β inhibition.
This TGF-β activation mechanism provides the structural basis to explain why conditional deletion of αvβ8 on one cell type primarily affects another ( Arnold et al., 2019; Kitamura et al., 2011; Mohammed et al., 2016; Travis et al., 2007 8.

Loss of integrin alpha(v)beta8 on dendritic cells causes autoimmunity and colitis in mice Nature. 2007; 449 :361-365 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). This mechanism also explains why deletion of GARP, or its homolog, on immune cells negatively affects their TGF-β-dependent differentiation state ( Qin et al., 2018; Salem et al., 2019; Wallace et al., 2018 47.

Wallace, C.H. ∙ Wu, B.X. ∙ Salem, M. ... B lymphocytes confer immune tolerance via cell surface GARP-TGF-β complex JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar ). In tumors, we have found that αvβ8-expressing tumors cells direct the immunosuppressive differentiation of L-TGF-β/GARP-expressing Treg and myeloid cells ( Takasaka et al., 2018 60. Takasaka, N. ∙ Seed, R.I. ∙ Cormier, A. ... Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Inhibiting αvβ8 in tumors can specifically target local immunosuppressive mechanisms of tumor immune evasion by blocking αvβ8-mediated contact of tumor cells with immune cells ( Takasaka et al., 2018 60. Takasaka, N. ∙ Seed, R.I. ∙ Cormier, A. ... Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). We have defined the mechanisms of action of two antibody prototypes that efficiently block binding of αvβ8 to L-TGF-β. One of these is ligand mimetic and defines an alternative RGD binding mode that not only reveals the initial phase of ligand recognition for L-TGF-β but also reveals the proximal SDL2/3 pocket as a possible therapeutic target for αvβ8. Based on the variation of this pocket between other αv integrins, it is possible that small molecules designed to bind within this pocket could increase specificity, which has been difficult with small molecules that directly target the conserved RGD binding site ( Hatley et al., 2018 22. Hatley, R.J.D. ∙ Macdonald, S.J.F. ∙ Slack, R.J. ... An αv-RGD Integrin Inhibitor Toolbox: Drug Discovery Insight, Challenges and Opportunities Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2018; 57 :3298-3321 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the initial phase of ligand binding, it is clear from our structures that SDL2 plays a prominent role in stable binding of αvβ8 to L-TGF-β, a mechanism that we have experimentally extended to the αvβ6 integrin. We anticipate that the dynamic interactions occurring during binding between αvβ8 and L-TGF-β could provide a roadmap for understanding how flexible ligands conform to the SDL loops deep within the ligand binding clefts of other integrins as well.
In summary, our data provide unprecedented structural insights into the TGF-β activation process that expand the basic concepts of TGF-β activation for improved biologic understanding of TGF-β function in the immune and vascular systems and lay the foundation for structural investigations of other intact integrin ectodomains with their ligands to improve strategies to target those functions for therapeutic benefit.

Adult airways were collected from first through fourth order bronchi from lobectomy specimens from resections performed for primary lung cancer. Informed consent was obtained from all surgical participants as part of an approved ongoing research protocol by the University of California San Francisco Committee on Human Research, in full accordance with the declaration of Helsinki principles. The specimens were de-indentified.
Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) were isolated from human lung specimens, as previously described ( Araya et al., 2007 6. Araya, J. ∙ Cambier, S. ∙ Markovics, J.A. ... Squamous metaplasia amplifies pathologic epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in COPD patients J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117 :3551-3562 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, airway epithelium was stripped freshly from bronchi from surgical specimens and after washing in PBS with dithiothreitol (5 mM) were digested overnight at 4°C with a protease XIV solution (0.4 mg/ml, Sigma). After washing with bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM, Lonza) with 2.5% FCS and tituration, HBEC were plated onto rat-tail Col I-coated (10 μg/ml, Corning, cat. no. 354236) dishes and incubated overnight; then the medium was changed to fresh BEGM. HBEC were passaged under conditional reprogramming conditions with BEGM with ROCK inhibitor (10 μM) and irradiated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, as described ( Liu et al., 2012 29. Liu, X. ∙ Ory, V. ∙ Chapman, S. ... ROCK inhibitor and feeder cells induce the conditional reprogramming of epithelial cells Am. J. Pathol. 2012; 180 :599-607 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (597) PubMed Google Scholar ).
HEK293 are an authenticated female line from a commercial vendor (ATCC). HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS + penicillin-streptomycin + amphotericin B + 0.11mg/mL Sodium Pyruvate + 2mM L-glutamine + MEM nonessential amino acids, cultured at 37°C with 5%CO 2 . HEK293 and all other cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. For all established cell lines cell culture media and antibiotics were prepared by the University of California, San Francisco Cell Culture Facility using deionized water and analytical grade reagents. Fetal calf serum was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
CHO-K1 are an authenticated female line from a commercial vendor (ATCC). CHOLec 3.2.8.1 have four independent mutations in the N- and O-glycosylation pathways producing proteins all of the high mannose glycosylation pattern ( Stanley, 1989 56. Stanley, P. Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants with multiple glycosylation defects for production of glycoproteins with minimal carbohydrate heterogeneity Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9 :377-383 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). CHOLec 3.2.8.1 cells were grown in CHO-S-SFM II medium + 10% FBS + penicillin-streptomycin + amphotericin B, cultured at 37°C with 5%CO 2 . CHOLec 3.2.8.1 cells were provided by Pamela Stanley ( Stanley, 1989 56. Stanley, P. Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants with multiple glycosylation defects for production of glycoproteins with minimal carbohydrate heterogeneity Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9 :377-383 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Authentication of CHOLec 3.2.8.1 cells was performed by changes in glycosylation patterns as estimated by migration of secreted proteins by SDS-PAGE.
TMLC is a stable mink lung epithelial reporter cell line derived from mixed sex American Mink fetal lung epithelial cells that stably expresses a portion of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promoter (Abe et al., 1994). TMLC cells were grown in DMEM + 10% FBS + penicillin-streptomycin + amphotericin B, cultured at 37°C with 5%CO 2 . TMLC are a gift from John Munger (NYU medical center, New York City, New York). Authentication was performed by increased luciferase activity in response to recombinant TGF-β.
The C6D4, 68, 8B8, 3G9, 1D11 antibodies have been previously described ( Minagawa et al., 2014; Mu et al., 2002; Takasaka et al., 2018; Weinreb et al., 2004 35.

Chem. 2004; 279 :17875-17887 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mouse anti-human αv, clone 11D12V2 was isolated as described, with the following modifications. Screening of hybridomas produced a polyclonal hybridoma 11D12 with reactivity against cell lines expressing the human αv-subunit (CHO-αvβ8, or SW480-β6). Subcloning produced two clones 11D12V1 and 11D12V2 both with reactivity against the αv-subunit. Variable (V) genes were isolated, sequenced, and the V H /V K genes cloned into mouse IgG 2a expression vectors and stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells. C6-RGD3 was created by splice overlap extension (SOE) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) into the VL CDRL1 region of a C6D4 IgG2a expression vector ( Minagawa et al., 2014 35. Minagawa, S. ∙ Lou, J. ∙ Seed, R.I. ... Selective targeting of TGF-β activation to treat fibroinflammatory airway disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 :241ra79 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following oligonucleotide primers using the C6D4 IgG2a expression construct as a template: 5′-GATCTGGGGCGCCTCAAGAAGAACGCCTTGGCTTGGTACCAGCAG-3′; 5′-CTTGAGGCGCCCCAGATCTCCACGGCCGAGCAGACTCTGACTGGATTTG-3′. C6-RGD3 was transfected into CHO-K1 cells. Antibodies were produced and purified as described previously ( Minagawa et al., 2014 35. Minagawa, S. ∙ Lou, J. ∙ Seed, R.I. ... Selective targeting of TGF-β activation to treat fibroinflammatory airway disease Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 :241ra79 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, stable transfected CHO-K1 cells were grown in spinner cultures in CHO SFMII media with antibiotics. Antibodies were purified from culture media using protein G Sepharose columns (HiTrap, GE Healthcare). C6D4, C6-RGD3, and 11D12V2 fragments were generated by papain digestion (Pierce) of the IgG followed by Protein-A Agarose (Millipore) incubation and to remove Fc fragments and intact antibodies and final separation using Mono S ion-exchange chromatography (GE Healthcare).
The 11D12V1 and 11D12V2 binding epitopes were estimated by negative staining electron microscopy (ns-EM), essentially as described below and in previous studies ( Minagawa et al., 2014; Takasaka et al., 2018 35.

Clone 11D12V1 bound to the αv-head and 11D12V2 to the αv-thigh. Anti-β6 (MAB4155) was purchased (R&D Systems).
To develop a cell intrinsic TGF-β activation system we used stable transfection of TMLC (Amaxa) with a vector containing either a WT human TGF-β1 IRES GFP, or a human TGF-β1 (R249A) IRES GFP cassette with puromycin resistance to obtain TMLC cells expressing WT L-TGF-β either capable of dissociating into LAP and mature TGF-β or not, due to the R249A mutation that normally allows furin cleavage of LAP from mature TGF-β ( Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human TGF-β1 IRES GFP or human TGF-β1 (R249A) IRES GFP TMLC cells were sorted for equal expression using GFP fluorescence and did not present any L-TGF-β on their cell surface ( Figure S7 ). In contrast, stable transfection of these lines with a HA-GARP construct with a blastacidin resistance cassette followed by selection and sorting resulted in high surface expression of TGF-β1/GARP or TGF-β1 (R249A)/GARP, as measured by anti-HA (clone 5E11D8, GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) or anti LAP (R&D Systems, AF426). To confirm lack of releasable of TGF-β from the L-TGF-β R249A/GARP cell surface complex, L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP expressing or WT L-TGF-β/GARP TMLC cells were surface biotinylated using EZ-link sulfo-NHS biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA, resolved by 4%–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, under non-reducing conditions, immunoblotted, probed with streptavidin-HRP and detected by chemiluminescence, essentially as described ( Mu et al., 2002 39. Mu, D. ∙ Cambier, S. ∙ Fjellbirkeland, L. ... The integrin alpha(v)beta8 mediates epithelial homeostasis through MT1-MMP-dependent activation of TGF-beta1 J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157 :493-507 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunoprecipitations confirmed association of GARP with WT L-TGF-β, L-TGF-β (R249A), and absence of cleavage of LAP from mature TGF-β in the L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP TMLC cells ( Figure S7 ).
The αvβ8 ectodomain was coated along with the controls αvβ3 (R&D Systems), BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-LAP (R&D AF426, 1 μg/ml) onto ELISA plates in PBS (1mM Ca 2+ and 1mM Mg 2+ ) 1 hour at RT. Wells were subsequently washed in PBS and blocked in PBS with 1% BSA WT L-TGF-β1, L-TGF-β1 (R249A), WT L-TGF-β/GARP, L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP expressing TMLC cells were plated at a density of 1x10 5 cells/ml in basal media. After 16 hr, media was removed and applied to wells containing TMLC reporter cells to measure diffusible mature TGF-β, which were incubated overnight prior to lysis and determination of luciferase activity (Promega) as reported ( Mu et al., 2002 39. Mu, D. ∙ Cambier, S. ∙ Fjellbirkeland, L. ... The integrin alpha(v)beta8 mediates epithelial homeostasis through MT1-MMP-dependent activation of TGF-beta1 J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157 :493-507 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ). To measure cell-intrinsic TGF-β1 activation, the attached L-TGF-β1, L-TGF-β1 (R249A), WT L-TGF-β/GARP, L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP or parental TMLC cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. To facilitate comparison between different TMLC lines expressing WT L-TGF-β1, L-TGF-β1 (R249A), WT L-TGF-β/GARP, L-TGF-β (R249A)/GARP (or parental TMLC cells) normalized luciferase activity was expressed as activated TGF-β in pg/ml. Normalization was performed by interpolating luciferase activity against standard curves generated using each TMLC line with varying doses of recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems).
Wild-type and mutant recombinant human integrin αvβ8 and αvβ6 truncated at the junction of the ectodomains and transmembrane domains in pcDNA1neo have been described ( Nishimura et al., 1994; Weinreb et al., 2004 42.

Integrin αvβ8-expressing tumor cells evade host immunity by regulating TGF-β activation in immune cells JCI Insight. 2018; 3 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). To create mutant β8 subunits, SOE was performed using PCR with WT β8 as a template to create mutant constructs all in pcDNA6 V5HisA (Invitrogen) with a stop codon inserted before the V5/His tag. The following mutagenic primers (all in 5 ‘to 3′ orientation) were used: β8 I208R5′-CAGAAGATCTCTGGAAACAGAGATACACC-3′;
5′-GAAGTTTGGTCGACATAATGC-3′ β8 Y172N: 5′-CAATGCAGTGACAACAATTTAGACTGC-3′, 5′-GCAGTCTAAATTGTTGTCACTGCATTG-3′; β8 Y172M: 5′-GATTCATAATCAATGCAGTGACATGAATTTAGACTGCATGCC-3′, 5′-GGCATGCAGTCTAAATTCATGTCACTGCATTGATTATGAATC-3′; β8 Y172A: 5′-GATTCATAATCAATGCAGTGACGCCAATTTAGACTGCATGCC-3′, 5′-GGCATGCAGTCTAAATTGGCGTCACTGCATTGATTATGAATC-3′; β6 I183N: 5′-CCCTTGCAGTAGTAATCCATACTTCTG-3′, 5′-CAGAAGTATGGATTACTACTGCAAGGG-3′.
Porcine L-TGF-β1 with a C4S mutation, to improve secretion and prevent association with L-TGF-β binding proteins, and an N-terminal cleavable (HRV 3C) 7x Histidine-streptavidin binding protein tag to facilitate purification ( Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ), were joined by SOE PCR from pcDNA-GS-TGF-β1 (gift from Dr. Sun, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD ( Zou and Sun, 2004 79. Zou, Z. ∙ Sun, P.D. Overexpression of human transforming growth factor-beta1 using a recombinant CHO cell expression system Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37 :265-272 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar )) and subcloned into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen). Porcine L-TGF-β1 C4S pcDNA6 was modified using the following mutagenic primers, RGE (a mutation that disrupts the integrin binding recognition sequence on L-TGF-β and therefore minimizes the number of L-TGF-βs that bind two integrins simultaneously): 5′-CCGCCGGGGTGAACTGGCCAC-3′; 5′-GTGGCCAGTTCACCCCGGCGG-3′; R249A: 5′-ACCTGCACAGCTCCCGGCACCGCGCAGCCCTGG-3′. Wild-type human TGFβ1 was derived from human TGFβ1_pLX307 ( Rosenbluh et al., 2016 50. Rosenbluh, J. ∙ Mercer, J. ∙ Shrestha, Y. ... Genetic and Proteomic Interrogation of Lower Confidence Candidate Genes Reveals Signaling Networks in β-Catenin-Active Cancers Cell Syst. 2016; 3 :302-316 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) by removing the C-terminal V5 tag using PCR with the following primers; 5′-ATGGCCACCCCGCTGG-3′, 5′-CTCTACTAGTCTCGAGTTATCAGCTGCACTTGCAGGAGCGCAC-3′; 5’-GTGGCCAGTTCACCCCGGCGG-3’. The WT human TGF-β1 IRES GFP cassette was then subcloned into a version of pcDNA6 (Invitrogen) with a puromycin resistance cassette which was amplified from TGFβ1_pLX307 using
5′-ATCGTTTCAGACCCACCTCCC-3′ and 5′-CTCTGCTTAGCGAATTCGTTAACTGGCACCGGG-3′. A R249A mutant of this construct was produced using SOE PCR employing the following mutagenic primers; 5′-CACCGCGCAGCCCTGGACACCAAC-3′, 5′-CCAGGGCTGCGCGGTGCCGGGAG-3′.
N-terminal HA tagged human GARP pcDNA3 ( Cuende et al., 2015 10. Cuende, J. ∙ Liénart, S. ∙ Dedobbeleer, O. ... Monoclonal antibodies against GARP/TGF-β1 complexes inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of human regulatory T cells in vivo Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7 :284ra56 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) was provided by Sophie Lucas (de Duve Institute, UCLouvain, Brussels, Belgium) and the entire HA-GARP reading frame transferred into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen). All constructs were verified by sequencing.
Integrin constructs were expressed using stably expressing CHOLec 3.2.8.1 cells grown in spinner cultures in CHO SFMII (Thermo Fisher) with antibiotics, for structural studies, or transiently transfected in HEK293 cells using 293 SFMII (Thermo Fisher) for biochemical studies. Integrin purification was carried out by affinity chromatography using a Protein G-clone 8B8 column followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 . To produce L-TGF-β for structural studies, 293 cells were transiently transfected with equal amounts of porcine L-TGF-β1 C4S R249A RGD and C4S R249A RGE plasmids, to favor formation of L-TGF-β1 with a single intact RGD binding site to favor 1:1 binding stoichiometry to reduce sample heterogeneity, and purified as described ( Shi et al., 2011 53. Shi, M. ∙ Zhu, J. ∙ Wang, R. ... Latent TGF-β structure and activation Nature. 2011; 474 :343-349 Crossref Scopus (806) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, supernatants were collected from spinner cultures, clarified by centrifugation, filtered though a PES (polyethersulfone) membrane, 0.2 mm pore size (Millipore), concentrated, and purified using Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN), washed with three column volumes of 0.6 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris (pH 8.0) and eluted with 0.25 M imidazole in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The was adjusted to pH 7.4 then applied to Strep-tactin agarose (IBA) (1 mL per 1 L of culture supernatant) and washed with TBS (pH 7.4). Tag was cleaved with recombinant His-tagged HRV-3C protease (Novagen, 100 U/ml, 1 mg/ml), diluted 20-fold in TBS (pH 7.4) with 10% glycerol, applied to the column, and incubated at 4°C for 16 h. The flow-through was washed with two column volumes of TBS (pH 7.4), containing untagged proTGF-β1, then concentrated using centrifugal concentrators (Millipore) to about 1 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mM NaCl. The homogeneity and purity of all protein preparations were verified by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie blue and protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce).
To prepare integrin-Fab or integrin-L-TGF-β complexes, 100 μg of recombinant αvβ8 was incubated in a 2-fold molar excess of each Fab or L-TGF-β, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, subjected to size exclusion chromatography and concentrated to 6 to 9 mg/ml. For cryo-EM grid preparation, 2.5 μL of purified αvβ8 complex were deposited onto Quantifoil grids. For the αvβ8/L-TGF-β C4S R249A RGD at 0.25 mg/ml, a 400 mesh 1.2/1/3 holey carbon gold grid was used. For the αvβ8/L-TGF-β/C4S R249A /RGDRGE complex at 0.075 mg/mL, a 400 mesh 2/2 holey carbon copper grid that had been covered with a thin layer of graphene oxide was used. For the αvβ8/C6D4/11D12V2 and the αvβ8/C6-RGD3/11D12V2 complexes, both at 6.8 mg/mL, 300 mesh 1.2/1.3 holey carbon gold grids were used. Except for the graphene-coated grid, grids were glow-discharged for 60 s at 15 mA prior to sample application and freezing. The αvβ8/L-TGF-β C4S R249A RGD and αvβ8/L-TGF-β C4S R249A RGD/RGE complexes were frozen using a FEI Vitrobot Mark IV using a 4 s blot time. The αvβ8/C6D4/11D12V2 and αvβ8/C6-RGD3/11D12V2 complexes were frozen using a FEI Vitrobot Mark III using a 3-4 s blotting time. All grids were frozen with 100% humidity at 20°C and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen.
Four datasets were acquired on a FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated in nano-probe mode at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV and a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector. Automated data collection was carried out using the SerialEM software ( Mastronarde, 2005 33. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3221) PubMed Google Scholar ). Movies were recorded in super-resolution mode with a super-resolution pixel size of 0.6725 Å/px and a nominal magnification of 105kx at a dose rate of ∼8 e - /px/s. For the C4S R249A RGD complex and the C4S R249A RGD/RGE, each 16 s movie contained 80 frames of 200 ms each, which corresponds to a total dose of ∼70 e - /Å 2 . For the αvβ8/C6D4/11D12V2 complex and the αvβ8/C6RGD3/11D12VV2 complex, each 12 s movie contained 60 frames of 200 ms, which corresponds to a total dose of ∼50 e - /Å 2 . Each dataset was collected in a single session with a nominal defocus range of 1.0 - 2.5 μm under focus. Total micrographs collected for each dataset are as follows: C4S R249A RDG complex: 1684 micrographs; C4S R249A RGD/RGE complex: 2682 micrographs; αvβ8/C6D4/11D12V2 complex: 1644 micrographs; αvβ8/C6RGD3/11D12V2 complex: 4033 micrographs.
Dose fractionated super-resolution image stacks were motion corrected and binned 2 × 2 by Fourier cropping using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 75. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ). Motion corrected sums without dose-weighting were used for contrast transfer function (CTF) determination using GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 74. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ) or CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 49. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2867) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were picked using the reference-free method using Gautomatch ( https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch ) and boxed out using Relion ( Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2016; Zivanov et al., 2018 16. Fernandez-Leiro, R. ∙ Scheres, S.H.W. Unravelling biological macromolecules with cryo-electron microscopy Nature. 2016; 537 :339-346 Crossref Scopus (313) PubMed Google Scholar 78. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a box size of 300 pixels and binned to 64 pixels. After 2D alignment and classification was carried out using cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 46. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ), selected particles were re-extracted in Relion and binned to 128 pixels to generate ab initio initial models using cryoSPARC. 3D classification schemes are outlined for the αvβ8/LTGF-β-R249A complex and the αvβ8/L-TGF-β-RGD/RGE complex in Figure S5 and for the αvβ8/C6RGD3/11D12V2 complex in Figure S4 . No 3D classification was used for the αvβ8/L-TGF-β-RGD/RGE complex dataset. For all final maps, non-uniform refinement, local resolution refinement, local resolution estimation, sharpening, and local filtering was carried out using cryoSPARC to yield maps with a final pixel size of 1.345Å/px. The number of particles contributing to the final maps are as follows: αvβ8/L-TGF-β (conformation iv): 43,600 particles; αvβ8/C6D4/11D12V2: 84,266 particles; αvβ8/C6-RGD3/11D12V2: 221,159 particles. Images were rendered using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 45. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33470) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PyMol ( DeLano, 2002 11. DeLano, W.L. Pymol: An open-source molecular graphics tool CCP4 Newsletter On Protein Crystallography. 2002; 40 :82-92 Google Scholar ).
The atomic model of the αv headpiece from the crystal structure of αvβ6 (PDB: 4UM8 ) with glycans removed was fitted to the cryo-EM map as a rigid body. An atomic model of the β8 headpiece was generated by rigid body fitting of a homology model based on the same crystal structure (PDB: 4UM8 ) using Modeler ( Webb and Sali, 2014 69. Webb, B. ∙ Sali, A. Comparative Protein Structure Modeling Using MODELLER Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2014; 47 :5.6.1-5.6.37 Crossref Scopus (823) PubMed Google Scholar ) and adjusted around the SyMBS cation area using the crystal structure of αvβ3 (PDB: 3IJE ), then fitted into the cryo-EM density map as a rigid body. Atomic models of Fabs were generated with RosettaAntibody using multiple-template grafting and H3 loop modelization ( Lyskov et al., 2013 30. Lyskov, S. ∙ Chou, F.C. ∙ Conchúir, S.O. ... Serverification of molecular modeling applications: the Rosetta Online Server that Includes Everyone (ROSIE) PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e63906 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the primary sequence of their V h /V k . An atomic model of the arm domain of L-TGF-β1 was generated from the crystal structure of L-TGF-β1 bound to αvβ6 (PDB: 5FFO ). The models for Fab C6D4 and Fab C6-RGD3 or L-TGF-β1 were then fitted as a rigid body to the map. The Fab 11D12V2 was not modeled, although the density is clearly resolved. Prototypical CHOLec3.2.8.1 glycans were added back to the model at the solvent exposed N-glycosylation consensus sites using GLYCAM ( Singh et al., 2016 54. Singh, A. ∙ Tessier, M.B. ∙ Pederson, K. ... Extension and validation of the GLYCAM force field parameters for modeling glycosaminoglycans Can. J. Chem. 2016; 94 :927-935 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sugar base of glycans were trimmed to fit into the corresponding densities and further refined in Rosetta using a dedicated protocol that uses physically realistic geometries based on prior knowledge of saccharide chemical properties ( Frenz et al., 2019 18. Frenz, B. ∙ Rämisch, S. ∙ Borst, A.J. ... Automatically Fixing Errors in Glycoprotein Structures with Rosetta Structure. 2019; 27 :134-139 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). After rigid body fitting, all models were manually adjusted to fit the cryo-EM maps in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20218) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by real space refinement using Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18498) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Rosetta ( Wang et al., 2016 66. Wang, R.Y. ∙ Song, Y. ∙ Barad, B.A. ... Automated structure refinement of macromolecular assemblies from cryo-EM maps using Rosetta eLife. 2016; 5 Published online September 26, 2016 Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar ). All modeling was aided by using EM maps that were focused on specific regions, as well as sharpened and unsharpened maps. All maps used for modeling have been deposited.
ELISA plates were coated with recombinant αv-integrins (1 μg/ml coating concentration, all from R&D systems) blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour, and antibodies allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT and detected with anti-mouse-HRP.
ELISA plates were coated with integrins (2 μg/ml coating concentration) and blocked with PBS with 5% BSA for 1 hour and then CHO-GARP/L-TGF-β, or CHO mock (5 x10 5 ) transfectants in the presence of various concentrations of C6D4, C6-RGD3 or 3G9 were centrifuged onto integrin coated wells (10 x g) for 5 min allowed to adhere for 30 min at RT after which the plates were inverted and centrifuged (10 x g) for 5 min and then immediated fixed and stained (1% formaldehyde, 20% MeOH, 0.5% crystal violet) and after extensive washing, dye was solubilized in PBS with 1% T-X100 for 1 hr at RT and attached cells estimated by absorbance (A 595 ).
ELISA plates were coated with recombinant porcine L-TGF-β1 (0.5 μg/ml coating concentration), blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour, and integrins at various concentrations were allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT, and detected with 8B8 antibody and anti-mouse-HRP.
Cell staining for L-TGF-β1 was confirmed by flow cytometry using anti-LAP (R&D biotinylated anti-LAP BAF246 and streptavidin APC) and GARP cell surface expression was confirmed by anti-HA staining (clone 5E11D8 (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ)). EGFP expression was also used as a surrogate marker for L-TGF-β1 expression. High-expressing pools of expressing cells were established by sorting (BD FACSAria, BD Biosciences, US).
For peptide competition assays, ELISA plates were coated with recombinant porcine L-TGF-β1 (0.5 μg/ml coating concentration), blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 hour, and integrins at 0.5 μg/ml were pre-incubated with peptides at various concentrations for 20 minutes, allowed to bind for 2 hours at RT, and detected with 8B8 antibody and anti-mouse-HRP.
Multiple protein sequence alignments for integrins were generated using Clustal Omega ( Madeira et al., 2019 31. Madeira, F. ∙ Park, Y.M. ∙ Lee, J. ... The EMBL-EBI search and sequence analysis tools APIs in 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W636-W641 Crossref Scopus (3084) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ELISA and TMLC assays are reported as means ± SEM. All assays were repeated a minimum of 3 times. All statistical analyses were performed using the software package Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
All structures and models have been deposited into the EMDB and the PDB. The accession numbers for primary conformation of αvβ8/L-TGF-β (conformation iv) reported in this paper are EMD-20794 and PDB: 6UJA . For the additional αvβ8/L-TGF-β conformations, i-iii and v-vii the accession numbers are EMD-20797 to EMD-20802. A consensus map of all seven conformations focused at the headpiece region with a nominal resolution of 2.9Å was used for modeling and is deposited with the accession number EMD-21125. For αvβ8/C6D4, the accession numbers are EMD-20795 and PDB: 6UJB and for αvβ8/C6-RGD3 they are EMD-20796 and PDB: 6UJC . Three cryo-EM dataset collections containing movies, aligned micrographs, and stacks of αvβ8 bound to L-TGF-β or C6D4 have been deposited into the EMPIAR database: EMPIAR-10343 (αvβ8 bound to L-TGF-β collected on holey carbon grids), EMPIAR-10344 (αvβ8 bound to L-TGF-β collected on graphene oxide grids) and EMPIAR-10345 (αvβ8 bound to C6D4 collected on holey carbon grids).
