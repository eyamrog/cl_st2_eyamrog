Title: Repopulating Microglia Promote Brain Repair in an IL-6-Dependent Manner


Abstract: Summary

Cognitive dysfunction and reactive microglia are hallmarks of traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet whether these cells contribute to cognitive deficits and secondary inflammatory pathology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that removal of microglia from the mouse brain has little effect on the outcome of TBI, but inducing the turnover of these cells through either pharmacologic or genetic approaches can yield a neuroprotective microglial phenotype that profoundly aids recovery. The beneficial effects of these repopulating microglia are critically dependent on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans -signaling via the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and robustly support adult neurogenesis, specifically by augmenting the survival of newborn neurons that directly support cognitive function. We conclude that microglia in the mammalian brain can be manipulated to adopt a neuroprotective and pro-regenerative phenotype that can aid repair and alleviate the cognitive deficits arising from brain injury.

Section: Introduction

Microglia, the most abundant type of immune cell in the brain, play important roles in brain development, maintenance, and disease ( Kettenmann et al., 2011; Wolf et al., 2017 36.

These distant cousins of peripheral macrophages colonize the brain early in development ( Ginhoux et al., 2010; Hoeffel and Ginhoux, 2018 20. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ...

Microglia are believed to play similar physiological roles in the adult brain ( Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007 26. Hanisch, U.K. ∙ Kettenmann, H. Microglia: active sensor and versatile effector cells in the normal and pathologic brain Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10 :1387-1394 Crossref Scopus (2948) PubMed Google Scholar ). They also respond vigorously to both chronic disease and acute insults affecting the CNS ( Jassam et al., 2017; Hickman et al., 2018 27. Hickman, S. ∙ Izzy, S. ∙ Sen, P. ...

Because microglia share many phenotypic features with monocyte-derived macrophages, elucidating their contribution to CNS injury or disease has proven challenging. The identification of more unique microglia markers has helped distinguishing them from infiltrating monocytes and macrophages and better characterize their biology across a range of settings ( Bennett et al., 2016; Butovsky et al., 2014; Buttgereit et al., 2016; Haage et al., 2019; Yona et al., 2013 2.

In addition, the development of CNS-penetrable drugs that inhibit colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), on which microglia depend for their survival ( Elmore et al., 2014 13. Elmore, M.R. ∙ Najafi, A.R. ∙ Koike, M.A. ...

Microglial repopulation resolves inflammation and promotes brain recovery after injury Glia. 2017; 65 :931-944 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). This, together with genetic approaches to selectively target these cells ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 48. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ), has resulted in more direct evidence for dual and opposing roles of microglia in normal brain function and disease. Specifically, microglia were reported to not only mediate learning-associated synaptic plasticity in the healthy adult brain ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 48. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ), but also to contribute to pathology and cognitive dysfunction during both neuroinflammation ( Rice et al., 2017 51. Rice, R.A. ∙ Pham, J. ∙ Lee, R.J. ... Microglial repopulation resolves inflammation and promotes brain recovery after injury Glia. 2017; 65 :931-944 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ) and normal aging ( Elmore et al., 2018 16. Elmore, M.R.P. ∙ Hohsfield, L.A. ∙ Kramár, E.A. ... Replacement of microglia in the aged brain reverses cognitive, synaptic, and neuronal deficits in mice Aging Cell. 2018; 17 :e12832 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been suggested that some of the damaging properties of microglia behavior might be reversible through e.g., short-term CSF-1R inhibitor treatment ( Rice et al., 2015, 2017; Weber et al., 2019 50. Rice, R.A. ∙ Spangenberg, E.E. ∙ Yamate-Morgan, H. ... Elimination of microglia improves functional outcomes following extensive neuronal loss in the hippocampus J.

Psychiatry. 2019; 85 :667-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), but many mechanistic questions remain, and our incomplete understanding of basic microglia biology therefore continues to present a major medical challenge.
Chronic non-resolving inflammation with widespread microglial activation is a defining feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) ( Ertürk et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2018; Simon et al., 2017 17. Ertürk, A. ∙ Mentz, S. ∙ Stout, E.E. ... Interfering with the chronic immune response rescues chronic degeneration after traumatic brain injury J.

Neurol. 2017; 13 :171-191 Crossref Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ), and here, we took advantage of this characteristic to directly probe putative roles of microglia in influencing neurodegeneration and cognitive functions. In the acute phase, microglia are known to rapidly respond to damage-associated molecular patterns that are released as a result of brain injury ( Bianchi, 2007 3. Bianchi, M.E. DAMPs, PAMPs and alarmins: all we need to know about danger J. Leukoc. Biol. 2007; 81 :1-5 Crossref Scopus (1258) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then migrate toward sites damage in an ATP-dependent manner ( Davalos et al., 2005 12. Davalos, D. ∙ Grutzendler, J. ∙ Yang, G. ... ATP mediates rapid microglial response to local brain injury in vivo Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 :752-758 Crossref Scopus (3017) PubMed Google Scholar ). Beneficial aspects of this early microglial activation are thought to include the clearance of cellular debris, which is a critical part of any successful wound healing process ( Giulian et al., 1989; Neumann et al., 2009; Hilla et al., 2017; Bellver-Landete et al., 2019 1. Bellver-Landete, V. ∙ Bretheau, F. ∙ Mailhot, B. ... Microglia are an essential component of the neuroprotective scar that forms after spinal cord injury Nat.

Hilla, A.M. ∙ Diekmann, H. ∙ Fischer, D. Microglia are irrelevant for neuronal degeneration and axon regeneration after acute injury J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :6113-6124 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar 43. Neumann, H. ∙ Kotter, M.R. ∙ Franklin, R.J. Debris clearance by microglia: an essential link between degeneration and regeneration Brain. 2009; 132 :288-295 Crossref Scopus (855) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, many brain microglia retain an activated phenotype well into the chronic stages of TBI on the basis of inflammatory gene expression and an amoeboid and/or phagocytic appearance. This persistent state of activation is generally viewed as detrimental ( Ertürk et al., 2016 17. Ertürk, A. ∙ Mentz, S. ∙ Stout, E.E. ... Interfering with the chronic immune response rescues chronic degeneration after traumatic brain injury J. Neurosci. 2016; 36 :9962-9975 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), although direct evidence for this is scant. Overall, there is still great uncertainty as to what role microglia really have in relation to TBI, i.e., do they indeed worsen the neurological outcome as drivers of secondary inflammatory pathology, do they hamper or support endogenous repair processes, or perhaps are all types of processes in place at different temporal stages of the injury process? Here, we addressed these questions in a well-defined mouse model of TBI.

Section: Results

We first examined whether microglia absence alters the cognitive outcome from TBI in hippocampus-dependent tasks. For this, we depleted microglia by feeding mice the CSF-1R antagonist PLX5622 ( Elmore et al., 2014 13. Elmore, M.R. ∙ Najafi, A.R. ∙ Koike, M.A. ... Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor signaling is necessary for microglia viability, unmasking a microglia progenitor cell in the adult brain Neuron. 2014; 82 :380-397 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1264) PubMed Google Scholar ), which induces death of Iba1 pos TMEM119 pos microglia, but has minimal effects on circulating monocytes ( Bellver-Landete et al., 2019 1. Bellver-Landete, V. ∙ Bretheau, F. ∙ Mailhot, B. ... Microglia are an essential component of the neuroprotective scar that forms after spinal cord injury Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :518 Crossref Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ). Controlled cortical impact was used to inflict TBI. Continuous administration of PLX5622, initiated 3 weeks prior to TBI, induced widespread loss of Iba1 pos TMEM119 pos cells, including in the hippocampus where a 95% depletion efficiency was maintained throughout the experimental time period after TBI ( Figures 1 A and 1B). These results stood in sharp contrast to mice administered control chow (i.e., vehicle), and in which a 5-fold increase in the number of Iba1 pos cells was observed in the hippocampus over the 12-day period after TBI compared with those with sham surgery. Corroborating evidence for these findings was provided through CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x tdTomato mice where administration of PLX5622 induced robust depletion of tdTomato-tagged microglia throughout the brain ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Loss of other CNS-resident macrophage populations was also observed with long-term PLX5622 treatment, specifically in the choroid plexus and meninges ( Figures S1 C and S1D).
Having confirmed efficient depletion of brain microglia with continuous PLX5622 treatment, we next tested the cognitive abilities of experimental mice in three behavioral paradigms that rely on hippocampal function. Our main test, active place avoidance (APA), is a challenging spatial learning task, in which animals are placed on a rotating turntable and required to continuously change their location on the basis of visual cues to avoid being moved into a stationary shock zone ( Vukovic et al., 2013 61. Vukovic, J. ∙ Borlikova, G.G. ∙ Ruitenberg, M.J. ... Immature doublecortin-positive hippocampal neurons are important for learning but not for remembering J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :6603-6613 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). We employed this task to test spatial learning in both sham and TBI mice over a 5-day APA testing paradigm ( Figures 1 C–1F). Absence of microglia (and other CNS-resident macrophage populations) in PLX5622-treated mice did not significantly alter the locomotor behavior (distance covered) ( Figure 1 D). Irrespective of microglia presence or absence, sham-operated control mice quickly learned to avoid the shock zone, as evident from the improved performance (reduction in shock zone entries) over time ( Figures 1 E and 1F) and also “within session” learning, which is more reflective of short-term working memory ( Figure S1 E). In sharp contrast, TBI mice were not able to learn this task, making significantly more mistakes (i.e., greater number of entries into the shock zone) than their sham-operated counterparts, and they also failed to show an improvement in performance over time. The absence of microglia (and other CSF-1R-dependent brain macrophages) in the PLX5622-treated group did not affect this impaired APA performance of TBI mice in any way. Pharmacological removal of microglia thus did not interfere with spatial learning outcomes under both sham and TBI conditions. We corroborated these results in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze task ( Figures S1 F–S1J).
Our previous work uncovered an important role for microglia in regulating the activity of neural stem/progenitor cells in the adult brain ( Vukovic et al., 2012 60. Vukovic, J. ∙ Colditz, M.J. ∙ Blackmore, D.G. ... Microglia modulate hippocampal neural precursor activity in response to exercise and aging J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :6435-6443 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we next determined how the loss of microglia would affect hippocampal neurogenesis after TBI, evaluating both the number of newly generated immature neurons expressing the microtubule-associated protein doublecortin (DCX) ( Rao and Shetty, 2004 49. Rao, M.S. ∙ Shetty, A.K. Efficacy of doublecortin as a marker to analyse the absolute number and dendritic growth of newly generated neurons in the adult dentate gyrus Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 19 :234-246 Crossref Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the size of the pool of intermediate neuronal progenitor cells expressing the transcription factor Tbr2 ( Hodge et al., 2012 29. Hodge, R.D. ∙ Nelson, B.R. ∙ Kahoud, R.J. ... Tbr2 is essential for hippocampal lineage progression from neural stem cells to intermediate progenitors and neurons. Journal of Neuroscience. 2012; 32 :6275-6287 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). In sham-operated controls, continuous PLX5622 treatment had no effect on the different stages of adult neurogenesis (i.e., neuronal precursor proliferation versus newborn neuron generation) ( Figures 1 G–1J). By contrast, we observed a striking overall reduction in the number of immature hippocampal DCX pos neurons, by more than half, in TBI mice (12 days after injury) ( Figure 1 G), and the loss of microglia (and other CSF-1R-dependent brain macrophages) in PLX5622-treated TBI mice resulted in a further reduction in the total number of newborn neurons, which was maintained for 19 weeks ( Figure S1 K). Pulse-chase experiments with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) revealed no difference in the number of neurons that were born after injury (i.e., DCX pos BrdU pos cells) and survived up until day 12 ( Figure 1 H). Consistent with this, both the total and actively proliferating (i.e., EdU pos ) number of Tbr2 pos neuronal precursor cells did not differ between control and PLX5622-treated TBI mice (12 days after injury) ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Hippocampal volumes were also unchanged with continuous PLX5622 treatment ( Figures S1 L and S1M). These findings show that the removal of microglia from brain regions that are not directly impacted but actively undergoing neurodegenerative changes and gliosis (i.e., the hippocampus) might interfere with the survival of DCX pos cells that were born prior to and/or very shortly after TBI. Continuous PLX5622 treatment otherwise had very little bearing on outcomes in the specific behavioral paradigms that directly probe hippocampal function.
We next explored the effect of replenishing the brain with new microglia. We used two independent and complementary approaches to achieve this. First, we used a genetic model (CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR and CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato mice) in which microglia can be selectively ablated through intraperitoneal diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment and then replenished ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S2 A). Second, we used the established pharmacological approach, but with short-term rather than continuous PLX5622 treatment to induce microglia turnover ( Figure S2 B).
Induction of diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) expression in CX 3 CR1-expressing cells was achieved by oral gavage of 3- to 4-week-old mice with tamoxifen, leaving only microglia sensitive to DT-induced cell death after a 6-week rest period during which peripheral monocytes are turned over ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 48. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ); control mice received corn oil only. Administration of DT to tamoxifen-treated CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato mice for three consecutive days prior to surgery indeed led to robust depletion (>70%) of microglia as expected ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Notably, repopulating microglia (tdTomato pos Iba1 pos cells) started to appear in the hippocampus of TBI mice 3 days after the last DT injection (2 days after surgery) and reached sham control levels (corn oil treatment, gray line) by day 3 after injury, after which their numbers gradually became indistinguishable again from those in TBI mice that had not been subjected to microglial depletion (7 days after TBI onward) ( Figure S2 A); the repopulation dynamics were similar in the pharmacological approach ( Figure S2 B). Repopulating microglia were morphologically different (i.e., longer and more branched processes) from the brain’s original microglia at 3 days after injury ( Figures S2 C–S2F). Astrogliosis was observed in response to TBI, but the number of astrocytes was not changed by microglia repopulation ( Figure S2 G).
Strikingly, both the genetic and pharmacological approach for inducing microglia turnover during the acute phase of TBI significantly ameliorated the learning deficits in the APA task at 12 days after injury ( Figures 2 C–2E and 2H–2J). Improvements in short-term (“within session”) working memory were also found ( Figure S2 H). The behavioral improvements resulting from this microglial depletion and replenishment paradigm were further evident in an expanded re-learning paradigm (measure of cognitive flexibility) in which the shock zone was moved to the opposite location (APA-RL) ( Figures 2 F, 2G, 2K, and 2L), and also in the MWM ( Figure S2 J) and Y-maze ( Figure S2 K) tasks. These benefits were long-lasting and evident for at least 9 months after TBI ( Figures 2 M–2O). Delaying microglial depletion and repopulation to the more chronic phase of TBI (as well as continuous microglial depletion for >4 months after TBI) had no effect, however, on spatial learning in the APA task ( Figure S2 L). Last, to rule out any potential confounding effect from the depletion of CNS-resident macrophage populations in the meninges and/or choroid plexus (or elsewhere), we also directly injected DT into the hippocampus of CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR mice to selectively target and ablate microglia here ( Figures 2 P and S2 M–S2P). When subjected to TBI and subsequently tested in APA 12 days later, these mice (but not vehicle-injected controls) also learned to successfully avoid the shock zone ( Figures 2 R–2T) and showed improvements in short-term (“within session”) working memory ( Figure S2 I). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the emergence of repopulating microglia in the brain significantly improves behavioral outcomes in two independent transient depletion paradigms.
We next investigated whether enhanced neurogenesis could be part of the mechanism through which repopulating microglia augment cognitive function. Consistent with earlier observations ( Figure 1 G), TBI itself led to a >60% reduction in the total number of DCX pos cells within the ipsilateral hippocampus of corn oil-treated CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR mice (i.e., those not sensitive to DT-mediated microglia depletion) compared with age-matched sham-operated controls. Strikingly however, the total number of immature DCX pos neurons present in the brain after TBI was increased by ∼2-fold in CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR mice that were subjected to microglia depletion and replenishment (tamoxifen-treated group) at both 12 days ( Figures 3 A–3C) and 4 months after TBI ( Figure S3 A). Pulse-chase experiments with BrdU further revealed a large increase in the number of newly generated neurons that were born after injury (i.e., DCX pos BrdU pos cells) and survived up until day 12 in TBI mice with repopulating microglia ( Figure 3 D). Increased presence ( Figure 3 E) and activity ( Figure 3 F) of hippocampal Tbr2 pos neuronal precursors was also observed at this time point. Similar increases in DCX pos cell numbers were obtained when a pharmacological approach was used to induce microglial turnover during the acute phase of TBI ( Figures 3 G–3I). Greater presence and activity of Tbr2 pos neuronal precursor cells was also observed under these conditions ( Figures 3 J and 3K). To fully rule out peripheral and/or off-target effects, we directly injected DT into the hippocampus of sensitized CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR mice to only induce microglia turnover locally ( Figure 3 L). Once again, we observed significant benefits of microglial depletion and replenishment on after TBI neurogenesis ( Figures 3 M–3P).
Corroborative evidence for the putative neuroprotective effects of repopulating microglia was provided by experiments employing DCX creETR2 x tdTomato mice in which adult-born granule cells can be conspicuously labeled ( Figures S3 B and S3C). Tamoxifen treatment induced tdTomato expression in ∼40% of immature neurons, which express DCX up to 3–4 weeks after their birth ( Cheng et al., 2011 9. Cheng, X. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Huang, Y. ... Pulse labeling and long-term tracing of newborn neurons in the adult subgranular zone Cell Res. 2011; 21 :338-349 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 B). We observed increased survival of these immature tdTomato pos DCX pos neurons, and also of mature (tdTomato pos DCX neg ) granule cells that were born/labeled >6 weeks prior to TBI ( Figures S3 C and S3D). We further observed greater complexity of tdTomato pos dendrites in the presence of repopulating microglia ( Figure S3 E), and we were able to visualize tdTomato pos projections and puncta within the CA3 target region, suggesting integration ( Figure S3 F). Hippocampal tissue volumes were also found to be greater in the brains of mice that had undergone microglial depletion and repopulation ( Figures S3 G–S3I); for reassurance, these key findings were replicated in an independent laboratory ( Figure S3 J).
Notably, the neurogenic benefits of microglial depletion and replenishment were restricted to a narrow window during the first 3 days after injury, as microglial turnover after this time did not support the enhanced survival and production of newborn neurons ( Figures S3 K and S3L). Induction of microglial turnover 1 week prior to TBI also had no effect on the production or survival of newborn neurons at 12 days after TBI ( Figure S3 M), indicating that there is no benefit associated with replenished microglia per se.
Next, we assessed whether the increased number of DCX pos cells in the brains of TBI mice with repopulating microglia contributed to improved behavioral outcomes. DCX DTR mice were used to selectively ablate DCX pos cells through unilateral intra-hippocampal injection of DT ( Figure S3 N) in sham and TBI mice, with and without repopulating microglia ( Figure S3 O). When we examined the spatial learning abilities of these mice ( Figures 3 Q–3T), the established improvements in APA learning of DCX DTR mice with TBI and repopulating microglia ( Figures 3 R and 3T) were lost when newly born DCX pos neurons were selectively ablated and the mice were subsequently challenged with a new learning paradigm in which the location of the shock zone was changed (APA-RL) ( Figures 3 S and 3T). These findings provide direct evidence that post-TBI neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus is functional given that the microglia-dependent improvements in learning, under conditions where these cells are being actively turned over, disappear when DCX pos cells are removed.
Having established that active microglial turnover during the acute phase of TBI stimulates functional neurogenesis, we next explored the putative signaling pathway(s) that mediate these effects ( Figure S4 A). Of the various genes examined through qRT-PCR, we found that only interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression was significantly increased (>2.7-fold; p < 0.001) in the hippocampus of sensitized CX 3 CR1 creERT2 x iDTR mice during the repopulation phase (3 days after TBI; i.e., when presence of replenishing microglia is required in order for these cells to be able to exert their neuroprotective and/or pro-regenerative effects). However, it is of note that TBI-induced increases in IL-1β and CXCL1 expression were almost abolished in the presence of repopulating microglia. Further exploration of genes associated with IL-6 signaling in whole hippocampal tissue homogenates showed that expression amounts of IL6Ra, IL-6 signal transducer (IL6st, also known as gp130 [IL6st/gp130]), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were all increased with repopulating microglia ( Figure S4 B).
Given these findings, we next explored whether elevated IL-6 signaling could underpin the observed improvements in TBI outcomes. We first confirmed that repopulating microglia are indeed critically required for increased IL-6 expression by inducing the turnover of these cells with PLX5622 treatment in sensitized CX 3 CR1 creERT2 x iDTR mice, followed by their local re-depletion with DT ( Figure 4 A). We then identified hippocampal granule cells as the main source of IL-6 after TBI under conditions where repopulating microglia are present ( Figures 4 B–4E). We also injected IL-6 itself directly into the hippocampus of wild-type (WT) TBI mice, theorizing that this would mimic a key change associated with the emergence of repopulating microglia. We indeed found that the IL-6 injection alone was sufficient to significantly improve both APA performance ( Figure 4 F) and neurogenesis ( Figure 4 G).
To further investigate the importance of increased IL-6 expression, we injected IL-6 receptor (IL-6Ra) blocking antibody MR16-1 ( Tawara et al., 2011 58. Tawara, K. ∙ Oxford, J.T. ∙ Jorcyk, C.L. Clinical significance of interleukin (IL)-6 in cancer metastasis to bone: potential of anti-IL-6 therapies Cancer Manag. Res. 2011; 3 :177-189 PubMed Google Scholar ) ipsilaterally into the hippocampus on day 3 after TBI (i.e., when repopulating microglia are present) ( Figure S4 C). Blockade of IL-6 signaling locally in the hippocampus with MR16-1 indeed abolished both the behavioral ( Figure 4 H) and neurogenic benefits ( Figure 4 I) that were otherwise associated with microglial turnover in sensitized CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR mice. MR16-1 treatment also slightly reduced microglia proliferation, but this did not alter the total number of these cells in the hippocampus compared with cells in that of controls ( Figure S4 D). To further address the role of IL-6, we next used Vav-Cre x IL-6Ra flox/flox mice to remove IL-6Ra from Vav-expressing cells, which include microglia ( vav being one of the top 5% genes expressed by microglia) and hematopoietic cells ( Ogilvy et al., 1999 46. Ogilvy, S. ∙ Metcalf, D. ∙ Gibson, L. ... Promoter elements of vav drive transgene expression in vivo throughout the hematopoietic compartment Blood. 1999; 94 :1855-1863 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis after microglia turnover was completely lost in these conditional IL-6Ra gene knockout animals with TBI ( Figure 4 J). Neurogenesis levels in the contralateral (i.e., non-TBI) side were not significantly different between genotypes ( Figures S4 E–S4G). Collectively, these findings provide direct evidence that IL-6 signaling is critically required for the neuroprotective and/or pro-regenerative phenotype that is associated with repopulating microglia, and microglia-dependent improvements in TBI outcomes are lost under conditions where these cells are still present but where IL-6 signaling is blocked.
Biological effects of IL-6 are highly complex as they can be mediated via multiple pathways. Classic IL-6 signaling takes place mainly in immune cells via membrane-bound IL-6R, which engages the common signal transducing subunit gp130 to initiate downstream events. Importantly, however, IL-6 signaling can also occur in cells that do not express IL-6R through a process referred to as trans -signaling (for review, see Garbers and Rose-John, 2018 19. Garbers, C. ∙ Rose-John, S. Dissecting interleukin-6 classic- and trans-signaling in inflammation and cancer Methods Mol. Biol. 2018; 1725 :127-140 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), generated through the proteolytic shedding of membrane-bound form, can bind IL-6 in the extracellular space and then induce signaling in virtually any cell type as gp130 is ubiquitously expressed.
To determine whether the positive effects of IL-6 signaling were mediated via the classic or trans -signaling pathway, we first injected soluble gp130-Fc, a protein that only blocks IL-6 trans -signaling ( Jostock et al., 2001 34. Jostock, T. ∙ Müllberg, J. ∙ Ozbek, S. ... Soluble gp130 is the natural inhibitor of soluble interleukin-6 receptor transsignaling responses Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268 :160-167 Crossref Scopus (544) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that injection of sgp130-Fc into the hippocampus of TBI mice completely annulled the behavioral and neurogenic benefits that would otherwise be associated with the presence of repopulating microglia ( Figures 4 K and 4L). Key involvement of the IL-6 trans -signaling pathway was further and independently confirmed through the injection of hyper-IL-6, a fusion protein of sIL-6R and IL-6 that selectively and efficiently stimulates trans -signaling in gp130-expressing cells ( Fischer et al., 1997 18. Fischer, M. ∙ Goldschmitt, J. ∙ Peschel, C. ... I. A bioactive designer cytokine for human hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15 :142-145 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 M). Corroborative evidence for this also came from the combined application of MR16-1 and hyper-IL-6, and for which no loss of an IL-6 effect on hippocampal neurogenesis was observed. Because MR16-1 blocks the IL-6 binding site on endogenous IL-6R, but cannot do so for hyper-IL-6, this leaves only trans -signaling pathway as the mechanism via which the established IL-6 effects are mediated in the presence of repopulating microglia.
Having established that repopulating microglia exert neuroprotection and improve cognitive outcomes after TBI, we last investigated what makes these cells unique at a transcriptional level. For this investigation, we took advantage of CX 3 CR 1 creERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato mice (6 weeks after gavage) in which the brain’s microglia can be permanently labeled with the reporter tdTomato and then turned over with DT treatment ( Figure 5 A). The labeled (i.e., tdTomato pos ) original and repopulating microglia were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from the hippocampus of saline and DT-injected mice (3 days after TBI), respectively, and then processed for subsequent downstream bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
Overall, a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found when the transcriptome of the original and repopulating microglia was compared (3,146 DEGs using a false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) ( Figures S5 A and S5B). In particular, repopulating microglia exhibited higher expression of genes that encode for proteins with known roles in wound healing and repair (e.g., Emilin2 , Fn1 , Alcam , and Cspg4 ) ( Figure 5 A). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) further revealed decreased activity of canonical pathways involving pattern/damage recognition and interferon signaling ( Figure 5 B), in addition to reflecting the proliferative state of the repopulating microglia. Although the phenotype of the brain’s original microglia population after TBI appears to reflect that of disease-associated microglia (DAMs) ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 35. Keren-Shaul, H. ∙ Spinrad, A. ∙ Weiner, A. ... A unique microglia type associated with restricting development of Alzheimer’s disease Cell. 2017; 169 :1276-1290.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2877) PubMed Google Scholar ), a vastly different transcriptional signature was found for repopulating microglia. Top upstream regulator (USR) predictions in repopulating microglia included downregulated activity of multiple type I interferon (IFN) pathway components (IFN-alpha, IRF7, STAT1, IRF3 IFNAR, and IFNB1) and increased activity of the STAT3 pathway ( Figure 5 C); IL-6 ranked as the 33 rd USR. Consistent with the IPA USR predictions, an analysis of DNA-binding motif representation via ISMARA also demonstrated reduced IFN pathway activity in repopulating microglia on the basis of a strong correlation with the expression and activity of IRF7 and Stat2 in the individual samples ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Thus, the gene expression profile of repopulating microglia in the injured brain is fundamentally distinct to that of the original microglial population, and the major changes were a reduced reactive and enhanced proliferative state of the repopulating cells.
The benefits of repopulating microglia were once again confirmed in experiments involving Scl creERT2 x ZsGreen mice (4 weeks after gavage) with regards to neuroprotection ( Figures S5 E and S5F), and also through an attenuating effect on the recruitment of identified (i.e., ZsGreen pos ) infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils ( Figures S5 G and S5I). Spatial transcriptomics further highlighted the influence of repopulating microglia on their local microenvironment. Specifically, there was a suppression of genes linked to the neurotoxic and/or neuroinflammatory (A1) phenotype of astrocytes ( Figure S5 J), as also confirmed at the protein level by co-staining these cells with the A1 marker C3 ( Figure S5 K).

Section: Discussion

There has been a long-held view, mostly based on correlative data, that activated microglia in the TBI brain contribute to inflammatory pathology and sequalae secondary to the original insult. In the present study, we took advantage of previously developed genetic ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 48. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pharmacologic ( Elmore et al., 2014 13. Elmore, M.R. ∙ Najafi, A.R. ∙ Koike, M.A. ... Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor signaling is necessary for microglia viability, unmasking a microglia progenitor cell in the adult brain Neuron. 2014; 82 :380-397 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1264) PubMed Google Scholar ) tools to selectively remove these cells from the brain and to study their role during various stages of injury. In doing so, we were able to reveal a critical time window during which microglia can be manipulated to adopt a phenotype that drives repair. We also uncovered an important role for IL-6 trans -signaling in mediating the beneficial outcomes.
Microglia are highly motile cells that rapidly respond to the release of danger signals that follow neuronal damage ( Davalos et al., 2005 12. Davalos, D. ∙ Grutzendler, J. ∙ Yang, G. ... ATP mediates rapid microglial response to local brain injury in vivo Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 :752-758 Crossref Scopus (3017) PubMed Google Scholar ). Their presence has been considered essential for neuroprotection, debris clearance, and repair ( Neumann et al., 2009; Szalay et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2017 33. Jin, W.N. ∙ Shi, S.X. ∙ Li, Z. ... Depletion of microglia exacerbates postischemic inflammation and brain injury J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2017; 37 :2224-2236 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar 43.

Debris clearance by microglia: an essential link between degeneration and regeneration Brain. 2009; 132 :288-295 Crossref Scopus (855) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Szalay, G. ∙ Martinecz, B. ∙ Lénárt, N. ... Microglia protect against brain injury and their selective elimination dysregulates neuronal network activity after stroke Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11499 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Normal physiological roles for microglia in synapse formation during motor learning have also been reported ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 48. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ). Somewhat surprisingly, but consistent with previous studies in naive mice ( Dagher et al., 2015; Elmore et al., 2018 11. Dagher, N.N. ∙ Najafi, A.R. ∙ Kayala, K.M. ... Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition prevents microglial plaque association and improves cognition in 3xTg-AD mice J. Neuroinflammation. 2015; 12 :139 Crossref Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar 16. Elmore, M.R.P. ∙ Hohsfield, L.A. ∙ Kramár, E.A. ... Replacement of microglia in the aged brain reverses cognitive, synaptic, and neuronal deficits in mice Aging Cell. 2018; 17 :e12832 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ), we show that the absence of microglia in uninjured (sham-operated) animals on continuous PLX5622 treatment had no impact on spatial learning and memory in a range of hippocampus-dependent tasks. Similarly, although TBI mice exhibited severe cognitive deficits, the absence or presence of microglia had no bearing on these. In addition, no change in learning and memory abilities was observed when microglia were removed from the brain during the more chronic phase of injury, providing direct evidence that, contrary to popular belief, the presence of these cells in an activated state does not necessarily interfere with higher cognitive functions.
The neurogenic response to TBI might vary based on post-injury time and/or injury severity, but brain insults are mostly known to have disruptive effects on the production of new granule cells in the adult hippocampus ( Ngwenya and Danzer, 2019 44. Ngwenya, L.B. ∙ Danzer, S.C. Impact of traumatic brain injury on neurogenesis Front. Neurosci. 2019; 12 :1014 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data reveal that this primarily stems from poor survival of newly generated DCX pos neurons in the injured brain, rather than a deficit at the neural precursor level. Survival of newly generated neurons was not improved in the absence of microglia (i.e., with continuous PLX5622 treatment) indicating that, although in an activated state, these cells do not directly contribute to the death of newly generated DCX pos neurons in the injured brain. Significant neuroprotection could be achieved by ceasing PLX5622 treatment, but only if the emergence of repopulating microglia coincided with the acute phase of TBI. We corroborated these pharmacological findings in a genetic model (CX 3 CR1cre ERT2 x iDTR mice) that similarly allows for rapid and very targeted depletion and repopulation of microglia, thereby allaying any concerns that off-target activity of PLX5622 and/or CSF-1R antagonism itself might have contributed to the outcomes observed. Our experiments in DCX DTR mice further showed that augmented survival of newborn neurons directly contributed to improved spatial learning outcomes that persisted for many months after TBI. Although further studies are required to better understand how adult-born cells improve behavioral outcomes, these findings settle a long-standing debate as to whether neurogenesis in the injured mammalian brain is or can be functional. The timing of the observed effects is also entirely consistent with previous observations that adult-born neurons make synapses in the CA3 region as early as 2 weeks after their birth ( Gu et al., 2012 24. Gu, Y. ∙ Arruda-Carvalho, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Optical controlling reveals time-dependent roles for adult-born dentate granule cells. Nature Neuroscience. 2012; 15 :1700-1706 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, replenishing the resident microglial population prior to TBI did not confer any benefit. Thus, once turned over, repopulated brain microglia behave the same as their original counterparts, and there is thus no unique pro-regenerative phenotype associated with these cells per se. Similarly, when repopulating microglia were gated to re-emerge only during the post-acute phase of injury, the benefits in relation to survival of newly generated DCX pos neurons and associated behavioral outcomes were also not present. In other words, we find that the neuroprotective effects of repopulating microglia is highly dependent on proper timing, i.e., it must temporally coincide with the microenvironment of the acute but not post-acute phase of injury. The latter finding is analogous to observations in regenerating organisms like the axolotl and zebrafish where presence of pro-regenerative myeloid cells is also critically required during the acute but not post-acute phases of injury in order for successful organ and/or tissue repair to take place ( Godwin et al., 2013; Kyritsis et al., 2012 22. Godwin, J.W. ∙ Pinto, A.R. ∙ Rosenthal, N.A. Macrophages are required for adult salamander limb regeneration Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :9415-9420 Crossref Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar 37. Kyritsis, N. ∙ Kizil, C. ∙ Zocher, S. ... Acute inflammation initiates the regenerative response in the adult zebrafish brain Science. 2012; 338 :1353-1356 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, our findings therefore demonstrate that the brain’s resident microglial population does not actively inhibit endogenous repair processes, but rather lacks the ability to support these. A pro-neurogenic and/or neuroprotective microglial phenotype that actively supports brain repair can be induced through microglial turnover, as shown, but only if the active repopulation phase is made to coincide with the acute phase of TBI.
The emergence of repopulating neuroprotective microglia during the acute stage of TBI was hallmarked by several key transcriptional changes. Most strikingly, there was a profound transient upregulation of IL-6, and we identified hippocampal granule cells as being the major source of this. The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 has been ascribed both detrimental and beneficial roles in a range of neurological conditions ( Rothaug et al., 2016 53. Rothaug, M. ∙ Becker-Pauly, C. ∙ Rose-John, S. The role of interleukin-6 signaling in nervous tissue Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1863 :1218-1227 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ), including in the context of CNS injury ( Campbell et al., 2014; Codeluppi et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2012 8. Campbell, I.L. ∙ Erta, M. ∙ Lim, S.L. ... Trans-signaling is a dominant mechanism for the pathogenic actions of interleukin-6 in the brain J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :2503-2513 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar 10. Codeluppi, S. ∙ Fernandez-Zafra, T. ∙ Sandor, K. ... Interleukin-6 secretion by astrocytes is dynamically regulated by PI3K-mTOR-calcium signaling PLoS ONE. 2014; 9 :e92649 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar 66. Yang, P. ∙ Wen, H. ∙ Ou, S. ... IL-6 promotes regeneration and functional recovery after cortical spinal tract injury by reactivating intrinsic growth program of neurons and enhancing synapse formation Exp. Neurol. 2012; 236 :19-27 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore directly probed the significance of increased IL-6 expression with repopulating microglia through a range of pharmacological studies. This allowed us to show that IL-6 signaling is indeed critically required for both the behavioral improvements and augmented survival of neurons, including newly generated ones, under TBI conditions where repopulating microglia are present. We further provide direct mechanistic evidence that these benefits result from trans -signaling by soluble IL-6Rα/IL-6 complexes rather than the classical pathway. Although the repopulating microglia are critical for induction of IL-6 in granule cells, the specific signal remains to be determined, as do questions on whether this IL-6 acts in a para- and/or autocrine manner via gp130. Several lines of evidence already suggest that trans -signaling by soluble IL-6/IL-6Rα might directly protect neurons against excitotoxic cell death through restricting the Ca 2+ response to glutamate ( März et al.,1998; Ma et al., 2015; Timper et al., 2017 40.

IL-6 improves energy and glucose homeostasis in obesity via enhanced central IL-6 trans-signaling Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :267-280 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), induction of adenosine A1 receptor, anti-oxidants, and neurotrophic factor expression ( Biber et al., 2008 4. Biber, K. ∙ Pinto-Duarte, A. ∙ Wittendorp, M.C. ... Interleukin-6 upregulates neuronal adenosine A1 receptors: implications for neuromodulation and neuroprotection Neuropsychopharmacology. 2008; 33 :2237-2250 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such a mechanism might not only apply to CNS insult but also more broadly to physiological conditions in which microglia are known to positively modulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (e.g., voluntary exercise) and where IL-6 is known to be upregulated ( Nybo et al., 2002 45. Nybo, L. ∙ Nielsen, B. ∙ Pedersen, B.K. ... Interleukin-6 release from the human brain during prolonged exercise J. Physiol. 2002; 542 :991-995 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other obvious areas for further investigation would be whether IL-6 trans -signaling contributes to the unique transcriptional profile of the repopulating microglia themselves, and also whether it plays a role in astrocyte polarization by suppressing the less favorable A1 phenotype ( Liddelow et al., 2017 39. Liddelow, S.A. ∙ Guttenplan, K.A. ∙ Clarke, L.E. ... Neurotoxic reactive astrocytes are induced by activated microglia Nature. 2017; 541 :481-487 Crossref Scopus (4711) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We conclude that the presence of activated microglia in brain regions adversely affected by insult does not necessarily have a negative bearing on outcomes and/or cognitive dysfunction. Rather, in the post-insult brain, activated microglia seem to mostly lack the ability to support endogenous repair processes. A pro-regenerative microglia phenotype can be induced, however, in the mammalian brain and, as for regenerating organisms like the axolotl and zebrafish ( Godwin et al., 2013 22. Godwin, J.W. ∙ Pinto, A.R. ∙ Rosenthal, N.A. Macrophages are required for adult salamander limb regeneration Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :9415-9420 Crossref Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar ), inflammatory signals play a key role in this. We already uncovered a critical role for IL-6 signaling in association with this beneficial phenotype, and future studies can now focus on further defining how the unique phenotypic signature of repopulating microglia can be taken advantage of therapeutically.

Three-month-old female C57BL/6J mice, CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR, CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato, DCX DTR , DCX creERT2 x tdTomato, Vav-Cre x IL-6Ra flox/flox and Scl-Cre ERT2 x ZsGreen flox/flox mice were used in this study. Mouse colonies were bred and maintained in a University of Queensland Biological Resources’ specific pathogen-free ‘behind barrier’ facility. Mice were housed socially (3-5 mice per cage) on a 12-h light/dark cycle in individually ventilated cages, and with ad libitum access to food and water. The experimental holding room had temperature (21.5°C set point) and humidity control (40% set point), and was supplied with HEPA-filtered air. Littermates of the same gender were otherwise randomly assigned to experimental groups. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Australian Code for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, with approval from The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee.
CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR and CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato mice were 3–4 weeks of age when orally gavaged with tamoxifen (12.5 mg/g body weight (BW)) or corn oil once daily for 5 days. For CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR mice and CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato mice, exposure to tamoxifen induces CX 3 CR1-positive (CX 3 CR1 pos ) cells to express diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). Because microglia are self-renewing and have a slow turnover rate compared with that of CX 3 CR1 pos monocytes, only microglia continue to express DTR after several weeks ( Parkhurst et al., 2013 48. Parkhurst, C.N. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Ninan, I. ... Microglia promote learning-dependent synapse formation through brain-derived neurotrophic factor Cell. 2013; 155 :1596-1609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1842) PubMed Google Scholar ). After the fifth and final treatment with tamoxifen or corn oil, mice were left to rest for at least 6 weeks. After this rest period, microglia were selectively depleted by administration of diphtheria toxin (DT; 30 ng/g BW; Sigma) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection or intra-hippocampal injection (detailed below). For microglial depletion, DT was injected once daily for 3 days prior to injury; for subacute delayed microglial repopulation, DT was injected once daily at 4, 5, and 6 days after injury; for microglial turnover prior to TBI, DT was injected daily at minus 9, 8, and 7 days before surgery, with injury as detailed below.
For PLX5622 microglial depletion and repopulation, mice were placed on a chow diet with PLX5622 incorporated at 1200 ppm (provided by Plexxikon via Research Diets). Control chow mice received standard mouse chow (Research Diets). PLX5622 was used under the permissions of a material transfer agreement from Plexxikon, USA.
Mice were subjected to either moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) or sham surgery, as previously described ( Wang et al., 2016 62. Wang, X. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Michalski, S. ... Traumatic brain injury severity affects neurogenesis in adult mouse hippocampus J. Neurotrauma. 2016; 33 :721-733 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 0.01 mg/g BW tiletamine/zolazepam (Zoletil) and 0.01 mg/g BW xylazine, administered via i.p. injection, and placed into a stereotaxic frame. Using sterile procedures, a midline incision was made, the skin retracted, and a 4-mm craniotomy performed at a point midway between the lambda and bregma sutures, and laterally midway between the central suture and temporalis muscle. The skull cap was carefully removed, taking care to not damage the underlying leptomeninges. The tip of the 3-mm impactor piston was angled and kept perpendicular to the exposed cortical surface. The parameters for the CCI were: impact speed, 3.5 m/s; deformation depth, 1.0 mm; duration, 400 ms. After CCI, the incision was sutured, and the mice allowed to recover on a heat pad to maintain core body temperature at 36–37°C. Shortly after injury, mice were subcutaneously injected with Hartmann’s solution containing buprenorphine (Temgesic, 0.05%). Sham mice underwent the same surgical operation but without CCI.
To assess hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory, mice were tested in the active place avoidance (APA) task, as previously described ( Willis et al., 2017 64. Willis, E.F. ∙ Bartlett, P.F. ∙ Vukovic, J. Protocol for short- and longer-term spatial learning and memory in mice Front. Behav. Neurosci. 2017; 11 :197 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the APA testing first involved daily handling of the mice after surgery prior to behavioral testing, followed by habituation of the mice to the rotating (clockwise, 1rpm) APA testing arena for 20min, during which time the mice could freely explore with the shock zone turned off. The APA testing arena consisted of an elevated arena with a grid metal floor, fenced by a 32cm-high clear Perspex circular boundary, with black and white A3 size visual cues placed on the 4 surrounding walls. One day after habituation, mice were tested in the APA task, during which they were tasked to avoid a 60° shock zone, the position of which did not move in relation to the room coordinates. Mice were tracked by an overhead camera linked to Tracker software (Bio-Signal Group), with entry of the mice into the shock zone leading to the delivery of a brief foot shock (0.5mA, 500ms, 60 Hz, 1.5 s intervals). The mouse’s starting position was always opposite the shock zone location. Each test trial was 20min, with 24h between each test. Reversal learning was conducted using the same spatial cues, but with the location of the shock zone moved to the opposite side of the arena. In-session acquisition of spatial learning was assessed by the number of entries into the shock zone during each 5 min interval of the 20min trial. Longer-term spatial learning and memory was assessed by the total number of entries or shock during each day, across 5 days of testing. The number of entries into the shock zone, the number of shocks received, and the distance traveled during the trial were analyzed using Track Analysis software (Bio-Signal Group).
Mice underwent testing in the Morris water maze starting at 12 days post-injury. The apparatus consisted of a circular swimming pool (100 cm in diameter, 20 cm high) filled with water (21–25°C), which was opaque due to the addition of non-toxic white paint. Mice were required to locate a submerged platform using the spatial cues located around the arena. For the first 5 days of testing, the platform was located within the north-east quadrant of the testing arena, hidden beneath 1.5 cm of opaque water. Each day, over four trials, mice were allowed 60 s to locate the hidden platform, with an inter-trial interval of 15 min. At the start of each trial the mouse was released from one of four starting positions (south, west, north or east), chosen in a pseudo-random order. If the mouse was unable to locate the platform within 60 s it was guided there, and allowed to remain on the platform for 10 s. The average latency to locating the platform over the four trials for each test day was recorded using Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technology, version 11.5.1022). On days 7 and 8, a reversal learning procedure was performed, with the platform being re-introduced into the testing arena in the south-west quadrant. During reversal learning, mice were again trained to find the platform over four 60 s trials, with 15-min inter-trial intervals.
As a further test of spatial learning and memory following traumatic brain injury (TBI), mice were also tested in the Y-maze task 30 days post-injury. The Y-maze apparatus was composed of two arms connected to a runway (home arm), each 45 × 15 × 15 cm. The arms contained different visual cues, consisting of black and white symbols/shapes on laminated A4 size paper. The maze was positioned 1 m above the ground, and the mice were tracked by an overhead camera. During training, the animals were placed in the home arm with access to only one arm for 3 min. This training arm was alternated for each mouse. Following a 20-min intermission, mice were placed back into the Y-maze for 3 min with access to the training and novel arms. The time spent in the novel and the training arms, as well as the distance traveled, were analyzed using Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technology, version 11.5.1022).
To label newborn or proliferating cells, mice were injected i.p. with either EdU (16.4 mg/kg, molecular weight: 252.22 g/mol, Santa Cruz) and/or BrdU (20 mg/kg, molecular weight: 307.1 g/mol, Sigma).
To genetically fate label newborn cells, we utilized DCXcre ERT2 x tdTomato mice, where tamoxifen exposure induces DCX pos cells to express the tdTomato fluorescent reporter. To label a cohort of DCX-positive (DCX pos ) immature neurons, DCXcre ERT2 x tdTomato mice were orally gavaged with tamoxifen (0.125mg/kg body weight) once daily for 2 days prior to surgery. To label a cohort of mature neurons, DCXcre ERT2 x tdTomato mice were orally gavaged with tamoxifen (0.125 mg/kg BW) once daily for 5 days, 6-weeks prior to surgery.
For ex vivo MRI scans, perfusion-fixed brains were kept inside the skull, but with the ventral side opened up to allow for optimal access of contrast agent (0.2% Magnevist [gadopentetate dimeglumine]; Bayer Healthcare) After 4 days of incubation at 4°C, samples were immersed in Fombulin (perfluoropolyether solution, Solvay Solexis, NJ) for high-resolution imaging using a Bruker 16.4T small animal MR imaging system with a vertical wide bore, equipped with a Micro2.5 gradient set and a 15mm linear saw coil (M2M imaging). High resolution T1/T2 imaging was performed using Paravision software (version 6.0.1) and a gradient echo fast low angle shot (FLASH) MRI sequence, with TR/TE = 40/10ms and a 30 degree flip angle. Images were acquired using a 20x12.7x9 mm field-of-view with 400x256x180 matrix to produce 180 slices with 50 μm slice resolution.
T1/T2 FLASH scans were masked using ITK-SNAP software to remove skull fragments, and brains mapped to the Australian Mouse Brain Mapping Consortium (AMBMC) template using FMRIB’s linear and nonlinear image registration tools: FLIRT and FNIRT. ITK-SNAP software was then used to manually check and correct regions of interest (i.e., cortex and hippocampus) to ensure ROI specificity following surgery, following which ROI volume measurements were determined.
Mice were euthanized using an i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbitone (1.6 mg/g BW), before being transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 4% formalin. Brains were dissected, placed in formalin for 24 h, followed by PBS with 0.01% sodium azide. Tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose with 0.05% sodium azide for 2 days. Free-floating serial brain sections (40 μm) were collected using a sliding microtome (Leica).
Brain sections were blocked in 5% normal goat serum (NGS) with 0.3% Triton X-100, before being incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in 3% NGS with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS: rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000; Wako), guinea pig anti-DCX (1:1000; Merck), rat anti-BrdU (1:500; Abcam), rabbit anti-Tbr2 (1:400; Millipore), rabbit anti-TMEM119 (1:500; Abcam), mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000; Millipore), mouse anti-IL-6 (1:500, Abcam), rat anti-complement 3 (1:500; Clone 11H9, Hycult Biotech). Sections were washed in PBS before being incubated with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit 568 (1:2000), Alexa Fluor anti-guinea pig 488 (1:1000), AlexaFluor goat anti-rabbit 647 (1:1000), AlexaFluor goat anti-rat 647 (1:1000), AlexaFluor goat anti-rabbit 488 (1:1000), AlexaFluor AffiniPure Fab Fragment Donkey Anti-Rat 488 (1:1000) diluted in 3% NGS with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Sections were washed in PBS, then mounted with Vectashield H-100 medium containing DAPI (1:1000). EdU staining was performed using Click-iT Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). For BrdU staining, a prior antigen retrieval step was performed, involving incubation in 1M HCl for 35 minutes at 45°C and 10min incubation in 0.1M boric acid at room temperature.
Four consecutive sections of the dentate gyrus, located at Bregma −1.50mm, −1.70 mm, −1.94 mm, −2.18mm, were counted per mouse. Cell counts were performed live using StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightfield Bioscience) using an AxioImager Z2 microscope (Zeiss) and an ORCA-R2 digital charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu). DCX pos immature neurons were defined based on their large round cellular body with an apical projection within the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Cell numbers in the granule cell layer were divided by the analyzed length of the granule cell layer as visualized by DAPI. Cell numbers for the whole dentate gyrus were normalized to the area of the dentate gyrus, defined by the border of the hippocampal fissure and a line drawn touching the end of the blades of the dentate gyrus. The average from four consecutive serial sections was recorded.
Cresyl violet imaging was conducted using the Metafer Vslide Scanner (MetaSystems) with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2. Hippocampal volume changes were calculated by measuring the area in four sections at −1.50mm, −1.70 mm, −1.94 mm, and −2.18 mm relative to Bregma. The area was multiplied by the thickness of the sections (40 μm) to obtain a volume measurement. These volumes were added together to represent 16% of the total dorsal hippocampus.
Confocal images were acquired using an inverted Diskovery spinning disk confocal microscope (Spectral Applied Research) with a Zyla sCMOS camera at either 20x magnification using a CFI Plan Aprochromat VC 20x / N.A. 0.75 / W.D. 1.0mm objective, or at 60x magnification using a CFI Apo Lamda 60x Oil / N.A. 1.4 / W.D. 0.13mm objective.
Analysis of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for confocal images was conducted using Imaris software, with MFI values calculated from the average of four consecutive sections of the dentate gyrus, located at Bregma −1.50mm, −1.70 mm, −1.94 mm, −2.18mm per mouse. All tissue sections were stained within the one batch, with the same imaging threshold and exposure time to ensure maintained consistency for image analysis.
The pro-neurogenic and neuroprotective effects of repopulating microglia were independently validated in D.C.A.’s laboratory at the University of Oxford. All experimental procedures conducted here were approved by the relevant local ethics committees (LERP, ACER) and performed in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. In brief, 8-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (UK) and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week upon arrival. Next, experimental mice were fed either control or PLX5622-containing chow for 3 weeks and then switched back to a normal diet (see Figure S3 J). For TBI, mice were anaesthetised with Zoletil/Xylazine as detailed earlier and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Following excision of the scalp, a craniotomy was performed over the posterior parietal region of the brain. For TBI mice, cortical contusion was induced with the PCI3000 precision cortical impactor device (Hatteras Instruments), using a 3mm flat impactor tip to a speed of 3.5 m/s, a dwell time of 400 ms, and a deformation depth of 1.0mm; sham-operated controls underwent craniotomy surgery only. All mice were euthanized on day 12 post-surgery and transcardially perfused with heparinised saline followed by 4% formalin. Fixed brains were processed for histological staining followed by blinded quantitative assessment of hippocampal tissue volumes (cresyl violet) and DCX pos cell numbers as detailed earlier.
For all experiments listed below, and unless specified otherwise, intra-hippocampal injections were performed under stereotaxic guidance at the following co-ordinates: −2.0mm anterior-posterior, −1.5mm medial-lateral, −2.0mm dorso-ventral.
To deplete sensitized CX 3 CR1 pos microglia within the hippocampus of tamoxifen-gavaged CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR mice, a single unilateral injection of DT (Sigma; 0.1ng, 0.5ul injected over 5 minutes) was given as detailed above and in the experimental timelines (see figures).
To ablate DCX pos cells in DCX DTR mice, a single unilateral injection of 0.1 ng DT (0.5ul injected over 5 minutes) was delivered into the left hippocampus (i.e., ipsilateral to the site of CCI). For TBI mice, the injection was placed at a depth −1.7mm in the dorso-ventral plane.
To block IL-6R signaling within hippocampus after injury with microglial repopulation, tamoxifen-sensitized CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR mice received a single unilateral 1 μl injection (infused over 10 minutes) of MR16-1 (10 mg/mL) or control rat IgG (10 mg/mL; Sigma) on day 3 after CCI. MR16-1 was used as permitted under a material transfer agreement from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. (Japan).
To block IL-6 trans -signaling within the hippocampus after injury with microglial repopulation, tamoxifen-sensitized CX 3 CR1 CreERT2 x iDTR mice received a single unilateral injection of sgp130FC (2ug, 1ul over 10 minutes), or saline (1ul) as the vehicle control, on day 3 after CCI.
To stimulate IL-6 or IL-6 trans -signaling, wild-type C57BL6J mice with TBI received a single unilateral injection (infused over 10 minutes) of either recombinant mouse IL-6 (500ng, 1ul), or Hyper-IL-6 (200ng, 1ul) ( Fischer et al., 1997 18. Fischer, M. ∙ Goldschmitt, J. ∙ Peschel, C. ... I. A bioactive designer cytokine for human hematopoietic progenitor cell expansion Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15 :142-145 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ), on day 3 after CCI; vehicle controls received saline (1ul) injections.
Mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital before being euthanized using a transcardial perfusion of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The ipsilateral hippocampi were snap-frozen using isopentane (Sigma) on dry ice. Total RNA was extracted from hippocampal tissue by Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermFisher Scientific), with RNA quality assessed by the NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Total RNA was converted to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). Real-time qPCRs were conducted using Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR systems. Relative target gene expression to geometric mean of the reference gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( Hprt ) was determined by the formula: 2 -ΔCT , where ΔCT = CT (target gene) – CT (Hprt) . Changes in gene expression are presented as fold changes compared to gene expression in sham controls. Probe sets were tested over a serial cDNA concentration for amplification efficiency. The SYBR-Green primers used are listed in Table S1 .
Microglia were isolated from the hippocampus of CX 3 CR 1 creERT2 x iDTR x tdTomato mice 3 days after CCI as previously described ( Vukovic et al., 2012 60. Vukovic, J. ∙ Colditz, M.J. ∙ Blackmore, D.G. ... Microglia modulate hippocampal neural precursor activity in response to exercise and aging J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :6435-6443 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital before being euthanized using a transcardial perfusion of 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4), their brains immediately removed and the ipsilateral hippocampus dissected out. Tissue was digested in 0.1% papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 0.1% DNaseI (Roche Australia) in HBSS (Thermo Scientific) for 16 min at 37°C, triturating half-way through the incubation period. Next, cells were centrifuged at 1100 prm for 10 minutes, then filtered into single cell suspension through a 40um cell sieve (Falcon, BD Biosciences), and resuspended in 2mL of DMEM F12 (GIBCO, Life Technologies), 2% BSA (Invitrogen) and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin (Thermo Fischer).
Hippocampal dissociated single cells were sorted using a Cytopeia Influx Cell Sorter (BD Bioscience), with on average 67,000 (resident) and 25,000 (repopulating) tdTomato pos microglia per sample (n = 3 per group). Each sample was directly sorted into 300ul of cell lysis buffer (Zymo Research) and total RNA was immediately isolated using the Quick-RNA MiniPrep kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Zymo Research); RNA quality was analyzed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit (illumina, 20020598) and TruSeq RNA Single Indexes (illumina, 20020492/20020493), according to the standard manufacturer’s protocol (illumina, document # 1000000040499 v00, Oct 2017) described briefly as follows. To enrich for mRNA, 27-100 ng of total RNA was depleted of rRNA using Ribo-Zero Gold. The enriched mRNA was then subjected to a heat fragmentation step aimed at producing fragments between 120-210 bp (average 155 bp). cDNA was synthesized from the fragmented RNA using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18064014) and random primers. The resulting cDNA was converted into dsDNA in the presence of dUTP to prevent subsequent amplification of the second strand and thus maintaining the ‘strandedness’ of the library. Following 3′ adenylation and adaptor ligation, libraries were subjected to 15 cycles of PCR to produce libraries ready for sequencing. The libraries were quantified on the Perkin Elmer LabChip GX Touch with the DNA High Sensitivity Reagent kit (Perkin Elmer, CLS760672). Libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios, and the pool was quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit - illumina/Universal (KAPA Biosystems, KK4824) in combination with the Life Technologies Viia 7 real time PCR instrument.
Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq500 (NextSeq control software v2.2.0 / Real Time Analysis v2.4.11). The library pool was diluted and denatured according to the standard NextSeq protocol (Document # 15048776 v05) and sequenced to generate single-end 76 bp reads using a 75 cycle NextSeq500/550 High Output reagent Kit v2.5 (illumina, 20024906). After sequencing, fastq files were generated using bcl2fastq2 (v2.18.0). There were three replicates per experimental condition.
All sequence reads were trimmed for adaptor sequences using Cutadapt (version 1.11) ( Martin, 2011 41. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. journal. 2011; 17 http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200/479 Crossref Google Scholar ) and aligned using STAR (version 2.5.2a) ( Dobin et al., 2013 15. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner. Bioinformatics. 2013; Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the Mus musculus GRCm38 assembly with the gene, transcript, and exon features of the Ensembl (release 70) gene model. Quality control metrics were computed using RNA-SeQC (version 1.1.8) ( DeLuca et al., 2012 14. DeLuca, D.S. ∙ Levin, J.Z. ∙ Sivachenko, A. ... RNA-SeQC: RNA-seq metrics for quality control and process optimization. Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :1530-1532 Crossref Scopus (574) PubMed Google Scholar ) and expression was estimated using RSEM (version 1.2.30) ( Li and Dewey, 2011 38. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. LRSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome. BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 Crossref Scopus (13966) Google Scholar ).
Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed using the R package edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 52. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data. Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26704) PubMed Google Scholar ). Note that the inputs for DE analysis are the filtered but not normalized read counts, since edgeR performs normalization (library size and RNA composition) internally. The glmFit() function was used to fit a negative binomial generalized log-linear model to the read counts for each gene. Using the glmLRT() function, we conducted gene-wise likelihood ratio tests for a given contrast. Pathway analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed using Ingenuity software.
To label and fate-track peripheral immune cells derived from the bone marrow, we utilized Scl-Cre ERT2 x ZsGreen flox/flox mice to permanently induce reporter gene expression in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and their progeny ( Göthert et al., 2005 23. Göthert, J.R. ∙ Gustin, S.E. ∙ Hall, M.A. ... In vivo fate-tracing studies using the Scl stem cell enhancer: embryonic hematopoietic stem cells significantly contribute to adult hematopoiesis Blood. 2005; 105 :2724-2732 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were gavaged with tamoxifen (0.125 mg/kg BW) once daily for 5 days, 4-weeks prior to surgery.
Brain samples (n = 3 per condition) were snap-frozen using the isopentane and dry ice procedure, before being embedded into Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) blocks. Samples were cut using Leica Cryostat and 10μm thick sections were collected onto library preparation (LP) glass slides, that were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin for 10 min, followed by 1-minute incubation in Bluing Buffer and counterstaining with Eosin for 3 min at room temperature. H&E images were captured using Zeiss Axio Imager at 20x Magnification. ST sequencing libraries were prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions, with pre-permeabalisation and permeabalisation performed with 20 and 7 min incubations in collagenase and trypsin, respectively. On-slide cDNA synthesis, tissue removal, probe cleavage, and library preparation were performed as per the manual. High-quality sequencing libraries were obtained from 107-698 ng and with the average length at 660-780 bp.
ST libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Nextseq500, using a 150 cycles kit with read configuration as read 1 (26 bp) and read 2 (124 bp). Raw sequencing data in BCL format were converted to FASTQ reads using bcl2fastq/2.17. Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome GRCm38 using STAR-2.7.1a and gene annotation GRCm38.96.gtf. We obtained 46-72 million high-quality, uniquely mapped reads for the six libraries. On average, each ST spot had 528-3345 genes detected, with maximum genes per spot ranging from 3482-9526 genes. Gene-count matrices were generated using an ST pipeline; ST spot coordinates were adjusted using st_spot_detector with inputs from the H&E images and Cy3 images. The dentate gyrus and hippocampus regions were identified on H&E images. Gene expression per spot in the selected regions was plotted on tissue images using Python scripts available in our stlearn github repository.
Investigator blinding to experimental conditions was applied and all statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism software (version 7.02). Statistical differences were determined using either an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA or repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, as appropriate. For all ANOVAs, a Greenhouse-Geisser correction and Bonferroni post hoc comparison were used. The value of n reported within figure legends represents number of animals, with appropriateness of sample sizes for key results confirmed by power analysis, where power = 0.8 and p < 0.05. There is no missing data nor were any animals removed post hoc. Values are represented as mean ± SEM, with differences considered significant when p < 0.05. Asterisks denote corresponding statistical significance: ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001.
