Title: Genomic Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong Province, China


Abstract: Summary

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was first reported in central China in December 2019. Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China’s most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA-positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province’s large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased.

Section: Introduction

A new virus-associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was initially reported in China on 30 th December 2019 ( Wu et al., 2020 29. Wu, F. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Yu, B. ... A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China Nature. 2020; 579 :265-269 Crossref Scopus (7689) PubMed Google Scholar ). The causative agent of COVID-19 is the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 ( Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020 29. Wu, F. ∙ Zhao, S. ∙ Yu, B. ... A new coronavirus associated with human respiratory disease in China Nature. 2020; 579 :265-269 Crossref Scopus (7689) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14565) PubMed Google Scholar ), and, as of 24 th March 2020, there have been 372,757 confirmed infections and 16,231 deaths reported worldwide ( World Health Organization, 2020 28. World Health Organization Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports 2020 https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports Google Scholar ). In China, the COVID-19 epidemic grew exponentially during January 2020, peaking on 12 th February 2020 with 15,153 newly confirmed cases per day. One month later, reported COVID-19 cases in China dropped to ~20 per day, indicating the epidemic there was contained. However, the number of cases reported outside of China has risen exponentially since the second half of February 2020. By 11 th March 2020, the day that the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 to be a new pandemic, 37,371 cases had been reported outside of China ( World Health Organization, 2020 28. World Health Organization Coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) situation reports 2020 https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports Google Scholar ).
Guangdong Province and the Pearl River Delta Metropolitan Region contain some of the world’s largest and most densely populated urban areas. Guangdong is the most populous province of China (113 m people) and contains many large cities including Guangzhou (12 m), Shenzhen (10 m), Dongguan (8 m), and Foshan (7 m). The province has strong transportation links to Hubei Province, where the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. The Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway has been estimated to transfer 0.1–0.2 million passengers per day during the spring festival period, which started on 10 th January 2020. By 19 th March 2020, Guangdong had 1,388 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the highest in China outside of Hubei Province.
Understanding the evolution and transmission patterns of a virus after it enters a new population is crucial for designing effective strategies for disease control and prevention ( Faria et al., 2018; Grubaugh et al., 2017; Ladner et al., 2019 2. Faria, N.R. ∙ Kraemer, M.U.G. ∙ Hill, S.C. ... Genomic and epidemiological monitoring of yellow fever virus transmission potential Science. 2018; 361 :894-899 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar 5.

Ladner, J.T. ∙ Grubaugh, N.D. ∙ Pybus, O.G. ... Precision epidemiology for infectious disease control Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :206-211 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we combine genetic and epidemiological data to investigate the genetic diversity, evolution, and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong Province. We generated virus genome sequences from 53 patients in Guangdong using both metagenomic sequencing and multiplex PCR amplification followed by nanopore sequencing. Through phylogenetic analysis, interpreted in the context of available epidemiological information, we sought to investigate the timing and relative contributions of imported cases versus local transmission, the nature of genetically distinct transmission chains within Guangdong, and how the emergency response in Guangdong was reflected in the reduction and elimination of these transmission chains. Our results may provide valuable information for implementing and interpreting genomic surveillance of COVID-19 in other regions.

Section: Results

Enhanced surveillance was launched in all clinics in Guangdong province following the first reports of patients with undiagnosed pneumonia on 30 th December 2019. Initially, screening and sampling for SARS-CoV-2 was targeted toward patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and those who had a history of travel in the 14 days before the date of symptom onset. The first detected case in Guangdong had symptom onset on 1 st January and was reported on 19 th January 2020 ( Kang et al., 2020 10. Kang, M. ∙ Wu, Jie ∙ Ma, Wenjun ... Evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 medRxiv. 2020; Published online February 17, 2020 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). COVID-19 cases in Guangdong grew until early February 2020 (peaking at >100 cases per day) and declined thereafter ( Figure 1 A). After 22 nd February 2020, the daily number of locally infected reported cases in Guangdong did not exceed one. However, since the beginning of March 2020 COVID-19 cases imported into Guangdong from abroad have been detected with increasing frequency. As of 26 th March 2020, a total of 102 imported cases were reported from 19 different countries ( Figure 1 A), highlighting the risk that local COVID-19 transmission could reignite in China.
Different surveillance strategies were applied during the epidemic in Guangdong ( Figure 1 A; STAR Methods ). More intensive surveillance was initiated on 30 th January 2020 in response to the Spring Festival period, which results in greater mobility among regions and provinces in China ( Kraemer et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020 13. Kraemer, M.U. ∙ Yang, C.-H. ∙ Gutierrez, B., Open COVID-19 Data Working Group ... The effect of human mobility and control measures on the COVID-19 epidemic in China Science. 2020; eabb4218 PubMed Google Scholar 27. Tian, H. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... An investigation of transmission control measures during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in China Science. 2020; eabb6105 Crossref Scopus (1309) PubMed Google Scholar ) and because asymptomatic COVID-19 cases had been reported ( Guan et al., 2020 6. Guan, W.J. ∙ Ni, Z.Y. ∙ Hu, Y. ..., China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19 Clinical Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; Published online February 28, 2020 Crossref Scopus (20474) Google Scholar ). This included monitoring (1) all travelers returning from Hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity, (2) their close contacts, and (3) all hospitalized patients in clinics, including those without fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Approximately 1.35 million samples were screened by six third-party institutions between 30 th January and 15 th March 2020. Surveillance commenced at Guangdong airports in early March, following the growth of COVID-19 outbreaks outside of China. In total, ~1.6 million tests were performed by 19 th March 2020, identifying 1,388 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in 20 of 21 prefectures in Guangdong Province ( Figure 1 B). Around a quarter of cases (336) were judged to be linked to local transmission and two-thirds (1,014) had a likely exposure history in Hubei (see STAR Methods ). For locally infected cases, 181 (53%) were linked to transmission among household members. More than half of the reported cases (60%) were from the cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou ( Figure 1 B). We note that the number of detected cases will be less than the true number of infections, although the degree of under-reporting is unknown. Surveillance was targeted toward travelers, hence these data may overestimate the proportion of travel-associated cases.
To understand the genetic structure of the COVID-19 outbreak in Guangdong, we generated near-complete and partial genomes from 53 COVID-19 patients in Guangdong Province. The genomes were generated by a combination of metagenomic sequencing and multiplex PCR amplification followed by nanopore sequencing on a MinION device (see STAR Methods ). Sequence sampling dates ranged from 30 th January to 28 th February 2020 ( Figure S1 ).
Sequencing was performed on 79 clinical samples (throat swabs, n = 32; anal swabs, n = 24; nasopharyngeal swabs, n = 10; sputum, n = 13) collected from 62 patients with varying disease symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to very severe (see STAR Methods ). Real-time reverse transcription PCR Ct (cycle threshold) values of these samples ranged from 19 to 40.86. Figure 2 A displays the Ct values for the 53 samples with >50% genome coverage for which we report whole and partial genome sequences (see Figure S2 for details of all 79 samples). When Ct values are <30, sequence reads covered ~90% or more of the reference genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) irrespective of the amplification and sequencing approach used (see STAR Methods ). However, genome coverage declined for samples with Ct >30 ( Figure S2 ). Using a Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test we found an association between sample Ct values and sample type ( Figure 2 B; p < 0.001), and sample Ct values and disease severity ( Figure 2 C; p = 0.03) (see also Liu et al., 2020 19. Liu, Y. ∙ Yan, L.M. ∙ Wan, L. ... Viral dynamics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19 Lancet Infect Dis. 2020; Published online March 19, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1195) Google Scholar ), however, we note that sampling was not undertaken with these hypotheses in mind.
Sequences generated with nanopore sequencing indicate common regions of low coverage ( Figure 2 D), indicating that the version 1 primer set used here did not amplify some regions efficiently. Efficient primer binding may have been prevented due to genetic divergence from the reference genome (MN908947.3). An alternative explanation is the interaction between two particular primers, resulting in primer dimer formation ( Itokawa et al., 2020 9. Itokawa, K. ∙ Sekizuka, T. ∙ Hashino, M. ... A proposal of an alternative primer for the ARTIC Network’s multiplex PCR to improve coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). After completion of this study, the primers have been redesigned to address these issues and improve coverage ( Quick 2020 21. Quick, J. Artic-ncov2019 primer schemes 2020 https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/tree/master/primer_schemes/nCoV-2019/V3 Google Scholar ). Shared and unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed at 97 sites across the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Figures 2 D and 2E), with 77 SNPs present in only one genome. Three SNPs were present in >10 genomes: (C8782T, C21711T, and T28144C). When compared to 49 previously released genomes from Hubei and Guangdong, 118 SNPs are present in only one genome and these three SNPs are still the only variants shared among >10 genomes ( Data S1 ).
To understand the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Guangdong, we performed phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian molecular clock approaches. We added our new virus genomes from Guangdong to 177 publicly available sequences, which includes 73 sequences from China, 17 of which were previously reported Guangdong genomes. The final alignment comprised 250 sequences and increased the number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from China by ~60% when our data were submitted to GISAID (on 9 th March).
The estimated maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny is shown in Figure 3 A. The SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Guangdong (red) are interspersed with viral lineages sampled from other Chinese provinces and other countries (gray). This pattern agrees with the epidemiological time series in Figure 1 A, indicating that most detected cases were linked to travel rather than local community transmission. Despite this, there were a number of instances where sequences from Guangdong appeared to cluster together, sometimes with sequences sampled from other regions. To explore these lineages in more detail, we performed a Bayesian molecular clock analysis that places the phylogenetic history of the genomes on an estimated timescale. A summary visualization of the maximum clade credibility tree from that analysis is shown in Figure 3 B and is largely congruent with the ML tree. The current low genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide means that most internal nodes have very low posterior probabilities; we caution that no conclusions should be drawn from these branching events as they will be informed by the phylogenetic prior distribution rather than variable nucleotide sites ( Figure 3 A). Nevertheless, five clusters (denoted A–E) containing Guangdong sequences had posterior probability support of >80% (i.e., their sequences grouped monophyletically in >80% of trees in the posterior sample; Figure 3 B). These clusters were also observed in the ML phylogeny ( Figure 3 A). Some included only sequences sampled in Guangdong (A, B), others included sequences sampled in other countries and provinces (C, D, E).
From the molecular clock analysis, we were able to estimate the times of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of clusters A–E. We found that SARS-CoV-2 lineages were imported multiple times into Guangdong during the second half of January 2020 ( Figure 4 ). Three clusters (C, D, E) have earlier tMRCAs that coincide with the start of the Guangdong epidemic and two (A, B) have later tMRCAs, around the time of the epidemic peak in the province ( Figure 4 ). The average time between the tMRCA and the earliest sequence collection date in each cluster was approximately 10.25 days. The observed duration of each phylogenetic cluster (tMRCA to most recently sampled sequence) ranged from 9.49 (cluster B) to 45.2 (cluster D) days. The clusters with earlier tMRCAs contain more sequences from travelers sampled outside of China, possibly reflecting a decrease in air passenger travel from Guangdong after January 2020 ( Flightradar24, 2020 4. Flightradar24 Air traffic at China’s busiest airports down 80% since the beginning of the year 2020 https://www.flightradar24.com/blog/air-traffic-at-chinas-busiest-airports-down-80-since-the-beginning-of-the-year/ Google Scholar ). The median tMRCA estimate of the COVID-19 pandemic was 1 st December 2019 (95% HPD 15 th November to 13 th December 2019; Figure 4 ), consistent with previous analyses ( Rambaut, 2020 23. Rambaut, A. Phylodynamic Analysis, 176 genomes 2020 http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176-genomes-6-mar-2020/356 Google Scholar ).
The apparent clusters of Guangdong sequences require careful interpretation because of the relative undersampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other Chinese provinces, including Hubei. Specifically, it is known that undersampling of regions with high incidence can lead to phylogenetic analyses underestimating the number of introductions into recipient locations and overestimating the size and duration of transmission chains in those recipient locations ( Grubaugh et al., 2017; Kraemer et al., 2018 5. Grubaugh, N.D. ∙ Ladner, J.T. ∙ Kraemer, M.U.G. ... Genomic epidemiology reveals multiple introductions of Zika virus into the United States Nature. 2017; 546 :401-405 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar 12. Kraemer, M.U.G. ∙ Cummings, D.A.T. ∙ Funk, S. ... Reconstruction and prediction of viral disease epidemics Epidemiol. Infect. 2018; Nov 5 :1-7 Google Scholar ). For example, the largest Guangdong phylogenetic cluster (denoted A in Figures 3 and 4 ) comprises 8 sequences, none of which are placed at the root of the cluster, and it is tempting to conclude that the entire cluster derived from community transmission within Guangdong. However, 6 of the 8 genomes reported travel from Hubei and therefore the cluster in fact represents multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions into Guangdong, with dates of symptom onset around or shortly after the shutdown of travel from Wuhan ( Figure 4 ).

Section: Discussion

Our analyses of the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Guangdong province indicate that, following the first COVID-19 case detected in early January, most infections were the result of virus importation from elsewhere, and that chains of local transmission were limited in size and duration. This suggests that the large-scale surveillance and intervention measures implemented in Guangdong were effective in interrupting community transmission in a densely populated urban region, ultimately containing the epidemic and limiting the potential for dissemination to other regions ( Leung et al., 2020 16. Leung, K. ∙ Wu, J.T. ∙ Liu, D. ... First-wave COVID-19 transmissibility and severity in China outside Hubei after control measures, and second-wave scenario planning: a modelling impact assessment Lancet. 2020; Published online April 8, 2020 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (565) Google Scholar ). However, vigilance is still required as there remains a risk that SARS-CoV-2 transmission could reignite in Guangdong following the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases imported to China from other countries.
The results also suggest that analyses of phylogenetic structure during the early phase of the pandemic should be interpreted carefully. The number of mutations that define phylogenetic lineages are small (often one), and may be similar to the number of sequence differences arising from errors introduced during reverse transcription, PCR amplification, or sequencing. Bayesian estimates of divergence times ( Rannala and Yang, 1996 25. Rannala, B. ∙ Yang, Z. Probability distribution of molecular evolutionary trees: a new method of phylogenetic inference J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43 :304-311 Crossref Scopus (1493) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as the tMRCA of the pandemic, are based on aggregate numbers of mutations and informed by dense sampling through time, and are thus expected to be more robust. Further, the low and variable sampling of COVID-19 cases among different regions makes it challenging to evaluate phylogenetic clusters that comprise cases from a single region; although such clusters could indeed represent local transmission, our results show they can also include multiple introductions from a genomically undersampled location. Therefore, as with all phylogenetic analyses, the SARS-CoV-2 genomes must be interpreted in the context of all available epidemiological information.

This study was approved by ethics committee of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province. Written consent was obtained from patients or their guardian(s) when samples were collected. Patients were informed about the surveillance before providing written consent, and data directly related to disease control were collected and anonymized for analysis.
After reports of hospitalized cases with undiagnosed, severe pneumonia on December 30 th 2019, enhanced surveillance was initiated in Guangdong Province to detect suspected infections, especially among cases with recent travel history to Hubei or other epidemic regions over the last 14 days. Suspected COVID-19 cases were screened by 31 designated hospitals, local CDCs in 21 prefecture cities, and 6 third-party detection institutions with commercial real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits (see below for further details). A subset of positive samples was sent to Guangdong Provincial CDC for verification and further sequencing (see below for further details). Imported infections were defined when confirmed cases had travel history from Hubei or other epidemic regions and did not have close contact with local positive cases in 14 days preceding illness onset. The severity of the disease was classified into mild, moderate, severe, or critical (see below for further details). Further details of clinical case definitions are provided in STAR Methods . Demographic information, date of illness onset, and clinical outcomes of sequenced cases were collected from medical records. The exposure history for each case was obtained through an interview. Information regarding the demographic and geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 cases can be found at the website of Health Commission of Guangdong Province ( http://wsjkw.gd.gov.cn/xxgzbdfk/yqtb/ ).
The surveillance scheme in Guangdong included 3 main components: a Twenty-one prefecture CDCs and 31 designated hospitals. These are responsible for the suspected cases diagnoses launched on 30 th December 2019. A suspected case was defined if he/she met one of the following criteria: (i) epidemic history and (ii) fever or respiratory symptoms (see below for further details). Epidemic history included: (i) a history of travel to Wuhan or a person who lived in Wuhan or another region where sustained local transmission existed in the 14 days prior to symptom onset; (ii) contact with a patient with fever/respiratory symptoms from Wuhan or another region where sustained local transmission existed in the 14 days prior to symptom onset; (iii) originated from a cluster of COVID-19 cases or is epidemiologically linked to other COVID-19 cases. As of 15 th March, 1152 cases were identified through local CDCs and hospitals. b Six third-party detection institutions. More intense surveillance was initiated on 30th January 2020 in response to the Spring Festival period. This included monitoring (i) all healthy travelers returning from Hubei or other regions with high epidemic activity, (ii) their close contacts, and (iii) all hospitalized patients in clinics, including those without fever or respiratory symptoms, regardless of their exposure history. Approximately 1.35 million samples were screened by six third-party institutions between 30th January and 15th March 2020 and 199 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified from travelers from Hubei without clinical symptoms (76 in 316,214 or 0.02%), fever clinics (99 in 475,949 or 0.02%), non-fever clinics (3 in 447,702) and their close contacts (14 in 70,509 or 0.02%). c Airport enhanced surveillance. Surveillance commenced at Guangdong airports on 9 th March. As of 15 th , 3 positive cases were identified from 7,909 diagnoses in Guangzhou Baiyun Airport and a total of 92 imported COVID-19 cases were confirmed as of 26 th March.
We collected 58 samples for sequencing from 44 patients (some patients were sampled more than once) in four sentinel hospitals in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan (Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital, 9 samples from 9 patients, collected on 30 th January 2020; Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital, 33 samples from 19 patients, collected between 31 st January and 9 th January 2020; The Third People’s Hospital of Shenzhen, 11 samples from 11 patients, collected on 5 th February 2020; Foshan First People’s Hospital, 5 samples from 5 patients, collected between 10 th February and 12 th February 2020). These cities recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases ( Figure 1 B). We collected a further 21 samples from 18 patients from a screening project of hospitalized COVID-19 cases in Guangdong, which was launched on 28 th February. We therefore attempted sequencing on 79 samples from 62 patients ( Table S1.1 ). Because this study focuses on epidemiological questions, we retained only one sequence per patient (the highest quality sequence) and we retained only genomes with > 50% coverage (our quality threshold). This resulted in a final total of 53 genomes.
Cases were diagnosed and the severity status was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, and critical according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for Covid-19 released by the National Health Commission of China (Version 7).
The clinical symptoms were mild, and there was no sign of pneumonia on imaging.

Virus genomes were generated by two different approaches, (i) untargeted metagenomic sequencing on the BGI MGISEQ-2000 (n = 63) and Illumina NextSeq (n = 4) sequencing platforms, and (ii) using version 1 of the ARTIC COVID-19 multiplex PCR primers ( https://artic.network/ncov-2019 ), followed by nanopore sequencing on an ONT MinION (n = 45). Untargeted metagenomic sequencing was initially attempted as it is well suited to the characterization of a previously unknown virus. Subsequently, a protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 using multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing was made available, which showed good performance on samples with higher Ct values (as described below and in Table S1.3 ). Thereafter, most clinical samples were sequenced using this latter approach. We report only those genomes for which we were able to generate > 50% genome coverage, and report only one genome per patient.
For metatranscriptomics, total RNAs were extracted from different types of samples by using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, followed by DNase treatment and purification with TURBO DNase and Agencourt RNAClean XP beads. Both the concentration and the quality of all isolated RNA samples were measured and checked with the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 and Qubit. For Illumina sequencing, libraries were prepared using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (according to the manufacturer’s protocol starting with 10 ng total RNA. Briefly, purified RNA was first fragmented and converted to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. The ribosome cDNA was depleted by using ZapRv2 (mammalian-specific). The remaining cDNA was converted to double stranded DNA and subjected to end-repair, A-tailing, and adaptor ligation. The constructed libraries were amplified using 9-16 PCR cycles. Sequencing of metatranscriptome libraries was conducted on the Illumina NextSeq 550 SE 75 platform. For BGI sequencing, DNA-depleted and purified RNA was used to construct the single-stranded circular DNA library with MGIEasy RNA Library preparation reagent set following manufacturer’s protocol. Finally, 60fmol of PCR products were Unique Dual Indexed (UDI), circularized, and amplified by rolling circle replication (RCR) to generate DNA nanoball (DNBs)-based libraries. DNBs preps of clinical samples were sequenced on the MGISEQ-2000 platform.
For the multiplex PCR approach, we followed the general method of multiplex PCR as described in ( https://artic.network/ncov-2019 ) ( Quick et al., 2017 22. Quick, J. ∙ Grubaugh, N.D. ∙ Pullan, S.T. ... Multiplex PCR method for MinION and Illumina sequencing of Zika and other virus genomes directly from clinical samples Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1261-1276 Crossref Scopus (629) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the multiplex PCR was performed with two pooled primer mixture and the cDNA reverse transcribed with random primers was used as a template. After 35 rounds of amplification, the PCR products were collected and quantified, followed with end-repairing and barcoding ligation. Around 50 fmol of final library DNA was loaded onto the MinION. The nanopore sequencing platform takes less than 24 hours to obtain 10Gb of sequencing data, achieving between 0.3–0.6 million reads per sample. The ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for COVID ( https://artic.network/ncov-2019 ) was used to generate consensus sequences and call single nucleotide changes relative to the reference sequence. SNP differences were sometimes observed when the same sample was sequenced using different sequencing approaches. These differences were random and not platform specific and, upon close inspection of the reads, most likely resulted from low coverage regions in the metagenomics data. Only the single highest-quality genome was retained per patient.
To test the precision and threshold of the multiplex PCR and nanopore sequencing method, we undertook a serial dilution experiment. Viral RNA was extracted from a cell strain of SARS-CoV-2. To mimic clinical samples with different viral loads, we diluted this viral RNA with SARS-CoV-2-negative RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Viral loads were estimated using RT-PCR with serial diluted plasmid as a standard. At each dilution level we performed multiplex PCR and nanopore sequencing and assembly as per the approach above, except that reads were assembled against the consensus genome obtained from the original sample using metagenomic sequencing. As expected, relative virus load, % genome coverage, and average read depth decreased at higher dilutions. Genome coverage exceeded 75% for all except the final dilution ( Table S1.3 ).
Reference-based assembly of the metagenomic raw data was performed as follows. Illumina adaptors were removed, and reads were filtered for quality (q30 threshold and read length > 15nt) using Cutadapt 1.18 ( Martin, 2011 20. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ). The mapping of cleaned reads was performed against GenBank reference strain MN908947.3 using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 15. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (32278) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consensus sequences were generated using samtools 1.2 ( Li et al., 2009 18. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (37488) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sites were called at depth > = 3 if they matched the reference strain, or depth > = 5 if they differed from the reference, otherwise sites were denoted N. Ambiguity nucleotide codes were used if (i) the minor variant is observed at > 30% frequency and (ii) the minor variant is represented by 5 or more reads. Assembly of the nanopore raw data was performed using the ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline for COVID-19 with minimap2 ( Li, 2018 17. Li, H. Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3094-3100 Crossref Scopus (5131) PubMed Google Scholar ) and medaka ( https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka ) for consensus sequence generation. For patient samples that were sequenced using both metagenomics and nanopore sequencing, we retained only the sequence with the highest genome coverage.
All available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n = 323) on GISAID ( gisaid.org ) on 13 th March 2020 were downloaded. Sequences from GISAID that were error-rich, those which represented multiple sequences from the same patient, and those without a date of sampling were removed. Finally, the dataset was reduced by only retaining the earliest and most recently sampled sequences from epidemiologically linked outbreaks (e.g., the Diamond Princess cruise ship). The resulting dataset of 250 sequences therefore represents the global diversity of the virus while minimizing the impact of sampling bias. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.4 ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 11. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Crossref Scopus (27151) PubMed Google Scholar ) and manually inspected in Geneious v11.0.3 ( https://www.geneious.com ). The final alignment length was 29,923 nucleotides.
We used both the maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian coalescent methods to explore the phylogenetic structure of SARS-CoV-2. The ML phylogeny was estimated with PhyML ( Guindon et al., 2010 7. Guindon, S. ∙ Dufayard, J.F. ∙ Lefort, V. ... New algorithms and methods to estimate maximum-likelihood phylogenies: assessing the performance of PhyML 3.0 Syst. Biol. 2010; 59 :307-321 Crossref Scopus (13229) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the HKY+⌈ 4 substitution model ( Hasegawa et al., 1985 8. Hasegawa, M. ∙ Kishino, H. ∙ Yano, T. Dating of the human-ape splitting by a molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA J. Mol. Evol. 1985; 22 :160-174 Crossref Scopus (7077) PubMed Google Scholar ) with gamma-distributed rate variation ( Yang, 1994 30. Yang, Z. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation from DNA sequences with variable rates over sites: approximate methods J. Mol. Evol. 1994; 39 :306-314 Crossref Scopus (2209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic distance against sampling date indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolve in clock-like manner ( r = 0.592) ( Figure S3 ). The Bayesian coalescent tree analysis was undertaken with BEAST v1.10.4 ( Ayres et al., 2012; Suchard et al., 2018 1. Ayres, D.L. ∙ Darling, A. ∙ Zwickl, D.J. ... BEAGLE: an application programming interface and high-performance computing library for statistical phylogenetics Syst. Biol. 2012; 61 :170-173 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar 26. Suchard, M.A. ∙ Lemey, P. ∙ Baele, G. ... Bayesian phylogenetic and phylodynamic data integration using BEAST 1.10 Virus Evol. 2018; 4 :vey016 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), also using the HKY+⌈ 4 substitution model with gamma-distributed rate variation with an exponential population growth tree prior and a strict molecular clock, under a non-informative continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) reference prior ( Ferreira and Suchard 2008 3. Ferreira, M.A. ∙ Suchard, M.A. Bayesian analysis of elapsed times in continuous-time Markov chains Can. J. Stat. 2008; 36 :355-368 Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar ). Taxon sets were defined and used to estimate the posterior probability of monophyly and the posterior distribution of the tMRCA of observed phylogenetic clusters A-E ( Table S1.2 ). Two independent chains were run for 100 million states and parameters and trees were sampled every 10,000 states. Upon completion, chains were combined using LogCombiner after removing 10% of states as burn-in and convergence was assessed with Tracer ( Rambaut et al., 2018 24. Rambaut, A. ∙ Drummond, A.J. ∙ Xie, D. ... Posterior Summarization in Bayesian Phylogenetics Using Tracer 1.7 Syst. Biol. 2018; 67 :901-904 Crossref Scopus (6136) PubMed Google Scholar ). The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred from the Bayesian posterior tree distribution using TreeAnnotator, and visualized with figtreejs-react ( https://github.com/jtmccr1/figtreejs-react ). Monophyly and tMRCA (time to the most recent common ancestor) statistics were calculated for each taxon set from the posterior tree distribution.
