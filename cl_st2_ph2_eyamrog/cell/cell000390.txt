Title: The deep population history of northern East Asia from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene


Abstract: Summary

Northern East Asia was inhabited by modern humans as early as 40 thousand years ago (ka), as demonstrated by the Tianyuan individual. Using genome-wide data obtained from 25 individuals dated to 33.6–3.4 ka from the Amur region, we show that Tianyuan-related ancestry was widespread in northern East Asia before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). At the close of the LGM stadial, the earliest northern East Asian appeared in the Amur region, and this population is basal to ancient northern East Asians. Human populations in the Amur region have maintained genetic continuity from 14 ka, and these early inhabitants represent the closest East Asian source known for Ancient Paleo-Siberians. We also observed that EDAR V370A was likely to have been elevated to high frequency after the LGM, suggesting the possible timing for its selection. This study provides a deep look into the population dynamics of northern East Asia.

Section: Introduction

Anatomically and behaviorally modern humans were present in northern East Asia as early as 40 thousand years ago (ka) ( Shang et al., 2007 81. Shang, H. ∙ Tong, H. ∙ Zhang, S. ... An early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, Zhoukoudian, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :6573-6578 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). The non-static definition of northern East Asia ( Li and Cribb, 2014 37. Li, N. ∙ Cribb, R. Historical Atlas of Northeast Asia, 1590-2010: Korea, Manchuria, Mongolia, Eastern Siberia Columbia University Press, 2014 Google Scholar ) includes the Mongolian plateau, northern China ( Li et al., 2015 39. Li, S. ∙ Yang, S. ∙ Liu, X. Spatiotemporal variability of extreme precipitation in north and south of the Qinling-Huaihe region and influencing factors during 1960–2013 Prog. Geogr. 2015; 34 :354-363 Google Scholar ), the Japanese archipelago, the Korean peninsula, and the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East, all of which fall within a similar latitude range as that of central and southern Europe. In Europe, human population movements and size were influenced by Ice Age climatic fluctuations ( Fu et al., 2016 17. Fu, Q. ∙ Posth, C. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... The genetic history of Ice Age Europe Nature. 2016; 534 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tallavaara et al., 2015 87. Tallavaara, M. ∙ Luoto, M. ∙ Korhonen, N. ... Human population dynamics in Europe over the Last Glacial Maximum Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :8232-8237 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ); e.g., the population size varied (ranging from 130,000–410,000) between 30 and 13 ka ( Tallavaara et al., 2015 87. Tallavaara, M. ∙ Luoto, M. ∙ Korhonen, N. ... Human population dynamics in Europe over the Last Glacial Maximum Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :8232-8237 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). These climatic oscillations may have had a similar effect on the population history of high-latitude and high-elevation regions in Asia, as evidenced by archaeological finds that suggest gaps in human occupation in Mongolia during marine isotope stages 3 (beginning ∼57 ka) and 2 (beginning ∼29 ka) ( Rybin et al., 2016 78. Rybin, E.P. ∙ Khatsenovich, A.M. ∙ Gunchinsuren, B. ... The impact of the LGM on the development of the Upper Paleolithic in Mongolia Quat. Int. 2016; 425 :69-87 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ). Although several studies have advanced our understanding of ancient East Asians from 9 ka to historical times ( Ning et al., 2020 57. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021 91. Wang, C.-C. ∙ Yeh, H.-Y. ∙ Popov, A.N. ... Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia Nature. 2021; 591 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 93. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), only two human genomes earlier than the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; approximately 26.5–19 ka) ( Clark et al., 2009 7. Clark, P.U. ∙ Dyke, A.S. ∙ Shakun, J.D. ... The last glacial maximum Science. 2009; 325 :710-714 Crossref Scopus (2613) PubMed Google Scholar ) have been reported (∼40 ka from Tianyuan Cave in northern China; ∼34 ka from Salkhit in northeastern Mongolia) ( Devièse et al., 2019 10. Devièse, T. ∙ Massilani, D. ∙ Yi, S. ... Compound-specific radiocarbon dating and mitochondrial DNA analysis of the Pleistocene hominin from Salkhit Mongolia Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :274 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Massilani et al., 2020 47. Massilani, D. ∙ Skov, L. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... Denisovan ancestry and population history of early East Asians Science. 2020; 370 :579-583 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2017 92.

Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the population structure of northern East Asia before and after the LGM stadial is largely unknown, and the lack of human fossils dating to between 40–9 ka from this area hinders our understanding of this crucial period of human prehistory.

Section: Results and discussion

To examine deep population histories in northern East Asia, genome-wide genotype data were generated from 25 ancient humans from the Songnen Plain (Heilongjiang province, northeastern China) in the Amur region, associated with direct radiocarbon dates ranging from 33,590–3,420 calibrated years before present (cal BP). These individuals were recovered at construction sites without archaeological context or from eroded gullies and small valleys formed in alluvial deposits of the Songhua River and Nen River during summer rainy seasons. DNA was extracted from less than 100 mg of bone powder and used to construct single-stranded libraries that were enriched for human DNA using a panel of 1.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ( Fu et al., 2015 16. Fu, Q. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ∙ Moldovan, O.T. ... An early modern human from Romania with a recent Neanderthal ancestor Nature. 2015; 524 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ). Enriched libraries were sequenced, resulting in SNP panel coverage from 0.002–14.45× ( Table 1 ). All samples showed low levels of modern human contamination ( Table 1 ). Removing close relatives (defined as first- or second-degree relationships) ( Table S1 ) and individuals with less than 25,000 SNPs resulted in a final dataset of 20 unrelated individuals (two individuals with SNP coverage lower than 50,000 are denoted with the suffix “_LowCov”) ( Table 1 ). Our final samples were combined into five main chronological groups, with similar genomic profiles within each group treated as populations: (1) one upper Pleistocene individual from before the LGM (denoted AR33K; 34,324–32,360 cal BP; AR represents Amur region, followed by the approximate age in thousands of years [K]), (2) one upper Pleistocene individual dating to the end of the LGM (denoted AR19K; 19,587–19,175 cal BP), (3) two individuals dating to the period between 14,932 and 14,017 cal BP (denoted AR14K) at the end of the last glacial period, (4) four individuals from 12,735–10,302 cal BP (denoted AR13–10K), and (5) 12 individuals from 9,425–3,360 cal BP (denoted AR9.2K_o, ARpost9K (n = 9), AR7.3K_LowCov, and AR3.4K_LowCov) ( Figure 1 A; Figure S1 ; Table 1 ; Table S1 ).
Upper Pleistocene human population dynamics prior to the LGM stadial are largely unknown in East Asia because of limited fossil remains from this period ( Bae et al., 2017 5. Bae, C.J. ∙ Douka, K. ∙ Petraglia, M.D. On the origin of modern humans: Asian perspectives Science. 2017; 358 :eaai9067 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). To better understand the early settlement of modern humans in East Asia, especially northern East Asia, we investigated the genomic profile of the pre-LGM (33.6 ka) AR33K specimen, a female individual. We first surveyed how this AR33K individual related to other ancient and modern populations globally using outgroup- f 3 analysis ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, outgroup- f 3 results showed that AR33K and the 7,000-years-older Tianyuan individual share more genetic drift with each other than with all other tested populations ( Figures 1 C and 2 A). Symmetry tests using D statistics ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ) also show that AR33K and Tianyuan form a cluster relative to all other ancient and modern populations globally ( Figure S2 ), which is also supported by results from qpGraph ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 A) and the maximum-likelihood tree ( Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012 64. Pickrell, J.K. ∙ Pritchard, J.K. Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele frequency data PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002967 Crossref Scopus (1556) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 ). Additionally, these analyses placed AR33K and Tianyuan basal to all East Asians ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 ), and analyses for detecting archaic introgressions ( Peter, 2020 62. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) show that they exhibit an excess of Denisovan ancestry compared with younger populations ( Table S2 ), similar to that reported by Massilani et al. (2020) 47. Massilani, D. ∙ Skov, L. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... Denisovan ancestry and population history of early East Asians Science. 2020; 370 :579-583 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar . It has been shown previously that the Tianyuan individual shared more alleles with an ∼35,000-year-old individual from Belgium (GoyetQ116-1; Fu et al., 2016 17. Fu, Q. ∙ Posth, C. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... The genetic history of Ice Age Europe Nature. 2016; 534 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ) than with other contemporary western Eurasians and shared more alleles with modern Amazonian populations (i.e., Surui) than other Native Americans ( Yang et al., 2017 92. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-Year-Old Individual from Asia Provides Insight into Early Population Structure in Eurasia Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the high genetic similarity between AR33K and Tianyuan, we find that AR33K does not share the same genetic affinity as Tianyuan to GoyetQ116-1. Instead, AR33K presents a profile similar to other ancient East Asians, showing a trend of elevated GoyetQ116-1 ancestry compared with other ancient western Eurasians, but just at or below the cutoff for statistical significance (3 standard deviations from the mean). We find no evidence that AR33K shares more alleles with Surui than other Native Americans ( Table S3 ). Thus, a complex population structure may already have existed before the LGM stadial in northern East Asia.
AR33K (∼33 ka) is roughly contemporary with Salkhit (∼34 ka) from the Salkhit Valley (northeastern Mongolia) and located at a similar distance from Salkhit (∼1,159 km) ( Devièse et al., 2019 10. Devièse, T. ∙ Massilani, D. ∙ Yi, S. ... Compound-specific radiocarbon dating and mitochondrial DNA analysis of the Pleistocene hominin from Salkhit Mongolia Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :274 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Massilani et al., 2020 47. Massilani, D. ∙ Skov, L. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... Denisovan ancestry and population history of early East Asians Science. 2020; 370 :579-583 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and Tianyuan cave (∼1,114 km) ( Yang et al., 2017 92. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-Year-Old Individual from Asia Provides Insight into Early Population Structure in Eurasia Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :3202-3208.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Salkhit individual has been proposed recently as an admixture of Tianyuan-related (∼75%) and Yana-related (∼25%) ancestries ( Massilani et al., 2020 47. Massilani, D. ∙ Skov, L. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... Denisovan ancestry and population history of early East Asians Science. 2020; 370 :579-583 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to Tianyuan, Salkhit also shows a connection with GoyetQ116-1 ( Massilani et al., 2020 47. Massilani, D. ∙ Skov, L. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... Denisovan ancestry and population history of early East Asians Science. 2020; 370 :579-583 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, unlike Salkhit, AR33K does not possess more Yana-related ancestry than Tianyuan ( D (Salkhit, Tianyuan; Yana, Mbuti) > 0 [ Z = 7.55]; D (Tianyuan, AR33K; Yana, Mbuti) ∼0 [ Z = 1.88]). This probably indicates that Tianyuan-related ancestry was widespread before the LGM stadial in northern East Asia, geographically (from the North China Plain near present-day Beijing to the Salkhit Valley in northeastern Mongolia, and the Amur region of northeastern China) and temporally (from 40–33 ka). People with Tianyuan-related ancestry may have admixed with people of Yana-related ancestry in Mongolia while remaining isolated in the Amur region before the LGM.
The LGM stadial had a large effect on prehistoric population dynamics in Europe ( Fu et al., 2016 17. Fu, Q. ∙ Posth, C. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... The genetic history of Ice Age Europe Nature. 2016; 534 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tallavaara et al., 2015 87. Tallavaara, M. ∙ Luoto, M. ∙ Korhonen, N. ... Human population dynamics in Europe over the Last Glacial Maximum Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :8232-8237 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), however, little is known about how the profound climatic changes of this period affected populations in northern East Asia. Here we report genetic evidence from an East Asian individual who lived during the LGM (26.5–19 ka), AR19K, which is critical for understanding the population dynamics of northern East Asians at the end of this harsh period. We first assessed AR19K using principal component analysis (PCA) ( Figure 1 B) and outgroup- f 3 analyses ( Figure 1 C), showing that AR19K has more genetic affinities with later East Asians compared with the earlier East Asians. The AR33K and Tianyuan individuals share a specific genetic drift that is not shared by AR19K and younger East Asians, a relationship supported by qpGraph modeling ( Figure 3 A) and Treemix ( Figure S3 ). This specific drift is also reflected by D (Tianyuan, AR33K; AR19K/AR14K/AR13-10K/ARpost9K, Mbuti) ∼0 (−0.6 < Z < 1), D (AR19K/AR14K/AR13-10K/ARpost9K, Tianyuan; AR33K, Mbuti) < 0 (−11.1 < Z < −10.2), and D (AR19K/AR14K/AR13-10K/ARpost9K, AR33K; Tianyuan, Mbuti) < 0 (−11 < Z < −9.4) ( Figure S2 ). These observations may suggest that a population change in northern East Asia had already occurred at the end of the LGM, earlier than the recently proposed post-LGM population change demonstrated by a 16,900-year-old subadult female (Khaiyrgas-1) found in Khaiyrgas Cave in Yakutia (Russia) ( Kılınç et al., 2021 31. Kılınç, G.M. ∙ Kashuba, N. ∙ Koptekin, D. ... Human population dynamics and Yersinia pestis in ancient northeast Asia Sci. Adv. 2021; 7 :eabc4587 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). This proposed population change may have occurred even earlier in the LGM because genetic continuity between 22 ka and 18 ka has been noted in individuals from the Mal’ta and Afontova Gora sites farther west in Siberia ( Raghavan et al., 2014 71. Raghavan, M. ∙ Skoglund, P. ∙ Graf, K.E. ... Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans Nature. 2014; 505 :87-91 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional genetic and archaeological evidence during the LGM stadial in the Amur River Basin is needed to resolve the timing of the appearance of the lineage represented by AR19K and later individuals in this region.
It has been demonstrated recently that, by 8 ka at the latest, ancient coastal northern East Asian (aCNEA; including populations from the Chinese sites of Bianbian, Boshan, Xiaogao, and Xiaojingshan) and ancient coastal southern East Asian (aCSEA; including individuals from the Chinese sites of Qihe, Liangdao1, Liangdao2, Xitoucun, and Tanshishan) populations could already be separated into two distinct northern and southern genetic groups ( Yang et al., 2020 93. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that AR19K, along with the other newly sampled individuals reported here (from 14–6 ka), was genetically closer to aCNEA than to aCSEA (represented by Qihe) using D (aCNEA, Qihe; AR19K, Mbuti) ( Figure 2 B). The balanced D (AR19K, Qihe; aCNEA, Mbuti) for Xiaojingshan and Bianbian could be explained by their possessing relatively more aCSEA ancestry than other aCNEAs ( Table S3 ). Interestingly, AR19K is found to be basal to ancient northern East Asians younger than 14 ka in admixture graph modeling using qpGraph and Treemix ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 ). These results reveal the existence of a north-south separation as early as 19 ka, approximately 10,000 years earlier than observed previously ( Yang et al., 2020 93. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, ancient northern East Asians younger than 14 ka share less genetic drift with AR19K than AR14K ( Table S3 ), which is consistent with the basal position of AR19K for aCNEA. The analyses of AR19K, who lived toward the end of the LGM stadial, reveal this individual to be the earliest northern East Asian yet identified, thus having some degree of continuity with present-day northern East Asians and possessing a genetic ancestry distinct from that of the modern humans who occupied this region prior to the LGM (e.g., Tianyuan and AR33K).
Ancient DNA samples recovered from Neolithic forager/farmers at Devil’s Gate cave (DevilsCave_N) in Primorsky Krai, far eastern Russia and the Amur River Basin reveal that genetic continuity with modern populations existed in the Amur region since 8 ka ( Ning et al., 2020 57. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sikora et al., 2019 83. Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ... The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ; Siska et al., 2017 84. Siska, V. ∙ Jones, E.R. ∙ Jeon, S. ... Genome-wide data from two early Neolithic East Asian individuals dating to 7700 years ago Sci. Adv. 2017; 3 :e1601877 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, population dynamics in the Amur region are unclear before 8 ka. Our younger samples were clustered into four subgroups based on genetic affinity and time, including AR14K, AR13-10K, ARpost9K, and AR9.2K_o ( Figures 1 B and 1C). This increased sampling from a large temporal range after the LGM stadial allows a better resolution of population dynamics in the Amur region and surrounding areas. Overall, PCA ( Figure 1 B), outgroup- f 3 ( Figure 1 C), and ADMIXTURE ( Alexander et al., 2009 1. Alexander, D.H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Lange, K. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1655-1664 Crossref Scopus (5179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S4 ) analyses indicate that AR14K, AR13-10K, and ARpost9K are genetically closest to the DevilsCave_N population. This was validated because D statistics show that post-LGM Amur region populations share more alleles with DevilsCave_N relative to other ancient northern East Asians ( Figure 4 A), which is also supported by results from qpGraph and Treemix ( Figure 3 A; Figure S3 ). In addition, we observed a decrease in human background relatedness, as measured by short runs of homozygosity (ROHs) (4–8 cM) after 14 ka, which suggests an increasing local population size in the Amur region, probably because of the transition to sedentary farming (the “Neolithic transition”) ( Table S4 ; Bacci, 2017 4. Bacci, M.L. A concise history of world population John Wiley & Sons, 2017 Crossref Google Scholar ; Diamond and Bellwood, 2003 11. Diamond, J. ∙ Bellwood, P. Farmers and their languages: the first expansions Science. 2003; 300 :597-603 Crossref Scopus (638) PubMed Google Scholar ). One outlier population, AR9.2K_o, is genetically close to ancient populations in the Amur region after 14 ka. Interestingly, this individual also shares some genetic affinity with ancient Shandong populations ( Table S3 ), but this possible population interaction needs to be confirmed by further sampling. Our results demonstrate that the genetic continuity reported between modern inhabitants of the Amur River Basin and the Devil’s Gate cave population probably started as early as 14 ka, 6,000 years earlier than proposed previously ( Ning et al., 2020 57. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sikora et al., 2019 83. Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ...

Adv. 2017; 3 :e1601877 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with the archaeological record of the earliest appearance of pottery in the Amur region (∼15 ka) ( Wang et al., 2017 90. Wang, Y. ∙ Song, F. ∙ Zhu, J. ...

Neolithisation in the southern Lesser Khingan Mountains: lithic technologies and ecological adaptation Antiquity. 2019; 93 :1144-1160 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ). In addition, the great biological diversity of the Amur region enabled humans to adopt varied, rich subsistence strategies, including hunting, fishing, and animal husbandry, to support this genetic continuity ( Ning et al., 2020 57. Ning, C. ∙ Li, T. ∙ Wang, K. ... Ancient genomes from northern China suggest links between subsistence changes and human migration Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2700 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ).
An early human population defined as Ancient Paleo-Siberians (represented by the 10,000-year-old Kolyma individual from northeastern Siberia and the 14,000-year-old Ust-Kyakhta-3 or UKY specimen found near Lake Baikal in southern Siberia) have been proposed to have descended from Ancient North Eurasian (ANE)-related populations, mixing with newly arriving people carrying East Asian ancestry ( Sikora et al., 2019 83.

Paleolithic to Bronze Age Siberians Reveal Connections with First Americans and across Eurasia Cell. 2020; 181 :1232-1245.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ancient Paleo-Siberians have also been shown to be the closest relatives to Native American populations outside of the Americas and were associated with the spread of a microblade technology and post-LGM reduction of the Mammoth Steppe ecological community ( Pitulko and Nikolskiy, 2012 65.

Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ... The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the modeling of Ancient Paleo-Siberians as a two-way mixture of DevilsCave_N (representing East Asian ancestry) and AfontovaGora3 ( Fu et al., 2016 17. Fu, Q. ∙ Posth, C. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ... The genetic history of Ice Age Europe Nature. 2016; 534 :200-205 Crossref Scopus (596) PubMed Google Scholar ) (representing ANE ancestry) was unsuccessful for UKY (tail probability = 1.45E–03) or Kolyma (tail probability = 3.98E–08) ( Yu et al., 2020 95. Yu, H. ∙ Spyrou, M.A. ∙ Karapetian, M. ... Paleolithic to Bronze Age Siberians Reveal Connections with First Americans and across Eurasia Cell. 2020; 181 :1232-1245.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating East Asian populations that could have feasibly contributed to the Ancient Paleo-Siberians have not yet been identified. We explored the relationship between the northern East Asian samples older than 13,000 years (AR19K and AR14K) and Ancient Paleo-Siberians. Using qpAdm , we showed that both UKY and Kolyma could be successfully modeled as a mixture of AR19K/AR14K and USR1 ( Figure 3 B; Table S5 ). It was also demonstrated through qpGraph that the AR14K-related population could be the direct East Asian source for Ancient Paleo-Siberians ( Figure 3 A). This is consistent with D statistics that indicate that Ancient Paleo-Siberians were genetically closer to Amur region populations after 14 ka ( D (AR14K/AR13-10K/ARpost9K, AR19K; UKY, Mbuti) [2.5 < Z < 3.9]) than to other ancient northern East Asians (i.e., D (aCNEA, AR19K; UKY, Mbuti) [0.7 < Z < 1.4]) ( Table S3 ). We propose that Amur region ancestry after 14 ka is a better fit than DevilsCave_N ancestry for the East Asian component in Ancient Paleo-Siberians and, thus, that Amur region populations could have been at the forefront of interactions with ANE-related populations that likely contributed to Ancient Paleo-Siberians.

Ye, K. ∙ Gao, F. ∙ Wang, D. ... Dietary adaptation of FADS genes in Europe varied across time and geography Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2017; 1 :167 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ), the limited availability of ancient East Asian genomes has precluded similar research in East Asia. The data presented here, together with those from recently published ancient East Asian populations ( Yang et al., 2020 93. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ), provide a large temporal window from 40–6 ka (spanning the pre- and post-LGM periods) to understand the evolution of adaptive variants. One important adaptive variant for East Asians is the EDAR V370A mutation (frequency at 93.7% in Han Chinese in Beijing, China [CHB]; Auton et al., 2015 3. Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ∙ Durbin, R.M. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (10306) PubMed Google Scholar ), which has been demonstrated through genome-wide association studies to be associated with thicker hair shafts, more sweat glands, and shovel-shaped incisors ( Fujimoto et al., 2008 18. Fujimoto, A. ∙ Ohashi, J. ∙ Nishida, N. ... A replication study confirmed the EDAR gene to be a major contributor to population differentiation regarding head hair thickness in Asia Hum. Genet. 2008; 124 :179-185 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tan et al., 2013 88. Tan, J. ∙ Yang, Y. ∙ Tang, K. ... The adaptive variant EDARV370A is associated with straight hair in East Asians Hum. Genet. 2013; 132 :1187-1191 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the precise mechanism behind EDAR V370A selection is difficult to detect using evidence obtained only from modern genomes. Two selective mechanisms have been proposed: selection to increase vitamin D in breast milk in the low-UV environment around 20 ka or selection to modulate thermoregulatory sweating during a warm and humid climate around 30 ka ( Hlusko et al., 2018 25. Hlusko, L.J. ∙ Carlson, J.P. ∙ Chaplin, G. ... Environmental selection during the last ice age on the mother-to-infant transmission of vitamin D and fatty acids through breast milk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E4426-E4432 Crossref Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kamberov et al., 2013 30. Kamberov, Y.G. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Tan, J. ... Modeling recent human evolution in mice by expression of a selected EDAR variant Cell. 2013; 152 :691-702 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we show that mutation V370A in the EDAR gene appeared in all ancient East Asians (including AR19K), except for AR33K and Tianyuan, the only two individuals in our sample predating the LGM stadial in East Asia ( Figure 4 B; Table S6 ). This indicates that EDAR V370A was likely to be elevated to high frequency during or shortly after the LGM. These direct observations using ancient DNA make the hypothesis that EDAR V370A was under selection during a warm and humid environment less likely ( Kamberov et al., 2013 30. Kamberov, Y.G. ∙ Wang, S. ∙ Tan, J. ... Modeling recent human evolution in mice by expression of a selected EDAR variant Cell. 2013; 152 :691-702 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the allelic age of EDAR V370A has been estimated previously to be 11,400 years ago with a large confidence interval (4,300–43,700) using modern genomes ( Peter et al., 2012 63. Peter, B.M. ∙ Huerta-Sanchez, E. ∙ Nielsen, R. Distinguishing between selective sweeps from standing variation and from a de novo mutation PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1003011 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas our direct observation demonstrated that this allele emerged as early as ∼19 ka, as observed in the AR19K individual ( Figure 4 B), providing an older and more accurate upper boundary for the allelic age estimate.
In conclusion, our findings reveal the demographic changes that occurred over a long period in northern East Asia, including before the LGM stadial (∼33 ka) and after (from ∼19–6 ka). This temporal transect witnessed two major population shifts before 14 ka, followed by long-term genetic continuity in the Amur region. (1) Before the LGM, Tianyuan-related ancestry was widespread with no evidence of Yana-related ancestry in the Amur region. (2) At the close of the LGM (∼19 ka), Tianyuan-related ancestry was likely replaced by modern East Asian ancestry. Also, the earliest northern East Asian population, represented by AR19K, appeared in the Amur region during the last stage of the LGM and is basal to all ancient northern East Asians. (3) After 14 ka, populations in the Amur region maintained genetic continuity and are the closest East Asian source known for Ancient Paleo-Siberians, one branch of which represents the closest relative of Native American populations outside of the Americas. In addition to uncovering previously unknown population dynamics, our analyses provide the ancient DNA evidence to narrow the timing of the appearance of EDAR V370A , indicating that this genetic variant was likely elevated to high frequency during or shortly after the LGM.
Although this study presents a long time transect of ancient individuals from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene, some of the detailed population dynamics need to be verified through further sampling. First, we must collect more samples representing the LGM stadial to further elucidate the post-LGM population replacement we observed and adaptations to environmental shifts by northern East Asians. Second, we must collect additional samples dating to the period after 14 ka to verify possible population interactions between ancient populations in the Amur region and surrounding territories, such as coastal Shandong.

The Songnen Plain (45-48°N, 124-127°E) in southwest Heilongjiang Province, northeast China, includes the majority of the Amur region, located between the Daxing’an and Xiaoxing’an mountains, the Changbai Mountains and the Songliao watershed. The plain lies 120-300 m above sea level with a relative relief of 30-100 m. The Nen and Songhua Rivers flow to the west and south, forming widely distributed floodplains. The central plain is relatively low and flat, with numerous wetlands and both large and small lakes and ponds. Sediments are mainly formed by alluvial deposits of the Songhua and Nen Rivers. The present surface of the Songnen Plain is gently undulating, thus it is also called the Wavy Plain.
Geologically, the Songnen Plain is a depression, part of the Songliao fault depression zone. The southwestern part of the depression is still sinking, while the northeast is rising. Tertiary and Quaternary sediments have risen to form platforms and uplifted hills. The upper part of the stratigraphic profile in this area of the Songnen Plain consists of loess-like loam, and the lower part is a gravel layer. Black soil (chernozëm) is widely distributed on the surface, rendering the plain a fertile agricultural zone today.
The Songnen Plain currently has a hemiboreal humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dwa and Dwb), with little rain in winter but is not exceptionally dry, since seasonal moisture from the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea reaches the area. The northwestern Songnen Plain is cold and dry because the prevailing northwest wind blows from the arid Eurasian continental interior due to the high pressure cell (the Siberian Anticyclone) established over Siberia. Summers are hot and rainy as water vapor from the sea is carried inland by subtropical high pressure effects, forming precipitation. The vegetation is mainly shrub meadowland or mesophytic weed meadowland.
Due to the impacts of climate change and human activities, groundwater levels have dropped substantially during the past few decades. Surface runoff intensely erodes soft sediments during the summer rainy season, and ravines dissect many areas of the plain. The Songnen Plain is not only a fertile land, but also one of the earliest cattle management/domestication centers in the world ( Zhang et al., 2019 97. Zhang, H. ∙ Chang, F. ∙ Li, H. ... OSL and AMS 14 C Age of the Most Complete Mammoth Fossil Skeleton from Northeastern China and its Paleoclimate Significance Radiocarbon. 2019; 61 :347-358 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ). It is also extremely rich in fossils of both the Mammuthus-Coelodonta Fauna ( Zhang et al., 2019 97. Zhang, H. ∙ Chang, F. ∙ Li, H. ...

The vegetational and climatic changes of the last glacial-Early Holocene transition have been reconstructed in detail for the Amur region using high-resolution pollen analyses from Lake Sihailongwan in Jilin Province ( Mingram et al., 2018 52. Mingram, J. ∙ Stebich, M. ∙ Schettler, G. ... Millennial-scale East Asian monsoon variability of the last glacial deduced from annually laminated sediments from Lake Sihailongwan, NE China Quat. Sci.

Late Pleistocene spread of (cool-) temperate forests in Northeast China and climate changes synchronous with the North Atlantic region Global Planet. Change. 2009; 65 :56-70 Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar ). Between 16,700 and 14,450 cal BP, the Amur region exhibited predominantly steppe and open taiga-like woodland communities, with abundant Larix, Alnus fruticosa, Betula, Artemisia, grasses and sedges, representing cold and dry conditions. During the Early Holocene, dense deciduous forests, consisting mainly of thermophilic broadleaf trees, became widespread, indicating climatic amelioration. Between 12,680-11,650 cal BP, a short-term climatic reversal to colder and/or dryer conditions has been recorded. A decrease in broadleaved trees and the reappearance of Larix and Picea signals this climatic reversal, comparable to the Younger Dryas event in the circum-Atlantic region. In general, strong atmospheric coupling between the North Atlantic region and East Asia is supported by the synchronicity of climate changes ( Stebich et al., 2009 86. Stebich, M. ∙ Mingram, J. ∙ Han, J. ... Late Pleistocene spread of (cool-) temperate forests in Northeast China and climate changes synchronous with the North Atlantic region Global Planet.

Pottery appeared in the Amur region as early as 15 ka (e.g., at the Taoshan, Huayang and Houtaomuga sites) ( Wang and Sebillaud, 2019 89. Wang, L. ∙ Sebillaud, P.

World Prehist. 2019; 32 :73-110 Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar ). Functionally, pottery provided a new means of food storage and cooking and improved the efficiency of food processing. Socially, pottery facilitated feasting behavior and the transport of consumables, establishing and strengthening social networks ( Hayden and Villeneuve, 2011 23. Hayden, B. ∙ Villeneuve, S. A century of feasting studies Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 2011; 40 :433-449 Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar ; Pearson, 2005 61. Pearson, R. The social context of early pottery in the Lingnan region of south China Antiquity. 2005; 79 :819-828 Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar ). In the Amur region, isotope analyses of pottery found in the Houtaomuga (13-5 ka) ( Wang and Sebillaud, 2019 89. Wang, L. ∙ Sebillaud, P. The emergence of early pottery in East Asia: New discoveries and perspectives J. World Prehist. 2019; 32 :73-110 Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar ) and Shuangta sites (11-7.8 ka) ( Kunikita et al., 2017 34. Kunikita, D. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Onuki, S. ... Radiocarbon dating and dietary reconstruction of the Early Neolithic Houtaomuga and Shuangta sites in the Song-Nen Plain, Northeast China Quat. Int. 2017; 441 :62-68 Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar ) indicate that fishing was an important part of the subsistence strategy of local populations. The earliest archaeological occurrence of nephrite has been identified at the Xiaonanshan site, dating to ca. 9 ka ( Jiamusi Cultural Relics Management Station and Raohe County Cultural Relics Management Institute, 1996 28.

In this study, 25 human remains, ranging from 33,590 to 3,420 cal BP (calibrated years before present, relative to 1950 CE) were selected for ancient DNA testing. All samples included in this study are under the custodianship of the co-authors and were accessed with full permission from the relevant archaeological institutes or universities. The review board of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology approved the ancient genomes sampled in this project for study (Review No. 202006020007), following a protocol used in other ancient human genetic studies ( Ding et al., 2020 12. Ding, M. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Ko, A.M.-S. ... Ancient mitogenomes show plateau populations from last 5200 years partially contributed to present-day Tibetans Proc. Biol.

Samples were AMS radiocarbon ( 14 C) dated at Peking University in Beijing. The chemical preparation and physical measurement of bone samples were similar to the standard processes described by Zhang et al. (2019) 97. Zhang, H. ∙ Chang, F. ∙ Li, H. ... OSL and AMS 14 C Age of the Most Complete Mammoth Fossil Skeleton from Northeastern China and its Paleoclimate Significance Radiocarbon. 2019; 61 :347-358 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar . The resulting 14 C dates were calibrated using OxCal v4.4 ( Ramsey and Lee, 2013 72. Ramsey, C.B. ∙ Lee, S. Recent and planned developments of the program OxCal Radiocarbon. 2013; 55 :720-730 Crossref Google Scholar ) and the IntCal20 calibration curve ( Reimer et al., 2020 74. Reimer, P.J. ∙ Austin, W.E.N. ∙ Bard, E. ... The IntCal20 Northern Hemisphere radiocarbon age calibration curve (0–55 cal kBP) Radiocarbon. 2020; 62 :725-757 Crossref Scopus (3774) Google Scholar ). The origin sites of these samples are presented in Table 1 . Among them, specimens AR33K, AR9.2K_o, AR9.2K_deleted and AR8.3K were found on the southern bank of the Songhua River; the others were collected at Zhaodong, on the northern bank of the Songhua River. All were found at construction sites, or in eroded gullies and small valleys, especially during summer rainy seasons. Considering the ages and places of recovery of these specimens, we can see that 1) the oldest came from the Acheng District and east of Harbin on the south side of the Songhua River, where the elevation is relatively higher than surrounding areas; 2) most specimens came from the Zhaodong area on the northern Songhua River, especially the high plateau areas which are also very rich in non-human vertebrate fossils.
All human remains were processed in dedicated laboratories at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing and were subjected to DNA extraction, following established protocols, from less than 100 mg of bone ( Yang et al., 2017 92. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-Year-Old Individual from Asia Provides Insight into Early Population Structure in Eurasia Curr.

Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single-stranded libraries (denoted as “SS”) ( Gansauge and Meyer, 2013 20. Gansauge, M.-T. ∙ Meyer, M. Single-stranded DNA library preparation for the sequencing of ancient or damaged DNA Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :737-748 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kircher et al., 2012 32. Kircher, M. ∙ Sawyer, S. ∙ Meyer, M. Double indexing overcomes inaccuracies in multiplex sequencing on the Illumina platform Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :e3 Crossref Scopus (732) PubMed Google Scholar ) were prepared for all samples except two individuals (NE58 and NE57), which used a uracil-DNA glycosylase partially-treated double-stranded library protocol (denoted as “DS-half” in Table 1 ) ( Meyer and Kircher, 2010 50.

Partial uracil–DNA–glycosylase treatment for screening of ancient DNA Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370 :20130624 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then amplified libraries for 35 cycles using the AccuPrime Pfx polymerase to obtain enough ancient DNA for capture. The P5 and P7 primers were added last to avoid library contamination, and the amount of DNA extracted per sample was evaluated using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000 spectrometer.
We applied a DNA capture technique to enrich endogenous ancient DNA from the high levels of background environmental DNA ( Fu et al., 2013a 13. Fu, Q. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Gao, X. ... DNA analysis of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2223-2227 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 16.

Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe Nature. 2015; 522 :207-211 Crossref Scopus (1139) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), oligonucleotide probes synthesized from the complete human mitochondrial genome were used to capture human mtDNA ( Fu et al., 2013a 13. Fu, Q. ∙ Meyer, M. ∙ Gao, X. ... DNA analysis of an early modern human from Tianyuan Cave, China Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2223-2227 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ); oligonucleotide probes that targeted 1.2 million SNPs from Panels 1 and 2 ( Fu et al., 2015 16. Fu, Q. ∙ Hajdinjak, M. ∙ Moldovan, O.T. ... An early modern human from Romania with a recent Neanderthal ancestor Nature. 2015; 524 :216-219 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to capture human nuclear DNA. After enrichment, the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform was used to generate 2 × 76bp paired-end reads for mtDNA, and the Illumina Hiseq 4000 sequencing platform was used to generate 2 × 100bp and 2 × 150bp paired-end reads for the nuclear DNA.
We trimmed adapters and merged paired-end reads into a single sequence (minimum overlap of 11 base pairs) using leeHom software ( Renaud et al., 2014 75. Renaud, G. ∙ Stenzel, U. ∙ Kelso, J. leeHom: adaptor trimming and merging for Illumina sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e141 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), and only merged reads with a length of at least 30 bp were used. For read alignment, BWA (version 0.6.1) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 38. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (31658) PubMed Google Scholar ) was applied using the aln and samse commands with the arguments -n 0.01 and -l 16500. The mtDNA reads were aligned to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) ( Andrews et al., 1999 2. Andrews, R.M. ∙ Kubacka, I. ∙ Chinnery, P.F. ... Reanalysis and revision of the Cambridge reference sequence for human mitochondrial DNA Nat. Genet. 1999; 23 :147 Crossref Scopus (2694) PubMed Google Scholar ); Nuclear DNA reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 . Duplicate reads were identified (same orientation, start, and end positions) and removed. Reads with a minimum mapping quality score of 30 were kept for analysis.
Two criteria were used to evaluate contamination: 1. We used ContamMix software ( Fu et al., 2013b 14. Fu, Q. ∙ Mittnik, A. ∙ Johnson, P.L.F. ... A revised timescale for human evolution based on ancient mitochondrial genomes Curr. Biol. 2013; 23 :553-559 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (413) PubMed Google Scholar ) to estimate contamination rate by comparing mtDNA fragments with the consensus mitochondrial genome for our newly sampled individuals and 311 present-day world-wide sequences. To avoid counting damaged bases as contamination, the first and last five positions of the fragments were ignored during estimation. The libraries were treated as contaminated if over 3% of the fragments matched present-day sequences better than the consensus; 2. For males, we also used ANGSD software ( Korneliussen et al., 2014 33. Korneliussen, T.S. ∙ Albrechtsen, A. ∙ Nielsen, R. ANGSD: Analysis of Next Generation Sequencing Data BMC Bioinformatics. 2014; 15 :356 Crossref Scopus (1457) PubMed Google Scholar ) to estimate contamination rate, based on the fact that one copy of the X chromosome is found in males. The libraries were treated as contaminated if the estimated contamination rate was greater than 3%. During the variant calling, the first and last five positions of the fragments were ignored. For each SNP covered at least twice in an individual, we randomly sampled one sequence to determine a single allele for that individual in order to obtain pseudo-haploid genotypes. Afterward, individuals with a number of SNPs lower than 25,000 were removed. A total of 21 out of 25 individuals were retained for further analyses.
We used READ software ( Monroy Kuhn et al., 2018 53. Monroy Kuhn, J.M. ∙ Jakobsson, M. ∙ Günther, T. Estimating genetic kin relationships in prehistoric populations PLoS ONE. 2018; 13 :e0195491 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ) to estimate the degrees of kinship among our 21 newly sampled individuals from the Amur region. This tool carried out kinship analyses in three steps: 1. The genome was divided into non-overlapping windows of 1 mega base pairs (Mb). For each 1 Mb window, the proportion of non-matching alleles (P0) for each pair of individuals was estimated; 2. The average P0 was normalized by the median of all average pairwise P0 across all unrelated individuals. This normalization could reduce the effect of SNP ascertainment, population diversity, and potential batch effects; 3. The degrees of kinship were categorized (unrelated, first degree, second degree, or identical individuals/identical twins) using predefined cut-offs. All unrelated individuals were kept for subsequent analyses. For relatives (identical twins, first-degree and second-degree kin), only the one with the higher SNP number was kept for subsequent analyses. Following this analysis, we removed one individual with second-degree relationship with another, keeping the individual having the higher number of SNPs.
To further validate the kinship results from READ , we estimated the degree of kinship using lcMLkin ( Lipatov et al., 2015 41. Lipatov, M. ∙ Sanjeev, K. ∙ Patro, R. ... Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Biological Relatedness from Low Coverage Sequencing Data bioRxiv. 2015; 023374 Google Scholar ), which infers kinship using genotype likelihoods. The method takes into account the uncertainty in genotype calling when sequence coverage is low, which is especially suitable for ancient DNA samples. lcMLkin estimates k 0 , k 1 , k 2 as the probability that no, one or two alleles are shared by identical by descent (IBD) between the pair of individuals, respectively. The coefficient of relatedness (r) can then be calculated as r = k1/2 + k2 to infer the kinship category.
Principal components were calculated with 64 present-day populations from the Human Origin (HO) SNP Panel ( Table S1 ), together with 16 present-day Han and Tibetan populations from Lu et al. (2016) 45. Lu, D. ∙ Lou, H. ∙ Yuan, K. ... Ancestral Origins and Genetic History of Tibetan Highlanders Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2016; 99 :580-594 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar , utilizing the smartpca program in the EIGENSOFT package ( Patterson et al., 2006 59. Patterson, N. ∙ Price, A.L. ∙ Reich, D. Population structure and eigenanalysis PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e190 Crossref Scopus (3429) PubMed Google Scholar ). The parameters we adopted were default settings except for lsqproject: YES, numoutlieriter: 0, and shrinkmode: YES. Our newly sequenced ancient individuals ( Table 1 ) and the previously reported ancient Asians (Table S1) were then projected onto the principal components calculated using present-day populations.
Individual ancestries were estimated using a model-based maximum likelihood clustering algorithm with ADMIXTURE software ( Alexander et al., 2009 1. Alexander, D.H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Lange, K. Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1655-1664 Crossref Scopus (5179) PubMed Google Scholar ). The populations included in the analysis were the same as those in the PCA, except that Burmese was omitted and several present-day Russian populations were added ( Table S1 ). Prior to analysis, the genotypes for these populations were pruned for high linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.4) using PLINK (version v1.90) ( Purcell et al., 2007 69. Purcell, S. ∙ Neale, B. ∙ Todd-Brown, K. ... PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based linkage analyses Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81 :559-575 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22449) PubMed Google Scholar ), with parameters “–indep-pairwise 200 25 0.4.” This left 597,573 SNPs. The ADMIXTURE analysis was then carried out with K from 2 to 10. For each K, the analyses were run 100 times with different seeds to estimate the cross-validation (CV) error. The best K was determined by the lowest CV error.
We assessed the amount of shared genetic similarity between two individuals relative to an African outgroup population (Mbuti) using an outgroup- f 3 analysis ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this analysis, higher f 3 values indicate high genetic similarity. The pairwise outgroup- f 3 was performed for our newly sampled individuals, and several published ancient and present-day Asians ( Table S1 ), with qp3Pop (version 435) software in the AdmixTools package ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ). The pairwise f 3 results were then presented as a heatmap using R package gplots ( https://github.com/talgalili/gplots ).
We also assessed the genetic affinities among three individuals using D statistics ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the form of D (P1, P2; P3, Outgroup), where Outgroup is a population that is an outgroup to populations P1, P2, and P3. The D statistics were carried out for our newly sampled individuals, and several published ancient and present-day Asians, with qpDstat (version 755) software in the AdmixTools package ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We estimated historical relationships among populations, allowing both population splits and migration events using maximum-likelihood based software Treemix v1.13 ( Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012 64. Pickrell, J.K. ∙ Pritchard, J.K. Inference of population splits and mixtures from genome-wide allele frequency data PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002967 Crossref Scopus (1556) PubMed Google Scholar ). The samples included in the Treemix analysis were: AR33K, AR19K, AR14K, ARpost14K, AR13-10K, and ARpost9K (this study) and previously published populations (Mbuti, Ust’-Ishim, Yana, Tianyuan, Ikawazu, DevilsCave_N, Shamanka_EN, Yumin, Mongolia_N_East, Early Neolithic coastal northern East Asians (coastal_nEastAsia_EN) (including Bianbian, Boshan, Xiaogao, and Xiaojingshan), Early Neolithic coastal southern East Asians (sEastAsia_EN) (including Qihe, Liangdao1, and Liangdao2), Late Neolithic coastal southern East Asians (sEastAsia_LN) (including Suogang, Xitoucun, and Tanshishan), Kolyma, UKY, and West_Siberia_N; Table S1 ). The group names coastal_nEastAsia_EN, sEastAsia_EN, and sEastAsia_LN were previously defined in Yang et al. (2020) 93. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar . We set Mbuti as the root with (-root Mbuti) and accounted for linkage disequilibrium by grouping sites in blocks of 500 SNPs (-k 500). We allowed for up to five migration events (-m 1-7) and ran 1,000 bootstraps for each tree (-bootstrap –q). Those 1,000 bootstrap trees were then assessed in phylip using the consense command ( Baum, 1989 6. Baum, B.R. PHYLIP: Phylogeny Inference Package. Version 3.2. Joel Felsenstein Q. Rev. Biol. 1989; 64 :539-541 Crossref Google Scholar ), to count the number of times certain individuals grouped, relative to all others in the analysis. The inferred maximum-likelihood based trees and corresponding residuals were visualized with the in-build R script from Treemix v1.13.
We applied qpAdm (version 634) in the AdmixTools package ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ) to model ancestry proportions of Ancient Paleo-Siberians ( Sikora et al., 2019 83. Sikora, M. ∙ Pitulko, V.V. ∙ Sousa, V.C. ... The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene Nature. 2019; 570 :182-188 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2020 95. Yu, H. ∙ Spyrou, M.A. ∙ Karapetian, M. ... Paleolithic to Bronze Age Siberians Reveal Connections with First Americans and across Eurasia Cell. 2020; 181 :1232-1245.e20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) related to one, two, or three different sources. qpAdm models ancestry of target populations using a set of source populations (left populations) and a set of reference populations (right populations), without requiring the explicit description of the phylogenetic relationship among them. A “rotating” scheme of source and reference populations was used, being suggested as the best practice to search for the most optimal model ( Harney et al., 2021 22. Harney, É. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Reich, D. ... Assessing the performance of qpAdm: a statistical tool for studying population admixture Genetics. 2021; 217 :iyaa045 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we rotated populations from our set of source populations to a base set of reference populations to keep only one, two, or three populations as source populations, along with parameters “allsnps: YES”, “details: YES”, and “summary: YES”.
Our source populations included: AR19K, AR14K, Bianbian, Qihe, Liangdao2, AfontovaGora3, Malta1, and USR1. The “rotating” scheme could compete for the optimal sources, e.g., AR19K versus AR14K, and AfontovaGora3 versus USR1.
Our base set of reference populations, which must differ in their relationship to the target populations, included: Mota, UstIshim, Kostenki14, Iran_N, IndusPeriphery, LBK_EN, Motala12, Kotias, AR33K, Yana, and Karelia.
IndusPeriphery is a merged set of three individuals from two archaeological sites: Gonur Depe (Gonur2_BA) (∼4 ka), in the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex in Turkmenistan, and Shahr_I_Sokhta_BA2 and Shahr_I_Sokhta_BA3 (5-4 ka) from Shahr-i-Sokhta in Iran ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 56. Narasimhan, V.M. ∙ Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ... The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia Science. 2019; 365 :eaat7487 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We only considered a model with more source populations when one with fewer sources was rejected. The criteria used to reject a model with fewer sources were: 1. Tail probability of rank0 for a fewer source model > 0.05; 2. The estimated admixture proportions (±standard error) were between 0 and 1.
In addition, we applied qpAdm to model ancestry proportions of outlier population AR9.2K_o and merged outlier populations based on PCA and outgroup- f 3 analyses (denoted as AR_o, including AR9.2K_o, AR3.4K_LowCov, and AR7.3K_LowCov) related to one, two, or three different sources.
Our source populations included: AR19K, AR14K, Bianbian, Xiaojingshan, Qihe, Liangdao2.
Our base set of reference populations was the same as before, and included: Mota, UstIshim, Kostenki14, Iran_N, IndusPeriphery, LBK_EN, Motala12, Kotias, AR33K, Yana, and Karelia.
We followed a general approach for modeling admixture graphs using qpGraph (version 6065) in the AdmixTools package ( Patterson et al., 2012 60. Patterson, N. ∙ Moorjani, P. ∙ Luo, Y. ... Ancient admixture in human history Genetics. 2012; 192 :1065-1093 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ), which started with a basic and well-understood tree (including the central African Mbuti as an outgroup, the early western Eurasian Kostenki14, ancient North Siberian Yana, and early Asian Tianyuan). We then added extra populations (AR33K, GoyetQ116-1, Liangdao2, AR19K, AR14K, Bianbian, DevilsCave_N, AfontovaGora3, USR1, UKY, and Kolyma) one at a time in their best-fitting positions iteratively ( Yang et al., 2020 93. Yang, M.A. ∙ Fan, X. ∙ Sun, B. ... Ancient DNA indicates human population shifts and admixture in northern and southern China Science. 2020; 369 :282-288 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). An optimum tree model could be constructed based on the observed f -statistics ( f 2 , f 3 , and f 4 for all possible pairs of populations). A |Z|-score of less than 3 between the observed and expected values (determined by the Block Jackknife) was required. A small number (0.0001) was added to the diagonal entries of the estimated covariance matrix of the f-statistics ( Q matrix) to stabilizing the matrix inversion. The above and other parameters applied in the qpGraph program are as below, following recommendations of Lipson (2020) 42. Lipson, M. Applying f 4 -statistics and admixture graphs: Theory and examples Mol. Ecol.

Due to strong evidence (from outgroup- f 3 , D statistics, and Treemix analyses) that AR33K shares close genetic affinity with Tianyuan, we started with a model of AR33K forming a cluster with Tianyuan to reduce the searching space of initial modeling. Next, we added GoyetQ116-1, Liangdao2, AR19K, AR14K, Bianbian, DevilsCave_N, AfontovaGora3, USR1, UKY, and Kolyma iteratively, fitting as all possible nodes or admixture between nodes.
We inferred archaic (Neanderthal and Denisovan) introgressed segments in the genomes of our newly sampled individuals with SNP numbers over 330,000 (including AR33K, AR19K, AR14.5K, AR14.1K, AR10.6K, AR10.5K, AR8.9K, AR8.1K, AR7K, AR6.87K, and AR6.33K), Tianyuan ( Yang et al., 2017 92. Yang, M.A. ∙ Gao, X. ∙ Theunert, C. ... 40,000-Year-Old Individual from Asia Provides Insight into Early Population Structure in Eurasia Curr.

Mallick, S. ∙ Li, H. ∙ Lipson, M. ... The Simons Genome Diversity Project: 300 genomes from 142 diverse populations Nature. 2016; 538 :201-206 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 ), using admixfrog software ( Peter, 2020 62. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). This software adopts a Hidden Markov Model for local ancestry inference, and allows accurate detection of introgressed segments in low-coverage ancient genomes even with present-day human DNA contamination ( Peter, 2020 62. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We modeled the target individuals deriving their ancestries from three sources including two high-coverage Neanderthal genomes (NEA) ( Prüfer et al., 2014 67. Prüfer, K. ∙ Racimo, F. ∙ Patterson, N. ... The complete genome sequence of a Neanderthal from the Altai Mountains Nature. 2014; 505 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (1399) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017 68.

A high-coverage Neandertal genome from Vindija Cave in Croatia Science. 2017; 358 :655-658 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ), one high-coverage Denisovan genome ( Denisova 3 ) (DEN) ( Meyer et al., 2012 51. Meyer, M. ∙ Kircher, M. ∙ Gansauge, M.-T. ... A high-coverage genome sequence from an archaic Denisovan individual Science. 2012; 338 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (1257) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 44 genomes of present-day Sub-Saharan Africans from SGDP (AFR) ( Mallick et al., 2016 46.

The modeling included two steps: 1 The filtered BAM files for each of the target individual were converted into the input files for admixfrog. The command run is: a d m i x f r o g − b a m − b a m f i l e { i n d i v i d u a l } . b a m − l e n g t h − b i n − s i z e 3 5 − m i n m a p q 2 5 − d e a m − c u t o f f 3 − o u t { i n d i v i d u a l } . i n . x z − r e f { r e f _ a r c h a i c a d m i x t u r e . c s v . x z } In the above command, for each target individual, the BAM files were filtered to only include fragments of at least 35 base pairs (bp) and with a mapping quality > = 25 (–length-bin-size 35 –minmapq 25). Additionally, variant positions matching a C to T substitutions in the first three positions of the read, or a G to A substitutions at the end of a read were discarded (–deam-cutoff 3). 2 For inferring archaic introgressed segments using previously generated input files, the following command was run: a d m i x f r o g − i n f i l e { i n d i v i d u a l } . i n . x z − r e f { r e f _ a r c h a i c a d m i x t u r e . c s v . x z } − o u t { o u t _ i n d i v i d u a l } − s t a t e s A F R N E A D E N − c o n t − i d A F R − l l − t o l 0 . 0 1 − b i n − s i z e 5 0 0 0 − e s t − F − e s t − t a u − f r e q − F 3 − f r e q − c o n t a m i n a t i o n 3 − e 0 0 . 0 1 − a n c e s t r a l P A N − r u n − p e n a l t y 0 . 1 − m a x − i t e r 2 5 0 − n − p o s t − r e p l i c a t e s 2 0 0 − f i l t e r − p o s 5 0 − f i l t e r − m a p 0 In the above, we used the chimpanzee (panTro4, GCA_000001515.4) reference genome to infer the ancestral state of each allele (–ancestral PAN). The window size was set to 5,000 base pairs for all individuals (–bin-size 5000). The detailed information for other parameters was suggested and explained in Peter (2020) 62. Peter, B.M. 100,000 years of gene flow between Neandertals and Denisovans in the Altai mountains bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar .
To investigate the time transect of population size changes, we identified the ROH for the populations in the Amur region using hapROH software ( Ringbauer et al., 2020 76. Ringbauer, H. ∙ Novembre, J. ∙ Steinrücken, M. Human Parental Relatedness through Time - Detecting Runs of Homozygosity in Ancient DNA bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), which is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with ROH and non-ROH states and utilizes a panel of 5,008 phased haplotypes of the 1000 Genomes Project dataset (Phase 3, release 20130502) ( Auton et al., 2015 3. Auton, A. ∙ Brooks, L.D. ∙ Durbin, R.M. ..., 1000 Genomes Project Consortium A global reference for human genetic variation Nature. 2015; 526 :68-74 Crossref Scopus (10306) PubMed Google Scholar ). The short ROH (4-8 cM) represent patterns of past background relatedness that could be used as proxies for local population sizes. To achieve reliable results, we analyzed 11 newly sequenced ancient individuals with SNP numbers over 330,000 (including AR33K, AR19K, AR14.5K, AR14.1K, AR10.6K, AR10.5K, AR8.9K, AR8.1K, AR7K, AR6.87K, and AR6.33K) and two modern Ulchi individuals (S_Ulchi-1 and S_Ulchi-2). The effective population size was directly estimated from observed ROH lengths, using the observed lengths of ROH blocks l = l 1 , ..., l n for a given set of individuals i 1 , ..., i k and a maximum likelihood inference scheme. The likelihood Pr(l | Ne) was calculated and then the population size was estimated that maximizes the product of the likelihoods. To assess the potential influence of effective population size on the kinship inference, we also merged AR9.9K_2d.rel.AR10.5K_deleted and AR10.5K and estimated their effective population size.
To observe the time transect of EDAR V370A from 40 ka to present-day, we utilized both the genotype calls and read counts from 18 newly sampled ancient individuals with SNP numbers over 50,000 ( Table 1 ) and 12 published ancient northern East Asians from latitudes above 30 degrees North (including populations from Tianyuan Cave, Bianbian, Boshan, Xiaogao, Xiaojingshan, Yumin, and Devil’s Gate Cave). To obtain diploid genotype calls for EDAR V370A , we used an alternative variant calling scheme using snpAD ( Prüfer, 2018 66. Prüfer, K. snpAD: an ancient DNA genotype caller Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4165-4171 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). snpAD jointly estimates error rates and genotype frequencies from ancient sequences. These estimates were then used to produce genotype calls. Read counts for EDAR V370A were obtained from BAM files. We grouped individuals based on time windows (40,000-35,000 cal BP, 35,000-30,000 cal BP, 20,000-15,000 cal BP, 15,000-13,000 cal BP, 13,000-10,000 cal BP, 10,000-9,000 cal BP, 9,000-8,000 cal BP, and 8,000-6,000 cal BP) to observe the time transect of EDAR V370A .
