Title: TFPI is a colonic crypt receptor for TcdB from hypervirulent clade 2 C. difficile


Abstract: Summary

The emergence of hypervirulent clade 2 Clostridioides difficile is associated with severe symptoms and accounts for >20% of global infections. TcdB is a dominant virulence factor of C. difficile , and clade 2 strains exclusively express two TcdB variants (TcdB2 and TcdB4) that use unknown receptors distinct from the classic TcdB. Here, we performed CRISPR/Cas9 screens for TcdB4 and identified tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as its receptor. Using cryo-EM, we determined a complex structure of the full-length TcdB4 with TFPI, defining a common receptor-binding region for TcdB. Residue variations within this region divide major TcdB variants into 2 classes: one recognizes Frizzled (FZD), and the other recognizes TFPI. TFPI is highly expressed in the intestinal glands, and recombinant TFPI protects the colonic epithelium from TcdB2/4. These findings establish TFPI as a colonic crypt receptor for TcdB from clade 2 C. difficile and reveal new mechanisms for CDI pathogenesis.

Section: Introduction

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of nosocomial and community-acquired diarrhea and gastroenteritis-associated death in developed countries, accounting for around half a million cases and 15,000 deaths annually in the United States ( Guh et al., 2020 27.

In recent years, the global burden of CDI has been exacerbated due to the emergence and widespread of hypervirulent strains ( Guh et al., 2020 27.

The pathogenic C. difficile produces 3 pathogenicity-related exotoxins: toxin A (TcdA), toxin B (TcdB), and C. difficile transferase (CDT) ( Cowardin et al., 2016 19.

C. difficile exploits these toxins to disrupt the intestinal epithelial barrier, cause tissue damage and gain nutrients, provoke or suppress inflammation, and contribute to colonization ( Aktories et al., 2017 1.

Among the 3 toxins, TcdB plays a key role in causing gastrointestinal diseases, since all pathogenic C. difficile contain functional tcdB genes, and lacking TcdB, but not TcdA or CDT, could drastically attenuate the virulence of clinical strains in animal models ( Carter et al., 2015 7.

TcdB is a member of the large clostridial toxin (LCT) family, which enters target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and glucosylates small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) proteins, leading to cytoskeletal dysfunction and eventual cell death ( Aktories et al., 2017 1.

Recent genomic and functional studies reported that TcdB can be classified into at least 8 natural variants/subtypes, with type 1 to 4 as major variants associated with human diseases (Shen et al.’s classification is followed hereafter) ( Mansfield et al., 2020 44.

In the colon, the prototypical (type 1; TcdB1) and type-3 TcdB (TcdB3) exploit Wnt receptor Frizzled proteins (FZDs) to disrupt the epithelial barrier and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) to impair the intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts layer afterward ( Chen et al., 2021 15.

Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B Nature. 2016; 538 :350-355 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). C. difficile strains from multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) clade 2, also known as the hypervirulent clade ( Stabler et al., 2006 66. Stabler, R.A. ∙ Gerding, D.N. ∙ Songer, J.G. ...

Bacteriol. 2006; 188 :7297-7305 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ), exclusively express two TcdB variants (TcdB2 and TcdB4) that do not recognize FZDs ( Chung et al., 2018 17.

Functional analyses of epidemic Clostridioides difficile toxin B variants reveal their divergence in utilizing receptors and inducing pathology PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009197 Crossref Google Scholar ). How these TcdB variants target the intestinal epithelium to initiate the damage remains unknown.
Here, we carried out genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens for TcdB4 and identified TFPI as a host receptor. To further understand the molecular basis of TcdB receptor specificity, we determined the structure of the full-length TcdB4 in complex with its receptor TFPI using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Based on the structural and phylogenic analysis, we determined that TcdB harbors a key receptor-binding region interacting with either TFPI or FZDs. We further validated that TcdB2, which is produced by several notorious strains including ST01/RT027, also recognizes TFPI. TFPI-mediated intoxication accounts for cryptic damage and epithelial disruption in the intestines and may also be responsible for acute kidney injuries during the systematic infection. Finally, we demonstrated that simultaneously blocking both TFPI- and CSPG4-binding sites is an optimal strategy for neutralizing the clade 2 C. difficile TcdB and thus could be developed to prevent and treat CDI caused by the clade 2 C. difficile .

Section: Results

We set out to perform the gold-standard cytopathic cell-rounding assays on HeLa-Cas9 cells (parental cells; referred to as “wild type” [WT] hereafter) and CSPG4 −/− /FZD1/2/7 −/− cells to monitor the activities of reference TcdB from each of 8 known subtypes (toxin concentration that induces 50% of cell rounding is defined as CR 50 ). We observed that TcdB4 (reference sequence from strain 8864) is a toxin variant potent to both HeLa WT (CR 50 : 0.024 pM) and CSPG4 −/− /FZD1/2/7 −/− cells (CR 50 : 0.14 pM) ( Figure S1 ). We then tested the sensitivities of some human cell lines to TcdB4. Some cell lines, including U2OS and MCF-7, are much less sensitive to TcdB4 than others, such as HeLa, A549, and HT-29 ( Figure 1 A). These findings indicate that an uncharacterized and cell type-specific receptor mediates the cellular entry of TcdB4.
To identify the receptor for TcdB4, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in HeLa cells. In brief, cells were transduced with the GeCKO v2 guide RNA (gRNA) library ( Sanjana et al., 2014 60. Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Shalem, O. ∙ Zhang, F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :783-784 Crossref Scopus (3371) PubMed Google Scholar ) using lentiviruses and subjected to 3 rounds of TcdB4 selection ( Figure 1 B). The gRNAs sequences from the surviving cell population were decoded by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Identified genes were assessed based on fold enrichment of gRNA reads, NGS reads per gene, and the number of unique gRNAs ( Figures 1 C and 1D).
We focused on the top 30 enriched genes with at least 3 unique gRNAs targeted. UGP2 and CSPG4 are 2 expected hits. UGP2 is a cytosolic enzyme that produces uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose ( Flores-Díaz et al., 1997 23. Flores-Díaz, M. ∙ Alape-Girón, A. ∙ Persson, B. ...

This gene frequently appeared as a top hit in the previous CRISPR-Cas9 screens for LCTs including TcdA, TcdB, and TcsL ( Lee et al., 2020 39. Lee, H. ∙ Beilhartz, G.L. ∙ Kucharska, I. ...

Sulfated glycosaminoglycans and low-density lipoprotein receptor mediate the cellular entry of Clostridium novyi alpha-toxin Cell Res. 2021; 31 :935-938 Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar ), which uses UDP-N-acetylglucosamine for glucosylation ( Selzer et al., 1996 61.

Chem. 1996; 271 :25173-25177 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). CSPG4 is a characterized receptor for TcdB1 and TcdB2 ( Chen et al., 2021 15. Chen, P. ∙ Zeng, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Structural basis for CSPG4 as a receptor for TcdB and a therapeutic target in Clostridioides difficile infection Nat.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 functions as the cellular receptor for Clostridium difficile toxin B Cell Res. 2015; 25 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CSPG4 knockout (KO) cells were also mildly resistant to TcdB4 ( Pan et al., 2021 52. Pan, Z. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Luo, J. ...

TFPI ranked fourth by fold enrichment and was targeted by 5 different gRNAs. TFPI regulates the tissue factor-dependent pathway of blood coagulation and mainly exists on the cell membrane and in the extracellular space ( Broze and Girard, 2012 5. Broze, Jr., G.J. ∙ Girard, T.J. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor: structure-function Front. Biosci. 2012; 17 :262-280 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wood et al., 2014 79. Wood, J.P. ∙ Ellery, P.E. ∙ Maroney, S.A. ... Biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor Blood. 2014; 123 :2934-2943 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). Five genes, including PIGX , PIGM , PIGP , PIGB , and PIGV , encode key proteins in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis pathway.
To validate the candidates, we generated TFPI −/− , PIGX −/− , PIGM −/− , and PIGP −/− HeLa cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. For each candidate gene, 2 single-KO clones were established, and targeted disruptions of the open reading frames were confirmed by DNA sequencing. These cell lines, together with the FZD1/2/7 −/− and CSPG4 −/− cells, were tested by the cytopathic cell rounding experiment using TcdB4 ( Figure 2 A).
HeLa FZD1/2/7 −/− cells remained as sensitive as the WT cells to TcdB4, while CSPG4 −/− cells showed ∼7-fold increased resistance (based on CR 50 thereafter). HeLa PIGX −/− , PIGM −/− , and PIGP −/− cells showed modestly reduced sensitivities (∼7 to 20 fold) compared with the WT cells to TcdB4 ( Figure 2 B). GPI anchoring is a posttranslational modification and allows the modified proteins to be attached to the cell membrane via the glycolipid structure. Pretreatment of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an enzyme that cleaves PI and releases GPI-anchored proteins from the cell membrane, alleviated the cytopathic effect induced by TcdB4 in HeLa cells ( Figures 2 C and S2 A). These results indicate that GPI-anchored protein(s) are involved in TcdB4-induced toxicity to the host cells.
HeLa TFPI −/− cells are remarkably resistant to TcdB4, with reduced sensitivity of ∼260 fold compared with the WT cells ( Figure 2 B). The increased resistance in TFPI −/− cells was further confirmed by immunoblot for RAC1 glucosylation ( Figure 2 D). Moreover, we monitored the surface binding of TcdB4 in the HeLa WT, FZD1/2/7 −/− , CSPG4 −/− , and TFPI −/− cells using the immunoblot assay. TcdB4 is equally bound to the cell surface of WT and FZD1/2/7 −/− cells. The binding of TcdB4 was slightly reduced in the CSPG4 −/− cells and drastically diminished in the TFPI −/− cells ( Figure 2 E). These results suggest that TFPI contributes to the toxin action of TcdB4 via mediating the cell surface binding of the toxin.
TFPI has multiple spliced isoforms, since its pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing events ( Broze and Girard, 2012 5. Broze, Jr., G.J. ∙ Girard, T.J. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor: structure-function Front. Biosci. 2012; 17 :262-280 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maroney et al., 2010 46. Maroney, S.A. ∙ Ellery, P.E. ∙ Mast, A.E. Alternatively spliced isoforms of tissue factor pathway inhibitor Thromb. Res. 2010; 125 :S52-S56 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In humans, TFPI has 2 major isoforms, TFPIα and TFPIβ, which are also produced by all mammals ( Wood et al., 2014 79. Wood, J.P. ∙ Ellery, P.E. ∙ Maroney, S.A. ... Biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor Blood. 2014; 123 :2934-2943 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). TFPIα contains 3 tandem Kunitz-type protease inhibitory (Kunitz-1, Kunitz-2, and Kunitz-3 [or K1, K2, and K3]) domains followed by a basic carboxyterminal (C-terminal) region. TFPIβ lacks the K3 and basic C-terminal domains of TFPIα. Instead, it contains a C-terminal signal peptide that directs cleavage and attachment of a GPI anchor ( Broze and Girard, 2012 5. Broze, Jr., G.J. ∙ Girard, T.J. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor: structure-function Front. Biosci. 2012; 17 :262-280 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Girard et al., 2012 25.

Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchorage of tissue factor pathway inhibitor Circulation. 2003; 108 :623-627 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 F).
TFPIβ is a GPI-anchored protein, which is in line with multiple screen hits in the GPI anchor biosynthesis. Because TcdB4 also binds CSPG4 (yet inefficiently) and CSPG4 is highly expressed in HeLa ( Gupta et al., 2017 28. Gupta, P. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Sugiman-Marangos, S.N. ...

Frizzled proteins are colonic epithelial receptors for C. difficile toxin B Nature. 2016; 538 :350-355 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ), we used HeLa CSPG4 −/− cells to minimize the affection of CSPG4 when studying the roles of TFPI in HeLa. We found that CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells were more resistant to TcdB4 than CSPG4 −/− cells, while the susceptibility of CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells could be restored by transient transfection of TFPIβ ( Figures 2 G and 2H).
TFPIα is a secreted isoform that localizes both on the cell surface or in blood plasma ( Novotny et al., 1989 51. Novotny, W.F. ∙ Girard, T.J. ∙ Miletich, J.P. ...

Biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor Blood. 2014; 123 :2934-2943 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cell membrane localization of TFPIα is mainly compassed by binding of its K3 domain to protein S and basic C-terminal region to cell-surface glycosaminoglycans ( Donahue et al., 2006 20.

Res. 1988; 50 :803-813 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ). GFP-fused TFPIα, but not TFPI K1+K2 (residues 29 to 209), robustly bound to the surface of CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells when supplemented into the culture medium ( Figure S2 B). We showed that transient transfection of TFPIα restored the susceptibility of CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells to TcdB4 ( Figures 2 G and 2H), indicating TFPIα could also mediate the entry of TcdB4. Consistently, immunoblot analysis showed that overexpression of either TFPIα or TFPIβ mediated robust binding of TcdB4 on the cell surface ( Figure 2 I). Collectively, these data demonstrate that membrane-attached TFPI, in both α and β isoforms, serve as cellular receptors for TcdB4.
Interestingly, we found that “free” TFPIα has binary effects on mediating the cellular entry of TcdB4, depending on the presence of cell surface TFPI. Cultured CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells express no TFPI and allow exogenous TFPIα to bind. Thus, we observed that the supplemented TFPIα-GFP bound to the surface of the CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells and mediated the entry of TcdB4 ( Figures 2 J, S2 B, and S2C). In contrast, the cell surface of CSPG4 −/− cells is expected to be saturated by endogenous-expressed TFPIα. Indeed, TFPIα-GFP protected CSPG4 −/− cells from TcdB4 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 2 J and S2 C).
Because both TFPIα and TFPIβ can mediate the binding/entry of TcdB4, we conjectured that TcdB4 interacts with the K1 and K2 domains of TFPI (TFPI K1+K2 ). Thus, we used recombinant TFPI K1+K2 fused with human fragment crystallizable (Fc) region ( Figure 3 A) to perform the competition assay on the HeLa CSPG4 −/− cells. TFPI K1+K2 effectively protected the cells from TcdB4 but failed to alleviate the intoxication of TcdB1 ( Figures 3 B and S3 A), indicating TFPI K1+K2 specifically binds TcdB4. Also, TcdB4, but not TcdB1, was bound to the recombinant TFPI K1+K2 -Fc and co-precipitated by Protein A beads ( Figure S3 B).
Kunitz domains are small, rich in disulfide, and α/β fold structural domains that function as protease inhibitors ( Ascenzi et al., 2003 2. Ascenzi, P. ∙ Bocedi, A. ∙ Bolognesi, M. ... The bovine basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz inhibitor): a milestone protein Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2003; 4 :231-251 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kunitz domains can be found in many proteins including TFPI, TFPI2, alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP), and amyloid precursor protein. Phylogenic analysis showed that the primary sequence of TFPI K2 is most closely related to TFPI K1 with 67.9% sequence similarity, followed by TFPI2 K1 (64.1% similarity), whereas TFPI K3 is less similar to either TFPI K1 (56.6% similarity) or TFPI K2 (58.5% similarity) ( Figure 3 C).
To determine whether TcdB4 binds to TFPI K1 or TFPI K2 and the binding selectivity, we expressed GPI-anchored TFPI K1 , TFPI K2 , TFPI2 K1 , or AMBP K3 in the HeLa CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells and then tested their sensitivities to TcdB4. Transient transfection of only GPI-anchored TFPI K2 could restore the susceptibility of CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells ( Figure 3 D), suggesting TcdB4 specifically recognizes TFPI K2 . Consistently, TFPI K2 -Fc, but not TFPI K1 -Fc, protected the HeLa CSPG4 −/− cells in the competition assay ( Figure S3 C).
We next quantified the binding kinetics between TFPI K1+K2 -Fc and TcdB4 using the bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assay, which revealed a high affinity with a dissociation constant ( K d ) of ∼13 nM ( Figure S3 D). BLI assay also showed that TcdB4 bound to TFPI K2 -Fc with a K d of ∼6 nM, but not to TFPI K1 -Fc or human Fc fragment ( Figures 3 E and S3 E). Similarly, TcdB4 bound to Fc-tagged mouse Tfpi K2 with a K d of ∼4 nM ( Figure S3 F).
TcdB (∼270 kDa) is one of the largest bacterial toxins composed of 4 domains, including a glucosyltransferase domain (GTD), cysteine protease domain (CPD), transmembrane delivery and receptor-binding domain (DRBD), and C-terminal combined repetitive oligopeptides (CROPs) domain ( Figure 4 A). To characterize the TcdB4-TFPI interaction, the full-length TcdB4 were mixed with TFPI K1+K2 , and the complex was then isolated by size-exclusion chromatography. The complex fractions were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and concentrated for cryo-EM sample preparation ( Figures S4 A–S4C). The two-dimensional class averages of the TcdB4-TFPI complex showed clear structural features ( Figures S4 D–S4F). The final maps of the full-length TcdB4 core region resolution at 3.1 Å and the TcdB4-TFPI complex at 3.7 Å resolution under neutral pH conditions reveal most side-chain densities and secondary structural elements ( Figures 4 B and S4 G–S4K).
The overall architecture of TcdB4 is similar to the known structures of TcdB1 ( Simeon et al., 2019 64. Simeon, R. ∙ Jiang, M. ∙ Chamoun-Emanuelli, A.M. ... Selection and characterization of ultrahigh potency designed ankyrin repeat protein inhibitors of C. difficile toxin B PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000311 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) and TcdB3 ( Chen et al., 2019a 13. Chen, P. ∙ Lam, K.H. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Structure of the full-length Clostridium difficile toxin B Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :712-719 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CPD and GTD form an integrated region while the CROPs domain module curve around the core region by forming like a big hook ( Figure 4 B). TFPI K2 binds to the convex edge of the DRBD (residues 841–1,834) largely through 2 flexible loops in TFPI: loop 1 (residues 131–138) and loop 2 (residues 155–162) ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Each loop engages TcdB4 via an extensive network composed of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 4 D). The interaction between TcdB4 DRBD and TFPI K2 was further validated by the pulldown assay ( Figure S5 A). Point mutations at L1599, K1435, L1434, V1492, L1494, M1438, and D1468 in TcdB4 abolish the TFPI-binding ability, suggesting these positions are important for receptor recognition ( Figure 4 E).
Previous studies showed that the K2 domain of TFPI binds to the trypsin-like substrates such as factor Xa (FXa) ( Brandstetter et al., 1996 4. Brandstetter, H. ∙ Kühne, A. ∙ Bode, W. ... X-ray structure of active site-inhibited clotting factor Xa. Implications for drug design and substrate recognition J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 :29988-29992 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (294) PubMed Google Scholar ; Burgering et al., 1997 6. Burgering, M.J. ∙ Orbons, L.P. ∙ van der Doelen, A. ... The second Kunitz domain of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor: cloning, structure determination and interaction with factor Xa J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269 :395-407 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structurally, TFPI K2 interacts with both FXa and TcdB4 through the same loops ( Figure S5 B). Using the BLI assay, we demonstrated that the prebound of TcdB4 1285–1834 to TFPI blocked the binding of FXa and vice versa ( Figures 4 F and S5 C).
The resolved structure of TcdB4-TFPI, together with the previously reported structure of TcdB1-FZD2 ( Chen et al., 2018 12. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealed an evolutionarily functional region in TcdB for receptor recognition. To predict the receptor specificities of divergent TcdB sequences, we performed a phylogenetic analysis on the receptor-binding interface (RBI) of TcdB (residues 1,431–1,606) ( Figure 5 A). The phylogenetic tree is clustered into 2 major branches (denoted as Class I and II). Class I RBIs derive from TcdB1, TcdB3, and TcdB5, which prefer to bind FZDs. Class II RBIs were composed of sequences from TcdB2, TcdB4, TcdB6, and TcdB7 ( Figure 5 A), mainly existing in clade 2 C. difficile ( Figure 5 B). A small number of RBIs from TcdB2 and TcdB4 were found either in Class I or as outliers, possibly due to the historically frequent recombination events among TcdB variants ( Knight et al., 2021 35. Knight, D.R. ∙ Imwattana, K. ∙ Kullin, B. ... Major genetic discontinuity and novel toxigenic species in Clostridioides difficile taxonomy eLife. 2021; 10 :e64325 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ; Mansfield et al., 2020 44. Mansfield, M.J. ∙ Tremblay, B.J. ∙ Zeng, J. ... Phylogenomics of 8,839 Clostridioides difficile genomes reveals recombination-driven evolution and diversification of toxin A and B PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16 :e1009181 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shen et al., 2020 62. Shen, E. ∙ Zhu, K. ∙ Li, D. ... Subtyping analysis reveals new variants and accelerated evolution of Clostridioides difficile toxin B Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :347 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). We also perform the cytopathic cell-rounding assays on the HeLa CSPG4 −/− and CSPG4 −/− /TFPI −/− cells using reference TcdB1–8. Consistent with the phylogenetic analysis result, knocking out TFPI reduced the sensitivity of the cells to TcdB2, TcdB4, TcdB6, and TcdB7 ( Figures S6 A and S6B).
Albeit FZD2 and TFPI are structurally divergent, they both engage the same hydrophobic interface located on the convex edge of TcdB RBI ( Figure 5 C). Several residues, including but not limited to L1434, M1438, L1494, and Y1510 (positions in TcdB4; residues in TcdB1 shift to the left by one position in the alignment), are shared by Class I and Class II RBIs and contribute to both FZD and TFPI interactions. In the TcdB1-FZD2 complex, the interaction is bridged by a palmitoleic acid (PAM) with its tail protruding into a hydrophobic pocket in TcdB1. In the TcdB4-TFPI complex, the side chain of TFPI R135 is deeply embedded in the same pocket and forms multiple hydrogen bonds with adjacent residues including E1433, D1467, and E1469 from TcdB4 ( Figure 5 D). F1597 in TcdB1 is a critical residue stabilizing the middle part of PAM and interacts with the nearby F130 in FZD2 ( Chen et al., 2018 12. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ... Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B Science. 2018; 360 :664-669 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019b 14. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Structural insight into Wnt signaling inhibition by Clostridium difficile toxin B FEBS J. 2019; 286 :874-881 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ), while the F1597S substitution mimicking TcdB2 (F1598S for TcdB4) abolishes FZD binding ( Henkel et al., 2020 30. Henkel, D. ∙ Tatge, H. ∙ Schöttelndreier, D. ... Receptor Binding Domains of TcdB from Clostridioides difficile for Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan-4 and Frizzled Proteins Are Functionally Independent and Additive Toxins (Basel). 2020; 12 :E736 Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar ). Remarkably, S1598 in TcdB4 forms a close hydrogen bond with the nearby R140 in TFPI ( Figure 5 E). Thus, an F1598S substitution for TcdB may impair FZD binding but contribute to TFPI binding. Accordantly, phenylalanine is conserved in all Class I RBIs while serine is conserved in all Class II RBIs at this position.
The potential TFPI-binding interface in TcdB2 (reference sequence from R20291, an ST01/RT027 strain) resembles TcdB4 ( Figure 5 F), providing a structural clue that TcdB2 may recognize TFPI. As expected, the HeLa CSPG4 −/− / TFPI −/− cells are more resistant to TcdB2 than its parental CSPG4 −/− cells ( Figure 5 G), while its susceptibility could be restored by ectopic expressing a GPI-anchored Tfpi K2 ( Figure 5 H). In addition, Tfpi K2 -Fc effectively protected the HeLa CSPG4 −/− cells from TcdB2 intoxication ( Figures 5 I and S6 C). BLI analysis revealed that TcdB2 bound to Fc-tagged mouse Tfpi K2 and human TFPI K2 with respective K d of ∼0.2 and 0.4 μM ( Figures S6 D–S6F).
There are a few different residues between TcdB2 and TcdB4 within the RBI ( Figure S6 G). To interrogate the residues in TcdB2 that cause reduced binding of TFPI, we generated a series of TcdB4 1285–1834 mutants by replacing the residues with the corresponding ones in TcdB2. The pulldown experiment showed that I1496S is a key mutation attenuating the TFPI binding, while substitutions P1506L, Y1510C, and K1597N/K1600Q slightly reduce the interaction ( Figure 5 J). On the other hand, an S1496I substitution within TcdB2 1285–1834 enhanced its binding affinity to both human and mouse TFPI ( Figures S6 H and S6I).
TFPI is primarily produced by endothelial cells, megakaryocytes, monocytes, and smooth muscle cells ( Maroney and Mast, 2015 45. Maroney, S.A. ∙ Mast, A.E. New insights into the biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor J. Thromb. Haemost. 2015; 13 :S200-S207 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wood et al., 2014 79. Wood, J.P. ∙ Ellery, P.E. ∙ Maroney, S.A. ... Biology of tissue factor pathway inhibitor Blood. 2014; 123 :2934-2943 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ). In human intestines, TFPI is highly expressed in endothelial cells and glandular cells ( Uhlén et al., 2015 74. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref Scopus (9485) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also confirmed the Tfpi expression at the base of the glands in mouse intestines, including ileum, jejunum, cecum, and colon, via immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis ( Figures 6 A and S7 A).
To study the role of TFPI in TcdB4-induced colonic damage, we performed the mouse colon loop ligation experiment, which has been commonly used to examine the tissue damages caused by C. difficile toxins ( Sun et al., 2010 69. Sun, X. ∙ Savidge, T. ∙ Feng, H. The enterotoxicity of Clostridium difficile toxins Toxins (Basel). 2010; 2 :1848-1880 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Saline, TcdB4 (2 μg), or TcdB4 (2 μg) premixed with TFPI K2 -Fc (100 μg) were injected into the lumens of ligated colon segments. After six h, mice injected with TcdB4 alone developed obvious intoxication symptoms, including reduced mobility, hunched posture, and eye squinting, while mice injected with saline or TcdB4 premixed with TFPI K2 -Fc showed normal activities. By using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunofluorescent labeling for ZO-1, we observed largely collapsed colonic crypts and partly disrupted cryptic epithelium in the TcdB4 group, indicating colonic crypts are vulnerable to TcdB4. As expected, co-injection of TFPI K2 -Fc effectively prevented the TcdB4-induced erosion of colonic crypts ( Figures 6 B–6D and S7 B).
To further investigate the role of TFPI in vivo , we turned to Tfpi-KO mouse models. Although complete disruption of Tfpi in mice is intrauterine lethal ( Huang et al., 1997 31. Huang, Z.F. ∙ Higuchi, D. ∙ Lasky, N. ... Tissue factor pathway inhibitor gene disruption produces intrauterine lethality in mice Blood. 1997; 90 :944-951 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), mice with partial Tfpi retained appear to exhibit no overt developmental defect ( Girard et al., 2018 26. Girard, T.J. ∙ Grunz, K. ∙ Lasky, N.M. ... Re-evaluation of mouse tissue factor pathway inhibitor and comparison of mouse and human tissue factor pathway inhibitor physiology J. Thromb. Haemost. 2018; 16 :2246-2257 Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar ). Therefore, we generated the Tfpiβ KO mice (more precisely, β+γ isoforms KO) using the CRISPR-Cas9 approach ( Figure S7 C). When intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected with TcdB4 (1 μg/kg), all tested WT ( Tfpiβ +/+ ) mice and heterozygous ( Tfpiβ +/− ) mice died rapidly within 12 h. Strikingly, 63.6% (7 out of 11) of the homozygous KO ( Tfpiβ −/− ) mice survived ( Figure 6 E), with no obvious gender difference in lethality ( Figure S7 D). These results demonstrate that Tfpi is a physiological receptor of TcdB4 during systematic toxin exposure. The immunoblot analysis reveals reduced Tfpi levels in the Tfpiβ −/− mice, particularly in the kidney, presumably because kidneys mainly expresses the Tfpiβ isoform ( Figure S7 E). Based on the histopathological analysis, i.p. injecting TcdB4 in the WT mice leads to acute kidney damage, including glomerulus and retrobulbar capillaries dilate, structural damage of red blood cells, hemoglobin deposition of hemoglobin in the intravascular, and renal interstitial congestion and bleeding. Livers, lungs, spleens, and hearts in all injected mice seem to be normal. In comparison, Tfpiβ −/− mice injected with TcdB4 showed normal kidneys ( Figures 6 F and S7 F). These data indicate that TcdB4 entering the circulation system, which is common in severe infections, may strongly damage the kidney and cause death.
Besides TcdB4, TcdB2 is the other major variant expressed by clade 2 C. difficile . To examine whether impeding TFPI binding also protects the colonic epithelium from TcdB2, we further performed colon loop ligation assays using TcdB2 and TFPI K2 -Fc. TcdB2 caused severe intestinal injuries, including edema, epithelial disruption, and inflammatory cell infiltration, which was in line with the previous studies ( Chen et al., 2021 15. Chen, P. ∙ Zeng, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Structural basis for CSPG4 as a receptor for TcdB and a therapeutic target in Clostridioides difficile infection Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3748 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ; Pan et al., 2021 52. Pan, Z. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Luo, J. ... Functional analyses of epidemic Clostridioides difficile toxin B variants reveal their divergence in utilizing receptors and inducing pathology PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009197 Crossref Google Scholar ). For mice co-injected with TcdB2 and TFPI K2 -Fc, all above pathological features, particularly submucosal edema, were alleviated ( Figures 7 A–7C). However, this protection still seemed to be suboptimal for TcdB2. Since TcdB2 additionally utilizes CSPG4 as its high-affinity receptor, the residual tissue damage may be due to the CSPG4-mediated toxin entry.
On the other hand, blockage of CSPG4 binding also partly protected the intestinal epithelium from TcdB2, and the previous study used CSPG4 410–550 (CSPG4 R1 ) as an inhibitor to reduce the TcdB damage in the mouse models ( Chen et al., 2021 15. Chen, P. ∙ Zeng, J. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Structural basis for CSPG4 as a receptor for TcdB and a therapeutic target in Clostridioides difficile infection Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :3748 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). Based on the structural features of the toxin-receptor binding, it would be feasible to simultaneously block both TFPI- and CSPG4-binding sites on TcdB2. Therefore, we generated a TFPI K2 -CSPG4 R1 fusion construct with a flexible linker (GGGGS × 3) and evaluated its ability to inhibit TcdB2-induced toxicity in vivo using the mouse colon loop model. In brief, TcdB2 (2 μg), TcdB2 premixed with CSPG4 R1 (50 μg), or TcdB2 premixed with TFPI K2 -CSPG4 R1 (50 μg) were injected into the lumens of ligated mouse colon segments, and the colon tissues were then dissected out for histopathological analysis 6 h post-injection. CSPG4 R1 partly reduced TcdB2-induced damage to the colon, including inflammatory cell infiltration and submucosal edema, which is in line with the previous report. Compared to CSPG4 R1 , TFPI K2 -CSPG4 R1 provided further enhanced protection to colon tissues albeit an indeed lower toxin-inhibitor molar ratio was adopted, particularly in reducing mucosal edema, epithelial disruption, and cryptic damage ( Figures 7 D–7F). Together, these results suggest a possible therapeutic avenue of simultaneous inhibiting both TFPI- and CSPG4-binding abilities, which provides optimal protection from the clade 2 C. difficile TcdB.

Section: Discussion

Clinical strains belonging to C. difficile clade 2 are frequently isolated in North America, Europe, and Australia, accounting for over 20% of global CDI ( Badilla-Lobo and Rodríguez, 2021 3.

Major genetic discontinuity and novel toxigenic species in Clostridioides difficile taxonomy eLife. 2021; 10 :e64325 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). The clade 2 lineages have been generally concerned not only because they are epidemically associated with severe symptoms but also because they exclusively produce variant forms of TcdB that exhibit varied biological activities including receptor recognition ( Lanis et al., 2010 38. Lanis, J.M. ∙ Barua, S. ∙ Ballard, J.D.

These TcdB variants fail to bind FZDs but retain varied CSPG4-binding abilities ( Pan et al., 2021 52. Pan, Z. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Luo, J. ... Functional analyses of epidemic Clostridioides difficile toxin B variants reveal their divergence in utilizing receptors and inducing pathology PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17 :e1009197 Crossref Google Scholar ). However, CSPG4 is absent in the intestinal epithelium, as validated in multiple studies ( Mileto et al., 2020 48. Mileto, S.J. ∙ Jardé, T. ∙ Childress, K.O. ...

Cell Biol. 2006; 126 :483-490 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we showed that TFPI is a functional receptor for TcdB from clade 2 C. difficile . More importantly, TFPI is highly expressed in human and mouse intestinal glandular epithelia ( Uhlén et al., 2015 74. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref Scopus (9485) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our discovery of TFPI as a physiologically relevant receptor for TcdB4 and TcdB2 fills the gap of how TcdB from clade 2 C. difficile targets the colonic epithelium to initiate the tissue damage.
The cryo-EM structure of TcdB4-TFPI revealed an interacting pattern that is similar to TcdB1-FZD2 and TcsL-SEMA6A ( Chen et al., 2018 12. Chen, P. ∙ Tao, L. ∙ Wang, T. ...

The finding solidifies the notion that LCTs have evolved to bind different receptors via a similar interacting region. Remarkably, this is the first co-structure of a full-length LCT in complex with its receptor. The structure of the core domains of the toxin resembles the previously reported full-length TcdB structures ( Chen et al., 2019a 13. Chen, P. ∙ Lam, K.H. ∙ Liu, Z. ... Structure of the full-length Clostridium difficile toxin B Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :712-719 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Simeon et al., 2019 64.

Selection and characterization of ultrahigh potency designed ankyrin repeat protein inhibitors of C. difficile toxin B PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000311 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the co-structure, we further deduced that TcdB2, which is expressed by several notorious C. difficile genotypes including ST01/RT027, could recognize TFPI as well. The reference sequence of TcdB2 bound mouse Tfpi and human TFPI with the K d of ∼0.2 and ∼0.4 μM. The attenuation of the affinity ( K d for TcdB4-TFPI is ∼13 nM) is mainly due to a residue change of I1496S in TcdB2, while substitutions at other positions may also be involved. Notably, I1496 is found in certain TcdB2 sequences; those TcdB2 may exhibit strong binding to TFPI.
The discovery that TcdB variants can exploit two types of cellular receptors, TFPI and FZDs, to target the host intestinal barrier largely expands our perception of CDI pathogenesis. TcdB variants are sequentially divergent; the primary sequence identity between TcdB1 and TcdB4 is only 85.6%. Our finding that TcdB1 and TcdB4 adopt different sorts of proteins as intestinal epithelial receptors, together with the fact that these variants show distinguishable enzymatic activity ( Genth et al., 2014 24.

The presence of TFPI in multiple cell types in the intestine, including glandular cells, endothelial cells, enterocytes, megakaryocytes, and monocytes, is consistent with the pathological observation of CDI. Colonic glands, also known as colonic crypts, are critical for the self-renew of the intestinal epithelium, producing mucus and secreting anti-microbial molecules ( Clevers, 2013 18. Clevers, H.

Severe gut damage induced by C. difficile often results in erosion of crypts and loss of glandular cells ( Carter et al., 2015 7. Carter, G.P. ∙ Chakravorty, A. ∙ Pham Nguyen, T.A. ... Defining the Roles of TcdA and TcdB in Localized Gastrointestinal Disease, Systemic Organ Damage, and the Host Response during Clostridium difficile Infections MBio. 2015; 6 :e00551 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smits et al., 2016 65. Smits, W.K. ∙ Lyras, D. ∙ Lacy, D.B. ... Clostridium difficile infection Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2 :16020 Crossref Scopus (543) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent study showed that TcdB2 damaged the crypt base of mouse colon in an FZDs-independent manner ( Mileto et al., 2020 48. Mileto, S.J. ∙ Jardé, T. ∙ Childress, K.O. ... Clostridioides difficile infection damages colonic stem cells via TcdB, impairing epithelial repair and recovery from disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :8064-8073 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), which could be elucidated by our findings that colonic crypts express high levels of TFPI and thus are vulnerable targets of TcdB2 and TcdB4. TcdB4 can better recognize TFPI while TcdB2 additionally binds CSPG4, which may allow them to have partially different host cell targeting preferences and further induce varied pathological features. TcdB4 is a recently reported variant in clade 2 C. difficile ; hence, clinical data for TcdB4 versus TcdB2 are limited. Future studies on the manifestations in the patients caused by TcdB4 compared to TcdB2 would be interesting.
Strikingly, over 60% of the Tfpiβ −/− mice survived in the TcdB4 challenge assay, while all the WT mice died rapidly. Tfpiβ −/− mice have partial Tfpi depleted but already developed higher resistance to TcdB4, strongly supporting the idea that TFPI is a physiologically relevant receptor for clade 2 C. difficile TcdB in the systematic toxin exposure, which is common in severe infections. The previous toxin challenge assay showed equal lethality of TcdB1 to the WT and CSPG4 KO mice ( Yuan et al., 2015 81. Yuan, P. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Cai, C. ... Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 functions as the cellular receptor for Clostridium difficile toxin B Cell Res. 2015; 25 :157-168 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), implying CSPG4 may not be critical for systematic exposure to TcdB. We further determined that the kidney is a vulnerable target under such conditions, as acute kidney damage along with rapid death was observed in the WT mice, but not Tfpiβ −/− mice. In line with our result, it was clinically reported that CDI accompanies acute kidney injury ( Charilaou et al., 2018 9. Charilaou, P. ∙ Devani, K. ∙ John, F. ... Acute kidney injury impact on inpatient mortality in Clostridium difficile infection: A national propensity-matched study J. Gastroenterol.

TFPI dampens the initiation of blood coagulation by inhibiting TF-factor VIIa complex, FXa, and prothrombinase ( Maroney and Mast, 2015 45. Maroney, S.A. ∙ Mast, A.E.

Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-alpha inhibits prothrombinase during the initiation of blood coagulation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :17838-17843 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under the structural view, TFPI K2 binds to TcdB and its trypsin-like substrates ( Brandstetter et al., 1996 4. Brandstetter, H. ∙ Kühne, A. ∙ Bode, W. ... X-ray structure of active site-inhibited clotting factor Xa. Implications for drug design and substrate recognition J. Biol.

The second Kunitz domain of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor: cloning, structure determination and interaction with factor Xa J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269 :395-407 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) (i.e., FXa) through the same loops. Anti-TFPI therapy has recently been proposed as a novel strategy to treat coagulation disorders such as hemophilia ( Chowdary, 2020 16. Chowdary, P. Anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) therapy: a novel approach to the treatment of haemophilia Int. J. Hematol. 2020; 111 :42-50 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sidonio and Zimowski, 2019 63. Sidonio, R.F. ∙ Zimowski, K.L. TFPI blockade: removing coagulation’s brakes Blood. 2019; 134 :1885-1887 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar ). As a potent TFPI binder, TcdB4 RBI might be used as a new tool to study and intervene in the coagulation pathways. Besides, we postulate that the affected coagulation might bring additional advantages for C. difficile during the infection, whereas the exact relevance and contribution to the disease progression remains to be investigated.
Soluble TFPI and derivates are potential agents to neutralize the toxin and alleviate the intoxication caused by clade 2 C. difficile TcdB. Indeed, we exploited TFPI K2 as a potent decoy that effectively reduced tissue damage induced by TcdB4 and TcdB2 in vivo . Furthermore, we demonstrated that simultaneous inhibiting both TFPI and CSPG4 binding provided the best protection from TcdB2, while protection via inhibiting TFPI or CSPG4 binding alone was suboptimal. Interestingly, a similar strategy of simultaneous abolishing FZD and CSPG4 binding offered ideal protection for TcdB1 ( Simeon et al., 2019 64. Simeon, R. ∙ Jiang, M. ∙ Chamoun-Emanuelli, A.M. ... Selection and characterization of ultrahigh potency designed ankyrin repeat protein inhibitors of C. difficile toxin B PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000311 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). We suggest that simultaneous blocking two receptor-binding sites would be an optimal strategy for neutralizing TcdB and thus developing next-generation therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of CDI.
In this study, we defined that TcdB4 recognizes the K2 domain of TFPI for cellular entry. Because Kunitz domains are found in many varied proteins, we only tested the most closely related Kunitz domains using the GPI-fusion constructs. Despite the possibility being low, TcdB2/4 might recognize other Kunitz domain-containing proteins in full-length or untested Kunitz domains. TFPI is an important regulator for blood coagulation, and our data showed that TcdB4 could block the TFPI-FXa binding. Whether TcdB4 interferes with the coagulation pathway and contributes to the CDI pathogenesis was not investigated. It could be an interesting topic for future study. Lastly, the colon loop ligation assay was adopted to simulate the TcdB action on the colonic epithelium in vivo . This is a classic animal model for studying enterotoxins but only focuses on the direct impacts of toxins on host tissues. However, other factors are also involved in the CDI pathogenesis, such as bacterial colonization and immune response; whether and how TFPI-mediated TcdB2/4 intoxication plays a role in these processes remain undefined.

All cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 at 37°C. HeLa and 293T cells were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination and authenticated via STR profiling (Shanghai Biowing Biotechnology Co. LTD, Shanghai, China).
All the animal procedures reported herein were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Westlake University (IACUC Protocol #19-010-TL). C57BL/6J mice (male and female, 6-8 weeks) were purchased from Shanghai Jihui Laboratory Animal Care Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The Tfpiβ KO mice were generated in the Laboratory Animal Resources Center of Westlake University. Mice were housed with food and water without limitation and monitored under the care of full-time staff.
Genes encoding TcdB5 (reference sequence: TcdB ES130 ) and TcdB6 (reference sequence: TcdB CD160 ) were codon-optimized, synthesized by Genscript (Nanjing, China), and cloned into a pHT01 vector. DNA fragments encoding TcdB4 1-841 , TcdB4 842-1834 , TcdB4 1801-2367 , TcdB4 1285-1834 , and TcdB2 1285-1834 were PCR amplified and cloned into a pET28a vector with a HA-His tag introduced to their C terminus. Genes encoding human TFPIα, TFPIβ, TFPI K1 -GPI, TFPI K2 -GPI, TFPI2 K1 -GPI, TFPI2 K2 -GPI, AMBP K3 -GPI, and mouse Tfpiβ were codon-optimized, synthesized by Genscript (Nanjing, China), and cloned into a PLVX-IRES-Cherry vector. DNA fragments encoding TFPI K1+K2 , TFPI K1 , TFPI K2 , Tfpi K1 , Tfpi K2 , CSPG4 R1 , and TFPI K2 -CSPG4 R1 were PCR amplified and cloned into a pCAG or PHLsec vector with a FLAG, Fc-FLAG, Fc-His, or GFP-His tag fused to their C terminus.
Recombinant full-length TcdB proteins were expressed in Bacillus subtilis SL401 as described previously ( Shen et al., 2020 62. Shen, E. ∙ Zhu, K. ∙ Li, D. ... Subtyping analysis reveals new variants and accelerated evolution of Clostridioides difficile toxin B Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :347 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). TcdB4 1-841 , TcdB4 842-1834 , TcdB4 1801-2367 , TcdB4 1285-1834 , and TcdB2 1285-1834 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as His-tagged proteins. Recombinant TFPIα-GFP, TFPI K1+K2 -GFP, TFPI K1+K2 TFPI K1+K2 -Fc, TFPI K1 -Fc, TFPI K2 -Fc, Tfpi K1 -Fc, Tfpi K2 -Fc, CSPG4 R1 , and TFPI K2 -CSPG4 R1 were expressed in 293F cells and purified as His or FLAG-tagged proteins.
The cytopathic effect (cell-rounding) of TcdB was analyzed using the gold-standard cell-rounding assay. In brief, cells were exposed to toxins for the indicated time (or 12 h, if not noted). The phase-contrast images were captured by an Olympus IX73 microscopy system ( × 10-20 objectives). The numbers of round-shaped and normal-shaped cells were manually counted. The percentage of round-shaped cells was analyzed using GraphPad Prism and Origin software.
HeLa CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide KO library was generated as previously described ( Tao et al., 2019 72. Tao, L. ∙ Tian, S. ∙ Zhang, J. ... Sulfated glycosaminoglycans and low-density lipoprotein receptor contribute to Clostridium difficile toxin A entry into cells Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1760-1769 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GeCKO v2 library is composed of two sub-libraries (A and B) targeting 19,052 human genes with six gRNAs per gene. 293T cells were used to package the lentiviruses. 48 h post-transfection, the supernatant of the 293T culture was collected. The HeLa-Cas9 cells were then transduced with the lentiviral library at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 and selected with 2.5 ug/mL puromycin for 4 days. For each CRISPR sub-library, at least 6.7 × 10 7 cells were plated onto 15-cm cell culture dishes to ensure sufficient gRNA coverage. The cell library was then added with TcdB4 of indicated concentrations and cultured for 18 h. The plates were then washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) to remove loosely attached cells. The remaining cells were cultured with the toxin-free medium to ∼70% confluence and subjected to the next round of screen. Three rounds of screens were performed with increasing concentrations of TcdB4 (0.045, 0.15, and 0.45 pM, respectively). Cells from the final round of the screen were collected, and their genomic DNA was extracted using the Blood and Cell Culture DNA mini kit (QIAGEN). DNA fragments containing the gRNA sequences were amplified by PCR using primers lentiGP1_F and lentiGP-3_R. Next-Generation Sequencing was performed by a commercial vendor (Novogene, Beijing, China). The CRISPR screen data was provided in Table S1 .
To generate HeLa TFPI −/− , PIGM −/− , PIGP −/− , and PIGX −/− cells, the following gRNA sequences were cloned into the LentiGuide-Puro vector to target the indicated genes: 5′-CCTGACTCCGCAATCAACCA-3′ ( TFPI ), 5′-GTATACGGACATCGACTACC-3′ ( PIGM ), 5′-CTACAGTACTTTACCTCGTG-3′ ( PIGP ), and 5′-CGATGATAGCGGCAGTGCAC-3′ ( PIGX ). The HeLa CSPG4 −/− /TFPI −/− cells were generated from the HeLa CSPG4 −/− cells via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated KO using the above gRNA targeting TFPI . Lentiviruses were produced by the co-transfection of LentiGuide-puro plasmid containing each gRNA, pSPAX2, and pMD2.G into 293T cells. HeLa-Cas9 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing target gRNAs. Mixed populations of infected cells were selected with puromycin (2.5 μg/mL). For all KO cells, monoclonal cells were then isolated and validated by sequencing.
Cells were pre-washed with PBS and incubated with 50 nM TcdB4 on ice for 15 min. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the plates, lysed with RIPA, and subjected to the immunoblot analysis.
The protein amounts in cell lysate were determined by BCA assay (Beyotime, P0012S). The cell lysates were added with SDS sample buffer, heated for 10 min, separated on an SDS-PAGE gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare, 10600002). The membranes were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween-20 in tris-buffered saline at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. The membranes were then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight (4°C), washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min. Signals were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1863096) with a Fuji LAS3000 imaging system.
Toxins were pre-incubated with TFPI K1+K2 -Fc, TFPI K1 -Fc, or TFPI K2 -Fc for 10 min at room temperature with indicated toxin/protein ratios. The mixtures were added to the culture medium. Cells were then incubated at 37°C and the percentage of cell rounding was examined.
Pull-down assays were performed using Protein A agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Briefly, Fc-tagged TFPI domains were mixed with full-length TcdB1/TcdB4 or TcdB4 fragments of indicated concentrations in 1 mL of PBS. The mixtures were incubated at 4°C for 30 min and co-precipitated by Protein A agarose beads. Beads were washed, pelleted, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE or immunoblot analysis.
The binding affinities between recombinant TcdB4 and human/mouse TFPI domains were measured by BLI assay using the Octet RED96 system (ForteBio). All proteins were diluted in PBS. In brief, Fc-tagged human/mouse TFPI domains (10 μg/mL) were immobilized onto Dip and Read Anti-Human IgG-Fc biosensors (ForteBio) and balanced with PBS. The biosensors were then exposed to full-length TcdB4, TcdB4 1285-1834 , or TcdB2 1285-1834 , followed by washing (dissociation) with PBS. Binding affinities ( K d ) were calculated using the Data Analysis software (ForteBio).
To analyze sequential bindings of FXa and TcdB4 to TFPI, TFPI K2 -Fc (10 μg /mL) was immobilized onto Dip and Read Anti-Human IgG-Fc biosensors and balanced with HNBSACa buffer (50mM HEPES, 100mM NaCl, 5mM CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.3). The loaded biosensors were first exposed to 100 nM FXa, balanced again with HNBSACa, and then exposed to 300 nM TcdB4 1285-1834 . Alternatively, the loaded biosensors were first exposed to 300 nM TcdB4 1285-1834 , balanced with HNBSACa, and then exposed to 100 nM FXa. All biosensors were then washed with HNBSACa.
To prepare the cryo-EM sample, 4 μL of purified TcdB4-TFPI K1+K2 complex at a concentration of 9.2 mg/mL was placed on glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R2.1/3.1, 300 mesh). The grid was blotted with filter paper for 4 s in a chamber set with 100% humidity at 8°C to remove the excess sample and then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen with the Vitrobot Mark IV system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Cryo-EM specimens were imaged on a 300-kV Titan Krios electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a normal magnification of 81,000 × . Movies were recorded using a Gatan K3 detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20 eV) at the counted mode, with a pixel size of 0.5435 Å. Each stack of 32 frames was exposed for 2.56 s, with a dose rate of ∼23 counts/second/physical-pixel (∼19.5 e-/second/Å 2 ) for each frame. AutoEMation II( Lei and Frank, 2005 40. Lei, J. ∙ Frank, J. Automated acquisition of cryo-electron micrographs for single particle reconstruction on an FEI Tecnai electron microscope J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150 :69-80 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for the fully automated data collection with high efficiency (∼3000 stacks/24 h). All 32 frames in each stack were aligned and summed using the whole-image motion correction program MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 84. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) and binned to a pixel size of 1.087 Å. The defocus value for each image varied from −1.5 to −2.0 μm and was determined by Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 82. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A total of 4,816 micrographs were collected, of which 4,251 micrographs were manually selected for further processing ( Zivanov et al., 2018 86. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2936) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 2,317,113 particles were auto-picked using Gautomatch (developed by Kai Zhang, https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/zhang-software/#gauto ) and were subjected to two-dimensional (2D) classification, resulting in 1,244,165 good particles. Then we performed two parallel runs of single-reference 3D classification using 4x binned particles (pixel size: 4.348 Å) (Round 1). After Round 1, good particles were selected and merged, and the duplicated particles were removed. The remaining 953,332 particles were applied to another two parallel runs of single-reference 3D classification (Round 2), but with 2x binned particles (pixel size: 2.174 Å). After local classification, the remaining 536,277 particles were re-centered and re-extracted (pixel size: 1.087 Å) for auto-refinement, generating a reconstruction of the TcdB4-TFPI complex at an average resolution of 4.1 Å. Then an additional round (Round 3) of 3D classification was performed. The remaining particles were classified with a soft mask on the core region of the complex. The good class containing 227,825 particles yielded a reconstruction at an average resolution of 3.1 Å. These particles were further locally classified and refined using a soft mask on the interface between TFPI and TcdB4, generating an additional reconstruction for the interface at 3.1 Å.
The angular distributions of the particles used for the final reconstruction are reasonable, and the refinement of the atomic coordinates did not suffer from severe over-fitting. The resulting EM density maps display clear features for amino acid side chains in the core region and the TcdB4-TFPI interface. Reported resolution limits were calculated based on the FSC 0.143 criterion with a high-resolution noise substitution method ( Chen et al., 2013 11. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mask used here was generated with the following settings: lowpass filter map: 15 Å; initial binarisation threshold: 0.005; extend binary map this many pixels: 3; add a soft-edge of this many pixels: 12. Prior to visualization, all EM maps were corrected for modulation transfer function (MTF) of the detector and then sharpened by applying a negative B-factor that was estimated using an automated procedure ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 58. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution variations were estimated using ResMap ( Swint-Kruse and Brown, 2005 70. Swint-Kruse, L. ∙ Brown, C.S. Resmap: automated representation of macromolecular interfaces as two-dimensional networks Bioinformatics. 2005; 21 :3327-3328 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The crystal structure of C. difficile toxin B (PDB code: 6OQ5 ) was used as a template to generate a homology model for TcdB4 using CHAINSAW ( Stein, 2008 68. Stein, N. CHAINSAW: a program for mutating pdb files used as templates in molecular replacement J. Appl. Cryst. 2008; 41 :641-643 Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar ). The homology model was fit into the cryo-EM map for the TcdB4-TFPI complex using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 53. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ). Manual adjustment of the model was performed in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 21. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ), followed by iterative rounds of real-space refinement in PHENIX and manual adjustment in COOT. Similarly, the crystal structure of the K2 domain of TFPI was fit into the cryo-EM map and manually adjusted in COOT. See Table S2 for statistics of 3D reconstructions and model refinement.
The mutations in TcdB or TcdB fragments were generated with oligonucleotides containing the mutations of interest using QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, 200523) or Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs, E0554S).
2,691 primary sequences of TcdB were directly obtained from the previous study ( Shen et al., 2020 62. Shen, E. ∙ Zhu, K. ∙ Li, D. ... Subtyping analysis reveals new variants and accelerated evolution of Clostridioides difficile toxin B Commun. Biol. 2020; 3 :347 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar ). SplitsTree v.4.17.0 software ( Huson and Bryant, 2006 33. Huson, D.H. ∙ Bryant, D. Application of phylogenetic networks in evolutionary studies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2006; 23 :254-267 Crossref Scopus (6623) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to generate the phylogenic tree.
The spCas9 protein and sgRNAs were microinjected into the fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 mice, sequences of sgRNAs are shown in Table S3 . Fertilized eggs were transplanted to obtain positive F0 mice which were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. A stable F1 generation mouse model was obtained by mating positive F0 generation mice with C57BL/6 mice. Genotyping of mice was performed using the mouse tissue direct PCR Kit (10185ES50, Yeasen). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Primers used for genotyping are summarized in Table S3 .
All procedures were conducted following the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Westlake University (IACUC Protocol #19-010-TL). 6-8 weeks old C57BL/6 female mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium. A midline laparotomy was performed to locate the ascending colon and seal a ∼2 cm loop with silk ligatures. 2 μg of TcdB4 or TcdB2 with or without 100 μg of TFPI K2 -Fc, 50 μg of CSPG4 R1 , or 100 μg of TFPI K2 -CSPG4 R1 in 100 μL of 0.9% normal saline or 100 μL of 0.9% normal saline were injected into the sealed colon segment using an insulin syringe, followed by suturing of the skin incision. Mice were allowed to recover in a 37°C thermostatic plate. After 6 h, mice were euthanized, and the ligated colon segments were excised. The colon segments were fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and then subjected to histopathological analysis.
Colon specimens were fixed in formalin for 12 h before being dehydrated by using an alcohol gradient, cleared with xylene then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin blocks were cut into 5 μm thick sections. The sections were stained with H&E or detected with an antibody against TFPI (ab180619, Abcam) via immunohistochemical analysis. The H&E staining sections were scored blinded by two pathologists based on edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, epithelial disruption, and cryptic damage on a scale of 0 to 3 (mild to severe). The average scores were plotted on the charts.
The phase-contrast images of cells were taken (Olympus IX73, 10-20 × objectives). A zone of 300 × 300 μm was selected randomly, which contains 50∼150 cells. Round-shaped and normal-shaped cells were counted manually, and the percentage of round-shaped cells was calculated. Data were represented as mean ± SD from six independent replicates and analyzed using Student’s t test in the software OriginPro or GraphPad Prism. ns, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001.
The H&E staining sections were scored blinded and plotted on the charts. Data were represented as mean ± SEM and analyzed by One-way ANOVA using Fisher LSD test for multiple comparisons in the software OriginPro or GraphPad Prism. ns, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ , p < 0.0001.
