Title: Vascular Disease and Thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2-Infected Rhesus Macaques


Abstract: Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Clinical features that drive SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in humans include inflammation and thrombosis, but the mechanistic details underlying these processes remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate endothelial disruption and vascular thrombosis in histopathologic sections of lungs from both humans and rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. To define key molecular pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in macaques, we performed transcriptomic analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood and proteomic analyses of serum. We observed macrophage infiltrates in lung and upregulation of macrophage, complement, platelet activation, thrombosis, and proinflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, MX1, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, TNFα, and NF-κB. These results suggest a model in which critical interactions between inflammatory and thrombosis pathways lead to SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular disease. Our findings suggest potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.

Section: Introduction

Animal models are critical for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and for preclinical evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics ( Chandrashekar et al., 2020 7.

We and others have reported that rhesus macaques can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and show robust viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract ( Munster et al., 2020 34.

However, the pathways underlying SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular disease have not yet been elucidated. Human studies have revealed a substantial role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease ( Fung and Liu, 2019 12. Fung, T.S. ∙ Liu, D.X.

Clinical experience has also revelated the presence of elevated D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, in critically ill patients ( Lu et al., 2020 28. Lu, R. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Li, J. ...

These features are not typically observed with other respiratory viruses such as influenza ( Carsana et al., 2020 5. Carsana, L. ∙ Sonzogni, A. ∙ Nasr, A. ...

Markers of endothelial and platelet activation were also enriched in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Goshua et al., 2020 16. Goshua, G. ∙ Pine, A.B. ∙ Meizlish, M.L. ...

In this study, we compared pulmonary pathology in human autopsy specimens and rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. We then evaluated the pathways underlying these processes in rhesus macaques using integrated histopathologic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and cytokine data.

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis and severe endothelial injury in humans ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1.

We conducted autopsies of COVID-19 patients in April 2020 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, with research permission granted by the next of kin and approval by the Institutional Review Board. We observed vascular thromboses ( Figures 1 A and 1B) and endothelialitis and inflammation in the lung ( Figures 1 C and 1D), consistent with a recently published study ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ... Pulmonary Vascular Endothelialitis, Thrombosis, and Angiogenesis in Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2020; 383 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (3883) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next evaluated histopathologic lung sections from a cohort of adult rhesus macaques (6–12 years old) on day 2 and day 4 following infection with SARS-CoV-2. Four regions from the left cranial and caudal lobes and four regions from the right cranial, middle, and caudal lobes, all including proximal and distal branches of the bronchial tree, were analyzed. Histopathology revealed prominent vascular changes including endothelialitis ( Figure 1 E), similar to that reported in humans ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1.

Intimal thickening of inflamed medium-sized arteries was highlighted by Van Verhoeff Gieson silver stain for elastic fibers ( Figure 1 F). Using tissue multiplexed immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) ( Lin et al., 2018 26. Lin, J.R. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Wang, S. ... Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissues and tumors using t-CyCIF and conventional optical microscopes eLife. 2018; 7 :e31657 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed numerous CD8+ T lymphocytes adhering to the endothelium and in perivascular regions associated with endothelialitis ( Figures 1 G and 1H). We also observed microthrombi in alveolar septae ( Figure 1 I), similar to that seen in humans ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ... Pulmonary Vascular Endothelialitis, Thrombosis, and Angiogenesis in Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2020; 383 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (3883) PubMed Google Scholar ; Carsana et al., 2020 5.

Pulmonary post-mortem findings in a series of COVID-19 cases from northern Italy: a two-centre descriptive study Lancet Infect Dis. 2020; 20 :1135-1140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar ). Irregular thickening of the endothelial lining in infected macaques was also associated with narrowed vessel lumina ( Figure 1 J). Moreover, early fibrin deposits ( George et al., 2020 15. George, P.M. ∙ Wells, A.U. ∙ Jenkins, R.G. Pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19: the potential role for antifibrotic therapy Lancet Respir Med. 2020; 8 :807-815 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (754) PubMed Google Scholar ) were observed in alveolar septae ( Figure 1 K) and along the endothelium of vessels ( Figure 1 L). This vascular pathology observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques was not observed in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)- or Zika virus (ZIKV)-infected rhesus macaques ( Figure S1 ).
von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a key mediator of platelet adhesion and aggregation ( Gragnano et al., 2017 17. Gragnano, F. ∙ Sperlongano, S. ∙ Golia, E. ... The Role of von Willebrand Factor in Vascular Inflammation: From Pathogenesis to Targeted Therapy Mediators Inflamm. 2017; 2017 :5620314 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found increased vWF throughout the lung of infected animals compared to uninfected controls, including along the luminal side of blood vessel endothelial cells and within alveolar septae ( Figure 1 M). We also observed extensive collagen I deposition in lung parenchyma, including around blood vessels and within alveolar septae ( Figure 1 N), consistent with reports of fibroproliferation and pulmonary fibrosis in humans ( George et al., 2020 15. George, P.M. ∙ Wells, A.U. ∙ Jenkins, R.G. Pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19: the potential role for antifibrotic therapy Lancet Respir Med. 2020; 8 :807-815 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (754) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To define key biological processes and pathways activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptomic profiling of BAL and peripheral blood samples, as well as serum proteomics, on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 following SARS-CoV-2 challenge in n = 9 rhesus macaques as well as n = 9 uninfected control samples from blood and serum and n = 5 uninfected control samples from BAL. Data from BAL and peripheral blood showed that genes with elevated expression on days 1–4 had largely returned to normal by day 14 including interferon and SARS-CoV-2 transcripts ( Figure S2 ).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 42. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (32255) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed for genes expressed in BAL and peripheral blood, and for proteins detected in serum, using a curated list of thrombosis-associated pathways; the list included signaling by transcription factors associated with neutrophil and monocyte-mediated inflammatory responses, platelet activation and aggregation ( Xu et al., 2017 48. Xu, Z. ∙ Xu, Y.J. ∙ Hao, Y.N. ... A novel STAT3 inhibitor negatively modulates platelet activation and aggregation Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2017; 38 :651-659 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Elliott et al., 2013 10. Elliott, R. ∙ Li, F. ∙ Dragomir, I. ... Analysis of the host transcriptome from demyelinating spinal cord of murine coronavirus-infected mice PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e75346 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as signatures for coagulation, thrombopoietin signaling, platelet activation and granulation, protein adhesion, formation of fibrin clots, and clotting cascade ( Figure 2 A).
GSEA ( Subramanian et al., 2005 42. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (32255) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed significant enrichment of transcriptomic and proteomics signatures associated with coagulation, thrombosis, and vascular disease in BAL, peripheral blood, and serum of infected macaques ( Figure 2 A). Pathways of coagulation and clotting cascade were increased on days 1–14 in BAL, peripheral blood, and serum of challenged macaques and included coagulation and tissue factors (F3, F5, F2, F8, and F11), markers of the clotting cascade (THBD and F13A1), and metalloproteinase genes (ADAMTS1) involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix ( Figures 2 B–2D). Thrombomodulin (THBD) is an endothelial-specific type I membrane receptor that binds thrombin, and F13A1 encodes the coagulation factor XIIIA. Moreover, collagen is one of the major mediators of platelet activation and aggregation in response to tissue injury through various mechanisms including binding to vWF ( Gragnano et al., 2017 17. Gragnano, F. ∙ Sperlongano, S. ∙ Golia, E. ... The Role of von Willebrand Factor in Vascular Inflammation: From Pathogenesis to Targeted Therapy Mediators Inflamm. 2017; 2017 :5620314 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a significant increase of collagen and protein adhesion markers in BAL, peripheral blood, and serum ( Figures 2 B–2D), while vWF was upregulated only in peripheral blood and serum ( Figures 2 C and 2D, middle panels) of challenged macaques. These transcriptomic and proteomic findings confirm our histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) data ( Figure 1 ).
Additional thrombosis-associated markers, coagulation factors, and HIF1α signaling pathway previously reported in patients with severe inflammatory disease ( Gangaraju et al., 2020 13. Gangaraju, R. ∙ Song, J. ∙ Kim, S.J. ... Thrombotic, inflammatory, and HIF-regulated genes and thrombosis risk in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia Blood Adv. 2020; 4 :1115-1130 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) were upregulated in BAL, peripheral blood, and serum of infected macaques ( Figure S3 A). Moreover, markers of platelet activation and aggregation and extracellular matrix organization (COL1A1, COL1A2, FN1, PF4, IGF1, and ADAM15), which were increased in patients with severe-to-critical COVID-19 disease ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ... Pulmonary Vascular Endothelialitis, Thrombosis, and Angiogenesis in Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2020; 383 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (3883) PubMed Google Scholar ), were also increased in BAL, peripheral blood, and serum of infected macaques ( Figure S3 B). To understand the mechanisms regulating thrombosis-associated markers increased by SARS-CoV-2, we performed upstream regulators analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) on genes commonly upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 in humans ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ... Pulmonary Vascular Endothelialitis, Thrombosis, and Angiogenesis in Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2020; 383 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (3883) PubMed Google Scholar ) and macaques shown in Figure S3 . This analysis showed interleukin (IL)-1 (p = 3.6E−10), IL-6 (p = 1.3E−06), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (p = 1.90E−10), transcription factors such as STAT3 (p = 1.90E−04) and NF-κB (p = 3.51E−08), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (p = 2.19E−11) ( Figures S3 C–S3E) as the top upstream regulators of thrombosis-associated markers increased by SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe-to-critical disease and in macaques. Accumulating data suggest a role of LPS in boosting the proinflammatory responses following infection and disturbing the host immune response to infection ( Arunachalam et al., 2020 2. Arunachalam, P.S. ∙ Wimmers, F. ∙ Mok, C.K.P. ... Systems biological assessment of immunity to mild versus severe COVID-19 infection in humans Science. 2020; 369 :1210-1220 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Differential gene expression analysis revealed significant increase (Benjamini-Hochberg [BH]-adjusted p < 0.05) of viral sensing and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory markers as early as day 1 in both BAL and peripheral blood, similar to previous reports from humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 ( Liao et al., 2020 25.

GSEA ( Subramanian et al., 2005 42. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (32255) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed significant increase of pathways of interferon alpha (IFNα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), TNFα, and inflammatory signaling on days 1–4 in BAL and peripheral blood of infected macaques ( Figure 3 A). These changes generally resolved by days 10–14.
We observed a significant upregulation of ISGs and antiviral genes, including MX1, MX2, IFIT1-3, ISG15, IRF7, IFTM1, IFTM2, OAS1/2/3, DDX58, and IDO1 in BAL ( Figure 3 B) and peripheral blood ( Figure 3 C), as well as upregulation of inflammasome pathway, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (TLR2/5/7), TNFα, colony stimulating factor (CSF), and NF-κB. Of note, RNA levels of IFNα genes including IFNA8, IFNA2, IFNA4, and IFNA10 were increased by SARS-CoV-2 in BAL ( Figure 3 B), whereas these IFNα transcripts were not detected by RNA-seq in peripheral blood or serum of infected macaques. Moreover, we compared the expression levels of IFNα genes and ISGs and inflammatory markers such as MX1, IRF7, TNF, NLRP3, and NF-κB and found ISGs and other inflammatory markers were expressed with higher magnitude compared to IFNα genes in BAL of infected macaques. Moreover, ISGs and inflammatory markers increased by SARS-CoV-2 in BAL, peripheral blood, and serum of macaques ( Figure S4 ) were also increased in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 20. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients Science. 2020; 369 :712-718 Crossref Scopus (1923) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Upregulation of inflammatory and ISGs markers by SARS-CoV-2 in macaques was validated by serum protein levels for C reactive protein (CRP), IFNA7, ISG15, MX1, and IDO1 among many others (BH-adjusted p < 0.05) ( Figure 3 D). Using immunohistochemistry, we further validated the upregulation of MX1, an interferon-induced protein with antiviral activity against a wide range of RNA viruses ( Haller et al., 2007 21. Haller, O. ∙ Staeheli, P. ∙ Kochs, G. Interferon-induced Mx proteins in antiviral host defense Biochimie. 2007; 89 :812-818 Crossref Scopus (279) PubMed Google Scholar ) and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), which is activated by numerous cytokines and growth factors including IL-6 ( Garbers et al., 2015 14. Garbers, C. ∙ Aparicio-Siegmund, S. ∙ Rose-John, S.

A novel STAT3 inhibitor negatively modulates platelet activation and aggregation Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2017; 38 :651-659 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 E and 3F).
Transcriptomic analyses revealed significant increase of cytokines and their downstream signaling pathways in BAL ( Figure 4 A) and peripheral blood ( Figure 4 B), including IL-1RN, IL-6, IL-8, IL-4, IL-10, IL-27, IL-18, IL-15, IL-12, and IL-17. Signaling by IL-6_JAK_STAT3 was among the top enriched pathways in BAL ( Figure 4 C) (normalized enrichment score [NES] = 2.37; false discovery rate [FDR] q-value < 10 −6 ) and peripheral blood (NES = 1.94; FDR q-value < 10 −6 ) ( Figure 4 D). Elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels were further validated by immunohistochemistry in the lung of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals compared to uninfected controls ( Figures 4 E and 4F).
In serum of infected macaques, we observed elevated protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL11, IL-1RN, CXCL10, IL1-RL1, CCL8, CCL2, and CXCL12 ( Figure 4 G) as well as downstream signaling by IL-8, IL-6, and GM-CSF that were also increased in serum of infected animals ( Figure S5 A). Serum cytokines levels, measured by Luminex, revealed increased IL-1β, IL-6, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, and GM-CSF as well as chemokines involved in the recruitment and activation of macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils such as CXCL11, CCL3, CCL2, and CCL11 and the B cell-attracting chemokine CXCL13 in BAL of infected macaques ( Figure 4 H, top panel). In peripheral blood, serum levels of IL-1RA, IL-8, and CXCL13 were significantly increased by SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 4 H, lower panel).

Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (32255) PubMed Google Scholar ) of genes upregulated in BAL and peripheral blood and histopathology also revealed upregulation of additional pathways including signatures of natural killer (NK), dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, monocytes, T cells, and B cells; ( Figures S5 B and S5C); markers of immune exhaustion ( Figure S5 D), apoptosis, and cell death ( Figure S6 A); reactive oxygen species (ROS); and metabolism pathways such as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway ( Figures S6 B and S6C).
Consistent with reports from SARS-CoV-2-infected humans ( Felsenstein et al., 2020 11. Felsenstein, S. ∙ Herbert, J.A. ∙ McNamara, P.S. ...

Merad, M. ∙ Martin, J.C. Pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19: a key role for monocytes and macrophages Nat Rev Immunol. 2020; 20 :355-362 Crossref Scopus (1704) PubMed Google Scholar ), t-CyCIF analysis of lung sections from rhesus macaques on day 2 and day 4 following SARS-CoV-2 challenge showed large numbers of CD68 and CD163 positive macrophages in large airways and filling alveoli throughout regions of consolidation and abnormal pathology ( Figures 5 A and 5B) as compared to uninvolved regions of lung in the same animal ( Figure 5 C). In consolidated regions of the lung (regions in which alveoli are filled with fluid), many cells found in large airways, alveoli, and the interstitium were also positive for CD16, a marker of monocyte/macrophages and NK cells in rhesus macaques ( Webster and Johnson, 2005 45. Webster, R.L. ∙ Johnson, R.P. Delineation of multiple subpopulations of natural killer cells in rhesus macaques Immunology. 2005; 115 :206-214 Crossref Scopus (103) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 D–5F). In contrast, CD206-positive macrophages were frequently observed in alveolar septae in uninvolved regions of the lung ( Figure 5 F). CD16-positive monocytes may have the ability to bind endothelium, extravagate, and replenish tissue macrophages in response to inflammation ( Nowlin et al., 2018 36. Nowlin, B.T. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Schafer, J.L. ... Monocyte subsets exhibit transcriptional plasticity and a shared response to interferon in SIV-infected rhesus macaques J Leukoc Biol. 2018; 103 :141-155 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Macrophages in affected lung and within airways were universally positive for the pan-macrophage and activation marker Iba-1 ( Figures 5 G–5I).
We also observed enrichment of transcriptional signatures of M0, M1, and M2 macrophages and IL-6-, IL-10-, and IFNα-activated macrophages in BAL and peripheral blood on days 1–4 post-challenge ( Figure 5 J). Consistent with the t-CyCIF analysis, markers of macrophages (CD163, CD68) were significantly increased by SARS-CoV-2 in BAL and peripheral blood of macaques ( Figures 5 K and 5L). Of note, the enrichment level of M1 macrophages’ signature in both BAL (NES = 2.5; FDR q-value < 10 −6 ) and peripheral blood (NES = 2.41; FDR q-value < 10 −6 ) was higher compared to M0 and M2 signatures ( Figures 5 M and 5N). The upregulation of macrophages’ M1 signature by SARS-CoV-2 was further validated in serum of infected macaques on days 2–4 post-challenge ( Figure 5 O). These histopathologic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data suggest a critical role of activated macrophages in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques.
Lung sections of rhesus macaques on day 2 and day 4 following SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased expression of key components of the complement pathway ( Cedzyński et al., 2019 6. Cedzyński, M. ∙ Thielens, N.M. ∙ Mollnes, T.E. ... Editorial: The Role of Complement in Health and Disease Front Immunol. 2019; 10 :1869 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), including complement receptor 1 (CR1) and C3, compared to uninfected controls ( Figure 6 A). Transcriptomic analysis of BAL and peripheral blood of infected macaques similarly demonstrated upregulation of complement pathways on days 1–4 in BAL (day 2: NES = 1.60; FDR q-value = 0.003) and in peripheral blood (day 2: NES = 1.95; FDR q-value < 10 −6 ), including complement markers C1R, C1S, C1QA, and C1QC; ficolin markers (e.g., FCN1 and FCN3); tissue factor F3; and fibronectin FN1 ( Figure 6 B; Figure S7 A). We further validated the upregulation of the complement cascade in serum by proteomics, which demonstrated increased serum levels of multiple complement components and complement cascade, including C1R, C1QC, C3b/C4b receptor 1 (CR1), and C3 and coagulation factors II, V, IX, and X (F2, F5, F9, and F10) ( Figure 6 C). Additionally, signatures of platelet activation, aggregation, and adhesion ( Figures S7 B and S7C) and signatures of megakaryocyte cells ( Rapkiewicz et al., 2020 39. Rapkiewicz, A.V. ∙ Mai, X. ∙ Carsons, S.E. ... Megakaryocytes and platelet-fibrin thrombi characterize multi-organ thrombosis at autopsy in COVID-19: A case series EClinicalMedicine. 2020; 24 :100434 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 D) were also increased by SARS-CoV-2 in BAL and peripheral blood of infected macaques.
Finally, our analysis revealed that the expression level of innate immune markers increased by SARS-CoV-2 correlated positively with viral loads in BAL on day 2 post-challenge ( Figure 7 A), including cytokines and inflammatory markers (IL-6R, IL1RN, IL-10, CXCL10, TNF, NFKB1, and NLRP3), ISGs (IRF7, IFIT1, and MX1), IFNα genes (IFNA2, IFNAR2, and IFNA4), and thrombosis-associated markers (C1QA, C3AR1, THBD, and FN1). These markers were also correlated positively with viral loads in BAL on days 1–10 post-challenge ( Figure 7 B). Of note, the expression of these markers returned to normal levels around days 10–14, consistent with resolved infection in macaques.

Section: Discussion

SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques demonstrated thrombosis, endothelialitis, and endothelial disruption, analogous to the vascular disease in SARS-CoV-2-infected humans. Our histopathologic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses suggest a model in which upregulation of inflammatory and complement pathways leads to recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, activation of platelets and adhesion and aggregation at the site of vascular injury, and triggering of the coagulation cascade, resulting in endothelial damage and thrombosis.
We observed microthrombi in the alveolar septae of SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques and increased fibrin and vWF deposition in the lungs of infected animals ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ... Pulmonary Vascular Endothelialitis, Thrombosis, and Angiogenesis in Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2020; 383 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (3883) PubMed Google Scholar ; Trigonis et al., 2020 43.

Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients Receiving Prophylactic Anticoagulation Crit Care Med. 2020; 48 :e805-e808 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA and protein levels of vWF were also increased in peripheral blood and serum of infected animals ( Figures 2 C and 2D). We observed vascular intimal thickening with lymphocytic infiltrates, features of endothelialitis that have been observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected humans ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ... Pulmonary Vascular Endothelialitis, Thrombosis, and Angiogenesis in Covid-19 N Engl J Med. 2020; 383 :120-128 Crossref Scopus (3883) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as rapid and robust upregulation of molecular signatures associated with inflammation and thrombosis, including M1 macrophage infiltration in lung tissue ( Carsana et al., 2020 5. Carsana, L. ∙ Sonzogni, A. ∙ Nasr, A. ... Pulmonary post-mortem findings in a series of COVID-19 cases from northern Italy: a two-centre descriptive study Lancet Infect Dis. 2020; 20 :1135-1140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liao et al., 2020 25. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (1657) PubMed Google Scholar ) and signatures in BAL and peripheral blood of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 ( Mangalmurti and Hunter, 2020 31. Mangalmurti, N. ∙ Hunter, C.A. Cytokine Storms: Understanding COVID-19 Immunity. 2020; 53 :19-25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (460) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, our histopathologic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data suggest a critical role for complement, which may drive both inflammation and thrombosis ( Lo et al., 2020 27. Lo, M.W. ∙ Kemper, C. ∙ Woodruff, T.M. COVID-19: Complement, Coagulation, and Collateral Damage J Immunol. 2020; 205 :1488-1495 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid may specifically activate the complement cascade through direct binding to MASP-2 ( Noris et al., 2020 35. Noris, M. ∙ Benigni, A. ∙ Remuzzi, G. The case of complement activation in COVID-19 multiorgan impact Kidney Int. 2020; 98 :314-322 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our study, SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques exhibited increased C1R and C3 expression within the lung alveoli septae and vascular endothelium as well as increased complement C1R, C1S, and C3 levels in serum of infected macaques.
Similar to reports in infected humans, SARS-CoV-2 upregulated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in BAL and peripheral blood in macaques ( Figure 3 and 4 ). Human studies of interferon and ISGs in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have led to a diversity of outcomes ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 20. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients Science. 2020; 369 :712-718 Crossref Scopus (1923) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lucas et al., 2020 29. Lucas, C. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Klein, J. ..., Yale IMPACT Team Longitudinal analyses reveal immunological misfiring in severe COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 584 :463-469 Crossref Scopus (1404) PubMed Google Scholar ), potentially as a result of differences in clinical cohorts and disease severity. Rhesus macaques do not develop severe or lethal SARS-CoV-2 disease and thus cannot inform the pathogenesis of severe disease. Nevertheless, our data are consistent with the findings of upregulated IFNα genes and ISGs in humans with mild or moderate disease ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 20. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients Science. 2020; 369 :712-718 Crossref Scopus (1923) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the transition from high to low IFNα responses over time, likely reflecting resolving infection ( Lucas et al., 2020 29. Lucas, C. ∙ Wong, P. ∙ Klein, J. ..., Yale IMPACT Team Longitudinal analyses reveal immunological misfiring in severe COVID-19 Nature. 2020; 584 :463-469 Crossref Scopus (1404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies could assess the impact of age on pathophysiology in the macaque model.
Overall, our data suggest a key role for IFNα, proinflammatory cytokines, activated macrophages, and complement activation in triggering the endothelial damage and thrombosis observed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in rhesus macaques and suggest that cross-talk between the inflammatory and thrombosis pathways contributes to SARS-CoV-2-associated vascular disease ( Ackermann et al., 2020 1. Ackermann, M. ∙ Verleden, S.E. ∙ Kuehnel, M. ...

These data also suggest therapeutic targets in the interferon, inflammatory, coagulation, and complement pathways.

Patients’ families were consented for limited autopsies by a pathologist (JLH) during a witnessed phone call immediately after the death through referral from the intensive care unit (ICU). Research using autopsy tissue for this project was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center IRB (IRB protocol 2020P000525). A HIPAA waiver was granted by the institutional review board for access to the patients’ charts for each project using the tissue.
Patient 1 (91 years old, male, 10-day hospital course) presented with low-grade fever and malaise, and negative chest X-ray without pulmonary symptoms. His labs showed lymphopenia and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 110 mg/L Ferritin 1169 ng/mL) with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19. He had profound hypotension following hemodialysis sessions, and progressive decline in strength and mental status. He was transitioned to comfort measures and died on day 10. Autopsy findings were consistent with the clinical story showing lungs with patchy pulmonary edema and acute alveolar hemorrhage, but without significant inflammation. The spleen showed white pulp depletion and red pulp expansion. The heart showed non-specific patchy replacement fibrosis, but no acute changes or inflammation. The liver was normal and he had end stage kidneys.
Patient 2 (82 years old, female, 16-day hospital course) had a history of infarct-related dementia with aspiration pneumonia 1 month prior to admission. After an initial recovery, she represented with fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress requiring oxygen supplementation. She was septic with metabolic acidosis. After response to antibiotic and fluid resuscitation, she tested positive for COVID-19 by swab and was discharged to in-patient hospice where her respiratory status declined until death. Autopsy findings matched the clinical picture of lung injury and sepsis. The lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage. In less involved areas, a section showed a prominent septal lymphocytic infiltrate and type-II pneumocyte hyperplasia with multinucleated forms. Spleen had red pulp expansion and focal infarction. The heart showed no acute ischemic change, but there was a mild lymphocytic infiltrate between myocytes and around small vessels with rare microthrombi. Her liver showed central necrosis and kidneys showed acute tubular injury related to septic shock. Her kidneys showed changes related to her background chronic hypertension.
13 outbred, healthy, research-naive Indian-origin adult male and female rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ), 6-12 years old, were infected with SARS-CoV-2. All animals were singly housed in the ABSL3 facility at Bioqual, Inc. (Rockville, MD) and received routine veterinary care. Virus was administered as 1 mL by the intranasal (IN) route (0.5 mL in each nare) and 1 mL by the intratracheal (IT) route. A subset of macaques was necropsied on either day 2 (N = 2) or and day 4 (N = 2) following SARS-CoV-2 infection. All animal studies were conducted in compliance with all relevant local, state, and federal regulations and were approved by the Bioqual Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), EDTA anticoagulated blood, and serum samples were collected at baseline (pre-challenge) and on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. BAL samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 degrees at 2200 rpm, and the supernatant was aliquoted. Cells which were then resuspended in 100 uL RPMI and injected into the paxgene tubes. Tubes were wrapped in parafilm and frozen upright at −80C.
Tissues were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, and paraffin embedded within 7-10 days. Slides (5 μm sections) were baked for 30-60 min at 65 degrees then deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a series of graded ethanol to distilled water. For IL-6, IL-10, Von Willebrand Factor (vWF), TGFβ, collagen I, phospho-STAT3, CR1/CD35, complement component 3 (C3), Mx1, and phospho-MTOR IHC, staining was performed either manually or using a Biocare intelliPATH autostainer. Heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed with the antigen retrieval buffers citraconic anhydride (0.01% containing 0.05% Tween; for IL-10, collagen I, pSTAT3, TGFβ, CR1/CD35, Mx1, and p-mTOR), ACD P2 (ACD Cat. No. 322000; for IL-6 and VWF) or Tris-HCl (0.01M, pH 8.6; for C3) in a Biocare NxGen Decloaking Chamber at 110°C for 15 min, cooled for 20 min, then rinsed twice in ddH 2 O and 1x TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Slides were incubated with blocking buffer (TBS-T with 0.25% casein) for 30 min at room temperature (except for slides stained with antibodies against IL-10, vWF, and CR1/CD35), rinsed with TBS-T, and incubated at room temperature with antibodies against IL-6 (Sigma; Cat. No. SAB4301665), IL-10 (Santa Cruz; Cat. No. sc-8438), vWF (Abcam; Cat. No. ab179451), Mx1 (EMD Millipore Cat. No. MABF938; clone M143/CL143), phospho-STAT3 (Cell Signaling; Cat. No. 9145L), TGFβ (Abcam; Cat. No. ab215715), CR1/CD35 (Sigma; Cat. No. HPA049348), C3 (Sigma; Cat. No. HPA020432) and phospho-MTOR (Cell Signaling; Cat. No. 2976S), which were diluted in blocking buffer. An additional proteinase retrieval step, using 4 μg/mL of Proteinase K in a 0.02M Tris pH7.4, 2 μM CaCl2 buffer for 20 min at room temperature before blocking, is required for optimal staining against collagen I (Sigma; Cat. No. C2456). Endogenous peroxidases were blocked with 1.5% H 2 O 2 in TBS-T for 10 min. Slides were then incubated with Rabbit Polink-1 HRP (GBI Labs; Cat. No. D13-110; for VWF, TGFβ, and C3), Rabbit Polink-2 HRP (GBI Labs; Cat. No. D39-110; for IL-6, CR1/CD35, pSTAT3 and p-mTOR) or Mouse Polink-2 HRP (GBI Labs; Cat. No. D37-110; for IL-10, Mx1, and Collagen I). Slides were developed using Impact DAB (3,3¢-diaminobenzidine; Vector Laboratories), washed in ddH 2 O, counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific), and scanned at 20x magnification on an Aperio AT2 (Leica Biosystems).
Special Stains. Lung sections were stained to identify fibrin and platelets using Carstairs’ Method per supplier’s recommendations. Briefly, slides were cut at 2 μm, deparaffinized, rehydrated and sequentially stained as follows: 1) Ferric ammonium sulfate, 5% (Rowley Biochemical F-381-1) for 5 min then rinsed in tap water 2) Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Rowley Biochemical F-381-2) for 5 min then rinsed in running tap water 3) Picric Acid-Orange G Solution (Rowley Biochemical F-381-3) for 30 min and rinsed in distilled water 4) Ponceau Fuchsin solution (Rowley Biochemical F-381-4) for 5 min and rinsed in distilled water 5) Phosphotungstic Acid 1% (Rowley Biochemical F-381-5), 2 changes, 5 s each and rinsed in distilled water 6) Aniline Blue Solution (Rowley Biochemical F-381-6) for 30 min, rinsed in distilled water, dehydrated and coverslipped. To identify elastic fibers of blood vessels, Verhoeff’s Van Gieson’s Method (vvG) was used. Slides were cut at 5 μm, deparaffinized, rehydrated and sequentially stained as follows using freshly prepared 10% working solution of vvG as indicated per supplier’s recommendations (Rowley Biochemical F-374-1): 1) Stain in Working Verhoeff’s Solution for one h then rinse in 2changes tap water 2) differentiate in Ferric Chloride 10% agitating gently for 2 dips then rinse in distilled water 3) treat with Sodium Thiosulfate 5% (Rowley BiochemicalF-374-5) for 1 min then rinse in running tap water for 5minutes 4) counterstain in Van Gieson’s solution (Rowley Biochemical F-374-6) for 5 min, then dehydrate and coverslip. Tissue pathology was assessed independently by two veterinary pathologists (AJM and ADM).
Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CyCIF) was performed as previously described ( Lin et al., 2018 26. Lin, J.R. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Wang, S. ... Highly multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of human tissues and tumors using t-CyCIF and conventional optical microscopes eLife. 2018; 7 :e31657 Crossref Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, paraformaldehyde fixed specimens on glass slides were dewaxed and antigen retrieval performed on a Leica Bond RX. Slides were then subjected to CyCIF using the antibodies described in the STAR methods. Slides were scanned with a RareCyte CyteFinder scanner equipped with a 20x, 0.8 NA objective and images then corrected for uneven illumination using the BaSiC tool. Flat-field-corrected images were processed using ASHLAR.
Serum & BAL samples from multiple time points were thawed at room temperature, quickly vortexed for 10 s, then centrifuged to pellet and remove debris. Samples were then analyzed in duplicate using Cytokine/Chemokine/Growth Factor 37-Plex NHP ProcartaPlexTM Panel (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 200 μL of bead mix solution were added to all wells and washed using a Bio-Plex Pro Wash Station (BIORAD). 25 μL of Universal Assay Buffer was added to all wells, then 25 μL of samples/standards/blanks (blanks utilize universal assay buffer) were added to the relevant wells, following a 2 h incubation on an orbital shaker (400-500rpm) at room temperature. Plates are then washed on the magnetic plate washer, and 25 μL of prepared detection antibody was added to all wells following a 30 m incubation, with agitation, at room temperature. Plates were washed again, following 50 μL of provided Streptavidin-PE solution was added to all wells, 30 m incubation with agitation at room temperature. Once complete, the plates were again washed using the magnetic plate washer, inactivation was then performed using a 10% Formalin solution (VWR), using 100 μL per well, overnight1. Plates were run on a Bio-Plex® 200 System (BIORAD), which was preprogrammed according to kit specifications for optimal signal detection. Raw data were analyzed using R to test for any significant increase or decrease in cytokines and chemokines levels in serum and BAL of SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 post-challenge compared to baseline, we used the using the non-parametric Wilcoxon t test implemented in R.
The SomaScan® Platform for proteomics profiling uses 4979 SOMAmer® reagents, single-stranded DNA aptamers, to 4776 unique Human Protein Targets ( https://www.somalogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SSM-002-Rev-3-SOMAscan-Technical-White-Paper.pdf ). Cross-reactivity for non-human primate proteins to reagents developed to human protein targets is assumed when differential signal is observed. The assay used standard controls including 12 hybridization normalization control sequences used to control for variability in the Agilent readout process as well as 5 human calibrator controls and 3 quality controls used to mitigate batch effects and verify the quality of the assay run using standard acceptance criteria. The SomaScan® Assay is run using 96 well plates; eleven wells are allocated for control samples used to control for batch effects and to estimate the accuracy, precision, and buffer background of the Assay over time. Five pooled Calibrator replicates, three pooled Quality Control (QC) replicates, and three buffer replicates are run on every plate. The readout is performed using Agilent hybridization, scan, and feature extraction technology. Twelve Hybridization Control SOMAmers are added alongside SOMAmers to be measured from the biological samples and controls of each well during the SOMAmer elution step to control for readout variability. The control samples are run repeatedly during assay qualification and robust point estimates are generated and stored as references for each SOMAmer result for the Calibrator and QC samples. Plate Calibration is performed by calculating the ratio of the Calibrator Reference RFU value to the plate-specific Calibrator replicate median RFU value for each SOMAmer. The resulting ratio distribution is decomposed into a Plate Scale factor defined by the median of the distribution and a vector of SOMAmer-specific Calibration Scale Factors. Normalization of QC replicates and Samples is performed using adaptive normalization by maximum likelihood (ANML) with point and variance estimates from a normal U.S. population. Post calibration accuracy is estimated using the ratio of the QC reference RFU value to the plate-specific QC replicate median RFU value for each SOMAmer. The resulting QC ratio distribution provides a robust estimate of accuracy for each SOMAmer on every plate. Plate-specific Acceptance Criteria: Plate Scale Factor between 0.4-2.5 and 85% of QC ratios between 0.8 and 1.2 must be met prior to release. The raw data were uploaded into R using the SomaDataIO R package provided by the company Somalogic. Quality control (QC), visualization, and manipulation of the raw data were also performed using internal functions implemented in the SomaDataIO R package. We used the R function adat2eSet to convert the raw data into an expression set object. Differential expression analysis of proteins increased or decreased by SARS-CoV-2 on days 1, 2, 4, 10 and 14 compared to baseline, was performed in R using the limma package. Significant expressed proteins were selected after correcting for multiple testing via Benjamini-Hochberg method over all tests for each gene pair. All Day 7 samples and 5 samples from day 10 post challenge were discarded from the analysis because of technical issues during their processing.
RNA was isolated from blood and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) samples stored in Paxgene tubes in a BSL-3 facility at the Yerkes National Primate Center before being transferred to a BSL-2 lab for library preparation ( http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/nhp_genomics_core/ ). RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation and concentration via the RNA HS assay on the Qubit. Globin transcripts in the blood RNA were blocked with the FastSelect Globin Reagent (QIAGEN) prior to library preparation. Libraries were prepared using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio) in combination with the NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation kit to append dual-indexed adaptor sequences (Illumina). Libraries were validated by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation, pooled at equimolar concentrations, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 at 100SR, yielding 25-30 million reads per sample.
Peripheral blood and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) raw reads were examined for quality issues using FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ) to ensure library generation and sequencing are suitable for further analysis. Reads were aligned using STAR v2.7.3. The STAR index was built by combining genome sequences for Macaca mulatta, SARS-CoV-2 and ERCC sequences. We used the macaques genome reference Macaca mulatta - MacaM ( https://www.unmc.edu/rhesusgenechip/index.htm ). The genome sequence for SARS-CoV2 (strain MN985325.1) was downloaded from NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN985325 ). The gff3 file for SARS-CoV2 was converted to gtf using gffread utility ( https://github.com/gpertea/gffread ). The generated gtf file for SARS-CoV2 was edited to include exon entries which had the same coordinates as CDS to get counts with STAR. The combined genomic and gtf files were used for generating the STAR index for MacaM. The counts of reads aligning to annotated genes was obtained from STAR ReadsPerGene files. We used DESeq2 (Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-Seq data with DESeq2) internal filtering algorithm called “independentFiltering” that sets a threshold on the mean of normalized counts of all samples (baseMean > 10) in order to maximize the number of tests that pass multiple test correction. DESeq2 was used to generate the normalized read count table based on their estimateSizeFactors() function with default parameters by calculating a pseudo-reference sample of the geometric means for each gene across all samples and then use the “median ratio” of each sample to the pseudo-reference as the sizeFactor for that sample. The sizeFactor is then applied to each gene’s raw count to get the normalized count for that gene. Differential expression at the gene level were performed by DESeq2 implemented in the DESeq2 R package, using counts per gene generated by a custom script that pulls out the library prep abundance estimation column into files, and read those files into DESeq2 with the DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount() function. A corrected p value cut-off of 0.05 was used to assess significant genes that were upregulated or downregulated by SARS-Cov2 on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 compared to baseline in blood and BAL using Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method.
Gene set enrichment analysis and a compendium of databases of biological and immunological pathways were used to test the longitudinal enrichment of pathways and transcription factors (TFs) target signatures in peripheral blood, BAL and serum samples on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 post-challenge compared to baseline. Genes were pre-ranked by fold change from the highest to the lowest and GSEA was used to assess the enrichment of selected gene sets. Thrombosis signatures ( Figure 2 ) were compiled from the MSigDB curated C2 gene sets, IPA ingenuity pathway analysis https://targetexplorer.ingenuity.com ) and were manually curated in-house by checking the individual function of each gene using GeneCard data base ( https://www.genecards.org/ ). Cytokines signaling, immune cell signatures, and molecular pathways were compiled from the MSigDB Hallmark, C2, C7 and C3 gene sets ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp ), IPA ingenuity pathway analysis https://targetexplorer.ingenuity.com ), and the blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) ( Li et al., 2014 24. Li, S. ∙ Rouphael, N. ∙ Duraisingham, S. ... Molecular signatures of antibody responses derived from a systems biology study of five human vaccines Nat Immunol. 2014; 15 :195-204 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GSEA Java desktop program was downloaded from the Broad Institute ( https://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp ) and used with GSEA Pre-Ranked module parameters (number of permutations: 1,000; enrichment statistic: weighted; minimal number of genes = 10; maximal number of genes = 5000). Sample-level enrichment analysis ( Gundem and Lopez-Bigas, 2012 19. Gundem, G. ∙ Lopez-Bigas, N. Sample-level enrichment analysis unravels shared stress phenotypes among multiple cancer types Genome Med. 2012; 4 :28 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to investigate the enrichment of pathways in each individual animal. Briefly, the expression of all the genes in a specific pathway was averaged across samples and compared to the average expression of 1,000 randomly generated gene sets of the same size. The resulting Z score was then used to reflect the overall perturbation of each pathway in each individual sample.
The canonical pathway and upstream regulator functions of IPA core expression analysis tool (QIAGEN) were used to interrogate the lists of genes and proteins upregulated or downregulated by SARS-Cov2 on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14. Canonical pathways and upstream regulators were considered significant if pathway activation Z-Score >2 and pathway overlap corrected p value < 0.05 (using the Benjamini-Hochberg method). Functional analysis of statistically significant gene and proteins changes, was performed using Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base (IPA; Ingenuity Systems). For all gene set enrichment analyses, a right-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate P values associated with each biological function and canonical pathway. Upstream Regulator Analysis in IPA was used to predict regulators and infer their activation state based on prior knowledge of expected effects between regulators and their known target genes or proteins according to the Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IKB). The calculated z-score signifies whether gene or protein expression changes for known targets of each regulator are consistent with what is expected from the literature (z > 2, regulator predicted to be activated, z < −2, regulator predicted to inhibited). Causal Network Analysis in IPA was used to understand gene expression changes and causal relationships between genes and networks of upstream regulators. The genes within the causal network represent nodes and the edge that defines the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an arrow signifying regulation. Dashed arrows represent indirect relationships and solid arrows represent direct relationships. All edges are supported by at least one published reference or from canonical information stored in IKB ( https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis ).
For GSEA analysis, all significant pathways and molecular signatures, increased or decreased by SARS-CoV-2 on days 1-14, were selected using a false discovery rate < 20 and a nominal p value < 0.05. In IPA Global Canonical Pathways (GCP), a multiple-testing corrected p value was calculated using the Benjamini- Hochberg (BH) method.
We analyzed data from nine (n = 9) rhesus macaques. Quality of BAL and peripheral blood raw reads were examined using FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ ) and reads were aligned using STAR v2.7.3. Differential expression at the gene level were performed by DESeq2 implemented in the DESeq2 R package. A corrected p value of 0.05 was used to assess significant genes that were upregulated or downregulated by SARS-Cov2 on days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 compared to baseline in blood and BAL using Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. Increase or decrease levels of cytokines and chemokines in BAL and serum were evaluated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test implemented in R. Serum proteomics was measured using the SomaScan platform. Quality control (QC), visualization, and manipulation of the raw data were performed using the SomaDataIO R package. Pathways enrichment and upstream regulators analyses were analyzed through the use of ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) (QIAGEN Inc., https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis ) and the GSEA Desktop v4.0.3 from ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp ). For data presentation, we used a collection of tools including Cytoscape version 3.6.0 ( https://cytoscape.org ), GeneMANIA version 3.3.1 ( http://genemania.org ) and Genecards ( https://www.genecards.org ). Where indicated on the figures, all pvalues were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bejamini-Hochberg method (BH). Pathways and gene signatures shown in main Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 and in supplementary figures S5B-C, S6B and S7 where generated using GSEA and selected with a false discovery rate q value cutoff < 0.20 and a nominal pvalue < 0.05. Signatures shown in figure S5A, were generated using IPA and a BH-adjusted p < 0.05 and Z-score > 2. All statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical software 3.5.1. Graphic abstract was generated using Biorender.com .
