Title: Dysregulation of ILC3s unleashes progression and immunotherapy resistance in colon cancer


Abstract: Summary

Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate immunity and inflammation, yet their role in cancer remains elusive. Here, we identify that colorectal cancer (CRC) manifests with altered ILC3s that are characterized by reduced frequencies, increased plasticity, and an imbalance with T cells. We evaluated the consequences of these changes in mice and determined that a dialog between ILC3s and T cells via major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) is necessary to support colonization with microbiota that subsequently induce type-1 immunity in the intestine and tumor microenvironment. As a result, mice lacking ILC3-specific MHCII develop invasive CRC and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Finally, humans with dysregulated intestinal ILC3s harbor microbiota that fail to induce type-1 immunity and immunotherapy responsiveness when transferred to mice. Collectively, these data define a protective role for ILC3s in cancer and indicate that their inherent disruption in CRC drives dysfunctional adaptive immunity, tumor progression, and immunotherapy resistance.

This occurs through a number of well-described mechanisms, and vaccination is an important approach to prevent these infection-associated cancers ( Grivennikov et al., 2010 41.

In contrast, mammals are continuously colonized with trillions of normally beneficial microbes, termed the microbiota, that also substantially impact cancer, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood ( Dzutsev et al., 2017 31.

One important connection with cancer is the ability of the microbiota to modulate the immune system and promote chronic inflammation ( Belkaid and Hand, 2014 8. Belkaid, Y. ∙ Hand, T.W.

Cancer and inflammation: an old intuition with rapidly evolving new concepts Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30 :677-706 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). This can occur in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is associated with a loss of immunologic tolerance, the development of inflammatory immune responses directed against intestinal microbiota ( Maloy and Powrie, 2011 64.

Beaugerie, L. ∙ Itzkowitz, S.H. Cancers complicating inflammatory bowel disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :1441-1452 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, most CRC cases develop independently of IBD and yet are still directly linked with substantial microbiota-dependent engagement of inflammatory pathways, such as the cytokine interleukin (IL)-23 and associated T helper (T H )17 cell responses ( Langowski et al., 2006 55.

It remains poorly defined how malignant transformation in the intestine promotes these inflammatory responses to the microbiota, and the development of novel strategies to prevent this outcome could be beneficial in CRC.
Emerging evidence indicates that microbiota also substantially impacts the responsiveness of tumors to therapies, including revolutionary immune checkpoint blockade ( Iida et al., 2013 51.

Provocative data from these studies demonstrated that the microbiota is required for the success of checkpoint blockade in mouse models, and further, that the composition or presence of specific microbes in patient populations are sufficient to augment therapeutic outcome when transferred to germ-free or antibiotics (ABX)-treated recipient mice ( Vétizou et al., 2015 97.

Moreover, recent studies demonstrated that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may be harnessed as a method to boost responsiveness to checkpoint blockade in resistant cancer patients ( Baruch et al., 2021 5. Baruch, E.N. ∙ Youngster, I. ∙ Ben-Betzalel, G. ...

Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :595-602 Crossref Scopus (805) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies provide one explanation for the variable response of individual cancer patients or tumor types to checkpoint blockade therapy ( Sharma et al., 2017 82.

Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3421) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, CRC and other gastrointestinal cancers demonstrate a remarkably poor response to checkpoint blockade, with a notable exception of tumors harboring high microsatellite instability ( Le et al., 2015 56. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7340) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies provoke a number of fundamental gaps in knowledge, including a need to define the mechanisms by which the microbiota regulates checkpoint blockade, the pathways that control colonization with beneficial microbes, as well as the relevance of these findings to CRC patients who are known to exhibit microbiota dysbiosis and resistance to checkpoint blockade ( Brennan and Garrett, 2016 16.

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently appreciated family of tissue-resident innate lymphocytes that play critical roles in regulating host-microbe interactions at mucosal barrier surfaces of the mammalian body ( Artis and Spits, 2015 3. Artis, D. ∙ Spits, H. The biology of innate lymphoid cells Nature. 2015; 517 :293-301 Crossref Scopus (1271) PubMed Google Scholar ; Colonna, 2018 23. Colonna, M.

In particular, group 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are innate counterparts of T H 17 cells, express retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt), are enriched in the intestine, and regulate interactions with the microbiota through production of cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 ( Sonnenberg and Artis, 2015 86.

Innate Lymphoid Cells: 10 Years On Cell. 2018; 174 :1054-1066 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1406) PubMed Google Scholar ). ILC3s also play a broader role in modulating adaptive immunity through direct cellular interactions with T cells ( Sonnenberg and Hepworth, 2019 87. Sonnenberg, G.F. ∙ Hepworth, M.R. Functional interactions between innate lymphoid cells and adaptive immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :599-613 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CCR6 + lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like subset of ILC3s express major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) and have the potential to process and present antigens to CD4 T cells ( von Burg et al., 2014 100. von Burg, N. ∙ Chappaz, S. ∙ Baerenwaldt, A. ...

Many of these studies were necessarily performed using mice that lack adaptive immunity, raising questions about whether cross-talk between ILC3 and adaptive immunity is also important in cancer ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 44.

The immune contexture and Immunoscore in cancer prognosis and therapeutic efficacy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2020; 20 :662-680 Crossref Scopus (898) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we hypothesize that ILC3s are involved in the regulation of adaptive immunity, the control of host-microbiota interactions, and the progression or therapeutic responsiveness of tumors in the context of CRC.

Section: Results

We performed a comprehensive analysis of ILCs from resected colorectal tumors, adenomas, and matched-adjacent non-malignant tissues from a cohort of 72 individuals. The clinical and histopathologic characteristics of this cohort are described in Table S1 . ILCs were identified by gating on viable CD45 + cells that lack lineage markers and express CD127. We subsequently gated for CRTH2 and CD117 to distinguish all ILC subsets ( Figure 1 A) as previously described ( Bernink et al., 2013 10. Bernink, J.H. ∙ Peters, C.P. ∙ Munneke, M. ...

Immunol. 2016; 17 :451-460 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). ILC3s were dominant among total ILCs within both non-inflamed adjacent and tumor tissues ( Figure 1 A), however, tumor tissues exhibited a significant decrease in ILC3s and a concomitant increase in ILC1s ( Figure 1 B). The frequency of ILC3s among CD45 + cells was also significantly decreased within tumors relative to matched non-malignant adjacent tissues ( Figure S1 A). We further observed a similar pattern in pre-cancerous adenoma tissues ( Figures 1 C and S1 B). These alterations in ILC3s from colorectal tumors and adenomas were comparable to what is observed within inflamed tissues of patients with IBD ( Figures 1 D and S1 C), and is consistent with chronic inflammation documented in the tumor microenvironment of CRC ( Mantovani et al., 2008 65.

We next examined a spontaneous mouse model of colonic adenoma-carcinoma by crossing CDX2 Cre with APCmin floxed/floxed mice (CDX2 Cre -APCmin +/F ) ( Hinoi et al., 2007 48. Hinoi, T. ∙ Akyol, A. ∙ Theisen, B.K. ... Mouse model of colonic adenoma-carcinoma progression based on somatic Apc inactivation Cancer Res. 2007; 67 :9721-9730 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). ILCs lacking lineage markers and expressing CD90.2 and CD127 were identified within the colon adenoma of CDX2 Cre -APCmin +/F mice and further gated into ILC1s, ILC2s, and ILC3s ( Figure 1 E). Consistent with human samples, a significant decrease of ILC3 frequencies among total ILCs and a concomitant but non-significant ILC1 increase was observed in adenomas relative to the non-malignant colon ( Figure 1 F). In contrast with human, ILC subsets are dominantly represented by ILC2s in the mouse colon, but their frequency was not altered in tumors ( Figure 1 F). Further, the frequency of all ILC subsets was significantly decreased among CD45 + cells within the adenoma relative to non-malignant colon ( Figure 1 F). A similar reduction in ILC3s occurred in a chemically induced CRC model ( Figures S1 D–S1G). Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that infiltrating ILC3s within spontaneously developing or chemically induced mouse adenomas selectively localized within lymphoid aggregates (resembling induced-tertiary lymphoid structures) arising at the invasive margin of the tumor microenvironment ( Figures 1 G and S1 H). We further detected ILC3s that localized closely with T cells within these structures suggesting the possibility of cell-cell interactions ( Figures 1 G and S1 H). Altogether, these results indicate that both human and experimental mouse CRC manifests with substantially altered ILC3s that are present at reduced frequencies relative to adjacent tissues and localize primarily within tertiary lymphoid structures.
To define how ILC3s change in the context of human CRC, we sort-purified these cells and performed transcriptional profiling by RNA sequencing. For all the samples, we validated an abundant expression of ILC-related ( IL2RA , IL2RG , IL7R , and RORA ) and ILC3-related ( IL1R1 , RORC , IL23R , ID2 , and KIT ) transcripts as previously described ( Björklund et al., 2016 14. Björklund, Å.K. ∙ Forkel, M. ∙ Picelli, S. ... The heterogeneity of human CD127(+) innate lymphoid cells revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :451-460 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as low expression of specific transcripts related to other cellular lineages ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). Unbiased principal component analysis (PCA) revealed significantly distinct clustering between ILC3s isolated from CRC tumors versus matched adjacent tissues ( Figure 2 B). One distinction is the appearance of an ILC1-related gene signature selectively in tumor-infiltrating ILC3s, including a significant increase of CXCR3 , SH2D1A , IL6R , CD28 , and TNFRSF1B transcripts ( Figure 2 C), suggesting that ILC3s are actively transitioning to an ILC1 phenotype as reported in other contexts ( Cella et al., 2019 20. Cella, M. ∙ Gamini, R. ∙ Sécca, C. ... Subsets of ILC3-ILC1-like cells generate a diversity spectrum of innate lymphoid cells in human mucosal tissues Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :980-991 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mazzurana et al., 2019 69. Mazzurana, L. ∙ Forkel, M. ∙ Rao, A. ... Suppression of Aiolos and Ikaros expression by lenalidomide reduces human ILC3-ILC1/NK cell transdifferentiation Eur. J. Immunol. 2019; 49 :1344-1355 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, tumor-infiltrating ILC3s exhibited a significant increase of ILC1-related and cytotoxic genes that are gradually expressed during an ILC3-to-ILC1 transition ( Cella et al., 2019 20. Cella, M. ∙ Gamini, R. ∙ Sécca, C. ... Subsets of ILC3-ILC1-like cells generate a diversity spectrum of innate lymphoid cells in human mucosal tissues Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :980-991 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ), including TIGIT , CD247 , CD244 , SIRPG , PRF1 , GNLY , GZMA , GZMB , and GZMK ( Figure 2 D). Conversely, we observed a significant decrease of IL1R1 , IL2 , IL22 , CCL20 , CSF2 , FOXO1 , TNFSF13B , and ZBTB24 ( Figure 2 D), a group of ILC3-associated genes that are downregulated during an ILC1 transition ( Cella et al., 2019 20. Cella, M. ∙ Gamini, R. ∙ Sécca, C. ... Subsets of ILC3-ILC1-like cells generate a diversity spectrum of innate lymphoid cells in human mucosal tissues Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :980-991 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcripts for Aiolos ( IKZF3 ), a transcriptional regulator that favors ILC1 conversion, and the downstream target MYC were also overexpressed in tumor-infiltrating ILC3s ( Figure 2 D).
We utilized a previously described protocol to quantify several intermediate cellular states (ILC3a > ILC3b > ILC1b > ILC1a) in the spectrum of ILC3-to-ILC1 transition ( Cella et al., 2019 20. Cella, M. ∙ Gamini, R. ∙ Sécca, C. ... Subsets of ILC3-ILC1-like cells generate a diversity spectrum of innate lymphoid cells in human mucosal tissues Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :980-991 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a cohort of 20 patients, we identified that CRC tumors contain a significant decrease of an ILC3a population and a concomitant significant increase of an ILC1a population, in both frequency and total cell numbers relative to adjacent non-malignant tissues ( Figures 2 E and S2 B). We further observed a progressive decrease of the ILC3-related markers IL-1R, CD117, and CD127 in ILC3a and total ILC3s, as well as an increase of the ILC1-transitioning markers CD39 and SIRPγ in the ILC3a population ( Figures 2 F and S2 C). We further confirmed an increase of ILC1-related markers CD39, CD244, and SIRPγ within the ILC1a population ( Figure 2 F).
The transcriptional identity of ILC3s in CRC was also altered, including a significant increase of transcripts related to antigen presentation, co-stimulation, cell migration, inhibitory receptors, proliferation, and cytokine signaling ( Figure S2 D). Interestingly, we detected a group of genes ( CD244 , CD274 , CTLA4 , PDCD1 , and PDCD1LG2 ) related to an “exhaustion-like” phenotype previously described in T cells ( Figure S2 D). A previous single-cell RNA sequencing approach suggested that human ILC3s exhibit three distinct populations, consisting of cytokine-producing NKp44 + ILC3s, naive-like CD45RA + ILC3s, and NKp44 − CD45RA − ILC3s ( Björklund et al., 2016 14. Björklund, Å.K. ∙ Forkel, M. ∙ Picelli, S. ... The heterogeneity of human CD127(+) innate lymphoid cells revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :451-460 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ). Utilizing flow cytometry ( Figure 2 G), we identified that NKp44 + ILC3s, which are the dominant subset in non-malignant colon, are significantly decreased in adenomas and tumors ( Figures 2 H and S2 E), consistent with this population converting to an ILC1 phenotype ( Bernink et al., 2013 10. Bernink, J.H. ∙ Peters, C.P. ∙ Munneke, M. ... Human type 1 innate lymphoid cells accumulate in inflamed mucosal tissues Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :221-229 Crossref Scopus (827) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cella et al., 2019 20. Cella, M. ∙ Gamini, R. ∙ Sécca, C. ... Subsets of ILC3-ILC1-like cells generate a diversity spectrum of innate lymphoid cells in human mucosal tissues Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :980-991 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, we detected a significant increase in CD45RA + ILC3s in tumors, while the proportion of NKp44 − CD45RA − ILC3s was significantly higher in both tumors and adenomas relative to adjacent tissues ( Figures 2 H and S2 E).
We examined experimental mouse CRC and observed comparable changes in ILC3 subsets, including a significant decrease in NKp46 + ILC3s and a significant increase in CCR6 + ILC3s ( Figures 2 I, 2J, and S2 F). We also confirmed an increased staining of PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating ILCs in CRC ( Figure S2 G) and fate-mapping experiments revealed that a substantial portion of colonic ILC3s lost RORγt protein (converting to a so-called “ex-ILC3”) in a chemically induced CRC model ( Figure S2 H). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ILC3s within CRC are fundamentally altered, exhibiting reduced frequencies, altered subset heterogeneity, and increased plasticity toward ILC1s or ex-ILC3s.
We next assessed the interactions between ILC3s and adaptive immunity in CRC and observed a significant increase in the ratio of T cells to ILC3s in tumors relative to non-malignant adjacent tissues, and this is associated with an increase in the frequency of T H 17 cells and decrease in the frequency of T H 1 cells ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). A similar pattern was found within pre-cancerous adenoma tissues ( Figure 3 B) and inflamed tissues from IBD patients ( Figure 3 C). We previously reported that ILC3s limit T H 17 cells and intestinal inflammation through direct interactions via MHCII ( Hepworth et al., 2013 46. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Fung, T.C. ... Innate lymphoid cells regulate CD4+ T-cell responses to intestinal commensal bacteria Nature. 2013; 498 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 47. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Fung, T.C. ∙ Masur, S.H. ... Immune tolerance. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate intestinal selection of commensal bacteria-specific CD4 + T cells Science. 2015; 348 :1031-1035 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ). Examination of MHCII expression on ILC3s in our human samples revealed an overall increase in HLA-DR ( Figure S3 B); however, the ratio of CD4 T cells to MHCII + ILC3s remained significantly increased in CRC ( Figures 3 D and S3 C). In our mouse models, ILC3s were the dominant MHCII + innate lymphocytes ( Figure S3 D) and it was possible to detect MHCII + ILC3s at tertiary lymphoid structures within CRC ( Figure S3 E). Further, the overall ratio of CD4 T cells to MHCII + ILC3s was also increased relative to adjacent tissues ( Figures 3 E, 3F, S3 F, and S3 G). This suggests that there is a disruption in the dialog between MHCII + ILC3s and T cells in CRC.
Although MHCII + ILC3s can limit T H 17 cells ( Hepworth et al., 2013 46. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Fung, T.C. ... Innate lymphoid cells regulate CD4+ T-cell responses to intestinal commensal bacteria Nature. 2013; 498 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 47. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Fung, T.C. ∙ Masur, S.H. ... Immune tolerance. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate intestinal selection of commensal bacteria-specific CD4 + T cells Science. 2015; 348 :1031-1035 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ), it remains unclear if there is a link between these populations and the altered T H 1 cell response in CRC. To directly explore this, we examined the colon of mice with an ILC3-specific deletion of MHCII (MHCII ΔILC3 ). In this context, we observed a significant decrease of T H 1 cells, as well as T-bet + CD8 T cells within the colon relative to controls ( Figure 3 G). We hypothesized that this broad impact on type-1 immunity is indirect and results from T cell-dependent alterations in the microbiota. Indeed, recent reports demonstrated that specific microbiota supports T H 1 cell and CD8 T cell immunity in the gut ( Atarashi et al., 2017 4. Atarashi, K. ∙ Suda, W. ∙ Luo, C. ... Ectopic colonization of oral bacteria in the intestine drives T H 1 cell induction and inflammation Science. 2017; 358 :359-365 Crossref Scopus (586) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018 40. Gopalakrishnan, V. ∙ Spencer, C.N. ∙ Nezi, L. ... Gut microbiome modulates response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients Science. 2018; 359 :97-103 Crossref Scopus (3065) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tanoue et al., 2019 89. Tanoue, T. ∙ Morita, S. ∙ Plichta, D.R. ... A defined commensal consortium elicits CD8 T cells and anti-cancer immunity Nature. 2019; 565 :600-605 Crossref Scopus (746) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this hypothesis, we performed 16S sequencing and determined that MHCII ΔILC3 mice exhibit significantly distinct microbiota from littermate controls ( Figure S3 H). Altered T cell responses promoted this phenotype, because transfer of colonic CD4 T cells from MHCII ΔILC3 mice was sufficient to induce greater compositional changes in the microbiota of recipient Rag1 −/− mice relative to recipients receiving CD4 T cells from littermate controls ( Figures 3 H and S3 H). We further observed that FMT from MHCII ΔILC3 mice into ABX-treated wild-type recipient mice induced significantly lower frequencies of colonic T H 1 and T-bet + CD8 T cells relative to recipients of FMT from littermate controls ( Figure 3 I). Overall, our results demonstrate that a dialog between MHCII + ILC3s and CD4 T cells is disrupted in CRC, and that these cellular interactions are necessary for immunologic homeostasis in the gut, subsequently supporting colonization of microbiota that promotes type-1 immunity.
We next directly examined how MHCII + ILC3s impact experimental CRC. Strikingly, deletion of ILC3-specific MHCII resulted in significantly higher weight loss over the course of the experiment, increased spleen weight, and reduced colon length ( Figures S4 A–S4C). We further confirmed that this mouse model remained selective to ILC3s and does not target MHCII on other innate or adaptive immune cells ( Figure S4 D). MHCII ΔILC3 mice also exhibited a significant decrease of colonic T H 1 and T-bet + CD8 T cells in this CRC model ( Figure 4 A). Although littermate controls exhibit typical luminal polyps selectively localized at the distal colon, MHCII ΔILC3 mice display significantly reduced number, size, and load of macroscopically visible polyps ( Figures 4 B and 4C). However, histological analyses revealed that MHCII ΔILC3 mice were not protected from tumorigenesis and rather displayed highly differentiated and invasive β-catenin + adenocarcinoma that predominantly arises within the submucosa and the muscularis of the colon ( Figure 4 D), corresponding with more aggressive progression of CRC. These highly invasive and flat colorectal tumors have been reported in CRC patients, are associated with IBD, and are difficult to clinically manage ( Bressenot et al., 2014 17. Bressenot, A. ∙ Cahn, V. ∙ Danese, S. ... Microscopic features of colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel diseases World J. Gastroenterol. 2014; 20 :3164-3172 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Beaugerie and Itzkowitz, 2015 7. Beaugerie, L. ∙ Itzkowitz, S.H. Cancers complicating inflammatory bowel disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :1441-1452 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). Blinded histopathologic analyses revealed that MHCII ΔILC3 mice exhibited a significantly increased dysplasia score ( Figure 4 E), characterized by the development of adenocarcinoma, an overall increased dysplasia involvement in the entire colon, and invasive tumorigenesis ( Figure 4 F) in the submucosa layers of the colon as compared to littermate controls.
These findings were not specific to the chemically induced model, because MHCII ΔILC3 mice crossed with the APC min/+ CRC model (MHCII ΔILC3 -APC min/+ ) also resulted in a similar increased dysplasia score ( Figure 4 G) and a higher number of advanced tumors ( Figure 4 H). Further, MHCII ΔILC3 -APC min/+ mice exhibited a significant reduction in overall survival relative to littermates ( Figure 4 I). These results collectively demonstrate that an appropriate dialog between MHCII + ILC3s and T cells is necessary to preserve type-1 immunity in the context of cancer, thus limiting susceptibility to highly invasive colon tumors.
We next investigated whether this ILC3 dialog with T cells and the microbiota impacts checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. To address this question, we subcutaneously implanted the MC38 colon tumor cell line into littermate control and MHCII ΔILC3 mice. In this context, we observed that ILC3-specific MHCII did not impact tumor growth ( Figure S5 A). In contrast, when we treated these mice with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), we observed that tumors are robustly controlled in littermate controls, whereas MHCII ΔILC3 mice exhibited a significant resistance ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Comparable results were observed in the melanoma B16-F10 model ( Figures S5 B and S5C). To explore the mechanisms by which this occurs, we profiled the implanted tumor microenvironment. Although ILC3s did not infiltrate the tumor in this subcutaneous model ( Figure S5 D), we observed that MHCII ΔILC3 mice exhibited a striking decrease in both T H 1 cells and T-bet + CD8 T cells within the MC38 tumor ( Figure 5 C). Following anti-PD-1 mAb treatment, there was also a significant increase in responding PD-1 + CD8 T cells in littermate controls, as previously reported ( Wei et al., 2017 103. Wei, S.C. ∙ Levine, J.H. ∙ Cogdill, A.P. ... Distinct Cellular Mechanisms Underlie Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Checkpoint Blockade Cell. 2017; 170 :1120-1133.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas there was a lack of response in MHCII ΔILC3 mice ( Figure 5 D). Thus, MHCII + ILC3s also support type-1 immunity in a systemic context and prevent T cell resistance to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies.
MC38-implanted MHCII ΔILC3 mice exhibited a comparable α-diversity but significant and consistent changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota that were independent of anti-PD-1 mAb treatment ( Figures 5 E, 5F, S5 E, and S5F). Compositional changes included bacteria from the Bacteroidales and Clostridiales orders, with increased abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in MHCII ΔILC3 mice belonging to the Bacteroides genus and Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae families. We also observed a decrease of OTUs from the Clostridiales and Bacteroidales orders ( Table S2 ). Further, FMT of the microbiota from non-responsive MHCII ΔILC3 mice was sufficient to transfer significant resistance to anti-PD-1 mAb treatment in wild-type germ-free recipient mice ( Figures 5 G and 5H). We also tested whether we could recapitulate this by inducing intestinal inflammation alone. We accomplished this with repeated exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a context where we observe a significant decrease in colonic ILC3s ( Figure S5 G). Following recovery, we observed that mice with prior DSS-induced intestinal inflammation exhibited a comparable tumor growth but a significant resistance to anti-PD-1 mAb treatment relative to naive mice ( Figure 5 I, 5J). Collectively, our results demonstrate a critical role for MHCII + ILC3s in preventing resistance to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and indicate that this mechanistically occurs by controlling immune homeostasis in the intestine and supporting colonization with microbiota that is required for optimal type-1 immunity.
We next hypothesized that IBD patients harbor a microbiota that fails to support type-1 immunity and hinders immunotherapy success. We found that colorectal biopsies of patients with active IBD contained reduced frequencies of ILC3s and increased T cell/ILC3 ratios relative to biopsies from healthy controls ( Figure 6 A). Microbial sequencing from these donors revealed significant compositional modifications in the luminal microbiota ( Figure 6 B). To test whether these microbial changes impact type-1 immune responses and efficacy of checkpoint blockade, we performed a FMT from healthy subjects and IBD patients ( Table S3 ) to cohorts of wild-type mice pre-treated with ABX as previously described ( Routy et al., 2018b 80. Routy, B. ∙ Le Chatelier, E. ∙ Derosa, L. ... Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors Science. 2018; 359 :91-97 Crossref Scopus (3649) PubMed Google Scholar ). Permutation-based testing of microbiome similarity between mice sharing the same human donor confirmed a successful transfer of numerous microbiota strains ( Figure 6 C). Likewise, a linear mixed effect model showed that the relative abundance of several OTUs in recipient mice was significantly correlated with donor identity, even controlling for cage effects. These analyses allowed us to identify the most significantly transferred OTUs, including members of the Bacteroides, Erysipelotrichia , and Alistipes genera ( Table S4 ).
We next examined the impact on type-1 immunity and observed that mice receiving FMT from IBD patients had a significant decrease in colonic T H 1 cells relative to recipients of FMT from healthy donors ( Figure 6 D). These mice were then inoculated subcutaneously with MC38 and treated with isotype or anti-PD-1 mAb ( Figure S6 A). There were no significant differences in α-diversity or tumor growth among recipient mice, but mice receiving microbiota from healthy donors responded to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, whereas mice receiving microbiota from IBD donors exhibited a significant resistance ( Figures 6 E and S6 B). These results were reproduced in cohorts of mice receiving FMTs from four healthy individuals and three IBD patients ( Figures 6 F and S6 C). Compositional shifts in microbiota between experiments included significantly decreased representation of Bacteroidetes phylum in mice receiving microbiota from IBD patients ( Figure S6 D). Our analyses also revealed an inverse relationship between Bacteroidales and Clostridiales orders, with Bacteroidales abundance positively associated and Clostridiales negatively associated with anti-PD1 mAb responsiveness ( Figure 6 G). We further identified 6 bacterial OTUs ( Figure 6 H) that are significantly correlated with anti-PD-1 response, all of them belonging to the Bacteroides genus and successfully transferred in our FMTs ( Figure S6 E; Table S4 ). Specifically, the abundance of 4 OTUs (OTU2, OTU92, OTU38, and OTU78) significantly correlated with responsiveness to therapy, whereas 2 OTUs (OTU6 and OTU163) were associated with resistance ( Figure 6 H). Altogether, our results demonstrate that in the healthy intestine, a dialog between ILC3s and T cells is necessary to control immunologic homeostasis and shape the microbiota in a manner that supports type-1 immunity ( Figure S6 F). This dialog is disrupted in the context of intestinal inflammation or CRC, resulting in specific compositional shifts of the microbiota that fails to induce optimal type-1 immunity, facilitating CRC progression or resistance to checkpoint blockade ( Figure S6 F).

Section: Discussion

ILC3s play a pivotal role in host-microbiota homeostasis ( Sonnenberg and Artis, 2015 86. Sonnenberg, G.F. ∙ Artis, D.

Innate Lymphoid Cells: 10 Years On Cell. 2018; 174 :1054-1066 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1406) PubMed Google Scholar ) but their role in cancer remains elusive. Our study demonstrates that ILC3s are fundamentally altered within the tumor microenvironment of CRC patients and in mouse models of CRC. This impairment of ILC3 is associated with an increased transitional state to ILC1s or ex-ILC3s, which have recently been reported to be driven by IL-23 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) ( Cella et al., 2019 20. Cella, M. ∙ Gamini, R. ∙ Sécca, C. ... Subsets of ILC3-ILC1-like cells generate a diversity spectrum of innate lymphoid cells in human mucosal tissues Nat.

Therefore, although ILC3s infiltrate tumors and localize in tertiary lymphoid structures, the inherent development of CRC re-directs these populations toward an ILC1 phenotype. Similar findings have been reported in IBD, where an impairment of ILC3s may contribute to the development of an inflammatory environment ( Bernink et al., 2013 10.

We found that human colon tumors are characterized by a significant decrease in ILC3s, a strong imbalance with T cells, a concomitant increase of T H 17 cells, and a substantial decrease in T H 1 cells relative to adjacent mucosa, suggesting that CRC progression is associated with impaired dialog between innate and adaptive immunity in the gut. We previously reported a direct link by which antigen-presenting ILC3s limit microbiota-specific T H 17 cells in the intestine ( Hepworth et al., 2013 46. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Fung, T.C. ... Innate lymphoid cells regulate CD4+ T-cell responses to intestinal commensal bacteria Nature. 2013; 498 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 47.

Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate intestinal selection of commensal bacteria-specific CD4 + T cells Science. 2015; 348 :1031-1035 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ), and now we provide new data demonstrating that impairment of antigen-presenting ILC3s indirectly limits T H 1 cells and type-1 immunity in the intestine. The latter pathway involves a T cell-dependent shift in the microbiota composition, which subsequently reduces the ability of the microbiota to support T H 1 cell- and CD8 T cell-mediated type-1 immunity relative to microbiota from a healthy intestine. These compositional shifts in the microbiota occur in patients with IBD and are sufficient to transfer altered type-1 immunity to wild-type recipient mice. This is in agreement with prior reports that specific consortia of microbes are sufficient to promote type-1 immune responses ( Sivan et al., 2015 85. Sivan, A. ∙ Corrales, L. ∙ Hubert, N. ...

A defined commensal consortium elicits CD8 T cells and anti-cancer immunity Nature. 2019; 565 :600-605 Crossref Scopus (746) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our data provide evidence that a dialog between MHCII + ILC3s and CD4 T cells is important for maintaining this function of the microbiota.
Deletion of ILC3-specific MHCII in mice also results in increased susceptibility to invasive and flat colon tumor development, suggesting that MHCII + ILC3s act as critical regulators that prevent intestinal inflammation and the transition to cancer. Elevated T H 17 cells and defects in type-1 immunity have been associated with CRC progression ( Wu et al., 2009 105. Wu, S. ∙ Rhee, K.-J. ∙ Albesiano, E. ... A human colonic commensal promotes colon tumorigenesis via activation of T helper type 17 T cell responses Nat.

Adenoma-linked barrier defects and microbial products drive IL-23/IL-17-mediated tumour growth Nature. 2012; 491 :254-258 Crossref Scopus (1052) PubMed Google Scholar ) and linked to poor clinical outcomes ( Tosolini et al., 2011 93. Tosolini, M. ∙ Kirilovsky, A. ∙ Mlecnik, B. ... Clinical impact of different classes of infiltrating T cytotoxic and helper cells (Th1, th2, treg, th17) in patients with colorectal cancer Cancer Res. 2011; 71 :1263-1271 Crossref Scopus (941) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bindea et al., 2013 13.

Spatiotemporal dynamics of intratumoral immune cells reveal the immune landscape in human cancer Immunity. 2013; 39 :782-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2768) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it is likely that this aggressive tumor phenotype is collaboratively driven by an exacerbated T H 17 cell response and impaired type-1 immunity. Further, the phenotype of tumors in mice lacking ILC3-specific MHCII also mirrors those that develop in humans with colitis-associated cancers (CACs). CACs are molecularly distinct, often develop in flat dysplasia with indistinct margins and in a field of concomitant inflammation, thus making endoscopic detection and resection challenging ( Mattar et al., 2011 68. Mattar, M.C. ∙ Lough, D. ∙ Pishvaian, M.J. ... Current management of inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer Gastrointest. Cancer Res. 2011; 4 :53-61 PubMed Google Scholar ; Beaugerie and Itzkowitz, 2015 7. Beaugerie, L. ∙ Itzkowitz, S.H. Cancers complicating inflammatory bowel disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :1441-1452 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results demonstrate that disruption of a dialog between MHCII + ILC3s, T cells, and the microbiota is a previously unappreciated mechanism driving invasive CACs and further provides a new model to study this aggressive disease.
Revolutionary checkpoint blockade immunotherapies are an important approach to combat cancer but responsiveness remains highly heterogeneous across patients ( Sharma et al., 2017 82. Sharma, P. ∙ Hu-Lieskovan, S. ∙ Wargo, J.A. ... Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3421) PubMed Google Scholar ). CRC and other gastrointestinal cancers exhibit poor responsiveness, with a recent study reporting only 11% of mismatch repair-proficient tumors responding to checkpoint blockade ( Le et al., 2015 56. Le, D.T. ∙ Uram, J.N. ∙ Wang, H. ... PD-1 Blockade in Tumors with Mismatch-Repair Deficiency N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 :2509-2520 Crossref Scopus (7340) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variations in gut microbiota could explain these diverse therapeutic responses as distinct compositions are associated with success or failure in some cancer patients, and FMT is sufficient to transfer these phenotypes to mice ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018 40. Gopalakrishnan, V. ∙ Spencer, C.N. ∙ Nezi, L. ... Gut microbiome modulates response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients Science. 2018; 359 :97-103 Crossref Scopus (3065) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mager et al., 2020 63.

Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors Science. 2018; 359 :91-97 Crossref Scopus (3649) PubMed Google Scholar ). FMT also has the potential to break immunotherapy resistance in melanoma cancer patients ( Baruch et al., 2021 5. Baruch, E.N. ∙ Youngster, I. ∙ Ben-Betzalel, G. ... Fecal microbiota transplant promotes response in immunotherapy-refractory melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :602-609 Crossref Scopus (831) PubMed Google Scholar ; Davar et al., 2021 26.

Fecal microbiota transplant overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in melanoma patients Science. 2021; 371 :595-602 Crossref Scopus (805) PubMed Google Scholar ), and often a type-1 immune response is one of the best predictors of treatment response ( Litchfield et al., 2021 59. Litchfield, K. ∙ Reading, J.L. ∙ Puttick, C. ...

Rozeman, E.A. ∙ Hoefsmit, E.P. ∙ Reijers, I.L.M. ... Survival and biomarker analyses from the OpACIN-neo and OpACIN neoadjuvant immunotherapy trials in stage III melanoma Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :256-263 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data indicate that impaired ILC3s and intestinal inflammation are sufficient to shape the microbiota in a manner that fails to promote anti-tumor type-1 immunity and rather causes resistance to checkpoint blockade. These results suggest that MHCII + ILC3s may serve as gatekeepers to limit microbial shifts in these contexts, and subsequently support type-1 immune responses, uncovering a new pathway to protect against checkpoint blockade resistance. This also suggests that the inherent reduction of ILC3s elicits inflammation and microbial shifts that drive resistance to checkpoint blockade in CRC.
Defining how microbiota impacts therapy responsiveness is currently incomplete, therefore limiting the potential to predict or prevent resistance. We identify that patients with impaired ILC3s and intestinal inflammation exhibit distinct microbial signatures in Bacteroides species that significantly track with resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings have implications both for the management of IBD patients and the use of checkpoint blockade in gastrointestinal cancers. For example, our results suggest that supporting ILC3s, limiting intestinal inflammation or manipulating the microbiota could hold the key to boosting type-1 immunity in CRC patients, thus limiting tumor progression and increasing responsiveness to checkpoint blockade. These results also have broad implications for our understanding of ILC3s and host-microbiota interactions in multiple cancer types and will pave the way toward targeted approaches to manipulate these pathways to improve cancer therapies.
Although our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of ILC3s in cancer, several limitations should be mentioned. First, although we define how a dialog between MHCII + ILC3s and T cells impacts T H 17 cells and type-1 immunity, it remains possible that other T cell populations are impacted. Deeper analyses with single-cell RNA-sequencing would comprehensively define the evolution of every T cell compartments during homeostasis, cancer, and treatment with immunotherapy. Second, the precise localization of ILC3s within human CRC was not achievable due to technical limitations, and it would be important for future studies to quantify ILC3s in this manner across multiple mouse models and clinical samples. Finally, our data demonstrating the impact of altered microbiota from MHCII ΔILC3 mice and IBD patients on immunotherapy resistance was performed in the gold-standard subcutaneous tumor implantation model. Additional studies should be conducted to extend our findings to other types of tumors and in spontaneous or orthotropic models, as well as to determine whether FMT could improve immunotherapy responsiveness in CRC patients.

A total of 92 CRC and adenoma and 16 IBD colon tissue samples were obtained and cryopreserved from adult patients. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects and tissues were obtained following Institutional Review Board-approved protocols from the Center for Advanced Digestive Diseases (CADC) and the JRI IBD Live Cell Bank Consortium at Weill Cornell Medicine. Subject baseline characteristics for these samples are listed in Tables S1 and S3 . Twenty samples were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN), which is funded by the National Cancer Institute. Other investigators may have received specimens from the same subjects.
C57BL/6J mice and APC min/+ mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, and were bred and/or maintained at Weill Cornell Medicine. C57BL/6J RORγt-eGFP mice were provided by G.E. MHCII ΔILC3 mice and MHCII F/F littermate controls were generated as previously described ( Hepworth et al., 2013 46. Hepworth, M.R. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ∙ Fung, T.C. ... Innate lymphoid cells regulate CD4+ T-cell responses to intestinal commensal bacteria Nature. 2013; 498 :113-117 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ) by crossing Rorc cre mice and H2-Ab1 floxed/floxed mice. CDX2 Cre -APCmin +/F mice were generated by crossing CDX2 Cre with APCmin floxed/floxed mice ( Hinoi et al., 2007 48. Hinoi, T. ∙ Akyol, A. ∙ Theisen, B.K. ... Mouse model of colonic adenoma-carcinoma progression based on somatic Apc inactivation Cancer Res. 2007; 67 :9721-9730 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. The APCmin floxed/floxed mice used were targeted on exon 15 ( Shibata et al., 1997 83. Shibata, H. ∙ Toyama, K. ∙ Shioya, H. ... Rapid colorectal adenoma formation initiated by conditional targeting of the Apc gene Science. 1997; 278 :120-123 Crossref Scopus (492) PubMed Google Scholar ). ROSA26-RORc cre-YFP mice were generated by crossing the above Rorc cre mice with ROSA26-floxed-STOP-YFP mice from the Jackson Laboratory ( Srinivas et al., 2001 88. Srinivas, S. ∙ Watanabe, T. ∙ Lin, C.S. ... Cre reporter strains produced by targeted insertion of EYFP and ECFP into the ROSA26 locus BMC Dev. Biol. 2001; 1 :4 Crossref Scopus (2456) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, and all other mice were bred and maintained in specific-pathogen-free facilities at Weill Cornell Medicine. Littermates were used as controls in all experiments. Germ-free C57BL/6J were maintained at the Weill Cornell Medicine Gnotobiotic Mouse Facility. Germ-free C57BL/6J and ABX-treated animals were maintained in sterile isocages during all experimental procedures. If not mentioned specifically, adult mice were between 6 and 10-week of age. Male and female mice were used for experiments and were gender-matched; no differences were observed within the parameters analyzed. Littermates of the same sex were randomly assigned to experimental groups. For tumor experiments, mice developing skin ulcerations were euthanized according to approved protocols and excluded from analyses. All protocols were approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and all experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the IACUC.
The C57BL/6J -derived colon cancer cell line MC38 ( Corbett et al., 1975 24. Corbett, T.H. ∙ Griswold, Jr., D.P. ∙ Roberts, B.J. ... Tumor induction relationships in development of transplantable cancers of the colon in mice for chemotherapy assays, with a note on carcinogen structure Cancer Res. 1975; 35 :2434-2439 PubMed Google Scholar ) and the melanoma cell line B16-F10 were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Cellgro). The MC38 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. Dmitriy Zamarin and the B16-F10 cell line was purchased from the ATCC. MC38 cells are derived from female mice and B16-F10 cells are derived from male mice. These cell lines have not been authenticated.
The DSS and AOM/DSS mouse models of chronic colitis and CRC, respectively, were established using the protocol previously described ( Thaker et al., 2012 91. Thaker, A.I. ∙ Shaker, A. ∙ Rao, M.S. ... Modeling Colitis-Associated Cancer with Azoxymethane (AOM) and Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 11 :4100 Google Scholar ; Wirtz et al., 2017 104. Wirtz, S. ∙ Popp, V. ∙ Kindermann, M. ... Chemically induced mouse models of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1295-1309 Crossref Scopus (908) PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications. In brief, for the development of chronic colitis, mice were given 3% DSS (MP Biochemicals, colitis grade) in drinking water for 7 days, followed by drinking water for 14 days. This cycle was repeated once. For CRC, mice were given an initial intraperitoneal injection of 12.5 mg/kg AOM and DSS treatment was then started at day 5 after AOM injection. DSS cycle was repeated once for MHCII ΔILC3 and littermate controls or twice for C57BL/6J mice. Mice were sacrificed, stool and tissue were collected, and colons were examined macroscopically for tumor analyses, then fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding and histology ( Bialkowska et al., 2016 12. Bialkowska, A.B. ∙ Ghaleb, A.M. ∙ Nandan, M.O. ... Improved Swiss-rolling Technique for Intestinal Tissue Preparation for Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescent Analyses J. Vis. Exp. 2016; 54161 Google Scholar ). Macroscopically visible colon adenomas were quantified with an Olympus SZX12 dissecting scope and sized with a digital caliper.
For intestinal lamina propria lymphocyte preparations, intestines were isolated, attached fat removed and tissues cut open longitudinally. Luminal contents were removed by shaking in ice-cold PBS (Corning). For AOM/DSS protocol, distal luminal polyps were excised from the colon with an Olympus SZX12 dissecting scope. Afterward, mucus was gently removed by forceps. Epithelial cells and intraepithelial lymphocytes were then removed by shaking tissue in HANKS free media (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 2% FBS (Omega Scientific) and 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) stripping buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Samples were then vortexed and the epithelial fraction was discarded. Afterward, samples were washed by PBS and enzymatic digestion was performed in RPMI containing 10% FBS and 0.4 U/ml dispase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 mg/ml collagenase III (Worthington) and 20 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma Aldrich) on a shaker for 45 min at 37°C. Leukocytes were filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and further enriched by a 40% Percoll gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare).
Surgical-resection samples from the colon or ileum of patients with colon cancer or IBD were obtained and tumor, IBD-inflamed and non-malignant or non-inflamed regions were isolated by a trained pathologist. Single cell suspensions from intestinal tissues were obtained by incubating adjacent non-malignant tissue for 30 min at 37°C with shaking in stripping buffer containing 5% FCS (Omega Scientific), 1 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the epithelial layer. Supernatants were then discarded. Tumor and the remaining adjacent tissues were then mechanically dissociated with a sterile scalpel. The lamina propria fraction was obtained by incubating the dissociated tissues for 1 hour at 37°C with shaking in 2 mg/ml collagenase D (Roche), 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml of Trypsin Inhibitor (GIBCO) digestion solution. Remaining tissues were then filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. All cells were then viably cryopreserved in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO for side-by-side analysis at a later time point.
For human biopsy samples, de-identified intestinal biopsies from the terminal ileum or the colon of IBD patients or healthy controls donors who did not have IBD were obtained following Institutional Review Board-approved protocols from the JRI IBD Live Cell Bank Consortium at Weill Cornell Medicine. Tissues were processed by first incubating in 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and 5% FBS for 30 min at 37°C with shaking to remove intestinal epithelial cells. Supernatants were then discarded and the remaining tissues were incubated in 0.5 mg/ml collagenase D and 20 μg/ml DNase I for 1 hour at 37°C with shaking to obtain the lamina propria fraction. Any remaining tissues were also included following mechanical dissociation and filtering through a 70 μm cell strainer. All cells were then viably cryopreserved in 90% FBS and 10% DMSO for future side-by-side analyses. Following thawing and filtering through a 70 μm cell strainer, cryopreserved cells were stained with antibodies for flow cytometry acquisition.
Human ILC3s (CD45 + CD3 - CD4 - CD8 - CD19 - CD94 - CD14 - CD123 - FcεRIa - CD34 - CD11c - CRTH2 - CD127 + CD117 + ) were sort-purified from surgical-resection samples from the colon of patients with colon cancer. Sorted cells were used to prepare RNA sequencing libraries by the Epigenomics Core at Weill Cornell Medicine, using the Clontech SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit V4 (Clontech Laboratories). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 4000, yielding 50-bp single-end reads. Raw sequencing reads were demultiplexed with Illumina CASAVA (v.1.8.2). Adapters were trimmed from reads using FLEXBAR (v.2.4) ( Dodt et al., 2012 30. Dodt, M. ∙ Roehr, J.T. ∙ Ahmed, R. ... FLEXBAR-Flexible Barcode and Adapter Processing for Next-Generation Sequencing Platforms Biology (Basel). 2012; 1 :895-905 Crossref Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ) and reads were aligned to the NCBI GRCh37/hg19 human genome using the STAR aligner (v.2.3.0) ( Dobin et al., 2013 29. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default settings. Reads per gene were counted using Rsubread ( Liao et al., 2019 58. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. The R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :e47 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to differential expression analysis, genes were prefiltered, keeping only those genes with 50 or more counts in at least two samples. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 version 1.20.0 ( Love et al., 2014 61. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) using both site (tumor/adjacent) and patient ID as factors in the design. A false discovery rate of 0.1 was taken to indicate significance. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using the top 500 highest variance genes after applying DESeq2′s variance stabilizing transformation. The degree to which samples clustered by site (tumor versus adjacent) in the PCA was assessed using PERMANOVA ( Anderson, 2001 1. Anderson, M.J. A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance Austral Ecol. 2001; 26 :32-46 Google Scholar ) as implemented by the adonis function of the vegan R package ( Oksanen et al., 2019 74. Oksanen, J. ∙ Blanchet, F.G. ∙ Friendly, M. ... vegan: Community Ecology Package 2019 Google Scholar ) using the Euclidean metric and 20,000 permutations.
Tissue sections from experimental mice were cut and stained as described previously ( Mackley et al., 2015 62. Mackley, E.C. ∙ Houston, S. ∙ Marriott, C.L. ... CCR7-dependent trafficking of RORγ + ILCs creates a unique microenvironment within mucosal draining lymph nodes Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :5862 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 6-μm-thick sections of tissue were cut, fixed in formalin at 4 °C for 20 min and then stored at −20 °C before staining. Antibodies raised against the following mouse antigens were used: CD3 (clone 145-2C11, dilution 1:100, eBioscience) IL-7Rα (clone A7R34, dilution 1:25, Thermo Scientific), purified RORγt (clone AFKJS-9, dilution 1:30, Thermo Scientific) and HLA-DR (clone M5/114.15.2, dilution 1:200, Biolegend). Detection of RORγt expression required amplification of the signal as described previously ( Mackley et al., 2015 62. Mackley, E.C. ∙ Houston, S. ∙ Marriott, C.L. ... CCR7-dependent trafficking of RORγ + ILCs creates a unique microenvironment within mucosal draining lymph nodes Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :5862 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified rat primary antibodies against the transcription factors were detected with donkey anti-rat-IgG-FITC (dilution 1:100, molecular probes), and then rabbit anti-FITC-AF488 (dilution 1:100, molecular probes) or with donkey anti-rabbit-IgG-AF488 (dilution 1:100, molecular probes). Biotinylated anti-CD3 antibodies were detected with SA-AF555 (dilution 1:100, molecular probes). Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted using ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). Slides were analyzed on a Zeiss 780 Zen microscope (Zeiss).
Tissue samples from the colon tumors and intestines of mice were fixed with formalin, embedded in paraffin and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histology was scored for dysplasia/tumors by a blinded experienced investigator (J.C.A.). For mice treated with the AOM/DSS chemically-induced CRC protocol ( Thaker et al., 2012 91. Thaker, A.I. ∙ Shaker, A. ∙ Rao, M.S. ... Modeling Colitis-Associated Cancer with Azoxymethane (AOM) and Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 11 :4100 Google Scholar ), dysplasia scoring was based upon a published scoring system ( Arthur et al., 2012 2. Arthur, J.C. ∙ Perez-Chanona, E. ∙ Mühlbauer, M. ... Intestinal inflammation targets cancer-inducing activity of the microbiota Science. 2012; 338 :120-123 Crossref Scopus (1656) PubMed Google Scholar ) as follows: I = no dysplasia; II = mild dysplasia characterized by aberrant crypt foci (ACF); III = gastrointestinal neoplasia (GIN); IV = adenoma, non-invasive severe or high grade dysplasia restricted to the mucosa; V = adenocarcinoma, invasive through the muscularis mucosa; VI = adenocarcinoma, fully invasive through the submucosa and into or through the muscularis propria. Due to the extensive dysplasia throughout the colon of MHCII ΔILC3 mice, we expanded our scoring system to further distinguish percent involvement of dysplasia and invasive lesions. “Overall dysplasia involvement” score multiplies dysplasia score by % involvement: multiplied by 1 for no dysplasia, 2 for 0%–25% colon affected, 3 for 25%–50%, 4 for 50% or greater. We used a similar approach to score invasion involvement. Invasive lesions were first categorized as non-invasive (0), invasive through the muscularis mucosa (1), or fully transmural into the muscularis propria (2). This invasion score was then multiplied by the % involvement as above for dysplasia, resulting in an “invasion involvement” score. For the APC min/+ spontaneous CRC model, dysplasia scoring was based upon a published scoring system ( Nalbantoglu et al., 2016 72. Nalbantoglu, I. ∙ Blanc, V. ∙ Davidson, N.O. Characterization of Colorectal Cancer Development in Apcmin/+ Mice Methods Mol. Biol. 2016; 1422 :309-327 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ) and adapted as follow: I = no dysplasia; II = mild dysplasia characterized by aberrant crypt foci (ACF); III = gastrointestinal neoplasia (GIN); IV = adenoma or adenocarcinoma including at least 9 crypts.
2 × 10 6 CD4 + CD3 + T cells were sorted from the mesenteric lymph nodes of control or experimental mice to a purity > 98% and transferred intravenously to naive C57BL/6J Rag1 −/− recipient mice.
5 × 10 5 tumor cells were injected subcutaneously in 100 μL PBS on the right flank. Tumor size was determined by the formula L ∗ W ∗ D where L = length, W = width, and D = depth, on the indicated days.
Anti-PD-1 (clone RMP1-14) monoclonal antibody was purchased from BioXCell and administered intraperitoneally every 2 days at a dose of 200 μg per mouse starting on day 7 and ending on day 11 post-tumor injections.
Subcutaneous tumors were excised and single cell suspension were obtained after mechanical dilacerations and tumor digestion with 2 mg/ml of collagenase D (Roche) at 37°C for 1 hour. Hematopoietic cells were then enriched by density gradient centrifugation with 40% Percoll (GE Healthcare).
16S rRNA gene sequencing and OTUs table generation for experiment 1 of the MHCII ΔILC3 mouse microbiome characterization were performed at the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at the Baylor College of Medicine using methods adapted from the NIH Human Microbiome Project ( Peterson et al., 2009 76. Peterson, J. ∙ Garges, S. ∙ Giovanni, M. ..., NIH HMP Working Group The NIH Human Microbiome Project Genome Res. 2009; 19 :2317-2323 Crossref Scopus (1549) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the 16S rDNA V4 region was amplified by PCR and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) using a 2x250 bp paired-end protocol. The read pairs were demultiplexed based on unique molecular barcodes, and subsequently merged using USEARCH v7.0.1090 ( Edgar, 2010 32. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (15874) PubMed Google Scholar ), allowing zero mismatches and a minimum overlap of 50 bases. Merged reads were trimmed at the first base with Q5 after which a quality filter was applied discarding reads with > 0.05 expected errors. Merged and filtered 16S sequences were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using the UPARSE algorithm ( Edgar, 2013 33. Edgar, R.C. UPARSE: highly accurate OTU sequences from microbial amplicon reads Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :996-998 Crossref Scopus (12176) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a similarity cutoff value of 97%. OTUs were mapped to a modified version of the SILVA Database containing only the 16S V4 region to determine taxonomies. Abundances were recovered by mapping the demultiplexed reads to the UPARSE OTUs.
16S rRNA gene sequencing and OTU table generation for experiment 2 of the MHCII ΔILC3 mouse microbiome characterization, as well as for the human-to-mouse FMT experiments, were performed at the Microbiome Core Lab of Weill Cornell Medicine. DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were performed following the protocols of the Earth Microbiome Project ( Thompson et al., 2017 92. Thompson, L.R. ∙ Sanders, J.G. ∙ McDonald, D. ..., Earth Microbiome Project Consortium A communal catalogue reveals Earth’s multiscale microbial diversity Nature. 2017; 551 :457-463 Crossref Scopus (1532) PubMed Google Scholar ) using primers 515F and 926R ( Parada et al., 2016 75. Parada, A.E. ∙ Needham, D.M. ∙ Fuhrman, J.A. Every base matters: assessing small subunit rRNA primers for marine microbiomes with mock communities, time series and global field samples Environ. Microbiol. 2016; 18 :1403-1414 Crossref Scopus (2213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument, producing paired-end 250 base pair reads. Raw reads were processed using USEARCH version 11 ( Edgar, 2010 32. Edgar, R.C. Search and clustering orders of magnitude faster than BLAST Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :2460-2461 Crossref Scopus (15874) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, forward and reverse reads were merged, discarding read pairs with more than 5 mismatches or less than 90% sequence identity in the overlap region. Merged sequences shorter than 300 bp or with an overlap region less than 16bp were discarded. Sequences matching PhiX phage were removed, followed by quality filtering with a maximum expected error number of 1.0. OTU clustering was performed using the USEARCH cluster_otus command with default settings. Merged (pre-filter) reads were mapped to the OTUs, generating a OTUs table. OTUs representative sequences were classified using the SINTAX algorithm ( Edgar, 2016 34. Edgar, R.C. SINTAX: a simple non-Bayesian taxonomy classifier for 16S and ITS sequences bioRxiv. 2016; Crossref Google Scholar ) using the Ribosomal Database Project’s training set version 16 ( Cole et al., 2014 22. Cole, J.R. ∙ Wang, Q. ∙ Fish, J.A. ... Ribosomal Database Project: data and tools for high throughput rRNA analysis Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D633-D642 Crossref Scopus (3143) PubMed Google Scholar ) and with a confidence threshold of 0.8. The phylogenetic tree used to calculate weighted UniFrac distances was generated from the OTUs representative sequences using the USEARCH cluster_aggd command with default settings.
Alpha diversity estimation and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) were performed using the phyloseq R package ( McMurdie and Holmes, 2013 70. McMurdie, P.J. ∙ Holmes, S. phyloseq: an R package for reproducible interactive analysis and graphics of microbiome census data PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e61217 Crossref Scopus (11490) PubMed Google Scholar ) after rarefying OTU tables to at least 10,000 reads. The extent to which samples clustered according to genotype in the PCoA was assessed by applying PERMANOVA ( Anderson, 2001 1. Anderson, M.J. A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance Austral Ecol. 2001; 26 :32-46 Google Scholar ) to the weighted UniFrac distances using 20,000 permutations.
Differential abundance testing was carried out on all OTUs with average relative abundances of at least 0.01 using the DESeq2 R package ( Love et al., 2014 61. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters after exporting the data using the function phyloseq_to_deseq2 of the phyloseq R package. The p values from differential abundance testing were corrected for multiple comparisons, with a false discovery rate of 0.1 being taken to indicate significance.
To generate the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure S6 E, bacterial reference genome sequences were downloaded from NCBI and their respective 16S regions were extracted using the USEARCH command search_pcr using the 515F and 926R primer sequences ( Parada et al., 2016 75. Parada, A.E. ∙ Needham, D.M. ∙ Fuhrman, J.A. Every base matters: assessing small subunit rRNA primers for marine microbiomes with mock communities, time series and global field samples Environ. Microbiol. 2016; 18 :1403-1414 Crossref Scopus (2213) PubMed Google Scholar ). A single sequence was allowed to represent each species so long as all paralogs within a genome were at least 99% similar to each other. The standard_fasttree method of ETE-tools ( Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016 50. Huerta-Cepas, J. ∙ Serra, F. ∙ Bork, P. ETE 3: Reconstruction, Analysis, and Visualization of Phylogenomic Data Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33 :1635-1638 Crossref Scopus (1197) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to generate the phylogenetic tree, making use of Clustal Omega ( Sievers et al., 2011 84. Sievers, F. ∙ Wilm, A. ∙ Dineen, D. ... Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7 :539 Crossref Scopus (10804) PubMed Google Scholar ) for multiple sequence alignment and FastTree 2 ( Price et al., 2010 78. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree 2--approximately maximum-likelihood trees for large alignments PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e9490 Crossref Scopus (9016) PubMed Google Scholar ) for phylogenetic tree construction.
For FMT studies, donor fecal samples from five healthy subjects and four IBD patients (with one technical replicate for one patient) were collected and re-suspended in anaerobic PBS supplemented with 10% glycerol in an anaerobic chamber. In some cases, a cocktail of antibiotics, ampicillin (1 mg/ml), streptomycin (5 mg/ml), and colistin (1 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the sterile water of mice. Fresh fecal suspension (200 μL per mouse) was then administered to recipient germ-free or antibiotics pre-treated C57BL/6J mice by oral gavage. In addition, another 100 μL was applied on the fur of each animal. Transplanted animals were subsequently maintained in a sterile isocage with autoclaved food and water. Two weeks after FMT, tumor cells were injected subcutaneously and mice were treated with anti-PD-1 or control mAbs as described above. Animals were evaluated for successful microbiota-transplantation via 16S sequencing comparison between human donor and recipient mice before further analyzes. Two individuals (one healthy subject and one IBD patient) demonstrating FMT failure were excluded from the analyses.
Statistical tests were performed with Prism (GraphPad) and R version 3.6.3 ( http://www.r-project.org/ ). Results represent either the mean and error bars depict the SEM or boxplots with 10/25/50/75/90 percentiles. PD-1 response score was calculated following the formula: 1 – ((tumor size after anti-PD-1 treatment at day 21)/(Mean tumor size of isotype treated animals at day 21)). P values of mouse datasets were determined by paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test with a 95% confidence interval. Variance was analyzed using F-test. Welch’s correction was performed in case of unequal variance. Where appropriate, Mann–Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test, one way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-tests were performed. Unless otherwise stated, p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For the comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Log-rank (mantel-Cox) test was used. Details of samples number, data representation, and statistical comparison method of each plot can be found in the figures and figure legends.
Permutation testing was used to assess whether the microbiota of mice receiving FMT from the same donor were more similar to each other than those of mice receiving FMT from different donors, taking into account the strong within-cage correlations in microbiome composition. Specifically, the Weighted UniFrac distance was calculated between all pairs of recipient microbiota. The “donor effect” was defined to be the difference between the mean “different cage, different donor” distance and the mean “different cage, same donor” distance. The statistical significance of this donor effect was determined by recalculating the donor effect in 10,000 null datasets generated from the true data by permuting the cages with respect to donors. Thus, in the null datasets any true effect of donor identity is destroyed, while within-cage correlations are preserved. The permutation p value is the proportion of null datasets with donor effects larger than that seen in the true dataset.
The correlation of donor identity with recipient microbiome was assessed at the OTU level by means of a linear mixed-effects model, which was fitted using the lme4 R package ( Bates et al., 2015 6. Bates, D. ∙ Mächler, M. ∙ Bolker, B. ... Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4 J. Stat. Softw. 2015; 67 :1-48 Crossref Scopus (53083) Google Scholar ). Specifically, the relative abundance of an OTU in recipients was modeled using donor identity (a categorical factor) as a fixed effect and cage identity as a random effect. This model was compared to one without the donor effect, yielding a p value. The test was applied to all OTUs with average relative abundances of at least 0.01. The resulting p values were corrected for multiple comparisons, with false discovery rates less than 0.05 being considered significant.
