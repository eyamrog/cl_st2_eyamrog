Title: Mechanism of CFTR correction by type I folding correctors


Abstract: Summary

Small molecule chaperones have been exploited as therapeutics for the hundreds of diseases caused by protein misfolding. The most successful examples are the CFTR correctors, which transformed cystic fibrosis therapy. These molecules revert folding defects of the ΔF508 mutant and are widely used to treat patients. To investigate the molecular mechanism of their action, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of CFTR in complex with the FDA-approved correctors lumacaftor or tezacaftor. Both drugs insert into a hydrophobic pocket in the first transmembrane domain (TMD1), linking together four helices that are thermodynamically unstable. Mutating residues at the binding site rendered ΔF508-CFTR insensitive to lumacaftor and tezacaftor, underscoring the functional significance of the structural discovery. These results support a mechanism in which the correctors stabilize TMD1 at an early stage of biogenesis, prevent its premature degradation, and thereby allosterically rescuing many disease-causing mutations.

Section: Introduction

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an anion channel that regulates salt, fluid, and pH balance in many organs ( Cutting, 2015 11. Cutting, G.R. Cystic fibrosis genetics: from molecular understanding to clinical application Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16 :45-56 Crossref Scopus (647) PubMed Google Scholar ). CFTR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. It is a single polypeptide composed of two pseudo-symmetrical halves connected by a regulatory domain (RD). Each half of CFTR contains a transmembrane domain (TMD) that forms the ion conduction pathway and a cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that binds ATP. The RD, unique in CFTR, must be phosphorylated for the channel to open ( Cheng et al., 1991 8. Cheng, S.H. ∙ Rich, D.P. ∙ Marshall, J. ... Phosphorylation of the R domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulates the CFTR chloride channel Cell. 1991; 66 :1027-1036 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (589) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phosphorylated CFTR channel is gated by ATP binding and hydrolysis ( Csanády et al., 2019 9. Csanády, L. ∙ Vergani, P. ∙ Gadsby, D.C. Structure, Gating, and Regulation of the Cftr Anion Channel Physiol. Rev. 2019; 99 :707-738 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). The molecular structure of CFTR has been determined in two conformational states ( Liu et al., 2017 37. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Csanady, L. ...

Zhang, Z. ∙ Chen, J. Atomic Structure of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Cell. 2016; 167 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the un-phosphorylated, ATP-free state, the RD lies in between the two NBDs, and the pore is closed( Liu et al., 2017 37. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Csanady, L. ... Molecular Structure of the Human CFTR Ion Channel Cell. 2017; 169 :85-95 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Chen, 2016 72. Zhang, Z. ∙ Chen, J. Atomic Structure of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Cell. 2016; 167 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of the phosphorylated, ATP-bound state was obtained from the hydrolysis-deficient mutant E1371Q, which shows that phosphorylation releases the RD from its inhibitory position, permitting NBD dimerization and channel opening ( Zhang et al., 2017, 2018 73.

More than 300 mutations lead to cystic fibrosis, causing various defects in CFTR expression, folding, and channel function ( Welsh and Smith, 1993 69. Welsh, M.J. ∙ Smith, A.E. Molecular mechanisms of CFTR chloride channel dysfunction in cystic fibrosis Cell. 1993; 73 :1251-1254 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most common mutation is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 in NBD1 (ΔF508), which results in the retention of folding intermediates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ( Cheng et al., 1990 7. Cheng, S.H. ∙ Gregory, R.J. ∙ Marshall, J. ... Defective intracellular transport and processing of CFTR is the molecular basis of most cystic fibrosis Cell. 1990; 63 :827-834 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1518) PubMed Google Scholar ). In recent years, CFTR modulators have been developed to revert the effects of the disease-causing mutations ( Habib et al., 2019 22. Habib, A.R. ∙ Kajbafzadeh, M. ∙ Desai, S. ... A Systematic Review of the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of CFTR Modulators in Cystic Fibrosis Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :7234 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Small molecules that enhance channel activity are called potentiators, and chemicals that increase the amount of CFTR in the plasmid membrane are called correctors. Currently, one potentiator (ivacaftor) and three correctors (lumacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor) are in clinical use. Many of the mutations, including ΔF508, cause defects in CFTR biogenesis and channel function. For this reason, most patients require a combination therapy of potentiator and corrector.
Extensive research has been devoted to uncovering the mechanisms of CFTR modulators. Whereas the structural and functional basis of potentiator ivacaftor action has been described ( Eckford et al., 2012 14. Eckford, P.D. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Ramjeesingh, M. ...

USA. 2009; 106 :18825-18830 Crossref Scopus (993) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mechanism of correctors remains largely undefined. In one study, it was suggested that lumacaftor (formally VX-809) acts through perturbation of membranes, as it appeared to be homogeneously distributed throughout the lipid bilayer ( Baroni et al., 2014 3. Baroni, D. ∙ Zegarra-Moran, O. ∙ Svensson, A. ... Direct interaction of a CFTR potentiator and a CFTR corrector with phospholipid bilayers Eur. Biophys. J. 2014; 43 :341-346 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). In multiple other studies, a direct action on the channel was proposed, but the location of the binding site remains in dispute ( Eckford et al., 2014 15.

In this study, we determined cryo-EM structures of lumacaftor-bound CFTR in both the NBD-separated and NBD-dimerized conformations. We also determined the structure of CFTR in complex with tezacaftor (formally VX-661) in the NBD-dimerized conformation. These structures, supported by biochemical and functional data, indicate that these correctors stabilize CFTR by filling an internal cavity on TMD1 and linking together four transmembrane helices that are intrinsically thermodynamically unstable.

Section: Results

CFTR correctors have been categorized into different clusters based on their functional redundancy or additivity. Correctors in the same cluster do not exhibit additive effects and are proposed to share a similar mechanism ( Veit et al., 2018 64. Veit, G. ∙ Xu, H. ∙ Dreano, E. ...

Correctors from different clusters act through different mechanisms, and some can be combined to synergistically promote CFTR folding ( Farinha et al., 2013 20.

Based on this categorization, lumacaftor (VX-809) and tezacaftor (VX-661) belong to the same cluster called type I correctors. They are structural analogs, both containing a 1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl-Cyclopropane Carboxamide (BCC) headgroup ( Figure 1 A). Other type I correctors such as C18 ( Okiyoneda et al., 2013 46.

Although lumacaftor was identified based on its ability to increase cell surface expression of ΔF508-CFTR, its effect is not limited to this particular mutation. Lumacaftor promotes folding of many other mutations as well as the wt CFTR ( He et al., 2013 23. He, L. ∙ Kota, P. ∙ Aleksandrov, A.A. ...

A key question to address then is this: does lumacaftor act on misfolded CFTR to restore the tertiary structure, or does it stabilize already-folded CFTR in its native conformation? The latter possibility is supported by two recent studies, which showed that lumacaftor, and its analog C18, bind and stabilize ΔF508-CFTR after its rescue to the cell surface ( Eckford et al., 2014 15. Eckford, P.D. ∙ Ramjeesingh, M. ∙ Molinski, S. ... VX-809 and related corrector compounds exhibit secondary activity stabilizing active F508del-CFTR after its partial rescue to the cell surface Chem. Biol. 2014; 21 :666-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Okiyoneda et al., 2013 46. Okiyoneda, T. ∙ Veit, G. ∙ Dekkers, J.F. ... Mechanism-based corrector combination restores ΔF508-CFTR folding and function Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 :444-454 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). C18 also binds directly to purified wt CFTR reconstituted in proteoliposomes ( Eckford et al., 2014 15. Eckford, P.D. ∙ Ramjeesingh, M. ∙ Molinski, S. ... VX-809 and related corrector compounds exhibit secondary activity stabilizing active F508del-CFTR after its partial rescue to the cell surface Chem. Biol. 2014; 21 :666-678 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). To measure quantitatively the interactions between lumacaftor and purified wt CFTR, we established a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) showing that specific binding of [ 3 H]lumacaftor increases as a function of its concentration ( Figure 1 B). The data fit well to a single-site binding model via nonlinear regression analysis, resulting in an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d ) of 8.3 ± 2.2 nM. In comparison, the effective half concentration (EC 50 ) of lumacaftor to rescue ΔF508-CFTR function is reported to be 81 ± 19 nM ( Van Goor et al., 2011 63. Van Goor, F. ∙ Hadida, S. ∙ Grootenhuis, P.D. ... Correction of the F508del-CFTR protein processing defect in vitro by the investigational drug VX-809 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :18843-18848 Crossref Scopus (868) PubMed Google Scholar ). The approximate 10-fold difference in the affinity/effective dose is likely explicable on the basis that the former measures the interaction of the drug with wt CFTR in vitro , whereas the latter measures the cellular effects on the ΔF508 mutant.
To test if lumacaftor and tezacaftor share a common binding site, we performed a competition assay by measuring lumacaftor binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of tezacaftor ( Figure 1 C). Tezacaftor displaced [ 3 H]lumacaftor in a manner quantitatively consistent with a 1:1 competitive mechanism with an inhibition constant (K i ) equal to 115 ± 42 nM ( Figure 1 C), also comparable to the potency of tezacaftor in cell-based assays (EC 50 = 516 nM) ( Van Goor et al., 2011 63. Van Goor, F. ∙ Hadida, S. ∙ Grootenhuis, P.D. ... Correction of the F508del-CFTR protein processing defect in vitro by the investigational drug VX-809 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :18843-18848 Crossref Scopus (868) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van Goor et al., 2016, North Amer. Cystic Fibrosis Conference, poster abstract). Using the same competition assay, the K i of unlabeled lumacaftor was determined to be 7.7 ± 2.0 nM ( Figure 1 C), consistent with the K d value determined in the direct binding assay ( Figure 1 B). Two other structurally unrelated correctors, Corr-4a (type II ) and elexacaftor (type III ), did not displace [ 3 H]lumacaftor ( Figure 1 C). The lack of competition by those two correctors is in agreement with folding studies showing that Corr-4a and elexacaftor function synergistically with lumacaftor ( Pedemonte et al., 2005 48. Pedemonte, N. ∙ Lukacs, G.L. ∙ Du, K. ... Small-molecule correctors of defective DeltaF508-CFTR cellular processing identified by high-throughput screening J. Clin.

To identify the corrector-binding site, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the CFTR/lumacaftor complex in two conformational states ( Figures 2 A and S1–S3 ; Table S1 ). In the absence of phosphorylation and ATP, wt CFTR exhibits an NBD-separated conformation as observed before ( Liu et al., 2017 37. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Csanady, L. ... Molecular Structure of the Human CFTR Ion Channel Cell. 2017; 169 :85-95 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Chen, 2016 72. Zhang, Z. ∙ Chen, J. Atomic Structure of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Cell. 2016; 167 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). The map, at an overall resolution of 3.9 Å, reveals a ligand density as strong as those of the protein mainchain atoms ( Figure S5 A). This density is absent from any of the CFTR maps obtained in the absence of a corrector ( Figure S3 A). The density has an elongated L shape consistent with the chemical structure of lumacaftor ( Figure 1 A). A higher resolution (2.7 Å) structure was determined from phosphorylated, ATP-bound CFTR (E1371Q), which exhibits the NBD-dimerized conformation as expected ( Zhang et al., 2017 73. Zhang, Z. ∙ Liu, F. ∙ Chen, J. Conformational Changes of CFTR upon Phosphorylation and ATP Binding Cell. 2017; 170 :483-491 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 74. Zhang, Z. ∙ Liu, F. ∙ Chen, J. Molecular structure of the ATP-bound, phosphorylated human CFTR Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :12757-12762 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the same ligand-binding location, we observe a similarly strong but better-defined density that fits lumacaftor unambiguously ( Figures 2 C–2E and S3 A). These results indicate that lumacaftor binds to CFTR in both conformational states.
The binding site is located in TMD1, at the level where the phospholipid head groups of the inner membrane meet the hydrophobic core ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Lumacaftor interacts with CFTR predominantly through van der Waals interactions, except for a salt bridge with K68 ( Figures 2 D and 3 F). The BCC headgroup, a shared moiety among most type I correctors, inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by TM1, 2, 3, and 6 ( Figures 2 E and 2F). The shape of the BCC headgroup complements the narrow pocket in a classic “key in a lock” fashion ( Berg et al., 2019 4. Berg, J.M. ∙ Tymoczko, J.L. ∙ Gatto, G.J. ... Biochemistry W.H. Freeman/Macmillan Learning, 2019 Google Scholar ). The polar half of lumacaftor extends outside the pocket, tethering the cytoplasmic ends of TM1 and TM6 together by interacting with residues 70-74 on TM1 and L365 and I368 on TM6 ( Figures 2 D and 2E).
In agreement with the structure, previous studies showed that the minimal domain sensitive to lumacaftor contains the N-terminal 375 residues ( Ren et al., 2013 51. Ren, H.Y. ∙ Grove, D.E. ∙ De La Rosa, O. ... VX-809 corrects folding defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein through action on membrane-spanning domain 1 Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24 :3016-3024 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Removing residues 371-375 rendered lumacaftor ineffectual ( Ren et al., 2013 51. Ren, H.Y. ∙ Grove, D.E. ∙ De La Rosa, O. ... VX-809 corrects folding defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein through action on membrane-spanning domain 1 Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24 :3016-3024 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although residues 371-375 do not contact lumacaftor directly, they interact with N66 and P67, positioning TM1 to coordinate lumacaftor ( Figure 2 E, cyan ribbon). These observations underscore the structural role of residues 371-375 in constructing the binding site; they also support the previous conclusion that lumacaftor binds to TMD1 in its folded state ( Eckford et al., 2014 15.

The location and the chemical nature of lumacaftor-binding are very different from those of the potentiator ivacaftor ( Liu et al., 2019 38. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Levit, A. ... Structural identification of a hotspot on CFTR for potentiation Science. 2019; 364 :1184-1188 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lumacaftor inserts into a deep pocket in TMD1, and its affinity is mediated through a high degree of shape complementarity, which maximizes van der Waals interactions. In contrast, ivacaftor binds to a shallow cleft on TMD2 at the center of the membrane ( Figures 2 B and S3 A: bottom-right panel, arrow). Mutagenesis studies have shown that hydrogen bonds, rather than van der Waals interactions, play a predominant role in ivacaftor recognition ( Liu et al., 2019 38. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Levit, A. ... Structural identification of a hotspot on CFTR for potentiation Science. 2019; 364 :1184-1188 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The competition assay data suggested that lumacaftor and tezacaftor share an overlapping binding site on CFTR. To interrogate this conclusion, we determined the structure of tezacaftor-bound CFTR in the NBD-dimerized conformation to 3.8 Å resolution ( Figures 3 A–3C, S3 B, and S4 ; Table S1 ). Indeed, a ligand density is observed at the same location in TMD1 ( Figures 3 B–3E). Inside the hydrophobic pocket, the density also has an elongated shape that fits the BCC headgroup. The density outside the pocket is different than in the lumacaftor-bound structure in a manner consistent with structural differences between the two correctors ( Figures 1 A, 3 B, and 3C).
The BCC headgroup of tezacaftor interacts with the same set of pocket-lining residues as lumacaftor ( Figures 3 C and 3G). The polar region of tezacaftor, also exposed at the protein/lipid interface, interacts with CFTR in a slightly different manner. Instead of forming a salt bridge with K68, tezacaftor forms an H-bond with R74 ( Figures 3 C–3G). In addition, tezacaftor interacts with fewer residues in TM1 ( Figure 3 G), which may explain the relatively lower affinity ( Figure 1 C) and lower potency of tezacaftor ( Van Goor et al., 2011 63. Van Goor, F. ∙ Hadida, S. ∙ Grootenhuis, P.D. ... Correction of the F508del-CFTR protein processing defect in vitro by the investigational drug VX-809 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :18843-18848 Crossref Scopus (868) PubMed Google Scholar ; Van Goor et al., 2016, North Amer. Cystic Fibrosis Conference, poster abstract). Comparison of corrector-bound and -free structures reveals little difference, except for the dispositions of the K68 and R74 side chains ( Figure S5 ). Upon drug binding, the terminal nitrogen on K68 moves about 4 Å to interact with lumacaftor and the side chain of R74 moves 3 Å to interact with either drug.
Because the structures of drug complexes are of folded CFTR, one might ask whether the structurally identified binding site is the same site of action during CFTR biogenesis. To address this question, we introduced binding site mutations to the ΔF508-CFTR background and analyzed the ability of correctors to rescue these mutants ( Figure 4 A). Based on the structure, we reason that substituting small pocket-lining residues with larger ones would likely produce steric occlusion of both lumacaftor and tezacaftor. The effects of correctors were quantified using an established gel-shift assay, which measures the abundance of the fully glycosylated CFTR relative to the core-glycosylated form ( Figures 4 A and S3 C). As CFTR exports from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus and eventually reaches the plasma membrane, its molecular weight increases due to additional glycosylation ( Figure S3 C). Lumacaftor and tezacaftor increased the abundance of the mature, fully glycosylated form of the ΔF508 mutant ( Figure 4 A). This effect is severely diminished by the pocket-lining mutations L195W, A198Y, and S364F ( Figure 4 A). Furthermore, mutating the three polar residues R74, K68, and N71 generated different responses that are consistent with their structural roles in drug binding ( Figure 4 A). The R74A substitution lowers the efficacy of both lumacaftor and tezacaftor, consistent with the structures showing that it interacts with both drugs ( Figures 2 D, 3 C, 3D, 3F, and 3G). K68, on the other hand, forms a salt bridge with lumacaftor but makes no contact with tezacaftor ( Figures 3 D and 3F). Correspondingly, the K68I mutation diminished lumacaftor correction but did not affect tezacaftor. The side chain of N71 projects away from both drugs and its substitution did not affect either corrector ( Figures 2 D, 3 C, and 4 A). None of the mutations had a significant effect on the efficacy of elexacaftor/Corr4a, drugs that belong to different classes of correctors ( Figure 4 A). We also used confocal microscopy to localize CFTR variants in the presence and absence of correctors ( Data S1 ). Consistent with the maturation assay, ΔF508-CFTR is mostly retained in the ER; addition of lumacaftor increased the presence of ΔF508-CFTR at the plasmid membrane. Binding-site mutations L195W, A198Y, S364F, K68I, and R74A, but not the control N71I, specifically reduced the rescuing effects of lumacaftor. Non-type I correctors, on the other hand, were insensitive to the mutations.
To further correlate the functional effects of the direct binding of lumacaftor, we mutated the same residues in the background of wt CFTR and measured their affinities for lumacaftor via SPA. The pocket-lining mutations severely reduced lumacaftor binding, likely due to steric-hindrance ( Figure 4 B). The K68I and R74A reduced the affinities by 23- and 8-fold, respectively ( Figure 4 B). In contrast, the N71A mutant exhibited an affinity similar to that of the WT protein ( Figure 4 B). The specificity of these perturbations is further demonstrated in the competition assay, which shows that the binding of tezacaftor is reduced by substitutions of R74, but not K68 nor N71 ( Figure 4 C). These effects on corrector affinities were not due to defects in folding, as these mutants behaved biochemically similarly to that of WT protein and showed strong binding to ivacaftor, a potentiator that interacts within the TMD2 of CFTR ( Baroni et al., 2014 3. Baroni, D. ∙ Zegarra-Moran, O. ∙ Svensson, A. ... Direct interaction of a CFTR potentiator and a CFTR corrector with phospholipid bilayers Eur. Biophys. J. 2014; 43 :341-346 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2019 38. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Levit, A. ... Structural identification of a hotspot on CFTR for potentiation Science. 2019; 364 :1184-1188 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 D).
A recent study showed that lumacaftor does not rescue misfolded zebrafish CFTR (zCFTR) ( Laselva et al., 2019 35. Laselva, O. ∙ Erwood, S. ∙ Du, K. ... Activity of lumacaftor is not conserved in zebrafish Cftr bearing the major cystic fibrosis-causing mutation FASEB Bioadv. 2019; 1 :661-670 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ) even though its overall structure is very similar to that of human CFTR ( Liu et al., 2017 37. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Csanady, L. ... Molecular Structure of the Human CFTR Ion Channel Cell. 2017; 169 :85-95 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Chen, 2016 72. Zhang, Z. ∙ Chen, J. Atomic Structure of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Cell. 2016; 167 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three amino acids distinguish the lumacaftor-binding site in these two CFTR orthologs. A pocket-lining methionine, corresponding to T360 in human CFTR, owing to its larger side chain, likely occludes lumacaftor binding in zCFTR. Furthermore, residues equivalent to K68 and R74 are serine and alanine in zCFTR, respectively. These differences are likely to diminish lumacaftor binding, resulting in its inability to rescue misfolded zCFTR.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we present structures of CFTR in complex with type I correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor. Consistent with the structure-activity relationship, these two analogous compounds bind to a common site in TMD1. The location of the binding site is entirely consistent with functional studies demonstrating that lumacaftor promotes folding of isolated TMD1 but does not affect other domains ( Farinha et al., 2013 20.

Cell. 2013; 24 :3016-3024 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, binding of lumacaftor or tezacaftor did not alter the structure of CFTR, supporting the previous conclusion that lumacaftor stabilizes TMD1 in its native conformation ( Loo et al., 2013 40. Loo, T.W. ∙ Bartlett, M.C. ∙ Clarke, D.M. Corrector VX-809 stabilizes the first transmembrane domain of CFTR Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 86 :612-619 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding-site mutations that lowered the affinities of lumacaftor and tezacaftor also diminished their abilities to rescue ΔF508-CFTR, indicating that the structurally identified type I corrector-binding site is the site of action of these drugs to restore CFTR folding.
Earlier work from Braakman and colleagues showed that individual domains of CFTR begin to adopt a tertiary structure as the nascent chain emerges from the ribosome ( Kleizen et al., 2005 30. Kleizen, B. ∙ van Vlijmen, T. ∙ de Jonge, H.R. ... Folding of CFTR is predominantly cotranslational Mol. Cell. 2005; 20 :277-287 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Folding is completed after the TMDs, NBDs, and R domain assemble into the final structure ( Kleizen et al., 2005 30. Kleizen, B. ∙ van Vlijmen, T. ∙ de Jonge, H.R. ... Folding of CFTR is predominantly cotranslational Mol. Cell. 2005; 20 :277-287 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). The membrane-spanning region of CFTR contains a large number of polar residues, leading to inefficient and slow integration of TM helices in the membrane ( Carlson et al., 2005 5. Carlson, E. ∙ Bays, N. ∙ David, L. ... Reticulocyte lysate as a model system to study endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein degradation Methods Mol.

Cell. 2011; 22 :4461-4471 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, CFTR exhibits a domain-swapped configuration, such that TM helices 1, 2, 3, and 6 pack against TM 10 and 11 to form one bundle; and TM helices 4 and 5 interact with four helices in TMD2 to form another bundle. Such assembly cannot be established until the full-length protein is translated. It is estimated that CFTR synthesis takes about 10 min ( Ward and Kopito, 1994 68. Ward, C.L. ∙ Kopito, R.R.

Chem. 1994; 269 :25710-25718 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the subsequent folding and assembly of TMDs and NBDs takes about 30–120 min ( Amaral, 2004 2. Amaral, M.D. CFTR and chaperones: processing and degradation J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23 :41-48 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Skach, 2006 59. Skach, W.R.

During this process, partially folded intermediates linger in the ER, vulnerable to degradation. Consequently, only a small percentage of synthesized CFTR polypeptide reaches the cell surface even for the WT protein ( Lukacs et al., 1994 42. Lukacs, G.L. ∙ Mohamed, A. ∙ Kartner, N. ...

Folding mutations such as ΔF508 destabilize an individual domain and/or prevent effective interdomain assembly, leading to expansive premature degradation ( Cui et al., 2007 10.

The identification of the type I corrector binding site provides a structural basis to understand how these compounds promote CFTR folding. The N-terminal TMD1 is synthesized at an early stage of CFTR biogenesis and folds co-translationally ( Kleizen et al., 2005 30. Kleizen, B. ∙ van Vlijmen, T. ∙ de Jonge, H.R. ... Folding of CFTR is predominantly cotranslational Mol. Cell. 2005; 20 :277-287 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). The four TM helices forming the corrector-binding site are predicted to be unstable. Using an established algorithm ( Hessa et al., 2007 25. Hessa, T. ∙ Meindl-Beinker, N.M. ∙ Bernsel, A. ... Molecular code for transmembrane-helix recognition by the Sec61 translocon Nature. 2007; 450 :1026-1030 Crossref Scopus (561) PubMed Google Scholar ) to calculate the free energy for membrane insertion (ΔG insertion ), we find that TM helices 1, 2, 3, and 6 all have positive values, indicating that these helices individually are unstable in the membrane ( Table S2 ). Instability was also confirmed experimentally for TM6 ( Tector and Hartl, 1999 60. Tector, M. ∙ Hartl, F.U. An unstable transmembrane segment in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator EMBO J. 1999; 18 :6290-6298 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, the tertiary structure formed by TM1, 2, 3, and 6 contains a hydrophobic pocket penetrating into the core of the protein ( Figures 2 B, 2F, and 3 A). Based on the classic work of Matthews, Bowie, and colleagues, the destabilizing energy caused by an internal cavity of this size (360 Å 3 ) is substantial ( Eriksson et al., 1992 18. Eriksson, A.E. ∙ Baase, W.A. ∙ Zhang, X.J. ... Response of a protein structure to cavity-creating mutations and its relation to the hydrophobic effect Science. 1992; 255 :178-183 Crossref Scopus (921) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joh et al., 2009 28. Joh, N.H. ∙ Oberai, A. ∙ Yang, D. ... Similar energetic contributions of packing in the core of membrane and water-soluble proteins J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009; 131 :10846-10847 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lumacaftor and tezacaftor, with calculated LogP values of 4.96 and 5.52, respectively, have negative ΔG values for membrane partitioning ( Liu et al., 2011 36. Liu, X. ∙ Testa, B. ∙ Fahr, A. Lipophilicity and its relationship with passive drug permeation Pharm. Res. 2011; 28 :962-977 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of these correctors would structurally link TM 1, 2, 3, and 6 together and contribute to a net negative ΔG for partitioning of the complex. In this manner, the type I correctors are able to stabilize the partially folded TMD1 while it awaits the completion of inter-domain assembly.
Consistent with this analysis, Clarke and colleagues showed that lumacaftor increased the lifetime of TMD1 by about 5-fold ( Loo et al., 2013 40. Loo, T.W. ∙ Bartlett, M.C. ∙ Clarke, D.M. Corrector VX-809 stabilizes the first transmembrane domain of CFTR Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 86 :612-619 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). And most recently, Braakman’s laboratory demonstrated that the type I correctors lumacaftor and C18 act at an early folding stage, supporting the hypothesis that rescuing ΔF508 by lumacaftor arises from the increased stability of TMD1 ( Kleizen et al., 2021 31. Kleizen, B. ∙ van Willigen, M. ∙ Mijnders, M. ... Co-translational folding of the first transmembrane domain of ABC-transporter CFTR is supported by assembly with the first cytosolic domain J. Mol. Biol. 2021; 433 :166955 Published online December 20, 2020 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same thermodynamic argument also applies to mature CFTR, explaining why the type I correctors can increase the stability of ΔF508 at the plasma membrane ( Eckford et al., 2014 15. Eckford, P.D. ∙ Ramjeesingh, M. ∙ Molinski, S. ... VX-809 and related corrector compounds exhibit secondary activity stabilizing active F508del-CFTR after its partial rescue to the cell surface Chem.

Two Small Molecules Restore Stability to a Subpopulation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator with the Predominant Disease-causing Mutation J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :3706-3719 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, the aforementioned structural, theoretical, and experimental data collectively support the following mechanism of action for type I correctors ( Figure 5 ). Once the N-terminal TMD1 is synthesized, it adopts a tertiary structure that is intrinsically unstable in the ER membrane. Binding of lumacaftor or tezacaftor stabilizes TMD1, making it less susceptible to targeted degradation by protein quality control machinery. As CFTR folding is a highly co-operative process, stabilizing TMD1 would ultimately increase the overall probability of forming a fully assembled structure and thereby allosterically rescue many disease-causing mutants that reside in other parts of CFTR. This mechanism is also consistent with the synergy between lumacaftor and suppressor mutations ( Farinha et al., 2013 20. Farinha, C.M. ∙ King-Underwood, J. ∙ Sousa, M. ... Revertants, low temperature, and correctors reveal the mechanism of F508del-CFTR rescue by VX-809 and suggest multiple agents for full correction Chem. Biol. 2013; 20 :943-955 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ; Okiyoneda et al., 2013 46. Okiyoneda, T. ∙ Veit, G. ∙ Dekkers, J.F. ... Mechanism-based corrector combination restores ΔF508-CFTR folding and function Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9 :444-454 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ): lumacaftor extends the lifetime of TMD1 and the suppressor mutations stabilize different parts of CFTR or enhance inter-domain assembly, and thus together they achieve higher rescuing efficiency ( Figure 5 ).
CFTR correctors, discovered empirically, are the most successful drugs to treat diseases caused by defects in protein folding. The proposed mechanism for CFTR correctors provides a conceptual framework to understand how a small molecule can influence protein folding. This concept, rooted in the energetics of protein folding, may also apply to other pharmacological chaperones targeting various misfolded proteins. As of today, most small molecule chaperones were developed as competitive inhibitors binding at the enzymatic active sites ( Tran et al., 2020 61. Tran, M.L. ∙ Génisson, Y. ∙ Ballereau, S. ... Second-Generation Pharmacological Chaperones: Beyond Inhibitors Molecules. 2020; 25 :E3145 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). The disadvantage of this approach is that the drug stabilizes folding of the disease-causing mutants, but at the same time, it diminishes enzymatic activity. An alternative approach would be to develop compounds that bind and increase the stability of an individual domain within the target protein. As most proteins fold co-translationally, such compounds can revert folding mutations through an allosteric effect as observed for the CFTR type I correctors.
In this study, we identified the binding site of two CFTR drugs lumacaftor and tezacaftor. Based on the structures and thermodynamic principles, we proposed a mechanism of how these molecules improve CFTR folding. Nevertheless, there are limitations associated with the employed techniques. The structures were determined using purified wt CFTR instead of disease-related variants such as ΔF508-CFTR. Therefore, the structures do not capture folding defects caused by mutations nor the partially folded structure during CFTR biogenesis. The gel-shift maturation assay reports the relative amounts of glycosylated CFTR, but not the absolute level of rescue efficiency. Lastly, using in vitro binding assays, we presented evidence that non-type I correctors do not compete for the same binding site with lumacaftor and tezacaftor; however, this work does not describe the mechanisms of those non-type I correctors. It would be important to understand other types of correctors. Studies of tezacaftor, ivacaftor, and elexacaftor together will collectively reveal the mechanism of the most advanced therapy Trikafta, which is a combination of these three modulators.

This study did not generate new unique reagents.
Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic. HEK293S GnTl - cells were cultured in Freestyle 293 (GIBCO) supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic. HEK293F cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic. CHO K-1 cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X GlutaMAX (GIBCO).
All mutations were introduced using the SPRINP mutagenesis methodology (Table S3) ( Edelheit et al., 2009 16. Edelheit, O. ∙ Hanukoglu, A. ∙ Hanukoglu, I. Simple and efficient site-directed mutagenesis using two single-primer reactions in parallel to generate mutants for protein structure-function studies BMC Biotechnol. 2009; 9 :61 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutagenesis primers were designed to be complementary, be of 15-45 nt length and contain the mutated bases close to the center. The parental plasmid containing CFTR cDNA was amplified in two separated reactions congaing either forward or reverse primer. Next, two single-primer PCR products were combined, denatured (95°C, 5 min.) and cooled gradually over 5 min. to 37°C. The sample was digested for 12 hr. in 37°C. 3 mL of the digest was added to 50 mL of competent XL1-Blue cells for transformation. The cell suspension was spread on LB/ampicillin plates. After incubating the plates overnight at 37°C random colonies were picked and expanded. Purified plasmid DNA (QIAGEN Plasmid Kit) was sent for sequencing (Genewiz).
All CFTR constructs were expressed and purified as described ( Goehring et al., 2014 21. Goehring, A. ∙ Lee, C.H. ∙ Wang, K.H. ... Screening and large-scale expression of membrane proteins in mammalian cells for structural studies Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2574-2585 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang and Chen, 2016 72. Zhang, Z. ∙ Chen, J. Atomic Structure of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Cell. 2016; 167 :1586-1597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, bacmids carrying CFTR constructs were generated in E. Coli DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were produced and amplified in Sf9 cells. Proteins were expressed in HEK293S GnTl - cells infected with 10% baculovirus at a density of 2.7x10 6 cells/mL. Cells were induced with 10 mM sodium butyrate 12 hours after infection and cultured at 30°C for another 48 hours before harvesting. Proteins for cryo-EM studies were purified as the following. Cells were solubilized in buffer containing 1.2% 2,2- didecylpropane-1,3-bis-b-D-maltopyranoside (LMNG) and 0.24% Cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS). Protein was purified via its C-terminal green fluorescence protein (GFP) tag using GFP nanobody coupled Sepharose Beads (GE Healthcare) and eluted by removing the GFP tag with the PreScission Protease. The wild-type sample was de-phosphorylated using l-phosphatase. The CFTR (E1371Q) sample was phosphorylated with protein kinase A. At the final step, protein samples were purified on size exclusion chromatography in 0.06% ( wt CFTR/lumacaftor and CFTR (E1371Q)/tezacaftor samples) or 0.03% (CFTR (E1371Q)/lumacaftor) digitonin. Samples for SPA assays were purified using the same protocol except that they were not treated with Protein Kinase A nor l-phosphatase.
Immediately after size exclusion chromatography, the CFTR (E1371Q) sample (at 5 mg/mL) was incubated with 10 mM ATP, 8 mM MgCl 2 and 200 μM lumacaftor or tezacaftor on ice for 30 min. The wt CFTR sample (5mg/mL; 32 μM) was incubated with 200 μM lumacaftor. About 3 mM fluorinated Fos-choline-8 was added to the samples right before freezing on to Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 400 mesh Au grids using Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI).
Cryo-EM images were collected on a 300 kV Titian Krios (FEI) with a K2 or K3 Summit detector (Gatan) using SerialEM (Table S1). The images were corrected for gain reference and binned by 2. Drift correction was performed using MotionCorr ( Zheng et al., 2017 75. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 52. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: Fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2721) PubMed Google Scholar ) and GCTF ( Zhang, 2016 71. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on CTFFIND4 results, all the images at resolution lower than 5Å were removed. For further processing steps, GCTF generated values were used. Particles were automatically picked by Gautomatch ( https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/ ) for the wt CFTR/lumacaftor and CFTR(E1371Q)/tezacaftor datasets. For the CFTR (E1371Q)/lumacaftor data, picking was performed using RELION implemented Laplacian-of-Gaussian blob detection. All the subsequent steps of maps reconstruction and resolution estimations were performed using RELION 3.1( Scheres, 2012 54. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3548) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Figure S1, S2, S4).
Each dataset processing was optimized individually to obtain the best results. In general, after the first 3D classification, the 3D refinement was performed and followed by a second run of 3D classification without particles orientation optimization. However, in the case of the tezacaftor dataset, using reference model filtered to different resolutions (8 Å, 25 Å or 60 Å) gave similar quality maps but of different particles distribution. After visual inspection, the best quality classes from each run were combined and particle duplicates were removed. The resulting set of particles was refined to a higher resolution than any of the sets from individual 3D classifications. The combined particle set was polished, 3D refined, and 3D classified again against a model at 25 Å resolution. For the two lumacaftor datasets, changing the resolution of the reference model did not make significant difference (Figure S1, S2, S4).
The initial protein models were built by fitting the published CFTR structures (PDB: 5UAK and 6O1V ) into the cryo-EM maps using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 50. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32501) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the wt CFTR/lumacaftor structure, the sidechains of the NBDs were trimmed due to the limited resolution of ∼4.5 Å (Figure S1). Models were then adjusted based on the cryo-EM densities using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 17. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25035) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lumacaftor and tezacaftor were built into the drug density and refined in PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18121) PubMed Google Scholar ) using restrains generated by eLBOW ( Moriarty et al., 2009 45. Moriarty, N.W. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. electronic Ligand Builder and Optimization Workbench (eLBOW): a tool for ligand coordinate and restraint generation Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2009; 65 :1074-1080 Crossref Scopus (867) PubMed Google Scholar ). MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 6. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (10875) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for geometries validation.
Model overfitting was assessed as described ( Johnson and Chen, 2017 29. Johnson, Z.L. ∙ Chen, J. Structural Basis of Substrate Recognition by the Multidrug Resistance Protein MRP1 Cell. 2017; 168 :1075-1085 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each model refined against half-map 1, converted to an electron density map using UCSF Chimera, and SPIDER ( Shaikh et al., 2008 57. Shaikh, T.R. ∙ Gao, H. ∙ Baxter, W.T. ... SPIDER image processing for single-particle reconstruction of biological macromolecules from electron micrographs Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :1941-1974 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to calculate FSC plots between the converted map and the full map, the half-map 1, and the half-map 2. The cryo-EM maps were masked with a generous mask about 3.5 times larger than the volume of the model density. The FSC plots were then corrected for the volume by which the mask exceeds the volume of the model density using Equation 1 : 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐶 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 = 𝑓 ∗ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐶 1 + ( 𝑓 − 1 ) ∗ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐶 (1)
Where 𝑓 is equal to the factor by which the mask exceeds the volume of the model density (Figure S1, S2, S4).
HEK293F cells grown in a 6-well plate were transiently transfected with CFTR constructs labeled with C-terminal eGFP tag using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) in Opti-MEM (GIBCO) medium. Cells were incubated with DNA/transfection mixture for 12 hours at 37°C, then in DMEM F-12 supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate and the corrector of choice at 30°C for another 24 hours. Cells were harvested by re-suspending in 1 mL ice-cold PBS and spun down in 1.5 mL tubes for 5 min. at 5,000 rpm, 4°C.
Cell pellets were re-suspended in buffer containing 1.2% 2,2- didecylpropane-1,3-bis-b-D-maltopyranoside (LMNG) and 0.24% Cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) and rotated for 60 min. at 4°C. Cell lysates were spun down for 60 min. at 45,000 rpm, supernatants were analyzed on a 4%–20% gradient tris-glycine SDS-PAGE gel (ThermoFisher). Gels were imaged to visualize the GFP signal, which was quantified using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 55. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (38229) PubMed Google Scholar ). The background signal was subtracted from the CFTR bands. The proportion of mature CFTR to total CFTR (k m/t ) was calculated using Equation 2 and then normalized to that of the DMSO treated sample. The statistical significance was calculated using the one-way ANOVA method implemented in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA, https://www.graphpad.com ). 𝑘 𝑚 / 𝑡 = 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 + 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑅 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ) (2)
The binding and competition assays were performed as described ( Liu et al., 2019 38. Liu, F. ∙ Zhang, Z. ∙ Levit, A. ... Structural identification of a hotspot on CFTR for potentiation Science. 2019; 364 :1184-1188 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). CFTR constructs used in this assay contain a C-terminal Strep-tag, followed by a PreScission Protease cleavage site, and a GFP tag. The GFP tag was removed during purification whereas the Strep-tag was retained to attach CFTR to the SPA beads. To measure lumacaftor binding, 5 nM CFTR was incubated with 0.5 mg/mL YSi streptavidin SPA beads (PerkinElmer) in the presence of varying concentrations of lumacaftor (at 1:1 molar ratio of cold and [ 3 H] lumacaftor (6.4 Ci/mmol, synthesized by Moravek) in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.06% digitonin, 2 mM DTT and 0.1% Tween 20 at 4°C for 1 hr. The reactions were carried out in 96-well non-binding surface microplates (Corning) and data were recorded using a Microbeta Trilux plate reader (PerkinElmer). Specific binding was obtained by subtracting background radioligand binding in the absence of protein. The K d values were calculated by fitting the data with a single-site saturation binding model accounting for ligand depletion using GraphPad Prism 8. The K i values of tezacaftor were calculated by fitting the data with a single-site competitive binding model in GraphPad Prism 8. The readings were normalized by dividing the specific binding with the total binding (Bmax) and represented in percentages.
CHO cells were seeded in Ibidi μ-Slide 4 Well Ph+ chambered coverslips and cultured in CHO media. After 24 hours at 37°C, cell media was exchanged for OpitMEM and cells were transiently transfected with mCherry tagged Tapasin and eGFP tagged CFTR isoforms using Lipofectamine 3000 according to manufacturer’s instructions. About 12 hours after transfection, the media was exchanged back to CHO cell media supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate and selected drug (lumacaftor at 1 μM, tezacaftor at 10 μM or elexacaftor at 0.2 μM and Corr4a at 10 μM cocktail). DMSO (0.1%) were included in all samples. Next, cells were incubated at 30°C for 24 hours and then were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min at room temperature), stained with Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (15 min at room temperature), and mounted with glycerol/n-propyl gallate. Imaging was performed using the Abberior Facility Line STED/confocal system with a 100X/1.40 NA oil objective (Olympus UPLSAPO100XO objective, oil r.i. 1.518 at 23°C) on an Olympus IX83 stand, pulsed 405 / 485 / 561 / 640 nm excitation laser lines, and spectral detection setup with single-photon-counting avalanche photodiode (APD) detectors. Pixel sizes and z-steps were computed to satisfy Nyquist criteria. Images were acquired as .obf file format using Abberior Imspector software, which automatically adjusted the detection bands (eGFP:498-551nm, mCherry:571-630nm, Alexa Fluor 647:650-760nm) and the confocal pinhole (1 A.U) based on selected wavelengths. Care was taken to avoid pixel saturation and bleaching by optimizing laser power, accumulation and pixel dwell times, while trying to collect an optimal number of photons. Acquisition parameters were kept constant between images. Post-acquisition, images were further processed and analyzed in Fiji.
Structural figures were generated using UCSF Chimera, PyMOL and Fiji. Plots were generated using GraphPad Prism8. Particles Euler angle histograms were generated using plot_indiveuler_histogram_fromstarfile.py script ( https://github.com/leschzinerlab/Relion ). All the figures were assembled using Adobe Illustrator.
The quantification and statistical analyses are integral parts of the software and algorithms used. Details are described in the main text and methods sections.
