Title: All-Optical Electrophysiology Reveals the Role of Lateral Inhibition in Sensory Processing in Cortical Layer 1


Abstract: Summary

Cortical layer 1 (L1) interneurons have been proposed as a hub for attentional modulation of underlying cortex, but the transformations that this circuit implements are not known. We combined genetically targeted voltage imaging with optogenetic activation and silencing to study the mechanisms underlying sensory processing in mouse barrel cortex L1. Whisker stimuli evoked precisely timed single spikes in L1 interneurons, followed by strong lateral inhibition. A mild aversive stimulus activated cholinergic inputs and evoked a bimodal distribution of spiking responses in L1. A simple conductance-based model that only contained lateral inhibition within L1 recapitulated the sensory responses and the winner-takes-all cholinergic responses, and the model correctly predicted that the network would function as a spatial and temporal high-pass filter for excitatory inputs. Our results demonstrate that all-optical electrophysiology can reveal basic principles of neural circuit function in vivo and suggest an intuitive picture for how L1 transforms sensory and modulatory inputs.

Section: Introduction

The brain receives myriad sensory inputs. It must distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant. An input can merit attention either through its intrinsic properties (novelty, salience) or through learned associations. The sparse interneurons of neocortical layer 1 (L1) have been hypothesized as a hub for integrating these factors and modulating the underlying cortex to gate sensory processing ( Jiang et al., 2013; Letzkus et al., 2011; Takesian et al., 2018 27.

The primary outputs of L1 appear to be via inhibition of deeper-lying interneurons and thereby dis-inhibition of pyramidal neurons ( Jiang et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Letzkus et al., 2011; Takesian et al., 2018 27.

Electrophysiological, genetic, and anatomical studies have identified four sub-types of interneurons within L1 ( Schuman et al., 2019 59. Schuman, B. ∙ Machold, R.P. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ... Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). These cells fall into two broad classes ( Jiang et al., 2015 28. Jiang, X. ∙ Shen, S. ∙ Cadwell, C.R. ... Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex Science. 2015; 350 :aac9462 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Laterally projecting neurogliaform cells primarily synapse within L1 and show late-spiking non-adapting firing pattern in acute slices ( Cadwell et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2003; Cruikshank et al., 2012; Schuman et al., 2019 9.

Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Downward projecting single bouquet-like cells primarily dis-inhibit underlying pyramidal neurons and show a non-late spiking adapting firing pattern ( Jiang et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Letzkus et al., 2011; Takesian et al., 2018 27.

It is not known how these properties combine in awake animals to transform L1 inputs to outputs. Indeed, the function of L1 has been called a “crowning mystery” ( Schuman et al., 2019 59. Schuman, B. ∙ Machold, R.P. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ... Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hubel, 1982 25. Hubel, D.H. Cortical neurobiology: a slanted historical perspective Annual Review of Neuroscience. 1982; 5 :363-370 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ).
L1 is unique among cortical layers for having purely inhibitory short-range connectivity. In mutually inhibitory networks, competition between concurrently activated units can lead to winner-takes-all or point-attractor dynamics ( Koyama et al., 2016 30. Koyama, M. ∙ Minale, F. ∙ Shum, J. ... A circuit motif in the zebrafish hindbrain for a two alternative behavioral choice to turn left or right eLife. 2016; 5 :e16808 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This motif has been proposed as a general means to implement multiple forced-choice calculations (i.e., in which small disparities in excitatory inputs are amplified to select one among multiple possible firing modes) ( Machens et al., 2005 39. Machens, C.K. ∙ Romo, R. ∙ Brody, C.D. Flexible control of mutual inhibition: a neural model of two-interval discrimination Science. 2005; 307 :1121-1124 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). Considering the proposed role of L1 in gating sensory processing—where multiple inputs compete for attention—it is interesting to ask what kinds of dynamics arise in this circuit in vivo .
Electrophysiological studies in L1 in vivo have been challenging due to the sparseness of neuronal cell bodies. Although a few whole-cell patch clamp recordings have been performed in anesthetized rats ( Egger et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2013; Zhu and Zhu, 2004 15. Egger, R. ∙ Schmitt, A.C. ∙ Wallace, D.J. ... Robustness of sensory-evoked excitation is increased by inhibitory inputs to distal apical tuft dendrites Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112 :14072-14077 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar 27. Jiang, X. ∙ Wang, G. ∙ Lee, A.J. ... The organization of two new cortical interneuronal circuits Nat.

Neurosci. 2004; 24 :1272-1279 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), technical difficulties prevented similar acquisitions in awake animals. Recent advances in genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) enabled voltage imaging with single-neuron, single-spike resolution in vivo in near-surface neurons ( Abdelfattah et al., 2019; Adam et al., 2019; Piatkevich et al., 2019; Villette et al., 2019 1.

Paired expression of near-infrared GEVIs based on Archaerhodopsin 3 (Arch) ( Kralj et al., 2011 31. Kralj, J.M. ∙ Douglass, A.D. ∙ Hochbaum, D.R. ... Optical recording of action potentials in mammalian neurons using a microbial rhodopsin Nat. Methods. 2011; 9 :90-95 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ) with blue-excited channelrhodopsin actuators enabled optical measurements of excitability in vivo (Optopatch) ( Adam et al., 2019; Lou et al., 2016 3.

Fan, L.Z. ∙ Nehme, R. ∙ Adam, Y. ... All-optical synaptic electrophysiology probes mechanism of ketamine-induced disinhibition Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). These advances open the possibility for optical explorations of L1 circuit function in awake animals.
Using a holographic structured illumination imaging system and a recently developed soma-localized GEVI derived from Arch, SomArchon ( Piatkevich et al., 2019 52. Piatkevich, K.D. ∙ Bensussen, S. ∙ Tseng, H.A. ... Population imaging of neural activity in awake behaving mice Nature. 2019; 574 :413-417 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), we probed the circuit function of L1 interneurons in barrel cortex of awake mice. We developed an all-optical technique to resolve the separate contributions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to membrane potential. Experiments with patterned optogenetic activation and silencing, paired with voltage imaging, revealed that strong lateral inhibition within the L1 microcircuit plays a dominant role in setting the network responses to sensory and neuromodulatory inputs. Mutual inhibition led to high-pass temporal and spatial filtering of excitatory inputs, whereas under strong cholinergic drive the circuit showed winner-takes-all attractor dynamics.
A simple conductance-based model that incorporates the known electrophysiology and connectivity of L1 interneurons captured the main features of our sensory and neuromodulatory data and predicted responses to several types of inputs which we tested experimentally. The model also predicted that the sensitivity of the L1 microcircuit to thalamic inputs should show an inverted-U dependence on cholinergic drive, reminiscent of the Yerkes-Dodson relation between performance and arousal ( Yerkes and Dodson, 1908 66. Yerkes, R.M. ∙ Dodson, J.D. The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation J. Comp. Neurol. Psychol. 1908; 18 :459-482 Crossref Google Scholar ). This prediction can be tested in future experiments.

Section: Results

We analyzed the sources of signal and noise in optical voltage recordings with the goal to achieve millivolt-sensitivity recordings of subthreshold dynamics in vivo . Voltage signals in tissue arise solely from the neuronal membrane. In epifluorescence images, the soma perimeter appeared brighter than the center, a geometrical projection effect caused by viewing membranes edge-on. We thus reasoned that incident photons would most efficiently produce signal if targeted to the soma perimeter. Confocal-like excitation combined with spatially filtered emission also minimized optical crosstalk from out-of-focus cells.
We built a holographic structured illumination system, similar to Lutz et al. (2008) 38. Lutz, C. ∙ Otis, T.S. ∙ DeSars, V. ... Holographic photolysis of caged neurotransmitters Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :821-827 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar , to achieve this precisely targeted illumination with red (λ = 639 nm) light for excitation of SomArchon ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ; Methods S1 ; STAR Methods ). SomArchon fluorescence from all holographically targeted spots was recorded simultaneously on a scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. All recordings were performed at a 1 kHz frame rate. Spatial filters were applied digitally in post-processing to separate signal from background ( STAR Methods ). A digital micromirror device (DMD) patterned blue illumination for targeted optogenetic stimulation ( Figure 1 A; Table S1 ; Methods S1 ).
We characterized the performance of the imaging system in cortical L1 and superficial L2/3 in vivo ( STAR Methods ). Under wide-field red illumination, SomArchon-expressing neurons were not visible due to high background from scattered and out-of-focus light ( Figure 1 B). Illumination targeted to the somas revealed individual cells ( Figure 1 B; Methods S1 ). Holographic membrane focal illumination significantly improved the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of optically detected spikes (spike amplitude:baseline noise in a 1 kHz bandwidth 11.4 ± 1.4 membrane focal versus 7.5 ± 1.3 whole soma, mean ± SEM, paired measurements in n = 10 cells, matched laser power per cell between illumination patterns) ( Figure 1 C).
A challenge with 1-photon voltage imaging is to ensure that the fluorescence ascribed to each cell is not contaminated by crosstalk from other simultaneously imaged cells or from out-of-focus background. To characterize crosstalk between in-focus cells, we quantified the fluorescence signal (spike amplitude) in concentric rings centered on individual holographically illuminated cells ( Figure S1 ). At 6 μm from the cell boundary, signal amplitude decayed to 7% ± 6% of the on-cell signal (mean ± SD, n = 4 cells), and was undetectable (<1% of on-cell signal) at 20 μm from the boundary.
To characterize out-of-focus crosstalk, we recorded from individual cells as a function of optical defocus. With membrane focal illumination, fluorescence amplitude decayed by 50% over 15 μm deeper defocus, but more slowly with shallower defocus, whereas with whole-soma illumination this fluorescence decay was ~2-fold slower ( Figure S1 ).
We used activity-based image segmentation to remove residual out-of-focus crosstalk. A penalized matrix decomposition algorithm separated true voltage signals from crosstalk based on the different spatial profiles of these two signal sources ( Buchanan et al., 2018 8. Buchanan, E.K. ∙ Kinsella, I. ∙ Zhou, D. ... Penalized matrix decomposition for denoising, compression, and improved demixing of functional imaging data bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Google Scholar ). Application of the algorithm to simulated data with realistic noise ( Adam et al., 2019 3. Adam, Y. ∙ Kim, J.J. ∙ Lou, S. ... Voltage imaging and optogenetics reveal behaviour-dependent changes in hippocampal dynamics Nature. 2019; 569 :413-417 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ), and to composite movies where optical crosstalk was inserted “by hand” confirmed that the extracted signals were highly robust to crosstalk ( Figure S1 ; STAR Methods ).
Finally, we used simultaneous patch clamp and fluorescence measurements in acute slices to assess the precision of the optical voltage measurements. Optical and electrical recordings showed close correspondence, both for spikes and subthreshold events ( Figure S1 ).
The holographic optical system enabled high-resolution recordings in several genetically defined cell types across L1 and superficial L2/3 in awake head-fixed mice ( Figure 1 D). 5HT 3A R-Cre transgenic mice expressed primarily in L1 interneurons ( Lee et al., 2010; Takesian et al., 2018 33. Lee, S. ∙ Hjerling-Leffler, J. ∙ Zagha, E. ... The largest group of superficial neocortical GABAergic interneurons expresses ionotropic serotonin receptors J. Neurosci. 2010; 30 :16796-16808 Crossref Scopus (449) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Takesian, A.E. ∙ Bogart, L.J. ∙ Lichtman, J.W. ... Inhibitory circuit gating of auditory critical-period plasticity Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :218-227 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), somatostatin (SST)-Cre transgenic mice expressed in interneurons in deeper layers ( Neske et al., 2015 47. Neske, G.T. ∙ Patrick, S.L. ∙ Connors, B.W. Contributions of diverse excitatory and inhibitory neurons to recurrent network activity in cerebral cortex J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :1089-1105 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CKII(0.4)-Cre virus drove dense pan-neuronal expression in wild-type mice. In all three populations, two-photon fluorescence images of an appended eGFP tag showed membrane-localized and somatically restricted expression ( Figure S1 ).
Action potentials were recorded with SNR 12 ± 4 (mean ± SD, n = 16 cells) throughout L1 at depths between 20 and 150 μm at a mean laser power of 3 mW/cell. In SST-Cre mice, optical recordings were made in superficial L2/3 (100–230 μm depth) with SNR 9 ± 4 (mean ± SD, n = 6 cells). Figure 1 D shows a recording at depth of ~230 μm with SNR 7. SNR was ~2-fold greater for near-surface neurons (<100 μm depth, 14 ± 4, mean ± SD, n = 22 neurons) than at 150–200 μm (8 ± 3, mean ± SD, n = 7 neurons) ( Figure 1 E). We imaged multiple neurons simultaneously to a depth of 150 μm ( Figure 1 D).
For an SNR of 7 and a spike-detection threshold set at 4σ above the baseline noise, the expected false-positive rate is <0.3 spikes per 10-s recording, and the expected false-negative rate (missed spikes) is <0.14% of true spikes ( STAR Methods ). We used the refractory period after true spikes to test the false-positive rate. A spike-triggered autocorrelogram showed a probability <10 −3 of two spikes occurring within 5 ms of each other (n = 27 cells) ( Figure 1 F), confirming the physiological origin of the detected spikes.
Next, we sought to combine optogenetic perturbations (activation and silencing) with simultaneous voltage imaging. For optogenetic activation, we paired SomArchon with a blue light-activated soma-localized channelrhodopsin, SomCheRiff ( Adam et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2018; Hochbaum et al., 2014 3. Adam, Y. ∙ Kim, J.J. ∙ Lou, S. ... Voltage imaging and optogenetics reveal behaviour-dependent changes in hippocampal dynamics Nature. 2019; 569 :413-417 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar 18. Fan, L.Z. ∙ Nehme, R. ∙ Adam, Y. ... All-optical synaptic electrophysiology probes mechanism of ketamine-induced disinhibition Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :823-831 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Hochbaum, D.R. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Farhi, S.L. ... All-optical electrophysiology in mammalian neurons using engineered microbial rhodopsins Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :825-833 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This channelrhodopsin has previously been shown to have negligible activation at the 639 nm wavelength used to excite Arch-derived GEVIs ( Hochbaum et al., 2014 24. Hochbaum, D.R. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Farhi, S.L. ... All-optical electrophysiology in mammalian neurons using engineered microbial rhodopsins Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :825-833 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). For co-expression in vivo , we made a Cre-dependent bicistronic AAV construct that we called Optopatch4.
In awake, head-fixed 5-HT 3A R-Cre mice expressing Optopatch4, single-cell targeted optogenetic stimulation through a cortical window ( I = 1.8–21 mW/mm 2 ) evoked sustained spiking which was clearly resolved via holographically targeted voltage imaging ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Measurements using laterally offset spots showed little crosstalk of stimulation to surrounding cells, which had a mean spacing of ~60 μm ( Meyer et al., 2013 45. Meyer, H.S. ∙ Egger, R. ∙ Guest, J.M. ... Cellular organization of cortical barrel columns is whisker-specific Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :19113-19118 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 ).
Optogenetic silencing can be a powerful tool to determine the roles of specific neural populations in network dynamics, but optogenetic silencing has not previously been paired with voltage imaging. The action spectrum of a soma-localized blue-shifted chloride channel, stGtACR2 ( Mahn et al., 2018 40. Mahn, M. ∙ Gibor, L. ∙ Patil, P. ... High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4125 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggested it could be spectrally orthogonal to SomArchon. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells expressing stGtACR2, blue light ( I = 0.2–1 mW/mm 2 ) evoked large inhibitory photocurrents (~0.5 nA), but red light at intensities used for voltage imaging (635 nm, 0.1–10 W/mm 2 ) did not induce observable photocurrents, nor did it impair blue light-mediated channel gating ( Figure S3 ). Thus, SomArchon and stGtACR2 constitute a spectrally orthogonal pair appropriate for inhibitory Optopatch (i-Optopatch).
In head-fixed, awake mice expressing i-Optopatch in L1 ( STAR Methods ), targeted optogenetic stimuli ( I = 1.8–21 mW/mm 2 ) inhibited spontaneous spiking (spontaneous spike rate 3.2 ± 0.7 Hz versus 0.4 ± 0.3 Hz with blue light at I = 1.8 mW/mm 2 , p = 3 × 10 −3 , two-sided paired-sample t test) ( Figures 1 I and 1K). Optogenetic stimulation also hyperpolarized resting membrane potential by −13.5% ± 4% of spike height (mean ± SEM, n = 14 neurons, I = 1.8 mW/mm 2 , 2 mice) ( Figures 1 J and 1K). These results establish i-Optopatch as a tool for assessing how targeted optogenetic silencing affects network dynamics.
We used this suite of tools to dissect the circuit function of L1 during sensory processing ( Figures 2 A and 2B). We first characterized the intrinsic excitability properties of L1 neurons. In acute slices from 5HT 3A R-Cre mice expressing Optopatch4, single-cell L1-targeted optogenetic stimuli evoked characteristic firing patterns, including bursting adapting and late-spiking non-adapting phenotypes, as previously reported ( Chu et al., 2003 10. Chu, Z. ∙ Galarreta, M. ∙ Hestrin, S. Synaptic interactions of late-spiking neocortical neurons in layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :96-102 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), although not all neurons had a clear classification ( Figure S4 ). Neurons recorded in vivo sequentially under isoflurane anesthesia and then wakefulness showed characteristic firing patterns preserved between the two brain states ( Figure S4 ). The in vivo recordings did not clearly resolve into distinct sub-classes based on firing patterns, consistent with prior results ( Cadwell et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2003 9. Cadwell, C.R. ∙ Palasantza, A. ∙ Jiang, X. ... Electrophysiological, transcriptomic and morphologic profiling of single neurons using Patch-seq Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :199-203 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar 10. Chu, Z. ∙ Galarreta, M. ∙ Hestrin, S. Synaptic interactions of late-spiking neocortical neurons in layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :96-102 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore treated all 5-HT 3A R-positive neurons measured in vivo as a single population.
Next, we used voltage imaging to characterize the sensory-evoked responses in L1 interneurons. Barrel fields corresponding to individual whiskers (B2, C2, D2) were identified by intrinsic imaging ( Figure S5 ; STAR Methods ). In mice anesthetized with isoflurane and in awake mice, brief stimuli to individual whiskers (~1 mm deflection, ~8 mm from the base, 20 ms duration, repeated at 0.5 Hz) ( STAR Methods ) elicited excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and often single spikes in L1 neurons in the corresponding barrel fields ( Figures 2 C and 2D). Whisker stimuli were substantially more effective in eliciting spikes in anesthetized mice than in awake mice (anesthetized: 135 spikes from 153 trials, n = 24 cells versus awake: 73 spikes from 126 trials, n = 24 cells), consistent with prior studies in other cortical layers ( Haider et al., 2013 22. Haider, B. ∙ Häusser, M. ∙ Carandini, M. Inhibition dominates sensory responses in the awake cortex Nature. 2013; 493 :97-100 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The delay from stimulus onset to spike peak was 16 ± 2 ms in anesthetized mice (mean ± SD, n = 135 events, 24 neurons, 3 mice) ( Figure 2 E) and 16 ± 3 ms in awake mice (mean ± SD, n = 73 events, 21 neurons, 3 mice) ( Figure S5 ). Similar delay and jitter were previously reported in L4 pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons, both of which receive direct thalamic inputs ( Gabernet et al., 2005 20. Gabernet, L. ∙ Jadhav, S.P. ∙ Feldman, D.E. ... Somatosensory integration controlled by dynamic thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition Neuron. 2005; 48 :315-327 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess how much of the jitter reflected variation in input timing versus variation in the intrinsic responses of individual L1 neurons, we then compared the relative delay in spike time between simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons in anesthetized mice. The mean relative delay was 0.9 ms (n = 14 pairs, 66 trials in which both cells spiked) ( Figure 2 E). Remarkably, despite the small delay, the order of firing was preserved in all pairs in all trials, to within our 1 ms time resolution (i.e., if cell A fired before cell B in a single trial, then cell A fired before cell B in all trials). These observations indicate that abrupt sensory inputs drove millisecond-precision spike sequences in L1.
We observed striking differences in the subthreshold dynamics between spontaneous versus whisker-evoked spikes, in both anesthetized and awake animals. Spike-triggered average (STA) waveforms of spontaneous spikes rode atop a baseline depolarization that both preceded and followed the spike, whereas whisker-evoked spikes arose abruptly and were followed by a period of hyperpolarization ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Stimulus-triggered average waveforms of whisker deflection trials that did not induce spikes also showed a depolarization followed by a hyperpolarization ( Figure S5 ). Together, these results implied that whisker stimulus evoked synaptic excitation followed by synaptic inhibition.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that in awake animals, whisker stimulation evoked single spikes and then transiently suppressed spontaneous L1 activity (before stimulus firing rate: 3.6 ± 0.85 Hz; 30 to 105 ms post-stimulus: 1.2 ± 0.65 Hz, mean ± SEM, n = 24 cells p = 0.004, Kruskal-Wallis test) ( Figure 2 H). Sensory-evoked network suppression was particularly apparent when the sensory stimulus fortuitously arrived during a burst of spontaneous activity ( Figure 2 H).
Sensory-evoked network suppression also affected subsequent sensory-evoked responses. When a whisker was subjected to a series of 20 ms deflections at 10 Hz in an anesthetized mouse, the response to the second stimulus was undetectable, whereas the mean responses to the third and fourth stimuli were ~75% of the response to the first stimulus ( Figure S5 ). Although this observation might be explained by effects upstream of L1, it is also consistent with rapid sensory-evoked inhibition onto L1.
We developed an all-optical technique to resolve the distinct contributions of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to sensory-evoked responses. Rapid inhibition is mediated by GABA A receptors, ligand-gated chloride channels with a reversal potential of ~−70 mV. L1 interneurons in anesthetized rats have been reported to rest at −65 to −70 mV ( Zhu and Zhu, 2004 67. Zhu, Y. ∙ Zhu, J.J. Rapid arrival and integration of ascending sensory information in layer 1 nonpyramidal neurons and tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the neocortex J. Neurosci. 2004; 24 :1272-1279 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that inhibitory inputs should have only small effects on membrane potential at rest. Borrowing from well-established patch clamp protocols ( Segal and Barker, 1984 60. Segal, M. ∙ Barker, J.L. Rat hippocampal neurons in culture: voltage-clamp analysis of inhibitory synaptic connections J. Neurophysiol. 1984; 52 :469-487 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that optogenetic depolarization would increase the driving force for inward chloride current, and thereby amplify the impact of GABA A receptor activation on the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) ( Figures 3 A and 3B).
In both awake and anesthetized mice, whisker stimuli in the absence of optogenetic stimulation evoked clear spikes or EPSPs in L1 interneurons, as in prior experiments ( Figures 3 C and S5 ). Optogenetic stimuli targeted to single cells (500 ms duration, 1.8 to 21 mW/mm 2 , repeated at 1 Hz) reliably evoked stimulus intensity-dependent spiking. Remarkably, whisker stimuli applied during single-cell optogenetic stimulation hyperpolarized membrane potential and suppressed spiking ( Figures 3 C–3E and S5 ). We quantified the sensory-evoked subthreshold waveforms by digitally removing spikes ( STAR Methods ) and calculating a stimulus-triggered average at different optogenetic stimulus strengths ( Figures 3 E and S5 ). In both awake and anesthetized brain states, whisker stimuli had opposite effects in the absence versus presence of baseline optogenetic depolarization, illustrating dramatic non-additivity of sensory and optogenetic inputs to the same neuron. This observation mimicked the prior observation that sensory stimuli evoked single spikes in quiescent neurons but suppressed ongoing bursts in active neurons ( Figure 2 H).
We developed a simple biophysical model to test our interpretation that single cell-targeted optogenetic stimulation amplified the effect of network inhibition. We assumed a transient excitatory synaptic input followed shortly by a transient inhibitory input. With only passive conductances (leak, channelrhodopsin, AMPA receptor, and GABA A receptor), the model captured the main features of the subthreshold dynamics ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S5 ; STAR Methods ), including several subtleties. In the anesthetized state, as the strength of the optogenetic drive increased, the sensory-evoked IPSP amplitude first increased—as explained above—but then decreased (IPSP amplitude 29% ± 5% of spike height at I blue = 5.8 mW/mm 2 , versus 16% ± 4% of spike height at I blue = 21 mW/mm 2 , mean ± SEM, n = 15 neurons, 3 mice, p = 0.001, two-sided paired-sample t test) ( Figure S5 ). The model revealed that this decrease was due to shunting of the membrane potential toward the CheRiff reversal potential (~0 mV) at high CheRiff conductance ( STAR Methods ). This simple model thus connected the complex context-dependent whisker-evoked responses in L1 interneurons to basic membrane biophysics.
To constrain the possible sources of network inhibition, we next studied the relative timing of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We delivered whisker stimuli alternately with and without baseline weak optogenetic stimulation targeted to single neurons (5.8 mW/mm 2 ) ( Figure 3 H). In trials that evoked spikes, stimulus-triggered average waveforms ± blue light overlapped for the first 2 ms after onset of whisker-evoked depolarization. Thereafter, the waveform in the presence of optogenetic stimulation fell below the waveform in the absence, signaling the onset of inhibition ( Figure 3 I, inset). This finding implied a ~2 ms delay between onset of excitation and inhibition, suggesting at most a difference of one synapse in the respective paths ( Gabernet et al., 2005 20. Gabernet, L. ∙ Jadhav, S.P. ∙ Feldman, D.E. ... Somatosensory integration controlled by dynamic thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition Neuron. 2005; 48 :315-327 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ). Slower inhibitory signals (e.g., from GABA B receptors or polysynaptic mechanisms) could also have contributed to inhibition at later times.
We sought to identify the source of the sensory-evoked inhibition. Patch clamp measurements in acute slices identified inhibitory connections between L1 interneurons ( Chu et al., 2003; Cruikshank et al., 2012; Schuman et al., 2019 10. Chu, Z. ∙ Galarreta, M. ∙ Hestrin, S. Synaptic interactions of late-spiking neocortical neurons in layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :96-102 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 12. Cruikshank, S.J. ∙ Ahmed, O.J. ∙ Stevens, T.R. ... Thalamic control of layer 1 circuits in prefrontal cortex J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :17813-17823 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Schuman, B. ∙ Machold, R.P. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ... Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that whisker stimulation evoked near-synchronous spiking in L1, which then led to network inhibition via lateral connections within the L1 population. To test whether L1 activation was sufficient to evoke lateral network inhibition we performed an all-optical measurement of functional connectivity in vivo ( Figure 4 A).
We expressed Optopatch4 in 5-HT 3A R-Cre mice and targeted voltage imaging to 1–3 L1 interneurons in the center of the field of view. We then defined two optogenetic stimulus patterns. The first pattern comprised small disks targeted individually to the central neurons, with sustained optogenetic depolarization (500 ms, 25 mW/mm 2 ) to increase the driving force for inhibitory currents. The second pattern comprised an annulus (inner diameter ~200 μm, outer diameter of ~400 μm) ( Figures 4 B and 4C; STAR Methods ), surrounding the central neurons. Midway through the stimulation of the central neurons, a brief flash (20 ms, 25 mW/mm 2 ) was applied to the annulus to evoke synchronized spiking of the surrounding cells.
Optogenetic stimulation of the central neurons evoked robust spiking (41 ± 6 Hz, n = 25 neurons, 3 mice, mean ± SEM). Stimulation of the surrounding neurons transiently suppressed this spiking (spike rate 12 ± 4 Hz in the 25 ms following the annular flash, p = 4 × 10 −4 , two-sided paired-sample t test) ( Figures 4 D–4F). The mean fluorescence waveform following the annular flash showed robust hyperpolarization of the central neurons (−27% ± 3% of spike height) ( Figure 4 G). Control experiments without the central optogenetic stimulus revealed that the initial depolarization after the annular flash was an artifact from light scatter ( Figure S2 ). The spike patterns and subthreshold hyperpolarization dynamics in these experiments closely resembled the corresponding data for a sensory stimulus ( Figures 3 E, 3F, and 3I). We observed similar results in neuron-derived neurotrophic factor (Ndnf)-Cre mice ( Poorthuis et al., 2018; Tasic et al., 2016 54. Poorthuis, R.B. ∙ Muhammad, K. ∙ Wang, M. ... Rapid Neuromodulation of Layer 1 Interneurons in Human Neocortex Cell Rep. 2018; 23 :951-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Tasic, B. ∙ Menon, V. ∙ Nguyen, T.N. ... Adult mouse cortical cell taxonomy revealed by single cell transcriptomics Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19 :335-346 Crossref Scopus (1056) PubMed Google Scholar ) that drove Optopatch4 expression selectively in neurogliaform and canopy cells whose axons project laterally within L1 ( Schuman et al., 2019 59. Schuman, B. ∙ Machold, R.P. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ... Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 ). Together, these results established that synchronous activation of laterally projecting L1 neurons was sufficient to elicit rapid lateral inhibition within the L1 microcircuit.
The existence of a lateral inhibitory connection within L1 did not prove that this connection was responsible for the observed sensory-evoked inhibition. To address this question, we tested how optogenetic inhibition of neurons in an annular region modulated sensory-evoked responses in a centrally located neuron ( Figures 5 A and 5B).
We expressed Cre-on-SomArchon-EGFP and Cre-on-flp-off-stGtACR2-CFP in 5-HT 3A R-Cre mice ( Figure 5 C; STAR Methods ). To prevent scattered blue light from inducing spurious hyperpolarization of the measured cells, we used low-titer Flpo virus to turn off expression of stGtACR2 in a sparse subset of L1 neurons. We used 2-photon imaging of the appended fluorescent tags (GFP and CFP) to identify neurons that expressed SomArchon and not stGtACR2 ( Figure 5 D). These cells were targeted for voltage imaging in awake mice. We then illuminated a surrounding annulus with blue light (inner diameter ~200 μm, outer diameter ~400 μm) to inhibit the surrounding cells while delivering whisker stimuli.
Whisker stimuli in the absence of surround optogenetic inhibition evoked excitation followed by inhibition (−12% ± 4% of spike height, mean ± SEM, n = 13 neurons, 2 mice) ( Figures 5 E and 5F), recapitulating earlier experiments performed with a different reporter construct ( Figure 2 G). The same cells were then recorded during whisker stimulation with surround optogenetic inhibition (500 ms, 5.8 mW/mm 2 ) ( Figures 5 E and 5F, right). The post-stimulus hyperpolarization was replaced by a post-stimulus depolarization (+16% ± 5% of spike height) ( Figure 5 F). Some cells that showed IPSP or prompt single spikes in response to whisker stimulation alone showed delayed and sustained spiking when lateral inhibition was suppressed ( Figure 5 E). Together, these results established that sensory stimulation evoked lateral inhibition between L1 interneurons and that this lateral inhibition contributed to precise timing of whisker stimulus-evoked spikes.
Cholinergic modulation of L1 interneurons can enhance cortical L2/3 responses to sensory inputs ( Letzkus et al., 2011 36. Letzkus, J.J. ∙ Wolff, S.B.E. ∙ Meyer, E.M.M. ... A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex Nature. 2011; 480 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a first step toward understanding the integration of modulatory and sensory inputs in L1, we studied the response of barrel cortex L1 neurons to a stimulus designed to activate cholinergic inputs ( Figures 6 A and 6B). An air puff to the face excites cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain ( Hangya et al., 2015 23. Hangya, B. ∙ Ranade, S.P. ∙ Lorenc, M. ... Central Cholinergic Neurons Are Rapidly Recruited by Reinforcement Feedback Cell. 2015; 162 :1155-1168 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these neurons are known to innervate cortical L1 ( Eggermann et al., 2014; Letzkus et al., 2011; Mechawar et al., 2000 16. Eggermann, E. ∙ Kremer, Y. ∙ Crochet, S. ...

Neurol. 2000; 428 :305-318 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We imaged L1 neurons in awake mice while delivering a mild air puff (100 ms duration, ~5 psi) to the ipsilateral eye (to avoid incidental whisker stimulation, Figure 6 B). The air puff induced a significant increase in mean spike rate (from 2 ± 1 Hz to 8 ± 4 Hz, 50 to 200 ms after stimulus onset, p = 0.048, n = 15 neurons, 3 mice, paired two-sample t test) and evoked a mean depolarization that grew over ~100 ms and lasted for ~1,600 ms ( Figure 6 C).
The α4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is highly expressed in L1 interneurons ( Arroyo et al., 2012; Takesian et al., 2018 5. Arroyo, S. ∙ Bennett, C. ∙ Aziz, D. ... Prolonged disynaptic inhibition in the cortex mediated by slow, non-α7 nicotinic excitation of a specific subset of cortical interneurons J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :3859-3864 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar 61. Takesian, A.E. ∙ Bogart, L.J. ∙ Lichtman, J.W. ... Inhibitory circuit gating of auditory critical-period plasticity Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21 :218-227 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), so we hypothesized that this receptor mediated the neuromodulatory response. We made paired recordings of the same L1 interneurons before and after systemic administration of the α4 nAChR blocker dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHβE, 1.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.]) ( Figure 6 C). The AD 50 for this drug in mice has been reported to range from 0.45–1.7 mg/kg ( Damaj et al., 1995 13. Damaj, M.I. ∙ Welch, S.P. ∙ Martin, B.R. In vivo pharmacological effects of dihydro-β-erythroidine, a nicotinic antagonist, in mice Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1995; 117 :67-73 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), implying partial block at the dose used (higher doses are toxic) ( Damaj et al., 1995 13. Damaj, M.I. ∙ Welch, S.P. ∙ Martin, B.R. In vivo pharmacological effects of dihydro-β-erythroidine, a nicotinic antagonist, in mice Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 1995; 117 :67-73 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). DHβE did not significantly affect the spontaneous spike rate (before drug: 2 ± 1 Hz, after drug 3 ± 3 Hz, p = 0.53, two-sided paired-sample t test, n = 15 neurons, 3 mice) ( Figure 6 D), but the drug abolished the air puff-induced increase in spike rate (3 ± 3 Hz before air puff to 3 ± 2 Hz after air-puff, p = 0.79) ( Figure 6 D) and significantly decreased the air puff-induced subthreshold depolarization from 22% ± 4% of spike height to 10% ± 3% (p = 0.02, two-sided paired-sample t test) ( Figures 6 E and 6F). Thus, α4-mediated cholinergic excitation was largely responsible for the air puff-induced responses, although we cannot rule out other contributions to these responses.
The single-cell traces showed striking variability, so we explored in detail the responses of individual cells. In 15 of 21 L1 interneurons, the air puff evoked a clear depolarization. In 6 of these neurons, the air puff evoked one or more spikes and in 3 of these neurons, the air puff evoked a barrage of firing that lasted ~1 s, strikingly different from the precisely timed single spikes evoked by whisker stimulation ( Figure 6 G). In pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons, we often observed distinct air puff-induced responses in the two cells, indicating that the variability in response was intrinsic to the L1 circuit and was not due to trial-to-trial variation ( Figure S7 ).
To explore how cholinergic activation affected synaptic inputs, we paired the air puff with single cell-targeted optogenetic depolarization. When the air puff was applied in the middle of an optogenetic stimulus (500 ms, 5.8 mW/mm 2 ), there was no significant change in mean spike rate ( Figure 6 H), although some individual neurons showed dramatic increases or decreases in spike rate (see e.g., Figure 6 G, second and fourth traces). During baseline optogenetic stimulation, the air puff on average depolarized the membrane potential ( Figure 6 I), opposite to the hyperpolarizing transient evoked by a whisker stimulus under comparable conditions ( Figure 3 C). However, individual neurons sometimes showed strong air puff-induced hyperpolarization ( Figure S7 ). There are many possible mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous air puff responses. Below, we suggest a simple mechanism by which this heterogeneity could arise in a mutually inhibitory network.
Due to the strong mutual inhibition between L1 neurons, one cannot intuitively predict the network responses to excitatory inputs. We developed a simple numerical model of the L1 microcircuit that explained much of our data and predicted network responses to some new inputs ( Figure 7 A; Methods S2 ). The model contained elongated neurogliaform cells (eNGCs) with mutually inhibitory connections, and downward-projecting single-bouquet cells (SBCs) that received inhibitory inputs from eNGC neurons but did not feed back into the simulated network. Both cell types received thalamic and neuromodulatory inputs ( Cruikshank et al., 2012 12. Cruikshank, S.J. ∙ Ahmed, O.J. ∙ Stevens, T.R. ... Thalamic control of layer 1 circuits in prefrontal cortex J. Neurosci. 2012; 32 :17813-17823 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Conductance-based point-neuron simulations approximately recapitulated the firing properties of the two major cell classes in L1 ( Figure 7 B; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ) ( Wang and Buzsáki, 1996 64. Wang, X.J. ∙ Buzsáki, G. Gamma oscillation by synaptic inhibition in a hippocampal interneuronal network model J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :6402-6413 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We used published anatomical and patch clamp data to set the soma positions, synaptic weights, and thalamocortical input strength ( Chu et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2015; Schuman et al., 2019 10. Chu, Z. ∙ Galarreta, M. ∙ Hestrin, S. Synaptic interactions of late-spiking neocortical neurons in layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :96-102 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 28. Jiang, X. ∙ Shen, S. ∙ Cadwell, C.R. ... Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex Science. 2015; 350 :aac9462 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Schuman, B. ∙ Machold, R.P. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ... Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S2 ; Methods S2 ). Our simulations comprised 51 neurons (34 eNGCs, 17 SBCs), approximately matching the number of interneurons above a single whisker barrel ( Meyer et al., 2013 45. Meyer, H.S. ∙ Egger, R. ∙ Guest, J.M. ... Cellular organization of cortical barrel columns is whisker-specific Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :19113-19118 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We simulated the L1 network with thalamic excitation and patterned optogenetic stimulation. Simulated thalamic inputs alone evoked precisely timed single spikes followed by a period of hyperpolarization and suppressed spontaneous activity ( Figure S7 ), recapitulating the results of Figure 2 . Simulations containing single-cell targeted optogenetic stimulation amplified the effect of network inhibition in the targeted cell, closely matching the experimental results in Figure 3 ( Figure 7 C). We also reproduced the center/surround excitation experiments from Figure 4 ( Figure S7 ).
Simulations predicted that localized excitation would evoke sustained spiking, while wide-area excitation would lead to strong firing rate adaptation due to lateral inhibition ( Figures 7 D–7F). Experiments in anesthetized mice confirmed that optogenetic stimulation of individual cells led to sustained spiking ( Figures 7 G–7I). Optogenetic stimulation of a 400 μm wide spot elicited a prompt spike in nearly all neurons (17 of 20 cells), followed by a complete suppression of spiking in nearly all neurons (18 of 20 cells) during the subsequent 20 ms ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Most neurons remained silent during the subsequent ~100 ms, although a few (4 of 20 cells) resumed tonic spiking ( Figure 7 G). The sub-threshold potentials also showed a clear difference between localized and distributed optogenetic excitation ( Figure 7 I). Localized excitation led to a sustained depolarization, whereas distributed excitation led to a peak in potential followed by an ~100 ms inhibition ( Figure 7 I).
These results demonstrate the input-output transformations of L1. The circuit acts as a temporal high-pass filter for spatially distributed inputs. This filtering manifests in the precisely timed single spikes from whisker stimulation. The circuit also acts as a spatial high-pass filter for temporally sustained inputs (i.e., spatially localized inputs can evoke sustained local firing, but spatially distributed inputs cannot).
We modeled cholinergic input as activation of an excitatory conductance in all L1 interneurons, with rise time of 300 ms and duration ~1 s. To our surprise, sustained spatially distributed excitation of all cells led to winner-takes-all spiking patterns above a critical excitation strength. Some cells spiked a little faster than their neighbors, suppressing spiking of the neighbors and amplifying the disparity in spike rates. For cholinergic inputs above the critical strength, the simulated single-cell firing traces ( Figure 7 J) fell into two classes (sustained spiking versus transient depolarization or single spikes), closely resembling the bimodal single-cell cholinergic responses we observed in response to an air puff ( Figure 7 K). A similar bimodal distribution of cholinergic responses had previously been noted in L1 interneurons in auditory cortex in response to a tail shock ( Letzkus et al., 2011 36. Letzkus, J.J. ∙ Wolff, S.B.E. ∙ Meyer, E.M.M. ... A disinhibitory microcircuit for associative fear learning in the auditory cortex Nature. 2011; 480 :331-335 Crossref Scopus (619) PubMed Google Scholar ) but had not been explained. We emphasize that the bimodal responses in the model are an emergent property of a homogeneous mutually inhibitory network; not the result of hard-wired single-cell properties or network connections. These simulation results suggest that strong cholinergic input to L1 can temporarily lock the circuit into a winner-takes-all firing pattern.

Section: Discussion

By combining soma-localized voltage indicators with holographic structured illumination microscopy, we achieved high-sensitivity genetically targeted recordings of membrane voltage in cortical L1 and superficial L2/3 in awake mice. We introduced optogenetic techniques for resolving excitatory from inhibitory contributions to subthreshold voltage and for mapping functional connectivity in vivo . We developed tools for simultaneous optogenetic inhibition and voltage imaging (i-Optopatch) to reveal the roles of specific neural populations in network function.
We applied these tools to study the input-output properties of L1. Whisker deflections evoked precisely timed single spikes in L1 interneurons, followed by periods of hyperpolarization, reduced spontaneous activity and reduced response to sensory inputs. Optogenetic depolarization of individual cells revealed that whisker stimuli evoked excitation, followed by strong network inhibition. Optogenetic stimulation of neighboring L1 neurons evoked similar patterns of network inhibition. Optogenetic silencing of neighboring L1 neurons abolished sensory-evoked network inhibition. Together these experiments showed that lateral inhibition within L1 plays a critical role in determining the network response to sensory inputs. Our results in L1 are reminiscent of similar results showing sensory-evoked concurrent excitation and inhibition in pyramidal cells in L4 ( Gabernet et al., 2005; Wehr and Zador, 2003 20. Gabernet, L. ∙ Jadhav, S.P. ∙ Feldman, D.E. ...

Wehr, M. ∙ Zador, A.M. Balanced inhibition underlies tuning and sharpens spike timing in auditory cortex Nature. 2003; 426 :442-446 Crossref Scopus (1050) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in L2/3 ( Petersen et al., 2003; Sachdev et al., 2004 51. Petersen, C.C.H. ∙ Hahn, T.T.G. ∙ Mehta, M. ... Interaction of sensory responses with spontaneous depolarization in layer 2/3 barrel cortex Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Effect of subthreshold up and down states on the whisker-evoked response in somatosensory cortex J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92 :3511-3521 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our results further showed that neuromodulatory excitation drove tonic spiking in a subset of cells, and drove single spikes or purely subthreshold depolarizations in other cells. Although the origin of this heterogeneity is not known, simulations suggested that this heterogeneity could arise in a homogeneous mutually inhibitory network via winner-takes-all dynamics. However, alternate explanations are not ruled out. The heterogeneous cholinergic responses may reflect variations in acetylcholine receptor expression between L1 neuronal subtypes ( Schuman et al., 2019 59. Schuman, B. ∙ Machold, R.P. ∙ Hashikawa, Y. ... Four Unique Interneuron Populations Reside in Neocortical Layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2019; 39 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), or specific features of the wiring. A definitive test will require population-level voltage imaging in defined subtypes of L1 interneurons, combined with precisely controlled cholinergic activation. This type of experiment is likely to be technically feasible in the near future.
The convergence of sensory and cholinergic inputs onto L1 interneurons raises the question of how these modalities interact. Our model predicts that weak neuromodulatory excitation sensitizes the network to thalamic inputs by bringing all cells are closer to threshold; but strong neuromodulatory excitation transiently locks the network into a symmetry-broken winner-takes-all state comprising strongly excited and strongly inhibited neurons. In this state, responses to thalamic inputs are suppressed. Thus, the sensitivity of the L1 network to sensory inputs is predicted to show an inverted-U dependence on cholinergic drive.
Considering the importance of L1 in modulating sensory processing, we speculate that the L1 microcircuit could contribute to the inverted-U dependence of performance on arousal observed in many sensory processing tasks ( McGinley et al., 2015 43. McGinley, M.J. ∙ David, S.V. ∙ McCormick, D.A. Cortical Membrane Potential Signature of Optimal States for Sensory Signal Detection Neuron. 2015; 87 :179-192 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ), often called the Yerkes-Dodson law ( Yerkes and Dodson, 1908 66. Yerkes, R.M. ∙ Dodson, J.D. The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation J. Comp. Neurol. Psychol. 1908; 18 :459-482 Crossref Google Scholar ). We further speculate that rapid firing in a subset of L1 interneurons under strong cholinergic drive could be important for L1-mediated plasticity ( Abs et al., 2018; Doron et al., 2019 2. Abs, E. ∙ Poorthuis, R.B. ∙ Apelblat, D. ... Learning-Related Plasticity in Dendrite-Targeting Layer 1 Interneurons Neuron. 2018; 100 :684-699 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar 14. Doron, G. ∙ Shin, J.N. ∙ Takahashi, N. ... Perirhinal input to neocortical layer 1 controls learning bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ). A clear goal for future work will be to test these predictions by studying the interaction of sensory and modulatory inputs in each subclass of L1 interneurons.
Future applications of the tools described here will benefit from voltage imaging deeper in the brain. Due to light scattering, the present 1-photon imaging approach faces a tradeoff between the density of signal sources and the imaging depth, with a maximum cortical depth for sparse cells of ~230 μm. Several approaches to circumventing this tradeoff are conceivable, such as adaptive optics ( Ji, 2017 26. Ji, N. Adaptive optical fluorescence microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :374-380 Crossref Scopus (383) PubMed Google Scholar ), graded-index (GRIN) lens endoscopes ( Jung et al., 2004 29. Jung, J.C. ∙ Mehta, A.D. ∙ Aksay, E. ... In vivo mammalian brain imaging using one- and two-photon fluorescence microendoscopy J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92 :3121-3133 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ), or prism-based imaging approaches ( Andermann et al., 2013 4. Andermann, M.L. ∙ Gilfoy, N.B. ∙ Goldey, G.J. ... Chronic cellular imaging of entire cortical columns in awake mice using microprisms Neuron. 2013; 80 :900-913 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Efforts are also underway to develop two-photon voltage imaging in vivo ( Villette et al., 2019 63. Villette, V. ∙ Chavarha, M. ∙ Dimov, I.K. ... Ultrafast Two-Photon Imaging of a High-Gain Voltage Indicator in Awake Behaving Mice Cell. 2019; 179 :1590-1608 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ), although improvements in molecular indicators and optics are likely necessary. Two-photon targeted optogenetic stimulation has recently been paired with calcium imaging in vivo ( Emiliani et al., 2015; Forli et al., 2018; Mardinly et al., 2018; Marshel et al., 2019; Packer et al., 2015; Rickgauer et al., 2014 17.

Simultaneous cellular-resolution optical perturbation and imaging of place cell firing fields Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17 :1816-1824 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combination of two-photon stimulation with voltage imaging may enable fine-grained circuit dissection in vivo .
The all-optical tools introduced here could be used to dissect circuit mechanisms in many contexts. For instance, interactions between excitation and inhibition are critical in network models of reinforcement learning ( Schultz et al., 1997 58. Schultz, W. ∙ Dayan, P. ∙ Montague, P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward Science. 1997; 275 :1593-1599 Crossref Scopus (6380) PubMed Google Scholar ) and predictive coding ( Rao and Ballard, 1999 55. Rao, R.P.N. ∙ Ballard, D.H. Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2 :79-87 Crossref Scopus (3252) PubMed Google Scholar ) but many aspects of these models have not been tested. The ability to silence or activate defined sub-populations while imaging voltage can reveal otherwise hidden inhibition, and elucidate the necessity and sufficiency of specific connections for network function.

The optical system combined a red laser (λ = 639 nm) path for holographic targeted illumination voltage imaging, a blue laser (λ = 488 nm) path for micromirror-patterned optogenetic stimulation, a two-photon (2P) path for structural imaging, and a wide-field epifluorescence imaging path.
A red laser (CNI Inc., MRL-FN-639, λ = 639 nm, 700 mW single transverse mode) was coupled into the setup via a photonic crystal polarization maintaining fiber (NKT Photonics, LMA-PM-15). The fiber output was collimated with an f = 100 mm focal length lens (Thorlabs, AC254-100-A-ML) to form a beam with approximately ~10 mm diameter. The polarization of the beam was set with a zero-order half-wave plate. The beam was directed onto a holographic reflection-mode liquid crystal spatial light modulator (SLM, Meadowlark 1920SLM VIS) with a resolution of 1920 × 1152 pixels. Zero-order diffraction was blocked by a home-made anti-pinhole comprised of a dot of solder on a glass slide, placed in a plane conjugate to the sample image plane. The SLM was re-imaged onto the back-focal plane of the objective via a series of relay optics. The objective lens was a 25 × water immersion objective, numerical aperture 1.05 (Olympus XLPLN25XWMP2). A mechanical shutter blocked the red laser between data acquisitions. A series of OD filters were placed after the red laser for modulating intensity.
In the first generation of the setup, we used a variable focal length camera lens (Sigma macro 18-200 mm) to control the magnification of the SLM at the back focal plane of the objective. Demagnifying the SLM decreased the effective numerical aperture of the illumination at the sample, leading to bigger spots in the sample, but also to a larger region that could be targeted with red light. In the second-generation system, we used a fixed lens after the SLM to minimize aberrations. All relay lenses are specified in Table S1 .
The SLM device was controlled by custom software. A user specified a set of lines for the SLM to target by drawing on a wide-field epifluorescence image or a 2P fluorescence image. These lines were discretized into a set of spots. The SLM phased pattern was calculated using the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. Red laser intensity was ~3 mW per cell for in vivo imaging, ~1 mW per cell for acute slice imaging.
A blue laser (Cobolt, 06-01 series, λ = 488 nm, 60 mW) was modulated in intensity via an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF; Gooch and Housego TF525-250-6-3-GH18A). The beam was focused into a single-mode optical fiber. The output was collimated with an f = 60 mm focal length lens (Thorlabs, AC254-060-A-ML) to form a beam with approximately a ~17 mm diameter. The beam was then sent to a digital micromirror device with a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels (DMD, Vialux, V-7001 VIS). The patterned blue beam was combined with the patterned red beam via a dichroic mirror. The DMD was re-imaged onto the sample at a magnification such that one DMD pixel corresponded to 0.62 μm in the sample plane. The DMD optical system enabled patterned blue light stimulation across a field of view of ~450 x ~520 μm.
The DMD was controlled by custom software. For excitability measurement, a pixel bitmap was preloaded onto and projected from the DMD. For lateral inhibition experiments, pixel bitmaps were loaded into the on-board RAM and digital clock pulses triggered the DMD to sequence through the pre-defined set of exposure patterns.
The image was relayed from the objective to the camera via a series of three lenses. The final image formation step was performed by a 4x objective (Olympus XLFLUOR 4X/340) serving the role of the tube lens. Fluorescence was collected on a scientific CMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0). The final magnification of the optical system was 16.7, corresponding to 0.39 μm in the sample plane per camera pixel.
Fluorescence from the sample was separated from the blue and red excitation beams via a dichroic mirror (Di03-R405/488/561/635-t3-40x55). An emission filter (Semrock 635 nm long-pass, BLP01-635R-25) further separated SomArchon fluorescence from scattered excitation light. An IR-blocking emission filter (Semrock, FF01-842/SP-25) was placed for blocking scattered infrared excitation light.
All movies are acquired at 1 kHz. To image at 1 kHz, the camera region of interest (ROI) was restricted to typically 200 rows, centered on the image-sensor midline.
The imaging system was designed for a magnification lower than the nominal 25x of the objective for two reasons. First, lower magnification increased the number of neurons that could be imaged simultaneously onto the limited detector area accessible at 1 kHz. Second, by concentrating sample photons onto as few camera pixels as possible, we sought to minimize the contribution from camera electronic noise, so that all signals would be in the shot noise-limited regime.
Light from a femtosecond tunable pulsed infrared laser (Spectra Physics DeepSee) was sent to a pair of galvo mirrors (Cambridge Technologies 6215H). The galvos were re-imaged onto the back focal plane of the objective via an optimized scan lens (Thorlabs, SL50-CLS2) and tube lens (Thorlabs, TL200-CLS2). The visible (blue and red) and near-infrared beams were combined using a 785 nm long-pass dichroic mirror (Semrock, Di03-R785-t3-40x55). GFP fluorescence was directed to the 2P detection path via a removable 550 nm long-pass dichroic. Scattered excitation light was blocked by a 550 nm long-pass emission filter, an IR-blocking emission filter (BSP01-785R-25) and a band-pass emission filter (FF03-525/50-25). A pair of lenses (focal lengths 75 mm and 16 mm) re-imaged the back-aperture of the objective onto a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, H11706P-40). The output of the photomultiplier was amplified and low pass filtered through an amplifier unit (Hamamatsu C7319) and then digitized.
For i-Optopatch experiments, GFP fluorescence was excited by 950 nm and selected by a band-pass emission filter (Chroma, ET525/36 m). CFP fluorescence was excited by 900 nm and selected by a band-pass emission filter (FF01-475/28-25).
The entire setup was controlled by custom software written in LabView. Interfacing was via a National Instruments DAQ (NI PCIe-6363).
The software contained routines for registration of the DMD, SLM, 2P microscope coordinates to the camera via affine transformations. The camera served as the global reference coordinate system.
Experimental protocols were specified by a set of images (to the SLM and the DMD), output waveforms (to the galvos, the AOTF, the shutters, the update clock on the DMD, the piezo whisker stimulator, and the air puff controller), and analog input streams (from the PMT, the camera exposure clock, and a patch clamp electrophysiology setup not used in the present work).
The Hamamatsu camera uses an internal 100 kHz clock to synchronize image row readout. We found that when the camera exposure times were triggered by the DAQ in synchronous mode, the camera rounded the exposure time to the nearest 10 μs, leading to 1% jitter in exposure time for 1 kHz imaging. To address this noise source, we used a custom firmware upgrade to access the 100 kHz camera clock. This clock became the master clock for the DAQ system, and all analog and digital input/output functions were synchronized to the camera clock.
All procedures involving animals were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Harvard University.
Virus comprising AAV2/9 hSyn-Dio-SomArchon-eGFP-P2A-somCheRiff (1.74 × 10 13 GC/mL) was diluted in PBS and injected at a final titer of ~2 × 10 12 GC/mL.
5HT 3A R-Cre +/− mice were crossed with wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Pups were cryo-anesthetized at P0-P2 and immobilized dorsal side up under a stereotaxic microscope. Injections were made using home-pulled micropipettes (Sutter P1000 pipette puller), mounted in a microinjection pump (World Precision Instruments Nanoliter 2010) controlled by a microsyringe pump controller (World Precision Instruments Micro4). The micropipette was positioned using a stereotaxic instrument (Stoelting Digital Mouse Stereotaxic Instrument). Pups were injected in the left hemisphere, 1 mm lateral and 1.2 mm anterior to lambda. Starting at a depth of 0.3 mm beneath the surface of the skull, virus injections (40 nL, 1 nL/s) were performed at 0.1 mm increments as the pipette was withdrawn. Pups were placed back in their home cage once they were awake.
Genotyping for 5HT 3A R-Cre, SST-Cre and NDNF-Cre was performed with the PCR primer pairs: Cre 5′: 5′ TAT CTC ACG TAC TGA CGG TG 3′ and Cre 3′: 5′ AGA CTA ATC GCC ATC TTC CAG C 3′ to yield a 500 bp band from Cre.
Acute brain slices were prepared from P16–P28 5HT 3A R-Cre +/− mice. The mice were anesthetized by isoflurane and then perfused with carbogen (95% O 2 , 5% CO 2 )-saturated ice-cold slicing solution with the following composition (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 glucose, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 7 MgCl 2 , 11.6 Na-ascorbate, and 3.1 Na-pyruvate. Mice were then decapitated and the brains were rapidly coronally sliced with 300 μm thickness on a vibratome (Leica VT 1200S).
Slices were incubated for 45 min at 34°C in a carbogenated artificial CSF (ACSF) with the following composition (in mM): 127 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 , 25 glucose, 2 CaCl 2 , and 1 MgCl 2 . The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 300–310 mOsm and the pH was maintained at 7.3 under constant bubbling with carbogen.
Measurements were conducted in ACSF at 23°C under ambient atmosphere. The slice was immobilized in a slice recording chamber using a slice anchor (Warner Instruments, SHD-40/2). ACSF, perfused with carbogen, was flowed through the chamber at a rate of 2 mL/minute.
For Optopatch experiments, virus comprising AAV2/9 hSyn-Dio-SomArchon-eGFP-P2A-somCheRiff (1.74 × 10 13 GC/mL) was diluted in PBS and injected at a final titer of ~3 × 10 12 GC/mL.
For i-Optopatch experiments ( Figures 1 I–1K and 5 ), virus comprised AAV2/9 hSyn-Flp-off-Cre-on-stGtACR2-CFP (final concentration ~1 × 10 12 GC/mL) mixed with AAV2 CAG-FLEX-SomArchon-eGFP (final concentration ~6.3 × 10 11 GC/mL) and AAV5 EF1a-Flpo (final concentration ~2 × 10 11 GC/mL).
The procedure for surgery and imaging in barrel cortex L1 followed the protocol from Andermann ( Goldey et al., 2014 21. Goldey, G.J. ∙ Roumis, D.K. ∙ Glickfeld, L.L. ... Removable cranial windows for long-term imaging in awake mice Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2515-2538 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). 35-60-day-old heterozygous 5HT 3A R-Cre mice (male and female) were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and maintained with ~1% isoflurane throughout the surgery. Eyes were kept moist using ophthalmic eye ointment. Body temperature was continuously monitored and maintained at 37°C using a heating pad (WPI, ATC2000). The skull was exposed and thoroughly dried and a 3 mm round craniotomy (3.3 – 3.4 mm lateral, 1.6 mm caudal of bregma) was opened using a biopsy punch (Miltex). Virus was then injected in 4 - 8 locations in the center of the craniotomy. Starting at a depth of 0.2 mm beneath the surface of the dura, virus injections (60 nL, 30 - 60 nL/min) were performed at 0.1 mm increments as the pipette was withdrawn. Brain surface was kept moist with saline throughout the injection.
A window was prepared prior to the surgery and comprised two 3 mm round #1 cover glasses and one 5 mm round #1 cover glass (Harvard apparatus) cured together with UV curable adhesive (Norland Products, NOA 81). Following the virus injection, the window was then placed covering the barrel cortex and cemented to the skull with dental cement (C&B metabond, Parkell, No. 242-3200). After the window cured, a titanium headplate (similar to the design in Goldey et al. (2014) 21. Goldey, G.J. ∙ Roumis, D.K. ∙ Glickfeld, L.L. ... Removable cranial windows for long-term imaging in awake mice Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :2515-2538 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar was glued around the window and any exposed skull was covered with dental cement. Animals were returned to their home cage for recovery and treated for 3 days with Carprofen (5 mg/kg) and Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) twice a day. To avoid damage to the implant, mice were housed in separate cages.
The procedure for surgery and imaging in visual cortical L1-3 followed the same protocol as above, except that 35-60-day-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice or heterozygous SST-Cre mice (male and female) were used. The coordinates for the 3 mm round craniotomy were 2.4 mm lateral and 2.7 mm caudal of bregma. Virus was then injected in 4 - 8 locations in the center of the craniotomy. Starting at a depth of 0.3 mm beneath the surface of the dura, virus injections (60 nL, 30 - 60 nL/min) were performed at 0.2 mm increments as the pipette was withdrawn.
For wild-type mice, injected virus comprised AAV2 CAG-FLEX-SomArchon-eGFP (final titer ~0.5 × 10 12 GC/mL) mixed with CKII(0.4)-Cre virus (UPenn vector core, final titer ~1 × 10 11 GC/mL).
For SST-Cre mice, injected virus comprised AAV2 CAG-FLEX-SomArchon-eGFP (final titer ~0.5 × 10 12 GC/mL).
For general behavior monitoring during acquisitions we recorded video of the mouse’s face. An IR LED light (850 nm) was placed in front of the animal. A PointGrey camera (GS3-U3-51S5M-C, Mono Grasshopper3 USB 3.0 Camera) with a Fuji lens (Fuji Photo Optical 1:1.4/25 Fujinon-TV Camera Lens) and an IR-passing optical filter (Thorlabs, FB850-40) was placed on the side to track the animal’s face (whisker motion and eye blinks) during data acquisitions.
An individual whisker was selected for stimulation (typically B2, C2 or D2). Other whiskers were trimmed to prevent direct contact with the glass pipette. The whisker was inserted into a glass pipette glued to a piezoelectric actuator. The actuator was connected to an amplifier (Krohn-Hite 7602M) and controlled by the DAQ. A spike was classified as ‘evoked’ if it occurred within 30 ms of onset of whisker stimulus.
Intrinsic imaging was performed on the same setup as described above. A 4x objective (Olympus XLFLUOR 4X/340) was used to image the entire 3 mm cranial window. The whisker stimulation was 10 Hz for 4 s with a 16 s interstimulus interval. A red LED (625 nm) illuminated the window surface from the side. Reflected light was imaged onto the camera at 10 Hz frame rate. A decrease in reflectance from the brain indicated the barrel, which could be localized relative to the blood vessel pattern as visualized with 488 nm illumination.
Imaging started 3 weeks post-surgery. Mice were lightly anesthetized (0.7–1% isoflurane), head-fixed under the upright microscope using the titanium head plate and held in a body tube. Eyes were kept moist using ophthalmic eye ointment. Body temperature was continuously monitored and maintained at 37°C using a heating pad (WPI, ATC2000). A typical imaging session lasted 1–2 hours, and then animals quickly recovered and returned to their home cage. Recordings targeting L1 neurons in vivo were performed at a depth < 150 μm in both anesthetized and awake animals. Recordings typically targeted 1 – 4 neurons simultaneously.
Habituation started 2 weeks post-surgery. Each animal was acclimated to the head restraint in a body tube for at least 3 days before starting the imaging sessions. For imaging in awake animals, a 3D-printed paw blocker was placed in front of the forepaws to prevent them from pushing away the glass pipette for whisker stimulation.
The timing of the air puff was controlled by a solenoid valve (WPI). The strength of the air puff was set ~5 psi and controlled by a pressure regulator (Festo, pressure regulator LRP-1/4-4). The air puff was delivered through a blunt needle at ~5 mm from the eye ipsilateral to the brain hemisphere used for voltage imaging (to avoid spurious whisker stimulation arriving in the imaged barrels). Air pressure and needle position were adjusted to achieve an air puff strength just strong enough to evoke an eye blink response and increase the pupil diameter.
To modulate cholinergic signaling, dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHβE, Tocris; 2349) was diluted in saline. The drug was administered systemically (1.5 mg/kg i.p.). Optopatch and air puff measurements were performed before, and then 30 min. after drug administration, on the same sets of cells. The experiment was performed on each animal twice, on successive days.
For lateral inhibition experiments, we defined two optogenetic stimulus patterns. “Central masks” covered individually the cell bodies of 1 – 3 neurons at the center of the field of view. We calculated the geometrical centers of these masks individually. The mean of these centers was set as the coordinates for the center for the surrounding “annulus mask.”
The annulus inner radius was set to be ~100 μm from the most non-centered central mask. This distance was selected to minimize the impact of scattered light from the annulus mask. The outer radius of the annulus mask was set as the largest value at which the annulus would be contained within the FOV. Typical outer radii were ~200 μm.
The image sequence was composed of three composite masks: (1) central masks only; (2) central mask and annulus mask together; (3) annulus mask only. These masks were preloaded into the on-board RAM and digital clock pulses triggered the DMD to sequence through the pre-defined set of exposure patterns.
Data were analyzed with homemade code written in MATLAB.
Movies were first corrected for motion using the NoRMCorre algorithm ( Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017 53. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Giovannucci, A. NoRMCorre: An online algorithm for piecewise rigid motion correction of calcium imaging data J. Neurosci. Methods. 2017; 291 :83-94 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ). Movies were then corrected for photobleaching by dividing the movie by an exponential fit of the mean fluorescence.
We divided the movie into sub-movies comprising single cells and performed activity-based image segmentation separately in each sub-movie. Whereas correlations often arose between subthreshold voltages and out-of-focus background, we assumed that spiking was not correlated with background, and furthermore that the spatial footprint associated with spiking would be the same as for true subthreshold dynamics. For segmentation purposes, we first removed subthreshold signals via a 100 Hz high-pass filter. Movies were then segmented semi-automatically using one of two activity-based segmentation algorithms. In one approach, principal components analysis was followed by time-domain independent components analysis (PCA/ICA) ( Mukamel et al., 2009 46. Mukamel, E.A. ∙ Nimmerjahn, A. ∙ Schnitzer, M.J. Automated analysis of cellular signals from large-scale calcium imaging data Neuron. 2009; 63 :747-760 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). The spatial masks from PCA/ICA were then applied to the original movies without high-pass filtering to extract fluorescence traces.
In a second approach, high-pass filtered movies were segmented via penalized matrix decomposition non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (PMD-NMF) ( Buchanan et al., 2018 8. Buchanan, E.K. ∙ Kinsella, I. ∙ Zhou, D. ... Penalized matrix decomposition for denoising, compression, and improved demixing of functional imaging data bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Google Scholar ). The spatial masks were applied to the original movies without high-pass filtering to extract initial fluorescence traces. An estimate of the background signal was calculated from pixels not on the targeted cells. Signals from the cellular footprints were calculated with the constraint that the background spatial profile should be maximally smooth. Both approaches to image segmentation gave similar results, a consequence of the sparsity of L1 interneurons and the optical sectioning from tightly focused holographic excitation.
The algorithm has been extensively tested on simulated data comprising realistic shot-noise limited signals from individual cells, correlations in sub-threshold voltages between cells, and correlated out-of-focus background (See Extended Data Figure 6 of Adam et al. [2019 3. Adam, Y. ∙ Kim, J.J. ∙ Lou, S. ... Voltage imaging and optogenetics reveal behaviour-dependent changes in hippocampal dynamics Nature. 2019; 569 :413-417 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the algorithm with data from cortical L1 interneurons, we took independent single-cell recordings and extracted the fluorescence dynamics from each. We made composite movies by adding two movies together, with ~50% overlap between cell bodies. We extracted the signals from the composite movies, and compared to the ground truth data extracted from the individual movies. This test is more stringent than any real-world data because in-focus cells never physically overlapped in real data.
Flashes of blue light delivered in an annular pattern induced tissue autofluorescence which bled into the voltage recordings from centrally located neurons. To correct for this crosstalk, background fluorescence from a region surrounding the central imaged cells was subtracted from the fluorescence of the recorded cells.
A simple threshold-and-maximum procedure was applied for spike detection. Fluorescence traces were first high-pass filtered, and initial threshold was set at 4 times the noise level. This threshold was then manually adjusted.
All fluorescence signals were normalized to spike height for spike-triggered average or stimulation-triggered average.
For an SNR of 7 and a spike-detection threshold set at 4σ about the baseline noise, the false-positive rate is calculated as the probability that samples from a Gaussian distribution lie more than 4σ above the mean. This probability is (1-p 4 )/2 ∗ 1 kHz ∗ 10 s, where p 4 = 0.999937. The false-negative rate is calculated as the probability that spike height values fall more than 3σ below the mean. This probability is (1-p 3 )/2, where p 3 = 0.9973.
Spikes were digitally removed and replaced with linear interpolations of the surrounding data. Spike width was estimated from spike-triggered average waveforms. Linear interpolations were performed between data-points 1 ms beyond the edges of the spike.
All error ranges represent standard error of the mean, unless otherwise specified. For the same neurons before and after drug administration, in anesthetized and awake states, with and without surrounding inhibition, and under local and global optogenetic stimulation, paired sample t test was used. For two-sample comparisons of a single variable, Student’s t test was used. In cases where the underlying distributions were non-Gaussian, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Probabilities of the null hypothesis p < 0.05 were judged to be statistically significant.
The evolution of subthreshold membrane potential in the presence of synaptic inputs and optogenetic stimulation ( Figure 3 ) was simulated with a passive single compartment model using the following equation: 𝐶 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑔 𝑒 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑒 − 𝑉 ) + 𝑔 𝑖 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑖 − 𝑉 ) + 𝑔 𝑙 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑙 − 𝑉 ) + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 − 𝑉 ) , (1) where C m is the membrane capacitance, 𝑔 𝑒 , 𝑔 𝑖 , 𝑔 𝑙 and 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 are the conductance of excitatory, inhibitory, leak and channelrhodopsin channels, and E 𝑒 , E 𝑖 , E 𝑙 and E 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 are the respective reversal potentials. The time course of conductance upon excitatory or inhibitory synaptic input was simulated using an alpha function: 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = { 𝑔 s y n ⁡ 𝑡 − 𝑡 0 𝜏 ⁢ 𝑒 1 − 𝑡 − 𝑡 0 𝜏 + 𝑔 b a s e l i n e f o r 𝑡 ≥ 𝑡 0 𝑔 b a s e l i n e f o r 𝑡 < 𝑡 0 . (2) Here g syn is the strength of the synaptic input, t 0 is the time of the synaptic input, t is a time-constant of synaptic input, and g baseline reflects the tonic level of synaptic input excluding the event of interest.
In principle, the values of g baseline for the inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs could be wrapped into the definitions of g l and E l . Doing so would not affect the solutions to Equation 1 . We chose to keep the baseline synaptic conductances as separate parameters to facilitate explorations of the model under different brain states (e.g., anesthesia versus wakefulness). In this approach, g l and E l reflect cell-autonomous leak conductances (e.g., K ir channels), assumed to be independent of brain state, while g baseline captures the effect of network-dependent inputs.
To simulate lateral inhibition in L1, we assumed inhibition lagged excitation by 2 ms. Other parameters are listed below: Parameter Value 𝒈 𝒆 𝒔 𝒚 𝒏 1 . 5 n S 𝒈 𝒆 𝒃 𝒂 𝒔 𝒆 𝒍 𝒊 𝒏 𝒆 0 . 1 n S 𝒈 𝒊 𝒔 𝒚 𝒏 5 n S 𝒈 𝒊 𝒃 𝒂 𝒔 𝒆 𝒍 𝒊 𝒏 𝒆 0 . 1 n S 𝒈 𝒍 3 . 3 3 n S 𝒈 𝑪 𝒉 𝑹 0 − 1 0 n S 𝑬 𝒆 − 5 m V 𝑬 𝒊 − 7 0 m V 𝑬 𝒍 − 7 0 m V 𝑬 𝑪 𝒉 𝑹 0 m V 𝐂 𝐦 1 5 0 p F 𝛕 1 m s Open table in a new tab
Equation 1 was numerically integrated using Euler’s method.
The model above can be solved analytically for the steady-state voltage by setting 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 0 , which yields: 𝑉 = 𝐸 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑒 + 𝐸 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑖 + 𝐸 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝐸 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 𝑔 𝑒 + 𝑔 𝑖 + 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 . (3) The PSP amplitudes are obtained by calculating the difference in steady-state voltage, ΔV PSP , after versus before the sensory perturbations to g e and g i , assuming that all other parameters do not vary during the synaptic event. If one assumes that g e and g i are both zero before the synaptic event (i.e., by absorbing the pre-stimulus values of g e and g i into the definition of g l and E l ), then one finds: Δ ⁢ 𝑉 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑃 ≈ 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ [ 𝑔 𝑒 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑒 − 𝐸 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) + 𝑔 𝑖 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑖 − 𝐸 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) ] + 𝑔 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑒 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑒 − 𝐸 𝑙 ) + 𝑔 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑔 𝑖 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑖 − 𝐸 𝑙 ) ( 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) ⁢ ( 𝑔 𝑖 + 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) . (4) Since only differences in voltage appear in Equation 4 , one can arbitrarily choose to set one of the voltages to zero, and measure all other voltages relative to this reference. For convenience, we set E l to zero for the fitting. Equation 4 is linear in g ChR in the numerator, and quadratic in g ChR in the denominator, suggesting 5 fitting parameters to specify the function Δ ⁢ 𝑉 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁡ ( 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) . However, the proportionality between ΔV and ΔF is not a priori known. Also the proportionality between g ChR and I 488 is not a priori known.
To estimate the waveforms of the post-synaptic potentials, we first normalized all fluorescence traces by spike height. We then calculated the mean fluorescence over 10 ms before the whisker stimulus, and the mean fluorescence over 10 ms starting 30 ms after the whisker stimulus. The difference between these values was taken as the amplitude of the post-synaptic potential. Equation 4 was fitted to the data using the nonlinear least-squares method in MATLAB.
To gain an intuition for the responses, one can make a simple estimate of the amplitude of the IPSP by assuming that g e = 0 at all times, that g i = 0 before the synaptic input, and that the resting potential is the same as the inhibitory reversal potential, i.e., E l ≈ E i . One then obtains: Δ ⁢ 𝑉 𝐼 ⁢ 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑃 ≈ 𝑔 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ ( 𝐸 𝑙 − 𝐸 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) ( 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) ⁢ ( 𝑔 𝑖 + 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) . (5) Within the blue light intensity range used in our experiments, the CheRiff conductance is well approximated by a linear function of the blue intensity, though the proportionality factor depends on the (unknown) CheRiff expression level and attenuation of the blue light by scattering.
Equation 5 shows that for small g ChR the amplitude ΔV IPSP is linear in g ChR , while for large g ChR the quadratic term in the denominator dominates and ΔV IPSP decreases inversely with g ChR . The value of g ChR that gives the largest amplitude IPSP is 𝑔 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 = √ 𝑔 𝑙 ⁢ ( 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝑖 ) , or for weak inhibition, 𝑔 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑥 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ≈ 𝑔 𝑙 . If g l is large, then the shunting from g ChR is suppressed. The membrane time constant is approximately 𝜏 ≈ 𝐶 𝑔 𝑙 + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 . The inverse relation between τ and g ChR is consistent with our observation of faster recovery at stronger stimulus strength.
We considered two broad classes of L1 interneurons: laterally projecting neurogliaform cells (eNGC) and downward projecting single bouquet-like cells (SBC). To capture the firing properties of SBC, we used a modified form of the conductance-based model for hippocampal interneurons in Wang and Buzsáki (1996) 64. Wang, X.J. ∙ Buzsáki, G. Gamma oscillation by synaptic inhibition in a hippocampal interneuronal network model J. Neurosci. 1996; 16 :6402-6413 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ( Table S2 ). The voltage gated conductances responsible for the late-spiking pattern of eNGC have not been identified ( Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015 48. Overstreet-Wadiche, L. ∙ McBain, C.J. Neurogliaform cells in cortical circuits Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 16 :458-468 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). We included an A-type inactivating potassium conductance to capture the firing pattern ( Bard Ermentrout and Terman, 2010 6. Bard Ermentrout, G. ∙ Terman, D.H. Springer Science & Business Media, 2010 Google Scholar ). We then connected the two neuronal subtypes with distance dependent inhibitory synapses. ENGC cells synapsed onto each other and onto SBC cells. SBC cells did not synapse within L1. Simulations comprised 51 L1 interneurons (34 eNGC, 17 SBC) corresponding approximately to a single barrel ( Table S2 ).
We judged more detailed channel-based biophysical models to have too many unknown parameters. Simpler spike rate-based models did not capture the details of the spike timing or subthreshold potentials, which we judged important for L1 circuit function.
Each SBC neuron was described by a single compartment and simulated with the following equation: − 𝐶 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑉 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = − 𝐼 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) + 𝑔 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑛 4 ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝑘 ) + 𝑔 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 3 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑎 ) + 𝑔 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑘 ) + 𝑔 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝐶 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑅 ) + 𝑔 𝑒 ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝑒 ) + 𝑔 𝑖 ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝑖 ) + ε ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) (6) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝜙 ⁢ ( 𝛼 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑛 ) + 𝛽 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ 𝑛 ) ; (7) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑚 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛼 𝑚 ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑚 ) + 𝛽 𝑚 ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ 𝑚 ; (8) 𝑑 ⁢ ℎ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝜙 ⁢ ( 𝛼 ℎ ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ ( 1 − ℎ ) + 𝛽 ℎ ⁡ ( 𝑉 ) ⁢ ℎ ) (9) 𝛼 𝑛 = − 0 . 0 1 ⁢ ( 𝑉 + 2 4 ) 𝑒 − 0 . 1 ⁢ ( 𝑉 + 2 4 ) − 1 ; 𝛽 𝑛 = 0 . 1 2 5 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑉 + 3 4 8 0 ; 𝛼 𝑚 = − 0 . 1 ⁢ ( 𝑉 + 2 5 ) 𝑒 − 0 . 1 ⁢ ( 𝑉 + 2 5 ) − 1 ; 𝛽 𝑚 = 4 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑉 + 5 0 1 8 ; 𝛼 ℎ = 0 . 0 7 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑉 + 4 8 2 0 ; 𝛽 ℎ = 1 𝑒 − 0 . 1 ⁢ ( 𝑉 + 1 8 ) + 1 ; where 𝐶 𝑚 = 1 μF/cm 2 ; and 𝐼 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) is the injected current; the conductance of leak current, 𝑔 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑘 = 0.23 mS/cm 2 so that the passive time constant τ = 4.3 ms; 𝐸 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑘 = −66.8 mV; 𝑔 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑎 = 35 mS/cm 2 ; 𝐸 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑎 = 55 mV; 𝜙 = 5; 𝑔 𝑘 = 9 mS/cm 2 ; 𝐸 𝑘 = - 90 mV. The quantity ε ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑁 ⁡ ( 0 , σ 2 ) represents a Gaussian distributed white noise current with σ = 𝐴 ⁢ ( δ ⁢ 𝑡 ) 1 / 2 , where A ~1 pA cm -2 ms -1/2 and δt = 0.02 ms (or in some cases 0.05 ms) is the integration time-step. The equations were integrated using the Euler method.
The dynamics of eNGC neurons followed similar equations with the following difference: we included an A-type inactivating potassium conductance to capture the firing pattern. This channel contributed a current: 𝐼 𝐴 = 𝑔 𝐴 ⁢ ( 0 . 6 ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 1 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 1 4 + 0 . 4 ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 2 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 2 4 ) ⁢ ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝐴 ) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 1 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 − 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 1 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ; 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 2 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 − 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 2 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ; 𝑑 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 1 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 1 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 − ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 1 𝑡 ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 , 1 ; 𝑑 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 2 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 2 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 − ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 2 𝑡 ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 , 2 ; 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 = 1 𝑒 ( 𝑉 + 3 5 . 8 2 ) / 1 9 . 6 9 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 7 9 . 6 9 ) / 1 2 . 7 + 0 . 3 7 ; 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 1 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 = 1 1 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 6 0 ) 8 . 5 ; 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 2 , 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 = 1 1 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 3 6 ) 2 0 ; ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 = 1 1 + 𝑒 ( 𝑉 + 7 8 ) / 6 ; 𝑡 ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 , 1 = { 1 𝑒 ( 𝑉 + 4 6 . 0 5 ) / 5 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 2 3 8 . 4 ) / 3 7 . 4 5 f o r 𝑉 < − 6 3 1 9 f o r 𝑉 ≥ − 6 3 𝑡 ℎ ⁢ 𝑎 , 2 = { 1 𝑒 ( 𝑉 + 4 6 . 0 5 ) / 5 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 2 3 8 . 4 ) / 3 7 . 4 5 f o r 𝑉 < − 7 3 6 0 f o r 𝑉 ≥ − 7 3 where 𝑔 𝐴 = 10 mS/cm 2 ; 𝐸 𝐴 = −75 mV.
To introduce firing rate adaptation in SBC cells, we included a slow outward potassium current. This channel contributed a current: 𝐼 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 2 = 𝑔 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 2 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 ( 𝑉 − 𝐸 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 2 ) 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 − 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 ; 𝑑 ⁢ ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑡 = ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 − ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 𝑡 ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 ; 𝑡 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 = 1 𝑒 ( 𝑉 − 8 0 . 9 8 ) / 2 5 . 6 4 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 1 3 2 ) / 1 7 . 9 5 3 + 9 . 9 ; 𝑡 ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 = 1 𝑒 ( 𝑉 − 1 3 2 9 ) / 2 0 0 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 1 2 9 . 7 ) / 7 . 1 4 3 + 1 2 0 ; 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑘 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 = 1 ( 1 + 𝑒 − ( 𝑉 + 4 3 ) 1 7 ) 4 ; ℎ ⁢ 𝑘 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑓 = 1 1 + 𝑒 ( 𝑉 + 5 8 ) 1 0 . 6 ; where 𝑔 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 2 = 10 mS/cm 2 ; 𝐸 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 2 = −70 mV.
For the figure in Figure S7 , in order to produce high spontaneous firing, we set the resting potential higher at −55 mV for both eNGCs and SBCs.
The channelrhodopsin CheRiff was modeled as an excitatory conductance with reversal potential 0 mV and conductance proportional to blue light illumination intensity. Channel gating kinetics were assumed to be instantaneous. Patterns of blue light were targeted to one or more cells and modulated in time during the simulation.
Examination of patch clamp recordings of inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) in acute slices showed a rapid onset followed by a slow recovery. The recovery was not well captured by a single exponential. To approximate these dynamics we used the following function: 𝑔 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑔 0 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ ⁡ ( 𝑡 𝜏 1 ⁢ 𝑒 1 − 𝑡 𝜏 1 + 0 . 6 ⁢ 𝑡 𝜏 2 ⁢ 𝑒 1 − 𝑡 𝜏 2 ) τ 1 = 5 ms, τ 2 = 30 ms. We found that the qualitative network dynamics were insensitive to variations in the functional form or time constants. One may think of the two terms as representing GABA A and GABA B receptors respectively, though a more accurate implementation of a GABA B -mediated hyperpolarization would use the K + reversal potential (−90 mV) rather than the Cl - reversal potential (−70 mV).
To calibrate the value of 𝑔 0 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ for eNGC → eNGC and eNGC → SBC synapses, we set up a model circuit with one eNGC cell synapsing onto an eNGC cell and an SBC cell. We adjusted a simulated channelrhodopsin conductance ( E ChR = 0 mV) to depolarize the downstream cells to −55 mV. We then triggered the upstream cell to spike. We adjusted 𝑔 0 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ ℎ to induce IPSP amplitudes of −1.5 to −2 mV, to match the patch clamp data. The model did not contain short term inhibitory synaptic plasticity.
The IPSP amplitudes recorded via patch clamp were assumed to represent the strongest possible IPSPs. The IPSP strength between each pair of neurons in the circuit was modulated by a Gaussian function of separation, with a length-scale set by the sum of sizes of the presynaptic axonal arbor and the postsynaptic dendritic arbor ( Jiang et al., 2015 28. Jiang, X. ∙ Shen, S. ∙ Cadwell, C.R. ... Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex Science. 2015; 350 :aac9462 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We modeled thalamocortical excitation in L1 using the function: 𝑔 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = 𝑔 0 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁡ 𝑡 𝜏 ⁢ 𝑒 1 − 𝑡 𝜏 We calibrated the amplitude of 𝑔 0 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑥 ⁢ 𝑐 and τ by simulating thalamic inputs to eNGC cells and SBC-like cells and matching to literature data which showed that whisker-evoked EPSP amplitudes in vivo were 3 – 7 mV. We assumed that the time course of thalamic excitation to all neurons was identical. Excitatory synaptic strengths were randomized by 20%–30% between cells to prevent numerical degeneracies. The model did not contain short-term excitatory synaptic plasticity.
The greatest uncertainty in the model surrounded the time-course and strength of neuromodulatory inputs. We assumed that neuromodulatory inputs activated an excitatory conductance with reversal potential 0 mV. We assumed that the strength and time course of neuromodulatory action was the same on the eNGC and SBC-like neurons. If the coupling of neuromodulatory input to the SBC-like neurons was ufficiently strong, then these neurons could be driven to spike by neuromodulatory inputs, even in the absence of thalamic inputs.
Many possibly relevant features were omitted from the model. These include: gap junction connections between eNGC neurons ( Chu et al., 2003 10. Chu, Z. ∙ Galarreta, M. ∙ Hestrin, S. Synaptic interactions of late-spiking neocortical neurons in layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :96-102 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), activation of GABA B receptors or of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors ( Brombas et al., 2014 7. Brombas, A. ∙ Fletcher, L.N. ∙ Williams, S.R. Activity-dependent modulation of layer 1 inhibitory neocortical circuits by acetylcholine J. Neurosci. 2014; 34 :1932-1941 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), and possible feedback inhibition from deeper layer Martinotti cells ( Abs et al., 2018 2. Abs, E. ∙ Poorthuis, R.B. ∙ Apelblat, D. ... Learning-Related Plasticity in Dendrite-Targeting Layer 1 Interneurons Neuron. 2018; 100 :684-699 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). We did not consider a finer classification of L1 interneurons into sub-types. Our model also did not include cortico-cortical inputs. We did not study or simulate the effects of L1 interneuron activation on apical dendrites of deeper layer pyramidal cells. Activation of 5HT 3A ionotropic serotonin receptors is expected to have similar electrophysiological effects to activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, though the distribution of these two receptor-types in the different L1 interneuron sub-classes may be different.

The spatial light modulator (SLM) diffractively patterned the red laser (λ = 639 nm) into a set of discrete foci on the sample for holographic structured illumination excitation of a far red GEVI. The digital micromirror device (DMD) acted as a binary amplitude mask and projected a pattern of blue light onto the sample for targeted optogenetic activation of a blue-excited channelrhodopsin. Fluorescence from the sample was imaged onto a scientific CMOS camera. For two-photon (2P) imaging, pulsed infrared light (λ = 920 nm) was scanned by a pair of galvo mirrors.

PDF (812.99 KB) Methods S2 Synaptic and Morphological Parameters in Model of L1 Microcircuit, Related to STAR Methods (A) Characteristic morphology and spiking patterns of L1 interneurons. Electrophysiology traces adapted from ( Chu et al., 2003 10. Chu, Z. ∙ Galarreta, M. ∙ Hestrin, S. Synaptic interactions of late-spiking neocortical neurons in layer 1 J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :96-102 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and neuronal morphologies from ( Jiang et al., 2015 28. Jiang, X. ∙ Shen, S. ∙ Cadwell, C.R. ... Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex Science. 2015; 350 :aac9462 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Manual patch clamp recordings were acquired near rheobase. The eNGC cells form a mutually inhibitory network within L1. Downward-projecting SBC-like neurons receive inhibition from the eNGC network but do not have outputs within L1. (B) Model for synaptic inhibition. A simulated eNGC cell was stimulated to spike once. The simulated postsynaptic cells were optogenetically depolarized to -55 mV to introduce a driving force for Cl- entry. The time-course and amplitudes of the postsynaptic inhibitory conductances were adjusted to match experimental IPSPs of -1.5 to -2 mV. (C) Length-scale of connectivity. Data from ( Jiang et al., 2015 28. Jiang, X. ∙ Shen, S. ∙ Cadwell, C.R. ... Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex Science. 2015; 350 :aac9462 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ). Synaptic weights were set by Gaussian distributions fit to the experimental data. The length-scale of each synaptic connection was set to the sum of the widths of the axonal and dendritic arbors.
