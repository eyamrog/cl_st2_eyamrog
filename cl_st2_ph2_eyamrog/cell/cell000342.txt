Title: Soluble ACE2-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with proteins related to the renin-angiotensin system


Abstract: Summary

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause acute respiratory disease and multiorgan failure. Finding human host factors that are essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection could facilitate the formulation of treatment strategies. Using a human kidney cell line—HK-2—that is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and identified virus dependency factors (VDFs), which play regulatory roles in biological pathways linked to clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a role for a secretory form of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (sACE2), in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 exploits receptor-mediated endocytosis through interaction between its spike with sACE2 or sACE2-vasopressin via AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively. Our identification of VDFs and the regulatory effect of sACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 infection shed insight into pathogenesis and cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 as well as potential treatment strategies for COVID-19.

Section: Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a pandemic with >109 million confirmed cases and approximately 2.4 million fatalities ( https://covid19.who.int/ ). SARS-CoV-2 can cause substantial pulmonary diseases. Besides, numerous extrapulmonary manifestations such as cardiac and renal complications have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19 ( Gupta et al., 2020 23.

Med. 2020; 382 :1199-1207 Crossref Scopus (10789) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely unknown due to the lack of highly susceptible human cell lines for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection. As of now, a few studies have attempted to identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection either using non-human cells or modified human cells—that may not truly reflect the authentic infection process. These include studies using the CRISPR screening approach to identify host factors in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells, which are of non-human origin ( Wei et al., 2020 63. Wei, J. ∙ Alfajaro, M.M. ∙ DeWeirdt, P.C. ...

Genetic Screens Identify Host Factors for SARS-CoV-2 and Common Cold Coronaviruses Cell. 2021; 184 :106-119.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, another study reported the use of a focused CRISPR screening to target a small number of host factors, which were recently identified to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Hoffmann et al., 2021 29. Hoffmann, H.H. ∙ Sanchez-Rivera, F.J. ∙ Schneider, W.M. ... Functional interrogation of a SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome identifies unique and shared coronavirus host factors Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 :267-280.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, there remains a pressing need to identify host factors essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may uncover potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and provide insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis.
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), for cell entry (Zhou et al., 2020). Besides being a virus receptor, ACE2 functions as an important regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) ( Gheblawi et al., 2020 19. Gheblawi, M. ∙ Wang, K. ∙ Viveiros, A. ... Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor and Regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Discovery of ACE2 Circ. Res. 2020; 126 :1456-1474 Crossref Scopus (1407) PubMed Google Scholar ). To serve its regulatory role in the RAS, cellular ACE2 (cACE2) first needs to be transported to the cell surface, where it is cleaved by host proteases such as disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), to release an enzymatically active soluble form of ACE2 (sACE2) into the plasma ( Lambert et al., 2005 36. Lambert, D.W. ∙ Yarski, M. ∙ Warner, F.J. ... Tumor necrosis factor-alpha convertase (ADAM17) mediates regulated ectodomain shedding of the severe-acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :30113-30119 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (570) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sACE2 retains an intact SARS-CoV-2 interaction site, suggesting its ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, a recent study has observed that ACE2 shedding may be induced by regulatory pathways influenced by COVID-19 infection and that the concentrations of sACE2 may correlate with the level of systemic inflammation that occurs ( Kornilov et al., 2020 35. Kornilov, S.A. ∙ Lucas, I. ∙ Jade, K. ... Plasma levels of soluble ACE2are associated with sex, Metabolic Syndrome, and its biomarkers in a large cohort, pointing to a possible mechanism for increased severity in COVID-19 Crit. Care. 2020; 24 :452 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, most of the current research focus on studying the function of cACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis; the impact of circulating sACE2 on viral entry is largely unknown.
Tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be fully explained only by the expression pattern of cACE2. While a majority of cell susceptibility studies are based solely on the mRNA level of cACE2 ( Sungnak et al., 2020 58. Sungnak, W. ∙ Huang, N. ∙ Bécavin, C. ..., HCA Lung Biological Network SARS-CoV-2 entry factors are highly expressed in nasal epithelial cells together with innate immune genes Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :681-687 Crossref Scopus (1803) PubMed Google Scholar ), studies on its protein expression pattern is limited ( Bertram et al., 2012 6. Bertram, S. ∙ Heurich, A. ∙ Lavender, H. ... Influenza and SARS-coronavirus activating proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT are expressed at multiple sites in human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e35876 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hamming et al., 2004 25.

Pathol. 2004; 203 :631-637 Crossref Scopus (4236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recently, Wang et al. (2020) 61. Wang, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Luo, W. ... A comprehensive investigation of the mRNA and protein level of ACE2, the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in human tissues and blood cells Int. J. Med. Sci. 2020; 17 :1522-1531 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar comprehensively investigated the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues and discovered discordance between mRNA and protein expression levels of ACE2 in many tissues ( Wang et al., 2020 61.

Sci. 2020; 17 :1522-1531 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, studies of cACE2 mRNA and protein expression levels showed that only a small population of the lung cells has a detectable expression level of cACE2—that is in contrast to the common knowledge that the lungs are the primary site of infection ( Wang et al., 2020 61. Wang, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Luo, W. ... A comprehensive investigation of the mRNA and protein level of ACE2, the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in human tissues and blood cells Int. J. Med.

Med. 2020; 14 :185-192 Crossref Scopus (1638) PubMed Google Scholar ). Potentially, circulating sACE2, which retains the interaction site for binding to SARS-CoV-2, could interact with SARS-CoV-2 in the extracellular compartment forming complexes, which may affect the infectivity.
In this study, we report the identification of a human renal cell line—HK-2—which is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Using HK-2 cells, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screening and successfully identified virus dependency factors (VDFs), the expression of which is required for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detailed analysis of these VDFs suggested that perturbation of their functions could be linked to clinical symptoms and complications of COVID-19. Finally, we elucidated the important but overlooked role of sACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple methods, thus advancing our understanding of pathogenesis and treatment strategies for COVID-19.

Section: Results

To find an optimal human cell line that is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examined 11 human cell lines of different organs, including HK-2, Caco-2, A549, Calu3, Huh7, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, RD, HeLa, NT2, and 293T, along with Vero-E6 by inoculating the virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 72 h post-infection, median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) results showed that Vero-E6 cells strongly supported SARS-CoV-2 replication with high viral titer of 5.7 × 10 8 TCID 50 /mL ( Figure 1 A). Much lower viral titers, ranging from 4.2 × 10 3 to 7.9 × 10 4 TCID 50 /mL, were detected in most human cell lines ( Figure 1 A). Intriguingly, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in human renal proximal tubule cells (HK-2) with high viral titers of up to 3.8 × 10 8 TCID 50 /mL ( Figure 1 A). Among these cell lines are Vero-E6 and Caco-2, representing unmodified cell lines of non-human and human origins, respectively, which are known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 ( Bojkova et al., 2020 8. Bojkova, D. ∙ Klann, K. ∙ Koch, B. ... Proteomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected host cells reveals therapy targets Nature. 2020; 583 :469-472 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, effective replication of SARS-CoV-2 in HK-2 and Vero-E6 cells was further confirmed by western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA), which detected strong viral protein expression in the infected cells ( Figures 1 B and 1C). In comparison, WB analysis was unable to detect nucleocapsid protein (NP) expression in Caco-2 cells ( Figure 1 B), which was consistent with the IFA results showing a few positive-stained cells ( Figure 1 C). Consistent with viral load and the protein expression data ( Figures 1 A–1C), strong and moderate cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in HK-2 and Vero-E6 cells, respectively, but not in Caco-2 cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 1 D). SARS-CoV-2 exhibited similar replication kinetics in HK-2 and Vero-E6, whereas in Caco-2 cells, it replicated less efficiently ( Figure 1 E). Taken together, HK-2 strongly supports the lytic infection of SARS-CoV-2, representing a suitable cell line model of human origin for studying the molecular interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and human host.
To identify the VDFs essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication, we used a puromycin-marked feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-based lenti-vector-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library to target human transcripts in HK-2 cells followed by the challenge of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figures 2 A and S1 ). We anticipated that HK-2 cells that were knocked down for mRNA—which were dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 replication—would succumb rapidly upon infection. In contrast, a shRNA clone silenced an mRNA essential for lytic SARS-CoV-2 replication would survive. The identity of shRNA in the survival cells was determined by high-throughput sequencing ( Figure 2 A). Principal component analysis (PCA) plot and heatmap based on the abundance of all identified shRNA sequences mapped against the human reference genome revealed good spatial-temporal separation between SARS-CoV-2-infected and mock-infected samples ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Pathway analysis of VDFs with ≥3-fold enrichment in SARS-CoV-2-infected HK-2 cells revealed 16 significantly affected biological pathways (p < 0.05) related to cardiac (pink), pulmonary (blue), liver (green), and renal (brown) diseases ( Figure 2 D). Notably, 11 of these 16 biological pathways were related to cardiac diseases (pink; Figure 2 D). In addition, PANTHER pathway analysis of the identified VDFs was performed using a cut-off p value of 0.001, and eight major affected molecular pathways were discovered ( Figure 2 E). Among these, the top-affected molecular pathways “Vasopressin-like receptors (R-HSA-388479),” and “Defective AVP does not bind AVPR1A,B and causes neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (NDI) (R-HSA-5619099)” were also involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system (pink; Figure 2 E). Knockdown of individual VDFs involved in the vasopressin-related pathway using corresponding small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) resulted in significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (p < 0.01; 45.6%–90.7% of inhibition; Figure 2 F). The strong inhibitory effects warranted further study of the VDFs that are functionally related to the vasopressin pathway on SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Vasopressin can enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis through membrane remodeling and vesicle trafficking ( Innamorati et al., 2001 31. Innamorati, G. ∙ Le Gouill, C. ∙ Balamotis, M. ... The long and the short cycle. Alternative intracellular routes for trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :13096-13103 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, our gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed a close relationship of the VDFs to plasma membrane (79%), membrane raft (12%), as well as intracellular trafficking and secretion, and vesicle (9%), which are known to be important in regulating cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking ( Figure 3 A; left). Similarly, we also performed GO enrichment analysis using gene candidates that were previously reported to be important for the replication of other coronaviruses ( Ashburner et al., 2000 2. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ..., The Gene Ontology Consortium Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (30128) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bairoch et al., 2005 4. Bairoch, A. ∙ Apweiler, R. ∙ Wu, C.H. ...

Mendelian Inheritance in Man and its online version, OMIM Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 80 :588-604 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (546) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oughtred et al., 2019 46. Oughtred, R. ∙ Stark, C. ∙ Breitkreutz, B.J. ... The BioGRID interaction database: 2019 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D529-D541 Crossref Scopus (881) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pruitt et al., 2005 49. Pruitt, K.D. ∙ Tatusova, T. ∙ Maglott, D.R. NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq): a curated non-redundant sequence database of genomes, transcripts and proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :D501-D504 Crossref Scopus (1416) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, gene candidates related to plasma membrane (20%) as well as intracellular trafficking and secretion, and vesicle (18%) also contributed substantially to the biogenesis of coronaviruses ( Figure 3 A; right).
Next, we performed a volcano plot analysis to identify VDFs that could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication ( Figure 3 B). Manual gene annotation revealed that certain enriched VDFs have functional roles related to the regulation of the cardiovascular system, the cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking pathway, and the renal-related disease ( Figure 3 B), which was consistent with the results generated from our pathway and GO enrichment analyses ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and 3 A). The differential gene enrichment of the VDFs with a false positive rate (FDR) of <5% is displayed in the heatmap ( Figure 3 C). Of these, 22 VDFs were selected according to their biological roles for further validation. Consistent with our RNAi screening results, knockdown of individual VDFs using corresponding siRNAs resulted in significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection (p < 0.01; 46.5%–95.4% of inhibition; Figure 3 D). Particularly, potent inhibition (>80%) was observed in some VDFs with biological functions related to the control of cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking pathway (GPR176, CAPNS1, IL18RAP, ARL4D, and CXCR1; red boxed; Figure 3 D) and the endosomal/lysosomal system (ANXA8 and ANXA1; green boxed; Figure 3 D). Together, our results evidenced that cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and the endosomal/lysosomal system are important biological pathways for the replication of SARS-CoV-2.
In view of the importance of vasopressin-related VDFs in SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 2 F), we further tested if SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on vasopressin. Compared to the mock-treated control, HK-2 cells pretreated with increasing doses of vasopressin showed a significant increase in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity as determined by the TCID 50 assays ( Figure 4 A). It is known that circulating sACE2 is an important regulator of the RAS, while vasopressin production could also be regulated by the RAS ( Reid et al., 1983 51. Reid, I.A. ∙ Schwartz, J. ∙ Ben, L. ... Interactions between vasopressin and the renin--angiotensin system Prog. Brain Res. 1983; 60 :475-491 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that sACE2 retains an intact interaction site for binding to SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesized that there may be interaction between vasopressin and sACE2, which could modulate the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. To examine their interactions, we spiked recombinant spike (S) of SARS-CoV-2 into culture medium of 293T cells, which were doubly transfected with FLAG-tagged vasopressin and V5-tagged ACE2. Secretions of sACE2 and vasopressin were confirmed by WB analyses of the conditioned medium of transfected cells ( Figure 4 B; lane 1). As expected, pull-down of sACE2 could effectively co-immunoprecipitate the S ( Figure 4 B; lane 2). Intriguingly, vasopressin was detected in the same co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting that sACE2 could form a complex with S and vasopressin ( Figure 4 B; lane 2). To further examine if there was any interaction between S and vasopressin, we removed vasopressin from the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. Pull-down of sACE2 was able to co-immunoprecipitate the S ( Figure 4 B; lane 3), but the amount was lower compared to the reaction containing vasopressin ( Figure 4 B; lane 1). Remarkably, when S was removed from the co-immunoprecipitation reaction, vasopressin was no longer able to be co-immunoprecipitated by sACE2, suggesting that the S was required for the formation of sACE2-S-vasopressin complex ( Figure 4 B; lane 4). The interaction between vasopressin and S was supported by successful co-immunoprecipitation of S by pulling down of vasopressin in the absence of ACE2 ( Figure 4 B; lane 5). The interactions between vasopressin, sACE2, and S of SARS-CoV-2 were further confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation using HK-2 cells. It is expected that the HK-2 cells, which are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, could have sufficient endogenous sACE2 for the formation of the sACE2-S-vasopressin complex. Consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results using 293T cells, pull-down of the vasopressin using supernatants of FLAG-tagged vasopressin transfected HK-2 cells—in the presence of S—was able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous sACE2 and S ( Figure 4 B; lane 6). In contrast, sACE2 was unable to be co-immunoprecipitated by vasopressin in the absence of S ( Figure 4 B; lane 8). Overall, our results supported the possible formation of sACE2-S-vasopressin complex, in which the strength of the sACE2-S interaction could be enhanced in the presence of vasopressin.
Vasopressin functions by binding to its membrane receptors, which could trigger a process called receptor-mediated endocytosis. Consistent with our interaction assay results, which showed that vasopressin could form a complex with sACE2 and S ( Figure 4 B), knockdown of a vasopressin receptor—AVPR1B—potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection (89.66% ± 0.14 inhibition; Figures 2 F and S2 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may enter cells via the receptor-mediated endocytosis through AVPR1B. To test this hypothesis, non-permissive 293T cells were first transfected with a plasmid overexpressing AVPR1B, followed by inoculating the conditioned supernatants, which contained the sACE2-S-vasopressin complex prepared in Figure 4 B. IFA showed that the AVPR1B was primarily localized on the plasma membrane of the transfected 293T cells ( Figure 4 C). At 6 h post-inoculation, the AVPR1B-transfected cells showed decreased immunofluorescent intensity on the plasma membrane but increased puncta-staining pattern in the cytosol ( Figure 4 C). IFA revealed a strong co-localization signal between S and AVPR1B at the puncta ( Figure 4 C), suggesting internalization of sACE2-S-vasopressin complex via AVPR1B.
Interaction between ACE2 and cellular receptor AT1 has been reported ( Deshotels et al., 2014 17. Deshotels, M.R. ∙ Xia, H. ∙ Sriramula, S. ... Angiotensin II mediates angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 internalization and degradation through an angiotensin II type I receptor-dependent mechanism Hypertension. 2014; 64 :1368-1375 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test if the sACE2-S-vasopressin complex—like AVPR1B—could also be internalized into cells via AT1, we performed overexpression experiments using the same experimental conditions as described above. Over the infection time course, IFA results detecting the YFP-tagged AT1 and recombinant S showed that 293T cells transfected with the AT1 also displayed increasing puncta staining pattern in the cytosol after inoculation with conditioned supernatant containing sACE2-S-vasopressin complex ( Figure 4 D). As our interaction assay showed that the sACE2 could interact with S in the absence of vasopressin ( Figure 4 B), we tested if the sACE2-S complex could also enter cells by utilizing the same cell entry mechanism. Under the same experimental conditions, similar puncta staining pattern could be observed in the YFP-tagged AT1-transfected 293T cells following inoculation of the sACE2-S complex ( Figure 4 E). Together, our results suggested that the sACE2-S complex and sACE2-S-vasopressin complex could enter cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis through AVPR1B and/or AT1 receptors.
Receptor-mediated endocytosis is known to be regulated by cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and the endosomal/lysosomal system ( Simonetti and Cullen, 2019 56. Simonetti, B. ∙ Cullen, P.J. Actin-dependent endosomal receptor recycling Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2019; 56 :22-33 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further examine the role of cytokinesis and vesicle trafficking in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we treated the HK-2 cells with two cytoskeletal drugs—Jasplakinolide and Cytochalasin D (CytD)—prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared to the mock-treated control cells, HK-2 cells pretreated with Jasplakinolide and CytD showed 2.15-log (p < 0.001) and 1.33-log (p < 0.001) reductions in viral load, respectively ( Figure 4 F). WB and IFA results confirmed undetectable and minimal SARS-CoV-2 NP expression in pretreated cells ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Besides a substantial reduction in the number of positively stained cells in the CytD-treated HK-2 cells, we observed an altered staining pattern with the viral antigen expression primarily restricted to the plasma membrane forming a “ring-like” structure ( Figure 4 H). These results suggested that perturbation of the cytoskeletal organization may hamper the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cytosol.
Besides, CytD is known to be able to modulate the function of the endosomal-lysosomal system. Indeed, our RNAi screening also identified several VDFs that are related to this system, of which four (ANXA8, ANXA1, ANXA8L1, and ALS2) have been validated ( Figure 3 D). Given that endosomal acidification plays important roles in receptor-mediated cell entry in some viruses ( Glebov, 2020 20. Glebov, O.O. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis for COVID-19 drug repurposing FEBS J. 2020; 287 :3664-3671 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ), we examined if the change of endosomal pH would affect SARS-CoV-2 replication by impairing the function of the proton pump—vacuolar H + -ATPase (V-ATPase)—which is responsible for controlling the endosomal pH via a specific inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) ( Cotter et al., 2015 12. Cotter, K. ∙ Stransky, L. ∙ McGuire, C. ... Recent Insights into the Structure, Regulation, and Function of the V-ATPases Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40 :611-622 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pretreatment of HK-2 cells using the BafA1 at a concentration of 25 ηM showed a significant inhibition (>4-log) of SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with the mock-treated control cells (p < 0.001; Figure 4 F). Pretreatment with a 10-fold lower dose (2.5 ηM) of BafA1 also achieved a similar level of inhibition (>4-log) (p < 0.001; Figure 4 F). Consistently, viral protein expression was not detected by WB and IFA in the BafA1-treated cells ( Figures 4 G and 4H).
Thus far, our results supported a potential cell entry mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endocytosis pathway ( Figure 4 C–4H). Receptor-mediated endocytosis is known to involve membrane scission of nascent vesicles from plasma membrane by dynamin 2 (Dyn2) ( González-Jamett et al., 2013 21. González-Jamett, A.M. ∙ Momboisse, F. ∙ Haro-Acuña, V. ... Dynamin-2 function and dysfunction along the secretory pathway Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2013; 4 :126 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further test the requirement of Dyn2, we targeted its function by transfecting a plasmid overexpressing the dominant-negative Dyn2 (Dyn2-K44A) prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast to the GFP-wild-type Dyn2-transfected cells showing strong co-localization between the GFP-tagged Dyn2 and SARS-CoV-2 NP, no co-localization was detected in the GFP-Dyn2-K44A-transfected cells ( Figure 4 I), suggesting entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells through the Dyn2-dependent endocytosis pathway.
Dyn2-dependent endocytosis involves a vesicular transport event to facilitate the internalization and recycling of receptors ( Cullen and Steinberg, 2018 13. Cullen, P.J. ∙ Steinberg, F. To degrade or not to degrade: mechanisms and significance of endocytic recycling Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :679-696 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to being a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 controls blood pressure homeostasis, which requires complex regulatory events involving protein trafficking as well as post-translational modifications. First, surface trafficking and sorting are required for plasma membrane expression of the cACE2. On the surface, cACE2 requires proteolytic cleavage by proteases such as disintegrin and ADAM17 to release circulating sACE2 to the extracellular space. It is conceivable that the shedding of cACE2 could modulate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. To test this possibility, prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we pretreated HK-2 cells with GW280264X, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of ADAM17. Following the treatment, successful inhibition of sACE2 but not cACE2 expression was confirmed by WB ( Figure 5 A). Notably, pretreatment of GW280264X potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-dependent manner as shown by WB, TCID 50 , and IFA ( Figures 5 A–5C).
In addition, we independently performed knockdown experiments to confirm the regulatory effect of ADAM17 on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Consistent with the results of the GW280264X treatment experiment, a reduction of sACE2 was also observed in the siADAM17-transfected cells ( Figure 5 D). Dose-dependent reductions in viral loads (p < 0.001) and NP expression were observed in siADAM17-transfected cells ( Figure 5 D–5F). Overall, our results suggested that targeting ACE2 shedding could modulate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.
Our results showed that sACE2 could facilitate virus cell entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis, suggesting its potentially important role on SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further substantiate its role, we tested the effect of sACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in HK-2 cells at a low MOI of 0.01. Under this infection condition, ∼10% of cells could be infected ( Figure 6 A). With increasing doses of recombinant ACE2 (rACE2) on HK-2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity increased to 30% and 50%, respectively, as evidenced by stronger CPEs and higher expression of SARS-CoV-2 NP observed in the infected cells ( Figure 6 A). The results suggested that the addition of rACE2, mimicking the sACE2, could enhance SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. This effect, however, was not observed when performing the experiment using Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV under the same conditions ( Figure S3 ). To further confirm the role of sACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we repeated the same experiment using two human lung cell lines—Calu3 and A549. Consistently, WB and TCID 50 results showed a dose-dependent augmentation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in both cell lines treated with an increasing dose of rACE2 ( Figure 6 B). Intriguingly, cell lines—including RD, NT2, HepG2, and Huh7—derived from organs other than the lung also showed increase in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility when treated with an increasing dose of rACE2 ( Figure 6 B).
To investigate the role of sACE2 under physiologically relevant conditions, we selected a panel of human cell lines from different organs and examined their relationship between the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and sACE2 and cACE2 expressions. Consistent with previous studies on the rare expression of ACE2 in many cell types ( Lukassen et al., 2020 40. Lukassen, S. ∙ Chua, R.L. ∙ Trefzer, T. ... SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are primarily expressed in bronchial transient secretory cells EMBO J. 2020; 39 :e105114 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020 61. Wang, Y. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Luo, W. ... A comprehensive investigation of the mRNA and protein level of ACE2, the putative receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in human tissues and blood cells Int. J. Med. Sci. 2020; 17 :1522-1531 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), WB results demonstrated that the protein expression of ACE2 could only be detected in a few cell lines ( Figure 6 C). Expectedly, high expression of sACE2 and cACE2 was found in the conditioned supernatants and cell lysates of HK-2 cells ( Figure 6 C; lane 11), respectively, and the results were in line with the high susceptibility of HK-2 to SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1 ). As shown by the detection of NP in the infected cell lysates, relatively high expression level of sACE2 but undetectable level of cACE2 in Calu3 cells seemed to support SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 6 C; lane 10). We also noted the expression of sACE2 but not cACE2 in Caco-2 cells ( Figure 6 C; lane 3). Although WB analysis was unable to detect the NP expression ( Figures 1 B and 6 C; lane 3), IFA and TCID 50 assays consistently detected viral antigens and RNAs, though at a much lower levels compared to HK-2 cells, in the infected Caco-2 cells ( Figures 1 C and 1E). Notably, HepG2 cells were unable to support SARS-CoV-2 infection despite a strong expression of cACE2 (but not sACE2) detected in this cell line ( Figure 6 C; lane 6).
To monitor sACE2 during the SARS-CoV-2 infection process, we utilized a GFP-tagged ACE2 mutant lacking the transmembrane domain—GFP-ACE2ΔTM—to mimic sACE2 ( Procko, 2020 48. Procko, E. The sequence of human ACE2 is suboptimal for binding the S spike protein of SARS coronavirus 2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) for infection. We first validated the subcellular localization of GFP-ACE2ΔTM by transfecting it into 293T cells. In contrast to the cells transfected with the wild-type ACE2, where the ACE2 proteins were readily detected in both cell lysates and conditioned supernatants ( Figure S4 A, lane 1), cells transfected with the GFP-ACE2ΔTM could only be detected in the conditioned supernatants ( Figure S4 A, lane 2), suggesting that most ACE2 (i.e., GFP-ACE2ΔTM) was exported out into the extracellular space and not retained inside the cells. These results were consistent with the IFA results where the GFP signal could be detected in cells transfected with the wild-type ACE2 but not the GFP-ACE2ΔTM ( Figure S4 B). We then performed confocal microscopy analysis of the GFP-ACE2ΔTM-transfected cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, orthogonal projections of confocal sections revealed strong co-localization of SARS-CoV-2 NP and GFP-ACE2ΔTM ( Figure 6 D). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the confocal images is available in Video S1 . Profiles of fluorescent intensity measured at different focal planes also revealed a high degree of overlapping signals between the SARS-CoV-2 NP and GFP-ACE2ΔTM ( Figure 6 E; Video S1 ). Further optical sectioning of the infected cells revealed that similar to the formation of vesicles during the endocytosis, a punctate pattern of viral antigen predominantly localized on the cell surface ( Figure 6 F). Together, these results support that sACE2 could interact with SARS-CoV-2 during the infection process and that sACE2 has a potentially determining role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Section: Discussion

We have successfully identified VDFs that are important for SARS-CoV-2 to establish a productive virus replication ( Figure 7 ), and their annotated functions were correlated with clinical manifestation and complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increasing evidence support the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular and renal-related diseases ( Camm and Camm, 2020 9. Camm, C.F. ∙ Camm, A.J. The cardiac effects of SARS-CoV2: COVID-19 special issue Eur. Heart J. Case Rep. 2020; 4 :1-2 Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2020 64. Yang, X. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Xu, J. ...

Med. 2020; 8 :475-481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7038) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations were also in line with the RNAi screening results, in which the functional annotation of some enriched VDFs and their biological pathways were also linked to the regulation of cardiac and renal functions. In fact, pathway analysis of VDFs showed ∼70% of significantly affected biological pathways are related to cardiac diseases (pink; Figure 2 D). The most affected biological pathway is related to cardiac arrhythmias, which is often observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, especially in critically ill cases ( Figure 2 D) ( Babapoor-Farrokhran et al., 2020 3. Babapoor-Farrokhran, S. ∙ Rasekhi, R.T. ∙ Gill, D. ... Arrhythmia in COVID-19 SN Compr. Clin. Med. 2020; Crossref Google Scholar ; Karamchandani et al., 2020 34.

Cardiac arrhythmias among hospitalized Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) patients: prevalence, characterization, and clinical algorithm to classify arrhythmic risk Int. J. Clin. Pract. 2020; Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides, we also identified three significantly affected renal disease-related pathways (brown; Figure 2 D), which is in line with the high incidence of acute kidney injury reported in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases ( Yang et al., 2020 64. Yang, X. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Xu, J. ... Clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a single-centered, retrospective, observational study Lancet Respir. Med. 2020; 8 :475-481 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7038) PubMed Google Scholar ). A previous study also reported the presence of coronavirus-like particles in >75% kidney biopsies of deceased SARS-CoV-2 patients ( Su et al., 2020 57. Su, H. ∙ Yang, M. ∙ Wan, C. ... Renal histopathological analysis of 26 postmortem findings of patients with COVID-19 in China Kidney Int. 2020; 98 :219-227 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1290) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, PANTHER pathway analysis of the enriched VDFs identified vasopressin-related pathways as the top-affected molecular pathways ( Figure 2 E). The important roles of these vasopressin-related VDFs in SARS-CoV-2 infection were further validated by performing knockdown experiment ( Figure 2 F). Previous studies showed that vasopressin can induce differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes and promote heart muscle homeostasis ( Yasin et al., 1994 65. Yasin, S. ∙ Costa, A. ∙ Navarra, P. ... Endothelin-1 stimulates the in vitro release of neurohypophyseal hormones, but not corticotropin-releasing hormone, via ETA receptors Neuroendocrinology. 1994; 60 :553-558 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). It can also control tonicity of body fluids by converting to arginine vasopressin (AVP) that can further regulate the arterial blood pressure ( Demiselle et al., 2020 16. Demiselle, J. ∙ Fage, N. ∙ Radermacher, P. ... Vasopressin and its analogues in shock states: a review Ann. Intensive Care. 2020; 10 :9 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, due to their regulatory roles in maintaining homeostasis of kidney and heart, dysregulated expressions of vasopressin and AVP were also directly linked to the development of renal failure and cardiovascular system diseases ( Czarzasta et al., 2018 14. Czarzasta, K. ∙ Cudnoch-Jedrzejewska, A. ∙ Niemczyk, L. ... Effect of Chronic Kidney Disease on Changes in Vasopressin System Expression in the Kidney Cortex in Rats with Nephrectomy BioMed Res. Int. 2018; 2018 :2607928 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, further investigation of the identified VDFs involved in cardiac and renal disease development may provide mechanistic insights into SARS-CoV-2-induced extrapulmonary diseases.
sACE2 and vasopressin play important roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. ACE2, being a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 ( Wan et al., 2020 60. Wan, Y. ∙ Shang, J. ∙ Graham, R. ... Receptor Recognition by the Novel Coronavirus from Wuhan: an Analysis Based on Decade-Long Structural Studies of SARS Coronavirus J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e00127-20 Crossref Scopus (3197) PubMed Google Scholar ), is also known to serve as one of the key regulators controlling the release of vasopressin into the plasma for the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis via the RAS ( Matsukawa and Miyamoto, 2011 42. Matsukawa, T. ∙ Miyamoto, T. Angiotensin II-stimulated secretion of arginine vasopressin is inhibited by atrial natriuretic peptide in humans Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2011; 300 :R624-R629 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reid et al., 1983 51. Reid, I.A. ∙ Schwartz, J. ∙ Ben, L. ... Interactions between vasopressin and the renin--angiotensin system Prog. Brain Res. 1983; 60 :475-491 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). To serve its regulatory role in the RAS, the tissue-bound form of ACE2 (i.e., cACE2) is shed by proteases to produce the sACE2, which can then enter the circulatory system. As sACE2 preserves the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that sequestration of SARS-CoV-2 by sACE2 may enable cell entry of tissues where cACE2 is poorly expressed. Indeed, our in vitro data showed that endogenous sACE2 could interact with the S of SARS-CoV-2 in the extracellular compartment ( Figure 4 B). The resulting sACE2-S complex could then enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis via the AT1 surface receptor ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Additionally, we found that the S of SARS-CoV-2 could interact with vasopressin forming an sACE2-S-vasopressin complex, which facilitated cell entry via another vasopressin receptor, AVPR1B ( Figures 4 B and 4C). This new cell entry mechanism may explain our data showing that cells from various organs could be sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 upon administration of rACE2 ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
sACE2 expression contributes to the cell line susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Little or low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all tested human cell lines, except for the HK-2 cells ( Figure 6 C). In contrast to HK-2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is unable to replicate efficiently in 293T, although both cell lines were derived from human kidney. We speculate that the differential susceptibility may be linked to their differences in sACE2 level. We also noted that while highly susceptible HK-2 cells exhibited very strong expressions of both cACE2 and sACE2 ( Figure 6 C; lane 11), expression of cACE2 alone does not render the cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as exemplified in HepG2 and 293T cells where cACE2, but not sACE2, was detected ( Figure 6 C; lanes 6 and 9). In contrast, expression of sACE2 alone in Caco-2 and Calu3 cells was able to support SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 6 C; lanes 3 and 10). Although WB results failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 NP expression in Caco-2 cells, our qRT-PCR and IFA results confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein in the infected Caco-2 cells ( Figures 1 A, 1C and 1E). The low expression level of sACE2 in Caco-2 cells may weakly support SARS-CoV-2 infection. This observation coincides with IFA and WB results, which showed a dose-dependent augmentation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in cells administered with an increasing dose of rACE2 ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Together, our in vitro infection data using human cell lines that originated from different organs support the important role of sACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We discovered the dual role of sACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Modulating the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity using recombinant sACE2 has been previously suggested as a treatment strategy for COVID-19. Attempts have been made to utilize recombinant soluble human ACE2 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection using in vitro model ( Cocozza et al., 2020 11. Cocozza, F. ∙ Névo, N. ∙ Piovesana, E. ... Extracellular vesicles containing ACE2 efficiently prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-containing virus J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2020; 10 :e12050 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Monteil et al., 2020 45. Monteil, V. ∙ Kwon, H. ∙ Prado, P. ... Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Engineered Human Tissues Using Clinical-Grade Soluble Human ACE2 Cell. 2020; 181 :905-913.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1614) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these studies, very high concentrations of rACE2 [∼10–200 μg/mL of ACE2, concentrations are much higher than its physiological range in plasma, i.e., ηg/mL; Ridwan et al., 2019 52. Ridwan, R. ∙ Natzir, R. ∙ Rasyid, H. ... Decreased Renal Function Induced by High-Fat Diet in Wistar Rat: The Role of Plasma Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Biomed. Pharmacol. J. 2019; 12 :1279-1287 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ; Sama et al., 2020 53. Sama, I.E. ∙ Ravera, A. ∙ Santema, B.T. ... Circulating plasma concentrations of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in men and women with heart failure and effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors Eur. Heart J. 2020; 41 :1810-1817 Crossref Scopus (339) PubMed Google Scholar ) were required to achieve inhibitory effects. Indeed, our results were also in line with their findings, where 25 and 100 μg/mL of rACE2 could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure S3 ). We speculate that the addition of excessive amounts (i.e., μg/mL level) of recombinant ACE2 may saturate endocytic recycling of the ACE2 receptor, competing with the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex for cell entry, therefore resulting in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. In contrast, rACE2 concentrations close to physiological range (i.e., ηg/mL level) could enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figures 6 A, 6B, and S3 ). Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was recently reported in a study that provided an important clue on the in vivo effect of the rACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-infected patient ( Zoufaly et al., 2020 72. Zoufaly, A. ∙ Poglitsch, M. ∙ Aberle, J.H. ... Human recombinant soluble ACE2 in severe COVID-19 Lancet Respir. Med. 2020; 8 :1154-1158 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). The study showed that substantial and steady increases in viral loads were detected in tracheal aspirates (from ∼10 3 copies/mL at day 0 to ∼10 5 copies/mL at day 2) and nasopharyngeal swabs (from ∼10 4 copies/mL at day 0 to ∼10 5 copies/mL at day 5), respectively, after the administration of rACE2. Although the patient eventually recovered after the appearance of neutralizing antibodies, this in vivo data and our findings suggested that treatment that may alter sACE2 level in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered.
The discovery of a highly permissive human renal cell line—HK-2—to SARS-CoV-2 is useful for studying the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the possible therapeutic options for COVID-19. The physiological and pathological relevance of using this HK-2 cell line in studying SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis is supported by recent ultrastructural studies that detected SARS-CoV-2 in renal autopsy of patients with COVID-19 ( Farkash et al., 2020 18. Farkash, E.A. ∙ Wilson, A.M. ∙ Jentzen, J.M. Ultrastructural Evidence for Direct Renal Infection with SARS-CoV-2 J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2020; 31 :1683-1687 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). The versatility of HK-2 is further supported by our RNAi screening results, in which many successfully identified VDFs were not only linked to renal-related diseases but also other clinical manifestations and complications of COVID-19 ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Furthermore, most current studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection were based on the use of pseudovirus-expressing viral surface S protein or non-human cell lines, which may not truly reflect an authentic infection process ( Heaton et al., 2020 27. Heaton, B.E. ∙ Trimarco, J.D. ∙ Hamele, C.E. ... SRSF protein kinases 1 and 2 are essential host factors for human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Shang et al., 2020 55. Shang, J. ∙ Wan, Y. ∙ Luo, C. ... Cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :11727-11734 Crossref Scopus (2238) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings using authentic virus to infect physiologically relevant HK-2 cells revealed that SARS-CoV-2 entered the cells mainly through Dyn2-dependent endocytosis ( Figures 4 F–4I). The involvement of cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and the endosomal/lysosomal system in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was further confirmed through the use of inhibitors (Jasplakinolide, CytD, and BafA1) and a dominant-negative Dyn2 construct ( Figures 4 F–4I). Of note, our results showed that a potent inhibition (>4-log) of SARS-CoV-2 replication could be achieved even when cells were pretreated with a low dose of BafA1 (i.e., 2.5 ηM) ( Figures 4 F–4H), which could inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis ( Harada et al., 1996 26. Harada, M. ∙ Sakisaka, S. ∙ Yoshitake, M. ... Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPases, inhibits the receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins in isolated rat hepatocytes J. Hepatol. 1996; 24 :594-603 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further investigation of the BafA1 and its analogs as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19 is warranted.
Modulating the shedding of sACE2 may provide insights into treatment strategies for COVID-19. A previous study suggested that the ADAM17 activity could be correlated with infectivity of SARS-CoV, which also utilized ACE2 as a cellular receptor ( Haga et al., 2008 24. Haga, S. ∙ Yamamoto, N. ∙ Nakai-Murakami, C. ... Modulation of TNF-alpha-converting enzyme by the spike protein of SARS-CoV and ACE2 induces TNF-alpha production and facilitates viral entry Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :7809-7814 Crossref Scopus (441) PubMed Google Scholar ). The authors reported that the S of SARS-CoV induced the ADAM17 activity causing an enhanced ACE2 shedding, which was positively correlated with SARS-CoV infectivity. It is possible that cells could be sensitized to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by enhancing the production of sACE2 through the induction of ADAM17 activity. On the flip side, controlling the activity/expression of ADAM17 could be a potential treatment strategy for COVID-19. Indeed, we demonstrated that inhibition of ADAM17 by a sheddase inhibitor, GW280264X, or by a specific siRNA potently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figures 5 A–5F). The therapeutic potential of targeting the ADAM17 has also been widely investigated in cancer research with minimal side effects ( Bandsma et al., 2015 5. Bandsma, R.H. ∙ van Goor, H. ∙ Yourshaw, M. ... Loss of ADAM17 is associated with severe multiorgan dysfunction Hum. Pathol. 2015; 46 :923-928 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Blaydon et al., 2011 7. Blaydon, D.C. ∙ Biancheri, P. ∙ Di, W.L. ... Inflammatory skin and bowel disease linked to ADAM17 deletion N. Engl. J. Med. 2011; 365 :1502-1508 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that it may represent a safe target in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our identification of inhibitors, including the sheddase inhibitor, the cytoskeletal drugs and/or siRNAs/drugs targeting the VDFs, could provide insights into future development of drug combination therapy, which can be considered as an effective strategy in preventing the generation of drug-resistant mutants, particularly in the case of RNA viruses ( Presloid and Novella, 2015 47. Presloid, J.B. ∙ Novella, I.S. RNA Viruses and RNAi: Quasispecies Implications for Viral Escape Viruses. 2015; 7 :3226-3240 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), for the treatment of COVID-19.
This study has several limitations as the findings are based on HK-2 cells, which are of renal origin. As the primary infection site of SARS-CoV-2 is lung, further examinations will be needed to study the involvement of these factors during pulmonary infection. Besides, during the preparation of our manuscript, several CRISPR/Cas9 screening studies have been published, in which the VDFs identified are largely different in these studies. One reason may be due to the key difference between CRISPR and RNAi, where CRISPR results in true loss-of-function effects, which is in contrast to RNAi that may create hypomorphic phenotypes, thus allowing us to study essential genes whose knockout may otherwise be cell lethal. While both technologies are considered powerful tools to identify VDFs for replication, perhaps combining results from each approach could help fully to understand the underlying biology of SARS-CoV-2.

Eleven human cell lines (HK-2, Caco-2, A549, Calu-3, Huh7, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, RD, HeLa, NT2, and 293T) derived from different organs were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2, in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) or minimum essential medium (MEM; GIBCO) or DMEM/F12 (GIBCO) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO). Similarly, a type of African green monkey kidney epithelial cells—Vero-E6—were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS. All cell lines have been authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination (Pangenia Lifesciences Limited).
SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-001a) was isolated from a nasopharyngeal aspirate of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient in Hong Kong ( To et al., 2020 59. To, K.K. ∙ Tsang, O.T. ∙ Yip, C.C. ...

MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 strain) and was a gift from Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center)( Zaki et al., 2012 70. Zaki, A.M. ∙ van Boheemen, S. ∙ Bestebroer, T.M. ... Isolation of a novel coronavirus from a man with pneumonia in Saudi Arabia N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 367 :1814-1820 Crossref Scopus (4218) PubMed Google Scholar ). The isolates were propagated through Vero-E6 cells (ATCC) in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FCS (GIBCO) and 100 units/mL penicillin plus 100 μg/mL streptomycin (1% PS). All experiments entailing live SARS-CoV-2 followed the approved standard operating procedures of our Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility ( Yeung et al., 2016 68. Yeung, M.-L. ∙ Yao, Y. ∙ Jia, L. ...

FIV-based shRNA library was produced as described previously ( Yeung et al., 2009 67. Yeung, M.L. ∙ Houzet, L. ∙ Yedavalli, V.S. ... A genome-wide short hairpin RNA screening of jurkat T-cells for human proteins contributing to productive HIV-1 replication J. Biol.

Human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is an IFN-γ-inducible entry factor for Enterovirus J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :5163-5177 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 2 μg of the shRNA library in lentiviral constructs (SBI) were co-transfected with 10 μg of the pPACK packaging plasmid mix into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine and Plus reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher). At 48 h after transfection, conditioned culture media were collected to harvest the packaged viruses. In parallel, GFP-packaged viruses were produced. The infectivity of the viruses was established based on the percentage of the GFP-transduced HK-2 cells. Four days after transduction, the cells were selected for 3 weeks in a growth medium containing 3 μg/mL of puromycin. The shRNA-transduced HK-2 cells were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 1). Three days after infection when CPE of the SARS-CoV-2-infected GFP-transduced HK-2 cells reached over 90%, the shRNA-transduced HK-2 cells were recovered by replenishing with DMEM/F12 (GIBCO) containing 10% (v/v) of FBS (GIBCO). After 24 h, the survived shRNA-transduced HK-2 cells were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 using the same infection conditions. At day 3 post-infection, total RNA of the shRNA-transduced HK-2 cells was harvested using TRIzol (ThermoFisher). Seven micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNAs in the presence of 10 μM of GNF primer (5′-ATTTATTGTATCTGTGGGAGCCTC-3′), 100 mM of dithiothreitol, 10 mM of each dNTP, 1 μM reverse transcriptase buffer, and 200 U of SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 50°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at 72°C for 5 min. Half of the reaction mixture was then transferred to a tube containing 1 × PCR reaction buffer, 20 mM of dNTP, 20 μM of Fwd GNF primer (5′-TGCATGTCGCTATGTGTTCTGGGA-3′), 20 μM of Rev GNF primer (5′-ACAAAGCACTGGAAGCTATCGAA-3′), and iProof (Bio-rad). PCR amplification of the shRNA target region was performed under the following conditions: Step 1:94°C for 4 min; Step 2: 94°C for 30 s and then 68°C for 1 min; Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for 20 cycles; Step 4: 68°C for 3 min. Nested PCR reactions using 1 μL of the 1 st round PCR products were performed using 100 μM of H1 Forward primer (5′-GTTCTGTATGAGACCACTTGGATCC-3′), 100 μM of RevPrimer (5′-AAAGAATGCTTATGGACGCTAGAA-3′), and iProof (Bio-Rad). PCR amplification of the shRNA target region was performed under the following conditions: Step 1:94°C for 2 min, 50°C for 2 min and then 68°C for 1 min; Step 2: 94°C for 30 s and then 68°C for 30 s; Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for 18 cycles; Step 4: 68°C for 3 min. The PCR products were then gel purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. The purified PCR products were then submitted to Centre for PanorOmic Sciences at HKU for high-throughput sequencing.
For independent validation, siRNAs (Human ON-TARGETplus) were purchased from ThermoFisher. These siRNAs were transfected into the HK-2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 1). At day 3 post-infection, total RNA of the shRNA-transduced HK-2 cells were harvested as described above.
All samples for high-throughput sequencing were processed by the Centre for PanorOmic Sciences at HKU. Briefly, libraries of each sample were prepared by KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Fifty nanograms of each library was then first purified by AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) before end-repairing. Next, the 3′ end of the libraries were ligated to adaptors using xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters (IDT) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The adaptor-ligated libraries were then validated by Agilent Bioanalzyer, Qubit, and qPCR for quality control analysis. Then, the adaptor-ligated libraries were sequenced using NovaSeq 6000 (2 × 150 bp paired-end reads) System (Illumina). The dataset of the shRNA screening results has been deposited in NCBI with GEO accession number: GSE159272 . The sequencing throughput and a summary of the read counts are available in Table S2 (see also Figure S5 ).
The median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per mL was determined for SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells as previously described ( Yeung et al., 2018 69. Yeung, M.L. ∙ Jia, L. ∙ Yip, C.C.Y. ... Human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is an IFN-γ-inducible entry factor for Enterovirus J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :5163-5177 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 4 cells/well in 150 μL of DMEM. The virus was serially diluted by half-log from 10 3 to 10 14 in DMEM. One hundred microliters of each dilution were added per well; and the plates were observed daily for CPE for five consecutive days.
Vero-E6, HK-2, 293T, and Caco-2 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 1 × PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After 1 h blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature, the cells were stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (developed by our group), anti-FLAG (Sigma) and/or with anti-ACE2 antibodies (R&D systems) for 1 h at room temperature as we previously described ( Yeung et al., 2008 66. Yeung, M.L. ∙ Yasunaga, J. ∙ Bennasser, Y. ... Roles for microRNAs, miR-93 and miR-130b, and tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1 tumor suppressor in cell growth dysregulation by human T-cell lymphotrophic virus 1 Cancer Res. 2008; 68 :8976-8985 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unbound antibodies were washed away six times with 1 × PBS. Positively stained cells were detected by secondary IgG (H+L) antibodies conjugated either with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technology) for 30 min at room temperature. Following six 1 × PBS washes, the stained cells were mounted onto glass slides with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Lab) and examined with a Leica TCS-NT microscope (Leica Microsystem) or a LSM700 confocal microscope (Zeiss).
Total RNAs and viral RNAs were isolated using TRIzol (ThermoFisher) and Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN), respectively, as described in our previous literature ( Yeung et al., 2016 68. Yeung, M.-L. ∙ Yao, Y. ∙ Jia, L. ... MERS coronavirus induces apoptosis in kidney and lung by upregulating Smad7 and FGF2 Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16004 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar )[REMOVED HYPERLINK FIELD].[REMOVED HYPERLINK FIELD] Following RNA quantification, one microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV was performed using primers 5′-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3′ and 5′-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3′ targeting E gene of SARS-CoV-2 as described by WHO and by Novel Coronavirus 2012 Real-Time RT-PCR assay (CDC; Catalog # KT0136), respectively. Sample normalization was done by quantifying their respective housekeeping gene expression using primers 5′-TCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCA-3′ (GAPDH). For each reaction, equal amounts of cDNA were mixed with FS Universal SYBR Green Master Rox (Roche) plus 5pmol each of forward and reverse primers. Amplification was carried out at 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min for 55 cycles in a 7900 real-time PCR detection system (ABI).
Cell lysates or tissue extracts were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane by electroblotting (Hoefer) at constant current of 150mA overnight. Detection of antigens was performed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (developed by our group) or anti-hACE2 antibodies (R&D systems) as previously described ( Yeung et al., 2016 68. Yeung, M.-L. ∙ Yao, Y. ∙ Jia, L. ... MERS coronavirus induces apoptosis in kidney and lung by upregulating Smad7 and FGF2 Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16004 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). As loading controls, the membranes were stripped with Restore western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) before reprobing with anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma).
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S proteins (Sino Biological) were incubated with protein lysates expressing V5-tagged or untagged ACE2 and FLAG-tagged vasopressin under previously described conditions ( Yeung et al., 2018 69. Yeung, M.L. ∙ Jia, L. ∙ Yip, C.C.Y. ... Human tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase is an IFN-γ-inducible entry factor for Enterovirus J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :5163-5177 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modifications: both recombinant S and the protein lysates were mixed in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20 at 4°C overnight with shaking. The next day, the anti-FLAG® M2 affinity agarose gel (Sigma) or anti-V5 agarose affinity gel (Sigma) was added into the mixture and allowed to incubate for an additional 2.5 h. Following six washes with a buffer containing 50 mM of NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM of NaCl, and 20 mM of imidazole pH 8.0, agarose-bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and detected by WB analyses using anti-S (Abcam), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-ACE2 (Abcam) antibodies.
The CPEs of unfixed, unstained, infected cells were measured using an optical microscope, with the condenser down and the iris diaphragm partly closed as described in “Cytopathic Effects of Viruses Protocols,” by Sushman E and Blair C (ASM Microbe Library. American Society for Microbiology. Archived from the original on June 2, 2012. Retrieved 20 November 2014). We consider total detachment of the monolayer cell as 100%. To determine the percentage of CPE, Vero-E6, HK-2, and Caco-2 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a virus titer of MOI = 1. The virus induced CPEs were monitored daily.
High-throughput sequencing raw reads were processed with Cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 41. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet Journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) removing constant lentivirus vector and hair-pin loop nucleotide sequences. Resulting sequences were then filtered to contain only the anti-sense shRNA arms ranging from 15 to 40 bp, which were representative of the shRNA sequences. The shRNA sequences were then aligned to human reference genome (GENCODE GRCh38) using Bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 37. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (32356) PubMed Google Scholar ). Subsequently, the number of reads mapping to shRNA probes and shRNA target genes were counted using HTSeq ( Anders et al., 2015 1. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13076) PubMed Google Scholar ). The shRNA probes and shRNA target genes were generated by retrieving unique and properly paired alignments to non-overlapping genomic locations with a mapping quality over 15, following by target gene annotation (GENCODE GRCh38 annotation v24). Finally, shRNA counts were median-normalized and analyzed with DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 39. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (45383) PubMed Google Scholar ) to infer changes between samples and to evaluate statistical significance. Next, we adjusted the gene counts of raw reads within each treatment group by median normalization. For each treatment group, the gene counts with missing values from individual replicates were removed. The resulting datasets were subjected to clustering analyses, including principal components analysis (PCA), volcano plot, and heatmap hierarchical clustering analysis, using the stat function in R, ggplot2 function in R, and Complex Heatmap, respectively ( Gu et al., 2016 22. Gu, Z. ∙ Eils, R. ∙ Schlesner, M. Complex heatmaps reveal patterns and correlations in multidimensional genomic data Bioinformatics. 2016; 32 :2847-2849 Crossref Scopus (4415) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ito and Murphy, 2013 33. Ito, K. ∙ Murphy, D. Application of ggplot2 to Pharmacometric Graphics CPT Pharmacometrics Syst. Pharmacol. 2013; 2 :e79 Crossref Scopus (468) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The average of the adjusted gene counts from SARS-CoV-2-infected samples was compared with that of the mock-infected samples. Fold changes of gene counts between the SARS-CoV-2-infected samples and the mock-infected samples were generated with counts from replicates higher than 100. GO enrichment analysis was performed on 3-fold enriched genes using DAVID GO Cellular Component using default parameters with p < 0.05 ( Huang et al., 2007 30. Huang, D.W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Tan, Q. ... DAVID Bioinformatics Resources: expanded annotation database and novel algorithms to better extract biology from large gene lists Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W169-W175 Crossref Scopus (1666) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, molecular pathway analysis was conducted by analyzing the enriched VDFs into PANTHER (Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships) using the FISHER test type ( Mi et al., 2019 44. Mi, H. ∙ Muruganujan, A. ∙ Ebert, D. ... PANTHER version 14: more genomes, a new PANTHER GO-slim and improvements in enrichment analysis tools Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D419-D426 Crossref Scopus (1823) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To generate the coronavirus life cycle map, relevant genes reported from different database: UniProt ( Bairoch et al., 2005 4. Bairoch, A. ∙ Apweiler, R. ∙ Wu, C.H. ... The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :D154-D159 Crossref Scopus (1480) PubMed Google Scholar ), Gene Ontology ( Ashburner et al., 2000 2. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ..., The Gene Ontology Consortium Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (30128) PubMed Google Scholar ), NCBI Reference Sequence ( Pruitt et al., 2005 49. Pruitt, K.D. ∙ Tatusova, T. ∙ Maglott, D.R. NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq): a curated non-redundant sequence database of genomes, transcripts and proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :D501-D504 Crossref Scopus (1416) PubMed Google Scholar ), NCBI OMIM database ( McKusick, 2007 43. McKusick, V.A. Mendelian Inheritance in Man and its online version, OMIM Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 80 :588-604 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (546) PubMed Google Scholar ) and BioGRID ( Oughtred et al., 2019 46. Oughtred, R. ∙ Stark, C. ∙ Breitkreutz, B.J. ... The BioGRID interaction database: 2019 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D529-D541 Crossref Scopus (881) PubMed Google Scholar ) were obtained. Text mining of the genes properties, including biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, were analyzed using PubMed query via iHop ( Hoffmann and Valencia, 2004 28. Hoffmann, R. ∙ Valencia, A. A gene network for navigating the literature Nat. Genet. 2004; 36 :664 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). The information was summarized and integrated into a database framework to form a schematized coronavirus viral life cycle. Newly discovered VDFs were added manually into this framework according to the cellular functions inferred from literature curation and database review. All SARS-CoV-2 VDFs identified in this study are available in Table S1 .
Statistical significance was determined as p < 0.05 using GraphPad Prism 8 unless otherwise indicated. Experiments were analyzed by unpaired two-tailed t tests.
