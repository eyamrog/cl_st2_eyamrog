Title: Germinal center responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in healthy and immunocompromised individuals


Abstract: Summary

Vaccine-mediated immunity often relies on the generation of protective antibodies and memory B cells, which commonly stem from germinal center (GC) reactions. An in-depth comparison of the GC responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in healthy and immunocompromised individuals has not yet been performed due to the challenge of directly probing human lymph nodes. Herein, through a fine-needle aspiration-based approach, we profiled the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in lymph nodes of healthy individuals and kidney transplant recipients (KTXs). We found that, unlike healthy subjects, KTXs presented deeply blunted SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses coupled with severely hindered T follicular helper cell, SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain-specific memory B cell, and neutralizing antibody responses. KTXs also displayed reduced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell frequencies. Broadly, these data indicate impaired GC-derived immunity in immunocompromised individuals and suggest a GC origin for certain humoral and memory B cell responses following mRNA vaccination.

This vaccine platform was first licensed for human use during the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ( Bettini and Locci, 2021 15. Bettini, E. ∙ Locci, M.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development Nature. 2020; 586 :516-527 Crossref Scopus (1363) PubMed Google Scholar ), and much still needs to be learned about the quality of the immune responses elicited by mRNA vaccines.
Most vaccines confer protection by eliciting antigen-specific antibodies (Abs) and memory B cells (MBCs) ( Plotkin, 2010 72. Plotkin, S.A. Correlates of protection induced by Vaccination Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17 :1055-1065 Crossref Scopus (1223) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sallusto et al., 2010 80. Sallusto, F. ∙ Lanzavecchia, A. ∙ Araki, K. ... From vaccines to memory and back Immunity. 2010; 33 :451-463 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (459) PubMed Google Scholar ). Abs are secreted by plasma cells and can potentially neutralize pathogens and prevent infections. Equally important are MBCs that act as a second line of defense and give rise to a quick burst of Ab-secreting plasma cells if the pathogens break through the “protective wall” of the pre-existing Abs. Plasma cells and MBCs are commonly generated during germinal center (GC) reactions ( Allen et al., 2007 3. Allen, C.D.C. ∙ Okada, T. ∙ Cyster, J.G.

Germinal center B cell dynamics Immunity. 2016; 45 :471-482 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (643) PubMed Google Scholar ) in vaccine-draining lymph nodes (LNs). In GCs, activated B cells first undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) in their immunoglobulin genes. Next, the high-affinity GC B cell clones resulting from the SHM process are positively selected and ultimately differentiate into long-lived plasma cells and MBCs. GC reactions are orchestrated by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, specialized CD4 T cells that deliver a variety of signals shaping the fate of GC B cells ( Crotty, 2019 26. Crotty, S.

We and others have previously demonstrated that in mice, mRNA vaccines elicit potent GC responses closely intertwined with an efficient induction of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing (nAbs) and MBCs ( Lederer et al., 2020 51.

In line with these data, studies characterizing the immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in humans found a robust generation of nAbs and MBCs ( Bettini and Locci, 2021 15.

However, with only one exception ( Turner et al., 2021 91. Turner, J.S. ∙ O’Halloran, J.A. ∙ Kalaidina, E. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses Nature. 2021; 596 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ), all published human vaccine studies focused on the analysis of the immune responses measurable in peripheral blood. Hence, a thorough evaluation of the GC reactions driven by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in humans, including their connection with nAbs and MBCs, is still missing.
Another question that warrants further investigation is whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines can promote high-quality immune responses in individuals lacking a fully functional immune system, such as solid organ transplant recipients (SOTs). Immunosuppressant (IS) drugs administered to SOTs can cause a global immune system dysfunction spanning from defective antigen-presenting cell differentiation, maturation, and migration ( Chen et al., 2004 23.

Furthermore, IS drugs might directly affect the magnitude and quality of B cell responses ( Eickenberg et al., 2012 30. Eickenberg, S. ∙ Mickholz, E. ∙ Jung, E. ...

Analyses of blood samples from SOTs after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has yielded mixed results ( Benotmane et al., 2021 12. Benotmane, I. ∙ Gautier, G. ∙ Perrin, P. ...

Immunol. 2021; 6 :eabj1031 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Some studies suggested that a fraction of SOTs can generate detectable SARS-CoV-2-binding Ab titers, whereas others indicated that SOTs completely fail to produce B cell responses and Abs to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. A common denominator, however, is the heavily curtailed nAb production in SOTs following immunization. Although the evidence from studies conducted with blood samples hints at crippled GC formation, the exploration of GC responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in SOTs remains uncharted territory.
Herein, by deploying a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) approach ( Havenar-Daughton et al., 2020 64. Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Newton, I.G. ∙ Zare, S.Y. ... Normal human lymph node T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells accessed via fine needle aspirations J. Immunol. Methods. 2020; 479 :112746 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), we evaluated the GC responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in draining LNs of healthy donors (HDs) and kidney transplant recipients (KTXs) and assessed their connection to humoral and MBC responses. Our study uncovered a potent elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike (Full S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific GC B cells localized in vaccine-draining LNs upon primary immunization of healthy individuals, which was further enhanced by a second vaccine dose. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses were associated with a robust induction of Tfh cells, class-switched RBD-specific MBCs and nAbs. These findings were in stark contrast to a profound impairment of the GC responses in KTXs, which was coupled to a nearly abolished RBD-specific memory B cell response and nAb formation, and opposed to a measurable generation of class-switched S-specific MBCs binding Full S outside the RBD region. Overall, this study shows that in individuals with an intact immune system, class-switched RBD-specific MBCs and nAbs are induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and might have a GC origin. Conversely, these responses are not efficiently generated following vaccination in individuals receiving IS drugs. This work has important implications for guiding future studies aimed at unraveling human immune responses after vaccination and for supporting the decision to perform additional booster immunizations against SARS-CoV-2 in people with a compromised immune system.

Section: Results

GC B cells and Tfh cells are only present in lymphoid tissues and cannot be studied in blood ( Vella et al., 2019 95. Vella, L.A. ∙ Buggert, M. ∙ Manne, S. ... T follicular helper cells in human efferent lymph retain lymphoid characteristics J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3185-3200 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, we conducted a human study where lymphoid tissue immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were probed in healthy individuals via FNA. The FNA approach has been successfully used to track GC B cell responses to vaccination in humans ( Havenar-Daughton et al., 2020 64. Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Newton, I.G. ∙ Zare, S.Y. ...

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses Nature. 2021; 596 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). In total, 15 HDs (23–76 years old) were enrolled in this study prior to vaccination with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 ( Table S1 ). FNA samples were collected two weeks after the first immunization (V2: day 14+/−2) and eight days after the second immunization (V3: day 8+/−2) ( Figure 1 A). Matched blood samples were also obtained at the same time points and before vaccination (V1). Axillary draining LNs from the same arm where the vaccines were administered were visualized by ultrasound to guide the FNA procedure ( Figure 1 B). In HDs, the number of live cells recovered from FNAs ranged from 0.3 to 40 × 10 6 cells. A 23-parameter flow cytometry assay was performed on FNA samples to profile the immune responses induced by vaccination. GC B cells were defined as class-switched B cells co-expressing CD38, low-intermediate levels of CD27 and BCL6 ( Figure 1 C and S1 A). Pre-pandemic tonsil samples, which are highly enriched in GCs, and putative quiescent cadaveric LNs from SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination elicited detectable GC B cell responses after primary immunization, which were further enhanced by the booster vaccination ( Figure 1 C). The increase in GC B cell frequencies was measurable when the responses were evaluated following a paired (11 individuals) or an orthogonal (15 individuals) analysis approach ( Figures 1 D and S1 B). No correlation between age and GC B cell frequencies was observed ( Figure S1 C). Next, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells were stratified into those binding fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 Full S tetrameric probes within (Full S + RBD + ) or outside (Full S + RBD − ) of the RBD region, while failing to bind an irrelevant tetrameric probe (influenza hemagglutinin, HA) ( Figures 1 E and S1 A). The specificity of the probes is indicated by the lack of Full S- and RBD-specific GC B cells in pre-pandemic tonsils ( Figure 1 E). Overall, a boost in both Full S + RBD − and RBD + GC B cell frequencies following the second vaccine dose was observed ( Figures 1 F and S1 D). Similar to total GC B cells, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells did not correlate with age ( Figure S1 E). Next, to determine if mRNA vaccine-induced GC responses were detectable in nondraining LNs, we collected contralateral axillary LNs, which do not directly drain the mRNA vaccines from the injection site, after the booster immunization (n = 4). When compared with the matched draining (ipsilateral) LNs, the contralateral LNs displayed a trend for lower frequencies of GC B cells ( Figures 1 G and 1H), which were not SARS-CoV-2-specific ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Overall, these data demonstrate that in immunocompetent subjects, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines efficiently elicit antigen-specific GC B cell responses that are enhanced by a booster immunization and localized in the ipsilateral draining LNs.
By enabling the selection of high-affinity GC B cells and curbing the magnitude of GC reactions, Tfh cells modulate affinity maturation in infection and vaccination ( Crotty, 2019 26. Crotty, S. T follicular helper cell biology: A decade of discovery and diseases Immunity. 2019; 50 :1132-1148 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (814) PubMed Google Scholar ). We measured the frequency of GC Tfh cells (referred to as Tfh cells) defined by the signature markers CXCR5 and PD-1 ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). Expression of the lineage-defining transcription factor BCL6 confirmed the identity of this population as Tfh cells ( Figure 2 B). Negligible Tfh cell frequencies were found in quiescent LNs from cadaveric donors ( Figure S2 B) and the contralateral LNs of vaccinees ( Figure 2 A), in contrast to a more abundant Tfh cell presence in tonsils ( Figure S2 B). The frequencies of Tfh cells in ipsilateral LNs of vaccinated HDs had a trend for higher values than that in contralateral LNs (p = 0.056, Figure 2 C) and increased after the second vaccine dose ( Figures 2 D and S2 C). Tfh cells are a functionally heterogenous population that, in humans, is functionally stratified by chemokine receptor expression ( Ueno, 2016 93. Ueno, H. Human circulating T follicular helper cell subsets in health and disease J. Clin. Immunol. 2016; 36 :34-39 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). CXCR3-expressing Tfh cells are Th1-polarized ( Locci et al., 2013 54. Locci, M. ∙ Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Landais, E. ..., International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Protocol C Principal Investigators, Poignard, P., Crotty, S Human circulating PD-1+CXCR3-CXCR5+ memory Tfh cells are highly functional and correlate with broadly neutralizing HIV antibody responses Immunity. 2013; 39 :758-769 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (685) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morita et al., 2011 62.

Human blood CXCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells are counterparts of T follicular cells and contain specific subsets that differentially support antibody secretion Immunity. 2011; 34 :108-121 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ). By contrast, CXCR3 − Tfh cells can be distinguished by CCR6 expression into Th2 (CCR6 − ) and Th17 (CCR6 + )-polarized cells ( Morita et al., 2011 62. Morita, R. ∙ Schmitt, N. ∙ Bentebibel, S.E. ... Human blood CXCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells are counterparts of T follicular cells and contain specific subsets that differentially support antibody secretion Immunity. 2011; 34 :108-121 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1000) PubMed Google Scholar ). CCR4 was also used in this analysis to help refine the delineation of Th2 (CCR6 − CCR4 + )- and Th17 (CCR6 + CCR4 + )-biased cells ( Figure 2 E) ( Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007 1. Acosta-Rodriguez, E.V. ∙ Rivino, L. ∙ Geginat, J. ... Surface phenotype and antigenic specificity of human interleukin 17-producing T helper memory cells Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :639-646 Crossref Scopus (1506) PubMed Google Scholar ). This analysis approach showed that the Tfh cells present in the draining LNs comprised Th1- and Th2-polarized Tfh cells, but not Th17-biased Tfh cells ( Figure 2 F). Of note, draining LN Tfh cells correlated with both Full S + RBD − GC B cells and RBD-specific GC B cells ( Figure 2 G), even when the outlier in the Full S + RBD + GC B cell frequency data set was excluded (data not shown, R=0.6554, p=0.0003765). While bona fide Tfh cells can be found exclusively in secondary lymphoid organs ( Vella et al., 2019 95. Vella, L.A. ∙ Buggert, M. ∙ Manne, S. ... T follicular helper cells in human efferent lymph retain lymphoid characteristics J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3185-3200 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), a small population of circulating activated Tfh cells expressing high levels of ICOS, PD-1, and CD38 has been described in peripheral blood post vaccination ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 13.

The percentages of blood-activated Tfh cells (CD4 + CD45RA − CXCR5 + ICOS hi PD-1 hi ), a large fraction of which also expressed CD38, were significantly increased by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination ( Figures 2 H and S2 D) and did not correlate with bona fide Tfh cells (gated with a similar strategy) in draining LNs ( Figure 2 I). It is worth noting that blood Tfh cells did not correlate with the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells ( Figure S2 E), indicating that, although reflecting the presence of an ongoing GC reaction, they are not accurate biomarkers to estimate bona fide GC B and Tfh cell responses. Hence, GC responses are best studied by direct investigation of vaccine-draining LNs.
As GCs are important for the generation of MBCs, we next evaluated the MBC responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in HDs. Class-switched MBCs were first defined as IgD − IgM − CD38 − CD27 + B cells ( Figures 3 A and S1 A). Since we did not include CD21 or other markers to define MBC activation status, a fraction of the cells that we defined as MBCs might still be activated. SARS-CoV-2 Full S-specific MBCs were stratified into RBD − and RBD + cells ( Figure 3 B), as previously described for GC B cells ( Figure 1 E). Our analyses highlighted the generation of class-switched Full S- and RBD-specific MBCs after the first vaccine dose, which was significantly higher after a second mRNA vaccine dose ( Figures 3 C and S3 A). Class-switched SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs were also detectable at low frequencies in PBMC samples after two immunizations ( Figure S3 B). Only S-specific RBD − MBCs in peripheral blood correlated with the respective SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC population in FNAs ( Figure S3 C), whereas RBD-specific MBCs did not. Low frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific non-class-switched IgM + MBCs were also present in LNs and blood and did not show a uniform increase across different locations after a second vaccine dose ( Figures S3 D and S3E). A population of IgD − IgM − CD38 hi CD20 lo/- CD27 + BCL6 - plasmablasts ( Figure S3 F) was more abundant after the second immunization ( Figure 3 D) and was also detectable at variable levels in peripheral blood samples of vaccinated HDs ( Figure S3 G). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific plasmablasts were also increased in the draining LNs and blood after the second immunization ( Figures 3 E and 3F and S3 H). However, no correlation was found between the total or SARS-CoV-2-specific plasmablast populations detected in FNA and blood samples ( Figures S3 I and S3J). In sum, the data obtained in our study indicate that two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines can elicit SARS-CoV-2 S- and RBD-specific MBCs as well as a population of plasmablasts in draining LNs.
To determine the capacity of immunocompromised individuals to form GC responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, 13 KTXs were enrolled. Due to withdrawal of consent (n = 1), failure to undergo collection procedures (n = 1), and lack of sufficient cells (n = 1), 10 patients who were a median 80 days post-transplant (range −9–1,894 days) were included in further analysis ( Table S1 ). One KTX was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 (shown as gray square symbol). The KTXs in our cohort presented normal Ab responses established prior to transplantation, including normal levels of antigen-specific IgG induced by tetanus toxoid (TT), mumps, rubella, and measles-containing vaccines ( Figures S4 A–S4D). Similarly, most KTXs tested also presented detectable levels of anti-CMV (10/13) and anti-EBV (13/13) IgGs ( Table S2 ).
After administration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, the FNA cell recovery yield was scarcer in KTXs ( Figure S4 E), making immunophenotyping feasible in this group only at certain time points. The class-switched B cell populations captured by our 23-color flow cytometry analysis were visualized by a dimensionality-reduction approach ( Figure 4 A). Of note, a large cell population, reminiscent of GC B cells (CD38 + CD27 lo/int BCL6 + ) and present in immunocompetent individuals, was completely lacking in KTXs. A direct evaluation of GC B cell frequencies in KTXs further corroborated this finding and demonstrated a failure of KTXs to form GC B cell responses after one or two immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells induced by vaccination were completely abrogated in the few KTXs recipients who could mount low but detectable GC B cell responses ( Figure 4 D).
We next asked whether the failure to form SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells was associated with impaired MBC responses to the vaccine. SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC frequencies were determined in draining LNs and blood. Unexpectedly, the analysis of FNA samples and PBMCs from KTXs revealed a detectable frequency of class-switched Full S + RBD − MBCs within total B cells after the second immunization as opposed to an almost complete lack of class-switched Full S + RBD + MBCs ( Figures 4 E and S4 F). When analyzed as a frequency of MBCs, however, class-switched Full S + RBD − MBCs were decreased in comparison to HDs ( Figure S4 G). These data, along with KTX-associated lymphopenia ( Tables S1 and S2 ), indicate that KTXs respond to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine by producing detectable yet reduced levels of Full S-specific MBCs targeting regions outside the RBD. Similar to what we observed for class-switched MBCs, IgM + Full S + RBD − but not Full S + RBD + MBCs were also detectable in draining LNs of most donors after the administration of two vaccine doses ( Figure S4 H). These data were only partially confirmed in blood ( Figure S4 I). Interestingly, when HDs and KTXs were analyzed together, a strong correlation was found between lymphoid tissue class-switched RBD-specific MBCs and GC B cells, whereas class-switched Full S + RBD − MBCs and GC B cells only presented a weak correlation ( Figure S4 J). The correlation between class-switched RBD-specific MBCs and GC B cells remained strong after excluding the outlier data point (data not shown, R=0.8360 and p=4.077e-010). Additionally, when only HDs were analyzed, we observed similar correlations between both types of class-switched SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs and GC B cells with the same antigen specificity ( Figure S4 K). Overall, these observations suggest that class-switched RBD-specific MBCs are derived from GC reactions, whereas class-switched Full S + RBD − MBCs could be a mixed population with either GC-dependent or GC-independent origins.
Next, we asked whether the absence of vaccine-induced GC B cell responses in KTXs was connected to altered humoral responses, which were previously reported in a fraction of KTXs ( Benotmane et al., 2021 12. Benotmane, I. ∙ Gautier, G. ∙ Perrin, P. ...

As a first step, we evaluated plasmablast frequencies after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Plasmablast abundance among FNAs was increased after two immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in HDs, whereas KTX plasmablast frequencies were, for the most part, reduced in comparison to HDs ( Figure 4 F). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2-specific plasmablast responses in draining LNs were hindered in KTXs in comparison to HDs after a second vaccine dose ( Figure 4 G). Total and SARS-CoV-2-specific plasmablast responses in HDs and KTXs had less clear trends in blood ( Figures S5 A and S5B). A serological analysis revealed that only 3/8 of the KTXs in our FNA cohort produced Full S- and RBD-specific IgG within the lower range of HDs after two immunizations, whereas the remaining 5/8 of the patients had SARS-CoV-2–binding Abs below the limit of detection ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Similar to previous data in HDs ( Amanat et al., 2021 5. Amanat, F. ∙ Thapa, M. ∙ Lei, T. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces functionally diverse antibodies to NTD, RBD, and S2 Cell. 2021; 184 :3936-3948.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines only modestly boosted the levels of IgG against the seasonal betacoronavirus OC43 in both HDs and KTXs ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination elicited a low yet detectable induction of SARS-CoV-2 Full S- and RBD-specific IgM and IgA in HDs, in line with other published papers ( Turner et al., 2021 91. Turner, J.S. ∙ O’Halloran, J.A. ∙ Kalaidina, E. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses Nature. 2021; 596 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2021a 101. Wang, Z. ∙ Schmidt, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ... mRNA vaccine-elicited antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and circulating variants Nature. 2021; 592 :616-622 Crossref Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, all KTXs presented negligible IgM and IgA production following vaccination ( Figures S5 E and S5F). To shed light on the quality of the Ab responses driven by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in KTXs, we measured SARS-CoV-2 nAbs by pseudotyped lentivirus-based in vitro assays. In these assays, most HD samples collected after two vaccine doses could efficiently neutralize a pseudovirus containing the D614G mutation ( Figure 4 J) and, less efficiently, a pseudovirus containing the mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 beta strain ( Figure 4 K). By contrast, KTXs presented greatly diminished nAbs against D614G-pseudovirus and could not efficiently block the pseudovirus containing the SARS-CoV-2 beta strain mutations. Correlative analysis including all subjects showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific plasmablasts, binding Abs, and nAb titers in response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination were strongly associated with the frequency of Full S + RBD − and Full S + RBD + GC B cells ( Figures S5 G–S5I). Moreover, while bona fide Tfh cells also displayed a positive correlation with nAb levels, blood-activated Tfh cells did not ( Figure S5 J). Overall, our data demonstrate that KTXs cannot mount SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses or efficiently generate RBD-specific MBCs or nAbs after administration of mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, our work points to a possible connection between GC formation, humoral responses, and RBD-specific memory B cell generation in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
Next, we aimed to determine whether KTXs can generate T cell responses to the vaccines. As GC B cell responses were heavily impaired in KTXs, we predicted reduced Tfh cell frequencies in the KTX group. As anticipated, a viSNE analysis of antigen-experienced CXCR5 + CD4 T cells in FNA samples revealed a deep reduction of a cell population expressing the Tfh cell signature markers PD-1, BCL6, and ICOS in the KTX group ( Figure 5 A). Concordantly, a significant reduction of Tfh cells in KTX patients in comparison to HDs also emerged by a direct flow cytometry analysis ( Figures 5 B and 5C).
We then asked whether KTXs are, more broadly, incapable of mounting efficient antigen-specific T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Since a direct evaluation of antigen-specific T cells in vaccine-draining LNs was not feasible due to the paucity and variability in FNA cell recovery, we measured the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood of 11 HDs and 10 KTXs via an activation induced marker (AIM) assay following in vitro stimulation with a SARS-CoV-2 peptide megapool ( Grifoni et al., 2020a 40.

Similar to previous reports ( Apostolidis et al., 2021 8. Apostolidis, S.A. ∙ Kakara, M. ∙ Painter, M.M. ... Altered cellular and humoral immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with multiple sclerosis on anti-CD20 therapy medRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ; Painter et al., 2021 66.

By contrast, we observed a severely reduced induction of antigen-specific CD4 T cells in KTXs after vaccination. Since KTXs might have altered ratios of naive/antigen-experienced CD4 T cells, we also analyzed the AIM + CD4 T cells as frequency of total CD4 T cells, observing a similar attenuation of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in the KTX group compared with HDs ( Figure S6 B). A functional stratification of the AIM + CD4 T cells based on chemokine receptor expression allowed us to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating Tfh cells (CXCR5 + ) and Th1 (CXCR3 + ), Th17 (CCR6 + ), and Th2 (CXCR3 − CCR6 − )-polarized CXCR5 − non-Tfh cells ( Figure 6 C) ( Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007 1.

Immunol. 2009; 10 :864-871 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ). As previously observed, HDs predominantly generate SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating Tfh and Th1-polarized CD4 T cells in response to the mRNA vaccines ( Figures 6 C and 6D) ( Apostolidis et al., 2021 8. Apostolidis, S.A. ∙ Kakara, M. ∙ Painter, M.M. ...

Of note, the SARS-CoV-2-specific circulating Tfh cells detected in HDs via the AIM assay presented a mixed Th1/Th2 functional polarization ( Figure 6 E), similar to what was observed in bona fide Tfh cells ( Figure 2 F). We did not observe alterations in the functional polarization of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in KTXs ( Figures S6 C and S6D), although the small numbers of AIM + CD4 T cells prevented definitive conclusions. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells, defined either as CD8 T cells co-expressing 41BB and IFNγ or expressing 3 of 5 AIM markers used in our panel, were variable in frequency but detectable in most HDs above pre-vaccine baseline levels ( Figures 6 F–6H and S6 E and S6F). In contrast, most KTXs did not present detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells, resulting in significantly reduced responses compared with HDs ( Figures 6 F–6H and S6 E and S6F). As opposed to the altered antigen-specific T cell responses, similar frequencies of total (non-antigen-specific) CD4 T cell subsets were found across all time points in both HDs and KTXs ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Although lower naive CD4 T cell frequencies could partially account for the defective CD4 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, this did not appear to be the case for CD8 T cells, whose naive counterpart was grossly normal ( Figures S6 I and S6J). Altogether, these data point to severely decreased SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in KTXs after two immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.
Next, we asked if KTXs failed to generate SARS-CoV-2-specific GC responses after a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Blood samples were collected before (V4) and after (V5) the administration of a third vaccine dose in 3/9 KTXs originally enrolled in the FNA study and in one newly enrolled KTX subject ( Figure 7 A). FNAs were performed on these patients at V5. In line with previous data, 3/4 KTXs presented negligible total and SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell frequencies after this additional booster immunization ( Figures 7 B–7E). While the remaining KTX had a detectable GC B cell population, most GC B cells were not able to bind the Full S and RBD probes. Tfh cell frequencies after the third immunization mostly mirrored total GC B cell frequencies ( Figures 7 F and 7G). Of note, an additional dose of the mRNA vaccines resulted in a trend for increased percentages of class-switched Full S + RBD − but not Full S + RBD + MBCs in the KTX group ( Figures 7 H and 7I), indicating that the Full S + RBD − memory B cell population is responsive to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. SARS-CoV-2–binding and SARS-CoV-2–neutralizing Abs were also measured before and after this additional booster dose on the 3 KTXs that were originally part of the FNA study cohort. All KTXs tested displayed a trend for mildly increased Full S binding IgG responses at V5 ( Figure 7 J). By contrast, only 1/3 KTX (Donor 014), which already presented some RBD-binding IgG and nAbs at V3, had detectable levels of RBD-binding IgG ( Figure 7 K) and nAbs against a pseudovirus carrying the D614G or the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 beta variant ( Figures 7 L and 7M). Overall, these data suggest that while most KTXs lack the ability of mounting GC responses to additional booster doses of mRNA vaccines, they all present variable but trending increased Full S binding IgG levels and class-switched Full S + RBD − memory B cell frequencies after a third vaccine dose.

Section: Discussion

mRNA vaccines are a novel vaccine platform that has only been recently approved for human use during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although it is emerging that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines are highly efficient at inducing robust nAbs and MBC responses, a fundamental open question is whether nAb and MBC generation during SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is connected to the formation of GCs, microanatomical structures canonically harboring the generation of affinity matured Ab-secreting cells and certain MBCs. The study of vaccine-induced GC reactions in humans is heavily constrained when blood, the most easily obtainable human material, is the only available sample because bona fide GC B cells and Tfh cells are only present in secondary lymphoid organs ( Vella et al., 2019 95. Vella, L.A. ∙ Buggert, M. ∙ Manne, S. ... T follicular helper cells in human efferent lymph retain lymphoid characteristics J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3185-3200 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). Surrogate biomarkers such as blood CXCL13 and circulating activated Tfh cells have been used thus far to predict the magnitude of ongoing GC responses ( Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016 42. Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Lindqvist, M. ∙ Heit, A. ... CXCL13 is a plasma biomarker of germinal center activity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :2702-2707 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vella et al., 2019 95. Vella, L.A. ∙ Buggert, M. ∙ Manne, S. ... T follicular helper cells in human efferent lymph retain lymphoid characteristics J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :3185-3200 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these biomarkers present significant shortcomings when trying to directly assay GC responses. They are traceable for only short windows of time, are not detectable in all individuals, and have not been successfully used to predict broad qualitative aspects of GC reactions, such as the antigen specificity of GC B cells and their connection to GC-derived B cell responses ( Bentebibel et al., 2013 13. Bentebibel, S.E. ∙ Lopez, S. ∙ Obermoser, G. ... Induction of ICOS+CXCR3+CXCR5+ TH cells correlates with antibody responses to influenza vaccination Sci. Transl.

CXCL13 is a plasma biomarker of germinal center activity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :2702-2707 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). These limitations emphasize the need for directly probing GC responses by adopting minimally invasive approaches, such as FNA, that allow longitudinal sampling of the vaccine-draining LNs. Only two peer-reviewed studies have ever described human GC responses to vaccination (against influenza or SARS-CoV-2) in humans by using FNA ( Turner et al., 2020 92. Turner, J.S. ∙ Zhou, J.Q. ∙ Han, J. ... Human germinal centres engage memory and naive B cells after influenza vaccination Nature. 2020; 586 :127-132 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar , 2021 91.

SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses Nature. 2021; 596 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). One study ( Turner et al., 2021 91. Turner, J.S. ∙ O’Halloran, J.A. ∙ Kalaidina, E. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses Nature. 2021; 596 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ) reported S-specific GC B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in LNs but did not investigate the generation of RBD-specific GC B cells or the connection between SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells and Tfh cells, nAbs, and SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs. Our study sought to address these open questions and revealed that these vaccines prompted the formation of robust Full S- and RBD-specific GC B cell and Tfh cell responses localized in draining axillary LNs. Importantly, our study revealed that SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell populations were strongly associated with the ability to produce SARS-CoV-2 nAbs, as further supported by the evidence that immunosuppressed individuals, who cannot form GCs, presented deeply blunted nAb production. Although to a lower degree, we also found that bona fide Tfh cells in draining LNs correlated with nAb production, whereas activated Tfh cells in blood were a less reliable predictor of nAb generation. Additionally, in our study, GC formation appeared to be tightly connected with the capacity to produce class-switched RBD-specific MBCs. These findings provide valuable insights on the otherwise poorly understood processes by which nAbs and MBCs are formed in humans after immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs, including nAbs, play a key role in the protection against COVID-19, in animal models ( McMahan et al., 2021 58. McMahan, K. ∙ Yu, J. ∙ Mercado, N.B. ...

The strong association between SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells and nAbs reported by our study, which recapitulates our previous observation in mice ( Lederer et al., 2020 51. Lederer, K. ∙ Castaño, D. ∙ Atria, D.G. ...

However, despite robust evidence that affinity maturation (hence GC responses) can occur in COVID-19 convalescent patients after infection ( Muecksch et al., 2021 63. Muecksch, F. ∙ Weisblum, Y. ∙ Barnes, C.O. ...

Analysis of a SARS-CoV-2-infected individual reveals development of potent neutralizing antibodies with limited somatic mutation Immunity. 2020; 53 :98-105.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (244) PubMed Google Scholar ). The low degree of SHM of these Abs is suggestive of a limited GC process involved in their generation. Similarly, Tfh cell-deficient mice, which form negligible GCs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, mounted a decreased yet detectable production of nAbs ( Chen et al., 2021 22. Chen, J.S. ∙ Chow, R.D. ∙ Song, E. ... High-affinity, neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can be made in the absence of T follicular helper cells bioRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar ). Overall, these data indicate that GCs might not be necessary to generate nAbs in response to infection. This apparently discordant outcome might stem from a combination of diverse factors, including a different pool of germline B cells recruited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination not recruited during natural infection. Both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines encode for a prefusion stabilized version of the Full S protein ( Wrapp et al., 2020 103. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), which induces nAbs that bind more broadly across the RBD in comparison to infection-induced nAbs ( Greaney et al., 2021 38. Greaney, A.J. ∙ Loes, A.N. ∙ Gentles, L.E. ... Antibodies elicited by mRNA-1273 vaccination bind more broadly to the receptor binding domain than do those from SARS-CoV-2 infection Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 :eabi9915 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that additional/alternative germline precursors of the nAb secreting cells are recruited by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. It is tempting to speculate that some of these nAb precursors require GC reactions to produce high-affinity nAbs, as supported by the high levels of SHM in mRNA vaccine-induced plasmablasts ( Amanat et al., 2021 5. Amanat, F. ∙ Thapa, M. ∙ Lei, T. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination induces functionally diverse antibodies to NTD, RBD, and S2 Cell. 2021; 184 :3936-3948.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). As an alternative explanation for the GC-nAb connection, the mRNA vaccine platform might favor the formation of GC-derived nAbs—thanks to its strong pro-GC activity. We and others have shown that the mRNA vaccines are very effective at inducing GC reactions in animal models ( Lederer et al., 2020 51. Lederer, K. ∙ Castaño, D. ∙ Atria, D.G. ...

Lipid nanoparticles enhance the efficacy of mRNA and protein subunit vaccines by inducing robust T follicular helper cell and humoral responses Immunity. 2021; 54 :2877-2892.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). The present study, along with published work ( Turner et al., 2021 91. Turner, J.S. ∙ O’Halloran, J.A. ∙ Kalaidina, E. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce persistent human germinal centre responses Nature. 2021; 596 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ), further extend our earlier observation ( Lederer et al., 2020 51. Lederer, K. ∙ Castaño, D. ∙ Atria, D.G. ... SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines foster potent antigen-specific germinal center responses associated with neutralizing antibody generation Immunity. 2020; 53 :1281-1295.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ) by directly showing the formation of SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cells in humans after mRNA vaccination. Hence, by eliciting effective GC responses and/or potentially recruiting nAb precursors that can seed GCs, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines might mechanistically rely on GC responses to effectively generate nAbs.
The second part of our study was aimed at evaluating the GC responses in KTXs and their association with humoral and MBC responses, as no study has ever evaluated B cell responses in vaccine-draining lymphoid tissue of immunocompromised individuals. In agreement with studies reporting that a fraction of KTXs can produce SARS-CoV-2–binding Abs after two immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA ( Benotmane et al., 2021 12.

Of note, in KTXs, we also found reduced, yet detectable, vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific MBCs targeting the Full S protein outside the RBD region. Nonetheless, we reported a complete failure of KTXs in forming SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses after the administration of two mRNA vaccine doses. This finding was accompanied by a markedly diminished generation of RBD-specific MBCs and SARS-CoV-2 nAbs, suggesting that a defective GC formation to mRNA vaccination could be the underlying culprit. Given their suboptimal B cell responses following vaccination, an important question is whether mRNA vaccines are capable of eliciting T cell responses in KTXs. In immunocompetent subjects, the licensed mRNA vaccines predominantly promote the formation of circulating blood Tfh cells and Th1-polarized CD4 T cells ( Painter et al., 2021 66. Painter, M.M. ∙ Mathew, D. ∙ Goel, R.R. ... Rapid induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells is associated with coordinated humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination Immunity. 2021; 54 :2133-2142.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). KTXs were almost completely deprived of lymph node Tfh cells after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, which is consistent with the lack of GC B cell formation in these patients. In line with other studies ( Sattler et al., 2021 81. Sattler, A. ∙ Schrezenmeier, E. ∙ Weber, U.A. ... Impaired humoral and cellular immunity after SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (Tozinameran) prime-boost vaccination in kidney transplant recipients J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131 :e150175 Crossref Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stumpf et al., 2021 87. Stumpf, J. ∙ Siepmann, T. ∙ Lindner, T. ...

Overall, our study indicates that while some residual immune response is obtainable by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, B and T cell responses appear to be quantitatively and qualitatively curtailed in KTXs after two mRNA vaccine doses. Since a third vaccine dose can significantly boost SARS-CoV-2 binding Abs and nAbs in some SOTs ( Hall et al., 2021 41. Hall, V.G. ∙ Ferreira, V.H. ∙ Ku, T. ...

Safety and cross-variant immunogenicity of a three-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccine regimen in kidney transplant recipients EBioMedicine. 2021; 73 :103679 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), we assessed the immune responses to an additional injection of mRNA vaccines in a small number of KTXs. This third vaccine dose did not induce GC B cell responses in 3/4 KTXs evaluated. However, it was accompanied by an upward trend in Full S-specific IgG levels and class-switched Full S + RBD − MBC frequencies, which varied in magnitude. Although it will be important to further corroborate these finding in larger follow-up studies, these data hint at the possibility that additional booster immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines target and expand, in most KTXs, a small pool of Full S + RBD − MBCs rather than promoting the de novo generation of Abs via GC reactions.
Suboptimal vaccine responses in organ transplant subjects receiving IS drugs were previously reported for other vaccines including influenza A/H1N1 and Hepatitis B ( Brakemeier et al., 2012 18. Brakemeier, S. ∙ Schweiger, B. ∙ Lachmann, N. ... Immune response to an adjuvanted influenza A H1N1 vaccine (Pandemrix(®)) in renal transplant recipients Nephrol. Dial.

Comparing humoral and cellular immune response Against HBV vaccine in kidney transplant patients Am. J. Transplant. 2015; 15 :3157-3165 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Collectively, these studies reported impaired Ab production post vaccination. The heavily diminished induction of GC B cells, MBCs, and nAbs in KTXs observed in this study might result from the lack of adequate T cell help and by intrinsic B cell dysfunction caused by IS drugs. KTXs in this study uniformly received ATG to induce T cell depletion at the time of kidney transplantation (completed within a week) ( Mohty, 2007 61. Mohty, M. Mechanisms of action of antithymocyte globulin: T-cell depletion and beyond Leukemia. 2007; 21 :1387-1394 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, an incomplete reconstitution of the T cell pool might at least partially explain the hampered Tfh and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in KTXs, as potentially indicated by their lymphopenic status and deeply blunted frequencies of naive CD4 T cells. Additionally, maintenance immunosuppression is comprised of prednisone, a calcineurin inhibitor, and an antimetabolite, which have been shown to broadly dampen TCR signaling and T cell metabolism, expansion, and/or function ( Flanagan et al., 1991 33.

Knowledge of the impact of the IS on Tfh cell biology in the GC is still limited, with sporadic evidence suggesting that certain IS such as calcineurin inhibitors might influence the differentiation and function of Tfh cells ( Wallin et al., 2018 98. Wallin, E.F. ∙ Hill, D.L. ∙ Linterman, M.A. ... The calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus specifically suppresses human T follicular helper cells Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1184 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, these findings suggest that the lack of proper Tfh cell differentiation and T cell help to B cells might constitute a major obstacle to the development of effective GC B cell responses in immunosuppressed individuals. Additionally, IS drugs could intrinsically hinder B cell capacity to become activated and initiate GC B cell responses, as suggested by published studies indicating that certain drugs, such as antimetabolites, directly suppress B cell proliferation and plasma cell differentiation ( Eickenberg et al., 2012 30. Eickenberg, S. ∙ Mickholz, E. ∙ Jung, E. ... Mycophenolic acid counteracts B cell proliferation and plasmablast formation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus Arthritis Res. Ther. 2012; 14 :R110 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ; Karnell et al., 2011 47. Karnell, J.L. ∙ Karnell, F.G. ∙ Stephens, G.L. ... Mycophenolic acid differentially impacts B cell function depending on the stage of differentiation J. Immunol. 2011; 187 :3603-3612 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In sum, by directly probing GC responses at their source, we provided an informative perspective on the connection between GC formation and nAb/MBC generation following immunizations with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in healthy and immunocompromised individuals. Broadly, this work will pave the road to future human vaccine studies aimed at untangling the origin of long-lasting, protective immune responses after immunizations with different licensed vaccines.
Due to the challenge of enrolling participants in FNA studies in a timely fashion, the HD and KTX groups in our study were not perfectly matched for ethnicity, age, and gender. Thus far, despite an outstanding SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine efficacy in different demographic groups that could be suggestive of largely comparable immune responses to the vaccine ( Baden et al., 2020 10. Baden, L.R. ∙ Sahly, H.M.E. ∙ Essink, B. ... Efficacy and safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 384 :403-416 Crossref Scopus (6648) PubMed Google Scholar ; Polack et al., 2020 73. Polack, F.P. ∙ Thomas, S.J. ∙ Kitchin, N. ... Safety and efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 383 :2603-2615 Crossref Scopus (9628) PubMed Google Scholar ), a direct comparison of GC responses between demographic groups has not been performed. Although a profound defect in GC responses, such as the one described in the KTX group, is unlikely to be entirely dependent on the variables listed above, larger confirmatory studies with a more balanced control of ethnicity, age, and gender will be important to strengthen our findings.
Another aspect that was not possible to elucidate in our study, due to the paucity of available biospecimens, is whether the Full S + RBD − MBCs that are present in KTXs following SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination are pre-existing MBCs specific for seasonal human coronaviruses. These MBCs could indeed have been generated before the KTXs became immunocompromised and might potentially have some degree of cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein that could lead to their expansion upon repeated administrations of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. Future studies will be needed to determine the origin of these cells as well as the role that they might play in conferring protection from COVID-19.

The prospective cohort study included 15 healthy adults and 15 kidney transplant recipients at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania across both the lymph node and blood samples analyses ( Table S1 ). The healthy donor cohort ranged in age from 23 to 76 years old and was composed of six males and nine females. The KTX recipient cohort ranged in age from 28 to 70 years old and was composed of nine males and six females. All participants received two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines, according to the recommended 3- and 4-week interval, respectively. Most participants received the first and second immunizations in the same arm. Written informed consent for participation was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki and protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania. Lymph node samples were obtained by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration at day 12 (+/- 3 days) after primary immunization and at day 10 (+/- 2 days) after a second immunization. Blood samples were obtained at baseline prior to vaccination (visit 1, V1), day 12 (+/- 3 days) following primary immunization (visit 2, V2), and day 10 (+/- 2 days) following a second immunization (visit 3, V3). In four kidney transplant recipients, blood and FNA samples were also obtained prior to visit 4(V4) and at day 8 (+/- 2 days) (visit 5, V5) following a 3 rd vaccine dose.
Lymph nodes and pediatric tonsils were obtained from the National Disease Resource Interchange (NDRI), and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), respectively.
All fine needle aspirations (FNA) were performed by board-certified radiologists, similar to what previously described ( Havenar-Daughton et al., 2020 64. Havenar-Daughton, C. ∙ Newton, I.G. ∙ Zare, S.Y. ... Normal human lymph node T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells accessed via fine needle aspirations J. Immunol. Methods. 2020; 479 :112746 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a Philips EPIQ ELITE or PHILIPS IU222 ultrasound instrument was used to visualize axillary draining lymph nodes. The area around the lymph node was anesthetized using 2-6mL of 0.9% buffered lidocaine solution. A 25-gauge needle was inserted into the cortex and moved back-and-forth several times, sample was aspirated and ejected into cold RPMI media containing 10% FBS. A total of five such passes were performed. In all participants, FNAs were performed on the side of vaccination (ipsilateral). In 4 participants, additional FNA was performed on the contralateral side after the second immunization.
Blood was collected in serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson) which were spun at 935g for 15 minutes. Serum was collected, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C for subsequent use.
PBMCs were isolated from blood collected in sodium heparin vacutainer tubes (Becton Dickinson). Briefly, whole blood was first spun at 935g for 15min. The plasma was carefully collected, aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The buffy layer and red cell sediment were diluted with an equal volume of RPMI with 5% FBS (RPMI-5) and gently layered over 15mL of Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) in a 50mL SepMate tube (STEMCELL Technologies). The sample was centrifuged at 1200g for 10 minutes. The PBMC were transferred into a new 50mL conical tube, centrifuged, decanted, and washed twice with RPMI-5 before flow cytometry staining or cryopreservation in FBS with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide.
Full-length, biotinylated spike protein was purchased from R&D Systems. Streptavidin-conjugated BV421 (Biolegend) was then added at a 6:1 molar ratio (biotinylated-protein to streptavidin-conjugate) on ice for 1 hour.
Recombinant HA and RBD was produced as previously described ( Amanat et al., 2020 4. Amanat, F. ∙ Stadlbauer, D. ∙ Strohmeier, S. ... A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1033-1036 Crossref Scopus (1175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Margine et al., 2013 56. Margine, I. ∙ Palese, P. ∙ Krammer, F. Expression of functional recombinant hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins from the novel H7N9 influenza virus using the baculovirus expression system J.

SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans: A detailed protocol for a serological assay, antigen production, and test setup Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2020; 57 :e100 Crossref Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ). To create fluorescently labeled RBD tetramers, RBD was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Micro Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation Kit (ThermoFisher). Streptavidin-conjugated PE was then added at a 6:1 molar ratio (biotinylated-protein to streptavidin-conjugate). Specifically, after the volume of fluorochrome needed to achieve a 6:1 molar ratio was determined, the total volume of fluorochrome was split into 10 subaliquots. These subaliquots were then added, on ice, to the biotinylated protein and mixed by pipetting every 10 minutes (for a total of 10 additions).
Staining was performed on freshly isolated FNA and PBMC samples or cryopreserved control LN and tonsil samples. Up to 10 6 cells were incubated with a cocktail of chemokine receptor antibodies in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FBS and 1mM EDTA) for 10 minutes at 37°C. All remaining steps were carried out at 4°C. Without washing, a 2x cocktail of all other surface antibodies diluted in Brilliant Violet Staining Buffer (BD Biosciences) was added directly and incubated for 1 hour. Cells were washed with FACS buffer, fixed and permeabilized with FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer (eBioSciences) according to manufacturer’s instructions for 1 hour, and incubated with anti-BCL6 mAb (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes. The 23-color panel used in this study is described in Table S3 . Samples were washed, resuspended in FACS buffer and immediately acquired on an Aurora using SpectroFlow v2.2 (Cytek). Data was analyzed using FlowJo v.10 (Treestar). Frequency values for individual cell populations are provided in Table S4 .
viSNE analysis was performed on Cytobank ( https://cytobank.org ).
Cells were defined as live, CD8 - , CD4 - , CD19 + , IgD - IgM - . viSNE analysis was performed using 3200 cells from n = 3 donors per cohort with 5000 iterations, a perplexity of 60 and a theta of 0.5. The following markers and/or probes were used to generate viSNE projections: CXCR5, CD11b, CD11c, CD20, CD27, CD38, BCL6, CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, CD138, ICOS, PD-1, RBD Probe, Full S Probe, HA Probe.
Cells were defined as live, CD8 - , CD19 - , CD4 + , CD45RA - CXCR5 + . Analysis was performed using 2730 cells from n = 3 donors per cohort with 5000 iterations, a perplexity of 100 and a theta of 0.5. The following markers and/or probes were used to generate viSNE projections: PD-1, BCL6, CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, CD11b, CD11c, CD20, CD27, CD38, ICOS.
The activation-induced marker (AIM) assay was performed as previously described ( Painter et al., 2021 66. Painter, M.M. ∙ Mathew, D. ∙ Goel, R.R. ... Rapid induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells is associated with coordinated humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination Immunity. 2021; 54 :2133-2142.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, after thawing and counting, cells were resuspended in fresh RPMI with 10% FBS (R10) to a final density of 10x10 6 cells/mL, and 2x10 6 cells in 200μL were plated in duplicate wells in 96-well round-bottom plates. After resting overnight, CD40 blocking antibody was added to both duplicate wells for 15 minutes prior to stimulation. One of the duplicate wells was then stimulated for 24 hours with costimulation (anti-human CD28/CD49d, BD Biosciences) and the Spike peptide megapool at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, while the other well was treated with costimulation alone as a paired unstimulated sample. The CD4-S peptide megapool consists of 253 overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the entire sequence of the Spike protein and was prepared as previously described ( Grifoni et al., 2020b 39. Grifoni, A. ∙ Sidney, J. ∙ Zhang, Y. ...

The remainder of the AIM assay was performed and samples were collected and analyzed as previously described ( Painter et al., 2021 66. Painter, M.M. ∙ Mathew, D. ∙ Goel, R.R. ... Rapid induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells is associated with coordinated humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination Immunity. 2021; 54 :2133-2142.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). The flow cytometry panel used for the the detection of AIM + cell populations is described in Table S5 .
AIM + cells were identified from non-naïve or total T cell populations where indicated. All data from AIM expression assays were background-subtracted using paired unstimulated control samples. For T cell subsets, the AIM + background frequency of CD45RA - T cells was subtracted independently for each subset. AIM + CD4 T cells were defined by dual-expression of CD200 and CD40L. AIM + CD8 T cells were defined by either expression of 41BB and IFNγ or a boolean analysis identifying cells expressing at least three of five markers: CD200, CD40L, 41BB, CD107a, and intracellular IFNγ.
AIM assay data in Figures 6 D and 6E, S6 C, S6D, S6G, and S6H were visualized using RStudio. Boxplots represent median with interquartile range. Source code and data files are available upon request from the authors.
ELISAs were performed using a previously described protocol ( Anderson et al., 2021a 6. Anderson, E.M. ∙ Eilola, T. ∙ Goodwin, E. ... SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit higher levels of original antigenic sin antibodies compared to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations medRxiv. 2021; Google Scholar , 2021b 7.

Flannery, D.D. ∙ Gouma, S. ∙ Dhudasia, M.B. ... SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among parturient women in Philadelphia Sci. Immunol. 2020; 5 :eabd5709 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Plasmids expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the full-length (FL) spike protein were provided by F. Krammer (Mt. Sinai). SARS-CoV-2 RBD and FL proteins were produced in 293F cells and purified using nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen). The supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA resin at room temperature for 2 hours before collection using gravity flow columns and protein elution. After buffer exchange into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the purified protein was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. OC43 FL spike protein was purchased from Sino Biological (Cat. 40607-V08B). ELISA plates (Immulon 4 HBX, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with PBS (50 μl per well) or a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD or FL proteins (2 μg/ml), or a recombinant OC43 FL protein (1.5 μg/mL) diluted in PBS and stored overnight at 4°C. ELISA plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked for 1 hour with PBS-T containing 3% nonfat milk powder. Serum samples that had been previously heat-inactivated (56°C for 1 hour) were serially diluted four-fold in 96-well round-bottom plates in PBS-T supplemented with 1% nonfat milk powder (dilution buffer), starting at a 1:50 dilution. ELISA plates were then washed three times with PBS-T. 50 μl of serum dilution was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Plates were then washed again with PBS-T three times and 50 μl of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled goat anti-human IgG (1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), goat anti-human IgM HRP (1:1000, Southern Biotech), or goat anti-human IgA (1:5000; Southern Biotech) secondary antibodies was added. After 1-hour incubation at room temperature, plates were washed three times with PBS-T, 50 μl of SureBlue 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (KPL) was added to each well, and 25 μl of 250 mM hydrochloric acid was added to each well to stop the reaction five minutes later. Plates were read at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm using the SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). All incubation and washing steps were performed using a plate mixer. For analyses, OD values from the plates coated with PBS were subtracted from the OD values from plates coated with recombinant protein, to control for background ELISA antibody binding. Each plate contained a dilution series of the IgG monoclonal antibody CR3022, (for SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs) or serially diluted pooled serum (for OC43 ELISAs) to control for variability between assays. Serum antibody concentrations were reported as arbitrary units relative to the CR3022 monoclonal antibody.
Single-timepoint measurements of IgG against tetanus toxoid, mumps, measles, and rubella, was performed on plasma samples from all subjects who participated in the FNA or blood study with the exception of 1 HD (sample unavailable). If available, baseline samples were used; In 2/14 HD and 7/13 KTX subjects, post vaccination samples were used. For tetanus toxoid (VaccZyme), measles (Alpha Diagnostics), mumps (Calbiotech), and rubella (Phoenix Biotech) ELISAs, the manufacturer’s protocol was followed. In brief, samples were diluted 1:20 (mumps), 1:40 (rubella) or 1:100 (measles and tetanus toxoid), in the appropriate diluent and 100 μl of sample or standard was added to the appropriate wells of a pre-coated 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 (mumps), 30 (rubella and tetanus toxoid) or 60 (measles) minutes then plates were washed 3-5X in the appropriate wash buffer. 100 μl of secondary antibody was added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 20 (mumps) or 30 (mumps, rubella, and tetanus toxoid) minutes before being washed 3-5X. 100 μl of substrate was then added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 15 (rubella) or 20 (measles, mumps, and tetanus toxoid) minutes before 100 μl of stop solution was added. Plates were read at 450nM on a Molecular Devices EMax Plus plate reader. A second order polynomial regression was fit to the data in excel v16.55. All samples were run as technical duplicates and the values were averaged prior to plotting.
293T cells plated 24 hours previously at 5 × 10 6 cells per 10 cm dish were transfected using calcium phosphate with 35 μg of pCG1 SARS-CoV-2 S D614G delta18 or pCG1 SARS-CoV-2 S B.1.351 delta 18 expression plasmid encoding a codon optimized SARS-CoV2 S gene with an 18 residue truncation in the cytoplasmic tail. Twelve hours post transfection the cells were fed with fresh media containing 5mM sodium butyrate to increase expression of the transfected DNA. Thirty hours after transfection, the SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells were infected for 2-4 hours with VSV-G pseudotyped VSVΔG-RFP at a MOI of ∼1-3. After infection, the cells were washed twice with media to remove unbound virus. Media containing the VSVΔG-RFP SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes was harvested 28-30 hours after infection and clarified by centrifugation twice at 6000g then aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until used for antibody neutralization analysis.
All sera were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 55 °C prior to use in neutralization assay. Vero E6 cells stably expressing TMPRSS2 were seeded in 100 μl at 2.5x10 4 cells/well in a 96 well collagen coated plate. The next day, 2-fold serially diluted serum samples were mixed with VSVΔG-RFP SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus (100-300 focus forming units/well) and incubated for 1hr at 37 °C. Also included in this mixture to neutralize any potential VSV-G carryover virus was 1E9F9, a mouse anti-VSV Indiana G, at a concentration of 600 ng/ml (Absolute Antibody). The serum-virus mixture was then used to replace the media on VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. 22 hours post infection, the cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before visualization on an S6 FluoroSpot Analyzer (CTL, Shaker Heights OH). Individual infected foci were enumerated and the values compared with control wells without antibody. The focus reduction neutralization titer 50% (FRNT 50 ) was measured as the greatest serum dilution at which focus count was reduced by at least 50% relative to control cells that were infected with pseudotyped virus in the absence of human serum. FRNT 50 titers for each sample were measured in at least two technical replicates and were reported for each sample as the geometric mean.
GraphPad Prism software version 9 or RStudio were used for generating all plots and correlation images presented in this work. All statistical analysis was performed in R version 4.0.3, using the following packages: ggplot2, Semblance, multicross, crossmatchtest, dplyr, randtests, ggpubr, and merTools. The following functions were used —runs.test(), wilcox.test(), crossmatchtest() and mcm() per the original statistician developer’s instructions. The departure of the data from a normal/Gaussian distribution was confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilk test and consequently, nonparametric, distribution-free tests were used for all comparisons throughout this work. Single comparisons between variables were performed using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with continuity correction when the number of data points in each group was greater than seven. Else, the Wald–Wolfowitz runs test was employed to afford greater sensitivity to the analysis ( Sprent, 2019 84. Sprent, P. Data driven statistical methods Routledge, 2019 Crossref Google Scholar ). Univariate correlations involving continuous and categorical data were performed using the rank-based Spearman correlation analysis. The reported p-values are corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 11. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57 :289-300 Crossref Google Scholar ). Multivariate regression analyses were used to estimate the association between a given dependent variable and a set of predictors or independent variables. The null hypothesis was calculated as follows: in X∼ β 0 + β 1 Y 1 + β 2 Y 2 , H 0 : β 1 = β 2 = 0, where β 0 = intercept and β 1 , …, β n = regression coefficients. The multiple correlation coefficient was computed in each multiple regression analysis model to estimate the proportion of variance of the dependent variable explained by the independent variables, and its significance was computed using the F statistic ( Rencher, 2002 75. Rencher, A.C. Methods of multivariate analysis Wiley-Interscience, 2002 Crossref Google Scholar ).
Statistical significance for all comparisons was set at the critical values of p < 0.05 ( ∗ ), p < 0.01 ( ∗∗ ), p < 0.001 ( ∗∗∗ ), and p < 0.0001 ( ∗∗∗∗ ).
