Title: Actin cytoskeleton remodeling primes RIG-I-like receptor activation


Abstract: Summary

The current dogma of RNA-mediated innate immunity is that sensing of immunostimulatory RNA ligands is sufficient for the activation of intracellular sensors and induction of interferon (IFN) responses. Here, we report that actin cytoskeleton disturbance primes RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) activation. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement induced by virus infection or commonly used reagents to intracellularly deliver RNA triggers the relocalization of PPP1R12C, a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), from filamentous actin to cytoplasmic RLRs. This allows dephosphorylation-mediated RLR priming and, together with the RNA agonist, induces effective RLR downstream signaling. Genetic ablation of PPP1R12C impairs antiviral responses and enhances susceptibility to infection with several RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, picornavirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus. Our work identifies actin cytoskeleton disturbance as a priming signal for RLR-mediated innate immunity, which may open avenues for antiviral or adjuvant design.

Section: Introduction

Activation of innate immunity to virus infection is mediated by specialized sensor proteins called pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) that reside in the cytoplasm or nucleus or are embedded into membranes. Many PRRs detect viral or host-derived nucleic acids with specific features and, upon recognition, trigger transcriptional induction of cytokines such as type I interferons (IFNs) ( Goubau et al., 2013 20.

Innate immune sensing and signaling of cytosolic nucleic acids Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 32 :461-488 Crossref Scopus (909) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family of cytosolic RNA sensors detects and restricts many different RNA viruses in a variety of cell types. RIG-I and the related receptor MDA5 share a conserved domain architecture consisting of a DExD/H box RNA helicase and a carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), both of which engage the RNA agonist, as well as two amino-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) that mediate signaling via mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) ( Chow et al., 2018 10.

Extensive research has focused on understanding how RLRs are activated by RNA agonists and how post-translational modifications regulate RLR activation ( Rehwinkel and Gack, 2020 44.

Immunol. 2016; 16 :566-580 Crossref Scopus (389) PubMed Google Scholar ). Acetylation modulates RIG-I’s RNA-sensing ability, while phosphorylation and modification with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins regulate RLR signaling ( Chiang and Gack, 2017 9. Chiang, C. ∙ Gack, M.U. Post-translational control of intracellular pathogen sensing pathways Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :39-52 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phosphorylation of RIG-I at serine 8 (S8) (and other residues) and of MDA5 at serine 88 (S88) prohibits RLR activation prior to infection, whereas dephosphorylation of these sites by the cellular protein phosphatase-1 PP1α or PP1γ is crucial for RLR activation in response to virus infection ( Gack et al., 2010 17.

CARD dephosphorylation is a prerequisite for K63-linked ubiquitination (RIG-I) and ISGylation (MDA5), which promote RLR multimerization, MAVS binding, and downstream signaling ( Liu et al., 2021 31. Liu, G. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Parker, Z.M. ... ISG15-dependent activation of the sensor MDA5 is antagonized by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease to evade host innate immunity Nat.

Chiang, C. ∙ Gack, M.U. Post-translational control of intracellular pathogen sensing pathways Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :39-52 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar . Thus, PP1α/γ is a key upstream activator of both RIG-I and MDA5; however, how PP1α/γ itself is activated upon viral infection is unknown. Moreover, as PP1 catalyzes not only dephosphorylation of RLRs but also of many other cellular substrates, it remains unclear what determines its specificity toward RLRs. Substrate specificity of PP1, the catalytic core, is conferred by complex formation with one of >200 PP1-regulatory proteins ( Peti et al., 2013 41. Peti, W. ∙ Nairn, A.C. ∙ Page, R. Structural basis for protein phosphatase 1 regulation and specificity FEBS J. 2013; 280 :596-611 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ; Terrak et al., 2004 57. Terrak, M. ∙ Kerff, F. ∙ Langsetmo, K. ... Structural basis of protein phosphatase 1 regulation Nature. 2004; 429 :780-784 Crossref Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), many of which have not been characterized functionally. In particular, it is unknown which PP1-regulatory protein(s) mediate RLR-targeting by PP1α/γ.
Viruses have evolved to exploit and remodel the host cell’s actin cytoskeleton at defined stages of their lifecycle, such as entry, intracellular transport, virion assembly, and egress ( Döhner and Sodeik, 2005 13. Döhner, K. ∙ Sodeik, B. The role of the cytoskeleton during viral infection Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285 :67-108 PubMed Google Scholar ; Taylor et al., 2011 56. Taylor, M.P. ∙ Koyuncu, O.O. ∙ Enquist, L.W. Subversion of the actin cytoskeleton during viral infection Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9 :427-439 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, macropinocytosis- or endocytosis-mediated entry of many viruses including coronaviruses and influenza A virus (IAV) requires cortical actin rearrangements. Other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) engage with chemokine coreceptors that trigger actin dynamics to promote entry ( Yoder et al., 2008 67. Yoder, A. ∙ Yu, D. ∙ Dong, L. ... HIV envelope-CXCR4 signaling activates cofilin to overcome cortical actin restriction in resting CD4 T cells Cell. 2008; 134 :782-792 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ). Later during infection, filamentous actin (F-actin) can facilitate virion assembly and budding by stabilizing plasma membrane microdomains. While viral subversion of actin dynamics and scaffolding functions has been well documented, it is unknown whether virus-induced remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton can be sensed by the host’s immune surveillance machinery.
Here, we show that PP1α/γ’s specificity toward RLRs is mediated by the F-actin-residing PP1-regulatory protein PPP1R12C (hereafter called “R12C”). We further identify that virus-mediated actin cytoskeleton disturbance triggers RLR dephosphorylation by the PP1-R12C phosphatase complex and primes RLRs for activation by RNA ligands, unveiling a two-signal activation mode for RLRs that requires both immunostimulatory RNA and virus-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling.

Section: Results

We hypothesized that a specific PP1-regulatory protein targets PP1α/γ to the RLRs following viral infection. From our RNAi phosphatome screen that identified PP1α/γ as RLR activators ( Wies et al., 2013 63. Wies, E. ∙ Wang, M.K. ∙ Maharaj, N.P. ... Dephosphorylation of the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 by the phosphatase PP1 is essential for innate immune signaling Immunity. 2013; 38 :437-449 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ), eight candidate PP1-regulatory proteins also emerged ( Figure 1 A). To determine whether any of them directly mediate RLR activation or act downstream of RLRs, we assayed the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of these candidate PP1-regulatory proteins on IFN-β promoter activation induced by the CARD domains of RIG-I and MDA5 (RIG-I(2CARD) and MDA5(2CARD)), or their common downstream signaling adapter MAVS ( Figures 1 A and S1 A). Compared with non-targeting control siRNA transfection, silencing of R12C reduced IFN-β promoter activation induced by RIG-I(2CARD) or MDA5(2CARD), but not MAVS, suggesting that R12C acts at the level of RLRs. In contrast, depletion of other PP1-regulatory proteins reduced signaling induced by RIG-I(2CARD), MDA5(2CARD), and MAVS, suggesting that they act at the level or downstream of MAVS or affect fundamental cellular processes. Silencing R12C, but not the other PP1-regulatory proteins, enhanced phosphorylation of RIG-I (at S8) and MDA5 (at S88)—indicative of diminished dephosphorylation—to a level comparable to PP1α/γ depletion ( Figures 1 B and S1 B). Depletion of endogenous R12C also reduced the IFN-β promoter activation stimulated by exogenous full-length RIG-I or MDA5 as efficiently as knockdown of PP1α/γ or IRF3, the latter being a key transcription factor in IFN induction that served as a control ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S1 C). Depletion of endogenous R12C also impaired IFN-β responses upon stimulation with the synthetic dsRNA high-molecular-weight polyinosine-polycytidylic acid complexed with LyoVec (poly(I:C)-LyoVec) or following infection with SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV2) (both of which primarily activate MDA5) ( Kato et al., 2006 25. Kato, H. ∙ Takeuchi, O. ∙ Sato, S. ... Differential roles of MDA5 and RIG-I helicases in the recognition of RNA viruses Nature. 2006; 441 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (3107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2021 31. Liu, G. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Parker, Z.M. ... ISG15-dependent activation of the sensor MDA5 is antagonized by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease to evade host innate immunity Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :467-478 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1D). Furthermore, R12C knockdown reduced antiviral gene induction in response to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or a recombinant IAV lacking the NS1 gene (IAVΔNS1) (both sensed by RIG-I) ( Gack et al., 2009 16. Gack, M.U. ∙ Albrecht, R.A. ∙ Urano, T. ... Influenza A virus NS1 targets the ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to evade recognition by the host viral RNA sensor RIG-I Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5 :439-449 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ), to a level comparable to silencing of RIG-I or IRF3 ( Figures 1 G–1I and S1E). We also tested the effect of R12C knockdown on IFN induction triggered by ZIKV that is sensed by both RIG-I and MDA5 ( Riedl et al., 2019 46. Riedl, W. ∙ Acharya, D. ∙ Lee, J.H. ... Zika virus NS3 mimics a cellular 14-3-3-binding motif to antagonize RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated innate immunity Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 26 :493-503.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found diminished IFNB1 transcripts in R12C-depleted cells compared with control siRNA-transfected cells ( Figure 1 J). Notably, R12C silencing did not affect IFN-β promoter activation triggered by ectopic expression of the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its adapter stimulator of interferon genes (STING) ( Figure S1 F) or following polydeoxyadenylic-polydeoxythymidylic acid (poly(dA:dT))-LyoVec stimulation ( Figure 1 K), ruling out a general effect of R12C depletion on IFN induction.
To corroborate the role of R12C in the RLR-mediated antiviral response, we generated clonal PPP1R12C knockout (KO) HEK293T cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing ( Figures S1 G–S1I). Compared with wild-type (WT) control cells, PPP1R12C KO HEK293T cells exhibited significantly reduced IFNB1 transcript expression upon poly(I:C)-LyoVec stimulation ( Figure 1 L). Furthermore, secreted IFN-β protein levels were diminished in Sendai virus (SeV)-infected PPP1R12C KO HEK293T cells compared with those of infected WT cells ( Figure 1 M). Antiviral gene expression was also significantly reduced in PPP1R12C KO Hap1, a fibroblast-like myeloid cell line, in response to infection with SeV ( Figure S1 J) or a mutant recombinant encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) deficient in MDA5 antagonism (mutEMCV) ( Deddouche et al., 2014 12. Deddouche, S. ∙ Goubau, D. ∙ Rehwinkel, J. ... Identification of an LGP2-associated MDA5 agonist in picornavirus-infected cells eLife. 2014; 3 :e01535 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Hato et al., 2007 21. Hato, S.V. ∙ Ricour, C. ∙ Schulte, B.M. ... The mengovirus leader protein blocks interferon-alpha/beta gene transcription and inhibits activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9 :2921-2930 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), compared with infected control cells ( Figure S1 K). Importantly, PPP1R12C gene targeting diminished IFNB1 induction mediated by ectopic expression of WT MDA5, but not of the MDA5 S88A phospho-null mutant that does not depend on PP1α/γ for activation ( Wies et al., 2013 63. Wies, E. ∙ Wang, M.K. ∙ Maharaj, N.P. ... Dephosphorylation of the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 by the phosphatase PP1 is essential for innate immune signaling Immunity. 2013; 38 :437-449 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 L). Furthermore, KO of PPP1R12C did not affect the early cytokine response to infection by HSV-1 (a dsDNA virus), which is mediated primarily by cGAS ( Figure S1 M). When challenged with RNA viruses, PPP1R12C -deficient cells showed enhanced replication of SCoV2 ( Figure 1 N), VSV ( Figures 1 O and S1 N), IAV ( Figure 1 P), and EMCV ( Figure S1 O) compared with the respective control cells. Collectively, this establishes a role for the PP1-regulatory protein R12C in promoting RLR dephosphorylation and antiviral innate immunity.
We generated Ppp1r12c KO ( Ppp1r12c −/− ) mice to assess the physiological relevance of R12C in innate immunity to RNA virus infection ( Figures S2 A–S2C; STAR Methods ). Ppp1r12c −/− mice exhibited significantly higher mortality upon VSV infection than WT mice ( Figure 2 A). Enhanced VSV replication was detected in the brain and blood of infected Ppp1r12c −/− mice compared with WT control mice ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Primary dermal fibroblasts from Ppp1r12c −/− mice, but not WT mice, showed impaired Ifnβ induction in response to VSV infection, after both low and high MOI challenges ( Figure 2 D). Ppp1r12c −/− fibroblasts also showed low Ifnβ , Ccl5 , and ISG ( Mx1 and Oas1 ) transcript levels upon SeV, mutEMCV, or IAVΔNS1 infection, whereas infected WT cells mounted robust innate immune responses to these viruses ( Figures 2 E, 2F, and S2 D). The phosphorylation of endogenous IRF3 and/or TBK1 following IAVΔNS1, SeV, or mutEMCV infection was significantly diminished in Ppp1r12c −/− mouse fibroblasts compared with that in infected WT fibroblasts ( Figures 2 G and 2H). In accordance with our data showing impairment of antiviral gene expression in the absence of R12C , VSV and EMCV replication was significantly higher in Ppp1r12c −/− mouse dermal fibroblasts than that in control cells ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Together, these data identify R12C as a regulator of innate immune defenses to RNA virus infection in vivo .
We next sought to identify the molecular details by which R12C promotes RLR signaling. We found that, similar to the RLRs and PP1α/γ, R12C is expressed in many different tissues ( Figure S3 A). However, in contrast to RIG-I and MDA5, which are transcriptionally upregulated by type-I IFNs or virus infection ( Rehwinkel and Gack, 2020 44. Rehwinkel, J. ∙ Gack, M.U. RIG-I-like receptors: their regulation and roles in RNA sensing Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :537-551 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mRNA and protein abundance of R12C did not change upon IFN-β stimulation or infection with SeV or IAV ( Figures S3 B and S3C). Since R12C is a PP1-targeting protein, we hypothesized that R12C binds to RLRs and facilitates the PP1-RLR interaction upon virus infection. Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) experiments showed that infection with VSV or SeV (sensed by RIG-I) or DENV or ZIKV (detected by both RIG-I and MDA5) ( Rehwinkel and Gack, 2020 44. Rehwinkel, J. ∙ Gack, M.U. RIG-I-like receptors: their regulation and roles in RNA sensing Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :537-551 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ) efficiently triggered R12C binding to RIG-I and/or MDA5 ( Figures 3 A, S3 D, and S3E), while there was no or minimal R12C-RLR interaction in uninfected cells. Of note, the interaction between R12C and PP1 was also enhanced upon viral infection ( Figure S3 E), suggesting the formation of a PP1-R12C-RIG-I or PP1-R12C-MDA5 triple complex. Proximity ligation assay (PLA) indicated that endogenous R12C extensively colocalized with RIG-I or MDA5 upon infection with VSV, IAV, ZIKV, or SCoV2. In contrast, R12C-RLR colocalization was low in uninfected cells ( Figures 3 B–3G, S3 F, and S3 G). Importantly, PPP1R12C- gene editing abrogated the interaction between PP1 and RIG-I or MDA5 in SeV- and EMCV-infected cells, respectively ( Figures 3 H and 3I), suggesting that R12C mediates PP1 binding to the RLRs. Molecular mapping studies showed that R12C efficiently bound to FLAG-RIG-I and FLAG-RIG-I(2CARD), but not to RIG-I(Δ2CARD) (containing the CTD and helicase) ( Figure 3 J). Similarly, MDA5(2CARD) was sufficient for R12C binding ( Figure S3 H). Structurally, R12C harbors an N-terminal region that contains the PP1-binding motif adjacent to four ankyrin repeats (AR1–AR4), followed by two coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2) at the C terminus ( Figure 3 K). Reciprocal binding assays showed that the N-terminal region of R12C that contains the ARs (aa 1–389) bound to FLAG-RIG-I ( Figure 3 K) and FLAG-MDA5 ( Figure S3 I). Of note, the C-terminal region of R12C (aa 390–782), as well as the first 95 amino acids that contain the PP1-binding motif, were dispensable for RIG-I or MDA5 binding ( Figures 3 K and S3 I). Fine-mapping studies indicated that AR3 and AR4 are required for RIG-I(2CARD) interaction ( Figure 3 L). In summary, these data establish that virus infection induces PP1-R12C-RLR complex formation that is mediated by an interaction of the CARDs of RLRs with the ARs of R12C.
We next investigated whether R12C mediates RLR activation also in immune cells, specifically in primary human macrophages. Consistent with our data in primary human lung fibroblasts, we found that VSV and IAV infection induced the colocalization of R12C and RIG-I in primary human macrophages ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Similarly, EMCV infection triggered R12C-MDA5 colocalization ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Silencing of R12C or IRF3 (positive control) in primary human macrophages markedly diminished STAT1 phosphorylation as well as IFNB1 induction following VSV or mutEMCV infection, compared with nontargeting control siRNA-transfected cells ( Figures 4 E–4G and S4 A). R12C knockdown also profoundly diminished antiviral gene expression in primary human macrophages following IAVΔNS1 and DENV infection ( Figures S4 B and S4C), strengthening the concept that R12C promotes antiviral gene responses to a range of different RNA virus infections. Furthermore, R12C depletion diminished IFNB1 transcripts in primary human macrophages following poly(I:C)-LyoVec stimulation but had no effect on antiviral gene induction triggered by poly(dA:dT)-LyoVec ( Figure 4 H). In contrast, IRF3 silencing abrogated IFNB1 gene expression following both stimuli as expected ( Figure 4 H). In line with these data from human macrophages, bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) isolated from Ppp1r12c −/− mice exhibited reduced cytokine and ISG responses upon poly(I:C)-LyoVec stimulation compared with stimulated BMMs from WT mice ( Figures S4 D and S4E). Taken together, these data show that R12C forms a complex with RIG-I and MDA5 and mediates antiviral innate immune responses in macrophages.
Although the biological function of R12C is largely unknown, it has been shown that R12C regulates actomyosin cytoskeleton dynamics as part of the myosin phosphatase complex ( Tan et al., 2001 54. Tan, I. ∙ Ng, C.H. ∙ Lim, L. ... Phosphorylation of a novel myosin binding subunit of protein phosphatase 1 reveals a conserved mechanism in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :21209-21216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most viruses modulate the cellular actin cytoskeleton during their lifecycles ( Taylor et al., 2011 56. Taylor, M.P. ∙ Koyuncu, O.O. ∙ Enquist, L.W. Subversion of the actin cytoskeleton during viral infection Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9 :427-439 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our data showed that RLRs interact with the R12C ARs, which also mediate R12C binding to actin cytoskeleton dynamics-regulatory components ( Tan et al., 2001 54. Tan, I. ∙ Ng, C.H. ∙ Lim, L. ... Phosphorylation of a novel myosin binding subunit of protein phosphatase 1 reveals a conserved mechanism in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :21209-21216 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we hypothesized that virus-induced actin cytoskeleton disturbance may trigger displacement of R12C from F-actin, thereby promoting cytoplasmic PP1-R12C-RLR complex formation and RLR dephosphorylation. We found that R12C exhibited a filamentous-like distribution and colocalized with F-actin in uninfected primary human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs); however, upon infection with VSV, IAV, or ZIKV, R12C reorganized to cytoplasmic punctate structures ( Figures 5 A–5D). Such subcellular relocalization of R12C was also observed in cells treated with virus-like particles (VLPs), which are replication defective, suggesting that R12C redistribution does not require active virus replication ( Figures 5 E and 5F). We next tested whether actin cytoskeleton disturbance alone is sufficient for R12C relocalization. R12C extensively relocalized from F-actin to cytoplasmic punctate-like structures in cells treated with Cytochalasin D (CytoD), a commonly used actin-perturbing drug that inhibits actin polymerization ( Figures 5 G and 5H). Inversely, treatment of cells with Jasplakinolide (Jas), which promotes actin filament polymerization and stabilization, rescued VLP-induced R12C release from F-actin ( Figures S5 A and S5B).
In line with this, PLA showed that VLP or CytoD treatment triggered colocalization of R12C and RIG-I ( Figures 5 I–5L). Inversely, Jas treatment blocked R12C-RIG-I colocalization induced by VLP stimulation ( Figures S5 C and S5D). CoIP showed that endogenous R12C complexed with RLRs and PP1α/γ in CytoD-treated cells, while their binding was minimal in DMSO-treated cells ( Figure 5 M). These data suggest that virus- or chemical-agent-induced actin disturbance, which was confirmed by immunoblot (IB) analysis determining cofilin S3 dephosphorylation ( Figure 5 M; Yang et al., 1998 66. Yang, N. ∙ Higuchi, O. ∙ Ohashi, K. ... Cofilin phosphorylation by LIM-kinase 1 and its role in Rac-mediated actin reorganization Nature. 1998; 393 :809-812 Crossref Scopus (1105) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoder et al., 2008 67. Yoder, A. ∙ Yu, D. ∙ Dong, L. ... HIV envelope-CXCR4 signaling activates cofilin to overcome cortical actin restriction in resting CD4 T cells Cell. 2008; 134 :782-792 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ), facilitates R12C relocalization and PP1-R12C-RLR complex formation. Consistent with this concept, CytoD or VLP treatment triggered RIG-I dephosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 5 N and 5O). Moreover, we made use of the rotavirus VP4 protein that is known to remodel actin cytoskeleton ( Gardet et al., 2006 19. Gardet, A. ∙ Breton, M. ∙ Fontanges, P. ... Rotavirus spike protein VP4 binds to and remodels actin bundles of the epithelial brush border into actin bodies J. Virol. 2006; 80 :3947-3956 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that ectopic expression of VP4 effectively triggered RIG-I CARD dephosphorylation ( Figures S5 E and S5F). Of note, R12C KO or knockdown did not affect basal or virus-induced cytoskeletal actin dynamics, as measured by cofilin S3 phosphorylation ( Figures S5 G–S5I), nor did it impact early viral infection ( Figures S5 J and S5K).
It has been shown that RLR activation is a multistep process that, besides dephosphorylation, requires modification by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins ( Liu et al., 2021 31. Liu, G. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Parker, Z.M. ... ISG15-dependent activation of the sensor MDA5 is antagonized by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease to evade host innate immunity Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :467-478 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rehwinkel and Gack, 2020 44. Rehwinkel, J. ∙ Gack, M.U. RIG-I-like receptors: their regulation and roles in RNA sensing Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :537-551 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that, despite promoting effective RIG-I dephosphorylation ( Figures 5 N and 5O), CytoD or VLP treatment did not induce the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I ( Gack et al., 2007 18. Gack, M.U. ∙ Shin, Y.C. ∙ Joo, C.H. ... TRIM25 RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase is essential for RIG-I-mediated antiviral activity Nature. 2007; 446 :916-920 Crossref Scopus (1325) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 5 P and S5 L). In accord, CytoD or VLP treatment alone did not elicit downstream IFN-β gene expression ( Figures S5 M and S5N). Taken together, these results indicate that actin remodeling serves as a priming signal to induce PP1-R12C-RLR complex formation and RLR dephosphorylation; however, actin cytoskeleton disturbance itself is not sufficient to induce full activation of RLRs and ensuing antiviral gene expression.
Virus-derived or mis-localized/-processed host RNAs are well known to serve as RLR agonists, and the current dogma is that immunostimulatory RNA is sufficient for activation of RLR-mediated antiviral immunity. As our data indicated that actin cytoskeleton disturbance triggers the early activation steps of RLRs, we sought to determine the respective requirements of actin disturbance versus dsRNA for RLR activation. We first focused on a stimulus that is well known to induce RLR signaling: the intracellular delivery of synthetic dsRNA, such as poly(I:C), which is commonly achieved by cationic lipid or polymer-based transfection reagents (e.g., LyoVec). As these transfection reagents are known to require cellular uptake and fusion ( Cardarelli et al., 2016 7. Cardarelli, F. ∙ Digiacomo, L. ∙ Marchini, C. ... The intracellular trafficking mechanism of Lipofectamine-based transfection reagents and its implication for gene delivery Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :25879 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Coppola et al., 2013 11. Coppola, S. ∙ Cardarelli, F. ∙ Pozzi, D. ... The role of cytoskeleton networks on lipid-mediated delivery of DNA Ther. Deliv. 2013; 4 :191-202 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may trigger actin cytoskeleton disturbance, we tested whether lipid/polymer-based transfection reagents induce the early steps of RLR activation. We found that LyoVec or polyethylenimine (PEI), two reagents commonly used to deliver immunostimulatory RNA, induced the subcellular redistribution of R12C as efficiently as transfection of poly(I:C)-LyoVec ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Moreover, LyoVec alone, similar to poly(I:C)-LyoVec, triggered colocalization of R12C and RIG-I ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Notably, treatment of cells with LyoVec, PEI, or Lipofectamine 2000, the latter being another commonly used transfection reagent, efficiently induced RIG-I/MDA5 CARD and cofilin dephosphorylation ( Figure S6 E). However, these transfection reagents did not elicit downstream IFN-β gene expression ( Figure S6 F).
We hypothesized that two independent signals—actin cytoskeleton disturbance and dsRNA agonist binding—are essential for full activation of RLR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we used a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible system to intracellularly express a 5′-triphosphorylated (3p) blunt-ended stem-loop RNA (hereafter called “3p-SL blunt ”), a canonical RIG-I agonist ( Schlee, 2013 48. Schlee, M. Master sensors of pathogenic RNA - RIG-I like receptors Immunobiology. 2013; 218 :1322-1335 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inducible expression of a similar stem-loop RNA but carrying a 3′-overhang (termed “3p-SL overhang ”), a feature known to substantially diminish RIG-I binding ( Schlee et al., 2009 50. Schlee, M. ∙ Roth, A. ∙ Hornung, V. ... Recognition of 5′ triphosphate by RIG-I helicase requires short blunt double-stranded RNA as contained in panhandle of negative-strand virus Immunity. 2009; 31 :25-34 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar ), served as a control ( Figure 6 A). We generated A549 cell lines that express, upon Dox treatment, either 3p-SL blunt or 3p-SL overhang ( Figure S6 G). Furthermore, we generated control cells that were transduced only with a lentivirus vector and hence do not express any exogenous RNA ( Figure S6 G). First, we validated that the engineered cell lines including control cells responded comparably to RNA virus infection (SeV and IAV) ( Figure 6 B). Furthermore, as expected, no antiviral gene expression was detected in cells expressing 3p-SL overhang , or in control cells that do not express exogenous RNA, with or without Dox treatment ( Figure 6 C). We found that expression of 3p-SL blunt RNA by Dox induced no or very little IFNB1 and IFNL1 transcripts despite efficient RNA-agonist expression (∼300–400 copies per cell) ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 G). Strikingly, treatment of 3p-SL blunt -expressing cells with VLPs or PEI robustly potentiated IFNB1 and IFNL1 expression. In contrast, VLP or PEI treatment had no effect on antiviral gene expression in 3p-SL blunt cells that were not induced with Dox or in control cells expressing 3p-SL overhang or no exogenous RNA ( Figures 6 C and 6D). A similar effect was observed in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) expressing 3p-SL blunt RNA ( Figure S6 H). Of note, potentiation of IFNB1 responses by PEI was strong in HDFs expressing low amounts of 3p-SL blunt RNA but modest in high-copy-3p-SL blunt HDFs ( Figure S6 H), suggesting that actin cytoskeleton disturbance plays an important role in RLR-signal potentiation particularly when RNA-agonist amounts are limited. Crucially, the enhancing effect of VLP treatment on RIG-I agonist-induced IFNB1 , IFNL1 , and ISG ( RSAD2 and MX1 ) expression was strongly diminished upon silencing of endogenous R12C or RIG-I ( Figures 6 E and S6 I), further supporting the proposal that R12C mediates the potentiation of RIG-I-induced innate immune responses caused by actin remodeling.

Section: Discussion

Dynamic phosphorylation of innate immune sensors—RLRs, cGAS, and NOD-like receptors—has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism where phosphorylation keeps these receptors inactive and phosphatase-dependent dephosphorylation prompts their activation ( Li et al., 2021 29.

Zhong, L. ∙ Hu, M.M. ∙ Bian, L.J. ... Phosphorylation of cGAS by CDK1 impairs self-DNA sensing in mitosis Cell Discov. 2020; 6 :26 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). How the activity of phosphatases upstream of these sensors is coordinated to achieve rapid and specific PRR activation has remained elusive. Here, we identify the PP1-regulatory protein R12C as a pivotal upstream activator of RLRs mediating the specific recruitment of PP1α/γ to these RNA sensors. We further show that subcellular redistribution of F-actin-residing R12C following virus infection induces the formation of an active PP1-R12C-RLR complex, which dephosphorylates and primes RLRs. These findings uncover key molecular events upstream of RLR activation and provide evidence for a direct link between the actin-regulatory protein, R12C, and innate immunity. Our data indicate that R12C mediates RLR priming in a variety of cell types including primary fibroblasts and macrophages. As RLRs are active in many different cells and tissues, the full repertoire of cell types in which R12C aids in RLR activation remains to be determined.
Cellular cytoskeleton components have increasingly been recognized as key mediators of host defenses, such as B-cell-mediated adaptive immunity ( Mostowy and Shenoy, 2015 35. Mostowy, S. ∙ Shenoy, A.R. The cytoskeleton in cell-autonomous immunity: structural determinants of host defence Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :559-573 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ; Randow et al., 2013 42. Randow, F. ∙ MacMicking, J.D. ∙ James, L.C. Cellular self-defense: how cell-autonomous immunity protects against pathogens Science. 2013; 340 :701-706 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tolar, 2017 59. Tolar, P. Cytoskeletal control of B cell responses to antigens Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :621-634 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work unveils a role for virus-induced actin cytoskeletal disturbance in initiating RLR-mediated innate immunity. Our findings suggest a “two-signal” mechanism of RLR activation where virus-induced actin remodeling and RNA-ligand binding are both required for effective RLR activation, as each of the two signals alone did not effectively induce RLR signaling. Our data further indicate that virus-induced actin cytoskeleton disturbance is crucial for RLR activation particularly in situations where RNA-agonist levels are low. Along these lines, while our study shows that this “two-signal” mode of RLR activation occurs during RNA virus infection, future studies are warranted to address the role of actin dynamics in RLR activation during infection with other pathogens, such as specific DNA viruses sensed by RLRs ( Rehwinkel and Gack, 2020 44. Rehwinkel, J. ∙ Gack, M.U. RIG-I-like receptors: their regulation and roles in RNA sensing Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :537-551 Crossref Scopus (837) PubMed Google Scholar ) or perhaps certain bacteria. Moreover, it is tempting to speculate that R12C-mediated RLR priming may also play a role in diseases with aberrant innate immune responses and particularly in autoimmune/proinflammatory diseases associated with mutations in actin-regulatory proteins ( Moulding et al., 2013 36. Moulding, D.A. ∙ Record, J. ∙ Malinova, D. ... Actin cytoskeletal defects in immunodeficiency Immunol. Rev. 2013; 256 :282-299 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ; Papa et al., 2020 40. Papa, R. ∙ Penco, F. ∙ Volpi, S. ... Actin remodeling defects leading to autoinflammation and immune dysregulation Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :604206 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work, combined with findings by others showing that host cytoskeleton disturbance by bacterial effector proteins can trigger innate immune activation ( Bielig et al., 2014 3. Bielig, H. ∙ Lautz, K. ∙ Braun, P.R. ... The cofilin phosphatase slingshot homolog 1 (SSH1) links NOD1 signaling to actin remodeling PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1004351 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Keestra et al., 2013 26.

Innate immune sensing of bacterial modifications of Rho GTPases by the pyrin inflammasome Nature. 2014; 513 :237-241 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggests that the mammalian immune surveillance apparatus integrates classical pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) detection with the sensing of pathogen-dysregulated cellular cytoskeletal processes in order to guide PRR activation.
A recent study implicated MDA5 in mediating a protective immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination ( Li et al., 2022 28. Li, C. ∙ Lee, A. ∙ Grigoryan, L. ... Mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity to the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine Nat. Immunol. 2022; 23 :543-555 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings, combined with our study that showed that commonly used reagents to intracellularly deliver RNA (e.g., liposomes) prime RLR activation, provide a mandate to further explore the possibility of manipulating the actin cytoskeleton for mRNA vaccine or therapeutic applications.
Many viruses usurp the actin cytoskeleton for successful infection of host cells. Whereas viruses such as HIV induce dynamic actin remodeling to facilitate viral entry ( Wang et al., 2012 62. Wang, W. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Yu, D. ... A dichotomy in cortical actin and chemotactic actin activity between human memory and naive T cells contributes to their differential susceptibility to HIV-1 infection J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :35455-35469 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoder et al., 2008 67. Yoder, A. ∙ Yu, D. ∙ Dong, L. ... HIV envelope-CXCR4 signaling activates cofilin to overcome cortical actin restriction in resting CD4 T cells Cell. 2008; 134 :782-792 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ), other viruses use the actin cytoskeleton for intracellular trafficking or viral egress ( Döhner and Sodeik, 2005 13. Döhner, K. ∙ Sodeik, B. The role of the cytoskeleton during viral infection Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285 :67-108 PubMed Google Scholar ; Taylor et al., 2011 56. Taylor, M.P. ∙ Koyuncu, O.O. ∙ Enquist, L.W. Subversion of the actin cytoskeleton during viral infection Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9 :427-439 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work, combined with these studies, suggests that actin-mediated priming of innate immunity is likely a “trade-off” for the beneficial effects that actin dynamics have for the virus, which may be mitigated by virally encoded IFN antagonists that curb an effective antiviral response. Future work is needed to determine the relative pro- and antiviral contributions of actin cytoskeleton dynamics during virus infection, which may be virus or cell-type specific.
In summary, our findings identify the key upstream events that govern phosphatase-dependent RLR priming and unveil a previously unknown role for virus-induced actin cytoskeleton disturbance in the potentiation of antiviral innate immunity.
In this study, we show that R12C is recruited from actin filaments to RLRs upon disturbance of the actin cytoskeleton by viruses or VLPs or through commonly used RNA transfection reagents. However, the exact mechanism(s) that trigger the relocalization of R12C from F-actin to RLRs and key molecules mediating this process remain to be identified. Future studies are also needed to address how different modes of virus-induced actin cytoskeleton dynamics and their temporal aspects contribute to RLR priming by the PP1-R12C complex. Exploring the interconnection of actin’s role in supporting specific viral replication steps and the herein reported function of actin dynamics in promoting antiviral immunity also warrants further investigation. We used primary fibroblasts and macrophages as well as certain epithelial cell lines in our study; however, RLR activation by actin disturbance in other cell types awaits investigation. Finally, multiple sensors contribute to effective innate immune sensing of viral infection, and it remains unclear whether other sensors besides RLRs are regulated by similar mechanisms as presented here.

Primary human macrophages were isolated and differentiated from buffy coats as previously described ( Hotter et al., 2019 24. Hotter, D. ∙ Bosso, M. ∙ Jønsson, K.L. ... IFI16 targets the transcription factor Sp1 to suppress HIV-1 transcription and latency reactivation Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :858-872.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained by stimulation of PBMC cultures with 15 ng/mL recombinant human M-CSF and 10% human AB serum in RPMI supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) for 4 days. Then, the media was exchanged with DMEM supplemented with 15 ng/mL recombinant human M-CSF, 10% human AB serum, glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) for the following three days. Before infection, the medium was exchanged to 1% human AB serum containing medium.
Adult mouse dermal fibroblasts derived from ear tissue of Ppp1r12c +/+ or Ppp1r12c –/– mice (C57BL/6NJ mice, 6 weeks old) were generated after mincing and then treatment with 1000 U ml −1 collagenase followed by trypsinization. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 U ml −1 Pen-Strep.
Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were generated from the femurs of Ppp1r12c +/+ or Ppp1r12c −/− mice (C57BL/6NJ mice, 6-weeks old) by culturing them in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) media supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U ml −1 Pen-Strep, 1% (v/v) NEAA, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 25 μg/mL colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 as previously described ( Lutz et al., 1999 32. Lutz, M.B. ∙ Kukutsch, N. ∙ Ogilvie, A.L. ... An advanced culture method for generating large quantities of highly pure dendritic cells from mouse bone marrow J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223 :77-92 Crossref Scopus (2612) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ZIKV-GFP was generated from a BAC encoding the full-length genome of ZIKV-SPH2015 using BAC recombineering ( Tischer et al., 2010 58. Tischer, B.K. ∙ Smith, G.A. ∙ Osterrieder, N. En passant mutagenesis: a two step markerless red recombination system Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 634 :421-430 Crossref Scopus (441) PubMed Google Scholar ) to insert a reporter cassette containing the following elements directly upstream of the capsid gene: C1-33 (nucleotides encoding the first 33 amino acids of the capsid gene; containing the cyclization sequence) / GFP / GSG-linker sequence / P2A. Simultaneously, the native cyclization sequence in the full-length capsid gene was silently mutated. The virus was rescued by transfecting the ZIKV-SPH2015-GFP-BAC into HEK293T cells and once passaging on Vero E6 cells. Supernatant of Vero E6 cells was harvested after pronounced CPE was observed, then concentrated using 1000 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration (Vivaspin 20). ZIKV-GFP titer was determined on Vero cells by TCID 50 according to the Reed-Muench method ( Reed and Muench, 1938 43. Reed, L.J. ∙ Muench, H. A simple method of estimating fifty per cent endpoints12 Am. J. Epidemiol. 1938; 27 :493-497 Crossref Scopus (17555) Google Scholar ).
All procedures and assays involving live SCoV2 were performed in the BSL3 facilities at the Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center or the University of Ulm in accordance with institutional biosafety committee guidelines.
Ppp1r12c −/− mice (C57BL/6NJ background) used for this study were generated from ES cell clone 18962A-G1 by the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository and the Mouse Biology Program at the University of California Davis. Heterozygote mice were used for breeding and production of Ppp1r12c −/− and WT control mice. Mice were validated by genotyping as well as qRT-PCR analysis of Ppp1r12c transcript expression.
Mice were bred and maintained at the Animal Resources Center at the University of Chicago or the Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center. All mice were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility with a 12 h dark and light cycle and ad libitum access to standard chow diet and water. All mice used in this study were not involved in any other experimental procedure study and were in good health status. Age- and sex-matched 8-week-old mice were used for in vivo infection studies under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Chicago or the Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center.
R12C cDNA was subcloned into the pEF-IRES-puro vector between EcoRI and MluI containing a myc tag. Around-the-horn mutagenesis was performed to generate R12C N (aa 1-389), R12C C (aa 390-782), R12C NΔ95 (aa 95-782), R12C ΔAR2 (aa 1-132, 163-389), R12C ΔAR3 (aa 1-225, 256-389), and ΔAR4 (aa 1-258, 289-389. Rotavirus VP4-HA was generated by subcloning using as a template pEGFP-VP4CRL. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed as correct by DNA sequencing.
To generate R12C KO HEK293T cells, a dsDNA template was synthesized using overlap extension PCR with primers Overlap1-3 and the plasmid pKF274 ( Böttcher et al., 2014 5. Böttcher, R. ∙ Hollmann, M. ∙ Merk, K. ... Efficient chromosomal gene modification with CRISPR/cas9 and PCR-based homologous recombination donors in cultured Drosophila cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e89 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a template to generate a sgRNA template which contains the U6 snRNA promoter, followed by the R12C gRNA (sequence: 5′-CCA AGA AGC GCA CCA CCT CC-3′) and the sgRNA scaffold. Similarly, a double-stranded homologous recombination (HR) donor construct was synthesized using the plasmid pMH3-TK-BSD ( Böttcher et al., 2014 5. Böttcher, R. ∙ Hollmann, M. ∙ Merk, K. ... Efficient chromosomal gene modification with CRISPR/cas9 and PCR-based homologous recombination donors in cultured Drosophila cells Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :e89 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a template with the donor forward primer and donor reverse primer. HEK293T cells were transfected with the sgRNA template, the HR template, and Cas9 (pCas9_GFP). Three days later, cells were selected using 10 μg/mL blasticidin. Knockout of R12C was confirmed by IB to confirm the absence of R12C protein expression as well as by PCR to confirm insertion of the blasticidin resistance cassette.
Transient DNA transfections were performed using linear polyethylenimine (PEI) prepared as 1 mg/mL solution (in 10 mM Tris, pH 6.8) as previously described ( Koepke et al., 2020 27. Koepke, L. ∙ Winter, B. ∙ Grenzner, A. ... An improved method for high-throughput quantification of autophagy in mammalian cells Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :12241 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), calcium phosphate, Lipofectamine and PLUS reagent, or Lipofectamine2000 as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transient gene knockdown was achieved by using gene-specific siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA or individual siGENOME siRNAs. siRNA was transfected into cells seeded into 12-well plates (∼1 x 10 5 cells per well) via Lipofectamine RNAiMAX at a final concentration of 80 to 120 nM according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transient gene silencing in primary human macrophages was achieved by double-transfection of gene-specific siGENOME SMARTpool siRNA as previously described ( Hotter et al., 2019 24. Hotter, D. ∙ Bosso, M. ∙ Jønsson, K.L. ... IFI16 targets the transcription factor Sp1 to suppress HIV-1 transcription and latency reactivation Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :858-872.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, macrophages grown in 12-well plates were transfected at day 8 of differentiation with siRNA at a final concentration of 50 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX following manufacturer’s instructions. 20 h later, media was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS, glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin (100 mg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) and cells were re-transfected with the same siRNA for additional 40 h. Knockdown efficiency was determined by measuring the mRNA levels of the respective gene by qRT-PCR using gene-specific predesigned PrimeTime qPCR Probe Assays as indicated.
HEK293T cells, seeded into 12-well plates (∼1 x 10 5 cells per well), were transfected with 200 ng IFN-β luciferase reporter plasmid, 300 ng β-galactosidase (β-gal)-expressing pGK-β-gal plasmid, and the following amounts of effector plasmid: 400 ng GST-MDA5(2CARD), 2 ng GST-RIG-I(2CARD), 15 ng FLAG-MAVS, 500 ng FLAG-MDA5, or 50 ng FLAG-RIG-I. Luciferase and β-gal activities were determined at the indicated times after transfection using the Luciferase Assay System and β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System, respectively. Luminescence and absorbance were measured using a Synergy HT Microplate Reader (BioTek). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-gal values and fold induction was calculated relative to mock-transfected samples, set to 1.

Briefly, cells that were infected or transfected were lysed at the indicated times in Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM EDTA) or radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid (DOC), 0.1% (w/v) SDS) with protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were then cleared of cellular debris via centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. A portion of the cleared lysate was reserved for analysis of the whole cell lysate (WCL), while the remaining lysate was subjected to protein immunoprecipitation. Lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads, anti-FLAG agarose beads, anti-HA magnetic beads, or GST magnetic or agarose beads at 4 °C for 4-16 h. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous protein, cell lysates were probed overnight at 4°C with 1-2 μg/mL of primary antibody, followed by coupling to protein A, G, or A/G conjugated agarose or magnetic beads for an additional 2 h at 4°C. To detect the phosphorylation of RIG-I and MDA5, cells were treated with 50 nM calyculin A for 45 min prior to harvesting and cell lysis was carried out in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 and calyculin A. Beads were extensively washed with NP-40 or RIPA buffer and the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by heating samples in Laemmli SDS sample buffer at 95°C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved on 7-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, probed with the specified antibodies, and visualized as previously described ( Liu et al., 2021 31. Liu, G. ∙ Lee, J.H. ∙ Parker, Z.M. ... ISG15-dependent activation of the sensor MDA5 is antagonized by the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease to evade host innate immunity Nat.

Total RNA was extracted using the HP Total RNA Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and quantity of the extracted RNA were assessed using a NanoDrop Lite spectrophotometer. One-step qRT-PCR was performed with equal amounts of RNA using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit with ROX and commercially available predesigned PrimeTime qPCR Probe Assays on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System or QuantStudio 6. SCoV2 replication was assessed by RT-qPCR using a viral nucleocapsid gene specific primer and qPCR Probe Kit. The relative mRNA expression of the gene of interest was calculated by using the comparative threshold (ΔΔC t ) method and expressed relative to the values for control cells. Gene expression levels in the experiments involving SCoV2 infection were normalized to cellular 18S RNA. For all other experiments, gene expression levels were normalized to cellular GAPDH expression.
WT or R12C KO HEK293T cells (5 x 10 5 cells) were pre-chilled at 4°C for 30 min and then infected with IAV-GFP or VSV-GFP at the indicated MOI for 2 h at 4°C. Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 h. Cells were washed with PBS once and lysed in RLT Plus buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Total RNA was then isolated using the viral RNA Mini kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual genomic DNA was removed from RNA preparations using a DNA-free DNA removal kit. For all samples, equal RNA amounts were subjected to cDNA synthesis using the PrimeScript reverse transcription reagent kit. For the cDNA library generation, only the reverse primers were used to reverse transcribe initial gene expression, but not genome. Both reverse and forward primers for RPL4 (ribosomal protein L4) were added as an internal control. Reactions without reverse transcriptase were included as controls to exclude contamination with genomic DNA. cDNA was used for SYBR green PCRs using a PowerUp SYBR green master mix, and viral primer sets (forward and reverse) were used in reactions normalized for RPL4 mRNA levels as an internal control. The specificity of the different primers was assessed by testing the respective primer sets on infected and non-infected samples and loading the qRT-PCR products on 1% agarose gels to detect the viral amplified bands. 20 μL of SYBR green qRT-PCR products were separated on 1 % agarose gels (1 % agarose (w/v) in 1x TAE buffer) with the addition of ethidium bromide (0.2 μg/mL). After 35 min of electrophoresis at 140 V, DNA bands were visualized via the Gel Doc XR+ (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH) detection system.
Culture media collected from transfected or infected cells were centrifuged to remove cell debris. IFN-β levels in the culture supernatant were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercially available ELISA kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were infected with EMCV, VSV, VSV-GFP, DENV, ZIKV-GFP or SCoV2 in DMEM containing 2% (v/v) FBS at the indicated MOI. After 1-2 h, the inoculum was replaced with normal cell growth medium. IAV infection was carried out in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin for 2 h, after which cells were washed and the media replaced with supplemented DMEM.
EMCV titration was performed either on Vero cells using the Reed-Muench tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) methodology as previously described ( Sparrer et al., 2017 53.

Eight week-old, sex-matched Ppp1r12c +/+ and Ppp1r12c −/− mice were infected with 10 6 PFU of VSV (Indiana strain) via the intraperitoneal route. For survival studies, mice were monitored daily for disease progression and euthanized when humane endpoint criteria were reached as defined by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Virus replication in tissues was determined by plaque forming assay, or by determining VSV nucleocapsid transcripts by qRT-PCR. All mouse experiments were carried out in the BSL-2 animal facilities at The University of Chicago or the Cleveland Clinic Florida Research and Innovation Center with the approval of the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Infected or treated NHLF cells, grown on 12 mm-glass slides, were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) (in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Fixed samples were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized, and free binding sites blocked with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton-X100 and 5% (v/v) FBS for 30 min at RT. After extensive washing with PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-R12C or anti-RIG-I in PBS containing 1% (v/v) FBS on a rocking platform. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.25% Tween-20 and then incubated with the secondary antibodies anti-rabbit Alexa 568 and anti-mouse Alexa 488 (both 1:400) and, where indicated, also with DAPI (1:1000) and phalloidin-647 (1:200). Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.25% Tween-20 and once with ultrapure water, and then mounted using Mowiol mounting medium as previously described ( Koepke et al., 2020 27. Koepke, L. ∙ Winter, B. ∙ Grenzner, A. ... An improved method for high-throughput quantification of autophagy in mammalian cells Sci. Rep. 2020; 10 :12241 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Laser scanning confocal microscopy images were taken using a Leica SP8 system or a Zeiss LSM 710. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated automatically in ImageJ using 135 x 135 μm (2048 x 2048 px) large individual images from random locations on the slide using ImageJ’s coloc 2 algorithm.
NHLF or SAEC cells grown on 12 mm-glass slides were infected with virus or treated as indicated. At the indicated times after infection/treatment, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA (in PBS) for 20 min at RT. PLA was performed as described previously ( Volcic et al., 2020 61. Volcic, M. ∙ Sparrer, K.M.J. ∙ Koepke, L. ... Vpu modulates DNA repair to suppress innate sensing and hyper-integration of HIV-1 Nat.

HEK293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing YFP-tagged MLV gag and VSV-G using PEI. Cells transfected with empty vector were used as control. Six hours later, transfection medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% (v/v) FBS. At 48 h post transfection, the supernatant was harvested and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 1600 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The cleared supernatant was filtered through a membrane with a pore size of 0.45 μM, and YFP-gag-containing VLPs and total vesicles in the supernatant were quantified using a ZetaView BASIC NTA machine (Particle Metrix).
For generating cell lines inducibly expressing a RIG-I ligand, a 22-bp stem-loop RNA structure containing a blunt end ( Ablasser et al., 2009 1. Ablasser, A. ∙ Bauernfeind, F. ∙ Hartmann, G. ...

The synthetic gene fragment was cloned into a lentiviral vector pRSIT17 that contains the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and mTagGFP under a CMV promotor. Control RNA that does not activate RIG-I was generated by deleting the first two nucleotides in the 5' arm of the stem to create a hairpin RNA containing a 3' overhang as previously described ( Schlee et al., 2009 50. Schlee, M. ∙ Roth, A. ∙ Hornung, V. ... Recognition of 5′ triphosphate by RIG-I helicase requires short blunt double-stranded RNA as contained in panhandle of negative-strand virus Immunity. 2009; 31 :25-34 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar ). A549 cells inducibly expressing the 5'-triphosphorylated stem-loop with blunt-end (3p-SL blunt ) or 3'-overhang (3p-SL overhang ) were generated by lentiviral transduction in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene, followed by selection with 2 μg/mL puromycin. Two independent polyclonal cell lines were generated for each stem-loop RNA and validated as described below. RNA expression was induced by stimulating cells with 2 μg/mL Doxycycline for the indicated times, followed by treatment with actin-perturbing agents as indicated.
To quantify 3p-SL blunt or 3p-SL overhang RNA, total RNA was purified from cells using the miVana miRNA isolation kit. 3p-SL blunt and 3p-SL overhang RNA was quantified by a two-step TaqMan MicroRNA RT-qPCR Assay that included target-specific RT primer and qPCR primer-probe. TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit was used for cDNA synthesis. In vitro synthesized stem-loop RNA that was similarly converted to cDNA was used as a standard for the quantification of absolute RNA copies per cell. qRT-PCR was performed in a TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix using a QuantStudio 6 Pro Real Time PCR System.
All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 7). Statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t -test (unpaired) unless otherwise stated, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. A two-tailed Student’s t -test (unpaired) with Welch’s correction was used for analysis of PLA and Pearson correlation data.
