Title: Structural basis of γ-secretase inhibition and modulation by small molecule drugs


Abstract: Summary

Development of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs) represents an attractive therapeutic opportunity for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cancers. However, how these GSIs and GSMs target γ-secretase has remained largely unknown. Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human γ-secretase bound individually to two GSI clinical candidates, Semagacestat and Avagacestat, a transition state analog GSI L685,458, and a classic GSM E2012, at overall resolutions of 2.6–3.1 Å. Remarkably, each of the GSIs occupies the same general location on presenilin 1 (PS1) that accommodates the β strand from amyloid precursor protein or Notch, interfering with substrate recruitment. L685,458 directly coordinates the two catalytic aspartate residues of PS1. E2012 binds to an allosteric site of γ-secretase on the extracellular side, potentially explaining its modulating activity. Structural analysis reveals a set of shared themes and variations for inhibitor and modulator recognition that will guide development of the next-generation substrate-selective inhibitors.

Section: Introduction

The membrane-embedded γ-secretase cleaves the transmembrane domain (TM) of multiple signaling proteins exemplified by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch ( Beel and Sanders, 2008 8. Beel, A.J. ∙ Sanders, C.R. Substrate specificity of gamma-secretase and other intramembrane proteases Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65 :1311-1334 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; De Strooper et al., 1998 25. De Strooper, B. ∙ Saftig, P. ∙ Craessaerts, K. ...

A presenilin-1-dependent gamma-secretase-like protease mediates release of Notch intracellular domain Nature. 1999; 398 :518-522 Crossref Scopus (1865) PubMed Google Scholar ). APP is first cleaved by β-secretase in the extracellular space. The resulting C-terminal 99-residue fragment (APP-C99) is further proteolyzed by γ-secretase to generate an intracellular domain (AICD) and a 48- or 49-residue transmembrane peptide (Aβ48 or Aβ49) ( Takami et al., 2009 68. Takami, M. ∙ Nagashima, Y. ∙ Sano, Y. ... gamma-Secretase: successive tripeptide and tetrapeptide release from the transmembrane domain of beta-carboxyl terminal fragment J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :13042-13052 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). Aβ48 and Aβ49 are then trimmed every three or four residues by γ-secretase, generating Aβ peptides of varying lengths and byproducts of diverse tri- and tetra-peptides ( Takami et al., 2009 68. Takami, M. ∙ Nagashima, Y. ∙ Sano, Y. ... gamma-Secretase: successive tripeptide and tetrapeptide release from the transmembrane domain of beta-carboxyl terminal fragment J. Neurosci. 2009; 29 :13042-13052 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accumulation of Aβ peptides leads to formation of β-amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ( Kidd, 1964 44. Kidd, M. Alzheimer’s Disease–an Electron Microscopical Study Brain. 1964; 87 :307-320 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ).
γ-Secretase contains four subunits: the catalytic subunit PS1 or PS2, Pen-2, APH-1, and nicastrin (NCT). The vast majority of familial AD-derived (FAD) mutations target PS1 and to a lesser extent PS2 and APP ( Citron et al., 1992 18. Citron, M. ∙ Oltersdorf, T. ∙ Haass, C. ...

An increased percentage of long amyloid beta protein secreted by familial amyloid beta protein precursor (beta APP717) mutants Science. 1994; 264 :1336-1340 Crossref Scopus (1395) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nearly all mutations result in aberrant proteolysis of APP ( Borchelt et al., 1996 11. Borchelt, D.R. ∙ Thinakaran, G. ∙ Eckman, C.B. ... Familial Alzheimer’s disease-linked presenilin 1 variants elevate Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio in vitro and in vivo Neuron. 1996; 17 :1005-1013 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1380) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations engendered the amyloid hypothesis ( Hardy and Higgins, 1992 39. Hardy, J.A. ∙ Higgins, G.A. Alzheimer’s disease: the amyloid cascade hypothesis Science. 1992; 256 :184-185 Crossref Scopus (5766) PubMed Google Scholar ), which suggests the Aβ oligomers and plaques to be a causative factor for AD development ( Cleary et al., 2005 19. Cleary, J.P. ∙ Walsh, D.M. ∙ Hofmeister, J.J. ... Natural oligomers of the amyloid-beta protein specifically disrupt cognitive function Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8 :79-84 Crossref Scopus (1548) PubMed Google Scholar ). This hypothesis predicts that inhibition of γ-secretase, which presumably reduces Aβ production and decreases accumulation of Aβ oligomers and plaques, may constitute an effective treatment for AD ( Golde et al., 2010 36. Golde, T.E. ∙ Petrucelli, L. ∙ Lewis, J. Targeting Abeta and tau in Alzheimer’s disease, an early interim report Exp. Neurol. 2010; 223 :252-266 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolfe, 2008 75. Wolfe, M.S. Gamma-secretase inhibition and modulation for Alzheimer’s disease Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2008; 5 :158-164 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Semagacestat, developed and code-named LY-450139 by Eli Lily ( Henley et al., 2009 40. Henley, D.B. ∙ May, P.C. ∙ Dean, R.A. ... Development of semagacestat (LY450139), a functional gamma-secretase inhibitor, for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2009; 10 :1657-1664 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar ), was the first γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that entered phase III clinical evaluation. In contrast to the encouraging earlier results ( Siemers et al., 2007 64. Siemers, E.R. ∙ Dean, R.A. ∙ Friedrich, S. ... Safety, tolerability, and effects on plasma and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta after inhibition of gamma-secretase Clin. Neuropharmacol. 2007; 30 :317-325 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), Semagacestat failed to show cognitive improvement in phase III but produced severe side effects ( Doody et al., 2013 28. Doody, R.S. ∙ Raman, R. ∙ Farlow, M. ..., Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Steering Committee, Semagacestat Study Group A phase 3 trial of semagacestat for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease N. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369 :341-350 Crossref Scopus (942) PubMed Google Scholar ). The side effects are attributed to cleavage inhibition of other substrates such as Notch ( Aster et al., 2017 4. Aster, J.C. ∙ Pear, W.S. ∙ Blacklow, S.C. The Varied Roles of Notch in Cancer Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2017; 12 :245-275 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ; Doody et al., 2015 29.

Ther. 2015; 7 :36 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). To address this problem, substrate-specific GSIs have been developed as exemplified by the Notch-sparing GSIs ( Gillman et al., 2010 35. Gillman, K.W. ∙ Starrett, Jr., J.E. ∙ Parker, M.F. ...

Discovery of begacestat, a Notch-1-sparing gamma-secretase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease J. Med. Chem. 2008; 51 :7348-7351 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). A representative clinical candidate Avagacestat (known as BMS-708163) preferentially inhibited the cleavage of APP over Notch ( Gillman et al., 2010 35. Gillman, K.W. ∙ Starrett, Jr., J.E. ∙ Parker, M.F. ... Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, high doses of Avagacestat still inhibit Notch cleavage and exhibit toxicity ( Coric et al., 2012 20. Coric, V. ∙ van Dyck, C.H. ∙ Salloway, S. ... Safety and tolerability of the γ-secretase inhibitor avagacestat in a phase 2 study of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease Arch.

Targeting Prodromal Alzheimer Disease With Avagacestat: A Randomized Clinical Trial JAMA Neurol. 2015; 72 :1324-1333 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ).
GSIs are classified into transition state analog (TSA) and non-TSA based on mechanisms of inhibition ( Esler et al., 2000 31. Esler, W.P. ∙ Kimberly, W.T. ∙ Ostaszewski, B.L. ... Transition-state analogue inhibitors of gamma-secretase bind directly to presenilin-1 Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2 :428-434 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tagami et al., 2017 67.

Wolfe, M.S. γ-Secretase inhibitors and modulators for Alzheimer’s disease J. Neurochem. 2012; 120 :89-98 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Semagacestat and Avagacestat are both non-competitive non-TSA inhibitors ( Karran and Hardy, 2014 43. Karran, E. ∙ Hardy, J. A critique of the drug discovery and phase 3 clinical programs targeting the amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer disease Ann.

Neurochem. 2012; 120 :89-98 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the small molecule L685,458 is a widely studied competitive TSA ( Gillman et al., 2010 35. Gillman, K.W. ∙ Starrett, Jr., J.E. ∙ Parker, M.F. ... Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor ACS Med. Chem.

L685,458 directly binds the active site of PS1 ( Esler et al., 2000 31. Esler, W.P. ∙ Kimberly, W.T. ∙ Ostaszewski, B.L. ...

In addition to GSIs, γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) have also been recognized as an attractive class of small molecules for alleviating the symptoms of AD ( Crump et al., 2013 23. Crump, C.J. ∙ Johnson, D.S. ∙ Li, Y.M.

GSMs may promote further cleavage of Aβ42, thus reducing the amount of aggregation-prone Aβ peptides ( Pozdnyakov et al., 2013 56. Pozdnyakov, N. ∙ Murrey, H.E. ∙ Crump, C.J. ... γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :9710-9720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike GSIs, GSMs are recognized at a distinct allosteric site away from the active site of γ-secretase ( Pozdnyakov et al., 2013 56. Pozdnyakov, N. ∙ Murrey, H.E. ∙ Crump, C.J. ... γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :9710-9720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, a specific GSI may work with a GSM to achieve substrate-selective inhibition. The small molecule E2012 is a widely used classic member of the heterocyclic GSM family ( Kimura et al., 2005 46. Kimura, T. ∙ Kawano, K. ∙ Doi, E. ... Preparation of cinnamide, 3-benzylidenepiperidin-2-one, phenylpropynamide compounds as amyloid β production inhibitors. PCT Int. Appl. 2005, WO 2005115990 A1 20051208 2005 Google Scholar ).
The development of more specific GSIs necessitates mechanistic understanding of the general inhibition as well as substrate-selective inhibition. Improvement of GSMs requires structural information on their recognition by γ-secretase. Unfortunately, such information has remained largely unknown. To date, there is no atomic model on the recognition of any GSI or GSM by γ-secretase ( Bai et al., 2015a 5. Bai, X.C. ∙ Rajendra, E. ∙ Yang, G. ... Sampling the conformational space of the catalytic subunit of human γ-secretase eLife. 2015; 4 :e11182 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2014 51.

Structural interactions between inhibitor and substrate docking sites give insight into mechanisms of human PS1 complexes Structure. 2014; 22 :125-135 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we report the structural mechanism of γ-secretase inhibition by three distinct GSIs: Semagacestat, Avagacestat, and L685,458. We also report the atomic structure of γ-secretase bound to the GSM E2012 ( Kimura et al., 2005 46. Kimura, T. ∙ Kawano, K. ∙ Doi, E. ... Preparation of cinnamide, 3-benzylidenepiperidin-2-one, phenylpropynamide compounds as amyloid β production inhibitors. PCT Int. Appl. 2005, WO 2005115990 A1 20051208 2005 Google Scholar ).

Section: Results

Recombinant human γ-secretase was prepared as described ( Lu et al., 2014 53. Lu, P. ∙ Bai, X.C. ∙ Ma, D. ... Three-dimensional structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2014; 512 :166-170 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first examined inhibition of γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP-C99 and Notch by the GSIs ( Figure 1 ). In an in vitro assay, Semagacestat exhibited a similar potency for the cleavage inhibition of both APP-C99 and Notch ( Figure 1 A). Using the AlphaLisa assay, Semagacestat was found to display an inhibitory constant (IC 50 ) of 2.7 ± 0.9 μM for Aβ40 production ( Figure 1 B). In contrast, the other non-TSA inhibitor Avagacestat shows a clear preference for the cleavage inhibition of APP-C99 over Notch ( Figure 1 C), with an IC 50 of 16.7 ± 2.2 nM for Aβ40 production ( Figure 1 D). The TSA inhibitor L685,458 (hereafter referred to as L458) behaves similarly as Semagacestat ( Figure 1 E) but has a more potent IC 50 ( Figure 1 F).
An excess amount of Semagacestat was incubated with purified γ-secretase prior to cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) sample preparation. 1,978 micrographs were recorded using a K2 Summit detector mounted on a Titan Krios microscope, yielding 1,044,389 particles ( Figure S1 A). Following two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) classifications, 323,861 particles yielded a final reconstruction of Semagacestat-bound γ-secretase at an average resolution of 3.0 Å ( Figures 2 A and S1 B; Table S1 ). An isolated density lobe, which is located next to the β2 strand of PS1, was assigned to Semagacestat ( Figures 2 B and S1 C).
Remarkably, Semagacestat occupies exactly the same location as the β strand of APP-C99 or Notch-100 ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 C). This structural finding provides an immediate and satisfactory explanation to γ-secretase inhibition by Semagacestat. Because formation of a hybrid β sheet between PS1 and the substrate is essential for its cleavage ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), occupation of this site by Semagacestat may hinder formation of the hybrid β sheet and thereby inhibits substrate cleavage.
Semagacestat is located in a deep cavity on the intracellular side of PS1 ( Figure 2 C). This cavity is surrounded by strand β2, TM6a, the C-terminal portion of TM8, and the ensuing PAL motif (Pro433-Ala434-Leu435) that is important for substrate binding ( Sato et al., 2008 59. Sato, C. ∙ Takagi, S. ∙ Tomita, T. ... The C-terminal PAL motif and transmembrane domain 9 of presenilin 1 are involved in the formation of the catalytic pore of the gamma-secretase J. Neurosci. 2008; 28 :6264-6271 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). Semagacestat makes four specific hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) to the main chain groups of Lys380 on strand β2 and Leu432 just preceding the PAL motif ( Figure 2 D, left panel). These two residues are similarly involved in recognition of the APP-C99 or Notch β strand ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this regard, Semagacestat acts just like the substrate β strand.
Semagacestat uses its hydroxyl group to donate an H-bond to the carboxylate oxygen of Asp385 ( Figure 2 D, left panel). Intriguingly, the carboxylate side chains of the catalytic residues Asp257 and Asp385 are separated by a distance of only 4.8 Å. This distance is close to that of an activated aspartate protease, suggesting preservation of an activated conformation of PS1 in the inhibitor-bound state. Semagacestat also makes a number of van der Waals contacts to surrounding hydrophobic residues ( Figure 2 D, right panel). Specific coordination of Semagacestat leaves several small crevices that may accommodate additional chemical groups ( Figure S1 D). For example, additional small hydrophobic groups might fill the hydrophobic space around Val261 and Val272 ( Figure S1 E). Such modification is likely to result in improved specificity and inhibition potency.
In contrast to Semagacestat, Avagacestat prefers the cleavage inhibition of APP-C99 over Notch, with the reported preference of inhibition ranging from 3-fold to 193-fold ( Chávez-Gutiérrez et al., 2012 15. Chávez-Gutiérrez, L. ∙ Bammens, L. ∙ Benilova, I. ... The mechanism of γ-Secretase dysfunction in familial Alzheimer disease EMBO J. 2012; 31 :2261-2274 Crossref Scopus (423) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crump et al., 2012 22. Crump, C.J. ∙ Castro, S.V. ∙ Wang, F. ... BMS-708,163 targets presenilin and lacks notch-sparing activity Biochemistry. 2012; 51 :7209-7211 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gillman et al., 2010 35. Gillman, K.W. ∙ Starrett, Jr., J.E. ∙ Parker, M.F. ... Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). How substrate selectivity is conferred remains largely unknown. Notably, the chemical identity of Avagacestat is quite different from that of Semagacestat ( Figure 3 A, left panel), raising the possibility that Avagacestat may bind to a location that is different from that by Semagacestat. We prepared Avagacestat-bound human γ-secretase and collected 6,266 micrographs. An initial dataset of 835,806 particles were subject to 2D and 3D classifications, yielding a final reconstruction of the Avagacestat-bound γ-secretase at an average resolution of 3.1 Å ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ).
The local EM density for Avagacestat displays a characteristic three-pronged appearance ( Figure 3 A, right panel). Orientational assignment of Avagacestat is facilitated by the reported crosslinking experiment in which a photo-clickable derivative on the oxadiazole group of Avagacestat was covalently linked to Leu282 of PS1 ( Gertsik et al., 2017 34. Gertsik, N. ∙ Am Ende, C.W. ∙ Geoghegan, K.F. ... Mapping the Binding Site of BMS-708163 on γ-Secretase with Cleavable Photoprobes Cell Chem. Biol. 2017; 24 :3-8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Once the oxadiazole group was assigned, there is only one option of fitting the other two branches into the EM density due to their chemical nature ( Figure 3 A). For convenience, the three branches that contain the trifluoropentanamide, chlorophenyl, and oxadiazole fluorobenzyl groups will be described as the thumb, index, and stem, respectively ( Figure 3 A).
Because of marked differences in chemical identity and inhibition preference ( Gillman et al., 2010 35. Gillman, K.W. ∙ Starrett, Jr., J.E. ∙ Parker, M.F. ... Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 ), we had anticipated a different binding location for Avagacestat compared to Semagacestat. Much to our surprise, Avagacestat is recognized in exactly the same deep cavity as Semagacestat ( Figure 3 B) and occupies the same general location as the β strand of APP-C99 or Notch-100 ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, Avagacestat also inhibits γ-secretase by impeding formation of the hybrid β sheet.
The detailed binding modes, however, are different between Avagacestat and Semagacestat, which may underlie differences in substrate inhibition. Avagacestat interacts mostly with surrounding hydrophobic residues of PS1, with only one H-bond to the amide group of Gly382 ( Figure 3 C) ( Gertsik et al., 2017 34. Gertsik, N. ∙ Am Ende, C.W. ∙ Geoghegan, K.F. ... Mapping the Binding Site of BMS-708163 on γ-Secretase with Cleavable Photoprobes Cell Chem. Biol. 2017; 24 :3-8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, Semagacestat is anchored to the binding pocket through four H-bonds ( Figure 2 D). The trifluoropentanamide group of Avagacestat—the tip of the thumb—is nestled in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Val261, Leu268, and Val272 on the N-terminal fragment (NTF) of PS1 ( Figure 3 C, left panel). The chlorophenyl group—the tip of the index—is surrounded by Leu418, Thr421, Leu425, and Ala434 through van der Waals contacts on the C-terminal fragment (CTF) of PS1 ( Figure 3 C, middle panel). The stem of Avagacestat only associates with PS1 on one side of the oxadiazole fluorobenzyl group ( Figure 3 C, right panel), leaving the other side spatially available for modifications ( Figure 3 D). This analysis identifies potential sites of chemical modification for enhanced binding and inhibition.
The overall structures of Semagacestat- and Avagacestat-bound γ-secretase can be superimposed to that of ligand-free γ-secretase with root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of 1.01 and 1.03 Å for 205 and 206 aligned Cα atoms of PS1, respectively. Binding by either inhibitor triggers pronounced local changes in PS1 ( Figure 4 A). Compared to ligand-free γ-secretase ( Bai et al., 2015b 6. Bai, X.C. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Yang, G. ... An atomic structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2015; 525 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ), positional shifts mainly occur to loop-1, TM2, TM6, loop-2, and the PAL motifs of PS1 in the inhibitor-bound γ-secretase. In both cases, TM6 is shifted toward the center of PS1 and forms an additional α-helix TM6a, the PAL loop moves 5–7 Å to interact with the inhibitor, and two strands β1 and β2 are formed within loop-2. These structural changes collectively result in a more compact conformation of PS1 upon inhibitor binding ( Figure 4 A).
Next, we compared the Semagacestat- and Avagacestat-bound PS1 structures. The overall structures are quite similar, with an RMSD of 0.61 Å for 306 aligned Cα atoms of PS1. The conformational differences are restricted to local structures ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Around the inhibitor-binding pocket, TM6a and the PAL loop in the Semagacestat-bound γ-secretase are located 2–3 Å closer to the bound inhibitor than the Avagacestat-bound γ-secretase. Semagacestat has a smaller molecular weight than Avagacestat. Both the long axis and the plane of Semagacestat run approximately parallel with strand β2 of PS1 ( Figures 4 A and 4C). In contrast, the long axis of Avagacestat, as defined by the tips of index and stem, extends a 45° angle with that of Semagacestat ( Figure 4 C). The plane of Avagacestat lies flat in the deep cavity, pushing TM6a and the PAL loop away from the center of PS1 compared to Semagacestat ( Figures 4 A and 4D). The bulkier Avagacestat appears to be more disruptive to the local conformation of PS1 than Semagacestat.
The fact that two chemically distinct inhibitors, Semagacestat and Avagacestat, occupy the same general location in PS1 raises the question of whether this feature applies to other GSIs. Unlike the non-TSA inhibitors Semagacestat and Avagacestat ( Karran and Hardy, 2014 43. Karran, E. ∙ Hardy, J. A critique of the drug discovery and phase 3 clinical programs targeting the amyloid hypothesis for Alzheimer disease Ann. Neurol. 2014; 76 :185-205 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wolfe, 2012 76. Wolfe, M.S. γ-Secretase inhibitors and modulators for Alzheimer’s disease J. Neurochem. 2012; 120 :89-98 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), L458 is a competitive TSA inhibitor and directly binds the active site of PS1 ( Esler et al., 2000 31. Esler, W.P. ∙ Kimberly, W.T. ∙ Ostaszewski, B.L. ... Transition-state analogue inhibitors of gamma-secretase bind directly to presenilin-1 Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2 :428-434 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tian et al., 2010 69. Tian, Y. ∙ Bassit, B. ∙ Chau, D. ... An APP inhibitory domain containing the Flemish mutation residue modulates gamma-secretase activity for Abeta production Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :151-158 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). We incubated human γ-secretase with an excess amount of L458 and collected cryo-EM data. The final reconstruction of γ-secretase bound to L458 was obtained at an overall resolution of 3.1 Å using 320,661 selected particles ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and S3 ; Table S1 ).
L458 is bound to PS1 in the same general location as Semagacestat and Avagacestat ( Figure 5 B). The polar groups of L458 form a total of seven H-bonds with six residues in PS1: Lys380, Gly382, Gly384, Lys432, and two catalytic aspartates ( Figure 5 C). Consistent with prediction ( Esler et al., 2000 31. Esler, W.P. ∙ Kimberly, W.T. ∙ Ostaszewski, B.L. ... Transition-state analogue inhibitors of gamma-secretase bind directly to presenilin-1 Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2 :428-434 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ), the hydroxyl group of L458 is positioned in the middle between the catalytic residues Asp257 and Asp385 ( Figure 5 C). Presumably the hydroxyl group donates an H-bond to the carboxylate oxygen atom of one Asp, whereas the carboxylate group of the other Asp must be protonated to donate an H-bond back to the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group. Such arrangement confirms the TSA status of L458, which blocks formation of the gem-diol intermediate during substrate proteolysis ( Esler et al., 2002 32. Esler, W.P. ∙ Kimberly, W.T. ∙ Ostaszewski, B.L. ... Activity-dependent isolation of the presenilin- gamma -secretase complex reveals nicastrin and a gamma substrate Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :2720-2725 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to these H-bonds, L458 is also recognized by a number of hydrophobic residues ( Figure 5 D). Most notably, among these residues, Ile143, Ile253, Tyr256, and Phe388 are unique to L458 recognition and uninvolved in the coordination of Semagacestat or Avagacestat.
Derivatives of L458 have been widely used to probe the active site and conformational alterations of PS1 potentially caused by FAD mutations ( Chau et al., 2012 14. Chau, D.M. ∙ Crump, C.J. ∙ Villa, J.C. ... Familial Alzheimer disease presenilin-1 mutations alter the active site conformation of γ-secretase J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :17288-17296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). L458 has five side groups: P1, P2, P1′, P2′, and P3′, which are recognized by five corresponding subsites in PS1: S1, S2, S1′, S2′, and S3′ ( Chau et al., 2012 14. Chau, D.M. ∙ Crump, C.J. ∙ Villa, J.C. ... Familial Alzheimer disease presenilin-1 mutations alter the active site conformation of γ-secretase J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :17288-17296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 A). Our atomic model allows identification of these five subsites around the active site of PS1 ( Figures 5 E and S4 A). Notably, P1 and P2 reach into the large cavity that accommodates the TM of the substrate ( Chau et al., 2012 14. Chau, D.M. ∙ Crump, C.J. ∙ Villa, J.C. ...

Chem. 2012; 287 :17288-17296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas P1′, P2′, and P3′ occupy the pocket for substrate β strand.
Structure superimposition between L458-bound PS1 and the non-TSA inhibitor bound PS1 reveals a shared binding pocket that coincides with the substrate β strand ( Figure 5 F, left and middle panels). This comparison unveils a second binding pocket that is unique to L458 ( Figure 5 F, right panel). The second pocket corresponds to the S2 subsite for L458 and is formed mainly by the four hydrophobic residues that are unique to L458 recognition ( Figure S4 A, left panel). Because this pocket is located above the active site and further into the core of PS1, it is conceivable that a TSA inhibitor may engage this pocket to stabilize its H-bonds with the catalytic Asp residues.
Three chemically distinct GSIs, including the TSA L458 and the non-TSA Semagacestat and Avagacestat, all occupy the same binding pocket in PS1 that is otherwise occupied by the substrate β strand. We superimposed the inhibitor-bound PS1 with the substrate-bound PS1, which reveals a generally matching pattern between the side groups of the inhibitors and the side chains of the substrate β strand. Remarkably, three distinct chemical groups of Semagacestat exactly overlap with the three side chains in the substrate β strand, Val721-Met722-Leu723 in APP or Leu1755-Leu1756-Ser1757 in Notch ( Figure 6 A). Similar to Semagacestat, the P1′, P2′, and P3′ groups of L458 overlap with the three side chains in the substrate β strand ( Figure 6 B). The thumb and index of Avagacestat occupy the positions of Val721-Met722 of APP or Leu1755-Leu1756 of Notch, respectively; the stem, however, deviates markedly away from the β strand ( Figure 6 C).
Both Semagacestat and L458 display clear features of peptide and can be viewed as peptidomimetics. Based on this analysis, we postulate that the binding pocket of PS1 for the substrate β strand also serves as a shared binding site for all peptidomimetics-based inhibitors and other GSIs with similar features. The peptidomimetics-based GSIs may include RO4929097, which was used in clinical treatment of solid tumors ( Tolcher et al., 2012 70. Tolcher, A.W. ∙ Messersmith, W.A. ∙ Mikulski, S.M. ...

Phase I pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic study of the gamma secretase (Notch) inhibitor MK-0752 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors J. Clin.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317 :786-790 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S4 B).
Relying on the atomic coordinates of γ-secretase bound to substrate ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), the binding mode of L458 by PS1 was correctly predicted by a molecular dynamics simulation ( Hitzenberger and Zacharias, 2019 41. Hitzenberger, M. ∙ Zacharias, M. Uncovering the Binding Mode of γ -Secretase Inhibitors ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2019; 10 :3398-3403 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural comparison reveals an RMSD of 1.60 Å over 296 aligned Cα atoms between the simulated PS1 and our structurally observed PS1, with some notable changes at the inhibitor binding pocket and the loop-1 region ( Figure S4 C). In fact, the cryo-EM structure of the DAPT-bound human γ-secretase was already determined ( Bai et al., 2015a 5. Bai, X.C. ∙ Rajendra, E. ∙ Yang, G. ... Sampling the conformational space of the catalytic subunit of human γ-secretase eLife. 2015; 4 :e11182 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ); due to limited resolution, neither DAPT nor the β sheet was modeled in the structure. Re-examination of the EM map suggests formation of the hybrid β sheet and placement of DAPT in the substrate β strand binding pocket.
Understanding the mechanism of action by GSMs may improve the chance of designing substrate-selective GSI. In particular, GSMs may synergize with GSIs to improve the inhibition of substrate cleavage by γ-secretase. Indeed, the TSA L458 alone at 5 nM or the GSM E2012 alone at 50 μM only led to modest inhibition of APP-C99 cleavage by γ-secretase ( Figure 7 A, lanes 1–3); L458 and E2012 together nearly abolished the cleavage (lane 4). This result is consistent with the published observation that E2012 binding is enhanced by L458 ( Pozdnyakov et al., 2013 56. Pozdnyakov, N. ∙ Murrey, H.E. ∙ Crump, C.J. ... γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :9710-9720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). To identify the allosteric site for E2012, we incubated γ-secretase simultaneously with L458 and E2012 during sample preparation. After data collection and processing, we eventually obtained a final reconstruction of human γ-secretase bound to E2012 and L458 at an atomic resolution of 2.6 Å using 234,427 selected particles ( Figures 7 B, 7C, and S5 ; Table S1 ).
E2012 binds to γ-secretase at the interface between PS1 and NCT on the extracellular side ( Figure 7 C). The 419-Da E2012 contains four rings that are divided into two groups: the methylimidazole and phenyl group and the fluorophenyl and piperidine group. The methylimidazole and phenyl group is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket formed by loop-1, TM3, TM5 of PS1, and a nearby loop of NCT ( Figure 7 C). The relatively hydrophobic E2012 makes van der Waals contacts to a number of surrounding residues, including Phe105, Phe176, Phe177, Ile180, Val236, and Tyr240 on PS1 and Ile242 and Asn243 on NCT ( Figure 7 C). The binding orientation of E2012 is stabilized by an H-bond between the methylimidazole and the side chain of Tyr106 on loop-1 of PS1. The observed binding mode of E2012 is consistent with published studies. Several residues in loop-1 of PS1, including Tyr106, were implicated in binding E2012 ( Cai et al., 2017 13. Cai, T. ∙ Yonaga, M. ∙ Tomita, T. Activation of γ-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1 J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :12272-12280 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chemical modifications of E2012 were all performed on the fluorophenyl side ( Bursavich et al., 2016 12. Bursavich, M.G. ∙ Harrison, B.A. ∙ Blain, J.F. Gamma Secretase Modulators: New Alzheimer’s Drugs on the Horizon? J. Med. Chem. 2016; 59 :7389-7409 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cai et al., 2017 13. Cai, T. ∙ Yonaga, M. ∙ Tomita, T.

Pozdnyakov, N. ∙ Murrey, H.E. ∙ Crump, C.J. ... γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :9710-9720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with its exposed nature ( Figure 7 C). Such modification has recently been used to identify a novel binding protein of γ-secretase ( Hur et al., 2020 42. Hur, J.Y. ∙ Frost, G.R. ∙ Wu, X. ... The innate immunity protein IFITM3 modulates γ-secretase in Alzheimer’s disease Nature. 2020; 586 :735-740 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our structure conclusively identifies an allosteric binding site for the modulator of γ-secretase ( Figure 7 D). The loop-1 of PS1 is known to interact with substrate proteins ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our structural finding that loop-1 also binds E2012 immediately connects modulator binding to substrate recruitment, suggesting how a modulator may impact on the active site of γ-secretase located 25 Å away ( Figure 7 D). E2012 acts as a cap to partially cover the space on the extracellular side of the substrate-binding tunnel ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Importantly, structural comparison of the E2012 binding cavity between the E2012/L458-bound and L458-bound γ-secretases reveals little conformational variation, except for the benzene ring rotation of Phe177 ( Figure 7 E). This analysis provides a plausible answer to the question why L458 enhances E2012 binding ( Cai et al., 2017 13. Cai, T. ∙ Yonaga, M. ∙ Tomita, T. Activation of γ-Secretase Trimming Activity by Topological Changes of Transmembrane Domain 1 of Presenilin 1 J. Neurosci. 2017; 37 :12272-12280 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ).
E2012 binding is predicted to trigger conformational or structural changes that affect substrate recruitment, but not inhibitor recruitment. To examine this scenario, we superimposed E2012-bound γ-secretase to that in complex with an APP fragment (PDB: 6IYC ) ( Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, the fluorophenyl and piperidine group of E2012 clashes with the N-terminal portion of the APP-TM ( Figures 7 F and 7G). Such a clash may engender two potential consequences: either make substrate recruitment more difficult or facilitate unwinding of the substrate TM helix, the latter of which likely results in additional movement of the APP-TM downward into the active site of PS1, increasing the possibility of cleaving Aβ into shorter fragments. This analysis is consistent with the observation that Aβ40 and Aβ42 were decreased, and Aβ38 was increased in the presence of E2012 ( Pozdnyakov et al., 2013 56. Pozdnyakov, N. ∙ Murrey, H.E. ∙ Crump, C.J. ... γ-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin J. Biol.

Section: Discussion

Reducing Aβ plaques represents an attractive, albeit controversial, strategy for the treatment of AD ( Crump et al., 2013 23. Crump, C.J. ∙ Johnson, D.S. ∙ Li, Y.M.

Neurochem. 2012; 120 :89-98 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Development of GSIs that are selective for cleavage inhibition of APP-C99, but not Notch or other substrate, is a pre-requisite for therapeutic treatment of AD. Conversely, GSIs that selectively target Notch cleavage may find applications in the treatment of certain cancers, including T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, desmoid tumor ( Wei et al., 2010 74.

Notch signaling: an emerging therapeutic target for cancer treatment Cancer Lett. 2015; 369 :20-27 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ). Application of Notch inhibitors should be cautious, due to the tumor-suppressive role of Notch in some scenarios such as squamous cell carcinoma ( Stransky et al., 2011 65. Stransky, N. ∙ Egloff, A.M. ∙ Tward, A.D. ... The mutational landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma Science. 2011; 333 :1157-1160 Crossref Scopus (2051) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The PS1-binding fragment from Notch-100 or APP-C99 contains three elements: an N-terminal loop, a transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal β strand. We already know, from previous studies ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2019 82. Zhou, R. ∙ Yang, G. ∙ Guo, X. ... Recognition of the amyloid precursor protein by human γ-secretase Science. 2019; 363 :eaaw0930 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), that the substrate β strand plays an essential role in guiding appropriate substrate cleavage. The β strand is located on the intracellular side and accessible to small-molecule inhibitors. Therefore, displacing the substrate β strand represents a convenient and structurally favored strategy for development of substrate-selective GSIs.
The GSI-binding residues are mainly located in the pocket that is formed by TM1-2, TM6-9, and β strands of PS1, but not TM3-5 ( Figure S4 D). The conformation of TM6a and the PAL motif in the Semagacestat- and L458-bound structures are nearly identical to that in the substrate-bound states. In contrast, Avagacestat induces a noticeable change in TM6a and the PAL motif, which rotates and moves away from the active site ( Figure 4 A). The DAPT-bound conformation of PS1 ( Bai et al., 2015a 5. Bai, X.C. ∙ Rajendra, E. ∙ Yang, G. ... Sampling the conformational space of the catalytic subunit of human γ-secretase eLife. 2015; 4 :e11182 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ) is more similar to that of the Semagacestat-bound γ-secretase, with subtle difference in the β sheet region and TM6a ( Figure S4 E).
The available structural information also provides a framework for understanding substrate-selective inhibition of γ-secretase by Avagacestat. Neither Semagacestat nor L458 displays any obvious substrate selectivity between APP-C99 and Notch-100 ( Figures 1 A and 1E). In contrast, Avagacestat exhibits a clear preference for cleavage inhibition of APP-C99 over Notch-100 ( Gillman et al., 2010 35. Gillman, K.W. ∙ Starrett, Jr., J.E. ∙ Parker, M.F. ... Discovery and Evaluation of BMS-708163, a Potent, Selective and Orally Bioavailable γ-Secretase Inhibitor ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1 :120-124 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 C). To understand the differences in mechanism of action, it is more meaningful to scrutinize the conformation of PS1 in the substrate-bound and inhibitor-bound states. Structural alignment among Semagacestat-bound PS1, L458-bound PS1, APP-C83-bound PS1, and Notch-100-bound PS1 reveals few differences in the local conformation of the inhibitor-binding pocket ( Figure 6 D). In contrast, Avagacestat binding causes a marked shift in the local conformation of TM6, TM6a, and PAL loop ( Figure 6 E). Compared to Semagacestat or L458, the binding of Avagacestat to PS1 is more disruptive and causes a larger degree of conformational changes ( Figures 6 D and 6E). This analysis suggests a thermodynamic penalty for Avagacestat binding compared to binding by Semagacestat or substrate to this region.
Both Semagacestat and L458 exactly overlap with the substrate β strand ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). In contrast, the stem of Avagacestat deviates markedly away from the β strand. Because the binding site of the substrate β strand is the target of inhibitor binding, preferential cleavage inhibition may be linked to sequence variation in the β strand of the substrate.
To further scrutinize the impact of the substrate β strand in cleavage inhibition, we purified six additional substrates of γ-secretase: CD43 ( Andersson et al., 2005 3. Andersson, C.X. ∙ Fernandez-Rodriguez, J. ∙ Laos, S. ... Shedding and gamma-secretase-mediated intramembrane proteolysis of the mucin-type molecule CD43 Biochem. J. 2005; 387 :377-384 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), CD44 ( Lammich et al., 2002 49. Lammich, S. ∙ Okochi, M. ∙ Takeda, M. ... Presenilin-dependent intramembrane proteolysis of CD44 leads to the liberation of its intracellular domain and the secretion of an Abeta-like peptide J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :44754-44759 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ), N-cadherin ( Uemura et al., 2006 71. Uemura, K. ∙ Kihara, T. ∙ Kuzuya, A. ... Characterization of sequential N-cadherin cleavage by ADAM10 and PS1 Neurosci. Lett. 2006; 402 :278-283 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), ErbB4 ( Vidal et al., 2005 72. Vidal, G.A. ∙ Naresh, A. ∙ Marrero, L. ... Presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase processing regulates multiple ERBB4/HER4 activities J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :19777-19783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CD33. Then, we examined Avagacestat-mediated cleavage inhibition of this substrate. On the basis of the predicted TMs and the positively charged residues at the juxta-membrane region, the sequences of these substrates are aligned with those of Notch and APP ( Figure S6 B). The β strand sequences of CD43 or CD44 are more reminiscent of those of Notch. Consistently, the cleavage of CD43 and CD44 is still clearly detectable in the presence of 500 nM Avagacestat ( Figure S6 C). In contrast, the cleavage of N-Cadherin, whose β strand sequences are more similar to those of APP, is abolished by as low as 5 nM Avagacestat ( Figure S6 C). The β strand sequences of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 ( Vidal et al., 2005 72. Vidal, G.A. ∙ Naresh, A. ∙ Marrero, L. ... Presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase processing regulates multiple ERBB4/HER4 activities J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :19777-19783 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) or the AD susceptibility protein CD33 ( Griciuc et al., 2019 38. Griciuc, A. ∙ Patel, S. ∙ Federico, A.N. ... TREM2 Acts Downstream of CD33 in Modulating Microglial Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuron. 2019; 103 :820-835 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ) comply with the generally hydrophobic feature of the APP β strand, but lack similarity in terms of side chain characteristics. At 200 nM, Avagacestat abrogated the cleavage of either substrate ( Figure S6 C). Therefore, the cleavage inhibition by Avagacestat correlates well with the sequences features of the substrate β strand. In addition, the inhibition of γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of N-cadherin, ErbB4, and CD33 by Avagacestat may alter the signaling pathways mediated by these proteins, which may contribute to dose-dependent toxicity in the clinical evaluation of Avagacestat.
We keenly recognize that the above correlation is highly speculative and its confirmation requires additional experimental data, because substrate cleavage is subject to additional layers of regulation. For example, the residues at the membrane interface and the ectodomain of substrates have been reported to affect the cleavage ( Bolduc et al., 2016 10. Bolduc, D.M. ∙ Montagna, D.R. ∙ Gu, Y. ... Nicastrin functions to sterically hinder γ-secretase-substrate interactions driven by substrate transmembrane domain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E509-E518 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Funamoto et al., 2013 33. Funamoto, S. ∙ Sasaki, T. ∙ Ishihara, S. ... Substrate ectodomain is critical for substrate preference and inhibition of γ-secretase Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2529 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tian et al., 2010 69. Tian, Y. ∙ Bassit, B. ∙ Chau, D. ... An APP inhibitory domain containing the Flemish mutation residue modulates gamma-secretase activity for Abeta production Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :151-158 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Aβ 17–23 peptide exhibits an inhibitory effect toward γ-secretase cleavage ( Tian et al., 2010 69. Tian, Y. ∙ Bassit, B. ∙ Chau, D. ... An APP inhibitory domain containing the Flemish mutation residue modulates gamma-secretase activity for Abeta production Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :151-158 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Substrate ectodomains with different lengths also have contrasting impact on the cleavage and inhibition of γ-secretase ( Funamoto et al., 2013 33. Funamoto, S. ∙ Sasaki, T. ∙ Ishihara, S. ... Substrate ectodomain is critical for substrate preference and inhibition of γ-secretase Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2529 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). One strategy that may mitigate these concerns involves swapping the β strand between two distinct substrates and examining the cleavage inhibition of the resulting chimeric substrates. Such a strategy allows assessment of the contribution by the substrate β strand only.
Semagacestat was reported to be a pseudo-GSI in cells and animals because it reduced the secreted Aβ but not intracellular Aβs ( Tagami et al., 2017 67. Tagami, S. ∙ Yanagida, K. ∙ Kodama, T.S. ... Semagacestat Is a Pseudo-Inhibitor of γ-Secretase Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :259-273 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). The different binding modes of TSA and non-TSAs may provide clues to understanding these observations. L458 directly targets the catalytic residues of PS1, which leads to “complete” inhibition. In addition, the varying strengths of interactions between the various inhibitors and PS1 translate into their varying stabilities of binding. The complex cell- and animal-based experimental systems ( Tagami et al., 2017 67. Tagami, S. ∙ Yanagida, K. ∙ Kodama, T.S. ... Semagacestat Is a Pseudo-Inhibitor of γ-Secretase Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :259-273 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) may engender unrecognized impact on the inhibitors. Nevertheless, we and others have unequivocally shown that Semagacestat is a potent inhibitor of γ-secretase in vitro , a conclusion confirmed by our structural observation. The failure of Semagacestat clinical evaluation may be caused by multiple factors, one of which is thought to be related to its dosing and kinetics ( De Strooper, 2014 24. De Strooper, B. Lessons from a failed γ-secretase Alzheimer trial Cell. 2014; 159 :721-726 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to its short half-life (2–3 h) ( Bateman et al., 2009 7. Bateman, R.J. ∙ Siemers, E.R. ∙ Mawuenyega, K.G. ... A gamma-secretase inhibitor decreases amyloid-beta production in the central nervous system Ann. Neurol. 2009; 66 :48-54 Crossref Scopus (295) PubMed Google Scholar ), Semagacestat must reach a high concentration in order to inhibit Aβ production under the “once-a-day” dosing regimen. The high concentration of Semagacestat, however, also results in cleavage inhibition of Notch and other substrates, which aggravate the side effects.
In this study, we also report the cryo-EM structure of human γ-secretase bound to the classic GSM E2012. Similar to GSIs, development of GSMs also represents an attractive strategy in clinical applications ( Bursavich et al., 2016 12. Bursavich, M.G. ∙ Harrison, B.A. ∙ Blain, J.F. Gamma Secretase Modulators: New Alzheimer’s Drugs on the Horizon? J. Med. Chem. 2016; 59 :7389-7409 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). GSIs may be used in combination with GSMs. Systematic structural investigations of both E2012 and three GSIs reveals valuable underpinnings for the design and improvement of substrate-selective small molecules. On one hand, because the fluorophenyl and piperidine group of E2012 mainly regulates the position and orientation of APP-TM, modification of this group may improve substrate selectivity ( Figure 7 H). On the other hand, because methylimidazole and phenyl group directly contacts PS1 and NCT, modification of this group may confer improved binding affinity for next-generation E2012-like GSMs ( Figure 7 H).
Notwithstanding the many outstanding questions, our current study unveils the molecular basis for recognition and mechanism of action of three representative GSIs and a classic GSM ( Figure S7 ). This information is likely instrumental to future design and optimization of GSIs and GSMs, which may ultimately lead to potent therapeutics targeting AD and/or cancers.

The EM maps of human γ-secretase bound to Semagacestat, Avagacestat, L458 and E2012/L458 have been deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) with the accession codes EMD-0957, EMD-0944, EMD-30312 and EMD-30614, respectively. The atomic coordinates for the corresponding models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession codes 6LR4, 6LQG, 7C9I and 7D8X.
We used HEK293F, a human embryonic kidney cell line purchased from Invitrogen, for protein production.
The suspended HEK293F cells were grown in SMM 293-TI medium (Sino Biological Inc., Cat# M293TI) supplemented with 1 × penicillin-streptomycin. Transient transfection was performed when the cell density reached ~2.0 × 10 6 cells/mL. The cells were maintained at 37°C with 130 rpm/min under 5% CO 2 .
We used E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen) for molecular cloning and plasmid preparation. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) were used for expression of γ-secretase substrates. Both cells were maintained at 37°C. E. coli BL21 (DE3) was induced at 22°C using isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when OD 600 reached 1.0.
All proteins used for the activity assay were sub-cloned, expressed and purified as described ( Lu et al., 2014 53. Lu, P. ∙ Bai, X.C. ∙ Ma, D. ... Three-dimensional structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2014; 512 :166-170 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293F cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktails (Amresco). After sonication, membrane fractions were collected through ultracentrifugation at 150,000 g, then resuspended by the same buffer mentioned above and supplemented with 1% CHAPSO and 0.1% digitonin. After incubation for 2 hours at 4°C, the suspension was centrifuged at 150,000 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant containing solubilized γ-secretase was incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel. The resin was washed three times using the buffer that contains 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% digitonin (Sigma). The γ-secretase was eluted using the same buffer supplemented with 200 μg/mL Flag peptide (GL Biochem). The eluted protein was concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off Centricon (Merck Millipore) and further purified using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, Superose-6 Increase, 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare).
For all γ-secretase substrates in this study, the transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37°C to a cell density of OD 600 ~1.0 and induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After 16 hours of induction at 22°C, the cells were collected, resuspended in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl, and disrupted through sonication. Following centrifugation at 27,000 g for 10 minutes, the supernatant was applied to ultracentrifugation at 150,000 g for 1 hour to collect the pellet. The membrane fractions was resuspended in the same buffer above and solubilized with 1.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) for 1 hour at 4°C. The suspension was centrifuged again at 150,000 g for 30 minutes and the supernatant was loaded to Ni 2+ -NTA affinity column (QIAGEN). After washing with the buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole, and 0.02% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) for three times, the substrates were eluted using the wash buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The proteins were concentrated and further purified by SEC (Superdex-200 10/30, GE Healthcare) in the buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% CHAPSO (Anatrace). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method.
In the reconstituted γ-secretase cleavage assay, 30 nM purified wild-type (WT) γ-secretase was incubated with 12.5 μM substrate (APP-C99, Notch-100, CD43, CD44, N-Cadherin, ErbB4, or CD33) in a reaction buffer that contains 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.2% CHAPSO, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine, 0.025% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 0.00625% (w/v) cholesterol ( Yang et al., 2019 78. Yang, G. ∙ Zhou, R. ∙ Zhou, Q. ... Structural basis of Notch recognition by human γ-secretase Nature. 2019; 565 :192-197 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cleavage reaction was conducted at 37°C for 3 hours. The cleaved products of these substrates were detected using a monoclonal antibody (CW0299, CWBio) against the C-terminal Myc tag. Aβ40 production was detected using the AlphaLISA assay (PerkinElmer) as described ( Bai et al., 2015b 6. Bai, X.C. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Yang, G. ... An atomic structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2015; 525 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ). The IC 50 values and the inhibition curves were calculated using Prism 7.0.
Wild-type human γ-secretase was expressed and purified as mentioned above ( Lu et al., 2014 53. Lu, P. ∙ Bai, X.C. ∙ Ma, D. ... Three-dimensional structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2014; 512 :166-170 Crossref Scopus (286) PubMed Google Scholar ). Semagacestat, Avagacestat, and L458 at 2.5 mM, 5 mM, and 5 mM, respectively, were incubated with 40 μM γ-secretase at 4°C for 0.5 hour. To obtain γ-secretase bound to both L458 and E2012, the two small molecules were incubated with γ-secretase at a final concentration of 5 mM each. Aliquots of 4 μl γ-secretase in complex with different ligands were dropped onto glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh). The grids were blotted for 3 s and flash-frozen in liquid ethane using Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI). For γ-secretase bound to the GSIs, the samples were imaged on an FEI 300 kV Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with a Cs corrector and Gatan GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20 eV), recorded by a Gatan K2 Summit detector with a nominal magnification of 105,000 ×. A series of defocus values from –1.5 to –1.8 μm was used during data collection. Each image was dose-fractionated to 32 frames with a total electron dose of ~50 e − Å −2 and a total exposure time of 5.6 s. AutoEMation II (developed by J. Lei) ( Lei and Frank, 2005 50. Lei, J. ∙ Frank, J. Automated acquisition of cryo-electron micrographs for single particle reconstruction on an FEI Tecnai electron microscope J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 150 :69-80 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for fully automated data collection. All stacks were motion-corrected using MotionCor2 with a binning factor of 2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 81. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in a pixel size of 1.091 Å. For γ-secretase bound to E2012 and L458, the procedure of data acquisition was the same except that the Gatan K3 Summit detector has a nominal magnification of 64,000 × and a pixel size of 1.0825 Å. The defocus values were estimated using Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 80. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ) and dose weighing was performed concurrently ( Grant and Grigorieff, 2015 37. Grant, T. ∙ Grigorieff, N. Measuring the optimal exposure for single particle cryo-EM using a 2.6 Å reconstruction of rotavirus VP6 eLife. 2015; 4 :e06980 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The four datasets corresponding to γ-secretase bound to Semagacestat, Avagacestat, L458, and E2012 were processed using a similar workflow ( Figures S1 , S3 , and S6 ). The movie stacks were manually selected after motion correction and CTF estimation for Semagacestat, Avagacestat, L458, and E2012, respectively. The density of particles for the Avagacestat-bound γ-secretase is considerably less than that for the Semagacestat-bound-γ-secretase. 1,044,389 for Semagacestat, 835,806 particles for Avagacestat, and 712,382 or 1,490,859 particles for L458 without or with E2012 were auto-picked using RELION-2.0 ( Bai et al., 2015b 6. Bai, X.C. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Yang, G. ... An atomic structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2015; 525 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kimanius et al., 2016 45.

A Bayesian view on cryo-EM structure determination J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415 :406-418 Crossref Scopus (598) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. After two-dimensional (2D) classification, 726,530, 518,551, 354,281, and 654,266 particles were selected and subjected to three-dimensional (3D) classification for Semagacestat, Avagacestat, and L458 in the absence and presence of E2012, respectively. In all cases, the γ-secretase EM map (EMD-3061) was low-pass filtered to 20 Å to generate an initial model ( Bai et al., 2015b 6. Bai, X.C. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Yang, G. ... An atomic structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2015; 525 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ). The selected particles were subject to 30 iterations of global angular search 3D classification. Each of the 30 iterations has one class and a step size of 7.5°. For the last six iterations (No. 25-30) of the global search, the local angular search 3D classification was executed with a class number of four, a step size of 3.75°, and a local search range of 15°. For the last 5 iterations of the local search, particles from the good classes were merged and duplicated particles were removed. The resulting 699,710, 490,958, 320,661, 532,244 particles were applied to auto-refinement, yielding 3D reconstructions at 3.2-Å, 3.5-Å, 3.4-Å, and 3.5-Å for Semagacestat-, Avagacestat-, L458-, and L458/E2012-bound γ-secretase, respectively.
Results of the initial refinement were then applied to further multi-reference 3D classification for Semagacestat-, Avagacestat-, and L458/E2012-bound γ-secretase. The box size was changed from 200 to 320 pixels. 323,861, 210,829, 234,427 particles from the good classes were applied to autorefinement, resulting in 3.0-Å, 3.1-Å, and 2.6-Å reconstruction for Semagacestat-, Avagacestat-bound, and L458/E2012-bound γ-secretase, based on the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion. For L458-bound γ-secretase, the box size was changed from 200 to 320 pixels, yielding a 3.1-Å map. The FSC curves were corrected for the effects of a soft mask using high-resolution noise substitution ( Chen et al., 2013 17. Chen, S. ∙ McMullan, G. ∙ Faruqi, A.R. ... High-resolution noise substitution to measure overfitting and validate resolution in 3D structure determination by single particle electron cryomicroscopy Ultramicroscopy. 2013; 135 :24-35 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local resolution variations were estimated using RELION-2.0 ( Kimanius et al., 2016 45. Kimanius, D. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ∙ Scheres, S.H. ... Accelerated cryo-EM structure determination with parallelisation using GPUs in RELION-2 eLife. 2016; 5 :e18722 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The structures of γ-secretase bound to Semagacestat, Avagacestat, L458, L458/E2012 were first refined in real space using PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2010 2. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18501) PubMed Google Scholar ) with secondary structure and geometry restraints. 2D structures of Semagacestat and Avagacestat were generated from the Pubchem database and initial geometry restraints were obtained through phenix.elbow new.sdf. Semagacestat, Avagacestat, L458, and E2012 were built in COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 30. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ) with their respective restraints. The atomic model was manually improved using COOT. The glycans, cholesterols, and phosphatidylcholines were identified as described ( Bai et al., 2015b 6. Bai, X.C. ∙ Yan, C. ∙ Yang, G. ... An atomic structure of human γ-secretase Nature. 2015; 525 :212-217 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final atomic model was refined in real space using PHENIX ( Adams et al., 2002 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Hung, L.W. ... PHENIX: building new software for automated crystallographic structure determination Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58 :1948-1954 Crossref Scopus (3845) PubMed Google Scholar ), and evaluated using MolProbity ( Chen et al., 2010 16. Chen, V.B. ∙ Arendall, 3rd, W.B. ∙ Headd, J.J. ... MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (11100) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The local resolution map was calculated using RELION 2.0 ( Kimanius et al., 2016 45. Kimanius, D. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ∙ Scheres, S.H. ... Accelerated cryo-EM structure determination with parallelisation using GPUs in RELION-2 eLife. 2016; 5 :e18722 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). Resolution estimations of all cryo-EM maps are based on the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) value of 0.143 ( Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003 58. Rosenthal, P.B. ∙ Henderson, R. Optimal determination of particle orientation, absolute hand, and contrast loss in single-particle electron cryomicroscopy J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333 :721-745 Crossref Scopus (1612) PubMed Google Scholar ). The details can be found in Figures S1 , S2 , S3 , and S5 .
Statistical analysis of Aβ40 was performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). IC 50 were determined by a four-parameter logistic regression. The statistical details can be found in Figures 1 B, 1D, and 1F and legends. Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
ImageJ was used for the quantification of AICD and NICD based on the mean gray value. Statistical analysis of AICD and NICD production was performed using Prism 7. IC 50 were determined by a four-parameter logistic regression, which can be found in Figures 1 A, 1C, and 1E and legends. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. The production of AICD in Figure 7 A was normalized. Error bar is SD.
