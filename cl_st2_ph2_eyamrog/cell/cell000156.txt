Title: RNA Sensing by Gut Piezo1 Is Essential for Systemic Serotonin Synthesis


Abstract: Summary

Gastrointestinal enterochromaffin cells regulate bone and gut homeostasis via serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) production. A recent report suggested that gut microbes regulate 5-HT levels; however, the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are unexplored. Here, we reveal that the cation channel Piezo1 in the gut acts as a sensor of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) governing 5-HT production. Intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of mouse Piezo1 profoundly disturbed gut peristalsis, impeded experimental colitis, and suppressed serum 5-HT levels. Because of systemic 5-HT deficiency, conditional knockout of Piezo1 increased bone formation. Notably, fecal ssRNA was identified as a natural Piezo1 ligand, and ssRNA-stimulated 5-HT synthesis from the gut was evoked in a MyD88/TRIF-independent manner. Colonic infusion of RNase A suppressed gut motility and increased bone mass. These findings suggest gut ssRNA as a master determinant of systemic 5-HT levels, indicating the ssRNA-Piezo1 axis as a potential prophylactic target for treatment of bone and gut disorders.

Section: Introduction

Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is critical for normal functioning of the CNS. 5-HT originates from both the brainstem neurons and the enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the gastrointestinal tract. Notably, 5-HT does not cross the blood-brain barrier ( Mann et al., 1992 43. Mann, J.J. ∙ McBride, P.A. ∙ Brown, R.P. ... Relationship between central and peripheral serotonin indexes in depressed and suicidal psychiatric inpatients Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 1992; 49 :442-446 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 95% of the body’s total 5-HT is secreted by EC cells, establishing the gut as the major source of peripheral 5-HT ( Gershon and Tack, 2007 27. Gershon, M.D. ∙ Tack, J. The serotonin signaling system: from basic understanding to drug development for functional GI disorders Gastroenterology. 2007; 132 :397-414 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Research attention has recently focused on the functions of gut-derived 5-HT. Most of the gut-derived 5-HT is absorbed by circulating platelets, which then release 5-HT in response to specific stimuli ( Amireault et al., 2013 4. Amireault, P. ∙ Sibon, D. ∙ Côté, F. Life without peripheral serotonin: insights from tryptophan hydroxylase 1 knockout mice reveal the existence of paracrine/autocrine serotonergic networks ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2013; 4 :64-71 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to activation of various biological phenomena such as platelet aggregation ( Mercado et al., 2013 46. Mercado, C.P. ∙ Quintero, M.V. ∙ Li, Y. ... A serotonin-induced N-glycan switch regulates platelet aggregation Sci. Rep. 2013; 3 :2795 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), gut peristalsis ( Mawe and Hoffman, 2013 45. Mawe, G.M. ∙ Hoffman, J.M. Serotonin signalling in the gut--functions, dysfunctions and therapeutic targets Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2013; 10 :473-486 Crossref Scopus (795) PubMed Google Scholar ), and bowel inflammation ( Ghia et al., 2009 28. Ghia, J.E. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Wang, H. ... Serotonin has a key role in pathogenesis of experimental colitis Gastroenterology. 2009; 137 :1649-1660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ). A small fraction of gut-derived 5-HT remains free in the serum and acts as a hormone ( Rand and Reid, 1951 56. Rand, M. ∙ Reid, G. Source of ‘serotonin’ in serum Nature. 1951; 168 :385 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). For instance, osteoblasts express several 5-HT receptor subtypes and their proliferation is inhibited by 5-HT. Specific intestinal epithelium deletion of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 ( Tph1 ), encoding a synthase that generates 5-HT from tryptophan, led to a high bone mass phenotype accompanied by low serum 5-HT levels ( Yadav et al., 2008 67. Yadav, V.K. ∙ Ryu, J.H. ∙ Suda, N. ... Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting serotonin synthesis in the duodenum Cell. 2008; 135 :825-837 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (724) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results are consistent with findings that patients with depressive disorder taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which increase the extracellular concentration of 5-HT, have reduced bone mass ( Kumar et al., 2019 35. Kumar, M. ∙ Jiloha, R.C. ∙ Kataria, D. ... Effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on markers of bone loss Psychiatry Res. 2019; 276 :39-44 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the pleiotropic importance of gut-derived 5-HT, the molecular mechanisms controlling 5-HT production in EC cells remain largely unknown. A recent report suggested that spore-forming bacteria from the microbiota promote 5-HT biosynthesis from EC cells ( Yano et al., 2015 70. Yano, J.M. ∙ Yu, K. ∙ Donaldson, G.P. ... Indigenous bacteria from the gut microbiota regulate host serotonin biosynthesis Cell. 2015; 161 :264-276 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, several fecal metabolites that induce 5-HT production from EC cells were identified ( Yano et al., 2015 70. Yano, J.M. ∙ Yu, K. ∙ Donaldson, G.P. ... Indigenous bacteria from the gut microbiota regulate host serotonin biosynthesis Cell. 2015; 161 :264-276 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2354) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that intestinal microbes and their metabolic products are promising trigger candidates of 5-HT production from EC cells.
Sensation of the mechanical forces in the gut is critical for normal peristalsis, but their molecular mechanisms remain elusive ( Linan-Rico et al., 2016 39. Linan-Rico, A. ∙ Ochoa-Cortes, F. ∙ Beyder, A. ... Mechanosensory Signaling in Enterochromaffin Cells and 5-HT Release: Potential Implications for Gut Inflammation Front. Neurosci. 2016; 10 :564 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanosensitive Piezo1 and Piezo2 cation channels were recently identified ( Coste et al., 2010 15.

Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1965) PubMed Google Scholar ), and were subsequently found to be expressed in various tissues playing a critical role in mechanotransduction during vascular development ( Li et al., 2014 38.

Previous studies suggested that gain-of function mutations in Piezo1 are associated with dehydrated hereditary xerocytosis, a rare genetic disease characterized by red blood cell dehydration with mild hemolysis ( Albuisson et al., 2013 2. Albuisson, J. ∙ Murthy, S.E. ∙ Bandell, M. ... Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis linked to gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated PIEZO1 ion channels Nat.

Mutations in the mechanotransduction protein PIEZO1 are associated with hereditary xerocytosis Blood. 2012; 120 :1908-1915 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). Patients with hereditary xerocytosis are also resistant to Plasmodium infection ( Ma et al., 2018 41. Ma, S. ∙ Cahalan, S. ∙ LaMonte, G. ... Common PIEZO1 Allele in African Populations Causes RBC Dehydration and Attenuates Plasmodium Infection Cell. 2018; 173 :443-455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Structural analysis revealed that Piezo1 can form a homotrimer with an extracellular domain consisting of a propeller-like structure that acts as a membrane stretch sensor, which is suggested to be involved in gating the ion conductive pore ( Ge et al., 2015 24. Ge, J. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Zhao, Q. ... Architecture of the mammalian mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel Nature. 2015; 527 :64-69 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). The small compound Yoda1 activates Piezo1 in the absence of a mechanical force ( Syeda et al., 2015 64. Syeda, R. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Dubin, A.E. ... Chemical activation of the mechanotransduction channel Piezo1 eLife. 2015; 4 :e07369 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ), and mechanical activation of Piezo1 can be blocked by GsMTx4, a peptide isolated from the tarantula spider ( Bae et al., 2011 7. Bae, C. ∙ Sachs, F. ∙ Gottlieb, P.A. The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is inhibited by the peptide GsMTx4 Biochemistry. 2011; 50 :6295-6300 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to Piezo1, Piezo2 is involved in gentle touch sensing and is highly expressed in Merkel cells in the skin ( Chesler et al., 2016 12. Chesler, A.T. ∙ Szczot, M. ∙ Bharucha-Goebel, D. ... The Role of PIEZO2 in Human Mechanosensation N. Engl. J. Med. 2016; 375 :1355-1364 Crossref Scopus (260) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maksimovic et al., 2014 42.

Epidermal Merkel cells are mechanosensory cells that tune mammalian touch receptors Nature. 2014; 509 :617-621 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent report also suggested that Piezo2 senses airway stretch ( Nonomura et al., 2017 48. Nonomura, K. ∙ Woo, S.H. ∙ Chang, R.B. ... Piezo2 senses airway stretch and mediates lung inflation-induced apnoea Nature. 2017; 541 :176-181 Crossref Scopus (281) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several histological analyses revealed that both Piezo1 and Piezo2 are expressed in gut epithelial cells ( Bai et al., 2017 9. Bai, T. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Xia, J. ... Piezo2: A Candidate Biomarker for Visceral Hypersensitivity in Irritable Bowel Syndrome? J. Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2017; 23 :453-463 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lang et al., 2018 36. Lang, K. ∙ Breer, H. ∙ Frick, C.

Linan-Rico, A. ∙ Ochoa-Cortes, F. ∙ Beyder, A. ... Mechanosensory Signaling in Enterochromaffin Cells and 5-HT Release: Potential Implications for Gut Inflammation Front. Neurosci. 2016; 10 :564 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent in vitro study further suggested that EC cells use Piezo2 to generate an ionic current that is critical for intracellular calcium flux, leading to the conversion of force into 5-HT release ( Alcaino et al., 2018 3. Alcaino, C. ∙ Knutson, K.R. ∙ Treichel, A.J. ... A population of gut epithelial enterochromaffin cells is mechanosensitive and requires Piezo2 to convert force into serotonin release Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E7632-E7641 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that Piezo2 may play certain roles in 5-HT production, but the involvement of Piezo1 in this process has not been explored to date.
Here, we demonstrate that microbiome-derived single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) induces 5-HT from the intestinal epithelium via Piezo1 in the absence of a mechanical force. Mouse fecal extracts contain large amounts of RNA, and purified fecal RNA stimulated Piezo1. The ligand activity of fecal RNA was abolished by treatment with RNase A, an ssRNA-degrading enzyme, and in vitro -synthesized ssRNA activated Piezo1. Moreover, intestinal epithelium-specific deletion of Piezo1 caused impaired gut peristalsis, mild manifestations of experimental colitis, and increased bone mass in mice, which were accompanied by low serum 5-HT levels. RNase A infusion into the colon could suppress systemic 5-HT levels, suggesting that targeting fecal ssRNA can be a promising strategy for modulating the pathophysiology associated with peripheral 5-HT production.

Section: Results

Piezo1 mRNA was highly expressed in the mouse lung, spleen, intestine, and bone ( Figure S1 A). Among hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells, Piezo1 levels were found to be the highest in osteoclasts and were substantially higher in osteoblasts and osteocytes than in lymphocytes ( Figure S1 A). Notably, compared to Piezo1 , a lower expression level of Piezo2 was detected in osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes ( Figure S1 A). A recent in vitro study suggested that Piezo2 is expressed in the intestinal epithelium and may be involved in mechanosensing in the gut ( Alcaino et al., 2018 3. Alcaino, C. ∙ Knutson, K.R. ∙ Treichel, A.J. ... A population of gut epithelial enterochromaffin cells is mechanosensitive and requires Piezo2 to convert force into serotonin release Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E7632-E7641 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the role of Piezo1 in regulating gut homeostasis remains unknown. TRPV6 is the only intestinal calcium absorption ion channel identified to date and is considered to regulate bone metabolism via calcium uptake ( Cui et al., 2012 17. Cui, M. ∙ Li, Q. ∙ Johnson, R. ... Villin promoter-mediated transgenic expression of transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 6 (TRPV6) increases intestinal calcium absorption in wild-type and vitamin D receptor knockout mice J. Bone Miner. Res. 2012; 27 :2097-2107 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because Piezo1 is a calcium ion channel and is expressed in the intestine, we hypothesized that this protein may function not only in gut homeostasis but also in calcium and bone homeostasis. To validate our hypothesis in vivo , we attempted to generate gut-specific Piezo1 knockout mice. First, we obtained Piezo1 tm1(KOMP)Wtsi sperm from the KOMP repository ( Figure S1 B) and produced Piezo1 -targeted locus-harboring heterozygous mice, which were bred with FLPo-Cre mice to delete the LacZ and neomycin resistance genes, as previously described ( Figure S1 B; Table S1 ) ( Li et al., 2014 38. Li, J. ∙ Hou, B. ∙ Tumova, S. ... Piezo1 integration of vascular architecture with physiological force Nature. 2014; 515 :279-282 Crossref Scopus (767) PubMed Google Scholar ). After breeding out the FLPo recombinase, Piezo1 flox / flox mice were crossed with mice expressing Cre , driven by the Villin promoter, to generate mice with gut-specific Piezo1 deficiency (Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox ). This conditional Piezo1 deficiency caused no apparent macro-morphological abnormality, and histological analysis of the gut revealed normal epithelial tissue development with no signs of inflammation ( Figures S1 C–S1F). Furthermore, body weight, blood glucose, and food intake levels were comparable between the conditional knockout mice and control mice ( Figures S1 G–S1I). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis further revealed that the expression levels of colonic inflammatory cytokines were comparable ( Figure S1 J), and white blood cell number, platelet number, red blood cell number, and blood hemoglobin concentration were also comparable ( Figure S1 K). To examine the localization of Piezo1 in the mouse gut, we performed in situ hybridization. Incubation of the small and large intestine sections with Piezo1 antisense probes primarily labeled cells located in the basal region of the intestinal epithelium ( Figure 1 A). Contrary to the potent signals obtained with antisense probes, no labeling was obtained with sense probes ( Figure 1 A). Antisense probe signals were not detected in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice-derived gut sections, indicating that Piezo1 mRNA was abolished in these mice ( Figure 1 A). To explore whether the Piezo1 protein was indeed present in intestinal epithelium, we performed immunohistochemical staining of the small and large intestine ( Figure 1 B). Notably, the Piezo1 protein was expressed in all areas of the intestinal epithelium, and the protein signal was completely absent in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox sections ( Figure 1 B). To compare the expression levels of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in the gut, primary intestinal epithelium cells and the EC cell line RIN14B were prepared, and the mRNA expression levels of both genes were examined. Notably, compared to Piezo1 , a lower expression level of Piezo2 was detected in both cell types ( Figures 1 C and 1D). As Piezo1 is highly expressed in the gut epithelium and is thought to be the primary calcium ion channel in this tissue, we next analyzed the in vivo calcium homeostasis and bone homeostasis of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice. The urine calcium/creatinine ratio and the levels of serum calcium, serum 1,25 (OH) 2 vitamin D 3 , serum phosphate, and serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), a critical hormone that regulates serum calcium levels, were all comparable between Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox and control mice ( Figure 1 E). These findings suggest that in vivo calcium homeostasis is unaltered in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice. However, a significantly high bone volume phenotype was observed in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice, in which 8-week-old Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice showed a significantly increased bone volume compared to control mice ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and S1 L). Histomorphometric analysis revealed significant enhancement in the osteoblast surface/bone surface, osteoblast number/bone surface, and bone forming rate/bone surface ratios, and in the mineral apposition rate in these mice, whereas the osteoclast parameters were normal ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Strikingly, serum bone degradation markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP5b) and c-terminal telopeptide I carboxy-terminal collagen I crosslinks (CTX-I) were comparable to those of the control, whereas bone formation markers such as procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin (OCN) were elevated in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figure 1 H). These findings suggest that gut Piezo1 is a negative regulator of osteoblast activity.
Osteoclasts are derived from myeloid lineage cells, which are formed by RANKL stimulation ( Boyle et al., 2003 10. Boyle, W.J. ∙ Simonet, W.S. ∙ Lacey, D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation Nature. 2003; 423 :337-342 Crossref Scopus (5409) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bone-forming osteoblasts develop from Col1a1 -expressing osteoblast lineages, which are formed by RUNX2 activation ( Komori, 2010 33. Komori, T. Regulation of osteoblast differentiation by Runx2 Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2010; 658 :43-49 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, Piezo1 mRNA was highly expressed in cells involved in bone homeostasis such as myeloid lineages, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts ( Figure S1 A). To investigate the role of Piezo1 in bone metabolism, we analyzed the bone phenotypes of LysM -Piezo1 flox / flox mice (Cre under the control of a LysM promoter to abrogate Piezo1 in myeloid lineages; Figures S2 A–S2D) or Col1a1 -Piezo1 flox / flox mice (Cre under the control of a Col1a1 promoter to abrogate Piezo1 in osteoblasts; Figures S2 G–S2J). Notably, no obvious bone volume or serum bone metabolic marker abnormalities were detected in 8-week-old LysM -Piezo1 flox / flox mice or Col1a1 -Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figures S2 D and S2J). Ex vivo RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation assays revealed normal osteoclast numbers, TRAP activity, and expression of NFATc1, a pivotal differentiation marker of osteoclasts, in LysM -Piezo1 flox / flox cells ( Figures S2 E and S1F). We also cultured calvarial osteoblasts from Col1a1 -Piezo1 flox / flox mice and found that Piezo1-deficient osteoblasts had normal expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and RUNX2 ( Figures S2 K and S2L). Furthermore, Piezo1-deficient osteoblasts showed normal in vitro calcium nodule formation ( Figure S2 K). These findings indicate that myeloid and osteoblast Piezo1 are dispensable for physiological bone metabolism.
The high bone volume accompanied by increased osteoblast activity in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice suggested that these mice may have innate-immunological abnormalities, as systemic inflammation often affects bone homeostasis. The microbial composition is strongly affected by mucosal immunity ( Kamada et al., 2013 31. Kamada, N. ∙ Seo, S.-U. ∙ Chen, G.Y. ... Role of the gut microbiota in immunity and inflammatory disease Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :321-335 Crossref Scopus (1687) PubMed Google Scholar ). The total amount of fecal bacteria, as determined by qPCR using universal 16S rRNA primers, was comparable between Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox and control mice ( Figure 2 A). Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes of fecal microbiota further revealed that the relative abundance of most phyla was comparable, whereas the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia , Proteobacteria , and Deferribacteres were slightly but significantly different between genotypes ( Figure S3 A). The Shannon diversity index, which reflects the diversity of microbiota, was also comparable between the two groups ( Figure 2 B), suggesting that the extent of microbiome abnormality in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice was minimal.
Gut inflammation affects intestine length, but this parameter was also comparable to that of the control in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figure 2 C). We next examined the permeability of the gastrointestinal tract using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran, which was not affected in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figure 2 D). We concluded that gut-specific Piezo1 deficiency does not cause innate-immunological abnormalities in the steady state. Finally, to evaluate the possible Piezo1-mediated regulation of gut transit in vivo , we assessed dye movement attributed to gut peristalsis. To measure the whole gut transit time, the mice were gavaged with a solution containing Evans blue and methyl cellulose, and the time for expulsion of the first blue pellet was recorded as previously described ( Ge et al., 2017 25. Ge, X. ∙ Ding, C. ∙ Zhao, W. ... Antibiotics-induced depletion of mice microbiota induces changes in host serotonin biosynthesis and intestinal motility J. Transl. Med. 2017; 15 :13 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice exhibited a significantly impaired gut transit time ( Figure 2 E). We also conducted real-time in vivo imaging of gut peristalsis using fluorescence with a wavelength over-1,000-nm (OTN) in a near-infrared ceramic probe (OTN ceramic probe Y). The mice were starved for 24 h, and then granted free access to feed for 1 h. The mice were then gavaged with the OTN ceramic probe Y and in vivo fluorescence images were observed using the SAI-1000 imaging system ( Figure 2 F) as previously described ( Kuchimaru et al., 2018 34. Kuchimaru, T. ∙ Kataoka, N. ∙ Nakagawa, K. ... A reliable murine model of bone metastasis by injecting cancer cells through caudal arteries Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2981 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 2 h of OTN ceramic probe Y gavage, Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice exhibited limited probe distribution and impaired peristalsis of the gut ( Videos S1 and S2 ). The mice were sacrificed after 4 h of OTN ceramic probe Y gavage, whole intestines were collected, and gut probe distributions were visualized by the SAI-1000. As expected, OTN ceramic probe Y signaling in the colon was dramatically impaired in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice compared to control mice ( Figure 2 G). Thus, we concluded that Piezo1 is a positive regulator of in vivo gastrointestinal motility.

Inflammatory diseases affecting the gut can affect motility; in particular, ulcerative colitis is a major disease characterized by abnormal colonic motility ( Reddy et al., 1991 57. Reddy, S.N. ∙ Bazzocchi, G. ∙ Chan, S. ... Colonic motility and transit in health and ulcerative colitis Gastroenterology. 1991; 101 :1289-1297 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). The impaired gut motility observed in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice prompted us to explore the role of Piezo1 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice showed decreased weight loss, attenuated diarrhea, and an increased survival rate compared to those of control mice ( Figure S3 B). The colon length of DSS-treated Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice was significantly longer than that of control mice, and histological sections stained with H&E revealed impaired cellular infiltration and epithelial detachment in DSS-treated Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figures S3 B–S3E). Furthermore, expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and colon 5-HT levels were significantly impaired in these mice ( Figures S3 F and S3G). These findings indicate that gut Piezo1 may be a prophylactic target for colitis.
Gut peristalsis and the pathogenesis of colitis are regulated by gut-derived 5-HT ( Ghia et al., 2009 28. Ghia, J.E. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Wang, H. ... Serotonin has a key role in pathogenesis of experimental colitis Gastroenterology. 2009; 137 :1649-1660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yano et al., 2015 70. Yano, J.M. ∙ Yu, K. ∙ Donaldson, G.P. ... Indigenous bacteria from the gut microbiota regulate host serotonin biosynthesis Cell. 2015; 161 :264-276 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, gut-derived 5-HT was suggested as a negative regulator of bone formation ( Yadav et al., 2008 67. Yadav, V.K. ∙ Ryu, J.H. ∙ Suda, N. ... Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting serotonin synthesis in the duodenum Cell. 2008; 135 :825-837 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (724) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice exhibited increased osteoblast activity along with impaired gut motility and colitis ( Figures 1 I, 2 E–2G, and S3 B–S3G), we speculated that gut 5-HT production may be impaired in these mice. Indeed, both the serum and duodenum 5-HT levels were significantly reduced in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figures 3 A and 3B). The mRNA expression of Tph1 , encoding a rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT production in EC cells, was also dramatically reduced in the Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox gut ( Figure 3 C), whereas there was no difference in the mRNA expression level of chromogranin A, an EC cell marker gene, in the gut of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice relative to those of control mice ( Figure 3 D). Immunohistochemical staining of the duodenum revealed no change in the number of chromogranin A-positive cells, whereas the number of 5-HT-positive cells was significantly reduced in the Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox gut, suggesting that gut Piezo1 is not involved in the development of 5-HT-producing EC cells, but is indispensable for 5-HT production ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Strikingly, 5-HT injection rescued the high bone volume phenotype of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figure 3 G). 5-HT injection into these mice significantly reduced the serum levels of the bone formation markers P1NP and OCN, suggesting that this effect may be due to the suppression of enhanced bone formation ( Figure 3 G). Furthermore, 5-HT injection normalized the increased gut transit time and resistance to DSS-induced colitis observed in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figures 3 H–3K). These findings suggested that the bone and gut phenotypes of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice are solely due to impaired 5-HT production in the gut.
To confirm that Piezo1 activation directly results in 5-HT production from EC cells, we stimulated the RIN14B chromaffin cell line with Yoda1, a known Piezo1 ligand, and quantified 5-HT production ( Figure S4 A). Notably, Yoda1 significantly induced 5-HT production from RIN14B cells, and treatment with GsMTx4, a Piezo1 inhibitor, completely abolished Yoda1-induced 5-HT production ( Figure S4 A). Basal expression of Tph1 from the intestinal epithelium cells of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice cultured for 24 h in vitro was significantly lower than that of the control group ( Figure S4 B). After stimulation of the intestinal epithelium with Yoda1, the Tph1 level was significantly increased in wild-type cells, but not in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox -derived cells, suggesting that Piezo1 signaling is a positive regulator of 5-HT production in EC cells ( Figure S4 B). Because in vivo EC cells are exposed to cyclic stretching by gut peristalsis, we hypothesized that such mechanostimulation triggers 5-HT production from EC cells. To validate this hypothesis, RIN14B chromaffin cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated silicone chambers and subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch (12% elongation in length, 10 stretches/min for 24 h) using the STREX cell stretching system STB-1400 ( Figure S4 C). Notably, cyclic stretch induced 5-HT production from RIN14B cells, but this effect was not influenced by Piezo1 knockdown. In contrast, Piezo2-knockdown RIN14B cells did not produce 5-HT in response to cyclic stretching ( Figure S4 D). We also collected the intestinal epithelium from Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice for culture under cyclic stretch conditions. Notably, cyclic stretching induced Tph1 expression from not only wild-type cells but also Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox cells, indicating that Piezo1 is dispensable for mechanical force-induced 5-HT production from the gut ( Figure S4 E).
Because Piezo1 was found to be dispensable for mechanostimulation-evoked 5-HT production from the gut, we hypothesized that bacterial-derived factors may regulate 5-HT synthesis from the gut via Piezo1. To explore the association between the gut microbiome and the bone and gut phenotypes of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice, we treated 4-week-old mice with an antibiotic cocktail for 5 weeks to establish an antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion (AIMD) condition. Depletion of microbiota with AIMD was confirmed by qPCR using universal 16S rRNA primers ( Figure 4 A). AIMD-induced wild-type mice had a significantly increased bone volume accompanied by decreased serum 5-HT levels and increased serum bone formation markers ( Figures 4 B–4D). In contrast, the serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a hormone with known effects on skeletal growth, and the bone degradation markers TRACP5b and CTX-I, did not differ from those of control mice ( Figure 4 D). Yan et al. (2016) 69. Yan, J. ∙ Herzog, J.W. ∙ Tsang, K. ... Gut microbiota induce IGF-1 and promote bone formation and growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E7554-E7563 Crossref Scopus (486) PubMed Google Scholar noted that AIMD-induced mice exhibited a high bone mass accompanied by reduced serum IGF-1 and P1NP levels, indicating that the increased bone mass in AIMD-induced mice is likely a result of decreased resorption. However, no difference in CTX-I levels was observed in their study. Discrepancies between our findings and this previous report may be explained by differences in the concentration and duration of antibiotic treatment. Our data indicated that AIMD-induced enhancement of bone mass is solely due to increased bone formation. Notably, we also found that the bone volume of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice was not affected by AIMD with no change in serum 5-HT, IGF-1, P1NP, OCN, TRACP5b, and CTX-I levels ( Figures 4 B–4E). A recent report suggested that antibiotic-induced depletion of the mouse microbiota induces decreased host 5-HT biosynthesis and intestinal motility ( Ge et al., 2017 25. Ge, X. ∙ Ding, C. ∙ Zhao, W. ... Antibiotics-induced depletion of mice microbiota induces changes in host serotonin biosynthesis and intestinal motility J. Transl. Med. 2017; 15 :13 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this report, the wild-type gut transit time was significantly impaired by AIMD, but this phenomenon was not observed in AIMD-induced Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figure 4 F). Strikingly, the mortality rate due to DSS-induced colitis was significantly decreased by AIMD in wild-type mice, but the susceptibility of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice to DSS-induced colitis was unchanged by AIMD ( Figure 4 G). These findings strengthen our hypothesis that microbiome-derived factors may stimulate 5-HT production from the gut in a Piezo1-dependent manner.
To check whether gut microbiome component stimulate Piezo1, we first collected fecal extracts using a simple filtration procedure as described in the STAR Methods . In brief, mouse feces were dissolved in PBS and filtered to remove bacterial and fungal bodies. When this fecal solution (1 g feces/mL, fecal extract) was added to in vitro intestinal epithelium cultures from wild-type mice, a significant calcium response was observed ( Figure S5 A), whereas these responses were impaired in the intestinal epithelium of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice ( Figure S5 A). Yoda1 induced a dramatic calcium response in the wild-type intestinal epithelium, but not in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mouse-derived intestinal epithelium ( Figure S5 A). These findings suggested that the intestinal epithelium is activated by Piezo1 and that fecal extracts may contain ligands of Piezo1. To explore the ligand components of the fecal extract, we isolated protein, DNA, and RNA from the fecal extract using a NucleoSpin TriPrep kit (Macherey-nagel). Calcium imaging revealed that Piezo1-expressed HEK293T cells potently responded not only to the fecal extract but also to Yoda1 ( Figure 5 A). In contrast, the extracted protein and extracted DNA did not activate Piezo1-expressing HEK293T cells ( Figure 5 B). When the extracted RNA was added to the Piezo1-expressing HEK293T cells, a significant calcium response was observed ( Figure 5 C). Furthermore, when the fecal extract and extracted RNA were treated with RNase A, a known ssRNA-degrading enzyme, the Piezo1 agonist activities of both extracts were abolished ( Figure 5 D). To verify whether ssRNA is a bona fide ligand of Piezo1, we added ssRNA40, a 20-mer phosphothioate-protected ssRNA oligonucleotide containing a GU-rich sequence, to Piezo1-expressing cells. Indeed, a significant calcium response was observed in ssRNA40-stimulated Piezo1-expressing HEK293T cells ( Figure 5 E). We also performed the whole-cell patch-clamp recording in HEK293T cells to investigate whether ssRNA40 directly activates Piezo1, revealing ssRNA40-induced currents in Piezo1-overexpressing cells ( Figures S5 B–S5D). The average value was comparable to the maximum current size when negative pressure was applied to the cells during whole-cell patch-clamp recording according to a previous report ( Coste et al., 2010 15. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1965) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To confirm the ssRNA dependency of Piezo1 activation, we measured the ssRNA40-induced currents in both wild-type and Piezo1-deficient N2A cells, because this cell line endogenously expresses Piezo1 ( Coste et al., 2010 15. Coste, B. ∙ Mathur, J. ∙ Schmidt, M. ... Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels Science. 2010; 330 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (1965) PubMed Google Scholar ). We established CRISPR-Cas9-generated Piezo1-deficient cells (KO#24, Figures S5 E–S5G). The Yoda1-mediated calcium response was observed in wild-type cells, but not in KO#24 cells ( Figure S5 H). Although we could not observe a clear endogenous mechanostimulation-induced Piezo1 current in wild-type cells by our poking condition (200 μm/s, data not shown), we successfully recorded the mechanostimulation-induced Piezo1 current in Yoda1-pretreated wild-type cells ( Figure S5 I). Yoda1-pretreated clone KO#24 did not respond to mechanostimulation, indicating that clone KO#24 is a true Piezo1 knockout cell line ( Figure S5 I). Strikingly, ssRNA significantly induced outward and inward currents in wild-type cells, but not in clone KO#24 ( Figure S5 J). We also investigated the effect of ssRNA40 on the currents induced by mechanical stimulation in Piezo1-knockout HEK293T cells transfected with mPiezo1. Notably, the peak currents were not significantly changed, but the slowing of inactivation (Tau time reduced by 63% from the peak) was observed by ssRNA40 treatment ( Figure S5 K). Collectively, these results suggest that fecal ssRNA is a bona fide activator of Piezo1 and that ssRNA may partially contribute to the enhancement of Piezo1 mechanoactivation. Notably, synthetic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) such as 5′ppp-dsRNA and poly(I:C) did not activate Piezo1 ( Figures 5 F and 5G). We also determined the ligand activity of various synthetic DNAs such as CpG DNA, ssDNA, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), but these DNAs also had no ligand activity ( Figure S5 L). We confirmed that various pathogen associated molecular patterns ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 65. Takeuchi, O. ∙ Akira, S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation Cell. 2010; 140 :805-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6690) PubMed Google Scholar ) such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, Dectin1 ligands, RIG-I ligands, and NOD 1/2 ligands also had no Piezo1 ligand activity ( Figure S5 M). A recent report suggested that bacterial metabolites such as p-aminobenzoate, cholate, tyramine, butyrate, and propionate activate RIN14B cells to induce 5-HT ( Yano et al., 2015 70. Yano, J.M. ∙ Yu, K. ∙ Donaldson, G.P. ... Indigenous bacteria from the gut microbiota regulate host serotonin biosynthesis Cell. 2015; 161 :264-276 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2354) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we determined the Piezo1 ligand activity of these molecules, but no calcium influx was detected in response to these metabolites ( Figure S5 M).
As the amount of fecal extract RNA was comparable between Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice and control mice ( Figure S5 N), but was decreased in AIMD-induced mice ( Figure S5 O), we hypothesized that fecal bacteria-derived ssRNA-induced Piezo1-mediated 5-HT production was impaired in Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice. First, to check whether ssRNA can induce 5-HT production in the gut, we stimulated the intestinal epithelium with ssRNA40. Spontaneous production of 5-HT from the wild-type intestinal epithelium was significantly higher than that from Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice-derived cells ( Figure 5 H). Because RNA signaling evokes an inflammatory response via TLR signaling, and adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF are critical for RNA signaling, we further determined the importance of these adaptor proteins in the RNA-induced 5-HT production of epithelial cells ( Figure 5 I). Spontaneous production of 5-HT from the intestinal epithelium derived from wild-type and MyD88 −/− TRIF −/− cells was comparable ( Figure 5 I). Furthermore, similar levels of ssRNA-induced 5-HT production were observed in both cell genotypes ( Figure 5 I). Because TLR7 recognizes ssRNA, we examined the bone phenotype of TLR7 −/− mice. These mice exhibited a normal bone volume ( Figure S5 P), indicating that TLR-mediated signaling is dispensable for gut ssRNA-Piezo1-mediated 5-HT production.
Yadav et al. (2008) 67. Yadav, V.K. ∙ Ryu, J.H. ∙ Suda, N. ... Lrp5 controls bone formation by inhibiting serotonin synthesis in the duodenum Cell. 2008; 135 :825-837 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (724) PubMed Google Scholar suggested that the gut Wnt co-receptor Lrp5 inhibits Tph1, and gut-derived 5-HT inhibits osteoblast proliferation via the Htr1b receptor-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB) axis. As such, we hypothesized that Wnt signaling may play a role in Piezo1 deficiency. However, in contrast to our expectations, the expression levels of Lrp5 and Wnt target genes such as Fra1 and c-Myc , and the protein levels of β-catenin in the intestinal epithelium of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice did not differ from those of the wild-type mice ( Figures S6 A and S6B). In addition, RIN14B cells with Piezo1 knockdown that were transfected with a TCF/LEF reporter construct ( Zhang et al., 2018 73. Zhang, Z. ∙ Cheng, L. ∙ Li, J. ... Inhibition of the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway Overcomes Resistance to Enzalutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cancer Res. 2018; 78 :3147-3162 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) were treated with Wnt3a and/or Yoda1 to more directly determine if Piezo1 affects Wnt signaling ( Figure S6 C). Wnt3a, but not Yoda1, enhanced reporter activity, and this enhancement was not altered by Piezo1 knockdown ( Figure S6 C). Moreover, Wnt3a stimulation did not affect the Yoda1-induced calcium response in the intestinal epithelium of both wild-type and Piezo1-deficient mice ( Figures S6 D–S6F). Furthermore, RIN14B cells with Lrp5 knockdown did not show alterations in Piezo1 and Tph1 expression levels compared to those of control cells, and Yoda1-induced calcium response was also unchanged ( Figures S6 G–S6I), indicating that intestinal Lrp5 may be dispensable for 5-HT production in the gut as described previously ( Cui et al., 2011 16. Cui, Y. ∙ Niziolek, P.J. ∙ MacDonald, B.T. ... Lrp5 functions in bone to regulate bone mass Nat. Med. 2011; 17 :684-691 Crossref Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). Wnt3a stimulation or inhibition of Wnt signaling by treatment of the specific inhibitor XAV939 did not affect Yoda1- or ssRNA40-induced 5-HT production ( Figure S6 J). In addition, LiCl-induced Wnt signaling activation did not affect Piezo1 expression in the primary intestinal epithelium ( Figure S6 K). Notably, despite the normal expression of Htr1b , the bone tissues of Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mice exhibited enhanced CREB expression, indicating that the 5-HT-Htr1b-CREB axis in osteoblasts may be hyperactivated in these mice ( Figure S6 L). Collectively, we conclude that gut Piezo1 deficiency may inhibit bone formation via gut-derived 5-HT-mediated CREB activation, and this pathway appears to be independent of that responsible for gut Lrp5-mediated 5-HT regulation.
A recent report indicated that calpain-2 is indispensable for Piezo1 signaling ( Li et al., 2014 38. Li, J. ∙ Hou, B. ∙ Tumova, S. ... Piezo1 integration of vascular architecture with physiological force Nature. 2014; 515 :279-282 Crossref Scopus (767) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this report, we found that the calpain inhibitor PD15060 inhibited ssRNA40-induced Tph1 expression in RIN14B cells ( Figure S6 M). Because endothelial calpain-2 activates AKT in response to vascular endothelial growth factor ( Zhang et al., 2017 72. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, N.M. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Endothelial cell calpain as a critical modulator of angiogenesis Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Basis Dis. 2017; 1863 :1326-1335 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), and AKT signaling induces Tph1 expression in breast cancer ( Gautam et al., 2016 23. Gautam, J. ∙ Banskota, S. ∙ Regmi, S.C. ... Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 and 5-HT 7 receptor preferentially expressed in triple-negative breast cancer promote cancer progression through autocrine serotonin signaling Mol. Cancer. 2016; 15 :75 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that gut AKT may play a role in ssRNA-mediated Tph1 induction. Notably, the AKT inhibitor AZD5363 suppressed the ssRNA40-induced Tph1 expression in RIN14B cells, indicating that calpain and AKT signaling may play pivotal roles in Piezo1-mediated TPH1 production ( Figure S6 M).
Finally, we investigated why the in vitro spontaneous production of 5-HT from the wild-type intestinal epithelium was larger than that from Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mouse-derived cells. This difference was indeed abolished by RNase A treatment of wild-type cells ( Figure S6 N). However, RNase A treatment did not suppress the spontaneous production of 5-HT from Villin- Piezo1 flox / flox mouse-derived cells ( Figure S6 N), indicating that contamination of gut-derived extracellular ssRNA may stimulate the intestinal epithelium to produce 5-HT via Piezo1. Collectively, we concluded that gut ssRNA is a ligand of gut Piezo1.
Finally, to validate the in vivo significance of RNA-mediated 5-HT production in aging, we compared the 5-HT-associated phenotypes of 6-week-old (young) and 35-week-old (old) male mice. As expected, the bone volume was decreased in old mice, which was accompanied by reduced expression of bone formation markers ( Figure S6 O). Notably, the quantity of fecal RNA in old mice was significantly elevated, which was accompanied by impaired RNase A expression in the gut ( Figure S6 O). Serum 5-HT levels were also significantly increased in old mice ( Figure S6 O). These findings indicate that there may be an inverse correlation between 5-HT and RNase A expression in the context of aging. To evaluate the impact of gut ssRNA depletion on 5-HT levels and 5-HT-associated phenotypes in old mice, a daily colonic infusion of Matrigel-containing RNase A was performed for 1 month ( Figure 6 A). RNase A-infused old mice showed a significant increase in bone volume and bone formation markers, which was accompanied by a lower quantity of fecal RNA and decreased serum 5-HT levels ( Figures 6 B and 6C). In concordance with this impaired 5-HT level, the whole gut transit time was also increased in the RNase A-infused old mice ( Figure 6 C), suggesting that depletion of gut ssRNA may be a promising strategy for decreasing 5-HT levels in aged mice ( Figure 6 D).

Section: Discussion

Here, we showed that the fecal ssRNA-Piezo1 axis plays a pivotal role in stimulating the levels of systemic 5-HT. A recent report suggested that cyclical pressure activates macrophages via Piezo1, leading to the induction of inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-1β ( Solis et al., 2019 62. Solis, A.G. ∙ Bielecki, P. ∙ Steach, H.R. ... Mechanosensation of cyclical force by PIEZO1 is essential for innate immunity Nature. 2019; 573 :69-74 Crossref Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to expectations based on previous findings, the intestinal epithelium from gut-specific Piezo1-deficient mice exhibited normal expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. However, gut-specific Piezo1 deficiency resulted in decreased serum 5-HT levels accompanied by increased bone mass and impaired peristalsis. In agreement with previous findings that gut-derived 5-HT exacerbates colonic inflammation ( Ghia et al., 2009 28. Ghia, J.E. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Wang, H. ... Serotonin has a key role in pathogenesis of experimental colitis Gastroenterology. 2009; 137 :1649-1660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), gut-specific Piezo1-deficient mice were found to be highly resistant to DSS-induced colitis. Because 5-HT activates NF-κB target genes of the myeloid lineage ( Ghia et al., 2009 28. Ghia, J.E. ∙ Li, N. ∙ Wang, H. ... Serotonin has a key role in pathogenesis of experimental colitis Gastroenterology. 2009; 137 :1649-1660 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (314) PubMed Google Scholar ), gut Piezo1-induced 5-HT may act as a proinflammatory mediator of colitis. Consistent with a previous report showing that Piezo2 in EC cells converts a mechanical stimulus into 5-HT production ( Alcaino et al., 2018 3. Alcaino, C. ∙ Knutson, K.R. ∙ Treichel, A.J. ... A population of gut epithelial enterochromaffin cells is mechanosensitive and requires Piezo2 to convert force into serotonin release Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E7632-E7641 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data suggest that cyclic mechanical stimulation of EC cells induces 5-HT synthesis in a Piezo1-independent but Piezo2-dependent manner. These findings imply that activation of Piezo1 by gentle mechanical stimulation (10 stretches/min) is not sufficient to induce 5-HT synthesis in EC cells.
Recent report suggested that some microRNAs induce TLR7/TRPA1-dependent single-channel activities in HEK293 cells overexpressing TLR7/TRPA1 ( Park et al., 2014 52. Park, C.K. ∙ Xu, Z.Z. ∙ Berta, T. ... Extracellular microRNAs activate nociceptor neurons to elicit pain via TLR7 and TRPA1 Neuron. 2014; 82 :47-54 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, extracellular RNAs such as microRNAs may serve as an activator of ion channels. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports of extracellular RNA as a ligand of mechanosensing ion channels, or a natural ligand of Piezo1. The function of the ssRNA-Piezo1-5HT axis in the gut may broaden our mechanistic understanding into gut-derived 5-HT-associated diseases such as osteoporosis and colitis.
Viral or bacterial nucleic acids, DNA, and RNA are sensed by endosomal receptors. Endosomal ssRNA is recognized by TLR7 in mice ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 65. Takeuchi, O. ∙ Akira, S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation Cell. 2010; 140 :805-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6690) PubMed Google Scholar ). TLR7 is only expressed in the endosomes, and not on the cellular surface, and uses the adaptor protein MyD88 to evoke inflammatory signaling. In contrast to ssRNA, pathogen-derived dsRNA is recognized by endosomal TLR3, and this receptor uses the adaptor protein TRIF to evoke interferon production ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 65. Takeuchi, O. ∙ Akira, S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation Cell. 2010; 140 :805-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6690) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent report suggested that recognition of gram-positive bacteria relies on bacterial ssRNA. Bacterial ssRNA induces cytokines in MyD88-dependent manner, but occurs independently of known nucleotide-sensing TLRs ( Deshmukh et al., 2012 19. Deshmukh, S.D. ∙ Müller, S. ∙ Hese, K. ... NO is a macrophage autonomous modifier of the cytokine response to streptococcal single-stranded RNA J. Immunol. 2012; 188 :774-780 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings suggest that the machinery underlying the recognition of ssRNA warrants further exploration. We demonstrated that ssRNA-induced 5-HT production occurs in an MyD88/TRIF-independent and canonical Wnt signaling-independent manner. Moreover, calpain and AKT inhibitors suppressed ssRNA-induced 5-HT production. Collectively, these findings indicate that the signaling pathway of Piezo1-mediated 5-HT synthesis may be distinct from that of innate-inflammatory signaling or Lrp5/Wnt signaling, and calpain signaling may play a role in 5-HT production. Further studies are required to reveal the mechanisms of Piezo1-mediated 5-HT production in the gut.
The most interesting phenotype of gut-specific Piezo1-deficient mice is increased bone formation. Although it is widely accepted that bone cells are exposed to various deflections and respond to mechanical stimuli ( Ozcivici et al., 2010 50. Ozcivici, E. ∙ Luu, Y.K. ∙ Adler, B. ... Mechanical signals as anabolic agents in bone Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2010; 6 :50-59 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ), details of these phenomena are unknown. In this study, we generated myeloid and osteoblast lineage-specific Piezo1-deficient mice. In contrast to our expectations, myeloid and osteoblast lineage-specific Piezo1-deficient mice had a normal bone mass. Thus, Piezo1 may not be involved in physiological mechanosensing in bone cells. Future work will be required to investigate whether bone cell Pieozo1 contributes to exercise-induced bone remodeling.
Overall, our findings provide an ssRNA sensing mechanism and identify the 5-HT production machinery triggered by Piezo1. As Piezo1 is activated by chemicals such as Yoda1, other natural ligand candidates of Piezo1 may exist. Further experiments will be needed to investigate whether Piezo1 is activated by non-mechanical machinery.

Four to 35-week-old mice were used in all experiments. The mice were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions and all animal experiments complied with the Institutional Animal Care Committees and guidelines of Osaka University (animal 14013). To generate the conditional Piezo1 knockout mouse, Piezo1 tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi allele sperm was imported from the KOMP repository ( https://www.komp.org/ ) and fertilized in vitro with eggs from wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Japan CLEA). Heterozygous offspring were crossed with FLPo recombinase-expressing transgenic mice ( Yamazaki et al., 2016 68. Yamazaki, D. ∙ Miyata, H. ∙ Funato, Y. ... The Mg2+ transporter CNNM4 regulates sperm Ca2+ homeostasis and is essential for reproduction J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 :1940-1949 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) (provided by M. Ikawa, Osaka University) to remove the lacZ and neomycin resistance gene insertions flanked by FRT sites and obtain Piezo1 flox/flox mice. Deletion of the insertions was confirmed by PCR and the FLPo recombinase gene was bred out. Piezo1 flox/flox mice were then crossed with various Cre mice to generate the conditional knockout of Piezo1. Age-matched littermate Cre + Piezo1 flox/+ mice were used as controls.

To measure bone formation, double calcein labeling was performed. Calcein (Wako, 16 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into mice and the dose was repeated 72 h later. The mice were sacrificed 24 h after the second injection, and their femurs were fixed with 70% ethanol before being subjected to morphometric analysis. Three-dimensional microcomputed tomography analysis of the femurs was conducted using a Scan-Xmate RB080SS110 system (Comscan Techno Co., Ltd., Sagamihara, Japan). Bone structural indices were measured using TRI/3D-Bon software (Ratoc System Engineering Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Bone micro-architectural parameters were analyzed in the trabecular regions of the femurs (from 0.1 to 1.5 mm away from the chondro-osseous junction). For histomorphometric analysis, the tibias were fixed with 70% ethanol, stained with Villanueva Bone Stain or TRAP, and then embedded in methylmethacrylate. Serial longitudinal sections (6 mm thickness) were prepared using a microtome, and bone morphometric parameters were analyzed by a Histometry RT camera (Systems Supply). Bone morphometric parameters were defined by using the definition of ASBMR histomorphometry nomenclature committee ( Parfitt et al., 1987 51. Parfitt, A.M. ∙ Drezner, M.K. ∙ Glorieux, F.H. ... Bone histomorphometry: standardization of nomenclature, symbols, and units. Report of the ASBMR Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2 :595-610 Crossref Scopus (4992) PubMed Google Scholar ). For in vitro osteoclast culture, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems)-derived macrophages were prepared from bone marrow cells and then induced to differentiate into osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL (R&D Systems); TRAP staining was performed using a TRAP-ALP stain kit (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In some experiments, total TRAP activity was measured at an absorbance of 405 nm after treatment with ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate (TRAP solution assay, ( Lee et al., 2006 37. Lee, S.-H. ∙ Rho, J. ∙ Jeong, D. ... v-ATPase V0 subunit d2-deficient mice exhibit impaired osteoclast fusion and increased bone formation Nat. Med. 2006; 12 :1403-1409 Crossref Scopus (475) PubMed Google Scholar )). For in vitro osteoblast culture, calvarial cells from 2-day-old mice were harvested with collagenase and dispase ( Maruyama et al., 2013 44. Maruyama, K. ∙ Uematsu, S. ∙ Kondo, T. ... Strawberry notch homologue 2 regulates osteoclast fusion by enhancing the expression of DC-STAMP J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210 :1947-1960 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cultured in a medium supplemented with an osteoblast-inducer reagent (Takara Bio Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (1:200 Life Technologies). The medium was changed every 3 days and after 20 days, calcified nodules were dissolved in 0.5 M HCl and calcium concentrations were measured using Metallo Assay kit LS (Metallogenics). ALP levels in the osteoblast culture were measured by LabAssay ALP (Wako, Tokyo, Japan). Osteocytes from the tibiae, femora, and humeri were isolated as previously described ( Shah et al., 2016 61. Shah, K.M. ∙ Stern, M.M. ∙ Stern, A.R. ... Osteocyte isolation and culture methods Bonekey Rep. 2016; 5 :838 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the bone marrow was removed by flushing, and the bones were dissected into 1–2-mm pieces, which were transferred into a collagenase solution (300 U/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma) dissolved in alpha-minimal essential medium) and incubated for 25 min with shaking, followed by rinsing by Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) (digest 1). The collagenase digest was repeated twice (digest 2 and 3), and then the bone pieces were cultured in an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution [5 mM EDTA tetrasodium salt dehydrate dissolved in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 25 min with shaking, followed by rinsing with HBSS (digest 4). The bones were then cultured in the collagenase solution and incubated for 25 min with shaking, followed by a rise with HBSS (digest 5). Subsequently, the bones were cultured in the EDTA solution for 25 min with shaking and then rinsed by HBSS (digest 6). The bones were then cultured in the collagenase solution and incubated for 25 min with shaking, followed by rinsing by HBSS (digest 7). Next, the bones were cultured in the EDTA solution for 25 min with shaking and rinsed by HBSS (digest 8). Finally, the bones were cultured in the collagenase solution and incubated for 25 min with shaking (digest 9). The final collagenase solution was transferred to a centrifuge tube. The bones were rinsed three times with HBSS and the rinsates were transferred to the same tube. The tube was centrifuged at 1000 × g and pellets were used as osteocytes. These cells were ALP-negative, and displayed a dendritic morphology as previously reported ( Stern et al., 2012 63. Stern, A.R. ∙ Stern, M.M. ∙ Van Dyke, M.E. ...

Mouse gut tissues were fixed with G-Fix (Genostaff), embedded in paraffin on CT-Pro20 (Genostaff) using G-Nox (Genostaff) in place of xylene as a less toxic organic solvent, and sectioned at 6 μm. In situ hybridization was performed with the ISH Reagent Kit (Genostaff) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissue sections were deparaffined with G-Nox, and rehydrated with an ethanol series and PBS. The sections were fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin (10% formalin in PBS) for 30 min at 37°C, washed in distilled water, placed in 0.2 N HCl for 10 min at 37°C, washed in PBS, treated with 4 μg/ml Proteinase K (Wako) in PBS for 10 min at 37°C and washed in PBS, and then placed within a Coplin jar containing 1xG-Wash (Genostaff), equivalent to 1 × SSC. Hybridization was performed with probes at 250 ng/ml in G-Hybo-L (Genostaff) for 16 h at 60°C. After hybridization, the sections were washed in 1xG-Wash for 10 min at 60°C and then in 50% formamide in 1xG-Wash for 10 min at 60°C. The sections were then washed twice in 1xG-Wash for 10 min at 60°C, twice in 0.1xG-Wash for 10 min at 60°C, and twice in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature. After treatment with 1xG-Block (Genostaff) for 15 min at room temperature, the sections were incubated with anti-DIG AP conjugate (Roche Diagnostics) diluted 1:2000 with x50G-Block (Genostaff) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed twice in TBST and then incubated in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Tween20, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. Color reactions were performed with NBT/BCIP solution (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight and then the sections were washed in PBS, followed by counterstaining with Kernechtrot stain solution (Muto Pure Chemicals), and mounted with G-Mount (Genostaff). The Piezo1 probe sequence is indicated in the Key Resources Table . For immunohistochemical analysis of gut Piezo1 and chromogranin A, gut tissue sections were deparaffined with xylene, and rehydrated with an ethanol series and TBS. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave treatment with citrate buffer (pH 6). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in methanol for 30 min, followed by incubation with a Protein Block (Dako, X090930-2) and avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories). The sections were incubated with anti-Piezo1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Proteintech, 15939-1-AP) or anti-chromogranin A rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abcam, ab85554) at 4°C overnight. The sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Dako, E0432) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of peroxidase conjugated streptavidin for 5 min. Peroxidase activity was visualized by diaminobenzidine. Sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (MUTO, 30001), dehydrated, and then mounted with Malinol (MUTO, 10781). For immunohistochemical analysis of gut 5-HT, the tissue sections were deparaffinized with xylene, and rehydrated with an ethanol series and TBS. Antigen retrieval was performed by enzymatic treatment with Proteinase K. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in methanol for 30 min, followed by incubation with Protein Block (Dako). The sections were incubated with anti-5-HT mouse monoclonal antibodies (NOVUS, NB120-16007) that had previously reacted with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody at 4°C overnight. Peroxidase activity was visualized by diaminobenzidine. The sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (MUTO), dehydrated, and then mounted with Malinol (MUTO).
For immunoblot analysis, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (11836170001, Roche). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the resulting supernatant was boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. Immunoblot analysis was performed with rabbit anti-Piezo1 (Alomone labs, APC-087), anti-β-actin pAb-HRP-DirecT (MBL, PM053-7), and HRP-conjugated antibodies to rabbit IgG (Promega, W4018), and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate, 32106, Thermo Scientific). For chemiluminescence, membranes were incubated with Western Lightning Plus-ECL reagents (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed on the C-DiGit scanner (LI-COR).
PTH (MyBioSource), IGF-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1,25 (OH) 2 Vitamin D 3 (LSBio), TRACP5b (Immunodiagnostic Systems), CTX-I (USCN Biosciences), OCN (MyBioSource), P1NP (MyBioSource), and β-catenin (LSBio) levels were measured by ELISA with respective kits according to the manufacturer’s protocols. For 5-HT measurements, whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture and spun by SST vacutainers (Beckton Dickinson) for serum harvest. The entire length of the duodenum or 5 cm from the middle portion of the colon was washed in PBS, flushed with PBS to remove feces, and sonicated on ice in ELISA standard buffer supplemented with ascorbic acid. 5-HT levels in the serum and sonicated duodenum/colon were measured with a Serotonin ELISA kit (Enzo Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Readings of the duodenum/colon samples were normalized to total protein concentrations as detected by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
For gut qPCR analysis, 1-cm medial portions of the mouse duodenum, ileum, and colon were collected, washed in PBS, and flushed with PBS to remove feces. Tissues were homogenized by BioMasher (TAKARA) and RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcription was performed using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo). The quantity of mRNA was normalized to that of 18S rRNA using TaqMan Ribosomal RNA control reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qPCR was performed with a LightCycler 96 (Roche) Real Time PCR System and LightCycler software (Rosh) using TaqMan Assays-on-Demand primers (Life Technologies) ( Table S1 ).
Total white blood cell numbers, red blood cell numbers, and platelet numbers were calculated by a Celltac α hematology analyzer (MEK-6550, NIHON KOHDEN). Urine creatinine and calcium levels were determined with a creatinine urine colorimetric assay kit (Cayman) and Metallo Assay kit LS (Metallogenics), respectively, and blood chemicals were quantified using a biochemical analysis service (Oriental Yeast). The oral glucose tolerance test was performed as described previously ( Andrikopoulos et al., 2008 6. Andrikopoulos, S. ∙ Blair, A.R. ∙ Deluca, N. ... Evaluating the glucose tolerance test in mice Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295 :E1323-E1332 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, a bolus of glucose was delivered into the stomach by a gavage needle and blood was sampled at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min for plasma glucose analysis.
The total gastrointestinal transit time was measured as previously described ( Ge et al., 2017 25. Ge, X. ∙ Ding, C. ∙ Zhao, W. ... Antibiotics-induced depletion of mice microbiota induces changes in host serotonin biosynthesis and intestinal motility J. Transl. Med. 2017; 15 :13 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the mice were fasted overnight, and after having free access to water, they were administered a 100 μL solution containing 5% Evans blue (Sigma) and 1.5% methyl cellulose (Sigma) by gavage. Fecal pellets were monitored for the presence of the first blue pellet. For in vivo imaging of peristalsis, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe imaging was performed with an SAI-1000 (Shimadzu) as described previously ( Kuchimaru et al., 2018 34. Kuchimaru, T. ∙ Kataoka, N. ∙ Nakagawa, K. ... A reliable murine model of bone metastasis by injecting cancer cells through caudal arteries Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :2981 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, mice with shaved abdomens and backs were fasted overnight. After 1 h of free feeding, the mice were orally administered 100 μL OTN ceramic probe Y (over-1000 nm NIR fluorescent probe, Katayama Chemical Industries). After 2 h, the mice were maintained under light anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane and monitored with SAI-1000 (Shimadzu) to capture a movie of the intestinal distribution of NIR fluorescence from OTN-ceramic probe Y (excitation/emission wavelength = 980 nm/1530 nm). In another experiment, 4 h after the oral administration of OTN ceramic probe Y, the mice were sacrificed, and the whole gut was removed and observed by SAI-1000 to capture the NIR fluorescence signal from the gut (excitation/emission wavelength = 980 nm/1530 nm).
Acute colitis was induced by administration of 5% DSS (Sigma) in the drinking water for 7 days. Subsequently, the mice were switched to regular water until the end of the experiment. Changes in survival rates and body weight were monitored. Severity of diarrhea was scored using the following scale, 0: normal stool, 1: soft stool, 2: slightly wet stool, 3: wet and soft stool, 4: wet and soft stool with moderate perianal a staining of the coat, 5: watery stool with severe perianal staining of the coat. Intestinal tissues were collected, washed with PBS. After fixation of 4% PFA, tissues were embedded in paraffin. Intestinal sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and histological damage scores were measured using Cooper’s scoring system of DSS-induced colitis ( Cooper et al., 1993 14. Cooper, H.S. ∙ Murthy, S.N. ∙ Shah, R.S. ... Clinicopathologic study of dextran sulfate sodium experimental murine colitis Lab. Invest. 1993; 69 :238-249 PubMed Google Scholar ). To evaluate the permeability of the intestine, the mice were administered FITC-dextran (Polysciences, 400mg/kg body weight) 4 h before sacrifice, and serum absorption was measured by a fluorometer ( Fujimoto et al., 2017 22. Fujimoto, K. ∙ Kinoshita, M. ∙ Tanaka, H. ... Regulation of intestinal homeostasis by the ulcerative colitis-associated gene RNF186 Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10 :446-459 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). For 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis, Villin -Piezo1 flox/flox mice and their littermate controls, Villin -Piezo1 flox/+ mice, were maintained in the same cage. Stool samples of 0.25 g were collected from the mice and DNA samples for the assessment of the microbial community were extracted with PowerFecal DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO). Relative quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies of total bacteria was performed by qPCR using universal 16S rRNA primers ( Yan et al., 2016 69. Yan, J. ∙ Herzog, J.W. ∙ Tsang, K. ... Gut microbiota induce IGF-1 and promote bone formation and growth Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E7554-E7563 Crossref Scopus (486) PubMed Google Scholar ). The 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis of stool DNA was performed by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea). In brief, stool DNA samples were processed with the library constructs, and the V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA were amplified by PCR ( Klindworth et al., 2013 32. Klindworth, A. ∙ Pruesse, E. ∙ Schweer, T. ... Evaluation of general 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR primers for classical and next-generation sequencing-based diversity studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e1 Crossref Scopus (5664) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sequences obtained from Miseq were filtered by Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and chimeric sequences were removed. Paired-end reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units and the Shannon diversity index was calculated ( Morgan and Huttenhower, 2012 47. Morgan, X.C. ∙ Huttenhower, C. Chapter 12: Human microbiome analysis PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8 :e1002808 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mixed primary intestinal epithelium cell collection was performed as previously described ( Psichas et al., 2017 53. Psichas, A. ∙ Tolhurst, G. ∙ Brighton, C.A. ... Mixed Primary Cultures of Murine Small Intestine Intended for the Study of Gut Hormone Secretion and Live Cell Imaging of Enteroendocrine Cells J. Vis. Exp. 2017; 55687 Google Scholar ). In brief, the intestine (upper small intestine, top 10 cm, distal to pylorus) of an 8-week-old mouse was washed and the adipose tissues were removed. The muscle layer was peeled off under a microscope using forceps, and then the intestine was opened longitudinally and minced into 1-mm 2 squares. The tissue pieces were treated with a digestion medium [0.3 mg/ml collagenase XI (Sigma) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM)] and gently shaked. After the digestion steps, crypt fragments were collected by centrifugation. For cell number counting, 1 mL of the crypt fragments-containing medium was centrifuged, washed with PBS, and treated with trypsin-EDTA for 5 min to generate a single-cell suspension. Crypt fragments (containing 5 × 10 5 cells) were plated on basement membrane matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific)-coated 48-well plates and incubated for 18 h. After washing with PBS, adhered cells were used as the primary intestinal epithelium cells.
Small interfering RNA of Piezo1 (Invitrogen Stealth RNAi siRNA, RSS323781), Piezo2 (Invitrogen Stealth RNAi siRNA, RSS369639), Lgr5 (Invitrogen Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA s152423), and a negative control oligo were used for knockdown in R1N14B cells. Small interfering RNAs were introduced into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were used in the cell stretching experiment.
RIN14B cells or primary intestinal epithelial cells were seeded on Matrigel-coated silicone chambers at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells/cm 2 . After the 24 h culture, cells were subjected to uniaxial cyclic stretch [12% elongation in length, 10 stretches/min (3 s stretch, followed by 3 s relaxation) for 24 h] using a STREX cell stretching system (STB-1400, STREX Inc. Osaka, Japan) to mimic peristalsis-associated gut cell contraction/relaxation.
Fresh mouse feces were dissolved in PBS (1 g feces/ml) at room temperature using BioMasher (TaKaRa), and filtered with a 70-μm cell strainer. The filtered extract was further filtered with a 0.45-μm syringe filter to remove bacterial and fungal bodies (fecal extract). To isolate total DNA, RNA, and protein from the fecal extract, a NucleoSpin TriPrep kit (Macherey-nagel 740966.10) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The A260/A280 of total RNA and DNA was 2.0 and 1.8, respectively. The protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (TaKaRa). DNA, RNA, and protein (10 μg/ml each) were used as the “extracted DNA,” “extracted RNA,” and “extracted protein,” respectively.
TLR ligands Pam3CSK4, heat-killed L. monocytogenes , poly I:C (high molecular weight), poly I:C (low molecular weight), lipopolysaccharide ( Escherichia coli ), flaggellin from Salmonella typhimurium , FSL-1, ssRNA40, and CpG DNA (ODN1826) were purchased from InvivoGen (Mouse TLR1-9 agonist kit). NOD1/2 ligands C12-iE-DAP, iE-DAP, L18-MDP, MDP, M-Tri DAP, M-Tri LYS, Murabutide, PGN-ECndi ultra-pure, PGN-Sandi ultra-pure, and Tri-DAP were purchased from InvivoGen (NOD agonist kit, InvivoGen). E. coli ssDNA and dsDNA, 5′ppp-dsRNA, poly (dA:dT), Curdlan, heat-killed E. coli , and heat-killed Candida albicans were also purchased from InvivoGen. Yoda1 was purchased from Sigma (SML1558) and used to stimulate cells at a concentration of 5 μM. The Wnt signaling activator LiCl was purchased from Nacalai. The calpain inhibitor PD 150606, and the Akt inhibitor AZD 5363 were purchased from Sigma and Cayman Chemical, respectively.
To measure intracellular calcium changes induced by Piezo1 activation in the primary intestinal epithelium, we used Fluo-8 Medium Removal Calcium Assay Kit (AAT Bioquest) as previously described ( Gendaszewska-Darmach et al., 2016 26. Gendaszewska-Darmach, E. ∙ Węgłowska, E. ∙ Walczak-Drzewiecka, A. ... Nucleoside 5′-O-monophosphorothioates as modulators of the P2Y14 receptor and mast cell degranulation Oncotarget. 2016; 7 :69358-69370 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, intestinal epithelia were plated on a 96-well poly- d- lysine–coated plate (1 × 10 5 cells per well) and cultured for 6 h. The cells were then dye-loaded and incubated for a further 1 h. After loading, the cells were stimulated with fecal extracts or Yoda1 and the fluorescence intensity was monitored at excitation/emission wavelengths of 490/520 nm, according to the supplier’s protocol. For Piezo1 ligand screening, we used HEK293T cells overexpressing the Piezo1 expression plasmid (Piezo1-IresGFP/pcDNA3.1, kindly provided by Dr. Ardem Patapoutian). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were cultured with Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) in DMEM (high glucose) with l- glutamine and phenol red containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin (1:200, Life Technologies, USA), and GlutaMax (1:100, Life Technologies) at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO 2 . Fura-2 fluorescence was measured in a standard bath solution (140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH), excited at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, and emission was monitored at 510 nm with a CCD camera (CoolSnap ES; Roper Scientific/Photometrics). Data were acquired by IPlab (Scananalytics), and analyzed by Fiji software. Ionomycin (5 μM) was applied to confirm cell viability.
To investigate Piezo1 activation by ssRNA40, we used HEK293T cells overexpressing Piezo1. The cells were cultured in the same conditions as described above for calcium imaging and the current was measured in the same standard bath solution. The pipette solution contained 140 mM KCl, 5 mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid (EGTA), 10 mM HEPES, adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with KOH. Pipette resistance was approximately 3.0 ± 0.5 M. Currents were recorded using a Multi Clamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 1 kHz with a low-pass filter, and digitized with Axon Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired and analyzed with pCLAMP 11 (Molecular Devices).
Piezo1 -KO Neuro2A (N2A) cells were generated with CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology ( Ran et al., 2013 54. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7786) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two target sequences of guide RNA were designed using GPP sgRNA Designer ( https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design ) and inserted into the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 vector, a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 62988; 5′-gGATACTCACCATGGCACCG-3′ targeting exon 12) ( Ran et al., 2013 54. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7786) PubMed Google Scholar ). N2A cells ( Hatakeyama et al., 2004 29. Hatakeyama, S. ∙ Matsumoto, M. ∙ Kamura, T. ... U-box protein carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) mediates poly-ubiquitylation preferentially on four-repeat Tau and is involved in neurodegeneration of tauopathy J. Neurochem. 2004; 91 :299-307 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ) were transiently transfected with these plasmids using Polyethylenimine Max (Polysciences, 24765) as a carrier. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 4 μg/ml puromycin (invivogen) for 24 h. Puromycin-resistant cells were collected and cloned in a 96-well plate. KO screening was performed by immunoblot analysis. To confirm genome editing, the target site DNA sequence in the genome of candidate clones was amplified by PCR using KOD FX DNA polymerase (KFX-101, Toyobo) and was purified with ExoSAP-IT Express PCR Cleanup Reagents (75001, Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by DNA sequencing (BigDye Terminator v1.1, 4337452, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The following primers were used for PCR and DNA sequencing: F, 5′-TGTCAGCCTGCACCAGTTC-3′; R, 5′- CCTTCACGAACTGACGCAGAAG-3′. To confirm the dysfunction of Piezo1, we observed calcium influx using a pAAV-hSyn1-mRuby2-GSG-P2A-GCaMP6f-WPRE-pA vector, a gift from Tobias Bonhoeffer, Mark Huebener, and Tobias Rose (Addgene plasmid #50943) ( Rose et al., 2016 60. Rose, T. ∙ Jaepel, J. ∙ Hübener, M. ... Cell-specific restoration of stimulus preference after monocular deprivation in the visual cortex Science. 2016; 352 :1319-1322 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ). N2A clones were transiently transfected with the vector using Polyethylenimine Max and then plated on an 8-well chamber (5232-008, Iwaki) at 4 h after transfection. At 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to a recording medium (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM glucose, pH 7.4). The cells were stimulated with 10 μM Yoda1 and the fluorescence intensity was monitored using a confocal microscope.
Twenty-four hours after mPiezo1 transfection of Piezo1-deficient HEK293T cells (kindly provided by Dr. Ardem Patapoutian), whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed with and without ssRNA40. The recording pipette was also used to mechanically stimulate the cells. The pipette movement was controlled by a μMp-3 micromanimpulator (SENSAPEX, Finland) with μMP-MSS software and the μMP-MSC controller (INTER MEDICAL, Japan). Two minutes after establishing the whole-cell condition, the cells were pushed from an approximately 45-degrees axis to the bottom center of the cells. The pushing distance, speed, and duration were 7 μm, 200 μm/sec, and approximately 2 s, respectively (see Video S3 ).

Mechano-Stimulation of Piezo1 KO HEK293T Cells, Related to Figure S5 Representative movie of mehcanostimulation. The recording pipette was used to mechanically stimulate the cells. Two minutes after establishing the whole-cell condition, the cell was pushed from an approximately 45-degrees axis to the bottom center of the cells (pushing distance, speed, and duration were 7 μm, 200 μm/sec, and approximately 2 s, respectively).
TCF/LEF Reporter Kit (BPS Bioscience) was used for transient transfection into RIN14B cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After 24 h transfection of the TCF/LEF reporter with small interfering RNA of Piezo1 (Invitrogen Stealth RNAi siRNA, RSS323781), the cells were stimulated by various ligands for 12 h and luciferase activity was measured.
For AIMD, the mice were supplied antibiotics in their drinking water for 5 weeks, including ampicillin (Sigma, 1 g/l), vancomycin (Sigma, 500 mg/l), neomycin (Sigma, 1 g/l), and metronidazole (Sigma, 1 g/l). Perturbation of microbiota was verified by qPCR using universal 16S rRNA primers, which confirmed that approximately 99% of the fecal bacteria were eliminated in AIMD-induced mice.
To determine the effects of 5-HT administration, 100 μg/g body weight 5-HT (Merck) was intraperitoneally injected daily into 4-week-old female mice. After 4 weeks, the gut and bone phenotypes of these mice were analyzed. For injections of RNase A into the colon, 50 μL of RNase A (PureLink, 20 mg/ml) was suspended in 300 μL of 0.5% Matrigel (Corning) in PBS. A flexible catheter was inserted into the colon of 35-week-old mice, and RNase A containing Matrigel was infused into the colonic lumen. Daily RNase A colonic infusions were performed, and the gut and bone phenotypes of these mice were analyzed after 4 weeks.
Sample size for each animal experiment was n = 5 ∼10. Sample size for each in vitro cell culture experiment was n = 3 ∼13. The mean values of two groups were compared using Student’s t tests. For survival curves, two groups were compared with log-rank tests. These statistical tests were performed with Microsoft Excel. Error bars in all figures indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM).
