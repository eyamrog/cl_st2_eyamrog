Title: mTOR-regulated mitochondrial metabolism limits mycobacterium-induced cytotoxicity


Abstract: Summary

Necrosis of macrophages in the granuloma, the hallmark immunological structure of tuberculosis, is a major pathogenic event that increases host susceptibility. Through a zebrafish forward genetic screen, we identified the mTOR kinase, a master regulator of metabolism, as an early host resistance factor in tuberculosis. We found that mTOR complex 1 protects macrophages from mycobacterium-induced death by enabling infection-induced increases in mitochondrial energy metabolism fueled by glycolysis. These metabolic adaptations are required to prevent mitochondrial damage and death caused by the secreted mycobacterial virulence determinant ESAT-6. Thus, the host can effectively counter this early critical mycobacterial virulence mechanism simply by regulating energy metabolism, thereby allowing pathogen-specific immune mechanisms time to develop. Our findings may explain why Mycobacterium tuberculosis , albeit humanity’s most lethal pathogen, is successful in only a minority of infected individuals.

Section: Introduction

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induces the formation of granulomas, organized structures comprised of macrophages within which mycobacteria reside, and accessory cells ( Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2014 91.

Revisiting the role of the granuloma in tuberculosis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :352-366 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). The granuloma represents a key host-pathogen battleground that determines the outcome of tuberculosis (TB) infection ( Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2014 91. Pagán, A.J. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. Immunity and immunopathology in the tuberculous granuloma Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Med. 2014; 5 :a018499 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ramakrishnan, 2012 102. Ramakrishnan, L. Revisiting the role of the granuloma in tuberculosis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :352-366 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). In most individuals, the granuloma successfully clears Mtb infection, often leaving a residual, sterile, fibrotic structure as a stamp of past infection ( Behr et al., 2019 10.

In contrast, in the minority of people who go on to develop TB, the granuloma often becomes a mycobacterium-beneficial structure that promotes bacterial expansion and dissemination ( Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2014 91.

Immunol. 2012; 12 :352-366 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). Granuloma necrosis is a pivotal pathogenic event because it delivers macrophage-resident mycobacteria into the growth-enhancing extracellular milieu ( Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2014 91.

Microbiol. 2007; 5 :39-47 Crossref Scopus (462) PubMed Google Scholar ). Necrosis of lung granulomas with their attendant rupture into the airways also facilitates transmission, sustaining the global TB burden and promoting Mtb’s evolutionary survival ( Ong et al., 2014 87. Ong, C.W. ∙ Elkington, P.T. ∙ Friedland, J.S. Tuberculosis, pulmonary cavitation, and matrix metalloproteinases Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Immunol. 2012; 12 :352-366 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mtb’s exploitation of the granuloma begins in the innate stage of the response, enabling Mtb to gain a foothold in the host ( Cambier et al., 2014a 20. Cambier, C.J. ∙ Falkow, S. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L.

Zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), a close relative of Mtb, develop TB-like disease with necrotic granulomas ( Cosma et al., 2003 30. Cosma, C.L. ∙ Sherman, D.R. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L.

Ramakrishnan, L. Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenicity viewed through the lens of molecular Koch's postulates Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2020; 54 :103-110 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). The larva’s optical transparency and genetic tractability enables the detailed, sequential monitoring by intravital microscopy of the steps of infection, the contribution of host and pathogen determinants to them, and the consequences to outcome ( Ramakrishnan, 2013 103. Ramakrishnan, L. The zebrafish guide to tuberculosis immunity and treatment Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2013; 78 :179-192 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). The use of unbiased genetic screens and candidate gene approaches in zebrafish larvae has shed light on granuloma biology ( Ramakrishnan, 2013 103. Ramakrishnan, L.

Here, we report on insights into TB pathogenesis and resistance gained from the genetic mapping and characterization of a loss-of-function mutant in mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) that exhibits rapid granuloma necrosis. The mTOR pathway integrates environmental signals emanating from diverse nutrient-sensing and growth factor receptor pathways to regulate biosynthetic and metabolic processes vital for cellular development, growth, survival, and function ( Liu and Sabatini, 2020 73. Liu, G.Y. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. mTOR at the nexus of nutrition, growth, ageing and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :183-203 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ). Iterative experimental approaches in the zebrafish and in human macrophages uncover the mitotoxic function of mycobacterial ESAT-6 and show that mTOR-facilitated mitochondrial metabolism serves as a highly effective innate “counter virulence” factor in TB by exerting a mitoprotective effect against this critical mycobacterial virulence factor.

The zebrafish mutant fh178 , identified in a forward genetic screen ( Tobin et al., 2010 128. Tobin, D.M. ∙ Vary, Jr., J.C. ∙ Ray, J.P. ... The lta4h locus modulates susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish and humans Cell. 2010; 140 :717-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ), was hypersusceptible to Mm, with larvae exhibiting increased bacterial burdens relative to wild-type (WT) and heterozygote siblings following infection into the caudal vein (cv) ( Figures 1 A–1C). By 4 days post-infection (dpi), fh178 mutant granulomas had depleted their macrophages and the released mycobacteria were growing extracellularly in rope-like cords ( Pagán et al., 2015 93. Pagán, A.J. ∙ Yang, C.T. ∙ Cameron, J. ... Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :15-26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tobin et al., 2010 128.

The lta4h locus modulates susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish and humans Cell. 2010; 140 :717-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 D and 1E). Mycobacterial cording, a sensitive and specific surrogate for macrophage depletion, is a readily quantifiable, binary phenotype for mapping mutants rendered hypersusceptible by granuloma necrosis ( Berg et al., 2016 14. Berg, R.D. ∙ Levitte, S. ∙ O'Sullivan, M.P. ... Lysosomal disorders drive susceptibility to tuberculosis by compromising macrophage migration Cell. 2016; 165 :139-152 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tobin et al., 2010 128. Tobin, D.M. ∙ Vary, Jr., J.C. ∙ Ray, J.P. ... The lta4h locus modulates susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish and humans Cell. 2010; 140 :717-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using polymorphic markers and the mycobacterial cording phenotype, we mapped the fh178 mutation to a nonsense mutation in exon 24 of the mtor gene (see STAR Methods ). We confirmed that genetic disruption of mtor was the cause of fh178 hypersusceptibility by showing that animals with a nonsense mutation in exon 19 ( mtor sa16755 ) ( Kettleborough et al., 2013 63. Kettleborough, R.N. ∙ Busch-Nentwich, E.M. ∙ Harvey, S.A. ... A systematic genome-wide analysis of zebrafish protein-coding gene function Nature. 2013; 496 :494-497 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ) also exhibited hypersusceptibility with cording, as did compound fh178/sa16755 heterozygotes ( Figures 1 F and 1G).
mTOR is a kinase that functions in two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that require the adaptors Raptor and Rictor, respectively ( Liu and Sabatini, 2020 73. Liu, G.Y. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. mTOR at the nexus of nutrition, growth, ageing and disease Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21 :183-203 Crossref Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ). Animals with nonsense alleles of rptor , the gene encoding Raptor, showed similar cording to the mtor mutants, whereas those with nonsense alleles of Rictor did not ( Figures 1 H and 1I). Inhibition of mTOR or mTORC1 with torin1 or rapamycin, respectively ( Benjamin et al., 2011 12. Benjamin, D. ∙ Colombi, M. ∙ Moroni, C. ... Rapamycin passes the torch: a new generation of mTOR inhibitors Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2011; 10 :868-880 Crossref Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ), recapitulated genetic mTOR/mTORC1 deficiency with increased cording ( Figure 1 J). Thus, mTORC1 deficiency confers susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, linked to early granuloma breakdown. Because zebrafish larvae have not yet developed adaptive immunity, this reflects innate resistance conferred by mTOR.
At 4 dpi, WT animals had granulomas with sparse intracellular bacteria; in contrast, mTOR-deficient animals had clusters of extracellular bacteria in shapes similar to WT granulomas, suggesting that they had been in granulomas that had broken down due to macrophage death ( Figure 1 D, compare top and bottom). To detail the kinetics of macrophage death, we infected zebrafish larvae in the hindbrain ventricle (hbv), an acellular compartment ideal for monitoring early granuloma formation ( Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009 34. Davis, J.M. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection Cell. 2009; 136 :37-49 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ). Animals rendered mTOR-deficient by rapamycin treatment formed granulomas similar to WT by 2 dpi, but their macrophages died by 3 dpi, leaving clumps of extracellular bacteria ( Figure 2 A).
We hypothesized that mTORC1 deficiency might cause granuloma breakdown through its impairment of myelopoiesis ( Karmaus et al., 2017 62. Karmaus, P.W.F. ∙ Herrada, A.A. ∙ Guy, C. ... Critical roles of mTORC1 signaling and metabolic reprogramming for M-CSF-mediated myelopoiesis J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2629-2647 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2017 68. Lee, P.Y. ∙ Sykes, D.B. ∙ Ameri, S. ... The metabolic regulator mTORC1 controls terminal myeloid differentiation Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaam6641 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). The paucity of available macrophages to replenish the growing granuloma could cause its breakdown, similar to the case of myeloid growth factor colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) deficiency ( Pagán et al., 2015 93. Pagán, A.J. ∙ Yang, C.T. ∙ Cameron, J. ... Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :15-26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Supporting this possibility, mTORC1 promotes myelopoiesis through CSF-1R ( Karmaus et al., 2017 62. Karmaus, P.W.F. ∙ Herrada, A.A. ∙ Guy, C. ... Critical roles of mTORC1 signaling and metabolic reprogramming for M-CSF-mediated myelopoiesis J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2629-2647 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, even though mTORC1-deficient animals had more macrophages at baseline than CSF-1R-deficient animals, their granulomas broke down sooner (2–4 days versus 5–7 for CSF-1R mutants) ( Figure 2 B; Pagán et al., 2015 93. Pagán, A.J. ∙ Yang, C.T. ∙ Cameron, J. ... Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :15-26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that mTOR deficiency induces death of infected granuloma macrophages independently of reducing basal macrophage supply. In support of this, rapamycin treatment after formation of granulomas caused their rapid breakdown ( Figure 2 C). For further confirmation, we used time-lapse microscopy to capture in real-time the death of infected macrophages. If mTOR-deficient granulomas are breaking down due to reduced macrophage replenishment, then dying mTOR mutant macrophages should have bacterial burdens similar to or greater than WT. To assess bacterial burdens in dying macrophages, we used blue fluorescent Mm to infect mTOR-deficient animals and their WT siblings, which had red fluorescent macrophage membranes. All animals were also transgenic for a ubiquitously expressed secreted annexin V tagged with yellow fluorescent protein ( Tg(ubb:secA5-YFP) ), which accumulates on the surface of cells undergoing apoptosis and other modes of regulated cell death ( Bendall and Green, 2014 11. Bendall, L.J. ∙ Green, D.R. Autopsy of a cell Leukemia. 2014; 28 :1341-1343 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). We monitored macrophage death by the appearance of annexin V-YFP labeling of the plasma membrane and membrane blebs followed by the loss of tdTomato fluorescence reflecting plasma membrane disintegration ( Figure 2 D; Video S1 ). In 2 dpi animals, over a 4.5-h imaging period that captured similar numbers of infected macrophages in mTOR-deficient and WT siblings, 6-fold more mTOR-deficient macrophages died ( Figures 2 E and 2F; Video S2 ). Importantly, mTOR-deficient macrophages died with lower bacterial burdens than WT ( Figure 2 G). This finding ruled out numerical macrophage defects as the cause of macrophage death and showed that mTOR-deficient macrophages died because they were “intolerant” of mycobacterial infection.

Death of Mm-infected macrophages in mTOR mutant animals, related to Figure 2 Time-lapse confocal microscopy of mtor fh178/fh178 animals and mTOR-sufficient siblings expressing Tg(mpeg1:YFP) , 2 dpi. Mm (magenta) and macrophages (green). Arrows indicate dying infected macrophages.
To determine whether mTOR’s protective effect was macrophage-intrinsic, we compared mTOR mutant and WT macrophages in the same environment by creating WT-mTOR mutant parabionts with differentially labeled macrophages, red and yellow fluorescent in WT and mTOR mutants, respectively, and infecting both through their respective caudal veins ( Figure 2 H). By 4 dpi, mTOR mutant macrophages had been depleted by more than 90% on both WT and mTOR mutant sides of the parabionts, whereas WT macrophages persisted equally on both sides ( Figure 2 I). The depletion of mTOR mutant macrophages in these animals should not lead to Mm cording because the complement of WT macrophages should be able to engulf the infected mTOR mutant corpses and keep Mm intracellularly. By 4 dpi, as predicted, Mm was only found inside the WT macrophages ( Figure 2 J). In mTOR heterozygote-WT parabionts, mTOR heterozygote yellow fluorescent macrophages survived as well as WT red fluorescent macrophages, ruling out Tg(mpeg1:YFP) expression as an artifactual cause of macrophage depletion of mTOR mutant macrophages ( Figures 2 K and 2L). Thus, mTOR confers early cell-intrinsic protection against Mycobacterium -induced death.

Mammalian autophagy: how does it work? Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :685-713 Crossref Scopus (436) PubMed Google Scholar ). ATG12-deficient animals had defective autophagosome formation as evidenced by reduced LC3 aggregation ( Figures S1 A and S1B). However, ATG12 deficiency did not prevent death of mycobacterium-infected macrophages in rapamycin-treated animals ( Figure S1 C). To assess mitochondrial apoptosis, we used caspase-9 deficient zebrafish mutants ( Galluzzi et al., 2016 45. Galluzzi, L. ∙ Bravo-San Pedro, J.M. ∙ Kepp, O. ... Regulated cell death and adaptive stress responses Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2016; 73 :2405-2410 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Capase-9 mutants had the expected defect in developmental apoptosis as reflected by reduced dead cell debris in the brain at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) ( Figures S1 D and S1E). However, rapamycin treatment induced death of their infected macrophages ( Figure S1 F). Thus, mTOR deficiency kills infected macrophages independent of inducing autophagy or mitochondrial apoptosis.
We ruled out two other modes of macrophage death commonly associated with mycobacterial infection—inflammasome-dependent, mediated through the adapter ASC, and type 1 interferon-dependent, mediated through the cytosolic DNA sensing adapter STING ( Decout et al., 2021 35. Decout, A. ∙ Katz, J.D. ∙ Venkatraman, S. ... The cGAS-STING pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases Nat. Rev.

The NLRP3 inflammasome: molecular activation and regulation to therapeutics Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :477-489 Crossref Scopus (1390) PubMed Google Scholar ). ASC or STING mutants had increased macrophage death when rendered mTOR-deficient ( Figures S2 G and S2H).
In contrast to mTOR deficiency, where macrophages died rapidly when bacterial burdens were still low, mycobacterium-induced macrophage death typically occurs with high intracellular bacterial burdens ( Amaral et al., 2019 1.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces an atypical cell death mode to escape from infected macrophages PLoS One. 2011; 6 :e18367 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ), We had previously identified a case of macrophage death associated with low mycobacterial burdens, which was mediated through a pathway activated by dysregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ( Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013 106. Roca, F.J. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L.

TNF induces pathogenic programmed macrophage necrosis in tuberculosis through a mitochondrial-lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum circuit Cell. 2019; 178 :1344-1361.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). mTOR-deficient macrophage death did not involve this pathway; inhibition of essential components, the kinase RIP1 and the L-type calcium channels, failed to rescue death ( Figures S1 I–S1K). Moreover, mTOR-deficient infected macrophages produced less mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) than WT ones, in contrast to macrophage death in high TNF animals, which is initiated by excess mROS ( Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013 106. Roca, F.J. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L.

Chem. 2006; 281 :27643-27652 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ); our findings suggested that mTOR-dependent increases in mitochondrial metabolism in response to mycobacterial infection constitute a protective metabolic adaptation that prevents pathogenic macrophage death.
To explore this further, we infected the THP-1 human macrophage cell line rendered mTOR-deficient by torin1 treatment. As in the zebrafish, mTOR deficiency increased macrophage death within 1-day post-infection, as indicated by staining with the cell membrane impermeant fixable viability dye eFluor 660 ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Moreover, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) staining showed that infection increased mitochondrial membrane potential in an mTOR-dependent manner ( Murphy, 2009 83. Murphy, M.P. How mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species Biochem. J. 2009; 417 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (5048) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 E and 3F). Consistent with defective mitochondrial metabolism, mTOR-deficient macrophages had slightly lower baseline ATP production, again with a muted infection-induced increase that only reached baseline WT levels ( Figure 3 G).
We found that infection increased mTORC1 signaling, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 ( Battaglioni et al., 2022 6. Battaglioni, S. ∙ Benjamin, D. ∙ Wälchli, M. ... mTOR substrate phosphorylation in growth control Cell. 2022; 185 :1814-1836 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 H–3K). Torin1-treated cells had a small increase in S6 phosphorylation, consistent with residual mTOR activity ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Notably, this increase only reached baseline WT levels, tracking with infection-induced increases in mitochondrial metabolism (mROS and TMRE) to baseline WT levels in mTOR-deficient conditions. Together, these findings suggest that baseline mTOR-facilitated mitochondrial metabolism is insufficient to protect macrophages from mycobacterium-induced death; adaptive infection-induced mTOR activity and corresponding increases in mitochondrial metabolism are required.
To determine whether death of infected mTOR-deficient macrophages was due to mitochondrial damage, we assessed cytochrome c release by flow cytometry ( Lienard et al., 2020 71. Lienard, J. ∙ Nobs, E. ∙ Lovins, V. ... The Mycobacterium marinum ESX-1 system mediates phagosomal permeabilization and type I interferon production via separable mechanisms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :1160-1166 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). More mTOR-deficient infected cells had released cytochrome c than uninfected cells, which had released hardly any ( Figures 4 A and 4B). To confirm that mitochondrial damage was the cause rather than the consequence of death, we checked whether mitochondrial depolarization preceded death. Macrophages infected with blue fluorescent Mm for 32 h were stained with TMRE, which is rapidly lost from the mitochondria upon loss of membrane potential, MitoTracker Deep Red (MTDR), a mitochondrial dye that is more resistant to changes in membrane potential, and Sytox Green, a cell membrane impermeant nucleic acid dye that labels dying cells. Widespread mitochondrial membrane depolarization (near total loss of TMRE) consistently preceded plasma membrane permeabilization and cell death (Sytox positivity) ( Figures 4 C and 4D; Video S3 ). MTDR staining outlasted TMRE staining while preceding Sytox positivity. Moreover, its loss was often incomplete at the time of Sytox positivity, consistent with some retention of mitochondrial architecture at the commencement of the death process. Thus, infection induces widespread mitochondrial damage in mTOR-deficient macrophages, causing cytochrome c release and death. Infection-induced increases in mTOR activity are adaptive, facilitating rapid increases in mitochondrial energy production, which appear to protect against this mycobacterium-mediated lethal mitochondrial damage.

Mitochondrial damage precedes mycobacterium-induced cell death in mTOR-deficient macrophages, related to Figure 4 8-hr time-lapse confocal microscopy of a torin1-treated THP-1 macrophage experiencing mitochondrial damage and subsequently dying (arrow). Note the sequential loss of the mitochondrial dyes TMRE (gold) and MitoTracker Deep Red (magenta) before the macrophages becomes labeled with the cell-membrane impermeant nucleic acid dye Sytox Green that was already in the well. The adjacent viable uninfected cells retained the mitochondrial dyes for the duration of the experiment.
Consistent with mTOR regulating a number of metabolic pathways that regulate mitochondrial metabolism, mTOR inhibition of THP-1 cells caused broad reductions in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathways, and Krebs cycle metabolites ( Düvel et al., 2010 38. Düvel, K. ∙ Yecies, J.L. ∙ Menon, S. ... Activation of a metabolic gene regulatory network downstream of mTOR complex 1 Mol. Cell. 2010; 39 :171-183 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1319) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morita et al., 2013 79. Morita, M. ∙ Gravel, S.P. ∙ Chénard, V. ... mTORC1 controls mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through 4E-BP-dependent translational regulation Cell Metab. 2013; 18 :698-711 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (496) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S3 A). Correspondingly, glycolytic and respiratory capacity were reduced in mTOR-deficient cells with lower basal and ATP-coupled respiration and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) ( Figures S3 G–S3L). These deficits reflected compromised mitochondrial respiration and ATP production at baseline and a reduced ability to boost mitochondrial respiration in response to increased ATP demands. Moreover, mTOR deficiency blunted the small increase in mitochondrial metabolism that was apparent by 24 h post-infection ( Figures S3 H and S3I). At this early stage, however, infection did not alter glucose levels and glycolytic capacity, nor did it alter metabolite abundance in either WT or mTOR-deficient cells ( Figures S3 A–S3F and S3J–S3L). Consistent with mTOR deficiency impairing mitochondrial respiration by reducing glycolysis, selective inhibition of glycolysis with the glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) reduced Krebs cycle metabolites, mitochondrial respiration, and ATP production ( Figures S3 A, S3F, and S3M–S3O; Table S1 ).
Our findings were consistent with a model where mTOR-facilitated glycolytic fueling of the Krebs cycle drives the mitochondrial energy production required to protect infected macrophages from dying. If so, then inhibition of glycolysis should phenocopy mTOR deficiency, causing selective death of infected macrophages with impaired infection-induced increase in mitochondrial membrane potential. 2DG treatment induced both phenotypes in THP-1 cells, similar to torin1 treatment ( Figures 5 A and 5B). mTOR and glycolysis also had a cytoprotective effect in Mtb infection. To assess this, we used mc 2 6206, the isogenic leucine and pantothenate auxotrophic mutant of the virulent H37Rv Mtb strain, a biosafety 2 level pathogen that elicits similar inflammatory responses and triggers diverse cell death programs ( Beckwith et al., 2020 7.

Mtb infection caused increased death of both mTOR-deficient and glycolysis-deficient THP-1 cells ( Figure 5 C). In the zebrafish, 2DG treatment depleted infected macrophages selectively and increased bacterial cording ( Figures 5 D–5G; Video S4 ). Thus, mTOR exerts its cytoprotective effect by supporting glycolysis both in Mm zebrafish infection and Mm- and Mtb-infected human macrophages.

Because glycolysis contributes to mitochondrial ATP production by supplying pyruvate to the Krebs cycle ( Ryan and O'Neill, 2020 111. Ryan, D.G. ∙ O'Neill, L.A.J. Krebs cycle reborn in macrophage immunometabolism Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 38 :289-313 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), intercepting this step should also produce bacterial cording. Inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier with UK5099 similarly increased bacterial cording ( Halestrap, 1975 53. Halestrap, A.P. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. Kinetics and specificity for substrates and inhibitors Biochem. J. 1975; 148 :85-96 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 H). mTOR-facilitated glycolysis also feeds the pentose phosphate pathway ( Patra and Hay, 2014 97. Patra, K.C. ∙ Hay, N. The pentose phosphate pathway and cancer Trends Biochem. Sci. 2014; 39 :347-354 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 A). Zebrafish mutants deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, did not have increased bacterial cording, ruling out the contribution of this pathway to mTOR-mediated resistance ( Figures S3 P and S3Q). Thus, mTOR deficiency sensitizes macrophages to Mm-induced mitochondrial damage and death by impairing glycolysis-dependent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and thereby mitochondrial energy production. Consistent with this, genetic disruption of the electron transport chain complex 1 by targeting the assembly factor NDUFAF1 increased bacterial cording ( Formosa et al., 2018 43. Formosa, L.E. ∙ Dibley, M.G. ∙ Stroud, D.A. ... Building a complex complex: assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 76 :154-162 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 5 I).
The mTOR mutant had unmasked the potential of pathogenic mycobacteria to cause lethal mitochondrial damage in infected macrophages. We hypothesized that a specific mycobacterial determinant caused this damage. Our prime candidate was ESAT-6 secretion system 1 (ESX-1)because (1) it accelerates mycobacterium-induced macrophage death in WT (mTOR-sufficient) conditions, including in the zebrafish ( Conrad et al., 2017 28.

Lienard, J. ∙ Nobs, E. ∙ Lovins, V. ... The Mycobacterium marinum ESX-1 system mediates phagosomal permeabilization and type I interferon production via separable mechanisms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The mechanism for Type I interferon induction by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is bacterial strain-dependent PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 :e1005809 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whereas in WT macrophages, ESX-1-dependent death requires high intramacrophage bacterial burdens ( Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009 34. Davis, J.M. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection Cell. 2009; 136 :37-49 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ; Volkman et al., 2004 133. Volkman, H.E. ∙ Clay, H. ∙ Beery, D. ... Tuberculous granuloma formation is enhanced by a mycobacterium virulence determinant PLoS Biol. 2004; 2 :e367 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that mTOR-deficiency sensitizes macrophages to ESX-1-mediated mitochondrial damage, causing death at low bacterial burdens. Consistent with our hypothesis, mTOR-deficient THP-1 macrophages infected with ESX-1-deficient Mm did not have increased cytochrome c release nor increased death ( Figures 6 A and 6B; Video S5 ). In mTOR-deficient zebrafish infected with ESX-1-deficient Mm, infected macrophages did not die ( Figures 6 C–6E; Video S6 ). ESX-1-deficient infection also did not cause macrophage death in animals deficient in glycolysis or OXPHOS ( Figures 6 F–6H). Thus, a mycobacterium-induced, mTOR-dependent increase in mitochondrial metabolism specifically counters ESX-1-dependent mitochondrial damage and cell death.

To determine whether ESX-1-mediated phagosomal damage was integral to its mitotoxicity in mTOR-deficient macrophages, we tested the Mm mmpL7 mutant. mmpL7 mutant Mm infection did not kill mTOR-deficient macrophages, as evidenced by the lack of cording in the animals ( Figure 6 I). In contrast, Mm mutants in the virulence determinants Erp and MarP, which do not mediate phagosomal damage and promote intramacrophage growth through distinct mechanisms from ESX-1, did accelerate macrophage death in mTOR-deficient animals ( Berthet et al., 1998 15.

Thus, ESX-1-dependent phagosomal permeabilization is a pre-requisite for its cytotoxicity to mTOR-deficient macrophages.
ESX-1’s membranolytic activity has been ascribed to its major secreted substrate, ESAT-6 (6 kDa early secretory antigenic target); however, pinning down its role versus those of other ESX-1 substrates has been complicated by their co-dependency for secretion, as deletion of ESAT-6 causes loss of other ESX-1 substrates ( Bao et al., 2021 4.

Mutually dependent secretion of proteins required for mycobacterial virulence Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :10676-10681 Crossref Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent work has pinpointed a specific role for ESAT-6 in phagosomal damage and virulence by identifying point mutations in ESAT-6 that allow substantial levels of secretion of ESAT-6 and other ESX-1 substrates yet cause loss of phagosomal membrane damage and/or virulence ( Brodin et al., 2005 18.

Rep. 2016; 6 :32618 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test the specific role of ESAT-6-induced phagosomal damage in mediating cell death in mTOR deficiency, we used esxA (ESAT-6) mutant Mm expressing either of two such ESAT-6 C-terminal point mutations, M83I and M93T ( Brodin et al., 2005 18. Brodin, P. ∙ de Jonge, M.I. ∙ Majlessi, L. ...

USA. 2022; 119 e2122161119 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mm-ESAT-6 M83I and Mm-ESAT-6 M93T infections did not kill macrophages in mTOR-deficient zebrafish ( Figure 6 J). Thus, ESAT-6 causes the phagosomal damage required for the cell death induced by mTOR deficiency.
mTOR-deficiency might simply sensitize phagosomes to ESAT-6-mediated damage. However, mTOR-deficient and WT macrophages had similar ESAT-6-dependent increases in phagosomal damage, showing that this was not the case and instead suggesting that mTOR-deficient macrophages were sensitized to ESAT-6-mediated mitochondrial damage ( Figure 7 A, upper panels and 7 B, black symbols).
ESAT-6 might mediate mitochondrial damage in mTOR-deficient macrophages indirectly or directly. In the indirect case, ESAT-6 would only be required to permeabilize phagosomes, enabling host lysosomal factors or other mycobacterial determinant(s) to access and damage mitochondria. In the direct case, ESAT-6 would also be required after the phagosome has been permeabilized. To distinguish between the two, we treated THP-1 cells with prazosin (PRZ), a drug that permeabilizes endo-lysosomal compartments in myeloid cells ( Kozik et al., 2020 65. Kozik, P. ∙ Gros, M. ∙ Itzhak, D.N. ... Small molecule enhancers of endosome-to-cytosol import augment anti-tumor immunity Cell Rep. 2020; 32 :107905 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). By 7 h of treatment, PRZ had caused extensive endo-lysosomal damage in uninfected control and mTOR-deficient macrophages ( Figure S4 C). In infected macrophages, PRZ caused similar increases in damaged WT and ESX-1-deficient mycobacterial phagosomes ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Moreover, the proportion of WT and ESX-1-mutant mycobacteria associated with damaged phagosomes was similar, showing that the PRZ-induced phagosomal permeabilization could equalize access of WT and ESX-1-deficient mycobacteria to the mitochondria ( Figure 7 C). Consistent with increasing bacterial exposure to mitochondria, PRZ increased cytochrome c release from WT-infected macrophages ( Figure 7 D). PRZ-treated ESX-1 mutant-infected macrophages had a much smaller increase in cytochrome c release and significantly lower than in untreated WT macrophages ( Figure 7 D). The small increase in cytochrome c release in ESX-1-mutant infection suggests that additional factors may also play a role, for instance, PDIM. To corroborate these conclusions in vivo , we assessed bacterial cording in zebrafish with and without PRZ treatment. As before, mTOR deficiency caused cording of WT but not ESX-1-deficient bacteria ( Figure 7 E). PRZ treatment of mTOR mutants increased ESX-1-mutant cording only slightly and significantly less than WT bacteria without PRZ ( Figure 7 E).
Next, we tested whether ESAT-6 was responsible for the mitochondrial damage by assessing bacterial cording of ESAT-6-mutant bacteria in zebrafish with and without PRZ treatment. As with ESX-1 mutant infections, PRZ treatment did not restore bacterial cording of ESAT-6 mutants ( Figure 7 F). These findings implicate ESAT-6 in mediating mitochondrial damage after first damaging the phagosome to enable access. ESAT-6 possesses both phagosomal and mitochondrial damaging activity and mTOR protects specifically against the latter. Our findings highlight the role of mTOR as a “counter-virulence” factor against ESAT-6 and indicate that even a small amount of ESAT-6 is sufficient to induce cytotoxicity in mTOR-deficient macrophages. mTOR-deficient macrophages tolerate infection with mycobacteria so long as they lack functional ESAT-6.

Section: Discussion

Conversion to combined therapy with sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil improved renal function in stable renal transplant recipients J. Formos. Med. Assoc. 2007; 106 :372-379 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). This susceptibility has generally been ascribed to compromised adaptive immunity ( Weichhart et al., 2015 136. Weichhart, T. ∙ Hengstschläger, M. ∙ Linke, M. Regulation of innate immune cell function by mTOR Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :599-614 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show here that mTOR deficiency results in profound, innate susceptibility to mycobacteria resulting from the rapid death of infected macrophages. This death results from catastrophic mitochondrial damage caused by mycobacterial ESAT-6. Thus, mTOR-facilitated mitochondrial metabolism represents a formidable armor against a potent mycobacterial mitotoxin. This study adds to the appreciation that while intracellular microbes can exploit host cell metabolism for growth and pathogenesis, the cells’ metabolic capabilities can also avert microbial attack ( Pernas, 2021 99. Pernas, L. Cellular metabolism in the defense against microbes J. Cell Sci. 2021; 134 :jcs252023 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our findings provide insight into the adaptive metabolic changes that occur upon mycobacterial infection. Stimulation of cultured macrophages with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major Gram-negative bacterial virulence determinant, induces a metabolic switch from mitochondrial OXPHOS to glycolysis under normoxic conditions ( O'Neill and Pearce, 2016 86. O'Neill, L.A. ∙ Pearce, E.J. Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :15-23 Crossref Scopus (838) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weichhart et al., 2015 136. Weichhart, T. ∙ Hengstschläger, M. ∙ Linke, M. Regulation of innate immune cell function by mTOR Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :599-614 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). This switch, which occurs through mTORC1 activation, enables macrophages to elaborate antimicrobial responses that depend on cataplerosis of Krebs cycle intermediates ( O'Neill and Pearce, 2016 86. O'Neill, L.A. ∙ Pearce, E.J. Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :15-23 Crossref Scopus (838) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether Mtb infection induces this glycolytic switch is unclear; studies variably find that it boosts or represses glycolysis ( Braverman et al., 2016 17.

Shi, L. ∙ Salamon, H. ∙ Eugenin, E.A. ... Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces the Warburg effect in mouse lungs Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :18176 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). We find here that early in infection, Mm infection of cultured human macrophages induces OXPHOS without altering glycolysis. This is consistent with our findings in the zebrafish, where Mm- and Mtb-infected macrophages exhibit small increases in mitochondrial respiration early on ( Roca et al., 2022 107. Roca, F.J. ∙ Whitworth, L.J. ∙ Prag, H.A. ... Tumor necrosis factor induces pathogenic mitochondrial ROS in tuberculosis through reverse electron transport Science. 2022; 376 eabh2841 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although adaptive glycolytic shifts may occur later in infection, mTORC1’s role in early resistance to mycobacteria stems not from a glycolytic shift but from the boost in OXPHOS from its stimulation of glycolysis ( Weichhart et al., 2015 136. Weichhart, T. ∙ Hengstschläger, M. ∙ Linke, M. Regulation of innate immune cell function by mTOR Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :599-614 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is demonstrated by our finding that directly inhibiting OXPHOS confers susceptibility.
How does ESAT-6 damage mitochondria? Mm and Mtb phagosomes frequently fuse to lysosomes, and contacts between lysosomes and mitochondria are proposed to facilitate metabolic exchanges between these organelles ( Armstrong and Hart, 1971 2.

Mitochondria-lysosome contacts regulate mitochondrial fission via RAB7 GTP hydrolysis Nature. 2018; 554 :382-386 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). The idea that mycobacterial phagolysosomes influence mitochondrial function is reinforced by the finding that mitochondria aggregate around these structures and undergo morphological changes ( Jamwal et al., 2013 60. Jamwal, S. ∙ Midha, M.K. ∙ Verma, H.N. ... Characterizing virulence-specific perturbations in the mitochondrial function of macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sci.

Mycobacterial control of host mitochondria: bioenergetic and metabolic changes shaping cell fate and infection outcome Front. Cell. Infect. Microbiol. 2020; 10 :457 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that direct contact is required for ESAT-6 permeabilization of host membranes ( Conrad et al., 2017 28. Conrad, W.H. ∙ Osman, M.M. ∙ Shanahan, J.K. ... Mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system mediates host cell lysis through bacterium contact-dependent gross membrane disruptions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :1371-1376 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), ESAT-6 might specifically damage membranes of mitochondria that are in direct contact with permeabilized phagosomes. Indeed, ESX-1 is reported to cause some mitochondrial damage in mTOR-sufficient cells, as evidenced by reductions in mitochondrial mass, membrane potential loss, and release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial DNA ( Chen et al., 2008 24.

The finding that in mTOR deficiency, infection with very few ESX-1/ESAT-6-expressing mycobacteria, likely confined to a single phagosome/phagolysosome, causes global loss of mitochondrial membrane potential suggests that there is rapid propagation of the initial localized damage. The lack of rapid repair or replacement of damaged mitochondria in the absence of mTOR-regulated biosynthetic processes may account for this ( Cunningham et al., 2007 32.

Chem. 2006; 281 :27643-27652 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential has been shown to cause structural changes in the mitochondria—matrix condensation and unfolding of cristae—that facilitate cytochrome c release upon exposure to outer membrane disrupters like BAX family proteins ( Gottlieb et al., 2003 50. Gottlieb, E. ∙ Armour, S.M. ∙ Harris, M.H. ... Mitochondrial membrane potential regulates matrix configuration and cytochrome c release during apoptosis Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10 :709-717 Crossref Scopus (522) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar changes from mTOR deficiency could cause global mitochondrial catastrophe when subjected to ESAT-6’s mitotoxic effects. As in that report, we too find that disruption of respiration at complex I phenocopies the ESAT-6-mediated death produced by mTOR deficiency.

Rep. 2016; 6 :32618 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show here that ESAT-6 induces phagosomal damage irrespective of whether the macrophage is mTOR-sufficient or -deficient. mTOR’s specific role is in resistance against ESAT-6-mediated catastrophic mitochondrial damage that rapidly kills the cell. We do not know whether ESAT-6 is sufficient for mitochondrial damage in mTOR deficiency. ESX-1 is responsible for plasma membrane damage in mTOR-sufficient cells and there, too, it is not clear exactly how damage is mediated—studies have variably implicated ESAT-6, other ESX-1 substrates, non-ESX-1 mycobacterial products, and excess lipoxins ( Beckwith et al., 2020 7.

For the mitochondrial damage in mTOR deficiency, PDIM may facilitate ESAT-6’s role in addition to facilitating ESAT-6-mediated phagosomal damage.
TB is notorious for killing far more people over the millennia than any other infectious agent ( Paulson, 2013 98. Paulson, T. Epidemiology: A mortal foe Nature. 2013; 502 :S2-S3 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, our recent epidemiological analyses show that most individuals clear Mtb infection through a combination of innate and adaptive immunity ( Behr et al., 2018 9. Behr, M.A. ∙ Edelstein, P.H. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis BMJ. 2018; 362 :k2738 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 10. Behr, M.A. ∙ Edelstein, P.H. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. Is Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection life long? BMJ. 2019; 367 :l5770 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our work finds that tapping into mTOR-regulated homeostatic metabolic pathways constitutes a major host defense strategy. Curiously, these pathways protect against a specific mycobacterial virulence determinant, identifying mTOR as a counter-virulence factor against ESAT-6, where mTOR averts its catastrophic mitotoxicity to buy the host time to call in other “classical” immune defenses that can clear infection much of the time. In the minority of individuals, ESAT-6 and other mycobacterial virulence factors win out, allowing the evolutionary survival of the pathogen as well ( Cambier et al., 2014a 20. Cambier, C.J. ∙ Falkow, S. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. Host evasion and exploitation schemes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Cell. 2014; 159 :1497-1509 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, the modes of cell death that ESAT-6 produces in WT hosts through phagosomal or plasma membrane damage likely represent workarounds in mycobacterium’s pathogenic strategy ( Beckwith et al., 2020 7.

Therapies targeting mTOR are being explored for a number of conditions, including aging. Genetic and pharmacological mTOR inhibition can increase lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, and mice ( Papadopoli et al., 2019 96.

Saxton, R.A. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. MTOR signaling in growth, metabolism, and disease Cell. 2017; 168 :960-976 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2897) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pilot studies of a short course of pharmacological mTOR inhibition in older human volunteers report increased responses to influenza vaccines (suggesting decreased immune senescence) and a reduction in self-reported viral respiratory infections ( Mannick et al., 2014 75. Mannick, J.B. ∙ Del Giudice, G. ∙ Lattanzi, M. ... mTOR inhibition improves immune function in the elderly Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6 :268ra179 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 76.

Med. 2018; 10 :eaaq1564 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, in lung TB patients receiving adjunctive mTOR inhibition therapy together with appropriate antimicrobial treatment had possible, transient improvement in lung function ( Wallis et al., 2021 134. Wallis, R.S. ∙ Ginindza, S. ∙ Beattie, T. ... Adjunctive host-directed therapies for pulmonary tuberculosis: a prospective, open-label, phase 2, randomised controlled trial Lancet Respir. Med. 2021; 9 :897-908 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). In a mouse model of severe TB, mTOR inhibition therapy induced host-beneficial or -detrimental effects depending on the treatment regimen; mTOR inhibition therapy reduced lung immunopathology in established infections when given in conjunction with an antimicrobial drug, but exacerbated lung damage and morbidity when administered alone in the early infection ( Bhatt et al., 2021 16. Bhatt, K. ∙ Bhagavathula, M. ∙ Verma, S. ... Rapamycin modulates pulmonary pathology in a murine model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection Dis. Model. Mech. 2021; 14 :dmm049018 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our finding that mTOR inhibitors dramatically increase susceptibility to pathogenic mycobacteria warrants caution in their use as anti-aging or immune boosting therapies in the many areas of the world with a high burden of TB.
How ESAT-6 causes the mitochondrial damage that ultimately triggers cell death in mTOR deficiency remains to be determined. ESAT-6 may directly permeabilize the outer membrane of mitochondria in close proximity to permeabilized phagosomes or induce mitochondrial damage by cooperating with host or mycobacterial molecules with intrinsic mitotoxic activity. Furthermore, how reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential specifically increase sensitivity to ESAT-6-mediated mitotoxicity remains unclear. Identifying the molecular players in the cell death cascade and the alterations in mitochondrial structure and function in mTOR deficiency, and specifically in response to ESAT-6-mediated damage, should help to clarify these processes.

Zebrafish of the WIK strain (ZIRC) were used to map mtor fh178 . Zebrafish were maintained in buffered reverse osmotic water systems under a 14-hr light/10-hr dark cycle. Zebrafish larvae were fed paramecia twice daily, while juvenile and adult zebrafish were fed at least twice a day with dry food and brine shrimp. Zebrafish embryos were collected and cultured in reverse osmosis water containing 0.18g/L Instant Ocean Salt supplemented with 0.25μg/mL methylene blue at 28.5°C. On 1 dpf, embryos to be used in experiments were transferred to 0.5x E2 medium (7.5mM NaCl, 0.25mM KCl, 0.5mM MgSO 4 , 0.075mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0.025mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.5mM CaCl 2 , and 0.35mM NaHCO 3 ) supplemented with 0.003% PTU (1-phenyl-2-thiourea, Sigma) to inhibit melanin synthesis.
For infections, 2 dpf larvae of undetermined sex (due to early developmental stage) were dechorionated manually or with ≤0.5mg/mL pronase (Sigma-Aldrich) and then anesthetized with fish water containing 0.025% tricaine (Sigma). Larvae were injected via the caudal vein or the hindbrain ventricle using single-cell suspensions of Mm of known titer to deliver ∼100 - 250 bacteria per 3 – 5 nL injection as previously described ( Takaki et al., 2013 124. Takaki, K. ∙ Davis, J.M. ∙ Winglee, K. ... Evaluation of the pathogenesis and treatment of Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1114-1124 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phenol red sodium salt (≤ 1% w/v diluted in PBS, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an injection tracer. Inoculums were confirmed by injecting onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates (supplemented with oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and Tween-80 plus hygromycin B or kanamycin, as appropriate. For experiments with mutant lines, wild-type and heterozygous siblings were used as comparators, animals were genotyped after data acquisition. In experiments involving drug treatments, infected animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Unless indicated, treatments were initiated immediately after infection via soaking, and drug exposure was maintained until the experimental endpoint. UK5099 (Cambridge Bioscience) was changed daily.
Monocytic human THP-1 cells (ATCC) were grown at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), L-glutamine (Gibco), Penicillin, and Streptomycin (complete RPMI). To differentiate THP-1 cells into macrophages, cells were seeded at 5 x 10 5 cells/mL in flat-bottomed tissue culture plates (2.5 x 10 5 cells/well of 24-well plate) and stimulated with 100nM PMA Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) for two days. The resulting adherent cells were then washed with complete RPMI and rested for two days prior to infection. For microscopy experiments, cells were plated on optical bottom plates (Perkin Elmer or MatTek). Cells were pre-incubated overnight with pharmacological compounds or matching concentrations of vehicle (≤0.5% DMSO). On the infection day, cells were washed with antibiotic-free complete RPMI and infected with single-cell suspensions of Mm or Mtb for five hours in a 33°C, 5% CO 2 incubator (for Mm) and 37°C, 5% CO 2 incubator (for Mtb). After infection, cells were washed with antibiotic-free complete RPMI supplemented with the corresponding pharmacological compounds and returned to the appropriate incubators. For experiments with the leucine and pantothenate double auxotroph ΔleuDΔpanCD Mtb, complete RMPI was also supplemented with 0.05 mg/mL L-leucine and 0.024 mg/mL calcium pantothenate (Sigma-Aldrich). Multiplicity of infection was determined by calculating the number of mycobacterial colony forming units (CFU) per cells plated in each well.

DNA from adult fin clips or whole larvae was extracted using the HotSHOT method ( Truett et al., 2000 129. Truett, G.E. ∙ Heeger, P. ∙ Mynatt, R.L. ... Preparation of PCR-quality mouse genomic DNA with hot sodium hydroxide and tris (HotSHOT) BioTechniques. 2000; 29 :52 54 Crossref Scopus (1025) PubMed Google Scholar ). Animals were genotyped by High Resolution Melt Analysis (HRMA) of PCR products ( Garritano et al., 2009 47. Garritano, S. ∙ Gemignani, F. ∙ Voegele, C. ... Determining the effectiveness of high resolution melting analysis for SNP genotyping and mutation scanning at the TP53 locus BMC Genet. 2009; 10 :5 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) or by Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) assay (LGC Biosearch) ( He et al., 2014 57. He, C. ∙ Holme, J. ∙ Anthony, J. SNP genotyping: the KASP assay Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1145 :75-86 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) in a CFX Connect thermocycler (BioRad). DNA from 2DG-treated animals was purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions prior to PCR.
Zebrafish carrying the fh178 allele were outcrossed to the WIK strain for mapping as previously described ( Tobin et al., 2010 128. Tobin, D.M. ∙ Vary, Jr., J.C. ∙ Ray, J.P. ... The lta4h locus modulates susceptibility to mycobacterial infection in zebrafish and humans Cell. 2010; 140 :717-730 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ). fh178 was mapped to chromosome 8 initially between the markers z7370 and z14670. Further mapping defined a critical two-gene interval that included mtor and qars1 to the right of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 3’ end of angptl7 (1 recombination in 302 meioses) and to the left of a polymorphism in intron 2 of ogg1 (2 recombinations in 300 meioses). Sequencing of cDNAs isolated from mutants and wild-type animals in the critical region identified a stop codon in exon 24 of mtor in the mutant but not wild-type animals. This mutation segregated absolutely with the fh178 mutants (no recombinants).
The Tol2 ubb:secA5-YFP plasmid was assembled from PCR-amplified fragments of pDestTol2pA2_ubi:EGFP (RRID: Addgene 27323) ( Mosimann et al., 2011 81. Mosimann, C. ∙ Kaufman, C.K. ∙ Li, P. ... Ubiquitous transgene expression and Cre-based recombination driven by the ubiquitin promoter in zebrafish Development. 2011; 138 :169-177 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ) and pBH-UAS-secA5-YFP (RRID: Addgene 32359) ( van Ham et al., 2010 131. van Ham, T.J. ∙ Mapes, J. ∙ Kokel, D. ... Live imaging of apoptotic cells in zebrafish FASEB J. 2010; 24 :4336-4342 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) the Gibson Cloning kit (New England Biolabs). Correct plasmid assembly was confirmed by diagnostic PCR of joined segments and by Sanger sequencing. Tol2 transposase (RRID: Addgene 51818) ( Khattak et al., 2014 64. Khattak, S. ∙ Murawala, P. ∙ Andreas, H. ... Optimized axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) husbandry, breeding, metamorphosis, transgenesis and tamoxifen-mediated recombination Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :529-540 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) was in vitro transcribed with the T7 mMessage/mMachine kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tol2 ubb:secA5-YFP plasmid and transposase mRNA were co-injected into one-cell embryos of the wild-type AB strain as previously described ( Suster et al., 2011 121. Suster, M.L. ∙ Abe, G. ∙ Schouw, A. ... Transposon-mediated BAC transgenesis in zebrafish Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :1998-2021 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). G0 larvae expressing the transgene were identified by fluorescence microscopy and raised to adulthood. Potential founders were identified through pairwise crosses of G0 adults and non-transgenic AB fish. A single F1 transgenic animal was used to establish the line.
The mutagenesis procedure was adapted from published methods ( Burger et al., 2016 19. Burger, A. ∙ Lindsay, H. ∙ Felker, A. ...

Cell. 2018; 46 :112-125.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). Guide RNAs (60 μM) were generated by complexing equimolar amounts of Alt-R tracrRNA and individual ndufaf1 -specific Alt-R crRNAs (Dr.Cas9.NDUFAF1.1.AA, AB, AC, and AD; IDT) in nuclease-free Duplex Buffer (IDT) at 95°C for 5 minutes. Aliquots of complexed RNA were stored at -20°C. To produce ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) (10 μM), guide RNA pools were combined with Alt-R Sp Cas9 Nuclease V3 (IDT) at an equimolar ratio of total RNA to Cas9 in working buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Wild-type zebrafish of the AB strain were injected at the 1-cell stage with ∼2 nL of RNP to create G0 crispants or ∼2nl of working buffer to produce unmutagenized experimental control animals. Mutagenesis was assessed in individual animals by HRMA of PCR amplicon spanning each of the CRISPR targets.
Parabiosis of zebrafish embryos was performed as previously described ( Demy et al., 2013 36. Demy, D.L. ∙ Ranta, Z. ∙ Giorgi, J.M. ... Generating parabiotic zebrafish embryos for cell migration and homing studies Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :256-258 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, blastulae derived from synchronized mtor fh178/+ ; Tg(mpeg1:YFP) w200 and Tg(mpeg1:tdTomato) incrosses were manually dechorionated, paired, scratched with an aluminum silicate microinjection needle, and allowed to fuse in high-calcium Ringer’s solution (116 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 U/mL streptomycin. Only parabiotic pairs fused at the head, devoid of gross morphological abnormalities, and sharing blood circulation were used in experiments. On 2 dpf, each parabiotic animal was infected via the caudal vein to ensure similar distribution of mycobacteria between the pair’s caudal hematopoietic tissues. The bodies of each parabiotic pair were micro-dissected and individually genotyped after completion of the experiment.
Widefield fluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described ( Takaki et al., 2013 124. Takaki, K. ∙ Davis, J.M. ∙ Winglee, K. ... Evaluation of the pathogenesis and treatment of Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1114-1124 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial burdens were determined with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope using a 4x objective and running a fluorescent pixel counts macro in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) ( Takaki et al., 2013 124. Takaki, K. ∙ Davis, J.M. ∙ Winglee, K. ... Evaluation of the pathogenesis and treatment of Mycobacterium marinum infection in zebrafish Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1114-1124 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Macrophages were counted manually with a Nikon Eclipse E600 upright microscope using a 20x objective. For serial imaging of individual zebrafish, larvae were housed individually in 96-well plates under standard husbandry conditions.
Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed as described ( Pagán et al., 2015 93. Pagán, A.J. ∙ Yang, C.T. ∙ Cameron, J. ... Myeloid growth factors promote resistance to mycobacterial infection by curtailing granuloma necrosis through macrophage replenishment Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :15-26 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Larvae were anesthetized in PTU-supplemented 0.5x E2 medium containing 0.025% tricaine and embedded in 2% low melt agarose (TopVision) on optical-bottom plates (MatTek). Imaging was performed with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope using 20x or 40x objectives and the galvano or resonant scanners. 0.9 - 2 μm optical sections were combined to generate 15 - 60 μm z stacks. For time-lapse microscopy of zebrafish larvae, imaging was done at 27°C using a microscope incubator (Okolab), using acquisition intervals of 2 - 5 minutes for 6 hours. For serial imaging of individual zebrafish, larvae were removed from the agarose using jeweler’s forceps and housed individually under standard husbandry conditions. For time-lapse microscopy of Mm-infected THP-1 cells, samples were imaged at 33°C, 5% CO 2 in antibiotic-free, phenol-free complete RPMI containing 50 nM SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Invitrogen) for 4 hours.
The acquired images were processed using the denoising feature in the Elements software (Nikon). The surface rendering feature of Imaris (Bitplane) was used to quantify intramacrophage bacterial burdens and mROS levels; the number of acridine orange foci in the midbrain and LC3 puncta in neuromasts, clusters of mechanosensory hair cells of the lateral line in fish; phospho-S6 and total S6 MFIs, and the frequencies of galectin-8-associated Mm per imaging field ( Thomas et al., 2015 126.

Biol. 2015; 4 :1-16 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). The numbers of dying macrophages and macrophages with galectin-8-decorated Mm foci were counted manually.
Zebrafish larvae were transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and stained with 1 mL of 2.4μg/mL acridine orange in 0.5x E2 medium with PTU for 30 minutes with rotation and protected from light ( Roca et al., 2019 108.

TNF induces pathogenic programmed macrophage necrosis in tuberculosis through a mitochondrial-lysosomal-endoplasmic reticulum circuit Cell. 2019; 178 :1344-1361.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stained larvae were then rinsed in 0.5x E2 medium with PTU and imaged by confocal microscopy.
Zebrafish larvae were injected with ∼1 nL of 10 mM MitoTracker Red CMXH 2 -Xros via the caudal vein immediately prior to imaging by confocal microscopy ( Roca and Ramakrishnan, 2013 106. Roca, F.J. ∙ Ramakrishnan, L. TNF dually mediates resistance and susceptibility to mycobacteria via mitochondrial reactive oxygen species Cell. 2013; 153 :521-534 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ).
THP-1 macrophages were incubated with 40nM MitoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher) and/or 100 nM tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE) (Abcam) for 20 minutes in a 37°C, 5% CO 2 incubator according to the manufacturers’ instructions. For flow cytometric analysis of TMRE, cells were then washed with complete RPMI media, stained with FVD eF660, and run without chemical fixation.
The staining procedure was performed as previously described ( Osman et al., 2020 89. Osman, M.M. ∙ Pagán, A.J. ∙ Shanahan, J.K. ... Mycobacterium marinum phthiocerol dimycocerosates enhance macrophage phagosomal permeabilization and membrane damage PLoS One. 2020; 15 :e0233252 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). THP-1 cells were fixed in PFA solution (4% w/v paraformaldehyde in PBS) at room temperature (RT) for at least 30 minutes. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated in permeabilization/block (PB) solution (0.1% Triton-X 100, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 minutes at RT, and subsequently stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated rabbit anti-phospho-S6 S235/S236 or total S6 (Cell Signaling Technology) or goat anti-human galectin-8 antibody (R&D Systems) diluted in PB solution overnight at 4°C. The following day, cells stained with the galectin-8 antibody were washed three times with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Thermo Fisher) in PB solution for one hour at RT. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and maintained in PBS for imaging by confocal microscopy. In some experiments, cells nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (10μg/mL) for 20 minutes at RT prior to imaging.
THP-1 macrophages were stained with eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye (FVD) eFluor 660 (Thermo Fisher), detached with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), and transferred to polystyrene FACS tubes (Sarstedt). Single-cell suspensions were washed with MACS buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2mM EDTA in PBS, ph7.2) at 290 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C, and in most cases, fixed in 4% PFA solution overnight at 4°C. The following day, samples were washed with and resuspended in MACS buffer. Data were acquired in LSRII or Fortessa flow cytometers (BD Biosciences) and analyzed in FlowJo 10 (TreeStar), gating on single-cell events.
The cytochrome c release assay was adapted from Lienard et al. (2020) 71. Lienard, J. ∙ Nobs, E. ∙ Lovins, V. ... The Mycobacterium marinum ESX-1 system mediates phagosomal permeabilization and type I interferon production via separable mechanisms Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :1160-1166 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar . 7 hours after infection with tdTomato-expressing Mm, cells were stained with eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye (FVD) eFluor 660 (Thermo Fisher), detached with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), transferred to polystyrene FACS tubes (Sarstedt), and washed first with ice-cold MACS buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 2mM EDTA in PBS, ph7.2) and then ice-cold PBS by centrifugation at 290 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cells were incubated in ice-cold permeabilization buffer (50 μg/mL digitonin, 100 mM KCl) for 5 minutes and immediately fixed in 4% PFA solution to stop the permeabilization reaction. Cells were then centrifuged as above and fixed overnight in 4% PFA solution at 4°C. Samples were subsequently permeabilized with eBioscience Permeabilization Buffer (Thermo Fisher) and stained with AlexaFluor 488 anti-cytochrome c antibody (BioLegend) for 2 hours at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry by gating on the viable, infected (FVD eFluor 660 - tdTomato + ) single-cell events.
ATP levels were quantified by fluorimetry in a CLARIOStar Plus (BMG Labtech) microplate reader using the ATP Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 10 6 THP-1 macrophages were analyzed per replicate.
Individual 5 dpf larvae from an g6pd sa24272/+ incross were lysed using Mammalian Cell Lysis Buffer (Abcam). A small amount of each lysate was used to genotype the larvae. G6PD activity in individual larvae was determined by fluorimetry in a CLARIOStar Plus (BMG Labtech) microplate reader using the G6PD Activity Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For metabolite quantification, THP-1 cells (2 x 10 6 cells/sample, four replicates/condition) were washed in ice-cold PBS, and metabolites were extracted with 150 μL extraction buffer (50:30:20, methanol:acetonitrile:water) cooled on dry ice for 30 minutes beforehand. Samples were then centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 minutes at °C to remove protein debris, and supernatants were stored at -80°C until acquisition. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was carried out using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC in line with a Bruker Impact II QTOF operating in negative ion mode, as previously described ( Edwards-Hicks et al., 2020 39. Edwards-Hicks, J. ∙ Mitterer, M. ∙ Pearce, E.L. ... Metabolic dynamics of in vitro CD8+ T cell activation Metabolites. 2020; 11 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). LC separation was performed on a Phenomenex Luna propylamine column (50 x 2 mm, 3 μm particles) using a solvent gradient of 100% buffer B (5 mM ammonium carbonate in 90% acetonitrile) to 90% buffer A (10 mM NH 4 in water). Flow rate was from 1000 to 750 μL/min. Autosampler temperature was 5°C, and injection volume was 2 μL. Metabolites were quantified using AssayR ( Wills et al., 2017 140. Wills, J. ∙ Edwards-Hicks, J. ∙ Finch, A.J. AssayR: A simple mass spectrometry software tool for targeted metabolic and stable isotope tracer analyses Anal. Chem. 2017; 89 :9616-9619 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). The hierarchical clustering heatmap was generated in MetaboAnalyst 5.0 using Euclidean distance measure, the Ward clustering algorithm, and autoscale feature standardization ( Pang et al., 2021 95. Pang, Z. ∙ Chong, J. ∙ Zhou, G. ... MetaboAnalyst 5.0: narrowing the gap between raw spectra and functional insights Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :W388-W396 Crossref Scopus (691) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Metabolic flux measurements were carried out with the Seahorse XFp Glycolytic Rate Assay and Cell Mito Stress Test kits (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On the day of the assay, 4 x 10 4 differentiated THP-1 macrophages were seeded per well of the XFp cartridge, allowed to adhere for 2 hours in a 37°C, 5% CO 2 incubator, and then incubated with assay medium (XF DMEM medium with 10 mM glucose and 2 mM glutamine but without sodium pyruvate (Agilent)) for 45 − 60 minutes in a non- CO 2 37°C incubator prior to data acquisition in a Seahorse XFp analyzer (Agilent).
Statistical analyses were performed on Prism (GraphPad) with each statistical test, definitions of center (mean or median) and dispersion (standard error of the mean), and the number of samples per group (n, referring to animals, individual cells, or pools of cells in a tissue culture well) indicated in the corresponding figure legends and panels. The unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine statistical significance between the mean values of two groups. One- or two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s or Sidak’s post tests were used to compare the mean values of three or more groups. Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze contingency table data (i.e., number of animals with mycobacterial cording vs. no cording). Statistical significance was determined by P < 0.05. Statistically significant comparisons in each figure are indicated with asterisks, ∗ P < 0.05; ∗∗ P < 0.01; ∗∗∗ P < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ P < 0.0001.
