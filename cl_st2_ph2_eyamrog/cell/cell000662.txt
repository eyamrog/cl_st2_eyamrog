Title: Distinct transcriptome architectures underlying lupus establishment and exacerbation


Abstract: Summary

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease involving multiple immune cells. To elucidate SLE pathogenesis, it is essential to understand the dysregulated gene expression pattern linked to various clinical statuses with a high cellular resolution. Here, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome study with 6,386 RNA sequencing data covering 27 immune cell types from 136 SLE and 89 healthy donors. We profiled two distinct cell-type-specific transcriptomic signatures: disease-state and disease-activity signatures, reflecting disease establishment and exacerbation, respectively. We then identified candidate biological processes unique to each signature. This study suggested the clinical value of disease-activity signatures, which were associated with organ involvement and therapeutic responses. However, disease-activity signatures were less enriched around SLE risk variants than disease-state signatures, suggesting that current genetic studies may not well capture clinically vital biology. Together, we identified comprehensive gene signatures of SLE, which will provide essential foundations for future genomic and genetic studies.

Section: Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that involves multiple immune cell types and pathways ( Tsokos et al., 2016 64. Tsokos, G.C. ∙ Lo, M.S. ∙ Costa Reis, P.C. ... New insights into the immunopathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2016; 12 :716-730 Crossref Scopus (866) PubMed Google Scholar ). SLE has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, and the disease course is generally unpredictable ( Durcan et al., 2019 17. Durcan, L. ∙ O’Dwyer, T. ∙ Petri, M. Management strategies and future directions for systemic lupus erythematosus in adults Lancet. 2019; 393 :2332-2343 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ). This heterogeneous nature has hampered a better understanding of SLE pathogenesis and the development of effective therapeutic agents ( Allen et al., 2021 1. Allen, M.E. ∙ Rus, V. ∙ Szeto, G.L.

Wallace, D.J. The evolution of drug discovery in systemic lupus erythematosus Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2015; 11 :616-620 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, only two biologics have been approved for SLE, belimumab (BLM) and anifrolumab, monoclonal antibodies against B cell-activating factor (BAFF) and type I interferon (IFN) receptor subunit 1, respectively ( Morand et al., 2020 48.

To detect biomarkers and therapeutic targets for SLE, several studies on bulk whole-blood transcriptomes have revealed some key gene signatures related to IFN signaling, granulocytes, and plasma cells ( Banchereau et al., 2016 6. Banchereau, R. ∙ Hong, S. ∙ Cantarel, B. ...

Combined genetic and transcriptome analysis of patients with SLE: distinct, targetable signatures for susceptibility and severity Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2019; 78 :1079-1089 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these results were biased by the abundance of various immune cell populations in the analyzed samples, which complicates the identification of any cell-type-specific disease-relevant signatures ( Lyons et al., 2010 43. Lyons, P.A. ∙ McKinney, E.F. ∙ Rayner, T.F. ... Novel expression signatures identified by transcriptional analysis of separated leucocyte subsets in systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2010; 69 :1208-1213 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, recent studies applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), skin, and kidney samples from SLE patients ( Arazi et al., 2019 5. Arazi, A. ∙ Rao, D.A. ∙ Berthier, C.C. ... The immune cell landscape in kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis Nat.

Mapping systemic lupus erythematosus heterogeneity at the single-cell level Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1094-1106 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). While they have successfully identified several cell clusters crucial for lupus pathogenesis, they failed to detect some established cell subpopulations, for example, T helper 1 (Th1), 17 (Th17), and neutrophils (Neu), mainly due to the sparse expression at single-cell level (around 1,000 genes per cell). Moreover, since these scRNA-seq studies of SLE were limited by small sample sizes (21–33 cases), they were not well powered to capture comprehensive transcriptome abnormality related to different clinical manifestations. These limitations could be overcome by a large-scale bulk transcriptome study of multiple established cell subpopulations with higher sensitivity for fine gene signatures linked to precise disease pathophysiology ( Combes et al., 2022 11. Combes, A.J. ∙ Samad, B. ∙ Tsui, J. ... Discovering dominant tumor immune archetypes in a pan-cancer census Cell. 2022; 185 :184-203.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ).
SLE etiology has both genetic and environmental components. Researchers have conducted large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for SLE ( Langefeld et al., 2017 38. Langefeld, C.D. ∙ Ainsworth, H.C. ∙ Cunninghame Graham, D.S.C. ... Transancestral mapping and genetic load in systemic lupus erythematosus Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :16021 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yin et al., 2021 69. Yin, X. ∙ Kim, K. ∙ Suetsugu, H. ...

Dis. 2021; 80 :632-640 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), identifying more than one hundred risk loci. Combined with omics data mostly from healthy individuals, researchers attempted to interpret the genetic etiology and have identified potential causal roles of IFN, Toll-like receptor signaling, and immune complexes ( Farh et al., 2015 19. Farh, K.K.H. ∙ Marson, A. ∙ Zhu, J. ... Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants Nature. 2015; 518 :337-343 Crossref Scopus (1349) PubMed Google Scholar ; Westra et al., 2013 68. Westra, H.J. ∙ Peters, M.J. ∙ Esko, T. ... Systematic identification of trans eQTLs as putative drivers of known disease associations Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :1238-1243 Crossref Scopus (1288) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these studies have not thoroughly investigated the complex interactions between risk variants and the transcriptome dysregulation seen in SLE patients. Such investigations hold the promise to elucidate the complex pathogenesis of SLE.
To address these issues, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome study of 6,386 bulk RNA-seq data including 27 purified immune cell types in peripheral blood that encompassed almost every type of immune cell ( Figure 1 ). We recruited 136 SLE patients with various disease activities and clinical presentations (22 among them were re-evaluated after BLM treatment; STAR Methods ) and 89 healthy volunteers in the Immune Cell Gene Expression Atlas from the University of Tokyo (ImmuNexUT) cohort ( Ota et al., 2021 52. Ota, M. ∙ Nagafuchi, Y. ∙ Hatano, H. ... Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases Cell. 2021; 184 :3006-3021.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) (discovery dataset). Using multiple approaches, we investigated cell-type-specific transcriptome dysregulation and classified them into two categories: disease-state and disease-activity signatures. Furthermore, we deployed these signatures to five main topics of downstream analyses: (1) replication, (2) biological interpretation, (3) diverse organ involvement, (4) pre- and post-treatment comparison, and (5) the SLE-GWAS signals ( Figure 1 ). Overall, our large-scale and comprehensive investigation uncovered the molecular basis underlying the clinical heterogeneity of SLE with a fine resolution of cell-type specificity.

Section: Results

Our dataset included 27 finely sorted immune cell types: CD4 T cells, nine subsets; CD8 T cells, four subsets; natural killer (NK) cells, one subset; B cells, five subsets; monocytes, four subsets; dendritic cells (DCs), two subsets; and neutrophils, two subsets ( Figure 1 , left; Tables S1 A and S1B; STAR Methods ). We recruited 248 donors in total. Among them, 136 unique SLE patients and 89 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the discovery dataset; the rest included 22 post-BLM patients ( STAR Methods ). Compared with previous scRNA-seq studies, a larger sample size with multiple clinical statuses (e.g., disease activity, organ involvement, and treatment profiles) is an advantage of our cohort ( Table S1 C). At enrollment, 30 patients (22.1%) in the discovery dataset had high disease activity (HDA; SLEDAI-2K ≥ 9), while 31 (22.8%) patients were inactive (SLEDAI-2K = 0) ( Gladman et al., 2002 24. Gladman, D.D. ∙ Ibañez, D. ∙ Urowitz, M.B. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29 :288-291 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Forty-one (30.1%), 27 (19.9%), and 30 (22.1%) patients had mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, and renal activity, respectively.
To understand the highly complex transcriptomic signatures in our datasets (16,000 genes and 6,386 samples from 248 donors; Figure S1 A; Table S1 D; STAR Methods ), we projected all samples in low dimensional spaces. Principal-component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) showed that the samples from the same cell type clustered together followed by the same cell lineage ( Figures S1 B–S1F). We confirmed that batch effects were successfully removed in all cell types ( Figures S1 G and S1H).
IFN-related gene (IRG) expression is a hallmark signature of SLE ( Crow, 2014 13. Crow, M.K. Type I interferon in the pathogenesis of lupus J. Immunol. 2014; 192 :5459-5468 Crossref Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explicitly quantify transcriptome patterns well established for lupus, we utilized 100 IRGs reported in a recent PBMC scRNA-seq study ( Nehar-Belaid et al., 2020 51. Nehar-Belaid, D. ∙ Hong, S. ∙ Marches, R. ... Mapping systemic lupus erythematosus heterogeneity at the single-cell level Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1094-1106 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found several cell-type- and disease-specific IRG expression patterns consistent with the original publication ( Figure S1 I). In addition, about half (n = 54) of IRGs showed the highest expression in SLE neutrophil-lineage cells, which were not evaluated in the previous scRNA-seq studies of SLE. As a result, hierarchical clustering using our own dataset identified new clusters ( Figures 2 A and S1 J): for example, clusters C9 and C11 characterized by the highest expression in SLE neutrophils. Together, our comprehensive transcriptomic data exhibited the expected cell-type specificity and discovered unreported IRG expression patterns.
To explore the source of the transcriptomic variations in the discovery dataset, we conducted PCA within each cell type and evaluated the distribution of samples in the PCA space ( Table S1 E). The top PCs differentiated SLE patients from HC in all cell types, indicating widespread transcriptome perturbations in SLE immune cells ( Figures 2 B and S2 A–S2D). In addition, gene expression profiles within patients showed higher variation than those within HC, reflecting the highly heterogeneous transcriptome patterns in SLE ( Figure 2 C; STAR Methods ).
We further evaluated how the transcriptome variations reflected the heterogeneous clinical statuses. Using PC1–7, the minimum set to associate the transcriptome with the clinical parameters ( Figures S2 E–S2L; STAR Methods ), we quantified the contribution of clinical parameters to the within-SLE variation by weighted variance partitioning analysis ( Figure 2 D; STAR Methods ). Importantly, this analysis revealed that disease activity had the largest contribution to the total variation within SLE in almost all cell types (7.6% on average), around 2.9-fold larger than the treatment contribution.
Motivated by the fact that both case-control differences and disease activity substantially contributed to the whole transcriptome architecture, we next deployed a supervised approach to the discovery dataset to identify two transcriptomic signatures for each cell type: (1) disease-state signature genes, defined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) between inactive SLE and HC, reflecting the biology of disease establishment and (2) disease-activity signature genes, defined as DEGs between HDA and inactive SLE, reflecting the biology of disease exacerbation ( Figures 1 , middle, 3A, S3 A, S3D, and S3E). We detected comparable numbers of DEGs between these two comparisons (on average, 2,098 disease-state and 2,114 disease-activity signature genes; Figure S3 B; Tables S2 A and S2B). We conducted replication analysis using independent cohorts ( Andreoletti et al., 2021 4. Andreoletti, G. ∙ Lanata, C.M. ∙ Trupin, L. ...

Dis. 2022; 81 :845-853 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 i) and confirmed the robustness of both signatures based on their high replicability (one-sided sign test, Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05; Figures S3 G and S3H; Table S2 C).
To examine the specificity of these signatures, we first compared them within each cell type. We calculated the Jaccard similarity index in each cell type to quantify the shared genes between signatures ( Figure 3 A); we considered that a gene was shared when it was included in both signatures with a concordant sign ( STAR Methods ). Based on the proportion of DEGs and Jaccard index, we found three different transcriptome perturbation patterns ( STAR Methods ): disease-state dominant pattern, e.g., naive CD4/8 T cells (naive CD4/8), disease-activity dominant pattern, e.g., plasmablasts, and shared pattern, e.g., neutrophil-lineage cells ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S3 B). When we evaluated the similarity based on the correlation of log fold changes (logFC) for both signatures, we observed consistent patterns ( Figure S3 C).
We next compared signature genes across different cell types and confirmed cell-type-specific and shared components. Around 20% and 30% of signature genes were detected in only one cell type and lineage, respectively ( Figure 3 C). To understand the distribution of the shared components across cell types, we calculated the Jaccard index ( Figure 3 D) and correlation ( Figure S3 F). Globally, we detected higher similarity within the same cell lineage than in different lineages in both signatures. However, we found a clear discrepancy between the signatures; high similarity among Th1 and cytotoxic lymphocytes (NK and memory CD8-lineage cells) ( Uzhachenko and Shanker, 2019 65. Uzhachenko, R.V. ∙ Shanker, A. CD8+ T lymphocyte and NK cell network: circuitry in the cytotoxic domain of immunity Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :1906 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ) was observed only in activity signatures (blue square in Figures 3 D and S3 F). These gaps indicated the presence of gene expression patterns specific to HDA patients in these cell types. Thus, our dataset captured distinct transcriptome perturbations in the disease establishment and exacerbation phases in a cell-type-specific manner.
To understand the SLE biology in disease establishment and exacerbation, we next sought to interpret disease-state and activity signature genes in each cell type using multiple external databases ( Figure 1 ii).
First, we focused on 136 genes encoding cytokines ( Table S3 A), the key regulators of immune responses and potential drug targets in autoimmune diseases ( Dean et al., 2000 14. Dean, G.S. ∙ Tyrrell-Price, J. ∙ Crawley, E. ... Cytokines and systemic lupus erythematosus Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59 :243-251 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among 51 genes upregulated in at least one signature, we identified 21 and 17 upregulated specifically in one cell lineage of disease-state and activity signatures, respectively ( Figure 4 A, top). Representative examples of activity signatures included IL12A/B (switched memory B cells [SM B]), IL1B / CCL2/CCL8 (monocyte lineage), and IL18/TNFSF15 (neutrophil lineage). Among them, IL21 and CXCL13 , critical genes to support B-cell antibody production ( Rao, 2018 56. Rao, D.A. T cells that help B cells in chronically inflamed tissues Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1924 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), are especially intriguing. Although previous studies reported T follicular helper (Tfh) cells as the major source of IL21 and CXCL13 ( Crotty, 2019 12. Crotty, S. T follicular helper cell biology: A decade of discovery and diseases Immunity. 2019; 50 :1132-1148 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (907) PubMed Google Scholar ), Th1 showed a more dynamic increase than Tfh, especially in the activity signatures ( Figure 4 A, bottom). Cell–cell communication analysis prioritized the key ligand-receptor networks that could induce the disease-state and activity signatures in each cell type ( Figure S4 A and S4B).
Next, we inferred the activities of transcription factors (TFs), essential regulators of immune function, based on the expression of TF-downstream genes ( STAR Methods ). Among 61,182 total tests (1,133 TF annotations × 27 cell types × two signatures), we observed 1,228 significant enrichments for 299 annotations (FDR < 0.05; one-sided Fisher’s exact test; Table S3 B). Disease-activity signatures showed more enrichments (862 enrichments [70.2%]; Figure 4 B, top). We here highlight two TFs as the candidate key regulators in SLE exacerbation ( Figure 4 B, middle). First, cell cycle regulators including E2F families showed strong enrichment in activity signatures of Th1, NK, memory CD8-lineage cells, and plasmablasts. Upregulated cell cycle regulation might be driving the high similarities among these cell types in disease-activity signatures ( Figure 3 D, right). Second, BACH2 showed significant enrichment in disease-activity signatures for monocyte- and neutrophil-lineage cells. Intriguingly, BACH2 also showed strong enrichment in lymphocytes, consistent with previous studies ( Kometani et al., 2013 36. Kometani, K. ∙ Nakagawa, R. ∙ Shinnakasu, R. ... Repression of the transcription factor Bach2 contributes to predisposition of IgG1 memory B cells toward plasma cell differentiation Immunity. 2013; 39 :136-147 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sidwell et al., 2020 60. Sidwell, T. ∙ Liao, Y. ∙ Garnham, A.L. ... Attenuation of TCR-induced transcription by Bach2 controls regulatory T cell differentiation and homeostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :252 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) but primarily in disease-state signatures. These results demonstrated that an identical gene regulatory machinery can exert a pathogenic effect in different cell types depending on the disease phases ( Figure 4 B, bottom).
Finally, we performed pathway enrichment analyses to examine multiple biological processes underlying lupus pathogenesis ( STAR Methods ). Among 32,292 total tests for 598 pathways, we observed 735 and 315 significant enrichments for disease state and disease activity, respectively (FDR < 0.05; one-sided Fisher’s exact test; Figure S4 C; Tables S3 C and S3D). We confirmed the enrichments of established hallmark pathways for SLE ( Figure S4 D). In addition, we found different enrichment patterns between the signatures in metabolism- and cellular process-related pathways ( Figure 4 C, left and S4 E; STAR Methods ). Oxidative phosphorylation signaling was enriched mostly in disease-state signatures (e.g., B-lineage cells), whereas citrate cycle signaling showed enrichment in activity signatures (e.g., memory CD8-lineage cells; Figure 4 C, right). Ribosome and cell cycle pathways (e.g., Th1, NK, and memory CD8-lineage cells) were enriched predominantly in disease-activity signatures. Our cell-type-specific analysis successfully clarified the cell-type origin of these pathways and highlighted the importance of previously underappreciated molecular pathways such as immunometabolism, describing disease establishment and exacerbation phases separately.
To resolve the complex relationships between transcriptome dysregulation and clinical heterogeneity in SLE, we leveraged a PC-based unsupervised approach ( Figure 1 iii). In the hierarchical clustering of 225 unique individuals using all 189 PCs (=7 PCs × 27 cell types), HC was clearly separated from patients; in addition, HDA patients with multiple organ complications were clustered together ( Figures 5 A and S5 A).
Compared with the approach using thousands of signature genes, the PC-based approach is better at representing whole transcriptome architecture with a small number of parameters. To understand the biological significance of each PC, we defined two categories of PCs as in the discussion of signature genes: (1) disease-state PCs, separating inactive SLE and HC and (2) disease-activity PCs, separating HDA and inactive SLE (FDR < 0.05; Figure 5 B; Table S4 A; STAR Methods ). Among 189 PCs, we identified 37 disease-state PCs and 25 disease-activity PCs; among them, nine PCs were classified into both ( Figure S5 B). When we projected the data from external cohorts onto our PCA space, PC scores maintained the original contrasts, confirming the good replicability of both PC signatures (one-sided sign test, p < 0.05; Figure S5 C; Table S4 B). This PC-based approach successfully captured the continuous nature of SLE biology; most disease-activity PCs showed a gradual increase in the association signals along with the extent of disease activity ( Figures 5 B and S5 B).
To evaluate cell-type-specific contributions to organ involvement, we assessed the variance proportion of cell-type-specific PCs explained by clinical parameters (weighted variance partitioning analysis; STAR Methods ). Overall disease activity, a composite measure reflecting the status of all organs, significantly contributed to the within-SLE transcriptome variation especially in the 13 cell types including Th1, plasmablasts, and monocyte- and neutrophil-lineage cells (Bonferroni-corrected jackknife resampling p [p jk ] < 0.05; Figures 2 D and 5 C, left; STAR Methods ). We then decomposed the overall activity into seven organ/domain categories ( Isenberg et al., 2005 30. Isenberg, D.A. ∙ Rahman, A. ∙ Allen, E. ... BILAG 2004. Development and initial validation of an updated version of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group’s disease activity index for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatology. 2005; 44 :902-906 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ): constitutional, mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, renal, extrarenal severe, hematological, and serological activities. Interestingly, each organ/domain showed cell-type-specific patterns ( Figures 5 C, right and S5 D–S5H; Tables S4 C and S4D; STAR Methods ). While Th1 showed the highest explained variance for mucocutaneous activity, the contribution of monocyte-lineage cells was predominant for musculoskeletal activity ( Figure 5 C, right). Furthermore, neutrophil-lineage cells exhibited the largest contribution to renal involvement, followed by monocyte-lineage cells, Th1, and plasmablasts.
To supplement the variance partitioning analysis based on multiple PCs, we also evaluated the specific relationship of each disease-activity PC with organ involvement ( Figure 5 D; Table S4 A). This analysis highlighted the contribution of (1) Neu and nonclassical monocyte (NC Mono) to renal and (2) naive CD4 and double-negative B cells (DN B) to musculoskeletal involvement (linear regression test; FDR < 0.05). Together, our results confirmed the critical roles of granulocytes and macrophages for the development of lupus nephritis ( Gupta and Kaplan, 2016 26. Gupta, S. ∙ Kaplan, M.J. The role of neutrophils and NETosis in autoimmune and renal diseases Nat. Rev. Nephrol. 2016; 12 :402-413 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuriakose et al., 2019 37. Kuriakose, J. ∙ Redecke, V. ∙ Guy, C. ... Patrolling monocytes promote the pathogenesis of early lupus-like glomerulonephritis J. Clin. Invest. 2019; 129 :2251-2265 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ) and suggested other potential cell-type-specific contribution to organ involvement, which may be informative in unraveling SLE clinical heterogeneity.
BLM is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits BAFF, a vital factor for B-cell survival and differentiation ( Vincent et al., 2014 66. Vincent, F.B. ∙ Morand, E.F. ∙ Schneider, P. ... The BAFF/APRIL system in SLE pathogenesis Nat. Rev. Rheumatol. 2014; 10 :365-373 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated the effect of BLM on the transcriptome in each cell type ( Figure 1 iv). Our cohort has longitudinal data before and 6 months after BLM induction on 22 individuals; we refer to them as pre- and post-BLM. Importantly, none of the post-BLM samples were included in the discovery dataset; therefore, the comparison between pre- and post-BLM is independent of the disease-activity signatures calculated in the discovery dataset. We observed DEGs between pre- and post-BLM (BLM-DEGs) predominantly in B-lineage cells, confirming the cell-type-specific effects of BLM ( Figure 6 A). When we categorized the patients into good and poor responders to BLM (n = 9 and 13, respectively; STAR Methods ), more DEGs were observed in good than in poor responders ( Figures 6 B and S6 C; Tables S5 A and S5B). The IFNγ-related, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)-related, and glycolysis-related pathways were enriched in B-cell DEGs of good responders (FDR < 0.05, one-sided Fisher’s exact test; Figure 6 C; Table S5 C), consistent with the downstream signaling of BAFF receptors in B cells ( McAllister and Jellusova, 2021 46. McAllister, E. ∙ Jellusova, J. BAFF signaling in B cell metabolism Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2021; 71 :69-74 https://doi.org/https Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun, 2017 62. Sun, S.C. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway in immunity and inflammation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :545-558 Crossref Scopus (1205) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next asked whether BLM effects on transcriptomes counteract disease-activity signatures. We first calculated the Jaccard similarity index to quantify the shared genes between BLM-DEGs and disease-activity signatures; we considered a gene is shared when the BLM effect had the opposite sign to the activity signature to reflect therapeutic responses ( STAR Methods ). Jaccard indexes in good responders were around 3.4-fold higher than those in poor responders in B-lineage cells ( Figure 6 B). The analyses based on logFC also showed similar trends ( Figures S6 A and S6B). By projecting post-BLM data onto the PCA space of the discovery cohort ( STAR Methods ), we evaluated the change in disease-activity PC scores between pre- and post-BLM. Consistent with the DEG analysis, we found a significant decrease in unswitched memory B cells (USM B) PC4 scores only for good responders (linear mixed regression test, FDR = 9.9 × 10 −3 ; Figure 6 D). Together, these results provided robust evidence supporting the association between disease-activity signatures and the therapeutic response to BLM.
Next, we assessed the effect of other therapeutic agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on disease-activity signatures ( Figures 6 E and S6 E; Table S5 D). Importantly, we treated disease activity as a potential confounder in this analysis ( STAR Methods ); hence, the MMF effects are not biased by disease activity. DEGs between patients with and without MMF (MMF-DEGs) were primarily observed in plasmablasts, followed by Th1 and central memory CD8 T cells (CM CD8) ( Figure 6 E); the same cell types were nominated by variance partitioning analysis ( Figure S6 F; Table S4 C). MMF-DEGs were shared with the activity signature genes with 15.0%–21.7% of the Jaccard index ( Figure 6 E). Pathway analysis recapitulated this shared component: both genes showed enrichment for oxidative phosphorylation and E2F-related cell cycle pathways ( Figure S6 D; Table S5 E). We also found a significant decrease in disease-activity PC scores of plasmablasts (PC1) in patients taking MMF, adjusted for disease activity (linear regression test, FDR = 6.3 × 10 −3 ; Figure 6 F; STAR Methods ). These results were consistent with previous reports that MMF suppressed plasma cell differentiation ( Jonsson and Carlsten, 2003 32. Jonsson, C.A. ∙ Carlsten, H. Mycophenolic acid inhibits inosine 5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase and suppresses immunoglobulin and cytokine production of B cells Int. Immunopharmacol. 2003; 3 :31-37 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To estimate the causal roles of these signatures for the risk of disease onset, we integrated our transcriptome data with the results of GWASs for SLE (SLE-GWASs; Figure 1 v).
First, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of all risk variants irrespective of their effect sizes and tested their enrichment around the signature genes using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (S-LDSC) ( Finucane et al., 2015 20. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Gusev, A. ... Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1228-1235 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 21. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Reshef, Y.A. ∙ Anttila, V. ... Heritability enrichment of specifically expressed genes identifies disease-relevant tissues and cell types Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :621-629 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ; STAR Methods ). To be in line with previous studies of S-LDSC, we additionally took a conventional approach and analyzed the enrichment of specifically expressed genes (SEGs) in each cell type derived from HC (HC-SEG; STAR Methods ). Since ancestry-specific GWAS results are required in S-LDSC, we used two large-scale SLE-GWASs conducted in East Asian (EAS) ( Yin et al., 2021 69. Yin, X. ∙ Kim, K. ∙ Suetsugu, H. ... Meta-analysis of 208370 East Asians identifies 113 susceptibility loci for systemic lupus erythematosus Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2021; 80 :632-640 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ) and European (EUR) populations ( Langefeld et al., 2017 38. Langefeld, C.D. ∙ Ainsworth, H.C. ∙ Cunninghame Graham, D.S.C. ... Transancestral mapping and genetic load in systemic lupus erythematosus Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :16021 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that the S-LDSC results for EAS- and EUR-GWASs were globally similar as reported for other traits ( Amariuta et al., 2020 2. Amariuta, T. ∙ Ishigaki, K. ∙ Sugishita, H. ... Improving the trans-ancestry portability of polygenic risk scores by prioritizing variants in predicted cell-type-specific regulatory elements Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :1346-1354 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ) (r in enrichment estimate = 0.69; p = 1.5 × 10 −12 ; Figure S7 A; Table S6 A); hence, we combined them using a fixed-effect meta-analysis. For HC-SEG, there was no significant enrichment at Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05 (minimum nominal p = 0.028 for SM B; Figure 7 A). Strikingly, compared with HC-SEG, we found much stronger enrichments for disease-state signatures in all cell types: nine significant enrichments. However, for disease-activity signatures, we found no significant enrichment. Consistently, the enrichments were substantially weaker in the activity signatures than in the disease-state signatures (paired Wilcoxon test, p = 5.5 × 10 −6 ).
We next analyzed prioritized causal genes implicated in SLE-GWASs ( Table S6 B; STAR Methods ) and tested their enrichment in both signatures of each cell type ( Figures 7 B and S7 B; Table S6 C). As in the S-LDSC results, the enrichments of the GWAS-prioritized genes were predominantly observed in disease-state rather than in activity signatures; significant enrichments were found in three and zero cell types, respectively (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05). Again, the enrichments were weaker in activity signatures than in disease-state signatures (paired Wilcoxon test, p = 2.6 × 10 −5 ). These results confirmed that the risk variants locate on average around disease-state and not around disease-activity signature genes.
Considering that most of the risk variants are within the gene regulatory regions ( Farh et al., 2015 19. Farh, K.K.H. ∙ Marson, A. ∙ Zhu, J. ... Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal autoimmune disease variants Nature. 2015; 518 :337-343 Crossref Scopus (1349) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that risk variants possess gene regulatory effects on disease-state genes (i.e., expression quantitative trait loci [eQTL] effects; Figure 7 C). To test this hypothesis, we next evaluated the potential eQTL effects of the risk variants on disease-state and activity signature genes. Specifically, we focused on genes affected by the risk variants’ eQTL effects (eGenes) and asked how the risk alleles’ directional effects on eGenes are consistent with our gene expression signatures; an eGene with consistent direction is called a “coherent gene” ( Marigorta et al., 2017 45. Marigorta, U.M. ∙ Denson, L.A. ∙ Hyams, J.S. ... Transcriptional risk scores link GWAS to eQTLs and predict complications in Crohn’s disease Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1517-1521 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 D; for this analysis, we utilized our recent colocalization test results between SLE-GWAS and eQTL variants [416 donors]) ( Ota et al., 2021 52. Ota, M. ∙ Nagafuchi, Y. ∙ Hatano, H. ... Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases Cell. 2021; 184 :3006-3021.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, the coherent genes were enriched in disease-state signatures but not in activity signatures ( Figure 7 E; Table S6 D): 67% of eGene-cell type combinations were coherent in disease-state signatures, whereas only 25% of combinations were coherent in activity signatures (one-sided sign test, p = 0.022 and 0.99, respectively). Together, these analyses demonstrated better directional compatibility of the SLE risk allele’s effect with disease-state signatures rather than activity signatures. Although this might be reasonable considering that most GWASs are based on case-control design, this finding implied the failure of current GWASs to capture the critical biology of SLE represented by disease-activity signatures.
While activity signature genes did not locate around the current SLE risk variants, we speculated that some of them might contribute to the disease risk by modulating the eQTL effects of risk alleles; we refer to the genes with modulating eQTL effects as proxy genes (prGenes; Figure 7 C; STAR Methods ; Zhernakova et al., 2017 71. Zhernakova, D.V. ∙ Deelen, P. ∙ Vermaat, M. ... Identification of context-dependent expression quantitative trait loci in whole blood Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :139-145 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we finally sought to test whether disease-activity signature genes act as prGenes for risk alleles. In 115 SLE patients with genotype data available, we examined the influence of disease-activity signatures genes on the eQTL effects of risk alleles (we again utilized the above-mentioned colocalization results). Intriguingly, we detected two significant prGenes among activity signature genes (analysis of variance [ANOVA] test, FDR < 0.05; Table S6 E), which included MED24 , a transcriptional coactivator. MED24 is an activity signature gene of plasmablasts ( Figure 7 F, left), and its expression was suppressed by MMF ( Figure S7 C). MED24 significantly modulated the eQTL effect of an SLE risk variant (rs36059542) on ARHGAP31 , encoding a GTPase-activating protein (ANOVA test, FDR = 0.035; Figure 7 F, right). Of note, the eQTL effect of rs36059542 on ARHGAP31 was observed only in plasmablasts ( Ota et al., 2021 52. Ota, M. ∙ Nagafuchi, Y. ∙ Hatano, H. ... Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases Cell. 2021; 184 :3006-3021.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, in addition to disease-state genes, disease-activity genes may also contribute to genetic risk by modulating the eQTL effects of risk alleles. Furthermore, MMF might indirectly suppress SLE genetic risk by controlling the MED24 expression.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we extensively examined dysregulated gene expression patterns of SLE by profiling 27 immune cell types from 136 SLE and 89 HC donors. The strategy we took in this bulk transcriptome study with a high cellular resolution aimed to achieve the better quality to capture the precise biology linked to a wide variety of patient conditions in this disease. In this approach, we successfully profiled two distinct categories of lupus-relevant signatures, that is, disease-state and disease-activity genes, and revealed the underappreciated cell-type-specific mechanisms driving these signatures, most of which were not identified in previous scRNA-seq studies ( Arazi et al., 2019 5. Arazi, A. ∙ Rao, D.A. ∙ Berthier, C.C. ... The immune cell landscape in kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :902-914 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ; Der et al., 2019 15. Der, E. ∙ Suryawanshi, H. ∙ Morozov, P. ... Tubular cell and keratinocyte single-cell transcriptomics applied to lupus nephritis reveal type I IFN and fibrosis relevant pathways Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :915-927 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nehar-Belaid et al., 2020 51. Nehar-Belaid, D. ∙ Hong, S. ∙ Marches, R. ... Mapping systemic lupus erythematosus heterogeneity at the single-cell level Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1094-1106 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we demonstrated the value of these signatures in multiple applications: transferability to independent transcriptome datasets, shared components with drug responses, and consistency with the genetic signals.
SLE is a chronic disease characterized by relapsing and remitting disease course. A critical but unsolved question is how the multicellular pathophysiology is different (or not different) between disease development and exacerbation stages. Most of the previous SLE transcriptome studies have failed to provide clear answers since they separately conducted case-control and/or intra-case analyses and have not directly compared both signatures in the same study with a high cellular resolution. Our comprehensive transcriptome data successfully clarified the multiple cell-type-specific immune-mediated molecular mechanism characteristic of disease-state and activity, which highlighted the distinct biology behind the establishment and exacerbation phases of this disease.
The current realistic goal of SLE management is to achieve remission or low disease activity (LDA), not a cure ( Fanouriakis et al., 2019 18. Fanouriakis, A. ∙ Kostopoulou, M. ∙ Alunno, A. ... 2019 Update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2019; 78 :736-745 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar ; Franklyn et al., 2016 22. Franklyn, K. ∙ Lau, C.S. ∙ Navarra, S.V. ... Definition and initial validation of a Lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS) Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2016; 75 :1615-1621 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ). From this perspective, the disease-activity signature, not the disease-state signature, has implications for the development of biomarkers of treatment response or therapeutic targets. Indeed, we observed shared components between the disease-activity signatures and transcriptome changes in BLM good responders and in those taking MMF. The cell-type-specific activity signatures identified in this study, for example, myeloid-lineage cells characteristic of renal disease, might be informative for designing novel treatment strategies for SLE.
We have provided in-depth integrative analyses of the risk variants and transcriptome signatures; these results have several important implications. First, since we recruited established SLE patients in the chronic phase, whether the disease-state signature genes indicate causality (the signatures induce disease state) or a reverse causality (the disease state induces the signatures) is a critical question. Since the risk variants reflect the causality, the fact that the risk variants are enriched around disease-state signature genes suggested the former scenario, further supported by the consistency in the dysregulation direction (i.e., coherent genes). Moreover, this finding also suggested that genetic risk-driven susceptibility signatures remained in clinically stable SLE patients, indicating that the causal mechanism is not completely controlled by the current treatments. Second, the current case-control GWAS signals failed to reflect the disease-activity signatures. This is a critical limitation of the current genetic studies considering the potential importance of activity signatures in drug target discovery. Although polygenic risk score based on such GWASs predicted poorer outcomes to some extent ( Reid et al., 2020 57. Reid, S. ∙ Alexsson, A. ∙ Frodlund, M. ... High genetic risk score is associated with early disease onset, damage accrual and decreased survival in systemic lupus erythematosus Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2020; 79 :363-369 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), a new framework of genetic study directly focusing on intra-case heterogeneity (e.g., disease severity) will be required.
It is now clear that disease-state and disease-activity signatures jointly maintain the complex pathophysiology of SLE. These signatures have the potential to be a pivotal foundation for future genomic, genetic, and drug discovery studies.
There are several limitations in our study. First, apart from the pre- and post-BLM subcohort, our study lacked longitudinal data. Second, all participants in this study were from the EAS population although we demonstrated the applicability of our signatures to transcriptome and GWAS data from multiple ancestries. Third, our cell-sorting strategy might have failed to characterize currently unidentified cell populations.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the University of Tokyo. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. We have complied with all of the relevant ethical regulations. Age and sex of all participants are deposited in NBDC with the same accession number as denoted above. Information related to the subjects are described in Method details .
This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the University of Tokyo (G10095). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Healthy volunteers were recruited at the Department of Allergy and Rheumatology at the University of Tokyo Hospital. SLE patients were recruited at the Department of Allergy and Rheumatology at the University of Tokyo Hospital, Division of Rheumatic Diseases at National Center for Global Health and Medicine, or Immuno-Rheumatology Center at St. Luke’s International Hospital. All participants were from the EAS ancestry.
All SLE patients met the 1997 revised version of the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria ( Hochberg, 1997 28. Hochberg, M.C. Updating the American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40 :1725 Crossref Scopus (9800) PubMed Google Scholar ). The exclusion criteria for the discovery dataset (including 136 SLE patients) were: i) active malignancies or infections, ii) use of more than 20mg prednisolone (PSL) daily or equivalent at enrollment, iii) receive of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, or BLM within 12 months before enrollment.
In addition, we also collected 22 paired samples just before and six months after the additional therapy of BLM (i.e., pre- and post-BLM). Among the pre-BLM samples, 21 samples were included in the discovery dataset, and one was re-sampled due to the interval between initial enrollment and BLM induction. None of the post-BLM samples were included in the discovery dataset. Therefore, we recruited 248 donors in total: 136 unique SLE patients, one pre-BLM, 22 post-BLM patients, and 89 healthy volunteers.
In this study, all samples were collected based on phase 2 protocol in the ImmuNexUT ( Ota et al., 2021 52. Ota, M. ∙ Nagafuchi, Y. ∙ Hatano, H. ... Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases Cell. 2021; 184 :3006-3021.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ); 27 immune cell types were purified from peripheral blood of each donor ( Table S1 A) and then each sample was subject to RNA-seq. We first isolated PBMCs by density gradient separation with Ficoll-Paque (GE healthcare) immediately after the blood draw. Erythrocytes were lysed with Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium lysing buffer (Gibco), and non-specific binding was blocked with anti-human Fc-gamma receptor antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We next sorted PBMCs into 26 immune cell types with purity > 99% using a 14-color cell sorter BD FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences) with the aim of 5,000 cells per cell type per individual ( Table S1 A). All flow cytometry reagents were listed in Table S1 B. Our immune cell gating strategy for flow cytometry is based on the latest knowledge of the established cell subsets in each cell lineage ( Table S1 A). Sorted cells were lysed and stored at -80 ° C . Then, RNA for each sorted sample was extracted using MagMAX-96 Total RNA Isolation Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Libraries for RNA-seq were prepared using SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara Bio). Neutrophils were purified using MACSxpress Neutrophil Isolation Kits human (Miltenyi Biotec) with the aim of 1×10 6 cells immediately after the blood draw, lysed and stored at -80 ° C , followed by RNA isolation with an RNeasy Mini Kits (QIAGEN) and library preparation with SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kits (Takara Bio). All prepared libraries were sequenced on HiSeq2500 (6169 samples) or NovaSeq6000 (217 samples) (Illumina) to generate 100 or 150 base paired-end reads, respectively. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using QIAmp DNA Blood Midi kit (QIAGEN). Libraries were prepared using TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library prep kit (Illumina), followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS was performed only for the samples from Japanese individuals. The details of WGS data processing were reported in our previous study ( Ota et al., 2021 52. Ota, M. ∙ Nagafuchi, Y. ∙ Hatano, H. ... Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases Cell. 2021; 184 :3006-3021.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Adaptor sequences were trimmed using Cutadapt (v1.16) with default parameters and reads containing low-quality bases (Phred quality score < 20 in > 20% of the bases) were removed. Reads were aligned against the GRCh38 reference sequence using STAR (v2.5.3) ( Dobin et al., 2013 16. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27081) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the UCSC (provided in the iGenomes UCSC hg38 bundle; https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome.html ). In STAR, we set the parameters as follows to improve the accuracy to identify splicing junctions: “--alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --sjdbScore 3 --scoreGap -2”. Expression was counted with HTSeq (v0.11.2) ( Anders et al., 2015 3. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq-A Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13514) PubMed Google Scholar ), adjusting the parameters to unstranded libraries as follows: “--stranded=no”.
We applied multiple sample quality control (QC) steps to ensure high quality data. For QC and quantification, we used RNA-SeQC (v2.4.2) with default parameters ( Graubert et al., 2021 25. Graubert, A. ∙ Aguet, F. ∙ Ravi, A. ... RNA-SeQC 2: efficient RNA-seq quality control and quantification for large cohorts Bioinformatics. 2021; 37 :3048-3050 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). From 6,413 sorted samples, one sample with uniquely mapped read rates < 80% or unique read counts < 5 × 10 6 were excluded as a low-quality sample ( Table S1 D). To identify outlier samples, we calculated Spearman’s correlations of the expressions between two samples from the same cell type and then removed 21 samples with mean correlation coefficient < 0.9. In addition, to identify potentially swapped samples, we calculated the concordance rates between RNA-seq-based genotype and WGS-based genotype at the heterozygous loci and excluded five samples with concordance rate < 0.9.
We then filtered out low expression genes (<10 counts or <1 count per million [CPM] in > 85% of samples), followed by a trimmed mean of M values (TMM) normalization with R (v4.0.2) package edgeR (v3.32.1) ( Robinson et al., 2010 58. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: A Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26732) PubMed Google Scholar ) in each cell type. Normalized expression data were converted to log-transformed count per million (i.e., log[CPM+1]). The batch effects (i.e., product lots in SMART-seq v4 and sequencer; Figure S1 G) were removed using Combat software ( Johnson et al., 2007 31. Johnson, W.E. ∙ Li, C. ∙ Rabinovic, A. Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes methods Biostatistics. 2007; 8 :118-127 Crossref Scopus (5027) PubMed Google Scholar ). To verify the successful work of the batch correction procedure, we used principal variance component analysis; we first calculated the explained variance of each clinical parameter for each PC1-7 score with the linear mixed models in R package lme4 (v1.1-27.1) ( Bates et al., 2015 7. Bates, D. ∙ Mächler, M. ∙ Bolker, B.M. ... Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 J. Stat. Softw. 2015; 67 :1-48 Crossref Scopus (53152) Google Scholar ) and then inferred the average value of the explained variance weighted by each PC’s eigenvalue ( Figure S1 H).
For PCA and UMAP using all ImmuNexUT samples ( Figures S1 C and S1D), we combined the expression data after batch correction from each cell type and used the intersection of the genes (n=8,397) that passed the filtering of low expression in each cell type. We performed PCA using prcomp function in R (v4.0.2) after we centered and scaled the normalized expressions (i.e., log[CPM+1]) of these 8,397 genes. For UMAP, we used R package uwot (v 0.1.10) with default parameters ( McInnes et al., 2018 47. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Saul, N. ... UMAP: uniform manifold approximation and projection J. Open Source Softw. 2018; 3 :861 Crossref Google Scholar ).
For PCA in each cell type of the discovery cohort, we used the top 10,000 variable genes from the expression data after batch correction in each cell type ( Figures 2 B and S2 A). For each cell type, we performed PCA using prcomp function in R after we centered and scaled the normalized expressions (i.e., log[CPM+1]) of the 10,000 genes.
We evaluated the expression of 100 IRGs reported in a recent PBMC scRNA-seq study ( Nehar-Belaid et al., 2020 51. Nehar-Belaid, D. ∙ Hong, S. ∙ Marches, R. ... Mapping systemic lupus erythematosus heterogeneity at the single-cell level Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1094-1106 Crossref Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) across all 27 cell types and case-control. To recapitulate cell-type- and disease-specific IRG expression patterns described in the original publication, we first showed the expression levels of IRGs with the identical gene orders with the original publication ( Figure S1 I). Expression levels are scaled for each gene across all cell types. Cell types are arranged consistently with the original publication where applicable. Next, to discover novel cell-type-specific IRG expression patterns specific to the ImmuNexUT including neutrophil-lineage cells, we performed hierarchical clustering of IRGs and cell types based on the IRG expressions ( Figure 2 A). For the hierarchical clustering, Euclidean distances of the scaled expression levels were used with Ward’s method and the cutoff for cluster tree of IRGs was set as Euclidean distances = 12.
To evaluate how the transcriptome variation reflected the heterogeneous clinical statuses in the discovery dataset, we tested their associations with the PC scores for each cell type. This study focused on 14 clinical parameters related to disease-state, overall disease-activity, organ/domain activity, and treatment statuses ( Figure S2 E). Disease-state was defined as the contrast between inactive SLE (i.e., not all SLE) and HC in the discovery dataset to exclude the elements of disease-activity signatures from the case-control contrast ( Figure 1 , middle). For overall disease activity, we defined four categories: i) inactive as SLEDAI-2K ( Gladman et al., 2002 24. Gladman, D.D. ∙ Ibañez, D. ∙ Urowitz, M.B. Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index 2000 J. Rheumatol. 2002; 29 :288-291 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) = 0, ii) low disease activity (LDA) as 1 ≤ SLEDAI-2K ≤ 4, iii) moderate disease activity (MDA) as 5 ≤ SLEDAI-2K ≤ 8, and iv) high disease activity (HDA) as SLEDAI-2K ≥ 9. For organ activity, we categorized the patients into seven groups based on their actively involved organ/domains of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 ( Isenberg et al., 2005 30. Isenberg, D.A. ∙ Rahman, A. ∙ Allen, E. ... BILAG 2004. Development and initial validation of an updated version of the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group’s disease activity index for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatology. 2005; 44 :902-906 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ) and SELDAI-2K: a) constitutional, b) mucocutaneous, c) musculoskeletal, d) renal, e) extrarenal severe (neuropsychiatric/eye, cardiorespiratory and/or gastrointestinal), f) hematological, and g) serological activities. We also evaluated the effect of therapeutic agents such as MMF, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and tacrolimus (TAC) ( Durcan et al., 2019 17. Durcan, L. ∙ O’Dwyer, T. ∙ Petri, M.

Since cumulative explained variance reached 50-60% until PC30 in all cell types, we tested the associations of the 14 clinical parameters and PC1-30 scores from each cell type using a linear regression model, adjusted for potential confounding factors (e.g., age, sex and treatments). We fitted the PC scores to the following linear regression models:
For disease-state ( 𝑥 : inactive SLE vs. HC), 𝑦 = 𝛽 · 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜀 · 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ] + 𝜖 · 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 (Equation 1)
Here, 𝑦 represents the scaled PC score for each cell type (PC1-30 × 27 cell types). All PC scores were scaled across samples to enable the direct comparison of the effect sizes in the associations with clinical parameters. In this comparison, age and sex were included as covariates.
For disease-activity ( 𝑥 : HDA vs. inactive SLE; we also examined LDA vs. inactive and MDA vs. inactive SLE), 𝑦 = 𝛽 · 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + ∑ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 𝛾 · 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛿 · 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁡ [ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 ] + 𝜀 · 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ] + 𝜖 · 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 (Equation 2)
Here, 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ ( 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) represents each immunosuppressant (MMF, HCQ, TAC) as covariates.
For organ/domain activity ( 𝑥 𝑗 ⁡ [ 𝑗 = 1 … 7 ] : the abovementioned seven categories), 𝑦 = ∑ 𝑗 = 1 … 7 𝛽 · 𝑥 𝑗 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + ∑ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 𝛾 · 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛿 · 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁡ [ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 ] + 𝜀 · 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ] + 𝜖 · 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 (Equation 3)
Here, we constructed multiple linear regression models including all seven categories, which enabled us to infer the association of each organ activity with PC scores, controlling the other organs’ effects ( Figures 5 C and 5D).
For therapeutic agents ( 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ [ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ] : MMF, HCQ, TAC), 𝑦 = ∑ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 𝛾 · 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛽 · 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ] + 𝛿 · 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁡ [ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 ] + 𝜀 · 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ] + 𝜖 · 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 (Equation 4)
Here, 𝑥 represents disease activity (inactive, LDA, MDA, and HDA) as covariates.
These equations enabled us to derive the associations of disease-state, activity, organ involvements or treatment statuses with PC scores, adjusted for other confounding factors. Statistical significance was set at FDR < 0.05 with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. All PC scores were signed so that the effect sizes of disease-state and disease-activity were positive ( Figures 5 A, 5B, S5 A, and S5B). In the case of some PCs that had opposite sign in the effect sizes of disease-state and activity, the association with lower P value was prioritized to have positive effect size.
In total, 105 significant associations were identified ( Table S4 A). Most of the significant associations were detected within PC1-7, with larger numbers than average per PCs ( Figure S2 F). As a side note, we also observed that PC1-7 from each cell type (single-cell-type-PC) could efficiently capture the independent association signals rather than the PC scores using all sample across different cell types (all-cell-type-PCA) ( Figure S2 K). Therefore, we confirmed that PC1-7 from each cell type is a minimum set to associate the transcriptome with the clinical parameters in the discovery dataset ( Figures S2 G and S5 A) and utilized PC1-7 scores for the subsequent analyses.
To calculate the proportion of sum squared deviations within HC, SLE, and between HC and SLE data in each cell type ( Figure 2 C), we used the PC1-7 data of the discovery dataset. We first calculated the proportion of sum squared deviations for each PC score and then inferred the average value of the proportion weighted by each PC’s eigenvalue.
In the hierarchical clustering of 225 unique individuals using 189 PCs (= 7 PCs × 27 cell types) in the discovery dataset, the Euclidean distances of the PC scores were used with Ward’s method ( Figures 5 A and S5 A).
To calculate the explained variance of each factor for whole transcriptome variation, we fitted the each PC score to the linear mixed models in R package variancePartition (v1.20.0) ( Hoffman and Schadt, 2016 29. Hoffman, G.E. ∙ Schadt, E.E. variancePartition: interpreting drivers of variation in complex gene expression studies BMC Bioinformatics. 2016; 17 :483 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then inferred the average value of the explained variance weighted by each PC’s eigenvalue for each cell type.
To calculate the explained variance of cell types and case-control status in all RNA-seq samples across cell types, we used all-cell-type PC1-2 data ( Figures S1 B, S1C, S1E, and S1F). To calculate the explained variance of case-control status for each cell type, we used each-cell-type PC1-2 data ( Figures S2 A–S2D). To calculate the explained variance of each clinical parameter within SLE transcriptome data for each cell type, we used each-cell-type PC1-7 data of the discovery and external datasets ( STAR Methods ; the association of PCs with disease status ; Figures 2 D, 5 C, S2 L, S5 E, S5H, and S6 F).
For intra-SLE analyses in the discovery dataset, to verify whether the inferred explained variance was not biased by outlier samples, we estimated standard errors (S.E.) of the explained variance by jackknife resampling method ( Figures 5 C, S5 E, and S6 F). When we had n samples for one cell type, we re-calculated the explained variance n times by excluding each one of the samples. We then evaluated the distribution of n explained variance and quantified its S.E. For each clinical parameter, we compared the explained variance in each cell type against the median explained variance across all 27 cell types. To assess the significance of the difference observed in this comparison for a cell type, we utilized n explained variance calculated in jackknife resampling for that cell type; among n values, we calculated the proportion of the values which was smaller than the median value, and we defined this proportion as jackknife resampling P ( P jk ). For each clinical parameter, if one cell type passed the Bonferroni-corrected P jk < 0.05, we concluded that the clinical parameter significantly contributed to the within-SLE transcriptome variation in that cell type.
To detect DEGs in each cell type, we fitted the TMM-normalized counts in the discovery dataset to the generalized linear models (GLM) with negative binomial distribution using edgeR (v3.32.1) ( Robinson et al., 2010 58. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: A Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26732) PubMed Google Scholar ). The equations in these GLM models were consistent with those in the linear models as described in the STAR Methods ; the association of PCs with disease status ; we utilized the Equations 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 . Additionally, we also considered the batch effects as covariates in this analysis since TMM-normalized counts were not corrected for batch effects ( STAR Methods ; QC of the expression data ). These equations enabled us to derive DEGs related to our focused disease traits or treatment statuses, adjusted for other confounding factors ( Figures 3 A, 3B, 6 E, S5 F, and S6 E). Statistical significance was set at FDR < 0.05 with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. We defined (1) “disease-state signature genes” as significant DEGs between inactive SLE and HC, and (2) “disease-activity signature genes” as significant DEGs between HDA and inactive SLE for each cell type ( Figure 3 A).
To evaluate the similarities and differences between disease-state and activity signature genes, we calculated Jaccard similarity indexes as the ratio of the shared genes with the concordant sign between the disease-state and activity signatures ( Figure 3 A; orange dots) over the union of these two signature genes ( Figure 3 A; orange + red + blue dots) for each cell type. Considering the biological significance, we did not regard the DEGs with the discordant sign between these two signatures as shared genes. Based on the proportion of DEGs and Jaccard index, we classified 27 cell types into three patterns ( Figure 3 B). We first defined the cell types with Jaccard index > 0.15 as shared pattern and then classified the other cell types into disease-state or disease-activity dominant patterns based on which signature genes were numerically predominant.
To estimate the false positive rates of edgeR for our disease-state and activity signature genes, we performed 1,000 permutation tests ( Li et al., 2022 40. Li, Y. ∙ Ge, X. ∙ Peng, F. ... Exaggerated false positives by popular differential expression methods when analyzing human population samples Genome Biol. 2022; 23 :79 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each test, we randomly shuffled the sample label of our dataset and then performed differential gene expression analysis using edgeR ( Figure S3 E). We used the identical expression data as we used in the original analysis (we selected Naive CD4 samples in the discovery cohort as a representative data).
We also calculated the Jaccard similarity index and Spearman correlation across all pairs of different cell types for both signature genes. The Jaccard similarity distances (i.e., 1 - Jaccard similarity indexes) of each pair within disease-state signature genes were used for hierarchical clustering ( Figure 3 D). Similarly, Spearman’s correlation distance of each pair within disease-activity signature genes were used for hierarchical clustering ( Figure S3 F).
To exclude the influence of one specific organ involvements on the results of activity DEG analysis, we performed the same activity DEG analyses excluding patients with one specific organ involvement (knock-out DEG analysis). Since there were only three HDA patients without serological activity, we did not apply this analysis to serological activity. Then, we compared logFC of each cell type from this knock-out DEG analysis with that from the original DEG analysis (27 cell types x 6 knock-out processes = 162 comparisons; Figure S5 D).
To detect DEGs related to therapeutic agents adjusted for confounding factors (e.g., disease activity), we set the patients not taking the agent as the control, meaning the down-DEGs represented the genes that were downregulated by each agent. Therefore, we calculated Jaccard indexes as the ratio of the shared genes with the inverse sign between the disease-activity signatures and MMF-DEGs over the union of these two signature genes ( Figure 6 E). We calculated Jaccard indexes within the cell types in which more than 300 MMF-DEGs were observed.
To assess the validity and generalizability of disease-state and activity signatures, we conducted replication analysis. We compared both signature genes with the immune cell RNA-seq data from the following three independent cohorts of SLE and/or HC from different ancestries. Importantly, the high cellular resolution is a big advantage of our discovery cohort, but at the same time it put hurdle on the replication analysis since many of the previous studies do not have the same-level cellular resolution as our study; hence this replication study is limited by imperfect cell-type matching ( Table S2 C). i) Cohort 1 ( Panwar et al., 2021 54. Panwar, B. ∙ Schmiedel, B.J. ∙ Liang, S. ... Multi–cell type gene coexpression network analysis reveals coordinated interferon response and cross–cell type correlations in systemic lupus erythematosus Genome Res. 2021; 31 :659-676 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). • Samples: 64 SLE and 24 HC, multi-ancestry cohort (Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, and African). • Cell subsets: six cell types (bulk T cells [T], bulk B cells [B], classical monocytes [CL Mono], myeloid DCs [mDC], plasmacytoid DCs [pDC] and Neu). Only CL Mono was collected from all donors, and the other five cell types were collected from around 20 SLE and 10 HC samples. • Data usage strategy: since this cohort included both SLE and HC, we used this cohort for the replication analysis of disease-state and activity signatures ( Figures S3 G, S3H, and S5 D). Naive CD4 and naive B cells (Naive B) data from the current study were compared with bulk T and bulk B data from cohort 1, respectively ( Table S2 C). ii) Cohort 2 ( Takeshima et al., 2022 63. Takeshima, Y. ∙ Iwasaki, Y. ∙ Nakano, M. ... Immune cell multiomics analysis reveals contribution of oxidative phosphorylation to B-cell functions and organ damage of lupus Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2022; 81 :845-853 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). • Samples: 30 SLE and 37 HC, All East Asian (EAS). • Cell subsets: 19 cell types (Naive CD4, memory CD4 [Mem CD4], Th1, T helper 2 cells [Th2], Th17, Tfh, fraction II effector regulatory T cells [Fr. II eTreg], Naive CD8, bulk memory CD8 [Mem CD8], NK, Naive B, USM B, SM B, DN B, plasmablasts, CL Mono, CD16 positive monocytes (CD16p Mono), mDC, and pDC). • Data usage strategy: this is our previous cohort independent of the ImmuNexUT. In this study, we excluded the overlapped samples with the current study, leaving relatively stable 30 SLE patients for the analysis. Therefore, we used this cohort only for the replication of disease-state signatures ( Figures S3 G and S5C). Effector memory CD8 T cells (EM CD8) data from the current study was compared with bulk Mem CD8 data from cohort 2 ( Table S2 C). iii) Cohort 3 ( Andreoletti et al., 2021 4. Andreoletti, G. ∙ Lanata, C.M. ∙ Trupin, L. ... Transcriptomic analysis of immune cells in a multi-ethnic cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus patients identifies ethnicity- and disease-specific expression signatures Commun. Biol. 2021; 4 :488 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). • Samples: 57 White and 63 Asian SLE patients. • Cell subsets: four cell types (bulk CD4 T cells [CD4], NK cells, bulk B cells [B], and bulk monocytes [Mono]). • Data usage strategy: since this cohort did not include HC samples, we used this cohort only for the replication of disease-activity signatures ( Figures S3 H and S5C). Naive CD4, Naive B, and CL Mono data from the current study were compared with bulk CD4, bulk B, and bulk monocyte data from cohort 3, respectively ( Table S2 C).
In all replications, we assessed the concordance of the directions of disease-state and activity signature genes in the discovery cohort with the corresponding genes in external cohorts using one-sided binomial sign tests. The definitions of clinical status (e.g., disease-state and activity) were consistent with our discovery cohort, with the exception that inactive SLE in cohort 2 was defined as 0 ≤ SLEDAI-2K ≤ 2 (10 patients) since there were no patients with SLEDAI-2K = 0. In all replication analyses, we adjusted for the covariates (e.g., age and sex) in line with the analyses of the discovery dataset where applicable.
To assess the validity of disease-state and activity PCs in the discovery dataset, we projected the data from the three external datasets onto our PCA space in the corresponding cell types ( Table S2 C). In this PC projection method, we first computed the Z score matrix of gene expressions using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the discovery dataset and then inferred the PC scores of each sample from the external datasets as the inner products of each PC loading ( Table S1 E) and the Z score matrix. We tested the association of these PC scores with disease-state (i.e., inactive SLE vs. HC) and disease-activity (i.e., HDA vs. inactive SLE) in the external datasets using the linear regression model as with the discovery dataset ( Table S4 B). We then assessed the concordance of the directions of the effect sizes for disease-state and disease-activity PCs, respectively, using one-sided binomial sign tests ( Figure S5 C).
To assess the contribution of clinical parameters to the within-SLE transcriptome variation in the replication cohorts, we again performed weighted variance partitioning analysis using replication cohort 1 and 3 ( Figures S2 L and S5 H) as with the discovery cohort. We used PC1-7 from each cell type in line with the analysis in the discovery cohort. In Figure S2 L, since cohort 3 did not provide the detailed clinical information other than disease activity, we could not calculate the variance explained by treatment, age and sex. Similarly, since cohort 1 did not provide the dose of PSL in most cases, we could not calculate the variance explained by PSL. In Figure S5 H, we could not utilize cohort 3 since detailed information of organ activity was not available.
To predict which cytokine ligand-receptor interactions could potentially induce the disease-state and activity signatures in each cell type, we performed NicheNet analysis ( Browaeys et al., 2020 9. Browaeys, R. ∙ Saelens, W. ∙ Saeys, Y. NicheNet: modeling intercellular communication by linking ligands to target genes Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :159-162 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S4 A and S4B). NicheNet predicts which ligands produced by a sender cell are the most active to induce gene expression in the receiver cells (upstream ligand activity analysis; Figures S4 A and S4B, (1)). In this analysis, we considered the differentially expressed cytokine-encoding genes (i.e., disease-state and activity cytokines; Figure 4 A) for which their corresponding receptors were expressed in at least one cell type ( Figures S4 A and S4B, (2)) as potential ligands. Ligand activity scores were inferred for the disease-state and activity signature genes of each cell type. In the ligand activity heatmap, we showed the union of top 3 prioritized cytokines for each signature. In the ligand-target genes heatmap ( Figures S4 A and S4B, (3)), we showed the union of the top 10 most strongly predicted targets of the prioritized cytokines. Among their regulatory potential scores, we omitted the lowest 20% scores for visualization of the heatmap, according to the developer’s approach.
To test pathway and transcription factor (TF) enrichment in each disease-state and activity signature genes, we performed over-representation analyses with one-sided Fisher’s exact test in R package clusterProfiler (v.3.18.1) ( Yu et al., 2012 70. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... ClusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS A J. Integr. Biol. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18538) PubMed Google Scholar ). Statistical significance was set at FDR < 0.05 with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. For TF datasets, we used the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB) C3 all TF targets annotation (1133 annotations) ( Kolmykov et al., 2021 35. Kolmykov, S. ∙ Yevshin, I. ∙ Kulyashov, M. ... Gtrd: an integrated view of transcription regulation Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :D104-D111 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). For pathway datasets, we used the MsigDB hallmark gene set collection (50 annotations) ( Liberzon et al., 2015 41. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The molecular signatures database hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6412) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway (548 annotations) ( Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 33. Kanehisa, M. ∙ Goto, S. KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28 :27-30 Crossref Scopus (23411) PubMed Google Scholar ). To capture the cell-type-specific biology linked to disease-state and activity signatures genes, we set the union of both signature genes in all cell types as the background gene sets. To overview the biology unique to each signature, we first classified all significant KEGG pathways to 33 subcategories according to the definition of the developers’ website ( https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html ). We further classified these 33 subcategories to four main categories based on the biological relevance and summarized the number of enrichments for each category and subcategory, respectively ( Figures 4 C and S4 E).
For organ activity-related and treatment-related DEGs (e.g., renal-DEGs, BLM-DEGs and MMF-DEGs), we restricted the pathway enrichment analysis to the cell types with the number of DEGs > 300.
All 22 individuals received BLM treatment according to the standard protocols ( Navarra et al., 2011 50. Navarra, S.V. ∙ Guzmán, R.M. ∙ Gallacher, A.E. ... Efficacy and safety of Belimumab in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus: A randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial Lancet. 2011; 377 :721-731 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1612) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stohl et al., 2017 61. Stohl, W. ∙ Schwarting, A. ∙ Okada, M. ... Efficacy and safety of subcutaneous Belimumab in systemic lupus erythematosus: a fifty-two-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study Arthritis Rheumatol. 2017; 69 :1016-1027 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this section, we defined those whose original disease-activity categories were moved into one or more lower categories (e.g., MDA to LDA or LDA to inactive) between pre- and post-BLM treatment, as good responders, and the others as poor responders.
Because edgeR did not implement generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), we detected DEGs between pre- and post-BLM using the following GLMM with negative binomial distribution in lme4 (v1.1-27.1) ( Bates et al., 2015 7. Bates, D. ∙ Mächler, M. ∙ Bolker, B.M. ... Fitting linear mixed-effects models using lme4 J. Stat. Softw. 2015; 67 :1-48 Crossref Scopus (53152) Google Scholar ), setting the statistical significance at FDR < 0.05 with the Benjamini-Hochberg method ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Of note, we need to consider the batch effects as covariates in the following equation, since TMM-normalized counts were not corrected for batch effects ( STAR Methods ; QC of the expression data ). 𝑦 = 𝛽 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + ( 1 | ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ) + 𝜋 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ + 𝜃
Here, 𝑦 and 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑀 represents the TMM-normalized count for each gene in each cell type and the treatment status of BLM (i.e., pre- and post-BLM). We included a term for random intercept of individuals, and hence excluded individual-specific covariates (e.g., age and sex). In this equation, we set pre-BLM as the control, meaning the down-DEGs represented the genes that were downregulated by BLM treatment. Therefore, we calculated Jaccard indexes as the ratio of the shared genes with the inverse sign between the disease-activity signatures and BLM-related DEGs over the union of these two signature genes ( Figure 6 B). We calculated Jaccard indexes only in the B-lineage cells in which more than 300 BLM-DEGs were observed. To evaluate BLM effects on all cell types, we next extended this analysis to all activity signature genes, not restricting it to BLM-DEGs. We tested the associations between logFCs in disease-activity effects and those in BLM effects using linear regression model ( Figures S6 A and S6B).
To explain the difference between good-responder BLM-DEGs and poor-responder BLM-DEGs of B-lineage cells in Figure 6 B, we additionally constructed the following GLMM, using all BLM-related samples (joint model; n=22x2): 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 : 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛽 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛾 · 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛿 · 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 : 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑀 + ( 1 | 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ) + 𝜋 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ + 𝜃 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 : 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 = 𝛽 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛾 · 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + ( 1 | 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ) + 𝜋 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ ℎ + 𝜃
This joint model enabled us to directly examine treatment response-specific BLM-DEGs (as indicated by the interaction term “response: BLM” in the model), adjusting for individual-level effect as a random effect ( Table S5 B). In this model, the expected behavior of the effect sizes for the treatment response-specific BLM-DEGs (δ in the above model) would be as follows: i) up-regulated BLM-DEGs of good responder in our original manuscript: δ > 0. ii) down-regulated BLM-DEGs of good responder in our original manuscript: δ < 0. iii) up-regulated BLM-DEGs of poor responder in our original manuscript: δ < 0. iv) down-regulated BLM-DEGs of poor responder in our original manuscript: δ > 0.
We calculated the concordance rates of good- or poor-responder BLM-DEGs (up or down) in Figure 6 B that showed expected signs of interaction effect size in the joint model ( Figure S6 C).
In the PC projection method, we first computed the Z score matrix of gene expressions using the mean and SD of the discovery dataset and then inferred the PC scores of duplicated samples as the inner products of each PC loading ( Table S1 E) and the Z score matrix. To test the association between the change of PC scores and the treatment status, we used the following linear mixed model: 𝑦 = 𝛽 · 𝐵 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + ( 1 | ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ) + 𝜃
Here, 𝑦 represents the scaled PC score for each cell type. In this model, it was not necessary to consider the batch effects since the PCA was performed using the log(CPM+1) gene expression data that had been already corrected for batch effects ( STAR Methods ; QC of the expression data ).
To evaluate the enrichment of the genome-wide distribution of all SLE risk variants irrespective of their effect sizes (heritability) around HC-SEG, disease-state and activity signature genes, we performed stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (S-LDSC) ( Finucane et al., 2015 20. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Gusev, A. ... Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1228-1235 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 21. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Reshef, Y.A. ∙ Anttila, V. ... Heritability enrichment of specifically expressed genes identifies disease-relevant tissues and cell types Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :621-629 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). We examined the enrichment of SLE heritability for common variants within 100-kb windows on either side of the transcription start site of the genes with the top 1,000 highest Z-scores in either signature genes for each cell type, adjusting for baseline model provided by the developers ( Finucane et al., 2015 20. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Bulik-Sullivan, B. ∙ Gusev, A. ... Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1228-1235 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 A). For this analysis, we used two large-scale SLE GWAS summary statistics from EAS ( Yin et al., 2021 69. Yin, X. ∙ Kim, K. ∙ Suetsugu, H. ... Meta-analysis of 208370 East Asians identifies 113 susceptibility loci for systemic lupus erythematosus Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2021; 80 :632-640 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ) and EUR ancestries ( Langefeld et al., 2017 38. Langefeld, C.D. ∙ Ainsworth, H.C. ∙ Cunninghame Graham, D.S.C. ... Transancestral mapping and genetic load in systemic lupus erythematosus Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :16021 Crossref Scopus (280) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S7 A). Since the regression coefficients of S-LDSC are influenced by the GWAS heritability, we normalized coefficients by dividing them with mean per-SNP heritability as reported by a previous report ( Finucane et al., 2018 21. Finucane, H.K. ∙ Reshef, Y.A. ∙ Anttila, V. ... Heritability enrichment of specifically expressed genes identifies disease-relevant tissues and cell types Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :621-629 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ); we then reported normalized coefficients. In a fixed-effect meta-analysis of the two results, we used the inverse variance weighting method using normalized coefficients and their S.E. We reported P values to test whether the regression coefficient is significantly positive.
To call HC-SEG (specifically expressed genes in HC) for each cell type, we compared the expression data of one cell type with that of the remaining cell types that belong to other cell lineages using the GLM with negative binomial distribution in edgeR (v3.32.1) ( Robinson et al., 2010 58. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: A Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26732) PubMed Google Scholar ). To be in line with previous studies of S-LDSC, only the samples from HC were used in this analysis.
The SLE-GWAS results were downloaded from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog ( Buniello et al., 2019 10. Buniello, A. ∙ Macarthur, J.A.L. ∙ Cerezo, M. ... The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog of published genome-wide association studies, targeted arrays and summary statistics 2019 Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :D1005-D1012 Crossref Scopus (2457) PubMed Google Scholar ) on 16/08/2021. To assign the most likely causal genes to SLE-GWAS significant variants ( P < 5×10 -8 ), we used the L2G score from Open Targets Genetics ( Ghoussaini et al., 2021 23. Ghoussaini, M. ∙ Mountjoy, E. ∙ Carmona, M. ... Open Targets genetics: systematic identification of trait-associated genes using large-scale genetics and functional genomics Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :D1311-D1320 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). We defined the genes that showed L2G score > 0.5 ( Mountjoy et al., 2021 49. Mountjoy, E. ∙ Schmidt, E.M. ∙ Carmona, M. ... An open approach to systematically prioritize causal variants and genes at all published human GWAS trait-associated loci Nat. Genet. 2021; 53 :1527-1533 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ) for at least one SLE-GWAS variant as SLE-GWAS prioritized genes (131 genes in total; Table S6 B). Gene symbols were based on UCSC definition. To test the enrichment of SLE-GWAS prioritized genes for disease-state and activity signature genes, we performed over-representation analyses with one-sided Fisher’s exact test ( Figure 7 B). We set the union of the genes that passed the filtering of low expression in each cell type and used it as the background.
To compare the direction between the risk allele’s expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects and disease-state and activity signature genes, we utilized the results of the colocalization test between SLE-GWAS and ImmuNexUT eQTL data reported in Ota et al. (2021) 52. Ota, M. ∙ Nagafuchi, Y. ∙ Hatano, H. ... Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases Cell. 2021; 184 :3006-3021.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar . For visualization, logFC sign information was adjusted so that the direction of the coherent genes, which showed the concordant direction between eQTL effects for risk alleles and differential expressions ( Marigorta et al., 2017 45. Marigorta, U.M. ∙ Denson, L.A. ∙ Hyams, J.S. ... Transcriptional risk scores link GWAS to eQTLs and predict complications in Crohn’s disease Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1517-1521 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 E), was positive (i.e., adjusted logFC).
If a gene modulates the magnitude of eQTL effect on another eGene depending on its expression level, we refer to that gene as proxy gene (prGene) ( Zhernakova et al., 2017 71. Zhernakova, D.V. ∙ Deelen, P. ∙ Vermaat, M. ... Identification of context-dependent expression quantitative trait loci in whole blood Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :139-145 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). To examine the interactive effects of the signature genes on the eQTL effects of SLE risk variants as prGenes, we fitted the eGene expressions to the following linear regression models for each cell type ( Figure 7 F): 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 : 𝑦 = 𝜌 · 𝐺 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] + 𝜇 · 𝑥 + 𝛽 · 𝐺 : 𝑥 + ∑ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 𝛾 · 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛿 · 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁡ [ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 ] + 𝜀 · 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ] + 𝜖 · 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃 𝑁 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 : 𝑦 = 𝜌 · 𝐺 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] + 𝜇 · 𝑥 + ∑ 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 𝛾 · 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝛿 · 𝑃 ⁢ 𝑆 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁡ [ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑔 ] + 𝜀 · 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ [ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑠 ] + 𝜖 · 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁡ 𝑥 ⁡ [ 0 , 1 ] + 𝜃
Here, 𝑦 and 𝑥 represents the expression of eGene and prGene, respectively, and 𝐺 represents the genotype of each individual. 𝐼 𝑘 ⁡ ( 𝑘 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) represents each immunosuppressant (MMF, HCQ, TAC) as covariates. We tested the significance of interaction terms (i.e., 𝐺 : 𝑥 ) by comparing full and null models using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at FDR < 0.05 with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.
The statistical details and tests are indicated in the figure legends or STAR Methods . Throughout the analyses, multiple test correction was performed with Benjamini-Hochberg method unless otherwise indicated.
