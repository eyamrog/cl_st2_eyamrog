Title: The single-cell epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination


Abstract: Summary

Emerging evidence indicates a fundamental role for the epigenome in immunity. Here, we mapped the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza vaccination in humans at the single-cell level. Vaccination against seasonal influenza induced persistently diminished H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), which was associated with impaired cytokine responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated expression of antiviral genes and heightened resistance to the unrelated Zika and Dengue viruses. These results demonstrate that vaccination stimulates persistent epigenomic remodeling of the innate immune system and reveal AS03’s potential as an epigenetic adjuvant.

Section: Introduction

Recent research has highlighted a central role for the epigenome in the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The epigenome can maintain particular chromatin states over prolonged periods of time that span generations of cells, thus enabling the durable storage of gene-expression information ( Allis and Jenuwein, 2016 3. Allis, C.D. ∙ Jenuwein, T. The molecular hallmarks of epigenetic control Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :487-500 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In the context of the immune system, epigenomic events have been described during hematopoiesis ( Buenrostro et al., 2018 18. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Corces, M.R. ∙ Lareau, C.A. ...

Immunol. 2020; 20 :375-388 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The concept of epigenetic imprinting on the innate immune system has acquired a particular significance in the context of vaccination ( Wimmers and Pulendran, 2020 112. Wimmers, F. ∙ Pulendran, B. Emerging technologies for systems vaccinology - multi-omics integration and single-cell (epi)genomic profiling Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2020; 65 :57-64 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vaccination with live-attenuated bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) has been shown to induce epigenomic changes in monocytes ( Arts et al., 2018 7. Arts, R.J.W. ∙ Moorlag, S.J.C.F.M. ∙ Novakovic, B. ...

Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :17537-17542 Crossref Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ), and it has been suggested that such changes result in a durable state of innate activation. However, the extent to which such epigenomic imprinting, observed with BCG vaccination, reflects a more general phenomenon with other vaccines is an open question. Furthermore, the critical parameters that determine vaccination-induced epigenomic imprinting, such as the type of vaccine or adjuvant used, or the impact of the microbiome, are not known. Notably, previous studies identified transcriptional and protein level heterogeneity within monocyte and dendritic cell populations ( Alcántara-Hernández et al., 2017 2.

How this cellular heterogeneity affects epigenomic imprinting during an immune response to a vaccine or to any stimulus is entirely unknown.
Recently, researchers have used systems biology approaches to comprehensively analyze the transcriptional, metabolic, proteomic, and cellular landscape in response to vaccination in humans and identified correlates and mechanisms of vaccine immunity ( Gaucher et al., 2008 37.

Immunol. 2020; 65 :57-64 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite these advances, a comprehensive systems biology assessment of the human epigenomic landscape during an immune response, particularly at the single-cell level, is missing.
In the current study, we used single-cell techniques, including EpiTOF (epigenetic landscape profiling using cytometry by time-of-flight) ( Cheung et al., 2018 23. Cheung, P. ∙ Vallania, F. ∙ Warsinske, H.C. ... Single-Cell Chromatin Modification Profiling Reveals Increased Epigenetic Variations with Aging Cell. 2018; 173 :1385-1397 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ), single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), to study the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination in humans. We found that vaccination with the trivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV) induced global changes to the chromatin state in multiple immune cell subsets, which persisted for up to 6 months after vaccination. These changes were most pronounced in myeloid cells, which demonstrated a transition to inaccessible chromatin in loci targeted by AP-1 transcription factors, and reduced cytokine production. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct subclusters within the monocyte population that were characterized by differences in AP-1 accessibility. Vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pre-pandemic influenza vaccine additionally induced increased chromatin accessibility at IRF and STAT loci and heightened resistance against heterologous viral infection during in vitro culture.

Section: Results

To determine how immunization with TIV affects the epigenomic landscape of the immune system at the single-cell level, we employed EpiTOF to analyze a cohort of 21 healthy individuals aged 18–45 before and after TIV administration ( Data S1 ). All subjects received TIV on day 0. To determine the impact of the gut microbiota on the epigenomic immune cell landscape, a subgroup of ten subjects received an additional oral antibiotic regimen, consisting of neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole, between days −3 and 1 ( Figure 1 A). Our previous work with this cohort had demonstrated that antibiotics administration induced significant changes in the transcriptional and metabolic profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized antibiotics administration would induce epigenomic reprogramming of PBMCs. To test these hypotheses, we developed two EpiTOF panels and probed the global levels of 38 distinct histone marks, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, citrullination, and crotonylation, in 21 distinct immune cell subsets ( Data S2 ). Using EpiTOF, we analyzed PBMCs ( Figure S1 A) isolated at day −21 and 0 prior to vaccination, and days 1, 7, 30, and 180 after vaccination. While the frequency of immune cell populations did not change significantly between these time points, we observed a trend toward reduced fractions of myeloid cells in some subjects at later time points, and a transient increase in the proportion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in response to antibiotics treatment (days 0, 1) ( Figure S1 B), in line with previous observations ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Next, we extracted the histone modification information for each subset and generated a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) representation of the epigenomic immune cell landscape ( Figure 1 B). In the UMAP space, lymphoid cells separated from myeloid cells, while hematopoietic progenitors (CD34 + ) showed a unique epigenetic pattern distinct from fully differentiated immune cells. When generating a sample-level UMAP representation, there was a segregation of samples isolated at various times after vaccination, especially at day 30 relative to baseline samples, indicating TIV-induced epigenetic changes ( Figure 1 C, left). In contrast to previous studies using blood transcriptomics and metabolomics ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ), antibiotics status had no measurable impact on histone modification levels and samples from antibiotics-treated and control subjects were intermixed ( Figure 1 C, right). Rather, we observed changes in the acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation states of several histone marks in response to vaccination, regardless of exposure to antibiotics ( Figures S1 C and S1D). To enhance statistical power, we combined both groups for downstream analyses. We detected an increase in several histone methylation marks in CD34 + cells and a decrease in multiple acetylation marks in myeloid cells in day 30 samples over baseline ( Figure 1 D). Also, we observed increased H2BS14ph in multiple immune cell subsets at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure S1 C). Elevated H2BS14ph has been shown to occur during apoptosis ( Cheung et al., 2003 22. Cheung, W.L. ∙ Ajiro, K. ∙ Samejima, K. ...

However, we did not observe reduced cell viability at any time point ( Figure S1 A), suggesting H2BS14ph functions independent of apoptosis in post-vaccination immune cells. Notably, H2BS14ph is catalyzed by Mst1/STK4, whose immune modulatory role has been reported ( Cho et al., 2019 24. Cho, K.-M. ∙ Kim, M.S. ∙ Jung, H.-J. ...

Classical monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) were characterized by repressed H2BK5ac, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H4K5ac at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure 1 E). PADI4, an arginine deiminase catalyzing histone citrullination, was also repressed in these cells. Notably, pairwise correlation analysis identified high correlation coefficients between acetylation marks and PADI4 ( Figure S1 E). PADI4 has been implicated in monocyte development, and inflammation ( Cheung et al., 2018 23. Cheung, P. ∙ Vallania, F. ∙ Warsinske, H.C. ...

Longitudinal analysis demonstrated a time-dependent decrease of the four histone acetylation marks and PADI4, which showed the greatest repression at day 30 and largely returned to baseline levels at day 180 ( Figure 1 F). Blood transcriptomics data obtained from PBMCs of the same subjects at early time points after vaccination ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed downregulation of histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/CBP ( Weinert et al., 2018 110. Weinert, B.T. ∙ Narita, T. ∙ Satpathy, S. ...

Cell. 2009; 17 :674-686 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) at days 1, 3, and 7 after vaccination ( Figure S2 A). In contrast, various histone deacetylases showed increased expression ( Figure S2 A). Moreover, the expression of lysine methyltransferase EZH2 was elevated ( Figure S2 A), consistent with increased H3K27me3, an antagonist of H3K27ac, in classical monocytes and mDCs ( Figure 1 E). Epigenomic and transcriptional analysis thus both point toward a, potentially repressive, state of hypoacetylation in myeloid cells after immunization with TIV.
Next, we investigated the TIV-induced epigenomic alterations in myeloid cells at the single-cell level ( Figure 1 G). By performing sub-clustering and UMAP-based dimensionality reduction analysis of mDCs and classical monocytes using the H3K27ac, H2BK5ac, H4K5ac, H3K9ac, and PADI4 marks, we constructed the single-cell histone modification landscape. Importantly, in both cell types, single cells segregated according to vaccination time point with cells at day 0 and 1 clustering together on one side of the 2D space, and cells at day 30 occupying the opposite side ( Figure 1 G). Interestingly, and undetected by the bulk analysis ( Figure 1 F), cells at day 180 did not return to the baseline position occupied by day 0 cells but assumed an intermediate state ( Figure 1 G), indicating persistent epigenetic alterations that can be detected up to 6 months after immunization with TIV.
These observations raise the question of how persistent epigenetic changes lasting up to 6 months can be maintained in monocytes and mDCs, given that these cell types have a rapid turnover of less than 7 days. Recent studies indicate that such persistent changes in circulating myeloid cells are associated with changes in the hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment in the bone marrow ( Cirovic et al., 2020 25.

Modulation of Myelopoiesis Progenitors Is an Integral Component of Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 172 :147-161 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine whether this was also evident here, we calculated the epigenomic distance of CD34 + cells to a consensus profile of differentiated lymphoid or myeloid cells ( Figure S3 A). We detected multiple populations of CD34 + cells based on their epigenomic distances with minor populations showing relatively short distances to differentiated immune cells, possibly resembling pre-committed clones ( Figure S3 B). After vaccination, the overall distance between CD34 + cells and differentiated cells was greatly increased ( Figures S3 B–S3D) indicating a potential shift of the stem cell pool toward an immature phenotype after vaccination. At day 180, the distances returned to their pre-vaccination state.
To determine the functional consequence of the observed epigenetic changes in myeloid cells, we stimulated PBMCs from vaccinated individuals prior to vaccination or at various time points after vaccination, with cocktails of synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands mimicking bacterial (LPS, Flagellin, Pam-3-Cys) or viral (pI:C, R848) pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( Figure 2 A). After 24 h of stimulation, we measured the levels of 62 secreted cytokines in culture supernatants using a multiplexed bead-based assay. Our previous work using intracellular staining (data not shown), as well as work by others ( O’Gorman et al., 2015 79. O’Gorman, W.E. ∙ Hsieh, E.W.Y. ∙ Savig, E.S. ... Single-cell systems-level analysis of human Toll-like receptor activation defines a chemokine signature in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2015; 136 :1326-1336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) has demonstrated that monocytes are the most abundant and dominant contributors to cytokine production upon in vitro stimulation of PBMCs with the aforementioned stimuli. To determine whether PBMCs from time points after vaccination showed any alterations in cytokine production, we calculated the relative change in cytokine levels compared to day 0 ( Figure 2 B). Indeed, using hierarchical clustering, we identified a subset of cytokines that displayed a significant reduction at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure 2 B, red box, C). These cytokines include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-1RA, IL-12, and IL-10, the monocytic chemokines MCP1, MCP3, ENA78 (CXCL5), and IP-10 (CXCL10), as well as the monocyte growth factor GCSF. Similar to the kinetics of the epigenomic changes, reduced cytokine responses were evident as early as day 1 to 7 after vaccination, reaching a nadir at day 30, and returning to near-baseline levels at day 180 ( Figure 2 D). All these cytokines were strongly induced by both TLR cocktails ( Figure S4 A) and a reduction relative to day 0 was observed in both antibiotics-treated and control subjects ( Figure S4 B).
Next, we investigated whether there is a direct relationship between global histone modification levels and TLR-induced cytokine production. We used pairwise correlation analysis to correlate the cytokine levels in a sample with the EpiTOF histone modification levels in classical monocytes and with monocyte frequency in the PBMCs of the same sample and cell viability ( Figure 2 E). Strikingly, the histone acetylation marks previously identified in Figure 1 C, especially H3K27ac, and PADI4 showed positive correlation with cytokine production ( Figures 2 E and 2F). In contrast, H2BS14ph and several repressive methylation marks, including H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 ( Cao and Zhang, 2004 20. Cao, R. ∙ Zhang, Y.

Next, we determined whether perturbations of global histone acetylation or PADI4 activity affect TLR-induced cytokine secretion. We conducted an ex vivo stimulation experiment using specific inhibitors for the histone acetyl transferases CBP/p300 (A-485, inhibits acetylation at H3K27, H2BK5, and H4K5 [ Lasko et al., 2017 57.

Using flow cytometry, we assessed expression of H3K27ac and the intracellular accumulation of IL-1b and TNFa. As expected, treatment with the histone acetyl transferase inhibitor A-485 led to a concentration-dependent decrease in global histone H3K27ac levels in classical monocytes, while treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA generated a concentration-dependent increase (data not shown). Furthermore, treatment with the PADI4 inhibitor Cl − Amidine led to similar reductions in H3K27ac (data not shown) in line with the strong correlation of PADI4 and H3K27ac levels in EpiTOF ( Figure S1 E) and the previously observed ability of PADI4 to regulate CBP/P300 ( Lee et al., 2005 58. Lee, Y.-H. ∙ Coonrod, S.A. ∙ Kraus, W.L. ... Regulation of coactivator complex assembly and function by protein arginine methylation and demethylimination Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :3611-3616 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, none of these inhibitors influenced cell viability (data not shown). Next, we asked whether inhibition of CBP/P300 and PADI4 has an impact on cytokine production. Indeed, treatment with A-485 led to a major diminution in the frequency of IL-1b and TNFa positive monocytes after stimulation with LPS or R848 ( Figures 2 G and 2H). Cl − Amidine treatment, strikingly, led to a complete abrogation of cytokine production in these cells ( Figure 2 H).
To gain greater insight into the epigenomic changes induced by vaccination, we conducted ATAC-seq analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) purified innate immune cell subsets before and after vaccination ( Figure 3 A). After preprocessing, we retained a high-quality dataset of 51 unique samples ( Data S3 ). To identify the molecular targets of the TIV-induced epigenomic changes, we determined genomic regions with significantly changed chromatin accessibility at day 30 after vaccination compared to day 0. Overall, we detected more than 10,000 differentially accessible regions (DARs) in CD14 + monocytes and ∼4,500 DARs in mDCs, while pDCs showed only minor changes ( Figure 3 B). In line with reduced histone acetylation levels detected by EpiTOF, the majority of DARs in monocytes and mDCs showed a reduction in chromatin accessibility indicating reduced gene activity ( Figure 3 B). In contrast, comparing samples from day −21 before antibiotics treatment and day 0 during antibiotics treatment showed a modest increase in chromatin accessibility ( Figure S5 A). Overrepresentation analysis of antibiotics-induced DARs demonstrated enrichment of pathways associated with PAX3 targets and inflammation ( Figures S5 B and S5C) in line with upregulated expression of these genes in a previous analysis of the cohort ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, we did not observe an antibiotics-induced change in the accessibility of any of the cytokines altered in Figure 2 and D0vD30 DARs correlated well between antibiotics-treated and control subjects ( Figure S5 D). Among the top 200 vaccine-induced DARs in CD14 + monocytes, we identified many immune-related genes with reduced accessibility, including several cytokines and chemokines and their associated receptors (IL18, CCL20, CXCL8, CXCL3, IL4R, IL6R-AS1), pathogen recognition receptors (CLEC5A, CLEC17A), and adhesion molecules (CD44, CD38) ( Figure 3 C). We also observed reduced accessibility in regions coding for molecules associated with Ras-MAPK-AP-1 signaling (RAP2B, ETS1, MAP3K8, DUSP5) ( Figure 3 C). Importantly, genomic loci associated with seven of the ten cytokines with reduced post-vaccination levels during ex vivo stimulation showed reduced accessibility ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 C, right panel). Interestingly, these reduced DARs were predominantly located in non-promoter regions ( Figure 3 C) suggesting the involvement of distal regulatory elements such as enhancers. Pathway analysis followed by network analysis of all DARs in CD14 + monocytes revealed two major biological themes: TLR and cytokine signaling, and genome rearrangement ( Figure 3 D). The TLR and cytokine cluster was dominated by pathways with mostly reduced chromatin accessibility, while terms in the genome rearrangement cluster were mixed. Notably, DARs associated with signaling pathways around Ras and MAPK signaling were enriched as well.
Next, to identify regulatory patterns, we determined whether the identified DARs in each cell type were enriched for transcription factor (TFs) binding motifs. Indeed, we observed an enrichment for bZIP TFs of the AP-1 family including c-Jun and c-Fos in DARs of monocytes and mDCs, and on average DARs carrying such a motif showed a reduction in chromatin accessibility after vaccination, especially in non-promoter regions ( Figure 3 E). Overrepresentation analysis of the DARs in classical monocytes further confirmed this finding and showed strong enrichment for target genes of c-Jun in DARs with reduced accessibility at day 30 ( Figure 3 F). In addition, we observed reduced expression of several AP-1 family members, including c-Jun, at day 30 after vaccination ( Figure 3 F).

Similar to the histone acetylation changes, the reduction in AP-1 TF expression was first detected at day 7 after vaccination and was most pronounced at day 28 ( Figure 3 G).
To determine whether the observed reduction in AP-1 accessibility is related to the reduced levels of histone acetylation, we correlated the normalized accessibility levels of all genomic regions in every sample to histone mark levels in classical monocytes or mDCs isolated from the same sample. Using enrichment analysis on the highly correlated peaks (p ≤ 0.05), we identified a significant enrichment of target genes for multiple AP-1 family members, including c-Fos and c-Jun ( Figure 3 H).
These findings suggest the possibility of a causal link between reduced histone acetylation/PADI4 and reduced AP-1 accessibility. Indeed, previous studies described a direct physical interaction and functional co-dependence between AP-1 and the histone acetyl transferases CBP/P300 ( Arias et al., 1994 6.

To investigate whether AP-1 activity and histone acetylation are also functionally linked in classical monocytes, we conducted an ex vivo stimulation experiment using the same specific inhibitors of histone acetylation and PADI activity as in Figure 2 . To gauge AP-1 activity, we used a monoclonal antibody specific for the activated form of c-Jun, phosphorylated at serine 73. While treatment with LPS or R848 alone induced a robust upregulation of p-c-Jun that can be readily detected by flow cytometry ( Figures 3 I and 3J), pre-treatment with A-485 or Cl − Amidine, which lead to reduced histone acetylation, abolished c-Jun activation completely ( Figures 3 I and 3J).
Previous studies using transcriptomics and proteomics approaches detected heterogeneity within monocyte and dendritic cell populations at steady state ( Alcántara-Hernández et al., 2017 2.

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals new types of human blood dendritic cells, monocytes, and progenitors Science. 2017; 356 :eaah4573 Crossref Scopus (890) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is unclear how this heterogeneity affects the epigenomic landscape in such cells and their response to vaccination. To address this, we used scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq and constructed the single-cell landscape of the innate immune response to TIV at the epigenomic and transcriptional level. PBMCs from vaccinated individuals were isolated, enriched for DC subsets, and analyzed using droplet-based single-cell gene-expression and chromatin accessibility profiling ( Figure 4 A). After initial pre-processing, we obtained chromatin accessibility data from 62,101 cells with an average of 4,126 uniquely accessible fragments. These cells displayed the canonical fragment size distribution and showed high signal-to-noise ratio at transcription start sites (data not shown). Using UMAP representation and chromVAR TF deviation patterns, we generated an epigenomic map of the innate immune system and identified clusters for all major innate immune cell subsets, including classic and non-classical monocytes, mDCs, and pDCs ( Figure 4 B; Data S4 ). In parallel, we used the scRNA-seq data to construct a gene-expression map. After pre-processing, we retained 34,368 high-quality transcriptomes with an average of 2,477 genes and 8,951 unique transcripts detected per cell. UMAP representation in combination with clustering allowed us to identify all major innate immune cell subsets ( Data S4 ). These subsets were found at all vaccine time points and in samples of all subsets ( Data S4 ).
Next, we used chromVAR to determine the TIV-induced changes in TF chromatin accessibility. AP-1 accessibility was strongly reduced at day 30 after vaccination in classical monocytes and mDCs (both cDC1 and cDC2) ( Figure 4 C) confirming our findings with bulk ATAC-seq ( Figure 3 ). In addition, using the single-cell dataset, we observed that the reduction in AP-1 accessibility starts early, at day 1 after vaccination ( Figure 4 C) suggesting that the TIV-induced epigenomic reprogramming is imprinted during the acute phase of the vaccine response. At the gene level, we observed a reduction in the expression of multiple AP-1 members including ATF3, JUND, JUNB, FOS, and FOSL2 (data not shown).
Next, we determined the impact of cellular heterogeneity on TIV-induced epigenomic changes. Sub-clustering analysis of classical monocytes revealed the presence of four distinct populations based on chromatin accessibility ( Figure 4 D; Data S4 ) with different temporal patterns ( Figure 4 E): while clusters 6 and 8 dominated the classic monocyte pool at day 0, most cells at day 30 belonged to cluster 5 ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Notably, the observed heterogeneity between the classic monocyte populations was driven by differences in AP-1 and, to a lesser extent, CEBP accessibility ( Figure 4 F). While the dominating clusters at day 0 (cluster 6 and 8) were high in AP-1 accessibility, cells in cluster 5, which was predominantly found at day 30, were low in AP-1 ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Cells in cluster 3 exhibited intermediate AP-1 and CEBP accessibility ( Figure 4 G) and their relative abundance was stable throughout vaccination ( Figure 4 E). Using Hotspot ( DeTomaso and Yosef, 2020 29. DeTomaso, D. ∙ Yosef, N. Identifying Informative Gene Modules Across Modalities of Single Cell Genomics bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), we determined a set of genomic regions underlying the observed heterogeneity ( Figure 4 I). This set was enriched for regions associated with the production of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR signaling ( Figure 4 J), and included regions associated with the AP-1 members FOS and JUN, multiple MAP kinases, and NFKB. Importantly, cells with high AP-1 accessibility using the motif-based chromVAR analysis also displayed high accessibility at the regions coding for inflammatory genes ( Figures 4 H and 4I). Finally, using the scRNA-seq dataset, we determined the cellular heterogeneity at the transcriptional level. Although genes in the Hotspot module varied in their expression between single classical monocytes, this heterogeneity was less distinct compared to the epigenomic landscape ( Figure 4 K).
The effects of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination in inducing reduced chromatin accessibility of AP-1 loci, and reduced H3K27ac and refractoriness to TLR stimulation by myeloid cells, was unexpected and seemingly at odds with prior work on the live attenuated BCG vaccine showing enhanced and persistent innate responses to vaccination, termed “trained immunity” ( Arts et al., 2018 7. Arts, R.J.W. ∙ Moorlag, S.J.C.F.M. ∙ Novakovic, B. ... BCG Vaccination Protects against Experimental Viral Infection in Humans through the Induction of Cytokines Associated with Trained Immunity Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :89-100 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raised the possibility that the live BCG vaccine delivered potent adjuvant signals that stimulated persistent epigenomic changes in myeloid cells, whereas the seasonal influenza vaccine, devoid of an adjuvant, was unable to stimulate trained immunity and instead induced a form of trained tolerance. We hypothesized that the addition of an adjuvant to an inactivated influenza vaccine would induce enhanced and persistent innate responses. We used AS03, a squalene-based adjuvant containing alpha-tocopherol that induces strong innate and adaptive immune responses ( Pulendran et al., 2021 83. Pulendran, B. ∙ S Arunachalam, P. ∙ O’Hagan, D.T. Emerging concepts in the science of vaccine adjuvants Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2021; 20 :454-475 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is included in the licensed H5N1 avian influenza vaccine ( Garçon et al., 2012 36.

Phase 1 trial of a Candidate Recombinant Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 Disease Produced in Plants medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We investigated the effect of AS03 on the epigenomic immune cell landscape in a cohort of healthy individuals that were vaccinated with an inactivated split-virion vaccine against H5N1 influenza administered with or without AS03 ( Figure 5 A). The vaccine was administered in a prime-boost regimen and individuals received injections at day 0 and day 21.
First, we determined whether AS03 affected the vaccine-induced chromatin mark changes observed after vaccination with TIV. Using EpiTOF, we analyzed PBMC samples from 18 vaccinated subjects (9 H5N1, 9 H5N1+AS03) at day 0, 7, 21, 28, and 42 and constructed the histone modification profile landscape ( Figure 5 B, Figure S6 A). Comparing histone modification profiles at day 0 with day 42, we, unexpectedly, observed that vaccination with H5N1+AS03 induced a significant reduction in H3K27ac, H4K5ac, H3K9ac, and PADI4 in classical monocytes, four of the five highly correlated marks associated with myeloid reprogramming after TIV ( Figure 5 C). In contrast, vaccination with H5N1 alone did not induce significant changes in these chromatin marks. In line with these findings, we also observed in the H5N1+AS03 group but not the H5N1 group significantly reduced production of most of the innate cytokines and chemokines that were diminished after vaccination with TIV ( Figure 5 D). Notably, we did not detect a change in the frequency or viability of classical monocytes and all detected cytokines were strongly induced by TLR stimulation ( Figures S6 A and S6B).
Next, we analyzed subjects using scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq. PBMC samples from 4 vaccinated individuals (2 H5N1, 2 H5N1+AS03) at days 0, 21, and 42 were enriched for DC subsets and analyzed using droplet-based single-cell gene-expression and chromatin accessibility profiling. After initial pre-processing, we obtained high quality chromatin accessibility data from 58,204 cells with an average of 2,745 uniquely accessible fragments, which we used to generate an epigenomic map of the single immune cell landscape during H5N1 vaccination ( Figure 5 E; Data S5 ). In parallel, we used the scRNA-seq data to construct a gene-expression map of the single immune cell landscape. We retained 11,213 high-quality transcriptomes with an average of 2,462 genes and 9,569 unique transcripts detected per cell and identified all major innate immune cell subsets ( Figure 5 E; Data S5 ). The different immune cell subsets were evenly distributed over all vaccine conditions and time points ( Data S5 ).
Notably, using the scATAC-seq data, we observed a significant reduction in AP-1 accessibility in H5N1+AS03 but not H5N1 alone ( Figure 5 F). To further investigate the nature of the epigenomic changes after H5N1+AS03, we determined differentially accessible regions at day 42 after vaccination compared to day 0 using a logistic regression model that corrects for library-size differences. Using overrepresentation analysis, we found that similar to TIV, the predominantly negative DARs were enriched for TLR-, and cytokine-signaling pathways as well as innate immune activity ( Figure 5 G). Additionally, we observed a reduction in the expression of multiple AP-1 family members, including c-Fos and c-Jun as observed after vaccination with TIV ( Figure 5 H).
Despite the reduction in AP-1 accessibility, our scATAC-seq analysis revealed an increase in chromatin accessibility at day 42 compared to day 0 for several TFs of the interferon-response factor (IRF) and STAT families ( Figure 6 A). These changes were observed in innate immune cell populations of subjects vaccinated with H5N1+AS03, but not with H5N1 alone. Further analysis of the kinetics revealed that these IRF- and STAT-related changes were already present after administration of the first vaccination at day 21 (pre-boost) ( Figure 6 B). Using the scRNA-seq dataset, we compared the expression of IRF and STAT family TFs before (day 0) and after prime (day 21) or boost (day 42) vaccination. We observed significant increases in the expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in multiple innate immune cell subsets after vaccination with H5N1+AS03 but not with H5N1 alone ( Figure 6 C). Notably, at a single-cell level, IRF accessibility was generally negatively correlated with AP-1 accessibility ( Figure 6 D), especially in dendritic cells. Next, we determined the log fold change in chromatin accessibility for peaks containing the IRF1 binding motif ( Figure 6 E). Indeed, we observed a significant change in accessibility in many peaks, many of which showed increased accessibility ( Figure 6 E). Importantly, among the genes with increased accessibility, we identified many interferon (IFN)- and antiviral-related genes, including DDX58 (encoding the viral detector RIG-I), several interferon response genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFI30, ISG20, OASL), as well as the transcription factors IRF1 and IRF8. Enrichment analysis further demonstrated an enrichment of genes related to antiviral immunity ( Figure 6 F). In contrast to this H5N1+AS03-induced effect, vaccination with TIV induced only a transient type I IFN response ( Figure S7 A) and only a transient increase in IRF and STAT accessibility at day 1 after vaccination ( Figure S7 B). At day 30 after vaccination with TIV, the majority of significantly changed peaks with an IRF motif in fact showed reduced chromatin accessibility ( Figure S7 C) and scRNA-seq gene-expression analysis showed no change in IRF and STAT TF gene expression at day 30 ( Figure S7 D). This is in line with the findings from bulk ATAC-seq where we observed an enrichment of IFN response pathway genes in DARs with reduced accessibility but not in those with enhanced accessibility ( Figure S7 E). Together, this indicates that, only vaccination with H5N1+AS03, but not H5N1 alone or TIV, leads to an overall enhanced accessibility of the antiviral response loci. IRF1, together with STAT1 and IRF8, orchestrates monocyte polarization in response to interferon gamma exposure ( Langlais et al., 2016 56. Langlais, D. ∙ Barreiro, L.B. ∙ Gros, P. The macrophage IRF8/IRF1 regulome is required for protection against infections and is associated with chronic inflammation J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :585-603 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ); IFN signaling, via JAK/TYK, leads to phosphorylation of IRF and STAT TFs ( Tamura et al., 2008 98. Tamura, T. ∙ Yanai, H. ∙ Savitsky, D. ... The IRF family transcription factors in immunity and oncogenesis Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26 :535-584 Crossref Scopus (811) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, we observed an increase in IFN gamma levels in plasma of vaccinated subjects immediately after prime and boost vaccination with H5N1+AS03, but not with H5N1 alone ( Figure 6 G). The levels of IP10, a cytokine that is produced by monocytes in response to IFN signaling, were also elevated ( Figure 6 G). This raises the possibility that IFN signaling could have induced the increased IRF accessibility.
Next, we determined whether the observed epigenomic changes were translated to changes in gene expression in resting monocytes. We assessed the relationship between the change in accessibility for significantly changed peaks carrying the IRF1 motifs and the change in gene expression for the same gene ( Figure 6 H). Notably, we detected a weak association between changes in accessibility and gene expression (Pearson correlation R = 0.082, p = 0.017, chi-square p = 0.62) indicating that the increased accessibility has limited impact on homeostatic gene expression in these cells. Instead, we hypothesized that the changes in chromatin accessibility enhance the induced response to viral stimuli in activated cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed bulk RNA-seq data from 50 (16 H5N1, 34 H5N1+AS03) vaccinated subjects at time points before and after the prime (days 0, 1, 3, and 7) and booster (days 21, 22, 24, and 28) vaccination. As expected, antiviral- and interferon-related genes were upregulated at day 1 after each vaccination, especially in the group that received H5N1+AS03 ( Figure 6 I). Importantly, subjects receiving a H5N1+AS03 booster vaccination (day 22 versus day 21) displayed even higher levels of antiviral gene expression compared with the response to the prime vaccine (day 1 versus day 0) ( Figure 6 I). The booster vaccine was given at a time when the chromatin accessibility landscape of the innate immune system was altered suggesting that the increased accessibility in IRF loci might enable the enhanced response to the booster vaccine. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the increase in gene expression of antiviral- and interferon-related genes during booster compared to prime with the change in chromatin accessibility at day 21 compared to day 0 ( Figure 6 J). Indeed, we observed a significant association between both variables (chi-square p = 0.01), and most genes with increased expression after booster vaccination also showed increased chromatin accessibility at the time the booster vaccine was administered. Genes with increased accessibility and enhanced expression were enriched for IRF1 transcription factor target genes ( Figure 6 K). This is in line with the elevated levels of IP-10 and IFN gamma observed in plasma of individuals after booster compared to prime vaccination ( Figure 6 G).
To determine whether the observed epigenomic changes resulted in enhanced resistance to viral infections, we infected PBMCs at days 0, 21, and 42 with Dengue or Zika virus ( Figure 7 A). Previous studies have shown that the primary targets of these viruses in PBMCs are monocytes and dendritic cells ( Kou et al., 2008 53. Kou, Z. ∙ Quinn, M. ∙ Chen, H. ... Monocytes, but not T or B cells, are the principal target cells for dengue virus (DV) infection among human peripheral blood mononuclear cells J. Med. Virol. 2008; 80 :134-146 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ; Michlmayr et al., 2017 71. Michlmayr, D. ∙ Andrade, P. ∙ Gonzalez, K. ... CD14 + CD16 + monocytes are the main target of Zika virus infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a paediatric study in Nicaragua Nat. Microbiol. 2017; 2 :1462-1470 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). After infection, we cultured cells for 0, 24, and 48 h and determined the viral copy number using qPCR ( Figure 7 B). We observed increased numbers of Zika and Dengue virus copies at 24 h and reduction at 48 h following the expected cycle of infection, replication, and eventual death of the host cells ( Figure 7 C). Next, we compared the viral titers at day 21 and 42 after vaccination with the pre-vaccination titers at day 0 for each subject. Strikingly, we observed a significant reduction in viral titers for both Dengue and Zika virus at day 21 after vaccination ( Figure 7 D). Importantly, in many subjects, we observed reduced viral titers as late as 42 days after initial vaccination ( Figure 7 D). Next, we determined the cytokine concentration in infected PBMC cultures at 24 h after infection ( Figure 7 E). While Dengue and Zika virus induced the production of both IFNa and IFNg, we observed that Dengue virus suppressed the production of IP10 ( Figure 7 E). Finally, we correlated the change in viral titers at d0 compared to d21 with the change in vaccine-induced expression of antiviral genes that were associated with open chromatin ( Figure 6 J, red quadrant). The majority of these genes correlated negatively with viral titers ( Figure 7 F). Strikingly, IRF1 was among the top genes negatively correlating (r < −0.8) with both Dengue and Zika titers ( Figure 7 F). Subjects with enhanced IRF1 expression at day 21 showed reduced viral titers at the same time point ( Figure 7 G). In addition, the antiviral gene ANKRD22, which is involved in immunity to both Dengue and Chikungunya infection ( Soares-Schanoski et al., 2019 94. Soares-Schanoski, A. ∙ Baptista Cruz, N. ∙ de Castro-Jorge, L.A. ... Systems analysis of subjects acutely infected with the Chikungunya virus PLoS Pathog. 2019; 15 :e1007880 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), was also highly negatively correlated with Zika and Dengue titers.

Section: Discussion

Our results demonstrate that the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine TIV and the adjuvanted pre-pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1+AS03) induce profound and persistent global epigenomic changes in blood myeloid cells, and that these epigenomic changes are linked to alterations in their function. The observed changes were most pronounced at 3–4 weeks after vaccination, but traces of an altered epigenomic landscape were still detectable as late as 180 days after vaccination. In contrast to vaccination, antibiotics treatment only had a transient and subtle impact on the epigenomic immune cell landscape.
Based on their molecular and functional characteristics, the observed epigenomic changes can be broadly classified into two distinct types: (1) a state of innate immune refractoriness that is characterized by reduced histone acetylation, reduced PADI4 levels, reduced AP-1 accessibility, and diminished production of innate cytokines; (2) a state of heightened antiviral vigilance defined by increased IRF accessibility, elevated antiviral gene expression, increased interferon production, and, most importantly, enhanced control of heterologous viral infections. Importantly, both states can occur simultaneously and in the same single cell. While seemingly paradoxical, this superimposition might represent an evolutionary adaptation to avoid excess inflammatory host damage during late stages of infections, while maintaining a state of immunological vigilance against viral infections.
Our findings were unexpected as researchers previously observed that the live-attenuated BCG vaccine induces elevated H3K27ac levels in CD14 + monocytes, which coincided with enhanced cytokine production in these cells ( Arts et al., 2018 7. Arts, R.J.W. ∙ Moorlag, S.J.C.F.M. ∙ Novakovic, B. ... BCG Vaccination Protects against Experimental Viral Infection in Humans through the Induction of Cytokines Associated with Trained Immunity Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :89-100 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, our results suggest that vaccine-induced epigenomic reprogramming of immune cells is more complex. Given the observed reduction in H3K27ac levels in association with immune refractoriness in this study, the possibility arises that histone acetylation could represent a bi-directional regulator, powered by epigenomically distinct states at the single-cell level, that can be raised or lowered to manipulate monocyte cytokine production accordingly, akin to a thermostat dial ( Figure 7 H). In addition, our data demonstrate that multiple distinct epigenomic states, such as antiviral vigilance and immune refractoriness, can be superimposed within the same cell. Importantly, this superimposition is encoded at the single-cell level as single monocytes and dendritic cells displayed elevated IRF and diminished AP-1 accessibility at the same time.
Single-cell analysis further revealed multiple clusters within the classic monocyte population based on differences in chromatin accessibility. Notably, all these epigenomic subclusters existed before vaccination and their abundance within the pool of circulating cells shifted post-vaccination driving the observed bulk level changes. The transcription factor families underlying the observed heterogeneity, AP-1 and CEBP, were previously described as key players in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation ( Phanstiel et al., 2017 81. Phanstiel, D.H. ∙ Van Bortle, K. ∙ Spacek, D. ... Static and Dynamic DNA Loops form AP-1-Bound Activation Hubs during Macrophage Development Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :1037-1048 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ) and classic-to-non-classic monocyte differentiation ( Guilliams et al., 2018 39. Guilliams, M. ∙ Mildner, A. ∙ Yona, S. Developmental and Functional Heterogeneity of Monocytes Immunity. 2018; 49 :595-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. AP-1 signaling is also a central regulator of inflammation ( Van der Bruggen et al., 1999 103. van der Bruggen, T. ∙ Nijenhuis, S. ∙ van Raaij, E. ...

Biol. 2003; 23 :2871-2882 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our Hotspot analysis revealed differences in accessibility at inflammatory loci between epigenomic subclusters. This might suggest that distinct functional and ontogenetic fates could be imprinted within the epigenome of single monocytes. Indeed, it was recently hypothesized that classical monocytes could represent a heterologous population of cells, some pre-committed to tissue infiltration and macrophage differentiation and others primed for differentiation into non-classical monocytes ( Guilliams et al., 2018 39. Guilliams, M. ∙ Mildner, A. ∙ Yona, S. Developmental and Functional Heterogeneity of Monocytes Immunity. 2018; 49 :595-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). The functional relevance of these epigenomically distinct subsets of myeloid cells, and their developmental relationships deserve further exploration.
With respect to the molecular mechanisms driving the epigenomic changes, we observed that the state of antiviral vigilance was associated with enhanced IRF1 and STAT1 activity and enhanced accessibility of many, but not all, loci targeted by IRF. It is established that IRF and STAT signaling promotes antiviral immunity ( Tamura et al., 2008 98. Tamura, T. ∙ Yanai, H. ∙ Savitsky, D. ... The IRF family transcription factors in immunity and oncogenesis Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26 :535-584 Crossref Scopus (811) PubMed Google Scholar ) and KO models lacking IRF1 or STAT1 are more susceptible to viral infection ( Meraz et al., 1996 69. Meraz, M.A. ∙ White, J.M. ∙ Sheehan, K.C.F. ...

Immunol. 2019; 10 :1019 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the state of immune refractoriness was associated with a global reduction in histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility. The magnitude of the observed changes suggests a comprehensive switch toward a broadly restrictive chromatin state ( Allis and Jenuwein, 2016 3. Allis, C.D. ∙ Jenuwein, T. The molecular hallmarks of epigenetic control Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :487-500 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Our TF motif-based analysis revealed that AP-1 loci are affected by this process. AP-1 is a dimeric TF composed of different members of the FOS, JUN, ATF, and JDP families, and our gene-expression analysis suggests that multiple members including FOS, JUN, JUNB, and ATF3 are involved. While the role of AP-1 as a key regulator of differentiation, inflammation, and polarization in myeloid cells is well described ( Behre et al., 1999 13.

A fundamental question concerns the mechanisms by which vaccination induces such long-lasting epigenetic changes in myeloid cells. The half-lives of most DC and monocyte subsets are known to be only a few days ( van Furth and Cohn, 1968 104. van Furth, R. ∙ Cohn, Z.A. The origin and kinetics of mononuclear phagocytes J. Exp. Med. 1968; 128 :415-435 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kamath et al., 2000 45. Kamath, A.T. ∙ Pooley, J. ∙ O’Keeffe, M.A. ... The development, maturation, and turnover rate of mouse spleen dendritic cell populations J. Immunol. 2000; 165 :6762-6770 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it is unclear how epigenetic changes acquired by a DC or monocyte responding to a vaccine might be maintained for several weeks or months. Multiple explanations are conceivable: for instance, the phenomenon of innate memory could simply be caused by the effects of an ongoing adaptive immune response on innate immune cells (via paracrine signaling of cytokines such as interferon-gamma), rather than being an intrinsic property of innate immune cells. Furthermore, innate memory could be maintained by some long-lived population of innate immune cells, like memory T and B cells, and such cells could respond with enhanced vigor to a secondary vaccination or infection. Finally, it is possible that epigenetically reprogrammed myeloid cells in the periphery are continually replenished by altered myeloid cell precursors in the bone marrow ( Cirovic et al., 2020 25. Cirovic, B. ∙ de Bree, L.C.J. ∙ Groh, L. ...

Mitroulis, I. ∙ Ruppova, K. ∙ Wang, B. ... Modulation of Myelopoiesis Progenitors Is an Integral Component of Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 172 :147-161 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (328) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the context of our results, it might be possible that soluble mediators related to the vaccine response, such as interferons, could act on progenitor cells in the bone marrow ( Boettcher and Manz, 2017 17. Boettcher, S. ∙ Manz, M.G. Regulation of Inflammation- and Infection-Driven Hematopoiesis Trends Immunol. 2017; 38 :345-357 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our results from the H5N1+AS03 vaccine revealed that PBMCs from vaccinated individuals control infection with the heterologous Dengue and Zika virus more efficiently than pre-vaccination PBMCs. These results, in combination with the enhanced expression of antiviral genes and increased levels of IP-10 and IFN gamma production in vivo , suggest that the epigenomic state of antiviral vigilance might provide broad protection against viral infections unrelated to the vaccine virus. Elevated levels of IFN gamma production at day 1 after booster vaccination were also detected with AS03-adjuvanted vaccines in the context of Hepatitis ( Burny et al., 2017 19. Burny, W. ∙ Callegaro, A. ∙ Bechtold, V. ..., ECR-002 Study Group Different Adjuvants Induce Common Innate Pathways That Are Associated with Enhanced Adaptive Responses against a Model Antigen in Humans Front. Immunol. 2017; 8 :943 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggesting that antiviral vigilance might also be induced by other vaccines containing AS03. In contrast, TIV induced a profound state of immune refractoriness at four weeks after vaccination. Nevertheless, it is important to highlight that there is ample evidence that TIV does prevent influenza ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020 21. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Seasonal Flu Vaccine Effectiveness Studies 2020 https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm Google Scholar ), and our own study found induction of robust anti-influenza antibody titers ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, the severity of many viral infections, including influenza and COVID-19, is closely linked to the level of inflammation-related immunopathology. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that in addition to stimulating robust antigen-specific antibody responses, TIV vaccination could also promote disease tolerance that could conceivably help ameliorate the immunopathology caused by excessive inflammation in severe disease caused by influenza. Taken together, these results suggest that it could be beneficial to administer TIV together with an adjuvant, such as AS03. This adjuvanted TIV would exploit the beneficial effects of both epigenomics-driven states observed here: IRF-driven antiviral vigilance, and AP-1 driven immune refractoriness and disease tolerance. Indeed, a phase 3 clinical trial comparing the response to TIV versus TIV+AS03 in more than 43,000 elderly individuals demonstrated that TIV+AS03 led to a profound reduction in all-cause death and pneumonia compared to TIV alone, while influenza-specific immunity was only somewhat increased ( McElhaney et al., 2013 67. McElhaney, J.E. ∙ Beran, J. ∙ Devaster, J.-M. ..., Influence65 study group AS03-adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine against seasonal influenza in elderly people: a phase 3 randomised trial Lancet Infect. Dis. 2013; 13 :485-496 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that vaccination with AS03-adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccine induces persistent epigenomic changes in myeloid cells, leading to an antiviral state and protection against heterologous viruses. These findings have implications for the design of future vaccines consisting of epigenetic adjuvants that provide broad, non-specific protection by manipulating the epigenomic landscape.
Two key areas deserve further exploration: (1) the mechanism(s) by which such persistent epigenomic changes occur in myeloid cells, and (2) the functional consequence of this epigenomic reprogramming in mediating antiviral protection against heterologous virus infections in vivo remain unknown. Future studies in animal models and, controlled human challenge model studies, can help address these important issues.

The study design was as described in phase 1 of the original publication ( Hagan et al., 2019 41. Hagan, T. ∙ Cortese, M. ∙ Rouphael, N. ... Antibiotics-Driven Gut Microbiome Perturbation Alters Immunity to Vaccines in Humans Cell. 2019; 178 :1313-1328 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the study was conducted in Atlanta, GA. In brief, during the 2014-2015 seasons, we enrolled a total of 21 healthy adults who were randomized into antibiotics-treated (n = 10) and control (n = 11) groups. Subjects were males and non-pregnant females between the ages of 18-40 who met the eligibility criteria as listed on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02154061). Subject demographics are listed in ( Data S1 , related to STAR Methods ). The antibiotics treatment consisted of a cocktail of neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole, all given orally, for five days. Antibiotic treatment started 3 days before the day of vaccination and continued until one day after for the antibiotics-treated group. All the study participants were vaccinated with Sanofi Pasteur’s TIV vaccine, Fluzone, for the 2014-2015 season ( Data S1 , related to STAR Methods ) . Written informed consent was obtained from each subject and protocols were approved by Institutional Review Boards of Emory University.
This study was conducted in Atlanta, GA. Subjects were males and non-pregnant females who met the eligibility criteria as listed on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01910519). We enrolled a total of 50 healthy adults who were randomized into two groups receiving either the adjuvanted (H5N1+AS03, n = 34) or unadjuvanted (H5N1, n = 16) GSK avian influenza vaccine. While both vaccines contained split-virion (A/Indonesia/5/2005) inactivated hemagglutinin antigen, the adjuvanted vaccine additionally contained the AS03 adjuvant system (containing DL-alpha-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion). Subject demographics are listed in ( Data S1 , related to STAR Methods ). Written informed consent was obtained from each subject and protocols were approved by Institutional Review Boards of Emory University.
Samples from healthy subjects were collected at Stanford Blood Center or derived from the before-vaccination time point of a previous vaccination trial ( Nakaya et al., 2015 77. Nakaya, H.I. ∙ Hagan, T. ∙ Duraisingham, S.S. ... Systems Analysis of Immunity to Influenza Vaccination across Multiple Years and in Diverse Populations Reveals Shared Molecular Signatures Immunity. 2015; 43 :1186-1198 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). All subjects provided a confidential medical history card and completed informed consent to donate blood for clinical or research uses. We exclude subjects with known diseases, including but not limited to HIV, and hepatitis infections. Purification of buffy coat or LRS chamber from whole blood was performed at Stanford Blood Center to enrich for leukocytes prior to PBMC isolation. From the vaccination trial ( Nakaya et al., 2015 77. Nakaya, H.I. ∙ Hagan, T. ∙ Duraisingham, S.S. ... Systems Analysis of Immunity to Influenza Vaccination across Multiple Years and in Diverse Populations Reveals Shared Molecular Signatures Immunity. 2015; 43 :1186-1198 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), only samples from subjects aged 26 – 41 were selected for this paper. Samples were only selected from the before vaccination time point at day 0. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject with institutional review and approval from the Emory University Institutional Review Board.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were isolated from fresh blood (CPTs; Vacutainer with Sodium Citrate; BD), following the manufacturer’s protocol. For samples from Stanford Blood Center, PBMCs isolated from whole blood, buffy coat or LRS chamber by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, #17-1440-02). PBMCs were frozen in DMSO with 10% FBS and stored at –80C and then transferred on the next day to liquid nitrogen freezers (–196C). Plasma samples from CPTs were stored at –80C. Trizol (Invitrogen) was used to lyse fresh PBMCs (1 mL of Trizol to ∼1.5x10ˆ6 cells) and to protect RNA from degradation. Trizol samples were stored at –80C.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and incubated in RPMI 1640 media (ThermoFisher) containing 10% FBS (ATCC) at 37°C for 1 hour prior to processing. Cisplatin (ENZO Life Sciences) was added to 10 μM final concentration for viability staining for 5 minutes before quenching with CyTOF Buffer (PBS (ThermoFisher) with 1% BSA (Sigma), 2mM EDTA (Fisher), 0.05% sodium azide). Cells were centrifuged at 400 g for 8 minutes and stained with lanthanide-labeled antibodies ( Data S2 , related to STAR Methods ) against immunophenotypic markers in CyTOF buffer containing Fc receptor blocker (BioLegend) for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT). Following extracellular marker staining, cells were washed 3 times with CyTOF buffer and fixed in 1.6% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) at 1x10 6 cells/ml for 15 minutes at RT. Cells were centrifuged at 600 g for 5 minutes post-fixation and permeabilized with 1 mL ice-cold methanol (Fisher Scientific) for 20 minutes at 4°C. 4 mL of CyTOF buffer was added to stop permeabilization followed by 2 PBS washes. Mass-tag sample barcoding was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol (Fluidigm). Individual samples were then combined and stained with intracellular antibodies in CyTOF buffer containing Fc receptor blocker (BioLegend) overnight at 4°C. The following day, cells were washed twice in CyTOF buffer and stained with 250 nM 191/193Ir DNA intercalator (Fluidigm) in PBS with 1.6% PFA for 30 minutes at RT. Cells were washed twice with CyTOF buffer and once with double-deionized water (ddH2O) (ThermoFisher) followed by filtering through 35 μm strainer to remove aggregates. Cells were resuspended in ddH2O containing four element calibration beads (Fluidigm) and analyzed on CyTOF2 (Fluidigm).
Aliquots of thawed PBMCs from the EpiTOF experiment described above were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Corning, 10-040-CV) containing 10% FBS (Corning, 35-011-CV) and 1x Antibiotics/Antimycotics (Lonza, 17-602E) [complete media abx] at 4x10ˆ6 cells/mL. 100 μL of cell solution were added to each well of a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate and mixed with 100 μL of either complete media abx (unstim), a cocktail of synthetic TLR ligands mimicking bacterial pathogens (bac: 0.025 μg/mL LPS, 0.3 μg/mL Flagellin, 10 μg/mL Pam3CSK4), or a cocktail of synthetic TLR ligands mimicking viral pathogens (vir: 4 μg/mL R848, 25 μg/mL pI:C). Depending on cell numbers, PBMCs from each sample were stimulated with all 3 conditions in duplicate. After 24h of incubation at 37C and 5% CO 2 , cells were spun down, supernatant was carefully transferred into new plates, and immediately frozen at −80C until further analysis using Luminex.
The Luminex assay was performed by the Human Immune Monitoring Center, Stanford University School of Medicine. Human 62-plex custom Procarta Plex Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations with modifications as follows: Briefly, Antibody-linked magnetic microbeads were added to a 96-well plate along with custom Assay Control microbeads (Assay Chex) by Radix Biosolutions. The plates were washed in a BioTek ELx405 magnetic washer (BioTek Instruments). Neat cell culture supernatants (25ul) and assay buffer (25ul) were added to the 96 well plate containing the Antibody-coupled magnetic microbeads, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. Room temperature and 4°C incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500–600 rpm. Following the overnight incubation, plates were washed in a BioTek ELx405 washer (BioTek Instruments) and then kit-supplied biotinylated detection Ab mix was added and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Each plate was washed as above, and kit-supplied streptavidin–PE was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, wash was performed as described, and kit Reading Buffer was added to the wells. Each sample was measured in two technical replicates where cell numbers allowed. Plates were read using a FlexMap 3D Instrument (Luminex Corporation). Wells with a bead count < 50 were flagged, and data with a bead count < 20 were excluded.
This assay was performed by the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Stanford University. A custom 41 plex from EMD Millipore kits was assembled and included: 1. A Pre-mixed 38 plex Milliplex Human Cytokine/Chemokine kit (CAT# HCYTMAG-60K-PX38) 2. ENA78/CXCL5 (CAT# HCYP2MAG-62K-01) 3. IL-22 (CAT# HTH17MAG-14K-01). 4. IL-18 (HIL18MAG-66K). Manufacturer’s recommendations were followed with modifications described. Briefly: neat supernatant samples (25ul) were mixed with antibody-linked magnetic beads in a 96-well plate containing assay buffer, for an overnight incubation at 4°C. Cold and Room temperature incubation steps were performed on an orbital shaker at 500-600 rpm. Plates were washed twice with wash buffer in a BioTek ELx405 washer (BioTek Instruments). Following one-hour incubation at room temperature with biotinylated detection antibody, streptavidin-PE was added for 30 minutes. Plates were washed as above, and PBS was added to wells for reading in the Luminex FlexMap3D Instrument with a lower bound of 50 beads per sample per cytokine. Each sample was measured in duplicate wells where cell numbers allowed. Custom Assay Chex control beads were added to all well (Radix Biosolutions). Wells with a bead count < 50 were flagged, and data with a bead count < 20 were excluded.
α-H3K27ac antibody was labeled using the Lightning-Link Rapid DyLight 488 Antibody Labeling Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions (Novus Biologicals, 322-0010). In brief, 100 μg of antibody was mixed with 10 μL of LL-Rapid modifier reagent and added onto the lyophilized dye. After mixing, solution was incubated at room temperature overnight in the dark. The next morning, 10 μL of LL-Rapid quencher reagent was added.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, counted, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Corning, 10-040-CV) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning, 35-011-CV) [complete media] at a concentration of 4x10ˆ6 cells/mL. Next, 150μL of cell suspension (6x10ˆ5 cells) was added to each well of a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate and mixed with 50 μL of inhibitor solution containing either Trichostatin A (TSA; CST, 9950S), A-485 (Tocris, 6387), or Cl − Amidine (EMD Millipore, 506282) in complete media. After 2h of incubation at 37C and 5% CO 2 , the cells were stimulated by adding either LPS (0.025 μg/mL; Invivogen, tlrl-pb5lps) or R848 (4 μg/mL; Enzo Life Sciences, ALX-420-038-M005) to the cultures. After another 2h of incubation, Brefeldin A (10 μg/mL; Sigma Aldrich, B7651-5MG) was added to all cultures and cells were incubated for a final 4h. After a total of 8h of incubation, cells were washed twice with 150 μL PBS (GE Life Sciences, SH30256.LS) and stained for viability using 100 μL of Zombie UV Fixable Viability Dye in PBS (1:1000; Biolegend, 423108). After incubating for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark, cells were washed twice with 150 μL PBS and blocked with 100 μL of PBS supplemented with 5% FBS, EDTA (2 mM; Corning, 46-034-cl), and human IgG (5 mg/mL; Sigma Aldrich, G4386-5G) [blocking buffer] for 15 minutes at 4C in the dark. After incubation, cells were stained for surface markers with 100 μL of antibody cocktail containing α-CD14 BUV805, α-CD3, CD19, CD20 BUV737, α-CD123 BUV395, α-HLA-DR BV785, α-CD16 BV605, α-CD56 PE-CY7, α-CD11c APC-eFluor780 in blocking buffer for 20 minutes at 4C in the dark. Next, cells were washed twice with 150 μL PBS, and fixed in 200 μL eBioscience Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, 00-5523-00) for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark. Afterward, cells were washed twice with 100 μL eBioscience Foxp3 permeabilization buffer and blocked with 100 μL permeabilization buffer containing human IgG (5 mg/mL) overnight at 4C in the dark. Cells were washed and stained for intracellular markers with 25 μL of antibody cocktail containing α-IL-1b Pacific Blue, α-H3K27ac DyLight 488, α-TNFa PE-Dazzle, α-p-c-Jun PE, and α-H3 AF647 in permeabilization buffer containing human IgG (5 mg/mL) for 60 minutes at 4C in the dark. Finally, cells were washed twice with 150 μL of permeabilization buffer, resuspended in 100 μL PBS containing 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA [FACS buffer], and acquired using a BD FACSymphony flow cytometer. Data was analyzed using Flowjo X software (BD). Briefly, cells were identified via FSC/SSC, doublets were discarded via SSC-A/SSC-H and FSC-A/FSC-H gates, and dead cells were discarded as Zombie UV Fixable Viability Dye high. Monocytes were then identified as CD3 - CD19 - CD20 - and CD14 + .
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, washed, counted, and resuspended in PBS (GE Life Sciences, SH30256.LS). 5-10x10ˆ6 cells were washed once more with 2 mL of PBS and stained for viability using 500 μL of Zombie UV Fixable Viability Dye in PBS (1:1000; Biolegend, 423108). After incubating for 30 minutes at 4C in the dark, cells were washed with 2 mL of PBS and resuspended in 500 μL blocking buffer. After spinning cells down, supernatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in 50 μL antibody cocktail containing α-CD3, CD19, CD20 BUV737, α-CD123 BUV395, α-HLA-DR BV785, α-CD14 BV605, α-CD56 BV510, α-CD1c BV421, α-CD327 AF488, α-CD370 PE, α-CD11c APC-eFluor780, α-CD15 AF700, and α-Axl APC in blocking buffer. Cells were stained for 15 minutes at 4C in the dark. Finally, cells were washed with 2 mL of FACS buffer, resuspended in PBS containing 5% FBS at 10-20x10ˆ6 cells/mL, and stored at 4C before sorting on a FACS Aria Fusion (BD). During sort, live innate cells were identified by gating on Viability Dye - CD3 - CD19 - CD20 - cells. Within this population, CD14 + monocytes were identified as CD14 + , mDCs were identified as CD14 - CD56 - HLA-DR + CD16 - CD11c + CD123 - , and pDCs were identified as CD14 - CD56 - HLA-DR + CD16 - CD11c - CD123 + .
Atac was performed on purified innate immune cell subsets immediately after sorting based on the low-input Omni-Atac protocol described before ( Corces et al., 2017 27. Corces, M.R. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ∙ Hamilton, E.G. ... An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :959-962 Crossref Scopus (422) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 1,500 – 5,500 cells were washed with ATAC resuspension buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 [Invitrogen, 15567027], 10 mM NaCl [Invitrogen, AM9760G], 3 mM MgCl 2 [Invitrogen, AM9530G], in water [Invitrogen, 10977015]) and supernatant was carefully aspirated, first using a P1000, then a P200 pipette. Next, 10 μL transposition mix (0.5 μL Tn5, 0.1 μL 10% Tween-20, 0.1 μL 1% Digitonin, 3.3 μL PBS, 1 μL water, and 5 μL tagmentation buffer) was added to the pellet and cells were resuspended by pipetting up and down 6 times. Tagmentation buffer was prepared locally by resuspending 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 , and 20% Dimethyl Formamide (Sigma Aldrich, D4551-250ML) in water. Cells were incubated at 37C for 30 minutes under constant mixing. After tagmentation, the reaction was cleaned up using the MinElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, 28006) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cleaned DNA was eluted in 21 μL of elution buffer, stored at −20C, and shipped to Active Motif for sequencing library preparation. At Active Motif, tagmented DNA was amplified with 10 cycles of PCR using customized Nextera PCR Primers 1 and 2 (see Key Resource table), and purified using Agencourt AMPure SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter, A63882). Resulting material was quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina platforms (Roche, 07960255001), and sequenced with PE42 sequencing on the NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina).
Bulk RNA-seq was performed on purified CD14 + monocytes after sorting. In brief, after sorting, 5,500 cells were washed, resuspended in 350 μL chilled Buffer RLT (QIAGEN, 79216) supplemented with 1% beta-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma, M3148-25ML), vortexed for 1 minute, and immediately frozen at −80C. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro kit (QIAGEN, 74004) with on-column DNase digestion. RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer and total RNA was used as input for cDNA synthesis using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio, 634894) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplified cDNA was fragmented and appended with dual-indexed bar codes using the NexteraXT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina, FC-131-1096). Libraries were validated by capillary electrophoresis on an Agilent 4200 TapeStation, pooled at equimolar concentrations, and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 at 100SR, yielding 20-25 million reads per sample.
Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, and innate immune cell subsets were isolated using FACS as described above (“FACS sorting – bulk ATAC-seq/RNA-seq”). Prior to FACS, monocytes and dendritic cells were negatively enriched using Dynabeads™ Pan Mouse IgG beads (Invitrogen, 11041) according to manufacturer instructions with purified anti-human antibodies against CD3 (Biolegend, clone: OKT3), CD19 (Biolegend, clone: HIB19), CD335 (Biolegend, clone: NKp46), CD66b (Biolegend, clone: G10F5), and CD235a (Biolegend, clone: HI264). Within the live gated cells, CD14 + monocytes were identified as CD14 + (fraction A) while a mixture of the remaining monocyte and dendritic cell subsets was identified as CD14 - CD56 - HLA-DR + (fraction B). After sorting and depending on the number of isolated cells, fraction A and B were mixed at a 2:1 ratio to yield a solution of monocytes and dendritic cells enriched for CD14 - cells.
FACS-purified cells were resuspended in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA (Miltenyi), and 0.5 U/μL RNase Inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich). About 9,000 cells were targeted for each experiment. Cells were mixed with the reverse transcription mix and subjected to partitioning along with the Chromium gel-beads using the 10X Chromium system to generate the Gel-Bead in Emulsions (GEMs) using the 3′ V3 chemistry (10X Genomics). The RT reaction was conducted in the C1000 touch PCR instrument (BioRad). Barcoded cDNA was extracted from the GEMs by Post-GEM RT-cleanup and amplified for 12 cycles. Amplified cDNA was subjected to 0.6x SPRI beads cleanup (Beckman, B23318). 25% of the amplified cDNA was subjected to enzymatic fragmentation, end-repair, A tailing, adaptor ligation and 10X specific sample indexing as per manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were quantified using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) analysis. Libraries were pooled and sequenced on an NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) using the recommended sequencing read lengths of 28 bp (Read 1), 8 bp (i7 Index Read), and 91 bp (Read 2).
FACS-purified cells were processed for single nuclei ATAC-seq according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics, CG000168 Rev D). Briefly, nuclei were obtained by incubating PBMCs for 3.20 minutes in freshly prepared Lysis buffer following manufacturer’s instructions for Low Cell Input Nuclei Isolation (10x Genomics, CG000169 Rev C). Nuclei were washed and resuspended in chilled diluted nuclei buffer (10x Genomics, 2000153). Next, nuclei were subjected to transposition for 1h at 37C on the C1000 touch PCR instrument (BioRad) prior to single nucleus capture on the 10x Chromium instrument. Samples were subjected to post GEM cleanup, sample index PCR, cleanup, and library QC prior to sequencing according to the protocol. Samples were pooled, quantified, and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) with at least minimum recommended read depth (25000 read pairs/nucleus).
Frozen plasma or supernatant was thawed at room temperature and analyzed using the IFNa and IFNg Human ProQuantum Immunoassay Kits according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, samples were mixed with assay dilution buffer at a 1:5 or 1:2 ratio and protein standard was serially diluted in assay dilution buffer. Next, Antibody-conjugates A and B were mixed with Antibody-conjugate dilution buffer and added to each well of a 96-well qPCR plate (Bio-Rad, #HSP9601). Next, diluted sample or standard were added to each well and mixtures were incubated for 1h at room temperature in the dark. Finally, Master mix and Ligase were mixed and added to each well. QPCR was conducted on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time Detection System (Biorad) using the recommended instrument settings. After measurements were completed, CT values were calculated using a regression model and exported to the ProQuantum Cloud app that accompanied the kit ( https://apps.thermofisher.com/apps/proquantum ). ProQuantum Cloud app was then used to construct a standard curve and calculate protein concentrations from CT values.
Plasma biomarker levels were assayed using a 10-analyte multiplex bead array (fractalkine, IL-12P40, IL-13, IL-1RA, IL-1b, IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, TNFβ; Millipore) prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol and read using a Bio-Plex 200 suspension array reader (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using Bio-Plex manager software (Bio-Rad).
Dengue virus (DENV- 2, Strain Thailand/16681/84) and Zika virus (PRVABC59) were propagated and titrated on Vero cells and stored at −80C until infection. Cryopreserved human PBMCs were thawed, washed, counted, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher, 72400-047) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning, 35-011-CV), 1mM Sodium pyruvate (Lonza, 13-115E), and 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin (Lonza, 17-602E) at 1.5x10ˆ6 cells/mL. 200 μL of cell solution (3x10ˆ5 cells) was added to each well of a 96-well round-bottomed tissue culture plate and cells were rested in plates for 4h at 37C and 5% CO 2 . After resting, PBMCs were infected with DENV-2 or ZIKV at MOI 1. At 0h, 24h, 48h post infection, PBMCs and supernatant were collected for RNA purification and cytokine analysis, respectively. Supernatants were immediately frozen at −20C and stored until analysis. Cells were suspended in RNA lysis buffer and kept at −20C until analysis. RNA was purified using the Purelink RNA kit according to manufacturer recommendations (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #12183052). For viral load detection, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted using Luna universal probe one-step RT-PCR kit (NEB, #E3006) on a CFX96 C1000 Touch Real-Time Detection System with 96-well plates (Bio-Rad, #HSP9601). RNA standards (ATCC, # VR-3229SD, VR-1843DQ) were used to generate standard curves. Viral RNA copies were normalized by cell number. Utilized primers and probes are listed in the key resources table .
Culture supernatants were thawed at room temperature and analyzed using the IP-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, DIP100) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, samples were thawed at room temperature and mixed with assay dilution buffer at 1:2 ratio. Protein standard was serially diluted in assay dilution buffer. Samples and standards were incubated in plate for 2h at room temperature. Plates were washed and then incubated with human IP-10 conjugate for 2h at room temperature. After wash, substrate solution was added for 30min. Finally, stop solution was added, A450 and A595 were read on a plate reader (Bio-Rad, iMARK). The concentration of IP-10 was determined by the number of A450-A595 based on the standard curve.
Raw data were pre-processed using FlowJo (FlowJo, LLC) to identify cell events from individual samples by palladium-based mass tags, and to segregate specific immune cell populations by immunophenotypic markers. A detailed gating hierarchy is described in Data S2 , related to STAR Methods (TIV & H5N1/H5N1+AS03). Single-cell data for various immune cell subtypes from individual subjects were exported from FlowJo for downstream computational analyses.
The exported Flowjo data were then normalized following the approach described in ( Cheung et al., 2018 23. Cheung, P. ∙ Vallania, F. ∙ Warsinske, H.C. ... Single-Cell Chromatin Modification Profiling Reveals Increased Epigenetic Variations with Aging Cell. 2018; 173 :1385-1397 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the value of each histone mark was regressed against the total amount of histones, represented by measured values of H3 and H4. For sample level analyses, the values of each histone mark were averaged for each cell type in each sample. Distances of HSC from lymphoid and myeloid epigenetic profiles were obtained by first computing centers of the epigenetic profiles for the two lineages, and then computing Euclidean distances from the centers for each individual HSC. Distances of HSC from epigenetic profiles of specific cell types were similarly obtained by computing Euclidean distances from the centers of the epigenetic profiles for each cell type. Statistical significance of the differences between groups at the sample level was assessed by computing an effect size with Hedges’ g formula ( Hedges and Olkin, 2014 43. Hedges, L.V. ∙ Olkin, I. Statistical Methods for Meta-Analysis Academic Press, 2014 Google Scholar ). All p values were corrected for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 15. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing. J. R. Stat Soc. Ser. B Methodol. 1995; 57 :289-300 Google Scholar ). Dimensionality reduction was performed with applying UMAP ( McInnes et al., 2020 68. McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ∙ Melville, J. UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction arXiv. 2020; 1802.03426 https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426 Google Scholar ). For single cell analyses, the normalized values were used as input. Correlation between variables was computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. All the analyses were performed using the R framework for statistical computing (Version 3.6.3) ( R Core Team, 2020 85. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2020 Google Scholar ).
Processed data was normalized in Bioconductor by RMA ( Irizarry et al., 2003 44. Irizarry, R.A. ∙ Hobbs, B. ∙ Collin, F. ... Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data Biostatistics. 2003; 4 :249-264 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which includes global background adjustment and quantile normalization. Samples from phase1 subjects in the antibiotics and control arm of the study were selected and statistical tests and correlation analyses were performed using MATLAB. Test details and significance cutoffs are reported in figure legends.
Statistical analysis was conducted in R (v 4.0.2) ( R Core Team, 2020 85. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2020 Google Scholar ). First, MFI data was log2 transformed and average MFI and CV was calculated from duplicate cultures where available. For samples with CV > 0.25, the duplicate that was closer to the average of all samples of that subject was kept and the other discarded. In case no other sample was available and CV > 0.25, the sample was discarded. Wells without indication of cytokine production were excluded. Statistical tests, correlation analysis, and hierarchical clustering were performed using the R packages stats (v 4.0.2), ggpubr (v 0.4.0) and pheatmap (v 1.0.12). Test details and statistical cutoffs are reported in the figure legends.
Reads were aligned using the BWA algorithm (mem mode; default settings; v 0.7.12) ( Li and Durbin, 2009 59. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (21353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Duplicate reads were removed, only reads mapping as matched pairs and only uniquely mapped reads (mapping quality > = 1) were used for further analysis. Alignments were extended in silico at their 3′ ends to a length of 200 bp and assigned to 32-nt bins along the genome. The resulting histograms (genomic “signal maps”) were stored in bigWig files. Peaks were identified using the MACS algorithm (v 2.1.0) ( Zhang et al., 2008 116. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (6782) PubMed Google Scholar ) at a cutoff of p value 1e-7, without control file, and with the –nomodel option. Peaks that were on the ENCODE blacklist of known false ChIP-Seq peaks were removed. Signal maps and peak locations were used as input data to Active Motif’s proprietary analysis program. For differential analysis, reads were counted in all merged peak regions (using Subread), and the replicates for each condition were compared using DESeq2 (v 1.24.0) ( Love et al., 2014 65. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (20156) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Quality control analysis of ATAC-seq data was performed using Rockefeller University workshop on analysis of ATAC-seq data in R and Bioconductor ( https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/RU_ATAC_Workshop.html ). Of 57 unique samples processed, 51 passed QC criteria and, on average, we detected more than 42,000 genomic regions and more than 15x10 6 unique ATAC tags per sample while the average fraction of reads in peaks was larger than 35% ( Data S3 , related to Figure 3 ). Passed samples showed the characteristic fragment length and TSS enrichment distribution ( Data S3 , related to Figure 3 ). DARs were annotated as promoter, distal and trans regulatory peak for a particular gene based on the distance from the middle of the peak to the nearest transcription start site (TSS) using the ChIPpeakAnno package in R (v. 3.24.1). Promoter, distal and trans regulatory peaks were defined as −2000 bp to +500 bp, −10kbp to +10kbp – promoter, and < −10kbp or > +10kbp from TSS, respectively. The hypergeometric distribution-based enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significance of the DARs. Reactome pathways and TF-target relationship using Chip-seq data from ENCODE (both downloaded from https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/ ) were used to identify overrepresented pathways and TFs. EnrichmentMap Pipeline Collection (v 1.1.0) ( Merico et al., 2010 70. Merico, D. ∙ Isserlin, R. ∙ Stueker, O. ... Enrichment map: a network-based method for gene-set enrichment visualization and interpretation PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e13984 Crossref Scopus (1058) PubMed Google Scholar ) for CytoScape (v 3.8.2) ( Shannon et al., 2003 93. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (18630) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to create the pathway network. Significantly enriched Reactome pathways (p ≤ 0.05) for each genomic region were used as input. Pathways were clustered and annotated using the AutoAnnotate function within the pipeline. To test for enrichment of TF motifs in DARs, the chromVAR (v 1.8.0) ( Schep et al., 2017 89. Schep, A.N. ∙ Wu, B. ∙ Buenrostro, J.D. ... chromVAR: inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility from single-cell epigenomic data Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :975-978 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ) and motifmatchr (v 1.8.0) packages were used in R (v 3.6.0) ( R Core Team, 2020 85. R Core Team R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2020 Google Scholar ). In brief, TF motifs were downloaded from the JASPAR2016 core Homo sapiens database ( Mathelier et al., 2016 66. Mathelier, A. ∙ Fornes, O. ∙ Arenillas, D.J. ... JASPAR 2016: a major expansion and update of the open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D110-D115 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and merged regions were annotated for the presence of all TF binding motifs using the matchMotifs (motifmatchr) function with standard settings. Hypergeometric distribution-based enrichment analysis was then performed to identify enrichment of TF motifs in DARs. To determine the relationship between EpiTOF and ATAC-seq data, the Pearson correlation was computed between EpiTOF H3K27ac levels and normalized read counts in each merged peak region. Positively correlated merged peak regions with p value < = 0.05 were selected for functional annotation. Enrichment analysis was performed as described above.
Alignment was performed using STAR version 2.7.3a ( Dobin et al., 2013 31. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (12731) PubMed Google Scholar ) and transcripts were annotated using GRCh38 Ensembl release 100. Transcript abundance estimates were calculated internal to the STAR aligner using the algorithm of htseq-count ( Anders et al., 2015 5. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (8250) PubMed Google Scholar ). DESeq2 version 1.26.0 ( Love et al., 2014 65. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (20156) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for differential expression analysis using the Wald test with a paired design formula and using its standard library size normalization.
Processed bulk transcriptomics data from nine independent TIV studies conducted between 2007 and 2012 were obtained from GEO (GEO: GSE47353 , GSE59635 , GSE29619 , GSE74813 , GSE59654 , GSE59743 , GSE74811 , GSE29617 , GSE74816 ) ( Barrett et al., 2013 11.

After removing samples and genes with missing values as well as extraordinary vaccine time points, we selected only samples from subjects matching the same age range as the current study: 18 – 45 years of age. The remaining samples were batch corrected using ComBat from the sva package in R (v 3.36.0) with study as batch, no covariates, and otherwise standard settings. Statistical tests were performed using the R base and ComplexHeatmap (v 2.4.3) packages. Test details and statistical cutoffs are reported in the figure legends.
The CellRanger-atac pipeline (v1.1.0) by 10X Genomics was used for alignment (GRCh38 reference genome), de-duplication, and identification of cut sites for each sample. The samples were then combined using the CellRanger-atac aggregation procedure without depth normalization (–normalize = none). The resulting fragment file was read into SnapATAC ( Fang et al., 2020 32. Fang, R. ∙ Preissl, S. ∙ Li, Y. ... SnapATAC: A Comprehensive Analysis Package for Single Cell ATAC-seq bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). SnapATAC was used to bin the genome (bin size of 5K) and create a cell-by-bin count matrix. Cells were identified as barcodes with at latest 1000 UMIs, and a promotor ratio (defined as: (fragments in promoter regions + 1) / (total fragments + 1)) of at least 0.1, resulting in a total of [state total number of cells in each experiment], as stated in the results section. Bins that mapped to chrY, mitochondrial DNA, or bins that overlap with ENCODE blacklist regions ( Amemiya et al., 2019 4. Amemiya, H.M. ∙ Kundaje, A. ∙ Boyle, A.P. The ENCODE Blacklist: Identification of Problematic Regions of the Genome Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :9354 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ), were removed. The remaining bins were used for dimensionality reduction using Truncated SVD with the irlba R package ( Baglama et al., 2019 10. Baglama, J. ∙ Reichel, L. ∙ Lewis, B.W. irlba: Fast Truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Principal Components Analysis for Large Dense and Sparse Matrices CRAN, 2019 Google Scholar ), and the first 50 dimensions were then used for clustering. MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 116. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (6782) PubMed Google Scholar ) was then used to call peaks within each cluster using recommended parameters for ATACseq data ( –nomodel–shift 100–ext 200–qval 5e-2 -B–SPMR ). The cluster-specific peaks were merged to a single combined set. SnapATAC was then used to map the fragments to the combined peaks set and create a peak-by-cell binary matrix. In the H5N1/H5N1+AS03 dataset, deeply-sequenced libraries were downsampled to an average of 1500 fragments per barcode by randomly removing counts from these samples at a probability p = 1500/(mean fragments per cell in the sample). The dimensionality reduction and clustering procedure described above was then repeated on the peak-by-cell matrix. ChromVAR ( Schep et al., 2017 89. Schep, A.N. ∙ Wu, B. ∙ Buenrostro, J.D. ... chromVAR: inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility from single-cell epigenomic data Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :975-978 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used with default parameters and the JASPAR2016 ( Mathelier et al., 2016 66. Mathelier, A. ∙ Fornes, O. ∙ Arenillas, D.J. ... JASPAR 2016: a major expansion and update of the open-access database of transcription factor binding profiles Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D110-D115 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) motif database to calculate motif accessibility scores and compute differentially accessible motifs in the data. Hotspot was used to identify informative gene modules that explain heterogeneity within the monocyte population ( DeTomaso and Yosef, 2020 29. DeTomaso, D. ∙ Yosef, N. Identifying Informative Gene Modules Across Modalities of Single Cell Genomics bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), using the Bernoulli model and the top 2500 regions (ranked by highest autocorrelation z-score) for module calculation. Modules were then identified using the create_modules function, with min_gene_threshold = 200 . Similar modules were manually identified and merged by taking the average score across modules. Differentially accessible regions were identified using logistic regression with the glm function in R with the design: y ∼time point + donor + log_fragments to control for donor and library size effects. The coefficient corresponding to the time point was then used as the logFC value, and a Wald test was used to get p values. For numerical stability, we only included peaks that were detected in at least 5% of the cells included in each comparison. All custom scripts for preprocessing, correlation analysis, and differential accessibility analysis are posted in zenodo [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4446316 ]. The hypergeometric distribution-based enrichment analysis was performed to identify the significance of the DARs (p ≤ 0.05 and detected in at least 5% of cells). Reactome pathways database (both downloaded from https://maayanlab.cloud/chea3/ ) were used to identify overrepresented pathways. Enrichr ( Kuleshov et al., 2016 54. Kuleshov, M.V. ∙ Jones, M.R. ∙ Rouillard, A.D. ... Enrichr: a comprehensive gene set enrichment analysis web server 2016 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :W90-W97 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to conduct enrichment analysis of genomic regions within Hotspot modules 2, 3. Enrichr was also used to conduct enrichment analysis of DARs containing an IRF1 motif. Briefly, significant DARs (p ≤ 0.05 and detected in at least 5% of cells) carrying an IRF1 motif, as determined by chromVAR, were selected. Next, gene names with multiple associated DARs were collapsed in case all DARs changed in the same direction or otherwise discared. Subsequently, gene list was submitted to Enrichr for enrichment using the Reactome_2016 database. Similarly, we used Enrichr together with the ChEA_2016 databases to identify TF target genes enriched in genes that were enhanced after booster vaccination with H5N1+AS03 and that overlapped with changes in accessibility at promoter regions.
The CellRanger pipeline (v3.1.0) by 10X Genomics was used for alignment (GRCh38 reference genome), demultiplexing, cell-calling, and filtering. The filtered count matrices from each sample were then aggregated using the CellRanger aggregation procedure without depth normalization (–normalize = none). The resulting count matrix was analyzed with scVI (scvi-tools v0.7.1) ( Lopez et al., 2018 64. Lopez, R. ∙ Regier, J. ∙ Cole, M.B. ... Deep generative modeling for single-cell transcriptomics Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :1053-1058 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default hyperparameters to fit a low-dimensional latent space, using the experiment annotation for each sample as a batch label for batch correction. Visualization, clustering, and exploratory analyses were performed with VISION (v2.1.0) ( DeTomaso et al., 2019 30. DeTomaso, D. ∙ Jones, M.G. ∙ Subramaniam, M. ... Functional interpretation of single cell similarity maps Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4376 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential expression analysis between time points was performed with edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 86. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (15510) PubMed Google Scholar ) as described in the package documentation, using the exactTest hypothesis testing for each pairwise analysis.
Initial data quality was assessed by background level, 3′ labeling bias, and pairwise correlation among samples via the arrayQualityMetrics package in Bioconductor ( Kauffmann et al., 2009 47. Kauffmann, A. ∙ Gentleman, R. ∙ Huber, W. arrayQualityMetrics--a bioconductor package for quality assessment of microarray data Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :415-416 Crossref Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ). CEL files were normalized via RMA ( Irizarry et al., 2003 44. Irizarry, R.A. ∙ Hobbs, B. ∙ Collin, F. ... Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data Biostatistics. 2003; 4 :249-264 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), which includes global background adjustment and quantile normalization. Probes mapping to multiple genes were discarded, and the remaining probes were collapsed to gene level by selecting the probe for each gene with the highest mean expression across all subjects. Statistical tests were performed in MATLAB and R.
Clinical trials in this study were pre-registered at clinicaltrials.gov : TIV: NCT02154061, H5N1+/−AS03: NCT01910519.
