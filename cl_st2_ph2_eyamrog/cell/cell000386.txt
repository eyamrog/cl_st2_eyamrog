Title: Structural insight into SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and modulation of syncytia


Abstract: Summary

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is initiated by binding of the viral Spike protein to host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by fusion of viral and host membranes. Although antibodies that block this interaction are in emergency use as early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies, the precise determinants of neutralization potency remain unknown. We discovered a series of antibodies that potently block ACE2 binding but exhibit divergent neutralization efficacy against the live virus. Strikingly, these neutralizing antibodies can inhibit or enhance Spike-mediated membrane fusion and formation of syncytia, which are associated with chronic tissue damage in individuals with COVID-19. As revealed by cryoelectron microscopy, multiple structures of Spike-antibody complexes have distinct binding modes that not only block ACE2 binding but also alter the Spike protein conformational cycle triggered by ACE2 binding. We show that stabilization of different Spike conformations leads to modulation of Spike-mediated membrane fusion with profound implications for COVID-19 pathology and immunity.

Section: Introduction

The first step of infection with coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is binding of a Spike protein on the virion to a specific receptor in the membrane of a host cell ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 46. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D. Structural insights into coronavirus entry Rey, F.A. (Editor) Advances in Virus Research Academic Press, 2019; 93-116 Google Scholar ). The virus enters cells by fusion of the viral envelope with cellular plasma membranes and, alternatively, by endocytosis and subsequent fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, similar to that of other CoVs, comprises two subunits, S1 and S2, and is responsible for target recognition and mediating virus entry ( Tortorici and Veesler, 2019 46. Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Veesler, D. Structural insights into coronavirus entry Rey, F.A. (Editor) Advances in Virus Research Academic Press, 2019; 93-116 Google Scholar ). Upon binding to the host cell receptor through the receptor binding domain (RBD) at the tip of the S1 subunit, the Spike protein undergoes dramatic conformational changes and proteolytic processing. Further shedding of the S1 subunit exposes the S2 subunit fusion peptide, which inserts into the host cell membrane and induces viral fusion ( Benton et al., 2020 3.

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor to infect host cells ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 16. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ...

The RBD binds to ACE2 via the receptor binding motif (RBM), a small patch made up of about 20 amino acids ( Lan et al., 2020 22. Lan, J. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Yu, J. ...

In addition to mediating virus entry, excess Spike protein in the membranes of CoV-infected cells drives neighboring cells expressing ACE2 to fuse and form syncytia (multinucleated giant cells) through a pH-independent mechanism ( Musarrat et al., 2020 30.

Syncytia are associated with lung tissue damage in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and have been observed widely in autopsies of individuals afflicted with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ( Bussani et al., 2020 6.

Preliminary reports also implicate syncytia in chronic cardiovascular injury because of COVID-19 ( Schneider et al., 2020 40. Schneider, J. ∙ Pease, D. ∙ Navaratnarajah, C. ...

A common therapeutic strategy against COVID-19 and other CoV-related illnesses is blocking the RBD/ACE2 interaction with antibodies, nanobodies, or soluble ACE2 as a decoy ( Zhou and Zhao, 2020 64.

A number of NAbs in advanced clinical trials have already been used as experimental treatments for COVID-19 ( Hansen et al., 2020 15. Hansen, J. ∙ Baum, A. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Studies in humanized mice and convalescent humans yield a SARS-CoV-2 antibody cocktail Science. 2020; 369 :1010-1014 Crossref Scopus (833) PubMed Google Scholar ), with promising efficacy in individuals with early-stage infection.

Wang, C. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Drabek, D. ... A human monoclonal antibody blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2251 Crossref Scopus (817) PubMed Google Scholar ) may contribute to neutralization, but the molecular mechanisms governing the neutralization potency of NAbs remain poorly understood, and it is unknown whether receptor-blocking NAbs can also influence Spike-mediated cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation.
Neutralizing antibodies against pathogens can also be isolated by in vitro selection from highly diverse combinatorial human libraries ( Frenzel et al., 2017 12.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16 :535-539 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ) and may be distinct from those found with natural infection or immunization ( Saphire et al., 2018 38. Saphire, E.O. ∙ Schendel, S.L. ∙ Fusco, M.L. ..., Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium Systematic analysis of monoclonal antibodies against Ebola virus GP defines features that contribute to protection Cell. 2018; 174 :938-952.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). We screened a naive combinatorial human antibody fragment (Fab) library for antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD and competitively block ACE2 binding. We discovered a series of antibodies that exhibit effective receptor blockade but have strikingly different neutralization potencies against SARS-CoV-2. Taking these antibodies as mechanistic probes, we show that bivalent binding and receptor blockade are not the sole determinants of potent neutralization. In addition to blocking ACE2, these antibodies inhibit or enhance syncytium formation in Vero E6 cells, suggesting that potentiation of cell-cell fusion by antibodies may compromise the effectiveness of virus neutralization in treatment of severe COVID-19. One potently neutralizing and potentially therapeutic antibody, designated 5A6, uniquely inhibits cell-cell fusion and syncytium formation and blocks receptor binding. High-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of multiple Spike-antibody complexes provide insight into determinants of viral neutralization potency and reveal that 5A6 recognizes a cryptic quaternary epitope that conveys receptor blockade and inhibits syncytia by trapping the pre-fusion state.

Section: Results

We identified six antibodies that block the RBD/ACE2 interaction with nanomolar EC 50 (half maximal effective concentration) values by phage display of a naive combinatorial human Fab library comprising 3 × 10 10 random heavy and light immunoglobulin G (IgG) chain pairs drawn from 22 healthy donors ( Goh et al., 2014 14. Goh, A.X. ∙ Bertin-Maghit, S. ∙ Ping Yeo, S. ... A novel human anti-interleukin-1β neutralizing monoclonal antibody showing in vivo efficacy MAbs. 2014; 6 :765-773 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 A; Figure S1 A). Their germlines and degree of hypermutation are given in Table S1 . Although the source Fabs had moderate intrinsic affinities for immobilized RBD, as high as 1.6 nM for 3D11 and 7.6 nM for 5A6, clones reformatted as IgGs showed subpicomolar to picomolar binding avidity ( Figure 1 B; Figures S1 B–S1D). Biolayer interferometry (BLI) of free Fabs and their equivalent IgGs indicates that the greatly enhanced binding of the IgGs is primarily due to slower dissociation, likely because of bivalent binding of both Fab arms to their epitopes ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 ). Stepwise binding BLI assays show that Fabs 5A6 and 3D11 have non-overlapping footprints on the RBD, whereas 5A6 shares at least partially overlapping epitopes with the other four antibodies ( Figure 1 D).
We evaluated the six receptor-blocking antibodies for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-ACE2 cells with a luciferase reporter ( Figure 2 A) and against live SARS-CoV-2 ( Young et al., 2020 59. Young, B.E. ∙ Ong, S.W.X. ∙ Kalimuddin, S. ..., Singapore 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak Research Team Epidemiologic Features and Clinical Course of Patients Infected With SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore JAMA. 2020; 323 :1488-1494 Crossref Scopus (1470) PubMed Google Scholar ) in Vero E6 cells by cell viability ( Figure 2 B). The antibodies neutralize the pseudovirus with IC 50 values ranging from 75.5–428.3 ng/mL, but although neutralization of the live virus is 11- to 20-fold less potent for other antibodies, 5A6 retains similar potency with an IC 50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) value of 140.7 ng/mL (<2-fold weaker). We speculate that this difference in neutralization potency in live virus and pseudovirus assays is most likely due to the non-replicating nature of pseudoviruses, which are more sensitive to blockade of virus entry. We validated live virus neutralization of a subset of antibodies (2H4, 3D11, and 5A6) using qRT-PCR to quantify virus replication ( Figure S2 A) and observed similar trends as obtained from cell viability assays ( Figure 2 B). To more accurately assess the therapeutic potential of 5A6, we studied its neutralizing potency in SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium (HAE) ( Pizzorno et al., 2020 34. Pizzorno, A. ∙ Padey, B. ∙ Julien, T. ... Characterization and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in Nasal and Bronchial Human Airway Epithelia Cell Rep. Med. 2020; 1 :100059 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 replication in HAE was reduced 1,000-fold by 5A6 at 75 ng/mL and 10,000-fold at 150 ng/mL, and 5A6 also helped maintain epithelium integrity (represented by trans -epithelial electrical resistance), supporting its activity in a physiologically relevant in vitro model ( Figure 2 C).
All IgGs effectively block ACE2-RBD binding, with IC 50 values below 50 nM ( Figure S1 A). Therefore, the relative virus neutralization potencies of these antibodies cannot be ascribed to competitive receptor blocking alone. To interrogate other determinants of neutralization, we next compared the potency of each IgG antibody with its respective monomeric Fabs. A bivalent ACE2-Fc fusion protein was included as a reference for multivalent receptor blockade. All antibodies show dramatically increased potency against the live virus compared with the Fab, which is consistent with bivalent engagement of the Spike trimer by IgG compared with the monovalent Fab. The affinity or avidity for the RBD is generally predictive of virus neutralization IC 50 values, with two striking exceptions ( Figure 2 D; Table S2 ). Antibody 5A6 exhibits far greater viral neutralization potency than other antibodies with superior avidity. Conversely, 3D11 is among the least potent regarding virus neutralization despite displaying the strongest binding.
We wanted to find out whether the discrepancy could arise from the differences in the structural arrangement of IgGs bound to the RBDs of intact trimeric Spike on the virion. We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure antibody binding to immobilized Spike trimers as opposed to the immobilized RBD ( Figures S2 B–S2D; Table S2 ). Although the kinetics of binding to the trimer were largely similar, we noted that 5A6 IgG binds somewhat more tightly (3.6×) to the intact trimer than to the flexible Fc-RBD construct used for BLI, whereas 3D11 IgG binds much more weakly (18.7×) but still apparently bivalently, with 21.7× tighter binding than 3D11 Fab. To further investigate the relationship of the antibodies to intact Spike assemblies, we purified the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus by gradient centrifugation and immobilized the viral particles on ELISA plates. The higher optical signal at saturation in concentration-dependent binding curves reveals that 5A6 IgG likely packs with higher density on the virus surface than the other four tested IgG antibodies or 5A6 Fab ( Figure 2 E). It has been proposed that effective virus neutralization requires the antibody packing density to exceed a critical threshold ( Burton et al., 2001 5. Burton, D.R. ∙ Saphire, E.O. ∙ Parren, P.W. A model for neutralization of viruses based on antibody coating of the virion surface Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 260 :109-143 PubMed Google Scholar ; Dowd and Pierson, 2011 10.

Flamand, A. ∙ Raux, H. ∙ Gaudin, Y. ... Mechanisms of rabies virus neutralization Virology. 1993; 194 :302-313 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ), and 5A6 may possess a unique binding mode that accommodates a denser structural arrangement on the virus surface. Notably, 3D11 IgG exhibits a similarly high signal at saturation but with lower affinity for the pseudoviral particles despite having a higher affinity than 5A6 for the immobilized RBD or Spike trimer ( Figure 2 E; Figure S2 ). Finally, the 2H4 and 1F4 IgGs saturate the immobilized pseudovirus at 1/3 the density of 5A6 or 3D11 while neutralizing live virus slightly more effectively than 3D11. These results suggest at least three different classes of receptor-blocking antibodies with distinct structural relationships to RBDs on virus particles.
It is widely appreciated that viral proteins often possess multiple critical functions. With receptor-blocking activity and avid binding eliminated as sole determinants of neutralization by prior experiments, we reasoned that 5A6 might interfere with additional functions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The most prominent example is induction of fusion of infected cells with neighboring cells, leading to formation of syncytia (multinucleated giant cells), a phenomenon known to hasten disease progression in respiratory syncytial virus ( McNamara and Smyth, 2002 29. McNamara, P.S. ∙ Smyth, R.L. The pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus disease in childhood Br. Med. Bull. 2002; 61 :13-28 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ) and human immunodeficiency virus ( Koot et al., 1993 20. Koot, M. ∙ Keet, I.P.M. ∙ Vos, A.H.V. ...

HIV-induced T cell syncytia are self-perpetuating and the primary cause of T cell death in culture J. Immunol. 1997; 158 :3996-4007 PubMed Google Scholar ) and now observed widely in late-stage COVID-19 ( Bussani et al., 2020 6. Bussani, R. ∙ Schneider, E. ∙ Zentilin, L. ... Persistence of viral RNA, pneumocyte syncytia and thrombosis are hallmarks of advanced COVID-19 pathology EBioMedicine. 2020; 61 :103104 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore assessed whether antibodies discovered in our study inhibit Spike-mediated syncytium formation. To directly examine syncytium formation by Spike alone, we expressed the Spike protein with a C-terminal fluorescent tag in Vero E6 cells. Addition of trypsin as an exogenous Spike-processing enzyme resulted in cells with a diffuse fluorescent signal and multiple nuclei, indicative of syncytium formation ( Figure 3 A). We assayed the effect of receptor-blocking antibodies on this trypsin-induced cell-cell fusion using antibodies 2H4, 5A6, and 3D11, which represent different modes of virus neutralization. The 5A6 IgG has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on syncytia ( Figure 3 B). In contrast 2H4 IgG has no significant effect. Surprisingly, 3D11 potentiates cell-cell fusion. Furthermore, 5A6 Fab also enhanced syncytial fusion, albeit weakly ( Figures 3 A and 3B). We conclude that 5A6 IgG directly inhibits Spike-mediated fusion, whereas other receptor-blocking antibodies fail to inhibit or even accelerate this process.
The Spike trimer exists in equilibrium between the closed conformation, with all RBDs nestled closely around the S2 subunit, and “receptor-seeking” states featuring one or more open RBDs that become erect and disengage from the S2 subunit ( Walls et al., 2020 50.

Structural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variant Cell. 2020; 183 :739-751.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ). To provide structural insights into how antibodies targeting different RBD epitopes divergently modulate Spike protein function, we determined structures of the trimeric Spike protein alone ( Figures S3 A and S3B) and in complex with Fabs of 3D11 ( Figures S3 C and S3D), 2H4 ( Figure S3 E), and 5A6 ( Figures S3 F and S3G). Consistent with epitope binning and functional characterization, these Fabs explore different regions of the RBD surface, are compatible with different (open or closed) RBD states in the Spike trimer, and bind with distinct geometries relative to the RBD and ACE2 interface ( Figure 4 ). This form of three-dimensional epitope mapping provides an atomic-level understanding of the determinants of virus inhibition.
We determined multiple structures of 2H4 Fab bound to Spike with a resolution sufficient for unambiguously docking a model of 2H4 but precluding precise modeling of the epitope and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) ( Figure S3 E). Three major conformational states were identified by 3D classification, revealing one, two, or three 2H4 Fabs bound to the Spike trimer. The receptor blocking activity of 2H4 is straightforward because it recognizes an epitope that overlaps much of the ACE2 interface ( Figure 4 A). Binding of the 2H4 Fab is compatible with both major RBD conformations, and the structures are drawn from an ensemble of quaternary states reminiscent of those that follow ACE2 binding and lead to S1 shedding and Spike-mediated membrane fusion ( Benton et al., 2020 3. Benton, D.J. ∙ Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Xu, P. ... Receptor binding and priming of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for membrane fusion Nature. 2020; 588 :327-330 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 B). The first of three predominant states features 2H4 bound to one open RBD, and the other two RBDs are closed. The second state adds a second copy of 2H4 on a closed RBD counterclockwise from the first. Density inspection and 3D variability analysis ( 3DVA ) ( Punjani and Fleet, 2021 35. Punjani, A. ∙ Fleet, D.J. 3D variability analysis: Resolving continuous flexibility and discrete heterogeneity from single particle cryo-EM J. Struct. Biol. 2021; 213 :107702 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ) reveal that the third RBD is primarily open, and a trajectory of opening states correlates with binding the second Fab ( Video S2 ). The final state features three Fabs bound and a strictly open third RBD. This restricted ensemble arises because, when the bound RBD is closed, the Fab incurs clashes with the counterclockwise adjacent RBD that can only be relieved by opening of that RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), even beyond the degree of opening in the triple ACE2 complex with three open RBDs ( Benton et al., 2020 3. Benton, D.J. ∙ Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Xu, P. ... Receptor binding and priming of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for membrane fusion Nature. 2020; 588 :327-330 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 C). These observations suggest that 2H4 directly blocks receptor binding but also acts as a receptor mimetic that admits the same cycle of Spike conformations as ACE2. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV has also been reported to engage in orthosteric receptor mimicry ( Walls et al., 2019 49. Walls, A.C. ∙ Xiong, X. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ... Unexpected Receptor Functional Mimicry Elucidates Activation of Coronavirus Fusion Cell. 2019; 176 :1026-1039.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that activation of fusion-associated conformational changes may be an intrinsic consequence of direct receptor interface binding in betacoronaviruses.

Tour of the Spike:5A6 complex I, related to Figure 4 First, the density map for Spike:5A6 complex I is displayed using a low iso-surface threshold, highlighting the binding geometry. The Spike is shown with RBDs in coral, NTDs in plum, the S2 core in rose brown, and 5A6 Fabs is shown in goldenrod. Next, the map is shown in transparency overlaid on a colored copy of the map with a higher density threshold, revealing high resolution details. The high threshold map is replaced by a ribbon diagram of the complex, employing the same color scheme. Finally, the ribbon diagram is shown embedded in the low resolution Spike:5A6 IgG density.
Video (1.53 MB) Video S2. 3D variability analysis of Spike:2H4 complex, related to Figure 4 3DVA resolves principal components of the variability in single-particle EM data. The movie illustrates the first 3DVA component obtained when data for all Spike:2H4 complexes are processed together. At one extreme of this axis of variability, corresponding to the beginning of the movie, the RBD farthest from the camera is closed, with no Fab density. Its counter-clockwise neighbor (to the left) has a superposition of density for both closed and open conformations. A scan across the 3DVA component then shows that as a 2H4 Fab binds to the closed, far RBD, the neighboring RBD is forced into a super-open conformation, and density for the closed state disappears entirely. Simultaneously, the NTD adjacent to this RBD (left side of frame) relaxes outwards and partially reveals the S2 subunit.
The Spike:3D11 complex is relatively homogeneous, with only one major state ( Figure 4 D), and we determined its structure to ~3.0-Å resolution ( Figure S3 C). All three RBDs are bound to 3D11 Fab in the open conformation, with the Fab making a right angle to the long axis of the RBD, via an epitope exposed only in the open state and outside of the RBM ( Figure 4 A). The epitope partly overlaps those of some other antibodies that bind outside of the RBM ( Liu et al., 2020 25. Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ∙ Yuan, M. ... Cross-Neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 Antibody to a Functionally Conserved Site Is Mediated by Avidity Immunity. 2020; 53 :1272-1280.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yuan et al., 2020 60. Yuan, M. ∙ Wu, N.C. ∙ Zhu, X. ... A highly conserved cryptic epitope in the receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Science. 2020; 368 :630-633 Crossref Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ) but is distinct from those ( Barnes et al., 2020 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (955) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pinto et al., 2020 33. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.-J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ) that bind freely to a closed RBD ( Figure S4 D). Clashes between 3D11 and Spike NTDs also prevent 3D11 binding to closed RBDs, indicating that 3D11 binds only to open RBDs. This restriction of binding to the subset of Spike conformations with open RBDs might account for lessened avidity of 3D11 IgG for the intact Spike trimer compared with the RBD ( Figure S2 D). 3D classification reveals outward motions of the NTD and variation in Fab occupancy, but only open RBDs are observed ( Figure S4 A). As for 2H4, the 3D11-bound RBDs are “more open” (displaced further outward) than those in the triple ACE2 complex ( Figure 4 E).
Although its epitope does not significantly overlap with the ACE2-RBD interface, 3D11 nevertheless effectively blocks ACE2 binding and stabilizes a quaternary state of the Spike, with three open RBDs and NTDs, that closely resembles the penultimate stage of ACE2-induced Spike opening ( Benton et al., 2020 3. Benton, D.J. ∙ Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Xu, P. ... Receptor binding and priming of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for membrane fusion Nature. 2020; 588 :327-330 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore call 3D11 an allosteric receptor-mimetic antibody that does not directly target the ACE2 interface but prevents ACE2 binding and enhances Spike-mediated fusion by rapidly advancing the Spike conformational cycle to its final stages.
Multiple states of the Spike:5A6 complex were resolved to better than 3.0 Å, with local resolution sufficient for accurate modeling of the Fab-RBD interface ( Figure S3 G). 5A6 recognizes surface loops near the tip of the RBD, which are solvent exposed even when all RBDs are closed. The binding geometry is permissive for any trimer configuration and any stoichiometry without steric constraints from Spike or Fab. Despite this complete conformational freedom, all 5A6 complexes feature at least two 5A6 Fabs bound to an open RBD counterclockwise adjacent in turn from a closed RBD ( Figure 4 F). The hallmark of these states is a cryptic quaternary epitope in which a region of the Fab V L domain makes a second interaction with an adjacent open RBD ( Figure 4 G). This new interaction is not possible with a closed RBD and requires an adjustment away from the average positions of open RBDs in other structures ( Figure S4 B). The closed RBD bound via the main 5A6 interface is also displaced from other closed conformations.
CDR loops H1, H2, H3, and L1 engage the canonical epitope with a buried surface area of 850 Å 2 ( Figure 5 A). Partial overlap of the RBM and Fab interface and a clash induced between ACE2 and the Fab V L domain, are likely sufficient to exclude ACE2 from the RBD. The second interaction contributes an additional 363 Å 2 ( Figure 5 B), and the C H1 and C L domains of 5A6 at the cryptic quaternary epitope induce an even more severe clash with ACE2 ( Figure 4 G). Two Fabs thus act synergistically to block ACE2 binding, whereas one Fab is capable of blocking ACE2 at two RBDs simultaneously. The secondary interface must be released for the bound RBD to open, and we hypothesize that 5A6 at its quaternary epitope locks one RBD closed, arresting the trimer in its pre-fusion state. Precise conservation of the binding mode and the cryptic quaternary epitope from free Fab to IgG is confirmed by a structure of 5A6 IgG complexed with the Spike trimer at ~15-Å resolution ( Figure 5 C). Although the Fc domain is not well resolved because of the flexibility of the hinge region, the structures suggest that 5A6 IgG may bind to two RBDs from the same trimer ( Figure S4 C) and shows that no steric effects preclude binding of three IgGs at sufficient concentration. Noting the weak potentiation of syncytium formation by 5A6 Fab, we deduce that the cryptic epitope likely appears following initial Fab binding and leads to cooperative action against SARS-CoV-2 by imbuing a second binding event with enhanced affinity and receptor blockade. We also conclude that the geometry of the quaternary epitope and avidity of 5A6 IgG drive robust pre-fusion conformational trapping and potent inhibition of Spike-mediated fusion and syncytium formation.

Section: Discussion

Receptor engagement to a Spike RBD locks it in the open conformation and triggers a cooperative process in which the Spike conformational ensemble is driven toward further opening by successive rounds of receptor binding ( Benton et al., 2020 3. Benton, D.J. ∙ Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Xu, P. ... Receptor binding and priming of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for membrane fusion Nature. 2020; 588 :327-330 Crossref Scopus (514) PubMed Google Scholar ). The process culminates in unsheathing of the S2 subunit and, following proteolytic cleavage, shedding of the S1-ACE2 subcomplex. S1 shedding, in turn, facilitates the post-fusion state transition, leading to membrane fusion and virus entry. The Spike protein on the surface of infected cells can also mediate ACE2-dependent fusion of neighboring cells to form multinucleated giant cells, presumably through the same cycle of proteolysis and conformational transitions. Genetic variation in Spike, in and outside of the RBM, can influence function by altering the conformational equilibrium of the trimer, as seen for the D614G variant, which more readily populates states with multiple open RBDs ( Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020 61. Yurkovetskiy, L. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Structural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variant Cell. 2020; 183 :739-751.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ) and exhibits heightened infectivity ( Korber et al., 2020 21. Korber, B. ∙ Fischer, W.M. ∙ Gnanakaran, S. ..., Sheffield COVID-19 Genomics Group Tracking Changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike: Evidence that D614G Increases Infectivity of the COVID-19 Virus Cell. 2020; 182 :812-827.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2715) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We identified six receptor-blocking antibodies that exhibit differences in avidity, binding mode, and neutralization of the live virus despite the fact that all of them have similarly high affinities for the RBD of the viral Spike protein. Strikingly, one highly potent neutralizing antibody inhibits Spike-mediated syncytium formation, whereas another, more weakly neutralizing antibody actually potentiates cell-cell fusion. These findings suggest that the potential effectiveness of a neutralizing antibody is influenced by a number of possibly countervailing factors, highlighting a complex basis for viral neutralization potency, contra a simplistic view where receptor blocking and affinity enhancement through avidity are the sole determinants of viral neutralization. Cryo-EM structures reveal the conformational landscapes of three Spike-Fab complexes and provide 3D mapping of antibody-Spike epitopes, from which we can draw mechanistic insights that explain their distinct bioactivities in terms of the known intermediates in Spike opening ( Figure 6 ). Certain receptor-blocking antibodies, such as 2H4, may function as orthosteric receptor mimetics conducive to the same cooperative processes as receptor binding. Another class of antibodies, exemplified by 3D11, act as allosteric effectors that advance the Spike directly to the final stages of S2 unsheathing. In contrast, 5A6 possesses a unique binding mode that stabilizes a Spike conformation that prohibits S1 shedding and traps the pre-fusion state. We hypothesize that synergy between receptor blockade and pre-fusion trapping allows 5A6 to prevent targeted viral fusion and Spike-mediated cell-cell fusion.
Directly comparing the monovalent Fabs and bivalent IgGs also provides insight into the nature of avidity. The magnitude of binding and neutralization enhancement in the IgG format supports bivalent binding for all six antibodies ( Vauquelin and Charlton, 2013 48. Vauquelin, G. ∙ Charlton, S.J. Exploring avidity: understanding the potential gains in functional affinity and target residence time of bivalent and heterobivalent ligands Br. J. Pharmacol. 2013; 168 :1771-1785 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). This result may be counterintuitive because modeling studies suggest that the hinge linking IgG Fc and Fab domains may have difficulty bridging the gaps seen in our structures of Spike:Fab complexes ( Figure S4 C). On the other hand, our structure of the 5A6 IgG complex confirms that 5A6 Fab and IgG forms do bind with congruent geometries, and a morph between 5A6 Fab bound to closed and open RBDs shows that shorter distances between Fabs do obtain for intermediate RBD conformations ( Video S3 ). These results may imply that high-affinity bivalent binding to intermediate RBD conformations is replaced by high-density monovalent binding as the concentration of 5A6 IgG increases. In contrast to 5A6, 3D11 and 2H4 Spike:IgG complexes were not tractable for single-particle cryo-EM ( Figure S4 E). Qualitative image analysis suggests that these species do not trap defined conformational states of the Spike trimer, and that 3D11 in particular may achieve virus neutralization by destabilizing the Spike, as does the CR3022 antibody with a similar epitope ( Huo et al., 2020 18. Huo, J. ∙ Zhao, Y. ∙ Ren, J. ... Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by Destruction of the Prefusion Spike Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 :445-454.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intriguingly, we found that 3D11 has greatly reduced potency against the pseudovirus bearing D614G Spike, whereas that of 5A6 is slightly improved, although position 614 is outside of the RBD and far from the epitope of either antibody in the RBD ( Figure S6 ). The D614G mutant Spike is known to occupy states with multiple open RBDs ( Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020 61. Yurkovetskiy, L. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Pascal, K.E. ... Structural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variant Cell. 2020; 183 :739-751.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ) and has been found to shed the S1 subunit less readily than the original SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ( Zhang et al., 2020 62. Zhang, L. ∙ Jackson, C.B. ∙ Mou, H. ... SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein D614G mutation increases virion spike density and infectivity Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :6013 Crossref Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ). We can thus understand altered neutralization of D614G pseudovirus by 3D11 and 5A6 in terms of the model in Figure 6 because the effects of both antibodies are mediated by open RBD conformations that represent immediately available binding sites for 3D11 and present the full quaternary epitope of 5A6. The reduced S1 shedding of the more stable D614G Spike may also assist with the pre-fusion trapping activity of 5A6 while conveying resistance against trimer denaturation by 3D11.
Video (3.94 MB) Video S3. Morph between 5A6 complexed with closed or open RBDs, related to Figure 4 The structure of Spike:5A6 Complex I was used to model the transition from closed to open RBD conformations when 5A6 is bound to two adjacent Spike monomers. Monitoring the distance between the C-terminii of the two 5A6 heavy chains throughout the animation reveals that the Fabs are closest in a putative intermediate RBD conformation. The nearest approach is approximately 80 Å, a gap that can likely be spanned via the flexibility of Fab elbows and the IgG hinge region.
The quaternary epitope recognized by 5A6 conveys cooperative binding as well as avidity, and both aspects may hinder virus escape via mutations in Spike protein ( Barnes et al., 2020 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ... SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody structures inform therapeutic strategies Nature. 2020; 588 :682-687 Crossref Scopus (955) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, our work establishes a platform for exploring allosteric control surfaces across the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Although we employ syncytium formation as a general model for Spike protein function, pre-fusion trapping by 5A6 may convey greater efficacy against late-stage or severe illness because of the role of syncytia in COVID-19 pathology ( Bussani et al., 2020 6. Bussani, R. ∙ Schneider, E. ∙ Zentilin, L. ... Persistence of viral RNA, pneumocyte syncytia and thrombosis are hallmarks of advanced COVID-19 pathology EBioMedicine. 2020; 61 :103104 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, cell-cell fusion during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection also leads to severe tissue damage, and the therapeutic antibody palivizumab is known to trap a pre-fusion state of the fusogenic F protein of RSV ( Huang et al., 2010 17. Huang, K. ∙ Incognito, L. ∙ Cheng, X. ... Respiratory syncytial virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies motavizumab and palivizumab inhibit fusion J. Virol. 2010; 84 :8132-8140 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Uncovering the particular modes of action and functional consequences of Spike binders in general may deepen our understanding of avidity, virus neutralization, and disruption of syncytium formation and play a role in development of therapeutic agents or vaccines during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite providing structural insights into Spike function in mediating cell-cell fusion, our study does not address how antibodies may influence specific biochemical events preceding fusion, such as proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, a number of Spike sequences with mutations in addition to D614G have now been reported, and the specific interplay between Spike sequence variation and the conformational changes elicited by antibody binding still remains to be understood.

In both rounds of biopanning, biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-mFc protein (Sino Biological, Cat#40592-V05H) was immobilized on M280 streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Life Technologies, Cat#11205D); 3.5 × 10 12 cfu phage in 1ml 1% casein-PBS blocking buffer was used in the first round, and 1.64 × 10 11 cfu phage were used in the second round. During the biopanning process, binders to mouse Fc were removed by pre-incubation of phage with 2 μM mouse IgG before mixing with the RBD-mFc antigen. After two rounds of biopanning, the Fabs of selected clones were expressed in E. coli HB2151 cells (Stratagene) to screen for RBD binders by ELISA. Unique clones were identified by DNA sequencing.
Fabs were reformatted into human IgG in the pTT5 vector (National Research Council of Canada) and the IgG antibodies were expressed using ExpiCHO expression system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by transient co-transfection of plasmids expressing the heavy and light chain of each antibody clone. Eight days after transfection, ExpiCHO-S cell suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and filtered with 0.22 μm filter to remove the cells and debris. Antibodies were then purified from the culture supernatant using Protein G Agarose (Merck Millipore, Cat#16-266) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After elution, the purified antibodies were dialyzed at 4°C for 4-20 hours against 1x PBS, for 3 times and concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml using 10MWCO Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius, Cat#VS2001).
The tag-less Fab fragments were produced using the ExpiCHO transient expression system. Eight days after transfection, ExpiCHO-S cell suspension was centrifuged and filtered; and Fab was purified from the filtered culture supernatant using cation exchange chromatography (CIEX) on AKTA FPLC System (GE Healthcare). In brief, the supernatant was concentrated to 2 mL using 10MWCO Vivaspin 20 (Sartorius), diluted 1:20 in Buffer A (20 mM Sodium Acetate, pH 5.2), filtered through 0.22 μm filter, and loaded onto Mono-S 5/50 GL column at a flow rate of 1ml/min. Fab fragments were eluted in Buffer B (20 mM Sodium Acetate, pH 5.2 with 1 M Sodium Chloride) with a sequential linear gradient of 0% to 5% in 5 min, 5% to 15% in 30 min, and 15% to 100% in 20 min of Buffer B injection at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The resulting purified Fab fragments were dialyzed at 4°C for 4-20 hours against 4 l of 20 mM Histidine, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6.6, for 3 times and concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml using 10MWCO Vivaspin 6 (Sartorius, Cat#VS0601).
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgG antibodies were tested in an ELISA against biotinylated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD-mFc (Sino Biological, Cat#40592-V05H) to assess binding avidity for the target. In brief, NeutrAvidin protein (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#31000) was coated at 5 μg/ml onto 96-well ELISA plates in coating buffer (8.4 g/L NaHCO 3 , 3.56 g/L Na 2 CO 3 , pH 9.5) overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 1% Casein (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A37528) for two hours, biotinylated antigen at 0.2 μg/ml was added to the plates and captured by NeutrAvidin during one-hour incubation at room temperature. After washing with 0.05% PBST for 5 times, the IgG antibodies were added at different concentrations with 3-fold dilutions in triplicate and incubated for one hour. The wells were then washed again with 0.05% PBST, followed by addition of HRP conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (1:3000, JACKSON ImmunoResearch, Cat#109-036-098). Finally, the wells were washed and the HRP activity was measured at 450 nm with addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Surmodics, BioFX®, Cat#TMBW-1000-01).
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgG or Fab antibodies were tested in an ELISA against iodixanol-gradient-purified SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with an isotype IgG used as a negative control antibody. In brief, 1 μg/ml of pseudoviral particles were coated in coating buffer onto 96-well ELISA plates overnight at 4°C. After blocking with 1% Casein (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A37528) for two hours, serially diluted IgG or Fab antibodies starting from 20 nM (IgG) or 300 nM (Fab) with five-fold dilutions were added to the plates and incubated for an hour at room temperature. The wells were then washed again with 0.05% PBST, followed by addition of HRP conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (JACKSON ImmunoResearch, Cat#109-036-098) or HRP conjugated anti-human Fab antibody (JACKSON ImmunoResearch, Cat#109-036-097) for one-hour incubation before HRP activity was measured at 450 nm with addition of TMB substrate (Surmodics, BioFX®, Cat#TMBW-1000-01).
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgG antibodies were tested in a competition ELISA to assess their ability to block the Spike protein RBD from binding to human ACE2 protein. In brief, the recombinant human ACE2 protein with a human Fc tag (ACE2-Fc) was coated onto the 96-well ELISA plates in coating buffer overnight at 4°C and blocked with 1% Casein. Then different concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgG antibodies were pre-incubated with 0.5 nM biotinylated Spike protein RBD-mFc (Sino Biological, Cat#40592-V05H) for one hour at room temperature before they were added to the ELISA plates coated with ACE2-Fc. After one-hour incubation, the wells were washed with 0.05% PBST for five times and HRP conjugated streptavidin (Biolegend, Cat#405210) was added at a dilution of 1:3000, and incubated for another one hour before HRP activity was measured at 450 nm with addition of TMB substrate (Surmodics, BioFX®, Cat#TMBW-1000-01).
Digestion reaction for each IgG was prepared using immobilized FabALACTICA microspin columns (Genovis). 100 μL of IgG at 5 mg/mL concentration in digestion buffer (150 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0) were incubated overnight on each column. Digested sample was further purified using a HiTrap Protein L column followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 10/300 GL) using an Äkta Pure FPLC (GE Healthcare).
The expression plasmid containing the prefusion S ectodomain as used in Wrapp et al. (2020b) 56. Wrapp, D. ∙ Wang, N. ∙ Corbett, K.S. ... Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar was kindly provided by Prof. Jason McLellan (University of Texas at Austin). This construct was used to transiently transfect high-density Chinese Hamster Ovary (ExpiCHO) cells with ExpiFectamine per the “Max Titer” protocol provided (Thermo Fisher). Six days post-transfection, 0.2 μm-filtered supernatant was collected and incubated with Ni-Sepharose Excel (Cytiva Life Sciences) for batch purification. Eluate was collected, concentrated in a 50 MWCO Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit (MilliporeSigma), and injected onto a Superose6 10/300 GL column equilibrated in 10 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 to isolate trimeric, monodisperse material for Fab/IgG complexing.
2.5 μL of Spike-Fab complex at a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL was applied to a 300 mesh gold Quantifoil 1.2/1.3 holey carbon grid that was glow discharged for 30 s at 15 mA immediately before sample application. Grids were blotted using Whatman #1 filter paper for 8 or 10 s at a blot force of 0 at 4°C and 100% humidity using a Mark IV Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) and plunge frozen into liquid ethane. Samples were loaded onto a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) and a Quantum GIF energy filter (Gatan) operated with a 20 eV slit width during image acquisition. The K3 camera was operated in CDS mode using super resolution. A nominal magnification of 105,000x was used, for a pixel size of 0.835 Å (0.4175 Å super resolution pixel size) at the sample. A dose rate of 8 e - /(pix · sec), or 11.5 e - /(Å 2 · sec), and a frame rate of 0.05 s/frame was used with a total exposure time of 5.9 s, for a total dose of 67.7 e - /Å 2 . Automated data collection was performed using SerialEM ( Mastronarde, 2005 28. Mastronarde, D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152 :36-51 Crossref Scopus (3089) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Dose-weighted, motion-corrected sums down-sampled to the physical pixel size were obtained from the super-resolution DED movies using UCSF Motioncor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 63. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.-P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4285) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the Spike trimer, CTF estimation was performed in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 36. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (3666) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by blob-based particle picking, 2D classification, ab initio modeling, 3D classification, and 3D refinement. For images of antibody complexes, particles were instead picked using templates generated from the apo trimer structure, and the apo trimer was likewise used as an initial model in 3D classification. The resolution of the interface between the Spike RBD and the 5A6 Fab was further improved using naive focused refinements. Additional 3D classification of the Spike:3D11 complex was performed in Relion 3.1 ( Scheres, 2012 39. Scheres, S.H.W. A Bayesian view on cryo-EM structure determination J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415 :406-418 Crossref Scopus (585) PubMed Google Scholar ). Processing details are given in Table S3 and Figure S5 .
For each Spike:Fab complex, a previously determined structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, along with a full-length Fab homology model computed by MODELER ( Webb and Sali, 2016 53. Webb, B. ∙ Sali, A. Comparative Protein Structure Modeling Using MODELLER Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2016; 54 :5.6.1-5.6.37 Crossref Scopus (1855) PubMed Google Scholar ), were simultaneously docked into cryo-EM density using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 32. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (32513) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spike with one open RBD and one copy of ACE2 bound (PDB: 7a94 ) was used with 5A6, Spike with three open RBDs and three copies of ACE2 bound (PDB: 7a98 ) was used with 3D11, and Spike with two open RBDs and one copy of ACE2 bound (PDB: 7a95 ) was used with 2H4. Missing segments and side chains in the RBDs were built using Coot. Interactive, density-restrained molecular dynamics simulations in ChimeraX ( Goddard et al., 2018 13. Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ∙ Meng, E.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: Meeting modern challenges in visualization and analysis Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :14-25 Crossref Scopus (2401) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ISOLDE ( Croll, 2018 9. Croll, T.I. ISOLDE: a physically realistic environment for model building into low-resolution electron-density maps Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (695) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to finalize the models, and atomic b-factors were calculated using PHENIX ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1393) PubMed Google Scholar ). Models for the Spike:5A6 and Spike:3D11 complexes were first built into density maps from whole-particle cryo-EM reconstructions, and then further refined using maps from focused refinements of the Fab and Spike RBD. Maps of Spike:2H4 complexes were of lower resolution and model building was terminated after the docking step described above. Model statistics and density fit information are presented in Table S3 and Figure S5 .
Pseudotyped viral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were produced by transfecting of 30 million 293T cells with 12 μg pMDLg/pRRE (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene #12251), 6 μg pRSV-Rev (a gift from Didier Trono, Addgene #12253), 24 μg pHIV-Luc-ZsGreen (a gift from Bryan Welm, Addgene #39196) and 12 μg pTT5LnX-CoV-SP (expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, GenBank: YP_009724390.1 , a kind gift from DSO National Laboratories) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Cat#11668-019). The transfected cells were cultured at 37°C incubator for 3 days. Viral supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 700 g for 10min to remove cell debris and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter unit (Sartorius, Cat#16555). Lenti-X p24 rapid titer kit (Takara Bio, Cat#632200) was used to quantify the viral titers following the manufacturer instructions. pTT5LnX-CoV-SP plasmid with D614G mutation was generated using QuickChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Cat#210513) and was used to generate mutant pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein carrying D614G mutation.
To concentrate and purify the pseudovirus particles expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, pre-cleared 40 mL viral supernatant was concentrated by 20% sucrose gradient centrifugation at 10,000 g for 4 hours at 4°C in an SW41 Ti rotor with no brake. Upon removal of supernatant, 1mL of PBS was added to the virus pellet and left at 4°C overnight. Concentrated virus was further purified by an OptiPrep (60% [wt/vol] iodixanol, STEMCELL Technologies, Cat#07820) velocity gradient. Iodixanol gradients were prepared in PBS in 1.2% increments ranging from 6 to 18%. Pseudoviruses were layered onto the top of the gradient and centrifuged for 1.5 hours at 200,000 g in an SW41 Ti rotor. Gradient fraction that contained pseudovirus pellet was collected.
CHO-ACE2 cells were seeded at a density of 3.2 × 10 4 cells in 100 μL of complete medium without Geneticin in 96-well Flat Clear Bottom Black Polystyrene TC-treated Microplates (Corning, Cat#3904). Serially diluted IgG or Fab antibodies were incubated in a 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plate (Costar, Cat#3596) with an equal volume of pseudovirus (12 ng of p24) at the final volume of 50 μL at 37°C for one hour, and the mixture was added to the monolayer of pre-seeded CHO-ACE2 cells in triplicate. After one hour of pseudovirus infection at 37°C, 150 μl of culture medium was added to each well and the cells were further incubated for another 48 hours. Upon removal of culture medium, cells were washed twice with sterile PBS, and then lysed in 20 μL of 1x Passive lysis buffer (Promega, Cat#E1941) with gentle shaking at 37°C for 30 minutes. Luciferase activity was then assessed using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Cat#E1510) on a Promega GloMax Luminometer. The relative luciferase units (RLU) were converted to percent neutralization and plotted with a non-linear regression curve fit using GraphPad PRISM.
The potency of the IgG or Fab antibodies were determined in neutralizing live SARS-CoV-2 virus assays. In brief, 25 μl of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 live virus (isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab of a patient in Singapore) was mixed with an equal volume of serially diluted IgG or Fab antibodies and incubated at 37°C for one hour before the mixture was added to 50 μl of Vero E6 C1008 cells in suspension. The infected cells were incubated at 37°C incubator for four days and the cell viability was determined using Viral ToxGloTM Assay (Promega, Cat#G8941). The potency of 2H4, 3D11 and 5A6 IgG antibodies in neutralizing live SARS-CoV-2 virus assays was also determined by measuring the viral genome copy number (GCN). 25 μl of 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 live virus (isolated from a nasopharyngeal swab of a patient in Singapore) was mixed with an equal volume of serially diluted 2H4, 3D11 or 5A6 IgG antibodies and incubated at 37°C for one hour before the mixture was added to 50 μl of 4x10 5 Vero E6 C1008 cells in suspension. The infected cells were incubated at 37°C incubator for 48 hr after which supernatant was harvested and viral GCN was determined by subsequent RT-qPCR targeting the N gene using the RESOLUTE 2.0 kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2.5 μl of supernatant was diluted with 2.5 μl of Milli-Q water and added to 20 μl of RT-PCR master mix. PCR was carried out as follows: reverse transcription at 55°C for 15min, inactivation at 95°C for 4min, followed by 45 cycles of amplification consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 3 s and annealing/extension at 62°C for 30 s and GCN values determined by comparing Ct values against a logGCN standard curve.
The potency of 5A6 IgG was tested in neutralizing a live virus strain (BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020) using MucilAirTM HAE (human airway epithelia) model. Briefly, the apical poles of HAE were gently washed twice with warm Opti-MEM medium (GIBCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and then infected directly with a 150 μL dilution of live SARS-CoV-2 virus strain (BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020) in Opti-MEM medium, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Viral suspensions were pre-incubated for 60 min with antibody 5A6 IgG (75 ng/ml or 150 ng/ml) or an anti-Ebola glycoprotein control antibody (150 ng/ml) before infection. A control infection was performed in absence of antibody. For mock infection, the same procedure was followed using Opti-MEM as inoculum. Viral replication was quantified as the measured copy number of the viral genomes inside, and at the apical poles of, nasal and bronchial HAE. Samples collected from apical washes at 48 hours post-infection were separated into 2 tubes: one for TCID50 viral titration (stored at −80°C) and one for RT-qPCR. HAE cells were harvested in RLT buffer (QIAGEN) and total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) for subsequent RT-qPCR. Primer and probe sequences targeting the ORF1b-nsp14 (forward primer HKU-ORF1b-nsp14F: 5′-TGGGGYTTTACRGGTAACCT-3′; reverse primer HKU-ORF1b-nsp14R: 5′-AACRCGCTTAACAAAGCACTC-3′; probe HKU-ORF1b-nsp141P: 5′-FAM-TAGTTGTGATGCWATCATGACTAG-TAMRA-3′) were selected from those designed by the School of Public Health/University of Hong Kong (Leo Poon, Daniel Chu and Malik Peiris) and synthetized by Eurogentec. Real-time one-step RT-qPCR was performed using the EXPRESS One-Step Superscript qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Cat#1178101K). Variations in trans epithelial electrical resistance (ΔTEER) were measured using a dedicated volt-ohm meter (EVOM2, Epithelial Volt/Ohm Meter for TEER) and expressed as Ohm/cm2.
Vero E6 cells were transfected with S protein bearing furin recognition mutation (R682RAR to A682AAR) with C-terminal GFP tag by Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) and were cultured on μ-Slide 8 well chamber slides (Ibidi, Cat#80826). The transfection efficiency was monitored by percentage of GFP positive cells and optimized within 15%–30% to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio in the following cell-cell fusion assay. After 48 hours, cells were treated with various antibodies diluted in DMEM without FBS for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then treated with 15 μg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37°C for another 2 hours. After trypsin treatment, cells were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 mins and the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were taken by Olympus confocal microscope.
Binding affinity of purified Fab to RBD was measured on the Octet96Red system (ForteBio). Anti-human IgG Fc (AHC) sensors were first loaded with 1 μg/ml of Fc-RBD for 10 min, followed by kinetics buffer (phosphate-buffered saline buffer supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA) for 5 min to establish a stable baseline. The sensors were then dipped into different concentrations of each Fab from 100 nM to 3.125 nM in two-fold dilutions for 6 min, and then in kinetics buffer again for 10 min to measure association and dissociation. Assays were run at 25°C and data was analyzed on the Octet System Data Acquisition Software version 9.0.0.4. using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
Avidity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD IgG antibodies for RBD was measured on the Octet96Red system. Anti-hIgG Fc capture (AHC) sensors were used. The sensors were loaded with 1 μg/ml of Fc-RBD (made in-house) in assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline buffer supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.1% BSA) for 10 min, quenched in 0.5 mg/ml of isotype IgG in assay buffer for 10 min, then dipped in assay buffer for 12 min for the system to stabilize. To measure the association of 5A6, the sensors were dipped in a range of 5A6 IgG concentrations (25-0.39 nM in 2-fold serial dilutions) in assay buffer for 6 min. To measure dissociation, the sensors were dipped in assay buffer for 10 min. The experiment was conducted at 25°C. Data analysis was done in the Octet System Data Acquisition Software version 9.0.0.4. using the 1:2 bivalent model.
Epitope binning was done using a classical sandwich assay. The AR2G sensor tips (ForteBio) were activated in freshly prepared 20mM EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride), 10mM NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) solution and the 5A6 antibody was immobilized to the sensor tips using a concentration of 7.5 μg/ml of 5A6 in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 6 buffer. After quenching in 1M ethanolamine, the 5A6-immobilized sensor tips were dipped in 5 μg/ml of tagless RBD for 600 s, then in 10μg/ml of the second antibody for 300 s. The assay was run at 25°C. Sensor tips were regenerated in 10 mM glycine at pH 2.7 and neutralized in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 before another cycle of sandwich assay was performed. Each sensor tip was used in a total of 3 cycles. Data analysis was done in the Octet System Data Acquisition Software version 9.0.0.4.
StreptagII-tagged prefusion S ectodomain, diluted to 10 μg/mL in 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% PS-20, pH 7.4, was captured on a StreptactinXT-immobilized (Iba Life Sciences) CM5 Series S sensor chip at an average level of 224 or 347 RU (response units) for IgG and Fab kinetics measurements, respectively using a Biacore T200 (Cytiva Life Sciences). 2-fold serial dilutions of purified IgG from 12.5 nM to 0.39 nM or Fab from 100 nM to 3.125 nM were flowed over the captured prefusion S ectodomain at 30 μL/minute for 90 s followed by 420 s of dissociation flow. Following each cycle, the chip surface was regenerated with 3 M guanidine hydrochloride. The resulting reference flow cell and blank-injection subtracted sensorgrams were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model using the Biacore T200 Evaluation Software (Cytiva Life Sciences).
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 7.03. Statistical tests are indicated in the figure legends. EC 50 values were calculated by non-linear regression analysis on the binding curves using GraphPad Prism and IC 50 values were calculated either using the [Inhibitor] versus response variable slope four parameter non-linear regression model of GraphPad Prism, or the four parameter logistic regression model in the Quest Graph IC 50 Calculator from AAT Bioquest, Inc ( https://www.aatbio.com/tools/ic50-calculator ). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare differences between groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at confidence levels ∗ p < 0.05 or ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001.
