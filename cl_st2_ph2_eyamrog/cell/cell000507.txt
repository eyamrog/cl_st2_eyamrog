Title: Microenvironment drives cell state, plasticity, and drug response in pancreatic cancer


Abstract: Summary

Prognostically relevant RNA expression states exist in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), but our understanding of their drivers, stability, and relationship to therapeutic response is limited. To examine these attributes systematically, we profiled metastatic biopsies and matched organoid models at single-cell resolution. In vivo , we identify a new intermediate PDAC transcriptional cell state and uncover distinct site- and state-specific tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Benchmarking models against this reference map, we reveal strong culture-specific biases in cancer cell transcriptional state representation driven by altered TME signals. We restore expression state heterogeneity by adding back in vivo -relevant factors and show plasticity in culture models. Further, we prove that non-genetic modulation of cell state can strongly influence drug responses, uncovering state-specific vulnerabilities. This work provides a broadly applicable framework for aligning cell states across in vivo and ex vivo settings, identifying drivers of transcriptional plasticity and manipulating cell state to target associated vulnerabilities.

Section: Introduction

Recent advances in high-throughput genomic sequencing have led to a detailed understanding of the genetic alterations that underlie human tumors ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 27. Garraway, L.A. ∙ Lander, E.S. Lessons from the cancer genome Cell. 2013; 153 :17-37 Google Scholar ). These reference maps have driven a “mutation-centric” view of cancer that informs our current approach to precision medicine. In this framework, DNA alterations are used as biomarkers to guide therapy selection ( Hyman et al., 2017 41. Hyman, D.M. ∙ Taylor, B.S. ∙ Baselga, J. Implementing Genome-Driven Oncology Cell. 2017; 168 :584-599 Google Scholar ), and ex vivo models are used to validate mutational associations and power therapeutic discovery efforts. To maintain translational relevance, the fidelity of ex vivo models to in vivo attributes is paramount.
Driven by the mutation-centric view of cancer, model fidelity is typically assessed via genomic similarity ( Ben-David et al., 2019 9. Ben-David, U. ∙ Beroukhim, R. ∙ Golub, T.R.

Natl. Cancer Inst. 2013; 105 :452-458 Google Scholar ). Assessment of mutational fidelity is feasible and useful for two reasons: first, bulk measurements of DNA alterations have favorable signal-to-noise profiles (i.e., somatic mutations are present or absent); and, second, some cancers respond to therapies in a genotype-directed manner ( Garraway and Lander, 2013 27. Garraway, L.A. ∙ Lander, E.S. Lessons from the cancer genome Cell. 2013; 153 :17-37 Google Scholar ; Hyman et al., 2017 41. Hyman, D.M. ∙ Taylor, B.S. ∙ Baselga, J. Implementing Genome-Driven Oncology Cell. 2017; 168 :584-599 Google Scholar ). However, a growing body of evidence indicates that using mutations alone to assign therapies has limitations ( Nam et al., 2021 51. Nam, A.S. ∙ Chaligne, R. ∙ Landau, D.A. Integrating genetic and non-genetic determinants of cancer evolution by single-cell multi-omics Nat. Rev.

Limited evolution of the actionable metastatic cancer genome under therapeutic pressure Nat. Med. 2021; 27 :1553-1563 Google Scholar ). The advent of single-cell genomic technologies has confirmed extensive mutational heterogeneity in human tumors but also revealed that the complexity of cancer extends to variation in cell transcriptional state. The relationship between cell state and therapeutic sensitivity represents a new but poorly understood opportunity for cancer therapeutic development ( Hahn et al., 2021 34. Hahn, W.C. ∙ Bader, J.S. ∙ Braun, T.P. ..., Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network An expanded universe of cancer targets Cell. 2021; 184 :1142-1155 Google Scholar ).
Cell state, as measured by RNA expression, is a complex representation of tumor phenotype because it integrates inputs from cell-intrinsic (e.g., mutational background, epigenetic state) and cell-extrinsic (e.g., cell-to-cell interactions, tissue architecture) sources. Although the field has generated high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) maps of cancer cell transcriptional states across diverse contexts ( Filbin et al., 2018 24.

Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the degree to which models accurately recapitulate the distribution of cancer cell states seen in patients.
Despite extensive genomic characterization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), most cancers do not harbor therapeutically tractable alterations ( Aguirre et al., 2018 2.

Organoid Profiling Identifies Common Responders to Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1112-1129 Google Scholar ). While PDAC subtyping studies have largely recovered common expression features, it remains unclear whether these bulk RNA-seq state measurements mask heterogeneity at the single-cell level, which features derive from malignant versus non-malignant cells, and how well they are recapitulated in laboratory models. Moreover, the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) includes numerous non-malignant immune and stromal cell types ( Balachandran et al., 2019 6. Balachandran, V.P. ∙ Beatty, G.L. ∙ Dougan, S.K.

Cell. 2019; 178 :160-175 e127 Google Scholar ), but their variation across different sites of disease and their effects on malignant cell state and therapeutic response is not well characterized. Given the lack of mutational biomarkers for PDAC, understanding how cell state is shaped by the local TME and whether cell state can be used as a tractable biomarker for therapy selection remains of critical importance.
To parse the instructive roles of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic inputs to cancer cell state, we developed and employed an optimized translational workflow to perform both high-resolution profiling of metastatic PDAC patient tissue using scRNA-seq ( Gierahn et al., 2017 29. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat.

Second-Strand Synthesis-Based Massively Parallel scRNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Inflammatory Skin Pathologies Immunity. 2020; 53 :878-894 e877 Google Scholar ) and derivation of matched organoid models ( Boj et al., 2015 12.

Tiriac, H. ∙ Belleau, P. ∙ Engle, D.D. ... Organoid Profiling Identifies Common Responders to Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1112-1129 Google Scholar ) from the same core needle biopsy. Using this approach, we generated a single-cell map of metastatic PDAC and used it as a reference to benchmark cell states in matched organoid models. We identify a new intermediate co-expressor (IC) PDAC cell state, uncover distinct site- and subtype-specific TMEs, and demonstrate that TME signals are critical regulators of cancer cell state, plasticity, and response to therapy.

Section: Results

Current precision medicine pipelines focus on preserving mutational fidelity in cancer models; however, it is unclear how well these same models represent prognostic RNA states ( Figure 1 A). We compared bulk DNA and RNA-sequencing profiles of primary and metastatic patient tumors with established cell lines and a cohort of newly generated patient-derived organoids to understand how each model system represents the distribution of mutational and RNA phenotypes seen in patients. We observed no significant difference in driver oncogene alteration frequencies among the groups, suggesting that model systems are relatively faithful genetic representations of patient cohorts (Fisher’s exact test; Figure 1 B , far right). Next, we assessed PDAC subtypes derived from several recent bulk RNA-sequencing studies ( Figure 1 C) ( Bailey et al., 2016 5. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Google Scholar ; Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020 16.

Genet. 2020; 52 :231-240 Google Scholar ; Collisson et al., 2011 17. Collisson, E.A. ∙ Sadanandam, A. ∙ Olson, P. ... Subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and their differing responses to therapy Nat. Med. 2011; 17 :500-503 Google Scholar ; Moffitt et al., 2015 50. Moffitt, R.A. ∙ Marayati, R. ∙ Flate, E.L. ... Virtual microdissection identifies distinct tumor- and stroma-specific subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1168-1178 Google Scholar ). Subsets of signatures from each study were highly concordant and separated primarily into classical-like (clade 1) and basal-like (clade 2) groups. Clade 3 signatures were generally lower in expression but tended to associate with clade 1, while clade 4 signatures represented exocrine pancreas expression patterns and tended to be expressed only in primary disease, suggesting that they may be due to contributions from the primary PDAC TME. Relatedly, the documented low malignant cellularity in PDAC may obstruct malignant cell-specific signature identification in bulk RNA-sequencing datasets ( Collisson et al., 2019 18. Collisson, E.A. ∙ Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ... Molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 16 :207-220 Google Scholar ).
In contrast to the mutational data, we observed significant differences for all RNA signatures when comparing tumors to model types ( Figure 1 C). Whereas primary and metastatic samples include tumors with both classical-like (clade 1) and basal-like (clade 2) signatures, cell lines exhibited predominantly basal-like (clade 2) subtypes while organoids were nearly entirely classical-like (clade 1) with partially overlapping expression of some clade 3 signatures ( Figures 1 C and S1 A). These observations demonstrate that despite preservation of genomic alterations, neither PDAC cell lines nor organoids represent the full repertoire of expression subtypes seen in patient cohorts.
These findings highlight a critical need for new approaches to identify the determinants of cancer cell state both in vivo and in model systems. Cell state is a complex attribute since it integrates cell-intrinsic as well as TME-dependent features; therefore, multiple mechanisms (e.g., clonal selection and/or plasticity) may contribute to the divergence between in vivo and ex vivo expression patterns ( Figure 1 D). We hypothesized that a dataset at single-cell resolution allowing for matched comparisons of in vivo and ex vivo attributes would enable a better understanding of cell state drivers, stability, and functional relevance. To this end, we established a pipeline to generate matched scRNA-seq profiles and organoid models using core needle biopsies from patients with metastatic PDAC (n = 23) ( Figures 1 E and S1 B; Table S1 ). Most samples were obtained from metastatic lesions residing in the liver (19/23), and the majority (21/23) were analyzed by targeted DNA-sequencing, yielding the expected mutational patterns ( Figure S1 B).
Our pipeline generated approximately 1,000 high-quality single cells per biopsy and successful early-passage organoid cultures from 70% of patient samples (16/23 samples reaching at least passage 2) ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 B–S1D). Consistent with other studies, we observed patient-specific and admixed clusters of single cells suggesting the presence of both malignant and non-malignant cells in each biopsy ( Figures S1 E and S1F; STAR Methods ) ( Kim et al., 2018 43.

Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Google Scholar ). Inferred copy number variation (CNV) alteration scores separated putative cancerous and non-cancerous cells in each biopsy and demonstrated high concordance with reference targeted DNA-seq ( Figures S1 G and S1H) ( Patel et al., 2014 57. Patel, A.P. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Trombetta, J.J. ...

Tirosh, I. ∙ Venteicher, A.S. ∙ Hebert, C. ... Single-cell RNA-seq supports a developmental hierarchy in human oligodendroglioma Nature. 2016; 539 :309-313 Google Scholar ). CNV analysis and manual inspection of expression patterns for known markers across single cells supported the identification of malignant cells as well as 11 unique non-malignant cell types ( Figures S1 I–S1K; Table S2 ). Thus, despite the documented low malignant cellularity in PDAC ( Aguirre et al., 2018 2. Aguirre, A.J. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ∙ Camarda, N.D. ... Real-time Genomic Characterization of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer to Enable Precision Medicine Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1096-1111 Google Scholar ; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 15. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Google Scholar ; Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020 16. Chan-Seng-Yue, M. ∙ Kim, J.C. ∙ Wilson, G.W. ... Transcription phenotypes of pancreatic cancer are driven by genomic events during tumor evolution Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :231-240 Google Scholar ), we established a robust pipeline that retrieved high-quality malignant (n = 7,740) and non-malignant (n = 15,302) single-cell transcriptomes from metastatic PDAC needle biopsies, as well as those of matched organoids (n = 24,995) ( Figures 1 E–1G).
After separating the CNV-confirmed PDAC cells from non-malignant cells (excluding one neuroendocrine sample; Figure S2 A; see STAR Methods ), we first interrogated whether previously described RNA subtypes ( Figure 1 C) are represented in single metastatic PDAC cells. Subsets of metastatic cells scored highly for either classical-like or basal-like signatures derived from independent bulk studies indicating the general relevance of these expression programs to in vivo PDAC biology ( Figure 2 A). The remaining literature-derived signatures had low expression in these metastatic cells, suggesting either specificity for primary disease or influence from non-malignant expression in bulk RNA profiles. Interestingly, a large subset of cells showed low expression for all previously proposed signatures, highlighting a gap in our understanding of PDAC expression states ( Figure 2 A; “Low for bulk subtypes”).
Given this large subset of cells that score weakly for previously identified signatures, we sought to understand the spectrum of in vivo expression states through an unbiased analysis of our single-cell dataset. Principal component analysis (PCA) on all malignant cells revealed that genes enriched for signatures of epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PC1) ( Gröger et al., 2012 31. Gröger, C.J. ∙ Grubinger, M. ∙ Waldhör, T. ... Meta-analysis of gene expression signatures defining the epithelial to mesenchymal transition during cancer progression PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e51136 Google Scholar ), basal-like and classical PDAC states (PC1 and PC2), and cell cycle (PC3 and PC8) ( Tirosh et al., 2016a 69. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Google Scholar ) drove the major axes of variation in the dataset ( Figures S2 B and S2C). The PC1-PC2 score difference was correlated with the basal-classical signature axis previously identified in bulk studies (r = 0.8). We identified 1,909 genes significantly correlated with either end of the basal or classical-enriched continuum within our single-cell cohort ( Figure S2 D; Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). Inspection of these genes revealed that more basal-like cells are associated with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, WNT signaling, EMT, and cell cycle progression. Epithelial and pancreatic lineage programs are enriched in the cells with more classical-like attributes ( Figures S2 E and S2F). We term the signatures derived from our single-cell cohort as single-cell basal (scBasal) and single-cell classical (scClassical) ( Figure 2 B).
Single-cell analysis enabled a dissection of expression states that are confounded by contaminating non-malignant cells in bulk measurements. For example, in bulk RNA-seq studies ( Aguirre et al., 2018 2. Aguirre, A.J. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ∙ Camarda, N.D. ... Real-time Genomic Characterization of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer to Enable Precision Medicine Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1096-1111 Google Scholar ; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 15. Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203.e13 Google Scholar ), EMT programs are strongly correlated with markers of fibroblasts (r = 0.9), inversely related to purity metrics (r = −0.5), and poorly correlated with basal-like expression (r = −0.08). At single-cell resolution, we observed a subset of cells that express both scBasal and EMT programs, while other scBasal cells had low expression of EMT programs ( Figure 2 C, left). Similarly, the origin of cytokine response signatures can be difficult to interpret from bulk studies, as interferon (IFN) response gene signatures are positively correlated with markers of several cell types including macrophages (r = 0.6) and T cells (r = 0.4), negatively associated with purity metrics (r = −0.4), and not associated with either basal-like or classical scores (r = 0.01 and −0.04, respectively). In single cells, we observe clear patterns of association between IFN response and a subset of cells with intermediate scBasal expression ( Figure 2 C, right). These findings suggest not all basal-like cells have the same underlying attributes and highlight the importance of utilizing scRNA-seq to understand how malignant cells sense and respond to their local TME.
Although some studies suggest that basal and classical programs exist only in discrete cell populations ( Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020 16. Chan-Seng-Yue, M. ∙ Kim, J.C. ∙ Wilson, G.W. ... Transcription phenotypes of pancreatic cancer are driven by genomic events during tumor evolution Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :231-240 Google Scholar ), we observed that the scBasal and scClassical programs were not mutually exclusive. Rather, we identified cells that are intermediate for scBasal and scClassical gene expression signatures, co-expressed features of both programs to varying degrees, and were poorly described by previously identified bulk RNA subtypes ( Figures 2 B [“Co-expressing cells”], S3 A, and S3B). We identified 115 genes whose expression was correlated with scBasal-scClassical co-expression and termed this gene set the IC state ( Figures 2 D, S3 C, and S3D; Table S3 ; STAR Methods ).
The IC state is enriched for developmental, RAS signaling, and inflammation/stress response gene sets ( Figure 2 E). Signatures of RAS signaling are enriched in the IC state even compared with scBasal and scClassical programs, and, by contrast, scClassical states are enriched for AKT-associated gene sets ( Figures 2 B, 2D, 2E, and S2 F). We also assessed whether the IC state overlapped with any phenotypes recently reported in a study of normal pancreas progenitors ( Qadir et al., 2020 61. Qadir, M.M.F. ∙ Álvarez-Cubela, S. ∙ Klein, D. ... Single-cell resolution analysis of the human pancreatic ductal progenitor cell niche Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :10876-10887 Google Scholar ). We found that both scBasal and scClassical gene expression signatures are expressed by pro-ductal progenitor cells, while the IC gene expression program is enriched in an undifferentiated, stress-responsive progenitor population ( Figure S3 E) ( Qadir et al., 2020 61. Qadir, M.M.F. ∙ Álvarez-Cubela, S. ∙ Klein, D. ... Single-cell resolution analysis of the human pancreatic ductal progenitor cell niche Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :10876-10887 Google Scholar ). Although the IC state may not represent a distinct step along a developmental trajectory, it may represent a similar stress-induced transition state in a cancer context.
We next assessed how this new IC state relates to previously proposed bulk signatures to clarify potential inter-relationships. Pairwise correlation of our PDAC single-cell and established bulk RNA-seq signatures in malignant cells revealed that the IC state is unique and not well described by prior signatures ( Figure S3 F). Our findings suggest that malignant PDAC cells organize in a tripartite cell state framework that spans committed basal and classical phenotypes, with considerable signature co-expression in single cells ( Figure 2 F). Similar to the variation in EMT scores observed in scBasal-expressing cancer cells ( Figure 2 C), we noted heterogeneity among co-expressing cells for the IC program ( Figure 2 F).
Classification of tumors by their malignant pseudo-bulk signature expression stratified the cohort into those that expressed predominantly scBasal, scClassical, or IC signatures ( Figure S3 G–S3I). Individual patient specimens still exhibited significant heterogeneity at the cellular level, containing at least two and sometimes all three malignant cell states ( Figure S3 J). Samples with greater malignant cell state diversity (i.e., higher proportions of both scBasal and scClassical cells) also exhibited a higher proportion of cells expressing the IC state, suggesting the IC state may serve as a transition between scBasal and scClassical poles ( Figure 2 G).
To validate this extensive heterogeneity and the presence of co-expressing cells in our metastatic cohort, we used a subtype-specific multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) panel to categorize single malignant cells by their patterns of marker detection in 10 matched cases from our single cell study ( Figure S4 A; Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). We observed overlap of basal and classical markers within single cells at the protein level, corroborating the existence of co-expressing cells ( Figures 2 H and S4 B). Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between malignant phenotypes assessed by mIF protein detection for samples from the same RNA subtype (average r = 0.52) compared to those of different subtypes (average r = 0.06, p < 10 −7 , Student’s t test) ( Figure S4 C, white dots). Deep sampling of each matched biopsy using mIF (mean = 13,078 cells per sample) also confirmed the increased fraction of co-expressing cells in tumors with equal basal and classical cell state mixing ( Figure S4 D). Finally, we used mIF to identify co-expressing cells in primary tumor samples, suggesting that the IC state may be a general feature of PDAC ( Figure S4 E).
With this high-resolution reference map of in vivo malignant cell states, we next asked whether matched ex vivo models retained the cell state distribution of the tissues from which they were derived. An unbiased comparison of all malignant cells (biopsy and organoid; 32,073 cells) revealed separation of biopsy and organoid profiles, while organoid samples from iterative passages ex vivo clustered together ( Figures S5 A and S5B). After removing low-frequency non-malignant cells ( Figures S5 B–S5D; STAR Methods ), we observed that models attempted from biopsies with high malignant-cell-averaged scBasal or IC states exhibited lower rates of long-term propagation than models derived from scClassical tumors ( Figure 3 A). When comparing early passage CNV-confirmed organoid cancer cells to their cognates from patient tissues, culture in an ex vivo microenvironment caused greater deviation in cell state than CNV-defined genotype ( Figure 3 A; STAR Methods ).
We next examined how ex vivo transcriptional states in our organoid cohort differed from their matched patient samples ( Figure 3 B). We observed a striking loss of scBasal gene expression and to a lesser extent, the IC program. By contrast, aggregate scClassical gene expression remained largely unchanged in organoid conditions. This comparative analysis also nominated a set of upregulated organoid-specific genes that were not present in vivo , including markers of epithelial identity, oxidative stress response pathways (e.g., NRF2 target genes), and amino acid metabolism (hereafter collectively referred to as “organoid-specific” gene expression) ( Figure 3 C, bottom; Table S4 ). These findings suggest that changes to microenvironmental growth conditions significantly alter cellular transcriptional states and induce culture-specific expression programs, highlighting the importance of benchmarking ex vivo models using matched in vivo states as a reference.
Regardless of the cell state distribution in the original biopsy, individual models assumed more scClassical or organoid-specific cell states over time in culture ( Figure 3 D), mirroring the results in our larger bulk RNA-seq cohort ( Figures 1 B and 3 C [top]). To better understand the drivers of this cell state bias, we first investigated genetic alterations associated with either the basal or classical subtypes. Prior work has suggested that KRAS amplifications associate with basal features ( Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020 16. Chan-Seng-Yue, M. ∙ Kim, J.C. ∙ Wilson, G.W. ... Transcription phenotypes of pancreatic cancer are driven by genomic events during tumor evolution Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :231-240 Google Scholar ; Miyabayashi et al., 2020 49. Miyabayashi, K. ∙ Baker, L.A. ∙ Deschênes, A. ... Intraductal Transplantation Models of Human Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Reveal Progressive Transition of Molecular Subtypes Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1566-1589 Google Scholar ), while amplifications of lineage transcription factors like GATA6 associate with classical subtypes ( Chan-Seng-Yue et al., 2020 16. Chan-Seng-Yue, M. ∙ Kim, J.C. ∙ Wilson, G.W. ... Transcription phenotypes of pancreatic cancer are driven by genomic events during tumor evolution Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :231-240 Google Scholar ). In agreement with prior bulk studies, we observed a significant association between single-cell inferred KRAS copy number gain and the scBasal state in metastatic cells (p < 0.03 Fisher’s exact test) ( Figure S5 E). Four KRAS -amplified samples proliferated ex vivo and maintained this alteration, but their malignant cell state shifted from scBasal in vivo to scClassical in organoid culture ( Figures 3 D [black dots] and S5 F), including one sample where the same KRAS -amplified clone exhibited a similar scBasal (biopsy) to scClassical (organoid) state shift ( Figure 3 E). These findings demonstrate that KRAS amplification alone is not sufficient to lock the scBasal expression state, PDAC cells are plastic, and the microenvironment can influence cell state independent of genotype in this context.
We next compared genetic heterogeneity (inferred CNV sub-clones) and transcriptional states from matched biopsy tissue and organoid samples from iterative passages. ScClassical tumors tended to maintain their genotype and transcriptional state both early in culture and at later passages (e.g., PANFR0631) ( Figures 3 D and S5 G [clone A]). In contrast, most models derived from scBasal or IC tumors exhibited early cell-state deviation and cessation of growth within 100 days of initiation (e.g., PANFR0552) ( Figures 3 D and S5 H). In some cases, we observed outgrowth of an scClassical sub-clone in culture. For example, the in vivo scBasal clones from PANFR0489R rapidly decreased in abundance while clones with scClassical or organoid-specific states emerged at later passages ( Figures S5 I and S5J). By contrast, in vivo scBasal clones from PANFR0575 were maintained initially in culture, but their cell state was highly plastic and changed to scClassical when measured as organoids at passages 2 and 3 ( Figures 3 E and S5 K). After > 100 additional days in ex vivo culture, PANFR0575 regained scBasal expression and clones with inferred TP63 amplifications, a squamous-specifying transcription factor ( Somerville et al., 2018 65. Somerville, T.D.D. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Miyabayashi, K. ... TP63-Mediated Enhancer Reprogramming Drives the Squamous Subtype of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :1741-1755 e1747 Google Scholar ), dominated the culture ( Figure S5 K [clones D and E]). Our detailed analysis reveals that both plasticity and selection occur in the same model, where certain clones demonstrate plasticity in response to microenvironmental signals, and certain genotypes, though rare, may still exert a strong effect despite opposing cues from the microenvironment. In sum, these findings underscore the need to consider both mutational and transcriptional state to ensure faithful representation of in vivo cancer cell phenotypes.
Given the evidence for selection and plasticity in standard organoid conditions, we tested whether specific aspects of the ex vivo culture environment governed cell state determination. We first evaluated the effects of extracellular matrix dimensionality by culturing established 3-dimensional (3D) organoid models as 2-dimensional (2D) cell lines in the same organoid medium. This did not affect transcriptional subtype across the 4 models tested ( Figure S5 L). Next, we asked whether culturing established organoid models in altered media conditions could rescue expression heterogeneity ( Figure 4 A). We cultured 4 organoid models in media without any additives for 6 days (“Minimal” medium) ( Table S5 ; STAR Methods ) and observed a robust increase in scBasal expression, a decrease in organoid-specific gene expression, and stable CNV profiles ( Figures 4 B, S5 M, and S5N). With greater time in minimal medium, the distribution of cell states shifted even further toward IC and scBasal ( Figure 4 C). Since minimal medium lacks serum and mitogens to maintain prolonged cell growth, we tested a reduced organoid media formulation (“OWRNA”) ( Table S5 ; STAR Methods ) and found that OWRNA supported proliferation, strengthened scClassical, and allowed for scBasal expression ( Figure S5 O).
Given the divergence in cell state for cell line versus organoid models of PDAC ( Figures 1 A and 1B), we took an established cell line and an organoid model and cultured them in the reciprocal media condition. Organoid cells grown in standard cancer cell line medium (“Cell line media,” RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum) ( STAR Methods ) gained scBasal expression, while CFPAC1, an established pancreatic cancer cell line, lost scBasal features when grown in complete organoid media ( Figures 4 D, 4E, S5 P, and S5Q). To understand whether these state changes are functionally significant, we exposed CFPAC1 cells grown in basal media conditions (“cell line media”) or classical conditions (complete organoid media) to SN-38 and paclitaxel. Strikingly, in both instances, we observed greater sensitivity among cells grown in organoid media, suggesting that environmental factors can shape therapeutic response through state changes ( Figure 4 F). These findings demonstrate that even established models are sensitive to changes in culture conditions and that a combination of up-front selective pressures and culture medium-imprinting shapes the cell-state biases in extant model systems, influencing their functional attributes.
Although maintaining organoids in minimal or cell line media conditions resulted in partial recovery of scBasal and IC expression, we failed to observe fully polarized models (Figures S5P and S5Q), suggesting that these conditions lack critical TME components to fully specify cell state. We used differential expression across each biopsy-organoid pair to nominate genes that were expressed in vivo but missing ex vivo ( Figure 3 B; STAR Methods ). Genes differentially expressed by malignant cells in vivo were related to soluble cytokine signaling, cell-cell communication, and microenvironmental interactions ( Figure 4 G). Hierarchical clustering revealed state-dependent expression patterns for in vivo -specific genes ( Figure 4 H; Table S4 ). For example, IFN response and EMT genes were significantly upregulated in scBasal and IC malignant cells in vivo (clusters 1 and 2), while genes associated with cell-cell interactions and surface glycoproteins were more strongly expressed in IC and scClassical cells (cluster 3). Genes related to biological adhesion were more uniform in their expression across the subtypes (cluster 4) ( Figure 4 H). The relative absence of these genes in organoid culture and their differences in expression across transcriptional subtypes in vivo suggests that TME signals might play a role in fully specifying cancer cell transcriptional state and potentially therapeutic responses.
The presence of TME-associated expression patterns in cancer cells in vivo suggested there may be subtype-dependent structure to, and instructive signaling from, the metastatic TME; however, relatively little is known about the composition of the metastatic TME in PDAC. We analyzed the non-malignant cells (n = 14,811) in the metastatic niche to further subclassify cell types and provide a more complete picture of the immune/stromal composition of metastatic disease ( Figure 5 A). Sub-clustering of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells revealed 4 cell types ( CD4 + T, CD8 + T, NK, and CD16+ [ FCGR3A+ ] NK cells) ( Figures S6 A and S6B; STAR Methods ) Similarly, an unbiased analysis within the monocyte/macrophage compartment revealed 3 subsets of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) ( FCN1 + “monocyte-like” TAMs, C1QC + TAMs, and SPP1+ TAMs) ( Figures S6 C and S6D; Table S2 ) ( Zhang et al., 2020 78. Zhang, L. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Skrzypczynska, K.M. ... Single-Cell Analyses Inform Mechanisms of Myeloid-Targeted Therapies in Colon Cancer Cell. 2020; 181 :442-459 e429 Google Scholar ; Zilionis et al., 2019 79.

Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species Immunity. 2019; 50 :1317-1334 e1310 Google Scholar ). Marker expression across all previously described non-malignant cells is summarized in Figure S6 E.
Whether the TME differs between primary PDAC and different metastatic sites is not well understood. Although we found equal distribution of immune cells across different metastatic sites, mesenchymal cells clustered by the site of disease ( Figures S6 F and S6G). Despite uniform expression of a previously described myofibroblast signature ( Elyada et al., 2019 22. Elyada, E. ∙ Bolisetty, M. ∙ Laise, P. ...

Med. 2017; 214 :579-596 Google Scholar ), an unbiased analysis revealed divergent mesenchymal states favoring expression of either fibroblast-like or pericyte-like genes ( Figures S6 H–S6K; Table S2 ) ( Bartoschek et al., 2018 7.

Cancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity in axillary lymph nodes drives metastases in breast cancer through complementary mechanisms Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :404 Google Scholar ). While biopsies from each location contained both subsets, we detected a strong association between liver biopsies and the pericyte-like mesenchymal state ( Figures 5 B, S6 L, and S6M). We validated this association in larger cohorts and observed a similar relationship between pericyte-like expression and liver metastases, while in contrast, tumors in the pancreas favored fibroblast-like mesenchymal expression ( Figure 5 C). Thus, we observed diverse immune and stromal cell types in the metastatic TME and identified mesenchymal features unique to the liver niche compared with primary disease ( Figure 5 D).
We next searched for associations between malignant cell state and the composition of the TME. Five samples were excluded from this analysis on the basis of low cell counts (< 200 cells) or indeterminant transcriptional subtype ( Figure S6 N). We applied Simpson’s diversity index to define each tumor’s overall microenvironmental composition ( STAR Methods ). Tumors with higher average malignant scClassical or IC expression harbored greater TME diversity, while strongly scBasal tumors exhibited more homogeneous TMEs ( Figure 5 E). We observed a similar pattern in bulk samples where we inferred diversity by using the “immunogenic” signature ( Bailey et al., 2016 5. Bailey, P. ∙ Chang, D.K. ∙ Nones, K. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Genomic analyses identify molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer Nature. 2016; 531 :47-52 Google Scholar ) to indicate greater immune cell infiltration ( Figure 5 F). Clustering over the cell type fractions in each biopsy revealed the non-malignant cell types driving overall diversity differences ( Figures 5 G and 5H). C1QC+ TAMs dominated the TME of strongly scBasal tumors, and both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were significantly depleted in scBasal contexts compared to the rest of the samples in the cohort ( Figures 5 H and 5I). By contrast, T cells were most often isolated from, and their abundance positively correlated with, higher IC malignant fractions in our cohort ( Figures 5 I and S6 O). We observed similar patterns in bulk RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ( Weinstein et al., 2013 76. Weinstein, J.N. ∙ Collisson, E.A. ∙ Mills, G.B. ..., Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :1113-1120 Google Scholar ; Vivian et al., 2017 74. Vivian, J. ∙ Rao, A.A. ∙ Nothaft, F.A. ... Toil enables reproducible, open source, big biomedical data analyses Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :314-316 Google Scholar ), noting reduced levels of immune-related gene expression in other epithelial tumors with high basal/squamous gene expression ( Figure S6 P [cluster 4]). Together, these findings suggest coordination between cancer cell states and the local TME, with decreased immune cell diversity in basal contexts ( Figure 5 J).
Based on these observations, we hypothesized that soluble factors specific to the TME of each transcriptional subtype may drive cancer cell states and potentially influence their therapeutic responses ( Figure 6 A). In vivo , the secreted factor milieu surrounding cancer cells originates from at least two sources: malignant cells themselves (“autocrine” factors) and non-malignant cells (“paracrine” factors) ( Figure 6 A). We first identified secreted factors differentially expressed by cancer cells in each transcriptional state (“autocrine” signals) and applied these to rescue IC and scBasal expression in ex vivo models ( Figure 6 B; Table S6 ; STAR Methods ). TGFB2 was the top differentially expressed factor shared by malignant cells in both scBasal and IC TMEs ( Figure 6 B), and organoids cultured with TGF-β ligands exhibited a pronounced shift toward IC and scBasal states ( Figure 6 C). The reemergence of scBasal transcriptional heterogeneity in both minimal media ( Figure 5 C) and TGF-β conditions ( Figure 6 C) suggested that different types of microenvironmental pressure can lead to the basal-like cell state. These experiments also indicate that culture conditions can be tuned to achieve compositional differences spanning scClassical, heterogenous, and scBasal expression, akin to those seen in vivo .
We next assessed whether TME signals, like media formulation ( Figure 4 F), could influence drug sensitivity through altering transcriptional state. In an isogenic organoid system ( STAR Methods ), models induced to adopt scBasal expression through exposure to TGF-β for 3 weeks were less sensitive to several standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agents including gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and SN-38, the active analog of irinotecan ( Figures 6 D, S7 A, and S7B; Table S7 ). The duration of exposure to TGF-β corresponded with the degree of state shift, and these states were highly plastic, as withdrawal of TGF-β resulted in a return to scClassical expression ( Figure 6 E). Drug sensitivity tracked with cancer cell state, as models were re-sensitized to chemotherapeutic agents upon shifting back to the scClassical state ( Figures 6 E and 6F). These observations agree with recent clinical trial data showing that patients with basal phenotypes tend to have poorer outcomes with combination chemotherapy ( Aung et al., 2018 4. Aung, K.L. ∙ Fischer, S.E. ∙ Denroche, R.E. ... Genomics-Driven Precision Medicine for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: Early Results from the COMPASS Trial Clin.

Genet. 2015; 47 :1168-1178 Google Scholar ). Together, these findings highlight the remarkable phenotypic and functional plasticity inherent in tumor models.
To assess for state-specific vulnerabilities more broadly, we tested a 24-drug panel in isogenic organoid systems with the scBasal state induced via two distinct routes, either by culturing in minimal or TGF-β-containing medium ( Figure 6 G; Table S7 ). Within the same model, scClassical states were on average more sensitive to both chemotherapy and agents targeting DNA-damage repair pathways while scBasal states were more sensitive to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors (MEK and ERK inhibitors) ( Figures 6 G, S7 A, and S7B). These findings provide direct evidence that transcriptional state can be a major determinant of drug response and that differential targeting of cell states represents an actionable therapeutic paradigm.
We next searched for paracrine factors differentially expressed by the non-malignant cells in each subtype. We noted an increasing number of differentially expressed factors in the IC and scBasal contexts and mapped each paracrine factor to its cognate cell type to summarize the overall secreted factor combinations that shape subtype-specific TMEs in metastatic PDAC ( Figures 7 A and 7B; Table S6 ; STAR Methods ). Interestingly, IFNG from CD8+ T cells was most highly expressed in the IC TME, consistent with a higher T cell fraction in IC tumors ( Figures 5 G and S6 O) and the relative increase in IFN-responsive gene expression in IC and scBasal malignant cells ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Correspondingly, cells from organoid models exposed to interferon γ (IFNγ) showed increased IFN response gene expression (IFN response score) and a concomitant shift toward the IC state ( Figures 7 C, S7 C, and S7D).
We next examined two in vivo scenarios for evidence that the TME can drive cell state variation by analyzing samples from (1) distinct metastatic sites within the same patient and (2) the same metastatic site before and after immunotherapy. In the first case (PANRF0473), a larger fraction of T cells within the liver metastatic niche expressed high levels of IFNG (IFNG expression score) relative to the lung metastatic niche. Correspondingly, malignant cells in the liver showed evidence of IFN response and higher IC state expression ( Figure 7 D, S7E,F). Similarly, in serial samples from the same liver lesion in patient PANFR0489, the post-progression biopsy harbored a higher fraction of T cells with high IFNG expression scores, consistent with changes to the TME stemming from immunotherapy. Post-progression malignant cells again expressed higher IFN response scores, and their transcriptional phenotypes were shifted toward the IC and scBasal states relative to the pre-treatment malignant cells ( Figures 7 E, 7F, S7 G, and S7H). These paired biopsies allow a window into the complex interplay between the TME and cancer cells within the same patient and, consistent with our organoid studies, illustrate the critical role that TME-supplied cytokines and immune activation may play in directing cancer cell state.

Section: Discussion

Single-cell atlases of cancer have revolutionized our understanding of human malignancies and revealed that mutational and transcriptional heterogeneity are common. Critical next steps include understanding what drives cancer cell state and whether it can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we provide a systematic framework for assessing cancer cell states, identifying drivers of transcriptional plasticity, and evaluating their functional significance in model systems. The use of matched in vivo tissue as a reference for culture model state fidelity, an approach that has been applied in normal organoid systems ( Fujii et al., 2018 25. Fujii, M. ∙ Matano, M. ∙ Toshimitsu, K. ... Human Intestinal Organoids Maintain Self-Renewal Capacity and Cellular Diversity in Niche-Inspired Culture Condition Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 23 :787-793 e786 Google Scholar ) but not in cancer, enabled a structured dissection of cell-intrinsic versus TME-induced contributions to malignant cell state. As the community continues to catalog these transcriptional states in clinical samples at single-cell resolution, we anticipate this framework will be broadly applicable for understanding their functional significance across a variety of cancers.
Single-cell resolution enabled us to appreciate the layering of malignant states whereby single cells can be unified in their similarity for an expression subtype (e.g., scBasal or IC) but differ in their expression of TME-influenced programs (e.g., IFN response). Future studies across more patients and different anatomic disease sites at single-cell resolution will be needed to fully parse which invariant “core” genes mark archetypal cell states in PDAC and which expression features are superimposed by the TME. Clinically annotated datasets will also aid in the assessment of these expression states for prognostic value and their utility in nominating cell state-specific therapeutic liabilities.
We also uncovered formerly unappreciated relationships between cancer cell transcriptional states and the local TME. Similar to the relationship between inflammation and tumorigenesis ( Alonso-Curbelo et al., 2021 3. Alonso-Curbelo, D. ∙ Ho, Y.J. ∙ Burdziak, C. ... A gene-environment-induced epigenetic program initiates tumorigenesis Nature. 2021; 590 :642-648 Google Scholar ; Li et al., 2021 45. Li, Y. ∙ He, Y. ∙ Peng, J. ... Mutant Kras co-opts a proto-oncogenic enhancer network in inflammation-induced metaplastic progenitor cells to initiate pancreatic cancer Nature Cancer. 2021; 2 :49-65 PubMed Google Scholar ), our data support a model wherein as tumors become inflamed and immune-activated, malignant cells display enhanced state plasticity. These relationships may have implications for PDAC immunotherapy strategies given that a productive CD8 T cell response may promote more aggressive basal-like states, as suggested by our paired pre- and post-immunotherapy samples. Coordination between basal/mesenchymal malignant cell states and immune responses may be a broadly relevant phenomenon given our observations in other basal-like tumors and recent work in glioblastoma ( Hara et al., 2021 35. Hara, T. ∙ Chanoch-Myers, R. ∙ Mathewson, N.D. ... Interactions between cancer cells and immune cells drive transitions to mesenchymal-like states in glioblastoma Cancer Cell. 2021; 39 :779-792 e711 Google Scholar ). A recent publication further supports the idea that local TME variation can influence clinical outcomes in PDAC ( Grünwald et al., 2021 32. Grünwald, B.T. ∙ Devisme, A. ∙ Andrieux, G. ... Spatially confined sub-tumor microenvironments in pancreatic cancer Cell. 2021; 184 :5577-5592.e18 Google Scholar ), while our work provides direct evidence that TME signals are critical drivers of malignant cell state and that cell state dictates drug sensitivity. Larger cohorts of longitudinal single-cell measurements, both spatially resolved and transcriptome-wide, from individual patients undergoing therapy are needed to fully assess variation in the TME, the kinetics of cell state plasticity, and their consequences for therapeutic response.
While the genetic evolution of ex vivo models is an established phenomenon ( Ben-David et al., 2019 9. Ben-David, U. ∙ Beroukhim, R. ∙ Golub, T.R. Genomic evolution of cancer models: perils and opportunities Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2019; 19 :97-109 Google Scholar ; Ben-David et al., 2018 8. Ben-David, U. ∙ Siranosian, B. ∙ Ha, G. ... Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell line drug response Nature. 2018; 560 :325-330 Google Scholar ), our study shows similar ex vivo evolution along a transcriptional axis that causes discordance between a patient sample and its matched avatar. For example, biopsies taken from PANFR0489R and PANFR0576 establish long-term cultures ex vivo , but they do not represent the dominant cell state of the corresponding patient tissue in vivo ( Figure 3 D). Given our demonstrated link between cell state and therapeutic response, these findings establish the necessity for preserving transcriptional fidelity in personalized medicine pipelines ( Hahn et al., 2021 34. Hahn, W.C. ∙ Bader, J.S. ∙ Braun, T.P. ..., Cancer Target Discovery and Development Network An expanded universe of cancer targets Cell. 2021; 184 :1142-1155 Google Scholar ). Since models from different patients may also harbor differential plasticity and adaptability, future efforts will need to evaluate models in multiple conditions to account for this latent property, define its drivers (e.g., genetics, epigenetics), and accurately map vulnerabilities. Importantly, manipulating the soluble microenvironment may offer a more tractable approach for state-specific high-throughput screening compared to more complex heterotypic co-cultures or patient-derived xenograft systems.
Within the context of PDAC, clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and FOLFIRINOX in patients with basal- versus classical-predominant metastatic disease (e.g., PASS01 – NCT04469556). Our observations suggest that basal tumors may exhibit broadly decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy and highlight the need for new strategies to target this transcriptional subtype of PDAC. Importantly, we show that the transition to an scBasal state may render cells sensitive to other classes of inhibitors. Since most PDAC tumors are heterogenous, combination strategies that suppress distinct cell states may be necessary for maximal synergistic effect ( Palmer et al., 2019 56. Palmer, A.C. ∙ Chidley, C. ∙ Sorger, P.K. A curative combination cancer therapy achieves high fractional cell killing through low cross-resistance and drug additivity eLife. 2019; 8 :e50036 Google Scholar ; Palmer and Sorger, 2017 55. Palmer, A.C. ∙ Sorger, P.K. Combination Cancer Therapy Can Confer Benefit via Patient-to-Patient Variability without Drug Additivity or Synergy Cell. 2017; 171 :1678-1691 e1613 Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the ability of the TME to drive malignant cell state transitions suggests that next generation therapeutic strategies may also need to target site-specific supportive cells in the TME to control cell-state evolution during therapy.
In sum, we provide a widely applicable framework to benchmark cell states in patient-derived model systems, identify the drivers of malignant transcriptional heterogeneity, and examine the functional significance of cell state. As efforts to characterize cell states across malignancies provide new and increasingly higher resolution maps of patient tissues, an important next step will be to understand better how to control and target cell state. We anticipate that our approach will provide a path toward the systematic evaluation of cell state as a targetable feature in cancer.
We focused on understanding how the TME supports cell state, and thus we cannot comment directly on the epigenetic mechanisms through which these cell state transitions occur. Additional studies into the regulatory mechanisms underlying PDAC state transitions will be a critical next step in further delineating the relationships between cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors and state. In addition, we tracked CNV alterations to define genetic clones, but future studies using barcode-based lineage tracing approaches are needed to confirm whether individual cells transition between scClassical and scBasal states via the IC state as our data suggest ( Wagner and Klein, 2020 75. Wagner, D.E. ∙ Klein, A.M. Lineage tracing meets single-cell omics: opportunities and challenges Nat. Rev. Genet. 2020; 21 :410-427 Google Scholar ). While we focused predominantly on metastatic biopsies from the liver, it will be important in future studies to more broadly analyze how site-specific cues drive state plasticity. Even with our limited number of samples from outside the liver, we uncovered site-specific differences in mesenchymal populations which revealed important differences between metastatic and primary disease. Given the pivotal role that has been suggested for the fibrotic TME in primary disease ( Ho et al., 2020 37. Ho, W.J. ∙ Jaffee, E.M. ∙ Zheng, L. The tumour microenvironment in pancreatic cancer - clinical challenges and opportunities Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2020; 17 :527-540 Google Scholar ; Sahai et al., 2020 63. Sahai, E. ∙ Astsaturov, I. ∙ Cukierman, E. ... A framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblasts Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2020; 20 :174-186 Google Scholar ), these findings carry important implications for targeting the stromal compartment in primary versus metastatic PDAC. Future studies with larger sample and cell numbers will be needed to make comparisons across cell types in primary and metastatic disease to fully understand how the TME regulates transcriptional phenotypes in these distinct niches. Here, advances in spatial transcriptomics will likely empower a deeper understanding of these relationships across compartments ( Longo et al., 2021 47. Longo, S.K. ∙ Guo, M.G. ∙ Ji, A.L. ... Integrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to elucidate intercellular tissue dynamics Nat. Rev. Genet. 2021; 22 :627-644 Google Scholar ). Finally, future studies that broadly map the landscape of RNA state-dependent drug response across various cancer models will be needed to fully define the links between malignant cell transcriptional plasticity and therapeutic response.

Organoid models generated in this study are available upon request with a materials transfer agreement.
Eligible participants were recruited from outpatient clinics and inpatient units at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Investigators obtained written, informed consent from patients at least 18 years old with pancreatic cancer for Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols 11-104, 17-000, 03-189, and/or 14-408 for tissue collection, molecular analysis, and organoid generation. ScRNA-seq samples were collected from 23 patients between October 2018 and December 2020, both male (n = 13) and female (n = 10). Organoid samples for bulk genomic and transcriptomic analyses were collected between May 2015 and January 2018. Core needle biopsy specimens were collected and the first core was sent for pathologic analysis. One or more additional cores were then allocated for scRNA-seq and/or organoid generation. Clinical features of our patient cohort are included in Table S1 .
Tissue samples were minced into small portions using a scalpel and then digested at 37°C for 15 min using digest medium that consisted of human complete organoid medium (see below), 1 mg/mL collagenase XI (Sigma Aldrich), 10 μg/mL DNase (Stem Cell Technologies), and 10 μM Y27632 (Selleck) ( Tiriac et al., 2018 68. Tiriac, H. ∙ Belleau, P. ∙ Engle, D.D. ... Organoid Profiling Identifies Common Responders to Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1112-1129 Google Scholar ). After dissociation, a portion of the cells from the fresh tumor specimen were allocated for scRNA-seq, and the remainder were initiated and maintained as patient-derived organoid cultures as previously described ( Boj et al., 2015 12. Boj, S.F. ∙ Hwang, C.I. ∙ Baker, L.A. ... Organoid models of human and mouse ductal pancreatic cancer Cell. 2015; 160 :324-338 Google Scholar ; Tiriac et al., 2018 68. Tiriac, H. ∙ Belleau, P. ∙ Engle, D.D. ... Organoid Profiling Identifies Common Responders to Chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1112-1129 Google Scholar ). In brief, digested cells were seeded in 3-dimensional (3D) Growth-factor Reduced Matrigel (Corning), fed with human complete organoid medium containing Advanced DMEM/F12 (GIBCO), 10 mM HEPES (GIBCO), 1x GlutaMAX (GIBCO), 500 nM A83-01 (Tocris), 50 ng/mL mEGF (Peprotech), 100 ng/mL mNoggin (Peprotech), 100 ng/mL hFGF10 (Peprotech), 10 nM hGastrin I (Sigma), 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 10 mM Nicotinamide (Sigma), 1x B27 supplement (GIBCO), RSPONDIN-1 conditioned media 10% final, WNT3A conditioned media 50% final, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO), and 1x Primocin (Invivogen) (Table S5), and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . 10 μM Y27632 (Selleck) was included in the culture medium of newly initiated samples until the first media exchange. For propagation, organoids were dissociated with TrypLE Express (GIBCO) before re-seeding into fresh Matrigel and culture medium.
After initial processing of fresh tissue specimens, we monitored samples closely for organoid growth. We did not passage organoids at set time intervals, as there was significant variability in the time needed to establish relatively robust growth of organoids ( Figure 3 D). Instead, we maintained early passage organoids until they reached relative confluence, and then passaged them at low split ratios (1:1, 1:1.5, or 1:2 dilutions) in complete organoid medium to promote continued growth. In one case, PANFR0489R, cells persisted as individuals and small organoids after initiation in complete organoid medium, but did not grow and expand cell numbers significantly. Approximately 15 weeks after initiation, we switched a portion of the surviving cells to organoid medium without A83-01 or mNoggin, and observed renewed growth of organoids under these media conditions but not of those that remained in complete organoid medium. Consequently, we expanded this sample in media without A83-01 or mNoggin, including performing early passage scRNA-seq. After several additional passages, once the organoids were robustly growing, we were able to transition this model back to complete organoid medium with no apparent change in growth rate, morphology, or transcriptional state. All other serially sampled organoids were maintained and assessed in complete medium except as indicated when specific media alterations or experimental perturbations were performed. The identify of organoid models was authenticated by comparison of their inferred CNV profiles with targeted genomic sequencing and CNV profiles of matched patient tissue and with inferred CNV profiles from patient tissue and earlier passage models in the case of samples serially assessed with scRNA-seq. The identify of cell line models was authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. Cell line and organoid cultures were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.
Patient specimens were dissociated for paired scRNA-seq and organoid generation as described above. In our initial process optimization for fresh patient specimens, we found that dissociation times below 30 min, while not always completely digesting all biopsy material and potentially affecting the representation of difficult to dissociate cell types (e.g., fibroblasts), resulted in greater cell viability and improved RNA quality downstream. After tissue dissociation, cells were washed, treated with ACK lysing buffer (Thermo Fisher) to lyse red blood cells, washed again, and counted using a hemocytometer with 0.4% Trypan blue (Thermo Fisher) added at 1:1 dilution for viability assessment. We allowed residual tissue chunks to settle before selecting a predominance of single cells for counting and Seq-Well processing. We allocated between 10,000 and 15,000 viable cells per Seq-Well array, and where possible we prepared two arrays per sample. Most samples were processed and loaded onto Seq-Well arrays within 2-3 h of biopsy acquisition. Remaining cells and tissue chunks were allocated for patient-matched organoid generation.
For scRNA-seq of organoid samples and cell lines (CFPAC1), we passaged models and allowed them to grow for 6 days before dissociating to single cells (organoids – TrypLE Express, Thermo Fisher; cell lines – 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA, Thermo Fisher), counting, and allocating 15,000 viable cells for Seq-Well. By standardizing the collection of organoid scRNA-seq samples at 6 days after passaging, we tried to minimize bias arising from cell cycle differences in samples at different degrees of confluence.
For adaptation of patient-derived organoids onto 2-dimensional (2D) culture surfaces as patient-derived cell lines, tissue culture plates were pre-coated with 100 μg/mL Matrigel dissolved in basal media for 2 h at 37°C before washing with PBS. Established organoid models were dissociated and seeded onto these Matrigel-coated culture wells in complete organoid media. In parallel, a portion of these passage-matched organoid cells were re-seeded into Matrigel droplets as above. Cells were cultured in both matrix conditions in complete organoid media until they were confluent, approximately 2-3 weeks. Cells were collected and lysed using Trizol before snap freezing. RNA was isolated and purified as described below (“Bulk RNA-sequencing of organoids” section) using chloroform extraction, aqueous phase isolation, and processing using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal kit before being submitted for sequencing.
For scRNA-seq assessment of organoid cell states when cultured under different media conditions, established organoid models were passaged as above by dissociating and reseeding into Matrigel droplets. A portion of the cells were cultured with complete organoid media (“Complete media”), while a distinct portion of passage-matched cells were cultured in “Minimal” media, which consisted of Advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher), 1x GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher), and 1x Primocin (Invivogen) (Table S5). Cells were cultured for 6 days before being collected, dissociated, and aliquoted for scRNA-seq. Images were taken with an Olympus XM10 camera mounted to an Olympus CKX41 microscope 1 day after seeding and again after 11 days in culture to assess organoid growth in both conditions. The portion of cells cultured in minimal media were maintained in the same conditions for a longer duration and harvested again for scRNA-seq at 27 days and 59 days after the initial introduction of minimal media. To mirror the standard scRNA-seq workflow, the cells harvested at the 27- and 59-day time points were collected 6 days after passaging.
In addition to the minimal media experiment, organoid cells were also cultured in standard cell line media (“RP10”), which contains RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher) and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), or in reduced organoid media “OWRNA,” which consists of Advanced DMEM/F12 (Thermo Fisher), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher), 1x GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher), 50 ng/mL mEGF (Peprotech), 100 ng/mL hFGF10 (Peprotech), 10 nM hGastrin I (Sigma), 1.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (Sigma), 10 mM Nicotinamide (Sigma), 1x B27 supplement (Thermo Fisher), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher), and 1x Primocin (Invivogen) (i.e., complete organoid medium with removal of WNT3A, RSPONDIN-1, NOGGIN, and A-8301; Table S5). Furthermore, OWRNA reduced organoid medium served as the baseline control medium when assessing the effect of specific factors (IFNGγ and TGF-β1) from the TME on malignant cell states. Cells were cultured for 6 days before being collected, dissociated, and aliquoted for scRNA-seq in each of the following conditions: RP10, OWRNA, OWRNA with 50 ng/mL IFNGγ (Peprotech), and OWRNA with 5 ng/mL TGF-β1 (Peprotech) (Table S5). The cells cultured under the IFNGγ and TGF-β1 conditions were maintained in culture and harvested again for scRNA-seq 38 days after being introduced to these new media conditions. For these longer duration time points, cells were again passaged 6 days before collecting for scRNA-seq.
For scRNA-seq assessment of transcriptional states of the established pancreatic cancer cell line CFPAC1 under different media conditions, CFPAC1 cells were cultured in parallel in either standard cell line medium RP10 or complete organoid medium for 6 days before being collected, dissociated, and aliquoted for scRNA-seq.
Organoids were propagated in their respective media formulations for the indicated times (e.g., 3 weeks, 6 weeks) before performing drug sensitivity testing. After dissociation, cells were seeded into ultra-low attachment 384-well plates (Corning) at 1000 viable cells per well with 20 μL of their respective medium containing 10% Matrigel by volume. After 24 h, compounds were added to each well over 12-point dose curves along with DMSO controls using a Tecan D300e digital dispenser. A parallel untreated plate was harvested at this 24 h time point for growth rate correction. Drug- or DMSO-treated cells were cultured for 5 days before assessing for viability. Cell viability was measured by adding 20 uL of CellTiter-Glo 3D (Promega) to each well, incubating for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker, and measuring luminescence using an EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). Given plate well randomization, raw luminescence data were deconvoluted with an in-house Python script (Python v3.7.4). Each condition was tested in triplicate, and each dose point was normalized to DMSO controls to estimate relative viability. Growth rate correction was performed as previously described, with growth-rate adjusted dose response curves fit to a 3-parameter sigmoidal curve ( Hafner et al., 2016 33. Hafner, M. ∙ Niepel, M. ∙ Chung, M. ... Growth rate inhibition metrics correct for confounders in measuring sensitivity to cancer drugs Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :521-527 Google Scholar ). Each experiment was performed using cells cultured in paired basal (OWRNA+TGF-β1 or Minimal) and classical (OWRNA) media conditions, and independent experiments were performed as summarized in Figure S7A and Table S7. To quantify the relative sensitivity of basal versus classical models to a given compound, the difference in growth-rate adjusted areas over the curve (AOC) for organoids cultured in paired media conditions was calculated for each compound within each experiment, as illustrated in Figure 6 G and Figure S7A.
CFPAC1 cells were cultured in standard cell line medium RP10 or in complete organoid medium for 2 or 5 weeks before seeding for drug testing. Cells were dissociated and seeded into 384-well tissue culture plates (Greiner Bio-One) at 400 viable cells per well with 20 μL of their respective medium. Addition of compounds and sample harvesting were as above, except cell viability was measured by adding 20 uL of CellTiter-Glo (Promega) to each well and incubating for 15 min at room temperature on a shaker before measuring luminescence. Data analysis and dose response curve fitting were performed as described above.
ScRNA-seq processing followed the Seq-Well protocol, uniquely compatible with low-input samples ( Gierahn et al., 2017 29. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :395-398 Google Scholar ; Hughes et al., 2020 40. Hughes, T.K. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Gierahn, T.M. ... Second-Strand Synthesis-Based Massively Parallel scRNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Inflammatory Skin Pathologies Immunity. 2020; 53 :878-894 e877 Google Scholar ). Briefly, arrays were preloaded with RNA capture beads (Fisher Scientific/ChemGenes) and stored in quenching buffer until used. Prior to cell loading, arrays were resuspended in 5 mL RPMI-1640 medium (Thermo Fisher) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), hereafter referred to as RP10. After dissociation, single-cell suspensions were manually counted and diluted to 15,000 cells per 200 μL of RP10 when cell numbers allowed. Excess RP10 was aspirated from the array and cells were loaded onto arrays. Excess cells were washed off with PBS (4x5 mL), briefly left in RPMI (5 mL) and cell+bead pairs were sealed for 40 min at 37°C using a polycarbonate membrane (Fisher Scientific). Arrays were rocked in lysis buffer for 20 min and RNA was hybridized onto the beads for 40 min. Beads were removed and reverse transcription was performed overnight using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Fisher Scientific). Prior to sequencing, the beads underwent an exonuclease treatment (New England BioLabs) and second strand synthesis en masse followed by whole transcriptome amplification (WTA, Kapa Biosystems) in 1,500 bead reactions (50 μL). cDNA was isolated using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) at 0.6X SPRI (solid-phase reversible immobilization) followed by a 1X SPRI and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay kit (Thermo Fisher). Library preparation was performed using Nextera XT DNA tagmentation (Illumina FC-131-1096) and N700 and N500 indices specific to a given sample. Tagmented and amplified sequences were purified with a 0.6X SPRI, and cDNA was quantified (Qubit dsDNA High sensitivity assay kit, Thermo Fisher) and the base pair distribution measured (High sensitivity D5000 screen tape, Agilent). cDNA was loaded onto either an Illumina Nextseq (75 Cycle NextSeq 500/550 v2.5 kit) or Novaseq (100 Cycle NovaSeq 6000 S2 kit) at 2.4 pM. Regardless of platform, the paired end read structure was 21 bases (cell barcode and UMI) by 50 bases (transcriptomic information) with an 8 base pair (bp) custom read one primer. The demultiplex and alignment protocol was followed as previously described ( Macosko et al., 2015 48. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Google Scholar ). While Novaseq data were directly output as FASTQs, Nextseq BCL files were converted to FASTQs using bcl2fastq2. The resultant Nextseq and Novaseq FASTQs were demultiplexed by sample based on Nextera N700 and N500 indices. Reads were then aligned to the hg19 transcriptome using the cumulus/dropseq_tools pipeline on Terra maintained by the Broad Institute using standard settings ( Li et al., 2020 44. Li, B. ∙ Gould, J. ∙ Yang, Y. ... Cumulus provides cloud-based data analysis for large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :793-798 Google Scholar ).
RNA was obtained for bulk RNA-sequencing from established organoids using one of two approaches. Dissociated organoids were resuspended into cold Matrigel, added as droplets to tissue culture plates (Greiner BioOne), and allowed to polymerize for 30 min before addition of media. Organoids were grown for 14-21 days (until confluent) under these conditions with regular media changes. At the time of harvest, cells were washed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C, then lysed with Trizol (Invitrogen) before snap-freezing. To isolate RNA, we performed chloroform extraction with isolation of the aqueous phase before processing RNA as per protocols outlined in the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal kit.
In the second approach, used to obtain both RNA and DNA, dissociated organoids were resuspended in a solution of 10% Matrigel in complete organoid media (volume/volume) and cultured in ultra-low-attachment culture flasks (Corning). Organoids were grown for 14-21 days (until confluent) before pelleting, washing with cold PBS at 4°C until most Matrigel was dissipated, and then snap frozen. Cell pellets were homogenized using buffer RLT Plus (QIAGEN) and a Precellys homogenizer. Samples were then processed for both DNA extraction and RNA isolation as per the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal kit. Purified RNA and DNA were then submitted for sequencing by the Broad Institute Genomics Platform.
For bulk RNA-sequencing, total RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) and normalized to 5 ng/μL. Following plating, 2 μL of a 1:1000 dilution of ERCC RNA controls (Thermo Fisher) were spiked into each sample. An aliquot of 200 ng for each sample was transferred into library preparation which uses an automated variant of the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit. This method preserves strand orientation of the RNA transcript, and uses oligo dT beads to select mRNA from the total RNA sample followed by heat fragmentation and cDNA synthesis from the RNA template. The resultant 400 bp cDNA then goes through dual-indexed library preparation: ‘A’ base addition, adaptor ligation using P7 adapters, and PCR enrichment using P5 adapters. After enrichment, the libraries were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen (1:200 dilution; Thermo Fisher). After normalizing samples to 5 ng/μL, the set was pooled and quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Sequencing Platforms. The entire process was performed in 96-well format and all pipetting was done by either Agilent Bravo or Hamilton Starlet.
Pooled libraries were normalized to 2 nM and denatured using 0.1 N NaOH prior to sequencing. Flowcell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols using the NovaSeq 6000. Each run was a 101 bp paired-end with an eight-base index barcode read. Data were analyzed using the Broad Picard pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation ( https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ). FASTQ files were then processed as described below (see Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis).
For whole genome sequencing, 350 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented using a Covaris focused-ultrasonicator targeting 385bp fragments followed by size selection using SPRI cleanup. Library preparation was performed using a KAPA HyperPrep without amplification kit (KAPA Biosystems) with palindromic forked adapters with unique 8-base index sequences embedded within the adaptor (Roche). Libraries were then quantified using quantitative PCR (kit purchased from KAPA Biosystems) with probes specific to the adaptor ends on an Agilent Bravo liquid handling platform. Libraries were normalized to 2.2 nM, pooled into 24-plexes, combined with NovaSeq Cluster Amp Reagents DPX1, DPX2, and DPX3, and loaded into single lanes of a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell using a Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Cluster amplification and sequencing occurred utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis kits to produce 151bp paired-end reads. Output from Illumina software was processed by the Broad Picard pipeline ( https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ) to yield BAM files containing demultiplexed, aggregated aligned reads. BAM files were then processed as described below (see Mutation and CNV identification from bulk DNA-sequencing).
A multi-marker panel was developed to characterize malignant cell subtype in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 4 μm tissue sections using multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF). The panel comprises markers associated with either a basal (Keratin-17: Thermo Fisher MA513539 and S100A2: Abcam 109494) or classical (CLDN18.2: Abcam 241330, GATA6: Cell Signaling Technology 5851 and TFF1: Abcam 92377) subtype. Additionally, DAPI (Akoya Biosciences FP1490) was included for identification of nuclei and pan-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3: Dako M3515; C11: Cell Signaling Technology 4545) for identification of epithelial cells. Secondary Opal Polymer HRP anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibody (Dako ARH1001EA), Tyramide signal amplification, and Opal fluorophores (Akoya Biosciences) were used to detect primary antibodies (Keratin-17, Opal 520; S100A2, Opal 650; GATA6, Opal 540; CLDN18.2, Opal 570; TFF1, Opal 690; panCK, Opal 620).
These specific mIF markers were chosen for several reasons. KRT17, S100A2, and TFF1 are included in the original basal and classical RNA gene signatures ( Moffitt et al., 2015 50. Moffitt, R.A. ∙ Marayati, R. ∙ Flate, E.L. ... Virtual microdissection identifies distinct tumor- and stroma-specific subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :1168-1178 Google Scholar ). GATA6 is also a classical marker in an extended RNA gene panel and has been reported to be a potential driver of the classical phenotype ( Brunton et al., 2020 13. Brunton, H. ∙ Caligiuri, G. ∙ Cunningham, R. ..., Glasgow Precision Oncology Laboratory, Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative HNF4A and GATA6 Loss Reveals Therapeutically Actionable Subtypes in Pancreatic Cancer Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107625 Google Scholar ; Moffitt et al., 2015 50.

GATA6 Expression Distinguishes Classical and Basal-like Subtypes in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Clin Cancer Res. 2020; 26 :4901-4910 Google Scholar ). Single markers of S100A2 and GATA6 have also been used extensively in imaging experiments in past literature to mark cells in the basal or classical state, respectively ( Aung et al., 2018 4. Aung, K.L. ∙ Fischer, S.E. ∙ Denroche, R.E. ... Genomics-Driven Precision Medicine for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer: Early Results from the COMPASS Trial Clin.

TP63-Mediated Enhancer Reprogramming Drives the Squamous Subtype of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cell Rep. 2018; 25 :1741-1755 e1747 Google Scholar ). CLDN18.2 has also been associated with classical phenotypes, and antibody-based therapies targeting CLDN18.2 have been developed and tested in PDAC ( Wöll et al., 2014 77. Wöll, S. ∙ Schlitter, A.M. ∙ Dhaene, K. ... Claudin 18.2 is a target for IMAB362 antibody in pancreatic neoplasms Int. J. Cancer. 2014; 134 :731-739 Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the markers chosen for the mIF subtyping panel agreed with those selected as optimal markers to differentiate basal-like versus classical by an international panel of experts at a workshop on pancreatic cancer subtyping held at Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2019. Here, we used multiple markers for each state to provide greater confidence in cell state identification and to assess marker heterogeneity across our mIF cohort.
Prior to use in multiplex staining, primary antibodies were first optimized via immunohistochemistry on control tissue to confirm contextual specificity. Monoplex immunofluorescence and iterative multiplex fluorescent staining were then used to optimize staining order, antibody-fluorophore assignments and fluorophore concentrations. Multiplex staining was performed using a Leica BOND RX Research Stainer (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo, IL) with sequential cycles of antigen retrieval, protein blocking, primary antibody incubation, secondary antibody incubation, and fluorescent labeling. Overview images of stained slides were acquired at 10X magnification using a Vectra 3.0 Automated Quantitative Imaging System (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for multispectral image acquisition at 20X. After unmixing using a spectral library of single-color references, each image was inspected to ensure uniform staining quality and adequate tumor representation.
For targeted DNA-sequencing of clinical samples, next-generation sequencing using a custom-designed hybrid capture library preparation was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 2x100 paired-end reads, as previously described ( Garcia et al., 2017 26. Garcia, E.P. ∙ Minkovsky, A. ∙ Jia, Y. ... Validation of OncoPanel: A Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing Assay for the Detection of Somatic Variants in Cancer Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2017; 141 :751-758 Google Scholar ; Sholl et al., 2016 64. Sholl, L.M. ∙ Do, K. ∙ Shivdasani, P. ... Institutional implementation of clinical tumor profiling on an unselected cancer population JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e87062 Google Scholar ). Sequence reads were aligned to reference sequence b37 edition from the Human Genome Reference Consortium using bwa, and further processed using Picard (version 1.90, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ ) to remove duplicates and Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, version 1.6-5-g557da77) to perform localized realignment around indel sites. Single nucleotide variants were called using MuTect v1.1.45, insertions and deletions were called using GATK Indelocator. Copy number variants (CNV) and structural variants were called using the internally-developed algorithms RobustCNV and BreaKmer followed by manual review ( Abo et al., 2015 1. Abo, R.P. ∙ Ducar, M. ∙ Garcia, E.P. ... BreaKmer: detection of structural variation in targeted massively parallel sequencing data using kmers Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e19 Google Scholar ). RobustCNV calculates copy ratios by performing a robust linear regression against a panel of normal samples. The data were segmented using circular binary segmentation, and event identification was performed based on the observed variance of the data points ( Bi et al., 2017 11. Bi, W.L. ∙ Greenwald, N.F. ∙ Ramkissoon, S.H. ... Clinical Identification of Oncogenic Drivers and Copy-Number Alterations in Pituitary Tumors Endocrinology. 2017; 158 :2284-2291 Google Scholar ).
We computed the cytoband-level copy number calls and weighted (by length) average segment means across the covered regions of each cytoband using ASCETS ( Spurr et al., 2021 66. Spurr, L.F. ∙ Touat, M. ∙ Taylor, A.M. ... Quantification of aneuploidy in targeted sequencing data using ASCETS Bioinformatics. 2021; 37 :2461-2463 Google Scholar ). Briefly, cytobands were considered amplified/deleted if more than 70% of the covered regions had a log2 copy ratio of greater than 0.2/less than −0.2, and were considered neutral if more than 70% of the covered regions had a log2 copy ratio between −0.2 and 0.2.
For comparisons of driver mutation frequencies across patient tumors, cell lines, and organoid models, mutation and CNV calls for KRAS , TP53 , CDKN2A , and SMAD4 were either compiled from prior publications for patient samples and CCLE cell lines ( Aguirre et al., 2018 2. Aguirre, A.J. ∙ Nowak, J.A. ∙ Camarda, N.D. ... Real-time Genomic Characterization of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer to Enable Precision Medicine Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1096-1111 Google Scholar ; Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 15.

Ghandi, M. ∙ Huang, F.W. ∙ Jané-Valbuena, J. ... Next-generation characterization of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Nature. 2019; 569 :503-508 Google Scholar ) or generated from whole genome sequencing of organoid models. Organoid cohort variants were called from tumor/germline pairs using GATK (v.4.1.6.0, Paired tumor-control mode). Potential germline variants were additionally filtered using gnomAD (v2.1). Significance of short-nucleotide variants (SNVs) was determined using MuSiC2 (v0.2, q-value < 0.1). CNVs were initially called using GATK (v.4.1.6.0) followed by analysis with GISTIC (v2.0.23). Genomic alterations in KRAS , TP53 , CDKN2A , and SMAD4 were binarized by counting a gene in the given sample as altered if it contained at least one of the following alterations: missense mutation, nonsense mutation, splice site alteration, frameshift insertion or deletion, in-frame insertion or deletion, a high amplification, or a homozygous deletion. Statistical significance of alteration occurrence per gene across sample cohorts was determined using a Fisher’s exact test with multiple test correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (R v4.0.3).
FASTQs for bulk RNA expression profiles were downloaded from the relevant repository (TCGA, https://toil.xenahubs.net; PDAC Cell lines, https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle ), available in-house (Panc-Seq, metastatic PDAC), or generated for this study (organoid cohort) ( Aguirre et al., 2018 2.

Vivian, J. ∙ Rao, A.A. ∙ Nothaft, F.A. ... Toil enables reproducible, open source, big biomedical data analyses Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :314-316 Google Scholar ). All were processed using the same pipeline. Briefly, each sample’s sequences were marked for duplicates and then mapped to hg38 using STAR. After running QC checks using RNaseqQC, gene-level count matrices were generated using RSEM. Instructions to run the pipeline are given in the Broad CCLE github repository https://github.com/broadinstitute/ccle_processing . Length-normalized values (TPM) were then transformed according to log2(TPM+1) for downstream analysis. The entire dataset was scaled and centered to allow relative comparisons across sample types (e.g., tumors, organoids, and cell lines). Signature scores were computed as below (e.g., basal and classical; see Generation of expression signatures/scores below) ( Puram et al., 2017 60. Puram, S.V. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Parikh, A.S. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumor Ecosystems in Head and Neck Cancer Cell. 2017; 171 :1611-1624 e1624 Google Scholar ).
All single-cell data analysis was performed using the R language for Statistical Computing (v3.5.1). Each biopsy sample’s digital gene expression (DGE) matrix (cells x genes) was trimmed to exclude low quality cells (< 400 genes detected; < 1,000 UMIs; > 50% mitochondrial reads) before being merged together (preserving all unique genes) to create the larger biopsy dataset. The merged dataset was further trimmed to remove cells with > 8,000 genes which represent outliers and likely doublet cells. We also removed genes that were not detected in at least 50 cells. The same metrics were applied to the organoid single-cell cohort (see below). On a per cell basis, UMI count data was divided by total transcripts captured and multiplied by a scaling factor of 10,000. These normalized values were then natural log transformed for downstream analysis (i.e., log-normalized cell x gene matrix). Initial exploration of the data was performed using the R package Seurat (v2.3.4) and followed two steps: 1) SNN-guided quality assessment and 2) cell type composition determination. In step 1, we intentionally left cells in the DGE matrix of dubious quality (e.g., % mitochondrial reads > 25% but < 50%), performed PCA over the variable genes (n = 1,070 genes), and input the first 50 PCs (determined by Jackstraw analysis implemented through Seurat) to build an SNN graph and cluster the cells (res = 1; k.param = 40). The inclusion of poor-quality cells essentially acts as a variance “sink” for other poor-quality cells and they cluster together based on their shared patterns in quality-associated gene expression. This method helped to nominate additional low quality (e.g., defined exclusively by mitochondrial genes) or likely doublet cells (e.g., clusters defined by co-expression of divergent lineage markers) which were removed from the dataset (n = 1,678 cells). This led to an overall high-quality dataset of single-cells with a low overall fraction of mitochondrial reads (median = 0.09) for downstream analysis (Figure S1D).
Using the trimmed dataset, we proceeded to step 2 using a very similar workflow as above but with slightly altered input conditions for defining clusters. Here we used PCs 1-45 and their associated statistically significant genes for building the SNN graph and determining cluster membership (resolution = 1.2; k.param = 40). This identified the 36 clusters shown (visualized using t -SNE; perplexity, 40; iterations, 2,500) in Figure S1E. The expression of known markers was used to collapse clusters containing shared lineage information. For example, clusters 1, 2, and 4 all express high levels of macrophage markers— CD14 , FCGR3A (CD16) , CD68 —and were accordingly collapsed for this first pass analysis (Figure S1E,I). To aid our cell type identification, we performed an ROC test implemented in Seurat to confirm the specificity (power > 0.6) of the top marker genes used to discern the cell types. Combined with inferred CNV information (see below), this analysis confirmed the presence of 11 broad non-malignant cell types in our biopsy dataset (Table S2). Variation in the SNN graph parameters above did not strongly affect cell type identification.
To confirm the identity of the putative malignant clusters identified in Figure S1F, we estimated single-cell CNVs as previously described by computing the average expression in a sliding window of 100 genes within each chromosome after sorting the detected genes by their chromosomal coordinates ( Patel et al., 2014 57. Patel, A.P. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Trombetta, J.J. ... Single-cell RNA-seq highlights intratumoral heterogeneity in primary glioblastoma Science. 2014; 344 :1396-1401 Google Scholar ; Tirosh et al., 2016b 70. Tirosh, I. ∙ Venteicher, A.S. ∙ Hebert, C. ... Single-cell RNA-seq supports a developmental hierarchy in human oligodendroglioma Nature. 2016; 539 :309-313 Google Scholar ). We used all T/NK, Fib, Hep, and Endo cells identified above as reference normal populations for this analysis. Complete information on the inferCNV workflow used for this analysis can be found here https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV/wiki . To compare with bulk targeted DNA-sequencing, we collapsed individual probes to cytoband-level information (weighted average of log2 ratios across each cytoband, see above) within each sample. ScRNA-seq-inferred CNVs showed high concordance across samples with the bulk measurements and suggests that, at least by this metric, we are likely sampling the same dominant clones within sequential but distinct cores from each needle biopsy procedure (Figure S1G). For plotting CNV profiles in putative malignant versus normal cells (Figure S1H), we computed the average CNV signal for the top 5% of altered cells in each biopsy and correlated all cells in that biopsy to the averaged profile as has been previously described ( Tirosh et al., 2016a 69. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Google Scholar ). Relation of this correlation coefficient to the CNV score (mean square deviation from diploidy) in the single cells from each biopsy shows consistent separation of malignant from non-malignant cells, and, combined with membership in patient-specific SNN clusters, substantiates the identification of malignant cells in our dataset. One patient sample, PANFR0604, did not contain any malignant cells within the core biopsy used for scRNA-seq analysis.
The inferCNV workflow can be used to call subclonal genomic variation with high sensitivity and is described at https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV/wiki ( Fan et al., 2018 23. Fan, J. ∙ Lee, H.O. ∙ Lee, S. ... Linking transcriptional and genetic tumor heterogeneity through allele analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data Genome Res. 2018; 28 :1217-1227 Google Scholar ; Patel et al., 2014 57. Patel, A.P. ∙ Tirosh, I. ∙ Trombetta, J.J. ... Single-cell RNA-seq highlights intratumoral heterogeneity in primary glioblastoma Science. 2014; 344 :1396-1401 Google Scholar ; Tirosh et al., 2016b 70. Tirosh, I. ∙ Venteicher, A.S. ∙ Hebert, C. ... Single-cell RNA-seq supports a developmental hierarchy in human oligodendroglioma Nature. 2016; 539 :309-313 Google Scholar ). Briefly, we used a six-state Hidden Markov Model (i6-HMM) to predict relative copy number status (complete loss to > 3x gain) across putative altered regions in each cell. A Bayesian latent mixture model then evaluated the posterior probability that a given copy number alteration is a true positive. We set a relatively stringent cutoff for this step (BayesMaxPNormal = 0.2) to only include high probability alterations for downstream clustering. The results of this filtered i6-HMM output were then used to cluster the single cells using Ward’s method. We used inferCNV’s “random trees” method to test for statistical significance (p < 0.05, 100 random permutations for each split) at each tree bifurcation and only retained subclusters that had statistical evidence underlying the presumed heterogeneity. To track subclonal heterogeneity between biopsy and matched organoid cells in Figure 3 E and Figure S5E-K, the above workflow was implemented within each biopsy and the relevant matched organoid samples, essentially treating all cells as the same “tumor” and allowing the CNVs to determine cell sorting agnostic to sample-of-origin. The results of the HMM output can be used to infer gene-level information based on which genes are in the affected window. This (like the rest of the HMM workflow) is computed over groups of cells (e.g., samples or sub-clones) and used to map KRAS and other alterations to samples or sub-clones ( Figure 3 E, Figure S5E-K).
Detailed phenotyping required splitting the dataset into malignant and non-malignant fractions. After subsetting to only the malignant cells, we re-scaled the data and ran PCA including the first 35 PCs for SNN clustering and t- SNE visualization. This PCA was used to determine the PanNET identity for PANFR0580 (Figure S2A). After removing PANFR0580, we repeated the steps above and used this new PCA for the remainder of PDAC malignant cell analysis. Subsequent phenotyping for malignant cells is discussed below (Generation of expression signatures/scores). A similar approach was used for calling the non-malignant subsets in Figure 5 A. To determine the specific phenotypes within T/NK, macrophage, and mesenchymal populations, we separately subclustered these groups using PCs 1-20 and a resolution of 0.6 in each case. Of note, subclustering within the macrophages revealed a distinct cluster of cells co-expressing markers of both T/NK cells and macrophages (n = 491 cells). We discarded these cells as likely doublets, as have others, and re-ran the macrophage PCA and clustering ( Zhang et al., 2020 78. Zhang, L. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Skrzypczynska, K.M. ... Single-Cell Analyses Inform Mechanisms of Myeloid-Targeted Therapies in Colon Cancer Cell. 2020; 181 :442-459 e429 Google Scholar ; Zilionis et al., 2019 79. Zilionis, R. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species Immunity. 2019; 50 :1317-1334 e1310 Google Scholar ). These cells are included in the full dataset in case they are of interest to others. Each unbiased analysis helped to define the non-malignant phenotypes summarized in Figure 5 and Figure S6.
All expression scores were computed as previously described by taking a given input set of genes and comparing their average relative expression to that of a control set (n = 100 genes) randomly sampled to mirror the expression distribution of the genes used for the input ( Tirosh et al., 2016b 70. Tirosh, I. ∙ Venteicher, A.S. ∙ Hebert, C. ... Single-cell RNA-seq supports a developmental hierarchy in human oligodendroglioma Nature. 2016; 539 :309-313 Google Scholar ). While all scores were computed in the same way, choosing the genes for input varied. We have outlined the relevant approaches below. Where correlations (Pearson’s r) are performed over genes, we used the log-transformed UMI count data for each case. Unless otherwise noted, we selected the top 30 statistically significant genes for each signature (> 3 SD above the mean for shuffled data) for visualization and scoring.
We utilized previously established signatures for G1/S (n = 43 genes) and G2/M (n = 55 genes) to place each cell along this dynamic process ( Tirosh et al., 2016a 69. Tirosh, I. ∙ Izar, B. ∙ Prakadan, S.M. ... Dissecting the multicellular ecosystem of metastatic melanoma by single-cell RNA-seq Science. 2016; 352 :189-196 Google Scholar ). After inspecting the distribution of scores in the complete dataset, we considered any cell > 1.5 SD above the mean for either the G1/S or the G2/M scores to be cycling ( van Galen et al., 2019 72. van Galen, P. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ∙ Wadsworth Ii, M.H. ... Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals AML Hierarchies Relevant to Disease Progression and Immunity Cell. 2019; 176 :1265-1281 e1224 Google Scholar ).
We scored malignant cells within our single-cell cohort for expression of previously published signatures derived from bulk RNA-sequencing of primary and metastatic tumors.
We first scored each malignant single cell for the basal-like and classical genes identified by Moffitt et al., 2015 as these were well described by unbiased analysis in our data (PCA, Figure S2B,C, S3B). To derive refined single-cell basal (scBasal) and single-cell classical (scClassical) signatures using our malignant cohort and determine programs associated with these cell states, we correlated the aforementioned basal and classical scores to the entire gene expression matrix containing malignant cells and identified the 1,909 genes significantly associated with either subtype ( r > 0.1; > 3 SD above the mean for shuffled data, full data in Table S3). Biological pathway correlates for scBasal and scClassical are summarized in Figure S2E,F [WNT signaling ( Kim et al., 2017 42. Kim, J.H. ∙ Park, S.Y. ∙ Jun, Y. ... Roles of Wnt Target Genes in the Journey of Cancer Stem Cells Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017; 18 :1604 Google Scholar ); EMT ( Gröger et al., 2012 31. Gröger, C.J. ∙ Grubinger, M. ∙ Waldhör, T. ...

For visualization, we use the scBasal and scClassical genes (top 30 correlated genes for each). In Figure 2 C we score single cells for EMT ( Gröger et al., 2012 31. Gröger, C.J. ∙ Grubinger, M. ∙ Waldhör, T. ... Meta-analysis of gene expression signatures defining the epithelial to mesenchymal transition during cancer progression PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e51136 Google Scholar ) and the union of Hallmark and Reactome interferon response gene sets to show their divergence within cells expressing the scBasal state.
Ordering the cells by their polarization or “score difference,” simply the difference of the two scores, using these basal and classical scores related to PC1 and PC2 revealed a significant fraction of cells co-expressing intermediate levels of both cell states ( Figure 2 B, Figure S3A,B). Co-expressing cells showed associations with features across several additional PCs, but lacked a single dominant axis. To define a consensus set of genes that are preferentially expressed by coexpressing cells, we computed the Euclidean distance to the line representing equal basal and classical co-expression for each cell. To limit the influence of cell quality on this analysis and to specifically identify genes related to co-expression, we used cells from each group (basal, intermediate, and classical) with fractionally low mitochondrial genes (< 0.2) and non-zero basal or classical expression (basal or classical score > 0) and correlated their Euclidean distance (Figure S3C) to the entire gene expression matrix of malignant cells. Next, for each gene positively associated with this co-expressor state (Pearson’s r > 0), we subtracted the second highest correlation coefficient for each subtype-associated gene (basal and classical), and then re-ranked the matrix by this corrected value. This enriched for genes more specific to the co-expressor state by excluding those that were also associated with basal or classical programs. We then selected the 115 genes with a corrected correlation value > 0.1 (p < 0.00001 , shuffled data) as our intermediate co-expressor (IC) signature (Figure S3D, Table S3). Single cells were classified based on Euclidian distance to co-expression, where cells with Euclidian distance < 0.2 are defined as intermediate co-expressor and the remainder (Euclidian distance > 0.2) by their maximal of either scBasal or scClassical scores. We binned each organoid cell ( Figure 4 C,D) by its maximal expression for one of the 3 in vivo scores (scBasal, scClassical, or IC). Here a cell must be within 1 SD of the mean expression for a given subtype in vivo , else it was considered “organoid-specific” as this program was superimposed on all organoid cells, regardless of their subtype identity ( Figure 4 C). We used these classifications to summarize overall sample malignant cell composition and visualize the groups. Tumor heterogeneity measures were not significantly affected by changing these cutoffs.
TAM signatures were determined similar to above and previous work ( van Galen et al., 2019 72. van Galen, P. ∙ Hovestadt, V. ∙ Wadsworth Ii, M.H. ... Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals AML Hierarchies Relevant to Disease Progression and Immunity Cell. 2019; 176 :1265-1281 e1224 Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2020 78. Zhang, L. ∙ Li, Z. ∙ Skrzypczynska, K.M. ... Single-Cell Analyses Inform Mechanisms of Myeloid-Targeted Therapies in Colon Cancer Cell. 2020; 181 :442-459 e429 Google Scholar ; Zilionis et al., 2019 79. Zilionis, R. ∙ Engblom, C. ∙ Pfirschke, C. ... Single-Cell Transcriptomics of Human and Mouse Lung Cancers Reveals Conserved Myeloid Populations across Individuals and Species Immunity. 2019; 50 :1317-1334 e1310 Google Scholar ). Using PCA as an anchor (Figure S6C), we correlated expression within the TAM compartment to either FCN1 , SPP1 , or C1QC (top loaded genes on each relevant PC) and merged the resultant correlation coefficients for every detected gene to the 3 subtypes into one matrix (i.e., a 16,920 × 3 matrix). For each TAM type (i.e., vector of correlation coeffects to each marker), we first ranked the matrix by decreasing correlation coefficient, selected only the most significantly associated genes to that type ( r > 0.1; > 3 SD above the mean for shuffled data), subtracted the second highest correlation coefficient for each subtype-associated gene, and then re-ranked the matrix by this corrected value. We repeated this procedure for each TAM subtype independently. This ensures that the genes selected are specific to a given TAM subset and do not describe general TAM features. The top 30 genes for each were used for scoring and visualization (Table S2; Figure S6D).
Mesenchymal phenotypes were determined using a similar workflow. To examine mesenchymal heterogeneity, we removed a subset of adrenal endocrine cells (cluster 4, 40 cells; Figure 5 C) and then performed PCA on the remaining mesenchymal cells. PC1 was driven by spillover genes (likely contributed from ambient RNA) and lacked any coherent biological program and was not considered further. PCs 2 and 3 by contrast were consistent with variable mesenchymal (PC2) and inflammatory CAF (PC3) phenotypes. All these cells scored highly for previous myCAF gene expression programs so this phenotype did not fully explain the heterogeneity in mesenchymal cells. Again, using correlation, we determined the genes driving low PC2 scores (Fibroblast-like), and high PC2 scores (Pericyte-like), as well as those associated with the high PC3 scores (Inflammatory). As before, we used the top 30 genes within each subset for scoring and visualization. These same genes (Fibroblast-like and Pericyte-like) were used to examine bulk RNA-seq profiles and their difference in each sample quantifies which phenotype is favored in the bulk averages ( Figure 5 C).
We obtained the genes by cells matrix of normal pancreas progenitors ( Qadir et al., 2020 61. Qadir, M.M.F. ∙ Álvarez-Cubela, S. ∙ Klein, D. ... Single-cell resolution analysis of the human pancreatic ductal progenitor cell niche Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :10876-10887 Google Scholar ) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131886 . We clustered the original data and excluded a small subset of immune cells (CD45+). We then collapsed cell types from the original paper into broad categories (Pro-Acinar, Pro-ductal, Undifferentiated, and Mesenchymal) based on lineage marker expression. For analysis in Figure S3E we averaged the expression for scBasal, scClassical and IC genes in each group. For use in Figure S3F we generated signatures for each population using differential expression (FindAllMarkers function in Seurat using the “wilcox” option) and scored our single cells for these normal-derived signatures as above.
After applying similar quality metrics as above, we performed PCA, SNN clustering, and t -SNE embedding for 32,073 cells including organoid cells and all malignant cells from primary PDAC biopsies (PCs 1-50; resolution = 1.2; k.param = 45; perplexity = 45; max_iter = 2,500), and identified 39 total clusters. Organoids clustered separately from their matched biopsies, suggesting expression and/or CNV related drift in culture. Only two SNN clusters—clusters 4 and 32—were admixed by sample. We determined the specific gene expression programs in these two clusters via differential expression testing by Wilcoxon rank sum test (p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction; log(fold change) > 0.5). These comparisons were done in a “1 versus rest” fashion, testing for genes defining each cluster (4 or 32) compared to the entire dataset. Their expression profiles were consistent with non-malignant cell types, likely fibroblasts (cluster 32) and epithelial cells (cluster 4; Figure S5B,C).
To generate correlation distances for genotype and transcriptional cell state, each single cell in a biopsy-organoid pair was represented by two vectors of information: (i) a cell state vector containing expression values for scBasal and scClassical genes (n = 60 genes) and (ii) a genotype vector containing the average CNV score for each cytoband. The cell state and genotype distances between every single cell within a biopsy/early organoid pair was computed from these vectors using a correlation-based (Pearson’s r ) distance metric of the form d = (1- r )/2. This resulted in two distance matrices of n x n dimension where n is the total number of cells from each biopsy/early organoid sample pair. Values in Figure 3 A are computed by averaging the values for d between only early organoid and matched biopsy cells.
For CNV-confirmed malignant cells from each biopsy and its matched organoid (earliest passage), we used differential expression (Wilcoxon rank sum test; p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction; log(fold change) > 0.3) to understand the features lost from malignant cells in the in vivo setting and gained when transitioning into growth in organoid culture. We required any gene to be significantly differentially expressed in at least 3 model-biopsy comparisons to summarize the consistent changes. We repeated this same workflow for both organoid- and biopsy-specific genes (Table S4) outlined in Figure 3 C and Figure 4 G,H, respectively.
We determined the transcriptional-subtype-dependent composition of the TME ( Figure 5 E-I) following two steps. First, we computed the Simpson’s Index (measure of ecological diversity) using the count of each non-malignant cell type captured from each sample as input ( Figure 5 E,G) and correlated each biopsy’s diversity score to its scBasal versus scClassical commitment score. Importantly, the number of non-malignant cells captured from each biopsy was not associated with basal versus classical commitment score (r = 0.09). Next, to understand which cell types drive these differences, we computed the fractional representation for every non-malignant cell type in each core needle biopsy and determined their pairwise correlation distance (Pearson’s r ) followed by hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method (dendrogram in Figure 5 G). For both analyses we only used samples with > 200 non-malignant cells captured (Figure S6N).
Factors present in the TME but absent from organoid culture could originate from at least two sources, the malignant cells themselves (autocrine) or non-malignant cells in the local microenvironment (paracrine). We examined any gene with gene ontology annotations related to “cytokines,” “chemokines,” or “growth factors” and took the union of these lists, yielding 321 genes, 218 of which were detected in our dataset. For “autocrine” factors we performed differential expression between malignant cells binned as scBasal and scClassical, and then IC versus rest. A gene was considered differentially expressed if it passed a p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction and a log(fold change) > 0.2 in one of these comparisons. Genes were then assigned to subtypes based on the log fold change direction ( Figure 6 B, Table S6). “Paracrine” factors were determined in a similar manner with slight modifications. We grouped non-malignant cells into basal, classical or IC based on the average expression and clustering for malignant programs from their respective tumor samples (Figure S3G). We then assessed for differential expression between all cells from a given group and the rest using the same cutoffs as above and sorted factors into subtypes based on their log fold change directionality ( Figure 7 A, Table S6). We visualized which cell type contributed the highest average expression for each factor among the cell types from each of the respective cell state-specific TMEs ( Figure 7 B). We note that our use of “paracrine” and “autocrine” here is somewhat inexact as these secreted factors could act in either manner depending on the context. We merely use this nomenclature to reflect a “cancer cell centric” view, i.e., factors secreted by malignant cells are autocrine and those deriving from the TME are paracrine.
Supervised machine learning algorithms were applied for tissue and cell segmentation (inForm 2.4.1, Akoya Biosciences). Single-cell-level imaging data were exported and further processed and analyzed using R (v3.6.2). To assign phenotypes to individual malignant epithelial cells, mean expression intensity in the relevant subcellular compartment was first used to classify cells as positive or negative for each of the 5 markers. Combinatorial expression patterns for the five markers were then used to phenotypically classify cells as basal, classical, co-expressing / IC or marker negative (3 combinations of 2 basal markers, 7 combinations of 3 classical markers, 1 pan-marker negative, 21 combinations of co-expression of basal and classical markers, Figure S4A, Table S3). Tumor subtype composition was assessed by calculating the fraction of total malignant cells positive for each cell phenotype (Figure S4B, excluding pan-marker negative cells).
