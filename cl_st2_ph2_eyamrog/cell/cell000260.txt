Title: Allele-Specific Chromosome Removal after Cas9 Cleavage in Human Embryos


Abstract: Summary

Correction of disease-causing mutations in human embryos holds the potential to reduce the burden of inherited genetic disorders and improve fertility treatments for couples with disease-causing mutations in lieu of embryo selection. Here, we evaluate repair outcomes of a Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) introduced on the paternal chromosome at the EYS locus, which carries a frameshift mutation causing blindness. We show that the most common repair outcome is microhomology-mediated end joining, which occurs during the first cell cycle in the zygote, leading to embryos with non-mosaic restoration of the reading frame. Notably, about half of the breaks remain unrepaired, resulting in an undetectable paternal allele and, after mitosis, loss of one or both chromosomal arms. Correspondingly, Cas9 off-target cleavage results in chromosomal losses and hemizygous indels because of cleavage of both alleles. These results demonstrate the ability to manipulate chromosome content and reveal significant challenges for mutation correction in human embryos.

Section: Introduction

Double-strand breaks (DSBs) stimulate recombination between homologous DNA segments ( Jasin and Rothstein, 2013 19. Jasin, M. ∙ Rothstein, R. Repair of strand breaks by homologous recombination Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5 :a012740 Crossref Scopus (628) PubMed Google Scholar ). The targeted introduction of a DSB followed by recombination allows for the precise modification of genomes in model organisms and cell lines and might be useful for the correction of disease-causing mutations in the human germline ( NAS, 2017 31. NAS National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance The National Academies Press, 2017 Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar ). DSBs occur during meiosis and are repaired through recombination between homologous chromosomes, thereby ensuring genome transmission and genetic diversity in offspring. Recombination between homologs is thought to be uncommon in mitotic cells, but was recently suggested to be efficient in fertilized eggs: a DSB at the site of a disease-causing mutation on the paternal chromosome resulted in the loss of the mutation such that approximately half of the resulting pre-implantation embryos carried only the maternal wild-type allele ( Ma et al., 2017 26. Ma, H. ∙ Marti-Gutierrez, N. ∙ Park, S.W. ... Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos Nature. 2017; 548 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). The elimination was presumed to occur through use of the maternal genome as a repair template, resulting in what appeared as efficient correction of a pathogenic mutation on the paternal chromosome without mosaicism. This contrasts with frequent mosaicism in previous studies with different cells of the same embryo carrying various edited and non-edited alleles ( Liang et al., 2015 23. Liang, P. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Zhang, X. ... CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes Protein Cell. 2015; 6 :363-372 Crossref Scopus (846) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The correction of pathogenic mutations through interhomolog recombination with a lack of mosaicism, if confirmed, would have major advantages over other approaches, given that it does not require the introduction of exogenous nucleic acids and is limited to alleles already present in the human population. However, alternative interpretations of the results have been proposed, including the loss of the paternal allele through deletions, chromosome loss, or translocations ( Egli et al., 2018 11. Egli, D. ∙ Zuccaro, M.V. ∙ Kosicki, M. ... Inter-homologue repair in fertilized human eggs? Nature. 2018; 560 :E5-E7 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ; Adikusuma et al., 2018 3. Adikusuma, F. ∙ Piltz, S. ∙ Corbett, M.A. ... Large deletions induced by Cas9 cleavage Nature. 2018; 560 :E8-E9 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, many questions remain regarding the outcomes of a DSB in human embryos, which we sought to address.

Section: Results

To analyze outcomes of a Cas9 induced DSB, we recruited a patient with blindness as a sperm donor, carrying a homozygous G deletion mutation (rs758109813) in the gene encoding EYS associated with retinitis pigmentosa ( Abd El-Aziz et al., 2008 1. Abd El-Aziz, M.M. ∙ Barragan, I. ∙ O’Driscoll, C.A. ... EYS, encoding an ortholog of Drosophila spacemaker, is mutated in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa Nat. Genet. 2008; 40 :1285-1287 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 A). The EYS gene is located on chromosome 6, at 6q12 on the long arm, 3.5Mb from the centromere and the mutation results in the frameshift p.Pro2265Glnfs ∗ 46 (referred to as EYS 2265fs ) in exon 34. A guide RNA (gRNA) was designed to target the mutant but not the wild-type allele, which differs at the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. Pairing of the gRNA with the maternal allele at the 5′-AGG PAM site would require a 1 bp bulge, for which there is low tolerance ( Lin et al., 2014 24. Lin, Y. ∙ Cradick, T.J. ∙ Brown, M.T. ... CRISPR/Cas9 systems have off-target activity with insertions or deletions between target DNA and guide RNA sequences Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :7473-7485 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Cas9 cleavage site occurs proximal to EYS 2265fs , such that small indels will preserve the original G deletion SNP, which can distinguish modified alleles of paternal or maternal origin. Furthermore, the mutation is flanked by SNPs rs66502009 centromeric to the mutation, rs12205397 and rs4530841 telomeric to the mutation, which are amplified within a ∼1.5 kb PCR product, as well as by SNPs at ∼10 kb away. Thus, differing homozygous SNPs allow the evaluation of novel combinations of maternal and paternal alleles ( Table S1 ).
To determine the specificity of the gRNA for the mutant allele, we derived two embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines (eysES1 and eysES6) ( Figure 1 B). We transfected heterozygous ESCs for both the mutation site ( wt/EYS 2265fs ) and rs66502009 with Cas9-GFP and gRNA expression vectors to target the EYS 2265fs allele, and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells were harvested by flow cytometry. Using PCR and on-target next-generation sequencing (NGS) of seven independent biological samples consisting of a population of sorted cells, we scored for SNPs rs66502009 and EYS 2265fs to distinguish edited alleles of maternal or paternal origin. Fifty-one percent (199,780 of 392,672) were unmodified reads of the maternal EYS wt allele, whereas 49% were of paternal origin, of which 11% (range 5%–33%, n = 7) were edited to contain small indels on reads containing the EYS 2265fs and the rs66502009 paternal allele ( Figure 1 C; Table S2 ). No modified maternal reads with an EYS wt genotype were observed. This shows the specificity of the gRNA for the paternal allele in ESCs, resulting in efficient modification at EYS 2 265fs ( Table S2 ).
Analysis of the types of edits in NGS reads showed that the most frequent event (63.5% of edited reads) was the deletion of 5 bp on the paternal allele ( Figure 1 D), resulting in the restoration of the reading frame. Deletion of 8 bp (1%) and insertion of 1 bp (3.5%), both of which restore the reading frame, as well as reading frame restorations from other indels (4.5%) were also observed. Another 27.5% of reads carried indels without reading frame restoration. We also plated single cells for colony formation representing biologically independent editing events. In 245 clones (116 from eysES6 and 129 from eysES1), we identified 35 edited clones, 10 from eysES6 and 25 from eysES1 at a combined 14.3% editing efficiency. Thirty-four clones had indels in the paternal allele, whereas one had no detectable paternal allele at either rs66502009 or EYS 2265fs . Of the 34 clones with indels, the reading frame was restored in 27 (79.4%), primarily through a recurrent 5 bp deletion ( Figure 1 E). The placement of the gRNA results in cleavage between 2 identical regions of either 3 bp or 2 bp, defining sites of micro-homology ( Figure 1 F). Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is a repair pathway that uses one to a dozen base pairs of homology ( Sfeir and Symington, 2015 36. Sfeir, A. ∙ Symington, L.S. Microhomology-Mediated End Joining: A Back-up Survival Mechanism or Dedicated Pathway? Trends Biochem. Sci. 2015; 40 :701-714 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ). MMEJ at the EYS locus, as defined by the presence of microhomology, results in the deletion of either 5 bp or 8 bp, thereby restoring the reading frame, and generating novel alleles with deletions of either two amino acids (p.P2265-V2266) ( EYS ΔPV ) or three amino acids (p.Pro2265_Gln2267del) ( EYS ΔPVQ ). The deletion EYS ΔPV was the most common single repair product. No mitotic recombination between EYS 2265fs and rs66502009, which would be indicative of interhomolog repair, was observed in the 34 edited clones.
To determine editing outcomes in human embryos, we transferred EYS 2265fs mutant sperm through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) together with a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex of Cas9 nuclease and the gRNA targeting EYS 2265fs ( Figure 1 G). Alternatively, Cas9/RNP was injected after fertilization at the two-cell stage ( Figure 1 H). Embryos were biopsied for genotyping at the cleavage or the blastocyst stage, respectively. Injection at the MII stage resulted in embryos (n = 7) that appeared uniform, for either an indel (n = 3), or only the EYS wt allele (n = 4), whereas injection at the two-cell stage invariably resulted in mosaic embryos (n = 13) with up to three genotypes ( Table S1 ). Combining both data from MII and two-cell-stage injections, we found a total of 32 end-joining events on the paternal allele that were independent, because they occurred in different embryos, or differed molecularly within the same embryo ( Figure 1 I; Table S1 ). Of these, 14 were MMEJ events, 12 of which resulted in a 5 bp deletion and 2 in an 8 bp deletion ( Figure 1 F). Furthermore, of a total of 18 independent nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) events, defined by the absence of microhomology, 2 restored the reading frame through a 1 bp insertion, resulting in EYS PV > QL (p.Pro2265_Val2266insGlnLeu) ( Figure 1 F). Importantly, in one embryo derived from MII injection, all blastomeres (4 out of 4) showed uniform reading frame restoration through MMEJ, whereas the other 2 embryos had frameshift indels ( Table S1 ).
Although DSB repair in ESCs and embryos both resulted in frequent indels, there was a significant difference in editing outcomes: considering both MII- and two-cell-stage injected embryos, 17 of 20 embryos contained cells with only an EYS wt allele and the flanking maternal rs66502009 allele, representing at least 17 independent events; 12 embryos contained cells with indels and 9 embryos contained both types of cells. Therefore, the loss of the paternal allele was as or more common than a heterozygous indel in embryos ( Figure 1 J), whereas only a single event (2.8%) was seen in Cas9-treated ESC clones. These results indicate cell type differences in DSB repair and/or cell survival after a chromosome break.
EYS wt -only detection could be due to unrepaired paternal alleles, undetectably modified paternal alleles ( Adikusuma et al., 2018 3. Adikusuma, F. ∙ Piltz, S. ∙ Corbett, M.A. ... Large deletions induced by Cas9 cleavage Nature. 2018; 560 :E8-E9 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kosicki et al., 2018 21. Kosicki, M. ∙ Tomberg, K. ∙ Bradley, A. Repair of double-strand breaks induced by CRISPR-Cas9 leads to large deletions and complex rearrangements Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :765-771 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ), or interhomolog repair, as previously suggested ( Ma et al., 2017 26. Ma, H. ∙ Marti-Gutierrez, N. ∙ Park, S.W. ... Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos Nature. 2017; 548 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Adikusuma and colleagues captured deletions of several hundred base pairs in 45% of mouse embryos by using a PCR assay spanning 1.6 kb flanking the Cas9 cut site. Similarly, the PCR assays spanning 1.5 kb used here ( Figure 1 A) would capture deletions of this type; however, the longest deletion found in 20 embryos on the paternal allele at the Cas9 cut site was 8 bp ( Table S1 ). Although this does not rule out all deletions, deletions of a few hundred base pairs as found in mice do not account for the frequent EYS wt genotypes.
To better understand the origin of EYS wt genotypes, we analyzed events in the first cell cycle after MII injection of sperm and Cas9 RNP in either androgenetic zygotes with only a paternal genome, or zygotes with two pronuclei (2PN). These approaches also lead to a more conclusive determination of mosaicism, which is more reliably achieved when there is just a single cell and genome.
We first interrogated repair products in the absence of the maternal genome. The maternal genome was removed and discarded, and the EYS 2265fs mutant sperm was injected together with Cas9 RNP targeting the mutation site ( Figure 2 A). At 20 h after ICSI, embryos with a single paternal pronucleus were harvested for analysis ( Figure 2 B). Of eight androgenetic embryos from two different oocyte donors (five and three per donor), three contained a single small indel ( Figure 2 C), indicating end joining repair within the first cell cycle, whereas two contained two different modified alleles, indicative of repair after the onset of DNA replication but prior to mitosis. Of the remaining three, one was unmodified and two failed to genotype at rs758109813 ( Figure 2 D; Table S1 ).
To determine whether the maternal genome can provide a repair template for the paternal genome, we performed ICSI with Cas9 RNP in nucleated oocytes ( Figure 2 E). We first controlled for accuracy of genotyping in zygotes with both alleles by amplifying single cells from embryos (n = 3) and single ESCs (n = 4) containing both genomes without exposure to Cas9. All cells showed heterozygosity at the mutation site and at rs66502009, demonstrating that both alleles were reliably detected ( Table S1 ). We next analyzed 2PN zygotes 20 h after fertilization/Cas9 RNP injection. Of three zygotes, two showed only maternal alleles at the mutation site as well as at flanking SNPs within a ∼22 kb window on either side ( Figure 2 F), whereas one showed an edited paternal allele ( Figure 2 G; Table S1 ). To account for the possibility of allele dropout in Sanger sequencing, on-target NGS showed no significant reads of either the paternal mutation or the flanking paternal SNP at rs66502009 ( Table S2 ).
To directly determine whether recombination between paternal and maternal chromosomes could give rise to EYS wt/wt embryos, we isolated individual paternal and maternal nuclei from zygotes at 20 h after ICSI and amplified them separately ( Figure 2 H). Genotyping at rs1631333 at 573 kb centromeric to the Cas9 cut site confirmed paternal or maternal origin ( Figure S1 ). Of the eight paternal nuclei, five contained an indel on the paternal allele, whereas one was unmodified and two failed to genotype at the mutation site, but were successfully genotyped at flanking SNPs 10 kb away on both sides of the break ( Figure 2 I–2K; Table S1 ). All 5 genomes with indels showed only a single modification. Zygotes with an EYS wt genotype in the maternal nucleus and no detectable EYS allele in the paternal nucleus would appear as EYS wt when analyzed without physical separation of the two nuclei (as seen in Figure 2 F). Because none of the zygotes contained a paternal genome with a wild-type EYS allele, there was no evidence for repair from the maternal genome among these eight zygotes.
Considering all 19 zygotes (20 h after ICSI and Cas9 RNP), 11 of the paternal genomes were detectably modified by end joining during this first cell cycle, and two were unmodified ( Figure 2 L; Table S1 ). Editing predominantly gave rise to a single modification (9 out of 11 events) and thus non-mosaic zygotes, whereas 2 were mosaic. Although these mosaics were seen in androgenetic zygotes, they show that MII injection results predominantly, but not exclusively, in uniform editing.
The remaining 6 embryos had no detectable paternal allele at rs758109813. To determine the cause of paternal allelic loss, we also amplified and genotyped flanking SNPs. Neither of two androgenotes showed amplification of flanking SNPs 10 kb distal and proximal to the Cas9 cleavage site and might therefore instead be because of amplification failure or extensive resection of the DSB. The two zygotes with only an EYS wt genotype at rs758109813 as well as the two paternal nuclei extracted from 2PN zygotes but without an EYS on target genotype showed amplification at all flanking SNPs 10 kb away from the Cas9 cut site and were therefore successfully amplified ( Table S1 ).
To more comprehensively analyze chromosome content, we performed genome-wide SNP array analysis. We first analyzed genomic DNA from sperm and oocyte donors to identify homozygous donor-specific alleles. Genomic DNA of an egg donor ( Figure S1 A) and genomic DNA of the semen donor ( Figure S1 B) showed homozygous alleles of maternal and paternal origin along chromosome 6. Only SNPs that were homozygous within the donors but different between donors were subsequently used for analysis.
We performed SNP array analysis of zygotes after Cas9 RNP injection at fertilization. Zygote 1 containing an EYS wt genotype was successfully analyzed by using SNP arrays and signal from paternal and maternal alleles was seen all along chromosome 6 on both the p and q arms ( Figure 2 M). We also analyzed eight paternal and seven maternal nuclei isolated from eight 2PN zygotes ( Figure 2 N). Isolated individual nuclei uniformly showed either paternal or maternal origin, respectively, of chromosome 6 and other autosomes (n = 326 chromosomes) ( Figures 2 N and S1 C). No exchange of chromosomes of paternal and maternal origin was observed ( Tables S3 and S4 ). Therefore, paternal and maternal genomes remain physically separate during the first interphase, regardless of the presence of a DSB. The lack of a paternal genotype at EYS rs758109813 in two paternal nuclei and in zygote 1 was not due to loss of the paternal chromosome. Importantly, maternal alleles were detected in all (11 out of 11) zygotes, suggesting that the loss of the paternal allele is primarily biological, although technical causes cannot formally be excluded for two androgenetic zygotes without amplification of neighboring alleles.
The loss of the paternal EYS allele from six zygotes might be because of an unrepaired DSB, which prevents amplification by PCR primers flanking the cut site ( Figure 2 O). Alternatively, a large insertion, deletion, or translocation would also prevent amplification of alleles rs66502009 to rs4530841 contained within the same PCR product. These different scenarios result in different outcomes in developing embryos. In the case of an unrepaired break, chromosomal arms missegregate in mitosis. An insertion or deletion would be compatible with normal chromosome segregation patterns, whereas a translocation would affect two or more chromosomes.
To characterize the outcomes of a Cas9-induced DSB and the developmental potential of edited zygotes, we allowed them to develop to the cleavage or blastocyst stage for biopsy, genotyping, stem cell derivation, and karyotyping ( Figure 3 A). Of 18 oocytes injected with sperm and Cas9 RNP at the MII stage, 10 developed to the blastocyst stage (56%), which is within the normal frequency ( Fogarty et al., 2017 13. Fogarty, N.M.E. ∙ McCarthy, A. ∙ Snijders, K.E. ... Genome editing reveals a role for OCT4 in human embryogenesis Nature. 2017; 550 :67-73 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ma et al., 2017 26. Ma, H. ∙ Marti-Gutierrez, N. ∙ Park, S.W. ... Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos Nature. 2017; 548 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the cleavage stage, we biopsied individual blastomeres from 4 embryos, and at the blastocyst stage, we performed trophectoderm (TE) biopsies consisting of 5–10 cells from 3 embryos ( Figure 3 B). At the cleavage stage (n = 4 embryos), 2 embryos only had the maternal EYS wt allele and flanking maternal SNPs, and 2 had indels on the paternal allele ( Table S1 ). At the blastocyst stage (n = 3 embryos), 2 showed only the maternal EYS wt allele ( Table S1 ), which was confirmed by on-target NGS and allelic discrimination qPCR, and one showed an indel ( Tables S2 and S5 ). Therefore, of 7 embryos, 4 (57%) had only a detectable EYS wt allele ( Figure 3 B).
To generate ESCs with an EYS wt -only genotype, 10 blastocyst-stage embryos were used for ESC derivation. Of these 10, 3 had been genotyped by Sanger sequencing, 2 of which were EYS wt blastocysts. Five karyotypically normal ESC lines were obtained ( Figure S2 ; Table S3 ), but despite the presence of a distinct inner cell mass and attachment to a feeder layer, ESC lines were not obtained from the two EYS wt blastocysts, and cell death was observed within 3–4 days. Four cell lines showed an indel at the paternal mutation site, whereas one maintained an unmodified paternal allele ( Figure 3 B; Table S1 ). Thus, none of the ESC lines contained two wild type alleles, indicating no evidence for interhomolog repair. Combined with the 8 2PN zygotes tested for the presence of two wild type alleles ( Figure S1 ; Table S1 ), none of the 13 samples showed interhomolog repair after MII injection.
The lack of evidence for interhomolog recombination suggests other explanations are likely for the presence of maternal only sequences at the mutation site. The loss of the paternal allele in embryos, together with a lack of their representation in ESC lines with only the EYS wt allele, led us to investigate whether chromosomal changes accounted for the loss.
To evaluate chromosome content in pre-implantation embryos, we first analyzed ESCs. ESC lines showed heterozygosity for parent-of-origin-specific SNPs along the entire chromosome 6 and throughout the genome because of the presence of maternal and paternal chromosomes ( Figure S2 ; Table S3 ). We controlled for the effect of genome amplification used in embryo analysis by examining single, heterozygous human ESCs. Amplification of genomic DNA can alter the normal allelic ratio from 1:1 because of stochasticity. In both single amplified ESCs and trophectoderm biopsies of embryos that gave rise to the stem cell lines, heterozygous alleles were identified along the entire chromosome 6 and throughout the genome, albeit at a wider distribution than when a large number of cells are used (compare Figure S2 B with Figure S2A with Figure S2C). For some SNPs, only one of the alleles reaches significance of detection and thus, in addition to heterozygous alleles (blue dots), paternal alleles (green dots) and maternal alleles (red dots) are detected ( Figure S1 C; Table S4 ). These controls provide a reference for the expected appearance of amplified genomic DNA in embryo samples.
We then examined trophectoderm biopsies from the three blastocyst embryos that had been genotyped at EYS by Sanger sequencing. Embryo D, which carried a heterozygous indel and gave rise to ESC line eysES9 ( Table S1 ), showed heterozygosity and uniform signal intensity across chromosome 6 ( Figure 3 C). In contrast, one of the two EYS wt blastocysts that had failed to develop a stem cell line (embryo E) showed loss of heterozygosity spanning the region from the Cas9 cut site at EYS to the telomere of paternal chromosome 6 ( Figure 3 D). The loss of heterozygosity at the EYS break site was paralleled by a loss of signal intensity because of copy number loss ( Figure 3 D). Therefore, loss of genetic material, rather than break-induced replication from the paternal centromere to the telomere is responsible for the absence of paternal SNPs. Furthermore, the other EYS wt blastocyst (embryo F), which also failed to give rise to an ESC line, showed monosomy for the maternal chromosome 6, indicating loss of the entire paternal chromosome 6 ( Figure 3 E). Both blastocysts were euploid for other autosomes ( Table S3 ).
To understand the process of chromosome loss, we performed analysis of chromosome content in blastomeres at the cleavage stage. We harvested 23 individual blastomeres from 4 embryos ( Table S1 ). Two cleavage-stage embryos had a maternal-only genotype at EYS , which was confirmed by on-target NGS ( Table S2 ). Four of six blastomeres with an EYS wt Sanger genotype from one embryo (embryo 1) were analyzed by using SNP arrays and showed segmental rearrangement of paternal chromosome 6. Of the four cells, three had losses of chromosome 6q distal to the Cas9 cleavage site, as seen by SNP array, copy number analysis and by Sanger genotyping of parent-of-origin-specific SNPs ( Figure S3 A; Table S1 ). In one cell, chromosome 6q was gained, resulting in an overrepresentation of paternal SNPs distal of EYS , and an increase in copy number. In this cell, paternal SNPs were present at rs34809101 and rs6936438, 10 kb distal of the Cas9 cleavage site ( Figure S3 A, cell 4). Therefore, the loss of the paternal EYS 2265fs allele can occur both through segmental losses as well as through segmental gains. These segments might not be joined with the centromere-containing p arm, and therefore missegregate in mitosis and are not detectable with primers flanking the cut site ( Figure S3 A).
The other embryo (embryo C) had the EYS wt allele at the mutation site in five blastomeres, two additional blastomeres had no on target genotype, and one had an indel on an EYS wt (maternal) allele ( Figure S3 B; Table S1 ). Again, we found complementary losses and gains of paternal chromosome 6q. Four cells were monosomic for the maternal chromosome, one cell contained a gain of paternal chromosome 6q, and two cells contained only paternal chromosome 6p and were chaotic aneuploid. Therefore, Cas9 cleavage resulted in variable chromosome 6 content in cells with the same genotype EYS wt . As in embryo 1, a paternal EYS allele was not detected in blastomeres containing only chromosome segments.
Blastomeres from the remaining two cleavage stage embryos showed repair by end joining of the paternal allele. One embryo (embryo B) showed a uniform deletion of 5 bp in all (4 out of 4) blastomeres. In the other embryo, 4 out of 5 blastomeres (embryo A) showed a net 2 bp indel and one cell showed a wild-type only genotype by Sanger sequencing, as well as by on-target NGS ( Table S1 ). The one EYS wt blastomere had monosomy 6 because of paternal loss. Blastomeres from the eight EYS wt/indel cells showed heterozygosity and balanced copy number, except for one cell with a segmental deletion at chromosome 6q21 on the maternal chromosome, which is 40 Mb telomeric of the EYS locus ( Figure S4 ). Three of the embryo A blastomeres had numerous aneuploidies on other autosomes ( Table S3 ), which might be spontaneous and representative of the frequent mitotic abnormalities in human cleavage stage embryos ( Vanneste et al., 2009 39. Vanneste, E. ∙ Voet, T. ∙ Le Caignec, C. ... Chromosome instability is common in human cleavage-stage embryos Nat. Med. 2009; 15 :577-583 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ottolini et al., 2017 34. Ottolini, C.S. ∙ Kitchen, J. ∙ Xanthopoulou, L. ... Tripolar mitosis and partitioning of the genome arrests human preimplantation development in vitro Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :9744 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In summary, of the 14 biopsies (12 blastomeres and 2 trophectoderm biopsies) with EYS wt genotypes from 5 different embryos after Cas9 RNP injection at MII, all showed segmental or whole-chromosome aneuploidies of paternal chromosome 6 ( Table S1 ). Thus, a common outcome of Cas9 RNP injections into MII oocytes is loss of paternal alleles because of segmental and whole-chromosome loss, which appear as EYS wt cells in embryos characterized by on target sequencing ( Table S1 ). Altogether, the loss of the paternal EYS 2265fs allele after Cas9 injection at fertilization occurs through aneuploidy, not efficient interhomolog repair.
An obstacle to repairing the paternal allele through recombination between homologous chromosomes at the zygote stage is that paternal and maternal genomes are in two separate nuclei. To determine whether the maternal genome could provide a template for DSB repair when present with the paternal genome in the same nucleus, we injected Cas9 RNP into both cells of 13 two-cell stage embryos heterozygous for the EYS mutation and flanking SNPs ( Figure 4 A). Single blastomeres were harvested and amplified from 9 cleavage stage embryos, and 4 embryos were analyzed at the morula and blastocyst stages on day 5 after fertilization by using biopsies of multiple cells ( Figure 4 A). Embryos dissociated to single blastomeres showed mosaicism for multiple alleles ( Figure 4 B). Of a total of 45 genotyped single cells and day 5 biopsies, 25 (55%) showed an EYS wt genotype at the mutation site and 12 (32%) showed end-joining events on the paternal allele; in the remaining, 3 showed end-joining events on the maternal allele, 3 showed no change, and 2 had no allele call even as flanking SNPs were detected ( Figure 4 D; Table S1 ).
Of the 25 samples with an EYS wt genotype, 22 were maternal only at SNPs contained within the same PCR product (rs66502009 and rs12205397), 13 of which were maternal only also at flanking SNPs 10 kb proximal and 10 kb distal of the Cas9 cleavage site, whereas the remaining 9 showed heterozygosity at one or both 10 kb flanking sites ( Table S1 ). Because Sanger sequencing is susceptible to allele-dropout, we performed on-target NGS on EYS wt blastomeres from five embryos and confirmed the EYS wt genotype ( Figure 4 C; Table S1 ). Paternal reads were detected in one morula (morula 10), at reduced representation compared with that of the maternal EYS wt allele because of mosaicism ( Figure 4 C).
Interestingly, of the 25 EYS wt samples, 3 cells from 3 different embryos showed flanking paternal SNPs, but no maternal SNPs on either side of the same PCR product ( Figures S5 A and S5B). NGS only detected a paternal allele at rs66502009 and only the maternal EYS wt allele at rs758109813 ( Figure 4 D; Table S1 ). By array analysis, SNPs of both maternal and paternal origin were detected throughout chromosome 6, demonstrating that this cell contained both paternal and maternal chromosome 6 ( Figure S5 C). The novel linkages of maternal and paternal SNPs, present at a frequency of ∼7% (3 out of 45), represent possible interhomolog repair events, although they are not readily explained through a simple gene conversion.
In 3 cells, we observed heterozygous indels on an allele with a wild-type SNP rs758109813. One such edit had also been observed in the MII injections in embryo C. Therefore, Cas9 RNP cut the maternal allele with an efficiency of 4 out of 84 (∼5%), whereas in the same samples, editing of the paternal allele was 78 out of 84 (93%). Thus, the presence of the suboptimal PAM site allowed some cleavage of the maternal allele in the embryo, though with much lower efficiency than on the paternal allele.
To determine whether EYS wt blastomeres were caused by paternal chromosome loss, we tested blastomeres of two embryos after a single mitosis post-Cas9/RNP injection for heterozygosity by using SNP arrays ( Figures 4 E–4G and S6 ). In one embryo, two sister blastomeres with an EYS wt genotype showed loss of chromosome 6q and its sister cell showed monosomy 6 because of loss of the paternal chromosome ( Figures 4 F and 4G).
In the other embryo analyzed after a single mitosis, we found complementary loss of either paternal chromosomal arm 6q or 6p plus the centromere with breakpoints at the EYS locus ( Figures S6 A–S6D). The long arm that was lost in one blastomere was gained in the other, as seen by an increased representation of paternal SNPs in one of the two sister blastomeres on chromosome 6q ( Figure S6 C) and reciprocal copy number gain and loss on the q or the p arm ( Figures S6 B and S6C). In addition, one cell contained only chromosome 6p, no signal from chromosome 6q, and no other genomic DNA, and therefore is a cytoplasmic fragment ( Figure S6 D; Table S3 ). The exclusion of chromosomal arms in cytoplasmic fragments might be one mechanism of their elimination from the embryo. The reciprocal losses and gains of chromosomal arms were also observed by Sanger sequencing of rs1631333, located 573 kb from the Cas9 cleavage site toward the centromere ( Figures S6 B–S6D; Table S1 ). Loss of heterozygosity across the centromere as in Figure S5 B is inconsistent with copy-neutral mitotic recombination, providing further support that the loss of paternal alleles occurred through the loss of genetic material rather than interhomolog recombination. Thus, Cas9 RNP injection at the two-cell stage can result in the loss of the paternal chromosome through missegregation in mitosis.
Considering karyotypes of all cells and biopsies from embryos injected with Cas9 RNP at fertilization or at the 2-cell stage, 19 out of 20 with loss of EYS 2265fs showed paternal specific abnormalities on chromosome 6. The one exception was a blastomere after two-cell-stage injection that contained flanking paternal alleles and might be due to interhomolog repair ( Figure S5 ). Prior to the first cell division, the loss of paternal genotype might be due to an unrepaired or misrepaired break in a nucleus with a normal karyotype ( Figure 2 O), resulting in aneuploidies after mitosis. Aneuploidies of chromosome 6 were significantly enriched on the paternal chromosome for both segmental errors as well as whole chromosome loss ( Figure 4 G). In contrast, aneuploidies acquired after fertilization on the other autosomes equally affected both paternal and maternal chromosomes (50% versus 50%) ( Figure 4 G, Table S3 ). Thus, Cas9-induced cleavage in human embryos results in allele-specific segmental and whole chromosome errors beyond what is observed in normal development.
Spontaneous aneuploidies are common in human cleavage-stage embryos ( Vanneste et al., 2009 39. Vanneste, E. ∙ Voet, T. ∙ Le Caignec, C. ... Chromosome instability is common in human cleavage-stage embryos Nat. Med. 2009; 15 :577-583 Crossref Scopus (653) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kort et al., 2016 20. Kort, D.H. ∙ Chia, G. ∙ Treff, N.R. ... Human embryos commonly form abnormal nuclei during development: a mechanism of DNA damage, embryonic aneuploidy, and developmental arrest Hum. Reprod. 2016; 31 :312-323 PubMed Google Scholar ; Ottolini et al., 2017 34. Ottolini, C.S. ∙ Kitchen, J. ∙ Xanthopoulou, L. ... Tripolar mitosis and partitioning of the genome arrests human preimplantation development in vitro Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :9744 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our dataset, 4 of 11 embryos injected at the MII stage with Cas9 RNP contained aneuploidies on autosomes other than chromosome 6, which could be spontaneous or Cas9 induced if off-target sites are present. We focused on segmental errors to evaluate off-target aneuploidies, given that the genomic coordinates of chromosomal break points can be correlated with the location of predicted off-target sites.
Segmental errors of either paternal or maternal origin were found at 11 different sites ( Figure 5 A). All but two of the segmental errors were found only once, suggesting they occurred in a single cell during the second or third cell cycle after fertilization and Cas9 injection. Five mapped to common fragile sites. For instance, one site on the maternal chromosome 6q mapped to FRA6F telomeric of EYS and was found in one of five cells of an embryo injected with Cas9 RNP at fertilization ( Figure S4 A). However, segmental loss on chromosome 16q23.1 was recurrent in three of seven cleavage stage embryos ( Figure 5 A; Table S1 ).
To determine concordance with Cas9 off-target sites, we evaluated nine predicted off-target candidate sites for indels. One gRNA had two mismatches ( Figure 5 B), whereas others had three or more ( Table S6 ). PCR and Sanger sequencing in four stem cell lines and three blastocysts revealed that only the site with two mismatches on chromosome 16q23.1 at location chr16:74344276 (hg37), showed indels in four of seven samples ( Table S6 ). The site, which is present on both maternal and paternal chromosomes, is concordant with the cytological location of recurrent segmental errors: chromosomal break sites in seven different cells mapped to chr16 between 74 Mb and 74.5 Mb at 16q22.3-23.1. No other predicted off-target sites were concordant with the location of singular segmental errors, which were therefore considered spontaneous ( Figure 5 A). The off-target site on chromosome 16 was then further examined for indels in a total of 27 cleavage stage blastomeres of 7 embryos. Off-target indels were identified in 24 blastomeres, one of which carried 2 different indels ( Figure 5 C; Table S1 ). In cleavage-stage embryos derived after MII injection of Cas9 RNP, three out of four embryos showed mosaic indels and just one was uniform ( Figure 5 D; Table S1 ).
To determine the timing of off-target activity, we analyzed isolated pronuclei containing either a maternal or a paternal genome at 20 h after fertilization and Cas9 RNP injection ( Figures 2 H and 5 E). Of the 16 pronuclei, 5 showed heterozygous indels, 9 were unmodified, and 2 were undetectable ( Figure 5 E). Off-target indels included 5 bp and 8 bp deletions through MMEJ ( Table S1 ). Interestingly (5 out of 5) modified nuclei were heterozygous at the 1-cell stage, carrying either an indel/wt allele (2 nuclei), or two different indels (3 nuclei), resulting from independent end-joining events on sister chromatids ( Figure 5 E). Thus, Cas9 cleavage at the off-target location occurred predominantly after the first S-phase, resulting in mosaicism.
Segmental chromosomal losses at chromosome 16q23.1 were found in 7 of 33 blastomeres and blastocyst biopsies (21%) with chromosme 16 signal ( Figure 5 C). One embryo, embryo one, derived after Cas9 RNP injection at the two-cell stage, carried different modifications on all four sister chromatids in both daughter cells ( Figure 5 F). One cell showed maternal segmental loss and an indel on the paternal allele, whereas the other carried paternal segmental loss and a different indel on the maternal allele. The parental origin of the chromosomes with the segmental error is identified through homozygous parent-of-origin-specific SNPs. Cells with an indel and a segmental loss on the other chromosome appeared homozygous by Sanger sequencing but are hemizygous ( Figure 5 F). Mosaic chromosome content and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 16 was also seen in embryo C, obtained after MII injection of Cas9 RNP ( Figure S7 ). All blastomeres carried a 6 bp insertion on one chromosome, which appeared heterozygous in some cells, and homozygous in others, depending on chromosomal content. Altogether, off-target activity of Cas9 results in both indels and segmental chromosomal changes.

Section: Discussion

The genome bestowed at fertilization determines much of our health as adults. Although genetic mutations might be corrected after birth by somatic gene therapy, the efficacy of this approach is dependent on the number of cells that can be edited, the ability to reverse damage that has already occurred, and disease-causing mutations will still be passed on to the next generation. In contrast, gene editing in the embryo will alter the genome of all cells, including the germline. An important requirement for clinical application is the ability to predict outcomes. Mosaicism prevents inferring the genotype of the fetus from a biopsy and is thus incompatible with clinical use. Therefore, the application of CRISPR/Cas9 prior to the first DNA replication in the embryo is meaningful ( Ma et al., 2017 26. Ma, H. ∙ Marti-Gutierrez, N. ∙ Park, S.W. ... Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos Nature. 2017; 548 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). We injected CRISPR/Cas9 at fertilization with sperm, and found that in most, but not all instances, the outcome is non-mosaic editing. Temporally restricted activity of Cas9 to before DNA replication will likely be required to reliably avoid mosaicism.
Double-strand break repair in the embryo occurred predominantly through NHEJ or MMEJ. MMEJ restored the reading frame of the EYS 2265fs allele through the loss of two amino acids in relation to the wild-type allele, whereas NHEJ restored the reading frame through the insertion of a single A nucleotide, resulting in two amino acid substitutions. These recurrent 1 bp insertions are the consequence of filling in 1 bp overhangs created by Cas9 cutting ( Lemos et al., 2018 22. Lemos, B.R. ∙ Kaplan, A.C. ∙ Bae, J.E. ... CRISPR/Cas9 cleavages in budding yeast reveal templated insertions and strand-specific insertion/deletion profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E2040-E2047 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jasin, 2018 18. Jasin, M. Under the Influence: Cas9 Ends and DNA Repair Outcomes Crispr j. 2018; 1 :132-134 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These novel EYS alleles, upon functional testing of the altered proteins, might be suitable for somatic gene therapy. In the germline, guidelines of the National Academies call for replacement of a disease-causing variant with a functional allele already common in the population ( NAS, 2020 32. NAS National Academies of Sciences. Heritable Human Genome Editing The National Academies Press, 2020 Crossref Google Scholar ).
We evaluated restoration of the wild-type sequence with the homologous chromosome as a template for DSB repair. After MII injection, no recombination between maternal and paternal genomes was seen. Although a lack of evidence with a limited number of samples does not rule out rare events, our data show that interhomolog repair is not an efficient repair pathway at this stage of development. Novel combinations of maternal and paternal alleles representing possible interhomolog events were observed after two-cell-stage injections, although they were uncommon, and these embryos were mosaic.
Surprisingly, a frequent outcome of a single Cas9-induced DSB at the EYS locus is the loss of part or all of paternal chromosome 6. We found loss of the long arm 6q, the short arm 6p, as well as the entire chromosome. Embryos with an EYS wt genotype showed aneuploidies of chromosome 6; by contrast, embryos with heterozygous edits EYS wt/indel did not. Prior to mitosis, a zygote with an unrepaired or abnormally repaired DSB has no detectable paternal allele, and appears as EYS wt in an on-target sequencing assay because of the presence of the intact maternal allele and euploid in an array or copy number analysis. In mitosis, unjoined chromosomal arms are converted to a segmental or whole-chromosome loss, which again appear as EYS wt in on-target sequencing. Therefore, cells with the same EYS wt genotype can have several different chromosome 6 contents. Different cells of the same embryo showed both whole-chromosome loss, as well as mirroring losses of the long or the short arms of chromosome 6. Therefore, pericentromeric cleavage at the EYS locus destabilizes the entire chromosome.
Chromosomal changes were also found at a Cas9 off-target cleavage site on chromosome 16. A difference between on-target and off-target activities were the degree of mosaicism after MII injection: on-target activity resulted in aneuploidies in all cells as well as uniform indels, whereas off-target activity resulted in mosaicism, both for aneuploidies and indels. This points to differences in the timing of cleavage in relation to replication at the one-cell stage, with the on-target site cleaved primarily before, and the off-target site primarily after replication.
Why a DSB is not reliably re-joined together to form an intact chromosome in the fertilized zygote is not currently known. It is possible that the DSB is repaired in ways that prevent rejoining, such as through addition of de novo telomeres. Addition of telomeres to a DSB can stabilize broken chromosomes including in mouse ESCs ( Flint et al., 1994 12. Flint, J. ∙ Craddock, C.F. ∙ Villegas, A. ... Healing of broken human chromosomes by the addition of telomeric repeats Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55 :505-512 PubMed Google Scholar , Sprung et al., 1999 37. Sprung, C.N. ∙ Reynolds, G.E. ∙ Jasin, M. ... Chromosome healing in mouse embryonic stem cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :6781-6786 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, telomerase activity in human oocytes is low ( Wright et al., 2001 41. Wright, D.L. ∙ Jones, E.L. ∙ Mayer, J.F. ... Characterization of telomerase activity in the human oocyte and preimplantation embryo Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7 :947-955 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar , Wright et al., 1996 40. Wright, W.E. ∙ Piatyszek, M.A. ∙ Rainey, W.E. ... Telomerase activity in human germline and embryonic tissues and cells Dev. Genet. 1996; 18 :173-179 Crossref Scopus (1188) PubMed Google Scholar ), and telomere extension occurs in a telomerase-independent manner in mouse cleavage divisions ( Liu et al., 2007 25. Liu, L. ∙ Bailey, S.M. ∙ Okuka, M. ... Telomere lengthening early in development Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9 :1436-1441 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alternatively, the break might be left unrepaired for hours and persist through mitosis. The latter is consistent with the ability of human zygotes to enter mitosis with foci positive for γH2AX, which marks DSBs ( Chia et al., 2017 9. Chia, G. ∙ Agudo, J. ∙ Treff, N. ... Genomic instability during reprogramming by nuclear transfer is DNA replication dependent Nat. Cell Biol. 2017; 19 :282-291 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that checkpoint activation by one and perhaps multiple DSBs is insufficient to mediate cell cycle arrest and ensure repair at this stage of human development. This raises the intriguing possibility that endogenous DSBs contribute to mosaic aneuploidies and embryo loss. Although embryos with Cas9-induced aneuploidies cleave and can develop to the blastocyst stage, monosomic inner cell mass (ICM) cells did not establish stem cell lines. The loss of chromosome 6 might be compensated by maternal products provided in the egg, but is ultimately lethal. Indeed, pre-implantation embryos are tolerant of autosomal monosomies ( Franasiak et al., 2014 14. Franasiak, J.M. ∙ Forman, E.J. ∙ Hong, K.H. ... Aneuploidy across individual chromosomes at the embryonic level in trophectoderm biopsies: changes with patient age and chromosome structure J. Assist. Reprod. Genet. 2014; 31 :1501-1509 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), but do not provide monosomic ESC lines ( Biancotti et al., 2012 6. Biancotti, J.C. ∙ Narwani, K. ∙ Mandefro, B. ... The in vitro survival of human monosomies and trisomies as embryonic stem cells Stem Cell Res. (Amst.). 2012; 9 :218-224 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our results, summarized in Figure 6 , serve as a cautionary note for the use of induced DSBs in editing the genome for clinical use. Chromosomal material might be lost because of on-target and off-target activity of Cas9 and result in aneuploidy and developmental abnormalities. Upon further investigation, alternatives that do not require a DSB for mutation correction ( Anzalone et al., 2019 5. Anzalone, A.V. ∙ Randolph, P.B. ∙ Davis, J.R. ... Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA Nature. 2019; 576 :149-157 Crossref Scopus (2396) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as base or prime editing, might be preferable to precisely correct mutations in the germline.
Our findings are likely relevant to the interpretation of a study using a guide RNA targeted to the MYBPC3 locus on chromosome 11 ( Ma et al., 2017 26. Ma, H. ∙ Marti-Gutierrez, N. ∙ Park, S.W. ... Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos Nature. 2017; 548 :413-419 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unrepaired breaks and the loss of the chromosomal arm or the entire chromosome might have led to the loss of the mutant paternal allele, resulting in the detection of only a wild-type maternal allele by on-target sequencing. The karyotype of these embryos was not reported. Loss of paternal alleles distal, proximal, or on both sides of the Cas9 cleavage site ( Ma et al., 2018 27. Ma, H. ∙ Marti-Gutierrez, N. ∙ Park, S.-W. ... Ma et al. reply Nature. 2018; 560 :E10-E23 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ) is reminiscent of segmental and whole chromosome 11 losses. Another study found segmental losses after Cas9 cleavage at POU5F1 ( Alanis-Lobato et al., 2020 4. Alanis-Lobato, G. ∙ Zohren, J. ∙ Mccarthy, A. ... Frequent loss-of-heterozygosity in CRISPR-Cas9-edited early human embryos bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Whereas POU5F1 is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 at p21.3 ∼27.5 Mb from the centromere, EYS is pericentromeric, with the cleavage site ∼3.5 Mb from the centromere. The location of a DSB in relation to the centromere might have different consequences for centromere function and induction of whole- or segmental-chromosome loss.
Our study suggests that a DSB induced by even a single gRNA can result in the allele-specific removal of a chromosome in human embryos. Previous studies in mouse embryos demonstrated elimination of sex chromosomes by targeting Cas9 to centromeric repeats or to multiple locations on the same chromosome ( Zuo et al., 2017 44. Zuo, E. ∙ Huo, X. ∙ Yao, X. ... CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination Genome Biol. 2017; 18 :224 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar , Adikusuma et al., 2017 2. Adikusuma, F. ∙ Williams, N. ∙ Grutzner, F. ... Targeted Deletion of an Entire Chromosome Using CRISPR/Cas9 Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,. 2017; 25 :1736-1738 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). The finding that a single Cas9-induced cut can result in such outcome in human embryos suggests species-specific differences in repair or checkpoint control. Induction of allele-specific chromosome loss might have clinical applications. Aneuploidies caused by abnormal meiosis are common in human oocytes ( Hassold and Hunt, 2001 15. Hassold, T. ∙ Hunt, P. To err (meiotically) is human: the genesis of human aneuploidy Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2 :280-291 Crossref Scopus (1874) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single chromosomal gains are estimated to occur in about 5% of human oocytes ( McCoy et al., 2015 29. McCoy, R.C. ∙ Demko, Z.P. ∙ Ryan, A. ... Evidence of Selection against Complex Mitotic-Origin Aneuploidy during Preimplantation Development PLoS Genet. 2015; 11 :e1005601 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), which might be amenable to correction by Cas9. Genotyping of oocyte donor and of both first and second polar bodies should allow inference of maternal-origin trisomy in fertilized zygotes. Because trisomies are from homologs or sister chromatids, which carry different SNPs because of recombination ( Ottolini et al., 2015 33. Ottolini, C.S. ∙ Newnham, L. ∙ Capalbo, A. ... Genome-wide maps of recombination and chromosome segregation in human oocytes and embryos show selection for maternal recombination rates Nat. Genet. 2015; 47 :727-735 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ), most will have unique gRNA targets for Cas9-mediated removal in zygotes or two-cell embryos. Furthermore, carriers with Robertsonian translocation (t21;21) ( Blouin et al., 1993 7. Blouin, J.L. ∙ Avramopoulos, D. ∙ Pangalos, C. ... Normal phenotype with paternal uniparental isodisomy for chromosome 21 Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53 :1074-1078 PubMed Google Scholar ) produce zygotes that are trisomic for chromosome 21, and thus removal of one chromosome might provide a path to a genetically related child without trisomy. However, prior to use in reproduction, we will need answers about the specific biology of the pre-implantation embryo: how DNA damage checkpoints respond to DSBs and the factors that determine end joining versus chromosome loss. Additional required knowledge includes how broken chromosomes are lost and whether fragmented chromosomes re-integrate in the genome. For any clinical application, challenges including, but not limited to avoiding off-target effects, remain. In a basic research context, Cas9 provides a powerful tool to understand DNA repair in the human pre-implantation embryo and the genetic and developmental consequences of DSBs.

Oocyte donors were recruited from subjects participating in the Columbia Fertility oocyte donor program and were provided the option to donate for research instead of for reproductive purpose. Oocyte donors underwent controlled ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval as in routine clinical practice and as previously described ( Zakarin Safier et al., 2018 43. Zakarin Safier, L. ∙ Gumer, A. ∙ Kline, M. ... Compensating human subjects providing oocytes for stem cell research: 9-year experience and outcomes J. Assist. Reprod.

Oocyte donors also provided a vial of blood (3-5ml) for isolation of genomic DNA using Roche kit. 67 Oocytes from a total of 8 different oocyte donors were used. Age at donation was 27-31. Oocytes were cryopreserved using Cryotech vitrification kit until genotyping of the oocyte donor at mutation site and flanking SNPs was completed and then thawed using the Cryotech warming kit. The sperm donor (age 57 at donation) provided material via Male-FactorPak collection kit (Apex Medical Technologies MFP-130), which was cryopreserved using Quinn’s washing medium from Cooper Surgical and TYB freezing media from Irvine Scientific. Genomic DNA of the sperm donor was isolated from semen using Roche kit. All human embryos were cultured for no more than 1- 6 days, in accordance with internationally accepted standards to limit developmental progression to less than 14 days ( ISSCR, 2016 17. ISSCR Guidelines for Stem Cell Research and Clinical Translation, In : ISSCR 2016 Google Scholar ). All gamete donors provided signed informed consent. All human subjects research was reviewed and approved by the Columbia University Embryonic Stem Cell Committee and the Institutional Review Board.
Stem cells were derived after trophectoderm biopsy and plating for the inner cell mass as previously described ( Yamada et al., 2014 42. Yamada, M. ∙ Johannesson, B. ∙ Sagi, I. ... Human oocytes reprogram adult somatic nuclei of a type 1 diabetic to diploid pluripotent stem cells Nature. 2014; 510 :533-536 Crossref Scopus (151) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mural trophectoderm was ablated using laser-assisted pulses 400 μs, 100% intensity (Hamilton Thorne)( Chen et al., 2009 8. Chen, A.E. ∙ Egli, D. ∙ Niakan, K. ... Optimal timing of inner cell mass isolation increases the efficiency of human embryonic stem cell derivation and allows generation of sibling cell lines Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4 :103-106 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). This method spares polar trophectoderm, which usually results in trophectoderm growth which is then ablated with additional pulses. Two stem cell lines with the parental genotypes wt/EYS 2265fs , eysES6 and eysES1, were obtained and used for experiments to determine mechanisms of repair after Cas9 mediated cleavage of the eys mutant allele. Derivation was performed on irradiated MEFs (GlobalStem) in KO-DMEM with 25% KO-SR with 10 μM Rock inhibitor Y-27632, 10ng/mL bFGF and 2% ES grade FBS. Outgrowths were allowed to grow for two weeks until manual passaging and FBS is gradually phased in partial media changes every second or third day. Passaged stem cells a cultured with StemFlex media on Geltrex. Upon reaching 70% confluency, cultures were passaged at a ratio of 1:10, or cryopreserved in a solution of freezing media containing 40% FBS (Company) and 10% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). Passaging was performed by TrypLE dissociation to small clusters of cells, and plated in media containing Rock inhibitor Y-27632 was added to media and removed within 24-48 h. For later passage cells (> passage 10), Rock inhibitor was omitted. Genotypes are indicated in Table S1. All embryo and ESC research was reviewed and approved by the Columbia University Embryonic Stem Cell Committee and the Institutional Review Board.

Briefly, oocytes were enucleated in 5 μg/mL cytochalasinB, the zona pellucida was opened using a zona laser (Hamilton Thorne) set at 100% for 300 μs. The spindle was visualized using microtubule birefringence and removed using a 20 μm inner diameter Piezo micropipette (Humagen). Intracytoplasmic sperm injection was identical for both nucleated and enucleated metaphaseII oocytes. Cryopreserved sperm was thawed to room temperature for 10 min and transferred to a 15mL conical tube. Quinn’s Sperm Washing Medium was added dropwise to a final volume of 6mL. The tube was then centrifuged at 300x g for 15 min. Supernatant was removed and an additional wash was performed. Upon removal of supernatant from second wash, pellet was suspended in wash media and analyzed for viability.
Manipulation dishes consisted of a droplet with 10%PVP, a 10-20 μL droplet with RNP in injection buffer, and a droplet of Global Total w. HEPES. Sperm was mixed with 10%PVP, and individual motile sperm was immobilized by pressing the sperm tail with the ICSI micropipette, picked up and ejected in the Cas9 RNP droplet and picked up again for injection. ICSI without immersion in the Cas9 RNP droplet was also performed. After all manipulations, cells were cultures in Global total in an incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. Pronucleus formation was confirmed on day 1 after ICSI. 2-cell injections were performed at least 3 h after cleavage, between 30-35 h post ICSI. Earlier injection resulted in lysis. The tip of an injection needle was nicked and small amounts of the Cas9RNP was injected manually using a Narishige micromanipulator.
Zygotes were collected at 20 h post ICSI, and single blastomeres were collected on day3 to day4.Trophectoderm biopsies were obtained on day6 of development using 300ms laser pulses to separate trophectoderm from the inner cell mass. Single zygote nuclei were extracted from zygotes in the presence of 10 μg/mL CytochalasinB and 1 μg/mL nocodazole at 20 h post ICSI. All samples were placed in single tubes with 2 μL PBS. Amplification was performed using REPLI-g single cell kit (QIAGEN Cat #150345) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Illustra GenomePhi V2 DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare 95042-266) was also used. REPLI-g was used in most experiments as it resulted in more genomic DNA product. Genotyping was performed using primers for amplification and sequencing as listed in Table S7 . PCR was performed using AmpliTaq Gold. PCR products were loaded on gel for visual inspection of product size. PCR products were submitted to Genewiz for Sanger sequencing. If two bands were detected, both were sequenced separately after TOPO cloning. PCR artifacts were distinguished from genuine products by Sanger sequencing and blast search analysis (NCBI blastn) whether the sequence mapped to the EYS locus. TOPO-TA cloning was done also for heterozygous edits and 5-10 bacterial colonies were used for Miniprep preparation and sequenced to identify the two edits individually (e.g., Figure 1 F).
For on-target NGS shown in Figures 1 C, 1D, and 4 C, primers were designed to amplify rs66502009 and the EYS 2265fs mutation rs758109813 (as shown in Figure 1 A and Table S7 ). PCR products were purified via sodium acetate precipitation and submitted for AmpliconEZ sequencing at Genewiz. Results were provided in the format of raw reads and fastq files and an analysis of read frequency was conducted. Each sample yielded > 50,000 reads. Sequences with a read count that exceeded 0.2% of the total reads (> 100 reads) were considered significant. Those that had less than 100 reads were considered insignificant due to the possibility that these were due to sequencing errors or mutations introduced during DNA amplification. Base changes were analyzed at the region of Cas9 cutting, and paternal and maternal alleles were called based on rs66502009, and rs758109813 (EYS 2265fs ).
Cas9 off-target analysis was performed by identifying potential off-target sites using Cas-OFF finder online tool ( http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/ ), selecting SpCas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes. 32 potential off-target sites were predicted across 14 chromosomes. Those with 3 or fewer mismatches were selected for analysis. PCR primers for off-target analysis are indicated in Table S7 .
A TaqMan assay (C_397916532_10) was used to obtain allelic discrimination results for the EYS mutation (rs758109813; NG_023443.2:g.1713111del) using a QuantStudio 3 instrument and following the manufacturer’s recommendations (ThermoFisher). See Table S5 for results.
Embryo biopsies were amplified at Columbia University using either REPLI-g or GenomePhi as described above, or at Genomic Prediction Clinical Laboratory using ePGT amplification ( Treff et al., 2019 38. Treff, N.R. ∙ Zimmerman, R. ∙ Bechor, E. ... Validation of concurrent preimplantation genetic testing for polygenic and monogenic disorders, structural rearrangements, and whole and segmental chromosome aneuploidy with a single universal platform Eur. J. Med. Genet. 2019; 62 :103647 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Amplified DNA was processed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for Axiom GeneTitan UKBB SNP arrays (ThermoFisher). Copy number and genotyping analysis was performed using gSUITE software (Genomic Prediction). Parental origin of copy number changes was determined by genotype comparison of embryonic and parental SNPs. For copy number analysis, raw intensities from Affymetrix Axiom array are first processed according to the method described ( Mayrhofer et al., 2016 28. Mayrhofer, M. ∙ Viklund, B. ∙ Isaksson, A. Rawcopy: Improved copy number analysis with Affymetrix arrays Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :36158 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). After normalizing with a panel of normal males, the copy number is then calculated for each probeset. Normalized intensity is displayed. Mapping of endogenous fragile sites was done through visual evaluation of loss of heterozygosity. Break points were mapped to chromosomal bands by visual analysis of SNP array chromosome plots including analysis of both copy number signal and heterozygosity calls. The accuracy of mapping is between 100-500kb. Evaluation whether a segmental error involved a common fragile site was performed by comparison of break sites to the location of common fragile sites according to ( Mrasek et al., 2010 30. Mrasek, K. ∙ Schoder, C. ∙ Teichmann, A.C. ... Global screening and extended nomenclature for 230 aphidicolin-inducible fragile sites, including 61 yet unreported ones Int. J. Oncol. 2010; 36 :929-940 PubMed Google Scholar ).
For CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, cultures of embryonic stem cell lines eysES1 and eysES6, both of which have the EYS wt /EYS 2265fs genotype and are heterozygous at rs66502009 were dissociated to single cells, and cells were nucleofected with pCas9_GFP (Addgene #44719) ( Ding et al., 2013 10. Ding, Q. ∙ Regan, S.N. ∙ Xia, Y. ... Enhanced efficiency of human pluripotent stem cell genome editing through replacing TALENs with CRISPRs Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12 :393-394 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ), a gBlock (IDT) expression vector, using the Lonza Kit and Amaxa Nucleofector. 1 million cells at 50% confluency at time of use were nucleofected per reaction using program A-023. GFP positive cells were sorted using BD SORP FACSAria cell sorters 48 h post nucleofection at the Columbia Stem Cell Initiative Flow Cytometry Core.
For NGS analysis as shown in Figures 1 C and 1D, 2000–5,000 sorted cells were harvested for genome amplification using identical methods as used for embryo blastomeres. Whole genome amplification was performed using REPLI-g (QIAGEN). PCR was then performed using primers flanking EYS 2265fs and rs66502009 and products were analyzed for gene editing using AmpliconEZ service of Genewiz. Read frequency analysis was used to quantify molecularly distinct edits. Paternal and maternal alleles were distinguished based on EYS 2265fs and rs66502009.
For clonal analysis shown in Figure 1 E, two independent experiments with eysES1 and eysES6 were performed. Single Cas9-GFP positive sorted cells were plated in individual wells of 96-well plates onto Geltrex with StemFlex media with Rock inhibitor Y-27632. After 5–12 days, colonies were picked and harvested for DNA isolation and analysis. DNA collection from cultured cells was performed using QuickExtract. PCR and sequencing was performed using primers flanking the gRNA at EYS 2265fs as well as rs66502009. The paternal and maternal alleles were identified using rs66502009 and EYS 2265fs , and Cas9-induced modifications were called through visual analysis and using ICE ( https://ice.synthego.com/#/ ). Sanger profiles from all edited colonies contained at most two molecularly different alleles, and equal signal intensity from the edited paternal allele and from the non-edited maternal allele, confirming that they were individual events originating from single cells.
Statistical analysis of different genotypes was performed using Fisher’s exact test as indicated in the figure legends.
