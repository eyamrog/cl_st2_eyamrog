Title: Mouse totipotent stem cells captured and maintained through spliceosomal repression


Abstract: Summary

Since establishment of the first embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in vitro culture of totipotent cells functionally and molecularly comparable with in vivo blastomeres with embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential has been a challenge. Here we report that spliceosomal repression in mouse ESCs drives a pluripotent-to-totipotent state transition. Using the splicing inhibitor pladienolide B, we achieve stable in vitro culture of totipotent ESCs comparable at molecular levels with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, which we call totipotent blastomere-like cells (TBLCs). Mouse chimeric assays combined with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrate that TBLCs have a robust bidirectional developmental capability to generate multiple embryonic and extraembryonic cell lineages. Mechanically, spliceosomal repression causes widespread splicing inhibition of pluripotent genes, whereas totipotent genes, which contain few short introns, are efficiently spliced and transcriptionally activated. Our study provides a means for capturing and maintaining totipotent stem cells.

Section: Introduction

Stem cell research is widely connected to regenerative medicine, assisted reproduction, cancer, metabolic disorders, and aging ( Shi et al., 2017 40. Shi, Y. ∙ Inoue, H. ∙ Wu, J.C. ...

Totipotent cells have the highest developmental potential, which normally refers to in vivo zygotes and 2- and 4-cell blastomeres in mammals. During early embryo development, totipotent blastomeres are specialized into the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE), and the ICM gives rise to primitive endoderm (PrE) and epiblast (EPI) of the blastocysts. After embryo implantation, the EPI generates embryonic tissue containing three germ layers, and the PrE produces visceral endoderm (VE) and parietal endoderm (PE) to finally develop into yolk sac tissue. The TE generates extraembryonic tissue, such as the ectoplacental cone (EPC) and extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE), and eventually forms the placenta ( Baker and Pera, 2018 2. Baker, C.L. ∙ Pera, M.F.

ESCs cultured in vitro are normally derived from the ICM and are able to differentiate into any cell type of an adult organism, called pluripotency, marked by expression of transcription factors such as POU5F1 (OCT4), ZFP42, NANOG, and SOX2 ( Hackett and Surani, 2014 15.

Recently, it has been reported that a very small subpopulation (0.1%–1%) of cultured ESCs activates expression of MERVL and MT2 transposons and other totipotent genes, such as ZSCAN4s, all of which are particularly enriched in 2-cell (2C) embryos ( Macfarlan et al., 2012 28. Macfarlan, T.S. ∙ Gifford, W.D. ∙ Driscoll, S. ... Embryonic stem cell potency fluctuates with endogenous retrovirus activity Nature. 2012; 487 :57-63 Crossref Scopus (800) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two studies reported a novel type of expanded (or extended) pluripotent stem cell (EPSC) that enables embryonic and extraembryonic differentiation and can be established and maintained in medium with different chemical cocktails ( Yang et al., 2017a 59. Yang, J. ∙ Ryan, D.J. ∙ Wang, W. ... Establishment of mouse expanded potential stem cells Nature. 2017; 550 :393-397 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017b 60.

Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells with In Vivo Embryonic and Extraembryonic Potency Cell. 2017; 169 :243-257.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a very recent study has questioned and doubted the totipotency of EPSCs at the molecular and functional levels ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, in vitro capture and maintenance of totipotent stem cells that are molecularly and functionally similar to in vivo totipotent blastomeres is unavailable.
Spliceosomes are macromolecular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with five core subunits and several cofactors and are dynamic molecular machines for messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and maturation ( Wahl et al., 2009 47. Wahl, M.C. ∙ Will, C.L. ∙ Lührmann, R.

Will, C.L. ∙ Lührmann, R. Spliceosome structure and function Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3 :a003707 Crossref Scopus (1157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Recent studies have demonstrated that spliceosomes can also directly control transcriptional origination, elongation, and termination, highlighting their splicing-independent functions ( Berg et al., 2012 3.

Interestingly, in many different cancers, mutations of several key splicing factors have been identified to play essential roles in tumorigenesis ( Inoue et al., 2019 17.

However, the possible physiological relevance of spliceosomes in stem cell fate transition and early embryonic development is unclear.

Section: Results

To address the above issue, we explored previously published single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data for mouse and human embryos ( Deng et al., 2014 10. Deng, Q. ∙ Ramsköld, D. ∙ Reinius, B. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells Science. 2014; 343 :193-196 Crossref Scopus (912) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yan et al., 2013 58. Yan, L. ∙ Yang, M. ∙ Guo, H. ... Single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of human preimplantation embryos and embryonic stem cells Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :1131-1139 Crossref Scopus (1232) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that expression of 85 and 117 splicing factors in mouse and human, respectively, was obviously induced after the 8-cell embryonic stage, 60 of which overlapped ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 A), revealing a close connection between dynamic spliceosome expression and early embryonic development in vivo . Interestingly, a recent small interfering (siRNA) screening study identified 23 splicing factors whose suppression activates totipotent marker genes, including ZSCAN4s, in mouse ESCs ( Rodriguez-Terrones et al., 2018 37. Rodriguez-Terrones, D. ∙ Gaume, X. ∙ Ishiuchi, T. ... A molecular roadmap for the emergence of early-embryonic-like cells in culture Nat. Genet. 2018; 50 :106-119 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore speculate that dynamic spliceosomal changes control totipotent/pluripotent stem cell transition in vitro . To verify this, we knocked down 14 splicing factors belonging to different spliceosomal subunits using synthetic siRNAs in mouse pluripotent ESCs. qRT-PCR and western blot showed that repression of 10 of the 14 splicing factors (SNRPD2, SNRPB, ISY1, EFTUD2, LSM4, PUF60, and SF3B2–SF3B5) dramatically induced expression of the totipotent markers ZSCAN4s and MERVL ( Figures 1 C, S1 B, and S1C), indicating that spliceosomal repression could generally activate totipotent genes in mouse ESCs.
We next performed poly(A) + RNA-seq to measure global transcriptome alteration. Volcano plots showed that, as expected, spliceosomal repression generally activated totipotent markers such as ZSCAN4s and ZFP365, whereas, surprisingly, expression of core pluripotent factors, including POU5F1, NANOG, SOX2, and ZFP42, was commonly reduced ( Figures 1 D and S1 D). By analyzing the expression of all transposons, we observed that the only two totipotent marker transposons, MERVL and MT2, were obviously and commonly induced ( Figure 1 D). Among the genes with expressional changes (i.e., 922 upregulated and 635 downregulated genes) because of repression of at least four splicing factors, were enriched with Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to embryo development ( Figures 1 E and 1F; Table S1 ). In particular, the majority of these upregulated genes were expressed specifically in 2- and 4-cell embryos: ZSCAN4s, ZFP352, DDIT4L, TRP53INP1, and BTG2. Downregulated genes included many typical pluripotent genes that were highly enriched in blastocysts; e.g., POU5F1, ZFP42, SOX2, NANOG, and TDGF1 ( Figures 1 G and S1 D). Finally, transcriptomic comparison between two different mouse ESC lines (TC1 and V6.5) revealed that the effects of spliceosomal repression were not cell line specific ( Figures S1 E–S1G). Our analyses reveal that spliceosomes are key master regulators of ESC fate decision, and spliceosomal repression reprograms pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into a totipotent state by widely activating totipotent genes and silencing pluripotent genes.
Pladienolide B (PlaB) is a natural antitumor analog of macrocyclic lactones that specially binds to the SF3B complex to inhibit the functions of spliceosomes and splicing ( Kotake et al., 2007 21. Kotake, Y. ∙ Sagane, K. ∙ Owa, T. ... Splicing factor SF3b as a target of the antitumor natural product pladienolide Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3 :570-575 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because knockdown of SF3B subunits (SF3B2–SF3B5) activated the totipotent marker genes ( Figure 1 C), we presumed that PlaB could drive pluripotent-to-totipotent cell transition. By using serum/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) medium supplemented with PlaB at different concentrations to culture mouse ESCs on gelatin, we found that cell proliferation was reduced slightly upon treatment with 1.0 nM and 2.5 nM PlaB and inhibited dramatically by 5.0 nM and 10 nM PlaB ( Figures S2 A and S2B). qRT-PCR showed that totipotent genes, including ZSCAN4s, BTG1, BTG2, and DDIT4L, were induced dramatically by 2.5 nM and 5.0 nM PlaB ( Figures S2 C and S2D).
Next, serum/LIF medium supplemented with 2.5 nM PlaB was used to culture EGFP-labeled mouse ESCs on feeders. Interestingly, the typical spherical morphology of ESCs and activation of totipotent genes were retained after 16 passages, although cell proliferation was reduced compared with that in serum/LIF medium ( Figures 2 A, S2 E, and S2F). Because silencing of pluripotent genes is another key event during pluripotent-to-totipotent transition, we then used two reporter ESC lines expressing GFP fused with the ZFP42 (Rex1) gene (Rex1-GFP) and mCherry fused with the pri-miR-290 gene (mCherry-pri-miR-290) to experimentally verify the effect of serum/LIF/PlaB (SLP) medium on the pluripotency program. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis showed that, after a few passages, 91% and 96% of reporter cells lost Rex1-GFP and mCherry-pri-miR-290 expression, respectively ( Figure 2 B).
To characterize the cells in SLP medium in detail, we performed poly(A) + RNA-seq for different passages (passage 0 [P0]–P15). Transcriptomic analysis showed that, compared with PSCs (P0), many totipotent genes specifically expressed in zygotes and 2- and 4-cell embryos, including ZSCAN4s, DDIT4L, PLK2, BTG1/2, and ZFP352, as well as the two transposons MERVL and MT2 were obviously upregulated and that typical pluripotent genes, such as SOX2, DPPA5A, ZFP42, TET1, and TCF15, were clearly downregulated in P5–P15 cells ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Table S1 ). Furthermore, we performed transcriptome-based clustering analysis and found that P5/P6/P7/P10/P15 cells were clustered together and were comparable with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, and, as a comparison, P0/P1/P4 cells were clustered with blastocysts ( Figure 2 E). We also performed karyotype analysis of cells at P0, P9, and P12, which showed that persistent culture in SLP medium did not affect genetic stability ( Figure S2 G). Further Annexin V staining demonstrated that P10/P18 totipotent cells possess a similar cell viability as PSCs ( Figures S2 H and S2I). In summary, using the spliceosomal inhibitor PlaB, we successfully developed the novel SLP medium, which not only enables reprogramming mouse PSCs into a totipotent state but also allows maintenance of totipotent cells with high chromosomal stability and cell viability in vitro for multiple passages. These totipotent cells have a distinct transcriptome close to 2- and 4-cell blastomeres in vivo , and we therefore named these cells totipotent blastomere-like cells (TBLCs).
We next tested whether TBLCs can progress toward pluripotency following the normal development process. To this end, reporter ESCs expressing GFP fused with OCT4 (OCT4-GFP) were first cultured in SLP medium, and, as expected, FACS analysis revealed that 99.8% cells lost expression of OCT4-GFP after 6 passages. When PlaB was removed from the medium, 76% and 90% cells re-activated OCT4 expression after 2 and 3 passages (rP2 and rP3), respectively ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Transcriptomics comparison revealed that, in rP2 and rP3 cells, expression of 1,047 upregulated and 959 downregulated TBLC-specific genes recovered to a similar level as in PSCs (P0) ( Figure S2 J; Table S1 ). The dynamic expression changes of pluripotent and totipotent genes and the transcriptome-based clustering analysis proved that pluripotent/totipotent cell transition can be manipulated by a single splicing inhibitor, PlaB ( Figures 2 H and S2 K). Thus, SLP culture conditions are a useful ex vivo system to investigate totipotent-to-pluripotent cell transition.
We also performed a transcriptomic comparison of cells transiently induced by siRNAs or cultured in SLP medium. Compared with control PSCs, we detected 1,200 and 1,174 genes that are commonly up- and downregulated, respectively, in cells transfected with individual siRNAs targeting SNRPD2, SNRPB, ISY1, EFTUD2, and LSM4 and in TBLCs (P5/P6/P7/P10) cultured in SLP medium ( Figure S3 A). Further transcriptome-based clustering analysis showed that cells transiently induced by siRNAs against individual splicing factors and TBLCs cultured in SLP medium were clustered together with 2- and 4-cell embryos ( Figure S3 B). This analysis not only proves that spliceosomal repression with different approaches is a general and efficient strategy to obtain totipotent stem cells in vitro but also suggests that it is direct suppression of spliceosomes, but not other off-target effects of PlaB or certain siRNAs, that enables establishment and maintenance of TBLCs through SLP medium.
To eventually characterize cell heterogeneity and molecular features of TBLCs at the single-cell level, we performed 10x Genomics scRNA-seq on PSCs (cultured in serum/LIF on feeders or gelatin) and TBLCs (cultured in SLP medium for 6 passages on feeders or treated with siRNAs targeting SNRPD2 on gelatin). The t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) plot mainly identified four types of cells: PSCs, TBLCs, extraembryonic endoderm (XEN)-like cells, and a few 2C-like cells ( Figures 3 A; S3 C). Using expression of 23 pluripotent genes, 30 totipotent genes, as well as two transposons, MERVL and MT2, we were able to clearly label and distinguish PSCs and TBLCs ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S3 D–S3F). Of the cells cultured on feeders, 4,114 PSCs were from serum/LIF medium, and 99.75% of 4,026 TBLCs were from SLP medium ( Figure 3 A). Of the ESCs transfected with siRNAs on gelatin, 3,288 cells with efficiently knockdown of SNRPD2 lost expression of pluripotent genes and gained expression of totipotent genes ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Finally, cell-based correlation analysis showed that expression of several splicing factors, such as SNPRD2, SNRPB, LSM4, SF3B5, and U2AF2, was correlated positively with pluripotent genes and negatively with totipotent genes and the transposons MERVL and MT2 ( Figures 3 B and S3 E). This analysis, at the single-cell level, strongly indicates that high expression of splicing factors is required to keep the pluripotent state of ESCs and that spliceosomal suppression is sufficient and necessary to completely reprogram PSCs into TBLCs. Thus, the SLP medium enables culture and maintenance of homogeneous TBLCs on feeders.
Recently, two research groups claimed that they had captured a novel kind of EPSCs with embryonic and extraembryonic differentiation potential ( Yang et al., 2017a 59. Yang, J. ∙ Ryan, D.J. ∙ Wang, W. ... Establishment of mouse expanded potential stem cells Nature. 2017; 550 :393-397 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2017b 60. Yang, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Xu, J. ... Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells with In Vivo Embryonic and Extraembryonic Potency Cell. 2017; 169 :243-257.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). We compared the TBLCs with EPSCs using our own and their published data and found that, compared with TBLCs (transiently induced by siRNAs or cultured in SLP medium), in which most pluripotent genes were broadly silenced, EPSCs were obviously enriched with ESRRB, NANOG, POU5F1, ZFP42, and SOX2. Contrary to this, TBLCs highly expressed totipotent genes/transposons, such as ZSCAN4s, GM8300, DDIT4L, PLK2, BTG2, MERVL, and MT2, that were undetectable in EPSCs ( Figure 3 C). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using 266 totipotent genes induced particularly in 2-cell embryos and 47 typical pluripotent marker genes ( Table S2 ) further confirmed that TBLCs were enriched with totipotent genes, whereas all EPSCs were enriched with pluripotent genes ( Figure 3 D). To compare TBLCs and EPSCs with in vivo embryos, transcriptome-based principal-component analyses (PCAs) were performed using bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. As expected, TBLCs were clearly similar to 2- and 4-cell embryos, whereas, similar to the results reported recently ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), EPSCs were obviously close to blastocysts ( Figures 3 E and S3 G).
The recently identified 2C-like cells with activation of ZSCAN4s, MERVL, and MT2 are metastable cells that are present at very low percentages (0.1%–1%) in PSC cultures ( Macfarlan et al., 2012 28. Macfarlan, T.S. ∙ Gifford, W.D. ∙ Driscoll, S. ... Embryonic stem cell potency fluctuates with endogenous retrovirus activity Nature. 2012; 487 :57-63 Crossref Scopus (800) PubMed Google Scholar ). We next compared TBLCs with 2C-like cells. Sixteen 2C-like cells were identified in our scRNA-seq of cells cultured on gelatin, but t-SNE analysis revealed that these 2C-like cells were clearly separated from TBLCs, suggesting that 2C-like cells are different from TBLCs at the whole-transcriptomic level ( Figure S3 C). Detailed comparison showed that 2C-like cells and PSCs were enriched with pluripotent genes and that TBLCs expressed many more totipotent genes than 2C-like cells ( Figures S3 D and S3H). At last, transcriptome-based correlation and clustering analyses revealed that TBLCs were comparable with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres but that EPSCs and 2C-like cells were close to pluripotent blastocysts ( Figures 3 F and S3 I).
Therefore, we conclude that, compared with TBLCs, which possess a transcriptome comparable with in vivo 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, EPSCs are still “pluripotent” stem cells at the molecular level, featuring high expression of pluripotent genes and lacking typical totipotent characters ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To characterize TBLCs at multiple molecular levels, we performed multi-omics analysis. Ribosomal profiling (Ribo-seq) was performed first, which showed, in TBLCs compared with PSCs, 2,581 and 837 genes with translational up- and downregulation, which contained totipotent (including ZSCAN4s, DDIT4L, SP110, GM8300, and SNAI1) and pluripotent genes (including POU5F1, ZFP42, SOX2, and NR0B1), respectively ( Figures 4 A and 4B; Table S1 ). This Ribo-seq analysis showed a distinct signature of TBLCs at the translational level.
Dynamic alterations of the DNA epigenome have been reported and well characterized in mouse and human early embryonic development ( Wang et al., 2014 49. Wang, L. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Duan, J. ... Programming and inheritance of parental DNA methylomes in mammals Cell. 2014; 157 :979-991 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (416) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu et al., 2018 55. Wu, J. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Liu, B. ... Chromatin analysis in human early development reveals epigenetic transition during ZGA Nature. 2018; 557 :256-260 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize the DNA methylomes of TBLCs and PSCs. In total, we found a global CpG methylation level of 71% in PSCs that was close to that of embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5)–E7.5 embryos, whereas in TBLCs, global methylation was reduced to 35%, which was comparable with that in 2- and 4-cell blastomeres (47% and 41%, respectively) ( Figure 4 C). Detailed analysis showed that the DNA methylation levels at genes and promoter regions were reduced in TBLCs compared with PSCs ( Figures 4 D and S4 A). Finally, DNA methylome-based PCA clearly showed that TBLCs were similar to 2- and 4-cell embryos, and PSCs in serum/LIF medium were close to E6.5–E7.5 embryos ( Figure 4 E). Although the effects of decreased methylation at particular loci, such as imprinting genes ( Figures 4 F, S4 B, and S4C), on developmental potential need to be explored further ( Choi et al., 2017a 7. Choi, J. ∙ Huebner, A.J. ∙ Clement, K. ...

Derivation of ground-state female ES cells maintaining gamete-derived DNA methylation Nature. 2017; 548 :224-227 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), with WGBS analyses, we characterized a DNA methylome of TBLCs that was comparable with totipotent blastomeres in vivo .
Because chromatin accessibility has been found to be closely associated with gene expression during early embryonic development ( Wu et al., 2016 54. Wu, J. ∙ Huang, B. ∙ Chen, H. ... The landscape of accessible chromatin in mammalian preimplantation embryos Nature. 2016; 534 :652-657 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 55. Wu, J. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Liu, B. ... Chromatin analysis in human early development reveals epigenetic transition during ZGA Nature. 2018; 557 :256-260 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ), an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) was then performed on TBLCs and PSCs. We found that, compared with PSCs, TBLCs have 30,602 open and 24,519 closed peaks on the genome. Among these loci, there were 1,935 open and 2,322 closed peaks around transcription start sites (TSSs), which were similar to 2- and 4-cell embryos ( Figures 4 G and S4 D). Further analysis showed that, of the 1,504 genes with open peaks around their TSSs in TBLCs, 769 genes (51.1%), including the totipotent markers ZSCAN4s, SP110, and GM8300, were activated dramatically, and of the 1,922 genes with closed peaks around their TSSs, 1,035 genes (54%) containing pluripotent markers such as POU5F1, ZFP42, REST, and TET1, were silenced during PSC-to-TBLC transition ( Figures 4 G, 4H, and S4 E). It is noteworthy that we also observed open peaks around the transposons MERVL and MT2 at different genomic loci, fitting well with expressional induction of these two transposons in TBLCs compared with PSCs ( Figure 4 I). Using multi-omics analyses ( Figure 4 J), we characterized the molecular features of TBLCs similar to 2- and 4-cell blastomeres in vivo at different levels, including the transcriptome, DNA epigenome, chromatin accessibility, and translatome.
Different from PSCs, which can only generate the three germ layers of embryonic tissue, totipotent cells possess embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential. We next functionally tested the differentiation capabilities of TBLCs using chimeric experiments. We injected 1 or 6 EGFP-labeled mouse PSCs or TBLCs into 8-cell mouse embryos, and after in vitro differentiation for 36–48 h, we monitored the distributions of injected donor cells in chimeric blastocysts ( Figure 5 A). We detected EGFP + cells in ICM and TE regions of 6 of 11 (54.5%), 21 of 24 (87.5%), and 17 of 19 (89.5%) chimeric embryos injected with 6 TBLCs cultured in SLP medium, transiently induced by siRNAs targeting SNRPD2 and ISY1, respectively ( Figures 5 B and 5C). In 8 of 19 (42%) embryos injected with 1 TBLC, we observed EGFP + cells in both ICM and TE regions ( Figure 5 B). As a control, PSCs can only cooperate into ICM, but not TE, for 1- and 6-cell injections ( Figures 5 B and 5C). CDX2 is a typical TE marker gene. By using immunofluorescence staining with a CDX2 antibody, we showed that TBLC-derived EGFP + cells in TE also expressed CDX2 proteins, but EGFP + cells generated from PSCs located in the ICM did not express CDX2 ( Figures 5 D and S5 A). Thus, TBLCs have the ability to contribute to ICM and TE in chimeric blastocysts.
After embryo implantation, TE overlaying the ICM develops into the EPC and ExE, and the ICM differentiates into EPI in E6.5–E7.5 embryos. We next tested the developmental potential of TBLCs in post-implantation chimeric embryos. EGFP-labeled donor PSCs or TBLCs were injected into 8-cell mouse embryos, which were then transplanted into pseudopregnant mice for 7 days to obtain E6.5–E7.5 chimeric embryos ( Figure 5 E). Immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against EGFP, OCT4, and ELF5 was performed to monitor EGFP + cells, EPI cells, and EPC/ExE cells, respectively. As expected, PSC-derived EGFP + cells mainly contributed to EPI expressing OCT4 but none in EPC ( Figures 5 F and S5 B). However, EGFP + cells derived from donor TBLCs were co-stained with OCT4 and ELF5 at EPI and EPC regions, respectively ( Figures 5 F and S5 B). More importantly, EGFP + cells derived from one single TBLC were also observed to cooperate into the whole E6.5–E7.5 embryo, including EPI, ExE, and EPC tissue ( Figures 5 F and S5 B). These chimeric assays on post-implantation E6.5–E7.5 embryos strongly prove the robust bidirectional embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential of TBLCs, which is comparable with the differentiation capacity of in vivo totipotent blastomeres ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ).
At a later embryo development stage, TE and PrE eventually generate the placenta and the yolk sac, respectively. We also measured the differentiation potency of TBLCs in E12.5–E14.5 mouse chimeric conceptuses in vivo ( Figure 5 E). As expected, EGFP + cells derived from PSCs can be detected only in embryonic tissue of the fetus but not in extraembryonic tissues, but TBLC-derived EGFP + cells are distributed widely in embryonic and extraembryonic (placenta and yolk sac) tissue ( Figures 5 G and S5 C). By using FACS analysis to precisely quantify the cooperation efficiency of donor cells, we found that EGFP + cells derived from TBLCs contributed to 21.9%–81.8% of the fetus, 8.7%–10.8% of the placenta, and 5.6%–24.5% of the yolk sac. As a control, EGFP + cells from PSCs can contribute to 48.0% of the fetus but hardly at all to extraembryonic tissue ( Figure 5 H). Further immunofluorescence analysis of the chimeric fetus sections and gonads showed that, similar to PSCs, TBLCs contributed widely to all embryonic tissues derived from three germ layers and the germline ( Figures S5 D and S5E). Finally, we showed that TBLCs cultured in SLP medium for multiple passages retained the ability to produce chimeric animals ( Figure S5 F). The functional assays in chimeric mice strongly prove that TBLCs are functionally totipotent to generate embryonic and extraembryonic tissue as well as the germline in chimeric mice and are capable of generating chimeric mouse animals.
To prove that TBLCs can differentiate into extraembryonic cell lineages at the cellular level, we performed an immunohistochemistry assay on placental sections containing three layers: the decidua (Dec), junctional zone, (JZ), and labyrinth (Laby). In control placentae without injections of donor cells, no EGFP + cells were detected, and as reported before ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Watson and Cross, 2005 51. Watson, E.D. ∙ Cross, J.C. Development of structures and transport functions in the mouse placenta Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20 :180-193 Crossref Scopus (486) PubMed Google Scholar ), EGFP + cells derived from donor PSCs were observed in the Laby but not in the JZ layer. However, we detected TBLC-differentiated EGFP + cells distributed widely in the Laby and JZ layers ( Figures 6 A and 6B), suggesting that TBLCs are able to generate trophoblast cells. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in parallel, using antibodies against TPBPA and PROLIFERIN to label spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells, respectively. This assay showed that EGFP + cells derived from TBLCs expressed the TPBPA and PROLIFERIN proteins, which proved that TBLCs can differentiate into spongiotrophoblast and trophoblast giant cells in vivo ( Figures 6 A and S6 A).
To decipher the various differentiation fates of TBLCs in extraembryonic tissue at single-cell resolution, we performed scRNA-seq on TBLC-derived EGFP + cells isolated from the placenta and yolk sac of E13.5–E14.5 chimeric conceptuses using FACS. By combining graph-based clustering with known marker genes, we annotated 21 clusters among all 6,127 cells obtained after computational quality control ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 B). In total, we identified 6 TBLC-derived extraembryonic cell lineages, including trophoblast giant cells (marked with CTSQ), glycogen trophoblast cells (marked with PCDH12 and IGFBP7), trophoblast progenitors (marked with GJB3 and TFAP2C), spongiotrophoblast cells (marked with TPBPA, PRL8A8, and PRL3B1; Simmons et al., 2008 42. Simmons, D.G. ∙ Rawn, S. ∙ Davies, A. ... Spatial and temporal expression of the 23 murine Prolactin/Placental Lactogen-related genes is not associated with their position in the locus BMC Genomics. 2008; 9 :352 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ), parietal yolk sac cell (marked with PGA5 and GKN2; Yagi and Shiojiri, 2017 56. Yagi, S. ∙ Shiojiri, N. Identification of novel genetic markers for mouse yolk sac cells by using microarray analyses Placenta. 2017; 49 :68-71 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ), and LDOC1-high trophoblast cells expressing typical trophoblast genes, including KRT8, KRT18, RHOX6, and RHOX9, but without unique featured genes. We also identified 15 embryonic cell lineages differentiated from TBLCs that contained 10 types of blood cells, such as erythrocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells, as well as 5 somatic cell types, such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and stromal cells ( Figures 6 E, S6 B, and S6C). The functional chimeric assays combined with scRNA-seq technology proves that TBLCs are capable of generating multiple embryonic and extraembryonic cell types in chimeric embryos and mice. Thus, TBLCs have robust bidirectional developmental potential and are comparable with in vivo totipotent blastomeres, which are bona fide totipotent stem cells at the molecular and functional levels.
To understand the direct effects of spliceosomal repression on pluripotent and totipotent genes, we treated mouse ESCs with PlaB at a high concentration (10 nM), and samples were collected at different time points (1–6 h) for poly(A) + RNA-seq analysis ( Figure 7 A). Transcriptome-based clustering analysis showed that cells treated with 10 nM PlaB for 4 and 6 h were comparable with TBLCs cultured in SLP medium for several passages (P5/P6/P7) ( Figure 7 B). We found that, in 4 h, 1,406 genes containing most pluripotent genes were silenced, and 634 genes, including totipotent genes and transposons (MERVL and MT2), were activated ( Figures 7 C, S7 A, and S7B). These analyses reveal that spliceosomal repression by treatment with high-concentration PlaB enabled very transient reprograming of PSCs into TBLCs, during which unrelated processes are affected little ( Almada et al., 2013 1. Almada, A.E. ∙ Wu, X. ∙ Kriz, A.J. ... Promoter directionality is controlled by U1 snRNP and polyadenylation signals Nature. 2013; 499 :360-363 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yin et al., 2020 61. Yin, Y. ∙ Lu, J.Y. ∙ Zhang, X. ... U1 snRNP regulates chromatin retention of noncoding RNAs Nature. 2020; 580 :147-150 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). This transient system allowed us to track the alterations of pluripotent and totipotent genes caused directly by spliceosomal repression in mouse ESCs.
We then analyzed the splicing efficiency (SE) of different groups of genes ( Figure 7 D). As expected, we detected a dramatically decreased SE and widespread intron retention of downregulated genes containing pluripotent (blastocyst) and other genes after 4 h of 10 nM PlaB treatment. Surprisingly, upregulated totipotent genes can still be processed efficiently in the whole drug treatment process for 6 h ( Figures 7 E, 7F, and S7 C; Table S3 ). RT-PCR was performed to verify this analysis, and we detected obvious intron retention of pluripotent genes (BCL3 and KLF2) and efficient splicing of totipotent genes (BTG2 and ZSCAN4C) appearing in parallel in ESCs treated with PlaB for 4–6 h ( Figure 7 G). We therefore speculated that mRNA processing of totipotent genes was insensitive to spliceosomal inhibition. To experimentally test this, we cloned genomic regions containing two exons and one intron of the BCL3, KLF2, BTG2, and ZSCAN4C genes into a pCMV2-expressing vector to generate minigene reporter plasmids. These plasmids were then transfected into mouse ESCs without or with PlaB treatment at different concentrations for 6 h, and samples were collected for RT-PCR analysis ( Figure 7 H). We found, as expected, that splicing of the two pluripotent genes was blocked dramatically by PlaB treatment but that the two totipotent genes could still be spliced efficiently ( Figure 7 H).
The reduction in SE (and increase in intron retention) correlated well with the expression decrease of pluripotent genes during pluripotent-to-totipotent stem cell transition that were induced by PlaB at high concentration or by siRNAs transiently as well as by multiple passages in SLP medium ( Figures 7 I and S7 D). Because intron retention induces transcription suppression ( Braunschweig et al., 2014 6. Braunschweig, U. ∙ Barbosa-Morais, N.L. ∙ Pan, Q. ... Widespread intron retention in mammals functionally tunes transcriptomes Genome Res. 2014; 24 :1774-1786 Crossref Scopus (452) PubMed Google Scholar ), we considered that, in mouse ESCs, dynamic spliceosomal repression causes widespread splicing inhibition, which leads to transcriptional repression of pluripotent genes but has little effect on splicing of totipotent genes.
Because we also observed that totipotent genes were transiently activated after 1 h of 10 nM PlaB treatment ( Figures 7 C and S7 B), we hypothesized that dynamic spliceosomal repression could affect gene transcription directly in mouse ESCs. To test this, we used 4-thiouridine-sequencing (4sU-seq) to measure the transient transcriptome of mouse ESCs as well as differentiated human cells (H1299) as a control, both of which were treated with PlaB at high concentration. This transient transcriptomic analysis showed that, after only 1 h of PlaB treatment, 1,746 genes containing totipotent genes were transcriptionally activated in mouse ESCs, whereas only 210 genes were induced in H1299 cells ( Figures 7 J and 7K). To understand the different behavior of totipotent and pluripotent genes responding to spliceosomal repression, we analyzed the features of different types of genes and found that totipotent genes have much fewer and shorter introns than pluripotent and other downregulated genes ( Figures 7 L and 7M). This discovery is consistent with a recent study in Drosophila showing that genes expressed at the zygote genome activation (ZGA) stage are normally short with few, if any, introns ( Kwasnieski et al., 2019 24. Kwasnieski, J.C. ∙ Orr-Weaver, T.L. ∙ Bartel, D.P. Early genome activation in Drosophila is extensive with an initial tendency for aborted transcripts and retained introns Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1188-1197 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reveal that dynamic spliceosomal repression in mouse ESCs results in widespread splicing inhibition, leading to expression decreases of pluripotent genes, whereas affects splicing of totipotent genes little and activates their transcription, although the detailed mechanism needs to be explored further.

Section: Discussion

In this study, through spliceosomal repression, we realized in vitro establishment and culture of mouse totipotent stem cells molecularly and functionally close to in vivo 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, which we named TBLCs. We find that knockdown of several key splicing factors broadly induces totipotent genes and silences pluripotent genes to reprogram mouse pluripotent ESCs into a totipotent state. By adding the splicing inhibitor PlaB to serum/LIF medium, we are able to culture and maintain TBLCs in vitro for multiple passages. Multi-omics analyses reveal that, distinct from 2C-like cells and EPSCs, TBLCs are comparable with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres at the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels. Functional chimeric assays demonstrate that TBLCs possess a robust bidirectional developmental capacity to generate embryonic and extraembryonic tissue, including TE of blastocysts, EPC and ExE of E6.5–E7.5 embryos, as well as placenta and yolk sac tissue of chimeric conceptuses. Using scRNA-seq, we prove that TBLCs are able to differentiate into at least 6 extraembryonic and 15 embryonic cell types in the placenta and yolk sac tissue at the single-cell level. Finally, we discover that, in mouse ESCs, dynamic spliceosome repression results in widespread intron retention that leads to expression decrease of pluripotent genes, whereas totipotent genes can still be spliced efficiently and are transcriptionally activated. This might be related to the unique gene features of totipotent genes with short and few introns. Our study not only provides a means for in vitro capturing and culture of totipotent stem cells but also highlights an unexpected role of spliceosomes in stem cell fate transition.
Forty years ago, mouse ESCs were established successfully for the first time, and to date, all cultured ESCs are in a pluripotent state ( Evans and Kaufman, 1981 14. Evans, M.J. ∙ Kaufman, M.H. Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos Nature. 1981; 292 :154-156 Crossref Scopus (6835) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hackett and Surani, 2014 15.

Recently, two research groups claimed to have established EPSCs using different chemical cocktails that can give rise to embryonic and extraembryonic tissues ( Yang et al., 2017a 59. Yang, J. ∙ Ryan, D.J. ∙ Wang, W. ... Establishment of mouse expanded potential stem cells Nature. 2017; 550 :393-397 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar , 2017b 60.

Derivation of Pluripotent Stem Cells with In Vivo Embryonic and Extraembryonic Potency Cell. 2017; 169 :243-257.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, EPSCs possess molecular features similar to in vivo totipotent blastomeres because these cells still highly express pluripotent genes and do not activate totipotent genes. In contrast, TBLCs globally silence pluripotent genes and widely activate totipotent genes and the transposons MERVL and MT2. Using multi-omics analyses, we characterized the features of TBLCs, which were similar to 2- and 4-cell embryos at various molecular levels.
A recent study has systematically analyzed the molecular features and differentiation potential of EPSCs, which are not only consistent with our analysis showing that EPSCs are molecularly close to blastocysts but also question the extraembryonic development potential of these cells ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our chimeric assays demonstrate that one single TBLC is able to generate EPC, ExE, and EPI tissue of E6.5–E7.5 embryos, strongly proving the robust bidirectional embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential close to in vivo totipotent blastomeres. In comparison, only a few EPSC-derived cells can be detected in the ExE region that seemed to be colocalized with OCT4 ( Posfai et al., 2021 31. Posfai, E. ∙ Schell, J.P. ∙ Janiszewski, A. ... Evaluating totipotency using criteria of increasing stringency Nat. Cell Biol. 2021; 23 :49-60 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2017a 59. Yang, J. ∙ Ryan, D.J. ∙ Wang, W. ... Establishment of mouse expanded potential stem cells Nature. 2017; 550 :393-397 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although side-by-side functional comparisons of EPSCs and TBLCs still need to be performed, our scRNA-seq analysis verified that TBLCs have a robust totipotent development capability to generate 6 extraembryonic and 15 embryonic cell types in the placenta and yolk sac at single-cell resolution. We found that pluripotent/totipotent stem cell transition can be easily realized by manipulating PlaB in serum/LIF medium, which provides a useful ex vivo system to remodel 2-cell-to-blastocyst embryonic development in vivo , whereas EPSCs cannot.
Emerging studies have suggested important roles of various RNA-regulatory pathways during early embryo development and stem cell differentiation ( Choi et al., 2017b 8. Choi, Y.J. ∙ Lin, C.P. ∙ Risso, D. ... Deficiency of microRNA miR-34a expands cell fate potential in pluripotent stem cells Science. 2017; 355 :eaag1927 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ; Du et al., 2015 11.

Asymmetric Expression of LincGET Biases Cell Fate in Two-Cell Mouse Embryos Cell. 2018; 175 :1887-1901.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ), but until now, the possible roles of dynamic spliceosomal changes in ESC fate transition and early embryo development were unknown. We found that transient knockdown of 10 individual splicing factors belonging to different core subunits of spliceosome in mouse ESCs drive pluripotent-to-totipotent stem cell transition by widely activating totipotent genes and generally suppressing pluripotent genes. Surprisingly, we observed that spliceosomal repression transiently induced by the splicing inhibitor PlaB causes widespread intron retention and dramatic SE reduction, resulting in expression decreases of pluripotent genes. However, totipotent genes are transcriptionally activated and spliced efficiently, which is related to their unique features with few and short introns. Our discovery is consistent with a recent study revealing that ZGA genes (comparable with totipotent genes activated particularly at the 2- and 4-cell stage in mice) are short with few, if any, introns in Drosophila ( Kwasnieski et al., 2019 24. Kwasnieski, J.C. ∙ Orr-Weaver, T.L. ∙ Bartel, D.P. Early genome activation in Drosophila is extensive with an initial tendency for aborted transcripts and retained introns Genome Res. 2019; 29 :1188-1197 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Combined with the dynamic expression changes of many splicing factors during preimplantation embryonic development in the mouse, we propose that the splicing-dependent function of spliceosomes, but not other non-splicing effects of certain splicing factors, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) dependent on ISY1 ( Du et al., 2018 12. Du, P. ∙ Pirouz, M. ∙ Choi, J. ... An Intermediate Pluripotent State Controlled by MicroRNAs Is Required for the Naive-to-Primed Stem Cell Transition Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22 :851-864.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), plays a dominant role in totipotent stem cell/PSC transition.
Although serum/LIF medium supplemented with PlaB allows maintenance of TBLCs for multiple passages, the proliferation rate of TBLCs is not as high as that of pluripotent ESCs. Thus, the culture condition requires further optimization. We also still do not fully understand the molecular basis of self-renewal of TBLCs, and the mechanism for the different effects of spliceosomes on pluripotent and totipotent genes needs to be explored in detail. It will be of great interest to test whether spliceosomal repression can dominate human pluripotent-to-totipotent stem cell transition and enable culture of human ESCs with higher differentiation potential in the future. The potential applications and use of TBLCs in various in vitro differentiation and organoid culture systems will be very important and essential for stem cell regeneration medicine.

All animal experiments were performed according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University. ICR WT (Stock no: 201) and C57BL/6 (C57) WT (Stock no: 213) mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology. Healthy male and female mice were housed and bred in Beijing Vitalstar Biotechnology Laboratory and Laboratory Animal Research Center of Tsinghua University. Mice were fed regular chow and housed in a controlled room under a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle at 22°C. Chimeric experiments were performed on 8-14 weeks old female mice. Mouse 8-cell embryos were obtained by flushing the uterus of pregnant ICR or C57BL/6J mice with M2 medium (Millipore, MR-015-D). Embryos were cultured in KSOM medium (Millipore, MR-020P-5F) drops covered with mineral oil (Sigma, M8410) and cultured under 5% CO 2 at 37°C.
All mouse cell lines were cultured under 20% O 2 and 5% CO 2 at 37°C. The media were refreshed daily. TC1, TC1-EGFP, V6.5 and reporter cell lines were cultured on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers or 0.2% gelatin (Sigma, G1890) in Serum/LIF medium composed of DMEM (GIBCO, 11965092) supplemented with 15% FBS (GIBCO, 1009914), 1X L-glutamine (GIBCO, 25030081), 1X penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO, 15140163), 1X non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (GIBCO, 11140050), 1X sodium pyruvate (GIBCO, 11360070), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (ThermoFisher, 60-24-2) and 1000 U/mL mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (mLIF) (Millipore, ESG1107).
C57-EGFP were cultured on MEF feeder layers in N2B27-2i medium containing a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 (GIBCO, 11330032) and Neurobasal (GIBCO, 21103049), 0.5X N2 supplement (GIBCO, 17502048), 0.5X B27 supplement (GIBCO, 17504044), 2% BSA, 1X L-glutamine, 1X penicillin-streptomycin, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1000 U/mL mLIF, 3 μM CHIR99021 (Selleck, S1263) and 0.5 μM PD0325901 (Selleck, S1036). The two inhibitors were added to the N2B27 medium just before use. The complete N2B27-2i medium was stored at 4°C for up to 7 days.
Feeder cells were seeded (5 ∗ 10 4 cells per cm 2 ) onto 0.2% gelatin-coated dishes at least 12 h before seeding mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). MEF plates were used within 7 days.
To generate TBLCs (totipotent blastomere-like cells), mouse ESCs were cultured in SLP medium (Serum/LIF medium supplemented with 2.5 nM PlaB (Tocris, 6070)). Cells were passaged every 2-4 days with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and seeded on MEF feeder layers at split ratios between 1:2 to 1:6. For the first passage, cells were plated on feeders in Serum/LIF medium. On the following day, medium was changed into SLP medium. After 5 passages, TBLCs were generated for further experiments. SLP medium was used within one week.
To generate TBLCs transiently induced by siRNAs targeting splicing factors, siRNA transfections were performed with a concentration of 50 nM. TBLCs (siRNA) were collected 60 h after transfection and used for multiple follow-up experiments.
To convert TBLCs to rPSCs (reversed pluripotent stem cells), TC1-EGFP and OCT4-GFP reporter cells were cultured in SLP medium until passage 6. Then, cells were further cultured in Serum/LIF medium. It usually took 3 passages to achieve full transition.
To generate lentiviral particles encoding the EGFP gene, pSIN-EGFP, pLP1, pLP2 and pVSVG plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells. The lentivirus-containing medium was harvested at day 2 after transfection. TC1 cells were then transduced by incubating with the appropriate volume of lentiviral particles for 48 h. Next, EGFP + cells were selected by flow cytometry and seeded at a low density. Single-cell clones appeared within one week. EGFP + clones were then picked up, digested and expanded.
All siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 3000 (Invitrogen, 11668019) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, Lipofectamine 3000 reagent and siRNAs were separately diluted in Opti-MEM medium (GIBCO, 31985070). Then, the diluted siRNAs were added to the diluted Lipofectamine 3000 reagent, followed by 20 min incubation at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixtures were added to the cell suspension. After 60 h, the cells were collected and analyzed. siRNAs used in this study are listed in Table S5 .
All mouse embryo microinjection and transplantation experiments were performed in Beijing Vitalstar Biotechnology Laboratory and Laboratory Animal Research Center of Tsinghua University. Before injection, PSCs or TBLCs (C57-EGFP and TC1-EGFP cell lines) were trypsinized using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in M2 medium. The cell suspension was incubated at 4°C for at least 30 min before cell injection.
The 8-cell mouse embryos were flushed out of the uterus of pregnant ICR or C57BL/6J mice with M2 medium and transferred to M2 droplets covered with mineral oil for follow-up injection.
To obtain E4.5 chimeras, single cell or 6 cells were injected into each 8-cell ICR mouse embryo. The injected embryos were cultured in KSOM drops for an additional 36-48 h. Next, chimeric embryos were imaged, fixed and immunostained.
To obtain E6.5-E7.5 chimeras, single cell or multiple cells (10-15) were injected into each 8-cell ICR mouse embryo. After injection, the embryos were recovered in KSOM drops for 1-2 h. Then, 10-15 chimeric embryos were transferred to a surrogate mouse and dissected at E6.5-E7.5. For E13.5 chimeras, the conceptuses were dissected at E13.5 developmental stage. In Figure 5 , chimeric conceptuses (siSNRPD2) were derived from C57-EGFP chimeric embryos. Chimeric conceptuses (siISY1 and SLP medium) were derived from TC1-EGFP chimeric embryos.
E4.5 chimeric embryos were washed three times in PBS droplets by mouth pipetting. Subsequently, embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by permeabilization in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C. After washing three times in washing solution (PBS/0.1% Tween-20/0.01% Triton X-100), nonspecific antigens in the embryos were blocked in PBS/3% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibody anti-CDX-2 (BioGenex, AM392) was diluted at a concentration of 1:200 in PBS/3% BSA. Embryos were then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Next, the embryos were washed in washing solution. Secondary antibody Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 568) (Abcam, ab175471) was diluted in washing solution at 1:500. The embryos were incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After the final washes, the nuclei were stained with DAPI (Solarbio, C0065) for 7 min. Next, the embryos were transferred to microdroplets covered with mineral oil in confocal dish. Confocal microscope imaging was performed using NIKON A1R.
Mouse post-implantation chimeras at E7.5 were fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 min and were permeabilized with PBS/1% Triton X-100/0.5% Tween-20 at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times in washing solution (PBS/0.1% Tween-20/0.01% Triton X-100), nonspecific antigens in the embryos were blocked in PBS/10% BSA/5% donkey serum overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies were diluted at a concentration of 1:200 in PBS/1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100. Then, the embryos were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were diluted at 1:500 in PBS/1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100. The embryos were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 4°C. After the final washes, the nuclei were stained with DAPI for 15 min. Next, the embryos were transferred to microdroplets covered with mineral oil in a confocal dish. Confocal microscope imaging was performed using ZEISS LSM880. The brightness and contrast of the images were adjusted using Fiji. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-ELF5 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376737), anti-OCT4 (1:250, Abcam, ab181557) and anti-GFP (1:250, Abcam, ab6662).
E13.5 chimeric embryos were dissected on ice in PBS/10% FBS. Using fine-pointed forceps, the fetus, yolk sac and placenta were separated and imaged using stereo fluorescence microscope (Leica, M205 FCA) to observe EGFP + cell localization. The brightness and contrast of the images were adjusted using Fiji. All tissues were washed with PBS before digestion. Embryos, placentas and yolk sacs were cut into small pieces of approximately 1 mm on ice. Placentas were digested at 37°C with accutase (GIBCO, A1110501) for 10 min. For yolk sacs, tissues were digested at 37°C with collagenase IV (GIBCO, 17104019) supplemented with 1 U/mL DNase (Promega, M6101) for 5 min and further digested with TrypLE (GIBCO, 12605028) for 3 min. Embryos were digested at 37°C with collagenase IV supplemented with 1 U/mL DNase for 30 min and further digested with TrypLE for 5 min. Then the reaction was stopped by adding PBS/10% FBS. Tissues were further dispersed by pipetting. Cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 5 min at 4°C and then resuspended in PBS/10% FBS.
Cells were digested into single cells using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspension was then filtered through 40 μm cell strainers. Next, the samples were analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa device. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software.
E13.5 placentas were fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. After fixation, samples were embedded in O.C.T (SAKURA, 4583). Compound and were frozen using liquid nitrogen vapor. Tissue sections of 5-10 μm thickness were cut in a cryostat microtome and transferred onto histological slides.
Before immunohistochemistry, slides were incubated at 37°C for 10-20 min and transferred into an immunohistochemical antigen repair box. Then, the appropriate antigen retrieval buffer was added. The box was microwaved under medium heat for 8 min. After standing in microwave for 8 min, the box was microwaved under medium low heat for 7 min. After cooling down, the slides were washed in PBS while shaking. A hydrophobic barrier was drawn around the tissue with a Pap pen. To reduce nonspecific binding, samples were blocked at room temperature for 30 min with blocking buffer PBS/3% BSA. Next, the samples were incubated with diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Following three washes in PBS, samples were incubated in diluted secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing three times in PBS, the nuclei were stained with DAPI. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-TPBPA (1:100, Abcam, ab104401), anti-Proliferin (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-271891) and anti-GFP (1:100, Abcam, ab6662).
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596026) was used to isolate total RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 mL TRIzol reagent was added into each well of a 6-well plate. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, 0.2 mL chloroform was added for phase separation and incubated for 2 min. Then the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new Eppendorf and 0.5 mL isopropanol was added to precipitate the RNA. After mixing, the samples were incubated for 1 h at −20°C, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the RNA pellets were washed with 75% ethanol. Finally, the RNA pellets were air-dried and dissolved in RNase-free water. For mRNA q.RT-PCR analysis, 1 μg RNA was converted into cDNA using HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, R223). Then, 2X Realtime PCR Mix (Mei5 Biotech, MF013) and Applied Biosystems SteponePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher) were used to quantify the cDNA in duplicate or triplicate. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH. All primers used for qPCR are listed in Table S4 .
RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, P0013B) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF (Beyotime, ST506) was used to extract the whole cell lysates, which was then mixed with 4X NuPAG buffer and boiled at 98°C for 15 min. Protein samples were run on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel (1.5 mm) (ThermoFisher, NP0336PK2). After transferring the proteins to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPVH07850), the membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies were incubated with the membrane in 5% skimmed milk at 4°C overnight. Following three washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h while shaking. The membrane was detected by BeyoECL Plus (Beyotime, P0018A). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-ACTIN (1:5000, ABclonal, AC004), anti-SNRPD2 (1:2000, Abcam, ab198296), anti-PUF60 (1:1000, ABclonal, A6709), anti-ISY1 (1:2000, Abcam, ab121250), anti-EFTUD2 (1:1000, ABclonal, A7040) and anti-LSM4 (1:1000, ABclonal, A5891).
For TC1, 50,000 cells were seeded in each gelatin-coated well of a 6-well plate and were cultured in Serum/LIF medium supplemented with different PlaB concentrations. Every concentration had three repeats. After three days, the number of cells was counted.
For V6.5, 10,000 cells were seeded in each gelatin-coated well of a 6-well plate and cultured in Serum/LIF medium supplemented with PlaB at different concentrations. Every concentration had three repeats. After four days, the number of cells was counted.
For TC1-EGFP, 10,000 cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well plate on feeder cells and were cultured in Serum/LIF medium supplemented with PlaB at different concentrations. Number of cells was analyzed by flow cytometry every day until the 5th day.
Cells were trypsinized and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 100 μL 1X Binding Buffer at a concentration of 0.25-1.0 ∗ 10 7 cells/ml. Next, 5 μL Annexin V-PE and 5 μL 7-AAD Staining Solution were added. The cell suspension was gently mixed using a pipette and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, 400 μL 1X Binding Buffer was added to each tube. Cells were further analyzed by flow cytometry.
Exons and introns of target genes were amplified by PCR using primers containing restriction sites (NotI and EcoRI) and cloned into the pCMV2 expression vector. The length of spliced and unspliced fragments and the exon number are listed in Figure 7 H. For transfection, TC1 were seeded on feeders in 6-well plates. After 24 hours, the cells were transfected with 1 μg minigene plasmids using Lipofectamine™ 3000 and at the same time, treated with high concentration PlaB. The cells were treated with 0 nM, 10 nM, 20 nM and 40 nM PlaB for 6 hours and harvested for RT-PCR analysis.
For sample preparation, 1 μg total RNA and TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, RS-122-2101) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library samples were subjected to Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system. For the analysis of RNA-seq data, Trimmomatic software was used to trim the adapters. Hisat2 software was used for the alignment to the mm10 reference genome with default parameters. The expression count matrix was obtained by FeatureCounts. For the TBLCs (SLP) sequencing, data were normalized by total mapped reads of each library (CPM: count per million). Expression changes were calculated based on the following formula: FC (Fold change) = (CPMa+5)/(CPMb+5). Genes showing expressional changes (FC > 3 or < 0.5) were further clustered by Pheatmap R package. For the TBLCs (siRNA) of TC1 and V6.5 cells, different expression genes were calculated by DESeq2. The published expression profiles of EPSCs including D-mc6/D-OG cells were obtained from GEO database (GSE89303). L-AB2/L-DR10 cells were obtained from EBI database (ERP005641) as raw data sequencing reads. Raw data were then analyzed as the same process of TBLCs (SLP). To quantify the expression level of repeats in TBLCs, the reads were mapped to the mm10 repeats (RepeatMasker) reference downloaded from USCS browser and the samtools idxstats command was used to count transposons of the same family. Pheatmap R package was used to show the expression in different libraries.
Cell culture medium was removed and replaced with new medium containing 4-thiouridine (Sigma, T4509) at a final concentration of 500 μM. After 10 min treatment, the medium was immediately removed and the cells were washed once with PBS. TRIzol reagent was added to the plate to extract RNA (∼150 μg total RNA). Then, the RNA was used to perform the thiol-specific biotinylation reaction with Biotin-HPDP (ThermoFisher, 21341) as follows: 1 μL 10X biotinylation Buffer (100 mM Tris 1 M pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA), and 2 μL biotin-HPDP (1 mg/ml DMF) were added to 1 μg RNA. After mixing, the sample was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 h on a lab rotator. The unlabeled biotin was removed using Phase Lock Gel Heavy (TIANGEN, WM5-2302831). In short, the Phase Lock Gel tube was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 30 s before use. The reaction with an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was mixedtransferred to the Phase Lock Gel tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 x g. The upper aqueous phase was then transferred into a new tube. Next, 5 M NaCl (1/10 of the aqueous phase volume), ethanol (2.5 of the volume) and 2 μL GlycoBlue (15 mg/ml) was added, and incubated at −80°C overnight to precipitate RNA. In the following day, the mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 x g at 4°C. After washing with 75% ethanol, the RNA was dissolved in 1 mL RPB Buffer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl 1 M pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). Meanwhile, 300 μL Streptavidin MagneSphere Paramagnetic Particles (Promega, Z5482) were washed with 1 mL wash buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl 1 M pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) for four times. After resuspending the beads in 1 mL wash buffer, Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (Sigma, P5288) was added to a final concentration of 0.1% per reaction and the beads were incubated for 10 min at room temperature while rotating. Then the beads were washed with 1 mL wash buffer. The biotinylated RNA were incubated at 65°C for 5 min and immediately placed on ice for 2 min. Subsequently, the RNA was added to the beads, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature while rotating. The beads containing the RNA were washed five times with 1 mL 4TU wash buffer (1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl 1 M pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween). The sample was placed on a magnetic separator and the RNA was eluted by adding 75 μL of 100 mM DTT, and incubated for 15 min at temperature on a lab rotator. The sample was placed on a magnetic separator and the elution was transferred to a new tube. The elution step was repeated. Finally, the two elutions were pooled, and 15 μL 3 M NaAcetate, 1 μL GlycoBlue (15 mg/ml), 400 μL ethanol were added. The elution was incubated at −80°C overnight to precipitate RNA. In the following day, the sample was centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 x g at 4°C and the obtained 4sU-labeled RNA was dissolved in 12 μL RNase-free H 2 O. For sample preparation, 200 ng 4sU-labeled RNA and TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kits were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Library samples were subjected to Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing system. All reads were trimmed by Trimmomatic. The reads which were not aligned to the mm10 repeats or BK000964.3 (rRNA) sequence were used to mapped to the mm10 reference genome with the same commands in PolyA(+) RNA-seq analysis.
In total, 100 ng genomic DNA was used as input material, and the DNA was fragmented into around 200 bp by Covaris. DNA was bisulfite-converted using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold™ Kit (Zymo, D5005). Bisulfite-converted DNA was captured using Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq DNA Library Kit (Swift Biosciences, 30024). Library samples were subjected to Illumina Nova-seq 6000 sequencing system. Paired-end reads were trimmed by Trimmomatic software with default parameters. The cleaned data were aligned to the mm10 reference with Bismark/Bowtie2 mode. Duplicate reads were removed by deduplicate_bismark command and the methylation calls were extracted from unique alignment using bismark_methylation_extractor with “–bedGraph” parameter. The methylation calls from both Waston and Crick strand were combined for the following analysis. Bismark2summary command was used to calculate the genome CpG methylation level. RnBeads R package was used to calculate the percentage of methylation in different regions. The DNA methylation data of preimplantation embryo cells were downloaded from GEO database (GSE56697) for Figure S4 B.
For sample preparation, cells were washed and resuspended in 1X PBS (calcium and magnesium free) containing 0.04% BSA. Next, 10,000 living cells were loaded on a Chromium Single Cell Controller to generate Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) containing all cDNAs. Recovered cDNAs were used to construct library using Single Cell 3′ Library and Gel Bead Kit V2 (10x Genomic, PN-120237) or V3 (10x Genomic, PN-1000075) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For placenta and yolk sac of E13.5 (TBLC derived from C57-EGFP) and E14.5 (TBLC derived from TC1-EGFP), digested cells were resuspended in DMEM/10% FBS, and filtered through 70 μm cell strainers. EGFP + cells were sorted by flow cytometry, and around 12,000 living cells were subsequently used for 10x Genomics’ scRNA-seq. Library samples were subjected to Illumina HiSeq X Ten and Nova-seq 6000 sequencing system. scRNA-seq data were aligned and quantified using cellranger count pipeline 3.0.2 against the mm10 reference genome. Seurat R package was used to merge the scRNA-seq and cell clustering. For Figures 3 and S3 , the single cell samples were merged with merge function, and the TBLC-derived E13.5-E14.5 placenta and yolk sac samples were integrated with FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData. Filtration criteria are shown in Table S6 . Gene expression was calculated by “LogNormalize” method in NormalizeData function. RunPCA function was used in principal component analysis (PCA) with 2000 variable genes. Cell clusters were identified by a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization based on clustering algorithm with FindClusters function. The t-SNE dimensionality reduction was generated using the RunTSNE function and the UMAP was performed with the RunUMAP function. Differentially expressed genes in the TBLC-derived E13.5-E14.5 placenta and yolk sac samples were identified using FindAllMarkers and signature genes (top 20 DEGs) of each placenta and yolk sac cell are shown in Table S7 . Heatmaps were plotted by the DoHeatmap function. The average expression of pluripotent genes and totipotent genes was calculated after Min-Max normalization. The scRNA-seq data of preimplantation embryo cells were downloaded from GEO database (GSE45719).
ATAC-seq was performed as previously described ( Corces et al., 2017 9. Corces, M.R. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ∙ Hamilton, E.G. ... An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :959-962 Crossref Scopus (1214) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Cells were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, and resuspended in 1X PBS (calcium and magnesium free). For the ATAC-seq library preparation, 50,000 viable cells were used and collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 M NaCl, 1 M MgCl 2 , 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.01% Digitonin) and incubated on ice for 3 min. Then, the cell pellets were washed with 1 mL wash buffer (1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 M NaCl, 1 M MgCl 2 and 0.1% NP40) by inverting the tube three times. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 r cf. for 10 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended with 50 μL transposition mix (5X TTBL 10 μl, TTE Mix V50 5 μl, ddH 2 O 50 μl, Vazyme #TD501). Mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min with 1000 rpm shaking. Mixtures were purified with a Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo, DP4033) and amplified for 10 cycles using Q5 HF Master Mix (NEB, M0492S). Amplification products were further purified with a Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit. Next, the samples were subjected to Illumina Nova-seq 6000 sequencing system. The ATAC-seq data were processed using ATAC-seq pipeline from Kundaje lab. The input JSON file included genomic data files and parameters for running the pipeline. Using the autodetected adaptor mode, the “atac.cutadapt_param” was set to “-e 0.1 -m 5.” Bowtie2 was used to align the reads to genome reference. The “atac.multinapping” was set to “0,” the “atac.bowtie2_param_pe” was set to “-X2000–mm–local.” After the alignment, duplicates were removed by Picard. Only uniquely mapped alignments (MAPQ > 10) were included for further analyses. The “atac.smooth_win” parameter for MACS2 was set to “200” and “atac.idr_thresh” was set to “0.1.” We merged the peaks called by MACS2 in a project, using merge and multicov commands of BedTools software to calculate the count of the merged peaks. EdgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 36. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (26703) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to normalize the raw count matrix and differential peaks. The analysis used exactTest function setting bcv equals to 0.1 for genetically identical model organisms. ATAC-seq data of preimplantation embryo cells were obtained from GEO database (GSE66390) and processed with the above flow.
TC1 cells were cultured in 100 mm dish coated with 0.2% gelatin in SLP medium. After three passages, Cycloheximide (Coolaber, CC4071) was added to the Serum/LIF medium at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Cells were incubated with Cycloheximide-supplemented medium at 37°C for 2 min. Then, the culture medium was discarded quickly. The dish containing cells was placed on ice and gently washed once with cold PBS/Cycloheximide (0.1 mg/mL). Subsequently, 1 mL PBS/Cycloheximide was added to dish. The cells were scraped off the dish and transferred to a pre-chilled 1.5 mL RNase-free Eppendorf tube. After centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellets were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen for 1 h and stored at −80°C until further use. The company, Lc-bio Technologies, constructed the Ribo-seq libraries and performed the preliminary bioinformatics analysis.
Splicing efficiency (SE) was equal to all spliced reads divided by the sum of spliced reads and the reads span the splicing sites. The reads were extracted from the bam files if the quality was less than 20. The exon-exon junctions (spliced reads) were extracted from the regtools junction extract command, and the spliced-region annotation was obtained from regtools junction annotation command. We counted the reads in the spliced-region ± 148bp as the un-spliced reads. The relative SE and intron retention values in Figures 7 E and 7I were calculated by subtracting the SE of the gene in control group from the SE of the treatment group, and for Figure 7 I was scaled to −1 to 1. For Figure S7 D, the relative SE of a gene represented the proportion of the sum in all samples.
PCA analysis was performed by PCA function in FactoMineR R package and clustering analysis was processed by hclust function. We used different methods to normalize in order to compare different data. (1) Min-Max normalization was used for Figures 2 E and S3 B. (2) TBLCs (siSNRPD2) and TBLCs (SLP, P6) were normalized by log-transformation and subsampled 200 cells for each dataset for Figure S3 G. (3) EPSCs and TBLCs RNA-seq were normalized to ESCs for Figures 3 D, 3F, and S3 I. Before PCA and clustering analysis for transcriptome, Removebatcheffect function in Limma R package ( Ritchie et al., 2015 35. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (21697) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used. We merged the methylation level between mouse embryos and TBLCs in different regions to perform PCA analysis for Figure 4 E.
ToppGene online analysis was used for Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment. Terms that had a p-value < 0.05 was defined as significantly enriched.
GSEA was performed using rank fold change values against two datasets in Table S2 . The enrichment score was calculated by GSEA function in clusterProfiler R package ( Yu et al., 2012 63. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Crossref Scopus (18505) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Differential gene expression analysis with replicate samples was performed by DESeq2 R package. EdgR R package was used in the translatome and ATAC-seq analysis. Differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.05 and log2(fold change) > 1 were considered significant.
The visualization of different tracks was performed using IGV.
Statistical analyses were performed by Prism software (GraphPad Software 7) and R software version 3.6.0. Significance is defined as a p-value less than 0.05 indicated with asterisk ( ∗ p-value < 0.05, ∗∗ p-value < 0.1, ∗∗∗ p-value < 0.001). The statistical tests used and the p-value s are listed on figures and figure legends. For q.RT-PCR analysis in Figures 1 C and S1 B, two different siRNAs were used for each splicing factor as biological replicates, except for ISY1 and PUF60. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Error bar represents the standard deviation (SD) of the mean of the triplicates. For q.RT-PCR in Figures S2 C and S2F, experiments were performed in duplicate. For cell proliferation analysis in Figures S2 A, S2B, and S2E, three biological replicates were included, error bar represent the SD of the mean of the three biological replicates. For the differential analysis in Figures 1 D and S1 E, two biological replicates were included. For the single-cell RNA-seq in Figures 6 C–6E, S6 B, and S6C, two biological replicates were included, containing samples of E13.5 and E14.5, and the data of the two biological replicates were merged for further analysis. For the gene features analysis in Figures 7 E, 7L, and S7 D, the genes were listed in different groups in Table S3 .
