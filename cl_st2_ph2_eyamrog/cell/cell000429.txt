Title: Pharmacologic modulation of RNA splicing enhances anti-tumor immunity


Abstract: Summary

Although mutations in DNA are the best-studied source of neoantigens that determine response to immune checkpoint blockade, alterations in RNA splicing within cancer cells could similarly result in neoepitope production. However, the endogenous antigenicity and clinical potential of such splicing-derived epitopes have not been tested. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologic modulation of splicing via specific drug classes generates bona fide neoantigens and elicits anti-tumor immunity, augmenting checkpoint immunotherapy. Splicing modulation inhibited tumor growth and enhanced checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on host T cells and peptides presented on tumor MHC class I. Splicing modulation induced stereotyped splicing changes across tumor types, altering the MHC I-bound immunopeptidome to yield splicing-derived neoepitopes that trigger an anti-tumor T cell response in vivo . These data definitively identify splicing modulation as an untapped source of immunogenic peptides and provide a means to enhance response to checkpoint blockade that is readily translatable to the clinic.

Section: Introduction

Immune checkpoint blockade has greatly improved outcomes for several malignancies that are challenging to treat. Therapeutic benefit is associated with increased mutational burden ( Marabelle et al., 2020 27. Marabelle, A. ∙ Fakih, M. ∙ Lopez, J. ...

Le, D.T. ∙ Durham, J.N. ∙ Smith, K.N. ... Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade Science. 2017; 357 :409-413 Crossref Scopus (4829) PubMed Google Scholar ), commonly attributed to high tumor neoantigen load. Coding mutation-derived neoantigens are best studied, but neoantigens can also arise from other processes, such as altered RNA splicing. Two studies analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data concluded that tumor-specific alternative splicing is abundant and may generate peptides that contribute to epitope repertoires ( Jayasinghe et al., 2018 17.

Another study demonstrated that peptides translated from retained introns arising from incomplete RNA splicing can be presented by MHC I in cancer cell lines ( Smart et al., 2018 40. Smart, A.C. ∙ Margolis, C.A. ∙ Pimentel, H. ... Intron retention is a source of neoepitopes in cancer Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :1056-1058 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). These provided proof-of-concept that splicing-derived peptides may serve as neoepitopes. However, whether splicing-derived neoepitopes elicit an endogenous immune response remains unknown, in part due to the inherent complexity of RNA processing and corresponding challenges with robustly identifying candidate splicing-derived neoantigens.
Determining whether splicing alterations can generate bona fide neoantigens is particularly important given the development of multiple clinical-grade compounds that alter RNA splicing via non-overlapping mechanisms. Many compounds, such as pladienolide B, GEX1A, E7107, and H3B-8800, inhibit the SF3b splicing complex’s interactions with RNA ( Lee et al., 2016 23. Lee, S.C. ∙ Dvinge, H. ∙ Kim, E. ...

Recently, a series of “anti-cancer sulfonamides,” including indisulam and E7820, were found to degrade the accessory splicing factor RBM39 by rendering it a neosubstrate for the Ddb1/CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase ( Han et al., 2017 12. Han, T. ∙ Goralski, M. ∙ Gaskill, N. ... Anticancer sulfonamides target splicing by inducing RBM39 degradation via recruitment to DCAF15 Science. 2017; 356 :eaal3755 Crossref Scopus (428) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, blocking post-translational modifications of splicing factors, which are required for spliceosome assembly and effective splicing catalysis, can robustly perturb splicing. For example, RNA splicing factors are the most heavily arginine-methylated proteins ( Musiani et al., 2019 30. Musiani, D. ∙ Bok, J. ∙ Massignani, E. ... Proteomics profiling of arginine methylation defines PRMT5 substrate specificity Sci. Signal. 2019; 12 :eaat8388 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus, drugs that block asymmetric or symmetric arginine dimethylation by inhibiting type I or II protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) potently perturb splicing ( Fedoriw et al., 2019 9.

Here, we address the central question of whether altered RNA splicing generates immunologically meaningful neoantigens to provoke an effective anti-tumor immune response.

Section: Results

We hypothesized that pharmacologic splicing modulation might generate aberrant mRNAs encoding novel proteins, a subset of which could be translated and presented by MHC I as neoepitopes that provoke anti-tumor immunity. We first tested this by treating cancer cell lines with the RBM39-degrader indisulam at doses sub-inhibitory for growth ( Figure 1 A). This yielded graded RBM39 degradation but little effect on growth ( Figures 1 B, S1 A, and S1B). Across cell lines, ex vivo treatment and drug washout yielded sustained suppression of RBM39 protein following drug removal, with minimal effects on subsequent proliferation or apoptosis ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 C, and S1D). Drug treatment also did not notably change MHC I/II, PD-L1, cytokine, or death receptor expression ( Figures S1 E and S1F). In contrast, identical cells exhibited strikingly durable growth inhibition following engraftment into mice, despite transient drug exposure ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and S1 G). The effect was dose dependent, with increasing drug concentrations causing increased splicing alterations ( Figures S1 H–S1K), reduced tumor growth ( Figures S1 L–S1N), and improved survival ( Figure S1 O).
The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo growth suggested non-tumor cell-autonomous effects. To assess whether splicing alterations stimulated an anti-cancer immune response, we repeated our experiments but engrafted treated B16-F10 cells into Rag2-deficient C57BL/6 mice and, separately, into mice with T or natural killer (NK) cell depletion ( Figure 1 G). In vivo tumor growth inhibition was rescued in lymphocyte-deficient Rag2 recipients and by T cell depletion, but not NK depletion, suggesting a T cell and antigen-dependent mechanism ( Figures 1 H, 1I, and S1 P–S1Y).
To test whether MHC I-bound antigens and CD8 + T cells could be responsible, we evaluated the effects of indisulam versus DMSO pretreatment of isogenic B16-F10 cells with or without CRISPR-mediated knockout (KO) of B2m , encoding β 2 -microglobulin ( Figures 1 J and 1K). B2m KO rescued the growth inhibition induced by indisulam pretreatment ( Figure 1 L). Overall, these results indicate that RBM39 degradation impairs cancer growth in a manner dependent on T cells and tumor MHC I expression.
We similarly observed immune-mediated suppression of tumor growth for MS-023, a splicing modulator that inhibits type I PRMT enzymes ( Eram et al., 2016 8. Eram, M.S. ∙ Shen, Y. ∙ Szewczyk, M. ... A Potent, Selective, and Cell-Active Inhibitor of Human Type I Protein Arginine Methyltransferases ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 :772-781 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ex vivo MC38 treatment with MS-023 concentrations subinhibitory for in vitro growth resulted in globally reduced asymmetric dimethyl arginines (ADMA), but minimal effects on cell growth in vitro after drug washout ( Figures 2 A and S2 A). However, identically treated cells yielded durable suppression of tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice ( Figures 2 B and 2C). These data suggest that splicing modulation can suppress tumor growth in vivo across multiple tumor types and mechanisms of splicing perturbation.
We next tested whether splicing modulation enhanced tumor immune recognition via drug-induced neoantigen production. To explore this, we compared the ability of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) loaded with lysates from control versus drug-treated tumors to stimulate naive, syngeneic T cells ( Figure S2 B). MC38 cells were treated with DMSO, indisulam, or MS-023 and used to generate lysates containing potentially immunogenic peptides, but no drug or viable tumor cells. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from wild-type C57BL/6 or B2m knockout mice were pulsed with lysates and incubated with CD45.1 + splenic T cells. BMDCs loaded with lysates from cells treated with indisulam or MS-023 more strongly promoted CD8 + T cell proliferation than did control BMDCs ( Figures 2 D and 2E). This effect was not observed with B2m KO BMDCs, indicating that MHC I peptide presentation was required.
Our initial studies did not address in vivo splicing modulator treatment, which can affect immune and hematopoietic compartments as well as tumors. To address this, we evaluated the effects of multiple classes of splicing modulators on T cell function: indisulam, MS-023, pladienolide B, GEX1A, and the PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 ( Chan-Penebre et al., 2015 3. Chan-Penebre, E. ∙ Kuplast, K.G. ∙ Majer, C.R. ... A selective inhibitor of PRMT5 with in vivo and in vitro potency in MCL models Nat. Chem. Biol. 2015; 11 :432-437 Crossref Scopus (417) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first assessed the effects of these drugs on the proliferation of CFSE-labeled, naive splenic T cells upon anti-CD3 and CD8 stimulation ( Figure S2 C). With 3 days of exposure, indisulam and the PRMT inhibitors had minimal effects on proliferation (IC 50 ∼1–10 μM), whereas pladienolide B and GEX1A were markedly inhibitory (IC 50 of nMs) ( Figures 2 F, S2 D, and S2E). Measurement of apoptosis and activation markers ( Figure S2 E) confirmed that these SF3b inhibitors were profoundly immunosuppressive.
We next assessed drug effects on T cell function. Indisulam and MS-023 minimally blunted the in vitro cytotoxicity of primed OT-1 T cells against ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing B16-F10 or MC38 cells ( Figures 2 G and S2 F), with little impairment of cell killing at doses <4 μM. Exposure to higher drug concentrations did not inhibit OT-1 T cell secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) ( Figures S2 G and S2H) or degranulation ( Figures S2 I and S2J). We complemented these functional studies by determining the effects of each compound on gene expression in T cells activated with anti-CD3 and CD28 ex vivo ( Figure S2 K). Normally upregulated genes ( Figure S2 L) were markedly attenuated by pladienolide B, and to a lesser extent EPZ015666, whereas indisulam and MS-023 caused much milder changes ( Figure S2 M).
We then evaluated the effect of each drug on in vivo T cell function in response to antigen. Here, donor CD45.1 + T cells were adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated recipients that were either syngeneic (C57BL/6), mismatched for non-MHC “minor” antigens (LP/J), or major MHC mismatched (BALB/c; H-2 b versus H-2 d ) ( Figure S2 N) ( Na et al., 2010 31. Na, I.K. ∙ Lu, S.X. ∙ Yim, N.L. ... The cytolytic molecules Fas ligand and TRAIL are required for murine thymic graft-versus-host disease J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120 :343-356 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). In BALB/c mice, donor T cells showed robust activation and proliferation in response to alloantigen ( Figures 2 H and S2 O–S2Q). Although in vivo treatment with indisulam, MS-023, or EPZ015666 resulted in minimal impairment of T cell function ( Figures S2 P and S2Q), inhibition of both type I and II PRMTs blocked T cell proliferation ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Pladienolide B was similarly suppressive ( Figures 2 H, S2 O, and S2R). These observations were recapitulated in the C56BL/6 → LP/J model ( Figure 2 I). Indisulam, MS-023, and EPZ015666 were permissive to the homeostatic expansion of T cells after syngeneic adoptive transfer ( Figures S2 R and S2S).
Last, we assessed the effects of splicing modulators on hematopoiesis in methylcellulose assays. Normal hematopoiesis was intact at even high μM doses of MS-023 and indisulam, whereas EPZ015666 suppressed hematopoiesis ( Figure S2 T). Pladienolide B suppressed hematopoiesis at nM concentrations ( Figure S2 T). These data indicate that select splicing modulators can be nontoxic at therapeutic concentrations in preclinical models.
We next tested whether perturbing RNA splicing together with immune checkpoint blockade promoted control of established tumors. We evaluated in vivo RBM39 degradation alone or with anti-PD1 by engrafting C57BL/6 mice with syngeneic tumors and treated with splicing inhibitors starting on day 3 and anti-PD1 on day 7, the approximate date range at which tumors became measurable ( Figure S3 A). Simultaneous indisulam and anti-PD1 therapy led to significantly reduced growth of both B16-F10 and MC38 tumors, which exceeded the effects of either drug alone ( Figures 3 A–3F and S3 A) and yielded on-target RBM39 protein reduction ( Figure 3 B). We observed similar benefits in LLC tumors, which are resistant to anti-PD1 monotherapy ( Bertrand et al., 2017 2. Bertrand, F. ∙ Montfort, A. ∙ Marcheteau, E. ... TNFα blockade overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 in experimental melanoma Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :2256 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lesterhuis et al., 2013 24. Lesterhuis, W.J. ∙ Salmons, J. ∙ Nowak, A.K. ... Synergistic effect of CTLA-4 blockade and cancer chemotherapy in the induction of anti-tumor immunity PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e61895 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 3 G and 3H).
We then evaluated MS-023 in vivo , finding that MS-023 treatment significantly improved response to anti-PD1 therapy ( Figures 3 I–3L). For mice engrafted with MC38 cells, combined MS-023 and anti-PD1 treatment resulted in 50% of mice alive and tumor-free 3 months after engraftment (p < 0.001) ( Figure 3 M). These survivors demonstrated immune memory: upon rechallenge 6 months later with MC38 cells (with or without MS-023 pretreatment in vitro before engraftment), they exhibited markedly improved tumor control compared to naive age-matched mice ( Figures S3 B–S3F).
Finally, we assessed potential toxicity in non-tumor tissues. Treatment with indisulam or MS-023 with or without anti-PD1 did not affect blood counts ( Figure S4 A). MC38 tumors exhibited increased CD8 + T cells when indisulam or MS-023 was given with anti-PD1, consistent with intra-tumoral T cell expansion ( Figure S4 B). Drug-treated animals did not exhibit histologic inflammation or increased CD8 + infiltrates in the skin, lung, gut, or liver ( Figures S4 C–S4F). Concordantly, RNA-seq analyses of lung, colon, and splenic T cells from indisulam-treated mice showed mild splicing changes ( Figures S4 G–S4K), and gene pathway analyses did not reveal an inflammatory signature ( Figures S4 L–S4O).
We next determined the molecular mechanisms by which splicing modulation enhances anti-tumor immunity. We assessed how splicing modulation altered tumor cell transcriptomes in murine tumor cell lines treated with DMSO, indisulam, or MS-023, performed high-coverage RNA-seq, and quantified differential gene and isoform expression. Both drugs drove dramatic changes in alternative and constitutive splicing, with differential cassette exon inclusion and constitutive intron retention the most common alterations ( Figures 4 A and S5 A–S5C; Tables S1 and S2 ). Identical experiments in human tumor cell lines revealed similar changes ( Figures 4 B and S5 D–S5F; Tables S3 and S4 ). A subset of mis-splicing events were consistently induced across all cell lines in a given species ( Figures S5 G–S5I), and 29.0% (indisulam) and 9.1% (MS-023) of mis-spliced genes were mis-spliced in both species ( Figure S5 J), consistent with conserved splicing mechanisms.
Indisulam and MS-023 gave rise to distinct downstream splicing alterations ( Figure S5 K). Indisulam-induced splicing alterations were dominated by reduced splicing efficiency: cassette exons were preferentially not included and constitutive introns were preferentially not excised ( Figures 4 C and 4D). MS-023, in contrast, resulted in more balanced changes ( Figures S5 C and S5F). Nonetheless, convergent mis-splicing between drugs was relatively common (∼4%–8% of mis-spliced events) ( Figures S5 L and S5M). Constitutive introns preferentially retained following indisulam treatment were significantly depleted for poly(AT) ( Figures 4 E and 4F), consistent with RBM39 binding of poly(AT) motifs ( Wang et al., 2019 44. Wang, E. ∙ Lu, S.X. ∙ Pastore, A. ... Targeting an RNA-Binding Protein Network in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cancer Cell. 2019; 35 :369-384.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ) and on-target RBM39 degradation. For MS-023, we observed no such obvious motif enrichment, as expected given the broad effects of type I PRMT inhibition.
We next evaluated the cytoplasmic availability of mis-spliced mRNAs for translation. Because splicing is linked to cytoplasmic mRNA export ( Zhou et al., 2000 49. Zhou, Z. ∙ Luo, M.J. ∙ Straesser, K. ... The protein Aly links pre-messenger-RNA splicing to nuclear export in metazoans Nature. 2000; 407 :401-405 Crossref Scopus (412) PubMed Google Scholar ), splicing alterations could fail to yield novel peptides. We separated nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA pools from DMSO- and indisulam-treated cells (focusing on indisulam because it led to global decreases in splicing efficiency) ( Figure S5 N) and quantified drug-induced isoforms in each subcellular compartment. Indisulam-induced intron retention was readily apparent in the cytoplasmic fraction ( Figures 4 G, S5 O, and S5P), where such mRNAs could be translated into potential neoepitopes ( Figure 4 H).
We finally estimated the potential consequences of indisulam-induced splicing alterations for neoepitope production. We enumerated all 8–14 amino acid sequences (8- to 14-mers) arising from mRNA isoforms in the transcriptome and estimated the binding affinity of each to common MHC I alleles with NetMHCPan. We restricted this list to predicted binders, then epitopes arising from differentially spliced genes, and finally epitopes from isoforms promoted by indisulam treatment. This filtering dramatically reduced the space of potential neoepitopes ( Table S5 ), with most arising from cassette exons and constitutive introns ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Many predicted neoepitopes were shared within mouse (5,764) or human (24,378) cell lines ( Figure S5 Q), whereas fewer (1,763) were shared across species ( Figure S5 R), presumably reflecting non-conserved splicing alterations and differences in binding preferences of murine and human MHC.
We augmented transcriptomic analyses with experimental identification of splicing-derived neoepitopes. We purified H-2K b and H-2D b from DMSO versus indisulam-treated B16-F10 cells, eluted bound peptides, and performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) ( Figure 5 A).
As MHC I-bound peptide identification from mass spectrometry depends critically upon the search database (proteome) ( Murphy et al., 2017 29. Murphy, J.P. ∙ Konda, P. ∙ Kowalewski, D.J. ... MHC-I Ligand Discovery Using Targeted Database Searches of Mass Spectrometry Data: Implications for T-Cell Immunotherapies J. Proteome Res. 2017; 16 :1806-1816 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), we tested four distinct proteomes. These were “full-length” (i.e., all full-length protein sequences in the transcriptome) “predicted binders,” restricted to 8- to 14-mers that were predicted MHC I binders; “predicted binders + spiked non-binders,” augmented with decoy predicted non-binders; and “filtered predicted binders,” restricted to predicted binders from differentially expressed or spliced genes ( Figure 5 B).
We first evaluated the full-length proteome. Approximately 80% and 86% of identified peptides were predicted binders for H-2D b and H-2K b versus 0.6% and 0.9% for peptides randomly sampled from the proteome ( Figures 5 C and S6 A). Repeating this analysis with MHCflurry ( O’Donnell et al., 2018 32. O’Donnell, T.J. ∙ Rubinsteyn, A. ∙ Bonsack, M. ... MHCflurry: Open-Source Class I MHC Binding Affinity Prediction Cell Syst. 2018; 7 :129-132.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ) yielded similar results (not shown). Identified peptides had expected sequence preferences at anchor residues and preferential identification of 9-mers and 8- to 9-mers for H-2D b and H-2K b , respectively ( Figures 5 D, S6 B, and S6C). We next varied the input proteome to maximize peptide identification. Restricting the search to predicted binders increased recovery ∼2-fold relative to the full-length proteome, whereas further restricting to differentially expressed or spliced genes decreased recovery ∼3.4-fold for H-2D b ( Figure 5 E), with similar results for H-2K b ( Figure S6 D). Restricting to predicted binders did not decrease specificity: we identified only 2 predicted non-binders, versus 2,204 predicted binders, across all six replicates when we queried the spiked non-binder proteome for H-2D b ( Figure 5 F), again with similar results for H-2K b ( Figure S6 E). Because the predicted binders proteome maximized yield while minimizing false-positives, we used it for subsequent analyses. The vast majority of identified peptides arose from genes expressed at moderate to high levels in B16-F10 cells ( Figures 5 G and S6 F).
We identified 518 and 366 peptides for H-2D b and H-2K b that were only recovered from indisulam-treated samples ( Figure 5 H). We intersected these with predicted isoform-specific epitopes identified by RNA-seq ( Figure 4 J) to obtain 42 and 28 peptides that were bound by H-2D b and H-2K b , respectively, and arose from mRNA isoforms that were promoted by indisulam treatment ( Figure 5 I; Table S6 ). Due to the known limited sensitivity of mass spectrometry for the MHC I immunopeptidome ( Schuster et al., 2018 36. Schuster, H. ∙ Shao, W. ∙ Weiss, T. ... A tissue-based draft map of the murine MHC class I immunopeptidome Sci. Data. 2018; 5 :180157 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ), we also nominated an additional 39 candidate peptides that were supported by RNA-seq alone, but predicted to be high-affinity binders to H-2D b or H-2K b ( Figure S6 G; Tables S1 and S2 ). We used this set of 109 (70 from mass spectrometry, 39 from RNA-seq) high-confidence, potentially antigenic peptides in subsequent functional assays.
We experimentally assessed binding of each of our 109 candidate neoantigenic peptides, which arose from diverse splicing changes ( Figures 5 I–5M), to H-2D b or H-2K b in the RMA-S stabilization assay ( Figure S7 A) ( De Bruijn et al., 1991 4. De Bruijn, M.L. ∙ Schumacher, T.N. ∙ Nieland, J.D. ... Peptide loading of empty major histocompatibility complex molecules on RMA-S cells allows the induction of primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21 :2963-2970 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; De Silva et al., 1999 5. De Silva, A.D. ∙ Boesteanu, A. ∙ Song, R. ... Thermolabile H-2Kb molecules expressed by transporter associated with antigen processing-deficient RMA-S cells are occupied by low-affinity peptides J. Immunol. 1999; 163 :4413-4420 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Candidate peptides had a range of abilities to stabilize H-2 molecules, with ∼97% (68/70) of peptides identified from both MHC I mass spectrometry and RNA-seq exhibiting some binding, and several exhibiting very strong binding ( Figures 5 N–5Q, 6 A, and S7 B). Negative control “spike-in” peptides showed no binding.
Because MHC I binding is imperfectly correlated with immunogenicity, we experimentally tested each candidate. We immunized naive mice with each of the 109 peptides by hock injection, obtained draining lymph nodes ( Figure 6 B), and performed IFN-γ ELISpot with purified CD8 + T cells incubated with naive, syngeneic splenocytes loaded with DMSO or cognate peptide ( Table S7 ). ∼43% (30/70) of peptides with both mass spectrometry and RNA-seq support elicited a CD8 + T cell response ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S7 C), and several such peptides were induced by indisulam in all tested mouse cancer cell lines ( Figure S6 G). We further confirmed the specificity of these responses by immunizing across a range of peptide doses, revealing a dose-dependent CD8 + T cell response ( Figures 6 E, S7 D, and S7E).
All 39 candidate peptides selected based solely on RNA-seq analyses and MHC I binding predictions exhibited some H-2 binding ( Figure S7 F), and 28% (11/39) were immunogenic in vivo ( Figure S7 G). Our in silico analyses thereby identified a reasonable proportion of splicing-derived, potentially immunogenic peptides, but nonetheless a number of candidate peptides with verified MHC I binding failed to elicit CD8 + T cell activation in vivo ( Figures S7 H–S7J). To understand the basis for this differential response, we interrogated potential distinctions between immunogenic and nonimmunogenic splicing-derived peptides. Analyses of predicted binding affinity (NetMHCpan), experimental ability to stabilize MHC I (RMA-S assay), parent gene expression, type and magnitude of splicing alteration, and predicted induction of NMD revealed that only binding to MHC I (NetMHCpan or RMA-S assay) differed significantly between immunogenic and nonimmunogenic peptides ( Figures 6 F and 6G).
We next tested the ability of CD8 + T cells from peptide-immunized mice to kill tumor cells presenting the cognate peptide. Although DMSO-immunized CD8 + T cells exerted no cytotoxic activity regardless of the peptide presented, CD8 + T cells from mice immunized with an immunogenic peptide selectively killed B16-F10 cells presenting that same peptide ( Figures 7 A and 7B).
Finally, we assessed the endogenous consequences of splicing-derived peptide production by testing whether drug-treated tumors generated neoantigenic peptides at concentrations that activated CD8 + T cells. We repeated the above experiments, but used B16-F10 cells treated with indisulam as APCs ( Figure 7 C). This demonstrated that indisulam treatment of tumor cells indeed stimulates endogenous generation of specific splicing-derived neoantigens that trigger antigen-specific T cell activation ( Figures 7 D–7H). We therefore tested whether indisulam treatment drove the expansion of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells that recognized neoantigenic peptides in vivo ( Figure 7 I). We generated H-2K b tetramers loaded with peptides that elicited strong IFN-γ secretion and cytotoxicity in the above experiments. These were used to stain tumor-draining lymph nodes of B16-F10 tumor-bearing mice treated with vehicle, indisulam, anti-PD1, or the combination ( Figures 7 J and S7 K). This revealed increased frequencies of CD8 + T cells capable of recognizing splicing-derived peptides in mice receiving indisulam or the combination of indisulam and anti-PD1 ( Figure 7 K). Together, these data demonstrate that splicing modulation triggers the production of specific splicing-derived neoantigens at levels sufficient to drive expansion of CD8 + T cells recognizing those antigens.

Section: Discussion

Mutation-derived neoantigen burden is an established determinant of response to immune checkpoint blockade. Here, we describe a distinct and abundant source of immunogenic peptides derived from novel mRNA species. We demonstrated that multiple clinical-grade compounds, acting via distinct mechanisms, can thereby enhance immune checkpoint blockade by inducing such MHC I-presented neopeptides. These studies thus identify a means to acutely and reversibly induce tumor neoantigens without genomic changes and demonstrate the antigenic potential of splicing-derived neoepitopes in vivo .
Splicing modulation generates many novel mRNAs derived from large-scale events, including inclusion of intronic sequence into mature mRNA, juxtaposition of exons not normally spliced together, and exons with abnormal 5′ or 3′ ends. Each can result in the production of peptides containing wholly novel sequences—confirmed by our cytoplasmic RNA sequencing and MHC I mass spectrometry—potentially contributing to the many immunogenic peptides that we identified.
Although direct comparisons of the frequencies of neoantigens derived from aberrant splicing to those derived from single-nucleotide variants is challenging due to differences in experimental methodologies, the frequency of antigenic peptides derived from splicing may be high. For example, of candidate neoantigenic peptides derived from intersecting RNA-seq and MHC I proteomics, we found that 30 of 70 (∼43%) could elicit a CD8 + T cell immune response in naive C57BL/6 mice by IFN-γ ELISpot. Predicted neoantigenic peptides derived from RNA-seq alone exhibited a positivity rate of 11/39 (∼28%). Of these neoantigenic peptides, we then demonstrated that four were associated with the expansion of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells following splicing modulator treatment in vivo . In comparison, an early seminal study of MC38 cells reported that out of ∼1,300 coding variations, ∼13% resulted in peptides predicted to bind MHC I, 0.5% of which were identified by mass spectrometry and ∼0.25% of which were immunogenic in vivo ( Yadav et al., 2014 47. Yadav, M. ∙ Jhunjhunwala, S. ∙ Phung, Q.T. ... Predicting immunogenic tumour mutations by combining mass spectrometry and exome sequencing Nature. 2014; 515 :572-576 Crossref Scopus (919) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent consortium effort evaluating human melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer neoantigens predicted to bind MHC reported an immunogenicity rate of 6% ( Wells et al., 2020 45. Wells, D.K. ∙ van Buuren, M.M. ∙ Dang, K.K. ..., Tumor Neoantigen Selection Alliance Key Parameters of Tumor Epitope Immunogenicity Revealed Through a Consortium Approach Improve Neoantigen Prediction Cell. 2020; 183 :818-834.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, our results highlight the immunological relevance and clinical potential of splicing modulation.
Although we identified many splicing-derived, potentially immunogenic peptides produced upon exposure to splicing inhibitors, some of which triggered reactive T cell expansion in vivo , it is unclear which are most important for controlling tumor growth. However, because splicing modulation yields such diverse peptides, multiple peptides may contribute. Our work also highlights outstanding questions. For example, does splicing modulation affect CD4 + T cells and MHC II-presented neoantigens? Are there MHC-independent anti-tumor B cell and antibody responses elicited by neoantigenic proteins on the cell surface? Do cancer-associated mutations in RNA splicing factors ( Dvinge et al., 2016 7. Dvinge, H. ∙ Kim, E. ∙ Abdel-Wahab, O. ... RNA splicing factors as oncoproteins and tumour suppressors Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :413-430 Crossref Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ) alter the response to checkpoint immunotherapy? Finally, does pharmacologically altering RNA metabolic processes beyond splicing, such as intronic polyadenylation or NMD, affect tumor immunogenicity? Our finding that multiple modes of splicing modulation promote tumor immunogenicity will hopefully motivate further efforts to develop novel means of therapeutically modulating splicing and other RNA metabolic processes.

All in vivo experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and/or Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and conducted in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. All animals were housed in the respective specific pathogen-free (SPF) barrier facilities and maintained under standard husbandry conditions. B6(Cg)-Rag2tm1.1Cgn/J (RAG2 KO) mice, C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J (OT-1) mice and B6.129P2-B2mtm1Unc/DcrJ (B2M KO) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Cat. 008440, 003831, 002087 respectively). C57BL/6 mice, congenic B6.SJL- Ptprc a Pepc b /BoyJ (CD45.1) mice, BALB/c and LP/J mice were also obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Cat. 000664, 002014, 000651 and 000676). CD45.1, RAG2 KO, B2M KO, and OT-1 mice are all fully backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background. Unless otherwise noted in the text, females from 6-8 weeks old were used for all experiments. Animals within each genotype and treatment condition were randomly allocated to experimental groups; we did not exclude any allocated animals from our analyses. We minimized nuisance variables associated with the vivarium by checking on each cage of animals at least daily, and randomizing the location of cages when animals were placed back in their housing. Multiple authors (S.X.L., D.C., H.C., M.S., C.E.) were assigned to each experiment to minimize bias due to animal handling techniques. Blinding was not feasible for animal tumor challenge, drug treatment, or tumor measurements as the same authors performed all of the above. Animal group sample sizes (indicated in Figure Legends) were determined based on prior published literature on the same tumor models, with differences in tumor growth as the primary outcome measure. Individual study designs, outcome measures and corresponding statistical tests for animal experiments and ex vivo analyses of primary murine tissues are otherwise described in the text and figure legends.
B16-F10, CT26.WT (CT26), and LLC cells were obtained from ATCC (Cat. CRL-6475, CRL-2638, and CRL-1642 respectively). MB49 cells were obtained from MilliporeSigma (Cat. SCC148, Burlington, MA); MC38 cells were obtained from Kerafast (Cat. ENH204-FP, Boston, MA). B16-F10 and MC38 cells expressing chicken ovalbumin (B16ova and MC38ova) were a kind gift of Jeff Ravetch (Rockefeller University, New York, NY). To generate β 2 microglobulin-deficient cell lines for in vitro experiments, four candidate sgRNAs for mouse β 2 microglobulin (#1 AGTATACTCACGCCACCCACCGG, #2 TCACGCCACCCACCGGAGAATGG, #3 GGCGTATGTATCAGTCTCAGTGG, #4 TCGGCTTCCCATTCTCCGGTGGG) or non-targeting control (GGAGCGCACCATCTTCTTCA) were cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) as previously described ( Ran et al., 2013 33. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ) and used to engineer deficient MC38, B16-F10, and CT26 cell lines via transfection using XtremeGene 9 reagent as per manufacturer’s instructions (MilliporeSigma Cat. 6365809001) followed by puromycin selection at 10 μg/mL for three days. Polyclonal cell populations were obtained by flow sorting for H-2K b /D b and β 2 microglobulin double-negative cells, and gene knockout further confirmed by stimulating a culture of these sorted cells for 48 hours with 10U/mL mouse IFNγ and analyzing for the same markers. For in vivo experiments, lentiCas9-Blast was used to generate Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells. B2m gRNAs (GAGGGGTTTCTGAGGGCCAC, AGTATACTCACGCCACCCAC) and non-targeting control gRNAs (AAAAAGTCCGCGATTACGTC, ACCCATCCCCGCGTCCGAGA) were cloned into lentiGuide-Puro and introduced into Cas9-expressing B16-F10 cells via lentiviral transduction as previously described ( Thomas et al., 2020 41. Thomas, J.D. ∙ Polaski, J.T. ∙ Feng, Q. ... RNA isoform screens uncover the essentiality and tumor-suppressor activity of ultraconserved poison exons Nat. Genet. 2020; 52 :84-94 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ) and underwent similar selection. PX459, lentiCas9-blast, and lentiGuide-Puro were kind gifts of Feng Zhang (Addgene Cat. 62988, 52962, 52963).
Unless otherwise specified, cell lines were treated with splicing inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 96 hours in vitro , harvested and washed three times with PBS in excess to remove all drug, and then used for downstream analyses and/or subsequent studies, including phenotyping, RNA-seq analyses, continued growth in vitro , or tumor challenge in vivo into syngeneic animals.
Unless otherwise specified, syngeneic B6 or BALB/c mice were engrafted subcutaneously on bilateral flanks with MC38, B16-F10, CT26 or LLC tumor cells at the following doses: MC38 10 6 cells, B16-F10 0.5x10 6 cells, CT26 0.25x10 6 cells, LLC 0.25x10 6 cells. Tumors were measured serially twice or three times weekly and tumor volumes were estimated by length x width x height. Animals were monitored daily for survival and weighed twice weekly. Experimental endpoints mandating euthanasia were approved by the IACUC and included: animal lethargy, severe kyphosis or evidence of pain, difficulty with ambulation or feeding, tumor ulceration > 1 cm or bleeding tumor, evidence of infected tumor, tumor volumes exceeding 2.5 cm 3 , or animal total body weight loss > 10% from baseline.
Cell lines were grown with half-log 10 concentrations of the indicated drug in 4 to 8 technical replicates under standard conditions until the control condition (DMSO or vehicle) was confluent by microscopy. For tumor cell lines, viable cells were quantified via the CellTiter-Glo® assay (Promega Cat. G7573) as per manufacturer instructions. For the ex vivo proliferation of T cells, viable cells were instead quantified via flow cytometry using counting beads. The percentage or number of viable cells with drug treatment was calculated relative to DMSO control (as 100%). These data were log 10 transformed and a three-parameter nonlinear fit of log(inhibitor) versus response was performed in GraphPad Prism v9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to determine IC 50 values. For absolute cell number, Annexin V+, CD25+, and PD1+ flow cytometry data presented in Figure S4 , dose-response models and IC 50 values were computed using the R language’s drc package ( Ritz et al., 2015 34. Ritz, C. ∙ Baty, F. ∙ Streibig, J.C. ... Dose-Response Analysis Using R PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0146021 Crossref Scopus (2157) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Bulk splenocytes from OT-1 animals were cultured for three days with 100 U/mL murine IL-2 and 100 μg/mL SIINFEKL peptide to activate CD8 + T cells. Cultures were subsequently washed thoroughly to remove ova peptide and rested for at least 24 hours prior to use. OT-1 cells were passaged in T cell media with 50 U/mL IL-2 for no more than seven days from animal sacrifice prior to use. For the cytotoxicity assay, tumor cells alone or OT-1 + tumor cells (1:1 ratio) were incubated in T cell media for 18 hours under standard conditions with the indicated concentrations of splicing drugs and analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify killing. OT-1 cells and other hematopoietic cells were excluded with the use of CD45, CD3, and CD8 staining. Tumor cell viability was measured using DAPI.
OT-1 cells were generated as described for the cytotoxicity assay and incubated with ovalbumin-expressing tumor cell lines (pre-treated overnight with IFNγ 100U/mL to upregulate cell-surface MHC I) in the presence of DMSO or varying concentrations of splicing modulator drugs as indicated, in the presence of LAMP-1 antibody for 5-6 hours under standard incubator conditions. After the first hour of incubation, BD GolgiPlug (brefeldin A) and BD GolgiStop (monensin) was added at 1:1,1000 + 1:1,500 respectively into cells. At the end of incubation, cells were washed and stained for cell surface markers prior to standard flow cytometry.
Peptide:MHC I tetramers with neoantigenic peptides and murine H-2K b were generated using the QuickSwitch Quant Tetramer Kit-PE (Cat. TB-7400-K1, MBL International) per manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of peptide together with 50 μL of the tetramer reagent and 1 μL of peptide exchange factor were incubated at room temperature for 5-6 hours and used to stain cell populations of interest. Clone KT15 of an anti-CD8 antibody (Cat. D271-A64, MBL International) was used to identify CD8 + T cells of interest as this clone does not interfere with tetramer binding.
OT-1 cells were prepared and incubated with ovalbumin-expressing tumors as described above in the LAMP-1 assay. For some experiments OT-1 cells were instead left unstimulated (DMSO) or treated with PMA 1 μg/mL + ionomycin 1 μM as a supraphysiologic stimulus. In all cases, T cells underwent a 5-6 hour incubation period in the presence of DMSO or splicing modulators at the indicated concentrations, and with brefeldin A and monensin present for the entire duration. Cells were subsequently washed, stained for surface markers, and then fixed/permeabilized for intracellular staining of the indicated cytokines according to manufacturer instructions (BD Biosciences).
Western blotting was performed as per standard techniques. Anti-RBM39 (Atlas Antibodies, Cat. HPA001591 or Bethyl laboratories, Cat. A300-291A) were used to detect RBM39 degradation. ADMA and SDMA levels were determined using antibodies from Cell Signaling Technologies (Cat. 13222S and Cat. 13522S). Actin antibody (clone AC-15) was obtained from MilliporeSigma (Cat. A5441-.2ML). Densitometry of RBM39 and actin loading control was performed using ImageJ software in order to calculate RBM39 degradation IC 50 values.
Animals were subcutaneously engrafted on bilateral flanks with tumor cells (MC38 1x10 6 , B16-F10 0.5x10 6 and LLC 0.25x10 6 cells unless otherwise specified) on day 0, and treated continuously with splicing inhibitors (MS-023 50 mg/kg i.p., indisulam 25 mg/kg i.v. or vehicle) daily for 5 of 7 weekly days starting from day +3 of tumor challenge. Indisulam was obtained from MilliporeSigma (Cat. SML1225-25MG) and MS-023 in sufficient quantities for in vivo studies was synthesized by the authors as previously described ( Eram et al., 2016 8. Eram, M.S. ∙ Shen, Y. ∙ Szewczyk, M. ... A Potent, Selective, and Cell-Active Inhibitor of Human Type I Protein Arginine Methyltransferases ACS Chem. Biol. 2016; 11 :772-781 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). For in vivo formulation, indisulam was dissolved in sterile DMSO at 50 mg/mL and this was combined in a 1:20 ratio with 15% 2-Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma. Cat. H107-100G) in sterile water (w/v) and filtered through a 0.45 μM filter to yield a final solution of 2.5 mg/mL. For in vivo formulation, 62.5 mg of MS-023 was dissolved in 563 μl of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, Sigma. 328634-1L), diluted with 2.257 mL of 20% Captisol in sterile water (w/v, SelleckChem Cat. S4592) and further combined with 2.257 mg of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400, Sigma Cat. PX1286B-2), and 6.21 mL of PBS, mixed by vortexing and sterile filtered to yield a solution of 5.5 mg/mL. Mice were weighed weekly for weight-based drug dosing. Animals were treated with 250 μg of anti-PD1 flat dose (clone RMP1-14, BioXCell Cat. BE0146) or PBS i.p. starting on day +7 and twice weekly thereafter for a total of five doses.
For depleting T cells, mice were treated with simultaneous anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioXCell Cat. BE0003-1) together with anti-CD8 (clone 2.43, BioXCell Cat. BE0061) versus PBS control, at days −7, −4, +4, and +7 relative to tumor challenge on day 0. Each depleting antibody was administered i.p. at 0.5 mg per dose. 0.5x10 6 B16-F10 which were treated in vitro with indisulam at 1 μM or DMSO for 96 hours were engrafted subcutaneously on the flanks of animals receiving T cell depletion or PBS control. For NK cell depletion, an identical experimental schedule and dose using clone PK136 (BioXCell Cat. BE0036) was utilized. To verify T cell depletion, CD4 clone H129.19 (Biolegend Cat. 130310), CD8 clone 53-5.8 (Biolegend Cat. 140410) were used. NKp46 (Biolegend Cat. 137608) was used to verify NK cell depletion.
Splenic T cells were obtained from naive B6 or CD45.1 donors by CD5 positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. 130-049-301), labeled with CellTrace CFSE (ThermoFisher Cat. C34570) at 10 μM, and adoptively transferred by tail vein injection into lethally irradiated B6, BALB/c, or LP/J recipients, with 10 7 labeled donor T cells transferred per recipient. All recipients were irradiated on day −1 prior to adoptive T cell transfer with 7 Gy as a single fraction and continuously received splicing inhibitor drugs or vehicle control at the indicated doses, from day −1 until day of sacrifice, with the initial dose of drug at least 4 hours after lethal irradiation. Recipients were treated with each splicing modulatory compound at doses used in prior studies that result in target engagement in vivo ( Fong et al., 2019 11. Fong, J.Y. ∙ Pignata, L. ∙ Goy, P.A. ...

Indisulam and MS-023 were solubilized for in vivo administration and animals were treated daily as above. Pladienolide B (Tocris, Cat. 6070) and GEX1A (Cayman Chemicals, Cat. 25136) were both dissolved in vehicle (10% ethanol and 4% Tween-80 in sterile PBS) and administered i.p., with pladienolide B dosed at 10 mg/kg every other day, and GEX1A dosed at 1.25 mg/kg every four days. For in vivo use, EPZ015666 was dissolved in DMSO and solubilized in 0.5% methylcellulose in water to 20 mg/mL; animals were treated daily with 200mg/kg by oral gavage.
Plates were coated with 10 μg/mL anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11, Biolegend Cat. 100302) and 2 μg/mL anti-CD28 (clone 37.51, Biolegend Cat. 102102) in PBS overnight at 4°C and washed twice with cold PBS prior to use. CFSE-labeled CD5-selected splenic T cells from naive C57BL/6J mice were obtained identically as for adoptive cell transfer, and 5x10 4 cells incubated with coated plates in the presence of splicing inhibitor drugs at the indicated concentrations, followed by analysis by standard flow cytometry on day 3. Of note, for RNA-seq analyses, T cells were not labeled with CFSE, and underwent activation for 4 days (96 hours) in the presence of various splicing modulator drugs to harmonize experimental conditions with RNA-seq analyses of tumors treated with splicing inhibitors. For the RNA-seq experiments only, T cells in all conditions were also incubated with IL-2 at 50U/mL to maximize viability and yield.
RBC lysed bone marrow obtained from the femurs and tibias of C57BL/6 or β 2 microglobulin deficient mice (Jackson Laboratories Cat. 2087) were cultured with mouse IL-3 (PeproTech Cat. 213-13) and mouse FLT3 ligand (PeproTech Cat. 250-31L) both at 10 ng/mL each in RPMI + 10% FCS for 7 days to generate bone marrow derived dendritic cells. Separately, 10 7 MC38 treated with splicing inhibitors versus DMSO or expressing chicken ovalbumin were harvested, washed and resuspended in sterile PBS, and subjected to five cycles of rapid freeze-thaw (alternating between 37°C and dry ice/acetone) to generate a cell lysate. After brief centrifugation at 100xg, the soluble fraction in PBS was added to bone marrow derived DCs and left to incubate overnight for antigen phagocytosis in the presence of LPS (ThermoFisher Cat. 00-4976-93). DCs were subsequently washed three times to remove cell-free lysates and LPS and incubated in a 1:1 ratio with CFSE-labeled B6 splenic T cells (10 5 stimulators with 10 5 responders) as described above. The MLR was analyzed at day 5 by flow cytometry.
25,000 red blood cell-lysed bone marrow mononuclear cells from C57BL/6 mice were plated in duplicates or triplicates in each well of a non tissue-culture treated 6 well plate with M3434 methylcellulose media in the presence of splicing drugs at the indicated concentrations as per manufacturer’s instructions (StemCell Technologies, Cat. 03434) and incubated for seven days prior to quantification of colonies by manual microscopy.
Cells were fixed with 2.1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes at 37°C, washed and permeabilized with ice-cold 90% methanol for 30 minutes, and washed prior to staining. If required, cell surface staining was performed after fixation but prior to permeabilization. For some experiments, intracellular staining was performed using the eBioscience Foxp3 transcription factor staining buffer set (ThermoFisher Cat. 00-5523-00) or reagents for intracellular cytokine staining (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm, Cat. 554714, and BD Perm/Wash, Cat. 554723) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Animal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, decalcified (for bone), dehydrated and paraffin embedded. Blocks were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or anti-CD8. Images were acquired using an Axio Observer A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or scanned using an Aperio AT slide scanner (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Automated quantification of infiltrating CD8 + T cells was performed using HALO software (Indica labs, Albuquerque, NM). Pathologic evaluation of immune-related tissue toxicities was performed in a blinded fashion by one of the authors who is a trained pathologist (Ben Durham, MD).
Nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular fractions were isolated from B16-F10 cells using reagents from Active Motif (Cat. 25501) as per manufacturers’ instructions, with the exception of RNA isolation and purification from each fraction using the QIAgen RNeasy Mini kit.
Bulk lung and colon were homogenized using a QIAGEN TissueRuptor. For all tissues and cell types, RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN, Frederick, MD) and quantified using a NanoDrop 8000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). A minimum of 500 ng of high-quality RNA (as determined by Agilent Bioanalyzer) per sample or replicate was used for library preparation. Poly(A)-selected, strand-specific (dUTP method) Illumina libraries were prepared with a modified TruSeq protocol and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 (∼100M 2x101 bp paired-end reads per sample or replicate).
RNA-seq analysis was performed as previously described ( Dvinge et al., 2014 6. Dvinge, H. ∙ Ries, R.E. ∙ Ilagan, J.O. ... Sample processing obscures cancer-specific alterations in leukemic transcriptomes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :16802-16807 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, FASTQ files were mapped using RSEM version 1.2.4 ( Li and Dewey, 2011 25. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13966) PubMed Google Scholar ) (modified to call Bowtie) ( Langmead et al., 2009 21. Langmead, B. ∙ Trapnell, C. ∙ Pop, M. ... Ultrafast and memory-efficient alignment of short DNA sequences to the human genome Genome Biol. 2009; 10 :R25 Crossref Scopus (16504) PubMed Google Scholar ) with option ‘-v 2′) to mouse or human transcriptome annotations built using transcript information from Ensembl v71.1 ( Flicek et al., 2013 10. Flicek, P. ∙ Ahmed, I. ∙ Amode, M.R. ... Ensembl 2013 Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D48-D55 Crossref Scopus (819) PubMed Google Scholar ), UCSC knownGene ( Meyer et al., 2013 28. Meyer, L.R. ∙ Zweig, A.S. ∙ Hinrichs, A.S. ... The UCSC Genome Browser database: extensions and updates 2013 Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D64-D69 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ), and MISO v2.0 ( Katz et al., 2010 20. Katz, Y. ∙ Wang, E.T. ∙ Airoldi, E.M. ... Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :1009-1015 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads that did not align at this step were then mapped using TopHat version 2.0.8b ( Trapnell et al., 2009 42. Trapnell, C. ∙ Pachter, L. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. TopHat: discovering splice junctions with RNA-Seq Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1105-1111 Crossref Scopus (9516) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the mouse (GRCm38/mm10) or human (GRCh37/hg19) genome assemblies, as well as to a database of annotated splice junctions as well as all possible new junctions consisting of linkage between each co-linear annotated 5′ and 3′ splice sites within individual genes. Aligned reads from these two mapping steps were merged to generate final BAM files for all subsequent analyses.
Gene expression estimates were computed using RSEM (performed concordantly with the RNA-seq read mapping procedure described above). Significantly differentially expressed genes were defined as those meeting the follow criteria: minimum expression of 1 transcript per million (TPM); minimum fold-change of 1.5 (log 2 scale); p ≤ 0.05 (computed using an unpaired, two-sided t test comparing replicate groups for a given treatment and cell line) or a minimum Bayes factor of 100 (computed using Wagenmakers’s Bayesian framework ( Wagenmakers et al., 2010 43. Wagenmakers, E.J. ∙ Lodewyckx, T. ∙ Kuriyal, H. ... Bayesian hypothesis testing for psychologists: a tutorial on the Savage-Dickey method Cognit. Psychol. 2010; 60 :158-189 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the median of gene expression and associated read counts over replicates for a given treatment and cell line). Splice junction-spanning reads were filtered to require a minimum overhang of 6 nt.
MISO v2.0 was used to quantify all expression of isoforms arising from exon skipping (cassette exons), competing 5′ splice site selection, competing 3′ splice site selection, and annotated intron retention. Quantification of constitutive intron retention, where constitutive introns were defined as those whose 5′ and 3′ splice sites were never joined to other splice sites in the knownGene annotation, was calculated as previously described ( Hubert et al., 2013 14. Hubert, C.G. ∙ Bradley, R.K. ∙ Ding, Y. ... Genome-wide RNAi screens in human brain tumor isolates reveal a novel viability requirement for PHF5A Genes Dev. 2013; 27 :1032-1045 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ) using reads with a minimum of 6 nt overhang in both the exon and intron. Events were considered significantly differentially spliced if they met the following criteria: a minimum of 20 identifying reads (reads which align only to one, but not both, isoforms constituting a given splicing event) in each sample; a minimum of 10% change (absolute scale) in isoform ratio or minimum fold-change of 2 (log 2 scale) in absolute isoform ratio; p ≤ 0.05 (computed using an unpaired, two-sided t test comparing replicate groups for a given treatment and cell line) or a minimum Bayes factor of 5 (computed using Wagenmakers’s Bayesian framework) ( Wagenmakers et al., 2010 43. Wagenmakers, E.J. ∙ Lodewyckx, T. ∙ Kuriyal, H. ... Bayesian hypothesis testing for psychologists: a tutorial on the Savage-Dickey method Cognit. Psychol. 2010; 60 :158-189 Crossref Scopus (465) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the median of isoform ratios and distinguishing read counts over replicates for a given treatment and cell line). All data parsing, statistical analyses, and data visualization were performed using the R programming environment with Bioconductor ( Huber et al., 2015 13. Huber, W. ∙ Carey, V.J. ∙ Gentleman, R. ... Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :115-121 Crossref Scopus (2261) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Peptide-MHC complexes were isolated as previously described ( Abelin et al., 2017 1. Abelin, J.G. ∙ Keskin, D.B. ∙ Sarkizova, S. ... Mass Spectrometry Profiling of HLA-Associated Peptidomes in Mono-allelic Cells Enables More Accurate Epitope Prediction Immunity. 2017; 46 :315-326 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the following modifications: anti-mouse H-2D b (clone B22-249.R1, CedarLane laboratories, Cat. CL9001AP) or H-2K b (clone Y-3, BioXCell Cat. BE0172) non-covalently linked to GammaBind Plus Sepharose beads were co-incubated with soluble lysates overnight. After washing with lysis buffer twice, 10mM Tris pH 8 twice, and dH 2 O twice, the peptides were desalted on C18 StaGE tips ( Ishihama et al., 2006 16. Ishihama, Y. ∙ Rappsilber, J. ∙ Mann, M. Modular stop and go extraction tips with stacked disks for parallel and multidimensional Peptide fractionation in proteomics J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5 :988-994 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ) (Pierce, Cat. 87784) and eluted using a 20%–35%-50% acetonitrile stepwise gradient. Eluted fractions were dried using a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator and stored until mass spectrometry. For B16-F10, cells in all experimental conditions were treated with 10U/mL mouse IFNγ (PeproTech Cat. 315-05) for 48 hours prior to cell harvest and immunoprecipitation to upregulate surface MHC I expression.
Desalted, dried samples enriched for MHC peptides were resolubilized in 8uL 0.1% TFA and 3uL were loaded onto a packed-in-emitter 12cm/75um ID/3um C18 particles column (Nikkyo Technos Co., Ltd. Japan). Peptides were eluted using a gradient delivered at 300nL/min increasing from 2% Buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) / 99% Buffer A (0.1% formic acid) to 30% Buffer B / 70% Buffer A, over 70 minutes (EasyLC 1200, Thermo Scientific). All solvents were LCMS grade (Optima, Fisher Scientific). MS and MS/MS (HCD type fragmentation) experiments were performed in data dependent mode with lock mass (m/z 445.12003) using Fusion Lumos (Thermo Scientific). Precursor mass spectra were recorded from m/z 300-1500 m/z range at 60,000 resolution. 1, 2 and 3 positive charges were selected for fragmentation experiments. MS/MS spectra were recorded at 30,000 resolution and lowest mass set at m/z 110. For MS/MS acquisition, injection time was set to maximum 100 ms with an Auto Gain Control setting of 5e4. Normalized collision energy was set to 30. All experiments were recorded in FT-mode.
Gene and isoform annotations were created as described in RNA-seq data analysis. This merged transcript annotation, as well as the RefSeq annotations of the human and mouse genomes, was used to create the four distinct proteomes described in the main text as follows.
Isoforms were computationally translated into proteins and digested into unique 8-14-mers. Isoforms were translated into proteins “conservatively,” in the sense that the translation was performed assuming that the annotated start codons were used and no stop codon readthrough or internal translation initiation occurred (e.g., generally only the first portion of a retained intron would be translated until an in-frame premature termination codon was encountered, after which translation was assumed to halt). The binding affinity for each resulting peptide to the relevant MHC alleles was then predicted using NetMHCpan v4.0 ( Jurtz et al., 2017 18. Jurtz, V. ∙ Paul, S. ∙ Andreatta, M. ... NetMHCpan-4.0: Improved Peptide-MHC Class I Interaction Predictions Integrating Eluted Ligand and Peptide Binding Affinity Data J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :3360-3368 Crossref Scopus (905) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each peptide was annotated with relevant information about its encoding transcript, including parent gene, parent isoform(s), differential gene and/or isoform expression (if relevant), position within parent transcript, unique assignment to one versus two or more isoforms of the originating splicing event (if relevant), etc.
Four distinct, custom proteomes for subsequent spectra mapping were created (illustrated in Figure 5 B). (1) “full-length proteome,” created using peptides arising from all unique full-length isoforms. (2) “predicted binders,” created by further restricting to unique 8-14-mers that had a NetMHCpan 4.0 percentile rank < 2 (the recommended cutoff for binders from NetMHCpan 4.0). Two versions of this proteome were created, one including only those isoforms derived from differentially retained constitutive introns based on the RNA-seq data, and one including all isoforms derived from constitutive intron retention (constituting an increase in unique 8-14-mers of ∼28%). Analyses used the complete (latter) proteome unless otherwise indicated. (3) “predicted binders + spiked non-binders,” created by augmenting the “predicted binders” proteome with peptides that were predicted to not bind the relevant MHC alleles with high-confidence, defined as having NetMHCpan percentile rank > 90, with the number of such non-binders chosen such that they comprised 10% of the final proteome after adding to the “predicted binders” proteome. (4) “filtered predicted binders,” created by further filtering the “predicted binders” proteome by restricting to peptides arising from genes that were significantly differentially expressed or isoforms that were significantly differentially spliced in indisulam-treated versus DMSO-treated samples, defined based on the RNA-seq analysis for the corresponding cell lines.
Mass spectra from all MHC immunoprecipitations were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v2.4.1.15, with the following workflow. Spectra from each replicate were searched against each distinct proteome (described above) as follows. For each proteome, searches were performed with no enzyme specificity, precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm, and fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Oxidation (+15.995 Da), phosphorylation (+79.966 Da), and deamidated (+0.984 Da) dynamic modifications were included, in addition to N-terminal glutamate to pyro-glutamate (−17.027 Da). False discovery rate (FDR) estimation was performed computationally using the Percolator software. Peptides reaching the 5% FDR threshold were retained for downstream analyses. For the “full-length” proteome, identified peptides were further restricted to those of length 8-14 amino acids before being used as input for subsequent analyses. For the “predicted binders,” “predicted binders + spiked non-binders,” and “filtered predicted binders” proteomes, peptides corresponding to subsequences of the sequences in the input proteomes were removed before the identified peptides were used for subsequent analyses.
As described in the main text, two distinct groups of candidate neoepitopes were selected for subsequent immunization experiments. The first group was based on the intersection between mass spectrometry analyses and RNA-seq analyses. Peptides were first identified using the mass spectrometry analysis described above. These peptides were then restricted to the set of indisulam-specific peptides, where an indisulam-specific peptide was defined as a peptide that was identified in one or more indisulam-treated samples, but not recovered in any DMSO-treated samples. These indisulam-specific peptides were then filtered to retain only those peptides arising from alternative isoforms that were significantly differentially spliced in indisulam-treated versus DMSO-treated cells, and subsequently additionally filtered to require (1) isoform specificity and (2) appropriate direction of differential splicing, with those two criteria defined as follows. (1) An isoform-specific peptide was defined as a peptide which arose exclusively from one isoform associated with a given splicing event (e.g., a peptide from a retained intron event is isoform-specific if it arises from translation of the intronic portion of the unspliced mRNA, or if it arises from translation of the exon-exon junction within the spliced mRNA). This definition means that differential splicing of a given event is predicted to alter levels of the isoform encoding an isoform-specific peptide, and therefore likely similarly alter abundance of the isoform-specific peptide itself. (2) Peptides that exhibit appropriate direction of differential splicing are those isoform-specific peptides which are specifically encoded by differentially spliced isoforms that are promoted by indisulam treatment (e.g., the encoding isoform is present at higher levels in indisulam-treated versus DMSO-treated cells). Isoform-specific peptides were only used for subsequent immunization experiments if their parent isoform was more prevalent in the indisulam treatment, signifying that the peptide is expected to be more abundant in indisulam-treated cells. These criteria yielded 72 peptides, which were subsequently tested in immunization experiments.
The second group of peptides used for immunization experiments was derived by combining evidence from RNA-seq analyses and MHC I binding predictions. This set of peptides was defined using the same criteria described above for the first set (derived by intersecting predictions from mass spectrometry analyses as well as RNA-seq analyses), but without the requirement that peptides be detected as indisulam-specific epitopes via MHC I mass spectrometry. To compensate for the fact that direct protein-level detection was not required, a stringent predicted MHC I binding threshold of rank < 0.5 (the NetMHCpan recommended threshold for strong binders) for one or more relevant alleles was applied (versus the more lenient threshold of rank < 2 used for other, mass spectrometry-based predictions and analyses). Peptides were additionally restricted to those of lengths between 8 and 11 amino acids, as such lengths are preferred by the studied alleles. The final set of peptides used for subsequent immunization experiments was then derived by additionally requiring that peptides be isoform-specific; arise from genes with expression > 5 TPM in corresponding indisulam-treated samples (in order to favor peptides from relatively highly expressed genes); and have a difference in isoform ratio > 20% in indisulam-treated versus DMSO-treated samples, and isoform ratio < 25% in DMSO-treated samples (in order to restrict to peptides that were associated with more dramatic splicing changes). These criteria yielded 39 peptides, which were subsequently tested in immunization experiments.
Experimental peptides were individually custom synthesized via the solid-phase method by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ), with standard removal of trifluoracetic acid and replacement with hydrochloride, purified to > 98% by HPLC, and lyophilized for storage. Peptides were reconstituted in DMSO at 10 mg/mL and frozen at −80C until use.
RMA-S cells were maintained under standard conditions in RPMI + 7.5% FCS for expansion. H-2 stabilization experiments were performed as previously described ( Ross et al., 2012 35. Ross, P. ∙ Holmes, J.C. ∙ Gojanovich, G.S. ... A cell-based MHC stabilization assay for the detection of peptide binding to the canine classical class I molecule, DLA-88 Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2012; 150 :206-212 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, RMA-S were exposed to 31°C and 5% CO 2 conditions overnight, incubated with peptides of interest for 30 minutes at 31°C, and then returned to 37°C and 5% CO2 for three hours prior to cell surface staining for H-2K b (clone AF6-88.5) and H-2D b molecules (clone KH95) and standard flow cytometry analysis. For Figures 5 N–5Q, spike-in negative control peptides were as follows for each experimental peptide – Hus1: PPSGRALLW; Zpf512: QKPKGSQRG; D14Abb1e: LKPQAKRSK; Poldip3: GESWQEKER
Unless otherwise specified, 10 μg of peptide was emulsified with TiterMax Classic (TiterMax Corp., Norcross, GA) and injected into the hocks of anesthetized animals. On day +7 after challenge, draining lymph nodes were collected and CD8 + T cells purified by magnetic selection (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat. 130-117-044).
CD8 + T cells from TiterMax immunized animals were cultured overnight with 20 U/mL mouse IL-2 (PeproTech, Cat. 212-12) and plated at 10 5 per well in combination with 3x10 5 T cell depleted syngeneic splenocytes which had been loaded with 100 μg/mL of peptides of interest for 18 hours. PMA 1 μg/mL + ionomycin 500 ng/mL stimulation of T cells served as positive control.
In some experiments, in lieu of peptide-loaded splenocytes, instead ovalbumin-expressing B16-F10 cells or B16-F10 cells treated with DMSO or indisulam 1 μM for 96 hours were stimulated overnight with IFNγ 100U/mL for the last 24 hours of cell culture. Such cells were then non-enzymatically harvested, washed repeatedly to remove IFNγ, and irradiated to 60 Gy from a 60 Co source to inhibit growth and further upregulate MHC I. Tumor cells thus generated were counted and incubated with CD8 + T cells at identical ratios as for splenocytes (10 5 CD8 + T cells + 3x10 5 melanoma cells). IFNγ ELISpot was performed as per manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences, Cat. 551083). Spots were imaged and quantified on an Immunospot® analyzer (Cellular Technology Limited, Cleveland, OH).
B16-F10 cells were harvested, counted, and plated at 10 4 per well in the presence of 100U/mL IFNγ overnight to upregulate MHC I. After washing, peptides were loaded onto tumor cells at 100 μg/mL, and 10 6 CD8 + T cells from TiterMax immunized animals were added to the tumor cells. 50 U/mL mouse IL-2 was added to this co-culture of tumor cells + CD8 + T cells, which was incubated for three days. After washing to remove free (detached) B16-F10 and T cells, viable B16-F10 were harvested, stained (to exclude T and other hematopoietic cells) and absolute cell numbers enumerated via flow cytometry using counting beads according to the manufacturers’ instructions (ThermoFisher Cat. C36950).
All data summarization, visualization, and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism v9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) or in the R programming language. Details for statistical procedures, including statistical test used, number of replicates, definition of center, and definition of error bars are found within the figure legends. Unless otherwise noted in the text, n represents biological replicates of the sample type (e.g., individual tumors, independent cell cultures, etc.) indicated in the figure legend. The normality of data was assessed using a Shapiro-Wilk test. If data were normally distributed, a parametric test (e.g., unpaired, two-sided t test) was used to test for significant differences between groups; otherwise, a non-parametric test (e.g., Wilcoxon rank-sum test) was used, as indicated in the figure legends. Differences between groups were considered significant if p was less than 0.05. No methods were used for sample randomization or sample size estimation and no data were excluded from analysis.

Download all Spreadsheet (6.11 MB) Table S1. Differentially spliced events in DMSO- versus indisulam-treated mouse cell lines, related to Figure 4 Each row corresponds to isoform 1 of a splicing event, where isoform 1 is defined for each splicing event type as follows: “se,” inclusion isoform of cassette exons; “a3ss” and “a5ss,” intron-proximal isoform for competing 3′ or 5′ splice site events; “ri,” spliced isoform for annotated intron retention events; “ci,” spliced isoform for constitutive intron retention events. The table columns are defined as: “event,” event ID (encoding description of event type and coordinates of identifying splice junctions); “coordinates,” genomic coordinates of splicing event; “gene,” Ensembl gene ID; “geneName,” name of gene; “type,” type of splicing event; “dpsi_X-vs-dmso,” difference in isoform ratio between the indicated indisulam-treated cell line and DMSO-treated control, computed as (indisulam - DMSO); “pval_X-vs-dmso,” p (computed using unpaired, two-sided t-test) associated with difference in isoform ratio between indisulam-treated cells and DMSO-treated control cells for the indicated cell line. Table is restricted to events that were differentially spliced in at least one comparison of indisulam- or MS-023-treated mouse cell lines, where differential splicing is defined as |difference in isoform ratio| ≥ 0.10 and p ≤ 0.05.
