Title: Lymph node colonization induces tumor-immune tolerance to promote distant metastasis


Abstract: Summary

For many solid malignancies, lymph node (LN) involvement represents a harbinger of distant metastatic disease and, therefore, an important prognostic factor. Beyond its utility as a biomarker, whether and how LN metastasis plays an active role in shaping distant metastasis remains an open question. Here, we develop a syngeneic melanoma mouse model of LN metastasis to investigate how tumors spread to LNs and whether LN colonization influences metastasis to distant tissues. We show that an epigenetically instilled tumor-intrinsic interferon response program confers enhanced LN metastatic potential by enabling the evasion of NK cells and promoting LN colonization. LN metastases resist T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells, and generate tumor-specific immune tolerance that subsequently facilitates distant tumor colonization. These effects extend to human cancers and other murine cancer models, implicating a conserved systemic mechanism by which malignancies spread to distant organs.

Section: Introduction

For most cancers, distant organ metastases confer a diagnosis of stage IV disease and are the primary cause of cancer-associated deaths ( Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011 17. Chaffer, C.L. ∙ Weinberg, R.A. A perspective on cancer cell metastasis Science. 2011; 331 :1559-1564 Crossref Scopus (3104) PubMed Google Scholar ). These metastases, however, are typically preceded by lymph node (LN) involvement ( Edge et al., 2010 29. Edge, S.B. American Joint Committee on Cancer, and American Cancer Society AJCC cancer staging handbook : from the AJCC cancer staging manual. Springer, 2010 Google Scholar ; Pereira et al., 2015 82.

Biol. 2015; 38 :98-105 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), which serves as the most informative prognostic factor for most solid tumors ( Leong et al., 2011 55. Leong, S.P.L. ∙ Zuber, M. ∙ Ferris, R.L. ... Impact of nodal status and tumor burden in sentinel lymph nodes on the clinical outcomes of cancer patients J. Surg. Oncol. 2011; 103 :518-530 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). LNs are downstream drainage sites of tissues and tumors, and as such, their colonization is presumed to be largely unhindered and an intermediary step in dissemination to distant sites. Indeed, LN metastases can harbor the precursors of distant metastases ( Brown et al., 2018 15. Brown, M. ∙ Assen, F.P. ∙ Leithner, A. ... Lymph node blood vessels provide exit routes for metastatic tumor cell dissemination in mice Science. 2018; 359 :1408-1411 Crossref Scopus (194) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pereira et al., 2018 83.

Lymph node metastases can invade local blood vessels, exit the node, and colonize distant organs in mice Science. 2018; 359 :1403-1407 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet reconstruction of tumor phylogenies suggests that such metastases may be of independent clonal origin ( Enquist et al., 2014 30.

Origins of lymphatic and distant metastases in human colorectal cancer Science. 2017; 357 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the significance of LN metastases in the generation of distant metastases remains a matter of contention ( Pereira et al., 2015 82. Pereira, E.R. ∙ Jones, D. ∙ Jung, K. ... The lymph node microenvironment and its role in the progression of metastatic cancer Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 38 :98-105 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ).
LNs serve as education centers of the immune system where antigen-presenting cells (APCs) prime T cells prior to their egress and elimination of cells harboring those antigens ( von Andrian and Mempel, 2003 110. von Andrian, U.H. ∙ Mempel, T.R. Homing and cellular traffic in lymph nodes Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3 :867-878 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In cancer, presentation of tumor antigens in LNs by classical dendritic cell (cDC) subsets trafficking from primary tumors can elicit potent anti-tumor immunity ( Binnewies et al., 2019 9.

Yet, these studies do not consider the possible role of LN involvement itself in tumor dissemination, despite its correlation with poor prognosis and further disease progression ( Edge et al., 2010 29. Edge, S.B. American Joint Committee on Cancer, and American Cancer Society AJCC cancer staging handbook : from the AJCC cancer staging manual.

Thus, while immune cells can influence LN metastasis ( Gu et al., 2019 37. Gu, Y. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Fu, L. ...

SCS macrophages suppress melanoma by restricting tumor-derived vesicle-B cell interactions Science. 2016; 352 :242-246 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ), the mechanisms by which tumors escape anti-tumor immunity during LN metastasis and the effects of such metastases on further disease progression are largely unknown.
Here, we developed a model of LN metastasis that enabled us to interrogate the mechanisms by which tumors spread to LNs and the effects that such metastases have on colonizing distant tissues. We find that the LN metastatic tumors are epigenetically rewired, enabling LN colonization, suppression of anti-tumor immunity, and ultimately the generation of metastasis-promoting tumor-specific immune tolerance.

Section: Results

To develop a model of LN metastasis, we utilized an in vivo selection approach analogous to that used in other organ-specific metastasis models ( Clark et al., 2000 20. Clark, E.A. ∙ Golub, T.R. ∙ Lander, E.S. ... Genomic analysis of metastasis reveals an essential role for RhoC Nature. 2000; 406 :532-535 Crossref Scopus (1295) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kang et al., 2003 51. Kang, Y. ∙ Siegel, P.M. ∙ Shu, W. ... A multigenic program mediating breast cancer metastasis to bone Cancer Cell. 2003; 3 :537-549 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1989) PubMed Google Scholar ). We implanted mice with the minimally metastatic syngeneic melanoma cell line B16-F0 ( Fidler, 1973 33. Fidler, I.J. Selection of successive tumour lines for metastasis Nat. New Biol. 1973; 242 :148-149 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), generated de novo lines from any resultant LN metastases, and implanted them into naive recipients ( Figure 1 A). We repeated this process over nine generations yielding nearly 300 unique cell lines with increasing numbers derived from non-draining LNs in later generations ( Figures 1 B and S1 A). Later generation LN lines metastasized to LNs at a higher frequency than the parental line ( Figure 1 C) despite exhibiting reduced growth kinetics ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Co-injection of fluorescently labeled parental and sixth generation LN (LN6) cells subcutaneously ( Figure 1 D) yielded LN metastases nearly entirely composed of LN6 cells, regardless of the fluorescent protein ( Figures 1 E and 1F). In contrast to LNs, lungs frequently comprised tumors derived from both lines ( Figures 1 G–1I), demonstrating the LN specificity of the LN lines. Multiple mice exhibited more parental lung metastases despite having few, if any, parental cells within their LNs ( Figure 1 I), and there was no correlation between the compositions of the LN and lung metastases ( Figure S1 D).
As mice often exhibited lung metastases predominantly of parental origin despite LN metastases comprising LN6 cells ( Figure 1 I), we hypothesized that LN metastases may affect distant metastasis through mechanisms other than serving as a reservoir of metastatic cells. We inoculated mice with either the parental or the LN lines, allowed the tumors to condition the host, and then queried lung-metastatic seeding in these mice by injecting tdTomato-expressing parental cells (B16-F0-tdTomato) into their tail veins ( Figure 1 J). Regardless of whether the tumors were implanted subcutaneously or directly into LNs, mice bearing LN tumors exhibited a greater lung-metastatic burden than those bearing the parental tumors ( Figure 1 J), indicating that the LN lines enhance the capacity of tumors to colonize distant organs.
We subjected tumor lines from different generations, LN sites, and phylogenetic lineages to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) ( Figure S2 A). Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering of pairwise Spearman correlations revealed that the lines cluster closest to other lines of similar generations ( Figures 2 A, S2 B, and S2C). We classified tumor lines as “early,” “mid,” “mid-late,” and “late” ( Table S1 ).
Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis between the late and early-generation lines (or LN8 and parental lines) identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes ( Figures 2 B and S2 D). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed clear segregation between the late-generation and parental lines ( Figure 2 C) with mid-generation lines exhibiting an intermediate level of expression ( Figures 2 C and S2 G). In agreement with recent reports ( Makohon-Moore et al., 2017 62. Makohon-Moore, A.P. ∙ Zhang, M. ∙ Reiter, J.G. ... Limited heterogeneity of known driver gene mutations among the metastases of individual patients with pancreatic cancer Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :358-366 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reiter et al., 2018 88. Reiter, J.G. ∙ Makohon-Moore, A.P. ∙ Gerold, J.M. ... Minimal functional driver gene heterogeneity among untreated metastases Science. 2018; 361 :1033-1037 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ), whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed no increase in mutations of known melanoma driver genes ( Hodis et al., 2012 45. Hodis, E. ∙ Watson, I.R. ∙ Kryukov, G.V. ... A landscape of driver mutations in melanoma Cell. 2012; 150 :251-263 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1753) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 E). Nearly all of the gene ontology (GO) biological processes associated with the differentially expressed genes were related to the immune response ( Figure 2 D), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified type I and II interferon (IFN) responses as the most highly enriched ( Figures 2 E and S2 F), while the most negatively enriched sets were related to cell cycle ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Furthermore, 33.8% of the differentially expressed genes are present in the Interferome v2 database ( Rusinova et al., 2013 90. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 B and S2 D). We next performed RNA-seq on sorted malignant cells from tumors of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. DGE analysis between patients with and without LN metastases revealed that 89% of the upregulated genes conserved between mice and humans are IFN related ( Figure 2 F).
Chronic IFN exposure can induce constitutive expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through epigenetic reprogramming ( Benci et al., 2016 8. Benci, J.L. ∙ Xu, B. ∙ Qiu, Y. ... Tumor interferon signaling regulates a multigenic resistance program to immune checkpoint blockade Cell. 2016; 167 :1540-1554 e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we performed assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) on the parental, third, and seventh generation lines. PCA of the ATAC-seq profiles revealed that the samples predominantly clustered by generation, indicating that the parental and LN metastatic lines are epigenetically distinct ( Figure S2 H). Differential peak analysis revealed wholescale remodeling of the epigenome, indicating a bias toward opening of chromatin during LN metastasis ( Figures 2 G, 2H, and S2 I), and many of the conserved open peaks were adjacent to ISG loci ( Figures 2 G–2I). Increases in accessibility occurred at both the ISG transcription start sites and proximal and distal cis -regulatory elements ( Figure 2 I).
TF motif activity analysis revealed increased activity of SOX family motifs, including Sox2 and SoxF family members in the late-generation LN lines ( Figure 2 J). Sox2 and SoxF are regulators of stem cell states, tumor progression, lymph vasculature, and metastasis ( Duong et al., 2012 28. Duong, T. ∙ Proulx, S.T. ∙ Luciani, P. ...

Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors Cell. 2006; 126 :663-676 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17983) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating enrichment of general metastatic programs. The LN metastases also exhibited activity of a range of IFN-related motifs, including the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and other interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) and Stat TF-binding motifs ( Figure 2 J), pointing to a role for epigenetic reprogramming in driving the LN metastatic phenotype.
While signaling induced by type I and II IFNs activates hundreds of genes ( Rusinova et al., 2013 90. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shaw et al., 2017 98. Shaw, A.E. ∙ Hughes, J. ∙ Gu, Q. ... Fundamental properties of the mammalian innate immune system revealed by multispecies comparison of type I interferon responses PLoS Biol. 2017; 15 , e2004086 Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar ; Figures 2 B, S2 D, and S2G), the IFN-inducible genes for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) ( Cd274 ) and the major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) subunit beta-2 microglobulin ( B2m ) are noteworthy given their important roles in regulating immune responses to tumors ( Pardoll, 2003 78. Pardoll, D. Does the immune system see tumors as foreign or self? Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21 :807-839 Crossref Scopus (626) PubMed Google Scholar , 2012 79. Pardoll, D.M. The blockade of immune checkpoints in cancer immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2012; 12 :252-264 Crossref Scopus (8044) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 B and S2 D). Cd274 and B2m transcript abundance exhibit gradual increases across LN line generations ( Figure 3 A) and results in increased surface expression of PD-L1 and the classical MHC-Ia molecules H-2K b and H-2D b ( Figure 3 B). This upregulation was consistent across phylogenies ( Figure 3 A), was maintained in vivo ( Figure S3 A), and was stable in culture in the absence of exogenous IFNs ( Figure S3 B). Examination of the ATAC profiles at the Cd274 and B2m loci revealed increased accessibility of cis -regulatory regions ( Figure 2 I). In particular, we noted increases in putative regulatory elements distal to the Cd274 promoter, analogous to those found in human cancers ( Corces et al., 2018 21. Corces, M.R. ∙ Granja, J.M. ∙ Shams, S. ... The chromatin accessibility landscape of primary human cancers Science. 2018; 362 , eaav1898 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ).
RNA-seq revealed no expression of any of the IFNs by the tumor cells, and constant expression of the IFN receptors (IFNRs) across generations ( Figure S3 C). Furthermore, knockout of Ifnb1 yielded no differences in the PD-L1 and MHC-I levels ( Figure S3 D). Nonetheless, stimulation of the parental and LN6 lines with IFN-α and IFN-γ induced increased expression of PD-L1 and MHC-I beyond even the basal levels of the LN lines ( Figure 3 B). While various Stat genes were upregulated ( Figure S3 E), the LN lines did not exhibit consistent increases in phospho-Stats (pStats) ( Figure S3 F). Stimulation with IFN-α or IFN-γ both induced pStat1 and pStat3 levels beyond the basal levels ( Figure S3 F). Thus, elevation in basal ISG expression in the LN lines is not a consequence of increased total or phosphorylated Stats but rather epigenetic rewiring resulting in increased access to Stat TF-binding sites.
To ask whether exposure to IFNs was originally required for the acquisition of the ISG signature, we knocked out both Ifnar1 and Ifngr1 in the parental line, ablating its ability to respond to IFNs ( Figure 3 B). When implanted into mice, only 10% of the IFNR double-knockout (DKO) tumors yielded LN metastases as compared with 43% of wild-type tumors ( Figure 3 C). We generated two first-generation (LN1) cell lines from LN metastases of the IFNR DKO tumors (IFNRKOLN1 lines). When re-implanted into new recipients, these IFNRKOLN1 tumors again metastasized to LNs at much lower frequencies (14%) compared with wild-type LN1 tumors (92%) ( Figure 3 C). While MHC-I was upregulated in the IFNRKONLN1 lines compared with the parental, PD-L1 was not ( Figure 3 B), suggesting that the acquisition of portions of the ISG signature requires conditioning from IFNs. The IFNRKOLN1 lines were still unresponsive to IFN stimulation, demonstrating that the upregulation was not due to expansion of an unedited subpopulation ( Figure 3 B).
We next knocked out Ifnar1 , Ifngr1 , or Stat1 in the parental and LN6 cells ( Figure 3 D). Stimulation of the control parental and LN6 cells with either IFN-α or IFN-γ induced elevated expression of H-2K b , H-2D b , and PD-L1, while knockout of Ifnar1 and Ifngr1 abolished their ability to respond ( Figure 3 E). Knockout of Stat1 reduced responses to IFN-γ to levels equivalent to those of the unstimulated cells, while only partially reducing responses to IFN-α stimulation, demonstrating that additional Stat family members contribute to type I IFN signaling, as expected ( Figure 3 E). Knockout of the IFNRs and Stat1 had only modest effects on the basal PD-L1 and MHC-I levels in the parental cells ( Figures 3 E and S3 G). In contrast, while knockout of Ifngr1 in the LN6 cells did not affect their levels, knockout of Ifnar1 and Stat1 both reduced MHC-I levels to nearly those of the parental and slightly reduced PD-L1 levels as well ( Figures 3 E and S3 G). These findings suggest that type I IFNR might play a role in maintaining stable ISG expression. We additionally performed RNA-seq on all of the knockout lines ( Figures 3 F and 3G). While knockout of Ifngr1 had a modest effect on the expression levels of some ISGs, knockout of Ifnar1 or Stat1 reduced expression of a subset to the parental levels ( Figure 3 F). The reliance of a portion of the IFN signature upon the type I IFNR is noteworthy given the absence of the ligand ( Figures S3 B–S3D). The cytoplasmic tail of Ifnar1 does not directly associate with the Jaks and Stats ( Zanin et al., 2021 118. Zanin, N. ∙ Viaris de Lesegno, C. ∙ Lamaze, C. ... Interferon receptor trafficking and signaling: journey to the cross roads Front. Immunol. 2021; 11 :615603 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that Ifnar1-Ifnar2 dimerization may occur in the absence of ligand at a frequency sufficient to maintain a basal level of Stat phosphorylation.
Not all upregulated genes, however, required type I IFNR signaling for their expression. Clustering of the differentially expressed genes across the various knockout lines yielded four distinct clusters of genes ( Figure 3 G). Genes in cluster I are downregulated during LN metastasis and likely reflect changes in adhesion and differentiation. Those in cluster III require Ifnar1 to maintain their upregulation. Genes in cluster II were at least partially upregulated in the IFNRKOLN1 lines and maintained in the Ifnar1 knockouts, suggesting that IFN signaling was not required for their upregulation during LN metastasis. These include the H2 genes, which is consistent with the increased MHC-I levels on the INFRKOLN1 lines ( Figure 3 B) and indicates that regulation of the H-2 subunits occurs independently of IFN signaling. Finally, genes in cluster IV are upregulated and are not reliant upon IFNR signaling for their expression yet are not upregulated in the IFNRKOLN1 lines, indicating that their initial upregulation was a consequence of IFN signaling. These genes include Cd274 , which is consistent with the observed lack of surface PD-L1 expression on the IFNRKOLN1 lines ( Figure 3 B) and the maintained PD-L1 expression on the LN6-sg Ifnar1 line ( Figures 3 E and S3 G). Thus, exposure to IFNs during LN metastasis induces the acquisition of an ISG program that is stably conferred through epigenetic rewiring and is partially reliant upon type I IFNR signaling even in the absence of exogenous IFNs ( Figure S3 H). Finally, we implanted the Stat1 knockout LN6 tumors into mice and found that they yielded less LN metastasis, demonstrating that the ISG program plays a critical role in LN metastasis ( Figure 3 H).
To understand the factors that contribute to the initial spread of tumor cells to LNs, we identified genes differentially expressed between the parental and first LN generation ( Figure 4 A). Many MHC-I genes were strongly upregulated in the first-generation lines ( Figures 4 B and S4 A). Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that can attack tumors by recognizing loss of MHC-I or overexpression of NKG2D ligands ( Raulet, 2003 87. Raulet, D.H. Roles of the NKG2D immunoreceptor and its ligands Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3 :781-790 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wu and Lanier, 2003 114. Wu, J. ∙ Lanier, L.L. Natural killer cells and cancer Adv. Cancer Res. 2003; 90 :127-156 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we queried the susceptibility of multiple LN lines to NK cell cytotoxicity and found that they were 3- to 5-fold less susceptible to killing than the parental tumor ( Figure 4 C). Additionally, depletion of NK cells in mice bearing the parental tumors increased LN metastasis ( Figure 4 D).
Evaluation of the NKG2D ligand transcripts revealed only modest differences in expression occurring in only a subset of phylogenies ( Figure S4 B). Incubation of various lines with NKG2D-Fc fusion proteins revealed slight increases in NKG2D binding to the LN lines compared with the parental ( Figure S4 C). While alterations in NKG2D ligands may attenuate NK cell immunosurveillance ( Deng et al., 2015 25. Deng, W. ∙ Gowen, B.G. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Antitumor immunity. A shed NKG2D ligand that promotes natural killer cell activation and tumor rejection Science. 2015; 348 :136-139 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Oppenheim et al., 2005 77. Oppenheim, D.E. ∙ Roberts, S.J. ∙ Clarke, S.L. ... Sustained localized expression of ligand for the activating NKG2D receptor impairs natural cytotoxicity in vivo and reduces tumor immunosurveillance Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6 :928-937 Crossref Scopus (340) PubMed Google Scholar ), their modest increase seems unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of NK evasion.
In contrast, H2 genes were rapidly upregulated in the LN lines ( Figures 4 B and S4 A), suggesting a potential early adaptation by which tumors evade NK recognition while disseminating to LNs. Knockout of B2m in an LN6 line ablated MHC-I expression ( Figure S4 D) and resulted in reduced LN metastasis ( Figures 4 E and 4F), despite equivalent primary tumor burden ( Figure S4 E). Furthermore, depletion of NK cells rescued the metastatic capacity of the B2m knockout tumors ( Figure 4 G), demonstrating the critical role of MHC-I upregulation in NK evasion during early LN metastasis.
Unlike the H2 genes ( Figures 4 B and S4 A), B2m expression increased gradually across the generations, in concert with the other ISGs ( Figure 3 A). Furthermore, there is no master regulator of the H2 loci and multiple mechanisms control their expression independently from IFN signaling ( Jongsma et al., 2019 48. Jongsma, M.L.M. ∙ Guarda, G. ∙ Spaapen, R.M. The regulatory network behind MHC class I expression Mol. Immunol. 2019; 113 :16-21 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, while the ISGs such as PD-L1 exhibit a gradual increase in protein expression across LN generations, surface levels of H-2D b increased markedly by the first generation ( Figure 4 H). β2m is a highly abundant protein even in the basal state, with expression levels that far exceed the H2 genes ( Figure 3 A), indicating that the initial levels of MHC-I are regulated by H2 protein abundance, and IFN signaling provides only minor contributions to MHC-I levels in later generation lines ( Figure S4 F). Thus, the immediate upregulation of MHC-I occurs independently of IFN signaling, as is consistent with its increases on the IFNRKOLN1 lines ( Figures 4 B, 4F, and 4G).
Upregulation of MHC-I and PD-L1 was conserved across tumor phylogenies ( Figures 4 I and S4 G). By contrast, B16-F10, a lung-metastatic descendant of the parental B16-F0 line ( Fidler, 1973 33. Fidler, I.J. Selection of successive tumour lines for metastasis Nat. New Biol. 1973; 242 :148-149 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), does not exhibit increases in PD-L1 or MHC-I, suggesting that these changes are specific to LN metastases ( Figures 4 I and S4 G). We next generated lines from LN metastases in immunocompromised mice, including a Rag2 −/− mouse, which lacks B and T cells, and a Rag2 −/− ;Il2rg −/− mouse, which lacks B, T, and NK cells. In comparison with LN1 lines from wild-type mice, the line derived from the Rag2 −/− mouse did not upregulate PD-L1, though it did upregulate MHC-I molecules ( Figure 4 J), while the line derived from the Rag2 −/− ;Il2rg −/− mouse exhibited no upregulation of either PD-L1 or MHC-I ( Figure 4 J). Thus, the upregulation of MHC-I is likely a response to NK cell pressure, while upregulation of PD-L1 and other ISGs are likely a response to adaptive immunity.
PD-L1 plays a critical role in regulating T cell responses and is one of the most important targets of ICB ( Brahmer et al., 2012 14. Brahmer, J.R. ∙ Tykodi, S.S. ∙ Chow, L.Q.M. ... Safety and activity of anti–PD-L1 antibody in patients with advanced cancer N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366 :2455-2465 Crossref Scopus (5500) PubMed Google Scholar ). Knockout of PD-L1 from the LN metastatic tumors ( Figure S4 H) resulted in fewer LN metastases ( Figure 4 K). This effect could be abrogated through depletion of T cells ( Figure 4 L), suggesting that upregulation of PD-L1 enhances LN metastasis through suppression of T cell responses. Finally, overexpression of PD-L1 in the parental tumor enhanced LN metastasis ( Figure 4 M).
We also generated a line from a LN metastasis of a Kras G12D/+ ;LSL-Trp53 R172H/+ ;Pdx-1-Cre pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor ( Tseng et al., 2010 108. Tseng, W.W. ∙ Winer, D. ∙ Kenkel, J.A. ... Development of an orthotopic model of invasive pancreatic cancer in an immunocompetent murine host Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16 :3684-3695 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found it to exhibit higher PD-L1 and MHC-I expression ( Figure 4 N), as did a LN metastases from the MOC2 syngeneic model of HNSCC ( Judd et al., 2012 49. Judd, N.P. ∙ Winkler, A.E. ∙ Murillo-Sauca, O. ... ERK1/2 regulation of CD44 modulates oral cancer aggressiveness Cancer Res. 2012; 72 :365-374 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 4 O). A higher percentage of LN metastases from melanoma patients had positive PD-L1 staining than primary tumors ( Figure 4 P). Furthermore, tumor cells isolated from HNSCC patients exhibited higher levels of the MHC-I and PD-L1 transcripts in patients with LN metastases ( Figure 4 Q). Analysis of Cd274 transcripts in the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) TCGA (the Cancer Genome Atlas) dataset also revealed their elevation in LN metastases compared with primary tumors ( Figure 4 R). Moreover, similar to our murine data ( Figure 4 I), PD-L1 was lowest in distant metastases, suggesting that this phenotype is LN specific in both mice and humans.
Mice bearing LN tumors exhibited reductions in T to B cell ratios in the involved nodes ( Figure 5 A) and increases in regulatory T cell (Treg) fractions ( Figure 5 B). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the LNs of mice with parental tumors, LN6 tumors, or neither. Seurat clustering ( Butler et al., 2018 16. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (3315) PubMed Google Scholar ) and visualization by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction ( Becht et al., 2018 6. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38 Crossref Scopus (1214) Google Scholar ) identified 20 distinct cell clusters ( Figures 5 B and S5 A). LN6 tumors induced marked shifts in the B and T cell clusters ( Figures 5 D–5F). In particular, the LN6 tumors induced expansion of B cells in clusters “0” and “6” ( Figure 5 D), the latter of which was distinguished by its increased ISG expression ( Figures 5 G and 5H), reaffirming the induction of IFN signaling upon initial dissemination.
CD4 and CD8 T cells were composed of multiple clusters ( Figures 5 C, 5E, and 5F). The presence of tumors induced a shift away from the T cell clusters with features of naive or resting T cell populations toward the activated T cell clusters ( Figures 5 E, 5F, S5 B, and S5C). These effects were most notable in the CD8 T cell compartment in mice bearing LN6 tumors ( Figure 5 F). NK cells from the LN6 tumor-bearing mice exhibited features consistent with reduced activation ( Figure 5 I). While cluster “8” has features consistent with classical activated effector CD8 T cells (e.g., expression of Prf1 , Cxcr3 , and Cd44 ), cluster “13” is instead distinguished by its highly elevated expression of Stat1 ( Figure S5 C) and is particularly enriched in the LN6 condition ( Figure 5 F). Furthermore, the cluster “8” cells in the LN6 condition have lower Cxcr3 expression, potentially suggestive of reduced activation ( Figure 5 J), while the cells in cluster “13” trend toward increased expression of Tox , a regulator of T cell exhaustion ( Khan et al., 2019 52. Khan, O. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ McDonald, S. ... TOX transcriptionally and epigenetically programs CD8+ T cell exhaustion Nature. 2019; 571 :211-218 Crossref Scopus (434) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the LN6 condition ( Figure 5 K). Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the increase in CD44 + CD62L − activated CD8 T cells as well as increases in PD-1 + fractions of the CD8 T cells ( Figure 5 L), suggesting that LN metastasis may induce exhaustion.
LN6 tumors induce a shift away from naive Tregs toward activation, with decreases in Ccr7 and Sell and increases in activation genes and ISGs ( Figure 5 M). The Tregs also exhibited reductions in Bach2 , which prevents Treg differentiation ( Sidwell et al., 2020 99. Sidwell, T. ∙ Liao, Y. ∙ Garnham, A.L. ... Attenuation of TCR-induced transcription by Bach2 controls regulatory T cell differentiation and homeostasis Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :252 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Satb1 , which affects development of thymic Tregs ( Chorro et al., 2018 18. Chorro, L. ∙ Suzuki, M. ∙ Chin, S.S. ... Interleukin 2 modulates thymic-derived regulatory T cell epigenetic landscape Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5368 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a shift toward peripherally induced Tregs.
As the myeloid populations represent only a small fraction of the total cells within LNs, we analyzed them by flow cytometry, comparing mice with LN metastases with those without or tumor-naive mice. LN metastasis induced increases in both the fractions and total numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in involved LNs ( Figures 5 N and S5 E). These macrophages also expressed higher levels of PD-L1 ( Figure 5 N). Neutrophils in mice bearing the LN6 tumors expressed a variety of genes associated with immature or immunosuppressive phenotypes (e.g., Arg2, Il1b , and Wfdc17 ) ( Figure S5 D). Within the dendritic cell (DC) compartment, LN metastasis induced a shift from MHC-II hi CD11c int migratory DCs (mDCs) toward MHC-II int CD11c hi resident DCs (rDCs) ( Figures 5 N and S5 E) and reductions in cross-presenting Xcr1 + classical DC type 1 (cDC1) cells. Within the mDC and rDC subsets, there was a reduction in CD103 + and CD8α + cDC1s, respectively. Instead, the rDC subset was dominated by CD11b + CD8α − cells ( Figure S5 E). In general, mice bearing LN metastases had higher quantities of CD11b + DCs ( Figures 5 N and S5 E). Furthermore, CD11b + SIRPα + cDC2s expressed higher levels of PD-L1 compared with Xcr1 + cDC1s. Thus, the alterations within the myeloid compartment are consistent with an immunosuppressive microenvironment.
We additionally analyzed alterations in immune repertoires in an autochthonous Braf V600E GEMM of melanoma ( Dankort et al., 2009 23. Dankort, D. ∙ Curley, D.P. ∙ Cartlidge, R.A. ... Braf(V600E) cooperates with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma Nat. Genet. 2009; 41 :544-552 Crossref Scopus (820) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that the immune repertoires of the involved nodes demonstrated alterations analogous to those seen in our transplantable models ( Figures 5 O and S5 F).
We next implanted either the parental or LN tumors into both wild-type and Rag2 −/− ;Il2rg −/− mice. While growth kinetics of the parental tumors were somewhat enhanced, they were nearly equivalent for the LN tumors ( Figures S6 A and S6B). In contrast, the immunocompromised mice bearing the parental or LN tumors exhibited far more lung metastases ( Figure 6 A), suggesting that lymphocytes play a central role in preventing distant metastasis, even when incapable of eliminating primary tumors. Similarly, Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus Polyoma Virus middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) breast cancer mice exhibited a greater lung-metastatic burden when crossed to the Rag2 −/− background ( Figure S6 C).
Thus, we asked whether LN metastases promote distant seeding through conditioning of the immune system. NOD- scid IL2Rg null (NSG) mice were implanted with the parental or LN tumors and later challenged with intravenous injections of the parental tumor line, as in Figure 1 J. In contrast to the wild-type setting, the LN tumors did not promote lung seeding, suggesting that the differences in metastasis seen in wild-type mice reflect differences in lymphocyte responses ( Figure 6 B). We also repeated the initial studies in immunocompetent mice but replaced the intravenous injection of the parental B16-F0 tumor line with MC38, a syngeneic colorectal cancer line, and observed no increase in lung seeding with the LN6 tumors ( Figure 6 C), suggesting that the pro-metastatic immune conditioning is tumor specific. Finally, we repeated these studies in LT-α knockout ( Lta −/− ) mice, which lack LNs ( De Togni et al., 1994 24. De Togni, P. ∙ Goellner, J. ∙ Ruddle, N.H. ... Abnormal development of peripheral lymphoid organs in mice deficient in lymphotoxin Science. 1994; 264 :703-707 Crossref Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ), and found that mice lacking LNs exhibited fewer lung metastases, indicating that the conditioning is mediated, at least in part, through effects within LNs ( Figure 6 D).
Finally, we asked whether the leukocytes within tumor-involved LNs are sufficient to promote metastatic seeding. We adoptively transferred purified leukocytes from the LNs of mice with or without LN metastases into tumor-naive recipients followed by intravenous inoculation of parental tumor cells. Those that received leukocytes from mice with LN tumors were more susceptible to lung colonization than those that received leukocytes from mice with only primary tumors ( Figure 6 E), demonstrating that LN metastasis conditions leukocytes within LNs to promote metastasis.
To determine whether upregulation of MHC-I renders LN metastases susceptible to CD8 T cell cytotoxicity, we overexpressed the ovalbumin (Ova) in the parental and LN8 lines and co-cultured them with OT-I CD8 T cells, which express transgenic TCRs that recognize Ova. T cells cultured with the LN8 cells were considerably more activated than those cultured with the parental ( Figure S6 D). Furthermore, OT-I T cells preferentially killed LN8 cells over parental cells ( Figures 6 F and S6 E). When implanted into wild-type mice, the Ova-expressing parental and LN8 tumors exhibited similar growth kinetics ( Figure S6 F). In contrast, while OT-I mice initially cleared both the parental and LN8 lines, LN8 tumors eventually escaped growth inhibition more frequently than parental tumors ( Figures 6 G and S6 F), suggesting that the LN tumors can overcome antigen-specific CD8-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo .
WES of the LN lines revealed no evidence of changes in tumor mutational burden or neoantigen burden, nor were there changes in expression of the neoantigens ( Figures 6 H, 5 J, and S6 G). Furthermore, there was no loss in expression of common melanoma antigens ( Figure S6 H). Thus, the LN metastases do not escape T cell recognition through classical immunoediting ( Schreiber et al., 2011 96. Schreiber, R.D. ∙ Old, L.J. ∙ Smyth, M.J. Cancer immunoediting: integrating immunity’s roles in cancer suppression and promotion Science. 2011; 331 :1565-1570 Crossref Scopus (3749) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Tregs can suppress anti-tumor T cell responses and exhibit antigen specificity ( Plitas and Rudensky, 2020 84. Plitas, G. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Regulatory T cells in cancer Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2020; 4 :459-477 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and in light of the tumor-specific promotion of distant metastases ( Figure 6 C), we found the increase in Tregs ( Figure 5 B) particularly noteworthy. The increase in Tregs in LNs was consistent in mice bearing different LN lines as well as the MMTV-PyMT breast cancer GEMM ( Figure 5 B, 6 K, and S6 I), and the LN lines possess an enhanced capacity to induce Treg differentiation ( Figures 6 L and S6 J). Cytokine profiling of both supernatants from the cell lines and sera of tumor-bearing mice revealed marked differences in a variety of cytokines, including elevated levels of TGF-β in the sera of mice bearing the LN line ( Figures 6 M, S6 K, and S6L). RNA-seq revealed modest, if any, increases in expression of the three Tgfb isoforms, suggesting that additional sources of the protein are likely ( Figure S6 M). TGF-β can elicit a range of deleterious effects during tumor progression ( Mariathasan et al., 2018 65. Mariathasan, S. ∙ Turley, S.J. ∙ Nickles, D. ... TGFβ attenuates tumour response to PD-L1 blockade by contributing to exclusion of T cells Nature. 2018; 554 :544-548 Crossref Scopus (1651) PubMed Google Scholar ; Massagué, 2008 66. Massagué, J. TGFβ in cancer Cell. 2008; 134 :215-230 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2906) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tauriello et al., 2018 106. Tauriello, D.V.F. ∙ Palomo-Ponce, S. ∙ Stork, D. ... TGFβ drives immune evasion in genetically reconstituted colon cancer metastasis Nature. 2018; 554 :538-543 Crossref Scopus (823) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is important for the induction of peripheral Tregs ( Plitas and Rudensky, 2020 84. Plitas, G. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Regulatory T cells in cancer Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2020; 4 :459-477 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). While neutralization of TGF-β had no effect on primary tumor growth ( Figure S6 N), anti-TGF-β reduced the promotion of distant metastasis by LN tumors to that of the parental tumors ( Figure 6 N). Additionally, consistent with reports in breast cancer ( Núñez et al., 2020 76. Núñez, N.G. ∙ Tosello Boari, J. ∙ Ramos, R.N. ... Tumor invasion in draining lymph nodes is associated with Treg accumulation in breast cancer patients Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3272 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), HNSCC patients with LN metastases had higher percentages of Tregs in their LNs ( Figure 6 O). Thus, we depleted Tregs in Foxp3 DTR mice implanted with parental or LN6 tumors and found that mice lacking Tregs exhibited markedly reduced growth kinetics and LN metastasis ( Figures 6 P and S6 O).
To determine whether Tregs also play a role in distant metastasis, we implanted Foxp3 DTR mice with LN tumors and depleted Tregs prior to intravenous injections of B16-F0-tdTomato cells. System-wide depletion of Tregs resulted in a marked reduction in the number of lung metastases ( Figure 7 A). We next asked whether the Tregs derived specifically from the LNs of mice with LN metastases might be responsible for this effect. GFP + Tregs were isolated from LNs of FoxP3 EGFP mice bearing primary parental tumors with or without LN tumors. Equivalent numbers of Tregs were transferred from the LNs of mice with (LN+) or without (LN−) LN tumors to recipient mice previously injected with subcutaneous parental tumors and intravenous B16-F0-tdTomato cells ( Figure 7 B). While recipient mice exhibited no differences in their primary tumor sizes, those that received Tregs from LN+ mice had more lung metastases ( Figure 7 B). Thus, Tregs from LN metastases possess a greater capacity to promote distant metastasis than Tregs from uninvolved LNs those derived from mice with only primary tumors.
To determine whether the induced Tregs are antigen specific, we implanted Ova-expressing primary tumors into mice and subsequently implanted Ova-expressing LN8 cells into their LNs. MHC-II-Ova-tetramer staining revealed increased fractions of Ova-specific Tregs in mice bearing LN tumors compared with mice bearing only primary tumors despite Ova expression by those primaries ( Figure 7 C). To further determine whether this antigen specificity is essential for the promotion of distant metastasis, we implanted parental or LN6 tumors lacking Ova expression into OT-II mice, whose CD4 T cells express a transgenic TCR that recognizes only Ova 323-339 , prior to intravenous injections of B16-F0-tdTomato. Mice bearing the LN6 tumors exhibited no increases in lung metastases compared with the parental tumor, suggesting that recognition of tumor antigens by the CD4 T cell compartment, including Tregs, is necessary for the promotion of distant metastasis by the LN tumors ( Figure 7 D).
Finally, we asked whether the presence of LN metastases induces the preferential expansion of antigen-specific Tregs. We implanted wild-type congenic CD45.1 mice with Ova-expressing parental or LN8 tumors and adoptively transferred naive CD4 T cells from CD45.2 OT-II mice and fluorescent reporter CD45.2 wild-type mice ( Figure 7 E). Regardless of the tumor type, few, if any reporter Tregs were detectable among the CD45.2 + cells within LNs. Similarly, mice bearing the parental tumors showed minimal MHC-II-Ova-tetramer + CD45.2 + Tregs. In contrast, mice bearing the LN8 tumors exhibited increased numbers of Ova-specific CD45.2 + Tregs, and this increase occurred only in mice with detectable LN metastases ( Figure 7 E). Thus, LN metastases preferentially induce, expand, and maintain tumor-specific Tregs. Taken together, these data demonstrate LN metastases induce antigen-specific naive CD4 T cells to differentiate into Tregs, and these antigen-specific Tregs promote metastatic seeding of distant tissues.

Section: Discussion

Although nearly all patients whose malignancies spread to distant tissues first exhibit involvement of LNs, whether such involvement has a functional bearing on subsequent metastasis to distant tissues has remained a matter of contention ( Pereira et al., 2015 82. Pereira, E.R. ∙ Jones, D. ∙ Jung, K. ... The lymph node microenvironment and its role in the progression of metastatic cancer Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 38 :98-105 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Currently, there exist two prevailing models of metastasis. The first, pioneered by William Halsted, posits that tumors spread first to LNs where they acquire additional metastatic traits and subsequently disseminate to distant tissues ( Halsted, 1907 40. Halsted, W.S. I. The results of radical operations for the cure of carcinoma of the breast Ann. Surg. 1907; 46 :1-19 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, a second model suggests that tumors spread independently to LNs and distant tissues, with LN metastases serving no role in the formation of distant metastases aside from their prognostic value. This model is informed by reconstruction of clonal phylogenies of patient tumors using sequencing approaches ( Gundem et al., 2015 38. Gundem, G. ∙ Van Loo, P. ∙ Kremeyer, B. ...

Minimal functional driver gene heterogeneity among untreated metastases Science. 2018; 361 :1033-1037 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings reconcile these contradictory models by demonstrating that LN colonization plays a critical role in metastatic progression, not by necessarily serving as cellular sources to seed distant metastases, but rather by inducing tumor-specific immune tolerance that renders distant tissues amenable to metastatic colonization ( Figure S7 ). In agreement with the prognostic value of LN involvement across a wide range of solid malignancies ( Gershenwald et al., 1999 34. Gershenwald, J.E. ∙ Thompson, W. ∙ Mansfield, P.F. ...

Oncol. 2011; 103 :518-530 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), our model, which we have termed “Metastatic Tolerance,” demonstrates the critical antecedent nature of nodal involvement without restricting phylogenetic origin of distant metastases.
We found that tumors initially upregulate MHC-I to evade NK cells, upregulate ISGs, including PD-L1, in response to chronic IFN signaling, alter the immune compartment within LNs, induce antigen-specific Treg differentiation, and promote metastasis to distant tissues through the induction of tumor-specific immune tolerance ( Figure 7 F). Knockout of the IFNRs prevented the acquisition of the ISG signature and reduced the capacity of the tumors to metastasize to LNs, yet exposure to IFNs was not required to maintain these attributes ( Figure 3 ). Instead, a basal level of phosphorylated Stat proteins is maintained, perhaps through transient dimerization of the Ifnar1 and Ifnar2 in the absence of ligand. Stat TFs only drive transcription of ISGs following increased accessibility of the ISRE and GAS sites that results from chronic exposure to IFNs. These features do not arise in the absence of IFNR expression by the tumor cells ( Figure 3 ) nor in the absence of lymphocytes ( Figure 4 J), suggesting that interactions with T cells, major producers of type II IFN, may drive the selection for a LN metastatic phenotype through chronic IFN production during the initial anti-tumor response to the metastases. While IFN signaling is classically associated with positive prognoses ( Dunn et al., 2006 27. Dunn, G.P. ∙ Koebel, C.M. ∙ Schreiber, R.D. Interferons, immunity and cancer immunoediting Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6 :836-848 Crossref Scopus (1120) PubMed Google Scholar ), it has also been correlated with PD-L1 and IDO expression and Treg accumulation ( Spranger et al., 2013 101. Spranger, S. ∙ Spaapen, R.M. ∙ Zha, Y. ... Up-regulation of PD-L1, IDO, and T(regs) in the melanoma tumor microenvironment is driven by CD8(+) T cells Sci. Transl.

Colocalization of inflammatory response with B7-H1 expression in human melanocytic lesions supports an adaptive resistance mechanism of immune escape Sci. Transl. Med. 2012; 4 :127ra37 Crossref Scopus (1592) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chronic viral infections and malignancies can induce T cell exhaustion, an epigenetically conferred state, which is partially affected by exposure to IFNs in the context of persistent TCR stimulation ( Wherry and Kurachi, 2015 111. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Kurachi, M. Molecular and cellular insights into T cell exhaustion Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :486-499 Crossref Scopus (1931) PubMed Google Scholar ). Radiation therapy and ICB also induce chronic IFN-γ signaling resulting in epigenetic reprogramming of tumor cells and constitutive activation of ISGs, enabling T cell inhibition ( Benci et al. 2016 8. Benci, J.L. ∙ Xu, B. ∙ Qiu, Y. ...

Combination cancer therapies with immune checkpoint blockade: convergence on interferon signaling Cell. 2016; 165 :272-275 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (197) PubMed Google Scholar ). The epigenetically instilled upregulation of the ISGs in LN metastases appears to approximate the observations from those studies, suggesting that LN metastasis and treatment resistance may share similar molecular mechanisms to suppress immune responses.
H2 genes were immediately upregulated by in the LN metastases in a manner independent of IFN signaling. Increased NLRC5 enhanceosome or NF-κB activity could be responsible for their rapid upregulation ( Jongsma et al., 2019 48. Jongsma, M.L.M. ∙ Guarda, G. ∙ Spaapen, R.M. The regulatory network behind MHC class I expression Mol. Immunol. 2019; 113 :16-21 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activation of cGAS-STING and NF-κB signaling endows tumors exhibiting chromosomal instability with enhanced metastatic potential ( Bakhoum et al., 2018 4. Bakhoum, S.F. ∙ Ngo, B. ∙ Laughney, A.M. ... Chromosomal instability drives metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response Nature. 2018; 553 :467-472 Crossref Scopus (522) PubMed Google Scholar ). Perhaps, such mechanisms may drive selection for tumors with upregulated MHC-I. Disruption of antigen presentation by tumors through loss of heterozygosity of B2M or the HLA alleles is a common feature of tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to ICB ( McGranahan et al., 2017 67.

In contrast to LN metastases, lung metastases downregulated MHC-I, suggesting that MHC-I upregulation may be specific to LN metastasis. Perhaps, upregulation of MHC-I facilitates NK evasion during dissemination to LNs but also activates CD8 T cells and IFN-γ production, ultimately leading to epigenetic reprogramming and immunosuppression prior to dissemination of less immunogenic clones to distant tissues.
Unlike other factors that promote metastasis through immune- or antigen-independent mechanisms, LN colonization induces tumor-specific immune tolerance. Stimulation of the TCR on Tregs is critical for their differentiation and maintenance ( Levine et al., 2014 56. Levine, A.G. ∙ Arvey, A. ∙ Jin, W. ...

Plitas, G. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Regulatory T cells in cancer Annu. Rev. Cancer Biol. 2020; 4 :459-477 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ), and Tregs in the blood and tumors of patients share tumor-specific TCR repertoires ( Ahmadzadeh et al., 2019 1. Ahmadzadeh, M. ∙ Pasetto, A. ∙ Jia, L. ... Tumor-infiltrating human CD4 + regulatory T cells display a distinct TCR repertoire and exhibit tumor and neoantigen reactivity Sci. Immunol. 2019; 4 , eaao4310 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our antigen-specific Treg findings indicate that the induction of tumor-specific Tregs represents a potent mechanism by which LN metastases induce tumor-specific immune tolerance. While trafficking of various cDC populations from tumors to LNs and antigen presentation by lymphatic endothelial cells generate antigen-specific responses to tumors ( Binnewies et al., 2019 9.

Expansion and activation of CD103(+) dendritic cell progenitors at the tumor site enhances tumor responses to therapeutic PD-L1 and BRAF inhibition Immunity. 2016; 44 :924-938 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results indicate that colonization of the LNs themselves is critical for the generation of systemic tumor-immune tolerance. Perhaps, in addition to providing a source of tumor antigens, the LN metastases also provide necessary suppressive signals to drive Treg differentiation. Additionally, these metastases could induce additional antigen-specific immunosuppressive processes such as the induction of T cell exhaustion, anergy, T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells, or regulatory B cells. Clinically, lymphadenectomy often does not improve patient survival despite providing considerable diagnostic utility ( Faries et al., 2017 32. Faries, M.B. ∙ Thompson, J.F. ∙ Cochran, A.J. ... Completion dissection or observation for sentinel-node metastasis in melanoma N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376 :2211-2222 Crossref Scopus (708) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that removal of involved nodes provides little benefit once systemic tolerance has been established while also eliminating the potential for CD8 T cell priming. Effective immunotherapy requires activation within LNs ( Spitzer et al., 2017 100. Spitzer, M.H. ∙ Carmi, Y. ∙ Reticker-Flynn, N.E. ... Systemic immunity is required for effective cancer immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :487-502 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ), and therapeutic approaches that repolarize immune responses within LNs away from tolerance and toward activation may represent a viable approach to enhancing the treatment of patients with stage IV disease.
LN metastasis represents a common feature across a wide range of solid tissue malignancies, suggesting that the mechanisms described here could apply to most solid tumors. While we have sought to validate aspects of our findings (e.g., features of the IFN response, Treg abundance, etc.) in multiple mouse and human cancers, our primary findings were generated in our melanoma model, and further studies are needed to determine their generalizability. Additionally, although our data indicate that colonization of the LN itself is a critical aspect of the generation of metastatic tolerance, we cannot rule out a role for soluble factors derived from the primary tumor in conditioning the LN. Finally, we demonstrated that the induction of tumor-specific Tregs is necessary for the promotion of distant metastasis, but the precise mechanisms by which these cells are induced within the LNs and subsequently spread throughout the host remain to be explored.

Genetic mice were also bred within this facility. All animal studies were performed in accordance with the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol APLAC-17466. All mice were housed in an American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited animal facility and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions. Rag2 -/- ;Il2rg -/- mice were generated by crossing B6(Cg)- Rag2 tm1.1Cgn /J mice (Jackson, 008449) with B6.129S4- Il2rg tm1Wjl /J mice (Jackson, 003174). MMTV-PyMT mice on the C57BL/6 background (B6.FVB-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/LellJ, Jackson, 022974) that were hemizygous for the transgene were crossed with B6(Cg)- Rag2 tm1.1Cgn /J mice to generate Rag2 -/- ;PyMT Tg/+ mice. All studies were performed in animals between 8 to 10 weeks of age, unless otherwise specified. All tumor transplant studies were performed in female mice, unless otherwise specified. Co-housing of different conditions was performed for all experiments.
Human HNSCC tissue collection was approved by the Stanford Research Compliance Office and was performed according to institutional guidelines under Stanford IRB protocol 38502, “Modeling the Role of Lymph Node Metastases in Tumor-Mediated Immunosuppression”. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. RNA-seq data was collected on 6 males and 8 females.
The B16-F0 and B16-F10 tumor lines were acquired from ATCC (CRL-6322 and CRL-6475) and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4mM L-glutamine, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin. LMP cells were generated as described previously ( Tseng et al., 2010 108. Tseng, W.W. ∙ Winer, D. ∙ Kenkel, J.A. ... Development of an orthotopic model of invasive pancreatic cancer in an immunocompetent murine host Clin. Cancer Res. 2010; 16 :3684-3695 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). MC38 cells were a gift from the Cornelis J.M. Melief Lab (Leiden University) and were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented as above. MOC2 tumors were generated by exposing the oral mucosa of mice to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), as described previously ( Judd et al., 2012 49. Judd, N.P. ∙ Winkler, A.E. ∙ Murillo-Sauca, O. ... ERK1/2 regulation of CD44 modulates oral cancer aggressiveness Cancer Res. 2012; 72 :365-374 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). MOC2 and MC38 lines were derived from female mice. The sex of LMP cells is unknown. B16 lines are reported to be male, but our WES data yielded negligible alignment to the Y chromosome. All tumor lines, including those generated as described below, were routinely tested for mycoplasma by PCR and all tests were negative. No additional authentication was performed.
For melanoma LN cell line generation, tumor cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and dissociated from tissue culture plastic with StemPro Accutase (Thermo, A1110501). Cell suspensions of 2×10 5 cells in phenol red free DMEM were injected into the subcutaneous region of the left flank of seven- to nine-week-old C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson, 000664) following removal of fur with surgical clippers. For PDAC LN cell line generation LMP cells were implanted into female B6129SF1/J mice (Jackson, 101043). Tumors were allowed to grow for 33 days or until mice were moribund, at which point mice were euthanized. Inguinal, brachial, and axillary LNs were harvested and mechanically dissociated on 100μm cell strainers. Strainers were washed with DMEM, and cells were resuspended and plated following centrifugation. Tumor cells were expanded ex vivo into cell lines and for three to six passages prior to injection into naïve recipients.
For experiments comparing the LN metastatic incidence rates between the tumor lines, cells were injected as described above, and mice were euthanized 33 days following injection. Inguinal, brachial, and axillary LNs were evaluated for their gross presence or absence of metastases.
The RGLN1-1348BL cell line was generated in Rag2 -/- ;Il2rg -/- mice and the R1-NT7AL cell line was generated in Rag2 -/- mice following the same approach as described above. For spontaneous lung metastasis assays with the B16-F0, LN6-987AL, and LN8-1205BL cell lines, wild-type or Rag2 -/- ;Il2rg -/- mice were injected with 2×10 5 cells into the subcutaneous region of the flank as described above. Mice were euthanized 26 days following inoculation and metastases were quantified based on the gross appearance of visible nodules. To quantify spontaneous lung metastases in the Rag-PyMT mice, mice were euthanized at 24 to 27 weeks of age. Lungs were fixed by intratracheal injection of 10% buffered formalin followed by paraffin embedding and staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Full lung sections were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 microscope. Tumor area was calculated as a percentage of the total lung area using the measurement tools in Adobe Photoshop.

Yang, J. ∙ Sanderson, N.S. ∙ Wawrowsky, K. ... Kupfer-type immunological synapse characteristics do not predict anti-brain tumor cytolytic T-cell function in vivo Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :4716-4721 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lentiviral constructs were generated by cloning the fluorescence or Ova genes into the pLVX-IRES-Hygro construct from Clontech (632185). The CMV promoter was also replaced with the human EF1a promoter. Lentiviral particles were packaged in HEK-293T cells using the pCMV-VSVG and psPAX2 envelope and packaging plasmids. psPAX2 was a gift from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid # 12260). pCMV-VSV-G was a gift from Bob Weinberg (Addgene plasmid # 8454) ( Stewart et al., 2003 102. Stewart, S.A. ∙ Dykxhoorn, D.M. ∙ Palliser, D. ... Lentivirus-delivered stable gene silencing by RNAi in primary cells RNA. 2003; 9 :493-501 Crossref Scopus (929) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo 11668019) in OptiMEM. Viral supernatant was harvested, and cell debris was filtered out using 0.45μm syringe filters. Supernatant was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with complete DMEM without antibiotics, polybrene was added at a final concentration of 4μg/mL, and the mixture was added to B16-F0, LN6-987AL, and MC38 cell lines. Transduced cell lines were selected in Hygromycin B at a concentration of 300μg/mL followed by two rounds of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on a FACSAria II (Becton Dickinson).
RNA was extracted at the time a tumor line was frozen following expansion and within one passage of implantation into naïve recipients for the creation of the next generation of lines. RNA was extracted using Qiashredders (Qiagen) and the RNEasy Plus mini kits (Qiagen). Library preparation and sequencing of the original parental and LN lines in Figure 2 were performed by Centrillion Genomic Services (Palo Alto, CA). Libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit, checked for size using the Agilent DNA 100 kit on a BioAnalyzer (Agilent), and quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina. Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 using the TruSeq SBS v2 Reagent Kit at 2 × 100 cycles paired-end to a depth of approximately 50M reads per sample. RNA from replicate parental tumor lines was obtained from lines harvested at different times and passages prior to and following cryopreservation in order to account for variances induced by cell culture. LN tumor lines subjected to sequencing were selected in order to encompass representation from all lineages, generations, and anatomic locations (i.e., those derived from different LNs). Library preparation and sequencing of the various IFNR and Stat1 knockout lines were prepared by MedGenome, Inc. (Foster City, CA). Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit, checked for quality as above, and sequenced on a NovaSeq S4 flowcell at 2 × 100 cycles paired-end to a depth of approximately 20M paired reads per sample.
DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Library preparation and sequencing were performed by Novogene (Beijing, China). Libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Agilent SureSelectXT Mouse All Exon Kit and quantified using the Agilent sensitivity DNA assay on a BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 at 2 × 150 cycles paired-end at 100× coverage.
Raw sequencing reads were filtered, and adapters trimmed using Trimmomatic ( Bolger et al., 2014 11. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (23415) PubMed Google Scholar ), and quality was evaluated using FastQC. Transcript abundance was quantified using Salmon v0.7.2 in quasi-mapping mode and using the sequence, GC, and position bias correction parameters ( Patro et al., 2017 80. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (2788) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mouse genome GRCm38 GENCODE release M11 was used for building the Salmon index file. Subsequent expression analysis was performed in R. TPM values were acquired using the tximport package. Mitochondrial reads (i.e., genes beginning with “mt-”) were removed, and TPM values were renormalized.
Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 60. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (25889) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparison groups are defined in Tables S1 and S2 . Counts were transformed and normalized using a regularized log transformation. To calculate Spearman correlations, the top 1000 HVGs (highly variable genes) were used to calculate sample correlation matrices. Pairwise Spearman correlations were calculated between each of the tumor lines, and hierarchical clustering was performed using Ward’s method to generate the correlation matrix and were plotted using ggplot2 ( Wickham, 2016 112. Wickham, H. ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis Springer-Verlag, 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ). PCAs were performed using the R statistics package. PCA plot from Figure S3 A was calculated using the top 500 highly variable genes, while that in Figure S3 B was calculated using the top 250 genes differentially expressed between the late- and early-stage LN line generations.
Tumor lines used to identify differentially regulated genes for the different analyses (e.g., Early vs. Late, specific phylogenetic lineages, etc.) are shown in Table S2 . Volcano plots were generated using ggplot2. Differentially expressed genes in blue were defined as genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.01 and |fold change| > 2. Interferon-related genes (dark blue) were identified by querying the Interferome v.2 database ( Rusinova et al., 2013 90. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( http://www.interferome.org ) for the differentially expressed genes (|Fold Change| ≥ 2). Heatmaps were generated using the heatmap3 package, which clusters based upon Euclidean distances ( Zhao et al., 2014 120. Zhao, S. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Sheng, Q. ... Advanced heat map and clustering analysis using Heatmap3 BioMed Res. Int. 2014; 2014 :986048 Crossref Scopus (159) PubMed Google Scholar ). The heatmap in Figure 2 was generated from the top 200 differentially expressed genes between the parental and LN8 lines.
GO analysis was performed as previously described using the Gene Ontology Consortium website ( http://www.geneontology.org/ ) ( Ashburner et al., 2000 3. Ashburner, M. ∙ Ball, C.A. ∙ Blake, J.A. ... Gene ontology: tool for the unification of biology. The Gene Ontology Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 25 :25-29 Crossref Scopus (25321) PubMed Google Scholar ; The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2017 107. The Gene Ontology Consortium Expansion of the Gene Ontology KnowledgeBase and resources Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D331-D338 Crossref Scopus (1151) PubMed Google Scholar ). For GSEA, genes were ranked by fold change. The gene list was converted to the human orthologs using the HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (HCOP) search tool ( https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/hcop ) ( Eyre et al., 2007 31. Eyre, T.A. ∙ Wright, M.W. ∙ Lush, M.J. ... HCOP: a searchable database of human orthology predictions Brief. Bioinform. 2007; 8 :2-5 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gray et al., 2015 35.

GSEA v3.0 software ( Mootha et al., 2003 71. Mootha, V.K. ∙ Lindgren, C.M. ∙ Eriksson, K.F. ... PGC-1α-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes Nat. Genet. 2003; 34 :267-273 Crossref Scopus (5570) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subramanian et al., 2005 103. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ...

USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (23200) PubMed Google Scholar ) was run on the MSigDB Hallmarks database ( Liberzon et al., 2015 59. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The molecular signatures database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2907) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Pre-Ranked Gene List format, classic enrichment statistics, “meandiv” normalization, and for 10,000 permutations. Gene sets with FDRs equal to 0 after 10,000 permutations were depicted in Figure 2 as having an infinite –log 10 ( q -val). Database was accessed December 2017.
Samples were prepared for ATAC-seq following the Omni-ATAC protocol ( Corces et al., 2017 22. Corces, M.R. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ∙ Hamilton, E.G. ... An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :959-962 Crossref Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells detached with Accutase, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 50μL of ATAC-Resuspension Buffer (RSB, water with 10mM Tris-HCL, 10mM NaCl, and 3mM MhCl 2 ) supplemented with 0.1% NP40 (Sigma), 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma), and 0.01% Digitonin (Promega). Cells were incubated on ice for 3 minutes prior to adding 1mL RSB + 0.1% Tween-20. Samples were centrifuged and resuspended in 50μL of transposition mixture (2X TDE buffer + 2.5μL Tn5 Transposase (Illumina Tagment DNA Enzyme) + PBS + Digitonin + Tween-20 + water) incubated for 30min at 37°C on an orbital shaker. Samples were cleaned with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit. Samples were amplified for 5 cycles using the NEBNext 2X Master Mix, after which 5μL of the reaction was subjected to qRT-PCR amplification to determine the optimum number of additional cycles for each sample. The remainder of the initial reactions were then amplified these additional number of cycles (ranging from 5 to 7). Library cleanup was performed using the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator-5 Kit, samples were eluted in water, and library quantification was performed using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Additional library QC and sequencing was performed by MedGenome (Foster City, CA) on a NovaSeq at 2 × 100 cycles paired-end to a depth of approximately 50M paired reads per sample.
Trimmed and filtered reads were mapped to the mm10 reference genome using hisat2 ( Kim et al., 2019 53. Kim, D. ∙ Paggi, J.M. ∙ Park, C. ... Graph-based genome alignment and genotyping with HISAT2 and HISAT-genotype Nat. Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :907-915 Crossref Scopus (1660) PubMed Google Scholar ). Picard was used to mark and remove duplicates. Peaks were called individually for each sample using MACS2 ( Zhang et al., 2008 119. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (7696) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bam files and peak sets for each sample were loaded into R for further processing. For visualization of genome tracks, coverage files were normalized based on reads in transcription start sites (TSS), exported as bigwig files, and visualized in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). A union peak set of 500bp peaks encompassing all samples was created as previously described ( Corces et al., 2018 21. Corces, M.R. ∙ Granja, J.M. ∙ Shams, S. ... The chromatin accessibility landscape of primary human cancers Science. 2018; 362 , eaav1898 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ) by iteratively merging overlapping peaks. The peak by sample counts matrix was then imported into DESeq2 for differential analysis ( Love et al., 2014 60. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (25889) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chromvar was used to quantify TF activity in each sample ( Schep et al., 2017 95. Schep, A.N. ∙ Wu, B. ∙ Buenrostro, J.D. ... chromVAR: inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility from single-cell epigenomic data Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :975-978 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). HOMER was used to identify motifs enriched in specific differential peak sets ( Heinz et al., 2010 43. Heinz, S. ∙ Benner, C. ∙ Spann, N. ... Simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors prime cis -regulatory elements required for macrophage and B cell identities Mol. Cell. 2010; 38 :576-589 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5670) PubMed Google Scholar ). For HOMER analysis, the union peak set was used as background.
Human HNSCC tissue collection was approved by the Stanford Research Compliance Office and was performed according to institutional guidelines under Stanford IRB protocol 38502, “Modeling the Role of Lymph Node Metastases in Tumor-Mediated Immunosuppression”. All sequencing data are publicly available from NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus at GEO: GSE113839 . HNSCC primary samples available were included (two outliers were removed) in the study (see Table S3 ), and no covariate analyses were performed. Following tumor resection, tumors were dissociated and sorted by FACS into subsets of fibroblasts, leukocytes, and tumor cells using EPCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31 surface markers. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq4000. Identification of shared genes between the human HNSCC dataset and mouse melanoma dataset was based upon differentially expressed genes with log 2 (FC) ≥ 1 and adjusted p -val < 0.05. Differentially expressed genes in humans were determined by comparing node-positive (N+, n = 10) patients to node-negative (N0, n = 4) patients. In mice, they were determined by comparing late-generation lines to early-generation lines. Interferon-related genes were identified using the Interferome v2 database as described above.
LNs were harvested in HBSS supplemented with 2% FBS (HBSSF) on ice. LNs were subjected to mincing and digestion with Collagenase 4 (Worthington) in RPMI-1640 for 10 minutes at 37°C prior to dissociation on 70μm strainers. Suspensions were washed twice with HBSSF, counted, and resuspended in PBS + 0.04% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). 10X Genomics library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol by the Stanford Genome Sequencing Service Center.
Cell Ranger (version 3.1.0) was used to align reads (mm10, 3.0.0) and generate feature-barcode matrices for each sample (parental, LN6, or no tumor). Downstream analyses of gene expression matrices were performed in R (version 4.0.2) using the Seurat package (version 4.0) ( Hao et al., 2021 41. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587 e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (390) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, genes expressed in fewer than 10 cells were removed, and low-quality cells were removed if they had unique feature counts greater than 5000 or less than 300 or have mitochondrial counts greater than 20%. Potential cell doublets were manually filtered by further inspecting co-expressing canonical markers. About 82% of the cells were kept in the analyses for each sample. Data were then normalized with log transformation and 2000 features with high variations were included for clustering with cluster resolution of 1 using FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions. Nonlinear dimensional reduction (UMAP) was obtained using RunUMAP function with umap-learn and shared nearest neighbor (SNN) settings. Cluster cell type assignment was performed manually by inspecting canonical markers.
Raw sequencing reads were filtered, and adapters trimmed using the AGeNT Surecall Trimmer v.4.0.1, and quality was confirmed using FastQC v.0.11.3. Reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 (GRCm38.87) genome with bwa v.0.7.12 ( Li and Durbin, 2009 57. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows–Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (24011) PubMed Google Scholar ). Picard v2.17.0 was used to calculate alignment metrics and remove duplicates. SAMtools ( Li et al., 2009 58. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (28181) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to remove reads with a MAPQ < 5. Sorting and indexing were performed with Samtools. MuTect2 (GATK v.4.0.0.0) was used for mutation calling with the merged mouse dbSNP142 vcf file acquired from ftp://ftp-mouse.sanger.ac.uk/current_snps/ . Calls were filtered with FilterMutectCalls and SnpSift. Variants were annotated with SnpEff v.4.3 ( Cingolani et al., 2012 19. Cingolani, P. ∙ Platts, A. ∙ Wang, le L. ... A program for annotating and predicting the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms, SnpEff: SNPs in the genome of Drosophila melanogaster strain w1118; iso-2; iso-3 Fly. 2012; 6 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (4864) PubMed Google Scholar ) for coding regions only using the –no-downstream, -no-intergenic, -no-intron, -no-upstream, and –no-utr parameters. Driver gene mutations were confirmed by manual inspection using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute). Neoantigens were determined using MuPeXI v.1.2.0 ( Bjerregaard et al., 2017 10. Bjerregaard, A.M. ∙ Nielsen, M. ∙ Hadrup, S.R. ... MuPeXI: prediction of neo-epitopes from tumor sequencing data Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2017; 66 :1123-1130 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ) with expression data acquired from the TPM output of Salmon (see “RNA Sequencing Analysis” above). MHC-I peptide binding affinities were determined for H-2D b and H-2K b for length from 9 to 11 amino acids. MuPeXI was used in conjunction with NetMHCpan v.4.0 ( Jurtz et al., 2017 50. Jurtz, V. ∙ Paul, S. ∙ Andreatta, M. ... NetMHCpan-4.0: improved peptide-MHC Class I interaction predictions integrating eluted ligand and peptide binding affinity data J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :3360-3368 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) v.87.27 ( McLaren et al., 2016 68. McLaren, W. ∙ Gil, L. ∙ Hunt, S.E. ... The Ensembl variant effect predictor Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :122 Crossref Scopus (2370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genome track plot was generated with Circos v.0.69.4 ( Krzywinski et al., 2009 54. Krzywinski, M.I. ∙ Schein, J.E. ∙ Birol, I. ... Circos: an information aesthetic for comparative genomics Genome Res. 2009; 19 :1639-1645 Crossref Scopus (5809) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutation histogram tracks were set to a range of 0 to 150. Mutation and neoantigen bar plots and heatmaps were generated in R.
B16-F0-mWasabi and LN6-987AL-tdTomato (or B16-F0-tdTomato and LN6-987AL-mWasabi) lines were admixed following dissociation in Accutase and resuspension in phenol-red-free DMEM at a ratio of 1:1. Mixed cell suspensions of 2×10 5 total tumor cells were injected into the flanks of C57BL/6J female mice and allowed to grow for 32 days after which mice were euthanized and draining LNs were processed for flow cytometric analysis (gated on CD45 - ) or histological evaluation as described below. Lungs were inflated with PBS and imaged using an IVIS Spectrum imager (Caliper Life Sciences) or a Nikon SMZ1000 Stereo Dissection microscope equipped with metal halide fluorescence illumination. In some instances, LNs were also imaged on the dissection scope prior to processing for flow cytometry. Images were acquired with Nikon NIS-Elements software.
Eight-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 female mice were injected with B16-F0, LN6-987AL, or LN8-1198AR into the subcutaneous region of the flank as described above. Following 13 to 14 days of growth, 2.5×10 5 B16-F0-tdTomato or MC38-tdTomato cells, resuspended in phenol-red-free DMEM, were injected into the lateral tail veins of the mice. After 9 to 10 additional days of growth, mice were euthanized, and metastases were quantified based on gross appearance of visible nodules in the lungs and fluorescence microscopy on a Nikon fluorescence dissection microscope. These experiments were also performed in NOD- scid Il2Rg null (NSG) and OT-II mice, acquired from Jackson (005557 and 004194, respectively) and bred in our facility at Stanford University under sterile conditions.
For LT-α null studies, Lta -/- mice were acquired from Jackson (002258) and bred in our facilities at Stanford University. Wild-type splenocytes were isolated from eight-week-old female C57BL6/J mice. Spleens were dissociated and processed through 70μm cell strainers. Cells were subjected to ACK lysis, washed three times with PBS, resuspended in phenol-red-free DMEM, and injected into eight-week-old recipient C57BL/6J wild-type or Lta -/- mice by retroorbital injection. Equivalent numbers of donor and recipient mice were used. Three days later, 2 ×10 5 LN6-987AL cells were injected into the flanks of the mice. 14 days later, B16-F0-tdTomato cells were injected into the lateral tail veins of the mice. After nine additional days, mice were euthanized and the lungs were harvested, inflated with PBS, and imaged on a Nikon fluorescence dissection microscope.
For intra-LN transplantation experiments, tumors were implanted into wild-type mice during a brief surgery. 1×10 5 B16-F0 or LN6-987AL cells were resuspended in 20μL of phenol-red-free DMEM. Animals were anesthetized with 2.5% isofluorane and injected with 100μg/kg buprenorphine intraperitoneally, prior to surgery. Fur was removed with surgical clippers and the surgical area was sterilized with betadine and 70% ethanol. The left inguinal LN was exposed through a midline incision, and the cell suspension was injected with a 30G insulin syringe. Following injection, the skin was closed with 7mm wound clips (Roboz). Five days after intra-LN injections, 1×10 5 B16-F0-tdTomato cells were injected into the lateral tail veins as described above. After 11 days of additional growth, mice were euthanized, and lung metastases were quantified.
LNs were harvested in HBSS on ice. LNs were mechanically dissociated on 70μm cell strainers and washed with PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 2mM EDTA (FACS Buffer, FB). Tumor tissue was processed in an analogous manner, but also subjected to mincing and digestion with Collagenase 4 (Worthington) in RPMI-1640 for 20 minutes at 37°C prior to dissociation on 70μm strainers. In some experiments, LNs were also digested with Collagenase 4 for 10 minutes at 37°C prior to mechanical dissociation. Cells were stained for viability using LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Thermo, L34962). Surface staining was performed on ice prior to fixation. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the eBioscience FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization kit (Thermo, 00-5521-00). Intracellular staining was performed on ice, and cells were washed twice in permeabilization buffer prior to transfer back into FB. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometric analysis: Fc Block (BD Biosciences, 2.4G2), CD45 (BioLegend, 30-F11), CD3 (BioLegend, 17A2), CD4 (BioLegend, RM4-5), CD8a (BioLegend, 53-6.7), FoxP3 (eBioscience, NRRF-30 or FJK-16s or BD Pharmigen, MF23), CD25 (BioLegend, PC61), PD-1 (BioLegend, RMP1-30 and 29F.1A12), CD44 (BioLegend, IM7), CD62L (BioLegend, MEL-14), Ki-67 (BioLegend, 16A8), B220 (BioLegend, RA3-6B2), CD69 (BioLegend, H1.2F3), Granzyme B (BioLegend, GB11), IFNγ (BioLegend, XMG1.2), CD11c (BioLegend, N418), CD11b (BioLegend, M1/70), CD103 (BioLegend, 2E7), Xcr1 (BioLegend, ZET), I-A/I-E (BioLegend, M5/114.15.2), Ly-6G (BioLegend, 1A8), F4/80 (BioLegend, BM8), PD-L1 (BioLegend, 10F.9G2), SIRPα (BioLegend, P84), CD45.1 (BioLegend, A20), CD45.2 (BioLegend, 104), pStat1 (pY701) (BD Phosflow, 4a), pStat3 (pY705) (BD Phosflow, 4/P-STAT3), pStat4 (pY693) (BD Phosflow, 38/p-Stat4), and pStat5 (pY694) (BD Phosflow, 47/Stat5(pY694)). Samples were run on LSR II and LSRFortessa cytometers (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using FlowJo V10 software (TreeStar). Absolute counts were determined busing SPHERO AccuCount Fluorescent Particles (Spherotech), according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.
For flow cytometric analysis of cell lines, cells were dissociated with Accutase, washed with complete DMEM, and resuspended and stained in PBS with 2% FBS. The following antibodies were used: PD-L1 (BioLegend, 10F.9G2), H-2K b (BioLegend, AF6-88.5), and H-2D b (eBioscience, 28-14-8). 4',6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole Dihydrochloride (DAPI) was used to stain for viability.
For assessment of Tregs in MMTV-PyMT LNs, collection of data was described previously ( Spitzer et al., 2017 100. Spitzer, M.H. ∙ Carmi, Y. ∙ Reticker-Flynn, N.E. ... Systemic immunity is required for effective cancer immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :487-502 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). LNs of untreated mice were evaluated for the presence of Tregs based upon LN status. Positive LNs were defined as samples with >0.5% of cells staining positive for PyMT.
For assessment of NKG2D ligand levels, cell lines were dissociated with Accutase, washed with complete DMEM, resuspended and added to untreated 6-well plates at a concentration of 10 6 cells/well. 4μg of recombinant mouse NKG2D-Fc Chimera (R&D Systems, 139-NK-050) was added per well and incubated at 37°C for 90 min. Cells were then washed and stained with 5μL anti-human IgG Fc (BioLegend, M1310G05) or Rat IgG2a isotype control (BioLegend, RTK2758), DAPI, and run on an LSRFortessa, as above.
MHC-II-Ova tetramer staining was performed using I-A(b) chicken Ova 329-337 AAHAEINEA BV421-Labeled Tetramer or control I-A(b) human CLIP 87-101 PVSKMRMATPLLMQA BV421-Labeled Tetramer (graciously provided by the NIH Tetramer Facility). LN suspensions were resuspended in complete RPMI, split into two wells of a 96 wells plate each, and incubated with 6μg/mL Ova-tetramer or control-tetramer for 90 minutes at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Cells were subsequently washed with FB and subjected to surface staining, fixation and permeabilization, and intracellular staining for FoxP3 as described above.
For broad immunophenotyping analysis of myeloid populations ( Figure 4 ), wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were implanted with 2×10 5 B16-F0 parental cells subcutaneously and 7.5×10 4 LN6-987AL cells were surgically implanted into LNs as described in the “Tumor Line Generation and Transplantation Studies” section, above. LN6 cells were implanted 8 days after subcutaneous injections, and mice were euthanized 5 days after intra-LN injections. Some mice received parental and LN6 tumors (LN+), some received parental tumors and sham LN injections (LN-), and some received no primary and sham LN injections (naïve). LNs were isolated and processed as described above, including digestion with Collagenase 4 for 10 minutes at 37°C. For immunophenotyping of the Braf melanoma GEMM, BRaf CA ;Pten loxP ;Tyr::CreER T2 mice ( Dankort et al., 2009 23. Dankort, D. ∙ Curley, D.P. ∙ Cartlidge, R.A. ... Braf(V600E) cooperates with Pten loss to induce metastatic melanoma Nat. Genet. 2009; 41 :544-552 Crossref Scopus (820) PubMed Google Scholar ) were acquired from Jackson Labs (JAX stock # 013590) and bred in our animal facility. 8-week-old Braf V600E/+ ;Pten loxP/loxP ;Tyr::CreER Tg/+ mice (or control genotypes lacking the mutant Braf or Cre alleles) were administered 20μL of 5mM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma) in DMSO topically. After approximately 10 weeks following induction, mice were euthanized and draining LNs were harvested. LNs were processed for flow cytometry as described above.
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates 24 hours prior to stimulation. Recombinant mouse IFN-α (PBL Assay Science) at a concentration of 1,500 U/mL, recombinant mouse IFN-γ (BioLegend) at a concentration of 50 ng/mL, or both were added to wells and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . For evaluation of MHC-I and PD-L1 expression, cells were stimulated for 24 hours prior to washing and preparing for flow cytometry analysis as described above.
For phospho-Stat experiments, cells were stimulated with the IFNs for 15 minutes at 37°C. Cells were immediately fixed with BD Fixation Buffer (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at 37°C. Cells were washed with FB, dissociated from the tissue culture plates with cell scrapers, and transferred to FACS tubes. Cells were permeabilized with ice cold BD Phosflow Perm Buffer III (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes on ice with vortexing. Cells were washed with FB and stained with pStat antibodies at the concentrations recommended by the manufacturers. Samples were run on a BD LSRFortessa.
FFPE tissue blocks of 79 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were collected by the Stanford Department of Pathology. For each patient without evidence of lymph node metastasis (pathological N stage of N0), tissue from benign lymph nodes was collected. For each patient with lymph node metastases (pathological N stage of N1-N3), tissue from metastatic lymph nodes was collected. Malignancy diagnosis was performed by board-certified surgical pathologist. Tissue microarrays with 1mm diameter cores were assembled and digitized using Leica Aperio whole slide scanner with 40x magnification.
To evaluate immunohistochemistry staining for FOXP3, we first applied Watershed segmentation to detect cells on each of the TMA cores using Python packages of Scikit-image ( van der Walt et al., 2014 109. van der Walt, S. ∙ Schönberger, J.L. ∙ Nunez-Iglesias, J. ... Scikit-image: image processing in Python PeerJ. 2014; 2 :e453 Crossref Scopus (1813) PubMed Google Scholar ) and openCV ( Bradski, 2000 13. Bradski, G. The OpenCV library Dr Dobbs J. 2000; 25 :120-125 Google Scholar ). Next, a staining intensity score for each cell was calculated by averaging pixel intensities of DAB (brown) staining within the nucleus. We defined the threshold that classifies cells into positive and negative groups as k standard deviations above the mean value of the staining intensity scores ( Bankhead et al., 2017 5. Bankhead, P. ∙ Loughrey, M.B. ∙ Fernández, J.A. ... QuPath: open source software for digital pathology image analysis Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 :16878 Crossref Scopus (1306) PubMed Google Scholar ). To find the best value of k , we manually annotated positive cells on regions of interest and assessed the performance of different k values for thresholding. We then classified all the cells into FOXP3 positive or negative based on the appropriate threshold and quantified FOXP3 positive cell percentage for each of the TMA cores.
Total RNA was isolated from the LN8-1205BL cell line using the RNEasy kit (Qiagen) and converted to cDNA with the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). Two rounds of PCR were performed to amplify the Cd274 CDS and add a Kozak sequence and restriction sites. The primers were as follows: PCR1 forward: 5’-GCCACCATGAGGATATTTGCTGGCATTATATTC-3’, PCR1 reverse: 5’-CGGGAATTCTTACGTCTCCTCGAATTGTGTATC-3’, PCR2 forward: 5’- ATTACTAGTGCCGCCACCATGAGGATATTTGC-3’, PCR2 reverse: 5’- TCTAGACCCGGGAATTCTTACGTCTCCTCG-3’. The product was then cloned into the pLVX-EF1a-IRES-Hygro plasmid described above by restriction digest. Lentiviral particle production and viral transduction were performed as described above. Transduced cells were selected in Hygromycin B followed by sorting, as described above. Control cells were transduced with a pLVX vector lacking the Cd274 gene. B16-F0-cntrl or – Cd274 cells were transplanted into wild-type female mice as described above. Mice were euthanized 26 days following cell implantation and LN metastasis incidence was quantified.
Cd274 was knocked out of the LN6-987AL cell line using the lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid ( Sanjana et al., 2014 94. Sanjana, N.E. ∙ Shalem, O. ∙ Zhang, F. Improved vectors and genome-wide libraries for CRISPR screening Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :783-784 Crossref Scopus (2337) PubMed Google Scholar ). lentiCRISPR v2 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 52961). Lentiviral packaging and transduction were performed as described above. All other genes were knocked out by transient transfection with PX458 ( Ran et al., 2013 86. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (5748) PubMed Google Scholar ) followed by FACS sorting for GFP. pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 48138). Following expansion, edited cells were stained for PD-L1 (BioLegend, 10F.9G2) or H-2K b (BioLegend, AF6-88.5) and H-2D b (eBioscience, 28-14-8) and subjected to two rounds of sorting on a FACSAria II (BD). Guide RNAs were designed to minimize off-target effects following previously described approaches ( Doench et al., 2016 26. Doench, J.G. ∙ Fusi, N. ∙ Sullender, M. ... Optimized sgRNA design to maximize activity and minimize off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9 Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :184-191 Crossref Scopus (1550) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hsu et al., 2013 46.

Guide RNA sequences are listed in Table S4 .
FoxP3 EGFP mice ( Haribhai et al., 2007 42. Haribhai, D. ∙ Lin, W. ∙ Relland, L.M. ... Regulatory T cells dynamically control the primary immune response to foreign antigen J. Immunol. 2007; 178 :2961-2972 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) were acquired from Jackson (006772) and bred in our facility at Stanford University. Splenocytes were harvested from tumor-naïve female FoxP3 EGFP mice. Spleens were subjected to mechanical dissociation on 70μm cell strainers and washed with HBSS supplemented with 2% FBS (HBSSF). Erythrocytes were lysed with Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysing buffer. Magnetic isolation of naïve CD4 T cells was performed using the MojoSort Mouse Naïve CD4 T Cell Isolation Kit (BioLegend, 480040) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell suspensions were stained for lineage markers and sorted on a FACSAria II for the GFP - lin - cells. Sorting was performed to ensure no preexisting Tregs (e.g., natural Tregs) remained following magnetic isolation. 3×10 5 lymphocytes were combined with 1.5×10 5 tumor cells (B16-F0, LN6-987AL, or LN8-1198AR) and 3×10 5 anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Thermo) in 100μL of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 15mM HEPES, 14.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1mM Sodium Pyruvate, 1 × MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (Thermo, 11140050), and 4ng/mL hTGF-β1 (Peprotech). CD3/28 stimulation was performed to mimic TCR ligation and antigen recognition. Following 72 hours of culture, cells were washed and stained for analysis by flow cytometry as described above.
Foxp3 DTR mice were acquired from Jackson (016958) and bred in our facility at Stanford University. Eight-week-old female Foxp3 DTR mice were injected with 2 ×10 5 B16-F0 or LN6-987AL cells resuspended in phenol-red free DMEM into their flanks. Mice were administered diphtheria toxin (25mg/kg) or PBS control by intraperitoneal injection on days 7, 8, and 15 following injection of tumor cells. Mice were euthanized on day 23, and LN metastases were quantified.
For lung seeding experiments, 2 ×10 5 LN6-987AL cells were implanted and DT or PBS were administered according to the regimen described above. On day 14 following subcutaneous implantation of the LN6-987AL cells, 2 ×10 5 B16-F0-tdTomato cells were injected intravenously into the lateral tail veins. After 9 additional days, mice were euthanized, and their lungs were harvested and imaged for metastases on a fluorescence dissection microscope as previously described.
OT-I mice were acquired from Jackson (003831) and bred in our facility at Stanford University. Inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs and spleens were harvested from female OT-I mice through mechanical dissociation on 70μm cell strainers and washed with FB. Erythrocytes were lysed with Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium (ACK) lysing buffer. Magnetic isolation of CD8 T cells was performed using the EasySep Mouse CD8 T cell Isolation Kit (StemCell, 19853) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 3×10 5 lymphocytes were combined with 1.5×10 5 tumor cells (B16-F0, LN8-1205BL, B16-F0-Ova, or LN8-1205BL-Ova) in 100μL of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 15mM HEPES, and 14.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After 24 hours of culture, cells were processed for analysis by flow cytometry. Staining and analysis were performed as described in the “Tissue Processing and Flow Cytometry” section for viability (LIVE/DEAD blue), surface (CD45, CD8α, CD69), and intracellular (Granzyme B, IFNγ, and Ki-67) stains.
For differential cytotoxicity studies, B16-F0-Ova and LN8-1205BL-Ova cells were stained with 5μM CellTrace CFSE (Thermo, C34554) and CellTrace Violet (Thermo, C34571), respectively. OT-I CD8 T cells were isolated, as previously described. Labelled B16-F0-Ova and LN8-1205BL-Ova cells were combined at a 1:1 ratio, and 2 × 10 4 total tumor cells were cultured with various ratios of lymphocytes (E:T ranging from 1:1 to 10:1) in 100μL total volume of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 15mM HEPES, 14.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1mM Sodium Pyruvate. After 24 hours of culture, cells were isolated by trypsinization (keeping the supernatant containing the cells in suspension). The LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo, L10119) was used to stain for viability, and the culture was stained for CD8α + cells to help distinguish T cells from tumor cells. Viability was then assessed by flow cytometry where the two tumor types were distinguished by the CellTrace stains.
Cell suspensions of 2×10 5 cells in phenol-red free DMEM were injected into the subcutaneous region of the left flank of eight-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 or OT-I mice following removal of fur with surgical clippers. Tumor growth was monitored Q2D until mice reached euthanasia criteria. The Kaplan-Meier curve denotes the first day at which a tumor was detected in the OT-I mice.
Splenocytes were harvested from C57BL/6J mice as described above. NK cells were purified by magnetic bead separation using the EasySep Mouse NK Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Tumor cells were dissociated in Accutase and resuspended at 2×10 6 cells/mL of HBSS supplemented with 2% FBS (HBSSF) and 5μM Calcein-AM (Life Technologies). Cells were stained for one hour at 37°C followed by washing in HBSSF. NK cells were added to tumor cells at a ratio of 10:1 in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 15mM HEPES, and 14.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and cultured at 37°C for four hours. The plates were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were harvested and read on a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Victor X4). 10% Tween-20 was used as a positive control for 100% lysis, and tumor cells cultured alone were used to measure spontaneous lysis. Specific lysis was calculated as: % 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑐 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 = 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑒 − 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑇 ⁢ 𝑤 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 − 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑠 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑦 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 × 1 0 0
C57BL/6 wild-type female mice were implanted with 2 × 10 5 B16-F0- Cd274 tumor cells into the left flank. The PD-L1 overexpressing variant was used to ensure metastases to LNs would grow to a detectable size. To deplete NK cells, mice were administered 100μg of NK1.1 (Bio-X-Cell, PK136) or isotype control (Bio-X-Cell, C1.18.4) antibodies intraperitoneally once per week beginning two days prior to tumor implantation, and LN metastases were evaluated on day 26. For B2m knockout rescue studies 2 × 10 5 LN6-987AL-sgB2m (or control guide RNA) cells were implanted into the left flank and mice were treated with the same anti-NK1.1 depletion regimen. Mice were euthanized and LNs were quantified on day 30.
Suspensions of 2×10 5 B16-F0 cells in phenol-red free DMEM were injected into the subcutaneous region of the left flank of C57BL/6J female mice following removal of fur with surgical clippers. 9 days later, suspensions of 7.5×10 4 LN6-987AL cells in phenol-red free DMEM were injected directly into the LN following the procedure described in the “In vivo Metastatic Priming (Tail Vein Challenge) Experiments” section above. Control (sham) injections consisted of intra-LN injections of phenol red free DMEM alone. 4 days later, LNs were harvested, dissociated, and leukocytes were FACS sorted from cell suspensions based on staining for CD45. 9×10 5 purified leukocytes were transferred to wild-type tumor-naïve recipients by retro-orbital injection. After 4 additional days, recipient mice were challenged with tail vein injections of B16-F0-tdTomato, and resultant lung metastases were quantified.
For Treg adoptive transfer studies, FoxP3 EGFP mice were implanted with B16-F0 tumors subcutaneously, and LN6-987AL cells (or sham) were injected intra-LN 7 days later, as above. After 5 additional days, LNs were harvested and mechanically dissociated. FoxP3 + Tregs were purified by FACS and transferred to recipient mice by retro-orbital injection. 4 days prior to transfer, recipient mice were implanted with B16-F0 subcutaneous tumors, and 1 day prior to transfer were challenged with tail vein injections of B16-F0-tdTomato cells. 9 days following adoptive Treg transfer, mice were euthanized, and lung metastases were quantified.
For antigen-specific in vivo Treg polarization studies, splenocytes were isolated from CD45.2 OT-II mice (Jackson, 004194) and CD45.2 Dendra2 reporter mice (018397). Naïve CD4 T cells were purified by FACS as CD8b - NK1.1 - CD11b - CD11c - B220 - CD25 - CD44 - CD62L + . Reporter and OT-II naïve CD4 T cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, which was confirmed by flow cytometry prior to adoptive transfer. CD45.1 wild-type recipient mice (Jackson, 002014) were implanted with subcutaneous B16-F0-Ova or LN8-1205BL-Ova tumors two days prior to adoptive transfer. Naïve CD4 T cells were transferred by retro-orbital injection, and after three weeks of tumor growth, mice were euthanized and draining inguinal LNs were harvested. Presence or absence of LN metastases was determined by visual inspection. LNs were mechanically dissociated and processed for MHC-II-Ova-tetramer staining and analysis by flow cytometry, as above.
Tissues were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or 10% buffered formalin. For frozen sections, primary tumors and lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), left in 30% w/v sucrose at 4°C overnight, and embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue-Tek) the following day. Embedded tissues were frozen in isopentane cooled by liquid nitrogen. For paraffin sections, lungs were inflated with 4% PFA or 10% buffered formalin prior to extraction. Tissues were fixed at 4°C followed by transfer to 70% ethanol and subsequent embedding in paraffin.
The human malignant melanoma tissue microarray (US Biomax, ME2082c) was processed in a similar fashion as the paraffin embedded mouse sections. Slides were heated according to the manufacturer’s suggestions and dewaxed in xylene followed by ethanol gradation and antigen retrieval. Following blocking for endogenous enzymes (Agilent, S2003) and non-specific binding (Agilent X0909), slides were stained with anti-PD-L1 antibody (CellSignaling, E1L3N) overnight at 4°C. Following washing, arrays were stained with the ImmPRESS-AP anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase polymer detection kit (Vector Laboratories, MP-5401) and developed with ImmPACT Vector Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate (Vector Laboratories, SK-5101). Arrays were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope with the 555nm laser in the fluorescence mode to enhance specificity of detection from areas with high melanin content. Scoring of PD-L1 staining was performed in a blinded manner where each biopsy was determined to be either positive or negative for PD-L1 staining.
Luminex cytokine profiling of cell culture supernatants and serum from tumor-bearing mice was performed by the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Core using a Luminex 200 instrument. Serum was collected in Terumo Capiject T-MGA gel barrier serum collection tubes following cardiac puncture. All samples were subjected to a 10 minute 14,000RPM spin prior to Luminex analysis to remove cell debris.
All statistical tests were performed with Prism (GraphPad) and are described as follows except where otherwise noted in figure legends. For all figures, ∗ P < 0.05, ∗∗ P < 0.01, ∗∗∗ P < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ P < 0.0001. For most data, replicates are shown as individual points, and where summary data is presented (e.g., transcript levels in human data sets), the number of replicates ( n ) is noted in the figure legends. All comparisons involving more than two groups utilize tests that adjust for multiple comparisons. Unless otherwise noted, effect sizes are depicted as means (by bar height or horizontal line). Comparisons of two conditions (e.g., LN or lung metastasis incidence, size, etc.) were evaluated using the Two-Tailed Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) unless otherwise noted. Comparisons of three or more conditions (e.g., CRISPR knockouts, flow cytometry percentages/counts, depletion studies, etc.) were performed using a One-Way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Longitudinal studies (e.g., tumor growth) were performed with a Two-Way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test. Comparisons of categorical variables were performed with Fisher’s Exact Test. Comparisons of LN metastasis incidence between the various LN lines and the parental were performed using a One-Way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (comparing each group to the parental). Comparisons of Treg induction and NK cytotoxicity in vitro were evaluated using a two-tailed paired student’s t test (where pairing was performed between T cells from the same mouse). Human TMA PD-L1 positivity was compared by Fisher’s Exact Test. Human TCGA statistics were calculated in R using the FSA package (v.0.8.20) using the Dunn Kruskal-Wallis test with p -values adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm method. Tumor growth curves were compared by Two-Way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test. ATAC-seq TF motif P -values were calculated with HOMER. Flow cytometry data depicting different leukocyte subsets from the same experimental setup were typically generated from the same panel and experiment except where channel availability required additional panels or multiple experiments to be performed. Graphs of different cytokine levels measured by Luminex were also generated from one set of samples (assayed for multiple cytokines at once). In all other instances, data were generated from distinct experiments and the same samples were not measured for distinct experiments. Treg fractions in MMTV-PyMT mice were determined from reanalysis of our previously published data sets ( Spitzer et al., 2017 100. Spitzer, M.H. ∙ Carmi, Y. ∙ Reticker-Flynn, N.E. ... Systemic immunity is required for effective cancer immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :487-502 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data shown in the manuscript are representative of multiple independent experiments with the exception of RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, WES, and scRNA-seq data where all collected data and replicates are shown.
