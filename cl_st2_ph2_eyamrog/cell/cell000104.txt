Title: Microbiota-Induced Type I Interferons Instruct a Poised Basal State of Dendritic Cells


Abstract: Summary

Environmental signals shape host physiology and fitness. Microbiota-derived cues are required to program conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) during the steady state so that they can promptly respond and initiate adaptive immune responses when encountering pathogens. However, the molecular underpinnings of microbiota-guided instructive programs are not well understood. Here, we report that the indigenous microbiota controls constitutive production of type I interferons (IFN-I) by plasmacytoid DCs. Using genome-wide analysis of transcriptional and epigenetic regulomes of cDCs from germ-free and IFN-I receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice, we found that tonic IFNAR signaling instructs a specific epigenomic and metabolic basal state that poises cDCs for future pathogen combat. However, such beneficial biological function comes with a trade-off. Instructed cDCs can prime T cell responses against harmless peripheral antigens when removing roadblocks of peripheral tolerance. Our data provide fresh insights into the evolutionary trade-offs that come with successful adaptation of vertebrates to their microbial environment.

Section: Introduction

Border surfaces of multicellular organisms are colonized by a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively referred to as the microbiota ( Blander et al., 2017; Hooper and Macpherson, 2010 7.

Microbiota-controlled signaling pathways affect various aspects of host physiology and fitness. For example, we and others have shown that signals of the microbiota are required to calibrate the function of a broad range of mononuclear phagocytes (MPhs), including those residing at non-mucosal sites, such as in spleen, lymph nodes (LNs), and brain. MPhs and microglia of germ-free (GF) mice were unable to produce various cytokines and chemokines upon stimulation, rendering them more susceptible to virus infections ( Abt et al., 2012; Erny et al., 2015; Ganal et al., 2012; Ichinohe et al., 2011 1.

USA. 2011; 108 :5354-5359 Crossref Scopus (1158) PubMed Google Scholar ). On a mechanistic level, signals from the microbiota were needed to remove a chromatin barrier required for the transcription of immune defense genes after ligation of pathogen sensors (e.g., pattern recognition receptors [PRRs] such as Toll-like receptors). Thus, microbiota-generated signals are required to instruct MPhs during the steady state for future immune defense functions. We refer to such a poised state of MPhs as their basal state. The nature of the microbiota-guided signals and the molecular programs that they control in MPhs to establish such a poised state are poorly understood.
Dendritic cells are a subset of MPhs and are subdivided into plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). pDCs can produce high levels of type I interferons (IFN-Is) following virus infections and have been linked to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases ( Reizis, 2019 62. Reizis, B. Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells: Development, Regulation, and Function Immunity. 2019; 50 :37-50 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (385) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDCs fulfill critical and non-redundant functions in regulating and inducing T cell ( Liu et al., 2007; Probst et al., 2014 42.

Probst, H.C. ∙ Muth, S. ∙ Schild, H. Regulation of the tolerogenic function of steady-state DCs Eur. J. Immunol. 2014; 44 :927-933 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) and natural killer (NK) cell responses ( Lucas et al., 2007 44. Lucas, M. ∙ Schachterle, W. ∙ Oberle, K. ... Dendritic cells prime natural killer cells by trans-presenting interleukin 15 Immunity. 2007; 26 :503-517 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ). During an infection, cDCs located at the pathogen entry site take up antigens and transport them to the draining LNs. cDCs are equipped with a plethora of PRRs, the ligation of which leads to cDC activation, cDC maturation (i.e., upregulation of major histocompatibility complexes [MHCs] and co-stimulatory molecules), and the release of inflammatory mediators. By providing all three signals for potent T cell priming, cDCs efficiently translate pathogen recognition by the innate immune system into highly antigen (Ag)-specific adaptive immunity ( Janeway, 1989 33. Janeway, Jr., C.A. Approaching the asymptote? Evolution and revolution in immunology Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54 :1-13 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The benefits of adaptive immunity in vertebrates have come with a substantial trade-off, comprising unwanted immune responses to autoantigens and ubiquitous components of the environment. Numerous mechanisms operating within the mammalian immune system cooperatively form a barrier to such deleterious immune responses, referred to as peripheral tolerance. For example, at the immunological steady state, Ag presentation by cDCs induces T cell tolerance to avoid unwanted immune responses against “self” or against harmless, environmental Ag ( Bonifaz et al., 2002; Hawiger et al., 2001; Probst et al., 2003 9.

Inducible transgenic mice reveal resting dendritic cells as potent inducers of CD8+ T cell tolerance Immunity. 2003; 18 :713-720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, despite low level expression of co-stimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resting cDCs can prime CD8 + T cells, when components of the peripheral tolerance machinery are removed ( Muth et al., 2012; Schildknecht et al., 2010 51.

USA. 2010; 107 :199-203 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). The signals and molecular networks instructing the basal state of cDCs are largely unknown but have broad ramifications for the pathophysiology and treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.
We set out to interrogate on a molecular level the impact of the commensal microbiota on the basal state of cDCs. Using genome-wide profiling of cDCs, we demonstrate that microbiota-controlled IFN-I production by pDCs controlled a distinct transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic basal state of cDCs, enabling them to provide a powerful response following pathogen encounter, but at the same time, also permitting priming of unwanted T cell responses at the steady state. The IFN-I-instructed metabolic basal state of cDCs was characterized by enhanced mitochondrial function, and cDCs genetically deficient for the IFNAR were unfit to prime T cells even if cDCs were directly activated.

Section: Results

Previous studies had revealed functional incompetence of cDCs in GF mice during immune responses against viruses ( Abt et al., 2012; Ganal et al., 2012; Ichinohe et al., 2011 1. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Ganal, S.C. ∙ Sanos, S.L. ∙ Kallfass, C. ... Priming of natural killer cells by nonmucosal mononuclear phagocytes requires instructive signals from commensal microbiota Immunity. 2012; 37 :171-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Ichinohe, T. ∙ Pang, I.K. ∙ Kumamoto, Y. ... Microbiota regulates immune defense against respiratory tract influenza A virus infection Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :5354-5359 Crossref Scopus (1158) PubMed Google Scholar ). In particular, the production of various inflammatory cytokines was reduced. In extension of these data, we now show that, both splenic cDC1 and cDC2 from GF mice were profoundly unresponsive to direct stimulation with CD40 antibodies ( Figures 1 A–1C). This unresponsiveness is not limited to splenic cDCs, because we found very low levels of serum cytokines in GF mice after anti-CD40 treatment ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Mice are colonized with an increasingly complex microbiota during the first weeks of life ( Hooper et al., 2012 29. Hooper, L.V. ∙ Littman, D.R. ∙ Macpherson, A.J. Interactions between the microbiota and the immune system Science. 2012; 336 :1268-1273 Crossref Scopus (3160) PubMed Google Scholar ), and splenic cDCs from 3- and 4-week-old mice were impaired in their tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-12 ( Figures S1 C and S1D) responses when compared to cDCs from adult mice.
Using a transgenic mouse model (dubbed DIETER) allowing for the tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible expression of class I MHC-restricted CD8 + T cell epitopes specifically on cDCs ( Probst et al., 2003 58. Probst, H.C. ∙ Lagnel, J. ∙ Kollias, G. ... Inducible transgenic mice reveal resting dendritic cells as potent inducers of CD8+ T cell tolerance Immunity. 2003; 18 :713-720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ), we had previously shown that Ag presentation on cDCs at steady state resulted in spontaneous priming of CD8 + T cells, when barriers of peripheral tolerance were removed (i.e., CD4 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells, or all CD4 + T cells) ( Muth et al., 2012 51. Muth, S. ∙ Schütze, K. ∙ Schild, H. ... Release of dendritic cells from cognate CD4+ T-cell recognition results in impaired peripheral tolerance and fatal cytotoxic T-cell mediated autoimmunity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :9059-9064 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate if such cDC activity is also instructed by signals from the microbiota, we treated DIETER mice with antibiotics (ABX) depleting them of culturable bacteria ( Figure S1 E). As expected, induction of Ag expression on cDCs, after depletion of CD4 + T cells, led to robust expansion of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells, which was significantly diminished in ABX-treated mice ( Figure 1 D). The data indicate that signals from the commensal microbiota instructs a basal cDC state that allows for powerful cytokine responses following microbe recognition. However, such basal state is also permissive for priming of CD8 + T cells against harmless antigens, an activity that is normally blunted by barriers of peripheral tolerance.
GF mice lack all components of the microbiota. We investigated if colonization of GF mice with bacterial consortia of increasing complexity was sufficient to normalize cDC responsiveness. Mono-colonization of GF mice with one gram-negative bacterium ( Escherichia [ E. ] coli JM83) ( Hapfelmeier et al., 2010 25. Hapfelmeier, S. ∙ Lawson, M.A. ∙ Slack, E. ... Reversible microbial colonization of germ-free mice reveals the dynamics of IgA immune responses Science. 2010; 328 :1705-1709 Crossref Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar ) led to a reproducible increase in TNF production by cDCs in response to poly(I:C) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Colonization with a stable model microbiota (referred to as sDMDMm2), consisting of 12 defined bacterial species representing five major prokaryote phyla of gut microbial communities ( Uchimura et al., 2016 79. Uchimura, Y. ∙ Wyss, M. ∙ Brugiroux, S. ... Complete Genome Sequences of 12 Species of Stable Defined Moderately Diverse Mouse Microbiota 2 Genome Announc. 2016; 4 :e00951-16 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), normalized cDC responses to LPS ( Figure 1 F), and significantly increased responsiveness to poly(I:C) ( Figure 1 E). Similar results were obtained when analyzing systemic TNF or IFN-I levels ( Figures S1 F–S1I). While the data do not exclude that other components of the microbiota may generate signals that prime cDC (and likely broader MPh) function, re-colonization of GF mice with bacterial consortia of increasing complexity progressively restored cDC responsiveness to microbial stimulation.
We wondered if functional priming of cDCs would require sensing of commensal microbes via PRRs. To this end, we employed Myd88 −/− Trif −/− Cardif −/− ( MyTrCa −/− ) mice lacking three major adaptors of the microbe sensing machinery and directly stimulated cDCs via CD40 that activates cDCs independent of these PRR adaptors. MyD88 and TRIF are required for TLR signaling, and CARDIF transduces signals from the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 ( Broz and Monack, 2013; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010 11. Broz, P. ∙ Monack, D.M. Newly described pattern recognition receptors team up against intracellular pathogens Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :551-565 Crossref Scopus (368) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Takeuchi, O. ∙ Akira, S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation Cell. 2010; 140 :805-820 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6694) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDC1 and cDC2 from mice lacking all three adaptor proteins ( MyTrCa −/− mice) ( Spanier et al., 2014 71. Spanier, J. ∙ Lienenklaus, S. ∙ Paijo, J. ... Concomitant TLR/RLH signaling of radioresistant and radiosensitive cells is essential for protection against vesicular stomatitis virus infection J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :3045-3054 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ) were largely unresponsive to CD40 stimulation, comparable to GF mice ( Figures 1 A–1C). Interestingly, serum levels of TNF and IFN-I were also substantially reduced after systemic CD40 stimulation ( Figures S1 A and S1B). In contrast, cDC responses in MyTr −/− double knockout mice and in Cardif −/− mice were not significantly impaired ( Figures 1 A–1C, S1 A, and S1B).
Does programming of the cDCs basal state by the microbiota require direct “sensing” of commensal microbial components by cDCs? To explore this, we created mixed bone marrow chimeras by reconstituting lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with an equal mixture of MyTrCa −/− DIETER (CD45.2) and wild-type (CD45.1) bone marrow, so that only model Ag-expressing cDCs were MyTrCa −/− . MyTrCa +/+ DIETER (CD45.2) and wild-type (CD45.1) mixed chimeras were used as controls. Upon depletion of CD4 + T cells, induction of Ag presentation on both sets of chimeras led to comparable priming of functional GP 33–41 -specific CD8 + T cells ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Thus, direct sensing of commensal microbial molecules by cDCs is not required for their steady-state calibration.
We next asked if PRR signaling is required at all for priming of CD8 + T cells at the steady state. We generated DIETER mice lacking PRR signaling on all cells by injecting lethally irradiated MyTrCa −/− mice with bone marrow from MyTrCa −/− DIETER mice. In these mice, CD8 + T cell priming upon antigen induction and CD4 + T cell depletion was strongly reduced ( Figure 1 I). In control chimeras, priming of MyTrCa −/− and MyTrCa +/+ CD8 + T cells was comparable, excluding that the impaired expansion of CD8 + T cells in MyTrCa −/− mice was due to direct signals through these adaptors in T cells ( Figure S1 J). Thus, functional calibration of cDCs during steady state requires recognition of commensal microorganisms through PRRs utilizing MyD88, TRIF, and/or CARDIF on cells other than cDCs.
To obtain insights into microbiota-controlled transcriptional circuits, we performed genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis using RNA isolated from unstimulated splenic cDCs of specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and GF mice ( Figure S2 A). Gene Ontology (GO) term clustering of the top 100 differentially expressed genes that were most significantly changed between GF and SPF mice contained functional annotations for cytokine responses. Among the genes included in the GO term “Response to Cytokines” were various transcripts associated with IFN-I signaling (e.g., Oas2 , Socs2 , Itga6 , Itgav , Ifi35 , Ifi205 , Ifitm1 , and Il15 ) that were less expressed by cDCs from GF mice. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed that genes transcriptionally controlled by IFN-I (i.e., interferon-stimulated genes [ISGs]) ( Figures 2 A and S2 B) and by STAT1 (i.e., the major signal transducer downstream of the IFNAR) ( Figures S2 C and S2D) were expressed at lower levels in cDCs from GF mice, consistent with previous data showing reduced expression of ISGs in peritoneal macrophages and in microglia isolated from GF mice ( Abt et al., 2012; Erny et al., 2015 1. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar 18. Erny, D. ∙ Hrabě de Angelis, A.L. ∙ Jaitin, D. ... Host microbiota constantly control maturation and function of microglia in the CNS Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18 :965-977 Crossref Scopus (2302) PubMed Google Scholar ). qRT-PCR experiments confirmed that splenic cDCs isolated from GF mice expressed significantly lower levels of selected ISGs at steady state ( Figure 2 B). cDCs from GF mice have a significantly reduced cellular pool of phosphorylated STAT1 at steady state when compared to SPF mice ( Figure 2 C). The data demonstrate that IFN-I-driven steady-state STAT1 signaling is downregulated in cDCs from GF mice.
It has long been recognized that low levels of IFN-I are continuously produced in normal SPF laboratory mice ( Bocci, 1980; Gough et al., 2012; Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001 8. Bocci, V. Is interferon produced in physiologic conditions? Med. Hypotheses. 1980; 6 :735-745 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Gough, D.J. ∙ Messina, N.L. ∙ Clarke, C.J. ... Constitutive type I interferon modulates homeostatic balance through tonic signaling Immunity. 2012; 36 :166-174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Taniguchi, T. ∙ Takaoka, A. A weak signal for strong responses: interferon-alpha/beta revisited Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2 :378-386 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Steady-state IFN-I production has been notoriously difficult to analyze because of the very small amounts produced. IFN-β luciferase reporter mice faithfully report steady-state expression of IFN-β ( Lienenklaus et al., 2009 41. Lienenklaus, S. ∙ Cornitescu, M. ∙ Zietara, N. ... Novel reporter mouse reveals constitutive and inflammatory expression of IFN-beta in vivo J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :3229-3236 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), which was significantly reduced in GF reporter mice ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Interestingly, steady-state IFN-β levels in spleen and peripheral (p)LNs were comparable to mucosa-associated lymphoid organs such as mesenteric (mes)LNs and Peyer’s patches (PPs) ( Figure 2 F). To identify the cellular sources of IFN-β, we purified the various splenic immune and stroma cells from reporter mice ( Figure S2 E). Strikingly, only pDCs, and to a small extent Ly6C high monocytes, contributed to the steady-state IFN-β signal ( Figures 2 G–2I). In contrast to pDCs, cDCs did not express IFN-I genes at steady state ( Figures 2 G–2I), which was confirmed by interrogation of our genome-wide datasets ( Figure S2 F). Importantly, Ifnb1 expression was significantly reduced in pDCs isolated from GF mice ( Figure 2 J). Collectively, we identified pDCs as the main producers of steady-state IFN-I in response to signals from the microbiota.
We hypothesized that sensing of commensal microbes via PRRs is translated into constitutive IFN-I expression by pDCs. We generated IFN-β reporter mice lacking adaptor proteins for PRRs. Consistent with impaired cDC function observed in MyTrCa −/− mice ( Figures 1 A–1C and G–I), we observed a dramatic reduction in steady-state IFN-β expression ( Figure 2 K). Interestingly, depletion of IFN-I-producing pDCs significantly reduced the propensity of cDC to prime CD8 + T cells at steady state ( Figures 2 L and S2 G). Collectively, the results from genome-wide transcriptional profiling, biochemical data, and reporter assays show that the microbiota controls steady-state expression of IFN-I by pDCs likely involving redundant PRR signaling ( Figure 2 K). cDCs from GF or from pDC-depleted mice show a remarkable absence of an IFN-I-controlled gene expression signature and are functionally impaired.
Our data indicate that microbiota-controlled, tonic IFN-I produced by pDCs may be the molecular link between the microbiota and the poised cDC basal state. We extended our genome-wide data by comparing full, steady-state transcriptomes of splenic cDCs isolated from SPF mice, from mice genetically deficient for the α chain of the IFN-I receptor ( Ifnar1 −/− [SPF] mice), and from GF mice. Pearson correlation ( Figure 3 A) and principal component analysis ( Figure 3 B) indicated that cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice have rather similar transcriptomes that are noticeably different from control cDCs. K-means clustering of differentially expressed genes (false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05) revealed that their majority can be found in clusters (i.e., clusters C1 and C6) markedly increased or decreased expression in both GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs compared to control cDCs ( Figure 3 C). Among the most differentially expressed genes in cluster C1, we found several canonical ISGs ( Figures 3 D and S3 A). GSEA analysis for selected interferon-related gene sets revealed a negative correlation for both GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs ( Figure 3 E). Interestingly, genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation including genes encoded within the mitochondrial genome were consistently downregulated in cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice ( Figure 3 F).
Splenic cDCs can be divided into two main subpopulations, cDC1 and cDC2, which have been reported to be transcriptionally distinct ( Merad et al., 2013 47. Merad, M. ∙ Sathe, P. ∙ Helft, J. ... The dendritic cell lineage: ontogeny and function of dendritic cells and their subsets in the steady state and the inflamed setting Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31 :563-604 Crossref Scopus (1742) PubMed Google Scholar ). We obtained transcriptome data from cDC1 and cDC2 from SPF, GF, and Ifnar1 −/− mice. Pearson correlation analysis confirmed that cDC1 and cDC2 transcriptomes are distinctly different ( Figure 4 A). We focused our analysis first on cDC2, because they comprise 80%–90% of all splenic cDCs. Principal-component analysis (PCA) clearly separated the transcriptomes of GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDC2 from that of control SPF cDC2 in PC2 ( Figure 4 B). GO analysis of GO terms with a gene set size from 10 to 1,000 genes classified as biological processes using DAVID revealed that 43 GO terms were enriched at an FDR <0.05 in control cDC2 compared to GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDC2 ( Table S1 ). Next, we created an enrichment map where the GO terms were clustered according to overlap of genes ( Figure 4 C). Although separate clusters could be identified, when the edge cutoff was set to 1, the cluster remained highly interconnected and enriched very similar immunological processes, including two smaller clusters containing IFN-I signaling and function-related GO terms ( Figure 4 C). This consistent enrichment is caused by more than 35% (81/222) of the genes consistently downregulated in GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDC2, where almost 20% (47/222) is represented in more than 5 different GO terms. Thus, a significant proportion of genes consistently downregulated in GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDC2 is part of the same immunological process, IFN-I signaling, and function. Using GSEA, in which no prior definition of gene sets is required, we again found a clear negative correlation for selected IFN-I-related gene sets for cDC2 from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice ( Figure 4 D, dotted lines).
Such negative correlation in IFN-I-controlled gene sets was obvious also for the comparison of control SPF and Ifnar1 −/− cDC1 ( Figure 4 D). While a negative correlation in GSEA of IFN-I-controlled pathways was not directly evident for cDC1 from GF mice ( Figure 4 D), it was clearly observed in other, related gene sets such as “Interferon Signaling,” “Interferon Gamma Response,” and “Interferon Gamma Signaling” ( Figure S4 A). In fact, the genes contained in IFN-γ and IFN-I-controlled gene sets contain many of the same genes and therefore do not strictly discriminate between IFN-I and IFN-γ-controlled genes ( Figure S4 B). Given this overlap, we were wondering why some interferon-related gene sets enriched in cDC2 but not in cDC1. Part of the reason might relate to the fact that a high fraction of the genes within these gene sets enriched in SPF cDC2 were expressed at much lower levels in SPF cDC1 ( Figure S4 C) and therefore simply cannot be dramatically downregulated. Collectively, our genome-wide transcriptional profile demonstrated that the most significantly downregulated gene sets in cDC1 and cDC2 from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice are those related to IFN-I signaling.
It has been previously postulated that low levels of IFN-I signals during the steady state may be required for responsiveness of the MPh system ( Gough et al., 2012; Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001 24. Gough, D.J. ∙ Messina, N.L. ∙ Clarke, C.J. ... Constitutive type I interferon modulates homeostatic balance through tonic signaling Immunity. 2012; 36 :166-174 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Taniguchi, T. ∙ Takaoka, A. A weak signal for strong responses: interferon-alpha/beta revisited Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2 :378-386 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). To link steady-state IFN-I to cDC function and to obtain a global understanding of genes that are not upregulated in cDCs from GF or Ifnar1 −/− mice following a microbial stimulus, we compared RNA-seq data from LPS-stimulated cDCs isolated from GF, Ifnar1 −/− , and control SPF mice. Genes that were significantly less upregulated in cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice ( Figure S5 A, marked in red) were submitted to DAVID. Among the top resulting GO terms were “Immune System Process” (p < 2.1e−2) and “Leukocyte Activation” (p < 9.5e−2). GSEA revealed a failure to upregulate the expression of most ISGs and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target genes in cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice after LPS stimulation ( Figures 5 A, S5 B, and S5C). These data link tonic IFN-I signaling during the steady state to a poised cDC state required for effective transcription of ISGs and NF-κB target genes following microbial stimulation.
In line with our genome-wide data, stimulated cDCs from Ifnar1 −/− and GF mice produced significantly less TNF, an NF-κB target gene ( Figure 5 B). Similar results were obtained for serum levels of TNF ( Figure S5 D). Such calibration of cDC responsiveness specifically required tonic IFN-I signaling because cDCs deprived of type II ( Ifngr −/− mice) or type III IFN signaling ( Ifnlr1 −/− mice) responded normally ( Figure S5 E). To exclude that alterations in microbiota composition in Ifnar1 −/− mice were causative for the observed functional differences, we investigated cDC responses in co-housed Ifnar1 +/+ , Ifnar1 +/− , and Ifnar1 −/− littermates from heterozygous breedings. Only cDCs from co-housed Ifnar1 −/− mice showed reduced responsiveness to stimulation ( Figures 5 C and S5 F–S5I). The data largely exclude that altered microbiota in Ifnar1 −/− mice is causative for the observed functional differences between cDCs from Ifnar1 −/− and control mice.
While these data link tonic IFN-I to a poised cDC state, they do not directly demonstrate that IFN-I acted on cDCs because of global IFNAR deficiency in Ifnar1 −/− mice. We generated mice with cDC-specific IFNAR deficiency by crossing Ifnar1 fl/fl mice to Cd11c (Itgax) -Cre mice ( Ifnar1 ΔDC ). Indeed, cDCs from Ifnar1 ΔDC mice did not mount an appreciable TNF response to stimulation ( Figures 5 D and S5 J). Of note, Cd11c -Cre targets virtually all mature cDCs in spleen and LNs, whereas only a small fraction of cDC precursors are affected ( Caton et al., 2007 12. Caton, M.L. ∙ Smith-Raska, M.R. ∙ Reizis, B. Notch-RBP-J signaling controls the homeostasis of CD8- dendritic cells in the spleen J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204 :1653-1664 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data demonstrate that mature cDCs require a tonic IFN-I signal provided by pDCs for functional calibration, largely ruling out a dominant effect of IFN-I on cDC precursors that are not or very inefficiently targeted in Ifnar1 ΔDC mice.
Although our data show that both cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice cannot respond to microbial stimulation, they do not directly proof that the lack of tonic IFN-I signaling is causally linked to the GF phenotype. We addressed this by an array of experiments. First, we generated Ifnar1 −/− (GF) mice and compared cDC responsiveness to microbial stimulation in GF and Ifnar1 −/− (SPF) mice. Interestingly, cDCs from Ifnar1 −/− (GF) mice showed no further reduction in TNF production ( Figures 5 E and 5F) or IFN-I expression ( Figures S5 K and S5L) when compared to cDCs from GF or Ifnar1 −/− (SPF) mice, arguing that the signals lacking in GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice are linked rather than separately acting. Second, to directly demonstrate that low levels of steady-state IFN-I are required and sufficient to calibrate cDC responsiveness, we injected low doses of IFN-β into ABX-treated mice. IFN-β injections alone did not trigger any TNF release ( Figure 5 G). While cDCs from ABX-treated mice were unable to produce TNF after stimulation in vivo , cDCs from ABX-treated mice injected with low-dose IFN-β produced normal TNF levels ( Figure 5 G). These data causally link tonic IFN-I signaling to the calibration of a poised cDC basal state.
We wondered whether the propensity of cDCs to prime CD8 + T cells during steady state may also be controlled by pDC-produced IFN-I. To address whether IFNAR signaling is required in the Ag-presenting cDC itself or if a lack of IFNAR in bystander cells dominantly inhibits cDC function in trans , we generated three sets of mixed bone marrow chimeric mice by reconstituting lethally irradiated wild-type hosts with an equal mixture of bone marrow cells from (1) Ifnar1 −/− DIETER (CD45.2) and Ifnar1 +/+ (CD45.1) mice (restricting IFNAR deficiency to Ag-presenting cDCs), (2) Ifnar1 +/+ DIETER (CD45.2) and Ifnar1 −/− (CD45.1) (restricting IFNAR deficiency to cDCs that cannot present the model Ag), and (3) of Ifnar1 +/+ DIETER (CD45.2) and Ifnar1 +/+ mice (CD45.1) (as controls). Inducing Ag presentation on Ifnar1 +/+ cDCs after depletion of CD4 + T cells led to robust priming of functional, IFN-γ-producing CD8 + T cells, regardless of the IFNAR status of bystander cells ( Figures 6 A and 6B). In these chimeras, primed CD8 + T cells were derived in equal proportions from IFNAR-proficient and -deficient T cells, suggesting that direct IFN-I signals to CD8 + T cells are not necessary for T cell priming ( Figure S6 A). Strikingly, priming of CD8 + T cells was absent when IFNAR-deficiency was restricted to Ag-presenting DIETER cDCs ( Figures 6 A and 6B). These data demonstrate that tonic IFN-I produced by pDCs act in cis on the Ag-presenting cDC to program a basal state permissive for the priming of T cells at steady state.
To directly link tonic IFN-I signaling in cDCs to the reduced priming of CD8 + T cells in GF mice, we injected ABX-treated DIETER mice with low doses of IFN-β. ABX-treated DIETER mice that received low-dose IFN-β showed expansion of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells to an extent similar to mice that did not receive ABX treatment ( Figure 6 C). Importantly, injection of IFN-β could not rescue T cell priming in chimeras where IFNAR deficiency was restricted to model Ag-presenting cDCs ( Figure S6 B). We wondered whether the depletion of CD4 + T cells is linked to higher expression of IFN-I, but we did not find any upregulation of IFN-β reporter activity ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Thus, tonic IFN-I signaling in cis is required and sufficient to program a poised cDC state permissive for the priming of CD8 + T cells at steady state.
It has recently been described that splenic cDCs isolated from Ifnar1 −/− mice have an impaired Ag-presentation capacity ( Zietara et al., 2009 85. Zietara, N. ∙ Łyszkiewicz, M. ∙ Gekara, N. ... Absence of IFN-beta impairs antigen presentation capacity of splenic dendritic cells via down-regulation of heat shock protein 70 J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :1099-1109 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). We quantified the amount of LCMV GP 33–41 peptide presented on cDCs isolated from the spleen of Ifnar1 +/+ DIETER or Ifnar1 −/− DIETER mice using P14 TCR transgenic mice (recognizing GP 33–41 when presented on H2-D b ) bred to Nur77 GFP reporter mice. T cells from Nur77 GFP mice express GFP proportional to the strength of TCR ligation and therefore faithfully report the number of MHC-I:peptide complexes encountered on Ag-presenting cells ( Moran et al., 2011 49. Moran, A.E. ∙ Holzapfel, K.L. ∙ Xing, Y. ... T cell receptor signal strength in Treg and iNKT cell development demonstrated by a novel fluorescent reporter mouse J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1279-1289 Crossref Scopus (775) PubMed Google Scholar ). No difference in reporter gene expression in P14 T cells stimulated by Ifnar1 +/+ DIETER or Ifnar1 −/− DIETER cDCs was detected, demonstrating that the lack of priming of CD8 + T cells by steady-state cDCs is not due to reduced Ag presentation ( Figure S6 E). We wondered if other genes associated with T cell activation (i.e., co-stimulatory molecules or NF-κB regulators) ( Probst et al., 2014 59. Probst, H.C. ∙ Muth, S. ∙ Schild, H. Regulation of the tolerogenic function of steady-state DCs Eur. J. Immunol. 2014; 44 :927-933 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ) were altered in expression in GF or Ifnar1 −/− cDCs, but we did not find significant changes in expression of such genes in cDC1 and cDC2 ( Figure 6 D). Verification by flow cytometry did also not reveal any robust differences in line with a previous report ( Chinen et al., 2010 14. Chinen, T. ∙ Volchkov, P.Y. ∙ Chervonsky, A.V. ... A critical role for regulatory T cell-mediated control of inflammation in the absence of commensal microbiota J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207 :2323-2330 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the decreased priming of CD8 + T cells by Ag-presenting cDCs deprived of IFN-I signals cannot be simply explained by a reduction in “signal 1” or “signal 2.”
Ligation of CD40 is a strong activating stimulus for cDCs, which is illustrated by the induction of a strong CD8 + T cell response in DIETER mice without the need to deplete CD4 + T cells ( Probst et al., 2003 58. Probst, H.C. ∙ Lagnel, J. ∙ Kollias, G. ... Inducible transgenic mice reveal resting dendritic cells as potent inducers of CD8+ T cell tolerance Immunity. 2003; 18 :713-720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). We wondered if the profound inability of cDCs in Ifnar1 −/− DIETER mice to prime Ag-specific CD8 + T cells at the steady state could be overcome by direct triggering of CD40 on cDCs. We generated two sets of mixed bone marrow chimeric mice. Irradiated wild-type mice were reconstituted with an equal mixture of bone marrow from wild-type mice (CD45.1) and (1) from Ifnar1 +/+ DIETER (CD45.2), or (2) from Ifnar1 −/− DIETER mice (CD45.2). In these chimeras, wild-type (CD45.1) cDCs (and other MPhs) will be able to unleash the full inflammatory program (“signal 3”) induced by CD40 ligation. While CD40 ligation led to a profound priming of Ag-specific CD8 + T cells in Ifnar1 +/+ DIETER:wild-type chimeras, we found virtually no expansion of CD8 + T cells in Ifnar1 −/− DIETER:wild-type chimeras ( Figure 6 E). These surprising data demonstrate a crucial need for microbiota-dependent IFN-I signaling in cDCs during steady state for the programming of a basal cDC regulome, the lack of which cannot be simply overcome by direct triggering of cDCs and concurrent provision of inflammatory cytokines unleashed by CD40 stimulation.
It was striking that the deprivation of cDCs from tonic IFN-I signals could not be overcome by direct stimulation in an inflammatory environment. We had previously shown that microbiota affects chromatin states of cDCs ( Ganal et al., 2012 22. Ganal, S.C. ∙ Sanos, S.L. ∙ Kallfass, C. ... Priming of natural killer cells by nonmucosal mononuclear phagocytes requires instructive signals from commensal microbiota Immunity. 2012; 37 :171-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) for H3K4me3 (marking all transcriptionally active and poised genes) ( Santos-Rosa et al., 2002 65. Santos-Rosa, H. ∙ Schneider, R. ∙ Bannister, A.J. ... Active genes are tri-methylated at K4 of histone H3 Nature. 2002; 419 :407-411 Crossref Scopus (1697) PubMed Google Scholar ) and H3K27me3 (a major mark of transcriptionally inactive genes) ( Schwartz and Pirrotta, 2007 68. Schwartz, Y.B. ∙ Pirrotta, V. Polycomb silencing mechanisms and the management of genomic programmes Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8 :9-22 Crossref Scopus (734) PubMed Google Scholar ) using chromatin from GF, Ifnar1 −/− , and control SPF cDCs isolated at steady state. H3K4me3 peaks present in control (SPF) cDCs were missing on 274 genes of GF cDCs and on 308 genes of Ifnar1 −/− cDCs. Of these genes lacking H3K4me3, 63% (174) were common to cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice. PCA based on the genome-wide peak intensities revealed that the overall H3K4me3 pattern observed in GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs was more similar than when these were compared to control mice ( Figures 7 A and S7 A). To obtain an understanding of the functional annotations of genes that were marked with H3K4me3 in control mice, but not in GF or Ifnar1 −/− mice ( Figure 7 B, marked in red), we submitted these genes to DAVID for GO term enrichment analysis that returned GO terms related to immune responses ( Figure 7 C), including various IFN-I genes, chemokines, and antimicrobial proteins ( Table S2 ). By directly analyzing overall H3K4me3 occupancy at all ISG promoters ( Figure 7 D) and marking with H3K4me3 on specific ISG promoters ( Figure S7 B), we identified a significant reduction, consistent with the reduced steady-state expression of ISGs in GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs. Collectively, the genome-wide data from H3K4me3 ChIP-seq further supported our model that microbiota-driven, steady-state IFN-I signals are an important component of the machinery instructing the poised basal state of cDCs.
We next focused on H3K27me3, a principal inhibitory mark associated with heterochromatin, and submitted the top 1,000 differentially H3K27me3-marked genes common to GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs for DAVID pathway analysis. In line with our transcriptional data ( Figure 3 F), genes associated with mitochondrial (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, and TCA cycle), cytosolic (e.g., glycolysis), and nuclear metabolic processes (e.g., PPAR signaling) were enriched for the inhibitory H3K27me3 mark in GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs ( Figure 7 E).
To obtain insights into metabolic function of cDCs from GF or Ifnar1 −/− mice, we analyzed the mitochondrial membrane potential using MitoTracker Red CMXRos, a cell permeable probe, the uptake of which is directly correlated with mitochondrial membrane potential. MitoTracker uptake was significantly reduced in cDCs isolated from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice ( Figure 7 F). Mitochondrial mass and inner membrane surface was interrogated using 10-N-nonyl acridine orange (NAO), which is integrated into the inner mitochondrial membrane independent of membrane potential. Interestingly, NAO uptake was also reduced in GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs ( Figure 7 G). These data prompted us to assess mitochondrial structure of cDCs using transmission electron microscopy ( Figure 7 H). Specifically, we quantified number, density, size, and form of mitochondria, all of which were not significantly different between the various groups of cDCs ( Figures S7 C–S7E). However, mitochondria of GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs had looser cristae and a wider intermembrane space ( Figure 7 I) that has been previously associated in T cells with less efficient electron transfer chain activity, reduced membrane potential, and mitochondrial function ( Klein Geltink et al., 2017 37. Klein Geltink, R.I. ∙ O’Sullivan, D. ∙ Corrado, M. ... Mitochondrial Priming by CD28 Cell. 2017; 171 :385-397 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We directly investigated the basal metabolic state of freshly isolated splenic cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice using extracellular flux analysis. We first assessed mitochondrial function by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), an indicator of oxidative phosphorylation. Both GF and Ifnar1 −/− cDCs had a considerably lower baseline OCR compared to cDCs from control mice ( Figure 7 J). While incubation of control cDCs with FCCP (an uncoupler allowing free flow of electrons through the respiratory chain) resulted in a marked enhancement of OCR, the respiratory capacity of cDCs from Ifnar1 −/− and GF mice could only be boosted to a much lesser extent. Accordingly, the spare respiratory capacity (SRC) of cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice was low ( Figure 7 K). SRC is the extra mitochondrial capacity available in a cell to produce energy under conditions of increased work or stress thought to be important for long-term cell survival and function. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of cDCs obtained from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice, which is an indicator of glycolysis, was not much different between control cDCs and cDCs from GF and Ifnar1 −/− mice ( Figure S7 F).
Collectively, our data demonstrate that microbiota-controlled, tonic IFN-I signaling in cDCs at steady state instructs a poised functional state. Such basal state of cDCs is characterized by a distinct transcriptional, chromatin, and metabolic program that is required so that cDCs can effectively respond to microbial stimulation. This beneficial function comes at a price, because the same signals program cDCs so that they can present harmless peripheral antigens and prime unwanted T cell responses, an adverse event usually blunted by mechanisms of peripheral tolerance. Removal of tonic IFN-I signaling or of IFN-I-producing pDCs makes cDCs entirely unresponsive even when triggered directly in an inflammatory environment.

Section: Discussion

Recognition of pathogens via PRRs expressed by cDCs leading to their activation and maturation is the central process that links innate immune recognition to Ag-specific adaptive immunity, a powerful mechanism to protect vertebrate hosts against infections ( Janeway, 1989 33. Janeway, Jr., C.A. Approaching the asymptote? Evolution and revolution in immunology Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54 :1-13 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data now demonstrate, that, to fulfill such functions, cDCs undergo a microbiota-guided “instruction” process. In the absence of microbiota, cDCs as well as other subsets of MPhs cannot appropriately engage an activation program upon stimulation, leading to higher susceptibility to some virus infections ( Abt et al., 2012; Galindo-Villegas et al., 2012; Ganal et al., 2012; Kane et al., 2011; Wilks and Golovkina, 2012 1.

The intestinal microbiota modulates the anticancer immune effects of cyclophosphamide Science. 2013; 342 :971-976 Crossref Scopus (1536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data also show that such microbiota-controlled “instruction” of the cDC basal state is permissive for T cell priming to harmless Ag, requiring mechanisms of peripheral tolerance to avoid “horror autotoxicus” ( Steinman and Nussenzweig, 2002 73. Steinman, R.M. ∙ Nussenzweig, M.C. Avoiding horror autotoxicus: the importance of dendritic cells in peripheral T cell tolerance Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :351-358 Crossref Scopus (1007) PubMed Google Scholar ). It should be noted that cDC “instruction” by the microbiota and “trained immunity” ( Netea et al., 2016; Quintin et al., 2012 52. Netea, M.G. ∙ Joosten, L.A. ∙ Latz, E. ... Trained immunity: A program of innate immune memory in health and disease Science. 2016; 352 :aaf1098 Crossref Scopus (1697) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Quintin, J. ∙ Saeed, S. ∙ Martens, J.H.A. ... Candida albicans infection affords protection against reinfection via functional reprogramming of monocytes Cell Host Microbe. 2012; 12 :223-232 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (867) PubMed Google Scholar ) are distinct processes, although they may share related regulatory modules, in particular chromatin remodeling and metabolic re-programing ( Cheng et al., 2014; Novakovic et al., 2016 13. Cheng, S.C. ∙ Quintin, J. ∙ Cramer, R.A. ... mTOR- and HIF-1α-mediated aerobic glycolysis as metabolic basis for trained immunity Science. 2014; 345 :1250684 Crossref Scopus (1369) PubMed Google Scholar 53.

In contrast, “training” refers to the imprint left by a pathogen (i.e., fungal cell wall components) on an already “instructed” cDC or MPh that makes it even better equipped to deal with consecutive infections.
We found that the commensal microbiota is the major regulator of steady-state IFN-I expression, and we identified microbiota-controlled tonic IFN-I signaling in cDCs as the major “instructor” of the cDC basal state. While the extent to which steady-state levels of IFN-I impact on transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic programming of cDCs was not previously recognized, tonic levels of IFN-I were believed to be important for many aspects of immune homeostasis in the steady state, such as hematopoietic stem cell maintenance ( Essers et al., 2009 19. Essers, M.A. ∙ Offner, S. ∙ Blanco-Bose, W.E. ... IFNalpha activates dormant haematopoietic stem cells in vivo Nature. 2009; 458 :904-908 Crossref Scopus (1087) PubMed Google Scholar ), NK cell function ( Lucas et al., 2007 44.

Dendritic cells prime natural killer cells by trans-presenting interleukin 15 Immunity. 2007; 26 :503-517 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ), enhanced resistance to virus infections ( McFarlane et al., 2017 46.

Immunol. 2017; 140 :1068-1078 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), bone homeostasis, and macrophage function ( Bocci, 1980; Gough et al., 2012; Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001 8.

Taniguchi, T. ∙ Takaoka, A. A weak signal for strong responses: interferon-alpha/beta revisited Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2 :378-386 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbiota-dependent production of steady-state IFN-I was not preferentially found in tissues in close contact with the commensal flora. Instead, systemically dispersed pDCs were the major source of tonic IFN-I in spleen and peripheral LNs. While it is not clear where pDCs receive microbiota signals, published data suggested that the composition of the intestinal microbiota has an impact on the number of intestinal pDCs ( Fujiwara et al., 2008; Manfredo Vieira et al., 2018 20. Fujiwara, D. ∙ Wei, B. ∙ Presley, L.L. ... Systemic control of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by CD8+ T cells and commensal microbiota J.

Translocation of a gut pathobiont drives autoimmunity in mice and humans Science. 2018; 359 :1156-1161 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data show that redundant signaling through PRR modules using MyD88, TRIF, and/or CARDIF are required for steady-state IFN-I expression by pDCs. While pDC:cDC modules were previously linked to orchestrate priming of CD8 + T cell responses during virus infections ( Brewitz et al., 2017 10. Brewitz, A. ∙ Eickhoff, S. ∙ Dähling, S. ... CD8 + T Cells Orchestrate pDC-XCR1 + Dendritic Cell Spatial and Functional Cooperativity to Optimize Priming Immunity. 2017; 46 :205-219 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data assign a new role to pDCs at the steady state, instructing the cDC basal metabolic state by providing tonic IFN-I signals to cDCs. Other components of the microbiota, in particular bacterial metabolites, might be involved in amplifying tonic IFN-I production. The commensal bacterial metabolite desaminotyrosine and indoles derived from tryptophan catabolism by certain commensal bacteria have been demonstrated to augment IFN-I signaling in the context of infections ( Steed et al., 2017; Swimm et al., 2018 72. Steed, A.L. ∙ Christophi, G.P. ∙ Kaiko, G.E. ... The microbial metabolite desaminotyrosine protects from influenza through type I interferon Science. 2017; 357 :498-502 Crossref Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar 75. Swimm, A. ∙ Giver, C.R. ∙ DeFilipp, Z. ... Indoles derived from intestinal microbiota act via type I interferon signaling to limit graft-versus-host disease Blood. 2018; 132 :2506-2519 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). A role of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), however, is unlikely. Treatment of cDCs or pDCs with SCFA led to their dominant inhibition and reduced IFN-I expression ( Arbez et al., 2014; Ganal et al., 2012 5. Arbez, J. ∙ Lamarthée, B. ∙ Gaugler, B. ... Histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid affects plasmacytoid dendritic cells phenotype and function Immunobiology. 2014; 219 :637-643 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar 22. Ganal, S.C. ∙ Sanos, S.L. ∙ Kallfass, C. ... Priming of natural killer cells by nonmucosal mononuclear phagocytes requires instructive signals from commensal microbiota Immunity. 2012; 37 :171-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data also cannot be explained by direct effects of SCFA on CD8 + T cells ( Bachem et al., 2019 6. Bachem, A. ∙ Makhlouf, C. ∙ Binger, K.J. ... Microbiota-Derived Short-Chain Fatty Acids Promote the Memory Potential of Antigen-Activated CD8(+) T Cells Immunity. 2019; 51 :285-297 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ) because low dose IFN-I treatment in GF mice was sufficient to rescue the function of Ifnar1 −/− CD8 + T cells.
It was surprising that Ifnar1 −/− DIETER cDCs were profoundly unresponsive and could not prime T cells even when directly triggered via the activating CD40 receptor. cDC function has recently been correlated with distinct changes in metabolism ( O’Neill and Pearce, 2016; Pearce and Everts, 2015 54. O’Neill, L.A. ∙ Pearce, E.J. Immunometabolism governs dendritic cell and macrophage function J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :15-23 Crossref Scopus (1119) PubMed Google Scholar 56. Pearce, E.J. ∙ Everts, B. Dendritic cell metabolism Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :18-29 Crossref Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is currently believed that resting cDCs use mainly oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial pathways to generate energy from the catabolism of complex molecules ( Krawczyk et al., 2010 38. Krawczyk, C.M. ∙ Holowka, T. ∙ Sun, J. ... Toll-like receptor-induced changes in glycolytic metabolism regulate dendritic cell activation Blood. 2010; 115 :4742-4749 Crossref Scopus (932) PubMed Google Scholar ). cDC differentiation from monocytes is accompanied by increased mitochondrial biogenesis ( Del Prete et al., 2008; Zaccagnino et al., 2012 17. Del Prete, A. ∙ Zaccagnino, P. ∙ Di Paola, M. ... Role of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species in dendritic cell differentiation and functions Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 44 :1443-1451 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Zaccagnino, P. ∙ Saltarella, M. ∙ Maiorano, S. ... An active mitochondrial biogenesis occurs during dendritic cell differentiation Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 44 :1962-1969 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). The signals inducing mitochondrial biogenesis and the exact stage at which these events occurred in vivo remained unclear. Our data now show that the expression of gene clusters involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and in oxidative phosphorylation strongly depend on commensal microbiota and on tonic IFN-I signaling. “Un-instructed” cDCs are in a metabolic basal state that does not permit activation even after direct cDC stimulation. While the effect of steady-state IFN-I on cDC metabolism has gone unnoticed, CpG or virus-induced high levels of IFN-I were previously shown to further increase fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation in pDCs from normal mice ( Wu et al., 2016 82. Wu, D. ∙ Sanin, D.E. ∙ Everts, B. ... Type 1 Interferons Induce Changes in Core Metabolism that Are Critical for Immune Function Immunity. 2016; 44 :1325-1336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future work will need to explore the molecular details of metabolic priming of cDC function by microbiota-controlled IFN-I signals.
Our data show that steady-state IFN-I production by pDCs is controlled by the commensal microbiota and instruct responsiveness of cDCs (and likely other MPhs). The efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors used for immunotherapy of cancer requires microbiota-dependent signals ( Routy et al., 2018 64. Routy, B. ∙ Le Chatelier, E. ∙ Derosa, L. ... Gut microbiome influences efficacy of PD-1-based immunotherapy against epithelial tumors Science. 2018; 359 :91-97 Crossref Scopus (3651) PubMed Google Scholar ). While a role of IFN-I was not addressed, it is intriguing to speculate that microbiota-controlled calibration of cDC function may be relevant for responsiveness to immunotherapies. Indeed, the ability of MPhs to respond with cytokine production to microbial stimulation is diverse in healthy individuals, a phenomenon linked to distinct microbiota ( Schirmer et al., 2016 67. Schirmer, M. ∙ Smeekens, S.P. ∙ Vlamakis, H. ... Linking the Human Gut Microbiome to Inflammatory Cytokine Production Capacity Cell. 2016; 167 :1125-1136 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (700) PubMed Google Scholar ). It will be interesting to explore if distinct microbial communities will differentially control steady-state IFN-I production that then may function as a rheostat for cDC calibration. As various autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjoegren’s syndrome, and type I diabetes) show an enhanced IFN-I-controlled gene expression signature early in disease development ( Ganguly, 2018 23. Ganguly, D. Do Type I Interferons Link Systemic Autoimmunities and Metabolic Syndrome in a Pathogenetic Continuum? Trends Immunol. 2018; 39 :28-43 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), the regulation of steady-state IFN-I by microbial communities may be of relevance for the pathomechanisms and therapies of these diseases. Collectively, our data identify a new level of cDC programming during steady state that we refer to as cDC “instruction.” cDCs are instructed by long-range actions of steady-state IFN-I levels that are produced by pDCs upon sensing of the indigenous microbiota. Steady-state IFN-I instruct a specific epigenomic and metabolic regulome poising cDCs for responsiveness to pathogen encounter. Such a beneficial biological function comes with a trade-off, that cDCs in such a poised state can prime unwanted T cell responses, a peril that is countered by the barriers of peripheral tolerance.

Mice were treated with antibiotics two weeks before the experiment and treatment was continued for the duration of the experiment. To verify elimination of bacteria, fresh feces isolated directly from the colon was dissolved in PBS (0.1 mg feces per ml PBS) and dissolved using a FastPrep-24 homogenizer (MP Bio). The dissolved feces was plated in serial tenfold dilutions on Columbia Blood Agar, McConkey Agar and Schädler’s Agar. Colombia Blood Agar and McConkey Agar Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. Schädler’s Agar Plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 48 hours at 37°C using airtight containers (Merck) and GasPak EZ pouches (Becton Dickinson). Anaerobic conditions were verified using anaerobic indicator stripes (Becton Dickinson). Colony Forming Units (CFU) were counted and calculated as CFU per g feces.
Escherichia coli JM83 was cultured overnight in LB medium at 37°C, shaking at 200 rpm ( Hapfelmeier et al., 2010 25. Hapfelmeier, S. ∙ Lawson, M.A. ∙ Slack, E. ... Reversible microbial colonization of germ-free mice reveals the dynamics of IgA immune responses Science. 2010; 328 :1705-1709 Crossref Scopus (614) PubMed Google Scholar ). To prepare gavage solutions, bacteria were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 x g and washed twice with sterile PBS. A dose of 10 10 CFU was resuspended in 500 μL of sterile PBS and administered to germ-free mice by oral gavage. Mice were kept for 4 weeks in order to allow for stable colonization before analysis.
Mice colonized with the stable Defined Moderately Diverse Mouse microbiota 2 (sDMDMm2) were born to sDMDMm2 colonized dams and raised under this defined colonization status ( Uchimura et al., 2016 79. Uchimura, Y. ∙ Wyss, M. ∙ Brugiroux, S. ... Complete Genome Sequences of 12 Species of Stable Defined Moderately Diverse Mouse Microbiota 2 Genome Announc. 2016; 4 :e00951-16 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Bone marrow was isolated by flushing tibiae and femora of donor mice with PBS. Bone marrow cells were depleted of T cells using anti-mouse pan-T Dynabeads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The cells were then mixed at the indicated ratios and 2-3 × 10 6 cells were injected intravenously (i.v.) into mice that had been lethally (9.5 Gy) irradiated using a 137 Cs source. Mice received BORGAL (1 mg/ml sulfadoxin and 0.2 mg/ml trimethoprim) in the drinking water for 3 weeks and were rested 6-8 weeks after transplantation before they were used in experiments. Equal take of bone marrow-derived cells from different origin in mixed chimeras was verified by flow cytometric analysis of CD45.1 and CD45.2 expression on blood T lymphocytes. Only animals with a close to 1:1 ratio of CD45.1 + and CD45.2 + of leukocytes were included in the experiments.
Ag presentation by steady-state cDC was induced in vivo by injecting DIETER mice or DIETER bone marrow chimeras i.p. with 2 mg tamoxifen (TAM) as described before ( Probst et al., 2003 58. Probst, H.C. ∙ Lagnel, J. ∙ Kollias, G. ... Inducible transgenic mice reveal resting dendritic cells as potent inducers of CD8+ T cell tolerance Immunity. 2003; 18 :713-720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD4 + T cells were depleted one day before TAM administration by injection of 0.5 mg GK1.5 i.v. pDC were depleted by injection of 0.5 mg PDCA-1 antibody on days −2, −1 and 1 (mAb 927, kind gift of M.Colonna). Priming of endogenous, GP 33-41 /D b - specific CD8 + T cells was measured 7 or 8 days after TAM injection by tetramer staining.
LCMV-derived peptide GP 33–41 (KAVYNFATM, H-2D b ) was kindly provided by Dr. Stefanovic, Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, Department of Immunology, University of Tübingen, Germany.
For in vivo stimulation, 50 μg ultrapure LPS from E. coli O111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 μg poly(I:C) (HMW, InvivoGen) or 75 μg anti-CD40 (clone FGK4.5, BioXCell) were diluted in 200 μl PBS and mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Purified cDC or bulk spleen cultures were activated in vitro with 1 μg/ml LPS for the indicated time in the presence of 5 μg/ml Brefeldin A.
TNF was measured by ELISA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IFN-I concentrations were determined by VSV bioassay ( Ganal et al., 2012 22. Ganal, S.C. ∙ Sanos, S.L. ∙ Kallfass, C. ... Priming of natural killer cells by nonmucosal mononuclear phagocytes requires instructive signals from commensal microbiota Immunity. 2012; 37 :171-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Spleens, peripheral or mesenteric lymph nodes, or Peyer’s patches were removed, first homogenized with a scissor and digested with collagenase II (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and DNase I (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at 37°C followed by incubation with 10 mM EDTA for 10 min at 37°C to dissociate DC-T cell clusters. Erythrocytes were removed by osmotic lysis by incubating the pelleted cells with 1 mL of red cell lysis buffer (RCLB) for 1 min on ice or with a 15% Optiprep density gradient.
Antibodies against mouse CD40 (clone FGK4.5), mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5) and rat IgG2b, κ, isotype control antibodies (clone SFR-8B6, specific for HLA-Bw6) were purified from hybridoma culture supernatant using protein G Sepharose (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). Tetrameric peptide-MHC complexes were generated and staining was performed as described previously ( Altman et al., 1996; Probst et al., 2003 3. Altman, J.D. ∙ Moss, P.A.H. ∙ Goulder, P.J.R. ... Phenotypic analysis of antigen-specific T lymphocytes Science. 1996; 274 :94-96 Crossref Scopus (3201) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Probst, H.C. ∙ Lagnel, J. ∙ Kollias, G. ... Inducible transgenic mice reveal resting dendritic cells as potent inducers of CD8+ T cell tolerance Immunity. 2003; 18 :713-720 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fluorochrome-coupled antibodies for flow cytometry were purchased as indicated in the Key Resources Table . Single cell suspensions were incubated for 20 min with 0.5 μg/ml anti-CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2) to block Fc-receptors followed by staining with fluorochrome-coupled antibodies for 20 min at 4°C in FACS buffer (PBS 1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA). Erythrocytes were lysed using Red Cell Lysis Buffer (RCLB). Flow cytometry analyses was performed following the recommendations in Cossarizza et al. (2019) 15. Cossarizza, A. ∙ Chang, H.D. ∙ Radbruch, A. ... Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies (second edition) Eur. J. Immunol. 2019; 49 :1457-1973 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar . Samples were analyzed on either a LSR-II, a FACSCanto II or a Fortessa X20 Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) and data were analyzed with FlowJo Analysis Software (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR). For sorting of splenic cDCs, cells were pre-enriched for CD11c + cells using CD11c MACS beads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To purify various leukocyte populations and stroma cells from Ifnb1 +/Δβ-luc mice, spleens were enzymatically digested as described above and leukocytes were separated using a 15% Optiprep density gradient. Cells were stained with the respective fluorescent antibodies. Cell sorting was performed on an ARIA II or an ARIA III Fusion cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) based on a published strategy to analyze the splenic myeloid compartment in mice ( Rose et al., 2012 63. Rose, S. ∙ Misharin, A. ∙ Perlman, H. A novel Ly6C/Ly6G-based strategy to analyze the mouse splenic myeloid compartment Cytometry A. 2012; 81 :343-350 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ).
After cell surface staining, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (ROTH, Karlsruhe, Germany) in FACS buffer and stained intracellularly for the respective cytokines. In order to detect IFN-γ produced by Ag-specific T cells in DIETER mice, cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C with 10 −6 M peptide GP 33-41 , 0.5 μg/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) plus 0.05 μg/ml ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or with medium alone, in the presence of 5 μg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich). For detection of TNF produced by in vivo or ex vivo stimulated cDC, cells were fixed/permeabilized after cell surface staining as described above, followed by intracellular TNF staining for 2 h.
For quantification of Ag presentation by cDC, Nur77 GFP reporter mice that express GFP proportionally to the strength of TCR ligation were used ( Moran et al., 2011 49. Moran, A.E. ∙ Holzapfel, K.L. ∙ Xing, Y. ... T cell receptor signal strength in Treg and iNKT cell development demonstrated by a novel fluorescent reporter mouse J. Exp. Med. 2011; 208 :1279-1289 Crossref Scopus (775) PubMed Google Scholar ). 48 h after the Cre-mediated induction of Ag presentation in DIETER mice, spleens were removed and treated with collagenase II, DNase I and EDTA as described above. cDCs were enriched using an OptiPrep gradient (AxisShield, Dundee, UK) as described resulting in a purity of ∼30% CD11c high MHC-II high cells. DCs were cultured in serial dilutions for 16 h with 5x10 3 purified CD8 + Nur77 GFP x TCR327 (P14) T cells. Induction of GFP expression in Nur77 GFP x TCR327 (P14) CD8 + T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.
For in vivo measurement of luciferase activity, mice were injected i.p. with luciferin (Caliper) at a final concentration of 150 mg/kg body weight. Within 30 min, whole body imaging was performed or mice were sacrificed and organs were individually analyzed with a Caliper Life Science IVIS Spectrum camera. For ex vivo measurement of luciferase activity of Ifnb1 +/Δβ-luc mice, leukocytes were isolated and digested as described above and lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Spleen stroma cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) using a potter homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 s at 16000 x g and luciferase activity in supernatants was measured in a single tube Luminometer (Turner Designs) using Luciferase Assay Substrate (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). For ex vivo luminometric analysis shown in Figure S6C, the indicated organs were removed, homogenized and lysed in Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis Buffer (Promega) via Lysing Matrix A on a FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals). Luciferase activity was measured in a Sirius Tube Luminometer (Berthold Technologies) by the single Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
For real-time measurement of OCR and ECAR, sort purified splenic cDC were rested for 3 h until adherent to a XFe96 microplate. Media was exchanged with un-supplemented XF Assay Medium and analyzed with an XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent Seahorse). Four consecutive measurements were obtained under basal conditions followed by the addition of 10 mM glucose, 1 μM oligomycin, which inhibits the mitochondrial ATP synthase, 1.5 μM triflouromethoxy phenylhydrazone (FCCP), which uncouples ATP synthesis from oxygen consumption and a combination of 100 nM rotenone plus 1 μM antimycin A, which inhibit the electron transport chain by blocking complex I and III, respectively. All chemicals used for these assays were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. SRC is calculated as the difference between basal OCR and the maximal OCR after the addition of FCCP.
Bulk splenic cultures were stained with either 5 μM Nonyl Acridine Orange (Invitrogen) or 100 nM Mitotracker CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in serum-free RPMI medium. Cells were subsequently washed and stained with fluorescent antibodies before they were analyzed by flow cytometry.
Isolated cells were fixed on glass coverslips in 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde (EM Grade, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PB). Following fixation, samples were washed in PB and post fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide. After extensive washing in 0.1 M PB, samples were contrasted using 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 1 h, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series, followed by propylen oxide and finally embedded in epoxy resin (Durcupan, Roth, Germany). Ultrathin sections were cut using an UC6 Leica ultramicrotome and imaged using a Philips CM100 Transmisson Electron Microscope (TEM). Quantitative image analysis was performed using Olympus ITEM software.
Cells were resuspended in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For DNA removal, the RNA was treated with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Invitrogen). The RNA concentration was measured using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorimeter (Invitrogen) or a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequently, the isolated RNA amounts were normalized and the same amount of RNA was used in every reaction (up to 2 μg total RNA per reaction). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was performed in 384 well plates and run on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Primers (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at a final concentration of 400 nM in SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were performed in duplicates or triplicates and gene expression was normalized to the expression of the house keeping gene hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 ( Hprt1 ). Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR are listed in Table S3 .
RNA-seq analyses shown in Figures 2 , 5 , S2 , and S5 were performed using 2 biological replicates. Total RNA was prepared from sort-purified cDC (as in Figure S2 A, step 1-7) using Trizol (Invitrogen) and isopropanol precipitation with linear polyacrylamide (GenElute-LPA, Sigma-Aldrich) as a carrier. The RNA concentration was measured using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorimeter (Invitrogen) and the RNA quality was measured on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Genomics). 10 ng of total RNA was subsequently used to prepare RNA-Seq library by using the TruSeq RNA sample prep kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina).

RNA quantity was assessed by Qubit 2.0 using HS RNA assay kit, quality was determined by Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) using RNA pico chip. Barcoded mRNA seq libraries were prepared from 100 ng of total RNA (RIN > 8) using a NEBnext poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module and NEBnext UltraII lib prep kit for Illumina (New England Biosciences) according to the manual. All quality controls were done using Invitrogen’s Qubit HS assay and fragment size was determined on Agilent’s 2100 Bioanalyzer HS DNA assay. Single-end RNA sequencing (59nt) was performed on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina). Barcoded RNA-seq libraries were onboard clustered using HiSeq® Rapid SR Cluster Kit v2 using 8pM and 59bps were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 using HiSeq® Rapid SBS Kit v2 (59 Cycle). The raw output data of the HiSeq was preprocessed according to the Illumina standard protocol.
RNA-seq analysis shown in Figures 4 and S4 was performed using 4 biological replicates For RNA-seq analyses of splenic cDC1 and cDC2 (sorted as shown in Figure S2 A, step 1-8), total RNA was prepared from sort-purified cDC1 and cDC2 (for each sample 3 individual mice were pooled) using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) in combination with the miRNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For RNA quality validation samples were analyzed using the Fragment Analyzer System and the HS RNA 15nt Kit (Agilent). Only RNA samples with an RNA Quality Number ≥ 9 were selected for sequencing. For poly-A-dependent cDNA synthesis and a first amplification step 10 ng of total RNA was used as input in the Smart-Seq v4 mRNA Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Clontech) and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After quality control (HS NGS Fragment Kit (1-6000bp), Agilent) and concentration measurement (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Invitrogen), 1 ng of the purified cDNA was used for tagmentation and library completion with the Nextera XT library preparation kit (Illumina). In the following, 2x75nt paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500.
Sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse genome (NCBI37/mm9) with Tophat 2.0.9 ( Kim et al., 2013 36. Kim, D. ∙ Pertea, G. ∙ Trapnell, C. ... TopHat2: accurate alignment of transcriptomes in the presence of insertions, deletions and gene fusions Genome Biol. 2013; 14 :R36 Crossref Scopus (9645) PubMed Google Scholar ) and uniquely mapped reads were used to calculate gene expression. RefSeq gene database (mm9) was downloaded from the UCSC genome browser for RNA-seq analysis. Gene expression of annotated transcripts was calculated from mapped RNA-seq reads using Cuffdiff to obtain FPKM-normalized gene expression values ( Trapnell et al., 2010 78. Trapnell, C. ∙ Williams, B.A. ∙ Pertea, G. ... Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :511-515 Crossref Scopus (11853) PubMed Google Scholar ). Two-tailed t tests were performed to identify differentially expressed genes. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed as previously described ( Subramanian et al., 2005 74. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33620) PubMed Google Scholar ) using gene sets presented in Table S1 . Only genes with a FPKM ≥ 1 in either sample was included in the GSEA analysis.

Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (27977) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the RefSeq gene database (mm9) as background.
Sequenced reads for cDC, cDC1 and cDC2 samples were mapped to the RefSeq mouse transcriptome (mm10) using Salmon (v.0.14.1) ( Patro et al., 2017 55. Patro, R. ∙ Duggal, G. ∙ Love, M.I. ... Salmon provides fast and bias-aware quantification of transcript expression Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :417-419 Crossref Scopus (5693) PubMed Google Scholar ) with validation enabled and quantified at the gene level. Statistical analysis (Likelihod ratio tests) were performed using DESeq2 (v.1.24.0) ( Love et al., 2014 43. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48497) PubMed Google Scholar ) controlling for gender when necessary. Gene ontology using DAVID (6.8) ( Huang et al., 2009 30. Huang, W. ∙ Sherman, B.T. ∙ Lempicki, R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 :44-57 Crossref Scopus (27977) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed for GO terms classified as biological processes. An enrichment map was created in Cytoscape (v3.7.2) ( Shannon et al., 2003 69. Shannon, P. ∙ Markiel, A. ∙ Ozier, O. ... Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks Genome Res. 2003; 13 :2498-2504 Crossref Scopus (32549) PubMed Google Scholar ) using all significantly enriched GO terms (FDR < 0.05) with a gene set size between 10-1000. Overlap was used as metric and the cutoff was set to 1. Clustering was performed using AutoAnnotate (v1.3.2) ( Kucera et al., 2016 39. Kucera, M. ∙ Isserlin, R. ∙ Arkhangorodsky, A. ... AutoAnnotate: A Cytoscape app for summarizing networks with semantic annotations F1000Res. 2016; 5 :1717 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) with overlap used as edge weight values. Normalized gene counts from DESeq2 were used as expression dataset for GSEA analysis (v4.0.1 with MSigDB v7.0) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 74. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ...

Permutation was set to gene_set and gene set size limits was set to 10-1000.
Highly purified splenic cDCs were fixed in 1.0% formaldehyde (Sigma). The fixing reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 M glycine. Cell lysis was performed in ChIP lysis buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in sonication buffer following sonification in a Bioruptor UCD-300 (Diagenode) for 20 cycles at high intensity. The lysates were cleared and transferred into new tubes. A portion of the sample serving as input was frozen at −80°C until further use. The antibody specific against the protein of interest was added and incubated overnight. Blocked protein-A-beads were added and extensively washed. The samples were eluted by adding ChIP elution buffer following decrosslinking at 65°C overnight. RNaseA (PeqLab) and proteinase K (PeqLab) were added. Subsequently, 5 M NaCl was added to the samples before DNA was purified with the PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN). The samples were stored at −80°C until further use.
All ChIP-seq analyses were performed using 2 biological replicates. Raw data from replicate measurements are publically available from the EBI ArrayExpress repository.
