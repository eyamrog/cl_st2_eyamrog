Title: Cellular Control of Viscosity Counters Changes in Temperature and Energy Availability


Abstract: Summary

Cellular functioning requires the orchestration of thousands of molecular interactions in time and space. Yet most molecules in a cell move by diffusion, which is sensitive to external factors like temperature. How cells sustain complex, diffusion-based systems across wide temperature ranges is unknown. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which budding yeast modulate viscosity in response to temperature and energy availability. This “viscoadaptation” uses regulated synthesis of glycogen and trehalose to vary the viscosity of the cytosol. Viscoadaptation functions as a stress response and a homeostatic mechanism, allowing cells to maintain invariant diffusion across a 20°C temperature range. Perturbations to viscoadaptation affect solubility and phase separation, suggesting that viscoadaptation may have implications for multiple biophysical processes in the cell. Conditions that lower ATP trigger viscoadaptation, linking energy availability to rate regulation of diffusion-controlled processes. Viscoadaptation reveals viscosity to be a tunable property for regulating diffusion-controlled processes in a changing environment.

Section: Introduction

Warm-blooded organisms thrive in a wide range of environments by maintaining nearly constant internal temperatures. Yet many organisms lacking homeothermic regulation also tolerate large and unpredictable fluctuations in temperature. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae , for example, can grow and divide at temperatures that span 30°C or more ( Salvadó et al., 2011 56. Salvadó, Z. ∙ Arroyo-López, F.N. ∙ Guillamón, J.M. ... Temperature adaptation markedly determines evolution within the genus Saccharomyces Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77 :2292-2302 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tai et al., 2007 64. Tai, S.L. ∙ Daran-Lapujade, P. ∙ Walsh, M.C. ... Acclimation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to low temperature: a chemostat-based transcriptome analysis Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18 :5100-5112 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other organisms have adapted to more extreme conditions and can survive temperatures ranging from 80°C to 120°C ( Frock and Kelly, 2012 16. Frock, A.D. ∙ Kelly, R.M. Extreme Thermophiles: Moving beyond single-enzyme biocatalysis Curr. Opin. Chem. Eng. 2012; 1 :363-372 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such versatility is remarkable given the numerous thermodynamic challenges that temperature variation poses for a cell. Many cellular processes, such as protein folding, are dictated by small energetic differences between states and are therefore highly sensitive to temperature ( Dill, 1990 11. Dill, K.A. Dominant forces in protein folding Biochemistry. 1990; 29 :7133-7155 Crossref Scopus (3472) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to intra molecular processes, temperature has a profound effect on inter molecular processes. In general, increasing the temperature of a liquid lowers its viscosity thereby increasing the diffusion rate of any constituent particles ( Longsworth, 1954 34. Longsworth, L.G. Temperature Dependence of Diffusion in Aqueous Solutions J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58 :770-773 Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar ). As such, molecular interactions become more frequent. Varying the rate of molecular interactions is expected to have numerous consequences, including changing the rate of diffusion-controlled reactions, the kinetics of complex assembly, and the timescale of signal transduction ( Johnson, 2018 28. Johnson, M.E. Modeling the Self-Assembly of Protein Complexes through a Rigid-Body Rotational Reaction-Diffusion Algorithm J. Phys. Chem. B. 2018; 122 :11771-11783 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Longsworth, 1954 34. Longsworth, L.G. Temperature Dependence of Diffusion in Aqueous Solutions J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58 :770-773 Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar ; Stojanovski et al., 2017 62. Stojanovski, K. ∙ Ferrar, T. ∙ Benisty, H. ... Interaction Dynamics Determine Signaling and Output Pathway Responses Cell Rep. 2017; 19 :136-149 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). With so many diffusion-based cellular processes, a change in environmental temperature could be catastrophic to cellular function, and yet many organisms routinely tolerate these changes. How the temperature dependence of diffusion manifests in live cells with highly complex and dynamic interaction networks is largely unknown. Likewise, little is known about the cellular strategies that may exist to mitigate these challenges.
Seminal work in the 1970s revealed a homeostatic mechanism for controlling the fluidity of cell membranes in response to changing temperatures. Coined “homeoviscous adaptation,” cells respond to changes in temperature by adjusting the lipid content of their membranes to maintain their appropriate viscosity ( Sinensky, 1974 61. Sinensky, M. Homeoviscous adaptation--a homeostatic process that regulates the viscosity of membrane lipids in Escherichia coli Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1974; 71 :522-525 Crossref Scopus (1229) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this way, the cell is able to control the rate of intermolecular interactions in the membrane in a temperature-independent way ( Budin et al., 2018 5. Budin, I. ∙ de Rond, T. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Viscous control of cellular respiration by membrane lipid composition Science. 2018; 362 :1186-1189 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). No such mechanism had been identified for the cytosol. In this work, we compared the rate of a diffusion-controlled exogenous model reaction in vivo and in vitro as a function of temperature. In doing so, we discovered a form of cellular adaptation that renders the reaction rate invariant to temperature changes in vivo , despite having strong temperature dependence in vitro . Termed “viscoadaptation,” this response allows the cell to maintain a near-constant intracellular viscosity despite changes in temperature. As a result, diffusion rates and viscosity-controlled reaction rates are held invariant across at least 20°C. Viscoadaptation is both a homeostatic mechanism for growth at multiple temperatures as well as an acute response to environmental stressors.

Section: Results

To determine the effect of temperature on molecular interactions and diffusion-controlled reactions in live yeast, we used an exogenous biotinylation reaction in which the BirA enzyme from E. coli is co-expressed with its biotin-accepting substrate (the “Avi tag”) fused to a “bait” protein ( Chen et al., 2005 7. Chen, I. ∙ Howarth, M. ∙ Lin, W. ... Site-specific labeling of cell surface proteins with biophysical probes using biotin ligase Nat. Methods. 2005; 2 :99-104 Crossref Scopus (556) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jan et al., 2014 27. Jan, C.H. ∙ Williams, C.C. ∙ Weissman, J.S. Principles of ER cotranslational translocation revealed by proximity-specific ribosome profiling Science. 2014; 346 :1257521 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S1 A). The BirA reaction is well suited as a model, because it is temporally controlled by addition of biotin to the cell-culture media, it can be performed in vitro and in vivo , and its progress is readily measured by a gel shift assay in which addition of streptavidin selectively causes the biotinylated species to run at a higher molecular weight ( Figure S1 A). We characterized the relationship between diffusion and the BirA biotinylation rate by measuring the reaction in solutions of varying viscosity due to sucrose content (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%) ( Figure 1 A). As a readout for diffusion we measured the mobility of GFP, a relatively compact protein, by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), in which purified GFP was added to each solution and a circular region was photobleached. Fluorescence recovery in the bleached region was measured over time as an indicator of the diffusion rate of GFP and thus the viscosity of the solution ( Figure S1 B). Recovery rates were quantified as the time for the bleached area to recover half of its initial intensity (“t-half”) or as diffusion coefficients of GFP ( Figure S1 B). t-half values increase with increasing viscosity, whereas diffusion coefficients decrease with increasing viscosity. Example FRAP movies are provided via Mendeley. The BirA reaction rate scaled 1:1 with solution viscosity (reported as 1/t-half) for all concentrations of sucrose tested ( Figure 1 A). We thus concluded that the BirA reaction was diffusion limited. Unless otherwise specified, reactions described occur between cytosolic BirA and GFP-Avi.
We next tested the temperature sensitivity of the BirA reaction in vitro by performing the reaction in cell lysates at 30°C or 37°C (normal yeast growth temperatures) ( Figure 1 B). To make lysates, cells in liquid culture were filter-dried, frozen, and mechanically lysed. Subsequent centrifugation removed large structures such as cell wall debris, nuclei, and vacuoles that were not ruptured during lysis. The resulting lysates reflect the “average” cellular environment rather than the environment of a single compartment. FRAP measurements in the lysates estimated that they were approximately 10-fold less viscous than the cytosol of intact cells, with a viscosity similar to 40% sucrose ( Figure 1 C). This difference in viscosity is likely due to dilution by growth media that was incompletely removed during filtration and mixing of cellular compartments. We note that the diffusion coefficient we measured for GFP in live yeast is between the values observed in bacterial cytoplasm and mammalian cytoplasm ( Mika and Poolman, 2011 37.

To remove additional variables, each reaction contained equal amounts of exogenous BirA and biotin and an excess of ATP. When we performed the reaction at 30°C or 37°C, the rate was 50% faster at 37°C, indicating that the BirA reaction is temperature-dependent in vitro ( Figure 1 B). However, when we measured the BirA reaction in live cells growing at 30°C or 37°C, we found no difference in rate ( Figure 1 D). Temperature insensitivity in vivo contrasted with the temperature dependence in vitro , suggesting that a change in the intracellular environment modifies the reaction rate at one or both temperatures. Since the reaction is exogenous, we predicted a broad cellular strategy of reaction regulation in response to temperature change.
The lack of temperature sensitivity in vivo suggested that either the viscosity of the cellular environment was not changing as expected with temperature or a separate cellular change was slowing the reaction at the higher temperature. We hypothesized that the viscosity of the cellular environment could be modulated by production of a viscosity-increasing molecule (“viscogen”) in cells growing at 37°C. If so, the reaction should be slower in lysates from cells grown at 37°C compared to those from cells grown at 30°C when the reactions are carried out at the same temperature. Consistent with this hypothesis, the reaction was 25% slower in the 37°C-derived lysate ( Figure 1 E). Furthermore, the measured viscosity of the lysate in each condition corresponded linearly to the observed reaction rate ( Figure 1 A).
The constant rate of the BirA reaction in live cells at 30°C and 37°C suggests that cells growing in steady state at different temperatures adapt homeostatically to maintain invariant reaction rates. If so, we predicted that the in vitro reaction rates would be equivalent for reactions performed at the growth temperatures of the cells prior to lysis (30°C or 37°C). Indeed, we found that changing the reaction temperature to match the cell-culture growth temperature equalized the in vitro reaction rates ( Figure 1 F). These findings were not specific to GFP-Avi ( Figure S1 C). We conclude from these observations that cells maintain constant rates of viscosity-controlled reactions at different growth temperatures.
We next tested whether cells regulate intracellular viscosity in response to temperature by measuring the mobility of GFP using FRAP in vivo and in vitro . Data are reported as diffusion coefficients or t-half values (raw FRAP values used for t-half determination and raw FRAP movies used for diffusion coefficient determination are provided via Mendeley). To determine the effect of temperature on diffusion in the absence of active cellular regulation, FRAP was performed on cell lysates at 22°C, 30°C, 37°C, and 42°C. The diffusion coefficient of GFP increased with temperature and was ∼80% higher at 42°C relative to 22°C ( Figure 2 A). This result is consistent with the known effect of temperature on diffusion, though the magnitude of the effect is larger than would be predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation ( Cruickshank and James, 1924 8. Cruickshank, M.C. ∙ James, W. The Stokes-Einstein law for diffusion in solution Proc. R. Soc. Lond., A Contain. Pap. Math. Phys. Character. 1924; 106 :724-749 Google Scholar ). Deviations from the Stokes-Einstein prediction have previously been observed in cytosol ( Sidell and Hazel, 1987 60. Sidell, B.D. ∙ Hazel, J.R. Temperature affects the diffusion of small molecules through cytosol of fish muscle J. Exp. Biol. 1987; 129 :191-203 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next measured the diffusion of GFP in live cells. Cells at 22°C had an average t-half of 0.08 s and when transferred to 42°C showed an initial drop in t-half to 0.05 s, almost 40% lower and in agreement with the results in cell lysates ( Figure 2 B). However, when cells were given at least 20 min at the higher temperature before measurement, diffusion rates decreased with increasing temperature. In the most extreme case, the average t-half after adjustment to 42°C was 0.19 s, almost 300% higher than the t-half in cells measured immediately after the temperature shift ( Figure 2 B). This result was not specific to GFP ( Figure S2 A). We conclude that cells respond to acute temperature increase by raising their viscosity, thereby slowing the diffusion of cytosolic proteins.
To track the adaptation of cells to heat shock over time, we collected a time course of FRAP measurements, beginning immediately after heat shock (22°C to 42°C) and extending to 40 min after heat shock ( Figure 2 C). Immediately after the temperature shift, we saw a drop in recovery time to 0.05 s, reflecting the effect of temperature increase on diffusion prior to cellular adaptation. However, t-half values then began to increase, reaching 0.17 s at 20 min and 0.24 s at 40 min. Again, the observed trends were not specific to GFP ( Figure S2 B).
Our observations suggest that acute heat shock increases cytosolic viscosity. Yet we observed a constant BirA reaction rate in cells growing at 30°C and 37°C ( Figure 1 D). We therefore investigated whether cytosolic diffusion is controlled homeostatically at longer timescales. To test this, we grew yeast to log-phase at 22°C, 30°C, 37°C, or 40°C (the highest permissible growth temperature) and performed FRAP measurements in a chamber matched to the growth temperature of the culture. Strikingly, the t-half for GFP was nearly constant at all temperatures, at a value of about 0.08 s ( Figure 2 D). This homeostatic control of viscosity in vivo corresponded to increased viscosity in cell lysates from cultures grown at higher temperatures when lysates were measured at 22°C ( Figure 2 E). Collectively, our results reveal that cells counteract the effect of temperature on protein diffusion by increasing their intracellular viscosity. We term this phenomenon “viscoadaptation.”
We next investigated the mechanism underlying viscoadaptation. Neither the degree nor speed of viscoadaptation was significantly affected by pretreatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis is not required for viscoadaptation in response to acute heat shock ( Figure S3 A). In addition to specialized proteins, temperature increase rapidly induces synthesis of two carbohydrates, glycogen and trehalose ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S3 B) ( Hottiger et al., 1987a 20. Hottiger, T. ∙ Schmutz, P. ∙ Wiemken, A. Heat-induced accumulation and futile cycling of trehalose in Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169 :5518-5522 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar , 1987b 21. Hottiger, T. ∙ Boller, T. ∙ Wiemken, A. Rapid changes of heat and desiccation tolerance correlated with changes of trehalose content in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells subjected to temperature shifts FEBS Lett. 1987; 220 :113-115 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both glycogen and trehalose are assembled from glucose monomers and together can account for up to 20% of a cell’s dry mass in severe heat shock ( Shi et al., 2010 59. Shi, L. ∙ Sutter, B.M. ∙ Ye, X. ... Trehalose is a key determinant of the quiescent metabolic state that fuels cell cycle progression upon return to growth Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21 :1982-1990 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both glycogen and trehalose improve tolerance to heat stress ( Gibney et al., 2013 17. Gibney, P.A. ∙ Lu, C. ∙ Caudy, A.A. ... Yeast metabolic and signaling genes are required for heat-shock survival and have little overlap with the heat-induced genes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Proteomics. 2002; 1 :232-242 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). A glycogen molecule is composed of thousands of glucose monomers in an extensively branched spherical structure that can reach 40 nm in diameter in yeast ( Prats et al., 2018 49. Prats, C. ∙ Graham, T.E. ∙ Shearer, J. The dynamic life of the glycogen granule J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 :7089-7098 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Glycogen acts as a viscogen in aqueous solutions ( Kerly, 1930 30. Kerly, M. The solubility of glycogen Biochem. J. 1930; 24 :67-76 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) (our observations below).
Trehalose is a small disaccharide formed by a 1,1-glycosidic bond between two ɑ-glucose monomers ( Jain and Roy, 2009 26. Jain, N.K. ∙ Roy, I. Effect of trehalose on protein structure Protein Sci. 2009; 18 :24-36 Crossref Scopus (695) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to the “immobilization theory,” trehalose protects cells against desiccation by undergoing a liquid-to-glass phase transition that drastically reduces molecular mobility ( Jain and Roy, 2009 26. Jain, N.K. ∙ Roy, I. Effect of trehalose on protein structure Protein Sci. 2009; 18 :24-36 Crossref Scopus (695) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trehalose has also been proposed to act as a kosmotrope, substituting for water around biomolecules and causing the surrounding water molecules to become more ordered ( Jain and Roy, 2009 26. Jain, N.K. ∙ Roy, I. Effect of trehalose on protein structure Protein Sci. 2009; 18 :24-36 Crossref Scopus (695) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both proposed functions reduce the mobility of biomolecules ( Jain and Roy, 2009 26. Jain, N.K. ∙ Roy, I. Effect of trehalose on protein structure Protein Sci. 2009; 18 :24-36 Crossref Scopus (695) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Given the potential for glycogen and trehalose to influence the viscosity of solutions and their temperature-dependent production, we investigated how these two carbohydrates affect viscoadaptation. To do so, we generated yeast mutants deficient in the synthesis of one or both carbohydrates. Yeast lacking the trehalose synthesis enzyme Tps2 failed to increase viscosity in response to 42°C heat shock ( Figure 3 C), suggesting that trehalose production is necessary for viscoadaptation during temperature increase. We next examined diffusion after heat shock in strains lacking the glycogen synthase, Gsy2, or the glycogen branching enzyme, Glc3. To qualitatively and rapidly determine changes in glycogen in live yeast, we adapted an iodine vapor staining method in which darker staining indicates higher glycogen content ( Figure S3 C) ( Demonte et al., 2014 10. Demonte, A.M. ∙ Asención Diez, M.D. ∙ Guerrero, S.A. ... Iodine staining of Escherichia coli expressing genes involved in the synthesis of bacterial glycogen Bio-protocol. 2014; 4 :e1224 Crossref Google Scholar ). As expected, iodine staining revealed that strains lacking Gsy2 or Glc3 failed to accumulate glycogen in response to heat shock at 42°C ( Figure 3 C). Unexpectedly, yeast deficient in glycogen synthesis demonstrated a wide range of diffusion phenotypes. Approximately 50% of cells failed to slow diffusion in response to heat (“non-responders”), but the remainder of cells responded normally or hyper-responded (“responders”) ( Figure 3 C). Glycogen and trehalose are made from the same precursor and disruption of one pathway can increase flux into the other ( Seo et al., 2018 58. Seo, Y. ∙ Kingsley, S. ∙ Walker, G. ... Metabolic shift from glycogen to trehalose promotes lifespan and healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E2791-E2800 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A). We therefore reasoned that the population of hyper-viscous glycogen-deficient cells could result from increased flux through the trehalose synthesis pathway and resultant over-accumulation of trehalose in some cells. Consistent with this model, when production of both glycogen and trehalose was blocked by double knockout of GLC3 and TPS2 , all cells failed to increase viscosity in response to heat shock ( Figure 3 C).
Genetic knockouts can have long-term, indirect effects on cells. We therefore made use of several pharmacological tools to interfere with glycogen and trehalose production. Treatment with LiCl reduces levels of glycogen and trehalose accumulated in response to heat ( Masuda et al., 2001 36. Masuda, C.A. ∙ Xavier, M.A. ∙ Mattos, K.A. ... Phosphoglucomutase is an in vivo lithium target in yeast J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 :37794-37801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S3 D) and prevented viscosity increase ( Figure 3 C). 1,4-imino-1,4-arabinitol (DAB), an inhibitor of glycogen phosphorylase ( Walls et al., 2008 69. Walls, A.B. ∙ Sickmann, H.M. ∙ Brown, A. ... Characterization of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-arabinitol (DAB) as an inhibitor of brain glycogen shunt activity J. Neurochem. 2008; 105 :1462-1470 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Validamycin A, an inhibitor of trehalase ( Müller et al., 1995 40. Müller, J. ∙ Boller, T. ∙ Wiemken, A. Effects of validamycin A, a potent trehalase inhibitor, and phytohormones on trehalose metabolism in roots and root nodules of soybean and cowpea Planta. 1995; 197 :362-368 Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar ), prevent the degradation of glycogen and trehalose after heat without affecting glycogen synthesis ( Figure S3 E). FRAP of cells that had been allowed to cool gradually from 42°C to room temperature over 90 min showed that untreated cells had decreased viscosity, whereas drug-treated cells generally increased in viscosity ( Figure 3 D). This is predicted if glycogen and trehalose levels determine viscosity, and their levels remain high as temperature decreases. These pharmacological experiments suggest that glycogen and trehalose are necessary and sufficient to increase viscosity during heat shock in vivo .
Changes in cell size can increase molecular crowding with resultant effects on the mobility of large structures ( Delarue et al., 2018 9. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 Controls Phase Separation and the Biophysical Properties of the Cytoplasm by Tuning Crowding Cell. 2018; 174 :338-349 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joyner et al., 2016 29. Joyner, R.P. ∙ Tang, J.H. ∙ Helenius, J. ... A glucose-starvation response regulates the diffusion of macromolecules eLife. 2016; 5 :5 Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar ). Yet cell size was not correlated with viscoadaptation ( Figure S3 F), and thus crowding caused by changes in cell size does not explain viscoadaptation or its dependence on glycogen and trehalose production. Glucose, the precursor to glycogen and trehalose, also increases viscosity of solutions, and thus its accumulation could contribute to viscoadaptation ( Telis et al., 2007 66. Telis, V.R.N. ∙ Telis-Romero, J. ∙ Mazzotti, H.B. ... Viscosity of Aqueous Carbohydrate Solutions at Different Temperatures and Concentrations Int. J. Food Prop. 2007; 10 :185-195 Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar ). Glucose levels were unaffected by steady-state growth temperature but decreased by ∼30% within 5 min of heat shock except when glycogen synthesis was impaired ( Figure S3 G). This is consistent with the conversion of glucose to glycogen and trehalose upon heat shock but not consistent with a direct role for glucose in controlling cytosolic viscosity.
To determine how glycogen and trehalose affect diffusion-controlled reaction rates, we sought to measure the rate of the BirA reaction in cells with compromised glycogen or trehalose production. However, we found that tps2Δ yeast could not grow in the low biotin media required for biotinylation assays. Glycogen-deficient strains did not show a significant difference in reaction rate, presumably due to the heterogeneity of cellular viscosities ( Figure S3 H). Strikingly, LiCl treatment of cultures growing at 30°C or 37°C resulted in a disequalization of the BirA reaction rate with the reaction proceeding 50% faster at 37°C, in agreement with the results in cell lysates ( Figure 3 E). Treatment with an equivalent concentration of NaCl did not affect viscoadaptation, ruling out general effects of salt treatment ( Figure S3 I). These data suggest that accumulation of glycogen and trehalose is necessary and sufficient to increase intracellular viscosity in response to heat. Without ruling out a role for other factors, we propose that accumulation of glycogen and trehalose is the primary mechanism for viscoadaptation.
Our results thus far have demonstrated that regulation of glycogen and trehalose production by environmental temperature is closely linked to the diffusibility of cellular proteins. Cells upregulate glycogen and trehalose in response to cues in addition to temperature, including forms of nutrient deprivation ( Lillie and Pringle, 1980 33. Lillie, S.H. ∙ Pringle, J.R. Reserve carbohydrate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: responses to nutrient limitation J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143 :1384-1394 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Thomsson et al., 2005 67. Thomsson, E. ∙ Gustafsson, L. ∙ Larsson, C. Starvation response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in anaerobic nitrogen- or carbon-limited chemostat cultures Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71 :3007-3013 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we observed glycogen accumulation in cells subjected to acute glucose deprivation, and both glycogen and trehalose accumulated in stationary phase cultures where nutrients were depleted over time ( Figure 4 A). We therefore tested whether glucose deprivation affects intracellular diffusion and consequently the rates of diffusion-controlled reactions. A switch from 2% to 0% glucose reduced the biotinylation rate of GFP-Avi by ∼55% in live cells ( Figure 4 B). This observation held for other BirA-Protein/Avi-Protein pairs ( Figure S4 A). Additionally, the rate of biotinylation in vitro was ∼65% lower in lysates from glucose-starved cells relative to those from unstressed cells ( Figure 4 C). The similar magnitude of the rate discrepancy in vitro and in vivo (despite lysates being diluted relative to intact cells) suggests that increased viscosity may not be the only factor slowing biotinylation in glucose-starved cells. To determine the contribution of viscoadaptation to the slowed BirA reaction rate, we compared biotinylation rates in live cells starved with or without LiCl. LiCl treatment decreased glycogen accumulation during starvation and increased the rate of biotinylation by ∼50% relative to the untreated control ( Figure 4 D). This suggests that viscoadaptation contributes to the reduced rate of biotinylation in glucose-starved cells and reveals that glycogen is sufficient for this effect.
We next measured diffusion using FRAP in the same glucose-starved condition and found that viscosity increased by ∼50% ( Figure S4 B). Cells for BirA labeling were grown in low biotin media (0.5 nM compared to 8 nM) to prevent background biotinylation. To determine whether viscoadaptation during glucose starvation occurs under less specialized conditions, we performed FRAP on cells in 0% glucose with biotin-replete media. In this case, 0% glucose did not cause increased viscosity ( Figure S4 B), but low glucose (0.1%) doubled the t-half relative to cells in 2% glucose ( Figure 4 E). The increased t-half in low glucose was reversed by LiCl treatment ( Figure 4 E). Accordingly, iodine staining demonstrated that 0% glucose caused accumulation of glycogen only when cells were grown in low biotin media ( Figure 4 SC). We tested whether differences in available glucose were impacting glycogen synthesis or cellular viscosity but found that glucose did not correlate with viscosity or explain the biotin-dependent discrepancy in glycogen production during starvation ( Figure S4 D). Thus, glycogen, but not glucose or trehalose, correlates with viscoadaptation in acute glucose starvation.
To test the requirement for glycogen and trehalose synthesis machinery in viscosity changes during starvation, we measured diffusion in strains transferred to 0.1% glucose with and without glycogen or trehalose synthesis enzymes. Strains lacking Glc3 or a combination of Glc3, Gsy2, and Tps2 showed impaired ability to increase viscosity in response to low glucose ( Figure 4 F). Occasional high viscosity cells were observed in the glc3Δ single knockout, which may be due to aberrant accumulation of trehalose as high-viscosity cells were not observed in the triple knockout ( Figure 4 F). Stationary phase, in which cell growth has stopped due to depletion of nutrients, also prompts accumulation of glycogen and trehalose ( Huang et al., 1997 23. Huang, D. ∙ Wilson, W.A. ∙ Roach, P.J. Glucose-6-P control of glycogen synthase phosphorylation in yeast J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 :22495-22501 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 A). Measuring diffusion in these cells revealed a 300% increase in t-half relative to cells in logarithmic growth with 2% glucose ( Figure 4 E). Together, our findings suggest that viscoadaptation is induced by short- and long-term starvation and that increased viscosity can be achieved through production of glycogen without a requirement for trehalose in the case of acute glucose starvation.
To better understand the potential for glycogen and trehalose to directly affect cellular viscosity during stress, we characterized viscosity, diffusion, and phase behavior in aqueous glycogen and trehalose solutions. Both glycogen and trehalose were sufficient to slow the diffusion of GFP with a combination of both carbohydrates showing the largest effect ( Figure 5 A). We next examined how diffusion in the same solutions was affected by temperature. Intriguingly, the diffusion rate was temperature sensitive in all solutions except 45% trehalose in which the t-half of GFP was unchanged between 22°C and 40°C ( Figure 5 A). Temperature-insensitive diffusion appears to be a unique property of trehalose solutions with potential implications for viscoadaptation. A 4-fold dilution of a glycogen and trehalose solution corresponded to a 42-fold reduction in viscosity ( Figure 5 B), consistent with LiCl treatment causing robust disequalization of the BirA reaction rate at 30°C and 37°C in vivo ( Figure 3 E) while only partially decreasing glycogen and trehalose accumulation ( Figure S3 D).
Large complexes often move sub-diffusively (“anonymous diffusion”) due to steric hindrance in the crowded cellular environment ( Luby-Phelps et al., 1986 35. Luby-Phelps, K. ∙ Taylor, D.L. ∙ Lanni, F. Probing the structure of cytoplasm J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102 :2015-2022 Crossref Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ; Seksek et al., 1997 57. Seksek, O. ∙ Biwersi, J. ∙ Verkman, A.S. Translational diffusion of macromolecule-sized solutes in cytoplasm and nucleus J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138 :131-142 Crossref Scopus (429) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that glycogen and trehalose cause diffusion to become sub-diffusive for some molecules. Subdiffusive movement was only observed in the most concentrated aqueous solutions of glycogen and trehalose (30% and 45%, respectively) ( Figure S5 A), and in general the type of diffusion was independent of growth temperature ( Figure S5 A) and the ability to synthesize glycogen and trehalose ( Figure S5 A). We conclude that changes in mobility caused by glycogen and trehalose are more likely a consequence of increased viscosity than anomalous diffusion.
Trehalose undergoes an abrupt liquid-to-solid phase transition, which dramatically restricts molecular movement and is adaptive in certain biological contexts ( Buitink and Leprince, 2004 6. Buitink, J. ∙ Leprince, O. Glass formation in plant anhydrobiotes: survival in the dry state Cryobiology. 2004; 48 :215-228 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, viscoadaptation appears to be a tunable, graded response. We therefore tested whether the presence of glycogen could modify the propensity of trehalose to undergo phase transition in vitro . In the absence of glycogen, droplets of an aqueous trehalose solution underwent a concentration-dependent liquid-to-solid phase transition ( Figure 5 C). Droplets containing only glycogen evaporated without undergoing phase transition, and droplets containing both glycogen and trehalose acquired an intermediate, gel-like state, which remained malleable hours after the trehalose-only droplets had solidified ( Figures 5 D and S5 B). These results indicate that glycogen can modify the phase behavior of trehalose, preventing abrupt phase transitions.
In comparison to trehalose, glycogen is poorly soluble in water, and it has been observed to aggregate into insoluble granules in healthy and diseased states ( Kerly, 1930 30. Kerly, M. The solubility of glycogen Biochem. J. 1930; 24 :67-76 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Palmucci et al., 1983 43. Palmucci, L. ∙ Anzil, A.P. ∙ Luh, S. Crystalline aggregates of protein-glycogen complexes (alias ‘virus-like particles’) in skeletal muscle: report of a case and review of the literature Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1983; 9 :61-71 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rybicka, 1979 55. Rybicka, K. Glycosomes (protein-glycogen complex) in the canine heart. Ultrastructure, histochemistry and changes induced by acidic treatment Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1979; 30 :335-347 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). When performing FRAP on glycogen solutions, we observed that the distribution of GFP was irregular ( Figure 5 E), and GFP fluorescence was reduced relative to the equivalent GFP concentration in water. Addition of trehalose (45%) resulted in a more homogeneous GFP distribution and a partial restoration of fluorescence ( Figure 5 E). The fluorescence of exogenous GFP was also reduced in lysates from cells heat shocked at 42°C relative to lysates from unstressed cells ( Figure S5 C).
Together these data indicate that glycogen and trehalose impact the biophysical properties of solutions in distinct and complementary ways. Glycogen has a graded impact on viscosity with a larger effect per mass than trehalose but promotes loss of homogeneity of GFP fluorescence in solution. Trehalose has a comparatively low impact on the viscosity of solutions but can undergo an abrupt liquid-to-solid phase transition. Interactions between the two molecules reduce the tendency of glycogen to alter the fluorescence distribution of GFP and guard against abrupt phase transitions of trehalose. These complementary properties may make glycogen and trehalose effective in increasing viscosity while preserving the solubility of biomolecules.
Rapidly changing the composition and viscosity of the intracellular environment could affect myriad cellular processes, including phase separation and the solubility of biomolecules. Indeed, restricted molecular mobility caused by ribosome crowding has been shown to impact phase separation in an in vivo and in vitro synthetic system ( Delarue et al., 2018 9. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 Controls Phase Separation and the Biophysical Properties of the Cytoplasm by Tuning Crowding Cell. 2018; 174 :338-349 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated the impact of viscoadaptation on in vivo phase separation by examining the formation and dissolution of stress granules (SGs). SGs are condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of endogenous nucleic acids and proteins during stress ( Protter and Parker, 2016 50. Protter, D.S.W. ∙ Parker, R. Principles and Properties of Stress Granules Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26 :668-679 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1030) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that changing the biophysical properties of the cytosol in viscoadaptation could affect SG formation. To test this, we tracked SG formation after heat shock with and without LiCl using Pab1-GFP as an SG marker. LiCl treatment (which impairs viscoadaptation) resulted in a more rapid appearance of SGs, suggesting that viscoadaptation could impede SG formation ( Figure 6 A). Consistent with this, a condition that enhances viscoadaptation (low biotin versus normal biotin in 0% glucose) reduced the formation of SGs ( Figure S6 A). We tested whether viscoadaptation also affects the rate of SG dissolution by treating heat-shocked cells with Validamycin A. Drug treatment hastened the disappearance of SGs relative to the untreated control, suggesting that higher trehalose after stress promotes disassembly of SGs ( Figure S6 B). These findings raise the possibility that viscoadaptation plays a previously unappreciated role in phase separation in cells.
Aberrant phase separation is associated with aggregate formation and loss of molecular solubility. While working with lysates from severely heat-shocked cells (45°C for 30 min), we observed the formation of macroscopic ovoid inclusions ( Figure 6 B). Notably, these inclusions only appeared in lysates from heat-shocked cells, and their formation was prevented by loss of Tps2 ( Figure 6 B), implicating trehalose. Knockout of glycogen synthesis machinery did not prevent inclusion formation, but double knockout of TPS2 and GLC3 failed to form inclusions entirely ( Figure 6 B). To investigate the phase of the inclusions, we performed microrheology on regions interior and exterior to the structures. Interior regions showed a complete loss of mobility, while exterior regions had much lower viscosities ( Figure 6 C). We mechanically probed the inclusions with magnetic beads to further determine their structure. Beads moved easily through regions without inclusions but became immobile within inclusions. We conclude that lysates from severely heat-shocked cells separate into distinct liquid and solid components in a manner dependent on Tps2.
Because the phase of lysates from severely heat-shocked cells is heterogeneous, we predicted that the rate of BirA labeling in these lysates and their measured viscosities would not correspond. Consistent with this, biotinylation was 80% slower in lysates from severely heat-shocked cells relative to lysates from unstressed cells ( Figure 6 D); yet the viscosities in liquid regions of lysates were not significantly different from those of unstressed lysates ( Figure S6 C). When lysates were diluted in water, inclusions no longer formed ( Figure S6 D), and the BirA reaction rate became equivalent in all conditions ( Figure 6 E). We propose that strong viscoadaptation in severe heat shock results in unstable phase behavior in cell lysates.
Inclusion formation in lysates from severely heat-shocked cells suggested that high levels of glycogen or trehalose could affect the solubility of biomolecules. To examine this possibility in vivo , we generated a GFP-expressing strain lacking the nutrient-sensing protein Reg1. reg1Δ cells have constitutively high glycogen and trehalose ( Huang et al., 1996 22. Huang, D. ∙ Chun, K.T. ∙ Goebl, M.G. ... Genetic interactions between REG1/HEX2 and GLC7, the gene encoding the protein phosphatase type 1 catalytic subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genetics. 1996; 143 :119-127 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 E) and a growth defect that is suppressed by loss of glycogen synthesis machinery ( Ruiz et al., 2011 53. Ruiz, A. ∙ Xu, X. ∙ Carlson, M. Roles of two protein phosphatases, Reg1-Glc7 and Sit4, and glycogen synthesis in regulation of SNF1 protein kinase Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :6349-6354 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used FRAP to characterize the mobility of GFP in the reg1Δ strain and found the average t-half to be higher than in wild type (WT), consistent with glycogen and trehalose increasing cellular viscosity ( Figure S6 F). As a proxy for solubility, we determined the mobile fraction of GFP. The mobile fraction is a measure of the extent of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching rather than the rate of recovery ( Figure S6 G). If loss of GFP solubility causes its aggregation, this will be reflected in a decrease in the GFP mobile fraction. Consistent with this, 60% of reg1Δ cells in logarithmic growth had a mobile fraction below 0.8 compared to only 8% in the WT population ( Figure 6 F).
The increase in immobile GFP in the reg1Δ strain suggests that high levels of glycogen and trehalose could decrease protein solubility. However, similar accumulation during severe stress increases fitness ( François and Parrou, 2001 14. François, J. ∙ Parrou, J.L. Reserve carbohydrates metabolism in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25 :125-145 Crossref Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Wilson et al., 2010 72. Wilson, W.A. ∙ Roach, P.J. ∙ Montero, M. ... Regulation of glycogen metabolism in yeast and bacteria FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 34 :952-985 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this, despite having higher absolute levels of glycogen and trehalose ( Figure S6 F), reg1Δ cells in stationary phase were less likely to have a mobile fraction below 0.8 than reg1Δ cells in log phase (14.5% and 60%, respectively) ( Figure 6 F) suggesting that the context of carbohydrate accumulation modifies its effect on protein solubility. We propose that accumulation of glycogen and trehalose in viscoadaptation has widespread effects on biophysical processes in the cell such as molecular solubility and phase separation and that “cellular context” (e.g., growth phase) can modulate these effects.
We reasoned that both heat and nutrient deprivation, two seemingly disparate stressors, may trigger viscoadaptation through a common signal. Both types of stress cause loss of intracellular ATP ( Bermejo et al., 2010 3. Bermejo, C. ∙ Haerizadeh, F. ∙ Takanaga, H. ...

Patriarca, E.J. ∙ Maresca, B.

The cytoplasmic pH, ATP content and total protein synthesis rate during heat-shock protein inducing treatments in yeast Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170 :64-79 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore investigated whether viscoadaptation could be triggered by pharmacological perturbations that reduce ATP levels. Treating cells with the metabolic poisons sodium azide, sodium arsenite, or a combination of Antimycin A, Oligomycin, and FCCP all lowered ATP and increased intracellular viscosity ( Figures 7 A and S7 B). Furthermore, these viscosity changes were fully or partially prevented by treatment with LiCl, implicating viscoadaptation as a likely mechanism ( Figure 7 A).
To examine the relationship between viscosity and ATP in single cells, we used a genetically encoded FRET-based ATP sensor where a higher 528:488 nm emission ratio is indicative of higher ATP concentration ( Bermejo et al., 2010 3. Bermejo, C. ∙ Haerizadeh, F. ∙ Takanaga, H. ... Dynamic analysis of cytosolic glucose and ATP levels in yeast using optical sensors Biochem. J. 2010; 432 :399-406 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Imamura et al., 2009 25. Imamura, H. ∙ Nhat, K.P.H. ∙ Togawa, H. ... Visualization of ATP levels inside single living cells with fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based genetically encoded indicators Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :15651-15656 Crossref Scopus (798) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 A). By performing FRAP on the ATP sensor, we were able to measure ATP and diffusion in the same cells. Higher viscosity correlated with decreasing ATP content in conditions that prompt viscoadaptation (low glucose with regular biotin [ Figure 7 B] and 0% glucose with low biotin [ Figure S7 C]) but did not hold for cells in 0% glucose with regular biotin ( Figure 7 C), where viscoadaptation does not occur. Thus, ATP levels and intracellular diffusion are correlated in conditions where viscoadaptation takes place.
If low ATP triggers viscoadaptation, then impairing viscoadaptation should alter the relationship between ATP and viscosity. Treatment with LiCl reduced the strength of the correlation between viscosity and ATP in low glucose (r = −0.6 without LiCl and −0.36 with LiCl) ( Figure 7 B). We also performed FRAP on the ATP sensor in glycogen-deficient cells and observed a population of cells with low ATP and high mobility (“non-responders”) and a population with low ATP and very low mobility (“hyper-responders”) ( Figure S7 C). These populations mirror the variable viscosities observed in glycogen-deficient strains ( Figure 3 C). Notably, hyper-responders had higher ATP than non-responders, suggesting that low viscosity may conserve energy. Prior work has demonstrated that ATP can act as a hydrotrope, keeping proteins soluble in cells and potentially affecting their mobility ( Patel et al., 2017 45. Patel, A. ∙ Malinovska, L. ∙ Saha, S. ... ATP as a biological hydrotrope Science. 2017; 356 :753-756 Crossref Scopus (600) PubMed Google Scholar ). The concurrence of low ATP and fast diffusion in the “non-responder” population of glycogen-deficient cells, however, indicates that low ATP does not directly cause low mobility ( Figure S7 C).
If low ATP is sufficient to prompt viscoadaptation, then stochastic drops in ATP in the absence of stress should also lead to increased viscosity. We measured diffusion in unstressed cells with a range of naturally occurring ATP levels. Once again lower ATP correlated with higher viscosity (r = −0.6, p < 0.0001) ( Figure 7 D), consistent with a model in which low ATP triggers viscoadaptation. This correlation could reflect direct stabilization of the “open” (low ATP) conformation of the sensor by high viscosity. We therefore created a condition predicted to have high ATP and high viscosity by shifting cells from growth at 37°C to measurement at 22°C, creating a temporary mismatch between glycogen and trehalose content and temperature. As predicted, cells measured after this temperature shift had both high ATP and high viscosity ( Figure 7 D). We conclude that the ATP sensor operates reliably in the relevant range of viscosities and that stochastic drops in ATP are linked to viscoadaptation.
If low ATP triggers viscoadaptation, ATP loss should precede viscosity change. We tracked ATP and t-half values for individual cells over 60 min of temperature increase (22°C–40°C). ATP levels began to drop after 10 min (∼33°C), while t-half values did not start increasing until 18–25 min (36°C–38°C), consistent with a causal relationship in which viscoadaptation occurs in response to ATP loss ( Figure 7 E). Collectively these findings link energy availability to control of cellular viscosity and suggest that low ATP may be a trigger for viscoadaptation.

Section: Discussion

This work reveals that cells broadly modulate intracellular diffusion through the regulated production of glycogen and trehalose (“viscoadaptation”). This viscosity regulation counters the effect of increased temperature on molecular diffusion and slows diffusion when ATP levels are low (starvation, mitochondrial damage, and stochastic drops in ATP). The homeostatic nature of viscosity control makes it unlikely that viscoadaptation is a chance byproduct of glycogen and trehalose accumulation. Furthermore, yeast grown at 37°C produce glycogen and trehalose yet fail to show classic signs of stress (e.g., slow growth) ( Mühlhofer et al., 2019 39. Mühlhofer, M. ∙ Berchtold, E. ∙ Stratil, C.G. ... The Heat Shock Response in Yeast Maintains Protein Homeostasis by Chaperoning and Replenishing Proteins Cell Rep. 2019; 29 :4593-4607 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the stress-protectant functions ascribed to glycogen and trehalose (energy reserve and molecular chaperone, respectively) may be unnecessary in this condition. We propose that cytosolic viscosity is a finely tunable cellular property and that viscosity regulation is an important function of glycogen and trehalose.
Additional mechanisms for regulating the mobility of biomolecules in cells have been described by others, including crowding-based mechanisms ( Delarue et al., 2018 9. Delarue, M. ∙ Brittingham, G.P. ∙ Pfeffer, S. ... mTORC1 Controls Phase Separation and the Biophysical Properties of the Cytoplasm by Tuning Crowding Cell. 2018; 174 :338-349 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ; Joyner et al., 2016 29.

A glucose-starvation response regulates the diffusion of macromolecules eLife. 2016; 5 :5 Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar ), the assembly of stress-induced condensates ( Franzmann et al., 2018 15. Franzmann, T.M. ∙ Jahnel, M. ∙ Pozniakovsky, A. ... Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness Science. 2018; 359 :359 Crossref Scopus (445) Google Scholar ), and pH-induced protein polymerization ( Munder et al., 2016 41. Munder, M.C. ∙ Midtvedt, D. ∙ Franzmann, T. ... A pH-driven transition of the cytoplasm from a fluid- to a solid-like state promotes entry into dormancy eLife. 2016; 5 :5 Crossref Scopus (304) Google Scholar ). Some conditions that induce viscoadaptation may also induce these responses. However, viscoadaptation is phenomenologically and mechanistically distinct. Of these responses, only viscoadaptation affects mobility on the size scale of individual proteins or implicates glycogen and trehalose in the control of protein diffusion. In addition, viscoadaptation is unique in serving as both a homeostatic mechanism and an acute response to stress.
The discovery of viscoadaptation does not conflict with any of the proposed cellular functions of glycogen or trehalose but may inform previous observations in important ways. For example, viscoadaptation may be relevant to previously described phenomena including conversion of the bacterial cytoplasm into a “glassy” state with low metabolic activity ( Parry et al., 2014 44. Parry, B.R. ∙ Surovtsev, I.V. ∙ Cabeen, M.T. ... The bacterial cytoplasm has glass-like properties and is fluidized by metabolic activity Cell. 2014; 156 :183-194 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (566) PubMed Google Scholar ) and changes in the viscosity of cancer cells, which often store high levels of glycogen ( Guyer and Claus, 1942 18. Guyer, M.F. ∙ Claus, P.E. Increased Viscosity of Cells of Induced Tumors Cancer Res. 1942; 2 :16-18 Google Scholar ; Rousset et al., 1981 52. Rousset, M. ∙ Zweibaum, A. ∙ Fogh, J.

A mitochondria targetable and viscosity sensitive fluorescent probe and its applications for distinguishing cancerous cells Dyes Pigm. 2019; 168 :134-139 Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the existence of viscoadaptation reveals that cytosolic viscosity may be an important but overlooked parameter in models of stress-induced phase separation. Many such models focus on changes in the biophysical properties of condensates while assuming the state of the greater cellular environment to be relatively constant ( Alberti, 2017 1. Alberti, S.

Biological phase separation: cell biology meets biophysics Biophys. Rev. 2020; 12 :519-539 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Going forward it will be important to consider the potential impact of changing cytosolic viscosity on the formation and regulation of phase separated compartments.
Viscosity “buffering” in a changing environment may be adaptive by tuning the rates of diffusion-controlled molecular interactions, chemical reactions, signaling cascades, kinetic proofreading, and the assembly and disassembly of complexes. Furthermore, slowing cellular processes on a large scale could conserve energy when nutrients are scarce. Consistent with this, trehalose accumulation in dormant plant spores causes loss of molecular mobility with a large corresponding drop in metabolic activity ( Buitink and Leprince, 2004 6. Buitink, J. ∙ Leprince, O. Glass formation in plant anhydrobiotes: survival in the dry state Cryobiology. 2004; 48 :215-228 Crossref Scopus (287) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, viscoadaptation may be a strategy to reduce energy expenditure while maintaining critical cellular functions.
In heat, both glycogen and trehalose were required for viscoadaptation, whereas only glycogen was required in acute glucose deprivation. Trehalose is produced exclusively by non-homeothermic organisms ( Elbein et al., 2003 12. Elbein, A.D. ∙ Pan, Y.T. ∙ Pastuszak, I. ... New insights on trehalose: a multifunctional molecule Glycobiology. 2003; 13 :17R-27R Crossref Scopus (1574) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with its role in buffering diffusion against temperature changes, whereas glycogen synthesis is conserved in humans ( Thon et al., 1993 68. Thon, V.J. ∙ Khalil, M. ∙ Cannon, J.F. Isolation of human glycogen branching enzyme cDNAs by screening complementation in yeast J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 :7509-7513 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the possibility that glycogen enables viscoadaptation in homeothermic organisms such as mammals.

All yeast strains were in the BY4741 S288C background. Strains were grown at the indicated temperatures in synthetic complete or dropout media with 2% glucose according to the recipe provided by Hanscho et al. ( Hanscho et al., 2012 19. Hanscho, M. ∙ Ruckerbauer, D.E. ∙ Chauhan, N. ... Nutritional requirements of the BY series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for optimum growth FEMS Yeast Res. 2012; 12 :796-808 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). For biotinylation experiments yeast were grown in low biotin SD complete media with 2% glucose (Sunrise Science -biotin YNB) supplemented with 0.5 nM d-biotin.
Deletion strains were constructed via transformation with PCR products containing antibiotic resistance cassettes ( NATMX6 , HYGMX6, or KANMX6 ). PCR products contained 40bp of homology to the 5′ and 3′ genomic regions immediately adjacent to the gene to be deleted. Cytosolic BirA was integrated at the LEU2 locus driven by a PGK1 promoter. BirA fusion proteins contain a 120 residue intrinsically disordered linker. Transformants were verified by genomic PCR.
Plasmids used in this study were cloned by the Gibson Assembly method using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs).
For cell lysate preparation 1-2 L of log phase culture was vacuum filtered to remove media and cells were “flash frozen” by rapid submersion in liquid nitrogen. Cells in frozen pellets were then lysed by mechanical grinding into a fine powder with a Spex 6750 Freezer Mill at a rate of 10 for 1 minute. The powder was allowed to thaw with gentle shaking at 4°C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and subjected to a second spin at 16,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was once again removed and used directly in lysate experiments or stored at −80°C for later use.
For in vivo biotinylation reactions, cells expressing BirA under the PGK1 promoter and an Avi-tagged substrate under a variable promoter were grown in low biotin media (0.5 nM biotin) to an OD of 0.4-0.6. The genomically integrated BirA strain and the BirA tagging plasmid were a gift from Calvin Jan at Calico. The BirA reaction was initiated by addition of biotin (SUPELCO #47868) to a final concentration of 1 μM. All samples were corrected for background labeling (labeling prior to the biotin pulse) by comparison to a no biotin-pulse control. Cells were collected by spinning down 1 mL of OD 0.4-0.6 culture, removing the media and resuspending the cell pellet in 12-15 ul 4x NuPage LDS Sample Buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled at 95°C for five minutes to ensure denaturation and used immediately in gel shift assays or stored at −20°C.
For in vitro biotinylation assays, lysates from cells expressing Avi-tagged substrates were prepared as described above. In vitro labeling experiments were conducted using the Avidity BirA biotin-protein ligase standard reaction kit (Avidity BirA500) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Each reaction used 13 uL of lysate with 0.5 uL mix A, 0.5 uL mix B, and 0.25 uL BirA enzyme. After collection of a no biotin control (time 0), reactions were initiated by addition of 0.2 uL of d-biotin, provided in the kit, and pipetted twice quickly to mix. Subsequent samples were collected at the indicated time points by mixing 2 uL of the reaction mixture with 6 ul of boiling 4x NuPage LDS Sample Buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 additional minutes. Samples were used immediately in gel shift assays or frozen at −20°C.
Samples for quantification of biotinylation were allowed to cool for at least 10 minutes after boiling. 6 ul of boiled sample was combined with 1.5 ul streptavidin (Invitrogen #434302 at 10 ug/uL), vortexed briefly, and loaded into an Invitrogen SDS-PAGE 1.5 mm 4%–12% Bis-Tris gel. Gels were run for 2 hours at 4°C and 110V in 1x MOPS running buffer. Transfer was performed onto nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad Turbo Blot). Membranes were blocked for 30 minutes in 5% milk in TBST and then incubated with mouse anti-HA primary antibody (antiHA-12C5 Roche #11583816001) in 5% milk in TBST with gentle shaking overnight at 4°C. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed three times in TBST for a total of 15 minutes and incubated at room temperature with IRDye 800CW Goat anti-Mouse IgG Secondary Antibody (1:5000, Li-Cor #926-32210) in 5% milk in TBST for 1 hour. Blots were imaged on a Li-Cor gel imager and band intensities were quantified using ImageStudioLite. All ratiometric analyses are the intensity of the top band divided by the intensity of the bottom band plus the intensity of the top band in a given lane.
Cytoplasmic area (excluding vacuoles) in yeast expressing GFP was measured using imageJ. Briefly, cell images were converted to binary masks based on GFP fluorescence distribution using automated thresholding. The resulting mask was designated as a selection and the area of the selection determined using the measure area tool. Images were taken at the largest cross-section of each cell, and cell buds were not included in size measurements.
Microrheology experiments were performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope using an oil immersion 40x objective. Lysates were mixed with 0.5 um fluorescent beads (488 nm/512 nm). Chamber slides were prepared using double sided tape to delineate the chamber width (1 cm) and depth (100 um). Beads (Fluospheres, 2% solids) were added to lysates at a final dilution of 1:5,000 and ∼20 ul of the bead-lysate mixture was loaded into the chamber. Open ends were sealed with tape to prevent evaporation and slides were allowed to rest 10 minutes before measurement to minimize transient effects of sample loading on bead movement. The focal plane was chosen to be halfway between the slide and coverslip (50 um from either surface of the chamber) and X and Y positions were centered in the chamber to avoid boundary effects. 500 images were collected over a total of 30 s at 5x zoom using a 488 laser at a power of 6%.
Particle tracking was done using Particle Tracker 2D/3D in the Imagej Mosaic plug-in. Particle detection settings were as follows: Radius 3, Cutoff 0.001, Per/Abs 0.15. Particle linking parameters were as follows: Link Range 2, Displacement 10, Dynamics: Brownian. Trajectories ≤ 20 frames were eliminated from the analysis to reduce noise. Diffusion coefficients extracted from multiple trajectories in the same frame were averaged. For analysis of anomalous diffusion the slope of the Moment Scaling Spectrum (sMSS) for each trajectory was recorded. The value of the sMSS is related to the degree and direction of departure from “perfect” diffusion in which the mean-squared displacement of a particle increases linearly with time ( Arts et al., 2019 2. Arts, M. ∙ Smal, I. ∙ Paul, M.W. ... Particle Mobility Analysis Using Deep Learning and the Moment Scaling Spectrum Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :17160 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oliveira et al., 2019 42. Oliveira, F.A. ∙ Ferreira, R.M.S. ∙ Lapas, L.C. ... Anomalous Diffusion: A Basic Mechanism for the Evolution of Inhomogeneous Systems Front. Phys. 2019; 7 :18 Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar ).
For small cultures (< 10 ml) heat shock experiments were performed by centrifugation to pellet cultures followed by removal of media and resuspension in media pre-heated to the appropriate temperature. Cultures were then placed in an incubator at the required temperature for the duration of the heat shock treatment.
For heat shock of large cultures (≥1 L) pre-existing media was removed by vacuum filtration of cells onto nitrocellulose membrane. The resulting cell paste was quickly scraped from the membrane and resuspended in preheated media. Flasks were then shaken in pre-warmed incubators for the duration of the heat shock treatment.
For FRAP experiments in heat shock, cells were placed on slides coated with Concavalin A (to prevent movement) and entered into a microscope chamber pre-warmed to the appropriate temperature. A given time course corresponds to a single slide being imaged repeatedly over time in the heated microscope chamber.
FRAP experiments were carried out on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope using a 40x oil immersion objective. For in vivo measurements, 100 images were taken at 11x zoom with one cycle of bleaching occurring after the second image. Images were separated by 52 ms. Per cell, one bleach zone, one control zone within the cell, and one background zone outside the cell were specified (all circular). Bleach and control zones were chosen such that the circular ROI touched the cell wall at one point only, and regions were selected to be homogeneous in their fluorescence intensity. Nuclei could often be discerned by increased fluorescence intensity and were avoided when choosing a bleach location. Within these parameters bleached regions varied in their location within the cytoplasm. We did not observe systematic differences in t-half based on the exact location of bleaching within the cytoplasm. In vivo FRAP experiments used for t-half calculations (see below) had ROIs of a constant size (600 nm diameter) for bleached and control spots. Background ROIs were sometimes larger. FRAP experiments analyzed for diffusion coefficients with the program simFRAP (see below) did not necessarily have bleached ROIs of constant size. simFRAP was used because determination of the diffusion coefficient with this method is independent of ROI size and geometry ( Blumenthal et al., 2015 4. Blumenthal, D. ∙ Goldstien, L. ∙ Edidin, M. ... Universal Approach to FRAP Analysis of Arbitrary Bleaching Patterns Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :11655 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Except for experiments in which the mobile fraction was being compared, any measurement with a mobile fraction below 0.8 was not included in analyses. These were uncommon and potentially indicated that a region intersected a cellular compartment rather than being purely cytosolic. For time course experiments measurements taken plus or minus one minute of the indicated time point were binned.
For in vitro measurements, we used purified GFP (Chromtek, eGFP-250) at a concentration of 0.085 mg/mL (1 μL GFP into 10 μL lysate). The size of the bleached ROI was ∼40 um. For lysate and solution measurements, between 200 and 1000 images were taken at 1x zoom, depending on the rate of recovery. Bleaching occurred after the second image using 100% laser power in the 405 nm, 456 nm, and 488 nm channels. Images were separated by 120 ms. Bleach zones, control zones, and background zones were circular. All raw movies are at 1x speed.
Of note, for technical reasons the lysates used in Figure 2 E were diluted approximately 5% relative to the lysates used in Figure 2 A. Therefore, comparisons should be made within these datasets rather than between them.
The imageJ bioformats package was used to open .czi stacks. For t-half analysis intensity values for each region at each time point were extracted using the multi-measure tool set to “mean gray value.” Values were saved in excel spreadsheets in the format [column 1: time in seconds]: [column 2: intensity of bleach ROI]: [column 3: intensity of control ROI]: [column 4: intensity of background ROI]. For in vitro experiments, the intensity of the background ROI was set to 0 for all time points since background did not apply as defined in this case. Spreadsheets were saved as either .xlsx or .czi files and were uploaded into easyFRAP, an open-source online FRAP analysis program ( Koulouras et al., 2018 31. Koulouras, G. ∙ Panagopoulos, A. ∙ Rapsomaniki, M.A. ... EasyFRAP-web: a web-based tool for the analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W467-W472 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), to calculate the mobile fraction, t-half, and R-squared values for each photobleaching experiment. Gap ratio and bleaching depth were used to determine the quality of the measurement. Images with a gap ratio below 0.6 or a bleaching depth below 0.2 were not included in the analyses. Example movies for FRAP experiments are provided via Mendeley in Data S1 along with traces and raw data spreadsheets. The full set of raw data used for easyFRAP analysis is provided in Data S2.
For determination of diffusion coefficients from FRAP experiments, we made use of the Fiji plug-in simFRAP according to developers’ instructions ( Blumenthal et al., 2015 4. Blumenthal, D. ∙ Goldstien, L. ∙ Edidin, M. ... Universal Approach to FRAP Analysis of Arbitrary Bleaching Patterns Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :11655 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of in vivo experiments the bleached cell, bleached region, and an unbleached reference cell were specified using the simFRAP interface. The inter-image time was 0.05 s and the pixel aspect ratio was 0.15. For in vitro experiments, region selection was modified slightly to accommodate the change in experiment type. The bleached region was in the center of the image and was specified as before, the unbleached reference cell was a circular region in a corner of the image, and the bleached cell was set as the circle of largest circumference that would fit in the square image and included the bleached region but excluded the unbleached reference region. The inter-image time was 0.12 s and the pixel aspect ratio was 1.66. Raw data movies for simFRAP analysis are provided via Mendeley in Data S3.
Cycloheximide (Calbiochem #239764) was used at a final concentration of 50 ug/ml. Sodium azide (Sigma #2002) and sodium arsenite (Sigma #7400) were used at final concentrations of 0.15 mM and 2 mM, respectively. Antimycin A (Sigma #A8674), oligomycin (Sigma #75351), and FCCP (Cayman Chemical #15218) were used in combination at 10 μM, 0.1 μM, and 50 nM, respectively. Cycloheximide was added 10 minutes prior to the start of the experiment; all other drugs were added 30 minutes prior to the start of the experiment.
Validamycin A (GoldBio, #V-170-1) and 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-Arabinitol (DAB) (Cayman Chemical Company, #20939) were both used at 1 ug/mL. Validamycin was made fresh as a 1 mg/mL stock in H 2 0 before each experiment, and DAB was used from a pre-made stock of 10 mg/mL in DMSO. DAB and Validamycin A were added to cultures immediately prior to transfer to slides and the initiation of heat shock. Heat shock was for 45 minutes in a microscope chamber pre-heated to 42°C after which slides were transferred to room temperature to recover. FRAP measurements or images of Pab1-GFP were collected after the indicated recovery period.
Qualitative iodine staining experiments (see Figure S3 D) were adapted from the method described by ( Demonte et al., 2014 10. Demonte, A.M. ∙ Asención Diez, M.D. ∙ Guerrero, S.A. ... Iodine staining of Escherichia coli expressing genes involved in the synthesis of bacterial glycogen Bio-protocol. 2014; 4 :e1224 Crossref Google Scholar ). Briefly, cell spots for iodine staining were made by pipetting 1 mL of log phase (OD 0.4 - OD 0.6) culture onto nitrocellulose membrane using a round stencil as a guide (approx. 8 mm diameter). Media was pulled through the membrane by vacuum filtration leaving a layer of cells on the membrane. The membrane was then placed on a glass slide (to avoid direct contact between the iodine and the membrane) and onto a layer of iodine crystals in a closed chamber. Membranes were allowed to stain for 10 minutes in the chamber and then removed. Spot color generally began to decrease after removal from the iodine chamber so images were not taken until the color of all spots remained stable for 5 minutes (generally ∼15 minutes after removal from the iodine chamber). Any spots to be compared were made on the same membrane to minimize variability in the staining conditions. Qualitative differences in glycogen content were determined by the color of each spot, with darker spots corresponding to cells with more glycogen. Spots were imaged using an iphone.
Trehalose was measured using the Trehalose Assay Kit (K-TREH) from Megazyme. Manufacturer’s instructions were followed with the following exceptions: samples were collected in pre-weighed microcentrifuge tubes by pelleting 1 mL of OD 0.4-0.6 culture followed by washing in 1 mL of glucose-free SD media to remove background glucose signal. After removal of the wash, microcentrifuge tubes were quickly re-weighed and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were used immediately or stored at −80°C until later use. To lyse the cells, 100 ul of boiling water was added directly to the frozen pellet with vigorous vortexing. Samples were boiled for 15 minutes with vortexing every 2 minutes then spun down in a table-top centrifuge for 3 minutes. The supernatant (roughly 100 uL) was transferred to new tubes. A second extraction of the pellet was performed using another 100 uL of boiling water with vortexing for 5 minutes. The second extraction was combined with the first extraction for a total of ∼200 uL.
The trehalose measurements were performed according to the Megazyme microplate protocol with all reagent volumes cut in half and 2 uL of sample per well. Every sample was measured in technical triplicate, and each experiment was performed in at least biological triplicate. Absorbance readings were taken using a Tecan Plate Reader and all values were normalized to the wet weight of the cell pellet.
Cells for quantitative glycogen measurement were collected as for trehalose measurements. Glycogen extraction and measurement protocols were used from ( Ewald et al., 2016 13. Ewald, J.C. ∙ Kuehne, A. ∙ Zamboni, N. ... The Yeast Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Routes Carbon Fluxes to Fuel Cell Cycle Progression Mol. Cell. 2016; 62 :532-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). 125 ul of 0.25 M sodium carbonate was added to the frozen cell pellet, which was then vortexed vigorously and incubated at 85°C for 4 hours with gentle shaking. Next, 75 ul of 1 M acetic acid, 300 ul sodium acetate (200 mM, p.H. 5.2), and 2 ul amyloglucosidase (from Aspergillus Niger, Sigma, 1000 U/ml) were added to each sample. Samples were mixed by pipetting and incubated at 60°C overnight (∼16 hours). Samples were centrifuged and the supernatants filtered using spin columns to remove cellular debris. Glucose released from glycogen digestion with amyloglucosidase was measured enzymatically using the Trehalose Assay Kit (Megazyme, K-TREH) without the trehalase.
Glucose measurements were performed using the Sigma High Sensitivity Glucose Assay Kit (MAK181, Sigma-Aldrich), according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, yeast pellets were prepared as for glycogen and trehalose measurements. Cells were lysed in the same manner as for trehalose measurements and 2 uL of supernatant was used per measurement. All samples were measured in technical duplicates with a minimum of three biological replicates.
Glycogen and trehalose solutions of the indicated concentrations were made in water using glycogen from oyster (Sigma #G8751) and trehalose dihydrate (EMD Millipore #625625). 40 uL droplets were made on parafilm at room temperature and left 8 hours, by which point trehalose-only droplets had solidified. Phase comparisons were done qualitatively by observing the response of the droplet to application of force with a pipette tip; droplets that dried out without retaining their 3-dimensional structure were considered not to have undergone phase transition. Droplets that distorted upon application of mechanical force without fracturing were categorized as gel-like, and droplets that fractured with application of mechanical force were categorized as solids (see Figure S5 B for examples).
For glucose starvation experiments of small cultures (< 10 mL), yeast were spun down in a tabletop centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 1 minute. Media was discarded and the cell pellet was washed once with glucose-free SD media, before being resuspended in the appropriate starvation media (either 0% glucose or 0.1% glucose). Cells were transferred to culture tubes and placed in a spinning wheel at 30°C for the duration of starvation.
For starvation of large cultures (1 L+), media exchange was performed using a vacuum filter flask as for heat shock of large cultures with the addition of one wash with 0.5 L of glucose-free media. The wash was performed after separation of cells from the previous growth media by flowing glucose-free media over cells adhered to the nitrocellulose membrane. After the wash cells were scraped from the membrane and resuspended in the appropriate starvation media. Flasks were shaken at 30°C for the duration of starvation.
ATP levels in single cells were measured using a FRET based nanosensor expressed from a cen/ars plasmid, pDR-GW AT1.03YEMK, which was a gift from Wolf Frommer (Addgene plasmid # 28004; http://www.addgene.org/28004 ; RRID:Addgene_28004). Single-cell FRET measurements were recorded on a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope using a 40x oil immersion objective. Excitation was provided at 405 nm and emissions were detected at 460 nm - 510 nm (encompassing 485 nm) and 520 nm - 560 nm (encompassing 535 nm). Data is given as a ratio of 535:485 signal intensity. The detector gain was set at 750 for the 535 nm channel and 650 for the 485 nm channel, chosen such that the 535 nm:485 nm ratio was roughly 1:1 in unstressed cells. Images were then taken following perturbation to the initial state. Cells were grown in -URA dropout SD media.
For the time course of viscosity and t-half ( Figure 7 E), cells expressing the ATP sensor started at room temperature (approx. 22°C) and were heated gradually in the microscope chamber to a final temperature of 40°C (approximately 40 minutes) at which they remained for the duration of the experiment. FRAP was performed on one cell every other minute over the course of 60 minutes. Three such time courses were collected in total.
T-half values for FRAP experiments were calculated by first extracting intensity and time information for each ROI using ImageJ with the bioformats package ( https://imagej.net/Bio-Formats ). FRAP movies were processed manually or through an identical automated process by way of an ImageJ macro (developed internally). Information extracted from FRAP movies was then processed to produce t-half values using the open-source web-based platform easyFRAP (described in more detail above) ( Koulouras et al., 2018 31. Koulouras, G. ∙ Panagopoulos, A. ∙ Rapsomaniki, M.A. ... EasyFRAP-web: a web-based tool for the analysis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching data Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W467-W472 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spreadsheets, organized by figure panel, sample, and replicate, are provided in via Mendeley in Data S2.
Diffusion coefficients were calculated directly from raw FRAP movies using the imagej plug-in simFRAP ( Blumenthal et al., 2015 4. Blumenthal, D. ∙ Goldstien, L. ∙ Edidin, M. ... Universal Approach to FRAP Analysis of Arbitrary Bleaching Patterns Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 :11655 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Movies are provided in Data S3 and are organized by figure panel, sample, and replicate.
Information on statistical analysis and replicates, including how replicates were defined for individual experiments, is included in figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism Version 8.4.
