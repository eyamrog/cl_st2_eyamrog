Title: Bifidobacteria-mediated immune system imprinting early in life


Abstract: Summary

Immune-microbe interactions early in life influence the risk of allergies, asthma, and other inflammatory diseases. Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host’s immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis- derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life.

Section: Introduction

Mounting evidence indicates that the composition of the infant gut microbiome is critical to immunological development, particularly during the first 3 months of life, when aberrations in gut microbial composition are most influential in impacting the developing immune system. Indeed, multiple studies have emphasized how early gut microbiome dysbiosis, described as an overabundance of proteobacteria ( Shin et al., 2015 83. Shin, N.-R. ∙ Whon, T.W. ∙ Bae, J.-W. Proteobacteria: microbial signature of dysbiosis in gut microbiota Trends Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :496-503 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) and loss of ecosystem function ( Duar et al., 2020a 31. Duar, R.M. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Integrating the ecosystem services framework to define dysbiosis of the breastfed infant gut: the role of B. infantis and human milk oligosaccharides Front. Nutr. 2020; 7 :33 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), is associated with both acute and chronic immune dysregulation, leading to common conditions such as colic ( Rhoads et al., 2018 72.

Pediatr. 2018; 203 :55-61.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), atopic wheeze and allergy ( Arrieta et al., 2015 7. Arrieta, M.-C. ∙ Stiemsma, L.T. ∙ Dimitriu, P.A. ..., CHILD Study Investigators Early infancy microbial and metabolic alterations affect risk of childhood asthma Sci. Transl.

Vatanen, T. ∙ Kostic, A.D. ∙ d’Hennezel, E. ..., DIABIMMUNE Study Group Variation in microbiome LPS immunogenicity contributes to autoimmunity in humans Cell. 2016; 165 :842-853 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Crohn’s disease ( Hviid et al., 2011 45. Hviid, A. ∙ Svanström, H. ∙ Frisch, M. Antibiotic use and inflammatory bowel diseases in childhood Gut. 2011; 60 :49-54 Crossref Scopus (324) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immune development has been poorly understood in humans due to the difficulty in obtaining samples from infants. Recent developments in systems immunology enable profiling of immune development at the systems level and unraveling of immune cell-regulatory relationships ( Davis and Brodin, 2018 28. Davis, M.M. ∙ Brodin, P. Rebooting human immunology Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :843-864 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Advances in sample processing mean that small-volume samples available from newborn infants are no longer prohibitive and as little as 100 μL of whole blood is sufficient for systems-level immunomonitoring ( Olin et al., 2018 68. Olin, A. ∙ Henckel, E. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Stereotypic immune system development in newborn children Cell. 2018; 174 :1277-1292.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously unraveled a postnatal adaptation by the newborn immune system to environmental exposures ( Olin et al., 2018 68. Olin, A. ∙ Henckel, E. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Stereotypic immune system development in newborn children Cell. 2018; 174 :1277-1292.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Dysbiosis of the infant gut microbiome is common in modern societies and a likely contributing factor to the increased incidences of immune-mediated disorders ( Dominguez-Bello et al., 2019 30. Dominguez-Bello, M.G. ∙ Godoy-Vitorino, F. ∙ Knight, R. ...

Sonnenburg, E.D. ∙ Sonnenburg, J.L. The ancestral and industrialized gut microbiota and implications for human health Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :383-390 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, there is great interest in identifying microbial factors that can support healthier immune system imprinting and hopefully prevent cases of allergy, autoimmunity, and possibly other conditions involving the immune system ( Renz and Skevaki, 2021 71. Renz, H. ∙ Skevaki, C. Early life microbial exposures and allergy risks: opportunities for prevention Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21 :177-191 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss of Bifidobacterium early in life has been associated with increased risk of developing autoimmunity, as seen in a birth cohort in Finland ( Vatanen et al., 2016 96. Vatanen, T. ∙ Kostic, A.D. ∙ d’Hennezel, E. ..., DIABIMMUNE Study Group Variation in microbiome LPS immunogenicity contributes to autoimmunity in humans Cell. 2016; 165 :842-853 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ) and atopic wheeze in another cohort in rural Ecuador ( Arrieta et al., 2018 8. Arrieta, M.-C. ∙ Arévalo, A. ∙ Stiemsma, L. ... Associations between infant fungal and bacterial dysbiosis and childhood atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized setting J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 142 :424-434.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, observational studies have identified a link between the loss of Bifidobacterium in infants and enteric inflammation early in life, but the mechanisms involved are elusive ( Henrick et al., 2019 43. Henrick, B.M. ∙ Chew, S. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Colonization by B. infantis EVC001 modulates enteric inflammation in exclusively breastfed infants Pediatr. Res. 2019; 86 :749-757 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rhoads et al., 2018 72. Rhoads, J.M. ∙ Collins, J. ∙ Fatheree, N.Y. ... Infant colic represents gut inflammation and dysbiosis J. Pediatr. 2018; 203 :55-61.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Human breastmilk contains abundant human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that are not digestible by humans as we lack the necessary glucosidases ( Sela and Mills, 2010 80. Sela, D.A. ∙ Mills, D.A. Nursing our microbiota: molecular linkages between bifidobacteria and milk oligosaccharides Trends Microbiol. 2010; 18 :298-307 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (293) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, the maternal energy spent to create such complex sugars is justified by providing a selective nutritional advantage to “beneficial” microbes specialized in metabolizing HMOs with evolutionarily important functions in the newborn. Bifidobacterium longum subspecies (subsp.) infantis ( B. infantis ) is one such strain adapted to metabolizing HMOs ( LoCascio et al., 2010 57. LoCascio, R.G. ∙ Desai, P. ∙ Sela, D.A. ...

Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis : champion colonizer of the infant gut Pediatr. Res. 2015; 77 :229-235 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). B. infantis is commonly found in breastfed infants in countries where incidence of immune-mediated disorders is low, such as Bangladesh ( Huda et al., 2014 44.

Stool microbiota and vaccine responses of infants Pediatrics. 2014; 134 :e362-e372 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Malawi ( Grześkowiak et al., 2012 40.

Maternal fucosyltransferase 2 status affects the gut bifidobacterial communities of breastfed infants Microbiome. 2015; 3 :13 Crossref Scopus (204) PubMed Google Scholar ). Introducing B. infantis has been successfully accomplished in strains such as EVC001 (Evolve BioSystems, Inc.), which is able to stably and persistently colonize and remodel the intestinal microbiome of breastfed infants ( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to reduced fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation ( Henrick et al., 2019 43. Henrick, B.M. ∙ Chew, S. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Colonization by B. infantis EVC001 modulates enteric inflammation in exclusively breastfed infants Pediatr. Res. 2019; 86 :749-757 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we extend previous findings by combining longitudinal systems immunology analyses and metagenomic profiling of 208 infants born in Stockholm, Sweden and find that depletion of bifidobacteria and, in particular, HMO-utilization genes from the fecal metagenome is associated with markers of both systemic and intestinal inflammation and immune dysregulation during the first months of life. We also demonstrate a silencing of intestinal inflammation in breastfed infants in California fed B. infantis EVC001, a strain harboring all fully functional HMO-utilization genes ( Duar et al., 2020a 31. Duar, R.M. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Integrating the ecosystem services framework to define dysbiosis of the breastfed infant gut: the role of B. infantis and human milk oligosaccharides Front. Nutr. 2020; 7 :33 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants skewed T cell polarization in vitro away from a T helper 2 (Th2) state and toward a Th1 state, and indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), 10-fold more abundant in feces from EVC001-treated children versus untreated controls, upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization in vitro . This molecular mechanism provides a functional link between beneficial microbes, their metabolites, and immunoregulation during the first critical months of life.

Section: Results

We analyzed longitudinal blood samples (n = 858) from infants (n = 208) born at the Karolinska University Hospital between April 2014 and December 2019 ( Olin et al., 2018 68. Olin, A. ∙ Henckel, E. ∙ Chen, Y. ... Stereotypic immune system development in newborn children Cell. 2018; 174 :1277-1292.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pou et al., 2019 69. Pou, C. ∙ Nkulikiyimfura, D. ∙ Henckel, E. ... The repertoire of maternal anti-viral antibodies in human newborns Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :591-596 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used mass cytometry and a panel of 44 antibodies ( Table S1 ) targeting activation and differentiation markers across 64 blood immune cell populations ( Figure 1 A). We also quantified 355 unique plasma proteins using Olink assays (Olink, Uppsala, Sweden) ( Lundberg et al., 2011 60. Lundberg, M. ∙ Eriksson, A. ∙ Tran, B. ... Homogeneous antibody-based proximity extension assays provide sensitive and specific detection of low-abundant proteins in human blood Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :e102 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and together these data elucidated developmental immune system changes postnatally.
When ordering immune cell-frequency measurements by day of sampling, we observed an initial innate response illustrated by the expansion of circulating monocytes that peaked 4–7 days after birth and a transient surge in circulating interferon γ (IFNγ) at days 0–3 as well as elevated levels of circulating interleukin 1RA (IL1RA), a natural inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory IL-1β, likely having a dampening effect on the initial innate response to microbial exposures during the first weeks after birth ( Figure 1 B). Following the initial monocyte expansion, we observed a gradual increase in the frequency of memory regulatory T cells (Tregs) frequency during the first weeks of life ( Figure 1 C). We also found a previously unrecognized contraction and subsequent expansion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) after birth ( Figure 1 C).
From 1 month onward there was a robust increase in circulating γδT cells, especially within the CD161 + subset of γδT cells ( Figure 1 D). These cells are important producers of IL-17A ( Maggi et al., 2010 61. Maggi, L. ∙ Santarlasci, V. ∙ Capone, M. ... CD161 is a marker of all human IL-17-producing T-cell subsets and is induced by RORC Eur. J. Immunol. 2010; 40 :2174-2181 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ), and increased plasma levels of IL-17A were seen during the same first 2-month time window, albeit transiently ( Figure 1 D). These findings indicate transient innate and adaptive immune responses but also highlight key regulatory mechanisms at play in early and mid infancy. These responses are presumably triggered by colonizing microbes similar to the weaning reaction described in mice ( Al Nabhani et al., 2019 4. Al Nabhani, Z. ∙ Dulauroy, S. ∙ Marques, R. ... A weaning reaction to microbiota is required for resistance to immunopathologies in the adult Immunity. 2019; 50 :1276-1288.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not triggered by weaning and noticeably different in postnatal timing as well as the immune cells and proteins involved.
Previous work has revealed that immune cells primed by antigens at mucosal surfaces circulate and are detectable in peripheral blood. Specifically, memory CD4 + T cells expressing CD38 and lacking the lymphoid tissue homing marker CD62L are mucosal-specific T cells in humans, originate in the intestine, and are identifiable in blood at a frequency of ∼4%–8% of total CD4 + T cells ( du Pré et al., 2011 33. du Pré, M.F. ∙ van Berkel, L.A. ∙ Ráki, M. ... CD62L(neg)CD38 + expression on circulating CD4 + T cells identifies mucosally differentiated cells in protein fed mice and in human celiac disease patients and controls Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2011; 106 :1147-1159 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we identified this subset of memory CD4 + T cells in the blood of newborn children, but these were more abundant and expanded during the first weeks of life to dominate the circulating memory CD4 + T cell pool ( Figure 1 E). These cells have downregulated CD45RA and have likely been exposed to antigen, presumably at mucosal surfaces in the intestine, and undergone memory phenotype transition.
To understand these mucosal-specific memory T cells better, we used flow cytometry sorting and bulk mRNA sequencing. We also sorted total memory CD4 + T cells from the same samples and calculated enriched blood transcriptional modules (BTMs) ( Li et al., 2014 54. Li, S. ∙ Rouphael, N. ∙ Duraisingham, S. ... Molecular signatures of antibody responses derived from a systems biology study of five human vaccines Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :195-204 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 F). The most enriched hallmark pathways in the mucosal-specific memory CD4 + T cells were type I and type II IFN responses ( Figure 1 F), and the most upregulated individual genes included complement regulatory factor H (CFH), the cytokine IL-15, important for natural killer (NK) cell homeostasis, as well as the macrophage colony stimulating MA factor CSF1 (M-CSF). Together, these results indicate that mucosal-specific memory CD4 + T cells see antigen after birth, expand in the blood, and interact with NK cells and monocytes in the newborn intestinal immune system.
To better understand the microbial antigens driving immune responses after birth, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of longitudinal fecal samples (n = 347) from 157 of the 208 infants in this cohort. Gut bacterial composition was highly variable at birth but increasingly converged over time ( Figure 2 A). At the family level, there was an increase in Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae after birth in the majority of newborns ( Figure 2 B). Bifidobacteriaceae expanded primarily in breastfed infants without antibiotic exposure ( Figure S1 ). This expansion was observed to involve multiple species of Bifidobacteriaceae, but most frequently B. longum , Bifidobacterium breve , and Bifidobacterium bifidum ( Figure 2 C). The expansion of bifidobacteria after birth is commonly seen during microbiome colonization according to previous reports ( Arrieta et al., 2015 7. Arrieta, M.-C. ∙ Stiemsma, L.T. ∙ Dimitriu, P.A. ..., CHILD Study Investigators Early infancy microbial and metabolic alterations affect risk of childhood asthma Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7 :307ra152 Crossref Scopus (728) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 8. Arrieta, M.-C. ∙ Arévalo, A. ∙ Stiemsma, L. ... Associations between infant fungal and bacterial dysbiosis and childhood atopic wheeze in a nonindustrialized setting J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 142 :424-434.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vatanen et al., 2016 96. Vatanen, T. ∙ Kostic, A.D. ∙ d’Hennezel, E. ..., DIABIMMUNE Study Group Variation in microbiome LPS immunogenicity contributes to autoimmunity in humans Cell. 2016; 165 :842-853 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the bifidobacterial expansion is also highly variable across infants with the potential to alter the trajectory of immune system development. Therefore, we decided to study this interaction and the potential consequences in more detail.
Given the variable expansion of Bifidobacteriaceae among newborn children, we compared immune system states between infants with abundant Bifidobacteriaceae and those failing to expand such bacteria. Lacking Bifidobacteriaceae was associated with expanded populations of neutrophils, basophils, plasmablasts, and memory CD8 + T cells, indicating both innate and adaptive immune activation ( Figure 3 A). Mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT) are important T cells in the intestinal response to bacterial vitamin B metabolites ( Ioannidis et al., 2020 46. Ioannidis, M. ∙ Cerundolo, V. ∙ Salio, M. The immune modulating properties of mucosal-associated invariant T cells Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :1556 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ) and these were also more abundant in blood from children with a low abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae ( Figure 3 A). Conversely, children with abundant gut Bifidobacteriaceae had higher frequency of non-classical monocytes, often considered as anti-inflammatory ( Narasimhan et al., 2019 66. Narasimhan, P.B. ∙ Marcovecchio, P. ∙ Hamers, A.A.J. ... Nonclassical monocytes in health and disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 37 :439-456 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as antigen-experienced regulatory T cells expressing the CD39 receptor, a highly suppressive Treg subset ( Gu et al., 2017 41. Gu, J. ∙ Ni, X. ∙ Pan, X. ... Human CD39 hi regulatory T cells present stronger stability and function under inflammatory conditions Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2017; 14 :521-528 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 A).
Also, plasma proteins differed between these groups and children lacking Bifidobacteriaceae had elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and IL-17A, critical mediators of intestinal inflammation, and also the Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-1α, serving as an alarmin released by necrotic cells and synergizing with TNFα in a variety of inflammatory responses ( Apte and Voronov, 2008 6. Apte, R.N. ∙ Voronov, E. Is interleukin-1 a good or bad ‘guy’ in tumor immunobiology and immunotherapy? Immunol. Rev. 2008; 222 :222-241 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 3 B). Children with abundant Bifidobacteriaceae had elevated levels of Treg-associated cytokines IL-27 and IL-10 as well as the endogenous IL-1 inhibitor IL1RA, presumably regulating innate IL-1β-mediated responses ( Figure 3 B). More surprising was the elevated IL-6 in children with abundant Bifidobacteriaceae ( Figure 3 B).
To better understand the regulatory cell-cell relationships in the newborn immune system, we calculated Spearman correlation matrices and compared infants with high and low abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae ( Figure 3 C). Such cell-cell correlations indicate co-regulated cell populations and allow for context-dependent perturbations to such relationships to be uncovered ( Rodriguez et al., 2020 74. Rodriguez, L. ∙ Pekkarinen, P.T. ∙ Lakshmikanth, T. ... Systems-level immunomonitoring from acute to recovery phase of severe COVID-19 Cell Rep. Med. 2020; 1 :100078 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found strong positive correlations among naive CD4 + T, naive CD8 + T, and naive regulatory T cells (cluster 1), likely reflecting overall thymic output, and these relationships were comparable among children irrespective of gut Bifidobacteriaceae abundance ( Figure 3 C). Other modules of co-regulated cell populations were strikingly different between these groups of children. In particular, memory Tregs were inversely correlated with activated CD8 + T cells and pro-inflammatory monocytes (cluster 2) in children with abundant Bifidobacteriaceae, but this relationship was disrupted in infants lacking such microbes ( Figure 3 C). We conclude that in infants not colonized by Bifidobacteriaceae or in cases where these microbes fail to expand during the first months of life there is evidence of systemic and intestinal inflammation, increased frequencies of activated immune cells, and reduced levels of regulatory cells indicative of systemic immune dysregulation.
Various organic molecules produced by bacteria, including organic acids, phenylalanine, and tryptophan derivatives, have been shown to broadly influence host health ( Ehrlich et al., 2020 35.

Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Breastmilk-promoted bifidobacteria produce aromatic amino acids in the infant gut bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Specifically, Bifidobacterium -derived metabolites have been shown to modulate pathogen-induced inflammation via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and NRF-2 pathway ( Ehrlich et al., 2020 35. Ehrlich, A.M. ∙ Pacheco, A.R. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ... Indole-3-lactic acid associated with Bifidobacterium -dominated microbiota significantly decreases inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells BMC Microbiol. 2020; 20 :357 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meng et al., 2020 63.

Res. 2020; 88 :209-217 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test whether the presence of HMO-utilization genes could explain the immune perturbations in children lacking gut Bifidobacteriaceae, we used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) database and identified 57 representative key functions necessary to metabolize HMOs ( Nguyen et al., 2021 67. Nguyen, M. ∙ Holdbrooks, H. ∙ Mishra, P. ... Impact of probiotic B. infantis EVC001 feeding in premature infants on the gut microbiome, nosocomially acquired antibiotic resistance, and enteric inflammation Front. Pediatr. 2021; 9 :618009 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sela et al., 2008 81. Sela, D.A. ∙ Chapman, J. ∙ Adeuya, A. ... The genome sequence of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis reveals adaptations for milk utilization within the infant microbiome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :18964-18969 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, we assessed the presence of these HMO-utilization genes in fecal metagenomes collected from the infants in our study ( Figure 4 A). We found that the H5 cluster of HMO-utilization genes was most commonly detected, but the abundances (counts per million; CPM) of HMO-utilization genes were generally low. We then compared relative amounts of the 57 HMO-utilization genes to the 355 plasma proteins measured in blood. Here, we observed significant correlations (Spearman) between a number of plasma proteins, for example, IL-6, TNFα, IL-17A, and IL-13 levels, which were all negatively associated with the presence of HMO-utilization genes, in particular genes within the H5 cluster ( Figure 4 B; IL-13, p = 7.79e −8 ; IL-6, p = 1.56e −6 ; TNF, p = 8.85e −17 ). Conversely, infants effectively metabolizing HMOs had elevated levels of IL-27 ( Figure 4 B; p = 1.36e −17 ), a cytokine known to limit Th2- and Th17-type responses in favor of Th1 and regulatory T cell function ( Yoshida and Hunter, 2015 102. Yoshida, H. ∙ Hunter, C.A. The immunobiology of interleukin-27 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 33 :417-443 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data above indicate that HMO-utilization genes expressed by bifidobacteria and other beneficial microbes in breastfed infants correlate with decreased systemic inflammation and a reduction in Th2- and Th17-type responses. Importantly, no isolates from any of the infants in the Swedish cohort expressed all HMO-utilization genes. To assess the beneficial effects of HMO-utilization-gene-expressing microbes, we used an optimized strain of Bifidobacterium possessing all HMO-utilization genes. In a second cohort of 60 exclusively breastfed infants in California, we fed approximately half (n = 29) of the newborn children 1.8 × 10 10 colony-forming units (CFUs) of B. longum subsp. infantis EVC001 daily from day 7 to day 28 postnatal and almost half (n = 31) were given no supplementation ( Figure 5 A). Fecal samples were collected at baseline (day 6) and on day 60 ( Figure 5 A). As expected, all HMO-utilization genes were abundant in the metagenomes of EVC001-fed but not control children ( Figure 5 B). Analyses of the microbiome composition showed no significant difference at baseline between these groups; however, by day 60 there was a significant decrease in alpha diversity (p = 0.0001; Wilcoxon) in B. infantis EVC001-fed infants as compared to controls ( Figure S2 A).
We then measured fecal cytokine levels in 40 randomly selected newborn children and found no significant differences at baseline but, at day 60, infants fed B. infantis EVC001 had reduced levels of IL-13, IL-17A, and regulatory and chemotactic cytokines IL-21, IL-31, IL-33, and MIP3a ( Figure 5 C; Table S2 ; p = 0.015, 0.0029, 0.00066, 0.007, 0.00011, and 0.0078, respectively). Conversely, there was a significant increase in fecal IFNβ in infants fed B. infantis EVC001 ( Figure 5 C; p = 0.016) and this IFNβ concentration correlated with the abundance of Bifidobacteriaceae ( Figure S2 B). We performed pairwise correlation tests between individual stool taxa (n = 40, day 60) and fecal cytokine concentrations (Spearman, Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate [FDR], α = 0.05) and identified three taxa, Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcaceae, significantly associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Specifically, Clostridiaceae correlated with IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-33 ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.018, 0.016, and 0.028, respectively) and decreased IFNβ levels ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.028), Enterobacteriaceae correlated with elevated IL-13, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-33 production ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.002, 0.017, 0.036, and 0.005, respectively) and decreased IFNβ levels ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.049), whereas Staphylococcaceae correlated with higher levels of IL-21 ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.028) and Streptococcaceae correlated with higher levels of IL-23 ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.044). In contrast, only Bifidobacteriaceae was associated with elevated IFNβ ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.001) and negatively correlated with levels of IL-13, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-33 ( Figure 5 D; p = 0.041, 0.017, 0.027, and 0.001, respectively). We conclude that beneficial microbes expressing all HMO-utilization genes in breastfed infants silence intestinal Th2 and Th17 responses. We also describe a previously unrecognized induction of IFNβ by beneficial microbes, although the direct effect on T cells remains elusive. Thus, it is not the simple presence of bifidobacteria that is responsible for the immune effects but the metabolic partnership between the bacteria and HMOs.
To better understand the direct effects of bifidobacterial metabolites and enteric cytokines on T cells, we flow sorted naive CD4 + T cells from a healthy adult donor and polarized these cells using standard cytokine combinations ( Cano-Gamez et al., 2020 19. Cano-Gamez, E. ∙ Soskic, B. ∙ Roumeliotis, T.I. ... Single-cell transcriptomics identifies an effectorness gradient shaping the response of CD4 + T cells to cytokines Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1801 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also added fecal waters (1:100 dilution) collected from either B. infantis EVC001-supplemented or control children lacking B. infantis ( Figure 6 A). To evaluate the cellular states of polarized T cells, we applied a targeted multiomics approach quantifying 259 mRNA molecules with known functions in T cells and 10 surface proteins detected by oligo-coupled antibodies (AbSeq, Rhapsody; BD Biosciences) ( Mair et al., 2020 62. Mair, F. ∙ Erickson, J.R. ∙ Voillet, V. ... A targeted multi-omic analysis approach measures protein expression and low-abundance transcripts on the single-cell level Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107499 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). The UMAP embeddings of cells were largely similar across Th0, Th1, and Th2 conditions but slightly different for Th17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) states ( Figure 6 B). Using a graphical abstraction and clustering method, PAGA ( Wolf et al., 2019 99. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Hamey, F.K. ∙ Plass, M. ... PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :59 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ), we compared the T cell states by polarizing condition and, importantly, uncovered differences between T cells polarized in the presence of B. infantis EVC001 or control fecal water ( Figure 6 C). Induced Th1-, Th2-, and iTreg-polarized states were comparable between B. infantis EVC001 and control fecal water cultures ( Figure 6 C). Th0 cells, on the other hand, cultured without any polarizing cytokines in the presence of fecal waters from control infants lacking B. infantis assumed a Th2-like state, whereas fecal water from infants fed B. infantis EVC001 induced a Th1-like state in these Th0 cells ( Figure 6 C). Differentially expressed genes involved Th1-associated GZMA, GZMB, TNF, and STAT1 in cells exposed to B. infantis EVC001 fecal water, whereas IL23R was highly overexpressed in cells exposed to control fecal water ( Figure 6 D). We supplemented Th0 cultures with IFNβ only, but this did not replicate the effect on Th1/Th2 skewing ( Figure S3 A).
Apart from this skewing toward Th1, we also noted a difference in Th17-polarized states in B. infantis EVC001 fecal water cultures ( Figure 6 C). Specifically, naive T cells polarized toward Th17 in the presence of fecal waters from control infants had elevated markers of activation and proliferation. Markers such as Ki67 when compared to cells polarized toward Th17 in the presence of B. infantis EVC001 fecal water were reduced in contrast to controls ( Figure S3 B). Collectively, these findings suggest that B. infantis EVC001 metabolites or enteric cytokines induced by the presence of B. infantis EVC001 exert a polarizing effect on naive CD4 + T cells that favors Th1 polarization, corroborating a mechanism of a silencing effect on fecal IL-13 and IL-17 in vivo .
Next, we assessed fecal metabolites in samples collected from infants fed B. infantis EVC001 and control infants, respectively. A total of 564 biochemicals were significantly different between these fecal samples. Metabolites within the tryptophan metabolism pathway were particularly enriched. The most overrepresented tryptophan metabolite in EVC001-fed infant feces compared to controls was ILA ( Figure 6 E; p = 5.89 × 10 −8 ; FDR) ( Ehrlich et al., 2020 35. Ehrlich, A.M. ∙ Pacheco, A.R. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ... Indole-3-lactic acid associated with Bifidobacterium -dominated microbiota significantly decreases inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells BMC Microbiol. 2020; 20 :357 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meng et al., 2020 63. Meng, D. ∙ Sommella, E. ∙ Salviati, E. ... Indole-3-lactic acid, a metabolite of tryptophan, secreted by Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis is anti-inflammatory in the immature intestine Pediatr. Res. 2020; 88 :209-217 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, bifidobacteria-derived ILA has recently been shown to bind both the AhR and hydrocarboxylic acid receptor 3 (HCAR3) and modulates monocyte responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) ( Laursen et al., 2020 52. Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Breastmilk-promoted bifidobacteria produce aromatic amino acids in the infant gut bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). CD4 + T cells do not express HCAR3 but do express the AhR ( Uhlen et al., 2019 94. Uhlen, M. ∙ Karlsson, M.J. ∙ Zhong, W. ... A genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of protein-coding genes in human blood cells Science. 2019; 366 :eaax9198 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we tested the impact of ILA on T cell polarization in vitro using the same polarizing cytokine conditions as above but replacing fecal water with ILA alone (1 mM). We found a number of mRNA transcripts induced, and these differed between Th1- and Th0-, Th2-, and Th17-polarizing conditions. In the presence of ILA, Th0, Th2, and Th17 cells upregulated the chemokine receptor CXCR3 often associated with Th1 cells and granzyme B ( Figure 6 F). Moreover, these cells all strongly upregulated the negative regulator of T cell activation, LGALS1 (galectin-1) (Th0, p = 2.19e −42 ; Th2, p = 2.47e −269 ; Th17, p = 7.62e −41 ), suggesting an additional pathway for regulating pathogenic Th2 and Th17 immune responses in newborns ( Figure 6 F). Also, in culture experiments using fecal water from B. infantis EVC001-supplemented children, upregulation of galectin-1 was seen ( Figure 6 D), further suggesting that ILA-mediated signaling explains some of the effects of B. infantis EVC001 supplementation in breastfed infants. In an animal model of zymosan-induced peritonitis, galectin-1 has been reported to induce IL-27 and IL-10 and act through IFNβ-dependent reprogramming of tissue macrophages and be essential in order to resolve inflammation ( Yaseen et al., 2020 101. Yaseen, H. ∙ Butenko, S. ∙ Polishuk-Zotkin, I. ... Galectin-1 facilitates macrophage reprogramming and resolution of inflammation through IFN-β Front. Pharmacol. 2020; 11 :901 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings of HMO-metabolizing microbes and the induction of tolerogenic responses are concurrent and associated with elevated IL-27 and IFNβ and ILA-mediated upregulation of galectin-1 on CD4 + T cells.
Taken together, our results indicate that during the first weeks of life there are transient immune responses to colonizing microbes, centered on mucosal surfaces. The colonization of the gut microbiome plays an integral role in immune responses, which is likely itself influenced by this process as well as other important determinants of health such as antibiotic use and breastfeeding. Specific bacteria, particularly those expressing HMO-utilization genes, have nutritional advantages in breastfed infants and influence immune-microbe interactions by dampening inflammatory responses, in particular Th2- and Th17-type responses in favor of Th1 and regulatory T cells. Key metabolites such as ILA exert direct regulatory effects on Th2 and Th17 cells such as induction of regulatory galectin-1, known to limit T cell activation, and collectively these layered effects of beneficial microbes and their metabolites on the developing immune system early in life have potential long-term consequences for the risk of developing immune-mediated diseases.

Section: Discussion

It is increasingly clear that early-life immune-microbe interactions influence the risk of immune-mediated diseases later in life; however, the exact mechanisms remain elusive. Results herein extend our previous understanding of an immunological sequence of events, triggered by microbial colonization, that results either in a balanced immune-microbe relationship or varying degrees of intestinal and systemic inflammation and perturbed immune cell regulation. Most notably, we show that within the T cell compartment, low abundance of bifidobacterial species and/or lack of HMO-utilization capacity is associated with intestinal inflammation, driven by aberrant Th2 and Th17 responses. Fecal waters from infants colonized with B. infantis EVC001, a strain of Bifidobacterium that harbors the full genetic capacity to break down all glycosidic bonds of HMOs ( Duar et al., 2020a 31. Duar, R.M. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Integrating the ecosystem services framework to define dysbiosis of the breastfed infant gut: the role of B. infantis and human milk oligosaccharides Front. Nutr. 2020; 7 :33 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar , 2020b 32. Duar, R.M. ∙ Casaburi, G. ∙ Mitchell, R.D. ... Comparative genome analysis of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis strains reveals variation in human milk oligosaccharide utilization genes among commercial probiotics Nutrients. 2020; 12 :3247 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ), polarized naive T cells toward Th1 in vitro , whereas fecal waters from infants not colonized with B. infantis EVC001 polarized Th2- and Th17-phenotype cells. Early in life, newly generated naive T cells populate mucosal tissues and differentiate into memory T cells ( Thome et al., 2016 90. Thome, J.J.C. ∙ Bickham, K.L. ∙ Ohmura, Y. ... Early-life compartmentalization of human T cell differentiation and regulatory function in mucosal and lymphoid tissues Nat. Med. 2016; 22 :72-77 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a window of opportunity for the microbiota to influence mucosal immunity.
A prevailing theory derived from mouse data postulates that timed reactivity to the colonizing microbes establishes a healthy immune-microbe interface in the gut through the induction of tolerance ( Knoop et al., 2017 50. Knoop, K.A. ∙ Gustafsson, J.K. ∙ McDonald, K.G. ... Microbial antigen encounter during a preweaning interval is critical for tolerance to gut bacteria Sci. Immunol. 2017; 2 :eaao1314 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). The transient immune cell activation events described here are reminiscent of this transient “weaning reaction” to colonizing microbes in mice ( Al Nabhani et al., 2019 4. Al Nabhani, Z. ∙ Dulauroy, S. ∙ Marques, R. ... A weaning reaction to microbiota is required for resistance to immunopathologies in the adult Immunity. 2019; 50 :1276-1288.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the timing is clearly different in human newborns and the reaction is uncoupled from weaning. Most infants in our cohort breastfed beyond the 3-month window during which the most dramatic immune cell responses seem to occur. Furthermore, the types of reactions seen in human newborns are qualitatively distinct and involve different cell populations as compared to the changes seen in mice, not only due to differences between blood analyses in humans and intestinal analyses in mice (P.B. et al., unpublished results).
Tolerance induction to the microbiota is key to prevent tissue damage and inflammation and here we make observations that indicate how such tolerance could be induced in human infants. We find that Bifidobacteriaceae able to metabolize HMOs are associated with reduced pro-inflammatory markers and conversely elevated proteins such as IL-10 and IL-27 are associated with regulatory T cells. Also, memory Treg frequency was inversely correlated with pro-inflammatory monocyte abundance and activated T cell population abundances in children with abundant bifidobacteria, a regulatory relationship that is lost in children lacking such beneficial microbes. Infants colonized with Bifidobacteriaceae are known to produce high levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) ( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ), and these are important inducers of regulatory T cells in the gut ( Smith et al., 2013 85. Smith, P.M. ∙ Howitt, M.R. ∙ Panikov, N. ... The microbial metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, regulate colonic T reg cell homeostasis Science. 2013; 341 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (2366) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we uncover an additional possible inducer of tolerance, namely intestinal IFNβ, which was produced at a significantly higher concentration in infants fed B. infantis EVC001 compared to infants that were not colonized with B. infantis . This finding is consistent with a recent report showing that specific Bifidobacteriaceae maintain host health during viral infection by inducing IFNβ production in colonic DCs in mice ( Stefan et al., 2020 87. Stefan, K.L. ∙ Kim, M.V. ∙ Iwasaki, A. ... Commensal microbiota modulation of natural resistance to virus infection Cell. 2020; 183 :1312-1324.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, other studies have described a role for microbiota-induced IFNβ in determining immune responses to viral challenges ( Abt et al., 2012 2. Abt, M.C. ∙ Osborne, L.C. ∙ Monticelli, L.A. ... Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity Immunity. 2012; 37 :158-170 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schaupp et al., 2020 77. Schaupp, L. ∙ Muth, S. ∙ Rogell, L. ... Microbiota-induced type I interferons instruct a poised basal state of dendritic cells Cell. 2020; 181 :1080-1096.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). IFNβ therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis induces IL-10 production by regulatory T cells ( Byrnes et al., 2002 17. Byrnes, A.A. ∙ McArthur, J.C. ∙ Karp, C.L. Interferon-β therapy for multiple sclerosis induces reciprocal changes in interleukin-12 and interleukin-10 production Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51 :165-174 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and in mice IFNβ induces regulatory T cells ( Dikopoulos et al., 2005 29. Dikopoulos, N. ∙ Bertoletti, A. ∙ Kröger, A. ... Type I IFN negatively regulates CD8 + T cell responses through IL-10-producing CD4 + T regulatory 1 cells J. Immunol. 2005; 174 :99-109 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), all suggesting that intestinal IFNβ production induced, directly or indirectly by colonizing beneficial microbes is another mechanism of ensuring intestinal tolerance.
Although the B. infantis EVC001 strain is not detectable in both cohorts studied, the focus on HMO-utilization genes allows for direct comparisons across these children. Importantly, the similarities in immune system states in relation to HMO-utilization gene abundance serve as independent confirmation of our findings. It is also intriguing, because this suggests that the imprinting effect on developing infant immune systems is not reliant on specific strains of microbes but core functional properties of the metagenome, such as the ability to metabolize HMOs and produce key downstream metabolites such as ILA.
Organic acids, acetate, and propionate have previously been implicated in mitigating lung inflammation in animal models ( Trompette et al., 2014 92. Trompette, A. ∙ Gollwitzer, E.S. ∙ Yadava, K. ... Gut microbiota metabolism of dietary fiber influences allergic airway disease and hematopoiesis Nat. Med. 2014; 20 :159-166 Crossref Scopus (1307) PubMed Google Scholar ) and food allergy in human infants ( Sandin et al., 2009 76. Sandin, A. ∙ Bråbäck, L. ∙ Norin, E. ... Faecal short chain fatty acid pattern and allergy in early childhood Acta Paediatr. 2009; 98 :823-827 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). ILA, produced in breastfed infants colonized with B. infantis , has been shown to decrease enteric inflammation through activation of AhR and Nrf-2 although the immune system changes were not resolved ( Ehrlich et al., 2018 34. Ehrlich, A.M. ∙ Henrick, B. ∙ Pacheco, A. ... Bifidobacterium grown on human milk oligosaccharides produce tryptophan metabolite indole-3-lactic acid that significantly decreases inflammation in intestinal cells in vitro FASEB J. 2018; 32 :lb359 Crossref Google Scholar ; Meng et al., 2020 63. Meng, D. ∙ Sommella, E. ∙ Salviati, E. ... Indole-3-lactic acid, a metabolite of tryptophan, secreted by Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis is anti-inflammatory in the immature intestine Pediatr. Res. 2020; 88 :209-217 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further supporting the role of bifidobacteria-derived ILA is a recent report showing induced IL-22 production in CD4 + T cells and modulation of monocyte TNFα responses upon LPS stimulation through the AhR and HCAR3 ( Laursen et al., 2020 52. Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Breastmilk-promoted bifidobacteria produce aromatic amino acids in the infant gut bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Our data are in line with this study but add more immunological details, such as the ILA-mediated direct effects on Th2 and Th17 cells and the upregulation of a negative regulator, galectin-1. This finding is also interesting in relation to data in patients with celiac disease, where substantial upregulation of galectin-1 has been shown to induce tolerogenic intestinal responses ( Sundblad et al., 2018 89. Sundblad, V. ∙ Quintar, A.A. ∙ Morosi, L.G. ... Galectins in intestinal inflammation: galectin-1 expression delineates response to treatment in celiac disease patients Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :379 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ). We believe that this mechanism of ensuring intestinal tolerance early in life, here shown to be induced by a specific bacterial metabolite, should be investigated further and its therapeutic potential be tested in subsequent clinical trials.
Importantly, bifidobacterial species differ in their ability to utilize HMOs ( Sela, 2011 79. Sela, D.A. Bifidobacterial utilization of human milk oligosaccharides Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2011; 149 :58-64 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Specifically, all proteins needed to transport HMOs and enzymes required to break down glycosidic bonds in HMOs are conserved only among some members of the B. longum subsp. infantis lineage ( LoCascio et al., 2007 56. LoCascio, R.G. ∙ Ninonuevo, M.R. ∙ Freeman, S.L. ...

Broad conservation of milk utilization genes in Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis as revealed by comparative genomic hybridization Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76 :7373-7381 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sela et al., 2008 81. Sela, D.A. ∙ Chapman, J. ∙ Adeuya, A. ... The genome sequence of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis reveals adaptations for milk utilization within the infant microbiome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :18964-18969 Crossref Scopus (547) PubMed Google Scholar ), in which B. infantis HMO-utilization loci have been identified ( Albert et al., 2019 3. Albert, K. ∙ Rani, A. ∙ Sela, D.A. Comparative pangenomics of the mammalian gut commensal Bifidobacterium longum Microorganisms. 2019; 8 :7 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ), although disparities in HMO catabolism between different B. infantis strains have only recently been identified, which impact their ecological fitness in the infant gut ( Duar et al., 2020a 31. Duar, R.M. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Integrating the ecosystem services framework to define dysbiosis of the breastfed infant gut: the role of B. infantis and human milk oligosaccharides Front. Nutr. 2020; 7 :33 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data elucidate a link between the overall ability of the microbiome to access and metabolize HMOs and decreased levels of mucosal and systemic inflammation. Indeed, the correlation of HMO-utilization genes, specifically H5 gene abundance and the decrease in Th2-related cytokines with increased IL-27, is important given recent findings by Duar et al. that H5 is a key ecological determinant of fitness for Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut ( Duar et al., 2020a 31. Duar, R.M. ∙ Henrick, B.M. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Integrating the ecosystem services framework to define dysbiosis of the breastfed infant gut: the role of B. infantis and human milk oligosaccharides Front. Nutr. 2020; 7 :33 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) and this fitness advantage is likely both metabolic and dependent on the induction of immunological tolerance.
Collectively, these data provide additional details to the role of beneficial microbes during early-life immune system imprinting and propose possible explanations to previously reported correlative data showing that infants colonized early in life with Bifidobacterium species are less likely to develop immune-mediated diseases ( Arrieta et al., 2015 7. Arrieta, M.-C. ∙ Stiemsma, L.T. ∙ Dimitriu, P.A. ..., CHILD Study Investigators Early infancy microbial and metabolic alterations affect risk of childhood asthma Sci. Transl.

Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of early microbiome colonization during a key window of immunological development where opportunities exist for supplementing the infant gut microbiome with potential benefits to the young child both early in life and long term.
Given the dramatic differences between infants supplemented with B. infantis EVC001 and control children, it will be important to perform longitudinal systems-level analyses of immune system development of which enrollment in such a study is ongoing. Also, one major limitation in studying newborn children is the inability to access the intestinal tissue, where immune-microbe interactions occur. The fact that systemic perturbations are still visible is a testament to the wide-ranging effects of immune-microbe interactions at mucosal surfaces on host physiology. The fact that mucosal-specific immune cells are circulating in the blood is known in celiac disease ( Han et al., 2013 42. Han, A. ∙ Newell, E.W. ∙ Glanville, J. ... Dietary gluten triggers concomitant activation of CD4 + and CD8 + αβ T cells and γδ T cells in celiac disease Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :13073-13078 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ( Gorfu et al., 2009 39. Gorfu, G. ∙ Rivera-Nieves, J. ∙ Ley, K. Role of beta7 integrins in intestinal lymphocyte homing and retention Curr. Mol. Med. 2009; 9 :836-850 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ) patients. It is also important to note that this current study does not directly assess health outcomes and benefits of expanded B. infantis or other HMO-metabolizing bacteria but this is inferred from a wealth of previous associations between microbiome development and immune-mediated diseases ( Arrieta et al., 2015 7. Arrieta, M.-C. ∙ Stiemsma, L.T. ∙ Dimitriu, P.A. ..., CHILD Study Investigators Early infancy microbial and metabolic alterations affect risk of childhood asthma Sci. Transl.

The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and the study protocol was approved by the regional ethical board in Stockholm, Sweden (DNR: 2009/2052–31/3, 2014/921-32 and 2016/512-31/1). After obtaining informed consent from parents, blood samples from newborns (n = 208) were collected at the Karolinska University Hospital. We also collected fecal samples from infants, either at the time of clinical visits and frozen directly at −80 C or collected at home frozen at −20 C and brought to the clinic by parents. Age of the newborns were measured as days after birth and ranging from 0 to 1452 days. Clinical metadata such as mode of delivery, sex, nutrition, growth and medications were gathered in a clinical database: https://brodinlab.com/newborns/
Details of the study design and procedures used to collect these samples has been reported elsewhere (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02457338 ) ( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smilowitz et al., 2017 84. Smilowitz, J.T. ∙ Moya, J. ∙ Breck, M.A. ... Safety and tolerability of Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis EVC001 supplementation in healthy term breastfed infants: a phase I clinical trial BMC Pediatr. 2017; 17 :133 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, exclusively breastfed term infants were randomly selected to receive 1.8 × 10 10 colony-forming units (CFU) activated B. infantis EVC001 daily for 21 days (EVC001) starting at day 7 postnatal or to receive breast milk alone (control) and followed up to postnatal day 60 ( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). All mothers received lactation support throughout the study. The demographic information (e.g., age, sex, and gestational age) was collected from each participant. All aspects of the study were approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Review Board (IRB Number: ID 631099) and all participants provided written informed consent. Here fecal samples from individual subjects were chosen at random and made up a subset of the original study participants. Fecal samples from randomly selected infants who were fed EVC001 (n = 20) and control infants (n = 20) on days 6 (Baseline) 40 and 60 postnatal were collected and analyzed for fecal enteric cytokine concentrations (described below). Day 21 fecal samples were used for non-targeted fecal metabolomics analysis (described below). Day 21 metagenomics, which have been reported elsewhere ( Casaburi and Frese, 2018 21. Casaburi, G. ∙ Frese, S.A. Colonization of breastfed infants by Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 reduces virulence gene abundance Hum. Microbiome J. 2018; 9 :7-10 Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar ) were used for correlative analyses. 16S amplicon date previously described ( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for diversity and correlative analyses. All sequencing libraries generated in this study have been deposited with the NCBI SRA (PRJNA390646) and are publicly available.
Blood samples drawn from newborns and parents were mixed with a stabilizer ( Brodin et al., 2019 15. Brodin, P. ∙ Duffy, D. ∙ Quintana-Murci, L. A call for blood—in human immunology Immunity. 2019; 50 :1335-1336 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) (one of the components of Whole blood processing kit; Cytodelics AB, Sweden) either immediately or within 1-3 hours post blood draw and cryopreserved as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples were thawed, and cells were fixed/RBCs lysed using WASH # 1 and WASH # 2 buffers (Whole blood processing kit; Cytodelics AB, Sweden) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. This was performed a few days prior to barcoding and staining of cells. Post fix/lysis of cells, ∼1-2x10 6 cells/sample were plated onto a 96 well round bottom plate using standard cryoprotective solution (10% DMSO and 90% FBS) and cryopreserved at −80°C. At the time of experimentation, cells were thawed at 37°C using RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin and benzonase (Sigma-Aldrich, Sweden). Briefly, cells were barcoded using automated liquid handling robotic system (Agilent technologies) ( Mikes et al., 2019 64. Mikes, J. ∙ Olin, A. ∙ Lakshmikanth, T. ... Automated cell processing for mass cytometry experiments Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1989 :111-123 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the Cell-ID 20-plex Barcoding kit (Fluidigm Inc.) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Samples were pooled batch wise by keeping together the longitudinal samples from each newborn baby or parent in the same batch. Cells were then washed, FcR blocked for 12 min at room temperature, following which cells were incubated for another 30 min at 4°C after addition of a cocktail of metal conjugated antibodies targeting the surface antigens. Cells were washed twice with CyFACS buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide and 2mM EDTA) and fixed overnight using 2% formaldehyde made in PBS (VWR, Sweden). The broad extended panel of antibodies used are listed in Table S1 . For acquisition by CyTOF, cells were stained with DNA intercalator (0.125 μM Iridium-191/193 or MaxPar® Intercalator-Ir, Fluidigm) in 2% formaldehyde made in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with CyFACS buffer, once with PBS and twice with milliQ water. Cells were mixed with 0.1X Norm Beads (EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads, Fluidigm) filtered through a 35μm nylon mesh and diluted to 1000,000 cells/ml. Samples were acquired using super samplers connected to our CyTOF2 mass cytometers (Fluidigm Inc.) using CyTOF software version 6.0.626 with noise reduction, a lower convolution threshold of 200, event length limits of 10-150 pushes, a sigma value of 3, and flow rate of 0.045 ml/min.
The panel of monoclonal antibodies used for this study are indicated in the Key resources table . Monoclonal antibodies were either purchased pre-conjugated from Fluidigm or obtained in carrier/protein-free buffer as purified antibodies that were then coupled to lanthanide metals using the MaxPar X8 polymer conjugation kit (Fluidigm Inc.) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations. Following the protein concentration determination by measurement of absorbance at 280nm on a nanodrop, the metal-labeled antibodies were diluted in Candor PBS Antibody Stabilization solution (Candor Bioscience, Germany) for long-term storage at 4°C.
Plasma protein data was generated using Olink assays, a proximity extension assay (Olink AB, Uppsala) ( Lundberg et al., 2011 60. Lundberg, M. ∙ Eriksson, A. ∙ Tran, B. ... Homogeneous antibody-based proximity extension assays provide sensitive and specific detection of low-abundant proteins in human blood Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 :e102 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) For analysis, 20μL of plasma from each sample was thawed and sent for analysis, either at the plasma protein profiling platform, Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm or Olink AB in Uppsala. In these assays, plasma proteins are dually recognized by pairs of antibodies coupled to a cDNA-strand that ligates when brought into proximity by its target, extended by a polymerase and detected using a Biomark HD 96.96 dynamic PCR array (Fluidigm Inc.). Four Olink panels (CVD 2, CVD 3, Inflammation and Immune response) have been used as indicated in Key resources table , capturing a total of 355 unique proteins in each plasma sample.
DNA was extracted as in IHMS DNA extraction protocol #8 ( Costea et al., 2017 26. Costea, P.I. ∙ Zeller, G. ∙ Sunagawa, S. ... Towards standards for human fecal sample processing in metagenomic studies Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :1069-1076 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to protocol recommendations 0.2g of faeces were used. Briefly, samples were treated with lysozyme solution and subjected to bead beating using zirconium beads. After centrifugation, DNA is extracted from supernatants with QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Cat No. 51604). After DNA extraction, collected DNA was quantified with Qubit (ThermoFisher, Cat No. Q32851) and 10ng were subjected to mechanical fragmentation with the Covaris Focused-ultrasonicator to ensure that fragment sizes were compatible with Illumina sequencing (∼300bp average). Sequencing adapters and sample barcodes were incorporated to the DNA fragments using ThruPLEX DNA-seq kit (Rubicon Genomics, Cat No. R400406). ThruPLEX DNA-seq products were purified and size selected by AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat No. B23318), and DNA concentration and size distribution were inspected with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, Cat No. Q32851) and the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies, Cat No. 5067-4626), respectively. Purified ThruPLEX DNA-seq products were then equimolarly pooled in 4 lanes and subjected to NovaSeq 6000 S4 Illumina Sequencing at the Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden.
PBMC derived CD3 + CD4 + CD45RA + naive T cells (CD8/14/19/56 negative) into an enriched culture medium including RPMI 1640 + 10 % FBS + NEAA + 1% Pen-strep + 55 μM β-mercaptoethanol. Cells are added at a concentration of 2 x10 5 cells/ml and pre-washed and resuspended 2.5ml T-Activator Dynabeads are added to obtain a bead:cell ratio of 1:2. One milliliter of bead/cell suspension was added to 24-well plate and the following polarizing supplements Th0: No cytokines, Th1: IL-12 (50 ng/ml), Anti-human IL-4 antibody (1 μg/ml) Th2: IL-4 (10 ng/ml), Anti-human IFN-γ antibody (1 μg/ml), Th17: IL-6 (50 ng/ml), IL-23 (20 ng/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), Anti-hum IL-4 (1 μg/ml), Anti-human IFN-γ antibody (1 μg/ml), iTreg: TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), IL-2 (10 ng/ml) IFN-β: IFN-β (10 ng/ml). Cells are incubated at 37°C, 5% CO 2 humidified incubator for 5 days and harvested.
Polarized T cells in each condition were labeled using BD Single-Cell Multiplexing Kit and BD AbSeq Ab-Oligos reagents strictly following the manufacturers protocol (BD Biosciences). Briefly, cells from each experiment condition were labeled with each sample tag and pooled 18 AbSeq Ab-Oligos. Each sample was then washed twice, counted and resuspended in cold BD Sample Buffer, then calculated the cell number in each sample, then pooled the required number of cells from each sample to get approximately 20,000 cells in 620 μL for each cartridge (around 9 samples for each cartridge). After priming the nanowell cartridges, the pooled sample was loaded onto BD Rhapsody cartridges and incubated at room temperature. Cell Capture Beads were prepared and then loaded onto the cartridge. According to the manufacturers protocol, cartridges were washed, cells were lysed, and Cell Capture Beads were retrieved and washed prior to performing reverse transcription and treatment with Exonuclease I. cDNA Libraries were prepared using mRNA Targeted, Sample Tag, and BD AbSeq Library Preparation with the BD Rhapsody Targeted mRNA and AbSeq Amplification Kits and protocol. In brief, cDNA targeted amplification using the Human T cell Expression Panel primers via PCR. mRNA PCR products were separated from sample tag and AbSeq products with double-sided size selection using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). mRNA and Sample Tag products were further amplified using PCR. PCR products were then purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads. Quality and quantity of PCR products were determined by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher). Targeted mRNA product was diluted to 2.5 ng/μL and sample tag and AbSeq PCR products were diluted to 1ng/μL to prepare final libraries. Final libraries were indexed using PCR. Index PCR products were purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads. Quality of final libraries was assessed by using Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer. Final libraries were diluted to 2nM for paired-end (150bp) sequencing on a NovaSeq sequencer (Illumina).
As previously described in Frese et al. (2017) 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar , quantification of the total B. infantis was performed by quantitative real-time PCR using Blon_0915 primers Blon0915F (5′- CGTATTGGCTTTGTACGCATTT −3′), Blon0915R (5′- ATCGTGCCGGTGAGATTTAC −3′) and BI915 PRB (5′- 6-FAM–CCAGTATGG–ZEN–CTGGTAAAGTTCACTGCA–3IABkFQ). Each reaction contained 10 μL of 2 × TaqMan Universal Master Mix II with UNG master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.9 μm of each primer, 0.25 μM probe and 5 μL of template DNA. Thermal cycling was performed on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System and consisted of an initial UNG activation step of 2 minute at 50°C followed by a 10-minute denaturation at 95°C succeeded by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. Quantitative PCR was carried out using standard curves of known B. infantis EVC001 cultures prepared by serial dilution. All samples including the standard curve were ran in duplicate.
Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-23, IL-27, IL-31, IL-33, IFNβ, and MIP3α were quantified from 80 mg of stool diluted 1:10 in Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, MD) diluent using the U-PLEX Inflammation Panel 1 (human) Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Standards and samples were measured in duplicate and blank values were subtracted from all readings. Assays were performed at least twice.
Historical fecal samples from term infants either colonized with B. infantis EVC001 or not were collected and stored in −80°C until processing. Pooled fecal samples (minimum of 3) from infants colonized with B. infantis EVC001 or not were weighed and diluted 25% w/v in sterile PBS and vortexed for 1 min allowing stool to thaw and form a homogeneous slurry. Fecal slurries were then centrifuged for 30min at 4,000 RPM at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and spun again for 3 hours at 12,000 RPM at 4°C. The supernatant was further collected and then serially filtered (40um cell strainer, 1um, 0.45um, and 0.22um). Filtered fecal waters were stored in −80°C until use.
Fecal samples were sent to Metabolon, Inc. (Durham, NC) for non-targeted metabolite profiling. Forty fecal samples, control (n = 20) and B. infantis EVC001-fed (n = 20) from day 21 postnatal were collected and processed for non-targeted metabolomics profiling, as shown previously ( Call et al., 2018 18. Call, L. ∙ Stoll, B. ∙ Oosterloo, B. ... Metabolomic signatures distinguish the impact of formula carbohydrates on disease outcome in a preterm piglet model of NEC Microbiome. 2018; 6 :111 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, samples were exposed to a combination of aqueous and organic solvents to extract small molecules. Residual organic solvent was removed using a TurboVap (Zymark), and the fecal extracts were lyophilized and divided equally for then equal GC/MS and UPLC-MS/MS analysis in parallel. Extracts were derivatized with bistrimethyl-silyl-triflouroacetamide and analyzed using a Trace DSQ (Thermo-Finnigan) mass spectrometer Fecal extracts were analyzed under both acidic and basic conditions using an ACQUITY (Waters) UPLC and an LTQ (Thermo-Finnigan) mass spectrometer.
Plasma protein data was batch corrected and normalized on the basis of NPX values across batches with available bridge samples.
All FCS-files unrandomized using CyTOF software (version 6.0.626) were transferred with no further preprocessing. An automated cell classification supervised algorithm, Grid was used to first manually define reference subpopulations and then train a learning algorithm (XGBoost) to recognize the same subsets of cells in novel data, providing a rapid and robust cell classification method for high-dimensional Mass cytometry datasets ( Chen et al., 2020 25. Chen, Y. ∙ Lakshmikanth, T. ∙ Mikes, J. ... Single-cell classification using learned cell phenotypes bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). FCS files and relevant phenotypic markers were used in order to manually gate cell populations to be used as a reference, then the reference was used to train a classifier algorithm to categorize similar cells. The output results in a dataframe with samples as columns and cell sub-populations as rows. Outputs from all Mass cytometry experiments were merged, and batch differences removed using limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 73. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (9763) PubMed Google Scholar ).
347 and 60 demultiplexed fastq files from the Born-immune and IMPRINT cohort respectively were downstream processed using the same pipeline and parameters. Demultiplexed samples were quality filtered using fastp v0.20.0 ( Chen et al., 2018 24. Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ∙ Chen, Y. ... fastp: an ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :i884-i890 Crossref Scopus (1521) PubMed Google Scholar ), and host contamination removed using Kraken v2.0.8_beta ( Wood et al., 2019 100. Wood, D.E. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Langmead, B. Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :257 Crossref Scopus (407) PubMed Google Scholar ) by mapping against the NCBI’s GRCh38.p13 database. Both steps were run using default settings in StaG-mwc v.0.4.1 ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1483891 ).
Taxonomic profiles were established using MetaPhlAn v3.0.5 ( Beghini et al., 2021 11. Beghini, F. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Blanco-Míguez, A. ... Integrating taxonomic, functional, and strain-level profiling of diverse microbial communities with bioBakery 3 Elife. 2021; 10 :e65088 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) and functional HMO profiles generated with HUMAnN2 v.2.8.1 ( Franzosa et al., 2018 36. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :962-968 Crossref Scopus (374) PubMed Google Scholar ) bypassing all steps except “nucleotide-search” and “evalue 0.00001” with a customized nucleotide database of HMO genes instead of the chochophlan database. RPKs from HUMAnN2 were normalized to cpms using ‘humann2_renorm_table’. Both taxonomic and functional profiling were incorporated into StaG-mwc.
Immune cell and plasma protein data was reduced to include infant samples collected 56 to 152 days after birth with correlating metagenomics data, resulting in n = 18 and n = 19 samples respectively. Fold change was calculated, and variables re-ordered in descending value order.
The correlation matrices were built using library corrplot with spearman method, for comparison purposes low bifidobacterial matrix was reordered to the level order of high bifidobacterial matrix.
Samples were binned according to days after birth while HMO utilization genes were clustered in accordance with pathway and function. The CPM counts were binned as well with increasing ranges and heatmap was built using library superheat . Correlations with individual cytokines were based on NPX values and CPM counts. ANOVA test was performed for Spearman correlation performed between individual cytokines and HMO utilization genes.
FASTQ files of targeted transcriptomics data were processed on the Seven Bridges platform using the Targeted Analysis Pipeline v1.9 (BD Biosciences)( https://www.sevenbridges.com ). R1 and R2 are filtered removing low quality sequencing reads, checking read lengths as well as lengths of strings of identical bases. Read pair is removed if read length of R1 is less than 66 bases or R2 is less than 64 bases. R1 reads are annotated to cell label sequences and unique molecular identifiers (UMI), perfect matches are kept while others will be held for further filtering. R2 reads are annotated to oligo sequence to genes on targeted panel by Bowtie2. Then, all valid R1 and R2 read pairs are collapsed into unique raw molecules. For all analysis, we used output of distribution-based error correction (DBEC) as a means to correct for both artifacts in PCR cycles and sequencing errors. Expression matrices containing DBEC-adjusted molecule counts after sample tag assignment were used for downstream analysis.
The expression matrices were read into the R package Seurat v3 ( Butler et al., 2018 16. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (2404) PubMed Google Scholar ) where they were merged and split between RNA and antibody (Ab) assays thereafter using scripts from https://github.com/MairFlo/Targeted_transcriptomics ( Mair et al., 2020 62. Mair, F. ∙ Erickson, J.R. ∙ Voillet, V. ... A targeted multi-omic analysis approach measures protein expression and low-abundance transcripts on the single-cell level Cell Rep. 2020; 31 :107499 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). After creating Seurat object that included features that were detected in at least 3 cells and cells that were detected in at least 50 features within the RNA assay. In the first experiment relating to bifido, out of 53,184 cells, 2,911 were called as multiples and 877 events as undetermined. Multiples and undetermined cells were removed from the analysis. In the second experiment relating to ILA, out of 42,151 cells, 5,539 were called as multiples and 17 events as undetermined. On RNA assay, a natural log normalization was performed with a scale factor of 10,000 while a centered log-ratio normalization was performed on the Ab assay. Both assays were linearly scaled to remove uninteresting sources of variation like batch effect. Additionally, RNA assay was scaled to regress out the total number of molecules identified within a cell as well as the effect of GAPDH gene. The effect of the GAPDH gene was regressed out by computing the fraction of counts from that gene. All genes or proteins were used for dimensionality reduction using UMAP and clustering.
Partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) ( Wolf et al., 2019 99. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Hamey, F.K. ∙ Plass, M. ... PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :59 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ) was utilized to demonstrate the topology abstraction of single-cell RNA data. In brief, PCA was first applied to reduce the dimension of RNA data to 20, and then a kNN-like graph was built with the approximate nearest neighbor search. Afterward, the highly connected communities in the kNN-like graph were discovered with Leiden method ( Traag et al., 2019 91. Traag, V.A. ∙ Waltman, L. ∙ van Eck, N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :5233 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ), which were further utilized by PAGA to infer a trajectory map, which demonstrates the topology relationship of those highly connected communities. Finally, the trajectory map was used as the initial position and the scatters of single cells were embedded with ForceAtlas2 ( Jacomy et al., 2014 47. Jacomy, M. ∙ Venturini, T. ∙ Heymann, S. ... ForceAtlas2, a continuous graph layout algorithm for handy network visualization designed for the Gephi software PLoS One. 2014; 9 :e98679 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ) for visualization.
Quality control for the bulk RNA-sequencing of FACS-sorted immune cell populations was provided by the National Genomics Infrastructure (NGI) at Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden. First, we quantified abundances of transcript sequences in FASTA format by generating abundance estimates for all samples using the Kallisto software ( Bray et al., 2016 14. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Crossref Scopus (2508) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, gene abundance estimates were performed by summing the transcript expression (TPM) values for the transcripts of the same gene. Since DESeq2 expects count data from the Kallisto output the tximport package was used to convert these estimates into read counts. DESeq2 was performed as a basis for differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution ( Love et al., 2014 58. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (20156) PubMed Google Scholar ). We employed a design to demonstrate differential gene expression between circulating CD38-CD4-CD62Lneg and memory CD4T cells over time. Low gene counts (< 100) were filtered out and variance stabilizing transformation (VST) was performed on the count data.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify transcriptomic differences occurring over time in circulating CD38 + CD62L - memory CD4 + T cells versus Total memory CD4 + T cells. The R package fgsea was used to find the most highly enriched hallmark pathways through gmtPathways function ( Subramanian et al., 2005 88. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (20168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pathways of interest were subsequently isolated and all genes within each pathway observed using volcano plots.
As previously described in Casaburi et al. (2019) 22. Casaburi, G. ∙ Duar, R.M. ∙ Vance, D.P. ... Early-life gut microbiome modulation reduces the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria Antimicrob. Resist. Infect. Control. 2019; 8 :131 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar , shotgun metagenomic libraries were prepared and sequenced from DNA previously extracted from approximately 100 mg of frozen stools collected from infants on day 21 postnatal( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the DNA was subjected to bead beating prior to column purification using a Zymo Fecal DNA Miniprep kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Metagenomic shotgun library preparation and sequencing was performed at the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) (University of California, Berkeley) on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform using a paired-end sequencing approach with a targeted read length of 150 bp and an insert size of 150bp ( Casaburi et al., 2019 22. Casaburi, G. ∙ Duar, R.M. ∙ Vance, D.P. ... Early-life gut microbiome modulation reduces the abundance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria Antimicrob. Resist. Infect. Control. 2019; 8 :131 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Additionally, 16S rRNA libraries were generated and sequenced ( Frese et al., 2017 37. Frese, S.A. ∙ Hutton, A.A. ∙ Contreras, L.N. ... Persistence of supplemented Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 in breastfed infants mSphere. 2017; 2 :e00501-17 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using primers 515f and 806r as previously described with recent modifications ( Caporaso et al., 2011 20. Caporaso, J.G. ∙ Lauber, C.L. ∙ Walters, W.A. ... Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :4516-4522 Crossref Scopus (4111) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walters et al., 2015 97. Walters, W. ∙ Hyde, E.R. ∙ Berg-Lyons, D. ... Improved bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V4 and V4-5) and fungal internal transcribed spacer marker gene primers for microbial community surveys mSystems. 2015; 1 :e00009-15 Crossref Scopus (580) PubMed Google Scholar ). Paired-end DNA (300 bp) sequencing was performed at the UC Davis Genome Center on an Illumina MiSeq system.
Demultiplexed fastq sequences were quality filtered, including adaptor trimming using Trimmomatic v0.36 ( Bolger et al., 2014 12. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (19186) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default parameters. Quality-filtered sequences were screened to remove human sequences using GenCoF v1.0 ( Czajkowski et al., 2019 27. Czajkowski, M.D. ∙ Vance, D.P. ∙ Frese, S.A. ... GenCoF: a graphical user interface to rapidly remove human genome contaminants from metagenomic datasets Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :2318-2319 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ) against a non-redundant version of the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38, patch release 7 ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/human/data?asm=GRCh38.p7 ) www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . Human sequence-filtered raw reads were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra ) under the reference number, PRJNA390646. Taxonomic profiling of the metagenomic samples was performed using MetaPhlAn2 ( Truong et al., 2015 93. Truong, D.T. ∙ Franzosa, E.A. ∙ Tickle, T.L. ... MetaPhlAn2 for enhanced metagenomic taxonomic profiling Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :902-903 Crossref Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ), which uses a library of clade-specific markers to provide pan-microbial (bacterial, archaeal, viral, and eukaryotic) profiling ( http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan2 ). Strain characterization was performed using PanPhlan ( Scholz et al., 2016 78. Scholz, M. ∙ Ward, D.V. ∙ Pasolli, E. ... Strain-level microbial epidemiology and population genomics from shotgun metagenomics Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :435-438 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ) which is used in combination with MetaPhlAn2 to characterize strain-level variants in marker genes for a selected organism. For PanPhlan analysis, the pangenomes from Bifidobacterium longum https://bitbucket.org/CibioCM/panphlan https://github.com/segatalab/panphlan were used as a reference. Both MetaPhlAn2 and PanPhlan were used with their default settings as described in the updated global profiling of the Human Microbiome Project (2017)( Lloyd-Price et al., 2017 55. Lloyd-Price, J. ∙ Mahurkar, A. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Strains, functions and dynamics in the expanded Human Microbiome Project Nature. 2017; 550 :61-66 Crossref Scopus (424) PubMed Google Scholar ).
All detectable biomarker values were included as continuous data in the analyses; however, values below level of detection (< 20% of all cytokines measurements) were generated below the level of quantification to justify parametric statistics. Fecal cytokine concentrations were determined using calibration curves to which electrochemiluminescence signals were backfitted. Final concentrations were calculated using the Sector Imager 2400 MSD Discovery Workbench analysis software, as was previously published ( Henrick et al., 2019 43. Henrick, B.M. ∙ Chew, S. ∙ Casaburi, G. ... Colonization by B. infantis EVC001 modulates enteric inflammation in exclusively breastfed infants Pediatr. Res. 2019; 86 :749-757 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nguyen et al., 2021 67. Nguyen, M. ∙ Holdbrooks, H. ∙ Mishra, P. ... Impact of probiotic B. infantis EVC001 feeding in premature infants on the gut microbiome, nosocomially acquired antibiotic resistance, and enteric inflammation Front. Pediatr. 2021; 9 :618009 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Fecal compounds were identified by comparison of the raw data with Metabolon’s curated library of standards. The values for compounds in the fecal samples were normalized by the dry mass of the sample and missing values were imputed with half the compound minimum. Absolute compound intensity values were used to calculate fold differences between controls and EVC001-fed samples, while for all other analyses, the values were transformed using the generalized log transformation then mean-centered and scaled by the standard deviation.
All statistical analyses were performed in R v3.6.2. To assess infant gut microbiome differences across ages, principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) was performed on a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix calculated from infant bacterial taxa relative abundance. The first two principle coordinate axes were plotted and colored by day of life. Cytokine vs bacterial relative abundance values were Spearman correlated with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. FDR adjusted Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare baseline (Day 6) cytokine levels to Day 60 cytokine levels between treatments. Median cytokine values were calculated for Days 6 and 60, then 0-1 normalized within each cytokine for graphical visualization purposes. Demultiplexed sequencing data was downloaded from the NCBI SRA (PRJNA390646). Sequencing data from samples utilized in the present study were subjected to analysis in qiime2 ( Boylen, 2019 13. Boylen, Evan Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome data science using QIIME 2 Nature. 2019; 37 In press Crossref Scopus (2306) Google Scholar ). Samples were quality filtered and denoised using deblur ( Amnon, 2017 5. Amnon, Amir Deblur Rapidly Resolves Single-Nucleotide Community Sequence Patterns mSystems. 2017; In press Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar ). Phylogenic alignments were conducted with mafft ( Katoh, 2019 49. Katoh, K. MAFFT online service: multiple sequence alignment, interactive sequence choice and visualization Briefings in Bioinformatics. 2019; Crossref Scopus (1607) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fasttree ( Price, 2009 70. Price, Morgan FastTree: computing large minimum evolution trees with profiles instead of a distance matrix Mol Biol Evol. 2009; Crossref Scopus (2179) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Shannon Diversity and a Weighted Unifrac distance matrix ( Lozupone, 2010 59. Lozupone, Catherine UniFrac: an effective distance metric for microbial community comparison The ISME Journal. 2010; Crossref Scopus (1277) Google Scholar ) were created using the q2-diversity plugin in qiime2, rarified to the minimum number of dereplicated sequences passing quality filter for the samples (1208 reads per sample). Shannon diversity values were compared using a Wilcoxon test and graphed using ggpubr (v. 0.4.0) and ggplot2 in R (v4.0.4). Analysis of variance using distance matrices (adonis) was used to compare beta diversity by treatment group. The P values throughout the manuscript are represented by asterisks ( ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ , p < 0.0001).
