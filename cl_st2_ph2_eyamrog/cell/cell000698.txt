Title: A distinct clade of Bifidobacterium longum in the gut of Bangladeshi children thrives during weaning


Abstract: Summary

The gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and development. We characterized the fecal microbiome and metabolome of 222 young children in Dhaka, Bangladesh during the first two years of life. A distinct Bifidobacterium longum clade expanded with introduction of solid foods and harbored enzymes for utilizing both breast milk and solid food substrates. The clade was highly prevalent in Bangladesh, present globally (at lower prevalence), and correlated with many other gut taxa and metabolites, indicating an important role in gut ecology. We also found that the B. longum clades and associated metabolites were implicated in childhood diarrhea and early growth, including positive associations between growth measures and B. longum subsp. infantis , indolelactate and N-acetylglutamate. Our data demonstrate geographic, cultural, seasonal, and ecological heterogeneity that should be accounted for when identifying microbiome factors implicated in and potentially benefiting infant development.

Human milk is a key factor in shaping the infant gut microbiome. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)—complex sugars indigestible by human enzymes—provide a bacterial food source, epitomizing co-evolution between humans and gut bacteria ( Charbonneau et al., 2016a 10.

Introduction of solid foods is a major milestone in gut microbiome development and diversification, with the duration of mixed feeding (combining human milk and complementary foods) also shaping gut microbiome structure and functions ( Bäckhed et al., 2015 1. Bäckhed, F. ∙ Roswall, J. ∙ Peng, Y. ...

Although prolonged breastfeeding until 24 months is rare in most industrialized settings ( Victora et al., 2016 74. Victora, C.G. ∙ Bahl, R. ∙ Barros, A.J.D. ... Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect Lancet. 2016; 387 :475-490 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4191) PubMed Google Scholar ), it was likely common throughout human evolution and is still customary in many populations. However, interactions between complementary food substrates and the gut microbiome during mixed feeding remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the major geographic variability of both the infant diet during mixed feeding and the gut microbiome remain major challenges, calling for population-specific microbiome profiling to understand the role of early complementary feeding in infant development.
The gut microbiome contributes to disparities between western and vulnerable child populations in nonindustrialized countries. In malnutrition and stunting, the gut microbiome tentatively serves as a gatekeeper; infants with impaired microbiomes fail to benefit from therapeutic diets unless their microbiomes are first repaired ( Chen et al., 2020 14.

For example, a study in Malawian infants established a microbiome-dependent link between lack of sialylated HMOs in mothers’ breast milk and stunting ( Charbonneau et al., 2016b 11. Charbonneau, M. ∙ O’Donnell, D. ∙ Blanton, L. ... Sialylated Milk Oligosaccharides Promote Microbiota-Dependent Growth in Models of Infant Undernutrition Cell. 2016; 164 :859-871 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bangladeshi children with severe acute malnutrition showed gut microbiome impairments, the level of which correlated with severity of malnutrition and anthropometric measurements ( Subramanian et al., 2014 65. Subramanian, S. ∙ Huq, S. ∙ Yatsunenko, T. ... Persistent gut microbiota immaturity in malnourished Bangladeshi children Nature. 2014; 510 :417-421 Crossref Scopus (865) PubMed Google Scholar ). This research program suggested that microbiota-directed complementary food can be used for targeted manipulation of the impaired gut microbiome, leading to improved growth trajectories and neurodevelopment, among other favorable developmental outcomes ( Chen et al., 2021b 15. Chen, R.Y. ∙ Mostafa, I. ∙ Hibberd, M.C. ... A Microbiota-Directed Food Intervention for Undernourished Children N. Engl. J.

Efforts to confirm therapeutic efficacy and durability of the findings are underway.
Conversely, industrialized-type gut microbiomes appear to contribute to increasing incidence of immune-mediated diseases such as allergies, asthma, and type 1 diabetes ( Brodin, 2022 7. Brodin, P.

A proposed hypothesis for this link is reduced microbiome diversity in adult westernized populations compared to an ancestral state ( Segata, 2015 58. Segata, N.

Industrialized settings imply practices interfering with mother-to-infant microbiome transmission and development, such as Cesarean section, formula feeding, and early cessation of breastfeeding, that could lead to loss of microbiome diversity across generations. Exemplifying how this interferes with human development, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis tentatively contributes to early immune development ( Henrick et al., 2021 30.

HMOs are optimal substrates for B. longum subsp. infantis , and changes in breastfeeding patterns could therefore contribute to decreases in B. longum subsp. infantis prevalence and developmental patterns of abundance. Comparing gut microbiomes in a global context and identifying endangered microbes could improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions that drive developmental outcomes in humans.
Contributing to our understanding of the infant gut microbiome and metabolomic development in vulnerable populations, the Microbiota and Health Study recruited a community-based cohort of 267 infants in a peri-urban community of Dhaka, Bangladesh and followed them until two years of age ( Vidal et al., 2019 75. Vidal, K. ∙ Sultana, S. ∙ Patron, A.P. ... Microbiota and Health Study: A Prospective Cohort of Respiratory and Diarrheal Infections and Associated Risk Factors in Bangladeshi Infants under Two Years (medRxiv) 2019 Google Scholar ). Nearly all were exclusively breastfed during their first 6 months, followed by equally high rates of breastfeeding combined with complementary diets up to 24 months of age. Demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information was recorded and serial fecal samples were collected with the goal of assessing the epidemiology of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses—major causes of morbidity and mortality—in early life ( Binia et al., 2021 4. Binia, A. ∙ Siegwald, L. ∙ Sultana, S. ... The Influence of FUT2 and FUT3 Polymorphisms and Nasopharyngeal Microbiome on Respiratory Infections in Breastfed Bangladeshi Infants from the Microbiota and Health Study 2021 mSphere e0068621 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ).
Here, we analyze metagenomic and metabolomic data from 222 participants with comprehensive fecal sampling from the Microbiota and Health Study to characterize undescribed gut microbial diversity and downstream contributions to gut metabolism. We found that bifidobacteria dominated in early life followed by abundant Prevotella spp. We identified a distinct clade in B. longum which expanded upon introduction of solid foods combined with continued breastfeeding. Re-analyzing publicly available metagenomes established that the clade was present in infant cohorts outside Bangladesh, albeit at a much lower prevalence. This clade appeared to harbor genomic capacity to utilize both human milk and solid food as its energy source while also positively correlating with abundance of several gut commensals. We identified a group of metabolites, including pipecolic acid, that correlated with the previously undescribed B. longum clade, providing further cues on the role of this organism in the gut ecosystem and host development.

Section: Results

We characterized the gut microbiome composition and stool metabolomic repertoire of n = 222 children in our prospective cohort from birth until two years of age (up to seven samples collected per individual; Figure 1 A). Most birth samples (collected within 10 days of birth) had low DNA concentrations and were excluded from sequencing ( Figure 1 A). We performed whole metagenome sequencing to determine microbial composition and used qPCR to quantify absolute microbial abundances. To complement the data on microbiome composition and evaluate microbial influences on gut physiology, we performed untargeted stool metabolite profiling using four complementary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods. Because the majority of metabolites (52,361, or 98.5% of 53,158 features) in our metabolomics dataset were unknown (i.e., peaks not matching metabolites in our internal database), we assigned tentative annotations to the remaining features based on accurate m / z matching against the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), yielding 23,980 features with putative identifiers ( Table S1 ). Over half the features (28,381, 53.4%) remained unidentified and may represent novel microbial metabolites or MS artifacts such as adducts, fragments, or metabolite isotopes ( Chen et al., 2021a 13. Chen, L. ∙ Lu, W. ∙ Wang, L. ... Metabolite discovery through global annotation of untargeted metabolomics data Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :1377-1385 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Both microbiome and metabolomic profiles showed strong longitudinal shifts ( Figures 1 B and 1C), reflected by increasing microbial diversity and metabolomic richness ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Diversity metrics were highly correlated throughout the period (beta-coefficient = 0.14, p = 0.00010, linear model with time point as fixed effect and subjects as random effect, coefficient represents change in metabolomic richness for a unit change in Shannon’s diversity). We observed significant inter-individual covariation between taxonomic and metabolomic profiles at all sampling time points between 2 and 24 months (Mantel test, p < 0.001) and a trend toward significance at birth (Mantel test, p = 0.054), indicating a consistent linkage between microbiome composition and the stool metabolome. This suggests that infant gut metabolomic profiles are markedly influenced by microbial metabolism and could help to elucidate the mechanisms by which microbes interact with each other and with the human host.
Longitudinal analysis of the developing gut microbiomes revealed Bifidobacterium spp. dominance up to 15 months of age, and Prevotella spp. markedly increasing during the second year of life ( Figure 1 F). The transition from exclusive to partial breastfeeding and cessation of breastfeeding was associated with shifts in 23 bacterial species, including multiple bifidobacteria, which were more abundant during exclusive breastfeeding, and opportunistic pathogens, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Streptococcus lutetiensis , which were less abundant during exclusive breastfeeding (q < 0.1, Table S2 ). We observed strong seasonal shifts with 39 species affected in total, including increases in C. jejuni , Streptococcus spp. and Klebsiella spp. during the rainy monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons (q < 0.1, Table S2 ). Delivery mode (vaginal birth vs. Cesarean section) and place of birth (home vs. clinic) had modest, but detectable influence on gut microbiome composition ( Table S2 ). Mirroring these shifts, numerous metabolites, both known and unknown, were associated with breastfeeding patterns, seasonal changes, and other measured covariates (q < 0.01, Table S1 ).
B. longum consists of several distinct subspecies with unique metabolic properties that differ in prevalence and abundance across populations depending, for example, on host age and geography ( Kujawska et al., 2020 38. Kujawska, M. ∙ La Rosa, S.L. ∙ Roger, L.C. ...

Sela, D.A. ∙ Chapman, J. ∙ Adeuya, A. ... The genome sequence of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis reveals adaptations for milk utilization within the infant microbiome Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105 :18964-18969 18964–18969 Crossref Scopus (702) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this cohort, B. longum was the most abundant bacterial species on average ( Figure 2 A), reflecting the high prevalence of breastfeeding and metabolic machinery in B. longum to utilize human milk ( Sela and Mills, 2010 59. Sela, D.A. ∙ Mills, D.A. Nursing our microbiota: molecular linkages between bifidobacteria and milk oligosaccharides Trends Microbiol. 2010; 18 :298-307 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ). To understand the phylogenetic structure of the observed strains, we used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approach in StrainPhlAn, which assigned an SNP haplotype for the dominant B. longum strain in each sample. The phylogenetic tree revealed three distinct clades ( Figure 2 B and Table S3 ) roughly corresponding to B. longum subsp. longum , suis/suill um, and infantis according to their similarity with existing reference genomes. Some B. longum reference genomes appear to be mislabeled on the subspecies level ( O’Callaghan et al., 2015 49. O’Callaghan, A. ∙ Bottacini, F. ∙ O’Connell Motherway, M. ... Pangenome analysis of Bifidobacterium longum and site-directed mutagenesis through by-pass of restriction-modification systems.

Phylogenomic disentangling of the Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis taxon. Microb Gen. 2021; 7 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we identified the genome GCF_000196575 (strain 157F, annotated as B. longum subsp. infantis ) to belong to B. longum subsp. longum and the genome GCF_000410595 (strain CMCC P0001, annotated as B. longum subsp. longum ) to belong to the same clade with B. longum subsp. suis/suillum . We further confirmed the phylogenetic structure by including n = 296 metagenome-assembled B. longum genomes generated from the same metagenomics data, resulting in a similar phylogenetic tree ( Figure S1 A).
To confirm the observed three-clade phylogeny, we cultured B. longum strains from preserved stool samples collected in this study. Genome sequencing using PacBio long-read technology revealed five strains (NCC 5000–5004) that clustered separately from B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum (≤96.3% average nucleotide identity [ANI]), sharing similarities with B. longum subsp. suis and suillum genomes (≥98.1% ANI), which had been mostly isolated from livestock ( Figures 2 B, 2C, and Table S3 ). Multi-locus sequence analysis of 10 housekeeping genes to discriminate subspecies within the Bifidobacterium genus ( Bottacini et al., 2014 6. Bottacini, F. ∙ Ventura, M. ∙ van Sinderen, D. ... Diversity, ecology and intestinal function of bifidobacteria Microb. Cell Fact. 2014; 13 :S4 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yanokura et al., 2015 77.

Appl. Microbiol. 2015; 38 :305-314 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) confirmed similarity of the newly isolated strains NCC 5000–5004 to B. longum suis / suillum ( Figures S1 B and S1C), while suggesting a separation between strains of human and animal origin. These data further assured us that individuals in this cohort harbored three distinct B. longum clades, and that the B. longum phylogeny altogether harbored four distinct clades. Interestingly, within the clade including subsp. suis and the five Bangladeshi isolates (hereafter referred to as transitional B. longum ), the strains NCC 5000–5004 clustered together with two previously described strains of human origin (BSM11-5 and 3_mod_mod2; ≥98.6% ANI). The latter strains were isolated from infant feces and assigned to B. longum subsp. suis and B. longum subsp. infantis , respectively ( Figure 2 C) ( Raman et al., 2019 55. Raman, A.S. ∙ Gehrig, J.L. ∙ Venkatesh, S. ... A sparse covarying unit that describes healthy and impaired human gut microbiota development Science. 2019; 365 :eaau4735 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). The phylogeny and host specificity of these strains, as well as a distinct rare lineage of unclear origin (CMCC P0001) reported from China, warrants further investigation.
Since the SNP-haplotype approach was agnostic of strain abundance and potentially co-occurring secondary strains, we constructed a revised B. longum pangenome using the newly sequenced isolate genomes together with existing reference genomes. We defined non-redundant gene families (>95% ANI) that were unique to each clade as markers for B. longum subsp. infantis (278 genes), transitional B. longum (138 genes), and B. longum subsp. longum (96 genes). We used the median abundance of the marker genes to stratify B. longum into clade-specific abundances ( Table S4 ). We observed B. longum subsp. infantis dominance in early infancy followed by an increase in abundance of transitional B. longum , which plateaued between 10 and 18 months of age ( Figure 2 D). B. longum subsp. longum expanded during the second year of life ( Figures 2 D, and S2 A). This corresponded to a succession pattern significantly linked to breastfeeding status, with B. longum subsp. infantis dominating during exclusive breastfeeding, transitional B. longum most commonly dominating during partial breastfeeding, and B. longum subsp longum dominating after breastfeeding cessation ( Figures S2 B and S2C).
To investigate potential ecological impacts of transitional B. longum on the gut microbiome, we investigated its interactions with other species using a correlation network approach ( Friedman and Alm, 2012 21. Friedman, J. ∙ Alm, E.J. Inferring correlation networks from genomic survey data PLoS Comput. Biol. 2012; 8 , e1002687 Crossref Scopus (1473) Google Scholar ; Watts et al., 2019 76. Watts, S.C. ∙ Ritchie, S.C. ∙ Inouye, M. ... FastSpar: rapid and scalable correlation estimation for compositional data Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :1064-1066 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). This revealed a strong and longitudinally consistent correlation pattern between the three B. longum clades, Bifidobacterium breve , and Bifidobacterium bifidum ( Figures 2 E and S2 D). Transitional B. longum had additional, weaker correlations common with B. longum subsp. infantis (e.g., three Eubacterium and two Roseburia spp.) and B. longum subsp. longum (four Collinsella spp . and E. massiliensis ). We did not detect a similar overlap of correlations between B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum . These results position transitional B. longum as a potential bridging factor in infant gut microbial ecology during the period of change in an infant’s diet, when succession between the three B. longum clades occurs. The overlap in correlation networks also suggests functional overlap between transitional B. longum and other B. longum subspecies, investigated below.
We asked whether transitional B. longum was present in other infant populations but potentially overlooked due to vast strain level variability within this B. longum clade and technical challenges in quantifying such variability from metagenomes. We quantified clade-specific marker genes in previously published gut metagenomes, allowing us to estimate the prevalence of transitional B. longum in infant and toddler populations (up to two years of age) across multiple continents ( Figure 3 A and Table S4 ). Although we observed transitional B. longum in seven of the eight investigated countries, its prevalence was markedly lower (≤18%) outside of Bangladesh ( Figure 3 B). Within Bangladesh, data from an independent study showed similar prevalence and longitudinal pattern observed in this cohort ( Figures 3 B and S2 E) ( Gehrig et al., 2019 25. Gehrig, J.L. ∙ Venkatesh, S. ∙ Chang, H.-W. ... Effects of microbiota-directed foods in gnotobiotic animals and undernourished children Science. 2019; 365 :eaau4732 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). To better understand the phylogenetic structure of the transitional B. longum clade and investigate potential geographic specificities, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using SNP haplotypes, as above, incorporating these gut metagenomes with a set of reference genomes ( Figure 3 C). This tree reflected a similar phylogenetic distribution of strains as the full genome phylogeny ( Figure 2 C) and confirmed that the transitional B. longum isolates from the Microbiota and Health Study clustered together with strains from the Gehrig et al. study and apart from B. longum subsp. suis/suillum genomes reportedly isolated from livestock. Samples from other geographic settings (mainly Europe) clustered with the latter, likely reflecting geographic trends or database biases toward western populations.
We observed a strong temporal succession pattern of the three B. longum clades ( Figures 2 D and S2 A) and transitional B. longum expansion during partial breastfeeding ( Figures 4 A, S2 B, and S2C). This led us to hypothesize that transitional B. longum harbors functional capacity to degrade both HMOs and complex polysaccharides in solid foods during the period when breastfeeding is combined with complementary foods. To better understand the genomic capacity to utilize complex glycans and the dynamics of succession within the infant gut, we compared representative genomes from the different B. longum clades. This analysis revealed a gene cluster dedicated to the utilization of fucosylated HMOs in transitional B. longum ( Figure 4 B) ( Garrido et al., 2016 24. Garrido, D. ∙ Ruiz-Moyano, S. ∙ Kirmiz, N. ... A novel gene cluster allows preferential utilization of fucosylated milk oligosaccharides in Bifidobacterium longum subsp longum SC596. Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 , 35045 Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar ). This cluster harbored genes encoding glycoside hydrolase families 95 (GH95) and 29 (GH29), α-fucosidases previously reported in Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense and B. longum subsp. infantis ( James et al., 2019 34. James, K. ∙ Bottacini, F. ∙ Contreras, J.I.S. ... Metabolism of the predominant human milk oligosaccharide fucosyllactose by an infant gut commensal Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 , 15427 Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar ; LoCascio et al., 2010 43. LoCascio, R.G. ∙ Desai, P. ∙ Sela, D.A. ... Broad conservation of milk utilization genes in Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis as revealed by comparative genomic hybridization Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76 :7373-7381 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). GH95 cleaves 2′-fucosyllactose (2′FL) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL), while GH29 has a preference toward 3-FL ( James et al., 2019 34. James, K. ∙ Bottacini, F. ∙ Contreras, J.I.S. ... Metabolism of the predominant human milk oligosaccharide fucosyllactose by an infant gut commensal Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 , 15427 Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar ). GH29 was present in all transitional B. longum genomes and absent from the closely related B. longum subsp. suis/suillum genomes ( Figure 4 C). Genes with high similarity to fucosylated HMO import system (fumS, fumT) were found in all transitional B. longum genomes, except for NCC 5001 which harbored several ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters similar to B. longum subsp. infantis , for which specificity has not been described ( LoCascio et al., 2010 43. LoCascio, R.G. ∙ Desai, P. ∙ Sela, D.A. ... Broad conservation of milk utilization genes in Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis as revealed by comparative genomic hybridization Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76 :7373-7381 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). All transitional B. longum genomes harbored genes implicated in fucose transport (fumP) and metabolization (fumB-E). Altogether, these results suggest that transitional B. longum strains have the genetic capacity to break down 2′FL and 3-FL and metabolize derived fucose.
In addition to HMO-degrading genes, transitional B. longum encoded 39 glycoside hydrolases (GHs) (15 more than B. longum subsp. infantis ) targeting dietary glycans (plant, fungal, or algal origin). Three GHs were not detected in other B. longum subspecies, while 36 were shared with one other subspecies ( Figure 4 C). Although degradation of α-glucans and other described catalytic activities were not unique to transitional B. longum (some members of the GH13 family have α-glucosidase and α-amylase activity and are found in all B. longum clades), they suggested a substrate preference for the fiber structures corresponding to α-glucosidase and α-amylase activity. Resistant α-glucans are enriched in foods consumed by infants in this cohort (e.g., rice, daal, suji, khichri) during weaning. Sorghum wheat (component of suji) and legumes (khichri and dal) are also a rich source of cellulose and hemicellulose (including β-glucans, xylans, and arabinoxylans) ( Guillon and Champ, 2002 26. Guillon, F. ∙ Champ, M.M.-J. Carbohydrate fractions of legumes: uses in human nutrition and potential for health Br. J. Nutr. 2002; 88 :S293-S306 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Keskin et al., 2022 36. Keskin, S.O. ∙ Ali, T.M. ∙ Ahmed, J. ... Physico-chemical and functional properties of legume protein, starch, and dietary fiber—A review Legume Science. 2022; 4 Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar ). High prevalence and abundance of transitional B. longum at weaning, and its genomic repertoire to utilize both breast milk HMOs and complex polysaccharides common in Bangladeshi infant diets, raises a question whether transitional B. longum is specifically adapted to infant populations sharing common feeding practices.
To better understand the differences in metabolic activities of the B. longum clades in vivo , we compared the metabolomic profiles between fecal samples labeled by the most abundant B. longum clade, but not breastfeeding status, and found statistically significant differences between the groups (p < 0.01 for all time points, PERMANOVA). This suggests that the B. longum clades and their associated taxa ( Figure 2 E) differentially impact fecal metabolomic profiles. We observed 11,517 metabolomic features that were associated with the abundance of at least one B. longum clade, using linear mixed effects models (LMMs) to control for potential covariates, including infant age, sex, and breastfeeding status (q < 0.01, Figure 5 A and Table S5 ). B. longum subsp. infantis associated with the greatest number of metabolites, followed by transitional B. longum and then B. longum subsp. longum ( Figure 5 A), with minimal overlap. Each clade was associated with a unique set of metabolites ( Figure 5 A). For example, indolelactate—an aromatic lactic acid produced by some Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut ( Henrick et al., 2021 30. Henrick, B.M. ∙ Rodriguez, L. ∙ Lakshmikanth, T. ... Bifidobacteria-mediated immune system imprinting early in life Cell. 2021; 184 :3884-3898.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laursen et al., 2021 39. Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Bifidobacterium species associated with breastfeeding produce aromatic lactic acids in the infant gut Nat Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1367-1382 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar )—was associated with B. longum subsp. infantis ( q = 1.9 × 10 −6 , beta-coefficient = 0.36) but not transitional B. longum (q = 0.50) nor B. longum subsp. longum (q = 0.60).
Transitional B. longum was positively associated with microbially derived metabolites, including imidazole propionic acid, citrulline, 5-hydroxyectoine, and N-acetylputrescine ( Figure 5 B and Table S5 ) and was most highly associated with pipecolic acid (q = 6.8 × 10 −12 , beta-coefficient = 0.33), a non-proteinogenic amino acid that serves as a precursor for many microbial secondary metabolites ( He, 2006 29. He, M. Pipecolic acid in microbes: biosynthetic routes and enzymes J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2006; 33 :401-407 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spearman rank correlations confirmed that transitional B. longum was consistently correlated with pipecolic acid across all time points ( Figure S3 ). Pipecolic acid was also associated with B. longum subsp. infantis , albeit at lower statistical significance (q = 1.5 × 10 −5 , beta-coefficient = 0.22), but not B. longum subsp. longum (q = 0.07, beta-coefficient = 0.11) . To identify possible substrates and downstream products, we used a mass shift network to link pipecolic acid to other metabolomic features using biochemically feasible molecular modifications ( methods ). One feature, hp_QI27050, putatively identified as 2-amino-6-hydroxyhexanoic acid ( Table S1 ), was linked to pipecolic acid and inversely associated with transitional B. longum (q = 6.7 × 10 −6 , beta-coefficient = −0.42) ( Figure 5 C). We observed a strong inverse correlation between hp_QI27050 and pipecolic acid across all samples (Spearman rho = −0.53, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ), suggesting that hp_QI27050 may represent a substrate for pipecolic acid production ( Figure 5 D). Furthermore, one marker gene for transitional B. longum is a dihydrodipicolinate synthetase family protein with a predicted Enzyme Commission (EC) number 4.3.3.7 that can catalyze a similar class of reactions as that connecting hp_QI27050 to pipecolic acid ( Figure 5 C and Table S4 ). We also observed a positive correlation between the absolute abundance of transitional B. longum and the ratio of pipecolic acid and hp_QI27050 (Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 , Figure 5 E), providing further evidence that transitional B. longum can carry out conversion of hp_QI27050 to pipecolic acid. Though we did not identify downstream secondary metabolites using the mass shift network, we found that pipecolic acid clustered with five unidentified features (intracluster mean Spearman rho >0.7) using co-abundance binning ( Franzosa et al., 2019 20. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ Sirota-Madi, A. ∙ Avila-Pacheco, J. ... Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease Nat Microbiol. 2019; 4 :293-305 Crossref Scopus (995) PubMed Google Scholar ). These co-varying features ( m / z values ranging 129.0752–188.0918) may represent potential new pipecolic acid-derived secondary metabolites ( Table S5 ).
Diarrheal infections are major causes of infant morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh and worldwide. In this cohort, the incidence of diarrheal episodes during the first two years of life ranged between zero and eight per subject ( Figure 6 A). We generated metagenomic and metabolomic data from 43 additional stool samples from 15 participants collected during diarrheal episodes representing both exclusive and recurrent episodes ( Table S6 ); most (n = 37, 86%) were from participants with five or more episodes. These samples had markedly lower microbial and metabolomic diversity irrespective of infant age (LMM, p = 0.0039, beta-coefficient = −0.27 [microbial Shannon’s diversity], p = 1.74 × 10 −38 , beta-coefficient = −0.34 [metabolomic richness], Figure 6 B). Species-level analysis revealed 57 species that were altered in diarrhea samples, including multiple diarrhea-depleted bifidobacteria (q < 0.1, Table S7 ). Of these, 28 (49%) were also associated with seasonal changes (in the same LMM), which comprised 59% of the total 47 species associated with the collection season.
Because diarrheal episodes ranged from benign to severe prolonged diarrhea with fever and bloody stools, we calculated subject-specific diarrhea severity scores that incorporated both length and severity of each episode as well as subject-specific diarrheal incidence ( Figure 6 C). We modeled associations between diarrhea severity scores and metagenomic/bolomic data in samples collected outside of diarrheal episodes using LMMs while controlling for other variables associated with the gut microbiome (as in analyses above) as covariates. Diarrhea severity score was associated with abundance of 11 bacterial species, including positive associations with five species in the genus Prevotella (incl. P. copri , Table S7 ). Of these, six (two Bifidobacterium and four Prevotella spp.) were also implicated in diarrheal samples . B. longum and B. breve were associated with all three covariates; they were depleted in diarrheal samples, inversely associated with diarrhea severity score, and depleted during the rainy monsoon (or pre-monsoon). All three B. longum clades were depleted in diarrhea samples (nominal p < 10 −4 , Figure S4 A). B. longum subsp. longum (nominal p = 0.0030) and transitional B. longum (p = 0.033), but not B. longum subsp. infantis (p = 0.096), were inversely associated with severity score ( Figures S4 B–S4D and Table S7 ). These associations did not persist when analyzing only samples prior to any diarrheal episodes, suggesting that they could represent microbial shifts stemming from and/or exacerbated by past episodes instead of being predictive of clinical outcomes.
Further investigation of microbial functions revealed 11 MetaCyc pathways associated with diarrhea severity score (7 positive, 4 inverse associations, Figure 6 D and Table S7 ). “PWY-3781: aerobic respiration I (cytochrome c )” was both increased in diarrhea samples (q = 0.0045) and positively associated with diarrhea severity score (q = 0.036) ( Figures 6 E and S4 E). The association persisted, though statistically less significant, when analyzing only samples collected prior to any diarrheal episodes (nominal p = 0.038, q = 0.22, Table S7 ). This could indicate that gut bacteria with aerobic respiration capabilities predisposed infants to severe diarrhea, making this signal potentially useful as a predictive biomarker. The aerobic respiration pathway tended to have a single contributing species per sample ( Figure 6 F), including opportunistic pathogens from genera Helicobacter and Neisseria . These species were not individually associated with diarrhea covariates, underscoring the importance of pathway analysis to detect shifts in taxonomically diffused microbial phenotypes or traits.
Among stool metabolite abundances, we detected 253 associations with diarrhea severity (q < 0.01, 37 positive, 216 inverse associations, Table S8 ). Phenyllactate, which is produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, showed an inverse association (q = 0.008, beta-coefficient = −0.18, Figure 6 G). Phenyllactate serves as an agonist of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3 (HCA 3 ), which is involved in regulation of immune function and energy homeostasis ( Laursen et al., 2021 39. Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Bifidobacterium species associated with breastfeeding produce aromatic lactic acids in the infant gut Nat Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1367-1382 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microbially produced phenyllactate may impact diarrhea severity by modulating HCA 3 activity and immune responses in the gut. The inverse association between phenyllactate and diarrhea severity did not persist in samples collected prior to any diarrhea episodes, suggesting that this may represent microbial shifts from diarrheal episodes such as the depletion of Bifidobacterium species noted above. Predicted metabolites most significantly associated with diarrhea severity had tentative annotations to triterpene saponins (e.g., soyasaponin I/III) and triterpenoids (e.g., ganoderic acid H) ( Table S8 ). Some associations persisted, albeit at lower statistical significance, in samples prior to any diarrheal episodes (e.g., soyasaponin I [q = 0.045, beta-coefficient = −0.67], soyasaponin III [q = 0.090, beta-coefficient = −0.75], Table S8 ). Because triterpenoids are composed of isoprene units, this observation is consistent with microbial pathway analysis, where we observed inverse association between “PWY-6270: isoprene biosynthesis I and diarrhea severity score in samples collected prior to any diarrheal episodes (nominal p = 0.015, q = 0.13, beta-coefficient = −0.12, Table S7 ). Collectively, changes partly congruent with seasonal shifts (increase in opportunistic pathogens, loss of bifidobacteria) increased aerobic respiration, and decreases in phenyllactate were associated with diarrhea severity and incidence.
To better understand the links between the early gut microbiome and infant growth, we analyzed the relationships between the abundances of bacterial taxa and growth Z scores (weight-for-length [WFL], weight-for-age [WFA], and length-for-age [LFA]) across participants. Performing LMMs on longitudinal samples across all time points revealed 14 bacterial taxa that were associated (q < 0.1) with at least one of the three growth measures ( Figure 7 A). B. longum subsp. infantis , Enterococcus raffinosus , and Staphylococcus aureus were positively associated with WFL and WFA, whereas C. jejuni and two Prevotella species were negatively associated with at least two growth measures. Given that we observed gradual longitudinal shifts in microbial composition ( Figures 1 B and 1C), including temporal shifts in abundances of the distinct B. longum clades, we repeated the LMMs using samples from the first and second years of life, respectively, to better dissect the contributions of bacterial taxa at different time points. Similar to the original analysis, we found that B. longum subsp. infantis and S. aureus were positively associated with WFL and WFA, whereas C. jejuni was negatively associated with WFA in samples collected within the first year ( Figure 7 A). The signals from B. longum subsp. infantis and S. aureus were lost in the analyses using samples collected in later time points where most infants have transitioned from exclusive to partial breastfeeding, while C. jejuni and Prevotella stercorea remained negatively associated with WFA and LFA ( Figure 7 A). These data highlight various bacterial taxa linked to infant growth and provide evidence that B. longum subsp. infantis may positively contribute to growth in early infancy when it is most dominant during exclusive breastfeeding ( Figures 2 D and S2 C).
Further investigation revealed 727, 1,499, and 526 stool metabolites that were associated with WFL, WFA, and LFA, respectively (q < 0.01, Table S9 ). Of these, 17 named metabolites were significantly associated with at least two growth measures ( Figure 7 B). Several of these metabolites were also tightly associated with the abundance of B. longum subsp. infantis ( Table S5 ); for example, indolelactate was associated with both WFL and WFA ( Figures 7 B and 7C), providing further evidence for the role of B. longum subsp. infantis and its metabolic activity in infant growth. We also found one named metabolite, N-acetylglutamate, that was positively associated with all three growth measures ( Figure 7 D). Consistent with this observation, two microbial pathways involving N-acetylglutamate—“GLUTORN-PWY: L ornithine biosynthesis” and “ARGSYNBSUB-PWY: L arginine biosynthesis II (acetyl cycle)”—were also positively associated with all three growth measures ( Table S9 ), with B. longum , Escherichia coli , and B. breve as the top contributing species ( Figures 7 E and S4 F). Similar to indolelactate ( Figure 7 C), N-acetylglutamate was enriched in stool in early infancy, and infants in the upper quartiles of growth showed consistently higher levels between 2 and 24 months compared to infants in the lower growth quartiles ( Figure 7 D).

Section: Discussion

We presented a longitudinal multi-omics investigation of fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles from a prospective cohort of 222 infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In silico and culture-based profiling of B. longum —the most abundant bacterial species in this cohort—revealed three distinct clades. Two clades corresponded to subspecies B. longum subsp. longum and B. longum subsp. infantis , while a third clade—termed transitional B. longum —shared some similarity to B. longum subsp. suis/suillum , with an ANI ≥98.1%. Interestingly, strains of human origin branched separately from subsp. suis/suillum , suggesting that the newly discovered clade may constitute a distinct human-adapted subspecies.
The clades followed a temporal succession pattern where B. longum subsp. infantis dominance in early infancy was followed by expansion of transitional B. longum at introduction of solid foods and B. longum subsp. longum abundance increased during the second year of life. The observation that transitional B. longum was highly prevalent in another Bangladeshi infant cohort ( Gehrig et al., 2019 25. Gehrig, J.L. ∙ Venkatesh, S. ∙ Chang, H.-W. ... Effects of microbiota-directed foods in gnotobiotic animals and undernourished children Science. 2019; 365 :eaau4732 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ), but at lower prevalence in other cohorts from industrialized settings, could reflect local feeding practices combining breastfeeding and complementary foods—an ancestral practice that has become rare in western countries despite World Health Organization recommendations to breastfeed until the age of two years. Accordingly, the genomes of transitional B. longum appeared to combine capabilities to utilize HMOs and complex glycans found in plant foods. The succession pattern of B. longum clades might similarly reflect an ancestral trajectory of microbiome development in early life with consequences for microbiome configurations and health outcomes later in life. In wider context, our observations underscore the importance of considering geographically specific baseline microbiome structure in intervention studies targeting young children and in designing early feeding recommendations.
Recent and ongoing studies continue to characterize the diversity of bifidobacteria in infant gut microbiomes ( Bunesova et al., 2016 9. Bunesova, V. ∙ Lacroix, C. ∙ Schwab, C. Fucosyllactose and L-fucose utilization of infant Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense BMC Microbiol. 2016; 16 :248 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kujawska et al., 2020 38.

Commun. 2016; 7 , 11939 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although elegant studies have contributed to this work in industrialized settings, studies from low resource settings are scarce. We were not able to investigate transitional B. longum prevalence in either Africa or South America due to a lack of publicly available gut metagenomes at the time of these analyses. Though the composition of human milk varies geographically, it is more uniform compared to global variations in complementary diets in infants and young children. Consequently, gut microbiomes adapted to thrive during mixed feeding could be accordingly more diverse, while also showing the signature capacity to use human milk glycans. We hypothesize that other geographic locations could harbor other bacterial strains with similar ecological roles during mixed infant feeding. For example, B. kashiwanohense in Kenyan infants harbored fucosidases and could therefore contribute to HMO metabolism during mixed feeding ( Bunesova et al., 2016 9. Bunesova, V. ∙ Lacroix, C. ∙ Schwab, C. Fucosyllactose and L-fucose utilization of infant Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium kashiwanohense BMC Microbiol. 2016; 16 :248 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). More external funding is needed to enable infant microbiome studies in underrepresented regions.
Although bifidobacteria colonization in breastfed infants is widely acknowledged as beneficial, mechanistic insights into the contributions of these bacteria to infant development remain limited. Two recent studies showed that bifidobacteria impacts intestinal homeostasis in early life through production of indolelactate, an aromatic lactic acid which exerts direct regulatory effects on immune cells ( Henrick et al., 2021 30. Henrick, B.M. ∙ Rodriguez, L. ∙ Lakshmikanth, T. ... Bifidobacteria-mediated immune system imprinting early in life Cell. 2021; 184 :3884-3898.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ; Laursen et al., 2021 39. Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Bifidobacterium species associated with breastfeeding produce aromatic lactic acids in the infant gut Nat Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1367-1382 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ). In one study, the authors uncovered an aromatic lactate dehydrogenase in Bifidobacterium species that converts aromatic amino acids to their lactic acid derivatives ( Laursen et al., 2021 39. Laursen, M.F. ∙ Sakanaka, M. ∙ von Burg, N. ... Bifidobacterium species associated with breastfeeding produce aromatic lactic acids in the infant gut Nat Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1367-1382 Crossref Scopus (182) PubMed Google Scholar ), providing a beautiful example of microbial chemistry that is relatively simple (i.e., involving a small subset of microbial enzymes responsible for transforming dietary or other substrates) yet significantly impacts host physiology. These findings also provide motivation for further investigations on microbial metabolites that may mediate the beneficial effects of bifidobacteria on infant health. Toward this goal, we performed untargeted metabolite profiling, revealing stool metabolites associated with each B. longum clade, including many unannotated metabolites that may represent microbially derived small molecules. Consistent with the predicted differences in metabolic activities discussed above, each B. longum clade was associated with a unique set of metabolites. Notably, we found that transitional B. longum was strongly associated with pipecolic acid, we also found evidence suggesting that it carries out the conversion of a putative metabolite (2-amino-6-hydroxyhexanoic acid) to produce pipecolic acid. It is interesting to speculate the role of pipecolic acid on gut ecology, though further investigations are needed to confirm the metabolism, identity, and activity of its putative substrate and potential downstream secondary metabolites, as well as roles of other gut microbes in its metabolism. Furthermore, although it remains challenging to dissect the currently unannotated gut metabolic diversity containing a complex milieu of potentially interacting dietary, host, and microbial compounds, we believe many microbially modified compounds could be annotated with their precursors identified by using a combination of isolate metabolomics ( Han et al., 2021 27. Han, S. ∙ Van Treuren, W. ∙ Fischer, C.R. ... A metabolomics pipeline for the mechanistic interrogation of the gut microbiome Nature. 2021; 595 :415-420 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), statistical machine learning ( Dührkop et al., 2021 18.

Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :462-471 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ), chemistry ( Rajakovich et al., 2021 54. Rajakovich, L.J. ∙ Fu, B. ∙ Bollenbach, M. ...

We further utilized the paired metagenomic and metabolomics datasets in our cohort to uncover features associated with health outcomes. We discovered numerous bacterial taxa, metabolic pathways, and metabolites associated with diarrheal episodes, and subject-specific diarrhea severity scores summarizing diarrhea incidence and severity of the episodes over the first two years of life. Features such as triterpenoids and a microbial isoprene biosynthesis pathway were also observed in stool samples collected prior to any diarrheal episodes, suggesting that they could contain predictive biomarkers of individual susceptibility to early life diarrhea. Triterpenoids are most widely known as a diverse group of natural products in plants, yet microbes including bacteria, archaea, and fungi are also capable of synthesizing and degrading such compounds. Together, these results may reflect dietary patterns and/or microbial activity with protective effects against future diarrhea.
Finally, B. longum subsp. infantis and its associated metabolites, such as indolelactate, were positively correlated with two measures of growth (WFL and WFA) in our cohort, thus adding to a growing body of evidence supporting the importance of B. longum subsp. infantis and its metabolites for infant development ( Barratt et al., 2022 2. Barratt, M.J. ∙ Nuzhat, S. ∙ Ahsan, K. ... Bifidobacterium infantis t reatment promotes weight gain in Bangladeshi infants with severe acute malnutrition Sci. Transl. Med. 2022; 14 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found N-acetylglutamate levels in the stool, as well as two microbial pathways involving N-acetylglutamate, to be positively associated with all tested growth measures including LFA. This observation is notable since bacterially produced N-acetyl amino acids enhanced growth in a Drosophila model ( Gallo et al., 2021 23. Gallo, M. ∙ Vento, J.M. ∙ Joncour, P. ...

A more recent study provided mechanistic insights on how a related compound, N-acetylglutamine, promoted growth in a Drosophila model via down-regulation of a peptidoglycan recognition protein and immune effectors against beneficial microbes, thus providing an intriguing example of host-microbe symbiosis wherein bacterial metabolic products mediate host immune regulation and growth ( Gallo et al., 2021 23.

Section: Limitations of the study

The data presented here (including associations with metabolites and growth parameters) could be population specific. Further investigations, including testing of predictive models in independent cohorts, are needed to understand the complex diet-microbe-host interactions that may influence the incidence and severity of diarrhea. An additional limitation of determining contributions of diet and microbial activity to diarrheal episodes is the existence of strong reporter and data collection biases. Future reverse translational studies are warranted to deconvolute the specific contribution of B. longum strains in infant health, growth, and development.

The Microbiota and Health Study (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02361164 ) was a longitudinal, community-based cohort study in Nandipara, a peri-urban community of Dhaka, Bangladesh conducted from April 2013 to October 2016 as previously described ( Vidal et al., 2019 75. Vidal, K. ∙ Sultana, S. ∙ Patron, A.P. ... Microbiota and Health Study: A Prospective Cohort of Respiratory and Diarrheal Infections and Associated Risk Factors in Bangladeshi Infants under Two Years (medRxiv) 2019 Google Scholar ). 267 infants born to healthy mothers were followed from birth to two years of age. Demographic, maternal health, socioeconomic and household characteristics were collected at baseline. Infants’ anthropometry as well as breastfeeding status were recorded at birth and at bimonthly intervals from birth to 12 months of age, and then at 15, 18 and 24 months of age. Fecal samples were collected at birth (between 0 and 10 days post-delivery, median = 1 day, time point labeled as “birth”), during subsequent scheduled visits, and when possible during illness episodes. Active surveillance of diarrheal and respiratory infections was conducted by a community-based team of nurses supervised by a physician.
The study protocol was approved by the local independent Institutional Review Board. The study was designed and conducted following Good Clinical Practice, in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and in full conformity with the principles of the Belmont Report (April, 1979). Prior to the start of the study, all participants signed an informed written consent. The study was registered at https://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02361164.
Stool samples were initially stored at −20 °C at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research (Bangladesh) and subsequently transferred to −80°C for shipment on dry ice to Nestlé Research where they were stored at −80°C until analysis. Total DNA was extracted from 200 mg of fecal material using the QIAamp DNA Stool minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with an additional series of mechanical disruption steps (4 × 60 s). This was followed by bead-based purification. Metagenomic sequencing libraries were prepared for 1,377 stool samples using 2 ng of input DNA with the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Prior to sequencing, libraries were pooled by collecting equal volumes of each library. Insert sizes and concentrations for each pooled library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies) prior to sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 151 bp paired-end reads, resulting in an average of 26.4 million reads per sample. Data were analyzed using the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation ( https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard ). Twenty four of the 1,377 samples had less than 5M reads and were excluded from downstream analysis. These samples were primarily diarrheal samples (n = 13 samples) or early samples collected at 2 months of age (n = 7) and poor sequencing coverage was a consequence of low DNA yield from these samples (which was likely a consequence of low bacterial biomass).
Total bacterial load in each stool sample (expressed in 16S rRNA gene copy number per gram of stool) was determined by qPCR using an universal probe and primers set as previously described ( Nadkarni et al., 2002 48. Nadkarni, M.A. ∙ Martin, F.E. ∙ Jacques, N.A. ... Determination of bacterial load by real-time PCR using a broad-range (universal) probe and primers set Microbiology. 2002; 148 :257-266 Crossref Scopus (1540) PubMed Google Scholar ) (forward primer: 5′-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3′, probe: 5′-CGTATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC-3′).
B. longum isolates were obtained from stool samples by cultivation on Eugon Tomato agar ( Sutter et al., 1980 66. Sutter, V.L. ∙ Citron, D.M. ∙ Finegold, S.M. Wadsworth Anaerobic Bacteriology Manual C. V. Mosby Company, 1980 Google Scholar ), followed by preliminary identification using MALDI-ToF MS (Biotyper, Bruker Scientific Instruments, Billerica, USA) and confirmed by sequencing. PacBio sequencing was performed according to supplier’s recommendations. The sequencing data was further assembled using the Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process (HGAP4) de novo assembly analysis application available through the SMRT Link portal (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, USA). Obtained sequences were deposited at the Joint Genome Institute IMG/M database (Study ID Gs0156595). Isolates identified as being part of the B. longum species were deposited in the Nestlé Culture Collection (Nestlé Research, Lausanne, Switzerland). Obtained sequences were compared to publicly available B. longum genomes ( Table S3 ) by Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) computed using OrthoANIu v1.2 ( Yoon et al., 2017 80. Yoon, S.-H. ∙ Ha, S.-M. ∙ Lim, J. ... A large-scale evaluation of algorithms to calculate average nucleotide identity Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 2017; 110 :1281-1286 Crossref Scopus (2278) PubMed Google Scholar ). The generated matrix of pairwise genome similarities was further used to build a UPGMA phylogenetic tree using the BioNumerics software (v8.0, bioMérieux SA, Marcy l’Etoile, France).
Fully closed genomic sequences of transitional B. longum and B. longum subsp. infantis strains were annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) ( Tatusova et al., 2016 68. Tatusova, T. ∙ DiCuccio, M. ∙ Badretdin, A. ... NCBI prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :6614-6624 Crossref Scopus (4342) PubMed Google Scholar ). The annotated transitional B. longum genomes were then aligned and compared to the B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 and B. kashiwanohense APCKJ1 genomes ( Table S3 ) using the BioNumerics software (version 8.0, BioMérieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France).
Selected genomes of B. longum listed in Table S3 were annotated to CAZymes combining dbCAN2 ( Yin et al., 2012 79. Yin, Y. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Yang, J. ... dbCAN: a web resource for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :W445-W451 Crossref Scopus (1241) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2018 81. Zhang, H. ∙ Yohe, T. ∙ Huang, L. ... dbCAN2: a meta server for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W95-W101 Crossref Scopus (1327) PubMed Google Scholar ) tools and databases HMMdb (v8) and DIAMOND (v2.0.8) ( Buchfink et al., 2021 8. Buchfink, B. ∙ Reuter, K. ∙ Drost, H.-G. Sensitive protein alignments at tree-of-life scale using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :366-368 Crossref Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar ). Query sequences with >0.50 coverage and e-value < 1 × 10 −15 were annotated with HMMER according to the dbCAN CAZyme domain HMM database. DIAMOND was also used to annotate query sequences with hits in the CAZy database ( Lombard et al., 2014 44. Lombard, V. ∙ Golaconda Ramulu, H. ∙ Drula, E. ... The carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy) in 2013 Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 :D490-D495 Crossref Scopus (4642) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://www.cazy.org/ ) with >0.90 identity, and e-value < 1e-102. HMMER annotation was prioritized and used in instances of mismatched CAZyme annotations of query sequences between HMMER and DIAMOND tools. Only CAZyme families and subfamilies encoding Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs) and Polysaccharide Lyases (PLs) were used for comparative analyses of B. longum clades.
To assess the geographic distribution of transitional B. longum, metagenomic sequencing reads from infant stool samples between 0 and 2 years of age coming from seven other studies in different geographic settings (n = 3,216) were downloaded from public repositories ( Table S4 ) and added to the current Microbiota and Health Study dataset (n = 1,377). Adaptor sequences were removed using Trim Galore! and human host sequences were removed using KneadData v0.7.9 ( https://bitbucket.org/biobakery/kneaddata ). For all these datasets, transitional B. longum prevalence ( Figure 3 B) and phylogenetic tree of the dominant B. longum strains ( Figure 3 C) were determined using the pipeline described in the "Microbiome bioinformatics" methods section below (MetaPhlAn version 3.0.7 (09 Dec 2020) and HUMANn version 3.0.0) ( Beghini et al., 2021 3. Beghini, F. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Blanco-Míguez, A. ... Integrating Taxonomic, Functional, and Strain-Level Profiling of Diverse Microbial Communities with bioBakery 3 Elife. 2021; 10 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Stool samples were collected and stored at −20°C for variable amounts of time prior to moving to a −80°C freezer for long term storage. Two pilot studies were conducted to investigate whether the duration of storage at −20°C would impact stool metabolites. Metabolomics profiles of a subset of stool samples were generated using the methods described below. The first pilot study (Pilot A) was conducted to compare the effect of short term versus long term storage at −20°C (n = 57 stool samples). A second pilot study (Pilot B) was performed to compare the effect of variable storage duration at −20°C (n = 107 stool samples). Results from these pilot studies suggested that the length of storage at −20°C had a marginal effect on stool metabolites.
Pre-weighed stool samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of water (weight:volume) using a Tissuelyser in two 2-min increments at a frequency of 20Hz, and the homogenates were aliquoted for metabolite profiling analyses. Metabolomic profiles were generated using a combination of four liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods (full scan MS profiling using Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole Orbitrap and Exactive Plus Mass Spectrometers, Thermo Fisher Scientific) measuring complementary metabolite classes; 1) HILIC-pos, positive ion mode MS analyses of polar metabolites, 2) HILIC-neg, negative ion mode MS analyses of polar metabolites, 3) C18-neg, negative ion mode analyses of metabolites of intermediate polarity, 4) C8-pos, polar and non-polar lipids. The details of the methods are described in ( Franzosa et al., 2019 20. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ Sirota-Madi, A. ∙ Avila-Pacheco, J. ... Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease Nat Microbiol. 2019; 4 :293-305 Crossref Scopus (995) PubMed Google Scholar ). These four methods cover a range of compounds from polar metabolites (for example, organic acids), lipids (for example, triglycerides) and free fatty acids to bile acids. For the analysis queue in each method, subjects were randomized and longitudinal samples from each subject were randomized and analyzed as a group. Additionally, pairs of pooled reference samples were inserted into the queue at intervals of approximately 20 samples for quality control and data standardization. Samples were prepared for each method using extraction procedures that are matched for use with the chromatography conditions. Data were acquired using LC-MS systems comprised of Nexera X2 U-HPLC systems (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) coupled to Q Exactive/Exactive Plus orbitrap mass spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Raw LC-MS data were acquired to the data acquisition computer interfaced to each LC-MS system and then stored on a robust and redundant file storage system (Isilon Systems) accessed via the internal network at the Broad Institute. Nontargeted data were processed using Progenesis QIsoftware (v 2.0, Nonlinear Dynamics) to detect and de-isotope peaks, perform chromatographic retention time alignment, and integrate peak areas. Metabolite peaks were manually reviewed for quality of integration and compared against known standards to confirm identity, resulting in a total of 797 identified metabolites ( Table S1 ). Peaks of unknown identity were tracked by method, m / z and retention time. Temporal drift was monitored and normalized with the intensities of features measured in the pooled reference samples. Data were median-normalized to account for signal differences caused by variable water contents in the sample.
Peaks not matching the internal database (unknown) were matched via adduct subtraction and molecular formula match to compounds, downloaded from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) on Sep 16, 2020. The measured m / z values were adjusted for method-specific adducts and molecular formulas matching to within 5 ppm were selected as candidate identifiers. When multiple molecular formulas matched the adduct-adjusted mass (as a result of multiple potential adducts), one with minimal ppm difference was selected. The following adducts are assumed for different LC-MS methods: [M−H](−) for negative mode methods (C18-neg, HILIC-neg) and [M + H](+), [M + NH 4 ](+), [M + Na](+), [M-H 2 0 + H](+) for positive mode methods (C8-pos, HILIC-pos). This yielded molecular formula matches for 23,980 (45.1%) peaks ( Table S1 ), with a median of 3 candidate annotations per annotated peak (fifth percentile: 1, 95th percentile: 34).
Pairs of LC-MS peaks were linked into a molecular network using mass gains or losses with a method similar to Hartmann et al. (2017) 28. Hartmann, A.C. ∙ Petras, D. ∙ Quinn, R.A. ... Meta-mass shift chemical profiling of metabolomes from coral reefs Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :11685-11690 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar and Quinn et al. (2020) 53. Quinn, R.A. ∙ Melnik, A.V. ∙ Vrbanac, A. ... Global chemical effects of the microbiome include new bile-acid conjugations Nature. 2020; 579 :123-129 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar . Peaks with reference standards or molecular formula matches were represented as nodes in a graph and the corresponding (adduct-adjusted) theoretical m / z was assumed as a neutral mass. An edge between two peaks is assumed if 1) their retention time difference is within 0.5 min, and 2) the difference in their neutral masses equals mass shifts representing putative chemical groups: (H 2 , 2.016 m / z , CH 2 -H 2 0, 3.955 m / z , 2H 2 , 4.030 m / z , C, 12.000 m / z , CH 2 , 14.016 m / z , CH 3 , 14.020 m / z , O, 15.995 m / z , CH 4 , 16.040 m / z , OH, 17.010 m / z , NH 3 , 17.030 m / z , H 2 O, 18.010 m / z , C 2 , 24.020 m / z , C 2 H 2 , 26.016 m / z , CO, 27.996 m / z , C 2 H 4 , 28.032 m / z , C 2 H 6 , 30.050 m / z , CH 2 O, 30.910 m / z , C 2 H 2 O, 42.009 m / z , C 2 H 3 O, 42.050 m / z , CO 2 , 43.990 m / z , CH 2 O 2 , 46.010 m / z , C 2 H 2 O 2 , 56.006 m / z , C 3 H 4 O, 56.025 m / z , C 4 H 8 , 56.060 m / z , C 2 H 8 , 56.064 m / z , SO 3 , 79.960 m / z , C 5 H 8 O 4 , 132.040 m / z , C 6 H 10 O 4 , 146.060 m / z , C 6 H 10 O 5 , 162.050 m / z , C 12 H 18 O 11 , 338.090 m / z ). In addition, the observed versus theoretical difference in mass shifts should not exceed 5 ppm.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.3 and 4.1.1). Associations between microbial taxa or stool metabolites and other variables were tested using Multivariate Association with Linear Models (MaAsLin2, version 0.99.18 and 1.6.0) ( Mallick et al., 2021 45. Mallick, H. ∙ Rahnavard, A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ... Multivariable association discovery in population-scale meta-omics studies PLoS Comput. Biol. 2021; 17 , e1009442 Crossref Scopus (599) Google Scholar ). FDR corrected p values from MaAsLin2 were reported as q-values, with q < 0.01 used as the significance cutoff for metabolomic features and q < 0.1 used as the significance cutoff for microbial taxa and pathways unless otherwise specified.
Metagenomic sequencing reads were processed to remove adaptor sequences using Trim Galore! followed by trimming and removal of human sequences with KneadData v0.7.2. Species-level taxonomic profiles were generated by MetaPhlAn2 v2.9.21 (21 Aug 2019) using species-specific marker database v2.94 (Jan 2019) ( Beghini et al., 2021 3. Beghini, F. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Blanco-Míguez, A. ... Integrating Taxonomic, Functional, and Strain-Level Profiling of Diverse Microbial Communities with bioBakery 3 Elife. 2021; 10 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MetaCyc pathway profiles were generated by HUMANn2 v0.11.2 ( Franzosa et al., 2018 19. Franzosa, E.A. ∙ McIver, L.J. ∙ Rahnavard, G. ... Species-level functional profiling of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :962-968 Crossref Scopus (913) PubMed Google Scholar ). Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were constructed using a workflow that included assembly by megaHIT v1.1.4 ( Li et al., 2015 40. Li, D. ∙ Liu, C.-M. ∙ Luo, R. ... MEGAHIT: an ultra-fast single-node solution for large and complex metagenomics assembly via succinct de Bruijn graph Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :1674-1676 Crossref Scopus (3795) PubMed Google Scholar ), open reading frames prediction by Prodigal v2.6.3 ( Hyatt et al., 2010 32.

Phylogenetic tree of the dominant B. longum strains in each stool sample ( Figure 2 B) was generated based on StrainPhlAn single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes using the phangorn R package ( Truong et al., 2017 69. Truong, D.T. ∙ Tett, A. ∙ Pasolli, E. ... Microbial strain-level population structure and genetic diversity from metagenomes Genome Res. gr. 2017; 27 638.116 626, – gr.216242.116 Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar ). Briefly, similarities between strain-specific SNP haplotypes were computed using the Jukes and Cantor (JC69) model, and an initial tree was constructed using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) hierarchical clustering. The tree was optimized using the maximum likelihood method, by iterative optimization of edge lengths, base frequencies and topology. Visualizations were generated using the ggtree R package.
B. longum clade abundances were quantified as follows. A cohort specific B. longum pangenome was built using a collection of existing reference genomes (listed in Table S4 , Sheet “Genomes”) by first predicting open reading frames using Prodigal (56) and clustering the resulting gene sets to non-redundant gene clusters (95% identity 90% coverage) using CD-HIT ( Fu et al., 2012 22. Fu, L. ∙ Niu, B. ∙ Zhu, Z. ... CD-HIT: accelerated for clustering the next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :3150-3152 Crossref Scopus (5614) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene clusters that were harbored by all genomes of a given clade and not identified in any genomes from the other two clades were used as clade-specific marker genes for that given clade ( Table S4 ). This definition was slightly relaxed for transitional B. longum clade since the clade appeared to have a higher amount of genetic diversity and therefore lacked such universal marker genes. Instead, marker genes were required to be present on at least five genomes, at least three of which were new isolates sequenced from this cohort. This resulted in n = 138 marker genes for transitional B. longum , n = 278 marker genes for B. longum subsp. infantis and n = 96 marker genes for B. longum subsp. longum . Clade-specific relative and absolute abundances were estimated by first mapping marker gene cluster centroids against the B. longum pangenome in ChocoPhlAn database utilized by HUMANn2. The median of B. longum -specific gene family quantification from HUMANn2 were then used to quantify clade-specific relative abundances, 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 = 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑒 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ) ∑ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑒 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁡ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑒 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ) , where marker gene abundance clade is a vector of clade-specific marker gene quantifications from HUMAnN2. Clade-specific abundances, abundance clade , sum up to 1.0 (or 100%). Clade-specific absolute abundances were estimated by multiplying B. longum species-specific absolute abundance estimates with each clade-specific abundance.
We applied a prevalence filter for statistical analyses, retaining only metabolomic features that are present in at least 30% of all samples (41,751 of 53,158 features retained). All features were retained for principal component and diversity analyses shown in Figure 1 . Log-transformed quantification values of metabolomic features (with zero values imputed with half of the minimum value of each feature) were used for statistical analyses described below.
To identify subject specific changes in fecal microbiome and metabolome in relation to their susceptibility of having recurrent diarrheal episodes, we calculated subject specific diarrhea severity score 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑦 = ∑ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑠 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑛 ⋅ ( 1 + 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑑 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑙 + 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ) , where duration is the duration of each episode in days, blood in stool and fever equal to one if the diarrheal episode involved bloody stools or fever, respectively, or zero if not. The scores of all episodes per subject are summed up to constitute a subject specific diarrhea severity score. One subject with an outlier severity score of 20.25 was excluded from downstream analyses incorporating the severity scores. Linear modeling to assess association between diarrhea severity scores and microbiome features prior to diarrheal episodes incorporated samples collected prior to the first diarrheal episode from the participants who had one or more diarrheal episode and samples at 2, 6 and 10 months of age from the participants who did not have any diarrheal episodes (and therefore had diarrhea severity score of 0).
Participant growth was measured on every scheduled clinic visit (approximately similar to the stool collection schedule). Age specific weight-for-age, length-for-age and weight-for-length z scores were calculated using the anthro R package, based on World Health Organization Child Growth Standards.
