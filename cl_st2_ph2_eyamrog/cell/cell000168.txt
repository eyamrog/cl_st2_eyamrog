Title: Multiple Signaling Roles of CD3ε and Its Application in CAR-T Cell Therapy


Abstract: Summary

A T cell receptor (TCR) mediates antigen-induced signaling through its associated CD3ε, δ, γ, and ζ, but the contributions of different CD3 chains remain elusive. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we simultaneously quantitated the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of all CD3 chains upon TCR stimulation. A subpopulation of CD3ε ITAMs was mono-phosphorylated, owing to Lck kinase selectivity, and specifically recruited the inhibitory Csk kinase to attenuate TCR signaling, suggesting that TCR is a self-restrained signaling machinery containing both activating and inhibitory motifs. Moreover, we found that incorporation of the CD3ε cytoplasmic domain into a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improved antitumor activity of CAR-T cells. Mechanistically, the Csk-recruiting ITAM of CD3ε reduced CAR-T cytokine production whereas the basic residue rich sequence (BRS) of CD3ε promoted CAR-T persistence via p85 recruitment. Collectively, CD3ε is a built-in multifunctional signal tuner, and increasing CD3 diversity represents a strategy to design next-generation CAR.

Section: Introduction

T cells can discriminate a minute amount of non-self antigens with precision from a sea of self-antigens and elicit specific adaptive immune response against invading pathogens or cancer cells ( Glanville et al., 2017 28.

The major receptor responsible for antigen recognition in T cells is the T cell receptor (TCR) composed of one antigen recognition subunit TCRαβ and three signaling subunits CD3εδ, εγ, and ζζ ( Alcover et al., 2018 2.

Structural basis of assembly of the human T cell receptor-CD3 complex Nature. 2019; 573 :546-552 Crossref Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD3 subunits all contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs; YxxL/Ix 6-8 YxxL/I) and use tyrosine phosphorylation as a functional switch to trigger downstream signaling ( Courtney et al., 2018 14. Courtney, A.H. ∙ Lo, W.L. ∙ Weiss, A. TCR Signaling: Mechanisms of Initiation and Propagation Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43 :108-123 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD3ε, δ, and γ each contain one ITAM whereas CD3ζ contains three ITAMs, and thus the entire TCR-CD3 complex contains 10 ITAMs with 20 tyrosine phosphorylation sites to deliver diverse signals in response to different antigen stimulation. Despite sharing the YxxL/Ix 6-8 YxxL/I motif, each CD3 ITAM has a distinctive sequence, suggesting a specific role might exist ( Love and Hayes, 2010 46. Love, P.E. ∙ Hayes, S.M. ITAM-mediated signaling by the T-cell antigen receptor Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2 :a002485 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD3 sequence diversity appears as early as fish in the evolutional process, but its physiological importance remains unclear ( Pettinello et al., 2017 52. Pettinello, R. ∙ Redmond, A.K. ∙ Secombes, C.J. ... Evolutionary history of the T cell receptor complex as revealed by small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2017; 74 :125-135 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Structurally, CD3ε and ζ ITAMs associate with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to form amphipathic helices whereas CD3δ and γ ITAMs stay in the cytosol as intrinsically disordered peptides ( Aivazian and Stern, 2000 1.

USA. 2011; 108 :19323-19328 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Functionally, whether CD3 ITAMs have qualitative or quantitative roles is still debated ( Combadière et al., 1996 13. Combadière, B. ∙ Freedman, M. ∙ Chen, L. ... Qualitative and quantitative contributions of the T cell receptor zeta chain to mature T cell apoptosis J. Exp.

TCR ITAM multiplicity is required for the generation of follicular helper T-cells Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6982 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; James, 2018 38. James, J.R. Tuning ITAM multiplicity on T cell receptors can control potency and selectivity to ligand density Sci Signal. 2018; 11 :eaan1088 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Eliminating ITAM diversity while keeping ITAM multiplicity severely impairs TCR function, indicating a qualitative nature of CD3 ITAM signaling ( Bettini et al., 2017 6. Bettini, M.L. ∙ Chou, P.C. ∙ Guy, C.S. ... Cutting Edge: CD3 ITAM Diversity Is Required for Optimal TCR Signaling and Thymocyte Development J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :1555-1560 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD3 ITAMs are mainly phosphorylated by Lck and dephosphorylated by CD45. Dual-phosphorylated CD3 ITAMs interact with the tandem SH2 domains of Zap70 with a low nanomolar affinity, thus releasing Zap70 from an autoinhibited conformation to activate downstream signaling cascade ( Au-Yeung et al., 2018 3. Au-Yeung, B.B. ∙ Shah, N.H. ∙ Shen, L. ... ZAP-70 in Signaling, Biology, and Disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :127-156 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mono-phosphorylated CD3 ITAM, however, shows minimal binding with Zap70 ( Isakov et al., 1995 37. Isakov, N. ∙ Wange, R.L. ∙ Burgess, W.H. ... ZAP-70 binding specificity to T cell receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs: the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 bind distinct tyrosine-based activation motifs with varying affinity J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181 :375-380 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, the CD3ε ITAM has the lowest affinity to Zap70 among CD3 ITAMs ( Osman et al., 1996 51. Osman, N. ∙ Turner, H. ∙ Lucas, S. ... The protein interactions of the immunoglobulin receptor family tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the T cell receptor zeta subunits and the CD3 gamma, delta and epsilon chains Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26 :1063-1068 Crossref Scopus (97) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutating the N-terminal but not the C-terminal tyrosine of CD3ε ITAM abolishes ITAM phosphorylation, suggesting differing roles of the two tyrosines ( Guirado et al., 2002 31. Guirado, M. ∙ de Aós, I. ∙ Orta, T. ... Phosphorylation of the N-terminal and C-terminal CD3-epsilon-ITAM tyrosines is differentially regulated in T cells Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291 :574-581 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the two tyrosines in CD3ζ ITAM1 were reported to be functionally different ( Sunder-Plassmann et al., 1997 60. Sunder-Plassmann, R. ∙ Lialios, F. ∙ Madsen, M. ... Functional analysis of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signal transduction: the two YxxL segments within a single CD3zeta-ITAM are functionally distinct Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27 :2001-2009 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The functional diversity of ITAMs has been also demonstrated in the context of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). All existing CAR constructs utilize CD3ζ cytoplasmic domain as a fixed module to deliver a major activation signal. The three CD3ζ ITAMs, however, have different contributions to the antitumor function of CAR-T cells ( Feucht et al., 2019 24. Feucht, J. ∙ Sun, J. ∙ Eyquem, J. ... Calibration of CAR activation potential directs alternative T cell fates and therapeutic potency Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :82-88 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ), reflecting the need for better understanding of ITAM signaling. Whether CD3ε, δ, or γ could also be utilized in CARs has not been extensively tested.
In this study, we developed a quantitative mass spectrometry method to simultaneously measure phosphorylation dynamics of all TCR tyrosines. We stimulated TCR under various conditions to dissect the roles of Lck and CD45 in shaping ITAM phosphorylation patterns. A subpopulation of the CD3ε ITAM was found to be mono-phosphorylated under all conditions. We therefore determined the effector molecule recruited by CD3ε ITAM by biochemical and biophysical assays. Subsequently, we incorporated CD3ε cytoplasmic domain into 28Z CARs with different antigen specificity. CAR signaling and function were studied both in vitro and in vivo .

Section: Results

Phosphorylation of CD3 ITAMs has been detected in whole-cell lysate samples by mass spectrometry, but absolute quantitation is lacking ( Goodfellow et al., 2015 29. Goodfellow, H.S. ∙ Frushicheva, M.P. ∙ Ji, Q. ... The catalytic activity of the kinase ZAP-70 mediates basal signaling and negative feedback of the T cell receptor pathway Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 :ra49 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the large number of tyrosine sites in a TCR complex, it is technically challenging to simultaneously quantitate all phosphorylation sites with temporal resolution. Here, we developed a targeted-IP-multiplex-light-absolute-quantitative mass spectrometry (TIMLAQ-MS) method to enable absolute quantitation of all CD3 ITAM phosphorylation at different time points in a single measurement ( Figure 1 ). Our method does not require usage of isotopic heavy-labeling peptides that are typically used in previous quantitative methods ( Curran et al., 2015 15. Curran, T.G. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ma, D.J. ... MARQUIS: a multiplex method for absolute quantification of peptides and posttranslational modifications Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :5924 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gerber et al., 2003 26. Gerber, S.A. ∙ Rush, J. ∙ Stemman, O. ... Absolute quantification of proteins and phosphoproteins from cell lysates by tandem MS Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :6940-6945 Crossref Scopus (1579) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kirkpatrick et al., 2005 40. Kirkpatrick, D.S. ∙ Gerber, S.A. ∙ Gygi, S.P. The absolute quantification strategy: a general procedure for the quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications Methods. 2005; 35 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). In TIMLAQ-MS, six standard samples were mixed together with four analyte samples to serve as internal reference. To prepare the standard samples, synthesized phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated CD3 peptides of 6 different concentrations with a range of 330 folds ( Table S1 ) were mixed with background proteins immunoprecipitated from unstimulated T cells by an IgG control antibody. The peptide concentration ranges were customized to generate a linear standard curve for each tyrosine site. To prepare the analyte samples of native TCR, α-hCD3ε (OKT3) was used to immunoprecipitate the TCR-CD3 complex from stimulated T cells at four different time points. A mild detergent digitonin was used to preserve the whole TCR-CD3 complex ( Call et al., 2002 9. Call, M.E. ∙ Pyrdol, J. ∙ Wiedmann, M. ... The organizing principle in the formation of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex Cell. 2002; 111 :967-979 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ). Western blotting revealed that CD3δ/γ/ζ IP efficiencies were ∼50% and CD3ε IP efficiency was between 50% and 75%, which indicated that OKT3 immunoprecipitated not only the TCR-CD3 complex but also intracellular CD3ε that were not part of the complex ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Each of the standard and analyte samples was subjected to cysteine reduction and alkylation, trypsin digestion, and isobaric tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling processes ( Figure 1 A; Figures S1 C and S1D), after which all samples were mixed and loaded to a TiO 2 column for separation of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides. The methionine residues were further converted to methionine sulfoxide by H 2 O 2 treatment to avoid interference caused by undesired modifications during the measurement ( Figures S1 E and S1F).
Both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were implemented on a high-resolution mass spectrometer ( Figure 1 B). DDA was used to identify precursors containing different CD3 tyrosine sites at phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated state. The mass/charge value and retention time of each CD3 precursor were determined for targeted quantitation ( Table S2 ). PRM was then performed to quantitate the identified target CD3 precursors. The intensity of TMT reporter carried by each CD3 precursor was measured for all standard and analyte samples. Linear standard curves with high coefficients of determination were generated for absolute quantitation of CD3 tyrosine phosphorylation level (pY/(pY+Y)) ( Figure 1 C).
TCR phosphorylation level is reciprocally controlled by Lck-mediated phosphorylation ( Shah et al., 2018 56. Shah, N.H. ∙ Löbel, M. ∙ Weiss, A. ... Fine-tuning of substrate preferences of the Src-family kinase Lck revealed through a high-throughput specificity screen eLife. 2018; 7 :e35190 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CD45-mediated dephosphorylation ( Chang et al., 2016 12. Chang, V.T. ∙ Fernandes, R.A. ∙ Ganzinger, K.A. ... Initiation of T cell signaling by CD45 segregation at ‘close contacts’ Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :574-582 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore designed three stimulation conditions to dissect the roles of these two factors ( Figures 2 A–2C): a direct TCR activation condition, under which T cells were stimulated by (1) α-hCD3ε (OKT3) to study TCR phosphorylation under both Lck and CD45 regulations; (2) a phosphatase inhibition condition, under which T cells were stimulated by pervanadate, a pan phosphatase inhibitor, to study TCR phosphorylation under Lck regulation; and (3) a cell-free reconstituted TCR/Lck condition, under which CD3 chains and Lck were co-attached to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) to study Lck regulation in a well-defined membrane system ( Figure S2 ) ( Hui and Vale, 2014 34. Hui, E. ∙ Vale, R.D. In vitro membrane reconstitution of the T-cell receptor proximal signaling network Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :133-142 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). OKT3 was used at a non-saturating concentration to avoid high background noise and to mimic physiological condition under which antigen number is often limited.
The tyrosine sites of all CD3 chains were faithfully quantified, except CD3δ-Y2 whose signal was interfered by background proteins under the direct TCR activation or phosphatase inhibition condition. CD3 phosphorylation induced by OKT3 was weaker than that by pervanadate, reflecting the weak binding affinity of OKT3 with CD3 heterodimer ( Kjer-Nielsen et al., 2004 41. Kjer-Nielsen, L. ∙ Dunstone, M.A. ∙ Kostenko, L. ... Crystal structure of the human T cell receptor CD3 epsilon gamma heterodimer complexed to the therapeutic mAb OKT3 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101 :7675-7680 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ). In general, CD3 ITAM phosphorylation patterns were largely similar across the three foregoing conditions, indicating the dominant role of Lck regulation. The three ITAMs of CD3ζ, however, had condition-specific features. Under the direct TCR activation condition, the phosphorylation level of CD3ζ ITAM1 was higher than that of CD3ζ ITAM2/3. This difference was not observed under the phosphatase inhibition or the reconstituted TCR/Lck condition. This discrepancy suggested that CD45 might have a selectivity on the three CD3ζ ITAMs. Indeed, an on-membrane fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiment showed that CD45 dephosphorylated CD3ζ ITAM1 less efficiently than CD3ζ ITAM2 and 3, thus leading to higher CD3ζ ITAM1 phosphorylation levels when TCR was stimulated directly ( Figure 2 D).
Among all CD3 ITAMs, CD3ε ITAM displayed a more evident mono-phosphorylation pattern under all three conditions ( Figures 2 A–2C). The membrane proximal tyrosine in CD3ε ITAM had a much higher phosphorylation level than the distal tyrosine, indicating that a significant subset of CD3ε was mono-phosphorylated at the proximal tyrosine. We further studied CD3ε phosphorylation under physiological antigen stimulation. Jurkat T cells were engineered to express tuberculosis (TB) antigen-specific TCR and stimulated by antigen-pulsed B cells ( Glanville et al., 2017 28. Glanville, J. ∙ Huang, H. ∙ Nau, A. ... Identifying specificity groups in the T cell receptor repertoire Nature. 2017; 547 :94-98 Crossref Scopus (632) PubMed Google Scholar ). The same mono-phosphorylation pattern of CD3ε ITAM was observed ( Figures 3 A–3E). We then compared the phosphorylation kinetics of the proximal tyrosine (Y1) and distal tyrosine (Y2) of CD3ε ITAM with an on-membrane phosphorylation assay. CD3ε Y1 (the Y2F mutant) showed faster phosphorylation kinetics than CD3ε Y2 (the Y1F mutant) ( Figures 3 F–3H). A previous report showed that CD3ε basic residue rich sequence (BRS) had ionic interaction with Lck regulatory domains, and CD3ε proline rich sequence (PRS) reinforced such an interaction ( Li et al., 2017 43. Li, L. ∙ Guo, X. ∙ Shi, X. ... Ionic CD3-Lck interaction regulates the initiation of T-cell receptor signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E5891-E5899 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutating BRS/PRS motifs clearly reduced phosphorylation levels of both CD3ε tyrosines and slowed down CD3ε Y1 phosphorylation to a rate similar to that of CD3ε Y2 ( Figures 3 F, 3I, and 3J). Thus, CD3ε BRS and PRS motifs appear to be essential for inducing the mono-phosphorylation pattern of CD3ε ITAM. Notably, the membrane proximal BRS/PRS motifs are present in CD3ε but absent in other CD3 chains. This might explain why CD3ε, but not other CD3 chains, displayed an evident mono-phosphorylation pattern.
It has been well documented that dual-phosphorylated CD3 ITAM interacts with Zap70 with high affinity ( Au-Yeung et al., 2018 3. Au-Yeung, B.B. ∙ Shah, N.H. ∙ Shen, L. ... ZAP-70 in Signaling, Biology, and Disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :127-156 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) whereas mono-phosphorylated CD3 ITAM loses binding with Zap70 ( Isakov et al., 1995 37. Isakov, N. ∙ Wange, R.L. ∙ Burgess, W.H. ... ZAP-70 binding specificity to T cell receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs: the tandem SH2 domains of ZAP-70 bind distinct tyrosine-based activation motifs with varying affinity J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181 :375-380 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, mono-phosphorylated ITAM can be inhibitory as shown in the case of mono-phosphorylated Fc receptor ITAM that recruits Shp1 phosphatase to dephosphorylate other signaling molecules ( Ben Mkaddem et al., 2019 4. Ben Mkaddem, S. ∙ Benhamou, M. ∙ Monteiro, R.C. Understanding Fc Receptor Involvement in Inflammatory Diseases: From Mechanisms to New Therapeutic Tools Front. Immunol. 2019; 10 :811 Crossref Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then asked which inhibitory molecule could be recruited by CD3ε-ITAM. Besides quantitation of ITAM phosphorylation, the MS measurements in Figure 2 also identified a panel of SH2-containing proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with TCR, including three inhibitory molecules Csk, Shp1, and Shp2 ( Figure 4 A; Figure S3 A). A membrane-reconstituted FRET experiment showed that CD3ε directly bound to Csk but not Shp1/2 upon ATP-triggered, Lck-catalyzed phosphorylation ( Figure 4 B). The estimated K d of CD3ε-Csk interaction was 1.6 μM, though the saturation point was not reached because of protein aggregation ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Furthermore, CD3ε with the proximal tyrosine mono-phosphorylated (designated as CD3ε pY1) pulled down a significantly higher amount of endogenous Csk from primary T cells than did non-phosphorylated CD3ε (designated as CD3ε-Y1Y2) ( Figure 4 E; Figure S3 B). Mutating PRS did not have a clear effect on the Csk pull-down efficiency by CD3ε pY1. Mutating BRS enhanced the pull-down efficiency, suggesting that BRS might inhibit CD3ε-Csk interaction.
We then studied the interaction between CD3ε and Csk-SH2 domain at atomic resolution by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy ( Figures 4 F–4J; Figures S3 C–S3G). CD3ε-Y1Y2 had little effect on Csk-SH2 amide resonance signals, whereas CD3ε-pY1 caused substantial changes ( Figure 4 G). We categorized the resonance signal changes to six patterns (I to VI) according to the changes of peak intensity and position of each Csk-SH2 residue ( Figures 4 H–4J). Categories I to VI represented low to high binding affinities. Non-phosphorylated CD3ε-Y1Y2 mainly caused changes within category I, indicating little to no binding with Csk. CD3ε-pY1 mainly caused changes within categories III–V. Mutating BRS or PRS did not affect CD3ε-pY1 binding with Csk-SH2 domain ( Figures S3 C–S3G). In comparison, phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (Pag), another Csk-interacting protein on the plasma membrane, mainly caused changes within category IV–VI ( Figures S3 H and S3I), suggesting a higher Csk affinity for Pag than that of CD3ε-pY1. However, Pag has much lower transcriptional levels than Csk in T cells ( Figure S3 J). Therefore, even if 100% of Pag is phosphorylated and recruits Csk, free Csk molecules would exist and are thus available to bind with CD3ε. According to the structure of the Csk-Pag complex ( Tanaka et al., 2013 63. Tanaka, H. ∙ Akagi, K. ∙ Oneyama, C. ... Identification of a new interaction mode between the Src homology 2 domain of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) and Csk-binding protein/phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :15240-15254 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), Csk-SH2 domain has two canonical pockets to bind with pY and an aliphatic residue at pY +3 position. CD3ε-pY1 titration caused evident changes of the key residues in these two pockets ( Figure 4 J), likely because of interactions with the phosphorylated proximal tyrosine and the isoleucine at the +3 position in CD3ε ITAM.
Csk is an inhibitory tyrosine kinase that is known to downregulate Lck activity through phosphorylating the inhibitory tyrosine Lck-Y505 ( Davidson et al., 2016 17.

Immunol. 2014; 15 :186-194 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). The molecular interaction between mono-phosphorylated CD3ε and Csk thus can serve as a negative feedback regulation to restrain TCR signaling.
CAR-T therapies are often associated with excessive cytokine release, which are typically not observed in TCR-mediated response. The existing CAR constructs only contain the activating CD3ζ chain to mediate antigen signaling. We hypothesized that incorporating the inhibitory CD3ε ITAM into CAR might decrease its cytokine toxicity. The clinically approved CD19.28Z CAR utilizes CD28 and CD3ζ cytoplasmic domains as signaling modules ( Kochenderfer et al., 2010 42. Kochenderfer, J.N. ∙ Wilson, W.H. ∙ Janik, J.E. ... Eradication of B-lineage cells and regression of lymphoma in a patient treated with autologous T cells genetically engineered to recognize CD19 Blood. 2010; 116 :4099-4102 Crossref Scopus (1106) PubMed Google Scholar ). We compared two design strategies: inserting the entire CD3ε cytoplasmic domain at the membrane proximal position (N-terminal to CD28, named CD19.E28Z; Figure 5 A) or at the membrane distal position (C-terminal to CD3ζ, named CD19.28ZE; Figure S4 A). Although CD19.28ZE had poor surface expression ( Figure S4 B), CD19.E28Z had comparable surface expression as CD19.28Z ( Figure 5 B). We thus chose the E28Z strategy.
The CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells had a similar CD4/CD8 ratio as the CD19.28Z CAR-T cells ( Figure 5 C). However, the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells produced significantly lower levels of cytokines upon antigen stimulation, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) ( Figures 5 D–5F). No constitutive cytokine release was observed with the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells ( Figures S4 C and S4D). We also noticed that the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells had a lower level of apoptosis and a higher proliferation rate than the CD19.28Z CAR-T cells after antigen stimulation, leading to a higher cell number of the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells ( Figures 5 G–5I). No obvious exhaustion feature was observed with the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells ( Figures 5 J and 5K). Moreover, cytotoxicity was not affected by CD3ε insertion ( Figure 5 L). Replacing CD3ε sequence by a flexible linker of similar size abolished the proliferation advantage brought by CD3ε insertion ( Figures S4 B, S4E, and S4F), supporting the notion that it was the CD3ε signaling motifs rather than a distancing effect that caused the phenotypic differences between CD19.E28Z CAR and CD19.28Z CAR. We next tested the in vivo antitumor function of CAR-T cells carrying the CD3ε module in a mouse-xenograft model of B cell lymphoma. The CD19.E28Z CAR T cells showed better antitumor function than the CD19.28Z CAR T cells in suppressing tumor growth and prolonging survival time ( Figures 5 M and 5N).
We also tested whether the modulatory functions of CD3ε could be applied to other CARs. Mesothelin is a tumor antigen associated with multiple solid tumors such as mesothelioma and pancreatic and ovarian cancers ( Morello et al., 2016 49. Morello, A. ∙ Sadelain, M. ∙ Adusumilli, P.S. Mesothelin-Targeted CARs: Driving T Cells to Solid Tumors Cancer Discov. 2016; 6 :133-146 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mesothelin CAR-T cell therapy shows promising antitumor activity in patients with malignant pleural disease from mesothelioma. Incorporation of CD3ε into the mesothelin.28Z CAR did not alter the surface expression level of CAR or the CD4/CD8 ratio ( Figures S5 A–S5C). The mesothelin.E28Z CAR-T cells had reduced cytokine production, enhanced persistence, and augmented in vivo antitumor function, similar to the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells ( Figures S5 D–S5J).
We next studied the signaling basis of impaired cytokine production of the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells. CD19.E28Z CAR had a brief increase in CD3ζ phosphorylation level upon CD19 stimulation followed by a rapid decay to nearly no phosphorylation level at 90 min ( Figure 6 A). In contrast, CD19.28Z CAR had a more sustained antigen-induced CD3ζ phosphorylation ( Figure 6 A). Consistent with reduced CD3ζ phosphorylation, CD19.E28Z CAR had reduced Zap70 and Plcγ1 phosphorylation ( Figure 6 A). CD19.E28Z CAR and CD19.28Z CAR displayed a similar kinetics of antigen-induced downregulation of surface level within 2 h ( Figure 6 B). This could not explain the faster decay of CD19.E28Z phosphorylation level. Echoing the above-mentioned biochemical and biophysical observations of CD3ε-Csk interaction ( Figure 4 ), a colocalization imaging experiment and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment both showed that CD19.E28Z CAR had higher level of Csk recruitment than CD19.28Z CAR, and this effect was at least partially dependent on CD3ε ITAM ( Figures 6 C–6G; Videos S1 and S2 ). Given the inhibitory function of Csk in T cell proximal signaling, higher level of Csk recruitment by CD19.E28Z CAR could lead to impaired signaling of the CD3ζ/Zap70/Plcγ1 axis and the subsequent cytokine reduction ( Au-Yeung et al., 2018 3. Au-Yeung, B.B. ∙ Shah, N.H. ∙ Shen, L. ... ZAP-70 in Signaling, Biology, and Disease Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36 :127-156 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ).

CD3ε has other functional motifs in addition to ITAM, i.e., a membrane-proximal BRS and a PRS preceding the ITAM. We thus generated specific mutants of ITAM, BRS, and PRS to study their roles in cytokine regulation ( Figure S6 A). ITAM or PRS mutation did not affect CAR surface expression whereas BRS mutation, either alone or in combination with PRS mutation, reduced the surface expression of CAR ( Figure 6 H; Figure S6 B), in agreement with the role of BRS in regulating TCR surface level ( Deford-Watts et al., 2009 19. Deford-Watts, L.M. ∙ Tassin, T.C. ∙ Becker, A.M. ... The cytoplasmic tail of the T cell receptor CD3 epsilon subunit contains a phospholipid-binding motif that regulates T cell functions J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :1055-1064 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD4/CD8 ratio for each mutant was not altered significantly ( Figure 6 I; Figure S6 C). The ITAM mutation largely rescued cytokine reduction induced by CD3ε insertion, whereas the BRS mutation, PRS mutation, or BRS/PRS double mutation caused even lower cytokine production ( Figures 6 J–6L; Figures S6 D–S6F). Thus, Csk-recruiting ITAM is the major motif of CD3ε responsible for the downregulation of cytokine production in the CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells. Neither ITAM mutation nor BRS/PRS mutation affected cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells ( Figure S6 G), consistent with the negligible role of CD3ε incorporation in cytotoxicity ( Figure 5 L). On the other hand, the ITAM mutation did not abolish but rather reinforced the proliferation advantage of CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells, suggesting that other motif of CD3ε is responsible for upregulating persistence ( Figures 6 M–6O).
It is documented that AKT plays a central role in regulating CAR-T persistence and antitumor function ( Guedan et al., 2020 30. Guedan, S. ∙ Madar, A. ∙ Casado-Medrano, V. ... Single residue in CD28-costimulated CAR-T cells limits long-term persistence and antitumor durability J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :3087-3097 Crossref Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun et al., 2010 59. Sun, J. ∙ Dotti, G. ∙ Huye, L.E. ... T cells expressing constitutively active Akt resist multiple tumor-associated inhibitory mechanisms Mol. Ther. 2010; 18 :2006-2017 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhong et al., 2010 69. Zhong, X.S. ∙ Matsushita, M. ∙ Plotkin, J. ...

Ther. 2010; 18 :413-420 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells had higher activation levels of AKT ( Figure 7 A) and its downstream mTORC1 (shown by S6 phosphorylation, Figure 7 B). PI3K is an upstream regulator of AKT, and CD28 can recruit p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, through the interaction between the phosphorylated YxxM motif of CD28 and the SH2 domain of p85. CD3ε was also reported to recruit p85 ( de Aós et al., 1997 18. de Aós, I. ∙ Metzger, M.H. ∙ Exley, M. ... Tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD3-epsilon subunit of the T cell antigen receptor mediates enhanced association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in Jurkat T cells J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 :25310-25318 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). We indeed observed that CD3ε incorporation led to more recruitment of p85 to CD19.E28Z CAR upon antigen stimulation, in a fashion independent of CD3ε ITAM ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Through analysis of p85 structure, we noticed that its N-terminal SH3 domain is highly enriched with acidic residues ( Figures S7 A and S7B). We speculated that the negatively charged p85 SH3 domain might electrostatically interact with the positively charged CD3ε BRS motif to enhance PI3K/AKT signaling induced by CAR activation. Consistent with this notion, NMR experiments showed that the p85 SH3 domain interacted with CD3ε, as evidenced by disturbances of p85-SH3 signals caused by CD3ε titration ( Figures S7 C–S7G). Unlike the interaction between CD3ε and Csk SH2 domain that was dependent on ITAM phosphorylation ( Figures S3 C–S3G), the interaction between CD3ε and p85 SH3 domain was dependent on BRS instead of ITAM phosphorylation. The PRS mutation also affected CD3ε binding with p85-SH3, though to a slightly lesser degree than the BRS mutation.
To explicitly study the role of BRS in CAR signaling, we generated a CAR construct with only the CD3ε BRS motif inserted before the 28Z sequence ( Figure S6 A). Comparable surface level and CD4/CD8 ratio were observed for CD19.E BRS 28Z and CD19.28Z CARs ( Figures 7 E and 7F). The CD19.E BRS 28Z CAR-T cells had enhanced persistence while there was similar cytokine production when compared with the CD19.28Z CAR-T cells, suggesting that CD3ε BRS mainly regulated persistence but not cytokine production ( Figures 7 G–7L). As expected, CD19.E BRS 28Z CAR-T cells had comparable AKT signaling as CD19.E28Z CAR-T cells ( Figure 7 M), echoing the role of BRS in p85 interaction ( Figures S7 C–S7G).

Section: Discussion

To precisely map out the dynamics of all tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR rather than relative fold changes, an absolute quantification method was developed in this study. There are several proteomics methods for obtaining absolute quantification information. The most common ones are AQUA and MARQUIS ( Curran et al., 2015 15. Curran, T.G. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Ma, D.J. ... MARQUIS: a multiplex method for absolute quantification of peptides and posttranslational modifications Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :5924 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gerber et al., 2003 26. Gerber, S.A. ∙ Rush, J. ∙ Stemman, O. ... Absolute quantification of proteins and phosphoproteins from cell lysates by tandem MS Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :6940-6945 Crossref Scopus (1579) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kirkpatrick et al., 2005 40. Kirkpatrick, D.S. ∙ Gerber, S.A. ∙ Gygi, S.P. The absolute quantification strategy: a general procedure for the quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications Methods. 2005; 35 :265-273 Crossref Scopus (494) PubMed Google Scholar ). AQUA is originally derived from the isotope dilution approach in quantitative study of small molecules. A heavy-labeled synthetic peptide with a known amount is spiked into sample at the beginning of sample preparation procedure. The elution profiles of the corresponding endogenous and added standard peptides are used to calculate the quantification information. The major drawback is that its single point calibration might lack accuracy. MARQUIS is an improved method that incorporates the isobaric chemical labeling to create a multiple-point calibration curve for each target peptide. These two popular methods both make use of heavy isotope labeling for differentiation of endogenous and standard peptides. Inspired by AQUA and MARQUIS, we developed an alternative method that bypasses the costly synthetic peptides with isotope labeling. We took advantage of targeted immunoprecipitation, isobaric chemical labeling, DDA, and PRM to perform an absolute quantitation of phosphorylation of all CD3 ITAMs at different time points in a single measurement, using multiple-point calibration curves ( Figure 1 ). The advantage of using non-heavy-labeled standard peptides, besides its cost-effectiveness, is to reduce the complexity of MS spectrum and errors during data acquisition, thus increasing the quantitation accuracy. Using this TIMLAQ-MS method, we were able to unravel phosphorylation patterns of CD3 ITAMs under different stimulation conditions.
We observed constitutive phosphorylation for all CD3 chains, consistent with earlier studies ( Goodfellow et al., 2015 29. Goodfellow, H.S. ∙ Frushicheva, M.P. ∙ Ji, Q. ... The catalytic activity of the kinase ZAP-70 mediates basal signaling and negative feedback of the T cell receptor pathway Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 :ra49 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nakayama et al., 1989 50. Nakayama, T. ∙ Singer, A. ∙ Hsi, E.D. ... Intrathymic signalling in immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the T-cell receptor zeta chain Nature. 1989; 341 :651-654 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Oers et al., 1994 64. van Oers, N.S. ∙ Killeen, N. ∙ Weiss, A. ZAP-70 is constitutively associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR zeta in murine thymocytes and lymph node T cells Immunity. 1994; 1 :675-685 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ). Among the four CD3 proteins, CD3ε was reported to be the most favorable substrate of Lck ( Li et al., 2017 43. Li, L. ∙ Guo, X. ∙ Shi, X. ... Ionic CD3-Lck interaction regulates the initiation of T-cell receptor signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E5891-E5899 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD3ε indeed had the highest phosphorylation level in the reconstituted TCR/Lck system containing physiological levels of CD3 ( Figure 2 A). In the T cell/pervanadate and T cell/α-CD3 systems, we used anti-CD3ε (OKT3) to immunoprecipitate the TCR-CD3 complex, and OKT3 in principle could also pull down intracellular CD3ε molecules that are not part of the TCR complex. It is likely that these free CD3ε molecules could not be phosphorylated upon TCR activation because of the lack of Lck in the vicinity, thereby decreasing the observed extent of CD3ε phosphorylation in T cell samples. CD3ε BRS and PRS were shown to interact with the unique and SH3 domains of Lck to facilitate TCR phosphorylation ( Li et al., 2017 43. Li, L. ∙ Guo, X. ∙ Shi, X. ... Ionic CD3-Lck interaction regulates the initiation of T-cell receptor signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E5891-E5899 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutating CD3ε BRS/PRS significantly impaired CD3ε ITAM phosphorylation and abrogated the Lck selectivity on the proximal tyrosine ( Figures 3 F–3J). Therefore, the BRS/PRS motifs at the N-terminal position of ITAM might account for the more evident mono-phosphorylation pattern of CD3ε than other CD3 chains.
The phosphorylation patterns of the three CD3ζ ITAMs have been studied in different types of T cells using various technologies. These studies detected two forms of CD3ζ, a hypophosphorylated form that runs at 21 kD (p21) and a hyperphosphorylated form that runs at 23 kD (p23) ( Kersh et al., 1998 39. Kersh, E.N. ∙ Shaw, A.S. ∙ Allen, P.M. Fidelity of T cell activation through multistep T cell receptor ζ phosphorylation Science. 1998; 281 :572-575 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Oers et al., 2000 65. van Oers, N.S. ∙ Tohlen, B. ∙ Malissen, B. ... The 21- and 23-kD forms of TCR zeta are generated by specific ITAM phosphorylations Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1 :322-328 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the exact phosphorylation patterns for these two forms are debated and appeared to be context dependent. For example, the p21 form in activated 3.L2 T cells has ITAM1 phosphorylation ( Kersh et al., 1998 39. Kersh, E.N. ∙ Shaw, A.S. ∙ Allen, P.M. Fidelity of T cell activation through multistep T cell receptor ζ phosphorylation Science. 1998; 281 :572-575 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the p21 form in unstimulated mouse thymocytes has little to no ITAM1 phosphorylation ( van Oers et al., 2000 65. van Oers, N.S. ∙ Tohlen, B. ∙ Malissen, B. ... The 21- and 23-kD forms of TCR zeta are generated by specific ITAM phosphorylations Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1 :322-328 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, the number of phosphorylated tyrosines in the p23 form varies from four to six ( Kersh et al., 1998 39. Kersh, E.N. ∙ Shaw, A.S. ∙ Allen, P.M. Fidelity of T cell activation through multistep T cell receptor ζ phosphorylation Science. 1998; 281 :572-575 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our mass spectrometric and biochemical experiments showed stronger phosphorylation of ITAM1 than ITAM2 and ITAM3 upon stimulation of Jurkat T cells by α-CD3, owing to the higher CD45 resistance of ITAM1. We also noticed that CD3ζ phosphorylation patterns were different between the T cell/pervanadate sample and the reconstituted TCR/Lck sample. The difference might be due to binding of Zap70 to phosphorylated CD3ζ, which was reported to affect CD3 phosphorylation in T cells ( van Oers et al., 2000 65. van Oers, N.S. ∙ Tohlen, B. ∙ Malissen, B. ... The 21- and 23-kD forms of TCR zeta are generated by specific ITAM phosphorylations Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1 :322-328 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another potential reason is that the reconstituted TCR system did not have the same 3D structure as the physiological TCR in T cells. Further studies are warranted to fully understand the complicated functions of CD3ζ.
Using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and cellular experiments, we showed that mono-phosphorylated CD3ε recruited Csk with a micromolar affinity. The membrane recruitment might enable Csk to exert its inhibitory function on Lck, as reported ( Davidson et al., 2016 17. Davidson, D. ∙ Zhong, M.C. ∙ Pandolfi, P.P. ...

Manz, B.N. ∙ Tan, Y.X. ∙ Courtney, A.H. ... Small molecule inhibition of Csk alters affinity recognition by T cells eLife. 2015; 4 :e08088 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ; Schmedt et al., 1998 55. Schmedt, C. ∙ Saijo, K. ∙ Niidome, T. ... Csk controls antigen receptor-mediated development and selection of T-lineage cells Nature. 1998; 394 :901-904 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tan et al., 2014 62. Tan, Y.X. ∙ Manz, B.N. ∙ Freedman, T.S. ... Inhibition of the kinase Csk in thymocytes reveals a requirement for actin remodeling in the initiation of full TCR signaling Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :186-194 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pag was previously shown to recruit Csk to the plasma membrane upon the phosphorylation of its Y317 site (Y314 in mouse). Opposing results have been reported about whether mouse Pag loses or gains Y314 phosphorylation after antigen stimulation ( Davidson et al., 2003 16. Davidson, D. ∙ Bakinowski, M. ∙ Thomas, M.L. ... Phosphorylation-dependent regulation of T-cell activation by PAG/Cbp, a lipid raft-associated transmembrane adaptor Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23 :2017-2028 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ; Reginald et al., 2015 53. Reginald, K. ∙ Chaoui, K. ∙ Roncagalli, R. ... Revisiting the Timing of Action of the PAG Adaptor Using Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Primary T Cells J. Immunol. 2015; 195 :5472-5481 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is still unclear if Pag serves as a predominant Csk regulator in activated T cells. In various types of T cells, Pag transcriptional levels are generally lower than those of Csk ( Figure S3 J). Csk knockout mice displayed evident abnormality of T cell development ( Schmedt et al., 1998 55. Schmedt, C. ∙ Saijo, K. ∙ Niidome, T. ... Csk controls antigen receptor-mediated development and selection of T-lineage cells Nature. 1998; 394 :901-904 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas Pag knockout mice had normal T cell development, TCR proximal signaling, and effector function ( Dobenecker et al., 2005 21. Dobenecker, M.W. ∙ Schmedt, C. ∙ Okada, M. ... The ubiquitously expressed Csk adaptor protein Cbp is dispensable for embryogenesis and T-cell development and function Mol. Cell.

Cbp deficiency alters Csk localization in lipid rafts but does not affect T-cell development Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25 :8486-8495 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). A recent paper shows that Pag primarily functions in previously activated T cells but not in freshly isolated T cells ( Davidson et al., 2016 17. Davidson, D. ∙ Zhong, M.C. ∙ Pandolfi, P.P. ... The Csk-Associated Adaptor PAG Inhibits Effector T Cell Activation in Cooperation with Phosphatase PTPN22 and Dok Adaptors Cell Rep. 2016; 17 :2776-2788 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that Csk membrane recruitment and function are co-regulated by CD3ε and Pag in T cells.
When incorporated into the CD19.28Z CAR construct, CD3ε recruited Csk to the CAR signalosome, attenuating Zap70/PLCγ1 signaling and cytokine production ( Figure 6 ), and this effect was abrogated by mutating the ITAM of CD3ε. Thus, the inhibitory nature of CD3ε ITAM can be applied in CAR-T therapy to reduce cytokine toxicity.
In addition to the inhibitory ITAM, CD3ε also contains BRS and PRS motifs. Truncation of CD3ε cytoplasmic domain, but not that of CD3δ and CD3γ, led to the blockade of early thymocyte maturation at DN3 stage ( Brodeur et al., 2009 8. Brodeur, J.F. ∙ Li, S. ∙ da Silva Martins, M. ... Critical and multiple roles for the CD3epsilon intracytoplasmic tail in double negative to double positive thymocyte differentiation J. Immunol. 2009; 182 :4844-4853 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ), reflecting a special role of CD3ε in TCR signaling. Moreover, the BRS motif in the CD3ε cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for the double-negative (DN) to double-positive (DP) differentiation ( Brodeur et al., 2009 8. Brodeur, J.F. ∙ Li, S. ∙ da Silva Martins, M. ... Critical and multiple roles for the CD3epsilon intracytoplasmic tail in double negative to double positive thymocyte differentiation J. Immunol. 2009; 182 :4844-4853 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). The importance of CD3ε BRS in T cell development is further confirmed by an independent study showing that BRS mutation led to impaired transition of DN3 to DN4 stage ( Bettini et al., 2014 5. Bettini, M.L. ∙ Guy, C. ∙ Dash, P. ... Membrane association of the CD3ε signaling domain is required for optimal T cell development and function J. Immunol. 2014; 193 :258-267 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutating CD3ε PRS by different genetic approaches yielded inconsistent conclusions but suggested that PRS promotes TCR signaling in thymocytes ( Borroto et al., 2014 7. Borroto, A. ∙ Arellano, I. ∙ Blanco, R. ... Relevance of Nck-CD3 epsilon interaction for T cell activation in vivo J.

The CD3epsilon proline-rich sequence, and its interaction with Nck, is not required for T cell development and function J. Immunol. 2005; 175 :270-275 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). At a molecular level, CD3ε BRS recruits Lck, the major TCR-phosphorylating kinase ( Li et al., 2017 43. Li, L. ∙ Guo, X. ∙ Shi, X. ... Ionic CD3-Lck interaction regulates the initiation of T-cell receptor signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E5891-E5899 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CD3ε PRS recruits Nck, a cytoskeleton-regulating adaptor protein ( Gil et al., 2002 27. Gil, D. ∙ Schamel, W.W. ∙ Montoya, M. ... Recruitment of Nck by CD3 epsilon reveals a ligand-induced conformational change essential for T cell receptor signaling and synapse formation Cell. 2002; 109 :901-912 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall, previous studies support the notion that the BRS and PRS of CD3ε promote TCR signaling.
In the present work, we showed that integrating CD3ε cytoplasmic domain into 28Z CAR not only reduced cytokine production but also improved persistence ( Figures 5 G–5I). At a molecular level, we found that CD3ε incorporation increased recruitment of p85 to CAR upon antigen stimulation ( Figure 7 ). Consistent with this, E28Z CAR-T cells had stronger AKT signaling, which could in turn promote CAR-T persistence ( Guedan et al., 2020 30. Guedan, S. ∙ Madar, A. ∙ Casado-Medrano, V. ...

We further showed that BRS played a key role in mediating interaction between CD3ε and p85-SH3 domain ( Figure S7 ). Incorporation of the 8aa BRS motif into 28Z CAR also promoted AKT signaling and CAR-T persistence with no effect on cytokine production ( Figures 7 G–7M).
We also noticed that CD3ε incorporation enhanced basal phosphorylation level of the CD3ζ module ( Figure 6 A), which might be explained by the Lck recruitment function of CD3ε BRS. It is still unclear how CD3ε BRS coordinates interactions with Lck and p85. One possibility is that CD3ε BRS recruits Lck to mediate tonic CAR signaling in unstimulated cells whereas it facilitates p85 recruitment in stimulated cells by providing a docking site for the p85-SH3 domain. This interaction likely synergizes with the interaction between CD28 and the p85-SH2 domain. Because tonic CAR signaling is reported to play unfavorable roles in antitumor function of CAR-T cells ( Frigault et al., 2015 25. Frigault, M.J. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Basil, M.C. ... Identification of chimeric antigen receptors that mediate constitutive or inducible proliferation of T cells Cancer Immunol. Res. 2015; 3 :356-367 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ; Long et al., 2015 45. Long, A.H. ∙ Haso, W.M. ∙ Shern, J.F. ... 4-1BB costimulation ameliorates T cell exhaustion induced by tonic signaling of chimeric antigen receptors Nat. Med. 2015; 21 :581-590 Crossref Scopus (1239) PubMed Google Scholar ), further optimization of the E28Z CAR construct is required to minimize tonic signaling while preserving the antigen-dependent recruitment of Csk and PI3K.
In summary, we show that TCR is a self-restrained signaling machinery that contains both activating and inhibitory signaling modules embedded in diverse CD3 signaling subunits. Increasing CD3 diversity of CAR, i.e., incorporation of CD3ε cytoplasmic domain, yielded a CAR with improved signaling profile and tumor control ( Figure 7 N).

Jurkat (RRID: CVCL_0367) (male), Raji (RRID: CVCL_0511) (male), K562 (RRID: CVCL_0004) (female), and PANC-1 (RRID: CVCL_0480) (male) cell lines were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (100 μg mL −1 streptomycin and 100 units mL −1 penicillin, GIBCO), HEK293-FT cells (primary embryonal human kidney) were cultured with complete DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .
Six- to eight-week-old female mice were used. NOD- Prkdc scid IL2rg tm1 /Bcgen (B-NDG) mice, equivalent to the NSG mice, were housed under SPF conditions at the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology. Animals were randomly allocated to experimental groups. All mice experiments were conducted under an approved IACUC protocol of SIBCB, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
To detect TCR phosphorylation level under different stimulation conditions, Jurkat cells (1x10 8 cells/mL) were stimulated at 37°C by TCR crosslinking (10 μg/mL α-hCD3 (clone OKT3)) or phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate (10 μM) for the indicated time in RPMI 1640 medium. OKT3 was used at non-saturating concentration for the purpose of reducing background noise. Stimulation was terminated by adding ice-cold 2x lysis/IP buffer (1% digitonin, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 40 mM NaF and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)). Cell lysis was performed at 4°C for 1 h. Total cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. OKT3 (5 μg per mL lysate) was added for the pervanadate sample. Protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μL per mL lysate) was added into both the pervandate and α-hCD3 samples and the cell lysates were rotated for 12 h at 4°C. After immunoprecipitation, Protein G-Sepharose beads were washed one time with the lysis/IP buffer, and then eluted with the glycine buffer (0.2 M Glycine/ 0.5% NP40, pH2.2) at 37°C for 15 min. The elution was repeated three times. Proteins in the eluate were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein pellet was washed 3 times with cold acetone and dried in a rotary vacuum dryer (Labconco).
Unstimulated Jurkat cells (1x10 8 cells/mL) were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium and lysed with ice-cold 2x lysis/IP buffer. Cell lysis was performed at 4°C for 1 h. Total cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials, and then incubated with an IgG antibody (5 μg per mL lysate) and Protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μL per mL lysate) for 12 h at 4°C. Protein elution and precipitation protocol was the same as above. Synthetic phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated CD3 peptides of 6 different concentrations (see Table S1 ) were mixed with background proteins immunoprecipitated by the IgG control antibody to generate six standard samples. From cell lysis to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, standard samples were handled simultaneously with analyte samples.
Each analyte or standard sample was solubilized in 60 μL 100 mM TEAB buffer. To reduce disulfide bond, 5 μL 200 mM TCEP was added and samples were incubated at 55°C for 1 h. 5 μL 375 mM iodoacetamide was then added to alkylate reduced cysteines. The alkylation reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min, followed by acetone precipitation for overnight. Samples were then centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min at 4°C to collect the pellet.
The pellets were resuspended with 60 μL 100 mM TEAB and digested with trypsin (from the TMT10plex Isobaric Mass Tag Labeling Kit, trypsin : total protein = 1 : 15) per sample at 37°C for 16 h. Then each sample was labeled with 20.5 μL TMT10plex Label Reagent. Reactions proceeded at room temperature for 1 h and then were quenched by the addition of 8 μL 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, ten samples were combined in another microcentrifuge tube at equal amounts and dried in a rotary vacuum dryer.
The phosphopeptide enrichment process was similar to previous work ( Cantin et al., 2007 10. Cantin, G.T. ∙ Shock, T.R. ∙ Park, S.K. ... Optimizing TiO2-based phosphopeptide enrichment for automated multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2007; 79 :4666-4673 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Kasil frits were prepared in 250-μm-i.d. undeactivated, fused-silica capillary. A TiO 2 column was made by packing Titansphere into the capillary to column length of 8 cm. To equilibrate the column, it was washed with 300 μL Buffer A (20% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid). Then the combined TMT labeled sample (dissolved in 300 μL Buffer A) was loaded onto the column in pressure bomb and the flowthrough was collected. Then the column was washed with 300 μL Buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid) and the washed fraction was also collected. The above flowthrough was repeatedly loaded onto the column for three times to ensure complete binding. The phosphopeptides were eluted with 300 μL 250 mM NH 4 HCO 3 (alkalified with NH 4 OH to pH9.0). Eluate was acidified with 2.5% formic acid (final concentration) and all flowthrough fractions were combined. Both eluate and flowthrough samples were dried in rotary vacuum dryer and dissolve in 0.1% formic acid. The flowthrough and washed fraction were used for quantifying non-phosphorylated CD3 peptides and the eluate was used for quantifying the phosphorylated ones.
Samples were oxidized by 0.5% H 2 O 2 at room temperature for 30 min, dried in rotary vacuum dryer and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid.
Large unilamellar vesicles with 100 nm diameter were prepared as previously described ( Xu et al., 2008 67. Xu, C. ∙ Gagnon, E. ∙ Call, M.E. ... Regulation of T cell receptor activation by dynamic membrane binding of the CD3epsilon cytoplasmic tyrosine-based motif Cell. 2008; 135 :702-713 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). POPC (90%) and DGS-NTA-Ni (10%) were used for LUV preparation. His-tagged CD3γ CD /CD3δ CD /CD3ε CD /CD3ζ CD peptides (pre-mixed according to the physiological CD3 stoichiometry within the TCR complex (1:1:2:2)), and His-tagged Lck (Millipore) were incubated with LUVs for 1 h at room temperature for membrane coating. ATP was then added to initiate the reaction. The reaction volume was 100 μL, and the final concentrations of ingredients were: 0.5 μM His-CD3γ CD and His-CD3δ CD , 1 μM His-CD3ε CD and His-CD3ζ CD , 7.1 nM His-tagged Lck, 1 mM phospholipids, 65 mM HEPES (pH7.0), 5 mM MgCl 2 , 3 μM Na 3 VO 4 , 1.25 mM DTT, 150 mM KCl, 0.2 mM ATP. The TCR phosphorylation reactions were proceeded at 37°C for 0, 15, 60 and 120 min and terminated with 33 μL trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins. The pellets were then washed 3 times with cold acetone, and dried by rotary vacuum dryer.
Standard CD3 peptides of 6 different concentrations were mixed according to Table S1 .
Since there is no cysteine in synthetic CD3γ CD /CD3δ CD /CD3ε CD /CD3ζ CD peptides, disulfide bond reduction and cysteine alkylation were not performed. The samples were trypsin digested and TMT10plex labeled as described above. The TiO 2 -based phosphopeptide enrichment was not needed because of low amount of background proteins. The samples were treated with H 2 O 2 to oxidize methionine as described above.
Peptides were separated with an UltiMate 3000 RSLC nano LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and emitted into a Q-Exactive Plus tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were loaded on a trap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 75 μm × 2 cm, particle size 3 μm, pore size 100 Å, C18) with a flow rate of 2.5 μL/min of 0.1% formic acid for 60 min. Then the trap column was connected to an analytical C18 column (Waters, 75 μm × 100 mm, particle size 1.8 μm, pore size 100 Å). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in 1% acetonitrile, while solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. The peptides were separated with a flow rate of 300 nL/min using a solvent gradient of 1% to 30% B for 495 min, followed by a 60 min washing gradient.
For DDA method, each full-scan mass spectrum was recorded in positive ion mode over a scan range of 300 to 1800 m/z, maximum injection time of 50 ms, AGC target of 3e6, and an isolation window of 2 m/z at the resolution of 70,000 at 200 m/z. The m/z values initiating the MS/MS scan were set on the dynamic exclusion list for 30 s and the top 20 most intense ions (charge state +2, +3, +4) were selected for HCD fragmentation (30% normalized collision energy) and MS/MS scans. The MS/MS acquisition was set at the maximum injection time of 500 ms, AGC target of 5e5 and an isolation window of 2 m/z at the resolution of 35,000 at 200 m/z.
For PRM method, the LC-MS/MS instruments and chromatographic setups were identical to DDA method. The PRM scan mode was set at the maximum injection time of 500 ms, AGC target of 5e5 and an isolation window of 2 m/z at the resolution of 35,000 at 200 m/z. Then 30% normalized collision energy was set for HCD fragmentation. Targeted CD3 precursor transitions and their corresponding retention times were extracted from the previous DDA discovery run and put into the PRM method as an inclusion list ( Table S2 ).
Database searches were performed with the Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Sequest HT search engine. Raw data were searched against the Swissprot database using human taxonomy with 20407 entries. The following search parameters were used: five missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin, carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57.021 Da) and TMT6plex modification of peptide N-terminal and lysine (+229.163 Da) were set as fixed modification, and the oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da), the oxidation plus TMT6plex modification of methionine (+245.158 Da), the phosphorylation of tyrosine (+79.966 Da) were considered as variable modification. Precursor mass tolerance was set to ± 10 ppm and fragment mass tolerance was set to ± 0.05 Da. Target FDR was set to 1% as the filter cut-off for the high-confidence peptides and proteins.
DDA and PRM data processing was performed within Skyline (v3.6). For absolute quantitation, peak area of each TMT reporter ion was exported. Standard curves were constructed by plotting peak areas of standard peptide against concentrations. Then the peak area of each pY and Y site was plugged into its corresponding standard curve to get the absolute value.

Raw MS files were processed with MaxQuant software (v.1.6.2.10) for database search with the Andromeda search engine and quantitative analysis. Data were searched against Swissprot database using human taxonomy with 20407 entries. The following search parameters were used: two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin, carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57.021 Da) and TMT6plex modification of peptide N-terminal and lysine (+229.163 Da) were set as fixed modification, and the oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da) and the acetyl of protein N-terminal were considered as variable modification. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the first search and 4.5 ppm for the main Andromeda database search. The fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.05 Da. “Reporter ion MS2” was chosen for quantifying TMT labeling samples. Minimum peptide length was set to seven amino acids and target FDR was set to 1% as the filter cut-off for the identified peptides. Protein quantification was based on unique and razor peptides.
Splenocytes from OT-1 TCR transgenic mice were stimulated with 10 nM OVA peptide and cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, antibiotics, 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and IL-2 (10 ng/mL). After 48 h, cells were washed to remove OVA and cultured for another 72 h in the presence of IL-2 (10 ng/mL) before CD3ε pull down.
OT1 CTL were resuspended in 1640 medium. 2x ice-cold lysis/IP buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 40 mM NaF and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)) was added to lyse the cells. Cell lysis was performed at 4°C for 1 h. Total cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. 100 μg biotinylated CD3ε Y1Y2, CD3ε pY1, CD3ε pY1 BRS-mut or CD3ε pY1 PRS-mut and streptavidin magnetic beads (60 μL per sample) were added to the CTL lysate (1.5 x 10 8 cell per sample) and incubated for 12 h at 4°C. After immunoprecipitation, streptavidin magnetic beads were washed three times with buffer containing half 1640 medium and half wash buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 40 mM NaF), and then eluted with the glycine buffer (0.2 M Glycine/ 0.5% NP40, pH2.2) at 37°C for 10 min. Proteins in the eluate were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein pellet was washed 3 times with cold acetone and dried in a rotary vacuum dryer (Labconco).
Samples were analyzed on a hybrid trapped-ion-mobility-spectrometry-Time-of-Flight (timsTOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany). Reversed-phase chromatography with nanoflow was performed on a nanoElute LC system (Bruker, Germany). Peptides were separated within 120 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min on a 25 cm x 75 μm column with a laser-pulled electrospray emitter packed with 1.9 μm ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ particles. Mobile phases A and B were water and ACN with 0.1% formic acid. Gradient of buffer B was increased from 2 to 22% within 90 min, followed by an increase to 37% within 10 min and a further increase to 95% within another 10 min. This percentage of buffer B will last for 10 more min to the process end. The dual TIMS analyzer was operated at a fixed duty cycle close to 100% using equal accumulation and ramp times of 100 ms each and recorded mass spectra in the range from m/z 100 – 1700. The experiments were performed in PASEF mode with 10 PASEF scans per topN acquisition cycle. The precursors that reached a ‘target value’ of 20,000 a.u. were dynamically excluded for 0.4 min. The quadrupole isolation width was set to 2 Th for m/z < 700 and 3 Th for m/z > 700.
Raw MS files acquired in DDA mode were searched by PEAKS software (version Online X). The digestion enzyme was set at “trypsin KR-C” and up to 2 missed cleavages. The precursor tolerance was limited to 20 ppm and the fragment tolerance was set as 0.05 Da. MS/MS spectra were searched against the Swissprot mouse database with 17,038 entries. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine residues and oxidation of methionine residues were defined as a fixed modification and a variable modifications, respectively. 1% FDR was applied at peptide-spectrum match (PSM) level. Label free Protein relative quantification (LFQ) is performed based on the extracted ion chromatograms of the whole isotopic envelope on MS1 level. Four-dimensional (m/z, retention time, ion-mobility, intensity) features of PASEF data were aligned between different mass runs.
Designs of different CAR constructs were displayed in Figures 5 A, S4 A, S5 A, and S6 A. pHAGE lentiviral vector was used for CAR expression. An eGFP-T2A cassette was included to monitor CAR expression level. The DNA sequences of FMC63 scFv, SS1 scFv, human CD28, CD3ε, and CD3ζ domains were from GenBank or previous studies ( Carpenito et al., 2009 11. Carpenito, C. ∙ Milone, M.C. ∙ Hassan, R. ... Control of large, established tumor xenografts with genetically retargeted human T cells containing CD28 and CD137 domains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :3360-3365 Crossref Scopus (710) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kochenderfer et al., 2010 42. Kochenderfer, J.N. ∙ Wilson, W.H. ∙ Janik, J.E. ... Eradication of B-lineage cells and regression of lymphoma in a patient treated with autologous T cells genetically engineered to recognize CD19 Blood. 2010; 116 :4099-4102 Crossref Scopus (1106) PubMed Google Scholar ). In CD19 CAR constructs, FMC63 scFv was used for antigen recognition. In mesothelin CAR constructs, SS1 svFv was used for antigen recognition.
Human PBMCs were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation with the Lymphoprep reagent (StemCell Technologies #07801). PBMCs were resuspended at 1 × 10 6 cells/mL in complete OpTmizer T Cell Expansion SFM medium, supplemented with 5% Human AB serum, 10 mM neutralized NAC (Sigma-Aldrich #A9165), 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2mM L-glutamine, and 10 ng/mL IL-7/IL-15. PBMCs were stimulated with the Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Technologies #11132D) for 24 h at a 1:1 bead:cell ratio. Then PBMCs were transduced with lentivirus for 24 h. At day4 after T cells stimulation, the Dynabeads were removed and CAR + T cells were sorted with BD FACSAria III or BD FACSAria SORP for subsequent assays. After sorting and culture, the percentage of CD3 + T cells was up to 95%. CAR-T cells were cultured in normal complete medium in all experiments. CAR surface level and CD4/CD8 ratio were measured around 14 days after initial stimulation of PBMCs by CD3/CD28 Dynabeads.
1x10 5 per well CD19 CAR-T cells were stimulated with Raji cells (CD19 positive) or K562 cells (CD19 negative) at a 1:1 ratio in a round bottom 96-well tissue culture plate for 24 h, in the presence of the Brefeldin A Solution (eBioscience, Catalog: 00-4506-51) for the last 4 h. Cytokine productions of CAR-T cells were measured by standard intracellular staining procedure with cytokine antibodies, such as APC Rat anti-human IL-2 (eBioscience, Cat#17-7029-82), BV421 Rat anti-human IL-2 (Biolegend, Cat#500328), APC mouse anti-human TNF-α (eBioscience, Cat#17-7349-82), PE mouse anti-human TNF-α (eBioscience, Cat# 12-7349-82), APC mouse anti-human IFN-γ (eBioscience, Cat#17-7319-82).
For the Mesothelin CAR-T cells, K562 cells ectopically expressing mesothelin were used to provide antigen stimulation. Experimental procedure was the same for the CD19 CAR-T cells.
CD19 CAR-T cells were stimulated with Raji cells at a 1:1 ratio. CAR-T cells were collected at different time points to calculate total CAR + T cells number, detect Ki67 and Annexin V. Absolute number of CAR + T cells (indicated by eGFP + ) were counted by flow cytometry using the following formula: absolute number = (number of CAR + T cells events per μL) x (total volume of suspension). Ki67 expression of CAR-T cells was measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience, Catalog: 00-5523-00) and APC mouse anti-human Ki67 (eBioscience, Catalog: 17-5699-42). CAR-T cells apoptosis were detected by an Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit APC (eBioscience, Catalog: 88-8007-74).
For the Mesothelin CAR-T cells, K562 cells ectopically expressing mesothelin were used to provide antigen stimulation. Experimental procedure was the same for the CD19 CAR-T cells.
For western blot detection of phosphorylated proteins, CAR-T cells and Raji cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, centrifuged at 500 g, 4°C for 2min to force interaction of the cells. Then cell mixture was incubated at 37°C to stimulate CAR-T cells and the reaction was stopped by adding equal volume cold 2x lysis buffer (4% NP40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 40 mM NaF and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)). Cell lysis was performed on ice for 30 min. Total cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
For flow cytometric analysis of phosphorylated proteins, CAR-T cells and Raji cells were suspended at completed RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% FBS, and prechilled on ice. CAR-T cells were mixed with Raji cells at a 1:1 ratio, centrifuged at 500 g, 4°C for 2min to force interaction of the cells. Then CAR-T cells were immediately stimulated at 37°C water bath for indicated time points and stopped by adding equal volume cold 8% PFA to fix for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized and blocked by PBS buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 2% BSA for 1 h at 4°C, then stained with primary antibody Rabbit anti-pAkt Ser473 (4060, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-pS6 Ser235/236 (2211, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1.5 h at 4°C, plus with secondary antibody goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)-AF647(A-21245, Invitrogen) and PE-Cy7 mouse anti-human CD8 (Invitrogen, Cat# 25-0087-42). Antibodies were diluted at PBS buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 1% BSA. Cells were washed by PBS buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus 0.5% BSA after each step of staining. Phosphorylated proteins level of CD8 + CAR-T cells were detected by flow cytometry.
K562 cells ectopically expressed_CD19 and mCherry cells were used as target cells, and CD19 - K562 cells labeled with CellTracker Deep Red Dye (Invitrogen, Cat#C34557) were used as non-target cells. The target and non-target cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and then co-incubated with CAR-T cells at a 3:1 or 1:1 or 1:3 effector : target ratio in a U-bottom 96 well plate. Cells were then centrifuged for 1 min at 400 g to induce cell interaction. After 24 h coculture, cells were resuspended and fixed with an equal volume of 2% PFA and kept on ice before flow cytometry analysis. Control samples contained only target and non-target cells to set a gate for live cells and another gate for a ratio of target to non-target. The gates were applied to all reaction samples. Cytotoxic activities of CAR-T cells were measured by calculating target/non-target ratio for each sample normalized by control samples. Flow cytometry was performed on an BD LSR II Flow cytometer and Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer.
Raji xenograft tumor was established by injecting 3 million Raji cells subcutaneously to the right flank of each mouse on day 0. After implantation, mice were randomly allocated into different experimental groups and injected intravenously 8 million CAR-T cells per mouse on day 6. Tumors were monitored by digital caliper and the tumor area was calculated as follows: (major axis of tumor) × (minor axis of tumor). Mice were euthanized when the tumor area reached 200 mm 2 .

The NMR experiments for the backbone resonance assignment of Csk SH2 domain were performed at 298 K on Agilent DD2 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe. The NMR sample contained 0.4 mM of uniformly 13 C, 15 N-labeled Csk SH2 domain in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 50 mM NaCl and 10% D 2 O. In the 3D triple-resonance experiments, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH were collected for backbone resonance assignment. Sequence-specific resonance assignments were made using the standard triple resonance techniques.
To study CD3ε and Csk interaction, the titration experiments were performed on Agilent DD2 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe using 15 N-labeled Csk SH2 domain in the NMR buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 6.8) at 298 K. Non-phosphorylated CD3ε (CD3ε-Y1Y2), and mono-phosphorylated (CD3ε-pY1), non-phoshporyalted Pag, phoshporyalted Pag (Pag-pY317) were used for the titration experiments. [CD3ε]: [Csk-SH2] molar ratio was titrated up to 30:1 to reach saturation point. Side-by-side buffer titration was also performed to measure the dilution effect, which was minimal throughout the whole titration process. The concentration of the Csk SH2 domain was maintained at 0.1 or 0.05 mM. The amino acid sequences of the peptides are:

To investigate the role of BRS and PRS motifs in the interaction between CD3ε pY1 and Csk SH2 domain, titration experiments were performed on Agilent DD2 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe using 15 N-labeled Csk SH2 domain in the NMR buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer, 50 mM NaCl, pH 6.8) at 298 K and four kinds of CD3ε peptides: CD3ε-Y1Y2, CD3ε-pY1, CD3ε-pY1-BRS mut, and CD3ε-pY1-PRS mut. The four peptide sequences are shown in Figure S3 B. The concentration of 15 N-labeled Csk SH2 domain was maintained at 0.05 mM. The titration experiments were performed at two molar ratios (1:0 and 1:2) of Csk-SH2: CD3ε for each CD3ε peptide.
To investigate the interaction between CD3ε and p85, titration experiments were performed on Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryoprobe using 15 N-labeled p85 SH3 domain in the NMR buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 100 mM KCl, pH 6.0) at 298 K and four kinds of CD3ε peptides: CD3ε-Y1Y2, CD3ε-pY1, CD3ε-pY1-BRS mut, and CD3ε-pY1-PRS mut. The concentration of 15 N-labeled p85 SH3 domain was maintained at 0.1 mM. The titration experiments were performed at 1:1 molar ratio of p85-SH3:CD3ε for each CD3ε peptide.
In CD3 titration experiments, the signal perturbations of Csk are categorized to 6 (I to VI) types to represent low to high binding affinity, ranging from mM (Category II) to nM (Category VI). Category I represents no changes in both peak intensity and peak position; Category II represents changes in peak position but not in peak intensity; Category III represents changes in both peak position and peak intensity; Category IV represents disappearance of an “old” peak (peak broadening); Category V represents disappearance of an “old” peak coupled with gradual appearance of a “new” peak; Category VI represents disappearance of an “old” peak coupled with simultaneous appearance of a “new” peak.

Hui, E. ∙ Vale, R.D. In vitro membrane reconstitution of the T-cell receptor proximal signaling network Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :133-142 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). The N-terminal His10 tag in human Csk was removed by the TVMV protease. SNAP-tagged tandem SH2 domains of human Shp-1 and human Shp-2 were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified as described ( Hui et al., 2017 35. Hui, E. ∙ Cheung, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ... T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is a primary target for PD-1-mediated inhibition Science. 2017; 355 :1428-1433 Crossref Scopus (1135) PubMed Google Scholar ). All GST fusion proteins were purified using Glutathione Sepharose 4B and the GST tag were subsequently removed by the PreScission protease (GE Healthcare), as described ( Hui et al., 2017 35. Hui, E. ∙ Cheung, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ... T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is a primary target for PD-1-mediated inhibition Science. 2017; 355 :1428-1433 Crossref Scopus (1135) PubMed Google Scholar ). All His-tagged proteins were purified using the Ni-NTA agarose (GE Healthcare), and eluted with imidazole. All affinity purified proteins were subjected to gel filtration chromatography in HEPES buffered saline (HEPES-NaOH, pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). The monomer fractions were pooled, aliquoted, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C. SNAP-tagged SH2 containing proteins were labeled with SNAP-Cell 505 (SC505, NEB) following manufacture’s protocol. Free dyes were removed using a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). All proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.
Peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail of CD3ε, CD3εY1F (Y170F), and CD3εY2F (Y181F) with an N-terminal His10 tag were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. Peptide powders were dissolved in HEPES buffered saline, aliquoted, snap frozen, stored at −80°C, and quantified by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining, using BSA as a standard.
DGS-NTA-Ni/Rhodamine-PE containing LUVs were prepared by extrusion 20 times through a pair of polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 200 nm, as described ( Hui and Vale, 2014 34. Hui, E. ∙ Vale, R.D. In vitro membrane reconstitution of the T-cell receptor proximal signaling network Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :133-142 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, phospholipids (89.7% POPC, 10% DGS-NTA-Ni, 0.3% Rhodamine-PE) were dried under a stream of Argon, desiccated for at least 2 h and suspended in 1x kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM TCEP), followed by extrusion.
Experiments were conducted as described ( Hui and Vale, 2014 34. Hui, E. ∙ Vale, R.D. In vitro membrane reconstitution of the T-cell receptor proximal signaling network Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21 :133-142 Crossref Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ), with modifications. His-tagged proteins and non-His-tagged effector proteins were mixed at desired concentrations in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM TCEP) containing 0.5 mg/mL BSA and LUVs with Rhodamine-PE. Reaction mixtures were aliquoted into a solid-white 384-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 40 min, during which the SC505 fluorescence intensity (F.I.) was continuously monitored to obtain the baseline. After incubation, 1 mM ATP (final concentration) was injected into each well to trigger phosphorylation, and the F.I. was further monitored. Data were normalized by setting the average F.I. value of the last 10 data points before ATP addition as 100% and the background fluorescence as 0%. In Figure 2 D, indicated concentrations of CD45, 5 nM His-tagged Lck, 500 nM His-CD3ζ proteins, and 300 nM SC505-Zap70 were used. In Figures 4 and 1 μM CD3ε ( Figure 4 B) or indicated concentrations of CD3ε ( Figure 4 C), 10 nM His-tagged Lck, and 100 nM SC505-labeled SH2-containing proteins were used.
For the CD45 dose-response curve, the extent of Zap70 recruitment at 30 min at 0 nM CD45 condition and no ATP condition were set as 100% and 0%, respectively, and the % recruitment at other CD45 concentrations was normalized to these conditions. Data were fitted with Prism 5.0 by using the “Dose-response-Inhibition,” yielding IC 50 values.
For the Csk binding curve, the drop of SC505 F.I. at 10 min were plotted as a function of CD3ε concentration. Data were fitted with Graphpad Prism 5.0 by using the “One site–specific binding,” yielding K d value.
1 μM CD3ε peptides were separately mixed with 20 nM Lck and 1 nM CD45 in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mg/mL BSA, 1 mM TCEP, and LUVs composed of 1 mM total lipids). The mixtures were incubated at 23°C for 40 min so that CD3ε, Lck, and CD45 bind onto LUVs via histidine-Ni-NTA interaction. After incubation, 1 mM ATP was added to the mixtures to start phosphorylation and the mixtures were further incubated at 23°C. At each time point after ATP addition indicated in the figures, portion of reaction mixtures were collected and mixed with SDS sample buffer to stop the reaction. The samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted by pY20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat#sc-1624). The optical densities (OD) of bands were quantified using ImageJ and normalized by setting the OD at 120 min as 100%. The t 1/2 value under each condition was calculated by fitting the data to a standard sigmoidal curve by setting 0% and 100% as plateau in Graphpad Prism 5.
Jurkat cells were lentivirally transduced to co-express CAR-mGFP and mCherry-Csk, as described ( Hui et al., 2017 35. Hui, E. ∙ Cheung, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ... T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is a primary target for PD-1-mediated inhibition Science. 2017; 355 :1428-1433 Crossref Scopus (1135) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CD19.28Z-CAR construct contains CD8 signal peptide, FMC63 scFv, CD8α hinge, CD28 transmembrane domain (CD28 TM ), CD28 cytoplasmic domain (CD28 CD ), CD3ζ cytoplasmic domain (CD3ζ CD ), and mGFP. The CD19.28Z-CAR construct contains additional CD3ε CD between CD28 TM and CD28 CD . To produce lentiviruses, DNA coding the gene of interest was cloned into the pHR vector, and transfected to HEK293T cells together with the pMG2.G (envelop plasmid) psPAX2 (packaging plasmid) using polyethylenimine in DMEM. The medium was substituted with RPMI medium 24 h later and viruses were harvested another 48 h later. For gene transduction, 1 million Jurkat cells were resuspended in 1 mL fresh virus supernatant, incubated overnight at 37°C / 5% CO 2 .
Supporting lipid bilayers (SLBs) were prepared as described ( Hui et al., 2017 35. Hui, E. ∙ Cheung, J. ∙ Zhu, J. ... T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is a primary target for PD-1-mediated inhibition Science. 2017; 355 :1428-1433 Crossref Scopus (1135) PubMed Google Scholar ), and incubated with 5 nM CD19-His (Sino Biological) and 3 nM ICAM-1-His (Sino Biological) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by extensive wash to remove unbound proteins. CAR-mGFP/mCherry-Csk co-expressing Jurkat cells were plated onto SLBs functionalized with CD19 and ICAM-1. For live cell imaging shown in Videos S1, S2, time-lapse acquisition was immediately started after cell landing to the SLBs. For co-clustering analysis shown in Figure 6 , cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS 15 min after plating. After 10-min incubation at 37°C, cells were extensively washed with PBS containing 1 mg/mL BSA, and further incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Saponin and 1 mg/mL BSA for 10 min at 23°C. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 1 mg/mL BSA to remove Saponin and incubated for overnight at 4°C before TIRF microscopy observation. TIRF images were acquired at 37°C on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a 100x Apo TIRF 1.49 NA objective, controlled by the Micro-Manager software ( Edelstein et al., 2014 23. Edelstein, A.D. ∙ Tsuchida, M.A. ∙ Amodaj, N. ... Advanced methods of microscope control using μManager software J. Biol. Methods. 2014; 1 :e10 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and analyzed with ImageJ. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated using the “Coloc2” plugin in ImageJ with default settings after background signal subtraction using “Subtract background” command in ImageJ. Statistical significance was evaluated by two-tailed Student’s unpaired test in GraphPad Prism 5.
Jurkat cells were lentivirally transduced to express CAR-mGFP and cultured as described above. CAR-expressing Jurkat cells were serum starved at 37°C for 3 h to reduce the phosphorylation background. After the incubation, four million Jurkat cells were mixed with two million Raji B cells on ice. The cell mixture was centrifuged at 300 g for 1 min at 4°C to initiate the Jurkat-Raji contact and was immediately transferred into a 37°C water bath to start signaling in Jurkat cells. After the incubation, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5% Glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF) on ice, and centrifuged at 14000 g for 5 min to remove insoluble materials. The soluble cell lysate was mixed with GFP-Trap and incubated for 3 h at 4°C to immunoprecipitate mGFP-tagged CARs. After rinsed with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 10 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 10 mM NaF), the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was set to p < 0.05 and represented as ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001, as indicated in the figure legends.
