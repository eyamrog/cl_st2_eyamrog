Title: Cysteine Toxicity Drives Age-Related Mitochondrial Decline by Altering Iron Homeostasis


Abstract: Summary

Mitochondria and lysosomes are functionally linked, and their interdependent decline is a hallmark of aging and disease. Despite the long-standing connection between these organelles, the function(s) of lysosomes required to sustain mitochondrial health remains unclear. Here, working in yeast, we show that the lysosome-like vacuole maintains mitochondrial respiration by spatially compartmentalizing amino acids. Defects in vacuole function result in a breakdown in intracellular amino acid homeostasis, which drives age-related mitochondrial decline. Among amino acids, we find that cysteine is most toxic for mitochondria and show that elevated non-vacuolar cysteine impairs mitochondrial respiration by limiting intracellular iron availability through an oxidant-based mechanism. Cysteine depletion or iron supplementation restores mitochondrial health in vacuole-impaired cells and prevents mitochondrial decline during aging. These results demonstrate that cysteine toxicity is a major driver of age-related mitochondrial deterioration and identify vacuolar amino acid compartmentation as a cellular strategy to minimize amino acid toxicity.

Section: Introduction

Mitochondria are a hub for cellular metabolism ( Friedman and Nunnari, 2014 38. Friedman, J.R. ∙ Nunnari, J. Mitochondrial form and function Nature. 2014; 505 :335-343 Crossref Scopus (517) PubMed Google Scholar ). They produce ATP, house pathways for amino acid, nucleotide, heme, iron-sulfur cluster (ISC), and lipid metabolism ( Rutter and Hughes, 2015 84. Rutter, J. ∙ Hughes, A.L. Power(2): the power of yeast genetics applied to the powerhouse of the cell Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 26 :59-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ) and facilitate reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, innate immunity, and apoptosis ( Chandel, 2014 16. Chandel, N.S. Mitochondria as signaling organelles BMC Biol. 2014; 12 :34 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mitochondrial decline is a hallmark of aging and age-related disease ( Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012; Wallace, 2005 75. Nunnari, J. ∙ Suomalainen, A. Mitochondria: in sickness and in health Cell. 2012; 148 :1145-1159 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1076) PubMed Google Scholar 102. Wallace, D.C. A mitochondrial paradigm of metabolic and degenerative diseases, aging, and cancer: a dawn for evolutionary medicine Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39 :359-407 Crossref Scopus (2162) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, what drives mitochondrial decline during aging remains unclear.
Working in the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae , we recently shed light on this question by showing that deterioration of the lysosome-like vacuole is an early event during yeast replicative aging and that loss of vacuole acidification underlies age-related mitochondrial dysfunction ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vacuoles are acidic organelles that facilitate protein degradation, metabolic signaling, and metabolite compartmentation ( Klionsky et al., 1990; Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019 56. Klionsky, D.J. ∙ Herman, P.K. ∙ Emr, S.D. The fungal vacuole: composition, function, and biogenesis Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54 :266-292 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 59. Lawrence, R.E. ∙ Zoncu, R. The lysosome as a cellular centre for signalling, metabolism and quality control Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :133-142 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Vacuolar function requires the vacuolar-H + -ATPase (V-ATPase), a vacuole-membrane-localized protein complex that acidifies vacuoles by generating a proton gradient across the vacuole membrane ( Forgac, 2007 37. Forgac, M. Vacuolar ATPases: rotary proton pumps in physiology and pathophysiology Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 :917-929 Crossref Scopus (855) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our discovery that vacuole acidification is required to maintain mitochondrial health during aging is consistent with numerous prior and subsequent observations that vacuoles and mitochondria are physically and functionally linked across organisms ( Dimmer et al., 2002; Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014; Hönscher et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2013; Merz and Westermann, 2009; Ohya et al., 1991; Wong et al., 2018, 2019; Yambire et al., 2019 27.

Despite the importance of the mitochondria-lysosome connection in aging and disease, it remains unclear how these two organelles are functionally linked, as well as what function of lysosomes prevents age-related mitochondrial deterioration. Here, we address these questions by showing that defects in vacuole-dependent amino acid compartmentation hamper mitochondrial respiration by limiting the intracellular bioavailability of iron, a critical component of the mitochondrial respiratory machinery. These results indicate that age-related mitochondrial deterioration is driven by amino-acid-dependent iron limitation and suggest that vacuoles promote mitochondrial health by limiting amino acid toxicity through subcellular compartmentation.

Section: Results

We and others previously found that vacuole acidification is required to maintain mitochondrial function and structure in budding yeast ( Dimmer et al., 2002; Hughes and Gottschling, 2012; Merz and Westermann, 2009; Ohya et al., 1991 27.

We confirmed these findings and showed that yeast lacking V-ATPase components ( vma1 Δ and vph2 Δ; Hirata et al., 1990; Jackson and Stevens, 1997 44. Hirata, R. ∙ Ohsumk, Y. ∙ Nakano, A. ...

Likewise, acute ablation of vacuole acidification with concA caused fragmentation and aggregation of the tubular mitochondrial network and depleted the energetic potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane ( Figures 1 C–1F, S1 A, and S1B; Videos S1 and S2 ).

To dissect the functional connection between vacuoles and mitochondria, we utilized a high-copy plasmid genomic DNA library ( Jones et al., 2008 53. Jones, G.M. ∙ Stalker, J. ∙ Humphray, S. ... A systematic library for comprehensive overexpression screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :239-241 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) to identify suppressors of the non-fermentable carbon source growth defect of V-ATPase-deficient cells. Our screen uncovered a single high-copy suppressor, FET4 , that permitted growth on glycerol in the presence of V-ATPase inhibition ( Figure 1 G). In parallel, we screened the yeast non-essential gene deletion collection ( Giaever et al., 2002; Winzeler et al., 1999 40. Giaever, G. ∙ Chu, A.M. ∙ Ni, L. ... Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome Nature. 2002; 418 :387-391 Crossref Scopus (2774) PubMed Google Scholar 105. Winzeler, E.A. ∙ Shoemaker, D.D. ∙ Astromoff, A. ... Functional characterization of the S. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis Science. 1999; 285 :901-906 Crossref Scopus (2822) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that deletion of ROX1 , a transcriptional repressor of FET4 ( Jensen and Culotta, 2002; Waters and Eide, 2002 51. Jensen, L.T. ∙ Culotta, V.C. Regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae FET4 by oxygen and iron J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318 :251-260 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 103. Waters, B.M. ∙ Eide, D.J. Combinatorial control of yeast FET4 gene expression by iron, zinc, and oxygen J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :33749-33757 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), suppressed the respiratory-deficient phenotype of V-ATPase impaired cells ( Figure 1 H). Enhanced mitochondrial function in V-ATPase-deficient rox1 Δ cells required FET4 , suggesting that ROX1 deletion restores mitochondrial respiration in V-ATPase-deficient cells by elevating FET4 expression ( Figure 1 H).
Fet4 is a plasma-membrane-embedded metal permease that facilitates low-affinity iron uptake in budding yeast ( Dix et al., 1994 28. Dix, D.R. ∙ Bridgham, J.T. ∙ Broderius, M.A. ... The FET4 gene encodes the low affinity Fe(II) transport protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 :26092-26099 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like FET4 overexpression, iron supplementation with exogenous ferrous ammonium sulfate restored growth of V-ATPase-deficient cells on respiratory-based carbon sources ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Iron supplementation also suppressed mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential defects caused by acute V-ATPase inhibition ( Figures 1 K–1N and S1 C; Video S3 ). Thus, genetic or pharmacologic iron supplementation restores mitochondrial health in V-ATPase-deficient cells.

Based on our above findings that iron supplementation restores mitochondrial function in V-ATPase-depleted cells and previous observations that V-ATPase inhibition causes iron starvation ( Diab and Kane, 2013 26. Diab, H.I. ∙ Kane, P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2 J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :11366-11377 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wondered whether iron limitation causes mitochondrial dysfunction upon V-ATPase deficiency. To test this, we first evaluated the impact of V-ATPase inhibition on cellular iron metabolism by monitoring activation of the Aft1-dependent iron transcriptional regulon in V-ATPase-inhibited cells. Aft1 is a transcription factor that localizes to the nucleus upon iron deprivation and remodels iron metabolism through the induction of a set of genes known as the iron regulon ( Chen et al., 2004; Rutherford et al., 2005; Yamaguchi-Iwai et al., 1995 17. Chen, O.S. ∙ Crisp, R.J. ∙ Valachovic, M. ... Transcription of the yeast iron regulon does not respond directly to iron but rather to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :29513-29518 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Rutherford, J.C. ∙ Ojeda, L. ∙ Balk, J. ... Activation of the iron regulon by the yeast Aft1/Aft2 transcription factors depends on mitochondrial but not cytosolic iron-sulfur protein biogenesis J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :10135-10140 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar 109. Yamaguchi-Iwai, Y. ∙ Dancis, A. ∙ Klausner, R.D. AFT1: a mediator of iron regulated transcriptional control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae EMBO J. 1995; 14 :1231-1239 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with previous observations ( Diab and Kane, 2013 26. Diab, H.I. ∙ Kane, P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2 J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :11366-11377 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), cytoplasmic Aft1-GFP concentrated in the nucleus shortly after V-ATPase inhibition in an iron-dependent manner ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Aft1 nuclear translocation occurred within 30 min of V-ATPase impairment, similar to effects caused by the iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate (BPS) ( Cowart et al., 1993 20. Cowart, R.E. ∙ Singleton, F.L. ∙ Hind, J.S. A comparison of bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid and ferrozine as chelators of iron(II) in reduction reactions Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211 :151-155 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 A). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that Aft1 nuclear localization correlated with robust induction of iron regulon transcripts in an Aft1-dependent manner ( Figure 2 C).
To further investigate the connection between vacuole impairment and iron homeostasis, we generated a quantitative Aft1 transcriptional reporter composed of the Aft1-responsive FIT2 promoter ( FIT2pr ) driving expression of GFP, integrated into an empty region of chromosome I ( Figure 2 D). Aft1-dependent GFP expression was robustly activated by pharmacological or genetic V-ATPase impairment, as monitored by western blot and flow cytometry ( Figures 2 E, 2F, S2 B, and S2C). FIT2pr -based GFP expression was induced similarly by V-ATPase inhibition and complete extracellular iron chelation with BPS, was dependent on Aft1, and was suppressed by FET4 overexpression or supplementation with either ferric (Fe 3+ ) or ferrous (Fe 2+ ) iron ( Figures S2 D–S2G). Furthermore, loss of AFT1 was lethal in V-ATPase-deficient cells, and growth was restored by iron supplementation ( Figure 2 G). A similar synergistic, iron-dependent lethality was observed between concA and the iron chelator BPS ( Figure S2 H). These results confirm that loss of V-ATPase activity limits cellular iron and activates the iron regulon, the latter of which is essential for growth in the absence of a functioning vacuole.
We next examined the connection between iron limitation and mitochondrial dysfunction in V-ATPase-deficient cells. Aft1 senses intracellular iron by monitoring levels of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs) ( Chen et al., 2004; Rutherford et al., 2005 17. Chen, O.S. ∙ Crisp, R.J. ∙ Valachovic, M. ... Transcription of the yeast iron regulon does not respond directly to iron but rather to iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :29513-29518 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Rutherford, J.C. ∙ Ojeda, L. ∙ Balk, J. ... Activation of the iron regulon by the yeast Aft1/Aft2 transcription factors depends on mitochondrial but not cytosolic iron-sulfur protein biogenesis J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :10135-10140 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). ISCs are generated from iron and cysteine in the mitochondria and are essential cofactors for proteins in mitochondrial respiration and other cellular activities ( Braymer and Lill, 2017 13. Braymer, J.J. ∙ Lill, R. Iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and trafficking in mitochondria J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 :12754-12763 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Loss of ISCs impairs the activity and stability of ISC-containing proteins. Because of the connection between Aft1 and ISCs, we wondered whether ISC-containing enzymes were impacted by V-ATPase inhibition. Indeed, levels of aconitase (Aco1), a mitochondrial-localized ISC protein in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ( Gangloff et al., 1990 39. Gangloff, S.P. ∙ Marguet, D. ∙ Lauquin, G.J. Molecular cloning of the yeast mitochondrial aconitase gene (ACO1) and evidence of a synergistic regulation of expression by glucose plus glutamate Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10 :3551-3561 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ), declined upon V-ATPase inhibition with kinetics that paralleled activation of the iron regulon ( Figure 2 E). Similarly, Sdh2 and Rip1, ISC proteins in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes II and III, respectively ( Cui et al., 2012; Van Vranken et al., 2015 21. Cui, T.-Z. ∙ Smith, P.M. ∙ Fox, J.L. ... Late-stage maturation of the Rieske Fe/S protein: Mzm1 stabilizes Rip1 but does not facilitate its translocation by the AAA ATPase Bcs1 Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32 :4400-4409 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar 98. Van Vranken, J.G. ∙ Na, U. ∙ Winge, D.R. ... Protein-mediated assembly of succinate dehydrogenase and its cofactors Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2015; 50 :168-180 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), both declined upon V-ATPase inhibition, but not in the presence of excess iron ( Figure 2 H).
Paralleling the changes in these individual iron-containing respiratory chain proteins, Blue-Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) analysis indicated that assembled respiratory complexes II and III decreased with acute V-ATPase inhibition in an iron-dependent manner, although the level of non-iron-containing complex V was unaffected ( Figure 2 H). Consistent with these observations, cellular oxygen consumption was reduced after acute V-ATPase impairment to levels present in strains lacking mitochondrial DNA (and thus respiration) and restored with iron supplementation ( Figure 2 I). Moreover, ISCs outside of mitochondria were also impacted by vacuole impairment, as steady-state levels of GFP-tagged ISC-containing proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cytosol, and nucleus all decreased upon V-ATPase inhibition ( Figure 2 J). Analysis of the turnover kinetics of two ISC-containing proteins, Lys4 and Twy1, using the recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE) system ( Verzijlbergen et al., 2010 100. Verzijlbergen, K.F. ∙ Menendez-Benito, V. ∙ van Welsem, T. ... Recombination-induced tag exchange to track old and new proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :64-68 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealed increased turnover upon V-ATPase inhibition ( Figure S2 I). Thus, V-ATPase loss impairs mitochondrial function by limiting cellular iron, which hampers ISC-protein stability, depletes iron-containing respiratory chain complexes, and impairs mitochondrial respiration.
We sought to identify the V-ATPase-dependent cellular function that maintains iron homeostasis and mitochondrial respiration. V-ATPase activity is required for cellular iron uptake through the Fet3 high-affinity iron uptake system ( Davis-Kaplan et al., 1998, 2004 22. Davis-Kaplan, S.R. ∙ Askwith, C.C. ∙ Bengtzen, A.C. ...

Microbiol. 1974; 101 :45-57 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We investigated whether disruption of any of these three activities caused iron limitation in V-ATPase-deficient cells. We ruled out alterations in cellular iron uptake as a possibility because total intracellular iron levels did not decline upon V-ATPase impairment as measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) ( Figures S3 A and S3B). In fact, intracellular iron levels increased upon acute V-ATPase inhibition and were chronically elevated in V-ATPase mutants, despite activation of the iron regulon under these conditions ( Figures S3 A and S3B). Interestingly, although total intracellular iron increased in V-ATPase-deficient cells, subcellular fractionation indicated that mitochondrial iron content actually declined upon V-ATPase inhibition ( Figures S3 C and S3D). However, attempts to restore mitochondrial function in V-ATPase mutants by overexpression of mitochondrial iron importers Mrs3 and Mrs4 were unsuccessful ( Figure S3 E), suggesting that the excess iron in V-ATPase-deficient cells is not bioavailable.
We next considered whether altered autophagy limited iron bioavailability in V-ATPase-deficient cells. Deletion of ATG5 , which is essential for autophagy ( Feng et al., 2014 34. Feng, Y. ∙ He, D. ∙ Yao, Z. ... The machinery of macroautophagy Cell Res. 2014; 24 :24-41 Crossref Scopus (774) PubMed Google Scholar ), or PEP4 , a master vacuolar protease ( Jones et al., 1982 52. Jones, E.W. ∙ Zubenko, G.S. ∙ Parker, R.R. PEP4 gene function is required for expression of several vacuolar hydrolases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genetics. 1982; 102 :665-677 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), did not trigger activation of the Aft1-dependent iron regulon, indicating altered protein degradation did not cause iron starvation upon V-ATPase impairment ( Figure S3 F). Therefore, we investigated whether altered vacuolar nutrient compartmentation limited iron bioavailability in V-ATPase-deficient cells. As depicted in Figure 3 A, vacuoles serve as reservoirs for amino acids in yeast ( Kitamoto et al., 1988; Klionsky et al., 1990; Wiemken and Dürr, 1974 55. Kitamoto, K. ∙ Yoshizawa, K. ∙ Ohsumi, Y. ... Dynamic aspects of vacuolar and cytosolic amino acid pools of Saccharomyces cerevisiae J.

Microbiol. 1974; 101 :45-57 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Amino acid transport into vacuoles is driven by membrane-bound transporters of the amino acid vacuolar transport (AVT) and vacuolar basic amino acid transport (VBA) families, which harness the V-ATPase proton gradient to import neutral and basic amino acids into the vacuole lumen, limiting their cytoplasmic levels ( Russnak et al., 2001; Shimazu et al., 2005 82. Russnak, R. ∙ Konczal, D. ∙ McIntire, S.L. A family of yeast proteins mediating bidirectional vacuolar amino acid transport J. Biol.

A family of basic amino acid transporters of the vacuolar membrane from Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :4851-4857 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). We previously showed that age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, which is triggered by loss of vacuole acidity, is suppressed by overexpression of AVT1 , a V-ATPase-dependent vacuolar neutral amino acid importer ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012; Tone et al., 2015 46.

Biochem. 2015; 79 :782-789 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). This result and our current observations suggest that loss of vacuolar amino acid compartmentation causes increased non-vacuolar amino acid pools, which in turn may limit the bioavailability of intracellular iron and cause mitochondrial impairment.
Consistent with this idea, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that acute V-ATPase inhibition triggered a transcriptional response indicative of perturbed intracellular amino acid homeostasis. Specifically, transcripts of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis were downregulated upon acute V-ATPase impairment, whereas genes involved in the breakdown of amino acids, specifically components of the Ehrlich pathway ( Hazelwood et al., 2008 42. Hazelwood, L.A. ∙ Daran, J.M. ∙ van Maris, A.J. ... The Ehrlich pathway for fusel alcohol production: a century of research on Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74 :2259-2266 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as arginine, proline, and cysteine catabolism, were upregulated ( Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012 63. Ljungdahl, P.O. ∙ Daignan-Fornier, B. Regulation of amino acid, nucleotide, and phosphate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genetics. 2012; 190 :885-929 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 B–3D; Table S1 ). These changes, combined with the observation that V-ATPase impairment did not alter whole-cell, steady-state levels of amino acids ( Figure S4 A), strongly suggest that impairment of V-ATPase-driven vacuolar amino acid import alters intracellular amino acid distribution, resulting in cytoplasmic amino acid elevation. These perturbations in amino acid homeostasis occurred simultaneously with upregulation of the Aft1-dependent iron regulon ( Figure 3 E), indicating that V-ATPase inhibition causes acute amino acid stress concurrently with the deregulation of iron homeostasis.
To directly test the hypothesis that elevated non-vacuolar amino acids impair iron homeostasis, we analyzed activation of the iron regulon upon V-ATPase impairment in amino acid limited medium. We found that concA-induced iron limitation was blunted in low amino acid medium and restored with peptone, a source of amino acids ( Figure 4 A). Removal of all amino acids from the medium further suppressed activation of the iron regulon in V-ATPase-deficient cells and prevented loss of the ISC protein Aco1 ( Figure 4 B). Moreover, the synthetic lethality between V-ATPase deficiency and loss of AFT1 was suppressed in low-amino-acid medium and restored with peptone in an iron-dependent manner ( Figure 4 C). These changes in Aft1 activity between high- and low-amino-acid medium were not caused by differences in iron content of the media, as low-amino-acid medium contained less iron than high-amino-acid medium as measured by ICP-MS ( Figure S4 B), and cells were more sensitive to the iron chelator BPS in low-amino-acid medium, as measured by activation of the iron regulon ( Figure S4 C). Additionally, the impact of amino acids on iron homeostasis occurred intracellularly. The Aft1 regulon was still activated when cells were pre-grown in high-amino-acid medium prior to treatment with concA in amino-acid-free medium ( Figure 4 D).
To further test whether elevated amino acids interfere with iron bioavailability, we monitored activation of the iron regulon in response to vacuole-independent perturbations in the cytoplasmic amino acid pool. Prior studies showed that cytoplasmic amino acid levels are tightly linked to protein translation and turnover rates. Specifically, inhibition of protein synthesis elevates cytoplasmic amino acids ( Beugnet et al., 2003 10. Beugnet, A. ∙ Tee, A.R. ∙ Taylor, P.M. ... Regulation of targets of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by intracellular amino acid availability Biochem. J. 2003; 372 :555-566 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ), and impairment of protein breakdown by proteasome inhibition depletes intracellular amino acids ( Suraweera et al., 2012 94. Suraweera, A. ∙ Münch, C. ∙ Hanssum, A. ... Failure of amino acid homeostasis causes cell death following proteasome inhibition Mol. Cell. 2012; 48 :242-253 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 3 A). Indeed, inhibition of protein translation with cycloheximide (CHX) activated the iron regulon ( Figures S4 D and 4 E). Conversely, proteasome inhibition with MG-132 prevented induction of the iron regulon by V-ATPase inhibition ( Figure 4 F). We also found that AFT1 was essential for survival of CHX-treated cells in an iron-dependent manner and that dual ablation of V-ATPase activity and protein translation caused iron-dependent synthetic lethality ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Finally, amino acid limitation restored mitochondrial function caused by V-ATPase inhibition ( Figure 4 I). These data suggest that high levels of non-vacuolar amino acids limit iron bioavailability and mitochondrial function in V-ATPase-impaired cells.
To identify which amino acid(s) disrupt iron homeostasis when V-ATPase function is compromised, we monitored activation of the iron regulon in V-ATPase-impaired cells cultured in low-amino-acid medium supplemented individually with 1 mM of each proteogenic amino acid. We found that addition of cysteine, and to a lesser extent threonine, restored Aft1 activity to levels observed in high-amino-acid medium ( Figure 5 A). At concentrations higher than 1 mM, threonine-dependent induction of the iron regulon was enhanced ( Figure S5 A). Cysteine and threonine supplementation also re-induced respiratory growth defects caused by V-ATPase inhibition when added to low-amino-acid medium ( Figure 5 B). Remarkably, at concentrations higher than 1 mM, cysteine addition alone in the absence of vacuole impairment activated the iron regulon, impaired assembly of respiratory chain complexes, decreased oxygen consumption, and impaired cell growth in an iron-dependent manner ( Figures 5 C–5F).
To determine whether the effects of cysteine and threonine resulted from changes in the intracellular pools of these amino acids, we genetically modulated enzymes that degrade these amino acids within cells and assayed the impact of these manipulations on iron reporter activity and cell growth under conditions of V-ATPase impairment. Deletion or overexpression of cystathionine gamma-lyase ( CYS3 ), which breaks down cysteine to pyruvate, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide ( Figure 5 G; Smacchi and Gobbetti, 1998; Stipanuk, 2004; Yamagata et al., 1993 90.

Bacteriol. 1993; 175 :4800-4808 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), increased or decreased iron regulon activity, respectively, upon V-ATPase inhibition ( Figures 5 H and 5I). Similarly, deletion or overexpression of threonine aldolase ( GLY1 ), which breaks down threonine to glycine and acetaldehyde ( Figure 5 G; Liu et al., 1997; Monschau et al., 1997 62. Liu, J.Q. ∙ Nagata, S. ∙ Dairi, T. ...

Identification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae GLY1 as a threonine aldolase: a key enzyme in glycine biosynthesis FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150 :55-60 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), also increased or diminished V-ATPase-induced iron regulon activity, respectively ( Figures 5 J and 5K). Furthermore, both CYS3 and GLY1 , which are dispensable for growth in untreated cells, were essential for survival upon V-ATPase impairment in an iron-dependent manner ( Figures 5 L and 5M).
Although both cysteine and threonine were sufficient to drive iron starvation, only cysteine was necessary to induce Aft1 activity. Dropout of threonine alone from 10× amino-acid-concentrated synthetic medium had no impact on iron regulon activity in response to V-ATPase inhibition, although removal of cysteine fully prevented iron-regulon activation ( Figure 5 N). Thus, elevated cysteine is necessary and sufficient to limit intracellular iron availability in V-ATPase-impaired cells. We speculate that threonine may impact iron homeostasis by allosterically regulating cysteine metabolism, as threonine and cysteine are metabolically linked through homoserine in S. cerevisiae ( Cherest et al., 1969; Ramos et al., 1991 18.

Inhibition by different amino acids of the aspartate kinase and the homoserine kinase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae FEBS Lett. 1991; 278 :123-126 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S5 B). Consistent with this idea, D-threonine did not affect iron metabolism, despite being taken up by cells as efficiently as naturally occurring L-threonine ( Figures S5 C and S5D). Finally, our results indicate that elevated non-vacuolar cysteine, rather than a cysteine derivative, likely drives iron limitation, as other cysteine-related metabolites, including homocysteine, glutathione, and methionine, did not impact the iron regulon ( Figures S5 E, S5F, and 5 A). Iron limitation was also not induced with S-methyl-l-cysteine, indicating the sulfhydryl group contributes to cysteine’s impact on iron homeostasis ( Figure S5 G).
We next investigated how elevated non-vacuolar cysteine limits intracellular iron bioavailability upon V-ATPase impairment. Cysteine is a thiol-containing redox active amino acid, and its toxicity across organisms and tissues is well documented ( Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2006; Nishiuch et al., 1976; Olney et al., 1990; Ruiz et al., 2017; Takumi and Nonaka, 2016 8.

Prior studies suggested that cysteine toxicity is linked to its ability to generate oxidant stress via its propensity to auto-oxidize, and we confirmed that cysteine can produce hydrogen peroxide in vitro in the presence of low levels of copper ( Figure 6 A; Flynn et al., 1984; Poole, 2015; Viña et al., 1983 36. Flynn, S.M. ∙ Clydesdale, F.M. ∙ Zajicek, O.T. Complexation, stability and behavior of L-cysteine and L-lysine with different iron sources J.

J. 1983; 212 :39-44 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also widely documented that ISCs are highly susceptible to oxidants ( Djaman et al., 2004 29. Djaman, O. ∙ Outten, F.W. ∙ Imlay, J.A. Repair of oxidized iron-sulfur clusters in Escherichia coli J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :44590-44599 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that V-ATPase inhibition elevates ROS levels cells ( Diab and Kane, 2013; Milgrom et al., 2007 26. Diab, H.I. ∙ Kane, P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2 J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :11366-11377 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Milgrom, E. ∙ Diab, H. ∙ Middleton, F. ... Loss of vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase activity in yeast results in chronic oxidative stress J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :7125-7136 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we considered the possibility that elevated cysteine in V-ATPase-impaired cells limits iron bioavailability by generating ROS, which disrupts ISCs in proteins and impairs iron availability.
To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed that exposure of cells to oxidant stress is sufficient to impair iron homeostasis. Addition of paraquat ( Bus and Gibson, 1984 14. Bus, J.S. ∙ Gibson, J.E. Paraquat: model for oxidant-initiated toxicity Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55 :37-46 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) or hydrogen peroxide both activated the iron regulon in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that oxidant stress is sufficient to impair iron availability ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Low-dose paraquat also impaired growth of V-ATPase-deficient cells in an iron-dependent manner ( Figure S6 A). Next, we tested whether V-ATPase inhibition generates ROS, as previously suggested ( Diab and Kane, 2013; Milgrom et al., 2007 26. Diab, H.I. ∙ Kane, P.M. Loss of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in yeast generates an iron deprivation signal that is moderated by induction of the peroxiredoxin TSA2 J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :11366-11377 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 67. Milgrom, E. ∙ Diab, H. ∙ Middleton, F. ... Loss of vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase activity in yeast results in chronic oxidative stress J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282 :7125-7136 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found via RNA-seq analysis that treatment of cells with concA significantly upregulated a host of antioxidant defense genes ( Figure 6 D) and that key antioxidant genes SOD1 and TSA1 became essential for survival upon V-ATPase inhibition in an iron-dependent manner ( Figures 6 E and 6F). However, we initially detected no evidence of increased intracellular oxidants upon concA treatment using several common readouts of oxidative stress, including protein carbonylation, oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide sensor HyPer ( Bilan et al., 2013 11. Bilan, D.S. ∙ Pase, L. ∙ Joosen, L. ... HyPer-3: a genetically encoded H(2)O(2) probe with improved performance for ratiometric and fluorescence lifetime imaging ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 :535-542 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and hyperoxidation of the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 ( Hanzén et al., 2016; Molin et al., 2011 41. Hanzén, S. ∙ Vielfort, K. ∙ Yang, J. ... Lifespan control by redox-dependent recruitment of chaperones to misfolded proteins Cell. 2016; 166 :140-151 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Molin, M. ∙ Yang, J. ∙ Hanzén, S. ... Life span extension and H(2)O(2) resistance elicited by caloric restriction require the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mol. Cell. 2011; 43 :823-833 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S6 B–S6D).
In considering the potential cause of this inconsistency, we tested whether levels of ROS produced by V-ATPase mutants were lower than the sensitivity of the latter three assays. Indeed, when cells were exposed to a range of hydrogen peroxide concentrations, we only observed changes via oxyblot, HyPer oxidation, and Tsa1 hyperoxidation at the highest concentration of hydrogen peroxide tested, 600 μM ( Figures S6 E–S6G). At 300 μM and below, no oxidation via these three assays was observable. In contrast, iron homeostasis was perturbed by low levels of hydrogen peroxide, starting at 100 μM and peaking at 300 μM ( Figure 6 C).
To circumvent the low sensitivity of these oxidative stress readouts, we identified two additional ROS indicators that responded to low levels of hydrogen peroxide, including levels sufficient to disrupt iron homeostasis. As shown in Figure 6 G, the ratio of oxidized to reduced peroxiredoxin Tsa1, as probed by accessibility of its redox active cysteines to modification by methoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG)-maleimide, increased upon low-dose hydrogen peroxide exposure. Additionally, accumulation of Tsa1 into cytoplasmic foci, previously shown to result from oxidant stress, robustly occurred at low doses of hydrogen peroxide ( Hanzén et al., 2016; Molin et al., 2011 41. Hanzén, S. ∙ Vielfort, K. ∙ Yang, J. ... Lifespan control by redox-dependent recruitment of chaperones to misfolded proteins Cell. 2016; 166 :140-151 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Molin, M. ∙ Yang, J. ∙ Hanzén, S. ...

Cell. 2011; 43 :823-833 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 6 H and 6I). Utilizing these sensitive readouts for oxidant stress, we found that acute V-ATPase inhibition increased the ratio of oxidized to reduced Tsa1 within cells ( Figure 6 G) and generated Tsa1-GFP foci to a similar extent as low-dose hydrogen peroxide ( Figures 6 J and 6K)—levels of hydrogen peroxide that are sufficient to activate the iron regulon. Importantly, Tsa1 foci generated by concA were suppressed by low oxygen, indicating they are oxidant dependent and not caused by other stressors ( Figure S6 H). Thus, V-ATPase inhibition causes intracellular oxidative stress at levels high enough to impact iron homeostasis.
We next tested whether amino acids, in particular cysteine, were required for generating oxidant stress upon V-ATPase inhibition. We found that Tsa1 foci formation was blunted in low-amino-acid medium ( Figure 6 L). Furthermore, the antioxidant gene SOD1 , which is essential for survival of V-ATPase-deficient cells in high-amino-acid medium ( Figure 6 E), became dispensable in low-amino-acid conditions ( Figure 6 M). Finally, treatment of cells with a high concentration of cysteine, which was sufficient to cause iron limitation and impair mitochondrial function in the absence of vacuole stress ( Figures 5 C–5E), generated oxygen-dependent Tsa1 foci and increased the ratio of oxidized to reduced Tsa1 in the absence of V-ATPase impairment ( Figures 6 N, 6O, and S6 I). Thus, elevated non-vacuolar cysteine drives production of oxidants upon V-ATPase inhibition.
Finally, we tested whether iron limitation caused by V-ATPase impairment or cysteine excess could be suppressed by antioxidants or low oxygen. Hampering the antioxidant transcriptional response by deleting SKN7 enhanced activation of the iron regulon in V-ATPase-impaired cells ( Figures S6 J and S6K). Likewise, combined overexpression of the antioxidant genes SOD1 and TSA1 ( Aldini et al., 2018 3. Aldini, G. ∙ Altomare, A. ∙ Baron, G. ... N-Acetylcysteine as an antioxidant and disulphide breaking agent: the reasons why Free Radic. Res. 2018; 52 :751-762 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) in V-ATPase-impaired cells blunted iron starvation and restored growth on non-fermentable carbon sources ( Figures S6 L and 6 P). Finally, activation of the Aft1-dependent iron regulon by V-ATPase inhibition or cysteine treatment was blocked in the absence of oxygen ( Figures 6 Q, S6 M, and 6 R). Low oxygen did not block BPS-induced iron starvation, indicating that the GFP-based Aft1 reporter is functional in anaerobic conditions ( Figure 6 Q). Remarkably, oxygen deprivation also alleviated high cysteine-dependent inhibition of cell growth, indicating that oxygen is required for cysteine toxicity ( Figure 6 S). Importantly, addition of excess iron did not prevent formation of Tsa1 foci or transcriptional activation of the antioxidant gene SRX1 , indicating that ROS generated by V-ATPase impairment acts upstream of iron deprivation and not vice versa ( Figures S6 N and S6O). Collectively, these data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in V-ATPase-deficient cells is caused by elevated non-vacuolar cysteine, through a mechanism that involves ROS-dependent iron limitation. How non-vacuolar cysteine leads to increased cellular ROS still remains to be determined, but our results suggest that cysteine itself may be the culprit, possibly via auto-oxidation, and that the mitochondrial respiratory chain is not the source of ROS in V-ATPase mutants. This latter conclusion is supported by the observation that V-ATPase impairment still caused loss of ISC proteins in cells lacking a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain ( Figure 6 T).
We previously showed that vacuole dysfunction is a major driver of mitochondrial impairment and lifespan limitation during yeast replicative aging ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is defined as the number of times an individual yeast cell asymmetrically divides ( Mortimer and Johnston, 1959 70. Mortimer, R.K. ∙ Johnston, J.R. Life span of individual yeast cells Nature. 1959; 183 :1751-1752 Crossref Scopus (476) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our current observations, we wondered whether cysteine-mediated iron deprivation was responsible for vacuole-induced mitochondrial decline during aging. To test this possibility, we monitored activation of the iron regulon in aged yeast via flow cytometry analysis of the FIT2pr -GFP reporter. We found that the iron regulon was activated in old cells and blunted by addition of excess iron, indicating that iron is limiting in replicatively aged yeast ( Figure 7 A).
To determine whether iron limitation in old cells was caused by altered vacuolar amino acid compartmentation, we monitored activation of the FIT2pr -GFP reporter in cells overexpressing the vacuolar amino acid importer AVT1 , which we previously showed prevented mitochondrial decline in aged cells ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that AVT1 overexpression alleviated iron starvation in old cells ( Figure 7 B). Consistent with this result, iron deprivation was also blocked in cells aged in low-amino-acid medium ( Figure 7 C), and addition of peptone or supplementation with cysteine and threonine restored iron starvation in aged cells ( Figures 7 C and 7D). Thus, non-vacuolar amino acids cause iron limitation during aging.
Finally, we assessed whether mitochondrial dysfunction in old cells was caused by amino-acid-linked iron limitation by examining mitochondrial structure in aged cells subjected to iron supplementation or amino acid limitation. As we previously showed ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ), the tubular mitochondrial network aggregated and fragmented in old cells, which is a general indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction ( Figure 7 E). We found that mitochondrial structure was restored when cells were aged in the presence of excess iron ( Figure 7 E) or in media containing low amino acid levels ( Figure 7 F). Moreover, structural abnormalities were reintroduced by the addition of peptone to low-amino-acid media ( Figure 7 F) or by cysteine supplementation ( Figure 7 G). These results suggest that age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction, which we previously showed was driven by a decline in vacuole activity, results from cysteine-mediated iron limitation.

Section: Discussion

This work outlines a mechanism linking vacuolar and mitochondrial functions with important implications for aging and disease. Although it has been appreciated for almost 30 years that vacuoles and mitochondria are functionally connected ( Ohya et al., 1991 76. Ohya, Y. ∙ Umemoto, N. ∙ Tanida, I. ... Calcium-sensitive cls mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showing a Pet- phenotype are ascribable to defects of vacuolar membrane H(+)-ATPase activity J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 :13971-13977 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), the functional relationship between these two organelles has remained unclear. We now show that the spatial compartmentation of amino acids by vacuoles is required to maintain mitochondrial respiration and prevent age-related mitochondrial decline ( Figure 7 H). In young, healthy cells, amino acids are imported and sequestered in the vacuole in a V-ATPase-dependent manner. As cells age or V-ATPase activity is compromised, import of amino acids into vacuoles is blocked, leading to their cytoplasmic elevation. We show that elevated non-vacuolar amino acids, in particular cysteine, ultimately cause cellular toxicity by disrupting iron homeostasis through an ROS-based mechanism, which impairs iron-dependent mitochondrial respiration.
This discovery provides an important step forward in our understanding of the mechanisms driving age-related mitochondrial decline. We previously demonstrated that age-associated mitochondrial impairment in yeast is caused by vacuole dysfunction ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our current data expand on this model by showing that a breakdown in the spatial compartmentation of amino acids is a key driver of age-related mitochondrial deterioration through ROS-dependent perturbation of iron homeostasis. This model synergizes with previous observations in yeast and other eukaryotes that amino acids and ROS negatively impact organismal lifespan and that antioxidant defense systems, like superoxide dismutase Sod1 and the peroxiredoxin Tsa1, are crucial regulators of longevity ( Muller et al., 2007; Soultoukis and Partridge, 2016; Molin et al., 2011; Schleit et al., 2013 68. Molin, M. ∙ Yang, J. ∙ Hanzén, S. ... Life span extension and H(2)O(2) resistance elicited by caloric restriction require the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mol.

Dietary protein, metabolism, and aging Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85 :5-34 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, our results also provide insight into mechanisms by which ROS and amino acids elicit their negative effects during aging—by converging on iron homeostasis.
The results of this study may also provide insights into mechanisms underlying age-related and metabolic disorders associated with an interdependent decline in lysosome and mitochondrial function, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, lysosomal storage disorders, and diabetes ( Assali et al., 2019; Audano et al., 2018; Colacurcio and Nixon, 2016; de la Mata et al., 2016; Ferguson, 2015; Nixon et al., 2008; Plotegher and Duchen, 2017 6.

Plotegher, N. ∙ Duchen, M.R. Crosstalk between lysosomes and mitochondria in Parkinson’s disease Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 5 :110 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because of the lysosome’s well-known role in protein degradation ( Li and Kane, 2009 60. Li, S.C. ∙ Kane, P.M. The yeast lysosome-like vacuole: endpoint and crossroads Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793 :650-663 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ), altered protein homeostasis is widely considered to be the major driver linking lysosomes and mitochondria in these diseases. Our current results raise the possibility that amino acid toxicity and/or iron limitation may also play important roles in disease development. Interestingly, it is well documented that perturbations in iron metabolism are a hallmark of many age-related disorders ( Ashraf et al., 2018 5. Ashraf, A. ∙ Clark, M. ∙ So, P.W. The aging of iron man Front. Aging Neurosci. 2018; 10 :65 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether iron perturbations are linked to lysosome and mitochondrial decline or amino acid toxicity in these disease states is currently unknown and will be an interesting area of future investigation.
Finally, our work indicates that, despite being essential cellular nutrients, amino acids can become toxic if their intracellular levels are not properly controlled. Although the toxic nature of other cellular nutrients, such as carbohydrates (carbotoxicity; Kroemer et al., 2018 57. Kroemer, G. ∙ López-Otín, C. ∙ Madeo, F. ... Carbotoxicity-noxious effects of carbohydrates Cell. 2018; 175 :605-614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) and lipids (lipotoxicity; Unger and Scherer, 2010 97. Unger, R.H. ∙ Scherer, P.E. Gluttony, sloth and the metabolic syndrome: a roadmap to lipotoxicity Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 21 :345-352 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ), is well appreciated, our understanding of amino acid toxicity and its role in aging and disease is minimal. The strongest support to date that elevated levels of amino acids are toxic for cells stems from the existence of numerous inborn errors of amino acid metabolism ( Aliu et al., 2018 4. Aliu, E. ∙ Kanungo, S. ∙ Arnold, G.L. Amino acid disorders Ann. Transl. Med. 2018; 6 :471 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These disorders are caused by mutations in key metabolic enzymes that impair a cell’s ability to break down certain types of amino acids and their derivatives, which can lead to severe developmental and neurological abnormalities and even death. The extent to which amino acid toxicity functions as a driver of normal aging and age-associated disorders remains to be determined.
We identified cysteine as the problematic amino acid driving iron and mitochondrial deficits in aging. Although the exact mechanism by which cysteine increases ROS and impairs iron homeostasis remains to be determined, it has been long appreciated that high levels of cysteine cause toxicity in many organisms ( Avcilar-Kucukgoze et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2006; Nishiuch et al., 1976; Olney et al., 1990; Ruiz et al., 2017; Takumi and Nonaka, 2016 8.

Bacteriol. 2016; 198 :1384-1392 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Across evolution, different systems have evolved to detoxify cysteine, including transcriptional or post-translational regulation of enzymes that break down cysteine and regulation of transporters responsible for cysteine uptake into cells ( Deshpande et al., 2017; Stipanuk, 2004; Stipanuk et al., 2009; Takumi and Nonaka, 2016 25.

Bacterial cysteine-inducible cysteine resistance systems J. Bacteriol. 2016; 198 :1384-1392 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we identify vacuoles as a key player in cysteine detoxification, likely by limiting cysteine’s cytoplasmic levels through spatial compartmentation. A recent study demonstrated that cysteine, the oxidized form of cysteine, is compartmentalized in mammalian lysosomes in a V-ATPase-dependent manner ( Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017 1. Abu-Remaileh, M. ∙ Wyant, G.A. ∙ Kim, C. ... Lysosomal metabolomics reveals V-ATPase- and mTOR-dependent regulation of amino acid efflux from lysosomes Science. 2017; 358 :807-813 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raises the possibility that lysosomal compartmentation of cysteine may be a fundamental mechanism across organisms to minimize its toxicity. Importantly, cysteine is only one of many amino acids that yeast vacuoles compartmentalize ( Kitamoto et al., 1988 55. Kitamoto, K. ∙ Yoshizawa, K. ∙ Ohsumi, Y. ... Dynamic aspects of vacuolar and cytosolic amino acid pools of Saccharomyces cerevisiae J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170 :2683-2686 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether vacuolar compartmentation of other amino acids also functions to limit their toxicity remains to be determined but is an exciting possibility moving forward.

All yeast strains were derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C (BY background) ( Brachmann et al., 1998 12. Brachmann, C.B. ∙ Davies, A. ∙ Cost, G.J. ... Designer deletion strains derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C: a useful set of strains and plasmids for PCR-mediated gene disruption and other applications Yeast. 1998; 14 :115-132 Crossref Scopus (2206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Petite strains lacking mitochondrial DNA (rho 0 ) were generated by incubating wild-type yeast with ethidium bromide, and isolating clones that lacked mitochondrial DNA by DAPI staining and failed to grow on medium containing glycerol as a carbon source. For PCR-mediated homologous recombination are listed in Table S2 . Deletion strains were created by one-step PCR-mediated gene replacement using the plasmid template pRS306 ( Brachmann et al., 1998 12. Brachmann, C.B. ∙ Davies, A. ∙ Cost, G.J. ... Designer deletion strains derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C: a useful set of strains and plasmids for PCR-mediated gene disruption and other applications Yeast. 1998; 14 :115-132 Crossref Scopus (2206) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the exception of the aft1 Δ FIT2pr -GFP strain (AHY5007), which was created with genomic DNA from the aft1 Δ MATa deletion collection strain (Dharmacon) ( Giaever et al., 2002; Winzeler et al., 1999 40.

Functional characterization of the S. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis Science. 1999; 285 :901-906 Crossref Scopus (2822) PubMed Google Scholar ) as the PCR template. Strains expressing fluorescently tagged Tom70, Tim50, Aft1, and Srm1 from their native loci were created using one-step PCR-mediated C-terminal endogenous epitope tagging with plasmid templates pKT127 (yeGFP) and pKT127-mCherry (mCherry) ( Shaner et al., 2004; Sheff and Thorn, 2004 87.

Optimized cassettes for fluorescent protein tagging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 2004; 21 :661-670 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Aft1 reporter strain was generated by one step-PCR mediated homologous recombination of the reporter cassette (P FIT2 -yeGFP-Term ADH1 -KanMX) into to an empty region on chromosome I with plasmid template p2FG2.0. Recombination Induced Tag Exchange (RITE)-tagged strains were generated using one-step PCR-mediated C-terminal endogenous epitope tagging with plasmid template pLV015 in strain UCC6886, which expresses Cre recombinase ( Verzijlbergen et al., 2010 100. Verzijlbergen, K.F. ∙ Menendez-Benito, V. ∙ van Welsem, T. ... Recombination-induced tag exchange to track old and new proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :64-68 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strains overexpressing AVT1, MRS3, and MRS4 were constructed by transformation of pAG306 GPD-AVT1 chrI, pAG306 GPD-MRS3 chrI, and pAG306 GPD-MRS4 chrI after NotI digestion as previously described ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Correct integrations and gene deletions for all strains were confirmed by colony PCR across the chromosomal insertion site and, where appropriate, microscopy visualizing the correct subcellular localization of the fusion protein. The vph2 Δ ( Figure 1 , screen), gly1 Δ ( Figure 5 ), and tsa1 Δ ( Figure 6 ) strains were from the yeast MATa deletion collection (Dharmacon) ( Giaever et al., 2002; Winzeler et al., 1999 40. Giaever, G. ∙ Chu, A.M. ∙ Ni, L. ... Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome Nature. 2002; 418 :387-391 Crossref Scopus (2774) PubMed Google Scholar 105.

Functional characterization of the S. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis Science. 1999; 285 :901-906 Crossref Scopus (2822) PubMed Google Scholar ), and strains expressing GFP tagged ISC proteins (Lys4, Dre2, Elp3, Tyw1, Grx6, Bio2, Figure 2 I) and Tsa1-GFP ( Figure 6 ) were from the yeast GFP collection (Thermo Fisher) ( Huh et al., 2003 48. Huh, W.-K. ∙ Falvo, J.V. ∙ Gerke, L.C. ... Global analysis of protein localization in budding yeast Nature. 2003; 425 :686-691 Crossref Scopus (2928) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unless otherwise noted, yeast were grown at 30°C in high amino acid, rich medium (YP), which contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 0.005% adenine. Low amino acid, synthetic medium (S), when utilized as indicated in Figure Legends and text, contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.074 g/L each adenine, alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, myo-inositol, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, uracil, valine, 0.369 g/L leucine, 0.007 g/L para-aminobenzoic acid. No amino acid, minimal medium (Min, utilized where indicated) contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids. Glucose (D) was added at 2% w/v and glycerol (G) at 3% w/v. When indicated, peptone was added to synthetic media at 2% w/v, casein amino acids at 2% w/v, and individual amino acids at 1 mM unless otherwise noted. Anaerobic growth was carried out in an Oxoid anaerobic jar (Thermo Fisher) with Oxiod Anaerogen sachets (Thermo Fisher). For experiments in minimal medium and those that require single amino acid additions, yeast strains utilized were rendered prototrophic by transformation with the pHLUM plasmid (Addgene) ( Mülleder et al., 2012 71. Mülleder, M. ∙ Capuano, F. ∙ Pir, P. ... A prototrophic deletion mutant collection for yeast metabolomics and systems biology Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30 :1176-1178 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Prior to each experiment, yeast were grown exponentially overnight to a final density of 1-4 × 10 6 cells/ml. Overnight exponential growth was important to ensure vacuolar and mitochondrial uniformity across the population. Yeast were seeded for experiments such that the density of each culture was 1 × 10 7 cells/ml at the time of harvest to avoid artifacts from differing growth phases. Drug treatments were carried out for the time indicated in the Figure Legends. Unless otherwise indicated, final concentrations of drugs/additions were as follows: concanamycin A (500 nM), ferrous ammonium sulfate (denoted as iron or Fe in figures and text) (2 mM), bathophenanthroline disulphonate (BPS) (250 μM), cycloheximide (50 μg/ml), MG-132 (5 μM), paraquat (5 mM), and hydrogen peroxide (0.6 mM).
PCRs for plasmid construction were carried out with either Phusion (NEB) or KOD (Novagen) polymerases and the oligonucleotides listed in the Table S2 . Cloning strategies were designed in SnapGene. To create pGP564 FET4, the FET4 DNA sequence flanked by 1,000 base pairs to include regulatory elements was amplified from genomic DNA with oligos FET4 +1kb (+) and FET4 −1kb (-) and cloned into the BamHI sites of pGP564 ( Jones et al., 2008 53. Jones, G.M. ∙ Stalker, J. ∙ Humphray, S. ... A systematic library for comprehensive overexpression screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :239-241 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). P2FG2.0, the plasmid template for genomic integration of the FIT2pr -GFP Aft1 reporter, was constructed via Gibson assembly of PCR fragments amplified from pKT127 (GFP), genomic DNA (FIT2 promoter), and pGP564 using oligos pF2G term F1, pF2G term R1, pF2G term F2, pF2G term R2, pF2G term FV, and pF2G term RV. Overexpression plasmids (FET4, GLY1, CYS3) were created by PCR amplification from genomic DNA using oligos FET4 OE attb1 FW GTWY, FET4 OE attb2 RV GTWY, GLY1 gtwy for, GLY1 gtwy rev, CYS3 gtwy for, and CYS3 gtwy rev, followed by BP/LR Clonase Gateway reactions (Thermo Fisher) to move the genes into pAG426 GPD-ccdB ( Alberti et al., 2007 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gitler, A.D. ∙ Lindquist, S. A suite of Gateway cloning vectors for high-throughput genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 2007; 24 :913-919 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Overexpression plasmids ( SOD1 , TSA1 , MRS3 , MRS4 ) were created by LR Clonase gateway reactions using pDONR vectors from the HIP FLEXGene Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORF collection (Harvard Medical School) and pAG425 GPD-ccdb ( SOD1 ), pAG426 GPD-ccdb ( TSA1 ), or pAG306 GPD chrI-ccdb ( MRS3 , MRS4 ) as the destination vectors ( Alberti et al., 2007 2. Alberti, S. ∙ Gitler, A.D. ∙ Lindquist, S. A suite of Gateway cloning vectors for high-throughput genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Yeast. 2007; 24 :913-919 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). A yeast codon optimized hydrogen peroxide sensor, HyPer-3 ( Bilan et al., 2013 11. Bilan, D.S. ∙ Pase, L. ∙ Joosen, L. ... HyPer-3: a genetically encoded H(2)O(2) probe with improved performance for ratiometric and fluorescence lifetime imaging ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8 :535-542 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), and its redox insensitive mutant HyPer-3 C199S, were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) with flanking att B Gateway recombination sites, and cloned into pAG415 GPD-ccdb by BP/LR Clonase Gateway reactions (Thermo Fisher). All DNA constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ).
The high-copy suppressor screen in Figure 1 was performed in a vph2 Δ strain using the Prelich Yeast Genomic Tiling Collection (Dharmacon), which consists of 1,589 plasmids containing sequence-verified genome fragments covering all yeast protein coding genes cloned into high copy plasmid pGP564 ( Jones et al., 2008 53. Jones, G.M. ∙ Stalker, J. ∙ Humphray, S. ... A systematic library for comprehensive overexpression screens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nat. Methods. 2008; 5 :239-241 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). A pooled plasmid library was prepared by culturing arrayed E. coli strains in deep well 96-well plates, followed by culture pooling and plasmid extraction using standard plasmid purification techniques. For screening, vph2 Δ cells were transformed with 1 μg of pooled library and transformants were recovered on SD-leu agar plates for 1 day, followed by replica plating onto YPG agar plates. 1 × 10 4 total colonies were screened. Colonies were counterscreened by colony PCR for VPH2 to remove plasmids that directly complemented the genetic lesion. Thirteen colonies negative for VPH2 were recovered. Plasmids were purified by miniprep of spheroplasted yeast followed by amplification by transformation and isolation from E. coli . In total, plasmid YGPM32b05 containing FET4 was recovered 8 times, and 5 additional plasmids were recovered a single time (YGPM 2i13, 14n23, 21n09, 27n08, and 14n23).
The deletion collection screen was conducted using the Yeast Homozygous Diploid Collection (Dharmacon) ( Giaever et al., 2002; Winzeler et al., 1999 40. Giaever, G. ∙ Chu, A.M. ∙ Ni, L. ... Functional profiling of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome Nature. 2002; 418 :387-391 Crossref Scopus (2774) PubMed Google Scholar 105. Winzeler, E.A. ∙ Shoemaker, D.D. ∙ Astromoff, A. ... Functional characterization of the S. cerevisiae genome by gene deletion and parallel analysis Science. 1999; 285 :901-906 Crossref Scopus (2822) PubMed Google Scholar ). Library strains were grown to saturation in 96-well plate format in YPD for two days. 1 ul of each saturated culture was inoculated into 200 ul YPD, and cultures were grown to log-phase for 4 hours. 2 ul of each log-phase culture were spotted on YPG plates with and without concA (500 nM) and allowed to grow for 4 days before scoring growth.
Five-fold serial dilutions of exponentially growing yeast cells were prepared in water and 3 μl of each dilution was spotted onto the agar medium denoted in each Figure Legend. Total cells plated in each dilution spot were 5,000, 1,000, 200, 40, and 8.
Yeast cells were aged and purified as previously described ( Hughes and Gottschling, 2012 46. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Gottschling, D.E. An early age increase in vacuolar pH limits mitochondrial function and lifespan in yeast Nature. 2012; 492 :261-265 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 2.5 × 10 7 cells from a 15-hour YPAD exponentially growing log-phase culture were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and resuspended in PBS containing 3 mg/ml Sulfa-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) at a final concentration of 2.5 × 10 7 cells/ml. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes, then washed twice in PBS and once in YPAD. Biotinylated cells were then seeded in YPAD at a final density of 1 × 10 4 cells/ml. Cell densities of these cultures never surpassed 1 × 10 7 cells/ml. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice, resuspended at a density of 2 × 10 8 cells/ml in PBS, and incubated for 30 minutes with 50 μl streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MicroMACS, Miltenyi Biotec). After incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, and loaded onto an equilibrated LS MACS column (Miltenyi Biotec). Columns were washed twice and cells eluted in PBS. After elution, cells were pelleted and resuspended in YPD for a one-hour recovery incubation at 30°C before microscopy. Age of purified yeast cells was determined by calcofluor staining of bud scars using Fluorescent Brightener 28 (Sigma Aldrich). Young cell fractions were obtained by collecting the flow through of unlabeled young cells that eluted from the LS MACS column on the first pass.
Images (except where noted below) were acquired with an AxioImager M2 (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an Axiocam 506 monochromatic camera (Carl Zeiss) and a 63x oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Plan Apochromat, NA 1.4), or with an EVOS FL Auto (Thermo Fisher) equipped with an 60x oil-immersion objective (Olympus, Plan Apochromat, NA 1.42). Images in Figure 1 were acquired using an LSM800 (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an Airyscan detector and a 63x oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Plan Apochromat, NA 1.4). Time-lapse imaging was carried out with an LSM880 (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an Airyscan detector (Carl Zeiss), a 63x oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Plan Apochromat, NA 1.4), and an environmental chamber set at 30°C (Carl Zeiss). Images were acquired with ZEN software (Carl Zeiss) or EVOS software (Thermo Fisher) and processed with Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 85. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (13658) PubMed Google Scholar ). Image panels depicting mitochondrial morphology were individually contrast enhanced, while all others where processed identically.
DiOC 6 staining was carried out according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 × 10 6 logarithmically growing cells were washed once in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, plus 5% glucose and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer containing 175 nM DiOC 6 . Cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then washed twice with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, plus 5% glucose. Cells were resuspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, plus 5% glucose for image acquisition.
Z stack images were acquired on an AxioImager M2 and maximum intensity projections processed in Fiji. Cells with tubular, well connected mitochondrial morphologies were scored as reticular. Cells with fragmented, aggregated, or spherical mitochondrial morphologies were scored as aggregated/fragmented. Analysis of mitochondrial morphology in young and old cells in Figure 7 was performed identically.
Yeast were pretreated with conditions indicated in Figure Legends for 45 minutes and then flowed through concanavalin A-coated homemade microscopy chambers made from standard microscope slides, coverslips, and parafilm as previously described ( Fees et al., 2017 33. Fees, C.P. ∙ Estrem, C. ∙ Moore, J.K. High-resolution imaging and analysis of individual astral microtubule dynamics in budding yeast J. Vis. Exp. 2017; 55610 Google Scholar ). Cells were allowed to adhere for 5 minutes at room temperature, after which the medium was replaced with SD + casein amino acids with or without the indicated drug treatment, and chambers were sealed with vaseline. Time-lapse images were acquired on an Airyscan LSM880 equipped with an environmental chamber set at 30°C. Z stacks were obtained every minute for 105 minutes. Automated Airyscan processing was performed in Zen. Movies are maximum intensity projections of Z stacks made in Fiji.
Images of AHY2977 (Aft1-GFP/Srm1-mCherry) yeast treated as described in the text were taken on an EVOS FL Auto, with each image containing > 15 cells. In Fiji, the SRM1 channel was thresholded at identical pixel intensities for all images and these binary images were used to determine the boundaries of each nucleus, which were overlaid on the Aft1-yeGFP channel. The mean Aft1-yeGFP fluorescence intensity of each nucleus was measured and plotted. There was little to no variance in measurements between pictures of the same culture. Representative pictures for image panels were acquired on an AxioImager M2 and processed identically in Fiji.
TSA1-GFP expressing strains treated as described in the text were imaged on an AxioImager M2. Three Z stacks per culture were acquired, each containing > 30 cells per field of view. Maximum intensity projections were thresholded identically and particles counted in Fiji and scored as foci.
Cells were analyzed on a BD Celeste FACSCelesta or a FACSCanto with BD FACSDiva 8.0.1.1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), which are maintained by the University of Utah Flow Cytometry Facility. Cells were differentiated from debris by forward scatter and side scatter. Unless otherwise indicated, the fluorescence of 1 × 10 4 cells was analyzed per sample. The median fluorescence value was used for bar graphs to minimize effects from outliers and non-linearity of photomultiplier tubes. Data analysis was carried out in FlowJo.
DiOC 6 staining was carried out to measure mitochondrial membrane potential as described above in BY4741 yeast. DiOC 6 fluorescence was measured on a FACSCelesta with a 488 nM laser and 530/30 bandpass (FITC) emission filter.
For young cell assays, Aft1 reporter yeast (AHY2993 and derivatives) containing the FIT2pr -GFP transgene were treated as indicated in the text, washed, and resuspended in optically inert SD medium. GFP fluorescence was measured on a FACSCelesta with a 488 nM laser and 530/30 bandpass (FITC) emission filter.
To analyze FIT2pr -GFP expression in aged yeast ( Figure 7 ), 2.5 × 10 4 cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 100 μg/ml Alexa Fluor - 660 NHS-Ester (Thermo Fisher) for 30 minutes at room temperature to fluorescently label the cell wall of young cells. Labeled yeast were inoculated into 100 mL of the indicated medium, and grown for 12-16 hours. Cells pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed 1X in SD medium, resuspended at a concentration of 5.0 × 10 10 cells/ml in SD, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Old cells, which retain their cell wall fluorescent label throughout their lifespan, were differentiated from newborn young cells by AlexaFluor 660 fluorescence on a FACSCelesta using a 640 nM laser and a 670/30 bandpass (APC) emission filter. FIT2pr -GFP Aft1 reporter activity was determined by GFP fluorescence with a 488 nM laser and 530/30 bandpass (FITC) emission filter. Control experiments were run to ensure there was no bleed-through between the Aft1 GFP reporter and the AlexaFluor 660 and that old cells were not autofluorescent. The gate for AlexaFluor 660 positive cells was set to mirror the expected percentage of old cells in the population after aging (0.02%). 5 × 10 3 old cells were analyzed per experiment. Estimated ages of old cells were obtained by counting bud scars of aged yeast obtained from a parallel biotinylated culture as described above in the isolation of aged yeast section.
BY4741 transformed with HyPer-3 pAG415 GPD or HyPer-3 C199S pAG415 GPD were treated as described in the text, and ratiometric changes in HyPer-3 were measured by flow cytometry on a FACSCelesta. HyPer-3 in the reduced state was measured with a 405 nm laser and a 525/50 bandpass (BV510) filter, while oxidized HyPer-3 was measured with a 488 nm laser and a 530/30 bandpass (FITC) filter. The HyPer-3 C199S mutant was treated and measured in parallel to control for changes in cytoplasmic pH. The ratio of oxidized/reduced HyPer-3 was calculated in FlowJo.
Crude yeast mitochondria fractions were prepared from 1 × 10 10 cells as previously described ( Van Vranken et al., 2016 99. Van Vranken, J.G. ∙ Jeong, M.Y. ∙ Wei, P. ... The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) coordinates mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis with iron sulfur cluster biogenesis eLife. 2016; 5 :e17828 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yeast were grown and treated as described in the text, harvested, washed with ddH 2 0, and incubated in TD buffer (100 mM Tris-SO4, pH 9.4 and 100 mM DTT) for 15 minutes at 30°C. Yeast were spheroplasted by incubation in SP buffer (1.2 M sorbitol and 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) supplemented with lyticase (2 mg/g of cell pellet) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at 30°C. All subsequent steps were carried out on ice or at 4°C. Spheroplasts were washed once and homogenized in ice-cold SH buffer (1.2 M sorbitol, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM PMSF) with 20 strokes of a dounce homogenizer. The crude mitochondrial fraction was obtained by differential centrifugation. In short, cell debris was removed by two 3,000xg 5-minute centrifugations, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged twice at 10,000xg for 10 minutes to pellet mitochondria. Mitochondrial protein content was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher).
For ICP-MS measurements, mitochondria were further purified on a continuous Nycodenz (Nycodenz = Histodenz (Sigma-Aldrich)) gradient. Gradients were made by layering 2.1 mL of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% Nycodenz which were allowed to diffuse by incubation at room temperature for 3-4 hours. Crude mitochondria were loaded on top of the chilled gradient and separated by centrifugation at 100,000xg for 1 hour. Intact purified mitochondria were recovered from a brown band at around 16% Nycodenz concentration.
Western blotting of whole-cell yeast extracts was carried out as described previously ( Hughes et al., 2016 47. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Hughes, C.E. ∙ Henderson, K.A. ... Selective sorting and destruction of mitochondrial membrane proteins in aged yeast eLife. 2016; 5 :e13943 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). 2 × 10 7 yeast cells were harvested, washed in ddH 2 0, and incubated in NaOH (0.1 M) for 5 minutes. Cells were pelleted by a 10-minute, 20,000xg spin at 4°C and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitors) and incubated for 10 minutes. Extracts were prepared for electorphoresis by incubating in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.004% bromophenol blue, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 minutes at 42°C, and extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 x g for 5 minutes. Clarified extracts were resolved on Bolt 4%–12% Bis-Tris Plus Gels with MES/SDS buffer (Thermo Fisher) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes with a Pierce Power Station (Thermo Fisher). Membranes were blocked and probed in blocking buffer (TBS - Tris buffered saline (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), 0.05% Tween20, 5% non-fat dry milk) using the primary antibodies listed in the STAR table and HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Antibodies were visualized with Supersignal Enhanced Chemiluminescence Solution (dura, pico, or femto) (Thermo Fisher) and film or a Chemidoc MP System (BioRad).
Blue-Native PAGE was carried out as previously described ( Van Vranken et al., 2016 99. Van Vranken, J.G. ∙ Jeong, M.Y. ∙ Wei, P. ... The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACP) coordinates mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis with iron sulfur cluster biogenesis eLife. 2016; 5 :e17828 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Crude mitochondria were resuspended in 1x lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) containing 1% digitonin and 1x cOmplete protease inhibitors and incubated for 15 minutes on ice. Mitochondrial lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000xg for 20 minutes, resolved on NativePAGE 4%–16% Bis-Tris Gels (Thermo Fisher), transferred to PVDF membranes with a Criterion Blotter (BioRad), and immunoblotted with TBS + 5% BSA as the blocking buffer.
Tag switching (See Figure S2 I schematic) of exponentially growing RITE-tagged yeast strains was induced with β-estradiol (1 μM) (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously ( Hughes et al., 2016; Verzijlbergen et al., 2010 47. Hughes, A.L. ∙ Hughes, C.E. ∙ Henderson, K.A. ... Selective sorting and destruction of mitochondrial membrane proteins in aged yeast eLife. 2016; 5 :e13943 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 100. Verzijlbergen, K.F. ∙ Menendez-Benito, V. ∙ van Welsem, T. ... Recombination-induced tag exchange to track old and new proteins Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :64-68 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tag switching was monitored by the presence of RFP fluorescence on an EVOS FL Auto. Cells were treated with or without concA 3 hours after 100% of cells displayed RFP fluorescence to allow for GFP tagged transcripts to be fully turned over. Equal volumes of culture were harvested at each time point, and the stability of GFP tagged proteins was analyzed by western blot. The cell density never surpassed 1 × 10 7 cells/ml during treatment.
Monitoring of Tsa1 oxidation state was adapted from MacDiarmid et al. (2013) 65. MacDiarmid, C.W. ∙ Taggart, J. ∙ Kerdsomboon, K. ... Peroxiredoxin chaperone activity is critical for protein homeostasis in zinc-deficient yeast J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :31313-31327 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar . 6 × 10 7 exponentially growing yeast were harvested, washed in ddH 2 0, washed in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000xg and 4°C. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and disrupted by micro-bead beating. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000xg and 4°C, and the pellet washed twice with ice cold acetone. The pellet was dried en vacuo , then resuspended in buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitors) with and without 2 mM PEG-maleimide. Samples treated with PEG-maleimide were incubated in the dark at 37°C for 12 hours, then prepared for western blotting by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min at 95°C.
Protein extracts for measurement of Tsa1-SO 3 H were prepared as in Hanzén et al. (2016) 41. Hanzén, S. ∙ Vielfort, K. ∙ Yang, J. ... Lifespan control by redox-dependent recruitment of chaperones to misfolded proteins Cell. 2016; 166 :140-151 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar and Molin et al. (2011) 68. Molin, M. ∙ Yang, J. ∙ Hanzén, S. ... Life span extension and H(2)O(2) resistance elicited by caloric restriction require the peroxiredoxin Tsa1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mol. Cell. 2011; 43 :823-833 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar . 6 × 10 7 yeast were disrupted by micro-bead beating in 160 μl ice cold water with 1x cOmplete protease inhibitors. 20 μl of Buffer I (3% SDS, 50% β-mercaptoethanol, 280 mM Tris-HCl, 220 mM Tris) was added and the samples boiled for 5 min at 95°C.
Samples were placed on ice, 20 μl Buffer II (240 mM Tris-HCl, 475 mM Tris, 50 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg/ml DNase I) was added, and samples were incubated on ice for 15 min. After clearing the extracts by centrifugation (20,000xg for 15 min at 4°C), supernatants were prepared for western blotting by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min at 95°C. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes with a Criterion Blotter (BioRad) and probed with a Tsa1 Cys48-SO 3 H specific antibody (Abcam).
Protein extracts were prepared as for Tsa1 hyperoxidation measurements, and carbonyl groups were derivatized and detected using the OxyBlot Protein Oxidation Detection Kit (Millipore Sigma) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Yeast were treated as indicated in the text and harvested at a density of 1 × 10 7 , collected by centrifugation, and brought up at a density of 2 × 10 7 in fresh YPD without any drug or amino acid supplement. Yeast were allowed to recover for 15 min at 30°C, then oxygen consumption was measured using a Clark-Type oxygen electrode. The slope of the linear region of the oxygen consumption recording, normalized to cell density, was used as the oxygen consumption rate.
To quantify the expression of iron regulon genes, 2-4 × 10 7 yeast were lysed via micro-bead beating, and total RNA enriched using RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Contaminating DNA was removed by on-column RNase-free DNase (QIAGEN) treatment. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using SuperScript IV First Strand Synthesis (Thermo Fisher) and the Oligo d(T) 20 primer. Quantification of gene expression was carried out with KAPA SYBR FAST ROX Low master mix (Kapa Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems Quantstudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system, 384-well. Primerquest (Integrated DNA Technologies, http://www.idtdna.com/site/account/login?returnurl=%2FPrimerquest ) was used to design primers, and three primer pairs per target were compared for melt curve analysis, variance, and linearity across a 1 × 10 4 -fold dilution. Actin ( ACT1 ) was used for normalization and relative gene expression was determined by the 2 −ΔΔCt method as compared to wild-type , DMSO treated yeast. Primers pairs are listed in Table S2 .
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was conducted with the High-Throughput Genomics and Bioinformatic Analysis Shared Resource at Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. For RNA sequencing, RNA was purified from wild-type BY4741 yeast as described above in the quantitative PCR section. Total RNA samples (100-500 ng) were hybridized with Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit Yeast (Illumina MRZY1306) to substantially deplete rRNA from the samples. Stranded RNA sequencing libraries were prepared as using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit. Purified libraries were qualified on an Agilent Technologies 2200 TapeStation using a D1000 ScreenTape assay. The molarity of adaptor-modified molecules was defined by quantitative PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Kapa Library Quant Kit. Individual libraries were normalized to 10 nM and equal volumes were pooled in preparation for Illumina sequence analysis.
Sequencing libraries (25 pM) were chemically denatured and applied to an Illumina HiSeq v4 single read flow cell using an Illumina cBot. Hybridized molecules were clonally amplified and annealed to sequencing primers with reagents from an Illumina HiSeq SR Cluster Kit v4-cBot (GD-401-4001). Following the transfer of the flowcell to an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (HCSv2.2.38 and RTA v1.18.61), a 50-cycle single-read sequence run was performed using HiSeq SBS Kit v4 sequencing reagents (FC-401-4002).
Sequence reads were trimmed and aligned using STAR (v2.5.2b) ( Dobin et al., 2013 30. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (6845) PubMed Google Scholar ), with alignIntronMax set to 2000, twopassMode set to Basic, and clip3pAdapterSeq set to AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA and AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT. Aligned reads were then counted using featurecounts (v1.5.1) ( Liao et al., 2014 61. Liao, Y. ∙ Smyth, G.K. ∙ Shi, W. featureCounts: an efficient general purpose program for assigning sequence reads to genomic features Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :923-930 Crossref Scopus (2700) PubMed Google Scholar ), setting -s equal to 2 for a reversely stranded library. Reads were processed using S. cerevisiae R64-1-1 Ensembl release 90.
Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.20.0) ( Love et al., 2014 64. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (10222) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes differentially expressed at 6 hr concA treatment (FDR < 0.01, |log 2 FoldChange| > 1) were analyzed using Panther (v14.1) and the Gene Ontology Database (Release 2019-07-03), performed 18 Apr 2019. GO terms were selected using a Fisher’s Exact test (FDR < 0.01) and a selection criterion that required at least 10% of total GO term gene members to be represented in the differential expression analysis.
RNA-seq read counts were RPKM normalized. Heatmaps were generated by gene-standardizing the RPKM values (mean = 0, stdev = 1) and plotting using XPRESSplot v0.0.4-beta ( https://doi.org/10.1101/704320 Berg et al., 2019 9. Berg, J.A. ∙ Belyeu, J.R. ∙ Morgan, J.T. ... XPRESSyourself: Enhancing, Standardizing, and Automating Ribosome Profiling Computational Analyses Yields Improved Insight into Data bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Google Scholar ) and Matplotlib ( Hunter, 2007 49. Hunter, J.D. Matplotlib: a 2D graphics environment Comput. Sci. Eng. 2007; 9 :90-95 Crossref Scopus (4142) Google Scholar ). Scripts used to perform these analyses can be found at https://github.com/j-berg/hughes_rnaseq_2019 .
Total iron analysis was performed at the Iron and Heme Core Facility at the University of Utah. Yeast were harvested and washed twice in metal-free H 2 0. A 5:1 mixture of nitric acid (OPTIMA Grade, 70%, Fisher Scientific) and ultrapure hydrogen peroxide (ULTREX II, 30%, Fisher Scientific) was added to cell pellets. This mixture was allowed to digest overnight, heated until dry, and resuspended in 2% nitric acid for analysis using an Agilent 7900 ICP-MS. Calibration standard solutions for determination of Fe were prepared from Agilent multi-element calibration standard-2A. An Agilent Environmental Calibration Standard was used as an independent control. Buffer-only control digestions were used to measure background. Metal readings were normalized to lysate protein concentration determined using a BCA assay.
Metabolite extraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis were carried out by the University of Utah Metabolomics Core Facility. Yeast pellets were extracted following a previously described method with slight modifications ( Canelas et al., 2009 15. Canelas, A.B. ∙ ten Pierick, A. ∙ Ras, C. ... Quantitative evaluation of intracellular metabolite extraction techniques for yeast metabolomics Anal. Chem. 2009; 81 :7379-7389 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). 5 mL of boiling 75% EtOH (aq) was added to each cell pellet, samples were then vortexed and incubated at 90°C for five minutes. The EtOH solution contained a mixture of U-13C/U-15N stable isotope labeled amino acids (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 5 ug/sample, and d4-succinate added at 1 ug/sample. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000xg for three minutes. The supernatant was removed to new tubes and dried en vacuo .
All GC-MS analysis was performed with an Agilent 7200 GC-MS QTOF and an Agilent 7693A automatic liquid sampler. Dried samples were suspended in 40 μL of a 40 mg/mL O-methoxylamine hydrochloride (MOX) (MP Biomedicals) in dry pyridine (EMD Millipore) and incubated for one hour at 37°C in a sand bath. 13 μL of this solution was added to auto sampler vials. 60 μL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoracetamide (MSTFA with 1%TMCS) (Thermo Fisher) was added automatically via the auto sampler and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. After incubation, samples were vortexed and 1 μL of the prepared sample was injected into the gas chromatograph inlet in the split mode with the inlet temperature held at 250°C. A 50:1 split ratio was used for analysis. For highly abundant metabolites that saturated at the 50:1 split, a split ratio of 100:1 was used for analysis. The gas chromatograph had an initial temperature of 60°C for one minute followed by a 10°C/min ramp to 325°C and a hold time of 2 minutes. A 30-m Agilent Zorbax DB-5MS with 10 m Duraguard capillary column was employed for chromatographic separation. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 1 mL/min.
Data was collected using MassHunter software (Agilent). Metabolites were identified and their peak area was recorded using MassHunter Quant. Metabolite identity was established using a combination of an in-house metabolite library developed using pure purchased standards, the NIST library and the Fiehn Library. Values for each metabolite were normalized to the total ion count and the internal standard in each sample and are displayed as fold change to DMSO.
A range of cysteine concentrations was incubated in buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4, 400 nM CuSO 4 ) at 37°C for 1 hour. After incubation, hydrogen peroxide levels were determined by the oxidation of Amplex Red to resorufin using an Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). Resorufin was measured by absorbance at 560 nm, and hydrogen peroxide concentrations determined by comparing to a standard curve measured in parallel.
The number of replicates, what n represents, precision measurements, and meaning of error bars are indicated in Figure Legends. In general, bar graphs are mean of three biological replicates and error bars represent standard deviation. In experiments with data depicted from a single biological replicate, the experiment was repeated with the same results.
