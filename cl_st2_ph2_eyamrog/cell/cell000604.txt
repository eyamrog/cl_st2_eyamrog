Title: PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibition prevents neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease


Abstract: Summary

Parthanatos-associated apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclease (PAAN), also known as macrophage migration inhibitor factor (MIF), is a member of the PD-D/E(X)K nucleases that acts as a final executioner in parthanatos. PAAN’s role in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and whether it is amenable to chemical inhibition is not known. Here, we show that neurodegeneration induced by pathologic α-synuclein (α-syn) occurs via PAAN/MIF nuclease activity. Genetic depletion of PAAN/MIF and a mutant lacking nuclease activity prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral deficits in the α-syn preformed fibril (PFF) mouse model of sporadic PD. Compound screening led to the identification of PAANIB-1, a brain-penetrant PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitor that prevents neurodegeneration induced by α-syn PFF, AAV-α-syn overexpression, or MPTP intoxication in vivo . Our findings could have broad relevance in human pathologies where parthanatos plays a role in the development of cell death inhibitors targeting the druggable PAAN/MIF nuclease.

Section: Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder in which intracellular α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates into higher molecular pathologic structures that ultimately lead to neurodegeneration ( Henderson et al., 2019 22. Henderson, M.X. ∙ Trojanowski, J.Q. ∙ Lee, V.M. α-Synuclein pathology in Parkinson’s disease and related α-synucleinopathies Neurosci. Lett. 2019; 709 :134316 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pathologic α-syn-mediated neurodegeneration in PD occurs through parthanatos-dependent cell death through activation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) ( Kam et al., 2018 24. Kam, T.I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ...

Poly (ADP-ribose) interacts with phosphorylated α-synuclein in post mortem PD samples Front. Aging Neurosci. 2021; 13 :704041 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the emerging role of PAR signaling in the pathogenesis of PD, chronic inhibition of PARP-1 as a disease-modifying therapy in PD may be perilous. PARP inhibitors would interfere with the myriad physiologic functions of PARP, which may have unintended consequences in a chronic disease ( Berger et al., 2018 6. Berger, N.A. ∙ Besson, V.C. ∙ Boulares, A.H. ... Opportunities for the repurposing of PARP inhibitors for the therapy of non-oncological diseases Br. J. Pharmacol. 2018; 175 :192-222 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, most if not all PARP inhibitors interfere with DNA repair by trapping PARP on DNA strand breaks ( Zandarashvili et al., 2020 60. Zandarashvili, L. ∙ Langelier, M.F. ∙ Velagapudi, U.K. ... Structural basis for allosteric PARP-1 retention on DNA breaks Science. 2020; 368 :eaax6367 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ), which provides synthetic lethality in the treatment of certain cancers ( Lord and Ashworth, 2017 31. Lord, C.J. ∙ Ashworth, A. PARP inhibitors: synthetic lethality in the clinic Science. 2017; 355 :1152-1158 Crossref Scopus (1794) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interference with DNA repair could also create unforeseen toxicity in chronic neurodegenerative diseases.
The parthanatos-associated apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclease (PAAN) also known as macrophage migration inhibitor factor (MIF) was shown to be a major mediator of parthanatic cell death in acute disorders via its nuclease activity ( Wang et al., 2016 53.

Commun. 2020; 523 :719-725 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). MIF is also known to have tautomerase activity and to act as an atypical extracellular cytokine ( Bloom et al., 2016 7. Bloom, J. ∙ Sun, S. ∙ Al-Abed, Y. MIF, a controversial cytokine: a review of structural features, challenges, and opportunities for drug development Expert Opin. Ther.

The identification of the enzymatic function for MIF as a member of the large PD-D/E(X)K nuclease superfamily brought to the forefront a role for MIF in cell death, in that its nuclease activity is responsible for the large-scale DNA fragmentation that occurs in parthanatos ( Park et al., 2020 40.

Zhou, Y. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Tao, S. ... Parthanatos and its associated components: promising therapeutic targets for cancer Pharmacol. Res. 2021; 163 :105299 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and/or its tautomerase activity plays a role in a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, such as PD is not known. Moreover, no PAAN/MIF nuclease-specific inhibitors exist. Here, we identify a PAAN/MIF inhibitor, PAANIB-1 and evaluated whether genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity prevents neurodegeneration in mouse models of PD.

Section: Results

To determine whether PAAN/MIF is essential for pathologic α-syn induced degeneration, recombinant α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs) were stereotaxically injected into the striatum of wild type (WT) and PAAN/MIF knockout (KO) mice ( Bozza et al., 1999 8. Bozza, M. ∙ Satoskar, A.R. ∙ Lin, G. ... Targeted disruption of migration inhibitory factor gene reveals its critical role in sepsis J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189 :341-346 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ). As previously described ( Luk et al., 2012 32. Luk, K.C. ∙ Kehm, V. ∙ Carroll, J. ... Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiates Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in nontransgenic mice Science. 2012; 338 :949-953 Crossref Scopus (1851) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mao et al., 2016 34. Mao, X. ∙ Ou, M.T. ∙ Karuppagounder, S.S. ... Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3 Science. 2016; 353 :aah3374 Crossref Scopus (492) PubMed Google Scholar ), WT mice showed an approximate 50% loss of dopamine (DA) neurons 6 months after a single intrastriatal injection of α-syn PFF ( Figures 1 A and 1B). In contrast, injection of α-syn PFF failed to induce DA cell loss in PAAN/MIF KO mice ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels were also reduced in WT mice in response to α-syn PFF as determined by western blot analysis, while the reduction in TH and DAT levels is prevented in PAAN/MIF-deficient mice ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Accompanying the loss of DA neurons was a reduction in striatal DA and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in α-syn PFF-injected WT mice, but not in PAAN/MIF KO mice ( Figures 1 C and 1D). Striatal α-syn PFF significantly increased the DA turnover in WT mice, whereas these effects were attenuated in PAAN/MIF KO mice ( Figures S1 C and S1D). The absence of PAAN/MIF prevented the α-syn PFF-induced behavioral deficits on the hindlimb clasping test ( Figure S1 E), pole test ( Figure 1 E), and grip strength test ( Figure 1 F). Taken together, these results indicate that the striatal α-syn PFF-induced loss of DA neurons is dependent on PAAN/MIF.
PAAN/MIF was originally identified as an atypical secreted cytokine ( Bucala, 1996 9. Bucala, R. MIF rediscovered: cytokine, pituitary hormone, and glucocorticoid-induced regulator of the immune response FASEB J. 1996; 10 :1607-1613 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ) that exhibits tautomerase activity that accounts for some but not all of MIF’s pleiotropic actions ( Bloom et al., 2016 7. Bloom, J. ∙ Sun, S. ∙ Al-Abed, Y. MIF, a controversial cytokine: a review of structural features, challenges, and opportunities for drug development Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2016; 20 :1463-1475 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fingerle-Rowson et al., 2009 17. Fingerle-Rowson, G. ∙ Kaleswarapu, D.R. ∙ Schlander, C. ...

Med. 1996; 2 :143-149 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). When PAAN/MIF is recruited to the nucleus under stress conditions, it acquires a gain of function activity as a nuclease. Its nuclease activity is distinct from its actions as a cytokine and tautomerase ( Park et al., 2020 40. Park, H. ∙ Kam, T.I. ∙ Dawson, T.M. ... Poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR)-dependent cell death in neurodegenerative diseases Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2020; 353 :1-29 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). Accordingly, the relative contribution of PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity versus MIF’s tautomerase activity in pathologic α-syn-induced degeneration was evaluated. Mice lacking PAAN/MIF nuclease activity (MIF E22Q) were resistant to α-syn PFF-induced neurodegeneration, while mice lacking MIF’s tautomerase activity (MIF P2G) ( Fingerle-Rowson et al., 2009 17. Fingerle-Rowson, G. ∙ Kaleswarapu, D.R. ∙ Schlander, C. ... A tautomerase-null macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) gene knock-in mouse model reveals that protein interactions and not enzymatic activity mediate MIF-dependent growth regulation Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29 :1922-1932 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ) were as sensitive as WT mice in α-syn PFF-induced neurodegeneration as assessed by stereologic counting of TH immunoreactivity ( Figures 1 G and 1H) and Nissl staining ( Figures 1 G and S1 F), immunoblot analysis of TH levels ( Figures S1 G and S1H), HPLC assessment of DA ( Figure 1 I), and its metabolite, DOPAC levels ( Figure S1 I), DA turnover ( Figures S1 J and S1K) and the accompanying behavioral deficits including pole test ( Figure 1 J) and grip strength test ( Figure 1 K). Consistent with previous reports that indicate that loss of SNpc DA neurons occurs 6 months after α-syn PFF injection, but not at earlier time point ( Kam et al., 2018 24. Kam, T.I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease Science. 2018; 362 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ; Luk et al., 2012 32. Luk, K.C. ∙ Kehm, V. ∙ Carroll, J. ... Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiates Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in nontransgenic mice Science. 2012; 338 :949-953 Crossref Scopus (1851) PubMed Google Scholar ), pulse gel electrophoresis indicates that genomic DNA cleavage primarily coincides with the loss of DA neurons since there is no genomic DNA cleavage 1 and 3 months after α-syn PFF injection ( Figure S1 L). α-Syn PFF induces genomic DNA cleavage in the substantia nigra of WT and MIF P2G mice 6 months after the α-syn PFF injection, while it is significantly attenuated in PAAN/MIF E22Q mice ( Figures 1 L and 1M). Viral transgenesis of adeno-associated viral (AAV) expression of PAAN/MIF WT, PAAN/MIF E22Q, and MIF P2G in MIF KO mice further confirmed that PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity, but not MIF’s tautomerase activity, is required for α-syn PFF-induced neurodegeneration in vivo ( Figures S2 A–S2H).
To further evaluate the PAAN/MIF nuclease versus it tautomerase activity in α-syn PFF toxicity, primary neuronal cultures were utilized as previously described ( Kam et al., 2018 24. Kam, T.I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease Science. 2018; 362 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mao et al., 2016 34. Mao, X. ∙ Ou, M.T. ∙ Karuppagounder, S.S. ... Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3 Science. 2016; 353 :aah3374 Crossref Scopus (492) PubMed Google Scholar ). α-Syn PFF induced nuclear translocation of PAAN/MIF and AIF that was attenuated by the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, ABT-888 ( Figure 2 A). In addition, treatment of AP5 or 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX), selective NMDA or AMPA receptor antagonists, respectively, inhibited α-syn PFF-induced PARP activation ( Figure S3 A) and thereby attenuated the nuclear translocation of AIF and MIF ( Figure S3 B). These results are consistent with prior reports suggesting that glutamate-related neuronal activity regulates cell-to-cell propagation of pathologic α-syn ( Ueda et al., 2021 49. Ueda, J. ∙ Uemura, N. ∙ Sawamura, M. ... Perampanel inhibits α-synuclein transmission in Parkinson’s disease models Mov. Disord. 2021; 36 :1554-1564 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamada and Iwatsubo, 2018 56. Yamada, K. ∙ Iwatsubo, T. Extracellular α-synuclein levels are regulated by neuronal activity Mol. Neurodegener. 2018; 13 :9 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). Co-immunoprecipitation indicates that AIF and PAAN/MIF interact following α-syn PFF administration ( Figure 2 B) and they co-localize in the nucleus ( Figure 2 C). There was no difference in nuclear translocation of PAAN/MIF WT, E22Q, and MIF P2G in response to α-syn PFF ( Figure S3 C). Knockout of PAAN/MIF prevented α-syn PFF-induced cleavage of genomic DNA ( Figure 2 D), cell death ( Figures 2 E and 2F), and accumulation of insoluble phosphorylation of α-syn on Serine-129, a marker of pathologic α-syn ( Fujiwara et al., 2002 19. Fujiwara, H. ∙ Hasegawa, M. ∙ Dohmae, N. ... α-Synuclein is phosphorylated in synucleinopathy lesions Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4 :160-164 Crossref Scopus (1644) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S3 D and S3E) in neuronal cultures. Cleavage of genomic DNA and cell death in response to α-syn PFF were restored by lentiviral expression of PAAN/MIF WT and MIF P2G in MIF KO neuronal cultures but were still attenuated in KO neurons transduced with PAAN/MIF E22Q and the AIF binding deficient mutant PAAN/MIF E22A ( Figures 2 D–2F). Similar results were obtained in PAAN/MIF E22Q and MIF P2G knock in neuronal cultures ( Figures 2 G and 2H). These data indicate that PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity and its binding to AIF is required for cleavage of genomic DNA and cell death induced by α-syn PFF. MIF also acts as an extracellular cytokine that counter regulates the glucocorticoid inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF-α elevation ( Calandra et al., 1995 10. Calandra, T. ∙ Bernhagen, J. ∙ Metz, C.N. ... MIF as a glucocorticoid-induced modulator of cytokine production Nature. 1995; 377 :68-71 Crossref Scopus (1077) PubMed Google Scholar ; Flaster et al., 2007 18. Flaster, H. ∙ Bernhagen, J. ∙ Calandra, T. ... The macrophage migration inhibitory factor-glucocorticoid dyad: regulation of inflammation and immunity Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21 :1267-1280 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roger et al., 2005 43. Roger, T. ∙ Chanson, A.L. ∙ Knaup-Reymond, M. ... Macrophage migration inhibitory factor promotes innate immune responses by suppressing glucocorticoid-induced expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35 :3405-3413 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). PAAN/MIF WT, PAAN/MIF E22Q, and MIF P2G are equally effective in preventing dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, inhibition of TNF-α production ( Figure S3 F). α-Syn PFF induced extracellular secretion is equivalent between PAAN/MIF WT, PAAN/MIF E22Q, and MIF P2G ( Figure S3 G). Thus, PAAM/MIF E22Q or MIF P2G do not seem to have a substantial effect on MIF’s ability to act as a cytokine. D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT or MIF-2), a member of the MIF protein superfamily that functions as a MIF-like cytokine but does not have an E22 residue that is critical for PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity ( Merk et al., 2011 36. Merk, M. ∙ Zierow, S. ∙ Leng, L. ... The D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) gene product is a cytokine and functional homolog of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :E577-E585 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not have nuclease activity ( Figure S3 H). Together, these results strongly suggest that the nuclease, but not the tautomerase or cytokine, activity of PAAN/MIF is required for α-syn PFF-induced neurodegeneration.
Since there are no PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitors, we developed an assay to screen for PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitors. Single-stranded PAAN/MIF nuclease DNA substrate ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ) was amine modified on the 5′ end and immobilized on a plate. Hybridization with a biotin-labeled complementary oligonucleotide followed by addition of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP) leads to retention of HRP on the surface within each well in the presence of intact PAAN/MIF nuclease DNA substrate, which can be quantitatively detected through colorimetric change at 450 nm using the HRP substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). In the presence of WT PAAN/MIF, there is reduced signal, indicative of cleavage of the PAAN/MIF nuclease substrate, while the signal is not attenuated without recombinant PAAN/MIF ( Figures 3 A and S4 A). The rapamycin-inspired macrocycle library, known as the rapafucins, bearing a conserved FK506-binding protein (FKBP)-binding domain, and a variable tetrapeptide effector domain was recently developed and shown to possess enhanced target specificity and pharmacological activity ( Guo et al., 2019b 21. Guo, Z. ∙ Hong, S.Y. ∙ Wang, J. ... Rapamycin-inspired macrocycles with new target specificity Nat. Chem. 2019; 11 :254-263 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the rapafucin library containing 45,000 macrocyclic compounds in 3,000 pools of 15 compounds was screened using this assay. The Z′ factors were within the 0.5–1 range, indicating that minimal variations within days and between plates were observed ( Figure S4 B). Several pools were identified that inhibit PAAN/MIF nuclease activity from the primary screen ( Figure 3 B). Pools that inhibited PAAN/MIF nuclease in vitro by at least 60% were rescreened for both inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and prevention of parthanatic cell death induced by 50-μM N -Methyl- N ′-nitro- N -nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in SH-SY5Y cells assessed 24 h later. Nine pools of compounds were identified that both inhibit PAAN/MIF cleavage of the substrate and protect against MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death by greater than 70% ( Figure 3 C). The 9 pools were narrowed to 6 pools since only 6 of the pools exhibited a dose response for prevention of MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death. Next, the 90 individual compounds in the 6 pools were synthesized and further assessed for inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death. These compounds showed a positive correlation between inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and parthanatic cell death ( Figure 3 D). Among them 12 individual compounds were identified that block PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death by greater than 60% ( Figure 3 D; Table S1 ). Dose dependency (0.1–1.0 μM) were assessed for those 12 compounds (C1–C12) against MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death ( Figure 3 E) and inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity against the PAAN/MIF substrates ( Figure 3 F). C7, C8, C11, and C12 were selected for further study because they prominently blocked both MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death and PAAN/MIF nuclease activity.
C7, C8, C11, and C12 did not affect MNNG-induced PARP activation, indicating that they do not have cross-reactivity to PARP inhibition to prevent cell death ( Figure S4 C). Neither did they inhibit MIF’s oxidoreductase activity ( Figure S4 D) nor its tautomerase activity ( Figure S4 E). In addition, C7, C8, C11, C12, and the PARP inhibitor ABT-888 did not inhibit staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptotic cell death, while a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD prevented STS-induced cell death ( Figure S4 F). TNF-α and Z-VAD-induced necroptosis was also not prevented by C7, C8, C11, C12, and ABT-888, while Nec-1 prevented necroptosis ( Figure S4 G). C7, C8, C11, and C12 did not inhibit the nuclease activity of the structurally related nucleases, Eco RI, Eco RV, and ExoIII ( Figure S4 H). Taken together, C7, C8, C11, and C12 selectively prevent parthanatos via inhibiting PAAN/MIF nuclease activity. C7, C8, and C12 attenuated α-syn PFF-induced cell death in mouse cortical neurons, while C11 had no effect ( Figure S4 I). Both C7 and C11 exhibited basal toxicity without treatment of α-syn PFF when applied to primary cortical neurons ( Figure S4 I) and thus were not advanced for further study. Both C8 and C12 protected against cell death similar to ABT-888 ( Figure 3 G) and prevented genomic DNA cleavage ( Figure 3 H) in human cortical neurons treated with human α-syn PFF. C8 and C12 were further evaluated with regards to their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and only C8 crossed the BBB after oral gavage ( Figure 4 E).
Although C8 can cross the BBB, the achievable concentration (<500 nM) ( Figure 4 E) is below that required for inhibition of MNNG and α-syn PFF-induced cell death ( Figures 3 E and 3G). To optimize the potency of C8 and increase its central nervous system (CNS) penetration, we designed and synthesized derivatives of C8 by modifying the tetrapeptide effector domain and the FKBP-binding domain (FKBD), in tandem. The C8 analogs were evaluated for the ability to inhibit PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and cell death and the ability to cross the BBB ( Figure 4 A; Table S2 ). We identified one compound, designated C8-31 (referred to hereafter as parthanatos-associated nuclease inhibitor-1, PAANIB-1) that differs from C8 by the addition of a fluorine ( Figure 4 B). PAANIB-1 potently inhibited PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and parthanatic cell death ( Figure 4 A). PAANIB-1 inhibited MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death with an IC 50 of 0.28 μM and C8 showed an IC 50 of 0.52 μM ( Figure 4 C). PAANIB-1, similar to C8, failed to inhibit ABT-888-sensitive PARP activity, STS-induced apoptotic cell death and TNF-α- and Z-VAD-induced necroptosis ( Figures S5 A–S5C). Moreover, PAANIB-1 did not enhance tumor viability in PC-3 prostate cancer cells but instead increased tumor toxicity induced by an oxidative DNA-damage-inducing agent, alantolactone (ATL) ( Wang et al., 2020 50. Wang, H. ∙ Zhang, S. ∙ Song, L. ... Synergistic lethality between PARP-trapping and alantolactone-induced oxidative DNA damage in homologous recombination-proficient cancer cells Oncogene. 2020; 39 :2905-2920 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ), similar to the enhancement of tumor toxicity by the PARP inhibitor, ABT-888 ( Figure S5 D). Both PAANIB-1 and C8 protected against α-syn PFF-induced cell death in mouse cortical neurons with minor differences in the potency at a lower concentration ( Figure 4 D). PAANIB-1 pretreatment and 3-day posttreatment after α-syn PFF administration prevented α-syn PFF-induced cell death, while 7- and 10-day posttreatment had no effect ( Figure S5 E). Levels of PAANIB-1 detected in the brain after oral gavage are almost 3-fold higher than C8 ( Figure 4 E), underscoring beneficial pharmacokinetic properties endowed from fluorination of C8. PAANIB-1 inhibited PAAN/MIF nuclease activity against its substrates and protected against genomic DNA cleavage in mouse cortical neurons treated with α-syn PFF ( Figure 4 F), while it did not affect to MIF’s or D-DT’s cytokine activity ( Figure S5 F) and nuclease activity of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1), a human exonuclease that plays a key role in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway ( Chou and Cheng, 2003 12. Chou, K.M. ∙ Cheng, Y.C. The exonuclease activity of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1). Biochemical properties and inhibition by the natural dinucleotide Gp4G J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :18289-18296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S5 G). Moreover, PAANIB-1 protected against the reduction of the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels induced by α-syn PFF in primary cultured neurons ( Figures 4 G and S5 H; Table S3 ). Taken together, PAANIB-1 rescues neurons against α-syn-PFF-induced synaptic dysfunction, reduction in NAD + , and cell death via inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity.
Since the rapafucins contain the FKBP-binding domain ( Li et al., 2011 30. Li, W. ∙ Bhat, S. ∙ Liu, J.O. A simple and efficient route to the FKBP-binding domain from rapamycin Tetrahedron Lett. 2011; 52 :5070-5072 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ), rapamycin and FK506 that have the same structural features were evaluated against PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death. Both rapamycin and FK506 failed to inhibit PAAN/MIF nuclease activity ( Figure 4 H) and MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death ( Figure S5 I), while PAANIB-1 blocked PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death. On the other hand, PAANIB-1 failed to inhibit rapamycin-sensitive pS6 kinase activity ( Figure S5 J) and FK506-sensitive calcineurin activity ( Figure S5 K), indicating no cross-reactivity to other FKBP-related enzymes. To further confirm whether the inhibitory effect of PAANIB-1 on PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity is independent on FKBPs, the role of FKBP12 and 52, the major isoforms of FKBPs ( Guo et al., 2019a 20. Guo, Z. ∙ Cheng, Z. ∙ Wang, J. ... Discovery of a potent GLUT inhibitor from a library of Rapafucins by using 3D microarrays Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2019; 58 :17158-17162 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ), were evaluated on the actions of PAANIB-1. Neither FKBP12 or 52 itself has nuclease activity nor do they have an effect on PAANIB-1 inhibition of PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity ( Figure S5 L). Moreover, depletion of FKBP12 or 52 in SH-SY5Y cells using CRISPR-Cas9 had no effect on MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death and the inhibitory action of PAANIB-1 ( Figures S5 M and S5N), suggesting that FKBPs are not involved in the cellular mechanism of action of PAANIB-1. MIF tautomerase inhibitors including an active site inhibitor, ISO-1 ( Al-Abed et al., 2005 1. Al-Abed, Y. ∙ Dabideen, D. ∙ Aljabari, B. ... ISO-1 binding to the tautomerase active site of MIF inhibits its pro-inflammatory activity and increases survival in severe sepsis J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :36541-36544 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (270) PubMed Google Scholar ) or allosteric inhibitors, p-425 and Ibudilast ( Bai et al., 2012 3. Bai, F. ∙ Asojo, O.A. ∙ Cirillo, P. ... A novel allosteric inhibitor of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 :30653-30663 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cho et al., 2010 11. Cho, Y. ∙ Crichlow, G.V. ∙ Vermeire, J.J. ... Allosteric inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor revealed by ibudilast Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :11313-11318 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ), failed to inhibit the nuclease activity of PAAN/MIF and parthanatic cell death ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Taken together, these results indicated that PAANIB-1 is a potent and selective inhibitor for PAAN/MIF nuclease that prevents α-syn PFF-induced cell death. Moreover, PAANIB-1 protection is independent from the FKBP-binding domain and active site and allosteric tautomerase inhibitors of MIF have no effect on PAAN/MIF nuclease activity or parthanatos.
Next, we attempted to gain deeper insight how PAANIB-1 inhibits PAAN/MIF nuclease. PAANIB-1 did not disrupt the interaction of PAAN/MIF with its substrate ( Figure S6 A). The binding affinity of PAAN/MIF for PAANIB-1 was determined using biolayer interferometry with a K d value of 1.56 μM ( Figure 5 A). C8-7, an analog of C8 had no effect on PAAN/MIF nuclease activity and MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death, consistent with its lack of binding to PAAN/MIF ( Figures S6 B and S6C). A 3D representational model of the PAAN/MIF trimer, an active form of PAAN/MIF nuclease, bound to PAANIB-1, was constructed ( Figure S6 D). Based on the model, PAAN/MIF amino acids 61–64, 67–68, 73, 98–100, and 106 are potential PAANIB-1-binding sites. Alanine substitutions were made for each residue surrounding the putative binding sites. The nuclease activity of PAAN/MIF S61A, L62A, H63A, S64A (MIF 61–64A), and PAAN/MIF N73A became resistant to PAANIB-1, while that of K67A and I68A (MIF 67–68A) or N98A, Y99A, and Y100A (MIF 98–100A) remained sensitive to inhibition by PAANIB-1 as the WT PAAN/MIF ( Figure 5 B). PAAN/MIF N106A is devoid of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity ( Figure 5 B). Individual PAAN/MIF mutants (S61A, L62A, H63A, S64A, K67A, I68A, N73A, N98A, Y99A, Y100A, and N106A) were made and tested against MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death treated with PAANIB-1 in PAAN/MIF KO SH-SY5Y cells in the absence and presence of the latter mutants in comparison with WT, PAAN/MIF 61–64A, PAAN/MIF 67–68A, and PAAN/MIF 98–100A. PAANIB-1 protection against MNNG-induced parthanatic cell death was significantly reduced in the PAAN/MIF L62A, PAAN/MIF 61–64A, and PAAN/MIF N73A mutants ( Figures 5 C and S6 E). The direct binding of the PAAN/MIF WT and alanine mutants was further evaluated against PAANIB-1. PAAN/MIF WT and Y100A mutant exhibited binding to PAANIB-1, while the binding was remarkably decreased for the mutants L62A and N73A ( Figure 5 D). We also confirmed that PAAN/MIF L62A and N73A failed to show PAANIB-1 protection to α-syn-PFF-induced neuronal death ( Figure 5 E). PAAN/MIF L62A and N73A did not affect MIF’s tautomerase activity ( Figure S6 F). These results indicate that L62 and N73 residues are involved in the direct binding of PAAN/MIF with PAANIB-1 to inhibit PAAN/MIF nuclease activity.
The protective role of PAANIB-1 was evaluated by oral administration starting 1 month after the intrastriatal α-syn PFF injection at a time after the pathogenic spread of pathologic α-syn to the substantia nigra and PARP-1 is activated ( Kam et al., 2018 24. Kam, T.I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease Science. 2018; 362 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that 1 μM of PAANIB-1 could prevent ∼80% of cell death induced by α-syn PFF in primary cortical neurons ( Figure 4 D), and about 2 μM of PAANIB-1 was found in the brain after oral gavage of 10 mg/kg PAANIB-1 ( Figure 4 E), we elected to use a dose of 5 mg/kg for the in vivo experiments to mimic the conditions in cell culture and 15 mg/kg to test whether a higher concentration of PAANIB-1 shows further protective effect ( Figure 6 A). Mice tolerated the PAANIB-1 with no overt toxicity or weight loss ( Figure S7 A). WT mice treated with PAANIB-1 exhibited significantly less loss of DA neurons after an intrastriatal injection of α-syn PFF compared with mice treated with vehicle as assessed by stereologic counting of TH immunoreactivity ( Figures 6 B and 6C) and Nissl staining ( Figures 6 B and 6D). TH levels were also reduced in WT mice in response to α-syn PFF as determined by western blot analysis, while the reduction in TH levels was prevented in PAANIB-1-treated mice ( Figure S7 B). α-Syn-PFF-induced reductions in DA ( Figure 6 E) and its metabolites, DOPAC ( Figure 6 F) levels, and increase of DA turnover ( Figures S7 C and S7D) were normalized by both doses of PAANIB-1 treatment. PAANIB-1 also significantly reduced the behavioral deficits elicited by α-syn PFF injection as measured by the pole test ( Figures 6 G and S7 E) and grip strength test ( Figures 6 H and S7 F). Pulse gel electrophoresis indicates that α-syn PFF induced large-scale genomic DNA cleavage in WT mice, while it was significantly attenuated in mice treated with both doses of PAANIB-1 ( Figure 6 I). Taken together, PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibition by PAANIB-1 protects against α-syn-PFF-induced neurodegeneration in PD.
The effects of PAANIB-1 were further evaluated in an α-synucleinopathy model induced by injection of AAV-human α-syn into substantia nigra ( Kirik et al., 2002 27. Kirik, D. ∙ Rosenblad, C. ∙ Burger, C. ... Parkinson-like neurodegeneration induced by targeted overexpression of α-synuclein in the nigrostriatal system J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :2780-2791 20026246 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Oliveras-Salvá et al., 2013 38. Oliveras-Salvá, M. ∙ Van der Perren, A. ∙ Casadei, N. ... rAAV2/7 vector-mediated overexpression of α-synuclein in mouse substantia nigra induces protein aggregation and progressive dose-dependent neurodegeneration Mol. Neurodegener. 2013; 8 :44 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment with PAANIB-1 in the AAV-human α-syn-injected mice was started 2 weeks after the AAV injection ( Figure 7 A). Both doses of 5 and 15 mg/kg of PAANIB-1 significantly prevented the α-syn neurodegeneration as assessed by stereologic counting of TH immunoreactivity ( Figures 7 B and 7C) and Nissl staining ( Figures 7 B and 7D) and the accompanying behavioral deficits including amphetamine-induced rotation test ( Figure 7 E), pole test ( Figure 7 F), and grip strength test ( Figure 7 G). There is an equivalent expression of α-syn under all conditions ( Figures 7 H and 7I). We next evaluated whether PAANIB-1 could protect against the loss of DA neurons in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication model ( Mandir et al., 1999 33. Mandir, A.S. ∙ Przedborski, S. ∙ Jackson-Lewis, V. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation mediates 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96 :5774-5779 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ; Przedborski et al., 1996 41. Przedborski, S. ∙ Jackson-Lewis, V. ∙ Yokoyama, R. ...

USA. 1996; 93 :4565-4571 Crossref Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oral administration of PAANIB-1 protected against the dopaminergic neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits induced by MPTP without affecting the metabolism of MPTP as indicated by the lack of a difference in MPP + levels in the different MPTP treatments ( Figures 7 J–7O).

Section: Discussion

The major findings of this paper are that PAAN/MIF nuclease activity is a druggable target and that pathologic α-syn cell death is mediated through PAAN/MIF nuclease activity. We have demonstrated that genetic depletion of PAAN/MIF prevents pathologic α-syn toxicity both in vitro and in vivo . Chemical compound screening for PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitors followed by a secondary screen for inhibitors of parthanatic cell death led to the identification of several inhibitors of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity as well as parthanatic cell death inhibitors. Pharmacological inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease prevents neurodegeneration induced by α-syn PFF, AAV-α-syn overexpression or MPTP intoxication in vivo .
MIF was previously known to have either tautomerase or nuclease activity ( Rosengren et al., 1996 44. Rosengren, E. ∙ Bucala, R. ∙ Aman, P. ... The immunoregulatory mediator macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) catalyzes a tautomerization reaction Mol. Med. 1996; 2 :143-149 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). Use of MIF P2G and PAAN/MIF E22Q knockin mice allowed the separation of the role of PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity from its tautomerase activity in pathologic α-syn neurodegeneration where the nuclease activity was found to be required for neurodegeneration. MIF is also known to act as an atypical extracellular cytokine where it counter regulates the immunosuppressive action of glucocorticoids ( Calandra et al., 1995 10. Calandra, T. ∙ Bernhagen, J. ∙ Metz, C.N. ... MIF as a glucocorticoid-induced modulator of cytokine production Nature. 1995; 377 :68-71 Crossref Scopus (1077) PubMed Google Scholar ; Flaster et al., 2007 18.

Immunol. 2005; 35 :3405-3413 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ). We showed that there is no significant difference in the ability of PAAN/MIF WT, E22Q, and MIF P2G in blocking the actions of dexamethasone inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production suggesting that MIF lacking nuclease activity or tautomerase activity does not interfere with MIF’s cytokine function. Recently, MIF was shown to induce the expression of the PD-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, while MIF-deficient murine lungs were shown to have reduced levels of Parkin ( Smith et al., 2019 47. Smith, C.A. ∙ Tyrell, D.J. ∙ Kulkarni, U.A. ... Macrophage migration inhibitory factor enhances influenza-associated mortality in mice JCI Insight. 2019; 4 :e128034 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since Parkin suppresses inflammation through mitochondrial DNA-induced cGAS-STING pathway ( Sliter et al., 2018 46. Sliter, D.A. ∙ Martinez, J. ∙ Hao, L. ... Parkin and PINK1 mitigate STING-induced inflammation Nature. 2018; 561 :258-262 Crossref Scopus (878) PubMed Google Scholar ), MIF may play a regulatory role in this process either through its atypical cytokine activity or through its nuclease activity. Future studies will be required to investigate the role of MIF in this pathway.
Similar to glutamate excitotoxicity ( Dawson et al., 1991 14. Dawson, V.L. ∙ Dawson, T.M. ∙ London, E.D. ... Nitric oxide mediates glutamate neurotoxicity in primary cortical cultures Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88 :6368-6371 Crossref Scopus (2178) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eliasson et al., 1997 15. Eliasson, M.J. ∙ Sampei, K. ∙ Mandir, A.S. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene disruption renders mice resistant to cerebral ischemia Nat. Med. 1997; 3 :1089-1095 Crossref Scopus (964) PubMed Google Scholar ), α-syn PFF increases the formation of nitric oxide and activates PARP-1, which contributes to α-syn neurodegeneration by the parthanatic death cascade ( Dawson and Dawson, 2017 13. Dawson, T.M. ∙ Dawson, V.L. Mitochondrial mechanisms of neuronal cell death: potential therapeutics Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2017; 57 :437-454 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kam et al., 2018 24. Kam, T.I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease Science. 2018; 362 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under conditions where PARP-1 activation drives cell death, MIF is the final executioner through its nuclease activity ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). Upon PARP-1 activation, PAR leaves the nucleus causing the translocation of mitochondrial AIF ( Andrabi et al., 2006 2. Andrabi, S.A. ∙ Kim, N.S. ∙ Yu, S.W. ...

USA. 2006; 103 :18314-18319 Crossref Scopus (633) PubMed Google Scholar ) where it recruits PAAN/MIF and translocates to the nucleus leading to PAAN/MIF cleavage of genomic DNA and cell death ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2021 61. Zhou, Y. ∙ Liu, L. ∙ Tao, S. ... Parthanatos and its associated components: promising therapeutic targets for cancer Pharmacol. Res. 2021; 163 :105299 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disruption of the AIF-PAAN/MIF interaction or mutation of glutamic acid at position 22 in the catalytic nuclease domain that blocks PAAN/MIF nuclease activity prevents chromatinolysis and cell death ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). Mechanistically, α-syn PFF induces an interaction between PAAN/MIF and AIF in a PARP-1-dependent manner, causing the translocation of PAAN/MIF into the nucleus where it acts as a final executioner in parthanatos by cleaving genomic DNA into large-scale fragments, similar to that previously described for glutamate excitotoxicity ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). We observed that α-syn PFF increases cleaved genomic DNA both in neuronal culture and in vivo , which is suppressed in PAAN/MIF-nuclease-activity-deficient, but not in MIF-tautomerase-activity-deficient mice. These results indicate that interfering with PAAN/MIF’s nuclease activity but not MIF tautomerase activity is neuroprotective in pathological α-syn-induced neurodegeneration in PD.
A PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibitor, PAANIB-1 is reported to be bioavailable and brain permeant. Pharmacological inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease with PAANIB-1 significantly prevented the loss of DA neurons and rescued the behavioral deficits in the pathologic α-syn PFF model of sporadic PD. PAANIB-1 also protects against the loss of DA neurons and rescued the behavioral deficits in an α-synucleinopathy model induced by injection of AAV-human α-syn into the substantia nigra. The downstream rescue by PAANIB-1 is not due to attenuated α-syn stress since there is an equivalent expression of α-syn under all conditions. PAANIB-1 also protects against the MPTP intoxication model suggesting that PAANIB-1 may have broad neuroprotective properties.
PAANIB-1 inhibits PAAN/MIF nuclease activity without affecting MIF’s tautomerase or cytokine activity. Both active site and allosteric tautomerase inhibitors do not inhibit PAAN/MIF nuclease activity or parthanatos. Thus, MIF nuclease activity is separated from its tautomerase activity. Moreover, PAANIB-1’s FKBD does not seem to be involved in the inhibition of PAAN/MIF nuclease activity or parthanatos. Exploration of the mechanism by which PAANIB-1 inhibits PAAN/MIF nuclease activity revealed that PAANIB-1 directly interacts with amino acids L62 and N73 that are distant from the nuclease active site, E22, to inhibit PAAN/MIF nuclease. Future structural studies will need to be conducted to support the biology and the crystal lattice structures of MIF.
PAANIB-1 is highly selective for PAAN/MIF nuclease, which highlights its therapeutic potential. PAANIB-1 clearly shows a specific ability in inhibiting parthanatos since it has no effect on other types of cell death such as apoptosis and necroptosis. Furthermore, it does not affect the upstream activator of parthanatos, PARP-1; thus, it is not likely to affect the physiological function of PARP-1 including DNA-damage repair, gene transcription, or cell proliferation ( Bai, 2015 4. Bai, P. Biology of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases: the factotums of cell maintenance Mol. Cell. 2015; 58 :947-958 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (330) PubMed Google Scholar ; Berger et al., 2018 6.

Parthanatos: mitochondrial-linked mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171 :2000-2016 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). PAAN/MIF does not share homology with other human DNases and its nuclease activity is separate from its tautomerase activity and cytokine function, making it possible to develop a specific therapeutic target that should have a high safety profile. Since increasing evidence indicates that parthanatos play a prominent role in a wide range of neurologic diseases, including stroke, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease ( Dawson and Dawson, 2017 13.

Biol. 2020; 353 :1-29 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), the therapeutic utility of PAAN/MIF nuclease inhibition will likely extend to other forms of neurodegeneration and cell death where parthanatos plays a role.
There are certain limitations of our work that will be the focus of future research. First, while we find that PAAN/MIF nuclease activity is responsible for mediating pathologic α-syn or MPTP-induced loss of DA neurons, we did not molecularly dissect the contributions of cell-autonomous (neuronal) and non-cell-autonomous (glial) mechanisms in the loss of DA neurons in these models. It will be important to investigate whether PAAN/MIF nuclease activity has a regulatory role in other cells of the nervous system including microglia and astrocytes. Second, it will be important to investigate MIF’s atypical cytokine activity and innate and adaptive immune regulatory role in the degenerative process of PD. Third, we do not know whether PAANIB-1 is an allosteric or active site inhibitor. Detailed structure activity relationships could enable the identification of more potent next generation small inhibitors of PAAN/MIF nuclease.

PAAN/MIF KO (RRID:IMSR_JAX:003830) and MIF P2G KI (RRID:MGI:3842625) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories and backcrossed to C57BL/6 background (RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664). For generation of PAAN/MIF E22Q KI mice, the linearized targeting vector containing the mutated site (E22Q) of PAAN/MIF in exon1 (pDTA-LC-069, AscI) were microinjected into the ES cells and transferred into pseudo-pregnant female mice. Using genomic DNA prepared from tail snip (Proteinase K, Roche Diagnostics; direct PCR lysis, Viagen), pups were genotyped by PCR (GoTag Green Master Mix, Promega) using primers (forward: GGGAGAAATTAATAGTGTGCTCCAG; reverse: CTCAGGGACCTGCTGTGATT G). Positive founders were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing. All housing, breeding, and procedures were performed according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and approved by Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.
Human H1 embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were differentiated into cortical neurons as previously described ( Xu et al., 2016 55. Xu, J.C. ∙ Fan, J. ∙ Wang, X. ... Cultured networks of excitatory projection neurons and inhibitory interneurons for studying human cortical neurotoxicity Sci. Transl. Med. 2016; 8 :333ra48 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, ESC colonies detached from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown in suspension in human ESC medium without FGF2 for 6 days in low-attachment six-well plates (Corning). On day 7, free-floating embyroid bodies (EBs) were transferred to Matrigel coated plates to allow the complete attachment of EB and formation of rosette neuronal aggregates (RONAs). RONAs were manually microisolated and maintained as neurospheres for 1 day and then dissociated into single cells and plated on laminin/poly-D-lysine-coated plates for further experiments. For neuronal differentiation, retinoic acid (2 μM), SHH (50 ng/ml), purmorphamine (2 μM), or the combination of retinoic acid, SHH, and purmorphamine was supplemented in neural differentiation medium containing Neurobasal/B27 (NB/B27; Invitrogen), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 20 ng/ml; PeproTech), glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; 20 ng/ml; PeproTech), ascorbic acid (0.2 mM; Sigma), dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP; 0.5 mM; Sigma). All experiments using human stem cells were monitored and approved by the JHU Institutional Stem Cell Research Oversight (ISCRO) Committee.
Recombinant mouse α-synuclein protein were prepared from IPTG independent inducible pRK172 vector ( Luk et al., 2012 32. Luk, K.C. ∙ Kehm, V. ∙ Carroll, J. ... Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiates Parkinson-like neurodegeneration in nontransgenic mice Science. 2012; 338 :949-953 Crossref Scopus (1851) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in high-salt buffer [750 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.6) and 1 mM EDTA] containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche), boiled for 15 min, and centrifuged at 6,000 x g for 20 min. The supernatants were applied onto a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and Hi-Trap Q HP anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) and eluted at ∼300 mM NaCl. After purification, bacterial endotoxins were eliminated by Toxineraser endotoxin removal kit (GeneScript). α-syn PFF were prepared as previously described ( Kam et al., 2018 24. Kam, T.I. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Park, H. ... Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease Science. 2018; 362 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ) by agitating (1,000 rpm at 37° C) for 7 days and sonicated for 30 s (0.5 sec pulse on/off) at 10% amplitude (Branson Digital Sonifier).
Two to 3-month-old mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) and fixed in a stereotaxic instrument. PBS or α-syn PFF (5 μg/ 2 μl) was unilaterally injected into striatum [anteroposterior (AP) = + 0.2 mm, mediolateral (ML) = + 2.0 mm, dorsoventral (DV) = +2.8 mm from bregma]. AAV-GFP or AAV-human α-syn particles (Vector Biosystems) was unilaterally injected into the SNpc [anteroposterior (AP) = - 3.0 mm, mediolateral (ML) = + 1.2 mm, dorsoventral (DV) = +4.3 mm from bregma]. The infusion was performed at a rate of 0.4 μl/min and the needle were left in place for 5 min for a complete absorption of the solution. After surgery, recovery of animals was monitored the following day of injection. Behavioral tests were performed 6 months after injection and mice were euthanized for biochemical and histological analysis. For biochemical analysis, tissues were immediately dissected and frozen at -80 °C. For histological analysis, animal was perfused with ice-cold PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.
Two to 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice were prepared and PAANIB-1 was administered by oral gavage before, during, and after MPTP administration. The MPTP-treated groups received four intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injections of MPTP⋅HCl (20 mg/kg free base) in saline at 2 h intervals in a single day ( Karuppagounder et al., 2014 26. Karuppagounder, S.S. ∙ Brahmachari, S. ∙ Lee, Y. ... The c-Abl inhibitor, nilotinib, protects dopaminergic neurons in a preclinical animal model of Parkinson’s disease Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4874 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pole test was performed on day 13 and all the mice were sacrificed on day 14.
The behavioral deficits in α-syn PFF injected WT, PAAN/MIF KO, E22Q KI or P2G KI mice, in α-syn PFF injected WT or PAAN/MIF KO mice expressing AAV2-Flag-PAAN/MIF WT, E22Q or P2G (ViGene Biosciences), in α-syn PFF injected WT mice delivered with PAANIB-1, in AAV2-human α-syn injected WT mice delivered with PAANIB-1, and in MPTP injected WT mice delivered with PAANIB-1 were assessed by the pole test, grip strength test, clasping test or amphetamine-induced rotation test. The experimenters were blinded to genotype or treatment condition and randomized. In Figures 1 E and 1F, we used 3 males and 4 females for PBS-injected WT, 4 males and 3 females for PBS-injected MIF KO, 3 males and 4 females for α-syn PFF-injected WT, 4 males and 3 females for α-syn PFF-injected MIF KO. In Figures 1 J and 1K, we used 3 males and 4 females for PBS-injected WT, 4 males and 3 females for PBS-injected MIF E22Q, 4 males and 4 females for PBS-injected MIF P2G, 4 males and 4 females for α-syn PFF-injected WT, 5 males and 5 females for α-syn PFF-injected MIF E22Q, and 5 males and 5 females for α-syn PFF-injected MIF E22Q. In Figures 6 G and 6H, we used 6 males and 7 females for PBS-injected WT with vehicle, 5 males and 5 females for PBS-injected WT with 5 mg/kg PAANIB-1, 7 males and 7 females for PBS-injected WT with 15 mg/kg PAANIB-1, 6 males and 7 females for α-syn PFF-injected WT with vehicle, 10 males and 10 females for α-syn PFF-injected WT with 5 mg/kg PAANIB-1, and 10 males and 10 females for α-syn PFF-injected WT with 15 mg/kg PAANIB-1. In Figures 7 E–7G, we used 4 males and 5 females for AAV-GFP with vehicle, 5 males and 5 females for AAV-GFP with 15 mg/kg PAANIB-1, 5 males and 6 females for AAV-α-syn with vehicle, 6 males and 5 females for AAV-α-syn with 5 mg/kg PAANIB-1, and 6 males and 5 females for AAV-α-syn with 15 mg/kg PAANIB-1. In Figures 7 M and 7N, we used 4 males and 5 females for saline, 5 males and 5 females for saline with 15 mg/kg PAANIB-1, 5 males and 5 females for MPTP, 6 males and 6 females for MPTP with 5 mg/kg PAANIB-1, and 5 males and 5 females for MPTP with 15 mg/kg PAANIB-1.
The 9 mm diameter pole is a 2.5 ft metal rod wrapped with bandage gauze. Before the actual test, the mice were trained for two consecutive days and each training session consisted of three test trials. On the day of the test, mice were placed 3 inches from the top of the pole facing head-up. The time to turn and total time to reach the base of the pole were recorded. The maximum cutoff of time to stop the test and recording was 60 s.
Neuromuscular strength was measured by maximum holding force developed by the mice using a grip-strength meter (Bioseb). Mice were placed onto a metal grid to grasp with either fore or both limbs that are recorded as ‘fore limb’ and ‘fore and hindlimb’, respectively. The tail was gently pulled, and the maximum holding force was recorded by the force transducer before the mice released their grasp on the grid. The peak holding strength was digitally recorded and displayed as force in grams (g).
The hindlimb clasping test is used to show decrease of motor function. The test was performed by grasping the mouse tail and hindlimb clasping was monitored for 10 s ( Taylor et al., 2010 48. Taylor, T.N. ∙ Greene, J.G. ∙ Miller, G.W. Behavioral phenotyping of mouse models of Parkinson’s disease Behav. Brain Res. 2010; 211 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hindlimb clasping was scored as follows: 0, normal (hindlimbs consistently splayed outward, away from the abdomen); 1, one or two hindlimbs partially retracted toward the abdomen for more than 50% of the time; 2, both hindlimbs fully retracted toward the abdomen for more than 50% of the time; 3, hindlimbs pulled into the body and clasped by the forelimbs.
5 mg/kg amphetamine (Sigma-Aldrich) was intraperitoneally administered to the mice. Mice were placed in a white paper cylinder of 20 cm diameter and monitored for 60 min. Full body ipsilateral rotations (clockwise) during each ten-minute session were counted for each mouse from the video recordings.
Biogenic amine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Briefly, mice were decapitated, and the striatum was quickly removed from the brain. Striatal tissue was weighed and sonicated in ice-cold 10 μM perchloric acid containing 0.01% EDTA (wt/vol). The 60 ng of 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine (DHBA) was used as an internal standard. After centrifugation (15,000 x g, 30 min, 4° C), the supernatant was cleaned through a 0.2 μm filter and 20 μl of the supernatant was injected into HPLC column (3 mm × 150 mm C-18 reverse phase column, Acclaim™ Polar Advantage II, Thermo Scientific) and analyzed by a dual channel Coulchem III electrochemical detector (Model 5300, ESA, Inc. Chelmsford, MA). The protein concentrations of tissue homogenates were measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Data were normalized to protein concentrations (ng/mg of neurotransmitters/tissue).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed on 50 μm thick serial brain sections including substantia nigra and striatum. Every 4 th section was utilized for analysis. Primary antibodies (see key resource table ) and working dilutions used were as follows: PAAN/MIF (AB_305760), 1:500 (IF); AIF (AB_6266540 1:500 (IF); Flag (AB_439712) 1:1,000 (IHC); TH (AB_10077691) 1:1,000 (IHC, IF); p-α-syn ser129 (AB_2564891) 1:500 (IF). For histological studies, free-floating sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-TH (Novus) and visualized with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, followed by streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories). The sections were visualized with SigmaFast DAB peroxidase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were counterstained with Nissl (0.09% thionin). Total numbers of TH- and Nissl-stained neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta were counted by an investigator who was blind to genotypes or treatment condition with randomly allocated group using the optical fractionators, the unbiased method for cell counting by the computer-assisted image analysis system consisting of an Axiophot photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a computer controlled motorized stage (Ludl Electronics), a Hitachi HV C20 camera, and Stereo Investigator software (MicroBright-Field). For Nissl counting, a cell was defined as bright, blue-stained neuronal perikarya with a nucleolus ( Karuppagounder et al., 2014 26. Karuppagounder, S.S. ∙ Brahmachari, S. ∙ Lee, Y. ... The c-Abl inhibitor, nilotinib, protects dopaminergic neurons in a preclinical animal model of Parkinson’s disease Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 :4874 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). For immunofluorescent studies, double-labeled sections were incubated with a mixture of Alexa-fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). The fluorescent images were acquired by confocal scanning microscopy (LSM710, Carl Zeiss). All the images were processed by the Zen software (Carl Zeiss).
Dissected brain regions of interest were homogenized and prepared in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton x-100, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% sodium-deoxycholate, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma-Aldrich), and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)]. The samples were rotated at 4° C for 30 min for the completed lysis and centrifugated at 15,000 x g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) and samples were separated using SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBS-T (Tris buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h, probed using various primary antibodies. Primary antibodies (see key resource table ) and working dilutions used were as follows: PAR 1:2,000; PARP-1 (AB_398352), 1:2,000; PAAN/MIF (AB_305760), 1:3,000; AIF (AB_626654) 1:3,000; H3 (AB_105445370), 1:3,000; HSP60 (AB_2295614), 1:1,000; Flag (AB_439712), 1:3,000; pS6K (AB_330944), 1:3,000; S6K (AB_390722), 1:3,000; pS6 (AB_331682), 1:1,000; S6 (AB_331355) 1:3,000; p4E-BP1 (AB_560835), 1:1,000; 4E-BP1 (AB_2097841), 1:3,000; TH (AB_10077691), 1:2,000; DAT (AB_1840807), 1:1,000; FKBP-12 (AB_2102847), 1:1,000; FKBP-52, 1:1,000; p-α-syn ser129 (AB_2564891), 1:1,000; α-syn (AB_398107), 1:1,000; α-syn (Syn 211) (AB_261528), 1:1,000; β-actin_HRP (AB_262011), 1:20,000. Target antigens were incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell signaling) and were visualized by ECL substrate.
The substantia nigra was rapidly removed from the brain and lysed by repetitive pipetting with a micropipette in lysis buffer [100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5 % SDS] with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics). Samples were incubated 55° C for overnight and further incubated 85° C for 45 min to inactivate proteinase K. The genomic DNA were immediately separated on a 1.2 % pulse field certified agarose in 0.5 × TBE buffer with initial switch time of 1.5 s and a final switch time of 3.5 s for 12 h at 6 V/cm. The gel was then stained with 0.5 mg/ml Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) and visualized on UV light. Noncleaved genomic DNA was quantified as percentage (%) of the total genomic DNA that included both noncleaved genomic DNA and cleaved genomic DNA in each individual group.
SH-SY5Y cells (ATCC, RRID:CVCL_0019) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37° C under 5% CO 2 . Parthanatos was induced by the treatment of 50 μM MNNG for 15 min in SH-SY5Y cells. ABT-888 or PAAN/MIF inhibitors were pretreated with indicated concentration 1 h before MNNG treatment and cell death was assessed after 24 h. FKBP12 and 52 KO SH-SY5Y cells were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 strategy. The gRNAs targeting FKBP12 (#1, 5’- CAGGTGGAAACCATCTCCCC-3’; #2, GGTCTGGCCGCGCTTGGGGA-3’) and FKBP52 (#1, 5’- GATGAAGGCGACCGAGAGCG-3’; #2, 5’-CAGCACGCCTTCGTCCTGTT -3’) were ligated to lentiCRISPR vector (Addgene) and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen). Surviving cells after antibiotic selection using puromycin for 3 days were trypsinized and amplified for further analysis. The knockout efficiency was verified by western blot using FKBP12 and 52 antibodies, respectively. Primary cortical neurons from WT, PAAN/MIF KO, E22Q KI, or P2G KI embryos were prepared as previously described ( Kam et al., 2016 25. Kam, T.I. ∙ Park, H. ∙ Gwon, Y. ... FcγRIIb-SHIP2 axis links Aβ to tau pathology by disrupting phosphoinositide metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease model eLife. 2016; 5 :e18691 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the cortex was dissected and cultured at embryonic day 16 in neurobasal media supplemented with B-27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Primary neurons were infected by lentivirus carrying PAAN/MIF -WT-Flag, E22Q-Flag, E22A-Flag, P2G-Flag, L62A-Flag or N73A-Flag at days in vitro (DIV) 4-5. ABT-888 or PAAN/MIF inhibitors were applied to neurons 1 h before α-syn PFF treatment. The neuron growth medium was replaced with fresh medium alone or including inhibitors every 3-4 days. α-syn PFF was added at DIV 7 and further incubated for indicated times followed by the cell death assay or biochemical experiments.
Mouse PAAN/MIF-WT-Flag, E22Q-Flag, E22A-Flag, P2G-Flag, L62A-Flag and N73A-Flag were subcloned into a lentiviral cFugw vector ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). The lentivirus was produced by transient transfection of the recombinant cFugw vector into 293FT cells together with three packaging vectors: pLP1, pLP2, and pVSV-G (1.3:1.5:1:1.5). The viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours after transfection and concentrated by ultracentrifugation for 2 hours at 50,000 g. MIF-WT-Flag, MIF E22Q-Flag and MIF-P2G-Flag were subcloned into an AAV-WPRE-bGH vector and produced by the ViGene Biosciences.
Primary cultured cortical neurons or human cortical neurons were treated with 5 μg/ml of α-syn PFF for 14 days and cell death was determined by staining of all nuclei with 7 μM Hoechst 33342 and dead cell nuclei with 2 μM propidium iodide (PI) (Invitrogen). The numbers of total and dead cells were counted with the Axiovision 4.6 software (Carl Zeiss). Cell viability was determined by fluorescence at an excitation wavelength 570 nm and an emission wavelength 585 nm using Alamar Blue (Invitrogen).
1 mg of whole-cell lysates were incubated with AIF antibody (1 mg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight, followed by incubation with protein G magnetic beads (Biorad) for 3 h, at 4° C. The IP complexes were washed 5 times and then denatured by boiling for 5 min after adding 2x Laemlli buffer plus β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were analyzed by western blot analysis with mouse anti-Flag antibody (Clone M1, Sigma) or rabbit anti-PAAN/MIF antibody (Abcam).
Subcellular fraction and quantification of relative levels of AIF and PAAN/MIF were performed as previously described ( Wang et al., 2016 53. Wang, Y. ∙ An, R. ∙ Umanah, G.K. ... A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 Science. 2016; 354 Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar ). Briefly, primary cortical neurons treated with α-syn PFF were subjected to subcellular fractionation into nuclear extracts (N) and postnuclear cell extracts (PN), which is the fraction prepared from whole-cell lysates after removing nuclear proteins using hypotonic buffer ( Yu et al., 2002 59. Yu, S.W. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Poitras, M.F. ... Mediation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1-dependent cell death by apoptosis-inducing factor Science. 2002; 297 :259-263 Crossref Scopus (1644) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each fraction was monitored by H3 antibody (Cell signaling) for the nuclear fraction and HSP60 antibody (Cell signaling) for the postnuclear fraction.
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from primary cortical neurons visualized under a 40x water immersion objective by fluorescence and DIC optics (Carl Zeiss). Recordings were made with 4–6 MΩ borosilicate pipettes filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate 126, KCl 8, HEPES 20, EGTA 0.2, NaCl 2, MgATP 3, Na 3 GTP 0.5 (adjust to pH 7.3 with KOH; adjust to 290-300 mOsmol/kg with sucrose). Patchmaster software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) in combination with an EPC 10 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA) was used for stimulation and data acquisition. Recordings were made at 32 °C with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): NaCl 125, KCl 2.5, MgSO 4 1, NaH 2 PO 4 1.25, NaHCO 3 26, CaCl 2 2, and D-glucose 10. The pH of ACSF was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH, and osmolarity was at 300–310 mOsmol/kg. Resting membrane potential was recorded in current clamp mode at 0 pA immediately after establishing whole-cell configuration. Series resistance (Rseries) and input resistance (Rin) were calculated from a 5-mV pulse and monitored throughout the experiment. Unstable recordings (>10% fluctuation of Rseries value) during the course of experiments were rejected from further analysis. Recordings were low pass filtered at 2.9 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. mEPSCs were recorded in voltage-clamp mode with a holding potential of −70 mV, in the presence of TTX (0.25 μM), bicuculline (10 μM), and APV (20 μM), and analyzed using Clampfit 10.5 software (Molecular devices) and MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft). 10 cells per condition from three independent cultures were included in the analysis.
Amine modified PAAN/MIF RF substrate (5’-NH2 -TCCCAAGTAGCTGGGATTACAGGAAAA AAA-3’) was immobilized on 96-well DNA-BIND plates (Corning) at a concentration of 100 nM in 100 μl of binding buffer [50 mM Na 2 PO 4 (pH 8.5), 1 mM EDTA] at 37° C. After 1 h, the plates were washed three times with PBS to remove the uncoupled substrate and the plates were blocked by adding 200 μl of 3% BSA in binding buffer for 30 min at 37° C. A mixture of 8 μM PAAN/MIF protein and each of 10 μM compound in enzyme reaction buffer [10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.0) and 10 mM MgCl 2 ] was added. After 1 h incubation for PAAN/MIF’s enzyme reaction, the plates were washed three times with PBS followed by a hybridization reaction adding the biotin labeled complementary DNA (5’-biotin-TTTTTTTCCTGTAA-3’) at a 100 nM concentration in 100 μl of hybridization solution (5X SSC and 0.1 % SDS) for 1 h at 55° C. The plates were washed harshly with preheated washing solution (2X SSC and 0.1 % SDS) three times, soaked for 5 min and blocked with 3 % BSA in binding buffer for 30 min. The biotin labeled complementary DNA were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Streptavidin (Thermo Scientific) for 30 min at 37 °C and were monitored for colorimetric changes by adding 1-step Ultra TMB-ELISA substrate solution (Thermo Scientific). Each plate contains three reactions with or without PAAN/MIF protein as controls. To assess high-throughput screening (HTS) readiness and robustness of our assay, coefficient of variation (CV), signal-to-background ratio (S/B) and Z’ factor were calculated by the value of the reaction without PAAN/MIF and the reaction with PAAN/MIF in each plate. For the secondary screening, SH-SY5Y cells were plated into 96 well plates with 10,000 cells /well. On the next day, each compound was added 1 h before MNNG treatment. Cells were treated with MNNG (50 μM) for 15 min and then further incubated in normal medium including compounds for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using Alamar Blue as described above.
Purified PAAN/MIF protein (4 μM) was incubated with compounds (10 μM) in the nuclease buffer [10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.0) and 10 mM MgCl 2 ] for 20 min on ice. Then samples were added with 1 μM of PAAN/MIF substrate and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. The reaction was terminated with loading buffer containing 10 mM EDTA and separated on 15 % TBE-urea polyacrylamide (PAGE) gel or 20 % TBE PAGE gel. For other nucleases (EcoRI and EcoRV) assays, pcDNA3 (500 ng/reaction) was used as a substrate and 0.01 unit of Exonulcase III were incubated with small dsDNA (5’-GTCACCGTCATACGACTC-3’ and 5’-GAGTCGTATGACGGTGAC-3’). For APE1 endonuclease assays, 40-mer of dsDNA (5’-GTGGCGCGGAGACTTAGAGAFATTTGGCGCGGGGAATTCC-3’ and 5’-CACCGCGCCTCTGAA TCTCTGTAAACCGCGCCCCTTAAGG-3’) used as a substrate ( Chou and Cheng, 2003 12. Chou, K.M. ∙ Cheng, Y.C. The exonuclease activity of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1). Biochemical properties and inhibition by the natural dinucleotide Gp4G J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :18289-18296 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Human PAAN/MIF (NM_002415) cDNA and its variants were subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare) and mutants were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The protein was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by glutathione sepharose (GE Healthcare). The GST tag was subsequently proteolytically removed. GST protein was used as a negative control in the nuclease assay and PAAN/MIF proteins purified by FPLC using Superdex 200 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences) were also used in the nuclease assays.
The dose-dependent binding of PAANIB-1 for PAAN/MIF WT or PAAN/MIF variants were determined by a biolayer interferometry assay using Octet RED96 (ForteBio) ( Wang et al., 2019 51. Wang, L. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Li, L. ... Small-molecule inhibitor targeting the Hsp90-Cdc37 protein-protein interaction in colorectal cancer Sci. Adv. 2019; 5 :eaax2277 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). All the proteins used in this assay were tagged with GST. Anti-GST biosensor tips (ForteBio) were used to immobilize the GST proteins after prewetting with 1X kinetic buffer (ForteBio). The equilibrated GST biosensors were loaded with PAAN/MIF WT or variants (25 μg/ml). Background binding controls were measured by sensors that were incubated in buffer without proteins. All assays were performed by a standard protocol in 96-well black plates (Greiner Bio) with a total volume of 200 μl per well. All the data were analyzed by Octet data analysis software.
1 mg of recombinant PARP-1 activated DNA and NAD + (Trevigen) in the presence or absence of 1 μM of PARP-1 inhibitor, ABT-888 or PAAN/MIF inhibitors (C8 or PAANIB-1) were incubated in the PARP assay buffer (Trevigen) for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using PAR antibody.
Calcineurin activity was measured using a calcineurin cellular activity assay (Enzo Life Sciences) according to manufacturer’s protocols ( Sangadala et al., 2019 45. Sangadala, S. ∙ Devereaux, E.J. ∙ Presciutti, S.M. ... FK506 induces ligand-independent activation of the bone morphogenetic protein pathway and osteogenesis Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20 :1900 Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar ). SH-SY5Y cells treated with FK506, or PAANIB-1 were placed in a desalting column to remove excess phosphates and nucleotides. Total phosphate activity was determined in the samples by incubating with a calcineurin-specific substrate supplied in the manufacturer and measured by monitoring absorbance at 620 nm. Calcineurin activity was calculated as the difference between total phosphatase activity minus the phosphatase activity in the presence of 10 mM EGTA that blocks calcineurin activity.
EMSA assays were performed using the Light-Shift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufactures instruction. Recombinant PAAN/MIF protein (2 μM) was incubated with 1-100 μM PAANIB-1 as indicated in the binding buffer containing 10 mM MgCl 2 for 10 min and further incubated with biotin-labeled DNA substrates (10 nM) for 30 min on ice. The mixture was separated on 6 % retardation polyacrylamide and transferred to a Nylon membrane. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect the biotin-labeled DNA using the Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Thermo Scientific).
NAD + were measured according to the manufacturer’s instructions of the assay kit (Abcam). Briefly, α-syn PFF treated primary cortical neurons with or without PAANIB-1 were lysed in NAD extraction buffer and the protein concentration was determined (BioRad Laboratories). The same amount of protein was used for each sample. Samples were divided, half was used to heat degrade NAD + , and the other half represents total NAD. Samples were then mixed with reaction buffer and Cycling Enzyme to transform all NAD + in NADH, allowing the measure of total NAD (NADt). Concentration of NAD + and NADH was then calculated by comparison to NADH standard curve.
The thiol-protein oxidoreductase activity of PAAN/MIF was measured using insulin as the substrate as described previously ( Kudrin et al., 2006 28. Kudrin, A. ∙ Scott, M. ∙ Martin, S. ... Human macrophage migration inhibitory factor: a proven immunomodulatory cytokine? J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :29641-29651 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the insulin assay is based on the reduction of insulin and subsequent insolubilization of the insulin β-chain. The time-dependent increase in turbidity is then measured spectrophotometrically at 650 nm. The reaction was started by adding 5 μM PAAN/MIF WT in the presence or absence of 10 μM compounds (C7, C8, C11 and C12) dissolved in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and 200 mM reduced glutathione (GSH) to ice-cold reaction mixture containing 1 mg/ml insulin, 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and 2 mM EDTA. Insulin reduction was measured against the control solution (containing GSH) in the same experiment.
The keto-enol tautomeric conversion of D-dopachrome methyl ester by PAAN/MIF was used as described previously ( Bendrat et al., 1997 5. Bendrat, K. ∙ Al-Abed, Y. ∙ Callaway, D.J. ... Biochemical and mutational investigations of the enzymatic activity of macrophage migration inhibitory factor Biochemistry. 1997; 36 :15356-15362 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a fresh solution of D-dopachrome methyl ester was prepared by mixing 2 mM L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester with 4 mM sodium peroxidate for 5 min at room temperature and then placed directly on ice before use. The enzymatic reaction was initiated at 25° C by adding 20 μl of the dopachrome methyl ester substrate to 200 μl of PAAN/MIF WT (final concentration 5 μM) with or without 10 μM compounds (C7, C8, C11 and C12) in tautomerase assay buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, 1mM EDTA, pH 6.0). To enhance substrate stability, excess sodium meta-periodate was removed using C8 disposable columns (Waters). The activity was determined by the decrease in absorbance at 475 nm using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices).
Primary microglia cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma) and MIF or D-DT with or without PAANIB-1 before adding 100 ng/ml LPS (Sigma). TNFα levels were measured by comparative quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) ( Merk et al., 2011 36. Merk, M. ∙ Zierow, S. ∙ Leng, L. ... The D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) gene product is a cytokine and functional homolog of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :E577-E585 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total RNA was extracted with RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) and then reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription System (Life Technologies). qPCR was performed in duplicated or triplicated for each sample using fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) and ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The expression levels of TNFα were normalized to the expression of β-actin.
Rapafucins, including C8 and PAANIB-1 and other analogues were synthesized using solid-phase peptide synthesis and catalytic ring-closing metathesis and purified on a silica gel column. FKBD and cis-C6 linker conjugated resin was prepared as previously described ( Guo et al., 2019b 21. Guo, Z. ∙ Hong, S.Y. ∙ Wang, J. ... Rapamycin-inspired macrocycles with new target specificity Nat. Chem. 2019; 11 :254-263 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Modified FKBDs, including eFKBD-E1A24168 were prepared by BioDuro. PAANIB-1 used for in vivo studies was further purified using reverse-phase column chromatography to remove any metal catalyst residues. HPLC-MS was used to analyze purity and identification for all compounds synthesized. HRMS was measured for key compounds for further verification. HRMS for C8 [M+H]+ C62H83N6O15, calculated: 1151.5916, observed: 1151.5900, HRMS for PAANIB-1 [M+H]+ C62H82FN6O15, calculated: 1169.5822, observed: 1169.5802. PAANIB-1 or other PAAN/MIF inhibitors were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) for in vitro assays. PAANIB-1 was dissolved in a vehicle solution of 1 % Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG 400, Fluka) and 1 % hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC, Sigma-Aldrich) for oral administration.
C8, C12 and PAANIB-1 were resuspended in a vehicle solution and were administered at 10 mg/kg by oral gavage. After 2 h, mice were perfused with PBS and whole brain was isolated, weighed and grounded with a pestle to a very fine powder with liquid nitrogen. Then, 2-folds of acetonitrile were added to brain tissue sample and the mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, 4° C for 10 min. The supernatant was used for analysis. The concentration of compounds in brain tissue were measured using HPLC-MS on a C-18 reverse phase HPLC column. Separations were achieved using a linear gradient of buffer B from 40% to 95% in A (A = 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O; B = 0.1% formic acid in CH 3 CN) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injected brain samples at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 or 8 μM concentration were used for the standard curve.
All data are represented as mean ± s.e.m. with at least 3 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 and statistical significance were reported in the relevant Figures and Figure legends. Differences between 2 means and among multiple means were assessed by unpaired two-tailed student t test and ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, respectively. The graph representation, definition of n and which statistical test was performed is indicated in the figure legend. Error bars show standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD), as indicated in the figure legend. Sample size was chosen according to that used for similar experiments in the literature.
