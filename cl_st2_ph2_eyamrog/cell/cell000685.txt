Title: Primate hemorrhagic fever-causing arteriviruses are poised for spillover to humans


Abstract: Summary

Simian arteriviruses are endemic in some African primates and can cause fatal hemorrhagic fevers when they cross into primate hosts of new species. We find that CD163 acts as an intracellular receptor for simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV; a simian arterivirus), a rare mode of virus entry that is shared with other hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses (e.g., Ebola and Lassa viruses). Further, SHFV enters and replicates in human monocytes, indicating full functionality of all of the human cellular proteins required for viral replication. Thus, simian arteriviruses in nature may not require major adaptations to the human host. Given that at least three distinct simian arteriviruses have caused fatal infections in captive macaques after host-switching, and that humans are immunologically naive to this family of viruses, development of serology tests for human surveillance should be a priority.

Section: Introduction

Simian hemorrhagic fever is a lethal disease that has been documented in captive Asian macaques ( Macaca spp.). Outbreaks have occurred in macaque colonies worldwide ( Figure 1 A) and have been traced to at least three different simian viruses ( Figure 1 B, in red) classified in subfamily Simarterivirinae ( Nidovirales : Arteriviridae ) ( Kuhn et al., 2016 45. Kuhn, J.H. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Bailey, A.L. ... Reorganization and expansion of the nidoviral family Arteriviridae Arch Virol. 2016; 161 :755-768 Crossref Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lauck et al., 2015 50.

Historical outbreaks of simian hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques were caused by distinct arteriviruses J Virol. 2015; 89 :8082-8087 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These simian arteriviruses likely entered primate facilities through the import of subclinically infected wild African monkeys. To date, primate facilities remain vigilant about preventing exposure to these viruses ( Johnson et al., 2011 38. Johnson, R.F. ∙ Dodd, L.E. ∙ Yellayi, S. ...

Lauck, M. ∙ Alkhovsky, S.V. ∙ Bào, Y. ... Historical outbreaks of simian hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques were caused by distinct arteriviruses J Virol. 2015; 89 :8082-8087 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Human infections at affected primate facilities have not been detected. Further, there is no way to surveil for prior human exposure in Africa, where these viruses are endemic in primates, because no serology tests exist. In the absence of strong biological indications that humans could be at risk of infection with these viruses, there has been little impetus to interrogate the interface between nonhuman primates and humans in Africa to exclude cryptic spillover events or subclinical infection cycles.
Although the natural primate reservoirs of these viruses remain poorly understood, recent discovery efforts have identified broad arterivirus diversity in apparently healthy African monkeys of numerous species ranging across Africa ( Figure 1 C) ( Bailey et al., 2014a 2.

Infected monkeys can carry high viral loads ( Bailey et al., 2016 5. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Ghai, R.R. ... Arteriviruses, pegiviruses, and lentiviruses are common among wild African monkeys J Virol. 2016; 90 :6724-6737 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In some locations, primates of these species interact with people in direct and often aggressive ways, leading to high risk of exposure for humans. For instance, red colobus monkeys in western Uganda are infected with high viral loads of two simian arteriviruses ( Lauck et al., 2013 48. Lauck, M. ∙ Sibley, S.D. ∙ Hyeroba, D. ... Exceptional simian hemorrhagic fever virus diversity in a wild African primate community J Virol. 2013; 87 :688-691 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and are known to bite and scratch local people ( Paige et al., 2014 68.

Paige, S.B. ∙ Bleecker, J. ∙ Mayer, J. ... Spatial overlap between people and non-human primates in a fragmented landscape EcoHealth. 2017; 14 :88-99 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such human-primate antagonism is widespread and increasing across Africa ( Hill, 2018 31. Hill, C.M. Human–primate conflict The International Encyclopedia of Biological Anthropology 2018 Crossref Google Scholar ; Hockings, 2016 32. Hockings, K.J. Mitigating human–nonhuman primate conflict The International Encyclopedia of Primatology 2016 Crossref Google Scholar ).
The recent finding that arteriviruses can replicate in primary ape (chimpanzee and gorilla) cells ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ) evokes parallels to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV; Retroviridae ). SIV first crossed from African monkeys into apes, a key “stepping-stone” event that ultimately led to the evolution and emergence of the pandemic strain of HIV (HIV-1 group M) in humans ( Sauter and Kirchhoff, 2019 76.

Like arteriviruses, SIV can cause spillover infection of captive macaques ( Daniel et al., 1985 15. Daniel, M.D. ∙ Letvin, N.L. ∙ King, N.W. ...

In addition, simian arteriviruses and SIVs are both endemic in African primates ( Bailey et al., 2016 5. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Ghai, R.R. ...

Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2011; 1 :a006841 Crossref Scopus (864) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it is important to determine whether simian arteriviruses have the potential to infect humans ( Bailey et al., 2015 4. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Sibley, S.D. ...

Warren, C.J. ∙ Sawyer, S.L. How host genetics dictates successful viral zoonosis PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 , e3000217 Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar ). Akin to the example of HIV-1, there is no expectation of resistance in the human population because there are no related human arteriviruses that would give humans cross-protective immunity.

Section: Results

Most simian arteriviruses remain uncultured. The few cultured viruses are extremely finicky, replicating in only a handful of nonhuman primate cell lines ( Cai et al., 2021 9.

The best-known simian arterivirus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), was first cultured during a simian hemorrhagic fever outbreak among captive rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Primate Quarantine Unit in Bethesda, Maryland, USA ( Palmer et al., 1968 69.

SHFV presumptively entered the macaque population via incidental exposure to fluids from infected African patas monkeys ( Erythrocebus patas ) cohoused at this facility ( Dalgard et al., 1992 14.

Epizootiology, transmission and approach to prevention of fatal simian haemorrhagic fever in rhesus monkeys Nature. 1977; 268 :344-345 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). In vitro , SHFV can only be propagated to high titers on the grivet ( Chlorocebus aethiops ) embryonic kidney MA-104 cell line and its clonal derivatives, such as MARC-145 cells, and a few other cell types ( Tauraso et al., 1968 87. Tauraso, N.M. ∙ Allen, A.M. ∙ Palmer, A.E. ... Simian hemorrhagic fever. 3. Isolation and characterization of a viral agent Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1968; 17 :422-431 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yú et al., 2016 100. Yú, S. ∙ Caì, Y. ∙ Lyons, C. ... Specific detection of two divergent simian arteriviruses using RNAscope in situ hybridization PLoS One. 2016; 11 , e0151313 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ). Grivet cell lines that are routinely used for producing diverse viruses due to their inability to synthesize interferon (Vero cells and subclones) ( Desmyter et al., 1968 18. Desmyter, J. ∙ Melnick, J.L. ∙ Rawls, W.E. Defectiveness of interferon production and of rubella virus interference in a line of African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) J Virol. 1968; 2 :955-961 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ) are not permissive.
Virus entry into mammalian cells is mediated by cellular receptors. For SHFV, we previously found that pre-treating cells with an anti-CD163 antibody impeded infection ( Caì et al., 2015 8. Caì, Y. ∙ Postnikova, E.N. ∙ Bernbaum, J.G. ... Simian hemorrhagic fever virus cell entry is dependent on CD163 and uses a clathrin-mediated endocytosis-like pathway J Virol. 2015; 89 :844-856 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on this clue, we hypothesized that CD163 might be the cellular receptor. Indeed, we found that the relative abundance of CD163 in different grivet cell lines correlates with their relative abilities to produce infectious SHFV (high = MA-104, MARC-145; low = COS-7; none = Vero), potentially corroborating the importance of CD163 expression for SHFV infection ( Figure 2 A). We next generated CD163 knockout (ΔCD163) single-cell clones of grivet MA-104 cells and confirmed gene deletion ( Figure S1 ). We observed markedly reduced virus production in ΔCD163 cells under single-step and multi-step growth conditions ( Figure 2 B, open red circles). Stable re-complementation of these cells with grivet CD163 (gCD163) by retroviral transduction recovered expression and virus production in these cells ( Figure 2 B, closed black circles). Expression of grivet CD163 in Vero cells also resulted in significant virus production and observable cytopathic effects ( Figure S2 ). Primary skin fibroblasts derived from two different patas monkeys, the presumed natural host of SHFV ( Dalgard et al., 1992 14. Dalgard, D.W. ∙ Hardy, R.J. ∙ Pearson, S.L. ...

Lauck, M. ∙ Alkhovsky, S.V. ∙ Bào, Y. ...

Epizootiology, transmission and approach to prevention of fatal simian haemorrhagic fever in rhesus monkeys Nature. 1977; 268 :344-345 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), lacked detectable CD163 protein and also did not support virus production. However, stable complementation with patas monkey CD163 (pCD163) rendered cells permissive to infection by SHFV ( Figure 2 C). Finally, we confirmed that CD163 acts at the step of virus entry into the cell by transfecting ΔCD163 cells with cDNA-launch SHFV rescue plasmids ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), effectively bypassing the requirement of CD163 for cellular entry. Transfected ΔCD163 cells produced infectious SHFV but to lower titers, presumably because newly produced virions were incapable of spreading and infecting new cells that lacked CD163 ( Figure S3 ). Therefore, CD163 is necessary and sufficient for infection by SHFV, a finding that should enhance our ability to isolate and study other novel simian arteriviruses that have been historically difficult to propagate in vitro .
Several hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses that infect humans, such as Lassa virus, Lujo virus, and Ebola virus, use a unique mode of cell entry that involves intracellular receptors ( Carette et al., 2011 11. Carette, J.E. ∙ Raaben, M. ∙ Wong, A.C. ...

NRP2 and CD63 are host factors for Lujo virus cell entry Cell Host Microbe. 2017; 22 :688-696.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). After these viruses enter cells, they interact with a receptor embedded in the membranes of late endosomes/lysosomes. Successful engagement allows viruses to fuse with the endolysosomal membrane and enter the cytoplasm; otherwise the virus gets trapped and degraded. Likewise, we noticed that CD163 was undetectable on the surface of permissive primate cells but could be detected via intracellular staining, and that SHFV particles enter cells (non-productively) even in the absence of CD163 ( Figure S4 ). Thus, we hypothesized that CD163 may act as an intracellular receptor for SHFV. To test this hypothesis, we performed single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) ( Femino et al., 1998 23. Femino, A.M. ∙ Fay, F.S. ∙ Fogarty, K. ... Visualization of single RNA transcripts in situ Science. 1998; 280 :585-590 Crossref Scopus (1086) PubMed Google Scholar ) to detect viral RNA in cells. To perform smFISH, we tiled 48 DNA oligos antisense to the SHFV genome and then conjugated to each a fluorophore. Once hybridized to the viral RNA, the additive signal of these fluorescently labeled probes enabled the visualization of single SHFV genomes, either by flow cytometry ( Figures S3 and S4 ) or by microscopy. Using confocal microscopy, we observed smFISH puncta (viral RNA) inside both wild-type and ΔCD163 cells 1 h after exposure to virus ( Figures 3 A and 3B). The signal was transient in ΔCD163 cells and was absent by 4 h post-exposure ( Figure 3 B), consistent with flow cytometric analysis of similarly exposed cells ( Figure S4 ). By contrast, in wild-type cells, viral RNA persisted and began forming discrete cellular domains by 6 h post-exposure, likely identifying major sites of viral RNA replication ( Figure 3 A). SHFV particles can therefore enter cells in the absence of CD163, but viral genomes likely become trapped in intracellular vesicles and become degraded.
We next confirmed this finding in primary cells. We isolated monocytes from rhesus monkey whole blood and differentiated them into macrophages using macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Following a short exposure of primary rhesus monkey macrophages to SHFV, viral RNA co-localized with CD163 ( Figure 3 C). We calculated the association of each fluorescent channel and smFISH puncta (viral RNA) using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, a metric of co-localization ( Dunn et al., 2011 21. Dunn, K.W. ∙ Kamocka, M.M. ∙ McDonald, J.H. A practical guide to evaluating colocalization in biological microscopy Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2011; 300 :C723-C742 –C742 Crossref Scopus (1450) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found a statistically significant correlation of viral RNA with CD163, but not with Hoechst (DNA, nucleus) or occludin (cell surface protein) staining ( Figure 3 D). Further, orthogonal views of the z stack images showed smFISH puncta (viral RNA) and CD163 co-localizing within the upper and lower boundaries of the cell, and not at the cell surface, which confirmed the intracellular nature of this interaction ( Figure 3 E). These findings identify an unusual phenotypic similarity with other zoonotic hemorrhagic fever-causing viruses, i.e., the use of an intracellular receptor.
African primates are the long-term reservoir hosts for simian arteriviruses ( Bailey et al., 2016 5. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Ghai, R.R. ... Arteriviruses, pegiviruses, and lentiviruses are common among wild African monkeys J Virol. 2016; 90 :6724-6737 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kuhn et al., 2016 45.

Over evolutionary time, hosts and viruses compete in genetic “arms races,” during which each entity experiences natural selection in favor of genetic variants that give them the upper hand ( Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011 60. Meyerson, N.R. ∙ Sawyer, S.L. Two-stepping through time: mammals and viruses Trends Microbiol. 2011; 19 :286-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of receptors, primates are subject to natural selection in favor of mutations that impede virus entry, whereas viruses counter-evolve to regain optimal receptor usage. Indeed, signatures of accelerated evolution can be detected in many virus-receptor pairs ( Kaelber et al., 2012 40. Kaelber, J.T. ∙ Demogines, A. ∙ Harbison, C.E. ...

We found that CD163 has evolved under strong positive natural selection in primates ( Figure S5 ). Nine residue positions in CD163 bear this signature of rapid amino acid replacement over time. CD163 has nine “scavenger receptor cysteine-rich” (SRCR) domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail ( Law et al., 1993 51. Law, S.K. ∙ Micklem, K.J. ∙ Shaw, J.M. ... A new macrophage differentiation antigen which is a member of the scavenger receptor superfamily Eur J Immunol. 1993; 23 :2320-2325 Crossref Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ). SRCR domains 5 through 9 contain regions important to arterivirus infection ( Gorp et al., 2010 25. Van Gorp, H. ∙ Van Breedam, W. ∙ Van Doorsselaere, J. ... Identification of the CD163 protein domains involved in infection of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus J Virol. 2010; 84 :3101-3105 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Seven of the nine residues under selection map these domains ( Figure 4 A).
If primates are involved in a genetic arms race with arteriviruses, it is expected that primates of distinct species would encode receptors with radically different tolerances to any specific arterivirus. This is because each species takes a unique evolutionary trajectory in these battles ( Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011 60. Meyerson, N.R. ∙ Sawyer, S.L. Two-stepping through time: mammals and viruses Trends Microbiol. 2011; 19 :286-294 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). We evaluated this expectation by cloning CD163 orthologs from 15 different primate species and stably integrating them into ΔCD163 cells. These cells were then exposed to SHFV to see if they became infected ( Figure 4 B). As expected, SHFV entered most efficiently by engaging the CD163 ortholog of its presumed natural host, the patas monkey ( Figure 4 , black bar in graph). Similarly, based on known outbreaks among captive macaques, rhesus monkey CD163 also efficiently facilitated virus entry. However, there were large differences, spanning almost three orders of magnitude, in how well this virus used the CD163 orthologs of other species. The species-specific sequence differences that emerge in virus-receptor arms races have a beneficial side effect to the hosts; they serve as a genetic barrier to virus host switching ( Imai and Kawaoka, 2012 35.

Warren, C.J. ∙ Sawyer, S.L. How host genetics dictates successful viral zoonosis PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 , e3000217 Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar ). For instance, monkeys of some species are predicted to be resistant to SHFV, based on our finding that the virus does not enter cells efficiently through CD163 of these species ( Figure 4 B).
Consistent with recent findings that SHFV can replicate in primary cells of the common chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) and western gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla ) ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found that SHFV is fully compatible with all tested ape CD163 orthologs. Remarkably, this includes the human CD163 ortholog, which supported robust SHFV replication ( Figure 4 B). These findings are important because they confirm that SHFV has overcome the first hurdle of successful spillover to humans: SHFV virions are fully capable of entering cells expressing the human version of their receptor. If CD163 is involved in an evolutionary arms race with simian arteriviruses, then the surface glycoproteins of these viruses are counter-evolving as well—being constantly selected for variants with new receptor binding specificities that could enable them to use receptor orthologs encoded by animals typically resistant to infection.
Beyond the entry receptor, viruses depend on many host proteins inside of cells to support their replication cycles ( Han et al., 2018 29. Han, J. ∙ Perez, J.T. ∙ Chen, C. ...

Although little is known about the life cycle of simian arteriviruses, for other viruses critical human cofactors include proteases, trafficking proteins, etc. For simian arteriviruses to be a threat to humans, they need to be able to use the human orthologs of all the proteins that they require to replicate, and to bypass the interferon response that will be triggered in human cells. CD163 is expressed specifically in myeloid cells, like monocytes and macrophages ( Buechler et al., 2000 7. Buechler, C. ∙ Ritter, M. ∙ Orsó, E. ... Regulation of scavenger receptor CD163 expression in human monocytes and macrophages by pro- and antiinflammatory stimuli J Leukoc Biol. 2000; 67 :97-103 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fabriek et al., 2005 22.

CD163 positive subsets of blood dendritic cells: the scavenging macrophage receptors CD163 and CD91 are coexpressed on human dendritic cells and monocytes Immunobiology. 2006; 211 :407-417 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test for SHFV replication in primary human cells, monocytes derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three human donors were differentiated into M0, M1, or M2 macrophages ( Figure 5 A). We found all of these cell types refractory to SHFV, but susceptible to Ebola virus, which is known to infect macrophages ( Figures 5 B, 5C and S6 ). However, little is known about the precise myeloid-derived cell subtypes that SHFV favors ( Vatter and Brinton, 2014 89. Vatter, H.A. ∙ Brinton, M.A. Differential responses of disease-resistant and disease-susceptible primate macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells to simian hemorrhagic fever virus infection J Virol. 2014; 88 :2095-2106 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 1 (PRRSV-1, a suid arterivirus) primarily infects subpopulations of tissue-resident macrophages ( Duan et al., 1997a 19. Duan, X. ∙ Nauwynck, H.J. ∙ Pensaert, M.B.

Detection of European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in porcine alveolar macrophages by two-colour immunofluorescence and in-situ hybridization-immunohistochemistry double labelling J Comp Pathol. 2001; 124 :238-245 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) and less efficiently infects circulating (blood) monocytes and monocyte-derived cells ( Duan et al., 1997b 20. Duan, X. ∙ Nauwynck, H.J. ∙ Pensaert, M.B. Effects of origin and state of differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages on their susceptibility to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) Arch Virol. 1997; 142 :2483-2497 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus 1 (LDV-1, a murine arterivirus) has an extremely narrow specificity for a subpopulation of tissue-resident macrophages and is poorly cultivated in macrophages ex vivo ( Onyekaba et al., 1989 66. Onyekaba, C.O. ∙ Harty, J.T. ∙ Plagemann, P.G.

Stueckemann, J.A. ∙ Holth, M. ∙ Swart, W.J. ... Replication of Lactate Dehydrogenase-elevating Virus in Macrophages: 2. Mechanism of Persistent Infection in Mice and Cell Culture J Gen Virol. 1982; 59 :263-272 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further studies on the exact cells that replicate simian arteriviruses in vivo are needed, although studies of tissue-embedded immune cell subsets are notoriously difficult ( Lee et al., 2018 52. Lee, C.Z.W. ∙ Kozaki, T. ∙ Ginhoux, F. Studying tissue macrophages in vitro: are iPSC-derived cells the answer? Nat Rev Immunol. 2018; 18 :716-725 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on uncertainties of SHFV tropism in primary cells, we broadened our approach.
We next added SHFV to several human monocytic cell lines representing the cellular lineage prior to differentiation into macrophages. We included one monocytic cell line that is naturally CD163-positive (SU-DHL-1) and, as controls, two that are CD163-negative (THP-1 and U937) ( Buechler et al., 2000 7. Buechler, C. ∙ Ritter, M. ∙ Orsó, E. ... Regulation of scavenger receptor CD163 expression in human monocytes and macrophages by pro- and antiinflammatory stimuli J Leukoc Biol. 2000; 67 :97-103 Crossref Scopus (590) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, SHFV produced infectious virus in human SU-DHL-1 cells ( Figure 6 A). SHFV replication in human cells demonstrates that the compatibility of SHFV with humans extends well beyond the viral receptor and includes the human orthologs of all cellular proteins required for viral replication.
To further verify this highly unexpected result, we aimed to demonstrate replication of SHFV in a second human cell line. Previously it was shown that no adherent human cell line in a large human cell panel (the NCI-60 cancer panel) supported SHFV infection ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, CD163 expression is highly tissue-restricted to myeloid cells, and myeloid cells are not included in that panel. Indeed, western blotting revealed that none of the human NCI-60 cell lines expressed CD163 ( Figure S7 ). Consequently, we sought to test whether SHFV could replicate in any of these NCI-60 human cell lines if human CD163 was provided. From four randomly chosen cell lines tested, we found a human kidney epithelial cell line (ACHN) that supported replication of SHFV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (SHFV-eGFP) after it was stably transduced with human CD163 (hCD163; Figure 6 B). In fact, wild-type SHFV exhibited replication kinetics and viral titers on human CD163-expressing ACHN cells that were the same as those on the most permissive known primate cell line (MA-104; Figure 6 C). The virus replicated to high titers on these human cells, producing over 10 7 infectious virions per mL. ACHN cells are documented to be interferon-competent ( Shang et al., 2007 79. Shang, D. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Ito, N. ... Defective Jak–Stat activation in renal cell carcinoma is associated with interferon-α resistance Cancer Sci. 2007; 98 :1259-1264 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), leaving us to assume that the virus may escape the human interferon response. Thus, SHFV is able to replicate in human cells, can use the human orthologs of all necessary cofactors, and may bypass interferon mediated pathways of innate immunity. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that SHFV was recently shown to replicate in primary cells of the western gorilla and common chimpanzee ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), two apes closely related to humans.

Section: Discussion

We identified CD163 as the intracellular receptor for a primate arterivirus, SHFV. The expression of CD163 is restricted to myeloid cells such as monocytes and macrophages, where it plays an important role in human health ( Greaves and Gordon, 2005 28. Greaves, D.R. ∙ Gordon, S. Thematic review series: the immune system and atherogenesis. Recent insights into the biology of macrophage scavenger receptors J Lipid Res. 2005; 46 :11-20 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). When hemoglobin is released into plasma during red blood cell destruction, it is important that it is quickly removed due to the toxicity of its oxidative heme group. Tissue-embedded macrophages take care of this important process, primarily through their CD163 receptor ( Kristiansen et al., 2001 44. Kristiansen, M. ∙ Graversen, J.H. ∙ Jacobsen, C. ... Identification of the haemoglobin scavenger receptor Nature. 2001; 409 :198-201 Crossref Scopus (1388) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other mammalian arteriviruses have also been associated with CD163 and with tissue-resident monocytes and macrophages ( Calvert et al., 2007 10. Calvert, J.G. ∙ Slade, D.E. ∙ Shields, S.L. ...

CD163 is mostly localized intracellularly ( Gorp et al., 2009 24. Van Gorp, H. ∙ Van Breedam, W. ∙ Delputte, P.L. ... The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus requires trafficking through CD163-positive early endosomes, but not late endosomes, for productive infection Arch Virol. 2009; 154 :1939-1943 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nielsen et al., 2006 65.

The macrophage scavenger receptor CD163: endocytic properties of cytoplasmic tail variants J Leukoc Biol. 2006; 79 :837-845 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ), a common feature shared with many endocytic receptors that traffic between the cell surface and endosomes.
Intracellular processing of the SHFV glycoprotein(s) may be required before CD163 receptor binding can occur. Neutralization experiments utilizing purified soluble grivet CD163 did not prevent SHFV infection (data not shown). This lack of neutralization suggests that arteriviruses, as they circulate in the bloodstream, cannot bind CD163. Instead, we speculate that the unmasking of CD163 binding sites occurs within intracellular compartments. This may function as a mechanism to evade the humoral immune response, as has also been speculated for Ebola virus ( Miller et al., 2012 62. Miller, E.H. ∙ Obernosterer, G. ∙ Raaben, M. ... Ebola virus entry requires the host-programmed recognition of an intracellular receptor EMBO J. 2012; 31 :1947-1960 Crossref Scopus (268) PubMed Google Scholar ), and would be consistent with the observation of persistent arterivirus infections in monkeys ( Bailey et al., 2014a 2. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Sibley, S.D. ... Two novel simian arteriviruses in captive and wild baboons ( Papio spp.) J Virol. 2014; 88 :13231-13239 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 2014b 3. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Weiler, A. ... High genetic diversity and adaptive potential of two simian hemorrhagic fever viruses in a wild primate population PLoS One. 2014; 9 , e90714 Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar ). This finding has important consequences that need to be prospectively considered in risk scenarios: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which like SHFV is also a nidovirus, in contrast uses a receptor on the cellular surface (ACE2) for cell entry. To do so, SARS-CoV-2 needs to expose its receptor-binding domain prior to adsorbing to cells, thereby leaving it exposed to attack by neutralizing antibodies—the basis for current vaccine approaches. Viruses that use intracellular receptors expose their receptor-binding domains only once inside a cellular compartment. Thus, medical countermeasure development against such viruses is challenging, i.e., strategies that have been successful against SARS-CoV-2 may fail against arteriviruses.
Arteriviruses have been considered relatively obscure since their discovery. However, it should be noted that SIV, and in particular the chimpanzee variant most closely related to the pandemic strain of HIV, was also considered an “obscure” virus prior to its discovery in the early years of the HIV/AIDS pandemic ( Keele et al., 2006 42. Keele, B.F. ∙ Van Heuverswyn, F. ∙ Li, Y. ... Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 Science. 2006; 313 :523-526 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sharp and Hahn, 2011 80. Sharp, P.M. ∙ Hahn, B.H. Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2011; 1 :a006841 Crossref Scopus (864) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the propensity for RNA viruses such as SHFV and SIV to evolve and emerge, ignoring the threat that arteriviruses pose could be unwise.
Our results raise concerns for global health and pandemic prevention. Not only is the human CD163 ortholog compatible with SHFV entry into human cells, but all other cellular proteins required for SHFV replication are functional in human cells, as evidenced by SHFV titers of up to 10 7 infectious virions per mL ( Figure 6 C). Further, we have tested only one of the numerous simian arteriviruses that have been discovered in monkeys ( Bailey et al., 2014a 2. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Sibley, S.D. ... Two novel simian arteriviruses in captive and wild baboons ( Papio spp.) J Virol. 2014; 88 :13231-13239 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar , 2016 5. Bailey, A.L. ∙ Lauck, M. ∙ Ghai, R.R. ...

Historical outbreaks of simian hemorrhagic fever in captive macaques were caused by distinct arteriviruses J Virol. 2015; 89 :8082-8087 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). They all share the same genetic organization and considerable sequence homology, suggesting that all of them use a similar entry mechanism and that many of them could potentially use human CD163. Further, it appears that interferon-mediated pathways of innate immunity may be ineffective at blocking these viruses, which is concerning given that humans are predicted to be antibody-naive to arteriviruses. Animal studies are not needed before concern for humans is raised, because at least three different simian arteriviruses have already been shown (on numerous occasions) to cause fatal infection in some nonhuman primates.
It is possible that people in Africa are already subclinically infected with arteriviruses. Similar to HIV-1 infections that spread undetected for decades prior to virus discovery in the 1980s ( Korber et al., 2000 43. Korber, B. ∙ Muldoon, M. ∙ Theiler, J. ... Timing the ancestor of the HIV-1 pandemic strains Science. 2000; 288 :1789-1796 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ; Worobey et al., 2008 95. Worobey, M. ∙ Gemmel, M. ∙ Teuwen, D.E. ... Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 Nature. 2008; 455 :661-664 Crossref Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ), human arterivirus infections may already cause unmeasured disease. HIV-1-induced AIDS kills by secondary infections and hence was etiologically difficult to pinpoint. Simian arterivirus infection may result in a similar scenario, in subclinical infections, or in acute epidemics of hemorrhagic fever. Development of serology tests and other measures for human surveillance will be required to understand and detect human exposure to these viruses. These tools are needed in African regions where endemically infected nonhuman primates live.
Despite its breadth, this study has several limitations. SHFV is just one simian arterivirus. Virus stocks do not exist for other arteriviruses that have caused epizootics in the past (i.e., Pebjah virus [PBJV] and simian hemorrhagic encephalitis virus [SHEV]). This limitation prevented us from performing a more systematic study of simian arterivirus diversity. We speculated, based on previous studies, that patas monkeys are the natural reservoir host for SHFV ( Dalgard et al., 1992 14. Dalgard, D.W. ∙ Hardy, R.J. ∙ Pearson, S.L. ... Combined simian hemorrhagic fever and Ebola virus infection in cynomolgus monkeys Lab Anim Sci. 1992; 42 :152-157 PubMed Google Scholar ; Gravell et al., 1986 27.

Lauck, M. ∙ Alkhovsky, S.V. ∙ Bào, Y. ...

Epizootiology, transmission and approach to prevention of fatal simian haemorrhagic fever in rhesus monkeys Nature. 1977; 268 :344-345 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, additional viral surveillance of patas monkeys in the wild is required to determine whether or not they are a possible source of SHFV spillover to humans. Although SHFV-exposed primary human blood monocyte-derived macrophages were incapable of producing infectious virus, this does not provide direct evidence that SHFV cannot replicate in more specialized macrophage subsets. It is possible that alternative subpopulations of tissue-resident macrophages may support SHFV infection, like alveolar macrophages (the target for PRRSV-1 infection in pigs) or peritoneal macrophages (the target for LDV-1 infection in mice).

Nonhuman primate cell lines, including grivet ( C. aethiops ) embryonic kidney MA-104 Clone 1 (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA, #CRL-2378.1), MA-104 subclone MARC-145 (originally provided by Dr. Kay Faaberg, U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], National Animal Disease Center, Ames, IA, USA), grivet kidney fibroblast COS-7 (ATCC, #CRL-1651), and patas monkey skin fibroblasts (Coriell Institute for Medical Research [CIMR], Camden, NJ, USA, #AG06254 and #AG06116) were cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (EMEM; ATCC, 30–2003) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA, USA, TMS-013-B) and 1X penicillin-streptomycin solution (Pen Strep; Avantor, Radnor, PA, USA, #45000-652) (complete EMEM [cEMEM]). Human histiocytic SU-DHL-1 (ATCC, #CRL-2955), monocytic THP-1 (ATCC, #TIB-202), monocytic U937 (ATCC, #CRL-1593.2), and kidney cell lines ACHN, CAKI-1, 786-0, and A498 (obtained from the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis [DCTD] Tumor Repository, Frederick, MD, USA) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (ATCC, #30–2001) plus 10% FBS and 1X Pen Strep (complete RPMI [cRPMI]). HEK293T cells (ATCC, #11268) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; MilliporeSigma, Billerica, MA, USA, #D6429) plus 10% FBS, 1X Pen Strep, and L-glutamine (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA, #MT25005CI) (complete DMEM [cDMEM]). Grivet kidney Vero E6 cells (ATCC, #CRL-1586) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. All cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Hygromycin (Corning, #30-240-CR) selection was maintained throughout culture of the following cell lines, stably transduced with retroviral vectors: MA-104 (300 μg/mL), Vero (200 μg/mL), patas monkey skin fibroblasts (50 μg/mL), 786-0 and CAKI-1 (500 μg/mL), and ACHN and A498 (250 μg/mL). The NCI-60 panel of human cell lines was handled as previously described ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ...

Rhesus monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from rhesus monkeys housed at the Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research (KCCMR) in Bastrop, TX, USA. All blood collections performed for this study were approved by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (OLAW assurance number A3343-01) and were performed in strict compliance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8 th edition). PBMCs were seeded at >5x10 6 cells per well of a 6-well plate (CELLTREAT Scientific Products, Pepperell, MA, USA, #229105) and cultured overnight in cRPMI. The next day, cells were gently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Caisson Labs, Smithfield, UT, USA, PBL01-6X500ML) to remove non-adherent lymphocytes. Macrophages were cultured from adherent cells by incubation with cRPMI supplemented with 20 ng/mL human recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, #216-MC-010) for 5 days. Human PBMCs (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland, #4W-270A) were maintained in ImmunoCult-SF macrophage medium (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada, #10961), supplemented with 50 ng/mL human recombinant M-CSF (CSF1; R&D Systems, 216-MC) for 6 days to allow M0 macrophage differentiation. For M1 or M2 macrophage differentiation, M0 macrophages were treated with 50 ng/mL interferon-γ (IFN-γ; R&D Systems, 285-IF) or with 10 ng/mL interleukin 4 (IL-4; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA, H7291), respectively, for 2 days.
Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) isolate LVR42-0/M6941 (ATCC, #VR-533) ( Lauck et al., 2014 49. Lauck, M. ∙ Palacios, G. ∙ Wiley, M.R. ... Genome sequences of simian hemorrhagic fever virus variant NIH LVR42-0/M6941 isolates ( Arteriviridae : Arterivirus) Genome Announc. 2014; 2 , e00978-14 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and cDNA-launch systems for recombinant SHFV (rSHFV) and rSHFV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rSHFV-eGFP) were used as previously described ( Cai et al., 2021 9. Cai, Y. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Development and characterization of a cDNA-launch recombinant simian hemorrhagic fever virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein: ORF 2b’ Is not required for in vitro virus replication Viruses. 2021; 13 :632 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, for passage 0 (P0), a stock of SHFV was propagated in 1.75x10 7 MA-104 cells plated in 182-cm 2 flasks (CELLTREAT Scientific Products, #229381) using a MOI of 0.001 for 1 h at 37°C (5 mL of EMEM +2% FBS), with gentle rocking every 15 min. Inocula were then removed and replaced with 15 mL of 2% EMEM. Cell supernatants were harvested 3 days later (>80% cytopathic effect) and clarified by centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min at 4°C. This P1 stock was titered by plaque assay. Briefly, MA-104 cells were seeded at 3x10 5 cells per well in 6-well plates. The following day, cell culture media were removed, virus samples were 10-fold serial-diluted in EMEM, and 300 μL of diluted samples were added to the each well of cells, followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h, with gentle rocking every 15 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, and a volume of 3 mL of overlay medium (final concentration 1X phenol-free EMEM [VWR, #115-073-101] + 5% FBS + L-glutamine + 1.4% Avicel [Avicel RC-591 NF; FMC Corporation, Philadelphia, PA, USA]) was added to each well, followed by undisturbed incubation at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed/stained (final concentration 10% neutral buffered formalin [MilliporeSigma, #HT501128-4L], 0.2% crystal violet [MilliporeSigma, #C3866-25G]) for 15 min. Plaques were visualized following the removal of the fix/stain solution and gentle washing. From the P1 stock, a P2 stock, which was used for all downstream experiments, was generated by exposing MA-104 cells (MOI = 0.01) as described above. rSHFV and rSHFV-eGFP were rescued from plasmids by transfection of MA-104 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA, #L3000008). Briefly, cells were seeded at 3x10 5 cells per well in 6-well plates and, the next day, transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA. (Tube A contained 150 mL Opti-MEM [Thermo Fisher Scientific, #31985-070] and 4.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000; Tube B contained 150 μL Opti-MEM, 3 μg plasmid DNA, and 6 μL Lipofectamine p3000. Tube A was added to Tube B, mixed 5 min, and added dropwise to cells.) Viral titers peaked 3 days post-transfection. Ebola virus/H.sapiens-wt/GIN/2014/Makona-C05 ( Baize et al., 2014 6.

Cells were seeded in individual wells of 6-well plates and, the next day, exposed to SHFV or Ebola virus at the indicated MOIs (see figure legends). Cells were exposed to virus in a minimal volume of media (300 μL) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, with gentle rocking every 15 min. After incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and then maintained in cell-type-specific media supplemented with 5% FBS. Cell supernatants were collected at indicated times post-exposure. Viral titers were determined by standard plaque assays using MA-104 cells for SHFV ( Caì et al., 2015 8. Caì, Y. ∙ Postnikova, E.N. ∙ Bernbaum, J.G. ... Simian hemorrhagic fever virus cell entry is dependent on CD163 and uses a clathrin-mediated endocytosis-like pathway J Virol. 2015; 89 :844-856 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and Vero E6 cells for Ebola virus ( Logue et al., 2019 54. Logue, J. ∙ Vargas Licona, W. ∙ Cooper, T. ... Ebola virus isolation using Huh-7 cells has methodological advantages and similar sensitivity to isolation using other cell types and suckling BALB/c laboratory mice Viruses. 2019; 11 :161 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ). Plaque assays used overlays with final concentrations of 0.8% Tragacanth (MilliporeSigma, G1128) or 1.4% Avicel for SHFV and 1.25% Avicel for Ebola virus. At 2 days (SHFV) and 8 days (Ebola virus), overlays were removed, and plaques were counted.
Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (NP-40; 150 mM sodium chloride [NaCl; Promega, Madison, WI, USA, #V4221]), 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride [HCl] pH 7.4 [Teknova, Hollister, CA, USA, #T1075], 1% NP-40 [G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO, USA, #DG001], 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] [IBI Scientific, Dubuque, IA, USA, #IB21040], 1 μL/mL Benzonase [MilliporeSigma, #E1014]), and protease inhibitor mixture (MilliporeSigma, #11873580001). Briefly, cells were detached from tissue-culture plates by trypsin EDTA; Corning, Tewksbury, MA, USA, #25-052-CI) treatment, inactivated with FBS containing media, and then pelleted (300 x g for 5 min) and washed once with PBS. The cells were again pelleted, resuspended in NP-40 buffer, and incubated at 4°C for 30 min on a tube revolver rotator (ThermoScientific, #88881001). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. Whole-cell extracts were quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23227). Total protein (10 μg) was resolved with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using gels prepared with 10% Tris-glycine eXtended (TGX) stain-free acrylamide premixed gel solution (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA, #1610182) and by applying 180 V until protein-loading dye ran off the gel. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (MilliporeSigma, #IPVH07850) using a wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad Mini-Protean tetra and blotting module, #1660828EDU) set at 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked in 0.1% tris-buffered saline (TBS; Research Products International [RPI], Mount Prospect, IL, USA, #T60075–4000.0) + Polysorbate 20 (TWEEN 20; Amresco, Dallas, TX, USA, #M147-1L) (TBST) + Nestle Carnation 5% nonfat dried milk (Vevey, Switzerland) for 1 h at ambient temperature. Primary antibodies (goat polyclonal anti-CD163 antibody [R&D Systems, #AF1607] and mouse monoclonal actin beta (clone 8H10D10) antibody [mAb; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #3700S]) were diluted in TBST +5% nonfat dried milk and incubated either overnight at 4°C (anti-CD163 polyclonal antibody) or for 1 h at ambient temperature (actin beta [8H10D10] mouse mAb). After primary incubation, cells were washed three times for 5 min in TBST. Secondary antibodies—donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (H + L) cross-adsorbed horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A16005), anti-mouse IgG (H + L) HRP conjugate (Promega, #W402B)—were diluted in TBST +5% nonfat dried milk and incubated with the membrane for 1 h at ambient temperature. After secondary incubation, membranes were washed three times for 5 min in TBST, developed using enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) reagent (MilliporeSigma, #GERPN2232), and imaged on a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad).
CRISPR-Cas9 RNA (crRNA) targeting grivet CD163 exon 3 (AATGCGTCCAGAACCTGCAC) was synthesized and mixed with Alt-R trans -activating CRISPR-Cas9 RNA (tracrRNA; Integrated DNA Technologies [IDT], Coralville, IA, USA, #1072534) to a final duplex concentration of 44 μM. RNA duplexes were heated at 95°C for 1 h and cooled to ambient temperature. Cas9 nuclease, S. pyogenes (New England Biolabs [NEB], Ipswich, MA, USA, NEB #M0386M) was diluted with resuspension buffer R from the Neon Transfection System Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #MPK10025) to 36 μM in a 0.5-μL final solution, mixed with 0.5 μL of crRNA:tracrRNA duplex, and incubated at ambient temperature for 20 min. A total of 1x10 6 MA-104 cells were electroporated with two 30-ms pulses of 1,150 V using the Neon Transfection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #MPK5000). Electroporated cells were resuspended in cEMEM and incubated for 4 days in 12-well plates (CELLTREAT Scientific Products, #229111). Genomic editing in the bulk cell populations were confirmed using the T7 endonuclease 1 (E1) assay in the Alt-R Genome Editing Detection Kit (IDT, #1075931). Single-cell clones from the CD163 exon-3-edited bulk cell population were obtained by limited dilution cloning (0.5 cells per well in 96-well plates [CELLTREAT Scientific Products, #229196]). Genomic DNA from single-cell clones was screened by the T7E1 assay to identify edited clones. CD163 knockout was confirmed by western blotting, and clone “F11” was selected for all follow-up studies. Primers flanking the crRNA target site were used to amplify a small fragment of genomic DNA using a Phusion high-fidelity polymerase chain reaction (PCR) master mix with buffer (NEB, #M0531L). A-tailed PCR fragments were then TA-cloned via sequencing with the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #K457501). Successful insertion of a PCR product was confirmed by blue-white screening. A total of 15 independent plasmid clones from F11-edited and parental (MA-104) cells were Sanger-sequenced (Quintara Biosciences, Cambridge, MA, USA) and sequences analyzed using Sequencher DNA sequence analysis software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Biallelic deletions in clone F11 (ΔCACTG and ΔCA) resulted in a premature stop codon and ablation of CD163 protein expression (MA-104 ΔCD163) ( Figure S1 ).
Total RNA was isolated from the following cells: MA-104, Vero, patas monkey, human bone marrow (Takara Bio Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA, #636643), common chimpanzee ( P. troglodytes ) fibroblasts (Emory University, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, GA, USA, S008886), red-cheeked gibbon ( Nomascus gabriellae ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR00381), northern white-cheeked gibbon ( Nomascus leucogenys ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR00712), lar gibbon ( Hylobates lar ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR01131), collared mangabey ( Cercocebus torquatus ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR00485), black crested mangabey ( Lophocebus aterrimus ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR01215), primary rhesus monkey PBMCs (obtained from G. K. Wilkerson, Michale E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center), Angolan talapoin ( Miopithecus talapoin ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR00716), wolf’s mona monkey ( Cercopithecus wolfi ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR01241), François’ langur ( Trachypithecus francoisi ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR01099), mantled guereza ( Colobus guereza ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR00980), Nancy Ma’s night monkey ( Aotus nancymaae ) PBMCs (obtained from G. K. Wilkerson), and Bolivian red howler ( Alouatta sara ) fibroblasts (CIMR, #PR00708). cDNA was generated by reverse transcription with a Super-Script IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #18091200), and CD163 was amplified using a Phusion high-fidelity PCR master mix with buffer (NEB, #M0531L) with gene-specific primers. CD163 from these host cells was inserted into the Clontech pLHCX retroviral expression vector (Takara Bio Inc., #631511) using a Gibson assembly. Sequences are deposited as GenBank: MZ695198 to MZ695214 .
Murine leukemia virus (MLV; Retroviridae : Gammaretrovirus ) pseudotypes were generated as described previously ( Warren et al., 2019a 92. Warren, C.J. ∙ Meyerson, N.R. ∙ Dirasantha, O. ... Selective use of primate CD4 receptors by HIV-1 PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 , e3000304 Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated in cDMEM without antibiotics (1x10 6 cells per well in 6-well plates) and, the next day, transfected with 2 μg of pLHCX transfer vector (encoding CD163 receptor orthologs and hygromycin-resistance genes), 1 μg of pCS2-mGP (encoding MLV gag-pol) ( Yamashita and Emerman, 2004 97. Yamashita, M. ∙ Emerman, M. Capsid Is a dominant determinant of retrovirus infectivity in nondividing cells J Virol. 2004; 78 :5670-5678 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), and 0.2 μg of pCMV-VSV-G (encoding vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus glycoprotein “G”) (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA, #8454) using a 3:1 ratio of TransIT 293 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI, USA, #MIR2705) to DNA. At 48 h post-transfection, cell supernatants containing gammaretrovirus particles were collected, filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters (GVS Life Sciences, Sanford, ME, USA, #FJ25BSCCA002AL01), and stored at −80°C. For transduction, target cells were plated at ≈15% confluence and, the next day, exposed to gammaretrovirus-containing supernatant by spinoculation at 1,200 x g for 75 min in the presence of 3 μg/mL polybrene hexadimethrine bromide (MilliporeSigma, 107,689-10G). The following day, media were replaced with fresh media and, 48 h later, cells were placed in media containing hygromycin throughout their time in culture.
For each cell line analyzed, 1x10 5 cells were added to three wells of a 96-well v-bottom plate. Each well was handled as follows: well #1, unstained control; well #2, surface stain only; well #3, intracellular stain only. The cells were pelleted at 250 x g for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and then proceeded to surface staining. For surface stains, each well was handled as follows: wells #1 and #3, cells were resuspended in 50 μL fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (PBS +2% FBS +1 mM EDTA); well #2, cells were resuspended in 50 μL FACS buffer +1:25 dilution of APC-conjugated CD163 antibody (clone GHI/61, BioLegend, #333609). The cells were incubated at 4°C for 30 min in the dark and then washed three times with FACS buffer. The cells were then resuspended in 200 μL of fixation/permeabilization solution (BD Cytofix/cytoperm kit, #554714) and then incubated at 4°C for 20 min in the dark. The cells were then washed two times in 200 μL of perm/wash buffer (BD Cytofix/cytoperm kit) and then proceeded to intracellular staining. For intracellular stains, each well was handled as follows: wells #1 and #2, cells were resuspended in 50 μL of perm/wash buffer; well #3, cells were resuspended in 50 μL of perm/wash buffer +1:25 dilution of APC-conjugated CD163 antibody (clone GHI/61, BioLegend). The cells were incubated at 4°C for 30 min in the dark and then washed three times with perm/wash buffer. After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry.
A total of 48 probes (20 nucleotides in length, 2 nucleotides minimum spacing) were designed antisense to SHFV ORF1a using the Stellaris probe designer (Biosearch Technologies, Petaluma, CA, USA, https://www.biosearchtech.com/support/tools/design-software/stellaris-probe-designer ). Probes were then ordered according to a 96-well plate layout from IDT and directly conjugated with 2′,3′-dideoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate (ddUTP) and labeled with fluorescent dyes by combining the following reagents and incubating overnight: 10 μL 5X terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) buffer, 1 μL TdT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #EP0161), 5 μL probe mix (10 μL of each DNA oligo were pooled, and then 5 μL of these mixtures were used in the labeling reaction), and 3 μL 5-propargylamino-ddUTP ATTO 633 (Jena Bioscience, Jena, Thuringia, Germany, #NU-1619-633). Probes were incubated for 8 h at 37°C in the dark. Then, an additional volume of 0.75 μL TdT was added and mixed, and incubation was continued overnight (≈24 h total). To precipitate probes, 50 μL of 3 M sodium acetate (NaOAc; Amresco, #E498-200ML) and 400 μL of 100% cold ethanol (EtOH; Thermo Fisher Scientific, # 04-355-223) were added to each reaction, and then the samples were stored at −20°C for 30 min. Oligos were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C, washed two times with 70% cold EtOH, resuspended in nuclease-free water (IBI Scientific, # IB42201), aliquoted into single-use tubes, and stored at −80°C.
Wild-type MA-104 and MA-104 ΔCD163 cells were seeded onto acid-etched coverslips in 6-well plates at ≈80% confluency (2.1x10 5 cells per well). Primary rhesus monkey macrophages ( Figures 4 C and 4D) were seeded at 1x10 5 cells per well with 1 μg/mL poly-L-lysine-coated (MilliporeSigma, #P8920) for 1 h at 37°C on glass plates (DOT Scientific, Burton, MI, USA, #MGB096). Cells were exposed to SHFV (MOI = 10) or mock-exposed for the indicated duration. Following exposure, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA; VWR, #100504-85) in PBS (4% final concentration) undisturbed for 10 min at ambient temperature. Following two PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 (VWR, # JTX198-5) for 5 min at ambient temperature. Permeabilization solution was removed, and cells were washed once with PBS and then incubated with primary antibodies—mouse purified monoclonal anti-CD163 antibody clone GHI/61 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA, #333602) and/or rabbit polyclonal anti-occludin antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #71-150-0)—for 1 h at ambient temperature. Following three 10-min PBS washes, cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor-labeled secondary antibodies—goat anti-mouse IgG AF488+ (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA, #A32723) and/or goat anti-rabbit IgG AF546 (Invitrogen, #A11010)—for 1 h at ambient temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS for 10 min each and refixed as detailed above.
For smFISH, cells were washed twice with PBS and once with 1X Wash Buffer A (Biosearch Technologies, #SMF-WA1-60) following fixation. Cells were incubated with hybridization buffer (Biosearch Technologies, #SMF-HB1-10), containing smFISH probes (1-μL probe per 100-μL hybridization reaction), at 37°C for 16 h in the dark. Cells were then incubated with Wash Buffer A at 37°C for 30 min. Then, macrophages (plated on glass plates) were counterstained with Hoechst 33,342 dye for DNA and nuclei (Invitrogen, #H3570) at a 1:5,000 dilution in Wash Buffer A for 15 min at 37°C, while cell lines continued processing (on glass coverslips). Staining buffer was removed, the cells were washed once with Wash Buffer B (Biosearch Technologies, #SMF-WB1-20) for 5 min, and then either stored in PBS at 4°C (macrophages) or mounted onto glass slides (cell lines) using Prolong Gold Antifade Mountant with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific, #P36941). Mounted coverslips were cured for 2 days at ambient temperature prior to imaging.
Laser scanning confocal microscopy images were acquired on a A1R laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Metrology, Brighton, MI, USA) using a 1.45 NA 100x oil objective, 405/488/561/640 laser lines, and photomultiplier tube detectors. Z-stacks were collected at Nyquist resolution through the volume of several cells in each condition, and the acquisition parameters were adjusted to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for each image and condition. Image processing was performed using ImageJ analysis software ( Schneider et al., 2012 78. Schneider, C.A. ∙ Rasband, W.S. ∙ Eliceiri, K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis Nat Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (43944) PubMed Google Scholar ) (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD, USA). Maximum-intensity projections are shown for representative images in Figures 3 A, 3B, and 3C; single z-planes are shown for orthogonal images in Figure 3 E. Brightness and contrast were adjusted, when needed, to display the full dynamic range of each image. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis ( Figure 3 D) was performed with a custom MATLAB script that was adapted from ( Peters and Garcea, 2020 74. Peters, D.K. ∙ Garcea, R.L. Murine polyomavirus DNA transitions through spatially distinct nuclear replication subdomains during infection PLoS Pathog. 2020; 16 , e1008403 Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar ) and based on the image analysis practices outlined in ( Aaron et al., 2018 1. Aaron, J.S. ∙ Taylor, A.B. ∙ Chew, T.-L. Image co-localization – co-occurrence versus correlation J Cell Sci. 2018; 131 :jcs211847 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a percentile-based threshold was applied to each channel in each image. A PCC value was calculated for all co-localizing pixels in each pair of channels, reflecting the relative co-occurrence of the corresponding fluorescent signals throughout the z stack image. For imaging rSHFV-eGFP-infected cells, cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin (VWR, #16004-128) and stained with Hoechst 33,342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #H3570) 3 days after virus exposure. Images were taken by Operetta CLS (PerkinElmer, Dumfries, VA, USA).
Wild-type MA-104 or MA-104 ΔCD163 cells were either (1) exposed to SHFV ( Figure S4 ) or (2) transfected with SHFV-encoding plasmids ( Figure S3 ). At the indicated times following exposure/transfection, cell-culture media was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS. Cells were detached with trypsin, inactivated with FBS-containing media, and then transferred to individual wells of a 96-well v-bottom plate (NEST Scientific, Wuxi, China, #701211). Cells were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% PFA (VWR, #100504-858) for 10 min at ambient temperature. Cells were pelleted at 500 x g for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and then permeabilized with cold 70% EtOH for at least 1 h at 4°C. Cells were pelleted, washed once with Wash Buffer A, and resuspended in 50 μL of hybridization buffer containing probe (one 0.5-μL probe per 50-μL reaction). The plate was incubated in the dark at 37°C for 16 h. After incubation, 150 μL of Wash Buffer A were added. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 200 μL of Wash Buffer A, and incubated in the dark at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, cells were pelleted and resuspended in Wash Buffer B. Cells were pelleted once more and resuspended in FACS buffer (MilliporeSigma, #324506-100ML), comprised of PBS +2% FBS +1 mM EDTA. Samples were analyzed on an Accuri C6 Cytometer (BD, East Rutherford, NJ, USA). At least 50,000 live cell events were collected following singlet discrimination. Data was analyzed with FlowJo v10.8.0 (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
Sequences of 33 representative nidovirals were downloaded from a previously published analysis ( Nga et al., 2011 64. Nga, P.T. ∙ Parquet, M.del.C. ∙ Lauber, C. ... Discovery of the first insect nidovirus, a missing evolutionary link in the emergence of the largest RNA virus genomes PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 , e1002215 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches using RNA-directed RNA polymerase (RdRp) and helicase domains from SHFV were queried against simian arteriviruses, and multiple sequence alignments (using the Clustal tool in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis Version 7 [MEGA7] software with default parameters ( Kumar et al., 2016 46. Kumar, S. ∙ Stecher, G. ∙ Tamura, K. MEGA7: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 7.0 for bigger datasets Mol Biol Evol. 2016; 33 :1870-1874 Crossref Scopus (26018) PubMed Google Scholar )) were generated to identify and parse homologous regions for all simian arteriviruses. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the maximum-likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model ( Jones et al., 1992 39. Jones, D.T. ∙ Taylor, W.R. ∙ Thornton, J.M. The rapid generation of mutation data matrices from protein sequences Comput Appl Biosci. 1992; 8 :275-282 Crossref Scopus (5792) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tree with the highest log likelihood (−30036.74) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms using default parameters in MEGA7 ( Kumar et al., 2016 46. Kumar, S. ∙ Stecher, G. ∙ Tamura, K. MEGA7: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis version 7.0 for bigger datasets Mol Biol Evol. 2016; 33 :1870-1874 Crossref Scopus (26018) PubMed Google Scholar ) to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 44 amino acid sequences with a total of 746 positions in the final dataset. Bootstrap analysis was used to test the robustness of the tree topology (100 resamplings).
Gene sequences ( Figure S5 ) were aligned to the longest human isoform in MEGA Version 10 (MEGA X) for MacOS ( Stecher et al., 2020 83. Stecher, G. ∙ Tamura, K. ∙ Kumar, S. Molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) for macOS Mol Biol Evol. 2020; 37 :1237-1239 Crossref Scopus (1047) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the ClustalW alignment tool. Multiple sequence alignments were visually inspected, duplicate gene sequences were removed, and the gene isoform from each animal that best aligned to the human reference was retained for further analysis. Terminal stop codons were removed and aligned DNA and protein sequences were exported as fasta files. Codon alignments were generated using the PAL2NAL web server tool ( Suyama et al., 2006 86. Suyama, M. ∙ Torrents, D. ∙ Bork, P. PAL2NAL: robust conversion of protein sequence alignments into the corresponding codon alignments Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34 :W609-W612 Crossref Scopus (2144) PubMed Google Scholar ). Species cladograms for use in the PAML4.8 software package ( Yang, 2007 98. Yang, Z. PAML 4: phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood Mol Biol Evol. 2007; 24 :1586-1591 Crossref Scopus (9557) PubMed Google Scholar ) were constructed following the species-rank phylogenetic relatedness of primates ( Perelman et al., 2011 72. Perelman, P. ∙ Johnson, W.E. ∙ Roos, C. ... A molecular phylogeny of living primates PLoS Genet. 2011; 7 , e1001342 Crossref Scopus (961) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cladograms were generated using Newick-formatted files and viewed with Njplot version 2.3 ( Perrière and Gouy, 1996 73. Perrière, G. ∙ Gouy, M. WWW-query: An on-line retrieval system for biological sequence banks Biochimie. 1996; 78 :364-369 Crossref Scopus (1328) PubMed Google Scholar ). Codon alignments and unrooted species cladograms were used as input files for analysis of positive selection using PAML4.8. To detect selection, multiple sequence alignments were fit to the NSites models M7 (neutral model, codon values of dN/dS fit to a beta distribution bounded by 0 and 1), M8a (neutral model, similar to M7 but with an extra codon class fixed at a dN/dS value equal to 1), and M8 (positive selection model, similar to M8a but with the extra codon class allowed to have a dN/dS greater than 1). A likelihood ratio test was performed to assess whether the model of positive selection (M8) yielded a significantly better fit to the data compared to null models (model comparisons M7 versus M8 and M8a versus M8). Posterior probabilities (Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis) were assigned to individual codons with dN/dS values greater than 1.
Range data of simian arterivirus-infected African nonhuman primates ( Figure 1 C) were downloaded from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List ( https://iucnredlist.org/ ) as shapefiles and visualized in QGIS (v3.16.4) ( https://www.qgis.org/ ). Cartoon schematics were created using https://biorender.com/ .
Correlations between viral RNA and cellular markers by microscopy were determined using Pearson’s correlation analysis of the laser scanning confocal microscopy images. Data are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise indicated in figure legends. Experimental repeats are indicated in figure legends. Differences in means were considered significantly different at p < 0.05. Significance levels are: ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001; n.s., non-significant. Analyses were performed using Prism version 9.1.0 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
