Title: Cytomegalovirus subverts macrophage identity


Abstract: Summary

Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for millions of years, leading to remarkable host specificity and high infection prevalence. Macrophages, which already populate barrier tissues in the embryo, are the predominant immune cells at potential CMV entry sites. Here we show that, upon CMV infection, macrophages undergo a morphological, immunophenotypic, and metabolic transformation process with features of stemness, altered migration, enhanced invasiveness, and provision of the cell cycle machinery for viral proliferation. This complex process depends on Wnt signaling and the transcription factor ZEB1. In pulmonary infection, mouse CMV primarily targets and reprograms alveolar macrophages, which alters lung physiology and facilitates primary CMV and secondary bacterial infection by attenuating the inflammatory response. Thus, CMV profoundly perturbs macrophage identity beyond established limits of plasticity and rewires specific differentiation processes, allowing viral spread and impairing innate tissue immunity.

Section: Introduction

Host specificity of pathogens requires regulatory mechanisms between species to allow formation and preservation of ecological niches ( Elinav et al., 2011 20. Elinav, E. ∙ Strowig, T. ∙ Kau, A.L. ... NLRP6 inflammasome regulates colonic microbial ecology and risk for colitis Cell. 2011; 145 :745-757 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1279) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the case of the bacterial and fungal microbiome, regulation may occur on the population level ( Muegge et al., 2011 62. Muegge, B.D. ∙ Kuczynski, J. ∙ Knights, D. ... Diet drives convergence in gut microbiome functions across mammalian phylogeny and within humans Science. 2011; 332 :970-974 Crossref Scopus (1038) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, viruses with an intracellular lifestyle may rely on adaptations in the single infected host cell ( Pfeffer et al., 2004 71. Pfeffer, S. ∙ Zavolan, M. ∙ Grässer, F.A. ... Identification of virus-encoded microRNAs Science. 2004; 304 :734-736 Crossref Scopus (1219) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a β-herpesvirus, exhibits strict host specificity originating in co-evolution with mammals since ancient times ( McGeoch et al., 2006 57. McGeoch, D.J. ∙ Rixon, F.J. ∙ Davison, A.J. Topics in herpesvirus genomics and evolution Virus Res. 2006; 117 :90-104 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human CMV (HCMV) frequently infects humans in the first months of life. It enters the host via the intestinal or respiratory tract and establishes life-long persistence with alternating phases of latency and productive infection. CMV encodes for a plethora of gene products that serve to evade the immune system by intercepting, e.g., nuclear factor κB (NF-κΒ)-, interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-dependent signaling ( Le et al., 2008 45.

USA. 2006; 103 :3840-3845 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). It remains largely elusive how immune cells respond to the presence of CMV at the earliest stages of infection, when host immunity adapts to the permanent presence of the virus. Mouse CMV (MCMV) exhibits a remarkably similar pathogenic potential as HCMV. Thus, MCMV is commonly used to study CMV biology.
Macrophages are the most frequent immune cell type in barrier tissues. They rely on tissue-specific transcriptional and environmental cues (e.g., peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ [PPAR-γ] and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] in the lungs) and show varying renewal patterns ( Gosselin et al., 2014 29.

Med. 2013; 210 :1977-1992 Crossref Scopus (588) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within the tissue, macrophages are adapted to microanatomical structures, such as nerves and vessels ( De Schepper et al., 2018 16. De Schepper, S. ∙ Verheijden, S. ∙ Aguilera-Lizarraga, J. ...

A Subset of Skin Macrophages Contributes to the Surveillance and Regeneration of Local Nerves Immunity. 2019; 50 :1482-1497.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although differentiation of resident macrophages is largely unidirectional, plasticity needs to be retained to respond to challenges inherent to interfaces between host and environment. However, this plasticity is generally restricted to homeostatic or inflammatory polarization states within the limits of site-adapted macrophage identity ( Ginhoux et al., 2016 28. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Schultze, J.L. ∙ Murray, P.J. ... New insights into the multidimensional concept of macrophage ontogeny, activation and function Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :34-40 Crossref Scopus (351) PubMed Google Scholar ; Piccolo et al., 2017 72. Piccolo, V. ∙ Curina, A. ∙ Genua, M. ... Opposing macrophage polarization programs show extensive epigenomic and transcriptional cross-talk Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :530-540 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under homeostatic conditions, macrophages take up apoptotic cells and form immunomodulating cytokines (e.g., interleukin-10 [IL-10]) to maintain tolerogenic conditions. Simultaneously, macrophages are also first responders to intruding microbes. They ingest pathogens and promote recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and other immune cells.
Here we uncover that CMV induces dynamic immunophenotypic and functional changes in fully differentiated macrophages from distinct tissue; e.g., lung and colon. CMV-infected, bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages show transcriptional and proteomic features of stemness and increased motility and invasiveness. Moreover, CMV exploits the BM-derived macrophage cell cycle machinery at the expense of host cell proliferation. Overall, this process shares similarities with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including upregulation of the transcription factors ZEB1 and SNAI2. Importantly, CMV primarily infects alveolar macrophages in vivo . Respiratory infection with CMV leads to a dichotomy of transformed infected and activated bystander alveolar macrophages. Rewiring of alveolar macrophage identity-defining signaling processes facilitates viral spread and increases susceptibility of mice to bacterial infection.

Section: Results

To discriminate infected from uninfected cells, we engineered a MCMV strain that expressed GFP under control of viral M36 upon active replication (MCMV-GFP; Figure S1 A). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) infected with this construct showed GFP expression, indicating ongoing viral replication ( Figure S1 B). Upon intraperitoneal infection, MCMV-GFP reached high titers in the salivary gland 14 days post infection (dpi), indicating that reporter gene insertion did not alter the virulence and ability to disseminate ( Figure S1 C).
Next we analyzed MCMV-infected BM-derived macrophages by flow cytometry ( Figure 1 A) and fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1 B) and identified two distinct populations. Infected, GFP + macrophages exhibited a decreased surface area ( Figure 1 C) and increased circularity ( Figure 1 D) compared with non-infected bystander BM-derived macrophages. Importantly, BM-derived macrophage cultures were initially homogeneous after differentiation with M-CSF; i.e., residual monocytes were not present ( Figure S1 D). Moreover, MCMV-GFP infected macrophages isolated from distinct tissues, including intestinal macrophages, which are largely derived from definitive hematopoiesis, and yolk sac-derived microglia ( Figure S1 E).
Employing low infectious dosages, the number of GFP + BM-derived macrophages plateaued in the first 48 h of infection, in line with the slow replication of β-herpesviruses. Within 10 days, almost all BM-derived macrophages were infected ( Figures 1 E and S1 F). Foscarnet, a pyrophosphate analog viral DNA polymerase inhibitor, prevented CMV spread in BM-derived macrophages ( Figure S1 G). Notably, the emergence of infected BM-derived macrophages was dose dependent; i.e., a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) resulted in a homogeneous GFP + BM-derived macrophage population ( Figure 1 F). Because type I interferons (IFNs) have been shown previously to mediate resistance to CMV infection ( Gil et al., 2001 27. Gil, M.P. ∙ Bohn, E. ∙ O’Guin, A.K. ... Biologic consequences of Stat1-independent IFN signaling Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :6680-6685 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ), we analyzed type I IFN receptor-deficient ( Ifnar −/− ) mice. Although Ifnar - /- and wild-type (WT) BM-derived macrophages did not differ in initial infection rate ( Figure 1 F), bystander Ifnar −/− BM-derived macrophages were more prone to viral spread than WT cells ( Figure 1 E). This indicated that initial infection is a stochastic process in which bystander BM-derived macrophages are temporarily protected from viral spread via type I IFN. To verify that lack of GFP expression reflected an uninfected state rather than impaired MCMV replication, bystander macrophages were sorted 1 dpi and cultured further. A GFP signal was not detectable in bystander BM-derived macrophages up to 6 dpi, confirming that these cells were not infected productively by MCMV ( Figure 1 G).
CMV-infected BM-derived macrophages showed a substantially altered morphology (i.e., loss of their typical spread shape; Figures 1 B–1D), suggesting alterations in surface molecule expression. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that CD45, F4/80, CD11b, and CD64 were downregulated as early as 1 dpi ( Figures 2 A and 2B), following different kinetics ( Figures 2 C and S2 A). Moreover, total loss of cellular CD11b protein was observed ( Figures 2 C and S2 B). At 3 dpi, BM-derived macrophages were no longer identifiable as such, based on immunological markers ( Figure 2 D). These changes were independent of myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD88)- and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-mediated activation ( Figure S2 C) and independent of viral GFP expression ( Figure S2 D). To verify that the emerging cells indeed were macrophages, we constitutively labeled BM-derived macrophages of Cx 3 cr 1 creER ROSA26-Tomato flox mice by administration of hydroxytamoxifen (OH-TAM) before infection. Because of the incomplete recombination, we were able to distinguish GFP − Tomato − , GFP + , Tomato + and GFP + Tomato + BM-derived macrophages ( Figures S2 E and S2F). We found that both infected (GFP + ) populations changed their morphology and downregulated their surface markers to the same extent ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Moreover, MCMV substantially affected the characteristic immunophenotype of tissue-resident macrophages ( Figure S2 G). In intestinal and peritoneal macrophages, CD11b, F4/80, and CD45 were downregulated; alveolar macrophages lost CD11c and SiglecF expression; and microglia downregulated CD11b, MerTK, and CD64 after infection ( Figure S2 H). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated, next to viral particles ( Figure S2 I), a lack of membrane protrusions and filopodia ( Figure 2 E), increased cellular circularity ( Figure 2 F), and an elevated number of mitochondria ( Figure 2 G). In line with the latter, the maximal respiration rate was increased in infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figure 2 H). The loss of macrophage identity-defining parameters and the marked morphological changes suggested that CMV infection may affect key macrophage functions. Since their discovery over 130 years ago, macrophages have been defined by their ability to take up particles; i.e., phagocytosis ( Metchnikoff, 1883 59. Metchnikoff, E. Untersuchungen über die mesodermalen Phagocyten einiger Wirbeltiere Biol. Zent. Bl. 1883; 3 :560-565 Google Scholar ). Remarkably, MCMV-infected BM-derived macrophages completely lost the ability to phagocytose particles ( Figure 2 I) despite intact endocytosis ( Figure S2 J). Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine formation was abrogated with respect to the inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ( Figures 2 J and S2 K) and the regulatory IL-10 ( Figure 2 K). Together, CMV infection was associated with profound loss of macrophage identity.
To further dissect this transformation process, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of BM-derived macrophages 3 days after infection, when surface marker downregulation was at its maximum. Importantly, viral gene transcripts were not detectable in bystander cells at this time point ( Figure S3 A). This allowed us to compare cells cultivated in the same microenvironment, only differing in the intracellular CMV. Principal-component analysis (PCA) pointed to highly distinct transcriptomes in control, bystander, and infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figure 3 A). In CMV-infected BM-derived macrophages, over 3,600 and 3,900 genes were upregulated significantly compared with control and bystander BM-derived macrophages, respectively ( Figure 3 B). Genes associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including the keyword “macrophage,” were downregulated in CMV-infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figure 3 C). Furthermore, the expression of core transcription factors in macrophage lineage commitment and differentiation, such as Spi1 , Cebpa , Cebpb , and Irf8 ( Cain et al., 2013 10. Cain, D.W. ∙ O’Koren, E.G. ∙ Kan, M.J. ... Identification of a tissue-specific, C/EBPβ-dependent pathway of differentiation for murine peritoneal macrophages J.

While bystander BM-derived macrophages displayed a signature related to type I IFN activation and viral defense response, GO terms enriched in CMV-infected macrophages were associated with tissue development and morphogenesis ( Figure 3 E). Moreover, the majority of genes defining the GO term “stem cell population maintenance” was upregulated in infected compared with bystander macrophages ( Figure 3 F). In tissue macrophages, self-renewal is driven by upregulation of the stemness-inducing factors Klf4 and Myc and repression of the differentiation factors Mafb and Maf ( Aziz et al., 2009 4. Aziz, A. ∙ Soucie, E. ∙ Sarrazin, S. ... MafB/c-Maf deficiency enables self-renewal of differentiated functional macrophages Science. 2009; 326 :867-871 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, CMV decreased expression of Maf and Mafb and increased that of Klf4 ( Figure 3 G). In addition, Kit , Flt3 , and Bmi1 , which are typically expressed in hematopoietic progenitors ( Boyer et al., 2011 6. Boyer, S.W. ∙ Schroeder, A.V. ∙ Smith-Berdan, S. ...

Bmi-1 is required for maintenance of adult self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells Nature. 2003; 423 :302-305 Crossref Scopus (1537) PubMed Google Scholar ), were upregulated in CMV-infected BM-derived macrophages, indicating a stem cell-like phenotype ( Figure S3 B). In contrast, bystander BM-derived macrophages highly expressed Myc ( Figure 3 G).
Other Herpesviridae members have been found to modulate host protein expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms ( Rutkowski et al., 2015 83. Rutkowski, A.J. ∙ Erhard, F. ∙ L’Hernault, A. ... Widespread disruption of host transcription termination in HSV-1 infection Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :7126 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we performed time-resolved proteome analysis by mass spectrometry ( Table S1 ). We found increasing divergence of the proteomes from CMV-infected and bystander BM-derived macrophages with time ( Figure 3 H) and confirmed broad loss of macrophage-defining surface markers ( Figure S3 C). Moreover, the GO terms “regulation of IFN I” and “response to virus” were overrepresented in bystander macrophages, whereas infected macrophages showed enrichment of genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle, embryo development, stem cell population maintenance, and telomere maintenance ( Figure 3 I). The latter, again, corresponded to an increase in gene expression of telomere subunits at 3 dpi ( Figure S3 D). Overall, the proteome showed a strong correlation with the transcriptome data at 3 dpi ( Figure S3 E). This in-depth analysis suggested that CMV infection steered macrophages transcriptionally and translationally away from their identity-specifying characteristics to features of stemness.
Next to dendritic cells (DC), macrophages can also serve as antigen-presenting cells in tissues and lymph nodes and express co-stimulatory proteins to activate lymphocytes in viral infection. In line with upregulation of IFN-stimulated proteins, such as RSAD2, OASL1, and ISG15, bystander BM-derived macrophages expressed the co-stimulatory receptor CD40 and proteins involved in lymphoid cell interaction and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I loading ( Figures S4 A and S4B). In contrast, infected BM-derived macrophages did not process Ovalbumin (OVA) protein to stimulate T cell proliferation ( Figures 4 A). Notably, the capacity to present the OVA-derived peptide epitope SIINFEKL to CD8 + T cells was preserved in infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figure S4 C). Thus, CMV-infected BM-derived macrophages lose the ability to process proteins via the immunoproteasome while retaining MHC class I expression. In agreement with this, infected BM-derived macrophages showed broad loss of transcripts and proteins associated with the antigen-presenting machinery ( Figures S4 D and S4E), which may contribute to interference with MHC class I trafficking via viral gene products ( LoPiccolo et al., 2003 50. LoPiccolo, D.M. ∙ Gold, M.C. ∙ Kavanagh, D.G. ... Effective inhibition of K(b)- and D(b)-restricted antigen presentation in primary macrophages by murine cytomegalovirus J. Virol. 2003; 77 :301-308 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, proteins essential for peptide loading (i.e., TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP, and TAPBPL) were upregulated in bystander BM-derived macrophages, suggesting a role in antigen presentation ( Figure S4 E).
Next we performed time-resolved proteome profiling of MCMV-infected BM-derived macrophages. At early time points, proteins associated with macrophage activation, receptor internalization, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization were overrepresented, indicating an acute cellular stress response ( Figure 4 B). A second cluster with peak expression at 2 and 3 dpi comprised proteins involved in mitochondrial processes and redox signaling, supporting metabolic changes in CMV-infected macrophages ( Figure 2 H). In addition, proteins associated with chromatin processing, DNA-dependent transcription regulation, mitosis, and cell cycle were upregulated from 2–6 dpi ( Figure 4 B). Because stemness is closely connected to proliferation and differentiation potential ( Park et al., 2004 67. Park, I.K. ∙ Morrison, S.J. ∙ Clarke, M.F. Bmi1, stem cells, and senescence regulation J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113 :175-179 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wondered whether progenitor properties were acquired as well. However, no colonies were formed by infected BM-derived macrophages in colony-forming unit (CFU) assays, even under most permissive conditions ( Figure S4 F). This was in contrast to a steady increase in cell cycling proteins from 1–6 dpi ( Figure 4 C). CMV and other herpesviruses perturb cell cycle progression in fibroblasts, leading to G1/S phase arrest ( Lu and Shenk, 1996 52. Lu, M. ∙ Shenk, T. Human cytomegalovirus infection inhibits cell cycle progression at multiple points, including the transition from G1 to S J. Virol. 1996; 70 :8850-8857 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wiebusch et al., 2008 108. Wiebusch, L. ∙ Neuwirth, A. ∙ Grabenhenrich, L. ... Cell cycle-independent expression of immediate-early gene 3 results in G1 and G2 arrest in murine cytomegalovirus-infected cells J. Virol. 2008; 82 :10188-10198 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), but macrophages have not been studied in this context. Therefore, we dissected the cell cycle of control, bystander, and infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figure 4 D). Significantly more infected macrophages showed Ki67 accessibility, indicating active cell cycling ( Figure 4 E). The tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB1) and its family members retinoblastoma-like proteins 1/2 (RBL1/2) are potent regulators of cell cycle progression. Their phosphorylation allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F, leading to S phase progression ( Weinberg, 1995 106. Weinberg, R.A. The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control Cell. 1995; 81 :323-330 Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4171) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with phosphorylation of RB proteins in infected macrophages ( Figure S4 G; Table S2 ), RNA-seq analysis showed increased transcription of E2F target genes at 3 dpi ( Figure S4 H). This suggests that infected macrophages overcome G1/S phase arrest and initiate cellular DNA synthesis in early S phase via induction of polymerases and DNA replication-licensing proteins ( Figure S4 H). Alternatively, they may provide these proteins to MCMV for replication. To resolve this, we pulsed uninfected and infected BM-derived macrophages with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and found a high BrdU signal in bystander BM-derived macrophages (gate B) and a predominantly intermediate BrdU signal (gate A) in infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figures 4 F and 4G). To determine whether the DNA in BrdU + cells was of eukaryotic or viral origin, we analyzed cellular and viral proliferation. We found bystander BM-derived macrophages to increase and infected BM-derived macrophages to decrease slightly over time ( Figure 4 H), whereas extracellular and intracellular CMV DNA increased progressively ( Figures 4 I and 4J). Thus, BrdU intermediate events indeed represent MCMV particles, comprising less DNA. This observation was in line with the viral proteome data indicating a complete viral replication cycle of CMV in infected macrophages ( Figure 4 K). Furthermore, protein expression kinetics demonstrated a lytic cycle of MCMV infection because viral gene products clustered in immediate-early (cluster 3; e.g., ie1 and ie3), early (cluster 4; e.g., m152), early-late (cluster 1; e.g., m36, m37, and m45), and late (cluster 2; e.g., m94, m48, m47, and m50) groups ( Figure 4 K; Table S3 ). Finally, A- and B-type lamins were expressed and phosphorylated ( Figure S4 I; Table S2 ) in infected macrophages, implying remodeling of the nuclear envelope and chromatin structures, which is associated with viral nuclear egress ( Muranyi et al., 2002 63. Muranyi, W. ∙ Haas, J. ∙ Wagner, M. ... Cytomegalovirus recruitment of cellular kinases to dissolve the nuclear lamina Science. 2002; 297 :854-857 Crossref Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). In summary, CMV induced a stem cell-like state in infected macrophages to exploit and redirect the cellular equipment for DNA replication toward virus production.
Pathway analysis on RNA-seq and proteome/phosphoproteome data revealed signaling pathways associated with adhesion (cadherin, integrin, and focal adhesion signaling pathway), Wnt, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and Notch signaling were overrepresented in the transcriptome and phosphoproteome of infected BM-derived macrophages ( Table S4 ). Modulation of these pathways induces EMT in epithelial cells ( Fodde and Brabletz, 2007 23. Fodde, R. ∙ Brabletz, T. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cancer stemness and malignant behavior Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19 :150-158 Crossref Scopus (616) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2006 46. Lee, J.M. ∙ Dedhar, S. ∙ Kalluri, R. ...

Miettinen, P.J. ∙ Ebner, R. ∙ Lopez, A.R. ... TGF-beta induced transdifferentiation of mammary epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells: involvement of type I receptors J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127 :2021-2036 Crossref Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). EMT occurs during embryogenesis and in cancer metastasis. GO terms directly linked to mesenchymal transition and its regulation as well as GO terms related to EMT ( Gröger et al., 2012 30. Gröger, C.J. ∙ Grubinger, M. ∙ Waldhör, T. ... Meta-analysis of gene expression signatures defining the epithelial to mesenchymal transition during cancer progression PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e51136 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ) were overrepresented in the RNA-seq dataset ( Figures 5 A and S5 A). Moreover, the transcription factors Twist-related protein 1 ( Twist1 ), Zinc finger protein SNAI2 ( Snai2 ), and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 ( Zeb1 ) and their targets N-cadherin ( Cdh2 ) and Fibronectin ( Fn1 ) were upregulated in infected macrophages ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Importantly, this was not due to contaminating multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, as BM-derived macrophages expressed similar levels of transcripts when they were sorted before infection ( Figure S5 B). SNAI2, TWIST1, and ZEB1 orchestrate cellular reprogramming in embryogenesis and tumor progression, are associated with stemness, morphological, and functional changes ( Nieto et al., 2016 65. Nieto, M.A. ∙ Huang, R.Y. ∙ Jackson, R.A. ... EMT: 2016 Cell. 2016; 166 :21-45 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ), and have been linked to increased mobility and invasion ( Peinado et al., 2007 69. Peinado, H. ∙ Olmeda, D. ∙ Cano, A. Snail, Zeb and bHLH factors in tumour progression: an alliance against the epithelial phenotype? Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7 :415-428 Crossref Scopus (2365) PubMed Google Scholar ). To explore these features, we performed time-lapse microscopy. CMV-infected macrophages migrated longer distances and with higher velocity compared with control macrophages ( Figures 5 D and S5 C). Furthermore, they interacted with other cells and exhibited an altered, ameboid mode of migration with bleb formation ( Figure S5 D; Videos S1 and S2 ). In addition, only infected, but not bystander or control macrophages, migrated through the extracellular matrix in a transwell invasion assay with Matrigel-coated inserts ( Figures 5 E and S5 E). To test, whether the altered mobility promoted viral spread, we analyzed whether CMV dissemination occurred via cell-free virus released into the supernatant or via direct physical contact ( Figure S5 F). We found that CMV transmission by direct contact of infected macrophages to uninfected fibroblasts was substantially more efficient than via cell-free supernatant ( Figure 5 F). Additionally, CMV-neutralizing antibodies did not prevent intercellular viral spread ( Figure 5 F and S5 G), indicating that CMV disseminated via immediate contact of infected with uninfected cells.

Time-lapse microscopy of bystander (GFP−) and BM-derived macrophages infected with MCMV-GFP (GFP+), related to Figures 5D, S5C, and S5D Infected macrophages change their morphology and mode of migration (amoeboid, bleb-forming) with increased motility. Additionally, infected macrophages interact with uninfected, bystander macrophages. Images taken every 15 min between 1 dpi and 3 dpi.
To further specify the pathways contributing to macrophage transformation, we compared the proteome data with a database on mesenchymal transition, dbEMT, and constructed an interactive network with proteins present in CMV-infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figures 5 G and S5 H). This analysis supported the particular involvement of the TGF-β and Wnt signaling pathways ( Figure 5 H). Moreover, Wnt target genes and proteins were upregulated in infected compared with control and bystander macrophages ( Figures 5 I, S5 I, and S5J). In particular, we found integrin β3 ( Itgb3 /CD61) to be highly expressed in infected compared with bystander macrophages ( Figure S5 H), which was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 5 J). This identified CD61 as an endogenous reporter of the transformation process.
Wnt may signal via canonical and non-canonical activation. The non-canonical planar cell polarity pathway regulates the cytoskeleton and, therefore, cell shape via downstream Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling ( Wallingford and Habas, 2005 105. Wallingford, J.B. ∙ Habas, R. The developmental biology of Dishevelled: an enigmatic protein governing cell fate and cell polarity Development. 2005; 132 :4421-4436 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ). ROCK, on the other hand, has been linked to cellular contractility and bleb formation ( Coleman et al., 2001 12. Coleman, M.L. ∙ Sahai, E.A. ∙ Yeo, M. ... Membrane blebbing during apoptosis results from caspase-mediated activation of ROCK I Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3 :339-345 Crossref Scopus (908) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, we found that infected macrophages were more spread out and lost their circularity in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 ( Figures 5 K and S5 K). Further analysis of the protein network identified β-catenin, p300, and CBP of the canonical Wnt pathway as central hubs that interacted intensely with other proteins ( Figure 5 L). To explore these putative signaling knots, we inhibited the p300-β-catenin interaction with IQ-1 and the CBP-β-catenin interaction with ICG001 ( Kahn, 2011 41. Kahn, M. Symmetric division versus asymmetric division: a tale of two coactivators Future Med. Chem. 2011; 3 :1745-1763 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ). Blocking the Wnt pathway ( Figure S5 L) partially rescued CD11b expression and prevented CD61 upregulation on infected macrophages ( Figures 5 M and 5N) without affecting cell viability or numbers ( Figures S5 M and S5N). In contrast, interfering with TGF-β signaling did not reverse CMV-induced BM-derived macrophage transformation ( Figure S5 O). β-Catenin activates the Zeb1 promotor via the lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor (LEF/TCF) transcription factors ( Sánchez-Tilló et al., 2015 86. Sánchez-Tilló, E. ∙ de Barrios, O. ∙ Valls, E. ... ZEB1 and TCF4 reciprocally modulate their transcriptional activities to regulate Wnt target gene expression Oncogene. 2015; 34 :5760-5770 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), subsequently, inducing invasion ( Burk et al., 2008 9. Burk, U. ∙ Schubert, J. ∙ Wellner, U. ... A reciprocal repression between ZEB1 and members of the miR-200 family promotes EMT and invasion in cancer cells EMBO Rep. 2008; 9 :582-589 Crossref Scopus (1309) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sánchez-Tilló et al., 2011 85.

USA. 2011; 108 :19204-19209 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analysis of BM-derived macrophages from LysM cre/+ : Zeb1 flox/flox mice, in which exon 6 of Zeb1 is deleted in myeloid cells ( Brabletz et al., 2017 7. Brabletz, S. ∙ Lasierra Losada, M. ∙ Schmalhofer, O. ... Generation and characterization of mice for conditional inactivation of Zeb1 Genesis. 2017; 55 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealed that fewer Zeb1-deficient than WT macrophages invaded Matrigel upon CMV infection ( Figure 5 O). Notably, mesenchymal markers and matrix metalloprotease 2 ( Mmp2 ) were expressed at slightly but not significantly lower levels in infected macrophages lacking Zeb1 compared with controls ( Figure S5 P). Moreover, Zeb1 deletion did not influence the low expression of the related Zeb2 in infected BM-derived macrophages ( Figure S5 P). Finally, human monocyte-derived macrophages similarly upregulated AXIN2 , SOX9 , ZEB1 , SNAI2 , and CDH2 transcription after infection with the HCMV strain TB40-SE-GFP ( Figure 5 P). Our data suggest that CMV-induced Wnt signaling leads to increased mobility and invasiveness of BM-derived macrophages, which is in part mediated by Zeb1.
Finally, we explored whether CMV reprograms alveolar macrophages in vivo after intranasal infection ( Figure 6 A). At 1 dpi, most of the infected cells in the lungs were CD11b int , CD11c + ( Figures 6 B and 6C), representing alveolar macrophages or dendritic cells. To elucidate the role of CD11c + cells in this model, we infected Itgax cre/+ mice with MCMV-floxGFP. Thus, infected cells expressed GFP only when CMV passed through CD11c + cells ( Figure S6 A). 93% (±0.88%) of all GFP + cells showed CD11c, SiglecF, and CD64 but not CD103 expression 12 hpi ( Figures 6 D and S6 B). Therefore, alveolar macrophages were the predominant target cells early after respiratory infection with CMV. In agreement with the in vitro and ex vivo data ( Figures 2 A–2D and S2 H), MCMV-infected alveolar macrophages downregulated CD11c, SiglecF, and CD64 ( Figures 6 E, 6F and S6 C). We next performed RNA-seq of in-vivo -infected alveolar macrophages 3 dpi. To assure that GFP + cells were indeed alveolar macrophages, despite the loss of surface markers after infection, we infected Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox mice with MCMV-floxGFP. Thus, CD11c + alveolar macrophages were labeled endogenously (Tomato + ), and infected alveolar macrophages harbored both fluorescent proteins (GFP + Tomato + ) ( Figures 6 G and S6 D). PCA revealed a distinct transcriptome of infected macrophages ( Figure 6 H) because key transcription factors for alveolar macrophage fate determination (e.g., Pparg ; Schneider et al., 2014 89. Schneider, C. ∙ Nobs, S.P. ∙ Kurrer, M. ... Induction of the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ by the cytokine GM-CSF is critical for the differentiation of fetal monocytes into alveolar macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :1026-1037 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ) and tissue maintenance (e.g., Zeb2 ; Scott et al., 2018 90. Scott, C.L. ∙ T’Jonck, W. ∙ Martens, L. ... The Transcription Factor ZEB2 Is Required to Maintain the Tissue-Specific Identities of Macrophages Immunity. 2018; 49 :312-325.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as typical markers were strongly downregulated ( Figures 6 I, 6J and S6 E). Similarly, expression of characteristic gene sets in alveolar macrophages ( Gautier et al., 2012 26. Gautier, E.L. ∙ Shay, T. ∙ Miller, J. ..., Immunological Genome Consortium Gene-expression profiles and transcriptional regulatory pathways that underlie the identity and diversity of mouse tissue macrophages Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :1118-1128 Crossref Scopus (1180) PubMed Google Scholar ) was no longer detectable in infected alveolar macrophages ( Figure 6 K). Overall, the transcriptional profile of infected alveolar macrophages showed a strong correlation with infected BM-derived macrophages, whereas control and bystander macrophages correlated weakly with their in vitro counterparts, again indicating that infection with CMV overrides the inherent profile of tissue macrophages ( Figure S6 F). Next we analyzed key effector molecules, which we had identified previously in vitro . We found Wnt target genes, N-cadherin, as well as Snai2 and Zeb1 to be upregulated in infected alveolar macrophages in vivo ( Figure 6 L). Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed involvement of Wnt signaling and genes associated with EMT in infected alveolar macrophages, whereas bystander alveolar macrophages showed an IFN signature and NF-κB activation ( Figures 6 M and S6 G). Finally, CMV-infected alveolar macrophages could be identified by Itgb3 /CD61 expression as an immunophenotypic hallmark ( Figures 6 F, 6N, 6O, and S6 H).
In respiratory infection, MCMV primarily targeted and perturbed alveolar macrophage lineage identity via downregulation of signature surface markers and increased expression of mesenchymal markers and activation of the transcription factors Snai2 and Zeb1 .
Tissue macrophages and their environment interact reciprocally; i.e., macrophages perform essential and niche-specific functions to shape and maintain tissue integrity. On the other hand, the immediate environment affects macrophage phenotype and function, especially after infection ( Guilliams and Svedberg, 2021 31. Guilliams, M. ∙ Svedberg, F.R. Does tissue imprinting restrict macrophage plasticity? Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22 :118-127 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ; Guilliams et al., 2020 33. Guilliams, M. ∙ Thierry, G.R. ∙ Bonnardel, J. ... Establishment and Maintenance of the Macrophage Niche Immunity. 2020; 52 :434-451 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we assessed alveolar macrophage population dynamics by infecting Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox mice with MCMV-floxGFP and analyzed bystander (Tomato + ) and infected (GFP + Tomato + ) alveolar macrophages ( Figure 7 A). Interestingly, GFP + Tomato − cells, which represented cells newly infected by virus originating from cre-expressing cells, increased steadily in number from 3 dpi onward, indicating secondary viral spread from alveolar macrophages to other cells ( Figure 7 A). To analyze the fate of infected alveolar macrophages, we sorted alveolar macrophages from MCMV-infected Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox mice and transferred them intratracheally into WT mice ( Figure S7 A). Notably, the number of transferred infected alveolar macrophages remained stable for up to 6 days ( Figure S7 B).
To test whether MCMV infection increases the invasiveness of alveolar macrophages in vivo , similar to the situation in vitro , we intratracheally administered SiglecF and CD61 antibodies to label bystander (SiglecF) and infected (CD61) alveolar macrophages in the airways ( Figure 7 B). We found less efficient labeling of infected compared with bystander alveolar macrophages ( Figure 7 C). Thus, a fraction of infected alveolar macrophages appeared to invade the lung tissue. To confirm the interstitial translocation of alveolar macrophages, we transferred sorted alveolar macrophages from Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox mice into Csf2rb −/− mice, which are devoid of endogenous alveolar macrophages. 8 weeks after the transfer, when the lungs were repopulated with Tomato + alveolar macrophages, mice were infected with MCMV ( Figure S7 C). Importantly, in the reconstituted Csf2rb −/− mice, exclusively alveolar macrophages express the Cre recombinase; i.e., they are Tomato + and recombine MCMV-floxGFP. Lung histology revealed that infected GFP + Tomato + alveolar macrophages can be found in the interstitium already at 1 dpi ( Figures 7 D and S7 D).
Notably, we found some GFP + cells in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes in Itgax cre/+ mice infected with MCMV-floxGFP at 1 dpi ( Figure 7 E), and the majority of these cells were labeled endogenously with Tomato after infection of Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox mice ( Figure 7 F). To analyze the origin of these cells, we employed Csf2rb −/− mice reconstituted with Tomato + alveolar macrophages ( Figure S7 C) and found GFP + Tomato + alveolar macrophages in the draining lymph nodes ( Figures S7 E and S7F). Accordingly, a small number of CMV-infected alveolar macrophages translocate to relatively distant sites.
Because we identified ZEB1 to be essential for MCMV-induced BM-derived macrophage invasion in vitro , we next explored its role in alveolar macrophage migration during MCMV infection in vivo . In full support of the in vitro data, we found a reduced number of GFP + cells in the lymph nodes of intranasally MCMV-infected LysM cre/+ : Zeb1 flox/flox mice compared with infected control mice ( Figure 7 G). Of note, ZEB1 deficiency did not substantially alter the number of infected cells ( Figure S7 G). Similarly to Itgax cre/+ mice ( Figures 6 D and S6 B), only alveolar macrophages and not CD103 + DCs were initially infected in LysM cre/+ mice ( Figure S7 H). Moreover, neutrophils and especially monocytes, which also express LysM , were not targeted by CMV at early stages ( Figure S7 I).
Finally, RNA-seq of MCMV-infected alveolar macrophages (3 dpi) revealed differentially expressed genes in infected LysM cre/+ compared with infected alveolar macrophages from LysM cre/+ :Zeb1 flox/flox mice with overrepresentation in GO terms associated with regulation of cell migration (GO0030334), immune response (GO0006955), response to oxygen compound (GO1901700), and cellular response to IFN beta (GO0035458) ( Figure S7 J).
Thus, MCMV-infected alveolar macrophages promote viral spread in the lungs and potentially other tissues via invasion of the lung interstitium and, in some cases, the draining lymph nodes in a ZEB1-dependent fashion.
One of the hallmark functions of alveolar macrophages is phagocytic clearance of constantly produced surfactant. To analyze the phagocytic capacity of infected alveolar macrophages, we applied the fluorescent dye PKH26 intranasally 2 dpi ( Neupane et al., 2020 64. Neupane, A.S. ∙ Willson, M. ∙ Chojnacki, A.K. ... Patrolling Alveolar Macrophages Conceal Bacteria from the Immune System to Maintain Homeostasis Cell. 2020; 183 :110-125.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 H). We found markedly reduced uptake of PKH26 in infected alveolar macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung homogenates compared with bystander and uninfected alveolar macrophages ( Figures 7 I). Moreover, components of surfactant (i.e., cholesterol and phospholipids) accumulated in the BAL fluid ( Figure 7 J).
In the postnatal period, when CMV infection is usually established, the immune system encounters numerous microorganisms and other viruses for the first time and needs to establish an appropriate immune response. Therefore, we further explored the functional consequences of CMV-induced alveolar macrophage transformation and analyzed the response to secondary challenges. First, we administered poly(I:C), an RNA analog to mimic infection with RNA viruses, intranasally 3 days after CMV infection and analyzed sorted macrophage subsets 8 h later ( Figure 7 K). In contrast to bystander alveolar macrophages, infected alveolar macrophages did not form NF-κB- and IFN-mediated cytokines ( Figures 7 L, 7M, and S7 K). Next we infected mice with Legionella pneumophila ( Lp ), a frequent environmental inhabitant and cause of severe pneumonia in humans that has been shown to target alveolar macrophages ( Chandler et al., 1977 11. Chandler, F.W. ∙ Hicklin, M.D. ∙ Blackmon, J.A. Demonstration of the agent of Legionnaires’ disease in tissue N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297 :1218-1220 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Fraser et al., 1977 24. Fraser, D.W. ∙ Tsai, T.R. ∙ Orenstein, W. ... Legionnaires’ disease: description of an epidemic of pneumonia N. Engl. J. Med. 1977; 297 :1189-1197 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Ziltener et al., 2016 116. Ziltener, P. ∙ Reinheckel, T. ∙ Oxenius, A. Neutrophil and Alveolar Macrophage-Mediated Innate Immune Control of Legionella pneumophila Lung Infection via TNF and ROS PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12 :e1005591 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 N). In full accordance with the notion that CMV profoundly remodels the first-line macrophage response, we found mice in which approximately half of the alveolar macrophage population was infected with CMV ( Figure S7 L) to be severely impaired in their antibacterial response because they failed to reduce the bacterial load in the lungs ( Figure 7 O) and lost weight continuously ( Figure 7 P). In contrast, mice only infected with Lp recovered after 3 dpi. Strikingly, the lungs of CMV- Lp -infected mice showed decreased numbers of neutrophils, which are important for bacterial clearance and alveolar macrophage activation in bacterial infection ( Tateda et al., 2001 98. Tateda, K. ∙ Moore, T.A. ∙ Deng, J.C. ... Early recruitment of neutrophils determines subsequent T1/T2 host responses in a murine model of Legionella pneumophila pneumonia J. Immunol. 2001; 166 :3355-3361 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 7 Q). In contrast to the lungs, neutrophil numbers in the peripheral blood were elevated early after secondary bacterial infection ( Figure S7 M). This suggested impaired chemokine production by CMV-infected alveolar macrophages. Therefore, we sorted alveolar macrophage populations after infection with a dsRed-expressing reporter Lp strain, which allowed us to distinguish CMV-infected (GFP + ) and uninfected (GFP − ) as well as Lp -infected (dsRed + ) and uninfected (dsRed − ) alveolar macrophages. Notably, CMV-infected alveolar macrophages did not take up Lp , in line with the phagocytic impairment of infected alveolar macrophages ( Figure 7 I). Moreover, cytokines and the neutrophil chemoattractants Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 were strongly reduced in acute CMV-infected alveolar macrophages after bacterial infection ( Figures 7 R and S7 N). Altogether, CMV specifically targets alveolar macrophages, alters their physiological functions, and affects the outcome of secondary infections.

Section: Discussion

Early postnatal infection links CMV to development of the individual immune system in most humans worldwide. In this study, analysis of a virulent GFP reporter MCMV enabled us to resolve the effect of CMV infection on macrophage-autonomous immunity in vitro and in vivo . Previously, downregulation of individual surface proteins (e.g., natural killer [NK] cell ligands) has been reported upon CMV infection, mainly in fibroblasts, but also in macrophages ( Lenac et al., 2006 47.

A mouse cytomegalovirus glycoprotein retains MHC class I complexes in the ERGIC/cis-Golgi compartments Immunity. 1997; 6 :57-66 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, macrophages show dysfunctional behavior after CMV infection ( Pesanti and Shanley, 1984 70. Pesanti, E.L. ∙ Shanley, J.D. Murine cytomegalovirus-induced macrophage dysfunction J. Leukoc. Biol. 1984; 36 :133-141 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shanley and Pesanti, 1980 91. Shanley, J.D. ∙ Pesanti, E.L. Replication of murine cytomegalovirus in lung macrophages: effect of phagocytosis of bacteria Infect. Immun. 1980; 29 :1152-1159 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the underlying mechanism and the extent of these changes had not been resolved. Based on large-scale and kinetic transcriptome and proteome analyses, we uncovered that surface protein downregulation is not only mere avoidance of receptor-ligand interaction but part of a complete rewiring process in infected macrophages. The transcriptional and translational changes in infected macrophages differ from previously described changes of the polarization state in differentiated macrophages and represent a novel, ambiguous cell state. Notably, CMV-transformed macrophages do not suffer from host shutoff, as reported for other herpesviruses ( Kwong and Frenkel, 1987 44. Kwong, A.D. ∙ Frenkel, N. Herpes simplex virus-infected cells contain a function(s) that destabilizes both host and viral mRNAs Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84 :1926-1930 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Rowe et al., 2007 79. Rowe, M. ∙ Glaunsinger, B. ∙ van Leeuwen, D. ...

USA. 2007; 104 :3366-3371 Crossref Scopus (163) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mechanistically, Wnt signaling is at the heart of macrophage transformation by CMV. Inhibition of the interaction of p300- and CBP/β-catenin as well as ROCK partially rescued macrophage reprogramming, suggesting involvement of the canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways. Wnt pathway engagement induces ZEB1 ( Kahlert et al., 2012 40. Kahlert, U.D. ∙ Maciaczyk, D. ∙ Doostkam, S. ... Activation of canonical WNT/β-catenin signaling enhances in vitro motility of glioblastoma cells by activation of ZEB1 and other activators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Cancer Lett. 2012; 325 :42-53 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yang et al., 2015 109. Yang, X. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Huang, Q. ... Wnt signaling through Snail1 and Zeb1 regulates bone metastasis in lung cancer Am. J. Cancer Res. 2015; 5 :748-755 PubMed Google Scholar ), which, in turn, enhances cellular transformation and Wnt target gene expression by interaction with p300 ( Sánchez-Tilló et al., 2015 86. Sánchez-Tilló, E. ∙ de Barrios, O. ∙ Valls, E. ... ZEB1 and TCF4 reciprocally modulate their transcriptional activities to regulate Wnt target gene expression Oncogene. 2015; 34 :5760-5770 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting a positive feedback loop. Moreover, it induces stemness and invasion ( Burk et al., 2008 9. Burk, U. ∙ Schubert, J. ∙ Wellner, U. ... A reciprocal repression between ZEB1 and members of the miR-200 family promotes EMT and invasion in cancer cells EMBO Rep. 2008; 9 :582-589 Crossref Scopus (1309) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wellner et al., 2009 107. Wellner, U. ∙ Schubert, J. ∙ Burk, U.C. ... The EMT-activator ZEB1 promotes tumorigenicity by repressing stemness-inhibiting microRNAs Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11 :1487-1495 Crossref Scopus (1265) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because conditional disruption of Zeb1 prevented CMV-induced macrophage invasiveness without affecting other phenotypical changes, conserved pathways such as Notch and TGF-β might also be involved. This is supported by our pathway analysis because TGF-β signaling might be activated downstream of TGF-β receptor I in CMV infection. Wnt pathway-related soluble factors have been identified previously as biomarkers in CMV reactivation after solid organ transplantation ( Ueland et al., 2014 102. Ueland, T. ∙ Rollag, H. ∙ Hartmann, A. ... Secreted Wnt antagonists during eradication of cytomegalovirus infection in solid organ transplant recipients Am. J. Transplant. 2014; 14 :210-215 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together with our finding that human monocyte-derived macrophages upregulate Wnt-target genes, ZEB1 and SNAI2 , upon HCMV infection, this points toward a conserved role of the Wnt pathway in CMV infection. Importantly, our in vivo results uncover a central role of alveolar macrophages in CMV infection. A portion of infected alveolar macrophages invade the lung tissue and may initiate formation of nodular inflammatory foci with delayed viral clearance ( Stahl et al., 2013 94. Stahl, F.R. ∙ Heller, K. ∙ Halle, S. ... Nodular inflammatory foci are sites of T cell priming and control of murine cytomegalovirus infection in the neonatal lung PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003828 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, infected alveolar macrophages may seed CMV to distal sites (i.e., the draining lymph nodes), which has also been described for dendritic cells ( Farrell et al., 2017 21. Farrell, H.E. ∙ Bruce, K. ∙ Lawler, C. ... Murine Cytomegalovirus Spreads by Dendritic Cell Recirculation mBio. 2017; 8 e01264–17 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, here we establish that alveolar macrophages and not dendritic cells are initially infected in pulmonary MCMV infection. Moreover, analysis of BM-derived macrophage number after infection in vitro and transfer of infected alveolar macrophages did not provide any evidence for early cell death, which could provide viral antigen (and GFP) for cross-presentation by dendritic cells. This is probably due to MCMV-encoding proteins, which inhibit early necroptosis and apoptosis specifically in macrophages ( Daley-Bauer et al., 2017 15. Daley-Bauer, L.P. ∙ Roback, L. ∙ Crosby, L.N. ... Mouse cytomegalovirus M36 and M45 death suppressors cooperate to prevent inflammation resulting from antiviral programmed cell death pathways Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :E2786-E2795 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, transplantation of alveolar macrophages revealed that MCMV-infected alveolar macrophages can reach the mediastinal lymph nodes as early as 1 dpi.
Downregulation of macrophage lineage markers may have led to underestimation of macrophages in CMV infection in previous work. Moreover, CMV latency has been reported in precursor cells of the myeloid lineage bearing unorthodox phenotypes ( Hahn et al., 1998 34. Hahn, G. ∙ Jores, R. ∙ Mocarski, E.S. Cytomegalovirus remains latent in a common precursor of dendritic and myeloid cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :3937-3942 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data imply that these cells may actually be reprogrammed mature cells rather than bona fide precursors. Inclusion of non-conventional surface markers such as CD61 should be helpful in future work regarding this issue.
Our findings have important implications for understanding macrophage biology, CMV pathogenesis, and CMV-related diseases. The diversity of tissue-resident macrophages has recently become more evident, with identification of distinct immunophenotypes and gene signatures shaped by individual microenvironmental niches ( Blériot et al., 2020 5. Blériot, C. ∙ Chakarov, S. ∙ Ginhoux, F. Determinants of Resident Tissue Macrophage Identity and Function Immunity. 2020; 52 :957-970 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). The changes observed in CMV-infected macrophages, however, exceed the established limits of macrophage plasticity and niche adaptation. Moreover, macrophages reprogrammed by CMV could be implicated in breast cancer, where tumor tissue often bears CMV ( Taher et al., 2013 96. Taher, C. ∙ de Boniface, J. ∙ Mohammad, A.A. ... High prevalence of human cytomegalovirus proteins and nucleic acids in primary breast cancer and metastatic sentinel lymph nodes PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e56795 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ). Secretion of bioactive molecules by macrophages, which induce the Wnt signaling pathway, may promote tumor growth and de-differentiation ( Luga et al., 2012 53. Luga, V. ∙ Zhang, L. ∙ Viloria-Petit, A.M. ... Exosomes mediate stromal mobilization of autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling in breast cancer cell migration Cell. 2012; 151 :1542-1556 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (788) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yook et al., 2006 111. Yook, J.I. ∙ Li, X.Y. ∙ Ota, I. ... A Wnt-Axin2-GSK3beta cascade regulates Snail1 activity in breast cancer cells Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8 :1398-1406 Crossref Scopus (463) PubMed Google Scholar ). CMV-induced reprogramming of macrophages may also be of significance in coinfections (e.g., in congenital HIV infection; Gartner et al., 1986 25. Gartner, S. ∙ Markovits, P. ∙ Markovitz, D.M. ... The role of mononuclear phagocytes in HTLV-III/LAV infection Science. 1986; 233 :215-219 Crossref Scopus (1321) PubMed Google Scholar ), where CMV-driven invasion may facilitate maternal-fetal transmission. Furthermore, we provide evidence that, through modulation of the macrophage phenotype, CMV affects site-specific immunity against bacteria and, thus, the course and outcome of secondary infection. Whether a prior CMV infection is beneficial or detrimental may then depend on the ratio of emerging “non-functional” infected macrophages to pre-activated bystander macrophages and the time point of secondary infection.
This work substantially expands the known immune-modulating properties of CMV leading to identity loss of specialized and highly differentiated tissue macrophages. Co-evolution appears to have led to interference with conserved signaling pathways and, ultimately, to subversion of macrophage properties. Thus, previously established limits of macrophage plasticity are exceeded, and a novel cell state evolves, which serves the needs of the virus for proliferation and propagation.
Our study describes the parallel emergence of two macrophage populations after respiratory infection with CMV. Although the transformation process of infected macrophages was explored in detail, bystander macrophages were characterized less well beyond the IFN I signature.
Several lines of evidence are provided, showing that CMV-infected alveolar macrophages migrate to the regional lymph nodes. However, this concerns only a small number of “pioneering” cells. Cellular characteristics beyond Zeb1 expression that allow this behavior in CMV infection need to be resolved, as well as the role of these translocated cells in immunity to CMV.
Finally, whether CMV induces similar transformation events in other myeloid cells, in particular dendritic cells, and how these contribute to specific infection pathogenesis awaits clarification.

BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (USA) or Janvier Laboratories (France). Mice were bred under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facilities of the University of Freiburg and housed in groups of up to five mice. Mice were kept in 12h light/dark cycles and food and water was provided ad libitum . If not mentioned specifically, adult mice were between 6 and 18-week of age. Male and female mice were used for experiments; no differences were observed within the parameters analyzed. Littermates were randomly assigned to experimental groups. All animal experiments were approved by the Federal Ministry for Nature, Environment and Consumer’s protection of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
Healthy donors included in this study were two male and two female individuals between the ages of 20 and 35 years. To obtain human monocyte-derived MΦ blood was drawn from healthy donors in agreement with institutional ethics regulations. Subsequently, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were enriched by Ficoll (Cytiva) density gradient centrifugation and CD14 + monocytes were magnetically purified from PBMC via negative selection (Human monocyte enrichment kit, StemCell). Monocytes were then cultured in supplemented RPMI with recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (40ng/ml, PeproTech) with medium exchange every other day.
MCMV-Mck2 rep , MCMV-GFP and MCMV-floxGFP were rescued from the bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) pSM3fr-MCK-2fl ( Jordan et al., 2011 39. Jordan, S. ∙ Krause, J. ∙ Prager, A. ... Virus progeny of murine cytomegalovirus bacterial artificial chromosome pSM3fr show reduced growth in salivary Glands due to a fixed mutation of MCK-2 J. Virol. 2011; 85 :10346-10353 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), pSM3fr-MCK-2fl-M36GFP (described below) and pSM3fr-MCK-2fl-Dm157-flox-eGFP ( Tegtmeyer et al., 2019 99. Tegtmeyer, P.K. ∙ Spanier, J. ∙ Borst, K. ... STING induces early IFN-β in the liver and constrains myeloid cell-mediated dissemination of murine cytomegalovirus Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2830 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively, by transfection of MEFs. All rescued viruses were further propagated on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and purified using a sucrose cushion. A total of five MCMV-GFP batches were used during the project. HCMV TB40-SE-GFP was generated as described before ( Sampaio et al., 2017 84. Sampaio, K.L. ∙ Weyell, A. ∙ Subramanian, N. ... A TB40/E-derived human cytomegalovirus genome with an intact US-gene region and a self-excisable BAC cassette for immunological research Biotechniques. 2017; 63 :205-214 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and propagated on human MRC-5 cells.
In order to generate MCMV-GFP, we inserted the GFP ORF into the viral m36 transcription unit after the M36 ORF linked by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) using BAC technology.
First of all, we constructed an IRES-GFP cassette containing template plasmid which also carried a mFRT-site flanked kanamycin resistance cassette. The pGPS-IRES-GFP-Kan-mFRT was constructed as follows: the PCR amplified IRES-GFP cassette from pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) using the primers GFPSACfor (5′- GTGTGCGGCCGCGACGAGCTCTCATAATCAGCCATACCACATT – 3′) and GFPSACrev (5′- ACGCCTTAAGATACATTGATGAGTTTGGAC-3′) were assembled with a PCR fragment containing a kanamycin cassette flanked with mFRT-sites amplified from pGPS1.1 (NEB) using the primers KnmFRTfor (5′- AAATAGATCTGAAGTTCCTATTCTTCAAAAGGTATAGGAACTTCCACGTTGTGTCTCAAAATCTCTGA-3′) and KnmFRT (5′- ACAGGGTACCTGTGGGCGGACAAAATAGTTGGGAAGTTCCTATACCTTTTGAAGAATAGGAACTTCATTAAGCCAGTGTTACAACC-3′), and both were inserted into pGPS2 (NEB) digested with SacI and KpnI.
To insert the IRES-GFP cassette at the viral m36 locus, we used BAC recombineering. In brief, a linear DNA fragment consisting of the IRES and GFP expression cassette as well as a kanamycin (Kan) marker gene flanked by m-FRT-sites ( Schlake and Bode, 1994 88. Schlake, T. ∙ Bode, J. Use of mutated FLP recognition target (FRT) sites for the exchange of expression cassettes at defined chromosomal loci Biochemistry. 1994; 33 :12746-12751 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ) was generated by PCR using the primers H3-M36iGFPfor (5′- TCGAGAGGAGGAGGGTCAAGCTCTTTAAGATGACACGGGGATATCGATAGGCCCCTCTCCCTCCCCCCCCCCTAA-3′), H5-M36iGFPrev (5′-TTTTTTTTTCTCCCCTCACCCTCTCCGTCCCTTTCTTATCCGTTTTCCCTTGTGGGCGGACAAAATAGTTGG-3′) on the template plasmid pIRES-GFP-Kan-mFRT . This fragment was then inserted in pSM3fr-MCK-2fl (between nt position 47.568 - 47.668 according to Rawlinson ( Rawlinson et al., 1996 74. Rawlinson, W.D. ∙ Farrell, H.E. ∙ Barrell, B.G. Analysis of the complete DNA sequence of murine cytomegalovirus J. Virol. 1996; 70 :8833-8849 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar )) by homologous recombination in E.coli . Subsequently, the marker gene was excised by Flp recombinase via the m-FRT sites.
Plaque assay was performed as described earlier ( Reddehase et al., 1985 76. Reddehase, M.J. ∙ Weiland, F. ∙ Münch, K. ... Interstitial murine cytomegalovirus pneumonia after irradiation: characterization of cells that limit viral replication during established infection of the lungs J. Virol. 1985; 55 :264-273 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, cell culture supernatant or homogenized tissue of infected MΦ or mice, respectively, was added to a monolayer of MEF, centrifuged (2x 15 minutes at 400 g; centrifugal enhancement) and incubated for one hour. Next, the supernatant was removed and MEFs were covered with supplemented DMEM containing methylcellulose to locally restrain viral spread. At day three to five, the virus infection induced plaques were counted under the microscope.
Pooled sera of uninfected and infected (42-72dpi) mice were diluted into two-fold dilution series. 40 PFU of MCMV-Mck2 rep was incubated in the presence of the serum dilutions in triplicates for one hour at 37°C. MEFs seeded on a 48-well-plate were infected with the serum treated inoculums for 90 min without centrifugal enhancement. Next, the supernatants were removed and monolayers were covered with supplemented DMEM containing methylcellulose. At day three to five the plaques were counted under the microscope. The reduction of plaque number was plotted and the IC90 was calculated by Graphpad Prism.
Legionella pneumophila strain JR32 was used. Bacteria were plated on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar (Thermo Fisher). The optical density (OD600) of one and more single colonies was measured using an optical spectrophotometer. Subsequently, the suspension was plated on BCYE agar plates to create a standard curve. For infection, single colonies were picked, suspended in sterile PBS and the OD600 was measured to determine the infectious dose.
Mice were sacrificed and the left lung was removed. The lung was cut, homogenized in PBS using a TissueLyser (QIAGEN) and filtered through 70μm strainer. Colony forming units in the lung were determined by serial dilutions of the flow through on BYCE agar plates (Thermo Fisher) and quantified 3 days later.
To generate BM-derived macrophages, adult mice were sacrificed and femur and tibia removed. The bones were first rinsed with 60% isopropanol and sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, the bone marrow was flushed with RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen) and 10 mg/ml ciprofloxacin (Fresenius Kabi) (supplemented RPMI) and passed through a 70 μm cell strainer. After centrifugation (300 g for 7 minutes), cells were resuspended in supplemented RPMI plus recombinant M-CSF (20 ng/ml, PeproTech) and cultured in Petri dishes. Medium was exchanged at day 4. At day 6 BM-derived macrophages were detached enzymatically (Accutase; Thermo Fisher) and re-seeded with supplemented RPMI.
For bone marrow-derived dendritic cells ( BMDC ) isolated bone marrow was cultured in supplemented RPMI plus recombinant GM-CSF (20ng/ml, PeproTech). Half of the medium was removed at day 2 and replaced with fresh supplemented RPMI plus 40ng/ml GM-CSF. At day 3 and 6 the medium was fully exchanged and BMDC were separated from MΦ according to their high expression of MHCII and the lack of CD115 (MHCII + CD115 - ) ( Feuerstein et al., 2019 22. Feuerstein, R. ∙ Gres, V. ∙ Elias Perdigó, N. ... Macrophages Are a Potent Source of Streptococcus -Induced IFN-β J. Immunol. 2019; 203 :3416-3426 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) at day 8.
To harvest peritoneal macrophages , adult mice were sacrificed and the skin covering the abdomen removed to visualize the peritoneum. The abdominal cavity was flushed with ice-cold PBS containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 2 mM). The collected cell suspension was centrifuged and seeded into cell culture dishes with fully supplemented RPMI. After 2 h non-adherent cells were removed by thorough washing, and adherent cells were infected.
Alveolar macrophages were obtained via broncho-alveolar-lavage (BAL). Briefly, adult mice were sacrificed, the thorax opened and the trachea uncovered. Next a vein catheter (27G) was installed into the trachea through a small incision. PBS with EDTA (2 mM) was administered until lungs unfolded, then the cell suspension was retrieved. Cells were centrifuged and seeded into cell culture dishes with supplemented RPMI plus 20 ng/ml GM-CSF (PeproTech). After 2 h non-adherent cells were removed by thorough washing, and adherent cells were infected.
Intestinal macrophages were extracted as described before ( Kolter et al., 2016 42. Kolter, J. ∙ Feuerstein, R. ∙ Spoeri, E. ... Streptococci Engage TLR13 on Myeloid Cells in a Site-Specific Fashion J. Immunol. 2016; 196 :2733-2741 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the colon was opened longitudinally and rinsed. Epithelial cells were dissociated by shaking twice for 15 min at 37°C in 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM HEPES in HBSS. Remaining tissue was washed, minced, and digested three times for 15 min at 37°C with 0.3 mg/ml Collagenase IV (Worthington), 5 U/ml Dispase (Corning), and 0.5 mg/ml DNase I (Roche) in HBSS supplemented with 2% FCS. After digestion, the samples were filtered with a 70 μm cell strainer and cultured in supplemented RPMI. After 2 hours non-adherent cells were removed by thorough washing and adherent cells were infected.
Microglia. Two- to four-day old mice were transcardially perfused and the brain extracted. The meninges and the choroid plexus were removed under a stereomicroscope before homogenizing the brain. The homogenate was centrifuged at 300 g 6 min at 4°C, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen) and 10mg/ml ciprofloxacin (Fresenius Kabi) and plated in cell culture flasks previously coated with poly-L-Lysine for 3 hours. Medium was changed twice a week. After 7 days, the brain culture was stimulated by adding M-CSF (10 ng/ml, PeproTech) for 24 h before harvesting the microglia by shaking on a horizontal shaker for four hours at 37°C. The supernatant was removed, centrifuged (300 g, 6 min, 4°C) and microglia were cultured in supplemented DMEM with M-CSF (10 ng/ml, PeproTech).
For infection with MCMV, cultured cells were infected with indicated multiplicities of infection (MOI) of MCMV-GFP, centrifuged 2x 15 minutes with 400 g and incubated at 37°C. After 60 minutes, virus containing medium was discarded and the cells were washed thoroughly with sterile PBS before further culture in supplemented RPMI plus M-CSF or GM-CSF (20 ng/ml).
For sorting experiments, BM-derived macrophages were infected and sorted in a GFP - bystanding subset and a GFP + infected subset 1 dpi to obtain homogeneous populations of bystanding and infected cells and to prevent viral spread to bystanding cells at later time points. Subsequently, the subsets were cultured in supplemented RPMI medium for 2 days (3 dpi) with or without M-CSF (20 ng/ml).
Small molecule inhibitors (IQ1, ICG001, Galunitersib, Y27632) and Foscarnet (Clinigen Healthcare Ltd.) were added 1 hour prior to infection or after infection, respectively, at indicated concentrations.
For assessment of in vitro phagocytosis, PE-labeled beads (1 μm) were added to sorted BM-derived macrophage subsets at 3 dpi. After an incubation period of 30 minutes, the medium was removed and BM-derived macrophages were washed thoroughly three times. The number of PE + , phagocytic active BM-derived macrophages was determined via flow cytometry.
To evaluate endocytic capacity of BM-derived macrophage subsets, sorted BM-derived macrophages were starved in FCS-free RPMI for 4 hours before Dextran-AF647 (10 kDa, 0.1 mg/ml) was added. After an incubation period of 1 hour at 37°C or 4°C (negative control), the medium was removed and macrophages were washed thoroughly. The number of AF647 + BM-derived macrophages was analyzed via flow cytometry.
Sorted BM-derived macrophage subsets were seeded into a Seahorse XFe96 culture plate (Agilent Technologies) and analyzed 3 dpi on a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). For the Mito Stress Test, the culture media was removed carefully from each well and the cells were washed once before addition of 180 μL assay media (Seahorse Base media supplemented with 10 mM Glucose, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 2 mM Sodium Pyruvate, adjusted to pH 7.4). The plate was incubated in a CO 2 free incubator for 45 min. Injection plates were prepared with a final concentration of 1 μM Oligomycin (Port A). 1.5 μM FCCP (Port B) and 0.5 μM of each Rotenone and Antimycin (Port C). The assay protocols were designed using Wave desktop software (Version: 2.4.0.60 Agilent). To assess the maximal respiration rate the difference of oxygen consumption rate-values before and after FCCP injection were calculated.
Sorted infected BM-derived macrophages were stained with Cell Trace Violet (CTV + GFP + ) and cultured in a transwell insert (0.4 μm pore size; Corning) above a monolayer of MEFs or directly together with MEFs (CTV- GFP-). Newly infected (CTV- GFP+) cells were identified via flow cytometry. Serum of infected mice (1:64) was added to either of the conditions to determine cell-free virus contribution to viral spread (dotted bars). The serum’s IC90 was priorly determined with a plaque reduction assay (see Serum neutralization of MCMV by plaque reduction assay). After 5 days, the proportion of newly infected cells was assessed via flow cytometry.
To quantify the capacity of invasion, sorted macrophage subsets were cultured in a transwell insert (8 μm pore size, Corning) coated with Matrigel (1 mg/ml; Corning) in RPMI, Ciprofloxacin (10 mg/ml) and 0.1% FCS. The bottom plate contained RPMI with 10% FCS to build a chemoattractant gradient. Cells which transmigrated through the matrigel layer and pores of the insert were quantified via flow cytometry 4 days later.
Bone marrow cells and sorted infected BM-derived macrophages were cultured in MethoCult (M3434) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Colonies were counted and scored after 8 days.
To assess antigen processing and presentation, BM-derived macrophages and BMDCs (see Cell culture) were fed with OVA protein (1mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) over night. Subsequently, BM-derived macrophages were infected, sorted 1 dpi and subsequently co-cultured. To assess antigen presentation BM-derived macrophages and BMDC were pulsed with ovalbumin peptide SIINFEKL (1 μM, IBA) for 1h at 37°C after infection and sorting . In both experimental setups, CD8 + T cells were magnetically purified from spleens of OTI transgenic mice (Mouse CD8 T lymphocyte enrichment set – DM, BD Biosciences). Enriched CD8 + T cells were labeled with Cell Trace Violet (CTV) proliferation dye (10 μM, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Unless stated otherwise 50 000 CD8 + T cells were co-cultured with 20 000 control, bystanding or infected BM-derived macrophages or BMDCs. Cells were cultured in IMDM L-Glutamin, PenStrep (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10% FCS (PAN Biotech), 5mM β-Mercaptoethanol (Applichem) in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Greiner) at 37°C, 5% CO 2 in a humidified environment for 3 days before analysis.
For intraperitoneal infection, 8-12 week old BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with 5x10 5 PFU/ml of MCMV-GFP or MCMV-Mck2 rep and MCMV-Mck2 def as controls ( Jordan et al., 2011 39. Jordan, S. ∙ Krause, J. ∙ Prager, A. ... Virus progeny of murine cytomegalovirus bacterial artificial chromosome pSM3fr show reduced growth in salivary Glands due to a fixed mutation of MCK-2 J. Virol. 2011; 85 :10346-10353 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For intranasal infection, 8-18 week old C57B6/J mice were anesthetized with Ketamin (100 mg/kg body weight) and Xylazin (10 mg/kg body weight). Next, a total of 40 μL MCMV in PBS (1x10 5 PFU) was administered intranasally. The same procedure was performed for stimulation with 50μg/ml poly(I:C) (Invivogen) in NaCl (0.9%). The mice were monitored until awakening and analyzed at indicated time points. For intratracheal infection with Legionella pneumophila mice were anesthetized via inhalation of isoflurane and inoculated with 45μl bacterial suspension (5x10 6 CFU).
To measure the capacity of in vivo phagocytosis, 2 μM of fluorescent PKH26 phagocyte cell labeling dye, which labels aMΦ in vivo ( Neupane et al., 2020 64. Neupane, A.S. ∙ Willson, M. ∙ Chojnacki, A.K. ... Patrolling Alveolar Macrophages Conceal Bacteria from the Immune System to Maintain Homeostasis Cell. 2020; 183 :110-125.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ), was administered intranasally to control mice and to mice, which were infected 2 days before. One day later, mice were sacrificed and aMΦ from BAL and lung homogenate were analyzed for PKH26 uptake via flow cytometry.
To transfer infected alveolar macrophages, Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox were infected with MCMV-floxGFP and sacrificed 1 dpi. Subsequently infected aMΦ (GFP + Tomato + ) were sorted from lung homogenate and immediately transferred into wild-type mice.
To reconstitute lungs of Csf2rb −/− mice with alveolar macrophages, adult Itgax cre/+ ROSA26-Tomato flox mice were sacrificed and alveolar macrophages from lung homogenate were sorted (CD11b int CD11c + /Tomato + SiglecF + MHCII - ) and immediately transferred into Csf2rb −/− mice 48 hours after birth.
To label alveolar macrophages, which reside in the airways, 0.25μg of antibody (SiglecF (clone E50-2440) and CD61) diluted in PBS (total 50μl) were intratracheally administered. 1 hour later, the mice were sacrificed and the lung homogenized. After retrieving a single cell suspension, total bystanding alveolar macrophages were defined as SiglecF + (clone S17007L) CD11b int and MHCII lo and total infected alveolar macrophages as GFP + . Labeling efficiency was calculated from in vivo labeled and total bystanding or infected alveolar macrophages of lung homogenate.
Five days after MCMV-infection or PBS administration, mice were sacrificed and 700μl NaCl were intratracheally installed into the lungs (as described for BAL). The same fluid was retrieved and administered back into the lungs for a total of 5 times before final recovery. Next, the BAL fluid was centrifuged at 300 g for 10 minutes (4°C) and the cell-free supernatant was used to photometrically determine cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations via Beckman AU680 (Beckman Coulter).
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (R0278; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitors (539134; Calbiochem) and PMSF (P7626; Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 × 10 6 cells/ml and stored at −80°C. For western blot analysis, cells were incubated at 95°C for 10 min in 2x Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol prior to application on a 12% Tris-glycine gel (Anamed). Antibodies for protein detection were anti-CD11b mouse (Biotechne) and β-actin (AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies ECL mouse IgG, HRP-linked (NA931V; Cytiva) and ECL rabbit IgG, HRP-linked (NA934V; Cytiva) were detected using Amersham luminol and peroxide solution (RPN2235; Cytiva).
For RNA extraction, cells were lysed in RLT buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit according to producer’s information (QIAGEN). For BM-derived macrophage gene transcript analysis, cells were sorted as described above and cultured in supplemented RPMI plus M-CSF for 2 days (3 dpi) prior to RNA extraction. For BM-derived macrophage stimulation, sorted macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 ng/ml, Invivogen) 3 dpi followed by RNA extraction 6 hours after LPS administration. Alveolar macrophages were sorted from lung homogenates at indicated time points, followed by immediate centrifugation (4°C, 300 g, 6 minutes), washing with PBS and RNA extraction of the cell lysate. RNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA with the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad) for BM-derived macrophages or with the SuperScript IV VILO mix (Thermo Fisher) for sorted alveolar macrophages. QRT-PCR was performed with ABsolute qPCR SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher) at the Realplex Mastercycler (Eppendorf).
See Table S5 .
Infected and uninfected sorted BM-derived macrophages were seeded into 96-well-plates and stimulated with LPS (50 ng/ml) at 3 dpi. After 24 hours, cells were centrifuged (300 g for 2 minutes) and the supernatant collected. IL-10 ELISA was performed according to producer’s information (R&D Systems).
Generally, FcγII/III receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibody (eBioscience) prior to staining the cell surface with respective antibodies (see Key resources table) in PBS containing 2% FCS and 2mM EDTA (FACS buffer).
For in vitro assays, cells were enzymatically detached with Accutase and subsequently washed and processed with FACS buffer.
For intracellular staining of TNFα cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS and the medium was supplemented with GolgiStop to impair cytokine secretion. 6 hpi cells were enzymatically detached, stained for surface markers and washed with PBS. Subsequently, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Transcription factor staining buffer kit according to manufacturer’s instruction. Staining for TNFα was performed in permeabilization buffer.
For intracellular staining of pro-IL-1β, cells were retrieved via BAL 8 hours post intranasal stimulation with poly(I:C). After staining of surface markers, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Transcription factor staining buffer kit according to manufacturer’s instruction. Staining for pro-IL-1β was performed in permeabilization buffer and pro-IL-1β + alveolar macrophages identified via surface marker expression.
To extract alveolar macrophages, either BAL (see above) or enzymatic digestion of the lung was performed. For digestion, the right lung homogenate was incubated in PBS containing 10% FCS, Collagenase IV (1 mg/ml, Worthington) and DNase I (0.25 mg/ml) for 1.5 hours at 180 rpm at 37°C. The obtained cell suspension was filtered with a 70 μm cell strainer and erythrocytes were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) followed by washing.
To extract cells from the lymph node, adipose tissue surrounding the lymph node was removed under a stereomiscroscope. Next the lymph node was grinded and filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer followed by washing.
Blood was collected retrobulbary and erythrocytes were lysed with RBC lysis buffer. All samples were stained with respective antibodies for flow cytometry analysis.
For BrdU analysis, sorted cells were cultured in supplemented RPMI and pulsed with BrdU for 2h prior to fixation and permeabilized with the BrdU Flow Kit (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were then treated with 0.3 mg/ml DNase I (Roche) for 1h at 37°C and stained for 20 min at room temperature with anti-BrdU antibody (BioLegend). Gates were determined with respective cells stained for BrdU without prior pulsing.

Images of BM-derived macrophages were taken 2 dpi using a fluorescence microscope (ApoTome, Zeiss). Phase contrast and fluorescent (GFP filter) images were acquired with a 40x objective and processed with ZEN software (Zeiss). To assess cellular morphology (circularity and area), random cells of phase contrast images ( Figures 1 B–1D) or GFP + cells of merged images ( Figures 5 K and S5 K) were analyzed blinded via ImageJ/FiJi (1.47v, NIH, USA) ( Schindelin et al., 2012 87.

To track cell proliferation ( Figure 4 H), BM-derived macrophages were sorted as described above, and cultured with 50 ng/ml M-CSF (PeproTech) to stimulate proliferation. At given time points, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and nucleostained with 4‘,6-Diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI, 0.1 μg/ml, ThermoFisher). Images were acquired with a 2.5x objective and automated nucleus (DAPI + ) counting was performed with ImageJ/FiJi.
For time lapse live cell imaging, BM-derived macrophages were seeded into 8-well μ-slide (ibidi, Germany) and infected as described above. After infection, the μ-slide was transferred to the climate chamber (37°C, 5% CO 2 ) of a Zeiss LSM710 microscope with an epifluorescence live-cell imaging setup. Phase contrast and fluorescent (GFP filter) images were chosen randomly and acquired with a 40x objective every 15 minutes for 48 hours. Single images were then merged and movies recorded with ZEN software (Zeiss). To analyze velocity and migration distance, the chemotaxis and migration tool (ibidi), a plug in for ImageJ/FiJi, was used.
After transcardial perfusion with PBS, the lungs were refilled with a mixture (1:1) of PBS and Tissue-Tek O.C.T.™ compound (Sakura Finetek Europ B.V. Netherlands) to physiological size. The left lung was then removed and embedded into Tissue TEK O.C.T.™ and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (10 μm) were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes, permeabilized for 5 minutes in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Thermo Fisher) for 3 hours. Antibodies were incubated for 1h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml) when necessary. Finally, the sections were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher). Confocal microscopy was performed with a LSM 880 confocal microscope. The images were processed with ZEN blue (Carl Zeiss) software.
Sorted BM-derived macrophages were seeded on poly-lysine-coated coverslips until 3 dpi at 37°C. Cultures on coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA (w/v) and 2% glutaraldehyde (w/v) containing PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 30 minutes. After washing with PBS, cultures were incubated with 0.5% Osmiumtetroxide for 30 minutes and washed in graded ethanol (up to 50%) for 5 minutes each, followed by incubation in 1% Uranylacetat for 30 minutes and dehydration of the cultures with graded ethanol solutions (80%, 90%, 98% for 5 minutes, 2 × 100% ethanol for 10 minutes). After incubation in 100% propylenoxide (2 × 10 minutes), cultures were embedded in Durcupan resin (Sigma-Aldrich). Coverslips were removed by liquid nitrogen exposure, and ultrathin sectioning (55 nm) was performed using a Leica UC6 Ultracut. Sections mounted onto coppergrids (Plano) were contrasted using Pb-citrate (3 minutes). Electronmicroscopy was performed at a Philips CM100 microscope equipped with a Gatan Kamera Orius SC600 at 700x (−2950x) magnification. All images were analyzed as TIF-files via ImageJ/FiJi.
Total RNA of sorted control, bystanding and infected BM-derived macrophages (3 biological replicates each) from wild-type mice was extracted 3 dpi using RNAeasy MicroKit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Heatmaps were generated with Morpheus ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/ ). For normalization the mean of each gene across MΦ subsets was subtracted from individual values and divided by the standard deviation of that gene (z-score). For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) fgsea on the Galaxy Freiburg platform ( Afgan et al., 2018 3. Afgan, E. ∙ Baker, D. ∙ Batut, B. ... The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2018 update Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 :W537-W544 Crossref Scopus (999) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the mouse hallmark gene set were used with significant (padj < 0.05) genes ranked by log 2 fold change of indicated conditions.

BM-derived macrophages were resuspended in 8 M urea, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors mixture. Lysates were then sonicated and cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 g and 4°C. Protein lysates (50 μg) were reduced with 10 mM DTT at 37°C for 40 min, and alkylated with 55 mM chloroacetamide at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.
For tryptic digestion, proteins were digested overnight at 37°C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, 1:50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio) after 4-fold dilution with 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. Digests were acidified by addition of formic acid (FA) to 5% (v/v) and desalted using Sep-Pak C18 cartridges, as previously described ( Ruprecht et al., 2017a 81. Ruprecht, B. ∙ Wang, D. ∙ Chiozzi, R.Z. ... Hydrophilic Strong Anion Exchange (hSAX) Chromatography Enables Deep Fractionation of Tissue Proteomes Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1550 :69-82 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Peptide solutions were frozen at −80°C and dried in vacuo .
TMT 10-plex labeling was performed by reconstituting each digest in 20 μL of 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.5). Five μL of 11.6 mM TMT reagents stock solution (Thermo Fisher) in 100% anhydrous ACN were then added to each sample. Labeling reaction was carried for 1 h at 25°C, and quenched by adding 2 μL of 5% hydroxylamine. Peptide solutions were pooled and acidified using 20 μL of 10% FA. Reaction vessels in which the labeling took place were further rinsed with 20 μL of 10% FA in 10% ACN, and the solvent was then added to the pooled sample. The pools were dried in vacuo , desalted and stored dried at −80°C until further use.
Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed by loading the TMT-labeled peptides on a Fe 3+ -IMAC column (Propac IMAC-10 4 × 50 mm column Thermo Fisher) ( Ruprecht et al., 2015 80. Ruprecht, B. ∙ Koch, H. ∙ Medard, G. ... Comprehensive and reproducible phosphopeptide enrichment using iron immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC) columns Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2015; 14 :205-215 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using a UV-abs signal, the outlet of the column was monitored and two fractions were collected: one containing non-phosphorylated peptides (flow-thought), the other containing phosphorylated peptide (eluate). Both factions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at −80°C.
For whole proteome analysis, the flow-thought of the IMAC enrichment was re-suspended in 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.7, and subjected to trimodal mixed mode chromatography on an Acclaim Trinity P1 2.1 × 150 mm, 3 μm column (Thermo Fisher) for peptide fractionation ( Yu et al., 2017 112. Yu, P. ∙ Petzoldt, S. ∙ Wilhelm, M. ... Trimodal Mixed Mode Chromatography That Enables Efficient Offline Two-Dimensional Peptide Fractionation for Proteome Analysis Anal. Chem. 2017; 89 :8884-8891 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). A total of 32 fractions were collected.
For phosphoproteome analysis, the eluate of the IMAC enrichment was desalted and subjected to high pH RP fractionation ( Ruprecht et al., 2017b 82. Ruprecht, B. ∙ Zecha, J. ∙ Zolg, D.P. ... High pH Reversed-Phase Micro-Columns for Simple, Sensitive, and Efficient Fractionation of Proteome and (TMT labeled) Phosphoproteome Digests Methods Mol. Biol. 2017; 1550 :83-98 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) using self-packed StageTips, containing 5 disks of C18 material (3M Empore). A total of 6 fractions were collected. All fractions were dried in vacuo and stored at −20°C until LC-MS/MS analysis.
Nano flow LC-ESI-MS measurements were performed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC+ system coupled to a Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Peptides were delivered to a trap column (75 μm × 2 cm, packed in-house with 5 μm Reprosil C18 resin; Dr. Maisch) and washed using 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 5 μL/min for 10 min. Subsequently, peptides were transferred to an analytical column (75 μm × 45 cm, packed in-house with 3 μm Reprosil C18 resin, Dr. Maisch) applying a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Peptides were chromatographically separated using a 50 min linear gradient from 8% to 34% solvent B (0.1% FA, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in Acetonitrile (ACN)) in solvent A (0.1% FA in 5% DMSO).
The Fusion Lumos was operated in a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) to automatically switch between MS and MS/MS. Briefly, survey full-scan MS spectra were recorded in the orbitrap from 360 to 1300 m/z at a resolution of 60K, using an automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 4e5 charges and maximum injection time (maxIT) of 50 ms.
For the MS3-based TMT method, initial MS2 spectra for peptide identification were recorded in the ion trap in rapid scan mode with a top speed approach using a 2 s duration (isolation window 0.7 m/z, AGC target value of 1e4, maxIT of 35 ms). Fragmentation was set to CID, with a NCE of 35% and activation Q of 0.25. Then, for each peptide precursor, an additional MS3 spectrum for TMT quantification was obtained in the orbitrap at 50K resolution (AGC of 5e4 charges, maxIT of 86 ms). The precursor was fragmented as for the MS2 analysis, followed by synchronous selection of the 10 most intense peptide fragments and further fragmentation via HCD using a NCE of 55%. Dynamic exclusion was set to 90 s.
For the analysis of the phosphopeptide-enriched sample the following modifications were applied: LC gradient from 4% to 32% of solvent B in 100 min, MS2 readout in the Orbitrap, top 10 approach, multistage activation enabled, MS2 AGC target value of 5e4, MS2 maxIT of 60 ms, MS3 AGC of 1.2e5 charges, and MS3 maxIT of 120 ms).
Peptide and protein identification and quantification was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.6.0.13) with its built in search engine Andromeda ( Cox and Mann, 2008 13. Cox, J. ∙ Mann, M. MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26 :1367-1372 Crossref Scopus (7495) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spectra were searched against the UniProtKB database ( Mus musculus , UP000000589, 53,127 entries, and Murid Herpesvirus, UP000122533, 164 entries, downloaded on 04.2018). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, and the search included cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification and Ntem-acetylation of protein, oxidation of methionine, and/or phosphorylation of serine, threonine, tyrosine residue (STY) as variable modifications. TMT10 was specified as label within a reporter ion MS3 experiment type. Up to two missed cleavage sites were allowed. Precursor tolerance was set to 5 ppm, and fragment ion tolerance to 20 ppm. The match between runs feature was enabled. Results were adjusted to 1% false discovery rate at protein, peptide, and site levels.
To handle the 30-plex experiment (3 TMT experiments with 10 channels each), bioinformatic analysis was done in Microsoft Excel and Perseus (version 1.6.1.1), which is part of the MaxQuant software suite ( Tyanova et al., 2016 101. Tyanova, S. ∙ Temu, T. ∙ Sinitcyn, P. The Perseus computational platform for comprehensive analysis of (prote)omics data Nat. Methods. 2016; 13 :731-740 Crossref Scopus (2307) PubMed Google Scholar ). To correct for small sample loading, labeling reaction efficiency, and DDA-peptide sampling differences between the 3 TMT experiments, two normalization procedures were applied: total-sum and row-wise normalization. First, the reporter ion intensity for each protein (p) in each TMT channel (c) was divided by the total sum of all protein intensities in the respective channel, obtaining a scaled intensity (SI). Afterward, a row-wise normalization factor (F) was calculated for each protein in each TMT experiment (T), as the ratio between the averaged SI across the 3 experiments to the averaged SI within each experiment. These normalization factors were then applied to respective TMT channels to obtain the final normalized protein reporter intensity (NI): N I ⁡ ( p c T ) = S I ⁡ ( p c ) × F ( p T ) Same normalization procedure was applied to the phosphoproteome dataset.
Both proteome and phosphoproteome datasets were filtered to retain only proteins or sites that have been quantified in all the 3 biological replica in at least one experimental condition, and missing values were imputed in Perseus using default settings.
To identify significantly modulated proteins and sites ANOVA test was used, corrected for multiple hypotheses using a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 1%, and followed by Tukey HSD post hoc test in R ( https://www.R-project.org/ ).
A Student t test with a permutation-based FDR of 5% was used to evaluate the temporal dynamics and magnitude of regulations, when comparing bystanding cells versus the control samples at 1 dpi. Here, the S0 parameter was tuned to achieve a minimum 2-fold regulation cut-off, and it was set to 1.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on z-scored protein or site intensities, using Euclidian distance and average linkage. Profile plots show the normalized protein abundance (z-scored protein intensity) for each identified cluster. The lines indicate individual proteins and are colored according to the Pearson correlation calculated over the cluster centroid.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed with Perseus software. Categorical annotation was supplied by Gene Ontology biological process, molecular function, and cellular component; and the KEGG pathway database. All annotations were extracted from the UniProt database. The GO terms enrichment was calculated on the basis of a Fisher’s exact test with a false discovery rate value of 0.05. One-dimensional (1D) annotation enrichment analysis was performed on the distribution of the measured fold-changes (bystanding versus control BM-derived macrophages) for Reactome pathways with a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR cut-off of 1% ( Cox and Mann, 2012 14. Cox, J. ∙ Mann, M. 1D and 2D annotation enrichment: a statistical method integrating quantitative proteomics with complementary high-throughput data BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13 :S12 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).

Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software, Version 8). For comparison of two groups, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test was applied unless stated otherwise in the figure legend. For multiple comparisons, one- or two-way ANOVA were performed, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Differences were considered statistically significant when the p values were ≤ 0.05 ( ∗ ), ≤ 0.01 ( ∗∗ ) and ≤ 0.001 ( ∗∗∗ ). Statistically non-significant data (p value > 0.05) are indicated as n.s. Data are presented as mean ± SEM if not stated otherwise in the figure legend. The number of mice and the number of independent experiments conducted to generate the data is shown in the figure legend and presented as “n=x/y.” “X” represents number of mice and “y” number of independently performed experiments. For example, n = 3-4/3 means 3 to 4 mice (per group) in 3 independent experiments. Sample exclusion was not performed.
