Title: Convergent evolution in the supercoiling of prokaryotic flagellar filaments


Abstract: Summary

The supercoiling of bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments is required for motility. Archaeal flagellar filaments have no homology to their bacterial counterparts and are instead homologs of bacterial type IV pili. How these prokaryotic flagellar filaments, each composed of thousands of copies of identical subunits, can form stable supercoils under torsional stress is a fascinating puzzle for which structural insights have been elusive. Advances in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) make it now possible to directly visualize the basis for supercoiling, and here, we show the atomic structures of supercoiled bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments. For the bacterial flagellar filament, we identify 11 distinct protofilament conformations with three broad classes of inter-protomer interface. For the archaeal flagellar filament, 10 protofilaments form a supercoil geometry supported by 10 distinct conformations, with one inter-protomer discontinuity creating a seam inside of the curve. Our results suggest that convergent evolution has yielded stable superhelical geometries that enable microbial locomotion.

Section: Introduction

Many organisms from the three domains of life, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, possess flagella, which allow for motility ( Khan and Scholey, 2018 30. Khan, S. ∙ Scholey, J.M. Assembly, functions and evolution of archaella, flagella and cilia Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :R278-R292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an example of convergent evolution, these three systems evolved independently with entirely different components yet similar functions. Eukaryotic flagella are composed of microtubules, and ATP hydrolysis by dynein motors causes the appendages to beat back and forth ( Khan and Scholey, 2018 30. Khan, S. ∙ Scholey, J.M. Assembly, functions and evolution of archaella, flagella and cilia Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :R278-R292 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Bacterial and archaeal flagella convey motility through the motor-driven rotation of supercoiled flagellar filaments that function as propellers ( Nedeljković et al., 2021 43. Nedeljković, M. ∙ Sastre, D.E. ∙ Sundberg, E.J. Bacterial flagellar filament: a supramolecular multifunctional nanostructure Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22 :7521 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Poweleit et al., 2016 50. Poweleit, N. ∙ Ge, P. ∙ Nguyen, H.H. ... CryoEM structure of the Methanospirillum hungatei archaellum reveals structural features distinct from the bacterial flagellum and type IV pilus Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 2 :16222 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the eukaryotic flagella and cilia are quite complex with as many as 600 different proteins ( Pazour et al., 2005 47. Pazour, G.J. ∙ Agrin, N. ∙ Leszyk, J. ... Proteomic analysis of a eukaryotic cilium J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170 :103-113 Crossref Scopus (838) PubMed Google Scholar ), bacterial and archaeal flagellar filaments (AFFs) are both polymerized from a single kind of subunit, flagellin.
The bacterial flagellum has been studied extensively ( Macnab, 2003 37. Macnab, R.M. How bacteria assemble flagella Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57 :77-100 Crossref Scopus (781) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nedeljković et al., 2021 43. Nedeljković, M. ∙ Sastre, D.E. ∙ Sundberg, E.J. Bacterial flagellar filament: a supramolecular multifunctional nanostructure Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22 :7521 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the supercoiling of its flagellar filament and its polymorphic ability to switch between waveforms during the alternation of swimming modes are indispensable for motility ( Darnton et al., 2007 12. Darnton, N.C. ∙ Turner, L. ∙ Rojevsky, S. ... On torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :1756-1764 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). When bacteria such as Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Salmonella typhimurium switch from running to a tumble, one or multiple flagellar filaments break out of a bundle due to the change in the direction of motor rotation. This change in mechanical force causes the waveforms of the flagellar filament to switch from being normal waveforms in the bundle to being either or both of the semi-coiled and curly I waveforms ( Darnton et al., 2007 12. Darnton, N.C. ∙ Turner, L. ∙ Rojevsky, S. ... On torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :1756-1764 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). These semi-coiled and curly I waveforms are more favorable than the normal waveforms after the change from counterclockwise (CCW) to clockwise (CW) rotation. The various polymorphisms of the bacterial flagellar filament (BFF) differ from each other in both the pitch and curvature of the supercoil and can be distinguished using light or electron microscopy.
For the BFF, the core domains D0 and D1 are crucial to supercoiling and polymorphism ( Kanto et al., 1991 28. Kanto, S. ∙ Okino, H. ∙ Aizawa, S. ... Amino acids responsible for flagellar shape are distributed in terminal regions of flagellin J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219 :471-480 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Yoshioka et al., 1995 67.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177 :1090-1093 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the outer domains can have diverse structures or be largely absent ( Kamiya et al., 1982 27.

Almost all structural studies of the BFF have been performed using straight non-motile flagellar filaments produced by point mutations in the flagellin subunit ( Maki-Yonekura et al., 2010 39.

Complete atomic model of the bacterial flagellar filament by electron cryomicroscopy Nature. 2003; 424 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ). These point mutations lock the BFF into structures in which 11 protofilaments have either all left-handed (L-type) or all right-handed (R-type) configurations ( Hyman and Trachtenberg, 1991 22. Hyman, H.C. ∙ Trachtenberg, S. Point mutations that lock Salmonella typhimurium flagellar filaments in the straight right-handed and left-handed forms and their relation to filament superhelicity J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220 :79-88 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), with the filament subunits related by strict helical symmetry. These straight filaments were used for structural studies, as it was believed, until recently ( Blum et al., 2019 7. Blum, T.B. ∙ Filippidou, S. ∙ Fatton, M. ...

Flagellar structures from the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus and Implications for phage φCbK predation of multiflagellin bacteria J. Bacteriol. 2021; 203 :e00399-20 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), that high-resolution structural studies of supercoiled filaments were unobtainable. The observation of only two structural states coupled with flagellin polymerization studies ( Asakura, 1970 4. Asakura, S. Polymerization of flagellin and polymorphism of flagella Adv. Biophys. 1970; 1 :99-155 PubMed Google Scholar ) resulted in the development of a two-state model for the supercoiling of the BFF ( Calladine, 1975 8. Calladine, C.R. Construction of bacterial flagella Nature. 1975; 255 :121-124 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Calladine et al., 2013 9. Calladine, C.R. ∙ Luisi, B.F. ∙ Pratap, J.V.

Calldine, C.R. Change of waveform in bacterial flagella: the role of mechanics at the molecular level J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118 :457-479 Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar ). The “2-state model” ( Maki-Yonekura et al., 2010 39. Maki-Yonekura, S. ∙ Yonekura, K. ∙ Namba, K. Conformational change of flagellin for polymorphic supercoiling of the flagellar filament Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :417-422 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) referred to the idea that the protofilaments existed in one of two discrete states and that the interface between those differing protofilaments (along the 11-start cylindrical surface lattice lines) is a “2-way (allosteric) switch.”
Here, we present near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of three supercoiled BFFs in one of two waveforms from two different strains of E. coli , Enteropathogenic E. coli O127:H6 (EPEC H6) and E. coli K-12. We focused on only the core domain structures of these filaments, as those are key to supercoiling. We show that there are 11 protofilament states in both the normal- and curly-I-waveform structures, which is similar to the recent results obtained for the flagellar hook ( Kato et al., 2019 29. Kato, T. ∙ Makino, F. ∙ Miyata, T. ... Structure of the native supercoiled flagellar hook as a universal joint Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5295 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shibata et al., 2019 53. Shibata, S. ∙ Matsunami, H. ∙ Aizawa, S.I. ... Torque transmission mechanism of the curved bacterial flagellar hook revealed by cryo-EM Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :941-945 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interfaces between those differing protofilaments cluster into distinct groups, consistent with allosteric switching.
Although the bacterial flagellum has been extensively studied, much of the work on the archaeal system is more recent ( Bardy et al., 2002 5. Bardy, S.L. ∙ Mori, T. ∙ Komoriya, K. ...

Microbiol. 2016; 2 :16222 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). The AFF and archaeal flagellin have no homology to their bacterial analogs and are instead related to bacterial and archaeal type IV pili (T4P) ( Bayley and Jarrell, 1998 6. Bayley, D.P. ∙ Jarrell, K.F. Further evidence to suggest that archaeal flagella are related to bacterial type IV pili J. Mol.

The archaeal flagellum: a different kind of prokaryotic motility structure FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25 :147-174 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite their similarities, AFFs must be able to supercoil ( Bardy et al., 2002 5. Bardy, S.L. ∙ Mori, T. ∙ Komoriya, K. ... Identification and localization of flagellins FlaA and FlaB3 within flagella of Methanococcus voltae J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184 :5223-5233 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas T4P do not. Recently, it was suggested that the flexibility of the AFF allowed for motility ( Gambelli et al., 2022 19. Gambelli, L. ∙ Isupov, M.N. ∙ Conners, R. ... An archaellum filament composed of two alternating subunits Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :710 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), but this hypothesis is unlikely because the rotation of a flexible filament would not produce thrust. However, no structural models for the supercoiling of AFFs have been proposed.
We also report the cryo-EM structure of the supercoiled AFF from the thermoacidophilic Saccharolobus islandicus REY15A and show that it is assembled by 10 protofilaments, each in a different conformation. Here, supercoiling is governed by a core domain, containing a single α-helix in archaea rather than the coiled-coils in bacterial filaments. In contrast to the bacterial filaments, a discrete seam exists between protofilaments on the inside of the archaeal supercoil.

Section: Results

We used cryo-EM to determine the structure of supercoiled BFFs from EPEC O127:H6 (H6) and E. coli K-12 (K-12) ( Figures 1 and S1 ). For this work, we focused on the core domains D0 and D1 and masked out the outer domains from the H6 flagellar filament reconstruction. Although we have previously shown that the outer domains in H6 form tetramers (that are dimers of dimers) ( Kreutzberger et al., 2022 34. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Sobe, R.C. ∙ Sauder, A.B. ... Flagellin outer domain dimerization modulates motility in pathogenic and soil bacteria from viscous environments Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :1422 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ), the pairings of the outer domains do not introduce any observable perturbation of the core domains D0 and D1. The H6 flagellar filaments were imaged under two different buffer conditions, which results in different curvatures and supercoil pitches ( Figures 1 , S1 A, S1D, and S1G).
We initially performed a helical reconstruction, refining a single global helical symmetry relating all subunits to each other ( Figure S1 ). In all cases, we were able to reconstruct the flagellar core domains D0 and D1 to ∼4.0 Å resolution. For each helical structure, the “gold-standard” Fourier shell correlation (FSC) (GS FSC) appeared to over-estimate the map resolution ( Figures S1 C, S1F, and S1I; Table S1 ), most likely due to the fact that the GS FSC is a measure of reproducibility and not of true resolution, particularly for structures with imposed symmetry ( Subramaniam et al., 2016 56. Subramaniam, S. ∙ Earl, L.A. ∙ Falconieri, V. ... Resolution advances in cryo-EM enable application to drug discovery Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 41 :194-202 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The average protofilament tilt for the various bacterial flagellar waveforms has previously been predicted from the number of L- and R-protofilaments expected to be present in the structure ( Calladine et al., 2013 9. Calladine, C.R. ∙ Luisi, B.F. ∙ Pratap, J.V. A “mechanistic” explanation of the multiple helical forms adopted by bacterial flagellar filaments J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :914-928 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). The higher curvature H6 BFFs ( Figures 1 B and S1 A) appear to be in the curly I waveform due to the tilt and rise of +0.94°/52.9 Å for subunits along a protofilament in the helical reconstruction, which can be easily seen in the helical net representation of the symmetry (dashed lines in Figure S1 B). The lower curvature H6 and K-12 flagellar filaments appear to be in the normal waveform with a protofilament tilt and rise of −0.6°/53.1 Å ( Figures S1 E and S1H).
We developed a scheme ( Figure 1 A) for determining the structure of supercoiled flagellar filaments using cryo-EM, starting with helical reconstruction and then employing a low-pass filtered version of that reconstruction as the starting point for an asymmetric reconstruction using the various tools in crySPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 51. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ). We solved the higher curvature EPEC H6 structure to 3.4 Å resolution, whereas the lower curvature EPEC H6 and the E. coli K12 BFF structures were solved to 4.2 and 3.5 Å resolution, respectively. Given that the starting volumes had been low-pass filtered to 20–50 Å, there was no possibility that the details in the final asymmetric reconstructions were biased by the initial models. The resolution of each of these BFFs varied locally between the subunits on the inner and outer curves ( Figures S2 A–S2F). Based on both the helical symmetry parameters ( Calladine et al., 2013 9. Calladine, C.R. ∙ Luisi, B.F. ∙ Pratap, J.V. A “mechanistic” explanation of the multiple helical forms adopted by bacterial flagellar filaments J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :914-928 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as the 2.9-rad/μm curvature estimated from our map ( Table S2 ), we are confident that the this higher curvature H6 structure ( Figures 1 B–1D and S2 A) is in the curly I waveform. Likewise, based on the average protofilament tilt and curvature of ∼1–1.4 rad/μm ( Table S2 ), the lower curvature H6 and K-12 structures ( Figures 1 E–1G, and S2 C, and S2E) are in the normal waveform.
We compared the subunit density map from our EPEC H6 curly I helical and asymmetric reconstructions with the nominal 2.8 Å resolution helically symmetric structure from the Firmicutes Kurthia ( Blum et al., 2019 7. Blum, T.B. ∙ Filippidou, S. ∙ Fatton, M. ... The wild-type flagellar filament of the firmicute Kurthia at 2.8 Å resolution in vivo Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :14948 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). The H6 curly I helical reconstruction had a GS FSC resolution estimate of 2.9 Å. However, using the d 99 and d model resolution estimates ( Afonine et al., 2018a 2. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Klaholz, B.P. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... New tools for the analysis and validation of cryo-EM maps and atomic models Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :814-840 Crossref Scopus (445) PubMed Google Scholar ), we estimated 3.5 and 3.2 Å resolution, respectively, for the Kurthia filament as well as 3.5 and 3.4 Å, respectively, for the H6 curly I. This highlights the notion that the map:map FSC is more a metric of reproducibility rather than true resolution ( Subramaniam et al., 2016 56. Subramaniam, S. ∙ Earl, L.A. ∙ Falconieri, V. ... Resolution advances in cryo-EM enable application to drug discovery Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 41 :194-202 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). Both the Kurthia and H6 helical structures’ density maps had discontinuous density in the loop region connecting the two helices of N-terminal domain D1 ( Figures S2 G and S2H). The flagellin subunit densities in the asymmetric curly I structure did not have broken density in this loop ( Figure S2 I) and yielded a higher quality map despite having a lower resolution estimated by the “gold-standard” 0.143 map:map FSC. We built models into our flagellar filament structures ( Figures 1 D and 1G) and used the more conservative map:model FSC threshold of 0.5 for the resolution estimate. We found a similar improvement in map quality when we analyzed the normal-waveform asymmetric reconstructions from H6 and K-12, which had resolution estimates of 4.2 and 3.5 Å, respectively ( Figures S2 C and S2E).
Because the diameter of supercoiled waveforms (∼2,000–6,000 Å) is significantly larger than the typical ice thickness in a cryo-EM grid ( Rice et al., 2018 52. Rice, W.J. ∙ Cheng, A. ∙ Noble, A.J. ... Routine determination of ice thickness for cryo-EM grids J. Struct. Biol. 2018; 204 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ), we suspected that the supercoiling of the flagellar filaments would be constrained in the z dimension. Cryo-electron tomography on wild-type Campylobacter jejuni flagellar filaments ( Figures S3 A–S3D) indeed showed that the flagellar filaments were mostly flattened in the z dimension ( Figure S3 D). It has previously been suggested that BFFs that are flattened by negative-stain TEM preparative conditions retain their local curvature and undergo a large twist at select locations to accommodate the flattening without severe distortions elsewhere ( Calldine, 1978 10. Calldine, C.R. Change of waveform in bacterial flagella: the role of mechanics at the molecular level J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118 :457-479 Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar ). We anticipated that the very small segments of flagella in our particles (∼0.04–0.07 μm) relative to the overall length of the flagellar filament (2–10 μm) could also be undistorted for the same reasons. To test this, we developed a method for aligning hundreds of copies of flagellar filament atomic models to generate a macroscopic model ( Figure 2 A). Using this scheme, the supercoil for the curly I waveform ( Figure 2 B) had a pitch of 1.1 μm and a diameter of 0.3 μm ( Kamiya and Asakura, 1976 26. Kamiya, R. ∙ Asakura, S. Helical transformations of Salmonella flagella in vitro J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106 :167-186 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Turner et al., 2000 59. Turner, L. ∙ Ryu, W.S. ∙ Berg, H.C. Real-time imaging of fluorescent flagellar filaments J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :2793-2801 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ) from the atomic model. These parameters and the waveform’s right handedness are consistent with the literature ( Turner et al., 2000 59. Turner, L. ∙ Ryu, W.S. ∙ Berg, H.C. Real-time imaging of fluorescent flagellar filaments J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :2793-2801 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). We obtained a similar result for modeling the supercoil of the normal structures ( Figure 2 C). For H6, the pitch was 2.3 μm and diameter was 0.4 μm. The K-12 supercoiled model produced a similar result, where the pitch was 2.2 μm and the diameter was 0.4 μm. Both of the normal supercoils were left handed, and the parameters agreed well with the literature ( Table S1 ) ( Kamiya and Asakura, 1976 26. Kamiya, R. ∙ Asakura, S. Helical transformations of Salmonella flagella in vitro J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106 :167-186 Crossref Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Turner et al., 2000 59. Turner, L. ∙ Ryu, W.S. ∙ Berg, H.C. Real-time imaging of fluorescent flagellar filaments J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182 :2793-2801 Crossref Scopus (568) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, despite the flattening of the overall supercoil in ice, the flagellar filaments retained the local curvature and twist of a flagellum supercoiling in three dimensions. Thus, the microscopic, short-curved BFF structures were indeed representative of the macroscopic supercoiled state, which has continuous uniform curvature in three dimensions.
When assessing the flagellin conformations, we used subunits on the inner and outermost regions of the curve as references ( Figure 3 A). For both, curly I and normal structures, the innercurve subunits were shorter than the outer curve ones when aligned by domain D0 ( Figures 3 B and 3C). We next aligned subunits from each of the 11 protofilaments by domain D1, and we identified 11 flagellin conformations for each waveform state ( Figures 3 D and 3E). The 11 conformations of curly I flagellins ( Figure 3 D) were more different from each other than those of the normal ( Figure 3 E). Importantly, we found that subunits from the same protofilament had nearly identical conformations when aligned by domain D0 compared with subunits from adjacent protofilaments ( Figure S3 E–S3H). We concluded that the small differences between subunits on the same protofilament are caused by noise and/or modeling error ( Figures S3 I–S3L).
We then compared the protofilaments of curly I and normal waveforms by aligning each of the individual 11 protofilaments by the first subunit (S n ) of each protofilament model ( Figure 3 F). From this alignment, we identified 11 protofilament states by examining the top view of subunit S n+22 from each protofilament. Differences between each of the curly I protofilaments ( Figure 3 G) were greater than those of the normal ( Figure 3 H). Nevertheless, the protofilaments in both waveforms differed from each other according to the same circular pattern ( Figures 3 G and 3H) where adjacent protofilaments were more similar to each other than non-adjacent ones. This pattern can be more easily explained by considering their position in the supercoiled structure ( Figures 3 I and 3J). The same amino acid residues face the center of the lumen in each structure. However, the tilt of each protofilament with respect to the center of the flagellar filament is different. Each of the protofilaments is bending into the curve ( Figure 3 J). The innermost protofilament (blue) in the curve is tilting away from the central axis of the filament. The outermost protofilament (pink) is tilting toward the central axis, and the protofilaments intermediate between the outer and inner curves (gold) are tilting in a plane skew to the filament’s central axis. The extent of protofilament bending into the curve is greater in the curly I ( Figure 3 K) state than in the normal form ( Figure 3 L), consistent with the greater curvature in the former.
Historically, the switching between L and R states was viewed to occur along the 5-start interface ( Figures 4 A and 4B) ( Calladine et al., 2013 9. Calladine, C.R. ∙ Luisi, B.F. ∙ Pratap, J.V. A “mechanistic” explanation of the multiple helical forms adopted by bacterial flagellar filaments J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :914-928 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). This 5-start interface constitutes the interface between adjacent protofilaments, whereas the 11-start interface is the interface between two subunits in the same protofilament. For the curly I structure, we find three classes of 5-start interfaces ( Figures 4 C–4E), with 5 longer outer curve interfaces (red, Figures 4 C–4E), four shorter inner curve interfaces (blue, Figures 4 C–4E), and two interfaces of intermediate height (purple, Figures 4 C–4E) in between the inner and outer curve protofilaments. For the normal structures, we observed a similar pattern except that the intermediate interfaces did not exist ( Figures 4 F–4H, S4 A and S4B). Instead, there were three shorter protofilaments (indigo, Figures 4 F–4H) and eight longer ones (red, Figures 4 F–4H) with less of a height difference between the inner and outer interfaces in the normal compared with the curly I. These classes of protofilament height were also only in the z dimension, and a continuous distribution of protofilament conformations was present in the x and y dimensions ( Figures 4 D and 4G).
Because wild-type filaments do not naturally exist in the all-L or all-R states, supercoiling might be a consequence of the kinetic trapping that keeps these filaments away from these minimum energy states. We performed a simple annealing experiment by heating supercoiled flagellar filaments from room temperature to 55°C and allowing them to slowly cool to room temperature ( Figures S4 C and S4E). The BFFs retained their supercoil ( Figures S4 D and S4F), suggesting that the supercoiled state is a favorable energy state under our experimental conditions.
We next sought to apply our method for reconstructing supercoiled flagellar filaments to AFFs from S. islandicus REY15A. Electron micrographs revealed two distinct filament populations ( Figures 5 A and 5B). These were either supercoiled and identified as AFFs or not supercoiled and identified as archaeal T4P. Differences in the surface structures of flagellar filaments and T4P were also observed in cryo-EM images ( Figure 5 B). Using the same workflow as the one used for the BFF reconstruction, we solved the structure of the REY15A flagellar filament imposing a global helical symmetry, which resulted in a density map at ∼4 Å resolution ( Figure S5 A). We then reconstructed the REY15A flagellar filament asymmetrically and obtained a 3.4 Å resolution map with clear curvature ( Figures 5 C and S5 B) and modeled the flagellin subunits into the map ( Figures 5 D and 5F). From this short asymmetric reconstruction, we estimated the curvature to be ∼2 radians/μm ( Table S2 ). Similar to many AFFs and T4P ( Gambelli et al., 2022 19.

The structures of two archaeal type IV pili illuminate evolutionary relationships Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3424 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 62.

Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1401-1410 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), we detected extensive glycosylation with several N-linked glycans on the surface of the structure ( Figures 5 D and 5E). We also found an indication of tyrosine glycosylation ( Figures S5 F and S5G), which is uncommon but has been previously observed in prokaryotes ( Zarschler et al., 2010 69. Zarschler, K. ∙ Janesch, B. ∙ Pabst, M. ... Protein tyrosine O-glycosylation--a rather unexplored prokaryotic glycosylation system Glycobiology. 2010; 20 :787-798 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The N-terminal regions of the preprocessed forms of archaeal flagellins and bacterial and archaeal type IV pilins exist as transmembrane domains ( Thomas et al., 2001 57. Thomas, N.A. ∙ Bardy, S.L. ∙ Jarrell, K.F. The archaeal flagellum: a different kind of prokaryotic motility structure FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25 :147-174 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). After cleavage, these mature subunits assemble into their respective polymers in the absence of a membrane. Interestingly, TMHMM ( Sonnhammer et al., 1998 55. Sonnhammer, E.L. ∙ von Heijne, G. ∙ Krogh, A. A hidden Markov model for predicting transmembrane helices in protein sequences Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6 :175-182 PubMed Google Scholar ) analysis of transmembrane regions for the REY15A flagellin predicted additional transmembrane regions in the C-terminal outer domain ( Figure 6 A). These regions are either β-sheets or loops in the flagellar filament structure ( Figure S6 B). We took the sequences for each of the predicted C-terminal transmembrane regions and analyzed their structure using AlphaFold ( Jumper et al., 2021 25. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16859) PubMed Google Scholar ). For both of the ∼20 amino acid residue spanning regions, the predicted models were α-helical ( Figures S6 C and S6D). As a control, a region predicted not to be transmembrane and that was part of a β-sheet in the filament was predicted to be a β-hairpin by AlphaFold2 ( Figure S6 E). We speculate that these regions of the C-terminal outer domain are indeed transmembrane helices in the preprocessed flagellin monomers and inserted in the archaeal membrane prior to assembly.
The S. islandicus REY15A genome ( Makarova et al., 2016 38. Makarova, K.S. ∙ Koonin, E.V. ∙ Albers, S.V. Diversity and evolution of type IV pili systems in archaea Front. Microbiol. 2016; 7 :667 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) only encodes a single flagellin, unlike some other species of archaea ( Gambelli et al., 2022 19. Gambelli, L. ∙ Isupov, M.N. ∙ Conners, R. ... An archaellum filament composed of two alternating subunits Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :710 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ), which simplifies the interpretation of our results. For example, it is now clear that multiple flagellins within the same filament are not needed for supercoiling. In addition to a prominent 3-start helix with extensive glycosylation ( Figures S6 F and S6G), the REY15A flagellar filament also has a less prominent 10-start surface helix. When comparing helical nets ( Figures 6 H and 6I), the 10-start helices in archaea ( Figures S6 I and S6J) are reminiscent of the nearly vertical 11-start protofilaments of the BFFs because both filaments have low twist ( Figures S6 H and S6I). The 10-start interactions mainly occur for the N-terminal α-helical domain at a relatively small radius in the filament. When we aligned a single subunit from each of these strands, there were 10 subunit states with one of these states being markedly different from any of the others ( Figure 5 E). We also found that the subunits on the same 10-start strand were conformationally similar to each other ( Figure S6 K). This led us to conclude that the AFFs are actually composed of 10 protofilaments ( Figure 5 F). We then aligned all of the 10 archaeal protofilaments by a subunit (S n ) and examined the differences that occur two subunits (S n+20 ) further along the protofilaments ( Figure 5 G). Adjacent protofilaments were more similar to each other except for the two inner-most subunits in the curve (protofilaments I and IX, Figure 5 H). We then built a model for the supercoiled REY15A flagellar filament in the same manner as for the bacterial filaments by aligning subunits from the same protofilament ( Figure 5 I). The resulting supercoil parameters were in good agreement with our negative-stain TEM observations ( Figure 5 A), and the waveform was left handed.
The majority of the interactions between adjacent REY15A protofilaments resemble what is shown in Figure 6 A, where isoleucine 26 of a subunit (S n+3 ) is in close proximity to alanine 35 of a neighboring protofilament subunit (S n ). However, for the interface between two protofilaments labeled I and II ( Figure 6 B) in the inner region of the curve, there is a seam where protofilament I is shifted ∼4 Å down the interface ( Figure 6 B blue inset) when compared with the other nine standard interfaces. This results in the isoleucine 26 of subunit S n+3 moving closer to the isoleucine 32 of neighboring subunit S n . These seam interactions do not occur in the outer domains ( Figures 6 A and 6B red insets), which are similar across all 3-start interfaces. The most conformationally different protofilament (I) is at the very inner region of the curve ( Figure 6 C), which is the location of the seam. We found that the major difference driving this ∼4 Å shearing is the movement of the previously described archaeal flagellin “hinge” ( Gambelli et al., 2022 19. Gambelli, L. ∙ Isupov, M.N. ∙ Conners, R. ... An archaellum filament composed of two alternating subunits Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :710 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 6 D and 6E). This hinge is the linker between the N-terminal core and C-terminal outer domain and corresponds to threonine 66 and alanine 67. The hinge residues adopt different but similar conformations in 9 protofilaments and a drastically different conformation in the subunits belonging to protofilament I ( Figure 6 D). The two most conformationally distinct subunits are, thus, from protofilaments I and II, which is caused by the movement of the hinge region downward in protofilament I relative to protofilament II ( Figure 6 E).

Section: Discussion

For many years, the understanding of BFF supercoiling came from a combination of low-resolution observations ( Macnab, 1976 36. Macnab, R.M. Examination of bacterial flagellation by dark-field microscopy J. Clin. Microbiol. 1976; 4 :258-265 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) of supercoiled filaments coupled with higher resolution structures of straight mutant BFFs ( Yonekura et al., 2003 66. Yonekura, K. ∙ Maki-Yonekura, S. ∙ Namba, K. Complete atomic model of the bacterial flagellar filament by electron cryomicroscopy Nature. 2003; 424 :643-650 Crossref Scopus (599) PubMed Google Scholar ). The result of these studies was the two-state model ( Calladine et al., 2013 9. Calladine, C.R. ∙ Luisi, B.F. ∙ Pratap, J.V. A “mechanistic” explanation of the multiple helical forms adopted by bacterial flagellar filaments J. Mol. Biol. 2013; 425 :914-928 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). With our cryo-EM structures of supercoiled BFFs and AFFs, we now provide a detailed view of the subunits enabling the supercoiling of prokaryotic flagella.
Most flagellar motors must be able to rotate a supercoiled filament in CCW and CW directions. For the BFF, the normal waveform is associated with running or straight swimming coupled to CCW rotation ( Darnton et al., 2007 12. Darnton, N.C. ∙ Turner, L. ∙ Rojevsky, S. ... On torque and tumbling in swimming Escherichia coli J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 :1756-1764 Crossref Scopus (335) PubMed Google Scholar ). When one or several flagellar motors changes to CW rotation, the forces imposed by the motor reversal cause the switching from normal to semi-coiled or curly waveforms, and this screws the filament out of the bundle. For AFFs, altering buffer conditions such as pH and salt concentration change the waveforms of Methanococcus voltae AFFs ( Bardy et al., 2002 5. Bardy, S.L. ∙ Mori, T. ∙ Komoriya, K. ... Identification and localization of flagellins FlaA and FlaB3 within flagella of Methanococcus voltae J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184 :5223-5233 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the visualization of rotating Halobacterium salinarum AFFs revealed little polymorphism or change in handedness upon motor rotational switching ( Kinosita et al., 2016 31. Kinosita, Y. ∙ Uchida, N. ∙ Nakane, D. ... Direct observation of rotation and steps of the archaellum in the swimming halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 1 :16148 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the REY15A AFF, the linker hinge regions (residues 66 and 67) of all subunits exhibited a great degree of flexibility ( Figure 6 D). This hinge changes at the seam in the inner curvature of the supercoil. Flexibility of this linker region has been reported for other AFFs ( Gambelli et al., 2022 19. Gambelli, L. ∙ Isupov, M.N. ∙ Conners, R. ... An archaellum filament composed of two alternating subunits Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :710 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ) as well as T4P ( Wang et al., 2020 60. Wang, F. ∙ Baquero, D.P. ∙ Su, Z. ... The structures of two archaeal type IV pili illuminate evolutionary relationships Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3424 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, its relationship with protofilament conformations in supercoiled AFF was not described. The hinge may allow for the preservation of similar core domain contacts in 9 of the 10 interfaces and a seam in the 10 th inner curvature interface ( Figure 6 ). The REY15A flagellin has a larger C-terminal domain (∼260 total residues) compared with other known archaeal flagellin structures ( Gambelli et al., 2022 19. Gambelli, L. ∙ Isupov, M.N. ∙ Conners, R. ... An archaellum filament composed of two alternating subunits Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :710 Crossref Scopus (16) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meshcheryakov et al., 2019 41. Meshcheryakov, V.A. ∙ Shibata, S. ∙ Schreiber, M.T. ... High-resolution archaellum structure reveals a conserved metal-binding site EMBO Rep. 2019; 20 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Poweleit et al., 2016 50. Poweleit, N. ∙ Ge, P. ∙ Nguyen, H.H. ... CryoEM structure of the Methanospirillum hungatei archaellum reveals structural features distinct from the bacterial flagellum and type IV pilus Nat. Microbiol. 2016; 2 :16222 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ), which generates a very prominent 3-start helix on the surface of the filament ( Figure S6 F), with glycosylated residues forming a ridged surface along the 3-start helix ( Figure S6 G). We speculate that the extensive outer domain 3-start interactions and glycosylations in the REY15A AFF is an adaptation to the natural habitat of S. islandicus by providing additional stability in hot and acidic environments, similar to the glycosylation of S. islandicus LAL14/1 and S. solfataricus T4Ps ( Wang et al., 2020 60. Wang, F. ∙ Baquero, D.P. ∙ Su, Z. ... The structures of two archaeal type IV pili illuminate evolutionary relationships Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :3424 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 62. Wang, F. ∙ Cvirkaite-Krupovic, V. ∙ Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ... An extensively glycosylated archaeal pilus survives extreme conditions Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1401-1410 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The 11 conformations of the BFF protofilaments also change depending on the curvature of the waveform, with the protofilaments being more similar to each other in the normal waveform and more different in the curly I waveform. This is the result of the protofilaments increasing the degree to which they bend into the curve in the curly I compared with the normal state. Many of the components of the bacterial flagellum are homologous to those of type III secretion systems (T3SSs) ( Abby and Rocha, 2012 1. Abby, S.S. ∙ Rocha, E.P. The non-flagellar type III secretion system evolved from the bacterial flagellum and diversified into host-cell adapted systems PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002983 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the lumen of the BFF functions as a channel for protein secretion ( Nedeljković et al., 2021 43. Nedeljković, M. ∙ Sastre, D.E. ∙ Sundberg, E.J. Bacterial flagellar filament: a supramolecular multifunctional nanostructure Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22 :7521 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of the flagellar lumen is preserved in the superhelical states through the conformational continuum of protofilament conformations. The larger differences in protofilament and subunit conformations between the curly I and normal structures ( Figure 3 ) are the result of curvature and the need to preserve the structure of the flagellar lumen.
Considering the abrupt discontinuity in the arrangement of the flagellin subunits in the supercoiled state of the AFF, an analogy might be made to the hexameric Rho transcription-termination helicase. Although early low-resolution EM studies suggested that Rho formed a ring with a C6 symmetry ( Yu et al., 2000 68. Yu, X. ∙ Horiguchi, T. ∙ Shigesada, K. ... Three-dimensional reconstruction of transcription termination factor rho: orientation of the N-terminal domain and visualization of an RNA- binding site J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299 :1279-1287 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ), a high-resolution crystal structure revealed that the ring was actually a “lock washer” with a discontinuity between two of the subunits ( Skordalakes and Berger, 2003 54. Skordalakes, E. ∙ Berger, J.M. Structure of the Rho transcription terminator: mechanism of mRNA recognition and helicase loading Cell. 2003; 114 :135-146 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (216) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is tempting to view wild-type archaeal and bacterial flagellins in a similar manner. For BFFs, which are assembled from subunits with multiple helices ( Figure 7 A), a straight filament with 10 coiled-coil subunits generating 10 identical protofilaments may be possible ( Figure 7 B). However, the subunits may not be able to generate a completed straight flagellar filament containing 11 protofilaments without considerable strain and clashes ( Figure 7 C). Thus, the supercoiled BFF states may indeed also reflect a minimum energy state where there are 11 unique protofilaments, with shorter ones on the inner curve and longer ones on the outside ( Figure 7 D). The situation might be similar for AFFs, but they are composed from a single α-helix in the core ( Figure 7 E), which might easily be able to assemble into a straight polymer containing nine identical protofilaments ( Figure 7 F). However, the addition of a 10 th subunit to complete the AFF might be unable to assemble into a straight polymer due to clashes ( Figure 7 G). As a result, the minimum energy state of the AFF involves 10 protofilament states with a seam at the inner curve ( Figure 7 H).
Both the normal and curly I waveforms would, thus, represent the minimum energy state of the BFF under different conditions. BFFs adopt the normal waveform when they are rotated CCW. When the rotation of the motor switches to CW, the affected BFF breaks out of the bundle and frequently adopts the semi-coiled waveform, followed by curly I. During CW rotation, the right-handed curly I form is, thus, the minimum energy state. This “two-step” transition involving semi-coiled and then curly I waveforms is likely due to the semi-coiled waveform being an intermediate between the normal and curly I waveforms.
Comparisons between higher resolution L- and R-state bacterial flagellins ( Wang et al., 2017 61. Wang, F. ∙ Burrage, A.M. ∙ Postel, S. ... A structural model of flagellar filament switching across multiple bacterial species Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :960 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) reveal larger differences than between the flagellins in the supercoiled structures observed by us ( Figures S7 A–S7D), but these L versus R differences are still much smaller than those based upon lower resolution structures ( Maki-Yonekura et al., 2010 39. Maki-Yonekura, S. ∙ Yonekura, K. ∙ Namba, K. Conformational change of flagellin for polymorphic supercoiling of the flagellar filament Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17 :417-422 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is possible that the L- and R-state switches prevent the shifting of 5-start interfacial interactions ( Figures S7 E and S7F) or subtle conformational switching of the flagellin in other key regions ( Wang et al., 2017 61. Wang, F. ∙ Burrage, A.M. ∙ Postel, S. ... A structural model of flagellar filament switching across multiple bacterial species Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :960 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Similar to both AFFs and BFFs, the supercoiled bacterial flagellar hook contains unique conformational states for each protofilament ( Kato et al., 2019 29. Kato, T. ∙ Makino, F. ∙ Miyata, T. ... Structure of the native supercoiled flagellar hook as a universal joint Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5295 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shibata et al., 2019 53. Shibata, S. ∙ Matsunami, H. ∙ Aizawa, S.I. ... Torque transmission mechanism of the curved bacterial flagellar hook revealed by cryo-EM Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :941-945 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the flagellar hook protein, FlgE, shares no homology to either bacterial or archaeal flagellins. Notably, the conformations adopted by FlgE in the supercoiled structure are more drastically different ( Figure S7 G) from each other than either the bacterial ( Figure S7 H) or archaeal ( Figure S7 I) flagellins in their supercoiled structures. This increased difference among flagellar hook protein conformations is likely due to the much greater curvature of the supercoiled flagellar polyhooks ( Figure S7 J) when compared with BFFs ( Figure S7 K) or AFFs ( Figure S7 L). The increased curvature of the supercoiled flagellar polyhook is likely reflective of the hook’s function as a universal joint rather than a propeller.
Our data presented here show that convergent evolution between archaeal and bacterial flagella extends to the general mechanism underlying the flagellar supercoiling and, hence, motility of bacteria and archaea. These considerations raise new questions about the terminology. The archaeal flagellar system has been called the archaellum ( Jarrell and Albers, 2012 23. Jarrell, K.F. ∙ Albers, S.V. The archaellum: an old motility structure with a new name Trends Microbiol. 2012; 20 :307-312 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) based upon the notion that it has no homology with the bacterial flagellar system. However, the bacterial flagellar system has no homology to eukaryotic flagella, such as the whipping tails of sperms ( Gaffney et al., 2021 18. Gaffney, E.A. ∙ Ishimoto, K. ∙ Walker, B.J. Modelling motility: the mathematics of spermatozoa Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2021; 9 :710825 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) or protozoic trypanosomes ( Langousis and Hill, 2014 35. Langousis, G. ∙ Hill, K.L. Motility and more: the flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2014; 12 :505-518 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet these analogous structures are still called flagella in both bacteria and eukaryotes ( Wirth, 2012 64. Wirth, R. Response to Jarrell and Albers: seven letters less does not say more Trends Microbiol. 2012; 20 :511-512 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). As such, it is our preference to refer to the structures presented in this paper as AFFs and BFFs. Despite the lack of homology between the structural components, the mechanisms of archaeal and bacterial flagellar supercoiling are analogous and examples of convergent evolution, much similar to how the wings of bees and bats have evolved independently.
Although, for BFFs, there has been an extensive analysis of mutations in various domains coupled with light microscopic visualization of flagellar filament waveforms, such data are virtually nonexistent for AFFs. Future studies would hopefully involve the mutagenesis of archaeal flagellins coupled with light microscopy and motility assays. Additionally, we acknowledge that the compressional forces caused by cryo-EM grid preparation could cause slight distortions in our structures. Nevertheless, this is likely a minimal source of error because of the accurate supercoiling parameters we obtain from our coarse-grained models. This study also considers only two of the experimentally observed supercoiled waveforms. Future studies would be required to further investigate how the protofilament and 5-start interactions change across the other experimentally observed waveforms.

E. coli K12 strain MG1655 (motile variant) was grown overnight in LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 0.5% NaCl) at 37 o C. The stationary culture was diluted 1:200 in 800 mL LB and grown to an OD 600 between 1.0 and 1.4. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 8 minutes at 8,000 x g and suspended in 100 mL motility buffer (0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.1 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.2]). EPEC ICC526 (EPEC O127:H6 Δ bfpA + Δ espA ) cells carrying pflhDC were grown to an OD 600 of 0.6 and then induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) resulting in flagella expression ( Kreutzberger et al., 2022 34. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Sobe, R.C. ∙ Sauder, A.B. ... Flagellin outer domain dimerization modulates motility in pathogenic and soil bacteria from viscous environments Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :1422 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Campylobacter jejuni cells were cultured in Mueller Hinton Broth at 37°C ( Kreutzberger et al., 2020 33. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Ewing, C. ∙ Poly, F. ... Atomic structure of the Campylobacter jejuni flagellar filament reveals how ε Proteobacteria escaped toll-like receptor 5 surveillance Proc. Natl.

S. islandicus REY15A ( Guo et al., 2011 21. Guo, L. ∙ Brügger, K. ∙ Liu, C. ... Genome analyses of icelandic strains of Sulfolobus islandicus , model organisms for genetic and virus-host interaction studies J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193 :1672-1680 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) was grown aerobically with shaking (145 rpm) at 75 °C in STV medium containing mineral salts (M), 0.2% (wt/vol) sucrose (S), 0.2% (wt/vol) tryptone (T), a mixed vitamin solution (V) ( Deng et al., 2009 13. Deng, L. ∙ Zhu, H. ∙ Chen, Z. ... Unmarked gene deletion and host-vector system for the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus Extremophiles. 2009; 13 :735-746 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The EPEC H6 flagellar filaments were prepared as previously published ( Kreutzberger et al., 2022 34. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Sobe, R.C. ∙ Sauder, A.B. ... Flagellin outer domain dimerization modulates motility in pathogenic and soil bacteria from viscous environments Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :1422 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the Curly I EPEC H6 sample the final buffer concentration was 1 M Tris/HCl 100 mM NaCl pH 6.5. For the Normal EPEC H6 sample the final buffer concentration was 50 mM Tris/HCl 75 mM NaCl pH 7.4.
Flagella were sheared from cells by agitation in a mixer at full speed for 20 seconds and separated by three centrifugation steps: one at 8,000 x g for 7 minutes, followed by two at 15,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4 o C. Purified flagella were then sedimented at 87,000 x g for 2 hours at 4 o C, washed with motility buffer, and suspended in 200 mL motility buffer. Purity of flagellar filaments was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
S. islandicus REY15A ( Guo et al., 2011 21. Guo, L. ∙ Brügger, K. ∙ Liu, C. ... Genome analyses of icelandic strains of Sulfolobus islandicus , model organisms for genetic and virus-host interaction studies J. Bacteriol. 2011; 193 :1672-1680 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ) was grown aerobically with shaking (145 rpm) at 75 °C in STV medium containing mineral salts (M), 0.2% (wt/vol) sucrose (S), 0.2% (wt/vol) tryptone (T), a mixed vitamin solution (V) ( Deng et al., 2009 13. Deng, L. ∙ Zhu, H. ∙ Chen, Z. ... Unmarked gene deletion and host-vector system for the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus islandicus Extremophiles. 2009; 13 :735-746 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). For isolation of flagellar filaments, REY15A cells were inoculate into 300 ml of MTSV medium at an initial OD 600 of 0.05 and cultivated for 18 h. Once cooled down to room temperature, the cell culture was vortexed to shear off the flagellar filaments from the cell surface. The cells were removed by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 20 min and the flagellar filaments were pelleted from the supernatant by ultra-centrifugation (Type 45Ti rotor, 40,000 rpm) at 10 °C for 2 h.
Wild type C. jejuni 81-176 flagellar filaments were prepared as published ( Kreutzberger et al., 2020 33. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Ewing, C. ∙ Poly, F. ... Atomic structure of the Campylobacter jejuni flagellar filament reveals how ε Proteobacteria escaped toll-like receptor 5 surveillance Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :16985-16991 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ) with filaments using bead beating and centrifugation to pellet the flagellar filaments and other cellular debris.
Diluted 100 μL samples of bacterial flagella were heated at 55 °C for 30 minutes. The samples were then allowed to cool at room temperature for one hour. Samples before and after the annealing experiment were stained on continuous carbon EM grids using 1% phosphotungstic acid pH 7. The negatively stained samples were then imaged with a Technai T12 microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 80 keV.
The cryo-EM grids were prepared for imaging as described previously ( Kreutzberger et al., 2020 33. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Ewing, C. ∙ Poly, F. ... Atomic structure of the Campylobacter jejuni flagellar filament reveals how ε Proteobacteria escaped toll-like receptor 5 surveillance Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :16985-16991 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kreutzberger et al., 2022 34. Kreutzberger, M.A.B. ∙ Sobe, R.C. ∙ Sauder, A.B. ... Flagellin outer domain dimerization modulates motility in pathogenic and soil bacteria from viscous environments Nat. Commun. 2022; 13 :1422 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were plunge frozen using either a Vitrobot Mark IV or a Leica EM GP. For the Vitrobot 3.5-4 μL of sample was applied to the grid and all blot times were 3.5 seconds and the blot forces ranged from 3 to 6. For the Leica 2.5-3 μL of sample was applied to the grid and the blot times were 3.5 S while blot distances ranged from 214-217.
Images were acquired on a Titan Krios equipped with a K3 direct electron detector using a physical pixel size of 1.08 Å/pixel. The acerating voltage was 300 keV.
Helical reconstruction of flagellar filaments was performed in Spider ( Frank et al., 1996 17. Frank, J. ∙ Radermacher, M. ∙ Penczek, P. ... Spider and WEB: processing and visualization of images in 3D electron microscopy and related fields J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :190-199 Crossref Scopus (1841) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the iterative helical real space reconstruction algorithm ( Egelman, 2000 14. Egelman, E.H. A robust algorithm for the reconstruction of helical filaments using single-particle methods Ultramicroscopy. 2000; 85 :225-234 Crossref Scopus (393) PubMed Google Scholar ) and also performed in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 51. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ) with similar results.
Flagellar filaments were reconstructed asymmetrically using cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al., 2017 51. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4028) PubMed Google Scholar ) in a series of steps. First a low-resolution helical volume (∼20-50 Å) was used as the initial volume for homogenous refinement. For all structures this initial round of homogenous refinement showed no curvature in the volume and still appeared largely helical. The particles and mask from this job were then used as inputs for a 3D variability job. The results from this job were reconstructed into 3D variability clusters and the highest resolution cluster with a curved volume was used for subsequent steps. To the best of our knowledge the volumes reconstructed from the 3D variability job represented a sort of “constrained” ab initio reconstruction, as no starting volume was used. However, a mask with general flagella features was as well as the particles containing the alignments parameters from the previous job. For the EPEC H6 reconstructions, a static mask consisting of just the core domains D0 and D1 was used for all steps, while for the E. coli K-12 and S. islandicus REY15A structures a mask consisting of the entire volume was used.
For some of our structures we found the curvature was present in the reconstruction from 3D variability but absent after taking these results as inputs for homogenous refinement. For best results, the chosen cluster of particles and its corresponding volume from 3D variability display was used as an input for a local refinement job with shifts constrained from 5-20 Å and rotational searches from 5-20° depending on the sample being imaged. These results were the used as inputs for local CTF correction followed by a second round of local refinement. For the Curly I EPEC H6 structure we were able to reconstruct curved volumes to 3.4 Å using a particles box size of 384 x 384 pixels and to ∼4.0 Å (3.7 Å with 0.143 GFSC) using a box size of 624x624 pixels. The ∼3 radians/μm curvature of the curly I was present in both structures, however smaller 384 x 384 box sizes for the Normal BFFs as well as the S. islandicus REY15A AFF produced straight volumes with little to no evidence of curvature. The EPEC H6 Normal and S. islandicus REY15A volumes were reconstructed using 624x624 particles boxes. The E. coli K-12 structure was reconstructed with a box size of 512x512.
Local resolution maps were generated in cryoSPARC and visualized using ChimeraX ( Pettersen et al., 2021 49. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF ChimeraX: structure visualization for researchers, educators, and developers Protein Sci. 2021; 30 :70-82 Crossref Scopus (3735) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The core domains D0 and D1 of the previously published EPEC H6 model (7SN7) was used as the initial subunit model for the Curly I and Normal EPEC H6 structures. AlphaFold ( Jumper et al., 2021 25. Jumper, J. ∙ Evans, R. ∙ Pritzel, A. ... Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold Nature. 2021; 596 :583-589 Crossref Scopus (16859) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to generate the starting models for the E. coli K-12 and S. islandicus REY15A flagellin models. For the REY15A AlphaFold model the secondary for each domain was predicted accurately, however the orientation of the C-terminal outer domain relative to the N-terminal core was incorrect. This makes sense because the model could not have accounted for the polymerization of the monomer into a filament. Modeling for each flagellar filament was initiated by fitting a single subunit into each protofilament using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 48. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimeras—a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ). and then refining each model using Coot ( Emsley et al., 2010 15. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each protofilament the subunit initially fit and refined into a protofilament was copied (at least 3 copies each) and each copy was then fit into adjacent subunits along the same protofilament. Each subunit from each protofilament was refined individually in Coot and then each protofilament was refined using real-space refinement in Phenix ( Afonine et al., 2018b 3. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ). For each structure the 11 bacterial or 10 archaeal protofilament models were then combined together into a single model for that flagellar filament, which was subsequently refined in Phenix. The quality of the model was determined using Molprobity ( Williams et al., 2018 63. Williams, C.J. ∙ Headd, J.J. ∙ Moriarty, N.W. ... MolProbity: more and better reference data for improved all-atom structure validation Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :293-315 Crossref Scopus (2301) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To determine the extent to which we could interpret differences between subunits on the same or adjacent protofilaments, we conducted an experiment to predict the error of fitting a subunit into a map. We took a small segment of the H6 curly model in domain D1 ( Figure S3 I) and created 10 copies. To each, a different set of shifts in x, y, and z was applied ( Figure S3 J), with a mean rms shift of 2.6 Å. We then took the shifted models and used Phenix real space refinement to fit them into the corresponding region of the density map ( Figure S3 K). The C α backbones of the 10 models were all quite similar after refinement ( Figure S3 L), and the average backbone rmsd value for the shifted models compared to the starting model was 0.2 Å. This estimate of the uncertainty in our models provided confidence that the detected structural differences between protein subunits are true conformational differences.
All comparisons between flagellin subunits through structural alignments were generated with the matchmaker function in UCSF Chimera. The 3-dimensional plot shown in Figures 4 E and 4H was generated using the free version of Plotly Chart Studio.
For each flagellar filament model only a few atoms from each domain were kept for the coarse-grained model. All other atoms were deleted. The atomic radii of the alpha carbons were increased by ∼20 Å to represent the flagellin subunits as large spheres. The chains of inner-most (lowest resolution) and outer-most (highest resolution) curve protofilaments were aligned in UCSF Chimera according to the scheme from Figure S7 .
A 5 μL aliquot of 10 nM BSA Gold Tracer (Electron Microscopy Sciences™) was added to 10 μL of C. jejuni flagellar filaments. Grids were prepared in an identical fashion to all other flagellar filaments samples except that 300 copper mesh C-flat holey carbon grids were used with 2 μm x 2μm hole size. Tilt series were collected from -60° to +60° tilt with 1.5° degrees between each image and a dose of 4.2 e - /Å 2 . Tomograms were generated using Etomo ( Mastronarde and Held, 2017 40. Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ Held, S.R. Automated tilt series alignment and tomographic reconstruction in IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 2017; 197 :102-113 Crossref Scopus (358) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is part of the IMOD processing suite ( Kremer et al., 1996 32. Kremer, J.R. ∙ Mastronarde, D.N. ∙ McIntosh, J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (4018) PubMed Google Scholar ). Segmentation of the flagellar filaments was then performed to better visualize them in 3-dimensions ( Noske et al., 2008 44. Noske, A.B. ∙ Costin, A.J. ∙ Morgan, G.P. ... Expedited approaches to whole cell electron tomography and organelle mark-up in situ in high-pressure frozen pancreatic islets J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 161 :298-313 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The quantification and statistical analyses are integral parts of the software and algorithms used, cryoSPARC for the generation of the maps and Phenix for the generation of the atomic models.
