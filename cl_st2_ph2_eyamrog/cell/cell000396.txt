Title: Binding and molecular basis of the bat coronavirus RaTG13 virus to ACE2 in humans and other species


Abstract: Summary

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide, causing a global pandemic. Bat-origin RaTG13 is currently the most phylogenetically related virus. Here we obtained the complex structure of the RaTG13 receptor binding domain (RBD) with human ACE2 (hACE2) and evaluated binding of RaTG13 RBD to 24 additional ACE2 orthologs. By substituting residues in the RaTG13 RBD with their counterparts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we found that residue 501, the major position found in variants of concern (VOCs) 501Y.V1/V2/V3, plays a key role in determining the potential host range of RaTG13. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 could induce strong cross-reactive antibodies to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), CB6, that could cross-neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus. These results elucidate the receptor binding and host adaption mechanisms of RaTG13 and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance of coronaviruses (CoVs) carried by animal reservoirs to prevent another spillover of CoVs.

Section: Introduction

Emerging and re-emerging pathogens threaten global public health and cause tremendous economic losses ( Gao, 2018 9. Gao, G.F.

The new coronavirus (CoV) severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was detected and then isolated in early 2020 ( Tan et al., 2020 38. Tan, W. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Ma, X. ...

As of March 5, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO; https://covid19.who.int/ ) has recorded more than 114 million confirmed cases of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally and more than 2.5 million related deaths.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae, enveloped RNA viruses in the order Nidovirales ( https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/?Redirected=true ). CoVs are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta CoVs. Bats are recognized as natural reservoirs of alpha and beta CoVs ( Latinne et al., 2020 20.

Increasing evidence indicates that bat CoVs (bCoVs) are the evolutionary sources of SARS-CoV (beta CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV; beta CoV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV; alpha CoV), human CoV (HCoV)-OC43 (beta CoV), HCoV-NL63 (alpha CoV), and HCoV-229E (alpha CoV) ( Corman et al., 2015 6.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused global outbreaks in the past two decades and confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are still growing in the Middle East region.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to several CoVs from bats ( Chan et al., 2020 4. Chan, J.F. ∙ Kok, K.H. ∙ Zhu, Z. ...

Q. 2020; 40 :68-76 Crossref Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ). RaTG13, sequenced from Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat) in Yunnan province is the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2, with 96.2% identity of the overall genome sequence and 89.3% amino acid identity in the receptor binding domain (RBD) ( Boni et al., 2020 3.

One variance of RaTG13 compared with SARS-CoV-2 is the absence of the four-residue (PRRA) insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site on the spike (S) protein. However, such residue insertions can occur naturally in CoVs, which may contribute to RaTG13 evolving into the causative pathogen of the next potential pandemic. For example, RmYN02, another bCoV, detected in Rhinolophus malayanus , shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with the SARS-CoV-2 genome and contains three-amino-acid-residue (PAA) insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site of its S protein, which is similar to that in SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhou et al., 2020a 54. Zhou, H. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Hu, T. ... A novel bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2 contains natural insertions at the S1/S2 cleavage site of the spike protein Curr. Biol. 2020; 30 :2196-2203.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (379) PubMed Google Scholar ). Considering the similarity between RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 and the devastation caused by SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 may pose a significant threat to humans and other animals. To access this risk, the host range of RaTG13 needs to be investigated.
Receptor binding is the key step for a virus to achieve cross-species infection and transmission ( Li et al., 2020b 24. Li, Y. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Tang, X. ... SARS-CoV-2 and three related coronaviruses utilize multiple ACE2 orthologs and are potently blocked by an improved ACE2-Ig J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e01283 20 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ). The gain of function to interact with the receptor orthologs of another species is also a prerequisite for inter-species transmission ( Su et al., 2016 36. Su, S. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Shi, W. ... Epidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses Trends Microbiol. 2016; 24 :490-502 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2083) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, evaluating the interactions between viral ligands and receptor orthologs of various animals may lead to identification of susceptible hosts. For SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is required for human cell entry by binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD on the S protein ( Lan et al., 2020 19. Lan, J. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Yu, J. ... Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor Nature. 2020; 581 :215-220 Crossref Scopus (4209) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shang et al., 2020 33. Shang, J. ∙ Ye, G. ∙ Shi, K. ... Structural basis of receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 581 :221-224 Crossref Scopus (2642) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2020b 42. Wang, Q. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ... Structural and functional basis of SARS-CoV-2 entry by using human ACE2 Cell. 2020; 181 :894-904.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2116) PubMed Google Scholar ). We and other groups independently discovered ACE2 as the receptor and investigated the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 orthologs of other species. Our previous work revealed that SARS-CoV-2 might have a broad host range, including cats and dogs, which is consistent with the findings of epidemiological studies. Thus, quantifying the interactions between RaTG13 RBD and ACE2 orthologs of domestic and wild animals that are in close proximity to humans could provide clues for determining the host range of RaTG13.
Currently, the structures of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), cat ACE2 (cACE2), bat ACE2 (bACE2), and pangolin ACE2 (pACE2) have been determined ( Lan et al., 2020 19.

Molecular basis of pangolin ACE2 engaged by COVID-19 virus Chin. Sci. Bull. 2021; 66 :73-84 Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar ). These structures revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD utilizes a similar binding mechanism with all four ACE2s, but it forms fewer H-bonds in the interactions with the latter three ACE2s than with hACE2, providing the molecular basis for the decreased binding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the three animal ACE2s. Previous work has reported that RaTG13 RBD binds to hACE2 with a much lower affinity than the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Wrobel et al., 2020 43. Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Benton, D.J. ∙ Xu, P. ... SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 spike glycoprotein structures inform on virus evolution and furin-cleavage effects Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :763-767 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the mechanism of interaction between the RaTG13 RBD and hACE2 remains unclear.
Here the complex structure of RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 was determined, and the underlying mechanism for the lower binding affinity of the RaTG13 RBD compared with that of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2 was resolved. Moreover, the binding ability of 24 ACE2 orthologs, together with hACE2, to the RaTG13 RBD was quantified. We also evaluated the effects of six substitutions between the RaTG13 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD on the interaction with hACE2 and orthologs. Specifically, 501 is most likely the key residue that determines the potential host range of RaTG13. Coincidentally, residue 501 is also the key mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 strains that have been spreading rapidly in many countries, including variant of concern (VOC) lineages 20I/501Y.V1 in the United Kingdom, 20H/501Y.V2 in South Africa, and 20J/501Y.V3 in Brazil and Japan, and also the key mutation of a mouse adaptive SARS-CoV-2 virus strain, indicating that mutation at this residue should be watched closely ( Gu et al., 2020 10. Gu, H. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Yang, G. ... Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice for testing vaccine efficacy Science. 2020; 369 :1603-1607 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, we also found that SARS-CoV-2 could induce a strong cross-reactive immune response to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), CB6, that could cross-neutralize the RaTG13 pseudovirus. These results broaden our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of RaTG13 RBD binding to hACE2 and the potential host adaption of RaTG13, providing evidence emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance of CoVs carried by other potential animal reservoirs, monitoring RaTG13 and its related CoVs especially closely.

Section: Results

Sequence alignments of the RaTG13 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were performed. Overall, the RBDs of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 showed an 89.3% amino acid identity ( Figure S1 A). The complex structure indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD forms 14 hydrogen bonds through 10 amino acids in its interaction with hACE2. Only 3 of 10 amino acids differed between the RaTG13 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure S1 A). However, the binding affinity of the RaTG13 RBD to hACE2 ( K D = 3.86 μM) was approximately 2-log lower than that of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2 ( K D = 21.1 nM) ( Figures 1 A and 1B). To investigate whether RaTG13 infects host cells by binding to hACE2, a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotyped RaTG13, which incorporates the S protein of RaTG13, was used to attempt to transduce HeLa cells expressing hACE2 (HeLa-hACE2s). A similar amount of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (as determined by quantitative real-time PCR) was used as a positive control. The RaTG13 pseudovirus and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus were unable to transduce HeLa cells; however, both pseudoviruses were able to transduce HeLa-hACE2s, but the RaTG13 pseudovirus displayed a substantially lower transduction efficiency than the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ( Figure 1 C).
To analyze the molecular mechanism behind this difference, the complex protein of RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 was prepared by co-infection of insect cells with baculoviruses expressing the RaTG13 RBD and hACE2 ( Figure S1 B). The stable complex was further purified and crystallized. Finally, we obtained diffraction data and determined the complex structure at a resolution of 3.1 Å ( Table 1 ). There are two RBD and hACE2 complex molecules in one asymmetric unit. The electron densities of residues S19–A614 of hACE2 and residues T333–P527 of RaTG13 RBD were observed clearly. Five N-glycans linked to N53, N90, N103, N322, and N546 on hACE2 and one N-glycan linked to N343 of RaTG13 RBD were identified ( Figure 1 D).
Overall, the complex structure of the RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 is extremely similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with hACE2 ( Lan et al., 2020 19. Lan, J. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Yu, J. ...

Yan, R. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Li, Y. ... Structural basis for the recognition of SARS-CoV-2 by full-length human ACE2 Science. 2020; 367 :1444-1448 Crossref Scopus (3652) PubMed Google Scholar ), with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.012 Å. Similar to other beta CoV RBDs, RaTG13 RBD consists of a core subdomain and an external subdomain ( Han et al., 2017 14. Han, X. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Song, H. ... Structure of the S1 subunit C-terminal domain from bat-derived coronavirus HKU5 spike protein Virology. 2017; 507 :101-109 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). The external subdomain is dominated by a disulfide bond-stabilized flexible loop that connects two small β strands ( Figure 1 D). The binding interface of hACE2 with RaTG13 RBD is distributed into two patches. Patch 1 is located on the N-terminal α1 and α2 helixes, and Patch 2 is on the conformational surface consisting of the residues from α1 together with a β-hairpin constituted by β3 and β4. In patch 1, residues S19 and K31 from α1 and Y83 from α2 form a hydrogen bond network with residues S477, Y493, N487, and Y489 of the RaTG13 RBD ( Figures 1 E and 1G; Table 2 ). In patch 2, residues D38, Q42, and Y41 from α2 and K353 from the loop linking β3 and β4 form a hydrogen bond network with residues Y498, T500, and G502 ( Figures 1 F and 1H; Table 2 ).
The total contacts of the RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 (113 contacts) are significantly less than those of SARS-CoV-2 with the same receptor (141 contacts). Specifically, there are 48 contacts between the RaTG13 RBD and hACE2 in patch 1, which is fewer than those in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the hACE2 complex (60 contacts) ( Figure 1 G). Similarly, in patch 2, fewer contacts are formed between the RaTG13 RBD and hACE2 than between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 (65 versus 81) ( Figure 1 H). Moreover, there are substantially fewer hydrogen bonds in patch 2 of the RaTG13 RBD with hACE2 than of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the hACE2 complex (4 versus 9) ( Figure 1 H).
The buried surface area of the RaTG13 RBD bound to hACE2 is 1604 Å 2 , which is smaller than that of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the hACE2 complex (1,773 Å 2 ). Specifically, residues G446 and F490 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD contributed to contact with hACE2, whereas the corresponding residues of the RaTG13 RBD (G446 and Y490) did not ( Figure 1 I). On the binding surface with hACE2, the RaTG13 RBD displays six differences compared with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD: Y449F, F486L, Q493Y, Q498Y, N501D, and Y505H ( Figure 1 J).
To evaluate the potential host range of RaTG13, we analyzed the sequence of hACE2 and of 24 other animals belonging to nine orders, including primates (human and monkey), Lagomorpha (rabbit), Rodentia (mouse and rat), Pholidota (Malayan pangolin), Carnivora (cat, civet, fox, dog, and raccoon dog), Perissodactyla (horse), Artiodactyla (pig, wild Bactrian camel, alpaca, bovine, goat, and sheep), Chiroptera (intermediate horseshoe bat, least horseshoe bat, little brown bat, fulvous fruit bat, greater horseshoe bat, and big-eared horseshoe bat), and Afrotheria (lesser hedgehog tenrec) ( Figure S1 C). The 16 key residues in hACE2 responsible for the interaction with the RaTG13 RBD were highlighted and compared with the 24 ACE2 orthologs. Sequence alignment showed a range of 0–9 residue substitutions in the ACE2 orthologs. Overall, residues distributed in patch 1 are more diverse than residues in patch 2 ( Figure S1 C). Specifically, residues F28 and D355 are fully conserved among all ACE2 orthologs compared in this study. Residues S19, Y41, Q42, L45, and G354 of hACE2 were substituted in no more than three ACE2 orthologs among the 24 species ( Figure S1 C).
We subsequently tested the binding of ACE2 orthologs with the RaTG13 RBD or SARS-CoV-2 RBD using eGFP-fused ACE2 orthologs expressed on the cell surface via flow cytometry. The MERS-CoV RBD was the negative control. The RaTG13 RBD interacted with cells expressing primate (human and monkey), Lagomorpha (rabbit), Carnivora (cat, fox, dog, and raccoon dog), Perissodactyla (horse), and Artiodactyla (pig, wild Bactrian camel, bovine, goat, and sheep) ACE2s ( Figures 2 A and S2 ). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD also interacted with the abovementioned ACE2s, albeit with a higher fluorescence shift. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also interacted with Malayan pangolin, alpaca, intermediate horseshoe bat, and big-eared horseshoe bat ACE2s, as reported previously, whereas the RaTG13 RBD does not ( Figures 2 A and S2 ). Another differing binding feature was that the RaTG13 RBD, but not the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, showed positive binding to mouse ACE2 ( Figures 2 A and S2 ). No detectable interactions were observed between either RBDs with rat, least horseshoe bat, little brown bat, fulvous fruit bat, greater horseshoe bat, or lesser hedgehog tenrec ACE2 orthologs ( Figures 2 A and S2 ).
To clarify the interactions between the RaTG13 RBD and ACE2 orthologs from different animals, we quantified their binding affinities via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The RaTG13 RBD was capable of binding to human, monkey, rabbit, cat, fox, dog, raccoon dog, horse, pig, bovine, wild Bactrian camel, goat, sheep, and mouse ACE2, with equilibrium dissociation constant ( K D ) values of 0.5–7.14 μM, but were unable to interact with Malayan pangolin, civet, little brown bat, least horseshoe bat, big-eared horseshoe bat, or lesser hedgehog tenrec ACE2s ( Figure 2 B). Notably, the RaTG13 RBD displayed an ~5-fold stronger affinity to horse ACE2 than to hACE2 (0.5 ± 0.12 μM versus 2.7 ± 1.27 μM) ( Figure 2 B). We performed a BLAST search to identify the 10 ACE2 orthologs that are most phylogenetically related to horse ACE2 and observed that most residues interacting with the RaTG13 RBD are conserved ( Figure S3 ). Three of these ten ACE2 orthologs, wild Bactrian camel, cat, and alpaca ACE2, were included here, all of which showed binding to the RaTG13 RBD ( Figure 2 B). Although flow cytometry results showed no interactions between RaTG13 RBD and ACE2 orthologs of rat, alpaca, intermediate horseshoe bat, fulvous fruit bat, or greater horseshoe bat ( Figures 2 A and S2 ), SPR results showed RaTG13 can bind to these ACE2s, with K D values of 11.42–38.63 μM) ( Figures 2 A and 2B).
To evaluate the roles of six substitutions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 RBD in binding to the human receptor, we mutated the residues in the RaTG13 RBD to those of their SARS-CoV-2 RBD counterparts. Thus, we prepared six RaTG13 RBD mutants containing F449Y, L486F, Y493Q, Y498Q, D501N, and H505Y, respectively. Another mutant, called the 6 mutant, where all six RaTG13 residues were exchanged for their SARS-CoV-2 RBD counterparts, was also prepared. We evaluated their ability to interact with hACE2. Compared with the wild-type RaTG13 RBD, the F449Y, L486F, D501N, and H505Y mutants showed stronger interactions with hACE2, with binding affinity increased by about ~3.5-, ~3.1-, ~8.0-, and ~4.0-fold respectively, whereas the Y493Q mutation substantially decreased the binding affinity to hACE2, and the Y498Q mutation abolished the interaction with hACE2 ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S4 ). More importantly, the binding affinity of the 6 mutant to human, mouse, horse, and intermediate horseshoe bat ACE2 orthologs showed similar binding characteristics to those of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 3 B). The pseudovirus infection assay also indicated that the RaTG13 pseudovirus integrating the S protein with the 6 mutant increased transduction to HeLa-hACE2 cells, although this was still significantly weaker than the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus ( Figures 3 C and 3D).
Structural analysis revealed the basis of why the RaTG13 RBD has a lower binding affinity with hACE2 compared with that of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Some differing residues on the RaTG13 RBD form fewer contacts than their SARS-CoV-2 RBD counterparts, including F449, L486, D501, and H505. Specifically, RaTG13 RBD F449 contacts the D38 of hACE2 through van der Waals (vdw) force (4 contacts), whereas Y449 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD forms stronger interactions with two potential hydrogen bonds (with D38 and Q42 of hACE2) and seven vdw contacts ( Figure 4 A). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RBD F486 closely packs against the F28, L79, M82, and Y83 residues of hACE2 and forms a small patch of hydrophobic interactions at the interface, and N501 forms a hydrogen bond with Y41 of hACE2. In contrast, RaTG13 RBD L486 interacts with M82 through only one vdw contact ( Figure 4 B), and D501 contacts Y41 through vdw contacts ( Figure 4 C). H505 of the RaTG13 RBD and Y505 of SARS-CoV-2 are in contact with K353 and G354, but SARS-CoV-2 Y505 also binds to an extra E37 on hACE2 ( Figure 4 D).
Some other substituted residues on RaTG13 RBD form weaker interactions compared with their SARS-CoV-2 RBD counterparts. RaTG13 RBD Y493 interacts with hACE2 K31 through a hydrogen bond, whereas SARS-CoV-2 RBD Q493 only interacts with hACE2 H34 and E35 through vdw interactions because of different conformations ( Figure 4 E). Additionally, although RaTG13 RBD Y498 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD Q498 are able to form two potential hydrogen bonds with hACE2 D38 and Q42, RaTG13 RBD Y498 is 0.1 Å closer to hACE2 Q42 compared with SARS-CoV-2 RBD Q498. Thus, substitution from Y498 to Q498 potentially weakened the interactions between RaTG13 RBD Y498 and hACE2, explaining the inability of the RaTG13 RBD Y498Q mutant to interact with the human receptor ( Figure 4 F).
To further evaluate changes in binding affinity because of the six RaTG13 mutants, we chose the ACE2 orthologs from horse, mouse, and intermediate horseshoe bat for in-depth analysis. Horse ACE2 was chosen because it binds to the RaTG13 RBD with a higher affinity than hACE2, whereas mouse ACE2 was chosen for its distinct binding feature to the RaTG13 RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As the origin of RaTG13, intermediate horseshoe bat ACE2 was also included in this analysis.
Our results showed a broad spectrum of binding abilities to these ACE2 orthologs among the RaTG13 RBD mutants. Specifically, the H505Y mutant increased the binding affinity with the three chosen ACE2s by ~4.3-fold (mouse ACE2), ~4.6-fold (horse ACE2), and ~7.3-fold (intermediate horseshoe bat), respectively ( Table S3 ). The D501N mutant displayed increased binding affinities to the ACE2s of human and intermediate horseshoe bat by 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively, and decreased binding affinity with mouse ACE2 by ~14-fold ( Table S3 ). The L486F mutant also displayed decreased interaction with mouse ACE2 (~1.8-fold) but favored the interaction with hACE2 ( Table S3 ). Unlike D501N and L486F, which increased adaptation to the human ACE2 and decreased affinity for the mouse ACE2, F449Y showed benefit to the association to hACE2 (~2.7-fold) and mouse ACE2 (~2.5-fold) but abolished binding to its natural host ACE2 ( Table S3 ; Figures 3 A, 3B, and S4 ). The Y493Q mutant could not interact with ACE2s from mouse or intermediate horseshoe bat and displayed substantial decreased interaction with human ACE2 (~3.7-fold) but favored association with horse ACE2 (2.1-fold increase) ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S4 ). The Y498Q mutant maintained binding to horse ACE2 with substantially decreased binding affinity (~13.6-fold), whereas the other four mutants (F449Y, L486F, Y493Q, and D501N) had little effect on the interaction with the horse receptor, with the K D fluctuating within a ~3-fold range ( Figures 3 A, 3B, and S4 ).
Differential amino acids on ACE2 orthologs may also have a significant effect on the interaction with viral RBDs. The complex structure revealed that the Y41 and K353 residues of hACE2 mediate the contacts with RaTG13 RBD D501. However, Y41 is relatively conserved among the 25 ACE2s analyzed, suggesting that it may not play an important role in determining binding affinity. In contrast, K353 is present in the majority of the ACE2 orthologs, but not in mouse and rat ACE2, where it has been substituted with H353. Thus, considering that K353 of hACE2 is also a key residue for binding with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to infect mice and rats, we introduced K353H into hACE2 to investigate the relevance for the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to bind to mouse and rat ACE2s. Through flow cytometry analysis, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (containing N501) is more likely to bind to cells expressing hACE2 (containing K353) compared with cells expressing the hACE2 K353H mutant. In contrast, RaTG13 RBD (containing D501) binds preferentially to the K353H mutant of hACE2 ( Figure 4 G). Introducing D501N to RaTG13 RBD shifted the binding preference of the parental RBD from H353 to K353 ( Figure 4 G). These results indicate that RaTG13 RBD D501 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD N501 favor binding with H353 and K353, respectively, suggesting that RaTG13 RBD D501 plays a key role in the ability to bind to mouse and rat ACE2s and providing an explanation for the inability of SARS-CoV-2 to interact with mouse and rat ACE2s.
To assess the cross-reactive immune response of SARS-CoV-2 to RaTG13, we tested binding of the RaTG13 RBD with six COVID-19 convalescent sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in all six convalescent donors’ sera could cross-recognize the RaTG13 RBD with an endpoint titer of 10 3 –10 4 , which was slightly lower than that of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figures 5 A and 5B). In contrast, sera from three healthy donors showed no binding to the RaTG13 RBD or SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figures 5 A and 5B). We then evaluated the neutralization activity of three COVID-19 convalescent sera against SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 pseudoviruses. Interestingly, although all three sera showed effective neutralization against the RaTG13 pseudovirus, only one completely neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, whereas the other two only partially neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at the highest concentration ( Figure 5 C).
To assess the ability of SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAbs to cross-react with the RaTG13 RBD, we tested the binding affinity of six SARS-CoV-2 RBD mAbs (REGN10933, REGN10987, C110, H4, B38, CB6, and S2H14) with the RaTG13 RBD ( Barnes et al., 2020 2.

A noncompeting pair of human neutralizing antibodies block COVID-19 virus binding to its receptor ACE2 Science. 2020; 368 :1274-1278 Crossref Scopus (757) PubMed Google Scholar ) to the RaTG13 RBD. Our data showed that CB6 binds to the RaTG13 RBD with the highest binding affinity (39.1 nM) among these six mAbs ( Figure 5 D). The binding affinities of REGN10933, REGN10987, C110, and B38 with the RaTG13 RBD were decreased 100- to 10,000-fold compared with their corresponding affinities for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 5 D). H4 and S2H14, which bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with high affinities (1.76 nM and 4.12 nM, respectively), lost the ability to interact with the RaTG13 RBD ( Figure 5 D). Flow cytometry analysis indicates that, in the presence of the CB6 antibody, the numbers of events in which hACE2-expressing cells bind to SARS-CoV-2 or RaTG13 were decreased substantially in a CB6 concentration-dependent manner ( Figures 5 E and S5 ). Finally, by applying CB6 to the RaTG13 pseudovirus, we found that CB6 could effectively neutralize the RaTG13 pseudovirus, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 0.3632 μg/mL ( Figure 5 F).

Section: Discussion

Increasing studies indicate that SARS-CoV-2 shares a common ancestor with bCoVs, and bats are suspected to be the reservoir host. So far, RaTG13, sequenced from bats, is the virus most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhou et al., 2020b 55. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (14912) PubMed Google Scholar ). Quantification of the association between RaTG13 and its human receptor and those of wild and domestic animals is critical for evaluating the potential inter-species transmission of RaTG13 to control and prevent related infectious diseases, especially in humans ( Su et al., 2016 36. Su, S. ∙ Wong, G. ∙ Shi, W. ... Epidemiology, genetic recombination, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses Trends Microbiol. 2016; 24 :490-502 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2083) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The binding affinity between the RaTG13 RBD and hACE2 is approximately 70-fold lower than that between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 because of the substantially reduced area of the buried surface and decreased network of hydrogen bonds in the RaTG13 RBD-hACE2 complex structure. In addition, substituting six residues on the RaTG13 RBD (F449Y, L486F, Y493Q, Y498Q, D501N, and H505Y) with their counterparts on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD rescued the binding affinity of RaTG13 with hACE2. Such observation is consistent with a recent report that identified the importance of these RaTG13 mutations for binding to hACE2 ( Conceicao et al., 2020 5. Conceicao, C. ∙ Thakur, N. ∙ Human, S. ... The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has a broad tropism for mammalian ACE2 proteins PLoS Biol. 2020; 18 :e3001016 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we provide substantially more data indicating the effect of these mutations on binding with ACE2s from mouse, horse, and intermediate horseshoe bat.
The cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the RaTG13 S protein was reported recently, and through structural alignments of the RaTG13 S protein and SARS-CoV-2 S protein, RaTG13 RBD Y493 was speculated to confer a potential steric clash to hACE2 ( Wrobel et al., 2020 43. Wrobel, A.G. ∙ Benton, D.J. ∙ Xu, P. ... SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 spike glycoprotein structures inform on virus evolution and furin-cleavage effects Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 27 :763-767 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the structure of the RaTG13 RBD in complex with hACE2 reported here indicates that RaTG13 RBD Y493 forms a hydrogen bond with hACE2 K31.
Most of the 24 ACE2 orthologs have weaker binding affinity for the RaTG13 RBD than the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, with ACE2s from mouse and rat as two exceptions. Through analysis of mutations, we identified D501 on RaTG13 as the key residue to bind to ACE2s of mouse and rat, which also explains why SARS-CoV-2 (N501) is unable to interact with mouse and rat ACE2s. N501Y was identified in a mouse adaptive SARS-CoV-2 virus strain that enhances the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and mouse ACE2 ( Gu et al., 2020 10. Gu, H. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Yang, G. ... Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice for testing vaccine efficacy Science. 2020; 369 :1603-1607 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 carrying the N501Y mutation has been spreading widely in many countries with different mutations, including VOCs 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20H/501Y.V3 (Brazil/Japan), indicating that this mutation is the “hotspot” for host adaptation. It is believed that human infection with novel CoVs is related to a “hot jump” of the viruses from reservoir (bat)-intermediate-host. Our work here with bat-origin RaTG13 further confirms that residue 501 is the key amino acid position in the S protein for bat-intermediate-host adaptation, which implicates that RaTG13 has the potential for interspecies transmission.
Among the ACE2 orthologs from humans and 24 animals, horse ACE2 has the highest binding affinity with the RaTG13 RBD even after introduction of the Y498Q substitution on the RaTG13 RBD, which abolishes binding with ACE2s from human, mouse, and intermediate horseshoe bat. Our previous study indicates that horse ACE2 also possesses high binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Wu et al., 2020b 45. Wu, L. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Liu, K. ... Broad host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 binding to cat ACE2 Cell Discov. 2020; 6 :68 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, so far, no evidence indicating susceptibility of horse ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported. Other host factors may evolve, and further studies are needed. Because non-SARS-CoV-2 beta CoVs are widespread in horses ( Haake et al., 2020 13. Haake, C. ∙ Cook, S. ∙ Pusterla, N. ... Coronavirus infections in companion animals: virology, epidemiology, clinical and pathologic features Viruses. 2020; 12 :1023 Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar ), which could potentially result in recombination between CoVs, horses and other species with similar ACE2s, especially ones in close proximity to bats, should be monitored closely to prevent inter-species CoV transmission, which could ultimately result in human infection.
Interestingly, our data, together with previous reports, indicate that RaTG13 possesses different binding spectra to ACE2 orthologs compared with those of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that RaTG13 has undergone diverse evolutionary routes compared with SARS-CoV-2. For example, although civets and pangolins have been proposed to play roles in transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively ( Guan et al., 2003 11. Guan, Y. ∙ Zheng, B.J. ∙ He, Y.Q. ... Isolation and characterization of viruses related to the SARS coronavirus from animals in southern China Science. 2003; 302 :276-278 Crossref Scopus (1848) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lam et al., 2020 18. Lam, T.T. ∙ Jia, N. ∙ Zhang, Y.W. ... Identifying SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins Nature. 2020; 583 :282-285 Crossref Scopus (1190) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xiao et al., 2020 48. Xiao, K. ∙ Zhai, J. ∙ Feng, Y. ... Isolation of SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus from Malayan pangolins Nature. 2020; 583 :286-289 Crossref Scopus (480) PubMed Google Scholar ), our data showed that the ACE2 orthologs of these species do not interact with the RaTG13 RBD. Our previous work showed that Rodentia (mouse and rat) ACE2s were unable to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Wu et al., 2020b 45. Wu, L. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Liu, K. ... Broad host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 binding to cat ACE2 Cell Discov. 2020; 6 :68 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the data presented here indicate that they can bind to the RaTG13 RBD.
The intermediate horseshoe bat is the host from which RaTG13 was originally sequenced, but its ACE2 only binds weakly to the RaTG13 RBD. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon has been observed in other CoVs, including SARS-CoV ( Wu et al., 2020b 45. Wu, L. ∙ Chen, Q. ∙ Liu, K. ... Broad host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the molecular basis for SARS-CoV-2 binding to cat ACE2 Cell Discov. 2020; 6 :68 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), SARS-related CoVs ( Guo et al., 2020 12. Guo, H. ∙ Hu, B.J. ∙ Yang, X.L. ... Evolutionary arms race between virus and host drives genetic diversity in bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus spike genes J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e00902-e00920 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), and MERS-CoV ( Yuan et al., 2020 51. Yuan, Y. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Peng, R. ... Molecular basis of binding between Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and CD26 from seven bat species J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e01387 e01319 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), possibly because of the unique immune system of bats. Specifically, some pivotal receptors for natural killer (NK) cell activation are not expressed in bat NK cells, and the signaling pathway of type I interferons (IFNs) is suppressed by reduction of the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) pathway in bats ( Pavlovich et al., 2018 31. Pavlovich, S.S. ∙ Lovett, S.P. ∙ Koroleva, G. ...

Dampened STING-dependent interferon activation in bats Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :297-301.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013 52. Zhang, G. ∙ Cowled, C. ∙ Shi, Z. ... Comparative analysis of bat genomes provides insight into the evolution of flight and immunity Science. 2013; 339 :456-460 Crossref Scopus (451) PubMed Google Scholar ). Besides the suppressed innate immune response, bats also have a special adaptive immune system, exemplified by the unusual peptide presentation features brought by specific 3-amino-acid insertion in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ( Lu et al., 2019 27. Lu, D. ∙ Liu, K. ∙ Zhang, D. ... Peptide presentation by bat MHC class I provides new insight into the antiviral immunity of bats PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000436 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, polymorphisms of Rhinolophus sinicus ACE2 confer varied susceptibility to SARS-related CoV infection ( Guo et al., 2020 12. Guo, H. ∙ Hu, B.J. ∙ Yang, X.L. ... Evolutionary arms race between virus and host drives genetic diversity in bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus spike genes J. Virol. 2020; 94 :e00902-e00920 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The polymorphism of ACE2 may also exist in intermediate horseshoe bats, which show different binding capacities to the RaTG13 RBD.
RaTG13 has a broad host range, which suggests that acquisition of other adaptive mutations can further broaden its host range. Thus, RaTG13 and related CoVs can possibly jump the species barrier to humans and have pandemic potential when they acquire adaptive mutations required for human infection. Evaluating the cross-reactive immune response of SARS-CoV-2 to RaTG13 revealed that serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors could more efficiently cross-neutralize the RaTG13 pseudovirus than the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, probably because of the lower binding affinity between hACE2 and the RaTG13 RBD than the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Thus, lower concentrations of neutralizing antibodies are required to block binding of the receptor to the RaTG13 RBD than to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD; therefore, fewer neutralizing antibodies are needed to neutralize the RaTG13 pseudovirus than the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Moreover, our studies using SARS-CoV-2 RBD monoclonal antibodies show that many of these antibodies interact with RaTG13 with a 10 3 -fold reduced binding affinity. One exception with high binding affinity with RaTG13 is CB6, a SARS-CoV-2 mAb identified previously by our group that could bind to RaTG13 with high affinity and neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus infection of HeLa-hACE2s.
Our approach for analyzing the host range of RaTG13 by studying the interaction between the RaTG13 RBD and ACE2 is limited because we only examine the binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor. RaTG13 may potentially infect cells through other receptors besides ACE2. Further studies are required to identify whether RaTG13 utilizes other receptors for cell entry. Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 also requires S protein priming by cellular proteases, such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin ( Hoffmann et al., 2020 16. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ... SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and is blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor Cell. 2020; 181 :271-280.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (13999) PubMed Google Scholar ), which should be addressed in the future studies.

The full-length coding sequence of the 25 ACE2 orthologs was synthesized and cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector for flow cytometry ( Table S1 ). The extracellular domain of these 25 ACE2 orthologs fused with the Fc domain of mouse IgG (mFc) were cloned into the pCAGGS vector for protein expression. The coding sequences of RaTG13 RBD (residues 319-541, GenBank: QHR63300.2), SARS-CoV-2 RBD (residues 319-541, GISAID: EPI_ISL_402119), MERS-CoV RBD (residues 367-606, GenBank: JX869059 ) and hACE2 (residues 19-615, NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001358344.1) were cloned into pFastBac vectors ( Dai et al., 2020 7. Dai, L. ∙ Zheng, T. ∙ Xu, K. ...

The wild-type RaTG13 RBD (residues 319-541, GenBank: QHR63300.2) and mutated RaTG13 RBDs (F449Y, L486F, Q493Y, Q498Y, D501N and H505Y) were cloned in pCAGGS vectors. The coding sequence of RaTG13 S (residues 1-1233) and SARS-CoV-2 S (residues 1-1255) were cloned into pCAGGS vectors. The variable region of MAbs, REGN10933 (PDB: 6XDG ), REGN10987 (PDB: 6XDG ), C110 (PDB: 7K8P ), and S2H14 (PDB: 4JX3 ) fused with the constant region of IgG1 were cloned into pCAGGS vectors. The extracellular domain of PD-L1 was constructed as previously described.
The 25 ACE2 orthologs fused with mFc and 7 MAbs were expressed and purified from the culture supernatants of HEK293F cells using a Protein A affinity column (GE Healthcare) and further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex™ 200 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were stored in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl (pH 8.0). Proteins for SPR assay were transferred to PBST (1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) buffer.
The recombinant baculovirus-expressed proteins were expressed and purified as previously described ( Tan et al., 2017 37. Tan, S. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Chai, Y. ... An unexpected N-terminal loop in PD-1 dominates binding by nivolumab Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14369 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the RaTG13 RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, MERS-CoV RBD, and hACE2 proteins were expressed by infecting Hi5 cells with recombinant baculovirus containing the corresponding coding sequences. The RaTG13 RBD/hACE2 complex protein was expressed by co-infecting Hi5 cells with recombinant baculovirus containing the coding sequence of RaTG13 RBD and hACE2. The wild-type RaTG13 RBD (residues 319-541, GenBank: QHR63300.2) and mutated RaTG13 RBDs (F449Y, L486F, Q493Y, Q498Y, D501N and H505Y) cloned in pCAGGS were expressed in HEK293F cells. Cell culture supernatants were collected, filtered with a 0.22 μm filter, purified by His-Trap HP column (GE Healthcare), and further purified by Superdex™ 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were stored in protein buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl).
Plasmids containing the 25 ACE2 orthologs fused with eGFP were transfected into HEK293T cells. Cells were harvested after 24 h post-transfection, washed thrice, and incubated with 100 μL 30 μg/mL test proteins (SARS-CoV-2 RBD, RaTG13 RBD and MERS RBD with histidine tag) at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove redundant protein and incubated with anti-His/APC antibodies (1:500, Miltenyi Biotec) at 37°C for 30 minutes. Finally, cells were washed for thrice before being analyzed using a BD FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).
The plasmid containing recombinant hACE2 or mutated ACE2s was stably transfected into BHK-21 cells (BHK-hACE2). A mixture containing SARS-CoV-2 RBD (10 μg/mL), RaTG13 RBD (10 μg/mL) and CB6 antibody were pre-incubated at 4°C for 30 min, and then incubated with the BHK-hACE2 cells at 4°C for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS thrice and stained with APC mouse anti-his secondary antibody for 30 min before being analyzed using BD FACS Canto Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data of all samples were analyzed using FlowJo 7.6 (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).
The 25 ACE2-mFC fusion proteins were transferred into HBST buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) and immobilized on the CM 5 chip ( Table S2 ). Then, serially diluted wild-type or mutated RaTG13 RBD proteins flowed over the chip in HBST buffer. PD-L1 protein was used as negative control. Binding affinities were measured using a BIAcore 8K (GE Healthcare) at 25°C in the single-cycle mode. Binding kinetics were analyzed with Biacore™ Insight software (GE healthcare) using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
The seven recombinant antibodies (2 μg/mL) were first captured on flow cell 2 of the protein A sensor chip (GE Healthcare) at more than 500 response units ( Table S4 ). Flow cell 1 was used as the negative control. Then, serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 RBD or RaTG13 RBD proteins flowed over the chip in PBST buffer. Response Units (RU) were measured with a BIAcore 8K (GE Healthcare) at 25°C in single-cycle mode. The antibodies were regenerated with 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 1.5). The equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) of each pair of interactions were calculated using BIAcore® 8K Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare) by fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model.
The SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBD proteins were first diluted to 2 μg/mL with 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and then coated onto 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, USA) by overnight incubation at 4°C. Plates were blocked in 5% skim milk in PBST and incubated with serially diluted serum samples. Each serum sample was prepared in triplicate. Subsequently, plates were incubated with goat anti-human IgG-HRP antibody (Thermo Fisher, USA) and developed with 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. The reactions were stopped with 2 M sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA). The endpoint titer was defined as the highest reciprocal dilution of serum to give an absorbance greater than 2.1-fold that of the background values. Antibody titers below the limit of detection were determined to be half the limit of detection.
The RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were constructed with a GFP-encoding replication-deficient vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector backbone (VSV-ΔG-GFP) and the coding sequence of corresponding spike proteins, as previously described ( Li et al., 2020a 23. Li, Q. ∙ Wu, J. ∙ Nie, J. ... The impact of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike on viral infectivity and antigenicity Cell. 2020; 182 :1284-1294.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ; Muik et al., 2021 29. Muik, A. ∙ Wallisch, A.K. ∙ Sänger, B. ... Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 pseudovirus by BNT162b2 vaccine-elicited human sera Science. 2021; 371 :1152-1153 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293T cells were transfected with 30 μg of the spike protein expression plasmids. The VSV-ΔG-GFP pseudovirus was added 24h post-transfection. The inoculum was removed after incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The culture medium were then changed into DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 μg/mL of anti-VSV-G antibody (I1Hybridoma ATCC® CRL2700) after washing the cells with PBS. The pseudoviruses were harvested 20 h post-inoculation, passed through a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore, Cat#SLHP033RB) before aliquoted and stored at −80°C.
All pseudoviruses were treated with 0.5U/μL BaseMuncher endonuclease (Abcam, ab270049) for 1.5 h at 37°C to remove unpackaged RNA before quantification. Viral RNA was extracted (Bioer Technology, Cat# BYQ6.6.101711-213) and quantified by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) using 7500 fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the primers and probe for detecting the P protein coding sequence of VSV.
The pseudovirus particles of SARS-CoV-2, wild-type RaTG13 and mutated RaTG13 were normalized to the same amount for quantitation by qRT-PCR. Then, 100 μL of each pseudovirus was added to each well of the 96 well plate containing HeLa-hACE2 cells. Untransfected HeLa cells were used as controls. The plates were imaged 15 h post-transfection. The imaging and analysis of fluorescent cells was determined using a CQ1 confocal image cytometer (Yokogawa, Japan). Each group contains 6 replicates.
Neutralization assay was performed as previously described ( Dai et al., 2020 7. Dai, L. ∙ Zheng, T. ∙ Xu, K. ... A universal design of betacoronavirus vaccines against COVID-19, MERS, and SARS Cell. 2020; 182 :722-733.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 50 μL of serially diluted human sera or monoclonal antibody were incubated with 50 μL of pseudoviruses at 37°C for 1 h before being added onto pre-plated HeLa-hACE2 cells. The transducing units (TU) numbers were calculated on a CQ1 confocal image cytometer (Yokogawa).
The sitting-drop method was used to obtain high-resolution RaTG13 RBD/hACE2 complex crystals. In detail, the purified complex proteins were concentrated to 10 mg/mL. Then, 0.8 μL protein was mixed with 0.8 μL reservoir solution. The resulting solution was sealed and equilibrated against 100 μL of the reservoir solution at 18°C. High-resolution RaTG13 RBD/hACE2 complex crystals were grown in 0.1 M succinic acid (pH 7.0), 0.1 M bicine pH 8.5, and 30% v/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550.
Reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol was prepared as anti-freezing buffer for freezing crystals. Crystals were picked up from the groove by using a mini loop and soaked in anti-freezing buffer for a few seconds. Then, crystals were picked up and frozen by soaking in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) BL19U. The dataset was processed with HKL2000 software as previously described ( Otwinowski and Minor, 1997 30. Otwinowski, Z. ∙ Minor, W. [20] Processing of X-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276 :307-326 Crossref Scopus (39107) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of the RaTG13 RBD/hACE2 complex was determined by the molecular replacement method using Phaser ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a previously reported complex structure of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD complex with human ACE2 (PDB: 6LZG ). The atomic models were completed using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 8. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25409) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refined with phenix.refine in Phenix ( Adams et al., 2010 1. Adams, P.D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Bunkóczi, G. ... PHENIX: a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :213-221 Crossref Scopus (18485) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the stereochemical qualities of the final models were assessed using MolProbity . Data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 . All structural figures were generated using Pymol software ( https://pymol.org/2/ ).
K D values for SPR experiments were obtained with BIAcore 8K Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare), using a 1:1 binding model. The values shown are the mean ± SD of three replicates.
All experiments were performed in triplicate; one representative result was shown in Figures 2 , 3 , and 4 .
