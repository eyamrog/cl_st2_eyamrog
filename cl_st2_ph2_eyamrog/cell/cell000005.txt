Title: Progressive Pulmonary Fibrosis Is Caused by Elevated Mechanical Tension on Alveolar Stem Cells


Abstract: Summary

Fibrosis can develop in most organs and causes organ failure. The most common type of lung fibrosis is known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in which fibrosis starts at the lung periphery and then progresses toward the lung center, eventually causing respiratory failure. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and periphery-to-center progression of the disease. Here we discovered that loss of Cdc42 function in alveolar stem cells (AT2 cells) causes periphery-to-center progressive lung fibrosis. We further show that Cdc42 -null AT2 cells in both post-pneumonectomy and untreated aged mice cannot regenerate new alveoli, resulting in sustained exposure of AT2 cells to elevated mechanical tension. We demonstrate that elevated mechanical tension activates a TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells, which drives the periphery-to-center progression of lung fibrosis. Our study establishes a direct mechanistic link between impaired alveolar regeneration, mechanical tension, and progressive lung fibrosis.

Section: Introduction

Fibrosis—the thickening and scarring of connective tissue—is characterized by excessive proliferation of fibroblasts and accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. This disorder, which is commonly observed in many organs, causes disrupted tissue architecture and leads to major impairments in organ function ( Wynn, 2008; Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012 49. Wynn, T.A. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of fibrosis J. Pathol. 2008; 214 :199-210 Crossref Scopus (3510) PubMed Google Scholar 50. Wynn, T.A. ∙ Ramalingam, T.R. Mechanisms of fibrosis: therapeutic translation for fibrotic disease Nat. Med. 2012; 18 :1028-1040 Crossref Scopus (2548) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, fibrosis is a major cause of end-stage organ failure and death in a large variety of chronic diseases ( Mehal et al., 2011 26. Mehal, W.Z. ∙ Iredale, J. ∙ Friedman, S.L. Scraping fibrosis: expressway to the core of fibrosis Nat. Med. 2011; 17 :552-553 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). A common feature of pulmonary fibrosis is excessive proliferation of fibroblasts around the air sacs of the lungs (alveoli) ( Barkauskas and Noble, 2014 3. Barkauskas, C.E. ∙ Noble, P.W. Cellular mechanisms of tissue fibrosis. 7. New insights into the cellular mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2014; 306 :C987-C996 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Extensive studies have established that an increased number of fibroblasts, in combination with their excessive ECM deposition in the lung, ultimately causes alveolar structure destruction, decreased lung compliance, and disrupted gas exchange function ( Gross and Hunninghake, 2001; Rock et al., 2011; Vyalov et al., 1993 11.

The most common type of pulmonary fibrosis is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This disorder eventually affects entire lung lobes, but it begins with microscopic fibrotic changes that occur at the peripheral regions and slowly progress inward, and this fibrosis can ultimately lead to respiratory failure ( King et al., 2011; Plantier et al., 2011 16.

Ectopic respiratory epithelial cell differentiation in bronchiolised distal airspaces in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Thorax. 2011; 66 :651-657 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). IPF is a fatal disease with a median survival time of only 2–4 years from diagnosis ( Steele and Schwartz, 2013 42. Steele, M.P. ∙ Schwartz, D.A. Molecular mechanisms in progressive idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Annu. Rev. Med. 2013; 64 :265-276 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mechanisms and nature of the periphery-to-center progression of IPF are poorly understood, although studies have implicated contributions from dysregulated alveolar type II (AT2) cells ( Nogee et al., 2001; Seibold et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2009 31.

The alveolar epithelia of lungs are composed of a combination of both alveolar type I (AT1) and AT2 cells. AT2 cells are alveolar stem cells and can differentiate into AT1 cells during alveolar homeostasis and post-injury repair ( Barkauskas et al., 2013; Desai et al., 2014 4. Barkauskas, C.E. ∙ Cronce, M.J. ∙ Rackley, C.R. ... Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :3025-3036 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar 7.

AT1 cells are large squamous cells that function as the epithelial component of the air-blood barrier ( Haies et al., 1981 12. Haies, D.M. ∙ Gil, J. ∙ Weibel, E.R. Morphometric study of rat lung cells. I. Numerical and dimensional characteristics of parenchymal cell population Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1981; 123 :533-541 PubMed Google Scholar ). In IPF tissues, dysregulated AT2 cells are typically located adjacent to fibroblastic foci ( Selman and Pardo, 2002 39. Selman, M. ∙ Pardo, A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: an epithelial/fibroblastic cross-talk disorder Respir. Res. 2002; 3 :3 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the gene mutants that affect the functions of AT2 cells are frequently observed in IPF lungs ( Goodwin and Jenkins, 2016; Kropski et al., 2015; Nogee et al., 2001; Seibold et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2009 10.

Genetic defects in surfactant protein A2 are associated with pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2009; 84 :52-59 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, recent advances in identifying the molecular profiles of IPF lungs showed that transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling is activated in AT2 cells of IPF lungs ( Reyfman et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2016 34. Reyfman, P.A. ∙ Walter, J.M. ∙ Joshi, N. ... Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human lung provides insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2019; 199 :1517-1536 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Xu, Y. ∙ Mizuno, T. ∙ Sridharan, A. ... Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies diverse roles of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e90558 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). These multiple lines of evidence collectively demonstrate an obvious pathological effect of AT2 cells in lung fibrosis, but the precise cellular mechanisms underlying dysregulated AT2 physiology in IPF remain to be elucidated.
Here we describe our discovery of a direct functional link between progressive lung fibrosis and elevated mechanical tension caused by impaired alveolar regeneration. Specifically, we show that AT2 cells that lack Cdc42 are not able to differentiate into AT1 cells and, thus, cannot regenerate new alveoli following lung injury. This impaired regenerative capacity causes exposure of AT2 cells to sustained elevated mechanical tension, which activates a TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells of Cdc42 -null mice in a spatial manner, with more AT2 cells at the lung periphery having activated TGF-β signaling. Therefore, the activated TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells promotes lung fibrosis progression in a spatially regulated manner, with thickening commencing in peripheral regions before subsequently proceeding toward the center of the lung.

Section: Results

During AT2 cell differentiating into AT1 cells, AT2 cells undergo dramatic cell shape changes and active organization of the actin cytoskeleton. We have shown that Cdc42, a member of the RhoGTPase family, is essential for polymerization of actin filaments in AT2 cells ( Liu et al., 2016 21. Liu, Z. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ Jiang, K. ... MAPK-Mediated YAP Activation Controls Mechanical-Tension-Induced Pulmonary Alveolar Regeneration Cell Rep. 2016; 16 :1810-1819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate the function of Cdc42 in regulating AT2 cell differentiation, we first analyzed the activity of Cdc42 during differentiation of AT2 cells.
Mouse AT2 cells were cultured on either non-stretched or stretched silicon membranes ( Figure 1 A). By day 3, the shape of AT2 cells cultured on stretched silicon membranes changed significantly compared with the round shape of AT2 cells cultured on non-stretched silicon membranes ( Figure 1 B). By performing immunostaining using an antibody that can specifically recognize guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-CDC42, we found that the expression levels of GTP-CDC42 were significantly increased in stretched AT2 cells ( Figures 1 B and 1C). In addition, the levels of GTP-CDC42 increased significantly in the lysates of lungs on post-lung lobe resection (PNX) days 5 and 7 ( Figure 1 D). Given our previous observation that differentiation of AT2 cells occurs after post-PNX day 5 ( Liu et al., 2016 21. Liu, Z. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ Jiang, K. ... MAPK-Mediated YAP Activation Controls Mechanical-Tension-Induced Pulmonary Alveolar Regeneration Cell Rep. 2016; 16 :1810-1819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that activation of Cdc42 may be required for differentiation of AT2 cells to AT1 cells.
To test this hypothesis, we performed left PNX on Sftpc -CreER; Cdc42 F/+ ; Rosa26 -mTmG (control) and Sftpc -CreER; Cdc42 F/ − ; Rosa26 -mTmG ( Cdc42 -null) mice and collected the lungs of these mice on post-PNX day 21 ( Figure 1 E). By immunostaining, we found that many newly differentiated AT1 cells and newly formed alveoli were observed in control lungs ( Figure 1 F). However, in Cdc42 -null lungs, few AT2 cells differentiated into AT1 cells, and no new alveoli were formed by post-PNX day 21 ( Figures 1 F and S1 A). In addition, we also observed that the average alveolar size in the peripheral region of Cdc42 -null lungs significantly increased compared with this region in control lungs ( Figures 1 F and 1G).
Under homeostatic conditions, AT2 cells slowly self-renew and differentiate into AT1 cells to establish new alveoli. We deleted Cdc42 in AT2 cells when the mice were 2 months old and analyzed the lungs until the mice were 12 months old ( Figure 1 H). In control lungs, we observed formation of many new alveoli ( Figure 1 I). However, in Cdc42 -null lungs, we observed enlarged alveoli lacking new AT1 cell formation ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Taken together, these results indicate that Cdc42 -null AT2 cells are unable to differentiate into AT1 cells and, thus, cannot regenerate new alveoli during either alveolar homeostasis or PNX-induced alveolar regeneration.
To investigate the long-term effect(s) of impaired alveolar regeneration, we observed Cdc42 -null and control mice for a longer period of time after PNX ( Figure 2 A). Surprisingly, we found that some Cdc42 -null mice showed significant weight loss and increased respiration rates on post-PNX day 30. More than 70% of PNX-treated Cdc42 -null mice (n = 33) reached their endpoints by post-PNX day 180 ( Figure 2 B). Moreover, by their endpoints, these Cdc42 -null mice exhibited respiratory function failure, as assessed by both their average arterial oxygen saturation level (SaO 2 ) and their average partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 ) ( Figure 2 C). Additionally, there were significant reductions in both forced vital capacity (FVC) and lung compliance in Cdc42 -null mice at their endpoints compared with PNX-treated control mice ( Figures 2 D and 2E), an intriguing finding given that decreased FVC and decreased lung compliance are known to occur frequently as lungs become fibrotic ( Lynch et al., 2005; Meltzer and Noble, 2008; Noble et al., 2011; Raghu et al., 2011; Richeldi et al., 2017; American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society, 2000 2.

An hydroxyproline assay and H&E staining revealed severe fibrosis in the lungs of post-PNX Cdc42 -null mice at their endpoints ( Figures 2 F–2H). To determine the point when Cdc42 -null mice began to develop lung fibrosis, we analyzed Cdc42 -null lungs at various time points after PNX using H&E staining ( Figure 2 H). The subpleural regions of some Cdc42 -null lungs exhibited signs of tissue thickening by post-PNX day 14. By post-PNX day 21, the subpleural regions of all Cdc42 -null lungs exhibited dense fibrosis. By post-PNX day 45, the dense fibrosis had progressed to the center of most Cdc42 -null lungs. In addition to detecting high levels of collagen I in the dense fibrotic regions ( Figure S1 B), we found that Col1a1 mRNA expression levels increased gradually after PNX ( Figure S1 C).
It has been shown that “honeycombing” in IPF lungs involves epithelial cells expressing Krt5 or Krt14 ( Seibold et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2016 38. Seibold, M.A. ∙ Smith, R.W. ∙ Urbanek, C. ... The idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis honeycomb cyst contains a mucocilary pseudostratified epithelium PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e58658 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar 51.

Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies diverse roles of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e90558 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we did not detect Krt5 + or Krt14 + cells in fibrotic Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figures S1 D and S1E). No significant epithelial cell apoptosis was detected in Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figure S1 F). There was no significant inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs of Cdc42 -null mice on post-PNX day 14 ( Figure S1 G). However, there were more infiltrated inflammatory cells in the dense fibrotic lungs of Cdc42 -null mice at their endpoints ( Figure S1 G).
Aggregates of proliferating myofibroblasts, termed “fibroblastic foci,” are a key histological feature of IPF. It has been shown that myofibroblasts in fibrotic lungs express high levels of beta-type platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRβ) ( Henderson et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2016 13. Henderson, N.C. ∙ Arnold, T.D. ∙ Katamura, Y. ... Targeting of αv integrin identifies a core molecular pathway that regulates fibrosis in several organs Nat. Med. 2013; 19 :1617-1624 Crossref Scopus (681) PubMed Google Scholar 44.

J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2016; 310 :L824-L836 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with previous findings, our immunostaining results showed that the majority of stromal cells in fibrotic regions of Cdc42 -null lungs expressed PDGFRβ, whereas only airway and vessel smooth muscle cells in control lungs or in relative normal regions of Cdc42 -null lungs expressed PDGFRβ ( Figure S1 H). In addition, these PDGFRβ + cells expressed high levels of collagen I ( Figure S1 I).
We further characterized the heterogeneity of PDGFRβ + myofibroblasts using antibodies against multiple stromal cell markers. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) is a marker that labels contractile smooth muscle-like fibroblasts ( Hinz et al., 2001; Shinde et al., 2017 14. Hinz, B. ∙ Celetta, G. ∙ Tomasek, J.J. ...

Basis Dis. 2017; 1863 :298-309 Crossref Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ). Desmin and NG2 are two pericyte marker proteins expressed in some myofibroblasts of fibrotic lungs ( Rock et al., 2011; Hung et al., 2013 15. Hung, C. ∙ Linn, G. ∙ Chow, Y.-H. ... Role of lung pericytes and resident fibroblasts in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2013; 188 :820-830 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Rock, J.R. ∙ Barkauskas, C.E. ∙ Cronce, M.J. ... Multiple stromal populations contribute to pulmonary fibrosis without evidence for epithelial to mesenchymal transition Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :E1475-E1483 Crossref Scopus (795) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that not all PDGFRβ + cells in Cdc42 -null fibrotic lungs expressed α-SMA, Desmin, or NG2 ( Figures S1 J–S1L). We further co-stained the lungs with antibodies against Ki67 as well as these stromal markers. This analysis revealed that all of the fibrotic lungs contained proliferating α-SMA + , Desmin + , and NG2 + cells ( Figures 2 I and 2J), indicating that these stromal cells contribute to the development of lung fibrosis.
We also analyzed the lungs of control and Cdc42 -null mice without PNX treatment and found no significant fibrotic changes before the Cdc42 -null mice were 10 months old ( Figures 2 K–2M). By 12 months of age, Cdc42 -null mice had developed obvious fibrosis in their lung subpleural regions ( Figure 2 M). Such fibrosis progresses toward the lung center as Cdc42 -null mice get older ( Figure 2 M). Collectively, loss of Cdc42 in AT2 cells leads to progressive lung fibrosis in PNX-treated mice and untreated Cdc42 -null mice starting from around 12 months of age.
On post-PNX day 21, we consistently observed clustered AT2 cells in regions adjacent to dense fibrosis of Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figure 3 A). We first characterized the polarity of AT2 cells and the junction connections between AT2 cells with adjacent cells. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that Cdc42 -null AT2 cells still have apical microvilli ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Lamellar bodies, a feature of AT2 cells, are still present in Cdc42 -null AT2 cells ( Figures S2 A and S2B). Control AT2 cells and Cdc42 -null AT2 cells from non-fibrotic regions maintain their connections with adjacent AT1 cells and lipofibroblasts ( Figures S2 A and S2B). The Occludin (Ocln) immunostaining results show that both control and Cdc42 -null AT2 cells maintain tight junctions with adjacent AT1 cells ( Figure S2 C). Together, these results indicate that the polarity of AT2 cells and the junctions of AT2 cells with adjacent cells are not disrupted in Cdc42 -null lungs prior to initiation of fibrosis.
We then analyzed the proliferation of AT2 cells. In agreement with our previous finding ( Liu et al., 2016 21. Liu, Z. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ Jiang, K. ... MAPK-Mediated YAP Activation Controls Mechanical-Tension-Induced Pulmonary Alveolar Regeneration Cell Rep. 2016; 16 :1810-1819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), loss of Cdc42 in AT2 cells reduced the AT2 cell proliferation rate on post-PNX days 5 and 7. However, after post-PNX day 21, we found that Cdc42 -null lungs had ∼4% proliferating AT2 cells, whereas very few proliferating AT2 cells were detected in control lungs ( Figures S2 D and S2E). These observations suggest that increased AT2 cell proliferation contributes to the clustered-AT2 cell phenotype in Cdc42 -null lungs. Seeking to identify contributions of these abnormal AT2 cells to fibrosis progression, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the gene expression profiles of AT2 cells in sham-treated and PNX-treated Cdc42 -null and control lungs ( Figure 3 B).
After filtering, normalization, and removal of potential outliers, a total of 9,911 cells from all samples with sufficiently high gene expression signals were used for subsequent analyses ( Table S1 ). All cells could be partitioned into one big cluster and several small clusters by their expression of known marker genes ( Figure 3 C). The cells in the largest cluster expressed high levels of classic AT2 cell markers ( Figure S3 A; Table S1 ). Cells in the other, much smaller clusters variously expressed markers of other cell types ( Figure S3 B; Table S1 ). By estimating the transcript expression of Cdc42 exon2 in the unit of transcripts per million (TPM), we show that Cdc42 exon 2 is efficiently deleted in AT2 cells of Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figure S3 C).
A t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ( t -SNE)-based plot revealed that AT2 cells from all samples were clustered into two subpopulations, subpopulation I and subpopulation II ( Figure 3 C). Although the distribution of subpopulations I and II AT2 cells did not differ between sham-treated and PNX-treated control lungs ( Figures 3 D and 3E), we found that PNX-treated Cdc42 -null lungs had a 10-fold increase in the number of subpopulation I cells by day 21. We also noticed a 2-fold increase in subpopulation I cells in sham-treated Cdc42 -null lungs. These differences establish that subpopulation I represents a distinct AT2 cell population that is highly enriched in Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figures 3 D and 3E). We compared the expression levels of AT1 and AT2 cell marker genes between two AT2 cell subpopulations. Many AT1 marker genes were either barely expressed or not differentially expressed in subpopulation I and subpopulation II AT2 cells ( Figure S3 D). The expression levels of many AT2 cell marker genes were slightly decreased in subpopulation I AT2 cells ( Figure S3 D).
To investigate whether the subpopulation I AT2 cell signature represents an intermediate state during AT2 cells differentiating into AT1 cells, we also analyzed AT2 cells of control lungs on post-PNX day 7 ( Figures S3 E and S3F). This analysis showed that, on post-PNX day 7, the control lungs had a higher proportion of AT2 cells bearing the subpopulation I AT2 cell signature, suggesting that this signature is associated with alveolar regeneration. We further analyzed the RNA velocity of single cells using the scRNA-seq data obtained from subpopulation I AT2 cells, subpopulation II AT2 cells, and AT1 cells ( Wang et al., 2018 48. Wang, Y. ∙ Tang, Z. ∙ Huang, H. ... Pulmonary alveolar type I cell population consists of two distinct subtypes that differ in cell fate Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2018; 115 :2407-2412 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA velocity analysis indicated that subpopulation I AT2 cells may represent an intermediate cell state between subpopulation II AT2 and AT1 cells ( Figure S3 G).
A hierarchical clustering analysis of the downregulated and upregulated genes revealed obvious differences in the expression profiles of these two AT2 cell subpopulations ( Figure 3 F; Table S2 ). Although we did observe pathway enrichment for the downregulated genes ( Table S3 ), there were significantly enriched pathways among the upregulated genes, which many of these genes involve in cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion ( Figures 3 F, S4 A, and S4B; Table S4 ).
Fibrosis development in Cdc42 -null mice is similar to the characteristic progression of IPF. We therefore compared the upregulated genes in subpopulation I AT2 cells with the upregulated genes in IPF AT2 cells using the scRNA-seq analysis data for AT2 cells of IPF patients ( Reyfman et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2016 34. Reyfman, P.A. ∙ Walter, J.M. ∙ Joshi, N. ... Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human lung provides insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2019; 199 :1517-1536 Crossref Scopus (736) PubMed Google Scholar 51. Xu, Y. ∙ Mizuno, T. ∙ Sridharan, A. ... Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies diverse roles of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e90558 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 G and S4 C). More than two-thirds of the upregulated genes in subpopulation I mouse AT2 cells were also upregulated in human IPF AT2 cells ( Figures 3 G and S4 C; Table S5 ). Many of these commonly upregulated genes control cytoskeleton remodeling, focal adhesion, and ECM-receptor interaction ( Figures 3 H, 3I, S4 D, and S4 E; Tables S5 and S6 ). Interestingly, we also found that the expression levels of surfactant-associated genes and genes that regulate oxidative phosphorylation were modestly reduced in both IPF AT2 cells and subpopulation I AT2 cells ( Figures S3 F and S3G; Xu et al., 2016 51. Xu, Y. ∙ Mizuno, T. ∙ Sridharan, A. ... Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies diverse roles of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e90558 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our scRNA-seq analysis thus revealed that the proportion of (1) subpopulation I AT2 cells in Cdc42 -null lungs is greatly increased after PNX treatment and (2) subpopulation I AT2 cells show activated cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion, similar to what has been observed in AT2 cells of IPF lungs.
The facts that lung fibrosis in Cdc42 -null mice was greatly accelerated by PNX treatment and increased cytoskeleton remodeling in AT2 cells of fibrotic lungs suggest a close link between lung fibrosis and mechanical tension-induced alveolar regeneration. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we measured lung tissue stiffness in vitro , where lungs were not inflated ( Figures 4 A and 4B). We found that the tissue stiffness is not significantly changed in sham-treated Cdc42 -null lungs or Cdc42 -null lungs on post-PNX day 14, when little fibrosis occurred. On post-PNX day 21, we observed that tissue stiffness only significantly increased at the peripheral fibrotic regions of Cdc42 -null lungs, whereas tissue stiffness remained unchanged at the center non-fibrotic region of same Cdc42 -null lungs. This result demonstrates that the tissue stiffness of Cdc42 -null lungs significantly increased only after the appearance of fibrotic lung tissue.
We also measured the vital capacity of control and Cdc42 -null mice in vivo . The vital capacity of control and Cdc42 -null mice significantly decreased immediately after PNX. However, on post-PNX day 1, the vital capacity of both control and Cdc42 -null lungs increased to levels that were not significantly different from the pre-PNX level ( Figure 4 C). No alveolar regeneration had yet occurred on post-PNX day 1. On post-PNX day 14, the vital capacity of control lungs had returned to the pre-PNX level. The vital capacity of Cdc42 -null mice on post-PNX day 14 also returned to a level close to the pre-PNX level, despite little alveolar regeneration occurring in these Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figure 4 C). Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that increased alveolar pressure occurs earlier than lung fibrosis.
We have demonstrated that implantation of a custom-made silicon prosthesis is able to prevent increased mechanical tension in the remaining lung tissue following PNX ( Liu et al., 2016 21. Liu, Z. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ Jiang, K. ... MAPK-Mediated YAP Activation Controls Mechanical-Tension-Induced Pulmonary Alveolar Regeneration Cell Rep. 2016; 16 :1810-1819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore implanted a prosthesis into control and Cdc42 -null mice on post-PNX day 14, when fibrosis started to occur in some Cdc42 -null lungs, and collected lungs for analysis at various time points after PNX ( Figure 4 D).
We first evaluated the alveolar changes in prosthesis-implanted lungs of control and Cdc42 -null mice on post-PNX day 21. Because differentiation of AT2 cells continues after post-PNX day 14 ( Figure S5 A), prosthesis implantation on post-PNX day 14 results in slightly fewer newly formed alveoli in prosthesis-implanted control lungs on post-PNX day 21 ( Figure 4 E). Although no new alveoli were formed in prosthesis-implanted Cdc42 -null lungs, the enlarged alveoli phenotype of Cdc42 -null lungs was greatly rescued by prosthesis implantation ( Figures 4 E and 4F). In addition, prosthesis implantation not only suppressed the increased expression of actin-cytoskeleton regulatory genes ( Figure 4 G) but also greatly rescued the decreased expression of genes in Cdc42 -null AT2 cells ( Figure S5 B). Our results support the conclusion that the increased mechanical tension on the alveolar epithelium of Cdc42 -null lungs is responsible for abnormal gene expression.
We have shown previously that, on post-PNX day 21, ∼4% of proliferating AT2 cells can be detected in Cdc42 -null lungs ( Figure S2 D). Such increased AT2 cell proliferation can be fully blocked by prosthesis implantation ( Figure S5 C), indicating that the increased AT2 cell proliferation is caused by elevated mechanical tension. By post-PNX day 180, none of the prosthesis-implanted Cdc42 -null mice (n = 10) died, whereas 70% of the non-implanted Cdc42 -null mice (n = 19) were dead ( Figure 4 H). When non-implanted Cdc42 -null mice reached their endpoints, the content of hydroxyproline in the lungs of prosthesis-implanted Cdc42 -null mice was significantly lower ( Figure 4 I). H&E staining revealed that little lung fibrosis was evident in prosthesis-implanted Cdc42 -null mice by post-PNX day 180, whereas modest to severe lung fibrosis was observed in all of the surviving non-implanted Cdc42 -null mice ( Figure 4 J). Together, these results demonstrate an essential regulatory role of the mechanical tension in driving lung fibrosis development in Cdc42 -null mice.
We next want to further investigate the signaling pathway that underlies mechanical tension-mediated lung fibrosis. Our scRNA-seq results show that the expression of Tgfb1 was significantly upregulated in subpopulation I AT2 cells ( Figures 3 F and S5 D). We then performed a static stretch on cultured AT2 cells. AFM analysis shows that the average Young’s modulus of stretched AT2 cells is significantly increased ( Figures S5 F and S5G). We demonstrated that application of mechanical tension to AT2 cells can directly increase the expression of Tgfb1 in AT2 cells ( Figures 5 A and 5B).
Inactive TGF-β ligands are secreted by cells and stored in the ECM in association with a latency-associated peptide (LAP). Mechanical tension-induced cell contraction induces a conformation change of the TGF-β-LAP complex and liberates TGF-β ligands ( Maeda et al., 2011 24. Maeda, T. ∙ Sakabe, T. ∙ Sunaga, A. ... Conversion of mechanical force into TGF-β-mediated biochemical signals Curr. Biol. 2011; 21 :933-941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). We measured the levels of free and total TGF-β ligands in mouse AT2 cells using an ELISA kit. Although we did detect much higher concentrations of total TGF-β ligands in cell lysates of stretched AT2 cells, we were unable to detect the presence of free TGF-β ligands in the supernatants of AT2 cells ( Figure 5 C). In the lysates of lung tissues, although we could detect a significantly higher level of total TGF-β ligands in Cdc42 -null lungs on post-PNX day 21, we could not detect free TGF-β ligands ( Figure S5 H). Collectively, these results suggest that TGF-β ligands produced by AT2 cells may amply its function locally both in vitro and in vivo .
Given the well-known function of TGF-β signaling in IPF, we were interested in characterizing the contribution of mechanical tension-induced TGF-β in AT2 cells. We performed immunostaining experiments with a p-SMAD2 antibody. Approximately 90% of stretched mouse or human AT2 cells obviously expressed strong signals for nuclear p-SMAD2, whereas non-stretched AT2 cells did not exhibit nuclear p-SMAD2 signals ( Figures 5 D–5G). In addition, the nuclear p-SMAD2 signals in stretched AT2 cells were completely blocked by a TGF-β-neutralizing antibody, indicating that TGF-β ligands produced by AT2 cells activate TGF-β signaling in stretched AT2 cells ( Figures 5 D–5G). In light of the discovery that integrin alpha-V activates TGF-β signaling via liberating TGF-β stored in the ECM ( Maeda et al., 2011 24. Maeda, T. ∙ Sakabe, T. ∙ Sunaga, A. ... Conversion of mechanical force into TGF-β-mediated biochemical signals Curr. Biol. 2011; 21 :933-941 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), we treated stretched AT2 cells with an integrin alpha-V inhibitor, GSK3008348, and found that GSK3008348 treatment sufficiently blocked nuclear p-SMAD2 signals in stretched mouse and human AT2 cells ( Figures 5 D–5G). Non-stretched Cdc42 AT2 cells did not exhibit nuclear p-SMAD2 signals ( Figures S5 I and S5J). Furthermore, the nuclear p-SMAD2 signals in stretched Cdc42 -null AT2 cells could be completely blocked by an anti-TGF-β antibody or by GSK3008348 ( Figures S5 I and S5J). Neither cell proliferation nor cell apoptosis were detected in stretched AT2 cells ( Figure S5 K). Together, these results establish that TGF-β signaling in both control AT2 cells and Cdc42 -null AT2 cells is activated upon application of mechanical tension.
We next investigated whether mechanical tension regulates the activation of TGF-β signaling in a spatial manner in the lung, given that the sign of fibrosis first appears from the lung periphery. We analyzed the spatial distribution of AT2 cells in wild-type lungs that were inflated to different pressures using paraformaldehyde (PFA) buffer ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Our imaging analysis showed that the distance between adjacent AT2 cells under higher pressure is less uniformly distributed than under lower pressure. In addition, when lungs were inflated, the average distance between adjacent AT2 cells at the lung periphery tended to be larger than that at the lung center. Thus, (1) increasing alveolar pressure enlarges the alveolar size, and (2) the effects of mechanical pressure are not uniformly distributed throughout the alveolar epithelium; alveoli located in the peripheral region are likely more stretched.
We next investigated whether TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells is also activated in a spatial manner. Wild-type mice were ventilated at a peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH 2 O or 30 cmH 2 O for 8 h ( Figure 6 B). Few AT2 cells expressed nuclear p-SMAD2 in mice ventilated at a pressure of 10 cmH 2 O ( Figures 6 C and 6F); however, strong nuclear p-SMAD2 signals were detected in AT2 cells of mice ventilated at 30 cmH 2 O ( Figures 6 D and 6F). Most AT2 cells expressing nuclear p-SMAD2 were located close to the periphery of the lung ( Figure 6 D). We also noticed some p-SMAD2 + cells located adjacent to p-SMAD2 + AT2 cells in lungs ventilated at 30 cmH 2 O. Immunostaining experiments identified that these p-SMAD2 + cells are PDGFRα + fibroblasts rather than AT1 cells ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Nuclear p-SMAD2 signals in the lungs of mice ventilated at 30 cmH 2 O could be significantly blocked by GSK3008348 treatment ( Figures 6 E and 6F). All of these results support the hypothesis that applying mechanical tension to the alveolar epithelium activates TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells in a spatial manner.
We further assessed the activity of TGF-β signaling in the lungs of prosthesis-implanted and non-implanted control and Cdc42 -null mice on post-PNX day 21 ( Figure 6 G). Although few AT2 cells in control lungs expressed nuclear p-SMAD2, approximately 50% of AT2 cells in non-implanted Cdc42 -null lungs expressed nuclear p-SMAD2 ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Interestingly, most of these p-SMAD2 + AT2 cells were located close to the periphery region of Cdc42 -null lungs. Prosthesis implantation completely blocked the expression of nuclear p-SMAD2 in AT2 cells of Cdc42 -null mice ( Figures 6 H and 6I). Further, we found that prosthesis implantation significantly reduced the expression of Tgfb1 in AT2 cells of Cdc42 -null mice ( Figure 6 J). We also observed that many AT2 cells located at the lung periphery region of 12-month-old Cdc42 -null mice expressed nuclear p-SMAD2 ( Figures S6 D and S6E).
We have demonstrated that elevated mechanical tension on the alveolar epithelium activates TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells in a spatially regulated manner. Given the clear evidence that many AT2 cells in IPF lungs expressed nuclear p-SMAD2 ( Figure S6 F), we were interested in the effects of reducing TGF-β signaling in Cdc42 -null AT2 cells. We delivered AAV2/9 viruses expressing either Tgfb1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or scramble shRNA into the lungs of PNX-treated Cdc42 -null mice via the trachea and collected AT2 cells and CD45 − CD31 − EPCAM − stromal cells from Cdc42 -null mice treated with either of the viruses on post-PNX day 21 ( Figures S7 A–S7C). We found that the expression level of Tgfb1 in AT2 cells and the expression levels of Col1a1 and Col1a2 in stromal cells were significantly reduced by Tgfb1 shRNA treatment ( Figures S7 D and S7E), demonstrating that TGF-β in AT2 cells has a key function in fibrosis progression.
Binding of TGF-β ligands to TGFBR2 is essential for activation of TGF-β signaling ( Levéen et al., 2002; Massagué, 2012 20. Levéen, P. ∙ Larsson, J. ∙ Ehinger, M. ... Induced disruption of the transforming growth factor beta type II receptor gene in mice causes a lethal inflammatory disorder that is transplantable Blood. 2002; 100 :560-568 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar 25. Massagué, J. TGFβ signalling in context Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13 :616-630 Crossref Scopus (2464) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated Sftpc- CreER; Tgfbr2 F/F ; Cdc42 F/− ; Rosa26 -mTmG ( Tgfbr2 & Cdc42 -null) mice and observed that nuclear p-SMAD2 expression was no longer evident in AT2 cells of these mice by post-PNX day 21 ( Figures 7 A, S7 F, and S7G). Compared with Cdc42 -null AT2 cells, the expression levels of Tgfb1 were greatly decreased in Tgfbr2 & Cdc42 -null AT2 cells ( Figure 7 B). However, the impaired AT2 cell differentiation observed in Cdc42 -null lungs was not rescued in these double-null lungs ( Figures S7 H and S7I). More than 80% of Tgfbr2 & Cdc42 -null mice were alive by post-PNX day 180, whereas fewer than 40% of Cdc42 -null mice were alive by this time ( Figure 7 C). Moreover, only minimal lung fibrosis was evident in most Tgfbr 2& Cdc42 -null mice, whereas most Cdc42 -null mice reached their endpoints because of severe lung fibrosis ( Figures 7 D and 7E). Together, these results provide compelling evidence that activated TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells is essential for progression of mechanical tension-driven lung fibrosis.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we found that loss of Cdc42 in AT2 cells leads to impaired alveolar regeneration and progressive lung fibrosis following lung injury. The progression of lung fibrosis we observed here is apparently similar to the pathological process that occurs in IPF patients. Loss of alveoli after PNX causes significantly increased mechanical tension on the remaining alveolar epithelium ( Figure 4 C). The subsequent efficient alveolar regeneration reduces the intensity of the mechanical tension to pre-PNX levels. Although the activity of Cdc42 in AT2 cells might differ slightly between a cyclic stretching condition and a static cell-stretching condition, Cdc42 has been shown to be essential for AT2 cell shape change and cytoskeletal remodeling ( Figure S7 J). Cdc42 -null AT2 cells are unable to differentiate into AT1 cells and, thus, cannot regenerate new alveoli; the alveolar epithelium of Cdc42 -null mice continues to experience elevated mechanical tension ( Figure 7 F).
PDGFRα + lipofibroblasts are positioned adjacent to AT2 cells and have been shown to function as the AT2 niche ( Barkauskas et al., 2013 4. Barkauskas, C.E. ∙ Cronce, M.J. ∙ Rackley, C.R. ... Type 2 alveolar cells are stem cells in adult lung J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :3025-3036 Crossref Scopus (1202) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore hypothesize that TGF-β ligands released by stretched AT2 cells can activate TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells and may additionally participate in activating TGF-β signaling in adjacent stromal cells ( Figure 7 F). Moreover, we demonstrate that reducing TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells is sufficient to inhibit fibrosis progression. Thus, our study reveals pathological mechanisms underlying progressive fibrosis. In response to sustained mechanical tension, a constitutively activated TGF-β signaling loop in AT2 cells drives progressive fibrosis in the lungs.
Our observation that Cdc42 -null AT2 cells retain a higher proliferation rate after post-PNX day 21 is in agreement with previous studies reporting higher proliferation of AT2 cells present in IPF lungs. YAP has been shown to regulate AT2 cell proliferation ( Liu et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018; LaCanna et al., 2019 18. LaCanna, R. ∙ Liccardo, D. ∙ Zhang, P. ...

Claudin-18–mediated YAP activity regulates lung stem and progenitor cell homeostasis and tumorigenesis The Journal of clinical investigation. 2018; 128 Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar ). We generated Sftpc -CreER; Yap F/− ; Cdc42 F/− ; Rosa26 -mTmG mice ( Figure S7 K). We found that the survival rate of these Yap&Cdc42 -null mice did not differ from that of Cdc42 -null mice ( Figure S7 L). By the endpoints, all Yap&Cdc42 -null mice developed severe lung fibrosis. We did not observe significant differences in the percentages of AT2 cells expressing nuclear p-SMAD2 ( Figures S7 M and S7N), indicating that deletion of Yap in Cdc42 -null AT2 cells does not significantly affect TGF-β signaling in AT2 cells.
Studies of IPF probands and their families, as well as related genetic studies in mice, have suggested pathological functions of abnormal AT2 cells ( Camelo et al., 2014; Gokey et al., 2018; Kropski et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016 5.

Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies diverse roles of epithelial cells in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis JCI Insight. 2016; 1 :e90558 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, although genetic susceptibility does play a role in the pathogenesis of IPF, other studies have proposed that additional triggering factors experienced later in life may be required for IPF onset, for example, recurrence of micro-injuries ( Albert et al., 2019; Richeldi et al., 2017 1. Albert, R.K. ∙ Smith, B. ∙ Perlman, C.E. ... Is Progression of Pulmonary Fibrosis due to Ventilation-induced Lung Injury? Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Lancet. 2017; 389 :1941-1952 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1244) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here we identified that both AT2 cells of IPF patients and AT2 cells of Cdc42 -null lungs apparently employ common cellular stress response mechanisms ( Figures 3 G–3I and S4 C–S4E). These observations suggest that the early events in the pathogenesis of IPF may relate to defects in the repair of injured alveolar epithelia, in which AT2 cells are unable to differentiate and establish new alveoli. Considering that many IPF patients are cigarette smokers or have had other inhalational exposure that can cause a significant decline in the number of alveoli ( Leslie, 2012; Selman and Pardo, 2006; Taskar and Coultas, 2006 19. Leslie, K.O. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis may be a disease of recurrent, tractional injury to the periphery of the aging lung: a unifying hypothesis regarding etiology and pathogenesis Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 2012; 136 :591-600 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar 40. Selman, M. ∙ Pardo, A.

Taskar, V.S. ∙ Coultas, D.B. Is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis an environmental disease? Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2006; 3 :293-298 Crossref Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is tempting to speculate that a progressive loss of alveoli has already been experienced in such patients prior to IPF disease onset.
IPF is a fatal progressive lung disease with few treatment options. Here we establish a direct mechanistic link between elevated mechanical tension caused by impaired alveolar regeneration and progressive lung fibrosis, illuminating a pathogenic mechanism that may underlie fibrosis more generally. Furthermore, our study suggests that reducing mechanical tension on alveoli is a potential new therapeutic approach to treat progressive lung fibrosis. We anticipate that the insights gained from our experiments with our progressive lung fibrosis mouse model will lead to major breakthroughs to advance future development of treatments for IPF and other fibrotic diseases.

All mice analyzed had mixed genetic backgrounds and were age matched (8–10 weeks old) unless mentioned specifically. All mouse strains were maintained in the NIBS animal facility in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions in accordance with institutional guidelines and ethical regulations. Only male mice were included in the study. All animals used in this study had no previous history of experimentation and were naive at the time of analysis. All experiments were performed following the national guidelines for housing and care of laboratory animals (Ministry of Health, China) and the protocol is in compliance with institutional regulations after review and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing
All experiments with human tissue samples ( Figures 5 and S6 ) were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards at National Institute of Biological Sciences, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and Wuxi People’s Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all human subjects. IPF tissues ( Figure S6 ) were collected from lung explants of IPF patients (n = 4, 3 males and 1 female, age > 60y) undergoing lung transplantation. Control lung tissues ( Figure S6 ) and human AT2 cells ( Figure 5 ) were collected from healthy adult donors (n = 5, 4 males and 1 female, age > 40y) that were resected on the basis of size incompatibility or were deeded unsuitable for lung transplantation. We did not observe sex-dependent effects.
An endotracheal cannula was inserted into the trachea of anesthetized mice before delivering AAV2/9 viruses expressing Cre, Tgfb1 shRNA (CCGCAACAACGCCATCTAT) or scramble shRNA (TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) into mouse lungs (Obio Technology company China, Shanghai). Each mouse was treated with a titer of 1 × 10 11 viral genome copies diluted in warm 50 μL sterile saline. After the treatment, mice were placed on a warm pad until they woke up. 3 days after the AAV2/9 virus delivery, the mice were treated with PNX. Lungs of these mice were collected at post-PNX day 21 for the quantitative RT-PCR analysis.
Mice were injected with 10U/g heparin before they were anesthetized. Total 200 μL blood was collected from the abdominal aorta. The arterial oxygen Level saturation (SaO 2 ) and partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 ) were analyzed using an analyzer (i-STAT).
Sftpc -CreER; Rosa26 -mTmG, Sftpc -CreER; Cdc42 F/+ ; Rosa26 -mTmG or Sftpc -CreER; Cdc42 F/- ; Rosa26 -mTmG mice were exposed to 4 doses of tamoxifen (75mg/kg) prior to collecting GFP-lineage labeled AT2 cells. To remove blood cells in the lung, mice were perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) through their left ventricles. Next, ∼1 mL of enzyme solution,including 5U/ml neutral protease (Worthington-Biochem, LS02111) and 0.33U/ml DNase I (Roche, 10104159001), was infused into the lung via trachea. Lungs filled with the enzyme solution were further soaked in such enzyme solutions for 45 minutes at room temperature. After the enzymatic incubation, the digested lung tissues were gently torn into small pieces and soaked in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. The single cell suspension was obtained after passing cells through a 100 μm cell strainer and then a 40 μm cell strainer. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 minutes to form a pellet. The cell pellet was resuspended in a RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to remove red blood cells. After centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 minutes, cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (DMEM) prior to DAPI staining. GFP + cells were sorted by FACS using the single-cell-select-mode in BD FACS Aria II and III appliances.
For isolating the stromal cells, mouse lungs were inflated with 5U/ml neutral protease (Worthington-Biochem, LS02111), 0.33U/ml DNase I (Roche, 10104159001), 200U/ml collagenase type I (GIBCO, 17100-017), 4U/ml elastase (Worthington, 2294). The stromal cells were selected for EPCAM - CD45 - CD31 - using the single-cell-select-mode in BD FACS Aria II and III appliances.
Human lung tissues were cut into small pieces with a scalpel, then digested by 5U/ml neutral protease (Worthington-Biochem, LS02111), 0.33U/ml DNase I (Roche, 10104159001), 200U/ml collagenase type I (GIBCO, 17100-017), 4U/ml elastase (Worthington, 2294). The single cell suspension was obtained after passing cells through a 100 μm cell strainer and then a 40 μm cell strainer. Then the single cell suspension was sorted for selecting EPCAM + HTII-280 + CD45 - CD31 - cells using the single-cell-select-mode in BD FACS Aria II and III appliances. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Boards at National Institute of Biological Sciences, and China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and Wuxi People’s Hospital.
Primary mouse and human AT2 cells were isolated and sorted by FACS (details are described in previous sections). 1X10 5 AT2 cells were plated on a 1.5X1.5cm 2 silicone membrane (MSI, silicone sheeting, 010”) for 24 hours before performing the stretching treatment. The DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS was used for culturing AT2 cells. The parts of custom-made equibiaxial strain system and the assembly steps of this cell culture system were previously described ( Liu et al., 2016 21. Liu, Z. ∙ Wu, H. ∙ Jiang, K. ... MAPK-Mediated YAP Activation Controls Mechanical-Tension-Induced Pulmonary Alveolar Regeneration Cell Rep. 2016; 16 :1810-1819 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the treatment using either TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody (Biolegend, 521703) or integrin alphaV inhibitor (GSK3008348) (BioChemPartner, 1629249-33-7), 1 μg/ml TGFβ1 neutralizing antibody or 10 μg/ml GSK3008348 was added into the culture medium at the time of performing the stretching treatment.
24 hours after performing a static stretch with a 25% change in surface area, AT2 cells were fixed by 4% PFA and were proceed for the immunostaining experiments. Details of immunostaining experiment are described in the Immunostaining Experiment section.
GTP-CDC42 levels were determined using a CDC42 activation assay biochem kit (cytoskeleton, #BK127) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, the whole lung lobes were grounded in liquid nitrogen and then lysed using the cell lysis buffer that was applied in the kit. The lysates were then added into microplate wells that were applied with the kit. After the reaction, the absorbance at 490nm was measured by a microplate reader (BIO-RAD iMark).
Lungs were inflated with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and were continually fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C for 24 hours. Then the lungs were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek). The H&E staining experiment followed the standard H&E protocol. Briefly, slides were washed by water to remove the OCT. The nuclei were stained by hemotoxylin (Abcam, ab150678) for 2 minutes and the cytoplasm were stained by eosin (Sigma, HT110280) for 3 minutes. Slices were sealed with neutral resin after the dehydration and clearing steps.
Both mouse and human lung tissues were fixed with 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4°C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and embedded in OCT. 20 μm thickness cryosections were used for immunostaining experiments. In brief, after removing the OCT, the lung slices were blocked with 3%BSA/0.1%Triton X-100/PBS for 1 hour, then slides were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C for overnight. The primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti GTP-CDC42 (1:100), chicken anti-GFP (1:500), rabbit anti-Collagen I (1:300), mouse anti-α-SMA (1:300), rabbit anti-NG2 (1:250), mouse anti-Desmin (1:250), rat anti-Ki67 (1:300), rat anti-CD45 (1:300), rabbit anti-Caspase 3 (1:300), rabbit anti-Prospc (1:500), goat anti-Prospc (1:200), rabbit anti-pSMAD2 (1:500), mouse anti-HTII-280 (1:50), hamster anti-Pdpn (1:100). After washing the slides with 0.1%Triton X-100/PBS for 3 times, the slices were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature. All of the Alexa Fluor coupled secondary antibodies were used at 1:500 dilutions. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. The slides were mounted with 50% glycerol.
For the pSMAD2 staining experiment, 1X phosphatase inhibitor (Bimake, B15002) was added in 4% PFA during the tissue fixation process. The tyramide (Perkin Elmer, NEL744001KT) signal amplification method was used for pSMAD2 staining followed the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Mice were first anesthetized and then subjected to cardiac perfusion to remove the blood in the lungs. Then lung lobes were weighted and homogenized. The lung homogenate was hydrolyzed for 3 hours at 120°C using concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, ∼12 M). The hydroxyproline concentration of the hydrolyzed samples was determined by the absorbance at 560nm with a hydroxyproline assay kit (Sigma, MAK008) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The absorbance at 560nm was measured by a microplate reader (BIO-RAD iMark).
A mouse TGFβ1 immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, MB100B) was used to detect activated TGFβ1 and total TGFβ1. Whole lung lobes were ground in liquid nitrogen and then lysed using the cell lysis buffer applied by the kit. For detecting total TGFβ1, cell lysates or tissue lysates were first treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl, ∼12 M) before added into the microplate wells applied with the kit. For detecting activated TGFβ1, cell lysates or tissue lysates were directly added into the microplate wells applied with the kit without the treatment with hydrochloric acid. After the reaction in microplate wells, the absorbance at 450nm was measured by a microplate reader (BIO-RAD iMark).
8 weeks old male mice were injected with tamoxifen (dosage: 75mg/kg) every other day for 4 times. 14 days after the final dose of tamoxifen injection, mice were anesthetized and connected to a ventilator (Kent Scientific, Topo). The chest wall was incised at the fourth intercostal ribs and the left lung lobe was removed. For implanting a prosthesis, a soft silicone prosthesis with a similar size and shape of the left lung lobe was inserted into the empty left lung cavity.
Lung function parameters were measured using an invasive pulmonary function testing system (DSI Buxco, PFT Controller). Mice were first anesthetized first before an endotracheal cannula was inserted into their trachea. The dynamic compliance results were obtained from the Resistance & Compliance Test. The forced vital capacity and vital capacity results were obtained from the Pressure Volume Test.
Total RNA was isolated from either whole lungs or primary AT2 cells using RNA MiniPrep Kits (Zymo Research, R2050). Reverse transcription reactions were performed with a PrimeScript™ II 1st strand cDNA synthesis Kit (Takara, 6210A/B) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. qPCR analysis was performed using a HiScript RT-SuperMix for qPCR kit (Vazyme, R223-01) with a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System. The mRNA levels of target genes were normalized to the Gapdh mRNA level. Primers used for qPCR are listed in Table S7 .
Lungs were gently inflated to full capacity with 2% low-melting agarose. Then lungs were fixed in 4% PFA for overnight at 4°C. 200 μm vibratome sections were sliced using the vibrating microtome (Leica VT100S). Immunostaining experiments were performed using the standard wholemount staining protocol. Z stack images were taken by Leica LSI macro confocal microscope and/or A1-R inverted confocal microscope.
For quantifying the alveolar volume and alveolar surface area, about 10 alveolar regions were randomly picked with a general exclusion of pleura, vessels, obvious alveolar ducts and airways. Z stack images were processed in Imaris (Oxford Instruments) for analyzing the alveolar volume and the alveolar surface area. The imaging processing details were previously described ( https://imaris.oxinst.com/learning/view/article/masking-properties-of-imaris ).
AT2 cells of Cdc42 null mice and Control mice were harvested by FACS and then processed following the 10X genomics protocol. For the data analysis, the scaled expression datasets were clustered using graph-based clustering algorithm (implemented in “seurat” package, v2.3.4) and were presented using tSNE plots. The resolution parameter was set to 0.1 for the proper clustering “granularity.” The differentially expressed genes (included in the heatmap) were identified when their expression levels have more than 1.5 fold differences between two AT2 cell subpopulations.
To compare the mouse single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data with two previous described human IPF AT2 cell scRNA-seq data (database: GSE94555 and GSE122960 ), homologous genes expressed in both human and mouse were selected. After normalizing the data collected from IPF samples and healthy donor samples, the differentially expressed genes between IPF and healthy donor samples were obtained. The differentially expressed genes between IPF and healthy donor samples are compared with the differentially expressed genes between two mouse AT2 cell subpopulations. The commonly upregulated genes in both IPF patients and AT2 subpopulation I were analyzed in a venn diagram using the link ( http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/ ). The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed ( http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp ).
We define the endpoints according to the pre-defined criteria ( National Research Council, 2010; Foltz and Ullman-Cullere, 1999 8. Foltz, C.J. ∙ Ullman-Cullere, M. Guidelines for assessing the health and condition of mice Resource. 1999; 28 :28-32 Google Scholar 29. National Research Council Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals National Academies Press, 2010 Google Scholar ). To monitor the survival of mice, both Control and the Cdc42 null mice were weighed every week after PNX. Once the mice show the presence of labored respiration, the mice were weighted every day and the health condition of mice was closed monitored. Once the weight loss was over 20% of post-PNX body weight, the mice were euthanized.
Mice were first anesthetized and then perfused with a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.4% glutaraldehyde through their left ventricles. Lungs were also inflated with a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.4% glutaraldehyde through their trachea before dissection. Dissected lungs were then fixed in a mixture of 4% PFA and 0.4% glutaraldehyde for 24 hours at 4°C. Lungs were cut into small pieces (about 1 mm 3 ) and soaked in 1% antimony tetraoxide for 1 hour at 4°C. Then the tissues were dehydrated in acetone, and embedded by resin. The embedded resin blocks were cut into ultra-thin sections and further stained using uranium acetate and lead citrate. The TEM pictures were taken by a transmission electron microscopy (FEI, Tecnai spirit G2).
After 4 doses of tamoxifen injection, the Sftpc -CreER; Rosa26 -mTmG mice were first anesthetized before inserting an endotracheal cannula into their trachea, and continuously connected to a ventilator (Kent Scientific, Topo) for eight hours at a pressure of 10cmH 2 O or 30cmH 2 O. For the inhibitor treatment, the mice were injected with single dose of GSK3008348 (1mg/kg mouse body weight) intraperitoneally 24 hours before they were continuously ventilated for 8 hours at a pressure of 30cmH 2 O.
Fresh lung tissues were first cut into 400 μm thickness sections using a vibrating microtome (Leica VT100S). Tissues at different regions of lung lobes were selected for measuring the Young’s modulus. The fibrotic tissues in the lung periphery were selected within 2mm from the edge of lung lobes. The non-fibrotic tissues in the lung were selected from the center of lung lobes. All selected tissue regions are to avoid big airways and big blood vessels. Selected tissue sections were evenly attached to a culture dish. Pre-cooled PBS was then poured into the culture dish until the tissue sections were fully submerged.
The calibration of the atomic force microscopy (AFM) system (NT-MDT) was performed immediately prior to each round of microindentation experiments. The AFM tip with a diameter of 20 μm was used for measuring Young’s modulus in the tissues. The AFM tip with a diameter of 5 μm was used for measuring Young’s modulus in cultured AT2 cells. The values of Young’s modulus were extracted from representative force-displacement curves of each sample.
The position of AT2 cells in the lung was automatically identified by our image analysis algorithm. Briefly, raw images obtained from immunostaining experiments were first smoothed using a Gaussian filter. Then the smoothed images were passed to a segmentation algorithm to automatically mark separated pixel regions (Prospc + ) as AT2 cells. The center of the i -th AT2 cell corresponds to the mass center of each pixel region, which is denoted by P i = ( x i , y i ). Thus we are able to obtain a 2-dimentional point cloud representing the position of AT2 cells.
To estimate the local density of AT2 cells (AT2 cells are represent by dots shown in Figure 6 A), for each P i in the point cloud, we choose a subset G i that contains all the points within the circle centered at P i and with a radius r (r = 100 μm). For each point in the subset G i , we compute d . d is the distance from this point to its nearest point within the subset. The average of d for all the points in the subset G i is denoted by D i . Thus, every point P i is assigned with a local average distance D i (illustrated in color scale, Figure 6 A). The larger D i is, the further apart the adjacent AT2 cells are.
All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. (as indicated in figure legends). The data presented in the figures were collected from multiple independent experiments performed on different days using different mice. Unless otherwise mentioned, most of the data presented in figure panels are based on at least three independent experiments. The inferential statistical significance of differences between sample means was evaluated using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t tests. For animal studies, Kaplan Meier survival curves were analyzed with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
