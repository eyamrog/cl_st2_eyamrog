Title: Neurons Release Serine to Support mRNA Translation in Pancreatic Cancer


Abstract: Summary

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors have a nutrient-poor, desmoplastic, and highly innervated tumor microenvironment. Although neurons can release stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic contribution of peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal innervation using LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor growth. Our data indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical adaptation to support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments.

Section: Introduction

A common symptom of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients is neuropathic pain that can necessitate invasive procedures for palliation. Indeed, a majority of PDAC tumors display perineural invasion, which is associated with poor patient outcomes ( Ceyhan et al., 2009b 10. Ceyhan, G.O. ∙ Demir, I.E. ∙ Rauch, U. ...

Along these lines, genetic analyses of PDAC have revealed frequent mutations in regulators of axon guidance, suggesting a role for neuronal support in tumorigenesis ( Biankin et al., 2012 4. Biankin, A.V. ∙ Waddell, N. ∙ Kassahn, K.S. ..., Australian Pancreatic Cancer Genome Initiative Pancreatic cancer genomes reveal aberrations in axon guidance pathway genes Nature. 2012; 491 :399-405 Crossref Scopus (1676) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, surgical denervation or ablation of nerves with capsaicin increases survival of PDAC-bearing mice ( Renz et al., 2018a 60.

USA. 2016; 113 :3078-3083 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ), thus supporting a pro-oncogenic role for nerves in PDAC. Sensory neurons ( Sinha et al., 2017 68. Sinha, S. ∙ Fu, Y.Y. ∙ Grimont, A. ... PanIN Neuroendocrine Cells Promote Tumorigenesis via Neuronal Cross-talk Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :1868-1879 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and sympathetic nerves have been reported to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, whereas cholinergic nerves ( Renz et al., 2018b 61.

Cholinergic Signaling via Muscarinic Receptors Directly and Indirectly Suppresses Pancreatic Tumorigenesis and Cancer Stemness Cancer Discov. 2018; 8 :1458-1473 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) suppressed growth. To date, the mechanisms have focused on the release of neurotrophic factors or neurotransmitters into the tumor.
Another defining feature of PDAC is an extraordinary metabolic plasticity, which allows them to adapt to nutrient poor environments by upregulating scavenging pathways, such as autophagy ( Perera et al., 2015 59. Perera, R.M. ∙ Stoykova, S. ∙ Nicolay, B.N. ... Transcriptional control of autophagy-lysosome function drives pancreatic cancer metabolism Nature. 2015; 524 :361-365 Crossref Scopus (607) PubMed Google Scholar ) and macropinocytosis ( Commisso et al., 2013 14.

Macropinocytosis of protein is an amino acid supply route in Ras-transformed cells Nature. 2013; 497 :633-637 Crossref Scopus (1231) PubMed Google Scholar ), and utilizing metabolites released from stromal fibroblasts and macrophages ( Auciello et al., 2019 3.

Pancreatic stellate cells support tumour metabolism through autophagic alanine secretion Nature. 2016; 536 :479-483 Crossref Scopus (793) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neurons also are known to release amino acid-derived neurotransmitters, such as glycine (Gly) and D-serine ( Monaghan et al., 1989 51. Monaghan, D.T. ∙ Bridges, R.J. ∙ Cotman, C.W. The excitatory amino acid receptors: their classes, pharmacology, and distinct properties in the function of the central nervous system Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Toxicol. 1999; 39 :431-456 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ), which raises the possibility that neurons can support the metabolic needs of PDAC cells in nutrient-poor environments via their peripheral axons. However, the metabolic contribution of nerves in PDAC tumors has not been explored.
Serine (Ser) is a conditionally essential amino acid (AA) that can be obtained from the microenvironment or produced via the Ser biosynthesis pathway (SBP) from glucose and is the second most abundant AA found in human proteins ( Mauro and Chappell, 2014 49. Mauro, V.P. ∙ Chappell, S.A. A critical analysis of codon optimization in human therapeutics Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20 :604-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ser is also used to generate Gly, which can be used to synthesize proteins or glutathione. It also participates in the production of certain lipids and the folate cycle to generate one-carbon units required for the synthesis of nucleotides and methylation units ( Gantner et al., 2019 26.

Labuschagne, C.F. ∙ van den Broek, N.J. ∙ Mackay, G.M. ...

Yang, M. ∙ Vousden, K.H. Serine and one-carbon metabolism in cancer Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16 :650-662 Crossref Scopus (643) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because Ser is necessary for multiple metabolic pathways, it can become rate-limiting for growth and survival for several types of cancers ( Sullivan et al., 2019 74. Sullivan, M.R. ∙ Mattaini, K.R. ∙ Dennstedt, E.A. ... Increased Serine Synthesis Provides an Advantage for Tumors Arising in Tissues Where Serine Levels Are Limiting Cell Metab. 2019; 29 :1410-1421 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, mouse PDAC cells derived from the genetically engineered KPC ( Kras G12D/+ ; Tp53 flox/+ ; Pdx-Cre ) model can upregulate SBP enzymes and are insensitive to Ser limitation ( Maddocks et al., 2017 47. Maddocks, O.D.K. ∙ Athineos, D. ∙ Cheung, E.C. ... Modulating the therapeutic response of tumours to dietary serine and glycine starvation Nature. 2017; 544 :372-376 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether human PDAC cells also upregulate the SBP or whether there are other mechanisms of obtaining extracellular Ser is not clear.
In this study, we investigated the role of peripheral axons in providing metabolic support to PDAC cells in nutrient-deprived environments. We found a subset of human PDAC cell lines that lacked expression of the SBP enzymes and were dependent on exogenous Ser (exSer) for growth. We demonstrate that axons release AA, such as Ser, and this is able to rescue growth of exSer-dependent PDAC cells in Ser/Gly-deprived conditions. Surprisingly, Ser deprivation specifically decreased the mRNA translation efficiency of two out of six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF). Consistent with these observations, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors from mice on Ser/Gly-free diet were smaller and exhibited increased tumor innervation when Ser is limiting. These data establish a metabolic axis between PDAC and neurons to promote tumor growth under nutrient-poor conditions.

Section: Results

Neurons that innervate tumors are conceptually ideal to supply nutrients to poorly perfused areas in the tumor microenvironment. While the axons may be located in the nutrient-poor tumor, the neuronal cell body has access to high levels of nutrients in the circulation. We assessed whether the axons of sensory nerves could supply nutrients through secretion of metabolites. Rat dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs) were grown in microfluidic devices that isolated axons from the neuronal body ( Figures 1 A–1C; Taylor et al., 2005 75. Taylor, A.M. ∙ Blurton-Jones, M. ∙ Rhee, S.W. ... A microfluidic culture platform for CNS axonal injury, regeneration and transport Nat. Methods. 2005; 2 :599-605 Crossref Scopus (958) PubMed Google Scholar ), simulating the in vivo situation, whereby the tumors are only exposed to the axons. Hydrostatic pressure was established to isolate the nutrient-deprived axonal media from the nutrient-rich neuronal media. Conditioned media collected from the axonal side had increased levels of several AA, including Ser (35% D-Ser and 65% L-Ser) and Gly ( Figures 1 D and 1E). We focused on Ser, because unlike other AA that can be obtained by macropinocytosis, serum albumin does not contribute to the intracellular Ser pools in PDAC ( Davidson et al., 2017 17. Davidson, S.M. ∙ Jonas, O. ∙ Keibler, M.A. ... Direct evidence for cancer-cell-autonomous extracellular protein catabolism in pancreatic tumors Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :235-241 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ser has gained recent attention as critical in supporting growth of several cancer types. Interestingly, the release of Ser and Gly from axons was not action potential-dependent ( Figures 1 F and S1 A), and axons were able to secrete Ser and Gly when cultured in a range of Ser/Gly concentrations ( Figure 1 G). Together, these data indicate that axons can release AA into nutrient-poor environments.
Mouse KPC PDAC cells can upregulate Ser synthesis and are insensitive to Ser/Gly starvation ( Figure S1 B). By contrast, we find that human PDAC cells show heterogeneity in their dependency on exSer with ∼40% of human PDAC cell lines being completely dependent on exSer for proliferation under various nutrient conditions ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S1 C). Furthermore, exSer-dependent PDAC cells exhibit a dose-dependent growth over a range of Ser concentrations ( Figure S1 D) and are incapable of adapting even after long periods of Ser/Gly deprivation ( Figure S1 E). Unlike exSer-independent PDAC cells, exSer-dependent PDAC cells lack the expression and ability to upregulate PHGDH and PSAT1 to convert glucose into Ser ( Figures 2 C–2F, S1 F, and S1G). Ectopic expression of PHGDH and/or PSAT1 was not sufficient to restore growth of exSer-dependent PDAC cells in Ser/Gly-deprived conditions. However, after long-term culture, only exSer-dependent PDAC clones expressing both PHGDH and PSAT1 were able to adapt to the absence of Ser/Gly ( Figures S1 H and S1I). Adapted PHGDH and PSAT1-expressing PDAC cells expressed higher levels of the SBP enzymes and were able to grow in the absence of Ser/Gly ( Figures S1 I and S1J). Together, these data indicate that high expression of SBP enzymes are required to grow in the absence of Ser/Gly. We also found that ∼40% of human PDAC tumors lacked PHGDH ( Figures 2 G and 2H). However, expression of SBP genes were not associated with molecular subtypes in PDAC cell lines or clinical samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas ( The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 76. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1223) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S1 K and S1L; Table S1 ). The inability to express and upregulate sufficient levels of SBP genes was observed to be negatively associated with methylation levels ( Figures S1 M–S1O), suggestive of epigenetic or transcriptional issues in exSer-dependent PDAC cells.
ExSer-dependent PDAC growth in Ser/Gly-deprived media was rescued when co-cultured with axons ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Because axons were found to release both L- and D-Ser, and reported to form synaptic gap junctions with gliomas ( Venkataramani et al., 2019 78. Venkataramani, V. ∙ Tanev, D.I. ∙ Strahle, C. ... Glutamatergic synaptic input to glioma cells drives brain tumour progression Nature. 2019; 573 :532-538 Crossref Scopus (585) PubMed Google Scholar ; Venkatesh et al., 2019 79. Venkatesh, H.S. ∙ Morishita, W. ∙ Geraghty, A.C. ... Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits Nature. 2019; 573 :539-545 Crossref Scopus (662) PubMed Google Scholar ), we wanted to assess these effects on exSer-dependent PDAC cell growth. We found that the D-Ser was not able to restore growth in exSer-dependent PDAC cells under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions ( Figure S2 A). Furthermore, we did not observe gap junctions between axons and PDAC cells ( Figures S2 B and S2C; Abbaci et al., 2008 1. Abbaci, M. ∙ Barberi-Heyob, M. ∙ Blondel, W. ... Advantages and limitations of commonly used methods to assay the molecular permeability of gap junctional intercellular communication Biotechniques. 2008; 45 :33-52, 56–62 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although axons were found to release ∼5 μM of Ser after 24 h, which is not sufficient to support proliferation in monoculture assays, axons likely restore growth by replenishing steady-state levels of Ser that are consumed by exSer-dependent PDAC cells in co-culture assays. Indeed, repeated supplementation of low dose of Ser was able to stimulate growth of exSer-dependent PDAC cells ( Figure S2 D). Together, these observations indicate that neurons are able to release sufficient levels of L-Ser via their axons to metabolically support PDAC cells.
We previously found that human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSCs) can support PDAC growth and metabolism under nutrient limiting conditions by secreting alanine ( Sousa et al., 2016 69. Sousa, C.M. ∙ Biancur, D.E. ∙ Wang, X. ... Pancreatic stellate cells support tumour metabolism through autophagic alanine secretion Nature. 2016; 536 :479-483 Crossref Scopus (793) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because PSCs reside in the same microenvironment as PDAC cells, we used Boyden chambers to assess whether HPSCs can support exSer-dependent PDAC cells in Ser/Gly-deprived conditions. Using a PDAC:HPSC ratio of 1:5 (an overestimation that assumes the whole stroma is HPSCs) ( Seymour et al., 1994 67. Seymour, A.B. ∙ Hruban, R.H. ∙ Redston, M. ... Allelotype of pancreatic adenocarcinoma Cancer Res. 1994; 54 :2761-2764 PubMed Google Scholar ), HPSCs were not able release sufficient levels of Ser to support exSer-dependent PDAC cell growth in Ser/Gly-deprived conditions ( Figures 3 C–3F). This indicates that axons are supplying significantly more Ser than HPSCs to exSer-dependent PDAC cells.
Next, we assessed the role of Ser in PDAC cells. We found that exSer-dependent PDAC growth in Ser/Gly-deprived media was not restored by the addition of exogenous formate or nucleosides ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Only in the presence of high Gly did exogenous formate partially restore growth in some, but not all, exSer-dependent PDAC cells grown in Ser-deprived media ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Partial rescue by Gly and formate was likely due to SHMT1/2-dependent Gly-to-Ser conversion ( Figures S2 H and S2I). In addition, S-adenosyl-methionine:S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAM:SAH) and reduced:oxidized glutathione (GSH:GSSG) ratios were not decreased under Ser/Gly-depleted conditions in exSer-dependent PDAC cells ( Figure S2 J). Although PDAC cells incorporated Ser into GSH/GSSG, SAM/SAH, and purines, the changes of these metabolites upon Ser/Gly deprivation were not significantly decreased between exSer-dependent and -independent PDAC cells ( Figures S2 K–S2M). This is consistent with the observation that exogenous nucleosides and formate (one-carbon units for methylation and nucleotides), and Gly (glutathione synthesis) could not rescue exSer-dependent PDAC cell growth in Ser-deprived conditions. Together, these results indicate that Ser was not limiting for one-carbon metabolism, glutathione, or SAM pathway activity in exSer-dependent PDAC cells.
We noticed that glucose incorporation into citrate was decreased in exSer-dependent, but not exSer-independent, PDAC cells deprived of Ser ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S3 A). ExSer-dependent, but not exSer-independent, PDAC cells also displayed higher NADH/NAD + ratios with Ser/Gly starvation ( Figure 4 C). These data suggested that exSer-dependent PDAC cells decrease mitochondrial activity during Ser limitation. To assess mitochondria activity in PDAC cells, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions and stimulated with different combinations of Ser, Gly, and formate. Injection of Ser/Gly and Ser alone increased OCR within minutes in exSer-dependent PDAC cells. By contrast, injection of Gly, Gly and formate, and formate alone had minimal effect on OCR ( Figures 4 D and S3 B). Interestingly, the higher NADH/NAD + ratios in exSer-dependent PDAC cells upon Ser/Gly deprivation were positively associated with the acute response of OCR upon Ser stimulation ( Figures S3 C and S3D). Furthermore, Ser did not stimulate OCR in permeabilized cells, which directly measures mitochondrial OCR ( Divakaruni et al., 2014 18. Divakaruni, A.S. ∙ Rogers, G.W. ∙ Murphy, A.N. Measuring Mitochondrial Function in Permeabilized Cells Using the Seahorse XF Analyzer or a Clark-Type Oxygen Electrode Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2014; 60 :25.2.1-25.2.16 Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar ), suggesting that Ser-induced increase in OCR was triggering a response in the cytosol in a rapid fashion ( Figures S3 E and S3F).
The rapid stimulation of OCR was suggestive of a signaling mechanism, because transcriptional changes would be too slow. There are two major AA sensing signaling pathways, GCN2-ATF4 and the mTOR pathway ( Chantranupong et al., 2015 11. Chantranupong, L. ∙ Wolfson, R.L. ∙ Sabatini, D.M. Nutrient-sensing mechanisms across evolution Cell. 2015; 161 :67-83 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ; González and Hall, 2017 31. González, A. ∙ Hall, M.N. Nutrient sensing and TOR signaling in yeast and mammals EMBO J. 2017; 36 :397-408 Crossref Scopus (496) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under AA-deprived conditions, mTOR is inactivated and cell proliferation is suppressed. Whereas, AA deprivation increases uncharged tRNAs and activates GCN2, which phosphorylates eIF2α to allow efficient translation of ATF4. ATF4 is a critical transcription factor that upregulates stress-response genes, such as CHOP and HSPA5 (a.k.a. BIP), as well as itself ( Cho et al., 2013 13. Cho, H. ∙ Wu, M. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Signaling dynamics of palmitate-induced ER stress responses mediated by ATF4 in HepG2 cells BMC Syst. Biol. 2013; 7 :9 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dai et al., 2017 15. Dai, F. ∙ Lee, H. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... BAP1 inhibits the ER stress gene regulatory network and modulates metabolic stress response Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :3192-3197 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). There was no difference in mTOR signaling when Ser/Gly-deprived PDAC cells were stimulated with Ser ( Figure S3 G). Similarly, pre-treatment with mTOR inhibitors did not block the Ser-dependent increase in OCR ( Figures S3 H and S3I). Both exSer-independent and -dependent PDAC cells were able to activate the GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 response under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions ( Figure 4 E). However, BIP levels were rapidly decreased under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions in exSer-dependent PDAC cells despite maintaining, or in some cases even increasing, its transcript levels ( Figures 4 E and S3 J). In addition, although both ATF4 transcript and protein increased upon Ser deprivation, its protein levels demonstrated a further increase within minutes of Ser re-stimulation. The time frame indicated that the increase upon Ser stimulation is unlikely at the transcript level ( Figure 4 E) and suggested that Ser stimulation was selectively regulating mRNA translation rates.
Because tRNA charging and protein synthesis are one of the major consumers of ATP ( Buttgereit and Brand, 1995 6. Buttgereit, F. ∙ Brand, M.D. A hierarchy of ATP-consuming processes in mammalian cells Biochem. J. 1995; 312 :163-167 Crossref Scopus (676) PubMed Google Scholar ), we hypothesized that the decreased mitochondrial activity we observed under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions was due to a decrease in ATP demand resulting from decreased protein synthesis rates ( Figure S3 K). Consistent with this, the Ser-induced increase in OCR was completely blocked when exSer-dependent PDAC cells were pre-treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor ( Figure 4 F). In addition, acute CHX treatment increased the NADH/NAD + ratios and decreased OCR in PDAC cells ( Figures 4 G and 4H). Interestingly, axon-derived conditioned media was able to increase OCR in the exSer-dependent PDAC cells grown in the absence of Ser/Gly, albeit at a lower magnitude than full Ser concentrations found in media ( Figure 4 I). Therefore, Ser deprivation selectively reduces mRNA translation rates, which lowers intracellular ATP demand, resulting in decreased mitochondrial activity.
Next, we wanted to elucidate the effects of selective mRNA translation during Ser deprivation. Because there are no obvious changes to the mRNA, protein half-life, mTOR signaling, and GCN2-ATF4 signaling within minutes of Ser stimulation ( Figures 4 E and S3 ), we reasoned that the effects on mRNA translation rates were dependent on ribosomes and/or the coding sequence of genes. Ribosome stalling on codons and rare codon usage have been well-studied as mechanisms that regulate mRNA translation rates during nutrient-deprived conditions in bacteria, but have only recently been identified in eukaryotes ( Darnell et al., 2018 16. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Loayza-Puch et al., 2016 46. Loayza-Puch, F. ∙ Rooijers, K. ∙ Buil, L.C. ... Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading Nature. 2016; 530 :490-494 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). This raised the possibility that differences in Ser codon usage could explain selective protein synthesis rates during Ser/Gly deprivation. To address this question, we constructed several destabilized green fluorescent protein (GFPd2, ∼2 h half-life) ( Li et al., 1998 42. Li, X. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Fang, Y. ... Generation of destabilized green fluorescent protein as a transcription reporter J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :34970-34975 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (672) PubMed Google Scholar ) reporter constructs where all Ser codons were replaced with one of six Ser codons, and the signal was normalized to IRES-mCherry (24 h half-life) as an internal control ( Figure 5 A). Treatment with CHX decreased GFPd2, but not mCherry, fluorescence in Ser/Gly-rich and -deprived conditions ( Figures 5 B and S4 A). Ser/Gly deprivation also decreased GFPd2 fluorescence, with constructs containing TCC and TCT Ser codons displaying the largest drop in fluorescence ( Figures 5 B and 5C) and no changes in expression of the reporters at the RNA level ( Figure S4 B). This was specific to Ser deprivation and not due to a general AA starvation response because depletion of other AA, such as tyrosine or phenylalanine, did not result in the same differences in mRNA TE of Ser codons ( Figure S4 C). These experiments suggest that there is decreased mRNA TE against coding sequences (CDS) containing Ser codons, TCT and TCC, during Ser deprivation.
We performed ribosome profiling ( Ingolia et al., 2012 34. Ingolia, N.T. ∙ Brar, G.A. ∙ Rouskin, S. ... The ribosome profiling strategy for monitoring translation in vivo by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :1534-1550 Crossref Scopus (857) PubMed Google Scholar ) to assess the effects of Ser/Gly deprivation on translation at a global scale in exSer-dependent PDAC cells. Consistent with the GFPd2 reporters, the codon-specific ribosome density during Ser/Gly deprivation was higher on Ser codons in the ribosome protected fragments, but not total mRNA, with TCC and TCT showing the highest density of ribosomes ( Figures 5 D and S4 D). This confirmed that under Ser/Gly deprivation, ribosomal stalling is occurring on TCC and TCT Ser codons. Furthermore, we found that exSer-independent PDAC cells did not exhibit decreased mRNA TE of TCC and TCT Ser codons, under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions ( Figures S4 E and S4F). We postulated that this was because exSer-independent PDAC cells can generate their own Ser when Ser/Gly is limiting because they express PHGDH. Therefore, we treated exSer-independent PDAC cells with a PHGDH inhibitor, which blocks SBP ( Ngo et al., 2020 54. Ngo, B. ∙ Kim, E. ∙ Osorio-Vasquez, V. ... Limited Environmental Serine and Glycine Confer Brain Metastasis Sensitivity to PHGDH Inhibition Cancer Discov. 2020; 10 :1352-1373 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rodriguez et al., 2019 63. Rodriguez, A.E. ∙ Ducker, G.S. ∙ Billingham, L.K. ... Serine Metabolism Supports Macrophage IL-1beta Production Cell Metab. 2019; 29 :1003-1011 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (198) PubMed Google Scholar ). ExSer-independent PDAC cells treated with the PHGDH inhibitor exhibited the same decreased mRNA TE against TCC and TCT Ser codons under Ser/Gly-depleted conditions ( Figures S4 E and S4F). Similar effects were observed in breast cancer (MDA-MB-231, PHGDH low) and melanoma (SKMEL5, PHGDH high) cells, indicating that changes in mRNA TE of Ser codons occurs in multiple tumor types and is not specific to PDAC ( Figures S4 E, S4G, and S4H).
To understand when differences in Ser codon usage were occurring, we monitored GFPd2 fluorescence, BIP levels, and eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α), as an indirect measure of uncharged tRNAs under a wide-range of Ser concentrations ( Figures S5 A–S5D). We observed that GFPd2 and BIP levels exhibit the same initial decay in signal as Ser concentrations decreases, whereas p-eIF2α sharply increases at ∼25–50 μM. Interestingly, we noticed that GFPd2 fluorescence diverges among the Ser codon optimized variants at ∼50 μM. This indicates that the initial decrease in BIP and GFPd2 fluorescence is due to inhibition of general protein synthesis, and that differences in mRNA TE of Ser codons occurs when there are uncharged tRNAs. Furthermore, there was no association between the Ser codons and cognate tRNA gene copy number or expected usage frequency ( Figures S5 E–S5G), suggesting that differences in mRNA TE of Ser codons is not regulated by these factors. Together, these data suggest that there may be differences in the abundance or charging state of Ser tRNA that drives differences in mRNA TE of Ser codons when Ser/Gly becomes limiting.
We assessed the levels of Ser-tRNA and Ser-tRNA charging by charged DM-tRNA-seq in exSer-dependent PDAC cells grown with and without Ser/Gly ( Evans et al., 2017 24. Evans, M.E. ∙ Clark, W.C. ∙ Zheng, G. ... Determination of tRNA aminoacylation levels by high-throughput sequencing Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :e133 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). There are four types of Ser-tRNA isodecoders (i.e., tRNA genes that have the same anti-codon) that contain AGA, CGA, GCT, or TGA anti-codon sequences and recognize the six Ser codons during mRNA translation. Because Ser-tRNA(AGA) is modified at position A34 to I34, it can recognize both TCC and TCT Ser codons. As expected, Ser deprivation decreased tRNA charging of all Ser-tRNA isodecoders ( Figure 5 E). However, the percentage of Ser-tRNA(AGA) charging was not significantly different to the other Ser-tRNAs. Instead, we found that relative to the other Ser-tRNA isodecoders, the levels of total (uncharged + charged) Ser-tRNA(AGA) were significantly decreased upon Ser/Gly deprivation ( Figure S5 H). The difference was still apparent even when factoring the percentage of charged tRNAs to calculate the total levels of charged Ser-tRNAs ( Figure 5 F). We found a strong negative association between the changes in levels of total (uncharged + charged) or charged Ser-tRNA abundance and the ribosome density in the absence of Ser/Gly ( Figures 5 G, S5 I, and S5J). Together, these data indicate that the decreased levels of Ser-tRNA(AGA) could explain the decreased mRNA TE of TCC and TCT Ser codons in exSer-dependent PDAC under Ser-deprived conditions.
Next, we identified genes that would be most and least affected by differences in mRNA TE of Ser codons. We calculated the Ser usage bias (as indicated by Z score) of Ser codons TCT and TCC for 18,660 CDS ( Figure S5 K; Table S2 ). CDS containing high TCT and TCC Ser codons were enriched in canonical pathways related to developmental biology and GPCR signaling ( Figure 5 H). Consistent with these results, BIP was among the top 5% of CDS predicted to have decreased mRNA TE due to Ser codon usage bias. In addition, a majority of the genes predicted to be most affected by slower TCC and TCT mRNA translation rates have decreased protein levels in the absence of Ser/Gly ( Figure S5 L; Table S3 ). In contrast, proteins such as RAS, which are not predicted to be affected by Ser codon usage bias, were not changed during Ser/Gly deprivation ( Figures S5 L–S5N). CDS that are least likely to be affected by Ser codon usage bias were enriched in canonical pathways related to transcription and secreted soluble factors ( Figure 5 I). Among the list of secreted factors, NGF was predicted to be the least affected by Ser codon usage bias during Ser/Gly starvation. Indeed, Ser/Gly deprivation increased secreted NGF levels by exSer-dependent PDAC cells ( Figure 5 J). exSer-independent PDAC also exhibited NGF secretion in the absence of Ser/Gly, but at significantly lower levels than exSer-dependent PDAC cells ( Figures 5 K and S5 O). Because NGF is a reported ATF4 target gene, its transcript was also increased upon Ser/Gly deprivation ( Figure S5 P). To decouple transcription from translation, we ectopically expressed wild-type (84% non-stalled Ser codons), TCC (stalled) codon-, and TCA (non-stalled) codon-optimized NGF. We found that TCC-optimized NGF secretion rate was decreased compared to wild-type and TCA-optimized NGF in Ser/Gly-depleted media, but not Ser/Gly-rich media ( Figure S5 Q). This is consistent with the notion that NGF translation is minimally affected by differences in mRNA TE of Ser codons during Ser-deprived conditions and also shows how PDAC cells can stimulate tumor innervation during Ser/Gly starvation by ensuring the effective translation of the upregulated transcript.
To determine whether Ser/Gly deprivation could affect exSer-dependent PDAC cells in vivo , exSer-dependent PDAC cells were orthotopically injected into the pancreata of nude mice that were placed on a complete AA and Ser/Gly-free (−SG) diet ( Figure 6 A; Table S4 ). Plasma Ser and Gly in mice on the −SG diet were lower than that of mice on AA diet for the majority of the experiment ( Figure S6 A). However, at the end of 5 weeks, plasma Ser and multiple other AA dropped in the tumor-bearing mice fed the AA diet compared to non-tumor bearing mice, suggesting that tumors can exert systemic metabolic changes on AA plasma levels ( Figure S6 B). This may be reflective of cachexia that is often observed in PDAC patients. Importantly, Ser/Gly-deprived tumors were significantly smaller compared to controls, indicating that Ser/Gly availability affects tumor growth ( Figure 6 B). Tumors from mice on −SG diet had lower p-histone 3 and no change in cleaved caspase 3, indicating that tumor weight difference was due to decreased proliferation ( Figures 6 C and S6 C). We also observed increased tumor innervation by sympathetic (tyrosine hydroxylase [Th] + ) and sensory (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 [Trpv1] + ), but not parasympathetic (vesicular acetylcholine transporter [VAchT] + ), nerves in mice on −SG diet compared to controls by IHC and 3D-imaging ( Figures 4 D, 4E, and S6 D–S6H). These differences in innervation could be explained by changes in the levels of axon guidance cues that repel (e.g., SEMA3A) or attract (e.g., SEMA7A) nerves upon Ser/Gly deprivation ( Figure S6 I; Koncina et al., 2007 38. Koncina, E. ∙ Roth, L. ∙ Gonthier, B. ... Role of semaphorins during axon growth and guidance Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 621 :50-64 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pasterkamp et al., 2003 56. Pasterkamp, R.J. ∙ Peschon, J.J. ∙ Spriggs, M.K. ... Semaphorin 7A promotes axon outgrowth through integrins and MAPKs Nature. 2003; 424 :398-405 Crossref Scopus (441) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, the observation is consistent with the fact that ∼90% of human PDAC display neural alterations, and NGF can recruit sensory and sympathetic nerves ( Aloe et al., 2012 2. Aloe, L. ∙ Rocco, M.L. ∙ Bianchi, P. ... Nerve growth factor: from the early discoveries to the potential clinical use J. Transl. Med. 2012; 10 :239 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ceyhan et al., 2009a 9. Ceyhan, G.O. ∙ Bergmann, F. ∙ Kadihasanoglu, M. ... Pancreatic neuropathy and neuropathic pain–a comprehensive pathomorphological study of 546 cases Gastroenterology. 2009; 136 :177-186 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because axons were found to secrete Ser, and PDAC cells can secrete NGF during Ser starvation, we hypothesized that nerves were recruited to metabolically support tumors when Ser levels are low.
To assess whether nerves can support tumor survival or growth during Ser deprivation, we treated mice on control and −SG diet with a Food and Drug Administration-approved TRK (the receptor for NGF) inhibitor, LOXO-101, after orthotopic injection of PDAC cells to reduce tumor innervation ( Ghilardi et al., 2010 30. Ghilardi, J.R. ∙ Freeman, K.T. ∙ Jimenez-Andrade, J.M. ... Administration of a tropomyosin receptor kinase inhibitor attenuates sarcoma-induced nerve sprouting, neuroma formation and bone cancer pain Mol. Pain. 2010; 6 :87 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 F). LOXO-101 had no effect on PDAC growth or on the ability of axons to release Ser from rat DRG neurons in vitro ( Figures S7 A and S7B). Furthermore, TRK levels were not detectable in exSer-dependent PDAC cells or tumors under Ser/Gly-rich and -deprived conditions with or without LOXO-101, indicating that any observable effects would be non-cell autonomous ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Plasma Ser and Gly were not affected by LOXO-101 treatment ( Figure S7 E), and there was no effect on tumor burden by LOXO-101 treatment alone. However, tumor weight, proliferation, and neuronal innervation were further decreased when mice on −SG diet were treated with LOXO-101 ( Figures 6 G–6I, S7 F, and S7G). In addition to the significant decrease in proliferation, LOXO-101 caused a small, but significant, increase in cell death compared to control tumors ( Figure S7 F and S7G). Tumors from mice on −SG diet and LOXO-101 treatment exhibited higher stress levels than control tumors as determined by p-eIF2α staining, which is likely related to decreased tRNA charging caused by Ser deprivation experienced in the tumor ( Figures 7 A and S7 G). Interestingly, p-eIF2α staining was higher at distances furthest from nerves in mice on −SG diets ( Figures 7 B–7D), indicating that there is less nutrient stress surrounding the nerves. In addition, tumors from mice on −SG diet and LOXO-101-treated had significantly lower levels of BIP and higher NGF expression ( Figures 7 E–7G). Together, these results indicate that Trk inhibition is acting in a cell non-autonomous manner by blocking tumor innervation that metabolically supports PDAC cells under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions.
Next, we assessed whether patients with PHGDH high and low PDAC tumors exhibit similar effects on innervation and signaling. PDAC patients with high expression or levels of PHGDH have a significantly lower overall survival ( Figures 7 H and S7 H). This suggests that the PDAC microenvironment does not contain sufficient levels of extracellular Ser to allow maximal tumor growth in patients. In addition, patients with high PHGDH-expressing tumors are more poorly differentiated and have larger tumors ( Figures S7 I and S7J). Furthermore, human PDAC tumors with high PHGDH levels had low levels of nerves, as determined by PGP9.5 staining, whereas, tumors with high PGP9.5 staining had low levels of PHGDH staining ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Similarly, PDAC tumors with high PHGDH expression had low expression of NGF and vice versa ( Figure 7 K). These observations are consistent with Ser being limiting in the PDAC microenvironment, and Ser deprivation is associated with increased tumor innervation.

Section: Discussion

Our results identify a previously undescribed role for neurons, via their peripheral axons, to metabolically support PDAC cell growth under nutrient limiting conditions ( Figure 7 L). Multiple studies have found that neurons lack Phgdh ( Furuya et al., 2000 25. Furuya, S. ∙ Tabata, T. ∙ Mitoma, J. ... L-serine and glycine serve as major astroglia-derived trophic factors for cerebellar Purkinje neurons Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97 :11528-11533 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamasaki et al., 2001 81. Yamasaki, M. ∙ Yamada, K. ∙ Furuya, S. ... 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for l-serine biosynthesis, is preferentially expressed in the radial glia/astrocyte lineage and olfactory ensheathing glia in the mouse brain J. Neurosci. 2001; 21 :7691-7704 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and therefore have to obtain Ser from external sources, such as supporting glial cells ( Ehmsen et al., 2013 19. Ehmsen, J.T. ∙ Ma, T.M. ∙ Sason, H. ... D-serine in glia and neurons derives from 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase J. Neurosci. 2013; 33 :12464-12469 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamasaki et al., 2001 81.

Cytol. 2003; 66 :429-436 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ) and/or the circulation. Because sensory and sympathetic neuronal bodies reside in the DRG, spinal cord, and sympathetic ganglia, and axons travel alongside blood vessels ( Mukouyama et al., 2002 52. Mukouyama, Y.S. ∙ Shin, D. ∙ Britsch, S. ... Sensory nerves determine the pattern of arterial differentiation and blood vessel branching in the skin Cell. 2002; 109 :693-705 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (571) PubMed Google Scholar ), peripheral neurons are exposed to plasma concentrations of AA ( Jimenez-Andrade et al., 2008 36. Jimenez-Andrade, J.M. ∙ Herrera, M.B. ∙ Ghilardi, J.R. ... Vascularization of the dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerve of the mouse: implications for chemical-induced peripheral sensory neuropathies Mol. Pain. 2008; 4 :10 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data demonstrate that innervation may provide another mechanism to supply AA from nutrient-rich plasma to nutrient-poor environments in PDAC tumors ( Figure 7 L). Although cells can adapt to nutrient deprivation by upregulating transcription and cap-independent translation of stress response genes ( González and Hall, 2017 31. González, A. ∙ Hall, M.N. Nutrient sensing and TOR signaling in yeast and mammals EMBO J. 2017; 36 :397-408 Crossref Scopus (496) PubMed Google Scholar ), ribosomal stalling can still occur when essential AA are severely limiting. Under Ser-deprived conditions, exSer-dependent PDAC cells appear to allow the translation of TCC- and TCT-poor transcripts, such as NGF, to adapt to stress and allow the recruitment of nerves. In turn, this would establish a neuro-cancer crosstalk to metabolically support PDAC cells in nutrient-deprived environments ( Figure 7 L).
We found that a large fraction of human PDAC cells lack SBP enzymes and cannot generate Ser. Although PDAC cells exhibit enhanced autophagy and macropinocytosis, these pathways do not appear to generate sufficient levels of Ser to promote growth in PDAC cells under Ser/Gly deprivation. Therefore, PDAC cells must import exSer or increase SBP. Upregulation of SBP enzymes in mouse KPC cells is driven by Kras ( Maddocks et al., 2017 47. Maddocks, O.D.K. ∙ Athineos, D. ∙ Cheung, E.C. ... Modulating the therapeutic response of tumours to dietary serine and glycine starvation Nature. 2017; 544 :372-376 Crossref Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the overwhelming majority of the human exSer-dependent PDAC cells used in this study also harbor KRAS mutations, which indicates that there are additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations that inactivate the SBP in many human PDAC tumors. It also is unclear as to why PDAC tumors would lose their ability to synthesize Ser. It is possible that (1) another driver mutation is suppressing the transcription of PHGDH and/or PSAT1, (2) that Ser biosynthesis is energy expensive, or (3) the pathway may generate toxic metabolic intermediates. Elucidating the answer to these questions will be important for understanding tumorigenesis of PDAC and other malignancies.
PDAC cells often adapt to the nutrients in their environment by rewiring their metabolism. exSer-dependent PDAC cells do not have observable defects in Ser-dependent metabolites, such as one carbon units, glutathione, and nucleotide levels. Instead, we found that Ser is required for efficient mRNA translation of TCC and TCT codons and remains a bottleneck for PDAC tumor growth. Ser codon TE in bacteria and yeast relies on tRNA abundance and rare codon usage, such as AGT and AGC, in Ser-deprived media ( Subramaniam et al., 2013a 70. Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ Deloughery, A. ∙ Bradshaw, N. ... A serine sensor for multicellularity in a bacterium eLife. 2013; 2 :e01501 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar , 2013b 71. Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ Pan, T. ∙ Cluzel, P. Environmental perturbations lift the degeneracy of the genetic code to regulate protein levels in bacteria Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :2419-2424 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to work with arginine limitation in eukaryotes, we did not find an association of tRNA copy number or the calculated codon usage frequency with ribosome stalling upon Ser/Gly limitation in PDAC.
Ribosomal stalling has been observed to occur in many different scenarios. For example, proline limitation was identified in kidney and breast tumors using ribosomal profiling ( Loayza-Puch et al., 2016 46. Loayza-Puch, F. ∙ Rooijers, K. ∙ Buil, L.C. ... Tumour-specific proline vulnerability uncovered by differential ribosome codon reading Nature. 2016; 530 :490-494 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). Arginine limitation also resulted in ribosomal stalling in mammalian cells ( Darnell et al., 2018 16. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, ribosome stalling on Ser codons has not been observed in eukaryotic cells, most likely because many cells in these studies can biosynthesize their own Ser. Consistent with this, we found that SBP can prevent differences in Ser codon TE from occurring during Ser/Gly-limiting conditions ( Figures S4 F–S4H). Ribosomal stalling caused by arginine and proline deprivation is associated with a respective decrease in the percentage of charged tRNAs. By contrast, we found decreased levels of Ser-tRNA(AGA) in the absence of Ser, which can result in lower mRNA TE of TCC and TCT Ser codons. The cause of the selective decrease in Ser-tRNA(AGA) under Ser/Gly deprivation remains to be elucidated.
The unique and complex microenvironment and metabolic plasticity of PDAC tumors have contributed to the poor outcomes of patients. By limiting Ser/Gly availability, through dietary manipulation, we can impair PDAC growth in exSer-dependent tumors in mice. However, PDAC cancer cells in patients may experience more severe nutrient-deprivation than in mouse PDAC tumor models. Whereas orthotopic PDAC models can display desmoplasia, the levels in human PDAC tumors are often greater, leading to the collapse of blood vessels and limitation of the nutrient supply ( Chauhan et al., 2013 12. Chauhan, V.P. ∙ Martin, J.D. ∙ Liu, H. ... Angiotensin inhibition enhances drug delivery and potentiates chemotherapy by decompressing tumour blood vessels Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 :2516 Crossref Scopus (741) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, Ser concentrations in human PDAC tumors have been shown to be ∼60% less than in benign adjacent tissues ( Kamphorst et al., 2015 37. Kamphorst, J.J. ∙ Nofal, M. ∙ Commisso, C. ... Human pancreatic cancer tumors are nutrient poor and tumor cells actively scavenge extracellular protein Cancer Res. 2015; 75 :544-553 Crossref Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because these differences were measured in bulk tumors, it would not be surprising if there were local regions of even more severe nutrient deprivation in PDAC tumors. Taken together, Ser limitation, either by dietary restriction and/or SBP or uptake inhibitors, may be able to slow PDAC tumor growth in patients. However, in response, PDAC cells may alter the tumor microenvironment to obtain Ser, such as recruiting nerves.
Although it has been shown that nerves can affect PDAC growth by releasing neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters ( Renz et al., 2018a 60. Renz, B.W. ∙ Takahashi, R. ∙ Tanaka, T. ... beta2 Adrenergic-Neurotrophin Feedforward Loop Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Cell. 2018; 33 :75-90 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sinha et al., 2017 68. Sinha, S. ∙ Fu, Y.Y. ∙ Grimont, A. ... PanIN Neuroendocrine Cells Promote Tumorigenesis via Neuronal Cross-talk Cancer Res. 2017; 77 :1868-1879 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), our data reveal that nerves also can supply AA, such as Ser, to nutrient-deprived areas of PDAC tumors to promote growth. PDAC patients that have undergone denervation ( Lillemoe et al., 1993 45. Lillemoe, K.D. ∙ Cameron, J.L. ∙ Kaufman, H.S. ... Chemical splanchnicectomy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. A prospective randomized trial Ann. Surg. 1993; 217 :447-455 Crossref Scopus (526) PubMed Google Scholar ) or received β-blockers ( Renz et al., 2018a 60. Renz, B.W. ∙ Takahashi, R. ∙ Tanaka, T. ... beta2 Adrenergic-Neurotrophin Feedforward Loop Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Cell. 2018; 33 :75-90 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ), which can impair nerve innervation, have been documented to have better overall survival. Similar observations were found in animal studies ( Saloman et al., 2016 64. Saloman, J.L. ∙ Albers, K.M. ∙ Li, D. ... Ablation of sensory neurons in a genetic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma slows initiation and progression of cancer Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :3078-3083 Crossref Scopus (234) PubMed Google Scholar ), and anti-NGF therapy also decreases neurogenic inflammation, perineural invasion, and metastasis in the immune-competent KPC PDAC mouse model ( Saloman et al., 2018 65. Saloman, J.L. ∙ Singhi, A.D. ∙ Hartman, D.J. ... Systemic Depletion of Nerve Growth Factor Inhibits Disease Progression in a Genetically Engineered Model of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Pancreas. 2018; 47 :856-863 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that PDAC growth can be further impaired by targeting the recruitment of neuronal axons in response to low Ser conditions with TRK inhibition. Further studies will be needed to elucidate whether other cell types in the PDAC microenvironment, such as macrophages and stellate cells, which have been reported to secrete NGF, also can contribute to neuronal innervation of the tumor under nutrient-deprived conditions ( Caroleo et al., 2001 7. Caroleo, M.C. ∙ Costa, N. ∙ Bracci-Laudiero, L. ... Human monocyte/macrophages activate by exposure to LPS overexpress NGF and NGF receptors J. Neuroimmunol. 2001; 113 :193-201 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (121) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jiang et al., 2020 35. Jiang, J. ∙ Bai, J. ∙ Qin, T. ... NGF from pancreatic stellate cells induces pancreatic cancer proliferation and invasion by PI3K/AKT/GSK signal pathway J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2020; 24 :5901-5910 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we did not observe TRK expression in exSer-dependent PDAC cells, NGF was reported to stimulate proliferation in mouse PDAC cells that express Trk ( Renz et al., 2018a 60. Renz, B.W. ∙ Takahashi, R. ∙ Tanaka, T. ... beta2 Adrenergic-Neurotrophin Feedforward Loop Promotes Pancreatic Cancer Cancer Cell. 2018; 33 :75-90 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is likely due to heterogeneity across PDAC, and in some circumstances it may act in a cell autonomous fashion and in the situation of exSer-dependent PDAC, acts non-autonomously. Together, these observations suggest that targeting nerves and Trk signaling in PDAC patients could decrease tumor recurrence by limiting both the supply of neurotrophic factors and nutrients to tumors. Because TRK inhibitors are approved in the treatment of cancers with TRK alterations, it is tempting to speculate that they could be used in combination with or without Ser restriction following surgery in certain PDAC patients. Our findings highlight the importance of Ser availability, axon-cancer metabolic crosstalk, and selective mRNA translation in PDAC cells and offers potential therapeutic options in the treatment of this disease.

Pancreatic cancer, MDA-MB-231, and SKMEL5 cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collections and Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ). No lines used in this study are found in the ICLAC or NCBI Biosample databases of commonly misidentified cell lines. Cultures were routinely verified to be negative for mycoplasma by PCR. Cell lines were authenticated by periodic fingerprinting and visual inspection, and low passage cultures were carefully maintained in a central lab cell bank ( Uphoff and Drexler, 2011 77. Uphoff, C.C. ∙ Drexler, H.G. Detecting mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures by polymerase chain reaction Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 731 :93-103 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). PATU-8902 cells were infected with lentivirus-expressing PHGDH and/or PSAT1, and selected with puromycin (2 μg/mL) and/or blasticidin (10 μg/mL), respectively. PATU-8902 ectopically expressing PHGDH and PSAT1 were adapted in the absence of Ser/Gly for 21 days. All pancreas cancer cells were maintained in DMEM+10%FBS. All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . See Key Resources Table for complete list of cell lines
Primary rat dorsal root ganglia (rat DRGs, Lonza) cells were grown in 150μm AXIS axon isolation device (Millipore, AX15010) as described ( Taylor et al., 2005 75. Taylor, A.M. ∙ Blurton-Jones, M. ∙ Rhee, S.W. ... A microfluidic culture platform for CNS axonal injury, regeneration and transport Nat. Methods. 2005; 2 :599-605 Crossref Scopus (958) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, AXIS devices were coated with 0.5mg/mL poly-D-lysine and 0.02mg/mL laminin. Approximately 50,000 rat DRGs were seeded into one of the channels in the AXIS device (neuron side) with Neurobasal A media supplemented with B27, glutamine, uridine, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (5-FU), and NGF. Media on the neuronal and axon side was changed after 24 hours with media without or with NGF, respectively to stimulate axon growth through the grooves and into the axon side. Hydrostatic pressure was established to prevent NGF from the axon side from moving to the neuronal side. Approximately 6-10 days after initial seeding, ∼400 peripheral nerves should be established on the axonal side ( Figures 1 A-1C). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 .
Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue microarrays (TMAs) were obtained from M.D. Anderson (IRB protocol: LAB05-0854). The human PDAC TMA contained 138 normal and PDAC matched samples, from 77 male and 61 female patients, and belonged to the age groups of < 60 (n = 42 ), 60-70 (n = 55 ), and > 70 (n = 41 ) years old. Predetermined sample size calculations were not made because TMAs were generated previously as part of the human PDAC tissue array.
All animal studies were approved by the NYULMC IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol #IA16-00507 and IA16-01862). Mice used in this study were 7-8 weeks old, and not involved in previous procedures.
Female immunocompromised athymic nude mice (CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu) were randomly placed on complete amino acid (TD.01084, ENVIGO) or Ser/Gly-free (TD.180296, ENVIGO) diets for two weeks before orthotopic injection of tumor cells into the pancreas. Composition of diets can be found in Table S4 . Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine (120mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg) before surgery. PATU-8902 (1 × 10 4 ) cells were suspended in 20 uL of 50% growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Science), and injected into the pancreas. Mice were treated with buprenex every 12 hours after surgery for 48 hours. For LOXO-101 treatment, mice were given 100mg/kg/day of LOXO-101 sulfate (InVivoChem) by oral gavage for four weeks after one week post-injection. LOXO-101 was resuspended in Labrafac PG (GATTEFOSSÉ). Based on our laboratory’s prior experience, 10 mice per condition in each experiment was chosen to ensure adequate power to detect a two-fold change in tumor size. All mice were housed in a temperature controlled ABSL-2 facility with 12 hour day-night light cycles. Mice were cared for by the husbandry staff at NYULH DCM (division of comparative medicine), and diet and water were provided ad libitum .
Oligomycin A, FCCP (trifluorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone), rotenone and antimycin A were purchased from Cayman Chemicals. Cyclohexamide, Torin1, rapamycin, formate and nucleosides were purchased from Sigma-Millipore. 13 C 6 -glucose, 13 C 3 -serine and labeled amino acid internal standards were purchased from Cambridge isotopes. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific. LOXO-101 sulfate (Larotrectinib) was purchased from InVivoChem (V2599) and Labrafac PG was obtained from GATTEFOSSÉ. Teterodoxin (ab120054) was purchased from abcam. Antibodies were purchased and used for immunoblotting at manufacturer-recommended concentrations (See Key Resources Table for complete list of reagents).
For growth assays, PDAC cells were washed with PBS before changing to the indicated media condition. Because glucose concentrations are at least 60% decreased in pancreatic tumors versus benign tissue ( Kamphorst et al., 2015 37. Kamphorst, J.J. ∙ Nofal, M. ∙ Commisso, C. ... Human pancreatic cancer tumors are nutrient poor and tumor cells actively scavenge extracellular protein Cancer Res. 2015; 75 :544-553 Crossref Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ), unless otherwise stated, growth curves and experiments were performed with DMEM (2.78mM (0.5g/L) glucose, 4mM glutamine, and 1mM pyruvate) + 10% dialyzed FBS, to mimic the glucose availability for serine biosynthesis. For 2X daily spike-in, Ser/Gly was added to PATU-8902 cells twice a day for the duration of the assay. Growth curves were measured by CyQUANT Cell Proliferation Assay kit (ThermoFisher) following manufacturer’s instructions.
For PDAC co-culture experiments with axons, 5,000 PDAC cells were evenly seeded into the wells on the axonal side after nerves have been established. The media was changed to Neurobasal A + B27, glutamine, and NGF on the neuronal side and DMEM (2.78mM glucose. +4mM glutamine and +1mM pyruvate) with or without serine and glycine on the axonal side. Hydrostatic pressure was established every day to prevent the flow of media from the neuronal side into the axonal side. For assessing gap junctions between axons and PDAC cells, neurons were completely labeled with calcein-AM on the neuronal side after six days. Afterward, exSer-dependent PDAC cells were monitored for calcein fluorescence. At the end of the experiment, images were taken, and cells were trypsinized and counted.
For PDAC co-culture experiments with human pancreatic stellate cells (HPSCs), 2,500 PDAC cells were seeded into a 1.0μm Boyden chamber insert with or without 2,500 or 12,500 HPSCs in the bottom on the well, and allowed to attach overnight. The media was changed to DMEM (2.78mM glucose. +4mM glutamine and +1mM pyruvate) + 10% dialyzed FBS with or without serine and glycine. exSer-dependent PDAC cells were counted at the indicated times.
For axon conditioned media (axCM), the wells and channels were washed with PBS twice and the media was changed to Neurobasal A + B27, glutamine, and NGF, without uridine and 5-FU, on the neuronal side and DMEM (2.78mM glucose and +1mM pyruvate) without amino acids on the axonal side or only with different concentrations of Ser/Gly as indicated. For teterodoxin and LOXO-101 experiments, the neuronal side was treated with or without 1uM TTX, 10nM or 1000nM LOXO-101. As a positive control, the NYU Langone Ion Channel and Immunology Core performed whole-cell patch clamp to assess TTX activity, as described below. LOXO-101 activity was assessed by monitoring Trk phosphorylation in rat DRGs treated with LOXO-101 for 24 hours, and stimulated with or without 50ng/mL NGF for 30mins. Hydrostatic pressure was established to prevent the flow of neuronal media into the axonal side. Conditioned media from the axonal side was collected after 24 hours and prepared for analysis by gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
To measure the amount of alanine, glycine and Ser produced and released by HPSCs, cells were seeded at different densities and allowed to adhere overnight. Wells were washed in PBS before changing media to DMEM (2.78mM 13 C 6 -glucose. +4mM glutamine and +1mM pyruvate) + 10% dialyzed FBS with or without serine and glycine. After 24 hours, cells were counted and media was collected to measure the amount of 13 C 6 -glucose-derived alanine, glycine, and serine released by HPSCs. Samples were prepared for GC-MS analysis as described in the Metabolomics section.
Whole-cell recordings were made using patch clamp techniques at 22–24°C (Axopatch 200B; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Currents were low-pass filtered with 8-pole Bessel filter (−3dB @ 1 Hz) and digitized at 3 kHz (DigiData 1550A, Molecular Devices) using pClamp v10.5 software. Patch electrodes were manufactured (Zeitz, Germany) using borosilicate glass (1.5 mm OD; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Rat DRG neurons were grown on 12-mm coverslips in 24-well culture plate, which were placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (DIAPHOT 300, Nikon). Standard patch clamp techniques were employed.
For recording the Na + currents in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration, pipettes had tip resistances of 1.8 - 2.5 MΩ when filled with (in mM): 50 CsCl, 60 CsF, 10 TEA-Cl, 20 EGTA, 5 Na2ATP, 10 HEPES, and pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH. Cells were initially kept in Tyrode’s solution, consisting of (in mM): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl2, 5 glucose, 0.1 CdCl2 and adjusted to pH 7.37 with NaOH. Following Giga-Ohm seal formation and successfully establishing the whole-cell mode, the extracellular solution was changed to the ‘test’ solution consisting of (in mM): 30 NaCl, 110 CsCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CdCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 glucose and pH 7.35 with CsOH. During this time, the whole-cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated to levels greater than 80%. Current-voltage relationships were constructed with a voltage clamp protocol that consisted of 20 ms voltage steps between −100 mV to +80 mV were applied in 10 mV increments at a frequency of 2 Hz. TTX was applied using a rapid solution exchange system (RSC-160, Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Seyssinet-Pariset, France). Data were not corrected for the liquid junction potential, calculated to be 3.1 mV. Current density (pA/pF) was calculated by dividing the measured current by the calculated cell capacitance.
For action potential recordings, the pipette resistances were 2.0 - 2.8 MΩ when filled with pipette solution consisting of (in mM): 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 Na2ATP, 10 HEPES, and pH 7.2 with KOH. The bath solution consisted of (in mM): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 Glucose and pH 7.35 with NaOH. Spontaneous action potentials were first recorded, if none, action potentials were evoked by depolarization pulse. Membrane potentials were adjusted by calculated junction potential (4.9 mV).
Blood samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding and plasma was used for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis at the indicated times. Tumors were harvested and weighed at the end of the experiment, 5 weeks post-injection. Tumors were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin for histology or fixed in paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3D imaging. Sectioning, H&E staining, Trichrome staining, and slide scanning were performed by the NYULMC Experimental Pathology Research Laboratory (NYULMC, New York, NY, USA).
Samples were prepared for Lightsheet imaging as described ( Butterworth et al., 2018 5. Butterworth, E. ∙ Dickerson, W. ∙ Vijay, V. ... High Resolution 3D Imaging of the Human Pancreas Neuro-insular Network J. Vis. Exp. 2018; 131 :56859 Google Scholar ). PFA-fixed tissue were embedded in a hydrogel (4% acrylamide, 1% PFA in 1X PBS) for three days at 4°C and protected from light. The hydrogel was then polymerized by degassing the oxygen from the solution using gaseous N 2 and placed in a 37°C incubator for three hours. The tissue was then cleared in a solution containing 4% SDS in 1X PBS at pH 8.5 and placed in a 37°C incubator for four weeks. The clearing solution was frequently changed. After clearing, the tissues were stained with primary and secondary antibodies in PACT staining buffer (1X PBS, 0.01% sodium azide and 0.1% triton-x-100) + 2% goat serum for four days each. Finally tissues are equilibrated in the refractive index matched solution (RIMS) buffer (50% histodenz in 1X PBS) for four days and imaged using the Zeiss Z1 Lightsheet microscope in the NYULMC Microscopy Laboratory (NYULMC, New York, NY, USA). Images were processed using Zeiss Zen software and Imaris (bitplane).
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and antigens were unmasked with citrate (pH 6) and heat. Sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in Methanol before being blocked with 1% goat serum in PBS. Samples that were unmasked with citrate buffer were stained with phospho-H3, cleaved caspase 3, PGP9.5, Th, Trpv1, VAchT,pan-Trk, and phospho-eIF2α. Sections were then stained using Vectastain anti-rabbit HRP kit (Vector Laboratories) and DAB (3,3′-diaminobenzidine) peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories). Briefly, sections were then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibodies, then by streptavidin-HRP and developed with DAB. Slides were scanned at the NYULMC Experimental Pathology Research Laboratory (NYULMC, New York, NY, USA) and whole tissue staining was quantified by Aperio ImageScope software (Leica Biosystems) in non-necrotic areas.
Human PDAC TMAs (IRB protocol: LAB05-0854) were stained for PHGDH at the NYULMC Center for Biospecimen Research and Development laboratory. TMAs also were stained with PGP9.5 as described above. Tissues were scored from 0 to 3 for PHGDH intensity by a GI pathologist or quantified by Aperio ImageScope software.
Cellular and tumor RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA mini kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) or TRIzol, respectively. Purified RNA was reversed transcribed using Superscript Vilo IV (ThermoFisher Scientific). The resultant cDNA was mixed with SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-rad), along with primers specific to PHGDH , ATF4 , HSPA5 (BIP) , DDIT3 (CHOP) , NGF , GFPd2 , and mCherry and 18S (See Table S5 for complete list of primers). Reactions were performed on the CFX96 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). ΔCT was calculated using 18S as a loading control. Fold-change was calculated relative to the indicated control.
For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates were generated in modified radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, and 0.1% SDS, without sodium deoxycholate supplemented with protease (ThermoFisher Scientific) and phosphatase (10mM NaF, 1mM Na 3 VO 4 , 10mM β-glycerophosphate, and 10mM sodium pyrophosphate) inhibitors. Bulk tumors were washed in PBS and homogenized in modified RIPA buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors, as described above. Protein lysates were loaded into 4%–12% gradient Boltz gels (Life Technologies) and transferred with 1X transfer buffer (Tris-glycine) and 10% methanol. Membranes were incubated with their respective primary antibodies, and visualized with IRDye infrared secondary antibodies, using an Odyssey Infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified for BIP, phosho-eIF2α, eIF2α, and ERK2 using Image Studio Lite (Li-Cor Biosciences).
Briefly, cells were washed in 0.9% saline and metabolites were extracted with 46% methanol:23% H 2 O:31% chloroform that contained labeled amino acid standards (MSK-A2-1.2, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc). Plasma samples were extracted using 75% acetonitrile: 25% methanol: 0.1% formic acid that contained labeled amino acid standards. Extracts were placed into 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes, vortexed at 4°C for 10mins and centrifuged at 4°C for 10mins at 17,200 x g in a microcentrifuge. The aqueous phase was transferred to vials for GC-MS or Eppendorf tubes for LC-MS. Samples were evaporated in a SpeedVac and samples were resolved by GC-MS or LC-MS.
For GC-MS, the metabolite extracts were derivatized with a solution of methoxamine (Sigma) dissolved in pyridine (Sigma) for 30mins at 37°C. An equal volume of tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) was added to the mixture and incubated at 37°C for 30mins. Samples were resolved by GC (Agilent, 122-3832UI), peaks were picked using OpenChrom ( Wenig and Odermatt, 2010 80. Wenig, P. ∙ Odermatt, J. OpenChrom: a cross-platform open source software for the mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic data BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :405 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ) and analyzed using MATLAB.
For LC-MS, metabolite extracts were submitted to the NYULMC Metabolomics Laboratory. Briefly, metabolite extracts were resolubilized and resolved by liquid chromatography using a p-HILIC column, peak heights were analyzed using Xcalibur (ThermoFisher Scientific).
All metabolites were normalized to the closest labeled amino acid standard and also the respective cell number of the sample.
NADH/NAD+ ratios were measured using a NADH and NAD+ Assay kit (Promega), performed per manufacturer’s instructions with slight differences. Briefly, 200,000 PDAC cells were grown in the presence and absence of Ser/Gly for 24 hours. When indicated, PDAC cells were treated with 50μM CHX or 2μM oligomycin A for 15 minutes prior to collection. Cells were washed in 0.9% saline, and metabolites were collected with 46% methanol:23% H2O:31% chloroform, as described above. Dried down samples were resuspended in PBS solution to measure NADH and NAD+ according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
D- and L-Ser was measured using a DL-Serine Assay kit (abcam), performed as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, conditioned media was pretreated with sample cleanup mix, deproteinized and transferred to 3K Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore-Sigma). Samples and D-Ser standards were measured and quantified following manufacturer’s protocol.
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured with an XF96 analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). Briefly, cells (18,000-20,000/well) were seeded in DMEM+10%FBS and allowed to adhere overnight. Media was changed to DMEM (2.78mM glucose, 4mM glutamine, 1mM pyruvate, with or without serine and glycine)+10% dialyzed FBS for 24 hours before measurements. Before placement into the analyzer, media was changed to DMEM to DMEM (2.78mM glucose, 4mM glutamine, 1mM pyruvate, with or without serine, glycine, phenol red and bicarbonate) + 10% dialyzed FBS ± 50μM CHX, and allowed to equilibrate for 1hr at 37°C, no CO 2 . Injection ports were loaded to achieve final working concentrations: serine (400μM), glycine (400μM), formate (1mM), oligomycin A (2μM), FCCP (0.5μM), rotenone (1μM) and antimycin A (1μM). For effects of axon-derived conditioned media (axCM) on OCR, cells were cultured in 50% DMEM (2.78mM glucose, 4mM glutamine, 1mM pyruvate, without serine and glycine)+10% dialyzed FBS and 50% axCM from control or rat DRG containing devices for 24 hours. The media was refreshed 1 hour prior to measuring OCR. The OCR measurements were normalized to changes in CyQUANT values.
Mitochondrial respiration measurements on isolated mitochondria was performed as described ( Divakaruni et al., 2014 18. Divakaruni, A.S. ∙ Rogers, G.W. ∙ Murphy, A.N. Measuring Mitochondrial Function in Permeabilized Cells Using the Seahorse XF Analyzer or a Clark-Type Oxygen Electrode Curr. Protoc. Toxicol. 2014; 60 :25.2.1-25.2.16 Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were permeabilized with Seahorse XF Plasma Membrane Permeabilizer (PMP,1nM) and the assay was immediately performed in 1X MAS buffer (220mM Mannitol, 70mM Sucrose, 10mM KH2PO4, 5mM MgCl2, 2mM HEPES, 1mM EGTA, 5mM pyruvate, 10mM malate, 10mM glutamate, 4mM ADP and pH 7.2). Injection ports were loaded to achieve final working concentrations: serine (400μM), oligomycin A (2μM), FCCP (0.5μM), rotenone (1μM) and antimycin A (1μM) in 1X MAS buffer.
GFPd2 and mCherry fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, PDAC MDA-MB-231, and SKMEL cells were grown with and without Ser/Gly, PH719 (Raze Therapeutics), and/or cyclohexamide (CHX) for 24hrs. As a control, PDAC cells also were grown with or without tyrosine or phenylalanine, and/or CHX for 24hrs. For Ser gradient studies, exSer-dependent PDAC cells were grown in several concentrations of Ser for 24hrs. Cells were trypsinized and recovered by centrifugation at 300 x g in a table top centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). The samples were collected using the CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and the data was analyzed using FlowJo. The geometric means were used to normalize GFPd2 to mCherry fluorescence to control for expression, and the value of CHX treated cells were subtracted from all the samples to calculate the maximum effects of tyrosine, phenylalanine, and Ser/Gly deprivation on GFPd2 fluorescence. Gating strategy is shown in Methods S1 .
ELISA assays to measure NGF (R&D, DY256) in conditioned media was assayed per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, PDAC cells were grown with different concentrations of Ser without Gly for 24hrs. For NGF secretion rate of wild-type and codon-optimized NGF, exSer-dependent PDAC cells expressing pLVX-EF1α-NGF-IRES-mCherry were grown with or without Ser/Gly for 24hrs. Media was refreshed and collected at the indicated time points. Cells were centrifuged at 300 x g in a table top centrifuge and media was collected for NGF measurements. NGF secretion was normalized to cell number or mCherry signal.
The following reagents were employed: Isobaric TMT reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific), BCA protein concentration assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Empore-C18 material for in-house made StageTips (3 M), Sep-Pak cartridges (100 mg, Waters), solvents for Liquid chromatography (LC) (J.T. Baker), mass spectrometry (MS)-grade trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Lys-C protease (Wako), and cOmplete protease inhibitors (Millipore Sigma). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cell pellets from PATU-8902 cells were lysed using 8 M urea, 200 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (EPPS) at pH 8.5 with protease inhibitors. Samples were further homogenized, and DNA was sheered via sonication using a probe sonicator (20 × 0.5sec pulses; level 3). Total protein was determined using a BCA assay and stored at −80°C until future use. A total of 100 μg of protein was aliquoted for each condition and TMT channel for further downstream processing. Protein extracts were reduced using 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at room temperature. Next samples were alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min in the dark at room temperature. To facilitate the removal of incompatible reagents, proteins were precipitated using chloroform methanol. Briefly, to 100 μL of each sample, 400 μL of methanol was added, followed by 100 μL of chloroform with thorough vortexing. Next, 300 μL of HPLC grade water was added and samples were vortexed thoroughly. Each sample was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. The upper aqueous layer was removed, and the protein pellet was washed twice with methanol and centrifuged at 14 000 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Protein pellets were re-solubilized in 200 mM EPPS buffer and digested overnight with Lys-C (1:100, enzyme: protein ratio) at room temperature. The next day, trypsin (1:100 ratio) was added and incubated at 37°C for an additional 6 hr in a ThermoMixer set to 1,200 RPM. Digested samples were labeled immediately or stored at −80°C until future use.
To each digested sample, 30% anhydrous acetonitrile was added and 100 μg of peptides were labeled using 200 μg of TMT reagent (TMT1-TMT11). To equalized protein loading, a ratio check was performed by pooling 2 μg of each TMT-labeled sample. Samples were combined and desalted using in-house packed C18 StageTips and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Normalization factors were calculated from this label check, samples were mixed 1:1 across all TMT channels and desalted using a 100 mg Sep-Pak solid phase extraction cartridge. Eluted pooled peptides were fractionated immediately or stored at −80°C until future use.
Pooled TMT labeled peptide samples were resuspended in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 5% acetonitrile, pH 8.0 buffer and were fractionated with basic-pH reverse-phase (bRP) HPLC using an Agilent 300 extend C18 column and collected into a 96 deep-well plate. Peptides were subjected to a 50 min linear gradient from 13 to 43% buffer B (10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 90% acetonitrile, pH 8.0) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Samples were consolidated into 24 fractions as previously described, and 24 fractions were desalted using StageTips prior to analyses using LC-MS/MS ( Navarrete-Perea et al., 2018 53.

All mass spectrometry data was acquired using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer in-line with a Proxeon NanoLC-1000 UHPLC system. Peptides were separated using an in-house 100 um capillary column packed with 40 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 um, 150 Å) (ThermoFisher Scientific) using a 120 min LC gradient from 4 to 24% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid per fraction. Eluted peptides were acquired using a synchronous precursor selection (SPS-MS3) method for TMT quantification as previously described ( McAlister et al., 2014 50. McAlister, G.C. ∙ Nusinow, D.P. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... MultiNotch MS3 enables accurate, sensitive, and multiplexed detection of differential expression across cancer cell line proteomes Anal. Chem. 2014; 86 :7150-7158 Crossref Scopus (890) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, MS1 spectra were acquired at 120K resolving power with a maximum of 50 ms in the Orbitrap. MS2 spectra were acquired by selecting the top 10 most abundant features via collisional induced dissociation (CID) in the ion trap using an automatic gain control (AGC) of 15K, quadrupole isolation width of 0.5 m/z and a maximum ion time of 50 ms. For MS3 acquisition, a synchronous precursor selection of 10 fragment ions was acquired with an AGC of 150K for 150 ms and a normalized collision energy of 65.
All acquired data were processed using Comet ( Eng et al., 2013 22. Eng, J.K. ∙ Jahan, T.A. ∙ Hoopmann, M.R. Comet: an open-source MS/MS sequence database search tool Proteomics. 2013; 13 :22-24 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar , 2015 23. Eng, J.K. ∙ Hoopmann, M.R. ∙ Jahan, T.A. ... A deeper look into Comet--implementation and features J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2015; 26 :1865-1874 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a previously described in-house informatics pipeline ( Elias and Gygi, 2007 20. Elias, J.E. ∙ Gygi, S.P. Target-decoy search strategy for increased confidence in large-scale protein identifications by mass spectrometry Nat. Methods. 2007; 4 :207-214 Crossref Scopus (3088) PubMed Google Scholar ; Eng et al., 1994 21. Eng, J.K. ∙ McCormack, A.L. ∙ Yates, J.R. An approach to correlate tandem mass spectral data of peptides with amino acid sequences in a protein database J. Am. Soc.

A tissue-specific atlas of mouse protein phosphorylation and expression Cell. 2010; 143 :1174-1189 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1348) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, peptide spectral libraries were first filtered to a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% using linear discriminant analysis employing a target decoy strategy. Spectral searches were done using a custom fasta formatted database which included common contaminants, reversed sequences (Uniprot Human, 2014) and the following parameters: 50 ppm precursor tolerance, fully tryptic peptides, fragment ion tolerance of 0.9 Da and a static modification of TMT (+229.163 Da) on lysine and peptide N-termini, carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) were set as static modifications, while oxidation of methionine residues (+15.995 Da) was set as a variable modification. Resulting peptides were further filtered to obtain a 1% protein FDR and proteins were collapsed into groups. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for impurities during synthesis of different TMT reagents according to the manufacturer’s specifications. For quantitation, a total sum signal-to-noise of all report ion ions of 100 was required for analysis. Lastly, protein quantitative values were normalized so that the sum of the signal for all protein in each channel was equal to account for sample loading.
Ribosomal profiling was performed as described ( Ingolia et al., 2012 34. Ingolia, N.T. ∙ Brar, G.A. ∙ Rouskin, S. ... The ribosome profiling strategy for monitoring translation in vivo by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :1534-1550 Crossref Scopus (857) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were washed in cold PBS containing 100μg/mL CHX and RNA was extracted from cells using 1X polysome lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 5mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM DTT, 10U Turbo DNase, 100μg/mL CHX, and 0.1% NP-40. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4°C at 20,000 x g for 10mins and separated for total RNA and ribosome protected fragments (RPFs).
For RPFs samples, RNA was digested with RNase I for 45mins at room temperature and purified using MicroSpin S-400 columns and Zymo Research RNA clean & Concentrator kit. The RPF footprints were run on a TBE-Urea gel and the bands corresponding to the 26-34 nucleotide (nt) region was excised and the RNA was extracted for further preparation. Total RNA was purified using Zymo Research RNA clean & Concentrator kit and heat fragmented for further preparation. RNA end-repair were performed using T4 PNK for both the total RNA fragments and RPFs, and purified using the Zymo Research RNA clean & Concentrator kit. A 3′ adaptor was ligated to the total RNA fragments and RPFs using a universal preadenylated linker (NEB), ran on a TBE-Urea gel and purified by gel excision and extraction. Samples were reversed transcribed and cDNAs were excised and extracted from a TBE-Urea gel. Next, cDNAs were circularized using circLigase and rRNA was depleted using a set of biotinylated rRNA depletion oligomers. Sequencing library was amplified from rRNA-depleted cDNAs using Phusion HF and the products were excised and extracted from a TBE gel. Sequencing library was submitted to NYULMC genome technology core for analysis on the HiSeq4000.
Ribosome profiling analysis was performed as described by Darnell et al. (2018) 16. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar . The 50 nucleotide (nt) single-end raw sequencing reads were trimmed for the adaptor sequence 5′-CTGTAGGCACCATCAAT-3′ using cutadapt ( Martin, 2011 48. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet.journal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) with a minimum length of 13 nt. Ribosomal RNA were removed using bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 40. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the remaining sequences were aligned to the transcriptome using rsem ( Li and Dewey, 2011 41. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13966) PubMed Google Scholar ) and bowtie2. To calculate the ribosome density at codons, and because the precise frame information was not required, 12nt were trimmed from both sides to smooth the ribosome density profiles as described by multiple studies ( Darnell et al., 2018 16. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oh et al., 2011 55. Oh, E. ∙ Becker, A.H. ∙ Sandikci, A. ... Selective ribosome profiling reveals the cotranslational chaperone action of trigger factor in vivo Cell. 2011; 147 :1295-1308 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (348) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subramaniam et al., 2014 72. Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ Zid, B.M. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. An integrated approach reveals regulatory controls on bacterial translation elongation Cell. 2014; 159 :1200-1211 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). The average ribosome density around each codon was calculated by considering only transcripts with a minimum average read density of 1 read per codon, which were then normalized to the mean read count for that transcript. For each codon, the average read coverage was found for each position in a 150nt window on either side of all occurrences of that codon. The change in ribosome density around each codon upon Ser/Gly-deprivation was calculated by subtracting the average ribosome density at each position in the 150nt window around the codon in the Ser/Gly-rich conditions from the Ser/Gly-deprived conditions. This determined the changes in ribosome density on all codons upon Ser/Gly-limitation.
tRNA charging and fractional abundance measurements were performed as described with some modifications ( Evans et al., 2017 24. Evans, M.E. ∙ Clark, W.C. ∙ Zheng, G. ... Determination of tRNA aminoacylation levels by high-throughput sequencing Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :e133 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, RNA was extracted using TRIzol, treated with 50mM of sodium periodate to determine charge and uncharged tRNAs, and repaired with 60mM sodium borate (pH 9.5). tRNAs were gel purified, and demethylated (ArrayStar tRNA RT-PCR Kit). RNA end-repair were performed using T4 PNK on demethylated tRNAs, and purified. A 3′ adaptor was ligated to the demethylated tRNAs using a universal preadenylated linker (NEB), ran on a TBE-Urea gel and purified by gel excision and extraction. Samples were reversed transcribed and cDNAs were excised and extracted from a TBE-Urea gel. Next, cDNAs were circularized using circLigase II, and Sequencing library were amplified using Phusion HF. The products were excised and extracted from a TBE gel. Sequencing library was submitted to NYULMC genome technology core for analysis on the HiSeq4000. Analysis of tRNA charging and fractional abundance were performed ( Evans et al., 2017 24. Evans, M.E. ∙ Clark, W.C. ∙ Zheng, G. ... Determination of tRNA aminoacylation levels by high-throughput sequencing Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :e133 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). Codes and scripts were obtained from Dr. Tao Pan’s lab, and are available at https://github.com/Jessica-Pan/DM-tRNA-seq-ref-genomes .
Analysis was performed as described ( Darnell et al., 2018 16. Darnell, A.M. ∙ Subramaniam, A.R. ∙ O’Shea, E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells Mol. Cell. 2018; 71 :229-243 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a binomial probability distribution for each gene was used to estimate the probability of the observed number of TCC and TCT codons to the genome-wide average of Ser codon frequencies. To avoid skew due to differences in TCN versus AGN (where N, can be A, C, T, and G) bias/frequencies in our analyses, we only considered pause-site (TCT/TCC) and non-pause-site (TCG/TCA) serine codons. The average frequency of stall sites relative to other TCN codons (p = 0.66). The Z-score was then calculated using the calculated theoretical binomial probability distribution, the standard deviation of that theoretical binomial probability distribution, and the observed number of stalled Ser codons for each gene. Low and high Z-scores predict genes that would least and most likely affected by Ser codon usage bias, respectively. The resulting Z-score ranged from −12.3 to 9.79 and represents bias against (low scores) or toward (high scores) the use of pause-site serine codons to encode serine in each gene. The 95 th (1.89) and 5 th (−2.04) percentile Z-scores were used as cutoff values for further analyses ( Table S2 ). Using R and dlpyr , a list of genes that overlapped with the proteins identify by quantitative proteomics was generated to determine the association with the calculated Z-Score ( Table S3 ). The protein abundance of the top 50 genes predicted to be most or least affected according to changes calculated Z-Score was plotted as a waterfall plot. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) ( Subramanian et al., 2005 73. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33572) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to identify enrichment for Canonical Pathways in the MSigDB collections ( Liberzon et al., 2015 43. Liberzon, A. ∙ Birger, C. ∙ Thorvaldsdóttir, H. ... The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection Cell Syst. 2015; 1 :417-425 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6393) PubMed Google Scholar ) in genes with biased usage of pause-site and non-pause-site serine codons. Canonical pathways with a false-discovery rate adjusted p value of < 0.05 were considered significant.
For the MD Anderson TMA dataset, samples were grouped into PHGDH low (grade 0, 1, and 2), and high (grade 3+) based on the PHGDH staining score. The overall survival of PHGDH low and high tumors was plotted, and the frequency differentiation status and tumor size were compared. The correlation of PHGDH and PGP9.5 staining from TMA sections were performed by comparing tumors with high PHGDH or PGP9.5, by setting a greater than one standard deviation cutoff. The TCGA PDAC dataset (RNA-seq, methylation, and survival data) was obtained using cBioportal (TCGA, Firehose Legacy) ( Cerami et al., 2012 8. Cerami, E. ∙ Gao, J. ∙ Dogrusoz, U. ... The cBio cancer genomics portal: an open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data Cancer Discov. 2012; 2 :401-404 Crossref Scopus (11622) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gao et al., 2013 27.

Signal. 2013; 6 :pl1 Crossref Scopus (10632) PubMed Google Scholar ). For overall survival, samples were grouped into PHGDH high and low expressing tumors, using an expression cutoff of less than −0.5 standard deviation. The Basal and Classical molecular subtypes of PDAC tumors from the TCGA were obtained from a published study to assess differences in PHGDH expression ( The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017 76. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network Integrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Cancer Cell. 2017; 32 :185-203 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1223) PubMed Google Scholar ). The correlation of PHGDH and NGF expression from TCGA dataset was performed by comparing tumors with high PHGDH and NGF expression, by setting a cutoff of a greater than one standard deviation. The RNA-seq and methylation for PDAC cell lines were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) ( Ghandi et al., 2019 29. Ghandi, M. ∙ Huang, F.W. ∙ Jané-Valbuena, J. ... Next-generation characterization of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Nature. 2019; 569 :503-508 Crossref Scopus (1784) PubMed Google Scholar ). Analyses were performed on exSer-dependent and –independent PDAC cells. The molecular subtypes of the PDAC cell lines were obtained from a published study ( Yu et al., 2019 84. Yu, K. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Aran, D. ... Comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of cell lines as models of primary tumors across 22 tumor types Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3574 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). All plots were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation.
Sample sizes ( n ), what “ n ” represents, definition of center, dispersion and precision measures, and statistical tests for each experiment are denoted in the figure legends. Each immunoblot was performed at least three times. All orthotopic xenografts represent one independent experiment with the indicated biological replicates. All metabolomics data represent n = 5 biological replicates for each group. All immunohistochemical images show samples from a single mouse of each group, and quantification was performed on all biological replicates in the experiment, with the number of data points indicating the number of independent biological replicates. For datasets that were skewed or contained outliers as determined by the ROUT test, dataset was transformed, followed by the indicated statistical analysis. The between-group variances were similar, and the data were normally distributed. All analyses and graphs were generated with GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered significant, precise p-value s can be found in the figures.
