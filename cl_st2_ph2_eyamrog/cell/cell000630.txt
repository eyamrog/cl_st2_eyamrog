Title: An inter-organ neural circuit for appetite suppression


Abstract: Summary

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a signal peptide released from enteroendocrine cells of the lower intestine. GLP-1 exerts anorectic and antimotility actions that protect the body against nutrient malabsorption. However, little is known about how intestinal GLP-1 affects distant organs despite rapid enzymatic inactivation. We show that intestinal GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying and eating via intestinofugal neurons, a subclass of myenteric neurons that project to abdominal sympathetic ganglia. Remarkably, cell-specific ablation of intestinofugal neurons eliminated intestinal GLP-1 effects, and their chemical activation functioned as a GLP-1 mimetic. GLP-1 sensing by intestinofugal neurons then engaged a sympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic pathway that links abnormal stomach distension to craniofacial programs for food rejection. Within this pathway, cell-specific activation of discrete neuronal populations caused systemic GLP-1-like effects. These molecularly identified, delimited enteric circuits may be targeted to ameliorate the abdominal bloating and loss of appetite typical of gastric motility disorders.

Section: Introduction

Proglucagon-derived glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an intestinal signal peptide secreted from enteroendocrine L cells of the lower intestine ( Dailey and Moran, 2013 17.

Synthetic GLP-1 analogs, which act as agonists of the GLP-1 receptor, are widely used to control appetite and glucose excursions in overweight individuals ( Drucker, 2018 21. Drucker, D.J. Mechanisms of action and therapeutic application of glucagon-like peptide-1 Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :740-756 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (913) PubMed Google Scholar ). When exogenously administered, GLP-1 potently inhibits food intake and delays gastric emptying by inducing the relaxation of the gastric fundus ( Drucker, 2018 21. Drucker, D.J.

Under physiological conditions, gut-derived GLP-1 secretion is stimulated by direct contact of luminal nutrients with L cells ( Herrmann-Rinke et al., 1995 32.

Critically, most L cells reside in the non-absorptive parts of the lower intestine ( Eissele et al., 1992 22. Eissele, R. ∙ Göke, R. ∙ Willemer, S. ...

Dissecting the physiology and pathophysiology of glucagon-like peptide-1 Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2018; 9 :584 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, GLP-1 acts to protect the body against malabsorption by inhibiting upper gastrointestinal transit and by inducing anorectic perceptions such as fullness and discomfort ( Plamboeck et al., 2013 58. Plamboeck, A. ∙ Veedfald, S. ∙ Deacon, C.F. ... The effect of exogenous GLP-1 on food intake is lost in male truncally vagotomized subjects with pyloroplasty Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

The physiological role of GLP-1 in human: incretin, ileal brake or more? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :109-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although it has been generally assumed that endogenous GLP-1 is an endocrine hormone, this concept appears to be problematic ( Burcelin et al., 2009 10. Burcelin, R. ∙ Serino, M. ∙ Cabou, C. A role for the gut-to-brain GLP-1-dependent axis in the control of metabolism Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9 :744-752 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; D’Alessio, 2016 18. D’Alessio, D. Is GLP-1 a hormone: whether and When? J. Diabetes Investig. 2016; 7 :50-55 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike its synthetic analogs, endogenous GLP-1 is very rapidly inactivated by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 in intestinal capillaries and the liver ( Deacon, 2005 19. Deacon, C.F. What do we know about the secretion and degradation of incretin hormones? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :117-124 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hansen et al., 1999 31. Hansen, L. ∙ Deacon, C.F. ∙ Orskov, C. ... Glucagon-like peptide-1-(7–36)amide is transformed to glucagon-like peptide-1-(9–36)amide by dipeptidyl peptidase IV in the capillaries supplying the L cells of the porcine intestine Endocrinology. 1999; 140 :5356-5363 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, most of secreted GLP-1 is inactivated before it leaves the gut ( Holst et al., 2022 35. Holst, J.J. ∙ Andersen, D.B. ∙ Grunddal, K.V. Actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor ligands in the gut Br. J. Pharmacol. 2022; 179 :727-742 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ), with only a minor fraction remaining intact by the time it reaches arterial circulation ( D’Alessio, 2016 18. D’Alessio, D. Is GLP-1 a hormone: whether and When? J. Diabetes Investig. 2016; 7 :50-55 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, postprandial rises in plasma GLP-1 are very modest in humans ( Vilsbøll et al., 2001 83. Vilsbøll, T. ∙ Krarup, T. ∙ Deacon, C.F. ... Reduced postprandial concentrations of intact biologically active glucagon-like peptide 1 in type 2 diabetic patients Diabetes. 2001; 50 :609-613 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with experiments in rodents that argue against a role for systemic increases in endogenous GLP-1 in satiation ( Punjabi et al., 2011 61. Punjabi, M. ∙ Arnold, M. ∙ Geary, N. ... Peripheral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and satiation Physiol. Behav. 2011; 105 :71-76 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous GLP-1 primarily acts locally before rapid degradation ( Vahl et al., 2007 81. Vahl, T.P. ∙ Tauchi, M. ∙ Durler, T.S. ... Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors expressed on nerve terminals in the portal vein mediate the effects of endogenous GLP-1 on glucose tolerance in rats Endocrinology. 2007; 148 :4965-4973 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Unfortunately, the peripheral mechanisms of endogenous GLP-1 action remain unclear ( Burmeister et al., 2017 11. Burmeister, M.A. ∙ Ayala, J.E. ∙ Smouse, H. ... The hypothalamic glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor is sufficient but not necessary for the regulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis in mice Diabetes. 2017; 66 :372-384 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Drucker, 2018 21. Drucker, D.J. Mechanisms of action and therapeutic application of glucagon-like peptide-1 Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :740-756 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (913) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2009 41. Kim, D.H. ∙ D’Alessio, D.A. ∙ Woods, S.C. ... The effects of GLP-1 infusion in the hepatic portal region on food intake Regul. Pept. 2009; 155 :110-114 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schirra and Göke, 2005 69. Schirra, J. ∙ Göke, B. The physiological role of GLP-1 in human: incretin, ileal brake or more? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :109-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). One distinct possibility is that gut enteric neurons mediate the systemic effects of intestinal GLP-1 ( Burcelin et al., 2009 10. Burcelin, R. ∙ Serino, M. ∙ Cabou, C. A role for the gut-to-brain GLP-1-dependent axis in the control of metabolism Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9 :744-752 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Holst et al., 2022 35.

Accordingly, here we test the hypothesis that intestinal GLP-1 triggers gut-brain neural transmission by recruiting local enteric circuitries. Our rationale is that enteric neurons engaged by intestinal GLP-1 may be targeted to alleviate the anorexia and abdominal bloating typical of motility disorders such as gastroparesis and irritable bowel syndrome ( Tack et al., 2006 76. Tack, J. ∙ Talley, N.J. ∙ Camilleri, M. ... Functional gastroduodenal disorders Gastroenterology. 2006; 130 :1466-1479 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1511) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Section: Results

GLP-1 effects are traditionally studied via either systemic or brain injections. Our aim is to model intestinal GLP-1 secretion by ileal L cells (L Cells ). To optogenetically activate L Cells in vivo , Gcg iCre mice were crossed to mice expressing a Cre- inducible channelrhodopsin-2/EYFP fusion protein (Ai32 mice). In Gcg iCre ×Ai32 mice, a blue laser beam was directed to the terminal ileum via an implanted glass window (see the descriptive table with details for all surgical procedures in STAR Methods ). Laser stimulation of L Cells resulted in (∼100%) enlargements of gastric volumes ( Figures 1 A, S1 A, and S1B). Laser stimulation also heightened neuronal activity in GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)-expressing ileal myenteric neurons ( Figures S1 C and S1D). We then employed chemogenetic approaches ( Sternson and Roth, 2014 73. Sternson, S.M. ∙ Roth, B.L. Chemogenetic tools to interrogate brain functions Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37 :387-407 Crossref Scopus (371) PubMed Google Scholar ) to perform behavioral assays upon L Cell stimulation. Gcg iCre mice were crossed to CAG-LSL-Gq mice, allowing Cre -inducible expression of the HA-hM3Dq-pta-mCitrine in L Cells . An ileal catheter was implanted in Gcg iCre ×CAG-LSL-Gq mice, through which the designer drug clozapine- N -oxide (CNO) was infused (5 mg/kg, 50 μL over 10 s for all intra-intestinal infusions). Again, chemical stimulation of L Cells resulted in equally pronounced (∼100%) enlargements of gastric volumes. Importantly, this effect was not observed after equivalent intra-peritoneal injections ( Figure 1 B). Ileal CNO injections also resulted in (∼50% of baseline) appetite loss ( Figure 1 C). Gastric distention and anorexia were blocked by ileal infusions of the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin9-39 ( Figures 1 B and 1C), implying that secretion of GLP-1 by L Cells is required for these effects.
To approximate the localization and dynamics of GLP-1 release by L Cells , we implanted a catheter in the lower ileum of mice to perform luminal intra-ileal GLP-1 infusions (GLP-1 ii , 20–25 pmol/kg, 50 μL over 10 s for all intra-intestinal infusions; see STAR Methods and Jessen et al., 2012 38. Jessen, L. ∙ Aulinger, B.A. ∙ Hassel, J.L. ... Suppression of food intake by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: relative potencies and role of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 Endocrinology. 2012; 153 :5735-5745 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ; Paternoster and Falasca, 2018 56. Paternoster, S. ∙ Falasca, M. Dissecting the physiology and pathophysiology of glucagon-like peptide-1 Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2018; 9 :584 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). GLP-1 ii was sufficient to induce ∼100% enlargements in gastric volume concomitantly to reducing eating to ∼50% of baseline in food-restricted mice ( Figures 1 D and 1E). Baseline plasma glucose levels remained unaffected ( Figure S1 E). Indeed, GLP-1 ii primarily impacted gastric motility since electromyograms from awake mice showed reductions in stomach contractions ( Figure 1 F). Importantly, neither gastric nor feeding effects were detected after intra-peritoneal GLP-1 injections ( Figures 1 G and 1H). Although equivalent intra-cerebroventricular GLP-1 (GLP-1 icv ) did inhibit eating, they failed to affect gastric volume ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Local infusion of exendin9-39 into ileum abolished GLP-1 ii effects ( Figure S1 F), demonstrating the dependency of GLP-1 ii on local GLP-1R signaling. Moreover, ileal infusions of bile acids, potent GLP-1 secretagogues ( Lund et al., 2020 47. Lund, M.L. ∙ Sorrentino, G. ∙ Egerod, K.L. ... L-cell differentiation is induced by bile acids through GPBAR1 and paracrine GLP-1 and serotonin signaling Diabetes. 2020; 69 :614-623 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), recapitulated the GLP-1R-dependent effects of both GLP-1 ii and L Cell stimulation ( Figures S1 G–S1J). Finally, using FRET imaging ( Jares-Erijman and Jovin, 2003 37. Jares-Erijman, E.A. ∙ Jovin, T.M. FRET imaging Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21 :1387-1395 Crossref Scopus (1687) PubMed Google Scholar ), we detected GLP-1 signals in the submucosa layers of ileum innervated by processes arising from GLP-1R+ myenteric neurons ( Figures 1 K, 1L, S1 K, and S1L). We conclude that GLP-1 signaling generates site-specific physiological effects.
Consistent with such a key role for ileal GLP-1 receptors, most ileal myenteric neurons responsive to GLP-1 ii expressed GLP-1Rs ( Figures 1 M and S1 M), and intravital measurements of calcium transients in Glp1r-ires-Cre×Ai148D mice implanted with the abdominal window confirmed the robust responsivity (∼89%) of ileal myenteric GLP-1R+ neurons to GLP-1 ii ( Figure 1 N). In contrast, and unlike GLP-1 icv , GLP-1 ii failed to activate GLP-1R+ neurons in the area postrema ( Figures S1 N–S1Q). Next, we ablated ileal GLP-1Rs by locally injecting diphtheria toxin (DT) into the terminal ileum of the Glp1r-ires-Cre x iDTR mice. This eliminated the dose-dependent gastric, neuronal, and anorectic effects of GLP-1 ii ( Figures 1 O, 1P, S1 R, and S1S). In contrast, eliminating the GLP-1R+ neurons in the area postrema did not impact GLP-1 ii actions ( Figures S1 T and S1U). Thus, local GLP-1Rs are obligatory mediators of the systemic effects induced by ileal L Cells .
We injected the Cre -dependent, excitatory chemogenetic construct AAVdj-DIO-Gs-mCherry into the ileum of Glp1r-ires-Cre mice to activate GLP-1R+ enteric neurons. The injections of CNO recapitulated the gastric, anorectic, and central effects of GLP-1 ii ( Figures 1 Q, 1R, and S1 V).
Systemic GLP-1 injections activate abdominal sympathetic ganglia in mice ( Muller et al., 2020 52. Muller, P.A. ∙ Schneeberger, M. ∙ Matheis, F. ... Microbiota modulate sympathetic neurons via a gut-brain circuit Nature. 2020; 583 :441-446 Crossref Scopus (230) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that chemogenetic stimulation of GLP-1R+ enteric neurons was sufficient to induce c-fos protein (Fos) expression in abdominal sympathetic celiac ganglia (CG, Figures 2 A and S2 ). Critically, we observed the strong expression of mCherry-positive terminal fibers in CG, in close apposition to Fos+ neurons (i.e., terminals arising from ileal GLP-1R+ neurons transfected with the chemogenetic construct AAVdj-DIO-Gs-mCherry; Figures 2 B, S2 A, and S2B). We hypothesized that ileal GLP-1+ neurons are intestinofugal (IFN; i.e., myenteric neurons that project to abdominal sympathetic ganglia; Furness, 2006 23. Furness, J.B. Novel gut afferents: intrinsic afferent neurons and intestinofugal neurons Auton. Neurosci. 2006; 125 :81-85 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hibberd et al., 2020 33. Hibberd, T.J. ∙ Yew, W.P. ∙ Chen, B.N. ... A novel mode of sympathetic reflex activation mediated by the enteric nervous system eNeuro. 2020; 7 ENEURO.0187-20.2020 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ; Szurszewski et al., 2002 75. Szurszewski, J.H. ∙ Ermilov, L.G. ∙ Miller, S.M. Prevertebral ganglia and intestinofugal afferent neurones Gut. 2002; 51 :i6-i10 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon injecting the retrograde adeno-associated virus AAVrg-EGFP into CG, we observed that IFNs invariably expressed GLP-1Rs ( Figures 2 C, 2D, S2 C, and S2D). RNA expression analyses also confirmed that IFNs are enriched in Glp-1r expression ( Figure 2 E).
To cell-specifically ablate IFNs, we injected the retrograde, Cre -expressing virus AAVrg-EGFP-Cre in the celiac ganglia (CG) of iDTR mice. Ileal DT injections eliminated the gastric, anorectic, as well as the CG and brain effects induced by GLP-1 ii ; moreover, this treatment equally suppressed GLP-1R expression in the ileal, but not jejunal, myenteric layer ( Figures 2 F–2I and S2 E–S2J). Of note, IFN ablation was sufficient to abolish gastric distension induced by intra-peritoneal injections of the GLP-1R agonist Exendin-4 ( Figure S2 K). This implies that systemic GLP-1 drugs also engage GLP-1R+ ileal myenteric neurons to reduce gut motility.
To cell-specifically activate IFNs, we once again injected AAV2-retro-hSyn.HI.eGFP-Cre in CG, followed by Cre -dependent AAVdj—DIO-Gs-mCherry into the ileum of wild-type mice. CNO injections closely mimicked the neuronal and appetite-reducing effects of GLP-1 ii ( Figures 2 J–2M and S2 L–S2N). Of note, ablating CG neurons via injections into CG of the Cre -induced caspase3 construct AAV-flex-Casp3 abolished the effects of IFN chemical activation (see Figure 2 L), implying that IFNs engage CG to transduce ileal GLP-1 signals. In sum, ileal IFNs are necessary and sufficient for the gastric and feeding effects produced by local GLP-1 release.
The “ileal brake” refers to the phenomenon by which the presence of nutrients or bile within the distal intestine triggers an intestino-gastric feedback loop that inhibits upper gut motility and appetite (thereby preventing nutrient malabsorption; Read et al., 1984 63. Read, N.W. ∙ McFarlane, A. ∙ Kinsman, R.I. ... Effect of infusion of nutrient solutions into the ileum on gastrointestinal transit and plasma levels of neurotensin and enteroglucagon Gastroenterology. 1984; 86 :274-280 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schirra and Göke, 2005 69. Schirra, J. ∙ Göke, B. The physiological role of GLP-1 in human: incretin, ileal brake or more? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :109-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Intestinal GLP-1 has been implicated in this defensive mechanism ( Giralt and Vergara, 1999 26. Giralt, M. ∙ Vergara, P. Glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) participation in ileal brake induced by intraluminal peptones in rat Dig. Dis. Sci. 1999; 44 :322-329 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schirra and Göke, 2005 69. Schirra, J. ∙ Göke, B. The physiological role of GLP-1 in human: incretin, ileal brake or more? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :109-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore hypothesized that IFN inhibition would disrupt the ileal brake reflex. To inhibit IFNs, we once again injected AAVrg-EGFP-Cre in CG followed by injections in the ileum of the Cre -dependent inhibitory designer receptor construct AAVdj-DIO-Gi-mCherry. Chemogenetic inhibition of IFNs abolished the anorectic effects of ileal lipid infusions ( Figures 2 N–2P and S2 O–S2Q), recapitulating the effects of exendin9-39 to the ileum. These studies implicate IFNs as key mediators of the ileal brake reflex.
Using cells-specific anatomical, chemogenetic, and ablation approaches, we established that IFNs act on the stomach by recruiting stomach-innervating noradrenergic CG neurons (henceforth CG NA−Stom ; for details, see ileal-stomach connectivity via abdominal sympathetic ganglia section in STAR Methods ). These studies are shown in Figures 3 and S3 .
We hypothesized that inhibitory gastric neuronal mechanisms operate downstream of the L Cell → IFN Stom → CG NA−Stom circuitry. The stomach contains neurons expressing either neuronal nitric oxide (Nos1) or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), respectively the main inhibitory and excitatory markers for gut motor neurons ( Furness et al., 2014 24. Furness, J.B. ∙ Callaghan, B.P. ∙ Rivera, L.R. ... The enteric nervous system and gastrointestinal innervation: integrated local and central control Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2014; 817 :39-71 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since sympathetic tone inhibits gut motility, we tested the hypothesis that Nos1+ gastric neurons (henceforth Nos1 Stom ) are the preferential targets of CG NA−Stom . To visualize CG Stom targets, we injected AAVrg-EGFP-Cre into the muscle layers of the stomach body, followed by injections of the herpes simplex strain HSV-LSL-TK-tdTomato ( Lo and Anderson, 2011 46. Lo, L. ∙ Anderson, D.J. A Cre-dependent, anterograde transsynaptic viral tracer for mapping output pathways of genetically marked neurons Neuron. 2011; 72 :938-950 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ) into CG. Herpes-infected neurons were predominantly Nos1 Stom ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and S4 A). In contrast, similar injections into the parasympathetic dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) infected predominantly ChAT+ neurons (henceforth ChAT Stom ; Figure S4 B). Consistently, we observed dense labeling in CG (and sensory ganglia) upon rabies SAD-ΔG-GFP injections into the stomach of Nos1 cre but not of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice ( Figures 4 C, 4D, and S4 A–S4C). Thus, CG Stom preferentially and densely target Nos1 Stom .
In vivo , GLP-1 ii caused preferential Fos expression in Nos1 Stom , an effect abolished by the ablation of CG NA−Stom with DβH–saporin, a compound that acts to specifically ablate noradrenaline cells via retrograde uptake ( Milstein et al., 2007 51. Milstein, J.A. ∙ Lehmann, O. ∙ Theobald, D.E. ... Selective depletion of cortical noradrenaline by anti-dopamine beta-hydroxylase-saporin impairs attentional function and enhances the effects of guanfacine in the rat Psychopharmacol. (Berl.). 2007; 190 :51-63 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 4 E, 4F, and S4 D). Moreover, cell-specific intravital imaging of Nos1 cre mice showed that ∼44% of Nos1 Stom were activated by GLP-1 ii ( Figure 4 G). In contrast, only ∼16% of ChAT Stom were activated by GLP-1 ii ( Figure 4 H).
We therefore predicted that Nos1 Stom are critical for the bloating and anorectic effects of GLP-1 ii . We cell-specifically ablated Nos1 Stom by injecting the Cre -inducible caspase3 construct AAV1-flex-Casp3 into the body of the stomach of Nos1 cre mice. This manipulation abolished both the gastric distension, central, and anorexia effects induced by GLP-1 ii ( Figures 4 I, 4J, and S4 E).
To confirm this mechanism, we assessed the effects of gastric Nos1 Stom ablation on truncal vagotomies, a treatment that equally causes gastroparesis and anorexia. Strikingly, Nos1 Stom ablation abolished truncal vagotomy-induced gastric paresis and distension ( Figure 4 K). Moreover, Nos1 Stom ablation normalized feeding and weight gain parameters in vagotomized mice ( Figures S4 F and S4G; Video S1 ). Thus, Nos1 Stom emerge as obligatory components of the gut circuitry that mediates distension-induced anorexia, including upon gut GLP-1 or vagotomy.

Intra-ileal infusions of GLP-1 induce calcium transients in gastric nNOs+ neurons in vivo , related to Figure 4 Using an abdominal glass window, intravital imaging of nNos+ gastric neurons was performed before and after intra-ileal infusions of GLP-1. GLP-1 infused at T = 0 s. Significant increases in calcium transients are observed after GLP-1 infusion.
We next hypothesized that the chemogenetic activation of Nos1 Stom would mimic GLP-1 ii and L Cell activation. We injected the Cre -dependent excitatory designer construct AAVdj-DIO-Gs-mCherry into the stomach of Nos1 cre mice. We found that CNO injections strongly inhibited gastric contractions ( Figure 4 L), caused marked gastric distension ( Figure 4 M), and reduced eating to ∼50% of baseline levels ( Figures 4 N, S4 H, and S4I), i.e., in vivo effects that mirror those obtained with GLP-1 ii and L Cell activation.
We next predicted symmetrical effects upon performing the same manipulations on excitatory ChAT Stom . AAVdj-DIO-Gs-mCherry was injected into the stomach of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice. Although ChAT Stom activation did not significantly increased stomach contractions ( Figure 4 O), it did abolish both the distension, anorectic, and neuronal effects of GLP-1 ii ( Figures 4 P, 4Q, and S4 J). To confirm that ChAT Stom activation is sufficient to counteract gastric distension, we implanted an intra-gastric balloon in ChAT-IRES-Cre mice to mimic the gastric bloating effects of GLP-1 ii . Although balloon inflation strongly inhibited eating, this effect was entirely abolished by ChAT Stom activation ( Figures 4 R–4T and S4 K–S4N).
Accordingly, we next predicted that ablating ChAT Stom would mimic the distension and anorectic effects of GLP-1 ii . We then injected the caspase3 construct AAV5-flex-taCasp3 into the stomach of ChAT-IRES-Cre mice, which resulted in dramatic gastric distension and ensuing starvation ( Figures 4 U, S4 O, and S4P). These effects were not influenced by celiactomies (as expected, since CG Stom does not innervate ChAT Stom ; Figure S4 O). Overall, these findings show that gastric distension is an essential mediator of the anorectic actions of intestinal GLP-1, as induced via the L Cell → IFN Stom → CG NA−Stom → Nos1 Stom circuitry.
We next aimed at characterizing how GLP-1-induced distension signals may be transmitted to the brain. Both vagal and spinal sensory ganglia innervate the gut and play a role in systemic GLP-1 analog signaling ( Borgmann et al., 2021 7. Borgmann, D. ∙ Ciglieri, E. ∙ Biglari, N. ... Gut-brain communication by distinct sensory neurons differently controls feeding and glucose metabolism Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :1466-1482.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus performed organ-specific sensory ablations of either the vagal or spinal innervation of the stomach. We injected the retrograde, Cre -expressing AAVrg-EGFP-Cre virus into the muscle layers of the stomach of iDTR mice followed by injections of DT either intrathecally (to target stomach-innervating DRGs, DRG Stom ) or into the vagal nodose ganglia (to target stomach-innervating nodose neurons, NG Stom ).
DRG Stom ablation was sufficient to abolish appetite suppression induced by GLP-1 ii ( Figure 5 A). To confirm that these effects derive from sensing gastric distension, we performed additional experiments using intra-gastric balloons. Although control animals ate only ∼10% of their normal meal size when the balloon was inflated, DRG Stom animals ate about ∼70% of their normal meal size (i.e., DRG Stom animals were ∼7 times less sensitive to balloon distension; Figure 5 B).
In contrast, NG Stom ablation failed to affect appetite suppression induced by GLP-1 ii ( Figure 5 C). Similarly, intra-gastric balloon experiments revealed that appetite loss was not affected by vagal sensory denervation ( Figure 5 D). We confirmed these results by injecting NG with cholecystokinin-conjugated saporin, a neurotoxin that specifically ablates gut-innervating NG neurons ( Han and de Araujo, 2021 28. Han, W. ∙ de Araujo, I.E. Dissection and surgical approaches to the mouse jugular-nodose ganglia Star Protoc. 2021; 2 :100474 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). This treatment also failed to prevent balloon inflation-induced anorexia ( Figures S5 A–S5H). Thus, DRG Stom , but not NG Stom , appear essential for brain sensing of GLP-1-induced gastric distension via a L Cell → IFN Stom → CG NA−Stom → Nos1 Stom → DRG Stom pathway.
Finally, we set to determine the pathways via which DRG Stom signals distension to the brain and how appetite suppression is executed. Accordingly, we performed a series of anatomical, electrophysiological, optogenetic, and lesion studies (for details on the approach, see anatomical, electrophysiological, lesion, and optogenetic studies linking spinal transmission from stomach to brain section in STAR Methods ). We found that the lateral reticular formation (LRN), a medullary nucleus involved in decoding proprioceptive spinal signals ( Pivetta et al., 2014 57. Pivetta, C. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Sigrist, M. ... Motor-circuit communication matrix from spinal cord to brainstem neurons revealed by developmental origin Cell. 2014; 156 :537-548 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ), anatomically links DRG Stom to the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTn; Barbier et al., 2020 2. Barbier, M. ∙ Chometton, S. ∙ Pautrat, A. ... A basal ganglia-like cortical-amygdalar-hypothalamic network mediates feeding behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :15967-15976 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ), a lateral hypothalamic region involved in appetite suppression ( Figures 5 E, 5F, 6 A, S5 I–S5O, and S6 A; Table S1 ). A sizable proportion of LRN neurons displayed rapid modulatory changes in firing rates in response to gastric contraction events ( Figures 6 B–6M and S6 B–S6K). LRN is therefore a relay node within an interconnected network linking ileal GLP-1R+ neurons to PSTn VGlut2+ neurons (PSTn VGlut2 ; Figures 7 Aa–7Ag). Consistently, PSTn neurons responded to intestinal GLP-1 ( Figures 7 B–7J, S7 A, and S7B) and encoded for gastric distension volumes ( Figures 7 K–7O, and S7 C). Finally, PSTn VGlut2 neurons are required for the anorectic effects of GLP-1 ii ( Figure 7 P) and, via projections to craniofacial musculatures, control motor programs for food rejection ( Figures 7 Q–7HH and S7 D–S7P; Videos S2 and S3 ).

PSTn controls craniofacial premotor areas of the brainstem to generate bitter-like programs, related to Figure 7 PSTn of VGlut2-ires- Cre mice was transfected with Cre -inducible ChR2, and optical fibers were placed bilaterally immediately above PCRt. Animals were habituated to a head-fixed preparation. Small taste aliquots (0.03 mL) of sweet (e.g., sucralose 2 mM) are infused into the mouth via an intra-oral cannula. Optogenetic stimulation of PSTn→PCRt terminals transformed the rhythmic, ingestive-like oromotor responses to palatable sweet into a bitter-like one; rhythmic movements were abolished and replaced with displays of gaping and limb flailing. In freely moving animals, and in absence of oral stimulation, activation of this pathway caused prototypical taste-aversion reactions, including gapes, chin rubs, forelimb flails, and head shakes (“fictive rejection”).

Section: Discussion

We delineated a novel gut-brain sensorimotor circuit, L Cell → IFN Stom → CG NA−Stom → Nos1 Stom → DRG Stom → LRN T-DRG → PSTn VGlut2 → PCRt → Jaw. This circuit forms an inter-organ neural network that connects the intestine, via the stomach, medullary reticular formation, and hypothalamus to craniofacial muscles. The network enables anorectic gut peptides to elicit food rejection.
One core concept associated with endogenous GLP-1 relates to its presumed role in regulating physiological satiety ( Dailey and Moran, 2013 17. Dailey, M.J. ∙ Moran, T.H. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and appetite Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 24 :85-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, although ileal GLP-1 infusions produced potent appetite-suppressing effects, ileal GLP-1 receptor antagonism failed to augment food intake. This was also the case for each enteric and brain population engaged by ileal GLP-1: Although ablating these neurons rendered GLP-1 infusions completely ineffective, baseline eating patterns were strictly conserved. It is therefore unlikely that endogenous GLP-1—at least the quantities released from non-absorptive segments of the lower intestine—functions to regulate physiological satiation. Instead, intestinal GLP-1 may protect against nutrient malabsorption ( Dailey and Moran, 2013 17. Dailey, M.J. ∙ Moran, T.H. Glucagon-like peptide 1 and appetite Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 24 :85-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ; Drucker, 2018 21. Drucker, D.J. Mechanisms of action and therapeutic application of glucagon-like peptide-1 Cell Metab. 2018; 27 :740-756 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (913) PubMed Google Scholar ; Schirra and Göke, 2005 69. Schirra, J. ∙ Göke, B. The physiological role of GLP-1 in human: incretin, ileal brake or more? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :109-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with a major role for non-absorbing distal gut segments in GLP-1 secretion ( Panaro et al., 2020 55. Panaro, B.L. ∙ Yusta, B. ∙ Matthews, D. ... Intestine-selective reduction of Gcg expression reveals the importance of the distal gut for GLP-1 secretion Mol. Metab. 2020; 37 :100990 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, we found that both ileal GLP-1R antagonism and intestinofugal neuron ablation abolished the ileal brake reflex, an ileal-gastric defensive mechanism triggered by nutrient malabsorption ( Schirra and Göke, 2005 69. Schirra, J. ∙ Göke, B. The physiological role of GLP-1 in human: incretin, ileal brake or more? Regul. Pept. 2005; 128 :109-115 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with the above, recent findings show that GLP-1 levels increase in response to the luminal release of inflammatory and bacterial signals, as well as after induction of intestinal ischemia ( Lebrun et al., 2017 44. Lebrun, L.J. ∙ Lenaerts, K. ∙ Kiers, D. ... Enteroendocrine L cells sense LPS after gut barrier injury to enhance GLP-1 secretion Cell Rep. 2017; 21 :1160-1168 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Now, although our principal aim was to study the neural transduction of GLP-1 released in the distal gut, future experiments involving infusions into the upper intestine may reveal a more specific role for proximal gut GLP-1 release ( Panaro et al., 2020 55. Panaro, B.L. ∙ Yusta, B. ∙ Matthews, D. ... Intestine-selective reduction of Gcg expression reveals the importance of the distal gut for GLP-1 secretion Mol. Metab. 2020; 37 :100990 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) in physiological satiety.
Although GLP-1 has traditionally been considered an incretin ( Schmidt et al., 1985 70. Schmidt, W.E. ∙ Siegel, E.G. ∙ Creutzfeldt, W. Glucagon-like peptide-1 but not glucagon-like peptide-2 stimulates insulin release from isolated rat pancreatic islets Diabetologia. 1985; 28 :704-707 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), its presumed endocrine actions have been challenged ( Burcelin et al., 2009 10. Burcelin, R. ∙ Serino, M. ∙ Cabou, C. A role for the gut-to-brain GLP-1-dependent axis in the control of metabolism Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9 :744-752 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; D’Alessio, 2016 18. D’Alessio, D. Is GLP-1 a hormone: whether and When? J. Diabetes Investig. 2016; 7 :50-55 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vahl et al., 2007 81. Vahl, T.P. ∙ Tauchi, M. ∙ Durler, T.S. ... Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors expressed on nerve terminals in the portal vein mediate the effects of endogenous GLP-1 on glucose tolerance in rats Endocrinology. 2007; 148 :4965-4973 Crossref Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is therefore noticeable that we failed to observe changes in baseline blood glucose levels after ileal GLP-1 infusions. This is in contrast with the conspicuous inhibitory effects of these infusions on gastric motility and eating. Our data are therefore consistent with the notion that the insulinotropic effects of GLP-1 may derive from the peptide’s antimotility properties ( Nauck et al., 1997 54. Nauck, M.A. ∙ Niedereichholz, U. ∙ Ettler, R. ... Glucagon-like peptide 1 inhibition of gastric emptying outweighs its insulinotropic effects in healthy humans Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273 :E981-E988 PubMed Google Scholar ; Tong and D’Alessio, 2014 77. Tong, J. ∙ D’Alessio, D. Give the receptor a brake: slowing gastric emptying by GLP-1 Diabetes. 2014; 63 :407-409 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, the promotility drug erythromycin antagonizes the deceleration of gastric emptying by GLP-1, thereby unveiling its insulinotropic effects ( Meier et al., 2005 49. Meier, J.J. ∙ Kemmeries, G. ∙ Holst, J.J. ... Erythromycin antagonizes the deceleration of gastric emptying by glucagon-like peptide 1 and unmasks its insulinotropic effect in healthy subjects Diabetes. 2005; 54 :2212-2218 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, whereas proglucagon-derived gut peptides do regulate glucose levels, these effects may be motility-dependent since plasma insulin levels following glucose administration remain normal even in the absence of gut-derived GLP-1 ( Song et al., 2019 71. Song, Y. ∙ Koehler, J.A. ∙ Baggio, L.L. ... Gut-proglucagon-derived peptides are essential for regulating glucose homeostasis in mice Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :976-986.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data therefore reinforce the concept that islet GLP-1 may play an important role in regulating glucose homeostasis ( Chambers et al., 2017 14. Chambers, A.P. ∙ Sorrell, J.E. ∙ Haller, A. ... The role of pancreatic preproglucagon in glucose homeostasis in mice Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :927-934.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future experiments combining tissue-specific manipulations of pancreatic preproglucagon ( Chambers et al., 2017 14. Chambers, A.P. ∙ Sorrell, J.E. ∙ Haller, A. ... The role of pancreatic preproglucagon in glucose homeostasis in mice Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :927-934.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ) with intestinal infusions may assist in uncovering the logic underlying GLP-1’s insulinotropic effects.
In our experiments, paresis-induced stomach distension emerged as an obligatory mechanism linking ileal GLP-1 to appetite suppression. Thus, ileal GLP-1 effects were eliminated upon either ablating inhibitory nitric oxide gastric neurons or chemically activating excitatory cholinergic gastric neurons. Conversely, ileal GLP-1 effects were mimicked by either chemically activating nitric oxide, or ablating cholinergic, gastric neurons. Our data thus show that enteric gastric neurons are essential controllers of appetite ( Robinson et al., 1988 66. Robinson, P.H. ∙ McHugh, P.R. ∙ Moran, T.H. ... Gastric control of food intake J. Psychosom. Res. 1988; 32 :593-606 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since previous findings demonstrated a role for nitric oxide in facilitating GLP-1 effects ( Grasset et al., 2017 27. Grasset, E. ∙ Puel, A. ∙ Charpentier, J. ... A specific gut microbiota dysbiosis of type 2 diabetic mice induces GLP-1 resistance through an enteric NO-dependent and gut-brain axis mechanism Cell Metab. 2017; 25 :1075-1090.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rotondo et al., 2011 67.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 relaxes gastric antrum through nitric oxide in mice Peptides. 2011; 32 :60-64 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ), we propose that this mechanism is mediated by a defined subpopulation of Nos1 gastric neurons. Specifically, ileal GLP-1 caused anorexia and stomach distension via intestinofugal-mediated sympathetic reflexes ( Furness, 2006 23. Furness, J.B. Novel gut afferents: intrinsic afferent neurons and intestinofugal neurons Auton. Neurosci. 2006; 125 :81-85 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (66) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hibberd et al., 2020 33.

A novel mode of sympathetic reflex activation mediated by the enteric nervous system eNeuro. 2020; 7 ENEURO.0187-20.2020 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ) that activate gastric nitric oxide neurons. Interestingly, we also found that GLP-1-induced distension signals were conveyed to the brain via spinal ( Spencer et al., 2016 72. Spencer, N.J. ∙ Zagorodnyuk, V. ∙ Brookes, S.J. ... Spinal afferent nerve endings in visceral organs: recent advances Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2016; 311 :G1056-G1063 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), not vagal ( Berthoud et al., 2004 4. Berthoud, H.R. ∙ Blackshaw, L.A. ∙ Brookes, S.J. ... Neuroanatomy of extrinsic afferents supplying the gastrointestinal tract Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2004; 16 :28-33 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ), gastric sensory innervation. This is consistent with the notion that vagal afferents may be relevant for systemic ( Borgmann et al., 2021 7. Borgmann, D. ∙ Ciglieri, E. ∙ Biglari, N. ... Gut-brain communication by distinct sensory neurons differently controls feeding and glucose metabolism Cell Metab. 2021; 33 :1466-1482.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), but not for gut or portal ( Rüttimann et al., 2009 68. Rüttimann, E.B. ∙ Arnold, M. ∙ Hillebrand, J.J. ... Intrameal hepatic portal and intraperitoneal infusions of glucagon-like peptide-1 reduce spontaneous meal size in the rat via different mechanisms Endocrinology. 2009; 150 :1174-1181 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ), GLP-1 sensing. In addition, we uncovered a non-canonical innervation of nitric oxide gastric neurons by sensory ganglia, suggesting that in addition to stretch sensors ( Robinson et al., 1988 66. Robinson, P.H. ∙ McHugh, P.R. ∙ Moran, T.H. ... Gastric control of food intake J. Psychosom. Res. 1988; 32 :593-606 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ), the gut may communicate the motility state of its musculature to the brain via synaptic signaling. Overall, the data point to a dissociation between vagal versus spinal gut-brain pathways that primarily detect rewarding ( Han et al., 2018 29. Han, W. ∙ Tellez, L.A. ∙ Perkins, M.H. ... A neural circuit for gut-induced reward Cell. 2018; 175 :665-678.e623 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (411) PubMed Google Scholar ) versus malabsorption signals, respectively.
Such dissociation between vagal versus spinal systems is unanticipated. As is the case for nutrient sensing, perception of gut tension has historically been attributed to afferent endings of the vagus nerve ( Berthoud and Powley, 1992 5. Berthoud, H.R. ∙ Powley, T.L.

Neural sensing of organ volume Trends Neurosci. 2018; 41 :911-924 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, whereas vagal tension receptors have been suggested to detect stimuli such as distension and contraction of the gut wall, serosal afferents would respond to gut wall elongation ( Berthoud et al., 2004 4. Berthoud, H.R. ∙ Blackshaw, L.A. ∙ Brookes, S.J. ... Neuroanatomy of extrinsic afferents supplying the gastrointestinal tract Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2004; 16 :28-33 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ; Blackshaw et al., 2007 6. Blackshaw, L.A. ∙ Brookes, S.J. ∙ Grundy, D. ... Sensory transmission in the gastrointestinal tract Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2007; 19 :1-19 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, spinal gut afferents have been generally relegated to mediating high-threshold, painful sensations ( Blackshaw et al., 2007 6. Blackshaw, L.A. ∙ Brookes, S.J. ∙ Grundy, D. ... Sensory transmission in the gastrointestinal tract Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 2007; 19 :1-19 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with the current consensus, an intense interest in vagal gut innervation has recently emerged ( Bai et al., 2019 1. Bai, L. ∙ Mesgarzadeh, S. ∙ Ramesh, K.S. ... Genetic identification of vagal sensory neurons that control feeding Cell. 2019; 179 :1129-1143.e23 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2020 42.

Sensory neurons that detect stretch and nutrients in the digestive system Cell. 2016; 166 :209-221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (381) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, a closer examination of gut sensory innervation indicates that vagal nodose ganglia are unlikely to be the sole transducers of gut wall distension. In fact, intestinal segments scantily innervated by the vagus, e.g., the distal colon and rectum, generate graded sensations ranging from fullness to discomfort ( Corsetti et al., 2004 15. Corsetti, M. ∙ Gevers, A.M. ∙ Caenepeel, P. ...

Rectal intraganglionic laminar endings are transduction sites of extrinsic mechanoreceptors in the guinea pig rectum Gastroenterology. 2003; 125 :786-794 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar )—just like the sensations evoked by the vagally innervated stomach. Similar conclusions may be reached from examining other internal organs. For example, the sensation of bladder fullness, a percept comparable to the sensation of stomach distension ( Iggo, 1955 36. Iggo, A. Tension receptors in the stomach and the urinary bladder J. Physiol. 1955; 128 :593-607 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ; Merrill et al., 2016 50. Merrill, L. ∙ Gonzalez, E.J. ∙ Girard, B.M. ... Receptors, channels, and signalling in the urothelial sensory system in the bladder Nat. Rev. Urol. 2016; 13 :193-204 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), is independent of vagal afferent signaling (since the bladder is deprived of vagal terminals; Keast and De Groat, 1992 40. Keast, J.R. ∙ De Groat, W.C. Segmental distribution and peptide content of primary afferent neurons innervating the urogenital organs and colon of male rats J. Comp. Neurol. 1992; 319 :615-623 Crossref Scopus (222) PubMed Google Scholar ; Umans and Liberles, 2018 80. Umans, B.D. ∙ Liberles, S.D. Neural sensing of organ volume Trends Neurosci. 2018; 41 :911-924 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, other well-studied mechanical sensations, such as light and sensual touch, are known to reach brain centers via spinal, not vagal, pathways ( Craig, 2002 16. Craig, A.D. How do you feel? Interoception: the sense of the physiological condition of the body Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3 :655-666 Crossref Scopus (4345) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, spinal sensory neurons are likely major contributors to gastric interoception.
None of the above is meant to imply that vagal afferents fail to play key roles in signaling ileal GLP-1. Consistent with our analyses at baseline states, GLP-1R ablation in Wnt1+ neurons (Wnt1 is an enteric neuron marker; Brokhman et al., 2019 9. Brokhman, I. ∙ Xu, J. ∙ Coles, B.L.K. ... Dual embryonic origin of the mammalian enteric nervous system Dev. Biol. 2019; 445 :256-270 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) failed to affect appetite or gut motility ( Varin et al., 2019 82. Varin, E.M. ∙ Mulvihill, E.E. ∙ Baggio, L.L. ...

However, GLP-1R ablation in Phox2b+ neurons significantly accelerated gastric emptying ( Varin et al., 2019 82. Varin, E.M. ∙ Mulvihill, E.E. ∙ Baggio, L.L. ...

Thus, although the primary function of GLP-1R signaling in ileal enteric neurons may be to trigger the ileal brake reflex, it is plausible that ileum-innervating GLP-1R+ vagal afferents regulate standard feeding ( Brierley et al., 2021 8. Brierley, D.I. ∙ Holt, M.K. ∙ Singh, A. ... Central and peripheral GLP-1 systems independently suppress eating Nat. Metab. 2021; 3 :258-273 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies may explore the physiological function of ileal GLP1R+ sensory fibers by combining site-specific vagal denervation with local GLP-1 infusions.
Finally, we note that different nodes of this novel network may be targeted to ameliorate the appetite loss, belching, and bloating typical of gastroparesis ( Camilleri et al., 2018 12. Camilleri, M. ∙ Chedid, V. ∙ Ford, A.C. ... Gastroparesis Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2018; 4 :41 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this regard, we stress that intestinal GLP-1 effects were independent of GLP-1R expression in the area postrema , a circumventricular area implicated in nausea induced by GLP-1 analogs ( Kanoski et al., 2016 39. Kanoski, S.E. ∙ Hayes, M.R. ∙ Skibicka, K.P. GLP-1 and weight loss: unraveling the diverse neural circuitry Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2016; 310 :R885-R895 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2021 86. Zhang, C. ∙ Kaye, J.A. ∙ Cai, Z. ... Area postrema cell types that mediate nausea-associated behaviors Neuron. 2021; 109 :461-472.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). We conclude that, unlike the case of GLP-1 analog-induced sickness, targeting gut neurons may be essential to halt the anorexia and abdominal bloating associated with gastric paresis. Thus, of therapeutical interest would be employing peripheral neuromodulation approaches to target intestinofugal and gastric neurons for inter-organ control of interoceptive states.
Of note, our intravital imaging approach to enteric neurons made use of lightly anesthetized mice. Different, and certainly more accurate, effects would be obtained if we had used awake animals. Likewise, we have not monitored L cell activity or ileal GLP-1 release in real time. As peripheral neurobiology techniques continue to improve, an important long-term goal is to develop intravital imaging approaches to monitor enteroendocrine and myenteric neurons in behaving animals, especially during feeding.

All mice used in behavioral experiments were individually housed under a 12hr. light/dark cycle. At the time of the behavioral experiments, animals were 12–20 weeks old and weighted approximately 25-28 grams. All animals were used in scientific experiments for the first time. This includes no previous exposure to pharmacological substances or alternative diets. Health status was normal for all animals. Animals used for anatomical tracing studies were group housed and 3 weeks old at the time of injection.
The following provides details on viral and drug injections, catheterizations, denervation, myogram electrode implantation, and optical fiber/high-density probe implantation for each mouse strain (see also Table S2 ). All surgeries were performed in a Biosafety Level 2-approved laboratory. In all cases, preoperative analgesia: 0.05 mg/Kg Buprenorphine ( s.c. ); anesthesia induced by 3% and maintained by 1.5% ∼ 2% Isoflurane; postoperative analgesia: 0.05 mg/Kg Buprenorphine (s.c.) per day for three consecutive days. The surgical areas were shaved and cleaned with iodine soap and wiped with 70% isopropyl alcohol. All incisions were thoroughly disinfected with a layer of Baytril ointment. All surgeries were performed under stereomicroscopes, with animals placed on a heated pad (CMA 450; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). After surgery, animals were allowed to recover under infrared heat until they chose to reside in the unheated side of the cage.
Three week-old mice received one of rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre, rAAV2-retro-hSyn-EGFP, AAV-DJ-hSyn-DIO-rM3D(Gs)-mCherry, AAV-DJ-hSyn-DIO-rM3D(Gi)-mCherry, AAV-DJ-hSyn-DIO-EGFP, AAV1-flex-taCasp3, Mouse IgG-SAP, Anti-DβH-sap, or H129 CMV-EGFP. Animals injected with H129 CAG-LSL-TK-tdTomato were 4-weeks-old, which was one week after they received a viral injection (rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre) in celiac ganglion (see below for details on celiac injections). The abdomen of the animal was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made into the abdomen. The stomach or ileum (about 5 cm proximal to ileocaecal valve) were exteriorized through the midline incision. The viral constructs or chemicals were loaded into a Nanofil™ 36G beveled needle (WPI, Sarasota, FL) and Silflex™ tubing (WPI, Sarasota, FL), connected to a Nanofil™ 10μl syringe (WPI, Sarasota, FL) and mounted on a Pump 11 Elite Nanomite (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Multiple 30nL injections were made at 10nL/s into each submucosal puncture. The needle tip was carefully manipulated to avoid mesenteric blood vessels. After completing the infusions, needle was left in place for 5s before extraction to ensure full absorption. Each animal received a total volume of 1μL. Sterile suture was then applied to the skin.
Mice injected with unconjugated saporin (Blank-SAP) or cholecystokinin-conjugated saporin (CCK-SAP) were 3 weeks old. Animals injected with AAV5-Ef1a-DIO EYFP, H129 CAG-LSL-TK-tdTomato, or diphtheria toxin were 4-weeks-old, which was one week after they received a gastric viral injection (rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre or rAAV2-retro-hSyn-EGFP) as described above. Nodose ganglia injections were performed as described previously ( Han and de Araujo, 2021 28. Han, W. ∙ de Araujo, I.E. Dissection and surgical approaches to the mouse jugular-nodose ganglia Star Protoc. 2021; 2 :100474 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a ventral midline incision was made along the length of the neck; submandibular glands were retracted along with sternohyoid and omohyoid muscles to expose the trachea and carotid artery. The vagus nerve was separated from the carotid artery with a Spinal Cord Hook (FST, Foster City, CA) until the nodose ganglion became accessible. Viral or chemical aliquots were loaded into a Nanofil™ 36G beveled needle (WPI, Sarasota, FL) and Silflex™ tubing (WPI, Sarasota, FL). For each nodose ganglion, a total of 500nL volume of virus was delivered at 50nL/min using a Nanofil™ 10μl syringe (WPI, Sarasota, FL) mounted on a Pump 11 Elite Nanomite (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Sterile suture was then applied to the skin.
Animals injected with either rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre or rAAV2-retro-hSyn-EGFP were 3-weeks-old. Animals injected with one of AAV-DJ-hSyn-DIO-rM3D(Gs)-mCherry, AAV-DJ-hSyn-DIO-EGFP, AAV1-flex-taCasp3, AAV1-synP-FLEX-splitTVA-EGFP-B19G, EnvA G-Deleted Rabies-mCherry, or H129 CAG-LSL-TK-tdTomato, were 4-weeks-old, which was one week after they received a gastric viral injection (rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre) as described above. The abdomen of the animal was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made into the abdomen. The stomach was exteriorized through the midline incision. The stomach fundus was pulled towards the liver to expose the left and right celiac ganglia. Viral aliquots were loaded into a Silflex™ tubing (WPI, Sarasota, FL) connected with a Nanofil™ 36G beveled needle (WPI, Sarasota, FL). The needle tip was gently inserted into the ganglion, which was supported in place with a cotton tip. For each celiac ganglion, a total of 500nL volume of virus was delivered at 50nL/min using a Nanofil™ 10μl syringe (WPI, Sarasota, FL) mounted on a Pump 11 Elite Nanomite (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Sterile suture was then applied to the skin.
Animals injected with H129 CAG-LSL-TK-tdTomato were 4-weeks-old, which was one week after they received a gastric viral injection (rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre) as described above.
The back skin was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made with a scalpel. The skin was retracted aside. The trapezius, rhomboid and latissimus muscles were separated from the spinal cord with a periosteal elevator (GerVetUSA, Albertson, NY). The vertebrae at thoracic levels T8 through T10 were exposed using a Mini-Goldstein Retractors (FST, Foster City, CA). The vertebrae were secured with a Mouse Spinal Adaptor and Transverse Clamp (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). The lamina and pedicle were gently grinded with a micro drill (WPI, Sarasota, FL). Once DRGs were exposed and visualized, viral aliquots (H129 CAG-LSL-TK-tdTomato) were delivered using a NanofilTM 36G beveled needle connected to Silflex™ tubing (WPI, Sarasota, FL). For each DRG, a total of 500nL volume of virus was delivered at 50nL/min using a Nanofil™ 10μl syringe (WPI, Sarasota, FL) mounted on a Pump 11 Elite Nanomite (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Sterile suture was then applied to muscle and skin.
Animals at the time of intrathecal injection were 4-week-old, which was one week after they received a gastric viral injection (rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre) as described above. The back skin was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made with a scalpel. After retracting the skin aside, the lumbar vertebrae were exposed. A NanofilTM 36G beveled needle connected to Silflex™ tubing (WPI, Sarasota, FL) was carefully inserted into the groove between the L5 and L6 vertebrae. A total of 5μl volume of Diphtheria Toxin was delivered at 1μL/min using a Nanofil™ 100μl syringe (WPI, Sarasota, FL) mounted on a Pump 11 Elite Nanomite (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Sterile suture was then applied to skin.
Animals at the time of intrathecal injection were 3-week-old. The abdomen was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made into the abdomen. The stomach was exteriorized through the midline incision. The stomach fundus was pulled towards the liver to expose the celiac ganglion. The celiac ganglion was carefully separated away from the celiac artery with a miniature forceps (FST, Foster City, CA). The base of the celiac ganglion was ligated before resection. Sterile suture was then applied to skin.
Animals at the time of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy were 3-week-old. The abdomen was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made into the abdomen. The liver and stomach were retracted aside to expose the esophagus. The branches of the vagus nerves innervating the stomach were carefully separated from both the esophagus and the left gastric artery and were bilaterally severed with an electrical cauterizer. A viral aliquot of H129 CMV-EGFP was then injected as described above. Sterile suture was then applied to muscle and skin.
To demonstrate the existence of an ileal-sympathetic-gastric circuitry, we injected the retrograde, Cre -expressing virus AAV2-retro-hSyn.HI.EGFP-Cre virus into the muscle layers of the stomach, concomitant to injections into CG of the Cre -inducible construct AAV1-synP-FLEX-splitTVA-EGFP-B19G, which expresses the rabies virus replication G factor. Three weeks later, we injected the Cre -dependent, G factor-deficient monosynaptic rabies virus EnvA-ΔG-Rabies-mCherry into CG. This, by definition, specifically mapped inputs to CG Stom . To ablate CG Stom noradrenergic (sympathetic) neurons (“CG NA-Stom ”) in vivo , we targeted the stomach with the immunotoxin anti-DβH–saporin, a compound that acts to specifically ablate noradrenaline cells via retrograde uptake ( Milstein et al., 2007 51. Milstein, J.A. ∙ Lehmann, O. ∙ Theobald, D.E. ... Selective depletion of cortical noradrenaline by anti-dopamine beta-hydroxylase-saporin impairs attentional function and enhances the effects of guanfacine in the rat Psychopharmacol. (Berl.). 2007; 190 :51-63 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). For activating CG Stom neurons using chemogenetics, we injected the construct AAV2-retro-hSyn.HI.EGFP-Cre into the stomach, followed by injections of the Cre -dependent excitatory construct AAV-DJ-hSyn-DIO-rM3D(Gs)-mCherry into CG Stom (while sparing the superior mesenteric ganglion).
Animals at the time of gastric fistulae surgeries were 8-week-old. The abdomen was shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made into the abdomen. The stomach was exteriorized through the midline incision and a purse string suture was placed in the fundus. A Female Luer (1/4" ID, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) was inserted and closed by the purse string suture. The rectus abdominis and abdomen skin were closed and sutured across the luer. The matching Male Luer Lock (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) was rotated and tightened to the luer end.
Animals at the time of gastric balloon implantation were 8-week-old. The abdomen and dorsal back skin of the animal were shaved and cleaned. A midline incision was made into the abdomen. The stomach was exteriorized through the midline incision and a purse string suture was placed in the fundus. The collar of a mouse jugular vein catheter (1 to 3Fr, fit 22 Ga, Instech laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was sealed to a latex balloon (Size 4, 0.06ML, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The balloon was then inserted into the stomach lumen. The purse string was tightened around the tubing, which was then tunneled subcutaneously to the dorsum via a small hole made into the abdominal muscle. A small incision to the dorsum between the shoulder plates was then made to allow for catheter exteriorization. Sterile suture was then applied to the abdominal incisions.
Animals at the time of gastric electromyogram probe implant were 8-week-old. Two twisted Formvar-Insulated Nichrome Wires (Diameter: Bare 0.002 inch. A-M system) were covered with polyethylene tubing (PE20, 0.15” x 0.45”, Braintree scientific). The tips of the nichrome wires were bared and exposed. One bare wire tip was soldered to a Male Miniature Pin Connector (520200, A-M Systems). The other bare wire tip was inserted through a 30G needle, and the tip bent and used for the implants into the stomach. For implants, preoperative analgesia consisted of 5mg/Kg Carprofen, anesthetic was 2% Isoflurane throughout and postoperative analgesia, 30mg/Kg Ibuprofen. The skin of the upper abdomen was shaved and open to expose the underlying musculature. The needle was then used for insertion of the wire into the stomach via a small hole made into the abdominal muscle, with the bare wire hooked into the stomach. A suture was used to fix the wire in place. To verify the efficacy of the recordings, at the end of each session animals were administered the gut motility-inducing drug metroclopramide hydrochloride (10mg/kg i.p.). Recordings were performed using the electromyogram module of a multichannel acquisition processor (Tucker-Davis Technologies, 3052Hz sampling rate). The male pin connector was attached to the female connector, which had been soldered to a recording headstage. Laser pulses timestamps were synchronized to the recordings via external TTL pulses into the TDT system. The dorsal neck skin was then closed with sterile suture.
Animals at the time of experiments were 8-week-old. The abdomen and dorsal back skin of the animal were shaved and cleaned. A small incision to the dorsal neck, and a midline incision into the abdomen, were made. The ileum was exteriorized through the midline incision. A purse string suture was placed on the ileal wall at 5cm proximal to ileocaecal valve, into which the tip of MicroRenathane tubing (0.025", Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) was inserted. The purse string was tightened around the tubing, which was then tunneled subcutaneously to the dorsum via a small hole made into the abdominal muscle. A small incision to the dorsum between the shoulder plates was then made to allow for catheter exteriorization. The abdominal incision was then closed with sterile suture. All infusates (CCK-8 10ng/Kg, GLP-1 10, 50, 100nMol/Kg, Exendin-4 10ng/kg, 20% Intralipid [0.5% body weight]), bile salts (5mg/mice, 0.5% body weight) were freshly prepared with sterile saline and 0.1mL infused at 0.1mL/minute.
Previous assessments of GLP-1 concentrations in the mouse gut estimate ileal concentrations at ∼50pmol/g GLP-1 (e.g., Paternoster and Falasca, 2018 56. Paternoster, S. ∙ Falasca, M. Dissecting the physiology and pathophysiology of glucagon-like peptide-1 Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2018; 9 :584 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). According to our measurements, the total mass of the ileum of a 30g mouse is approximately 0.1g. Thus, approximately, each animal has ∼16.5ng of ileal GLP-1. Assuming ∼10-15% of released GLP-1 reaches circulation ( Holst, 2007 34. Holst, J.J. The physiology of glucagon-like peptide 1 Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87 :1409-1439 Crossref Scopus (2498) PubMed Google Scholar ), we decided to infuse ∼12% of the estimated total concentration (i.e., 2ng/30g mouse or 20pMol/Kg). In a 30g mouse, this corresponds to 25×10 -4 of a GLP-1 dose that is effective intra-peritoneally (e.g., Jessen et al., 2012 38. Jessen, L. ∙ Aulinger, B.A. ∙ Hassel, J.L. ... Suppression of food intake by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: relative potencies and role of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 Endocrinology. 2012; 153 :5735-5745 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our initial tests indeed showed that this dose, when injected into the mouse ileal lumen, induces significant decreases in gastric contractions as well as gastric distension. We also produced a dose-response analysis which is shown in Figure S1 I. Based on the above verifications, we applied 20pMol/Kg for all short-term tests ( in vivo electrophysiology and intravital ileal confocal microscopy) and 50pMol/Kg (25pMol/Kg twice per hour) for longer-term food intake tests, thereby minimizing dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 cleavage.
We thus stress that the dose selected conservatively approximates increases in serum concentrations of GLP-1 observed in humans following a meal ( Vilsboll et al., 2001 83. Vilsbøll, T. ∙ Krarup, T. ∙ Deacon, C.F. ... Reduced postprandial concentrations of intact biologically active glucagon-like peptide 1 in type 2 diabetic patients Diabetes. 2001; 50 :609-613 Crossref Scopus (761) PubMed Google Scholar ), or following duodenal infusion of lipids ( Layer et al., 1995 43. Layer, P. ∙ Holst, J.J. ∙ Grandt, D. ... Ileal release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Association with inhibition of gastric acid secretion in humans Dig. Dis. Sci. 1995; 40 :1074-1082 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). In these studies, resting plasma concentrations of GLP-1 were between 10-20 pMol/liter, and increased to a peak of 30-60pMol/liter within 60 minutes of meal feeding or lipid infusion. In mice, a slightly smaller magnitude increase in plasma GLP-1 is observed following oral administration of glucose: an increment of ∼15pMol/liter ( Windelov et al., 2017 85. Windeløv, J.A. ∙ Wewer Albrechtsen, N.J. ∙ Kuhre, R.E. ... Why is it so difficult to measure glucagon-like peptide-1 in a mouse? Diabetologia. 2017; 60 :2066-2075 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). We made the conservative assumption that systemic GLP-1 signaling may occur despite mechanisms of rapid degradation, i.e., we do not exclude the possibility of minimal degradation between infusion and the initiation of physiological signaling. Thus, our studies demonstrating the sufficiency of ileal GLP-1R+ enteric neurons in mediating intestinal GLP-1 effects were conservatively designed as they do not exclude the possibility that GLP-1 may act extra-intestinally.
Animals at the time of were 8-week-old. The face of the animal was shaved and cleaned. A small incision at the dorsal back skin and a small incision into the oral mucosa, at the junction between the inframargin of the masseter and the supramargin of the mandible, was made. A MicroRenathane tubing (0.025", Braintree Scientific, Braintree, MA) was inserted into the oral cavity with a purse string tightened around. The tubing was then tunneled subcutaneously to the dorsum and exteriorized.
For intravital confocal imaging of calcium transients in gastric and ileal neurons, we generated Glp1r-ires-Cre×Ai148D (Cre-dependent GCaMP6f), B6J.ChAT-ires-Cre×Ai148D, or injected the Cre-inducible construct AAV1-syn-FLEX-jGCaMP8m into the stomach corpus of 3-week-old Nos1 cre animals. These injections were needed as it appeared that Nos1 cre ×Ai148D were not viable. When 6-week-old, the animals received the ileal catheterization as above, followed by a gastric or ileal window placement for intravital confocal microscopy, as previously described ( Rakhilin et al., 2019 62. Rakhilin, N. ∙ Garrett, A. ∙ Eom, C.Y. ... An intravital window to image the colon in real time Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :5647 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a round cover slip (ø15 mm, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) was glued (Ultra Gel Control, Loctite, Hartford, CT) between a 12x 24x1.5 mm stainless steel fender washer and a custom 13x14x1.5 mm polypropylene ring. A purse string suture was placed on the incision edge between the Rectus abdominis and the abdominal skin. The distal ileum (3 cm distal to the ileocaecal valve) or stomach were exteriorized through the midline incision and gently folded and placed to maximize the field of view through the cover glass. Drops of Low Toxicity Silicone Adhesive (KWIK-SIL, WPI, Sarasota, FL) were carefully applied to the outer surface of the distal ileum before being attached to the cover glass. Then, the ileum was gently pushed back into the abdominal cavity. The purse string suture was tightened to the groove of the customized titanium ring. Animals were under continuous 1.5% Isoflurane anesthesia. Calcium imaging was performed using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a 10× objective lens. Upon visualizing GCaMP6f or jGCaMP8m-expressing neurons, continuous imaging series were acquired at 4 frames/sec with FOV=2.25mm 2 . After a corresponding 10 minutes-long baseline period, 0.1mL of 20nMol/Kg GLP-1 was infused via the ileal catheter at 0.1mL/min, after which a 20 minutes-long post-GLP-1 image series was recorded.
Gcg-ires-Cre×Ai32 and Ai32 animals were implanted with abdominal glass windows over the ileal region. Under continuous 1.5% Isoflurane anesthesia, animals were mounted over a horizontally rotating (30 rpm) platform. A 70mW 480nm laser was placed 3mm away from the intravital ileal window, and activated at 1Hz. One hour after the stimulation, the intravital window has quickly detached. Distal ileum and connected mesenteric membrane were ligated, dissected and weighed before immediately placed into liquid nitrogen. Animals were later transcardially perfused for anatomy analysis. Unfrozen ileum tissue was dissected by scissor and abrader. For assessing depletion of GLP-1 from L-Cells after laser stimulation: Centrifuged supernatant extracts containing GLP-1 were measured using an ELISA kit (Abcam, ab229413, Human GLP-1 (7-36) CatchPoint SimpleStep ELISA® Kit). The signals were recorded by a Molecular Devices’ plate reader (SpectraMax M3) supported by SoftMaxPro software. The excitation value was set as530nm; the emission value was set as 590 nm; and the cutoff value was set as 570 nm. The tissue GLP-1 concentration was determined by analyzing the standard curve.
Animals at the time of injections were 8-week-old. A small incision was made on the cheek to expose either masseter muscle or the parotid gland. A small incision was made to the submandibula to expose the digastric muscle. Viral aliquots (PRV-CMV-EGFP Ba-152) were delivered to either the masseter, digastric, glossal, or parotid gland with a NanofilTM 36G beveled needle connected to SilflexTM tubing (WPI, Sarasota, FL). For each target, a total of 200nL volume of virus was delivered at 50nL/min using a NanofilTM 10μl syringe (WPI, Sarasota, FL) mounted on a Pump 11 Elite Nanomite (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The skin was then closed with sterile suture.
Animals at the time of were 8-week-old. Cannulae for intracerebroventricular infusions were obtained from Plastics One (Roanoke, VA). GLP-1 (2μg/mL) was freshly prepared in aCSF (used as vehicle control) and infused into the 4th ventricle over the Area Postrema at AP =7.5 mm, ML = ±0 mm DV = -4.5 mm, total of 1μL (2ng GLP-1), at 0.1μL/min. Infusions took place 5 minutes before the 1h-long food intake tests.
Animals at the time of surgery were 8-week-old. Injections were performed with a Hamilton 1.0μL Neuros Model 7001KH syringe, at a rate of 20nL/min. In what follows, and for each mouse strain, we first list the viral construct injected, then the relevant stereotaxic coordinates for the injections are described. When applicable, the optical fibers were implanted 0.3 mm above the viral injection coordinate immediately after the infusion was accomplished bilaterally. Optical fibers were obtained from Doric Lenses, Canada. Stereotaxic coordinates are with respect to bregma , according to a standardized atlas of the mouse brain (Keith Franklin & George Paxinos, The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates , Compact 3rd Edition, Academic Press, 2008).

Three-week-old CAG-Sun1/sfGFP mice received an intra-celiac viral injection as described above (rAAV2-retro.hSyn.Cre). Two weeks later, the mice were perfused with heparin (10mU/L) saline. The ileum was dissected out and thoroughly rinsed after separation of the mesentery tissue and removal of luminal contents. The ileum was gently rubbed in an ice-cold dissection solution (ice-cold DMEM:F12 (1:1) supplemented with 1% pen/strep and 12.5 mM d-glucose) in order to remove most of the mucosa. The intact myenteric tissue was then disaggregated and sliced with fine tip scissors in an ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer containing 73mM NaCl (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. AM9759), 5mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 15567027), 0.5mM CaCl2 (VWR, catalog no. 97062-820), 10.5mM MgCl2 (Sigma–Aldrich, catalog no. M1028), and 0.5% CHAPS (Millipore) for 10 minutes. Large debris were removed with a 40μm strainer (Falcon). The homogenate was spun at 1000g for 8 min at 4°C, the precipitate washed once and resuspended in 500ml 1% PBS-diluted BSA. Dissociated nuclei were then treated with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, 1:1000) and anti-NeuN-Alexa Fluor 647 antibody (Abcam, 1:500, ab190565, clone EPR12763) for 15 min on ice. Stained nuclei were then washed and resuspended in 1% PBS-diluted BSA for FACS sorting using a Miltenyi Tyto microfluidic sorter (Miltenyi Biotec). The IFN nuclei (Hoechst + NeuN + GFP + ) and the non-IFN enteric neuronal nuclei (Hoechst + NeuN + GFP – ) were separated into different 1.5 ml EP tubes. 5μL of isolated nuclei were assessed under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon) for GFP positive enrichment. The total RNA from the sorted enteric nuclei were extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen). The RNA reverse transcription and the real-time PCR were performed by Quintara Biosciences Co. (Boston, USA). The real-time PCR primers used for GLP1R gene were designed as follows: 1) GLP1R-Forward: CGGAGTGTGAAGAGTCTAAGCG 2) GLP1R-Reverse: ATGGCTGAAGCGATGACCAAGG.
The real-time PCR primers used for Actb gene were designed as follows: 1) Actb-Forward: CATTGCTGACAGGATGCAGAAGG; 2) Actb-Reverse: TGCTGGAAGGTGGACAGTGAGG.
Mice were deeply anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mix (400 mg ketamine + 20 mg xylazine kg body weight −1 I.P.). All animals were perfused with filtered saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Following perfusion, brains were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and then moved to a 20% sucrose solution in 0.02 M potassium phosphatebuffer (KPBS, pH 7.4) for 2 days. Brains were then frozen and cut into four series 40μm sections with a sliding microtome equipped with a freezing stage. To identify fiber and electrode locations, relevant sections were identified and mounted on slides. Sections were then photographed under bright field and fluorescence. For Herpes Simplex Viruses visualization, 3 or 4 or 5 days after viral injection, mice were perfused, and brains cut at 40μm. The mCherry signal was amplified with Rabbit-anti-mCherry (Abcam, ab167453, 1:500) followed by TRITC-conjugated affinipure Goat anti-Rabbit (IgG (H+L) 111-025-144, Jackson Immuno, 1:200). The EYFP signal was amplified with Goat anti-GFP antibody (FITC), (ab6662, Abcam, 1:500) followed by Alexa Fluor® 594 AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit (IgG (H+L), 111-585-103, Jackson Immuno, 1:200).
Fos immunoreactivity was used to determine the effects of chemogenetic, intra-ileal infusions, and intra-gastric balloons, on neuronal activity. Ninety minutes after the appropriate stimulation, mice were sacrificed and perfused as described above. To visualize Fos immunoreactivity, either the ABC/DAB procedure or immunofluorescence was used. Briefly, brain sections were incubated with Rabbit Anti-c-Fos antibody (Rabbit Anti-c-Fos ab190289, 1:1000), followed with Biotinylated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody (BA-1000, Vector Laboratories, 1:500), then reacted with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (“ABC” method, Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, 1:200). A nickel diaminobenzidine (Nickel-DAB) glucose oxidase reaction was used to visualize Fos-like immunoreactive cells. To visualize Fos via immunofluorescence, slices were incubated with Rabbit Anti-c-Fos antibody (Rabbit Anti-c-Fos ab190289, 1:1000), followed by FITC-conjugated affinipure goat anti-rabbit (IgG (H+L) 111-095-144, Jackson Immuno, 1:200). Fos expression was analyzed and quantified as follows: Coronal sections at ∼160μm intervals were photographed at 10× magnification and montaged with ImageJ to preserve anatomical landmarks. Fos+ neurons in each section were detected and counted using ImageJ and expressed as the cumulative sum of Fos+ neurons within the relevant regions for each animal.
Whole tissue clearing as described previously ( Renier et al., 2014 64. Renier, N. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Simon, D.J. ... iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging Cell. 2014; 159 :896-910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1075) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, animals were anesthetized and perfused with saline and 1%PFA. The celiac ganglia or gut tissue were dissected, opened, and cleaned in a 1%PFA solution. Attached connective tissues were removed, and for gut the tissue was flattened on a glass plate. After 24h fixation with 4% PFA at 4°C, tissues were washed with PBS for 1hr x 3 times. Tissues were then dehydrated at room temperature in a series of methanol/B1n solutions (20%, 40%,60%,80%,100%,100%), 30 min for each concentration. After delipidation (DiChloroMethane, overnight) and discoloration (10% H 2 O 2 /methanol, overnight) at 4°C, tissues were rehydrated at room temperature in a series of methanol/B1n solutions (80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 0%, 0%), 30 min for each concentration. Tissues were transferred into a PTxwH solution with 1:1000 primary antibody and vibrated in an incubator at 37°C for 72hs. After thoroughly washed with PTxwH solution for 48hs, tissues were shaken in 1:500 secondary antibody PTxwH solution for 72hs and then washed out for 48hs. Each tissue was next imbedded with a mixture of dichloromethane (Sigma)/methanol (2 volumes/1 volume) for 3hr, and then with 100% dichloromethane for 15 min, twice. The tissue was then transferred to a cover-glass bottomed chamber and then finally cleared with 100% dibenzyl-ether (Sigma) for 1hr twice and prepared for confocal imaging.
Förster (fluorescent) resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based confocal microscopy was employed to assess the diffusion of GLP-1 infused into ileum. FRET generates fluorescence signals sensitive to separation within the 1–10nm range ( Jares-Erijman and Jovin, 2003 37. Jares-Erijman, E.A. ∙ Jovin, T.M. FRET imaging Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21 :1387-1395 Crossref Scopus (1687) PubMed Google Scholar ). We infused the ileum with a synthetic GLP-1[7-36] containing a biotin label at the N-terminus. Cleavage by DPP-4 would thus separate the two biotin-conjugated amino acids from the C-extended remaining if the peptide. A monoclonal FTIC anti-Biotin antibody was used to detect N-terminal-conjugated biotin. To detect the C-extended portion of GLP1[7-36], a polyclonal Rabbit-anti-GLP1 antibody and a secondary Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG antibody. We therefore used the energy transfer principle of FRET to detect forms of the peptide in which the donor (N-terminal biotin) was separated from the C-terminally extended GLP-1[7-36] (acceptor) by less than 10nm (i.e., non-cleaved forms of GLP-1[7-36]). Images were acquired using a confocal Leica TCS SP8 STED 3X. FRET signals thus represent the distribution of full-length, un-cleaved biotin-conjugated GLP1[7-36]. Note that FRET signals do not include endogenous GLP-1 (since it is not conjugated to biotin). Within 15min of injections into ileum, mice were perfused, the ileum was isolated and prepared into 5μm frozen sections. The sections were then incubated with the GLP1[7-36] primary antibody, the Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibody, and the FITC anti-Biotin antibody. To assess FRET donor-only scattering, donor control sections were incubated only with the anti-Biotin–FITC antibody. To assess FRET acceptor-only scattering, acceptor control sections were incubated only with the GLP1 antibody and the Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibody. To compute FRET indexes, we employed the ImageJ FRET and Colocalization Analyzer plugin (1 st version). FRET indexes represent the levels of energy transfer associated with changes in the donor-acceptor configurations. Detectable high values of FRET indexes were then interpreted as indexing the tissue distribution of intact forms of the biotin-conjugated GLP1[7-36] peptide.
Ten days before the recording session, a titanium headplate was secured to the skull with loctite 401 and dental cement, and a stainless-steel ground screw is implanted over the cerebellum. Muscles over the occipital bones are depressed, and a halo of dental cement is placed encircling a kwik-sil window over the occipital sutures, and Lambda is marked. Animals recovered for 3 days after implanting the headplate. Following recovery, animals were habituated to head restraint, for 3-5 days. Next, a twisted pair of EMG wires was implanted into the greater curvature of stomach corpus, or near antrum, like the procedures described above. All EMG recordings were performed in awake, non-fasted animals. Briefly, 50μM formvar insulation nichrome wires (A-M systems) are striped of insulation over a 0.5mm length, a pair of these wires is aligned with a silicon stop glued about 1mm from the contact points, and the contact points are spaced about 1mm from each other. Wires are crimped to a 30G needle to facilitate quick placement during surgery. In the same procedure, the silicon balloon was implanted into the stomach. Two days after this surgery, the recording session was performed. Under isoflurane anesthesia, with buprenorphan analgesic, a craniotomy was performed, the dura matter carefully pierced with tungsten dissecting needles. To prevent the exposed brain from drying, mineral oil or FC-70 was layered over the craniotomy. To minimize drift, a custom fabricated steel holder is used to hold a silicon probe (Neuronexus). The PCB shaft of the probe was superglued to the holder, ensuring alignment of the axis of movement to the axis of the silicon shank. The probe holder was carried by a Sutter MP-285 manipulator, and slowly lowered (2-5μm/sec) through cerebellum or subthalamus to the recording region (respectively LRN or PSTn). The more anterior portion of LRN was targeted for recording, nominal coordinates relative to Lambda: AP 7.5 ML, ±1.5, DV 5.5-6. For PSTn, AP- 2.4, ML, ±1.1, DV -4.85. Electrophysiological landmarks were used to guide the recording depth. After lowering the recording probe, anesthesia was withdrawn, the probe allowed to stabilize for 10-15 minutes. Three to five trials of balloon inflation were performed, spaced 5 minutes apart. In each trial balloon volume is ramped from up to 700μL over a 40 second period, and then deflated at the same rate.
A custom-built integrated system was used to simultaneously acquire electromyogram, intraballoon pressure, single unit, and high-speed video records from head-fixed mice. Our system synchronizes the records to a master sample clock running at 24 kHz on a TDT RZ5 (Tucker-Davis Technology). Single unit activity of regions of interest were recorded with NeuroNexus 16 channel silicon probes, with the recording sites arranged in 4 sets of tetrodes. To reduce crosstalk from neck, masseter, and shoulder muscles, a common average is computed across all the recording sites, scaled, and then subtracted from each site. Whenever an exceptionally large single unit is present on all channels of a tetrode, this strategy is adjusted to compute sets of common averages, thereby preventing background subtraction artifacts. Discontinuous recordings are triggered by negative going peaks exceeding a threshold of 5.5 standard deviations of the background subtracted noise, digitized at 24 kHz. Units were sorted using OfflineSorter (Plexon). Differential EMG signals were measured using custom fabricated twisted pairs of 50-micron nichrome wire, with a design adapted from Keir Pearson, and miniaturized to reduce discomfort. EMGs were amplified and digitized on the RZ5 system at 8kHz. Video recordings were performed at 100 fps using a basler aca1300-60gm, with the IR cut filter removed. Hardware triggers were generated every 244th tick of the master sample clock of the TDT RZ5, ensuring that the video recordings can be aligned with the single unit and EMG data.
The coronal slices containing the hypothalamic parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTn) expressing AAV5-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP were prepared from VGlut2 mice. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated. Then brains were rapidly removed and immersed in cold (40°C) and oxygenated high-sucrose solution containing (mM): sucrose 220, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.23, NaHCO3 26, CaCl21, MgCl2 6 and glucose 10, pH 7.3 with NaOH). After being trimmed to a small tissue block containing the PBN, coronal slices (300 μm thick) were cut on a vibratome and maintained at room temperature (23-25 o C) in a holding chamber with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (bubbled with 5% CO 2 and 95% O 2 ) containing (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 3, CaCl 2 2, MgCl 2 2, NaH 2 PO 4 1.23, NaHCO 3 26, glucose 10, pH 7.4 with NaOH for recovery and storage. After recovery at room temperature for at least one hour, slices were transferred to a recording chamber constantly perfused with ACSF at a temperature of 33 o C and a perfusion rate of 2 ml/min for electrophysiological experiments. Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed in YFP-positive neurons in the parabrachial area under both voltage and current clamp. Micropipettes (3-4 MΩ) were made of borosilicate glass (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with a Sutter P-97 micropipette puller and back filled with a pipette solution containing (mM): K-gluconate 135, MgCl 2 2, HEPES 10, EGTA 1.1, Mg-ATP 2.5, Na 2 -GTP 0.3, and Na 2 -phosphocreatin 10, pH 7.3 with KOH. Both input resistance and series resistance were monitored throughout the experiments and the former was partially compensated. Only recordings with stable series resistance and input resistance were accepted. To stimulate neurons with an optogenetic method, an LED-generated blue light pulses at different frequencies (5, 10 and 20 Hz) were applied to recorded neurons. All data were sampled at 3-10 kHz, filtered at 3 kHz and analyzed with an Apple Macintosh computer using Axograph X (AxoGraph).
In all studies involving intra-intestinal infusions, mice were single-caged, and food restricted, having access to 2.5g chow/day. This procedure allowed animals to maintain >90% of regular body weight. Experiments were performed daily, at the beginning of the dark cycle (7PM). One condition (i.e., one intestinal infusion followed by food intake) was performed on a given experimental day. Experiments were performed over consecutive days starting exactly at the same time (7PM). First, animals were placed under light isoflurane anesthesia and infused with saline or an experimental substance (one of GLP-1, Ex-4, cholic acid, CNO, Ex9-39, 20%Intralipid). The volume infused was always 50μL over 10sec. Five minutes after the injections, animals were allowed ad libitum access to chow and, after 1hour, the remaining pellets were removed and weighted. For Fos studies, an identical procedure was adopted, but in this case no food intake was allowed after the injections, with animals perfused 90 minutes after the administration of the injections.
Behavioral experiments were conducted in either one of three identical mouse behavior chambers enclosed in a ventilated and sound-attenuating cubicle (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT). Each chamber is equipped with two slots for sipper tubing placements, at symmetrical locations on one of the cage walls. All sippers are connected to a contact-based licking detection device allowing for measurements of licking responses with 10ms resolution. All lick timestamps were saved in a computer file for posterior analysis. Software controlled lasers and infusion pumps equipped with TTL input devices were connected to the behavioral chambers and programmed to automatically trigger intra-intestinal infusions in response to the detection of licks. MED-PC IV (Med Associates) was used as the platform for programming all experiments.
Mice were tested for learned avoidance to either intra-ileal GLP-1 or chemogenetic activation of celiac neurons. In each conditioning session, animals licked one of two different flavors available from one sipper. Flavors were blueberry or cherry flavors, 2g of Totally Light Drink Mix into 200mL of pre-prepared 1mM sucralose solution. For GLP-1 conditioning, each conditioning session was followed by either an intra-ileal/ventricular GLP-1 injection for one flavor or intra-ileal saline/intra-ventricular CSF for the other flavor. For celiac activation conditioning, each conditioning session was followed by either an intra-peritoneal injection of Clozapine-N-Oxide (1mg/kg, EnZo Life Sciences) for one flavor or intra-peritoneal saline for the other flavor. Conditioning sessions lasted for 1 hour and were performed for 4 consecutive days under food (16h) deprivation, alternating daily the flavor identities. Thus, there were 2 sessions associated with each specific flavor-stimulus pair. Flavor assignments were balanced across conditions and animals. To assess conditioned aversion, short-term (5 min) two-bottle preference tests between the two distinct flavors were performed before and following the conditioning sessions. These tests were performed in extinction. Short duration of this test aims to minimize postingestive influences. After conditioning, an identical test was performed to assess the formation of flavor preferences. The number of licks for each Flavor was recorded and used to calculate the preference ratio as follows: P r e f e r e n c e r a t i o f o r 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 1 = 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 1 ) 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 1 ) + 𝑛 ⁡ ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 2 )
where n( Flavorx ) denotes the detected number of licks to Flavor x during a given session. To eliminate the influence of side-biases mice were tested four consecutive times with sipper positions being switched between any two consecutive tests, with the overall average across trials defined as the actual preference.
Animals exposed to either intra-ileal or intra-oral infusions via catheters had orofacial reactions assessed as previously described ( Travers et al., 2007 78. Travers, J.B. ∙ Herman, K. ∙ Yoo, J. ... Taste reactivity and Fos expression in GAD1-EGFP transgenic mice Chem. Senses. 2007; 32 :129-137 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). Videos were scored by a blinded observer. For head-fixed mice, the time of each occurrence of a facial movement falling into one of the following aversive categories was noted: lateral mouth movement, jaw chatter, mouth swipe, and gape. These response categories are like the oral reactivity responses that have been described in the literature ( Travers et al., 2007 78. Travers, J.B. ∙ Herman, K. ∙ Yoo, J. ... Taste reactivity and Fos expression in GAD1-EGFP transgenic mice Chem. Senses. 2007; 32 :129-137 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), excepting the jaw-chatter. During this movement forceful closing of the jaw is accompanied by an un-subtle displacement of the ocular globe in the orbit. This response was seen frequently in response to bitter or strongly sour tastes, so was included here. Videos of animals' facial responses were recorded at 100 fps, individual frames were triggered using the recording equipment (TDT RZ5, which also triggered pumps for ileum infusion), and this allowed accurate measurement of time relative to the infusions.
Mice were trained to produce licks to a metallic spout containing 5% IntraLipid to receive either intra-ileal or intra-duodenal infusions of IntraLipid fat emulsions. The exterior part of the catheter was connected to a segment of MicroRenathane tubing secured to the tip of a 3mL standard syringe containing the solutions to be infused and mounted on the syringe pump. The syringe pump was placed near a small hole made on the superior part of the sound attenuating box in such a way that mice could move freely inside the behavioral chambers. During the task, 200 detected licks of 5% IntraLipid triggered a 180μL intra-ileal or intra-duodenal infusion of 20% IntraLipid that lasted for 6 seconds. However, licks detected while an infusion was taking place had no programmed consequences (i.e., did not result in additional infusions). Experimental tests lasted for 1 hour. Animals were tested once a day in their responses to one single concentration of IntraLipid (20%). Habituation sessions lasted for 1h and were performed daily allowing animals to lick water. Animals were considered trained to perform the experiments once they showed less than 10% between-session variability, a criterion reached within 10 consecutive sessions. In a variation of this task, animals were simply assessed for total licks to 5% IntraLipid. To generate IntraLipid lick data, we counted the total number of positive timestamps stored in the file containing the timestamps associated with licks detected by the contact lickometer (Med Associates). Thus, the IntraLipid lick data correspond to total numbers of detected licks during the 1-hour sessions.
Implanted mice were connected to an opto-fiber cord and trained to produce licks to a metallic spout containing 2mM Sucralose. Training sessions lasted for one hour. Animals were considered trained to perform the experiments once they showed less than 10% between-session variability. During the one-hour test session, a detected lick triggered a TTL signal and turned the laser ON. Animal received a 25-ms 20 Hz laser pulse train stimulation lasted for 3 seconds. However, licks detected while an infusion was taking place had no programmed consequences (i.e., did not result in additional infusions). To generate the sucralose lick data, we counted the total number of positive timestamps stored in the file containing the timestamps associated with licks detected by the contact lickometer (Med Associates). Thus, the sucralose lick data correspond to total numbers of detected licks during the 1-hour sessions.
Mice were single caged and 2.5g chow/day food restricted. Implanted mice were connected to an opto-fiber cord and were allowed ad libitum access to chow in home-cage covered with open-top lid. After 1hour free consumption, the pellets were removed and weighted. Animals were considered trained to perform the experiments once they showed less than 10% between-session variability. During the one-hour test session, implanted mice were connected to an opto-fiber cord and were allowed ad libitum access to chow. At the same time, animals received a constant laser stimulation which was programed as 1-s long 25-ms 20 Hz laser pulse trains, with 2-s long intertrial intervals. The pellets were removed and weighted afterwards.
Place preference tests made use of automated video analyses (EthoVision XT11.5, Noldus). A rat behavioral cage was prepared in such a way that the floor of one half of the cage was covered by bedding (preferred by all mice) and the floor of the other half of the cage was covered by an acrylic platform (less preferred by all mice). To demonstrate place preferences, the less preferred area of the test cage was associated with switching the laser source ON, in such a way that the presence of the mouse in this area of the cage switched the laser source ON via a TTL board under control of the camera monitoring. To demonstrate place avoidance, the preferred area of the test cage was associated with switching the laser source ON. Quantification of occupancy of different areas of the cage made use of automated video analyses (EthoVision XT11.5, Noldus).
Stimulation frequencies were chosen according to the outcome of the nerve or slice electrophysiological studies. Although we did not detect major differences between stimulation frequencies in terms of evoking (or failing to) behavior, we used the 25-ms 20Hz frequencies for VGlut2-positive parasubthalamic nucleus neurons and/or terminals. Intensity at tip of fibers was estimated at approximately 5mW.
Clozapine-N-Oxide (5mg/kg, EnZo Life Sciences) was injected i.p. , 15 mins before the start of the behavioral sessions.
To determine the pathways via which stomach-innervating DRGs (“DRG Stom ”) signals distension to brain, we first performed gut-brain mapping in an organ-specific manner. We injected the retrograde Cre -expressing AAV2-retro-hSyn.HI.eGFP-Cre virus into the muscle layers of the stomach of wild-type mice, followed by bilateral injections of H129-CAG-LSL-TK-tdTomato into DRG Stom (T7-T10). In addition to DRGs and spinal cord, we analyzed and imaged HSV labeling in the lateral reticular formation (“LRN”), a medullary nucleus involved in decoding proprioceptive spinal signals ( Pivetta et al., 2014 57. Pivetta, C. ∙ Esposito, M.S. ∙ Sigrist, M. ... Motor-circuit communication matrix from spinal cord to brainstem neurons revealed by developmental origin Cell. 2014; 156 :537-548 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also imaged HSV of DRG Stom origin detected most conspicuously in the parasubthalamic nucleus (“PSTn”), a lateral hypothalamic region involved in appetite suppression ( Barbier et al., 2020 2. Barbier, M. ∙ Chometton, S. ∙ Pautrat, A. ... A basal ganglia-like cortical-amygdalar-hypothalamic network mediates feeding behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :15967-15976 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Tracing data are shown in Figures 5 E and 5F and areas infected are listed in Table S1 . We performed additional anatomical studies that revealed that NG Stom versus DRG Stom appear to access the lower brainstem via divergent pathways (see Figures S5 I–S5O). The custom-built integrated system was the used to simultaneously acquire stomach electromyogram, single unit, and high-speed video records from head-fixed mice. The state of gastric distension was manipulated via the intra-gastric balloon. To confirm that PSTn is downstream of an ileal-hypothalamic pathway, we injected the Cre -dependent, polysynaptic retrograde virus PRV-2017 into the PSTn of VGlut2-ires- Cre mice (PSTn predominantly expresses excitatory VGlut2+ neurons; Barbier et al., 2020 2. Barbier, M. ∙ Chometton, S. ∙ Pautrat, A. ... A basal ganglia-like cortical-amygdalar-hypothalamic network mediates feeding behavior Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :15967-15976 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because VGlut2+ PSTn neurons (henceforth “PSTn VGlut2 ”) were connected to upstream structures including LRN, thoracic DRGs, CG, and, importantly, GLP-1R+ ileal myenteric neurons we imaged these structures. We also performed single neuron electrophysiological recordings from PSTn of head-fixed mice implanted with an intra-gastric balloon to show that PSTn neurons respond to balloon inflation. To cell-specifically ablate excitatory PSTn VGlut2 neurons, we injected the Cre -inducible caspase3 construct AAV5-flex-taCasp3 into the PSTn of VGlut2-ires- Cre mice. To explore the functional significance of the activation of PSTn neurons by intestinal GLP-1, we performed electrophysiological recordings concomitant to electromyograms of jaw musculature and high-resolution video recordings for orofacial reactivity analyses. We monitored the display of rejection-like responses ( Dolensek et al., 2020 20. Dolensek, N. ∙ Gehrlach, D.A. ∙ Klein, A.S. ... Facial expressions of emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice Science. 2020; 368 :89-94 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ), including gaping and paw flaying.
To test that PSTn controls craniofacial motor systems, we injected the polysynaptic retrograde virus PRV into the masseter, digastric, and genioglossus muscles, and into the parotid gland, which respectively control jaw closing, opening, tongue protrusions, and salivary secretion ( Han et al., 2017 30. Han, W. ∙ Tellez, L.A. ∙ Rangel, M.J. ... Integrated control of predatory hunting by the central nucleus of the amygdala Cell. 2017; 168 :311-324.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). The targeted muscles are critical for the generation of rejection motor responses ( Travers and Norgren, 1986 79. Travers, J.B. ∙ Norgren, R. Electromyographic analysis of the ingestion and rejection of sapid stimuli in the rat Behav. Neurosci. 1986; 100 :544-555 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). We imaged well localized labeling of PSTn neurons after injections into masseter and, more conspicuously, digastric and genioglossus. PRV injections were also performed into salivary glands and labeling in PSTn was imaged. Moreover, we injected the Cre -dependent, polysynaptic retrograde virus PRV-2017 into the PSTn of VGlut2-ires- Cre mice, and imaged neuron labeling in taste buds and geniculate ganglia ( Barretto et al., 2015 3. Barretto, R.P. ∙ Gillis-Smith, S. ∙ Chandrashekar, J. ... The neural representation of taste quality at the periphery Nature. 2015; 517 :373-376 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, because forebrain regions access the trigeminal motor nucleus via the pontine parvocellular reticular formation (“PCRt”; Han et al., 2017 30. Han, W. ∙ Tellez, L.A. ∙ Rangel, M.J. ... Integrated control of predatory hunting by the central nucleus of the amygdala Cell. 2017; 168 :311-324.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ), we studied PSTn VGlut2 ->PCRt pathways using optogenetics. To functionally target PSTn VGlut2 neurons, we injected the depolarizing optogenetic construct AAV5-EF1a-DIO-hChR2[H134R]-EYFP into the PSTn of VGlut2-ires- Cre mice. This idea was based on detection of synaptophisin EYFP+ terminals in PCRt (see Figure 7 K). We thus implanted optical fibers over PCRt in these animals.
Data analyses, excluding electromyogram/electrophysiological/calcium imaging data, were performed using SPSS (v.21.0, IBM Predictive Software), Ethovision XT 11.5 (Noldus), GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad) and Matlab (v.17b, MathWorks). Animals assigned to the different experimental groups were experimentally naïve littermates, so that no randomization or other a priori criteria were adopted for group assignments. Experimental manipulations were analyzed according to within-subject repeated-measures designs. Order of experimental conditions was randomly assigned across subjects. Samples sizes were chosen based on our previous studies employing similar optogenetic, electrophysiological and neuronal ablation approaches. Samples sizes adopted in our current study were sufficient for detecting strong effect sizes while complying with guidelines from local enforcing rules requesting minimal animal usage by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experimenters were not blind to experimental conditions. Only animals carrying signs of distress/infection/bleeding/anorexia after the surgical procedures were excluded. Data from all animals used in the experiments were included in the final analyses and plots.
For all behavioral studies, including those resulting from pathway-targeted lesions, optogenetics and/or chemogenetic experiments, analyses made use of standard linear models (Pearson correlation), as well as one- or two-way (repeated measures) ANOVAs and post-hoc t-tests tests whenever relevant, for correcting for multiple comparisons. All data were reported as mean±SEM. In all cases sample sizes (N) denote number of animals used. All p-values associated with the t-tests performed correspond to two-tailed tests, and all post-hoc tests were corrected for multiple comparisons by employing Bonferroni correction. To assess potentially spurious results associated with non-normality, all significant effects were confirmed by rerunning the tests using the appropriate non-parametric test. All data are individually plotted (Prism 7, GraphPad), and the corresponding bar plot of the precision measures (mean ± SEM) were overlaid on the figure. The exact value of all N (always number of animals), df, T/F, and p values are reported in the figure legends. An effect was considered statistically significant whenever the corresponding statistic was associated with a p-value (Bonferroni-corrected when appropriate) strictly less than 0.05.
The raw data from calcium transients were first motion-corrected using NoRMCorre ( Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017 59. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Giovannucci, A. NoRMCorre: an online algorithm for piecewise rigid motion correction of calcium imaging data J. Neurosci. Methods. 2017; 291 :83-94 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). The data were then denoised using DeepCAD, a self-supervised deep-learning method for spatiotemporal enhancement of calcium imaging data ( Li et al., 2021 45. Li, X. ∙ Zhang, G. ∙ Wu, J. ... Reinforcing neuron extraction and spike inference in calcium imaging using deep self-supervised denoising Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :1395-1400 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Overall number of training epochs was 7-9. We then generated the maximum intensity projection of the time-lapse images and utilized Cellpose, a deep learning-based segmentation method ( Stringer et al., 2021 74. Stringer, C. ∙ Wang, T. ∙ Michaelos, M. ... Cellpose: a generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation Nat. Methods. 2021; 18 :100-106 Crossref Scopus (1083) PubMed Google Scholar ), to segment individual neurons. The output files corresponding to each region of interest (ROIs) of individual neurons were stored as an ImageJ ROI file.
Using the motion-corrected imaging data and segmentation ROI files, we then calculated the mean values of both ROI GCaMP signals (ROI-Signal Mean ) and of the surrounding background (Background-Signal Mean ) for each individual neuron, following the strategy of the CaImAn software package ( Giovannucci et al., 2019 25. Giovannucci, A. ∙ Friedrich, J. ∙ Gunn, P. ... CaImAn an open source tool for scalable calcium imaging data analysis eLife. 2019; 8 :e38173 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017 59. Pnevmatikakis, E.A. ∙ Giovannucci, A. NoRMCorre: an online algorithm for piecewise rigid motion correction of calcium imaging data J. Neurosci. Methods. 2017; 291 :83-94 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). The calcium signal of each neuron was then defined as ROI-Signal Mean – Background-Signal Mean . We next computed, for each neuron, calcium signal z-scores using the mean values and standard deviations obtained from 5 min-long baseline periods observed before GLP-1 infusions into the ileum. The Python -based packages used for data analysis included NumPy (version 1.22.0), SciPy (version 1.7.1), Pandas (version 1.4.1), Matplotlib (version 3.4.3), and Seaborn (version 0.11.2).
To score unit responses to infusion of IntraLipid, GLP-1, or control solutions into the ileum, we devised a threshold-based criteria that could be applied to a design where only a single infusion of the control and of the experimental solution are performed. This was done for two reasons. First, the response to infusions of these substances (both behavioral and electrophysiological) took at least 10 minutes to develop and persisted for more than an hour. This was considered too long to perform multiple trials in a head fixed animal. Second, repeated infusions would raise the substantial confound of additive effects to multiple infusions.
To quantify the response of single units to ileum infusions, a principal component approach was adopted. Single units' firing rates were discretized into 2-5 second bins. Firing rates were Z-transformed, and the principal components of the transformed rates of all recorded units in response to the experimental infusion were calculated. For each unit, the weight or score of the first principal component was taken as its response to the experimental infusion. To set a threshold for determining which responses were significant, for each cell, its transformed firing rate in response to the control infusion was dot-multiplied with the first principal component calculated from the population response to the experimental infusion. In the resulting distribution, 3 standard deviations above the mean were set as a threshold value. A given unit was considered respondent to the ileal stimulus if the unit’s principal component 1 score in response to the experimental infusion that was greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean.
Firing rates were discretized to 5 second bins and Z-transformed. Three trials of balloon inflation and deflation were performed for each cell. A trial consisted of a balloon inflation-deflation program, as well as a period 20 seconds before and 20 seconds after the program. For PSTn recordings, the balloon was inflated to 0.3mL volume over 40 seconds, then deflated at the same rate. For LRN recordings the balloon was inflated to 0.5mL over 40 seconds, then deflated. For each cell, the trails were pooled, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between the cell's firing rate and the balloon volume. P-values were separately corrected (Holm-Sidak) for each recording area, and those meeting the cut-off were determined to be correlated to the balloon volume.
Rasters of cells recorded in the LRN were created based on bursts of contractions in the stomach EMG signal. To determine contraction events for constructing the raster, EMG traces from the stomach were integrated offline by high pass filtering at 300-500 Hz, then rectifying, and convolving with a 0.1 second boxcar. This integrated trace was Z-transformed, and a threshold for peak prominence was determined by manual oversight. The occurrence of a peak in this trace, separated by at least 1 second from surrounding peaks, was included as an event for an EMG triggered raster.
Cell firing rates were discretized into 0.1 second bins, and Z transformed. Cells that showed a significant difference in their firing rate during three periods relative initiation of EMG activity were determined to be significantly modulated in concert with the stomach. Specifically, the periods considered were as follows: pre-spanning from 10 to 9 seconds before the EMG event; peri-spanning from 0-1 seconds immediately after the EMG event; post-spanning from 9-10 seconds after the EMG event. Using a Friedman test, cells having significantly different rates between these periods were considered EMG modulated.
In a subset of experiments, simultaneous measurement of overlaying abdominal EMG and pylorus EMG signal provided reasonable assurance that the EMG signal for the corpus had minimal crosstalk between the overlaying skeletal muscle, and that high pass filtering substantially minimized movement related artifacts.
Spike sorting was performed manually using offlinesorter (Plexon). Data were then imported into Matlab or Python for analysis using custom-written software. Code for analysis is available upon request.
To perform EMG analyses, the signals were full-wave rectified and root mean square (RMS)-converted within moving windows of 25-ms duration. Baseline signals (obtained from those periods during which the laser source was off) were used to establish a cut-off C off value defined by the overall session mean M s and associated standard deviation STD s of the signals as 𝐶 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑓 = M s + ( 3 × S ⁢ T ⁢ D s )
This cut off value was then used to determine whether the signal ( S ) at a given time point was significantly different from baseline ( i.e. S ≥ C off ). Each time point in which this inequality holds true were defined as an “event”. These analyses were performed using custom software programmed in MATLAB (v.17b, MathWorks) and are available upon request.
