Title: A Translocation Pathway for Vesicle-Mediated Unconventional Protein Secretion


Abstract: Summary

Many cytosolic proteins lacking a signal peptide, called leaderless cargoes, are secreted through unconventional secretion. Vesicle trafficking is a major pathway involved. It is unclear how leaderless cargoes enter into the vesicle. Here, we find a translocation pathway regulating vesicle entry and secretion of leaderless cargoes. We identify TMED10 as a protein channel for the vesicle entry and secretion of many leaderless cargoes. The interaction of TMED10 C-terminal region with a motif in the cargo accounts for the selective release of the cargoes. In an in vitro reconstitution assay, TMED10 directly mediates the membrane translocation of leaderless cargoes into the liposome, which is dependent on protein unfolding and enhanced by HSP90s. In the cell, TMED10 localizes on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment and directs the entry of cargoes into this compartment. Furthermore, cargo induces the formation of TMED10 homo-oligomers which may act as a protein channel for cargo translocation.

Section: Introduction

Over evolution, both eukaryotes and prokaryotes have acquired protein secretion as a fundamental mechanism for intercellular communication. In eukaryotes, the majority of secretory proteins contain a signal peptide that allows for signal recognition particle (SRP) binding followed by translocation of the cargo into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the translocon SEC61 ( Rapoport et al., 2017; Shan and Walter, 2005; Voorhees and Hegde, 2016 74.

Voorhees, R.M. ∙ Hegde, R.S. Toward a structural understanding of co-translational protein translocation Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 41 :91-99 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The cargoes are then exported through ER-Golgi trafficking mediated by COPII and COPI vesicles ( Pantazopoulou and Glick, 2019; Zanetti et al., 2011 66. Pantazopoulou, A. ∙ Glick, B.S.

The overall process is termed as conventional secretion.
Recent studies found that many cytosolic proteins lacking a signal peptide (leaderless cargoes) are released through unconventional protein secretion (UPS) that bypasses the ER-Golgi trafficking itinerary ( Nickel and Rabouille, 2009; Rabouille et al., 2012 65.

Expanding evidence indicates that cargoes that undergo UPS are involved in diverse biological processes (including inflammation, development, virus infection, and lipid metabolism) and human diseases (such as neurodegeneration and cancer) ( Claude-Taupin et al., 2017; Dimou and Nickel, 2018; Ejlerskov et al., 2013; Lock et al., 2014; Malhotra, 2013; Rabouille, 2017; Villeneuve et al., 2018 13.

Unconventional secretion of FABP4 by endosomes and secretory lysosomes J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :649-665 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike a unified route for conventional secretion, UPS employs multiple means of protein delivery ( Dimou and Nickel, 2018; Rabouille, 2017; Zhang and Schekman, 2013 21. Dimou, E. ∙ Nickel, W. Unconventional mechanisms of eukaryotic protein secretion Curr. Biol. 2018; 28 :R406-R410 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar 72. Rabouille, C.

Unconventional secretion, unconventional solutions Science. 2013; 340 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). Regarding the secretion of cytosolic UPS cargoes, two major mechanisms have been proposed. One mechanism involves direct protein penetration across the plasma membrane (PM) (type I unconventional secretion, e.g., fibroblast growth factor 2 [FGF2]) ( Schäfer et al., 2004; Steringer and Nickel, 2018 78. Schäfer, T. ∙ Zentgraf, H. ∙ Zehe, C. ... Unconventional secretion of fibroblast growth factor 2 is mediated by direct translocation across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :6244-6251 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar 89. Steringer, J.P. ∙ Nickel, W. A direct gateway into the extracellular space: Unconventional secretion of FGF2 through self-sustained plasma membrane pores Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 83 :3-7 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ). The other mechanism is dependent on vesicular trafficking (type III unconventional secretion, e.g., yeast Acb1) ( Duran et al., 2010; Malhotra, 2013 24. Duran, J.M. ∙ Anjard, C. ∙ Stefan, C. ... Unconventional secretion of Acb1 is mediated by autophagosomes J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188 :527-536 Crossref Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar 58. Malhotra, V. Unconventional protein secretion: an evolving mechanism EMBO J. 2013; 32 :1660-1664 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the latter, the cargoes enter into a vesicle carrier that exports them through membrane trafficking. Because the cargoes lack a signal peptide, a key question has been how the leaderless cargoes enter into the vesicle carrier.
Here, we find a protein translocation pathway regulating leaderless cargo entry into the vesicle carrier in UPS. We identified a transmembrane protein transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10 (TMED10)/TMP21 as a regulatory factor for the secretion of multiple cargoes, including the mature form of interleukin 1(IL-1) family members and a set of other UPS cargoes (HSPB5, galectin-1/3, Tau, and annexin A1). We found that TMED10 directly facilitates the translocation of leaderless cargos into the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) via its C-terminal tail binding to a certain motif in the cargoes, the process of which is dependent on protein unfolding and enhanced by chaperones HSP90A/HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1/GRP94. Furthermore, the cargo triggers oligomerization of TMED10, which likely then forms a protein channel on the membrane to translocate the UPS cargoes into the vesicle.

IL-1β is a most intensely investigated UPS cargo that undergoes type I and type III pathways ( Claude-Taupin et al., 2018; Dimou and Nickel, 2018; Rubartelli et al., 1990; Sitia and Rubartelli, 2018 14.

The unconventional secretion of IL-1β: Handling a dangerous weapon to optimize inflammatory responses Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 83 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the type I pathway, IL-1β is released through a pore formed by the N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD) on the PM ( Evavold et al., 2018; Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015 26.

In the type III pathway, IL-β transits through vesicular carriers, including secretory lysosomes, autophagosomes, and multivesicular bodies ( Dupont et al., 2011; Schatz and Dobberstein, 1996; Semino et al., 2018; Verhoef et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2015 23.

The data from both others and us have indicated that the mature IL-1β (mIL-1β) is translocated into a vesicle carrier ( Andrei et al., 1999; Dupont et al., 2011; Semino et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015 2.

Progressive waves of IL-1β release by primary human monocytes via sequential activation of vesicular and gasdermin D-mediated secretory pathways Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :1088 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we found that the translocation is dependent on protein unfolding, which implicates the involvement of a translocon-like protein channel ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to identify the protein channel accounting for mIL-1β translocation, we employed a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) system coupled with protein crosslink and mass spectrometry ( Figure 1 A). Because aminopterin inhibits DHFR unfolding ( Andrei et al., 1999; Backhaus et al., 2004 2. Andrei, C. ∙ Dazzi, C. ∙ Lotti, L. ... The secretory route of the leaderless protein interleukin 1beta involves exocytosis of endolysosome-related vesicles Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10 :1463-1475 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 3. Backhaus, R. ∙ Zehe, C. ∙ Wegehingel, S. ... Unconventional protein secretion: membrane translocation of FGF-2 does not require protein unfolding J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117 :1727-1736 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ), the folded DHFR will likely plug the DHFR-tagged mIL-1β on the translocation machinery. This allows us to enrich the translocation machinery that associates with mIL-1β in the presence of aminopterin ( Figure 1 A). A semiquantitative mass spectrometry analysis identified 169 proteins that were more than 2-fold enriched or unique in the aminopterin-treated group. Of the 169 proteins, 11 were transmembrane proteins ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). We silenced the expression of the candidates by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and found that knockdown (KD) of TMED10 decreased mIL-1β secretion ( Figures S1 A and S1B). We confirmed the requirement of TMED10 for mIL-1β secretion by creating three TMED10 CRISPR knockout (KO) cell lines ( Figure S1 C). Exogenous expression of TMED10 increased mIL-1β secretion, whereas LMAN2 (another transmembrane protein candidate) expression showed no effect ( Figure S1 D). In addition, the requirement of TMED10 on IL-1β secretion is mature form specific ( Figure 1 C).
IL-1β is mainly released by inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils ( Sitia and Rubartelli, 2018 86. Sitia, R. ∙ Rubartelli, A. The unconventional secretion of IL-1β: Handling a dangerous weapon to optimize inflammatory responses Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2018; 83 :12-21 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the requirement of TMED10 for mIL-1β secretion in macrophages, we employed two differentiated macrophage cell lines, the mouse myeloid progenitor-derived macrophage (MPDM) ( Figure 1 D) and THP-1-differentiated macrophage ( Figure 1 E). In both cell lines, depletion of TMED10 via lentivirus-mediated RNAi ( Figure 1 D) or CRISPR KO ( Figure 1 E) dramatically reduced mIL-1β secretion, which was restored by re-expression of TMED10 ( Figures 1 D and 1E). A similar effect was also observed in a differentiated neutrophil-like cell line HL-60 ( Figure 1 F). In an IL-1β reporter assay, the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity corresponded to the level of mIL-1β in the medium from each TMED10-modulated cell ( Figures S1 E–S1G), which indicates that TMED10 regulates the secretion of active mIL-1β in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells. It has been shown that the activated form of caspase-1 was also released under conditions that stimulate IL-1β secretion ( Albus et al., 2012; He et al., 2015; Qu et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2012 1.

Methods. 2012; 9 :671-675 Crossref Scopus (32170) PubMed Google Scholar ). The release of p20, a subunit of the activated caspase-1, was not affected by TMED10 KO ( Figure S1 H), suggesting that TMED10 is not involved in caspase-1 release.
GSDMD cleavage-mediated pore formation and pyroptosis was recently shown to induce massive release of IL-1β in macrophages ( Evavold et al., 2018; Kayagaki et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015 26. Evavold, C.L. ∙ Ruan, J. ∙ Tan, Y. ... The Pore-Forming Protein Gasdermin D Regulates Interleukin-1 Secretion from Living Macrophages Immunity. 2018; 48 :35-44 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (479) PubMed Google Scholar 46.

Expression of TMED10 increased IL-1β secretion in GSDMD-KO THP-1 with similar extent to the wild-type (WT) THP-1, although GSDMD KO reduced IL-1β release without TMED10 expression ( Figure 1 G). Further, GSDMD KO did not affect the TMED10-regulated secretion of mIL-1β in non-inflammatory cells ( Figure S1 I). Another study indicated the possibility of mIL-1β release through directly penetrating the PM via binding to PIP2 and destabilizing the lipid bilayer ( Monteleone et al., 2018 61. Monteleone, M. ∙ Stanley, A.C. ∙ Chen, K.W. ... Interleukin-1β Maturation Triggers Its Relocation to the Plasma Membrane for Gasdermin-D-Dependent and -Independent Secretion Cell Rep. 2018; 24 :1425-1433 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). The TMED10-promoted mIL-1β secretion was not affected by the PM lipid-stabilizing reagent punicalagin or mutating the PIP2-binding polybasic motif of mIL-1β in our system ( Figures S1 J and S1K). Together, the data suggest that TMED10 facilitates mIL-1β secretion independent of GSDMD or PM penetration.
It was shown that whole-body TMED10-KO mice were not viable ( Denzel et al., 2000 19. Denzel, A. ∙ Otto, F. ∙ Girod, A. ... The p24 family member p23 is required for early embryonic development Curr. Biol. 2000; 10 :55-58 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine a role of TMED10 in regulating IL-1β secretion in physiological settings, we generated TMED10-Loxp mice and crossed with Lyz2-Cre mice to create myeloid cell lineage-specific TMED10 conditional knockout mice (CKO) ( Figures 1 H and 1I). In a model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic shock ( Lu et al., 2019; Ruiz et al., 2016 57. Lu, Y. ∙ Qiu, Y. ∙ Chen, P. ... ER-localized Hrd1 ubiquitinates and inactivates Usp15 to promote TLR4-induced inflammation during bacterial infection Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :2331-2346 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Ruiz, S. ∙ Vardon-Bounes, F. ∙ Merlet-Dupuy, V. ... Sepsis modeling in mice: ligation length is a major severity factor in cecal ligation and puncture Intensive Care Med. Exp. 2016; 4 :22 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), TMED10 CKO, compared to WT, led to compromised IL-1β rise in the serum and correspondingly less production of IL-6, an effector of IL-1β ( Mantovani et al., 2019 59. Mantovani, A. ∙ Dinarello, C.A. ∙ Molgora, M. ... Interleukin-1 and Related Cytokines in the Regulation of Inflammation and Immunity Immunity. 2019; 50 :778-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the lung, kidney, liver, and spleen ( Figures 1 J and 1K). In addition, compared to WT littermates, injury of the lung caused by the septic shock was largely reduced in TMED10 CKO mice, and consistently the survival time was increased ( Figures 1 L and 1M). The data suggest that TMED10 regulates IL-1β release and inflammation physiologically.
TMED10 associated with mIL-1β in co-immunoprecipitations (coIPs) ( Figures 2 A and 2B). As positive controls, mIL-1β or TMED10 associate with HSP90A or TMED9, respectively ( Figures 2 A and 2B), which is consistent with the previous data ( Füllekrug et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2015 29. Füllekrug, J. ∙ Suganuma, T. ∙ Tang, B.L. ... Localization and recycling of gp27 (hp24gamma3): complex formation with other p24 family members Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10 :1939-1955 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Endogenous TMED10 and mIL-1β associated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP-stimulated THP-1 cells and the interaction is direct as evidenced by an in vitro GST pull-down assay ( Figures 2 C, 2D, and S2 A–S2C [protein gel]). We did not detect an association between TMED10 and caspase-1 ( Figure S1 L).
TMED10 is a membrane protein with a single transmembrane domain, a luminal part containing a signal peptide (SS), a GOLD domain and a coil-coil (CC) domain, as well as a C-terminal tail (CT) facing the cytoplasm ( Figure 2 E) ( Pastor-Cantizano et al., 2016 67. Pastor-Cantizano, N. ∙ Montesinos, J.C. ∙ Bernat-Silvestre, C. ... p24 family proteins: key players in the regulation of trafficking along the secretory pathway Protoplasma. 2016; 253 :967-985 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ). We constructed plasmids expressing domain deletion mutants. In both coIP and Duolink PLA, TMED10 truncations with the GOLD or CT deletion failed to associate with mIL-1β ( Figures 2 F and 2G), indicating that the two parts are responsible for mIL-1β interaction. To find the direct interaction part, we performed coIP of mIL-1β with the GOLD or the CT. The GOLD failed to associate with mIL-1β whereas the CT did, indicating that the CT directly interacts with mIL-1β ( Figures 2 H and 2I).
To determine the role of TMED10-mIL-1β interaction, we re-expressed the full-length TMED10 and each truncation in TMED10-KO cells. Consistent with the protein interaction assay, deletion of the GOLD or the CT failed to rescue mIL-1β secretion in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells ( Figures 2 J and 2K). To further confirm the functional significance of the TMED10-mIL-1β interaction, we overexpressed the TMED10-CT construct, which competed against TMED10-mIL-1β interaction and consequently blocked mIL-1β secretion ( Figures 2 L and 2M).
To determine if TMED10 plays a broader role in unconventional secretion, we determined the effect of TMED10 on the secretion of the mature form of IL-1 family members (that lack signal peptides and have been suggested to undergo UPS) and a set of other reported UPS cargoes ( Chauhan et al., 2013; Claude-Taupin et al., 2017; Dimou and Nickel, 2018; Dinarello, 2018; Ejlerskov et al., 2013; Gardella et al., 2002; Malhotra, 2013; Mantovani et al., 2019; Popa et al., 2018 8.

Of the UPS cargoes tested, KD of TMED10 decreased the secretion of the mature forms of IL-1 family members and other cargoes including HSPB5, galectin-1/3, annexin A1, and Tau, but not high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) or α-synuclein ( Figures 3 A, S3 A, and S3B). As controls, two type I UPS cargoes (FGF2 and HIV-TAT) and conventional secretion cargoes (ssGFP and IL-6) were not affected by TMED10 depletion ( Figures 3 A, S3 A, and S3B).
The above interaction analysis indicates that TMED10 regulates the secretion of mIL-1β via association with its CT ( Figure 2 I). To determine the role of the TMED10-CT in regulating the secretion of the cargoes, we analyzed the effect of TMED10 and TMED10-CT expression on the secretion of the cargoes relying on TMED10 for secretion ( Figures 3 A and S3 C). Consistently, full-length TMED10 expression increased the secretion of these UPS cargoes whereas TMED10-CT showed compromised effect ( Figures 3 A and S3 C). In coIP, a majority of the cargoes associated with TMED10 in a CT-dependent manner ( Figure S3 D). Together, the data indicate that TMED10 regulates the secretion of a category of UPS cargoes dependent on its CT association with the cargoes. The association of annexin A1 or Tau with TMED10 was barely detectable in the coIP assay (data not shown). It is likely that the interaction is too weak to be detected or TMED10 may indirectly regulate the secretion of annexin A1 and Tau.
It is possible that these UPS cargoes contain a common motif that directs them to the TMED10-regulated pathway for secretion. To look for such a sequence, we uploaded the sequences of these UPS cargoes in the MEME-Suite website for the discovery of common motifs ( Bailey and Elkan, 1994 4. Bailey, T.L. ∙ Elkan, C. Fitting a mixture model by expectation maximization to discover motifs in biopolymers Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2 :28-36 PubMed Google Scholar ). The website returned two motifs with an E value less than 0.05, which we named motif-1 and motif-2 ( Figures 3 B, 3C, S3 E, and S3F). We performed molecular dynamics simulation to predict the binding between TMED10-CT and the two motifs on mIL-1β. Of the 200 ns (ns) simulation time, motif-1 showed a strong binding with TMED10-CT in the first 170 ns, whereas motif-2 displayed less stable association ( Figures 3 D–3F). Mutation of the highly common residues in mIL-1β motif-1 (positions 1, 2 [FE(1,2)-AA], 7–10 [PNWY(7–10)-AAAA], and 9, 10 [WY(9,10)-LL]) abolished the TMED10-promoted secretion, whereas similar mutations in motif-2 (positions 3–5 (LGL[3–5)-AAA], 6–8 [KGK(6–8)-AAA], 10[L10A], and 12[L12A]) showed marginal effect ( Figures 3 G–3J). The data together indicate that motif-1 is more likely to participate in TMED10-mediated UPS. Notably, WY(9,10)-LL mutation reduced mIL-1β-TMED10 association in a Duolink PLA assay, suggesting the requirement of motif-1 for the interaction ( Figure 3 K). To determine if motif-1 is sufficient to drive secretion, we fused mIL-1β motif-1 to an mCherry protein. The motif-1 containing mCherry was able to associate with TMED10 and be secreted whereas the mCherry alone was not ( Figures 3 L and 3M), indicating that motif-1 is sufficient to direct a leaderless cargo to the route of secretion.
To determine the role of TMED10 in leaderless cargo entry into the vesicle, we performed membrane isolation and proteinase K protection ( Figures 4 A–4C) ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). KO of TMED10 decreased the amount of mIL-1β in the membrane ( Figure 4 A). The residual mIL-1β on TMED10KO cell membrane was barely protected from proteinase K digestion compared to control cells (~3-fold decrease), indicating the deficiency of mIL-1β membrane entry without TMED10 ( Figure 4 B). On the contrary, with exogenous TMED10 expression, the membrane fraction contained a higher level of mIL-1β that became more resistant to proteinase K digestion (~2-fold increase, Figures 4 A and 4C). The data suggest that TMED10 facilitates mIL-1β entry into vesicles.
To test the direct involvement of TMED10 in cargo membrane entry, an in vitro membrane translocation assay was performed ( Figure 4 D). We purified TMED10 and incorporated it into liposomes ( Figure 4 D). In a flotation assay, the TMED10 protein stayed with the membrane after treatment with 2 M Urea or Na 2 CO 3 (PH:11), indicating that TMED10 is integrated into the membrane ( Figure S2 D). A proteinase K protection assay showed that around half of the TMED10 with the CT facing outside on the liposome, which is the correct topology for the outside-in translocation assay ( Figure S2 E). The presence of TMED10 in the liposome generated a fraction of mIL-1β protected from proteinase K digestion compared to the control liposome ( Figure 4 E), which is TMED10 dose-dependent and temperature-dependent ( Figures S4 A and S4B), indicating that mIL-1β enters into the vesicle through TMED10. Similar translocation assays were performed with mIL-18, mIL-33, mIL-36α, and mIL-37 that also showed a TMED10-dependent vesicle entry ( Figures S4 D–S4G).
The previous studies reported a requirement of HSP90 in IL-1β membrane entry and secretion ( Zhang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018b 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 102. Zhang, Z. ∙ Wei, Y. ∙ Liu, B. ... Hsp90/Sec22b promotes unconventional secretion of mature-IL-1β through an autophagosomal carrier in porcine alveolar macrophages during Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection Mol. Immunol. 2018; 101 :130-139 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ). HSP90A and HSP90B1, the two HSP90s located in the cytosol and ER lumen, respectively, directly interacted with mIL-1β ( Figures S2 [protein gel], S5 A, and S5B) and regulated mIL-1β secretion ( Figures S5 C and S5D). HSP90s, when combined together, boosted the translocation of mIL-1β in an ATP-dependent manner ( Figures 4 F and S5 E). The data indicate that TMED10, together with HSP90A and HSP90B1, directly facilitates mIL-1β membrane translocation.
The aforementioned data demonstrated the requirement of mIL-1β binding in TMED10-mediated leaderless cargo secretion. Consistently, the GOLD- or CT-truncated TMED10 mutant lost its ability to promote the membrane translocation of mIL-1β ( Figure 4 H). Together, the data indicate that TMED10 is a sufficient and direct factor for membrane translocation of the UPS cargoes.
Previously, we found that IL-1β unfolding is required for its membrane entry and secretion ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if cargo unfolding is required for TMED10-mediated translocation, we incorporated the DHFR-aminopterin system shown above into the translocation assay. Aminopterin abolished the TMED10-dependent membrane entry of mIL-1β-DHFR in the conditions of both with and without HSP90s, confirming that protein unfolding is required for cargo translocation ( Figure 5 A and S4 C).
To further examine the role of cargo unfolding, we employed a cargo pre-unfolding assay ( Bauer et al., 2014 6. Bauer, B.W. ∙ Shemesh, T. ∙ Chen, Y. ... A “push and slide” mechanism allows sequence-insensitive translocation of secretory proteins by the SecA ATPase Cell. 2014; 157 :1416-1429 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We incubated mIL-1β with 6 M Urea to denature the cargo, making it in an unfolded state. We compared the TMED10-dependent translocation between native and pre-unfolded cargoes. In line with the DHFR-aminopterin assay, cargo pre-unfolding enhanced membrane entry of mIL-1β ( Figure 5 B), indicating a preference for unfolded cargoes for TMED10-mediated translocation. Mutation of the motif-1 drastically compromised the translocation of both native and pre-folded mIL-1β ( Figures 5 C and S2 [protein gel]). On the contrary, appending motif-1 to mCherry (an inert cargo for UPS as shown in Figure 3 ) rendered its translocation into the liposomes that was dependent on TMED10 and pre-unfolding ( Figures 5 D and S2 [protein gel]). Therefore, the data indicate that cargo unfolding and TMED10 interaction via motif-1 work together to facilitate the efficiency of cargo translocation.
To identify the membrane compartment the leaderless cargoes enter during TMED10-mediated UPS, we performed immunofluorescence. Consistent with previous results, TMED10 co-localized with an ERGIC marker ERGIC53 ( Jenne et al., 2002 42. Jenne, N. ∙ Frey, K. ∙ Brugger, B. ... Oligomeric state and stoichiometry of p24 proteins in the early secretory pathway J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :46504-46511 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ) in macrophage and non-macrophage cells ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). A condition that triggers IL-1β secretion leads to the co-localization of IL-1β with the TMED10 compartment on the ERGIC ( Figures 6 B and 6C). In non-macrophage cells, the expressed mIL-1β also co-localized with TMED10 ( Figure S6 B). In addition, the TMED10-colocalized mIL-1β was not detected without Triton X-100 permeabilization of the ERGIC membrane suggesting mIL-1β localizes inside the TMED10 compartment ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the coexistence of TMED10 and mIL-1β in a vesicular-tubular compartment (VTC) resembling the ERGIC ( Figures S6 D and S6E). Besides IL-1β, we also observed the co-localization of other leaderless cargoes with TMED10, including mIL-1α, mIL-36α, mIL-36RA, mIL-37, mIL-38, and HSPB5, suggesting that these cargoes also entered into the TMED10-positive compartment ( Figure S6 F).
To validate if the cargoes reside in the same vesicle with TMED10, we performed a fluorescence complementation assay in which we co-expressed pIL-1β-GFP11 with TMED10 containing a luminal GFP(1–10) tag (GFP(1–10)-TMED10 ( Figures 6 D and 6E) ( Kamiyama et al., 2016 44. Kamiyama, D. ∙ Sekine, S. ∙ Barsi-Rhyne, B. ... Versatile protein tagging in cells with split fluorescent protein Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :11046 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). A more than 2-fold increase of GFP level was observed under conditions stimulating IL-1β secretion in THP-1 ( Figures 6 F and 6G), which supports the notion that mIL-1β enters into the same vesicles with TMED10. An increase of fluorescence complementation was also observed in non-macrophage cells when mIL-1β was produced by co-expressing pIL-1β and pro-caspase-1, or mIL-1β was directly expressed in a similar level ( Figure 6 H-J), indicating that the generation of mIL-1β per se is the trigger to enter the ERGIC. The fluorescence complementation is TMED10 specific because mIL-1β-GFP11 failed to generate GFP signal with another GFP(1–10)-tagged ERGIC protein LMAN2 ( Figures S6 G and S6H). Together, the data indicate that TMED10 directly facilitates the entry of leaderless cargoes into a sub-region of the ERGIC where TMED10 is enriched.
TMED10 is a single transmembrane protein. It is probable that TMED10 oligomerizes to form a protein channel. In coIP, TMED10 associates with itself independent of a reported binding partner TMED9 ( Figure S7 A), and the self-association is direct ( Figure S7 B). In THP-1 cells, TMED10 forms high molecular weight complexes, likely to be TMED10 oligomers, in response to a condition that stimulates mIL-1β production and secretion ( Figure 7 A). To determine the fate of TMED10 oligomers after secretion, we induced mIL-1β secretion after which we inhibited caspase-1 to turn off secretion. We analyzed TMED10 oligomer and monomer using the crosslink assay ( Figure 7 B). The TMED10 oligomer gradually decreased after secretion with a corresponding increase of monomer that was not affected by proteasome inhibition ( Figure 7 B), indicating that TMED10 oligomer turned into monomer instead of staying oligomeric or being degraded by the proteasome after secretion.
Regarding the induction of TMED10 oligomers, it is possible that the production of a secretion-competent cargo (e.g., the generation of mIL-1β upon LPS and ATP treatment) may promote the formation of TMED10 oligomers. To test this possibility, we expressed TMED10 in the absence and presence of secretion-competent cargoes. Indeed, the presence of mIL-1β, as well as another two cargoes (mIL-1α and HSPB5), induced the high molecular weight complex formation of TMED10 ( Figures 7 C, S7 C, and S7D), which correlated with the increase of TMED10 self-association ( Figure S7 E), suggesting a cargo-induced TMED10 oligomerization. We also observed a basal level of TMED10 oligomerization/self-association likely to be induced by endogenous cargoes or for other purposes ( Figures 7 C and S7 C–S7E). The stimulatory effect of mIL-1β on oligomerization and self-association was abolished in the TMED10ΔCT mutant that still localized to the ERGIC ( Figures 7 C, S7 E, and S7F), suggesting that the binding of cargo to CT is required to enhance oligomerization. Consistently, the motif-1-containing mCherry that associates with TMED10 ( Figure 3 M) promoted TMED10 oligomerization whereas mCherry alone did not ( Figure 7 D).
Deletion of the GOLD domain abolished TMED10 self-association and oligomerization on the membrane ( Figures S2 [protein gel] and S7 G–S7J). The dimer of TMED10ΔGD is likely a result of GST dimerization ( Figures S7 I and S7J). As indicated above, the GOLD domain truncation lost the ability to mediate cargo entry into the vesicle and secretion indicating the importance of oligomerization in TMED10-mediated cargo translocation ( Figures 2 and 4 ). A requirement of the GOLD domain for TMED10 oligomerization was also reported before ( Nagae et al., 2016 62. Nagae, M. ∙ Hirata, T. ∙ Morita-Matsumoto, K. ... 3D Structure and Interaction of p24β and p24δ Golgi Dynamics Domains: Implication for p24 Complex Formation and Cargo Transport J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428 :4087-4099 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Section: Discussion

How leaderless cargoes enter into the vesicle carrier in UPS has been a major question in the field. In this study, we found a protein translocation pathway providing an implication to answer this question. Based on our data, we propose a model for the translocation process. When a secretion-competent UPS cargo (e.g., the mature form of IL-1 family members) is produced, it binds to the cytosolic HSP90A that may facilitate the unfolding of the cargo. The cargo then interacts with TMED10 on the ERGIC that induces its oligomerization to form a protein channel. With the aid of HSP90B1, the TMED10 channel translocates the cargo into the lumen of the ERGIC. Via this way, the leaderless cargoes enter into the vesicle carrier ready to be delivered out of the cell ( Figure 7 E). We tentatively name the pathway the TMED10-channeled UPS (THU).
The two protein translocation pathways, SEC61-mediated translocation and THU, may act in parallel to handle conventional and part of unconventional secretion. In conventional secretion, signal peptide-containing cargoes are recognized by the SRP, which directs them, together with the translation complex, to the translocon SEC61 on the ER ( Rapoport et al., 2017; Shan and Walter, 2005; Voorhees and Hegde, 2016 74. Rapoport, T.A. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Park, E. Structural and Mechanistic Insights into Protein Translocation Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33 :369-390 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar 83. Shan, S.O. ∙ Walter, P. Co-translational protein targeting by the signal recognition particle FEBS Lett. 2005; 579 :921-926 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar 95. Voorhees, R.M. ∙ Hegde, R.S. Toward a structural understanding of co-translational protein translocation Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 41 :91-99 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Activated by the signal peptide and auxiliary components, the translocon is opened and the cargoes are translocated into the ER with the help of a luminal chaperone BIP co-translationally ( Rapoport et al., 2017 74. Rapoport, T.A. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Park, E. Structural and Mechanistic Insights into Protein Translocation Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33 :369-390 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). In THU, leaderless cargoes bind to HSP90A that likely recognizes and unfolds the cargoes. Once unfolded, the cargoes may expose a signal motif (possibly motif-1) ( Figure 3 ) that promotes the assembly of TMED10 channel ( Figure 7 E) and then activates translocation post-translationally. Similar to the role of BIP, the luminal chaperone HSP90B1 may act as a molecular ratchet to facilitate translocation. It is not clear whether other auxiliary components equivalent to that of the SEC61 translocon (e.g., SEC62, SEC63, or TRAP) exist to aid the TMED10 channel. ( Fons et al., 2003; Lakkaraju et al., 2012; Lang et al., 2012, 2017; Sommer et al., 2013 27. Fons, R.D. ∙ Bogert, B.A. ∙ Hegde, R.S.

Acta. 2013; 1833 :3104-3111 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). The protein structure and dynamic regulation of the TMED10 channel are unknown too. Comprehensive structural investigation, proteomic analysis, and a cell-free reconstitution using the native membrane are necessary to further dissect THU in the near future.
The mechanism of THU is similar to another translocation process, the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which cytosolic substrates are translocated into the lysosome for degradation through a cytosolic chaperone Hsc70, a luminal chaperone lysosomal Hsc70 and a single-transmembrane transporter LAMP2A, in which protein unfolding is required ( Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008; Chiang et al., 1989; Cuervo and Dice, 1996; Kaushik and Cuervo, 2018; Salvador et al., 2000 5.

Import of a cytosolic protein into lysosomes by chaperone-mediated autophagy depends on its folding state J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 :27447-27456 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to THU, the cargoes trigger LAMP2A oligomerization that likely activates the transporter activity. An important feature of CMA is a KFERQ motif in the cytosolic cargo that is recognized by Hsc70 ( Dice, 1990; Kaushik and Cuervo, 2018 20. Dice, J.F. Peptide sequences that target cytosolic proteins for lysosomal proteolysis Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15 :305-309 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (512) PubMed Google Scholar 45. Kaushik, S. ∙ Cuervo, A.M. The coming of age of chaperone-mediated autophagy Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :365-381 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, KFERQ-like motifs in mIL-1β responsible for binding the cytosolic HSP90 have been indicated in our previous study ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, another motif (motif-1 in this study) may also determine the fate of a leaderless cargo that undergoes THU through interacting with the CT of TMED10. Although pending for further validation, it is possible that both types of selection motifs lead the cargo through the translocation process during THU. Recently, another motif, a di-acidic motif, was shown to be essential for the secretion of UPS cargoes SOD1 and Acb1 ( Cruz-Garcia et al., 2017 16. Cruz-Garcia, D. ∙ Brouwers, N. ∙ Duran, J.M. ... A diacidic motif determines unconventional secretion of wild-type and ALS-linked mutant SOD1 J. Cell Biol. 2017; 216 :2691-2700 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is not clear how this motif is recognized by the UPS machinery.
Our work indicates an activation-on-demand way of regulation in which the production of secretion-competent cargoes alone is sufficient to induce the assembly of the protein channel and activate THU. The activation-on-demand mechanism couples well with the situations when massive cargoes are produced and processed for secretion in response to certain stimuli (e.g., the massive production and maturation of an IL-1 family cytokine) ( Mantovani et al., 2019 59. Mantovani, A. ∙ Dinarello, C.A. ∙ Molgora, M. ... Interleukin-1 and Related Cytokines in the Regulation of Inflammation and Immunity Immunity. 2019; 50 :778-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (312) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, our data also indicate that THU regulates the release of cargoes that may not be massively generated at once. How is THU regulated in this case? It has been shown that stress conditions, such as starvation and oxidative stress, activates CMA via regulating the level of LAMP2A or its oligomerization ( Kaushik and Cuervo, 2018 45. Kaushik, S. ∙ Cuervo, A.M. The coming of age of chaperone-mediated autophagy Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :365-381 Crossref Scopus (491) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, mounting evidence indicates that the multiple types of UPS are also stimulated by stress conditions, such as starvation, ER stress, or reactive oxygen species generation ( Carta et al., 2011; Chiritoiu et al., 2019; Rabouille, 2017; Sitia and Rubartelli, 2018; Tassi et al., 2010 7.

USA. 2010; 107 :9789-9794 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Considering the similarity, THU is possibly regulated by stress stimuli that, together with the activation-on-demand way, makes THU able to accommodate the secretion of multiple UPS cargoes under diverse situations.
Our data imply that a sub-region of the ERGIC positive for TMED10 serves as a membrane carrier for the UPS cargos delivery in THU. In addition, secretory lysosomes, secretory autophagosomes, and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) have been shown to mediate UPS ( Dimou and Nickel, 2018; Rabouille, 2017; Zhang and Schekman, 2013 21.

Unconventional secretion, unconventional solutions Science. 2013; 340 :559-561 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that THU may cooperate with the auto/endolysosomal compartments ( Figure 7 E). One implication comes from our recent work indicating that the ERGIC delivers membranes to the autophagosome through a non-classical type of COPII vesicle, the ERGIC-COPII ( Ge et al., 2013, 2014, 2017 33.

Remodeling of ER-exit sites initiates a membrane supply pathway for autophagosome biogenesis EMBO Rep. 2017; 18 :1586-1603 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ). Considering secretory autophagy has been proposed to regulate UPS, it is enticing to speculate that THU may cooperate with ERGIC autophagosomal membrane generation for transport of UPS cargoes ( Figure 7 E). It has been shown that degradative autophagosomes fuse with the endosome and lysosome to complete autophagy ( Lamb et al., 2013; Mizushima, 2018; Nakamura and Yoshimori, 2017 50. Lamb, C.A. ∙ Yoshimori, T. ∙ Tooze, S.A. The autophagosome: origins unknown, biogenesis complex Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14 :759-774 Crossref Scopus (901) PubMed Google Scholar 60.

New insights into autophagosome-lysosome fusion J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :1209-1216 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). Likewise, the secretory autophagosome may later communicate with secretory lysosomes or MVBs to achieve secretion. One piece of evidence supporting the scenario is that SEC22B, an ERGIC-enriched SNARE, cooperates with TRIM16 to regulate trafficking of IL-1β into the secretory autophagosome ( Kimura et al., 2017 47. Kimura, T. ∙ Jia, J. ∙ Kumar, S. ... Dedicated SNAREs and specialized TRIM cargo receptors mediate secretory autophagy EMBO J. 2017; 36 :42-60 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Another piece of evidence is the study of the Golgi-localized protein GRASP that has been shown to regulate multiple types of UPS including type III and type VI UPS ( Gee et al., 2011; Giuliani et al., 2011; Kinseth et al., 2007; Schotman et al., 2008 36. Gee, H.Y. ∙ Noh, S.H. ∙ Tang, B.L. ...

Cell. 2008; 14 :171-182 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). In yeast, the GRASP homolog Grh1 organizes the formation of a multivesicular/multilamellar compartment called CUPS. The CUPS localizes adjacent to the ER exit sites (a yeast partial equivalent of the ERGIC) and contains membranes of early Golgi, endosome, and autophagosome ( Cruz-Garcia et al., 2014; Curwin et al., 2016; Dupont et al., 2011; Duran et al., 2010 15.

In addition, GRASP controlled the IRE1α ER-stress pathway and therefore IL-1β secretion in macrophage ( Chiritoiu et al., 2019 11. Chiritoiu, M. ∙ Brouwers, N. ∙ Turacchio, G. ... GRASP55 and UPR Control Interleukin-1beta Aggregation and Secretion Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :145-155 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that GRASP may enhance the cooperation of the ERES/ERGIC and auto/endolysosome-related compartments by spatially gathering them together, in which ER stress might be involved.
The coordinated action of the ERGIC and auto/endolysosomal compartments does not rule out the possibility that they function independently. In this case, it is necessary for leaderless cargoes to enter each membrane compartment. Indeed, both the auto/endolysosomal compartments and the ERGIC may possess the ability to incorporate cargoes: autophagosomes and MVBs engulf cytosolic cargoes directly ( Clague and Urbé, 2008; Mizushima, 2018 12. Clague, M.J. ∙ Urbé, S. Multivesicular bodies Curr. Biol. 2008; 18 :R402-R404 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Mizushima, N. A brief history of autophagy from cell biology to physiology and disease Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :521-527 Crossref Scopus (337) PubMed Google Scholar ). TMED10 could be a protein channel for cargo translocation into the ERGIC. Although a lysosomal transporter for UPS is pending for discovery, the CMA transporter LAMP2A may be a candidate because it was shown that IL-1β enters the LAMP2A-positive lysosome ( Semino et al., 2018 82. Semino, C. ∙ Carta, S. ∙ Gattorno, M. ... Progressive waves of IL-1β release by primary human monocytes via sequential activation of vesicular and gasdermin D-mediated secretory pathways Cell Death Dis. 2018; 9 :1088 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, a new UPS pathway called misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) was identified in which misfolded proteins are released through encapsulation into late endosomes ( Lee et al., 2016b 54. Lee, J.G. ∙ Takahama, S. ∙ Zhang, G. ... Unconventional secretion of misfolded proteins promotes adaptation to proteasome dysfunction in mammalian cells Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :765-776 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies all support the possibility that the ERGIC, autophagosome, and endolysosome are able to incorporate UPS cargoes.
In the current work, we identified TMED10 as a protein channel that regulates the secretion of a broad spectrum of UPS cargoes, including inflammatory factors (IL-1 family members and galectin 1, 3) and chaperones (HSPB5), which implies that THU may have a role in inflammation as well as multiple biological processes or pathological settings. Indeed, we found an involvement of TMED10 in regulating inflammation in a CLP-induced septic shock model ( Figure 1 ). Others have reported a role of TMED10 in regulating neuro-inflammation in a brain-specific TMED10 transgenic mouse ( Gong et al., 2011 38. Gong, P. ∙ Roseman, J. ∙ Fernandez, C.G. ... Transgenic neuronal overexpression reveals that stringently regulated p23 expression is critical for coordinated movement in mice Mol. Neurodegener. 2011; 6 :87 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further, multiple studies indicated the association of altered TMED10 level with pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration and cancer ( Chen et al., 2006; Nakano et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2019; Vetrivel et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018a, 2019 9.

Brain. 2019; 12 :39 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although multiple roles of TMED10 in physiology and diseases have been indicated, the contribution of THU needs further clarification, considering other functions of TMED10 have also been indicated, such as regulating GPI-anchored protein transport ( Fujita et al., 2011 28. Fujita, M. ∙ Watanabe, R. ∙ Jaensch, N. ... Sorting of GPI-anchored proteins into ER exit sites by p24 proteins is dependent on remodeled GPI J.

Cells were maintained in DMEM (HEK293T, U2OS, HeLa (GSDMD-KO HeLa were obtained from Dr. Feng Shao)) or RPMI-1640 (THP-1 (from Dr. Gong Cheng), HL-60 (from Dr. Yu Rao)) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in 5% CO2. MPDM (from Dr. Herbert Virgin) was maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Pen-Strep-Glut (Thermo), 30 μM BME, 10% conditioned medium from CMG14-12 cells (from Dr. Sunao Takeshita) ( Takeshita et al., 2000 90. Takeshita, S. ∙ Kaji, K. ∙ Kudo, A. Identification and characterization of the new osteoclast progenitor with macrophage phenotypes being able to differentiate into mature osteoclasts J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15 :1477-1488 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) (approximately 20 ng/ml GM-CSF) and 1 μM β-estrogen. For MPDM differentiation, β-estrogen was excluded from the culture medium. CMG14-12 was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and G418 (400 μg/mL). For producing GM-CSF, CMG14-12 was maintained in the medium in the absence of G418 for two days at the confluency of 100%.
The in vitro reconstitution contains steps of protein purification, proteoliposome creation and in vitro translocation. For protein purification, BL21 E. Coli was transformed with plasmids encoding the proteins. Single colonies were picked and incubated at 37°C in a shaker overnight. The culture was further expanded to 50-100 mL and incubated overnight similarly after which the culture was 1:50 diluted with 0.5-1 L fresh medium followed by incubating at 37°C in a shaker for 1-2 h until the OD600 reached to 0.6-0.8. IPTG (100 μM) was added to the culture and the protein expression was induced at 22°C for 5h with shaking. Protein purification was described in detail below. For proteoliposome creation, different kinds of TMED10 proteins (dissolved in Triton X-100) were incubated with phospholipids (dissolved in Triton X-100) extracted from HEK293T cells. Proteoliposomes were formed by gradually removing the detergent by Biobeads. For in vitro translocation, the purified cargo proteins were incubated with proteoliposomes with TMED10 with or without HSP90s at 30°C in the test tube for 1 h. A membrane flotation and proteinase K digestion were performed following the in vitro translocation (see below for details).
The mice experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Tsinghua University. Mice were housed in ventilated cages in a temperature and light regulated room in a SPF facility and received food and water ad libitum . TMED10 fl/fl mice (C57BL/6J) were created by GemPharmatech Co. Ltd, China. Mice with myeloid cell lineage-specific TMED10 deletion were generated via crossbreeding with Lyz2-Cre mice (C57BL/6J) ( Ji et al., 2019 43. Ji, L. ∙ Zhao, X. ∙ Zhang, B. ...

Exp. 2016; 4 :22 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, 8-12 weeks’ old mice, 6-10 mice per group (see detail in figure legends) with half male and female, were anesthetized and an abdominal incision was made to allow for ligation of the distal one-third of the caecum with a silk suture followed by two punctures with a 21-gauge needle. A small amount of caecal content was extruded through the puncture. After relocating the caecum to the abdomen, the incision was closed and 1 mL saline was injected intraperitoneally for resuscitation. For the mock-treated mice, the same steps, except for the puncture were performed.
The mature forms of IL-1 family members (p-IL-1β from Russell Vance, p-IL-18 from Sinobiological, pIL-36RA, α, β,γ and 37 from Dr. Xinquan Wang, the others were amplified from cDNA) were PCR amplified from templates of pro-forms and inserted into the FUGW vector with a FLAG tag at the C terminus. Mutagenesis was formed by PCR. mIL-1β, mIL-36α, mIL-37 and mIL-38 were inserted into PET28a vector for protein purification. The mIL-1β-FLAG-DHFR plasmid was constructed by subcloning the DHFR from MTS-GFP-DHFR (provided Dr. Walter Nickel) into the C terminus of mIL-1β-FLAG. We also obtained α-synuclein from OriGene, Tau and Galectin-1 from Addgene, IL-6 and FGF2 from Sinobiological, TAT from Dr. Xu Tan. Galectin-3 and Annexin A1 were PCR amplified from cDNAs. The TMED10-V5 plasmid was from DNASU. The TMED10 truncations were generated by mutagenesis PCR. The TMED10 variants were also inserted into PGEX4T1 vector for protein purification. The p-caspase-1 and HSP90A plasmids were from Addgene. The HSP90B1 was PCR amplified from cDNA and inserted into plasmids for mammalian cell expression and prokaryote protein purification.
For shRNAs, pLKO.1 lentivirus vector (Addgene) was used to introduce short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). As previously described ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The targeting sequences used to knock down the genes by shRNAs were shown in Table S2 .
For siRNAs, an equimolar mixture of 4 different siRNAs (Flexi Tube Hs TMP21-4, Hs TMED10-1,-3 and −4; QIAGEN) was used to induce TMED10 silencing. AllStars negative siRNA (QIAGEN) was used as a control.
We obtained DSS and DSP from Thermo, punicalagin, VX-765 and epoxomicin from Selleck, aminopterin, proteinase K, protease inhibitor cocktail, anti-FLAG M2 agarose, anti-V5 agarose, anti-HA agarose and Duolink PLA kit from Sigma, Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) from Amresco. Mouse anti-FLAG, anti-tubulin, goat anti-IL-1β, rabbit anti-IL-1β, anti-RPN1, anti-SEC22B, and anti-ERGIC53 antibodies were described before ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We purchased mouse anti-HSP90A antibody from Santa Cruz, rabbit anti-HSP90B1, anti-TMED10 and anti-TMED9 from Proteintech, rabbit anti-Caspase-1, anti-V5, anti-HA, anti-GST, anti-GFP and anti-mCherry antibodies from CST, mouse anti-T7 antibody from Sigma. Rabbit anti-GSDMD antibody is a general gift from Dr. Feng Shao.
Transfection of DNA constructs into cells was performed using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) for HEK293T and X-tremeGENE HP (Roche) for U2OS according to the manufacture’s protocols. The siRNA transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture’s protocols.
For determination of cargo secretion, cells (general cell lines) were replaced with DMEM for 1 hour or induced with 100ng/ml LPS overnight in RPMI-1640 plus 10% FBS followed by 2 mM ATP treatment for 30 min in physiological saline solution (147 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 13 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM KCl) ( Lopez-Castejon et al., 2010 56. Lopez-Castejon, G. ∙ Theaker, J. ∙ Pelegrin, P. ... P2X(7) receptor-mediated release of cathepsins from macrophages is a cytokine-independent mechanism potentially involved in joint diseases J. Immunol. 2010; 185 :2611-2619 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ). The medium was concentrated (20-fold) by a 10 kD Amicon filter (Millipore) and cell lysate was collected. Immunoblot was performed to determine the amount of cargoes in the medium and cell. LDH assay (Thermo) and SEAP (InvivoGen) were performed according to the manufacturers’ protocol.
For lentiviral transduction, pLKO.1 plasmids containing the shRNA constructs (together with lentiviral packaging plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 (Addgene)), pLX304 plasmids containing the TMED10-V5, FUGW, or LentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene) (together with VSVG and psPAX2) were transfected into HEK293T cells to produce lentiviral particles for 60-72 h. The supernatant was collected to infect the indicated inflammatory cells.
For the generation of TMED10-KO cell lines in HEK293T, the cells were transfected with PX330 containing TMED10 targeting sequences (sgRNA sequences: TCCGGCGCGGTTGAGGCCTT & TAACGGAAAAGGGCCGCGCC). For the generation of THP-1 or HL-60 TMED10-KO cell lines, the cells were infected with LentiCRISPRv2 virus containing the same TMED10 targeting sequences indicated above. For the generation of GSDMD-KO THP-1, the cells were infected with LentiCRISPRv2 virus containing the GSDMD targeting sequences (sgRNA sequences: TCTCCGGACTACCCGCTCAA & CGGCCTTTGAGCGGGTAGTC). The cells were then diluted and single colonies were isolated and determined for TMED10 KO.
For protein purification, genes encoding IL-1s and HSP90A were inserted into the PET28a vector, and genes encoding TMED10s and HSP90B were inserted into the PGEX4T1 vector. The proteins were expressed in BL21 E. Coli at 22°C for 5h (note: TMED10 is not glycosylated (data not shown) and therefore we purify the protein from BL21). After expression, the bacteria were collected and digested with 0.5mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) in lysis buffer (50mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 5mM EDTA,150mM NaCl,10% glycerol for GST protein purification, or 2x PBS, 10mM imidazole for His protein purification) plus 0.3mM DTT and protease inhibitors on ice for 0.5h. Triton X-100 was added to adjust to 0.5% final concentration. The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 20,000xg for 1h. The supernatants were incubated with Glutathione Agarose or Ni-NTA Agarose (Thermo) and rotated at 4°C for 2h. The agarose was washed with 10 bed volume of wash buffer with 0.1% Tween20 and wash buffer each (PBS for GST protein purification or 2xPBS+25mM imidazole for His protein purification). For purification of TMED10s, 0.5% Triton X-100 was included in all procedures. The proteins were eluted by elution buffers (50mM Tris 8.0, 250mM KCl, 25mM glutathione for GST proteins or 2x PBS, 250mM imidazole for His proteins) and concentrated by Amicon® Ultra Filters (Merck). FPLC was performed for buffer exchange and increase of purity. The proteins were snap frozen by liquid nitrogen and stored in PBS (0.5% Triton X-100 for TMED10s) at 80°C.
Total Lipids were extracted from HEK293T cells. Each 300 μL cell suspension was incubated with 1.2 mL chloroform/methanol solution (chloroform: methanol = 1:2) and vortexed for 30 s and shaken for 1h at 180 rpm at 37°C. Chloroform phase was collected and was evaporated by a stream of nitrogen gas over the lipid solution and further dried in 37°C incubator for 1h. Dried lipid was suspended in HEPES-KAc buffer contain 20mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and 150mM potassium acetate. The phosphatidylcholine content of lipid solution was measured and used as a standard to normalize lipid concentration. The lipid was aliquoted and stored in −80°C.
Proteolioposome reconstitution was performed according to a previous report with modifications ( Guna et al., 2018 39. Guna, A. ∙ Volkmar, N. ∙ Christianson, J.C. ... The ER membrane protein complex is a transmembrane domain insertase Science. 2018; 359 :470-473 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). The lipids were repeatedly frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in 42°C water bath for 10 times. Add Triton X-100 into lipid solution to a final concentration of 0.05% and rotated in 4°C for 30min. Recombinant proteins were added into the lipid solution (400 μL solution contain 10 μg GST-TMED10, with or without 72 μg HSP90B1, and 1.25 mg lipid) and incubated for another 1h with rotation. Each 400 μL solution was incubated with 6-8mg Biobeads SM2 (Bio-rad) equilibrated with the HEPES-KAc buffer at 4°C Beads were replaced each hour and repeated for 5 times (10 mg beads in the third time and incubated overnight). After a 1,500 xg centrifugation to remove the Biobeads, the liposome solution was repeatedly frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in 42°C water bath for 5 times. In order to remove the free proteins, a membrane flotation procedure was performed. For each 300 μL solution, 300 μL 50% OptiPrep (diluted in HEPES-KAc buffer) was added. The mixture was overlaid with 480 μL 20% OptiPrep and 90 μL HEPES-KAc buffer, centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 2h and the 150 μL top fraction (which contains the proteoliposomes) was collected and diluted with 150 μL HEPES-KAc buffer.
For the in vitro IL-1β translocation, recombinant proteins (150 μL reaction system contain 6 μg mIL-1β, with or without 2.7 μg HSP90A) and with or without ATP(5mM final concentration)were added to proteoliposome solution, incubated for 1h in 30°C. After then, an equal volume of 50% OptiPrep (diluted in HEPES-KAc buffer) was added followed by overlaying with 240 μL 20% OptiPrep, 45 μL HEPES-KAc buffer, and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 2h. The proteoliosomes (90 μL fraction from the top) were aliquoted into 3 fractions. The first fraction was a control, the second and third fractions were digested by protease K (10 μg/ml) without or with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min on ice. The reactions were stopped by 1mM PMSF and incubated for 10min on ice. Then SDS loading buffer was added and the samples were heated at 100°C for 10 min followed by immunoblot analysis.
This was described before ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the cells were harvested and lysed in HB1 buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 400 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA) with 0.3 mM DTT and protease inhibitors by passing through a 22G needle. The lysate was centrifuged at 1000xg for 10 min and the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 100,000xg for 40 min to collect the total membrane pellet. The pellet was suspended with 250 μL 35% Optiprep diluted in B88 buffer (20mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mM sorbitol, 150mM potassium acetate, 5mM magnesium acetate) and layered sequentially with 700 μL 30% Optiprep diluted in B88 and 50 μL B88 buffer, and ultra-centrifuged at 150,000 xg for 2h. The membrane fraction floating on the top was collected and divided into three fractions (without proteinase K, with proteinase K (15 μg/ml), and with proteinase K and 0.5% Triton X-100) 30 μL per fraction. The reactions were performed on ice and stopped by adding PMSF and 3 × SDS loading buffer. The samples were immediately heated at 100°C for 10 min.
For the DHFR assay to identify IL-1β translocation complex, the cells expressing mIL-1β-DHFR were treated with control or aminopterin as indicated before ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). DSP crosslink was performed (For the DSP crosslink cells were suspended in PBS with 2mM DSP at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 100 mM Tris (pH 7.4)). After crosslink, the membrane fraction was collected via a membrane flotation assay as indicated previously ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The membrane fractions were lysed and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG beads. Samples were eluted off of the beads via FLAG peptide competition. Semiquantitative mass spectrometry was performed in Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School.
For DSS crosslink assays, the cells or proteoliposomes were suspended in PBS with the indicated concentration of DSS at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 20 mM Tris followed by sample preparation for immunoblot as described before ( Ge et al., 2008, 2011 31. Ge, L. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Qi, W. ...

USA. 2011; 108 :551-556 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For coIP, the detail was described before ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in IP buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitor mixture, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were incubated with indicated agaroses and rotated at 4°C for 3hs. Then the agaroses were washed five times with IP buffer followed by immunoblot. For the immunoprecipitation performed after crosslinking, a similar procedure was carried out using another IP buffer (PBS, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 5mM EDTA and 5mM EGTA).
For GST pull-down, the proteins were purified and the GST-tagged bait was incubated with GSH-agarose (GE) (which was blocked by 5% milk) in IP buffer used for coIP, and rotated at 4°C for 1h. Then the beads loaded with the bait were collected and incubated with the prey protein 4°C for 2hs. The beads were washed 3 times followed by immunoblot.
Immunofluorescence was described previously ( Zhang et al., 2015 100. Zhang, M. ∙ Kenny, S.J. ∙ Ge, L. ... Translocation of interleukin-1β into a vesicle intermediate in autophagy-mediated secretion eLife. 2015; 4 :e11205 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, the cells were permeabilized with 40 μg/ml of digitonin diluted in PBS on ice for 5 min, washed once with cold PBS and immediately incubated with 4% cold paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were further permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS at room temperature for 10 min followed by blocking with 10% FBS diluted with PBS for 1 h and primary antibody incubation for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by secondary antibody incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence images were acquired using the Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using ImageJ.
Duolink PLA kit was purchased from Sigma and the assay was performed according to the product manual. In brief, equal amounts of IL-1βs-FLAG and TMED10-V5s were expressed in U2OS cells. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS at room temperature. The cells were blocked, incubated with primary antibodies and PLA probes followed by ligation and amplification using the recommended conditions according to the manual. Images were captured by Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope and quantifications were based on number of > 1 μm 2 puncta (in area) per cell using ImageJ software.
For fluorescence complementation, the cells expressing IL-1β-GFP11 and GFP(1-10)-TMED10 were treated as indicated in each figure. The GFP signal in the cells was collected by CytoFlex LX (Beckman) and analyzed by Flowjo software.
We followed the Tokuyasu method as described previously ( Slot and Geuze, 2007 87. Slot, J.W. ∙ Geuze, H.J. Cryosectioning and immunolabeling Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :2480-2491 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde and 0.01% glutraradehyde in PB buffer at 4°C overnight and then washed with chilled PB /Glycine. The cells were scraped from the bottom of the plastic dishes in 1% gelatin of PB buffer, centrifuged at 1000rpm/min for 2min and suspended in 12% gelatin at 37°C for 10min. The gelatin-cell mixture was solidified on ice for 15min. Small blocks about 0.5mm 3 were made and immersed in 2.3M sucrose overnight at 4°C. Cryosections of 70nm were made at −120°C with an ultratome (Leica EM FC7). After sections were thawed at room temperature, immunolabeling was performed with mouse anti-FLAG and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies followed by immune-Gold secondary antibody. The sections were treated with methyl cellulose/uranyl acetate and subsequently imaged under the H-7650 80kv transmission electron microscope.
Serum IL-1β was analyzed by ELISA using Mouse IL-1β Uncoated ELISA kit (Thermo). Gene expression was determined by qRT–PCR. Total RNA was isolated and cDNA was generated using retrotranscription. The samples were amplified using a CFX-96 machine (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green master mix (TSINGKE, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; data were normalized to the GAPDH control. The sequences of the primers for were listed in Key Resources Table .
The dynamic binding processes of TMED10 cytoplasmic part (sequence: YLRRFFKAKKLIE) and designed peptide motifs were studied by AAMD simulations with CHARMM36m force field ( Huang et al., 2017 41. Huang, J. ∙ Rauscher, S. ∙ Nawrocki, G. ... CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :71-73 Crossref Scopus (1762) PubMed Google Scholar ). The atomic structures of these peptides were predicted via I-TASSER web server ( Yang et al., 2015 97. Yang, J. ∙ Yan, R. ∙ Roy, A. ... The I-TASSER Suite: protein structure and function prediction Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :7-8 Crossref Scopus (3443) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the initial binding poses between them was obtained using ZDOCK protein docking ( Pierce et al., 2011 68. Pierce, B.G. ∙ Hourai, Y. ∙ Weng, Z. Accelerating protein docking in ZDOCK using an advanced 3D convolution library PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e24657 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). Then, the docking complex was put in a simulation water box with 150 mM NaCl with CHARMM-GUI webserver ( Lee et al., 2016a 53. Lee, J. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Swails, J.M. ... CHARMM-GUI input generator for NAMD, GROMACS, AMBER, OpenMM, and CHARMM/OpenMM simulations using the CHARMM36 additive force field J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016; 12 :405-413 Crossref Scopus (1246) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following by the 10 ns pre-equilibration processes, the final 200 ns production runs were performed with GROMACS software (version 2016.5) ( Pronk et al., 2013 70. Pronk, S. ∙ Páll, S. ∙ Schulz, R. ... GROMACS 4.5: a high-throughput and highly parallel open source molecular simulation toolkit Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :845-854 Crossref Scopus (4817) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the time step of 2 fs.
The ways of quantification of each experiment have been provided in the Method Details . The statistical information of each experiment, including the statistical methods, the P values and numbers (n), were shown in the figures and corresponding legends. Statistical significance for gene expression, serum IL-1β level, imaging quantification and molecular dynamics simulations was determined using two-tailed t test.
