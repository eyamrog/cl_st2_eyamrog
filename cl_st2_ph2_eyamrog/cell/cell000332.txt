Title: Elevated rates of horizontal gene transfer in the industrialized human microbiome


Abstract: Summary

Industrialization has impacted the human gut ecosystem, resulting in altered microbiome composition and diversity. Whether bacterial genomes may also adapt to the industrialization of their host populations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the extent to which the rates and targets of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) vary across thousands of bacterial strains from 15 human populations spanning a range of industrialization. We show that HGTs have accumulated in the microbiome over recent host generations and that HGT occurs at high frequency within individuals. Comparison across human populations reveals that industrialized lifestyles are associated with higher HGT rates and that the functions of HGTs are related to the level of host industrialization. Our results suggest that gut bacteria continuously acquire new functionality based on host lifestyle and that high rates of HGT may be a recent development in human history linked to industrialization.

Section: Introduction

Transitioning from nonindustrialized to industrialized lifestyles is associated with changes in gut microbiome composition and decreased bacterial species diversity ( Brewster et al., 2019 6.

Human gut microbiome viewed across age and geography Nature. 2012; 486 :222-227 Crossref Scopus (5629) PubMed Google Scholar ). While the precise causes of these changes are unknown, factors associated with the development of industrialized societies such as sanitation, the consumption of processed food, higher frequency of caesarean section, and increased use of antibiotics likely play key roles in remodeling the gut microbiome ( Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2019a 71. Sonnenburg, E.D. ∙ Sonnenburg, J.L. The ancestral and industrialized gut microbiota and implications for human health Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 17 :383-390 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). These perturbations in the gut ecosystem can occur shortly after individuals transition from nonindustrialized to industrialized areas and persist for years ( Vangay et al., 2018 77.

US Immigration Westernizes the Human Gut Microbiome Cell. 2018; 175 :962-972.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ), further confirming that lifestyle strongly influences the function of our gut microbiome. However, the effects of host and environmental factors associated with industrialized lifestyles on individual gut bacterial genomes are poorly characterized.
Bacteria can use horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to adapt rapidly to unstable environments through the acquisition of new functions. Mammalian gut bacteria have experienced frequent HGT events over millions of years of evolution ( Hehemann et al., 2010 30. Hehemann, J.-H. ∙ Correc, G. ∙ Barbeyron, T. ...

Previous studies of specific bacterial species showed that HGT can occur and be conserved in the gut microbiome within a single individual ( Coyne et al., 2014 12.

Antibiotic treatment expands the resistance reservoir and ecological network of the phage metagenome Nature. 2013; 499 :219-222 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, it remains unclear whether HGT can occur broadly enough to impact gut microbiome function over an individual’s lifetime, such as in response to significant lifestyle changes, or whether microbiomes primarily acquire new functions through the acquisition of new strains. It was previously observed that individual bacterial strains can reside within a host microbiome for decades ( Faith et al., 2013 19. Faith, J.J. ∙ Guruge, J.L. ∙ Charbonneau, M. ... The long-term stability of the human gut microbiota Science. 2013; 341 :1237439 Crossref Scopus (1508) PubMed Google Scholar ). If the rate of gene transfer is sufficiently rapid, then a microbiome that is “stable” in terms of bacterial populations ( Faith et al., 2013 19. Faith, J.J. ∙ Guruge, J.L. ∙ Charbonneau, M. ...

Stability of the human faecal microbiome in a cohort of adult men Nat. Microbiol. 2018; 3 :347-355 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) could nonetheless evolve in response to host-specific environmental perturbations through HGT, perhaps in response to changes in host lifestyle.
In a previous study ( Smillie et al., 2011 67. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Smith, M.B. ∙ Friedman, J. ... Ecology drives a global network of gene exchange connecting the human microbiome Nature. 2011; 480 :241-244 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found high levels of HGTs in the human microbiome involving >500-bp-length sequences with >99% similarity. Those results lacked the temporal resolution and the diversity in human populations necessary to address the questions of timescales and host lifestyle. Over short evolutionary timescales, the substitution rate of many bacterial species typically falls in the range of ∼1 SNP/genome/year ( Didelot et al., 2016 16.

Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Assuming this rough molecular clock approximation, and a genome size of 10 6 bp, the HGTs we detected using those criteria (>500 bp, >99% similarity) were consistent with transfer events that occurred between 0 and 10,000 years ago (see STAR Methods ). Variations in the molecular clock across species and genomic regions may shorten or expand this time interval. In any case, our previous results could not constrain the dates of HGT that occurred more recently than the rise of modern industrialization, dated to the 18th–19th century ( de Vries, 1994 15. de Vries, J. The Industrial Revolution and the Industrious Revolution J. Econ. Hist. 1994; 54 :249-270 Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar ). To answer the question of whether commensal strains can frequently acquire new functionality through HGT within an individual, such that recent adaptations to industrialization are detectable in contemporary bacterial genomes, more precise estimates of the rate and extent of HGT are needed.

Biotechnol. 2019; 37 :179-185 Crossref Scopus (332) PubMed Google Scholar ) originate almost exclusively from industrialized populations and, for the vast majority of strains, from different individuals, making investigation of within-person HGT impossible. Here, we present the Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMbC) isolate collection, composed of >4,000 cultured, isolated, and sequenced gut bacteria from diverse industrialized and nonindustrialized populations, including rich sets of strains from single individuals. We used these genomes to investigate the rate and patterns of gene transfers that occurred very recently in human history. We show that HGTs can occur at high and heterogeneous frequency within individuals, and we report elevated rates of gene transfer in industrialized populations.

Section: Results

We cultured, isolated, and whole-genome sequenced 4,149 gut bacteria from 37 individuals from 14 distinct populations with different levels of industrialization ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Bacteria were isolated from stool samples under anaerobic conditions, using previously published protocols ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). We combined these GMbC genomes with a set of 3,632 isolate genomes from the Broad Institute-OpenBiome Microbiome Library (BIO-ML) genome collection that we recently generated from 11 urban American donors ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielding a dataset of 7,781 isolate genomes. We then divided our cohort of 48 individuals according to two different parameters, which we defined as: “urban” versus “rural” (based on local population density) ( SEDAC Population Estimation Service, 2015 64. SEDAC Population Estimation Service https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/popest/pes-v3/ Date: 2015 Google Scholar ), and “industrialized” versus “nonindustrialized” (based on the Human Development Index [HDI] at the country level) ( United Nations Development Program, 2020 75. United Nations Development Program http://www.hdr.undp.org/en/data Date: 2020 Google Scholar ). For the purposes of this analysis, we used HDI as a proxy for industrialization because it reflects parameters that are relevant to health and the microbiome, such as the consumption of processed foods, rates of noncommunicable diseases, sanitation infrastructure, and health expenditure ( United Nations Development Program, 2020 75. United Nations Development Program http://www.hdr.undp.org/en/data Date: 2020 Google Scholar ). This classification system yielded four groups of different lifestyles: rural nonindustrialized, urban nonindustrialized, rural industrialized, and urban industrialized (see Figures 1 A, 1B, S1 A, and S1B and Table S1 for descriptions of population metadata and microbiome compositions). The nonindustrialized rural cohort includes populations with diverse subsistence strategies, including hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, fishermen, and farmers ( Figure 1 B).
We grouped our 7,781 isolate genomes into species clusters based on genomic similarity, using the Mash distance as a proxy for average nucleotide identity (see STAR Methods ). This identified 339 bacterial species across 6 phyla, grouping into 73 known and 88 unknown genera (see Figure 1 C and Table S2 for culturing data and genome assembly statistics). Comparing our genome collection to the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) database (see STAR Methods ; Almeida et al., 2021 1. Almeida, A. ∙ Nayfach, S. ∙ Boland, M. ... A unified catalog of 204,938 reference genomes from the human gut microbiome Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :105-114 Crossref Scopus (535) PubMed Google Scholar ), which comprises the largest set of human gut bacterial genomes, we found that 13% of the species in our collection have no representatives among all characterized UHGG species (which include species defined from metagenomic data alone), and 41% have no representatives among the set of previously cultivated human gut species ( Figure 1 D). We sampled a median of 93 isolate genomes and 17 species per individual, covering a wide range of within-person bacterial taxonomies and in vivo abundances ( Figure 1 E; Table S1 ), providing within-person genomic and ecological diversity for high-resolution investigation of HGTs.
We first detected and quantified HGT events that occurred recently in human history. We screened all genomes for large blocks of 100% identical DNA that were shared between any pairs of genomes of different species, retaining blocks larger than 500 bp (hereafter named “500bp+ HGTs”) or larger than 10 kb (“10kb+ HGTs”). HGT is the best explanation for these observations compared to vertical inheritance, as the expected number of mutations between highly conserved and vertically inherited ribosomal genes of different species far exceeds the threshold (0 SNP) used in our heuristic to retain candidate HGTs ( Figure S1 C). 10-kb+ HGTs that do not contain any mutations correspond to events that occurred between 0 and ∼100 years ago (see STAR Methods ). Thus, these 10kb+ HGTs likely occurred over the most recent two or three human generations, including within the sampled individuals. We removed putative contaminants from the analysis by filtering out HGTs with low relative sequencing coverage (i.e., compared to the coverage of the two genomes under consideration; see STAR Methods ), resulting in a set of HGTs with median relative coverage of 1.13 ( Figure S1 D). We found that 90% (7,031/7,781) and 53% (4,096/7,781) of our genomes are involved in at least one 500bp+ HGT and one 10kb+ HGT, respectively ( Figure 2 A; Table S3 ), covering a diversity of taxonomic groups ( Figure 2 B). HGTs included genes that are involved in a variety of cellular, metabolic, and informational functions ( Figure S1 E), with selfish element and phage/conjugative transposon functions being enriched in the set of 500bp+ HGTs and 10kb+ HGTs, respectively ( Figure S1 F). Many of the genes carried by within-person 10kb+ HGTs segregate at high frequencies in bacterial populations within each host, suggesting potential fixation ( Figure S1 G). However, the majority of transferred genes are found at low frequency, reflecting their recent acquisition in the population ( Figure S1 G).
To test whether these HGTs occurred recently, we compared the frequency and count of 10kb+ HGTs observed between bacteria isolated from a single individual with that observed between the same bacteria from different individuals (see STAR Methods ). We hypothesized that if transfers occur frequently within individual microbiomes, then we would observe higher levels of transfer between strains isolated from a single host. Alternatively, if transfers rarely occur (i.e., at rates slower than strain turnover), then we would observe similar levels of HGT between bacteria regardless of whether they were isolated from the same host. Importantly, both within-person and between-people HGTs include some background level of more ancient HGT (e.g., very slowly evolving genomic regions that are still 100% similar over the 10kb+ region) that do not result from direct sharing between two co-residing species in present microbiomes. Bacterial species that share genes directly, however, will only be found in within-person comparisons. The difference between the within-person and between-people HGTs reflects the very recent HGTs that occurred within individuals and thus can be quantified. We found that bacterial species pairs sampled within individuals are more likely to share recently transferred DNA than the same species pairs sampled from two different people; using a Poisson distribution, we compared the observed count of HGT events for pairs of species sampled within individual people to its expected value based on HGT frequencies of the same species pairs found between people ( Figure 3 A; p value < 2.2 × 10 −308 ). This comparison allows us to correct for differences in the number of both genome and individual pairs being sampled between the two categories (within person versus between people) (see statistical analyses in STAR Methods ). We also randomly downsampled our data to further control for the unequal sampling of genomes across individual pairs (see statistical analyses in STAR Methods ), which confirmed that observed HGT counts within individual people are higher than expected HGT counts (100 random replicates, Welsh t test, t = 259.56, df = 102.44, p value = 3.3 × 10 −146 ; see Table S4 ).
We next controlled for the effect of phylogeny on this result, as more closely related species are more likely to engage in HGT ( Smillie et al., 2011 67. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Smith, M.B. ∙ Friedman, J. ... Ecology drives a global network of gene exchange connecting the human microbiome Nature. 2011; 480 :241-244 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ) and could be unevenly distributed between within-person and between-people categories. In our data, phylogenetic relatedness strongly associates with HGT frequency (generalized linear mixed effects [GLME] models; n (species pairs) = 3,667; odds ratio [OR] = 0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.06; combined with a likelihood ratio test ([LRT], χ 2 = 62.96; p value = 2.1 × 10 −15 ) but does not confound our result; the within-person HGT is significantly higher than the between-people HGT across phylogenetic distance bins (Fisher’s method; χ 2 = 204.5 and p value = 7 × 10 -28 for 10kb+ HGTs; χ 2 = 149.1 and p value = 1.8 × 10 –14 for 500bp+ HGTs) ( Figure 3 B). In addition, the higher levels of within-person HGTs are also observed when looking at the larger set of 500bp+ HGTs (Poisson distribution, p value < 2.2 × 10 −308 ) ( Figures 3 A and S2 J). We also investigated whether the higher within-person HGT that we observed at the aggregate level was present in individual populations as well. Performing our analyses for each of the sampled countries or ethnic groups containing more than four individuals separately, we found that this observation was replicated in each individual group ( Figures S2 A–S2I). In addition, we controlled for the effect of the in vitro culturing of bacteria on the quantification of HGTs, as bacteria co-cultured on the same plate or in the presence of antibiotics could experience HGTs that do not reflect in vivo events. We did not find any significant increase in HGT for genome pairs grown on the same plate or in the presence of antibiotics (see STAR Methods and Table S4 for all statistical comparisons).
The signal of HGT enrichment within individuals compared to its expected value suggests that a broad and diverse set of bacterial species very recently engaged in HGT and that HGTs can rapidly accumulate in bacterial pangenomes. Strictly speaking, we cannot yet distinguish between individual transfers that occurred in the host of origin from those that may have occurred in a host’s parent or even grandparent. However, host intergenerational co-transmission of species involved in past HGTs must occur to observe ancient HGT events in today’s microbiome. To be counted in our analyses, these HGTs must also not experience any mutation. We used a simulation approach to quantify the amount of HGTs in the host of origin (generation 0, sampled at present time) that would represent past HGT events originating from previous generations and that would not have experienced any mutation (see STAR Methods ). We used a previously published rate of mother-to-infant strain transmission, estimated to be ∼16% ( Ferretti et al., 2018 20. Ferretti, P. ∙ Pasolli, E. ∙ Tett, A. ... Mother-to-Infant Microbial Transmission from Different Body Sites Shapes the Developing Infant Gut Microbiome Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :133-145.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (744) PubMed Google Scholar ), to fix the rate of intergenerational species transmission in our simulations. We also simulated data using a more extreme rate of 50% of species transmission across generations. We found that the number of HGTs rapidly decays across generations ( Figure 3 C). In total, the amount of 100% similar HGTs observed at present generation that originate from ancient generations is ∼3% with the 16% probability of vertical species transmission and ∼25% when considering the extreme probability of 50% species transmission. These results strongly suggest that the vast majority of HGTs being seen in within-person species comparisons occurred during the present generation (i.e., during the lifetime of each sampled individual).
We next investigated whether, within people, bacterial species engage in the transfer of gene functions that may impact bacterial metabolism or host physiology. To test this, we looked at within-person transferred genes involved in antibiotic resistance (antibiotic resistance genes [ARGs]), carbohydrate degradation (carbohydrate active enzyme [CAZyme]), and virulence. We found hundreds of species pairs engaging in the transfer of at least one of these three functions, with the majority of species pairs exchanging multiple functions ( Figure 3 D), an observation relevant to both Firmicutes and Bacteroides species pairs ( Figure 3 D).
Next, we hypothesized that if bacteria frequently acquire new genes within each person, then their pangenomes should exhibit strong variations in gene content over time. To directly measure the rate of within-person gene acquisition, we analyzed the gene repertoires of isolate genomes that were longitudinally sampled over the course of ∼6–18 months in two previous studies: 198 isolate genomes from five species ( Bacteroides fragilis , Bacteroides vulgatus , Bacteroides ovatus , Bifidobacterium longum , and Akkermansia muciniphila ) sampled in one individual ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 191 Bacteroides fragilis isolate genomes sampled in five additional people ( Zhao et al., 2019 85. Zhao, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ∙ Poyet, M. ... Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 3 E and S3 ; Table S5 ). As strain replacement between time points can contribute to pangenome diversity, we used SNPs and phylogenetic reconstructions to restrict our quantification of the dynamics of gene repertoires to clades of closely related genomes that diversified within their host following initial colonization of the gut (see STAR Methods , Figures 3 E and S3 , and phylogenetic trees reconstructed in Zhao et al., 2019 85. Zhao, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ∙ Poyet, M. ... Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also controlled for differences in genome set sizes and genome coverage between time points (see STAR Methods and Figure S3 J) and accounted for read coverage information at the individual gene level to derive the final gene presence/absence profile of a given genome (see STAR Methods ). We first quantified the rates at which new genes are gained in the pangenome of these five species between any two time points. For each species in a single individual, we found that the rate of gene acquisition in the pangenome is heterogeneous over time ( Figure 3 F), varying from tens to hundreds of gene gains per year. This suggests that gene transfers do not accumulate in a clock-like fashion, probably because one HGT event can include a single gene or a large plasmid. Our results further show that average rates of gene gain in the pangenome per year are heterogeneous across species; Bacteroides species acquire new genes in their pangenome at higher rates compared to B. longum and A. muciniphila (238 ± 132 genes/year for B. vulgatus , 353 ± 412 genes/year for B. ovatus , and 161 ± 124 genes/year for B. fragilis compared to 74 ± 25 genes/year for B. longum and 34 ± 20 genes/year for A. muciniphila ) ( Figure 3 F; Table S5 ). These rates, which are directly estimated from longitudinal data, mirror those calculated from our cross-sectional inference in Figure 3 A. Using the set of within-person HGTs, we calculated the average HGT frequency across all genome pairs involving either B. vulgatus , B. ovatus , B. fragilis , B. longum , and A. muciniphila . We confirmed that Bacteroides species engage more frequently in HGT compared to B. longum and A. muciniphila , with average HGT frequencies equal to 2.2%, 2.3%, 0.85%, 0.04%, and 0.06% for 10kb+ HGTs in B. vulgatus , B. ovatus , B. fragilis , B. longum , and A. muciniphila , respectively, and 8.6%, 10.1%, 6.0%, 0.81%, and 1.64% for 500bp+ HGTs, respectively. As expected, rates of gene gains are strongly correlated with rates of gene loss ( Figure 3 G; Spearman correlation, S = 1,188, rho = 0.76, p value = 2.3 × 10 −6 ), ultimately maintaining overall proteome sizes ( Mira et al., 2001 46.

Altogether, our results suggest that a variety of gene functions are horizontally exchanged in the gut microbiome of each individual host and at rates that may be sufficiently high to reshape the functions of gut bacterial populations during an individual’s lifetime.
Having found that HGT occurs frequently within individuals, we next investigated the extent to which HGT rates and functions vary across human populations that have different levels of industrialization. For this, we looked at the bacterial species pairs in our dataset that are shared by pairs of population groups along our gradient of industrialization and urbanization, which comprises four lifestyle categories ( Figure 4 A; Tables S1 and S6 ). This approach allowed us to compare populations with both major and more modest differences in lifestyle. This analysis also restricts HGT comparisons to species pairs that are shared between two host populations. As a consequence, we used a more inclusive definition of HGT (the set of 500bp+ HGTs) for this analysis to make up for the loss of statistical power that resulted from comparing populations two at a time.
We found that species pairs sampled in the urban industrialized populations exchanged genes more frequently than when they occurred in the rural nonindustrialized group. The number of observed HGTs found in species pairs of the urban industrialized group was compared to the expected number of events, based on the HGT frequency of the same species pairs in the rural nonindustrialized populations (p value < 2.2 × 10 −308 ) ( Figure 4 B). These results hold whether averaging both within-person and between-people HGTs or only within-person HGTs ( Figure 4 B). We also randomly downsampled the data to control for the unequal sampling of genomes across individual pairs (see statistical analysis in STAR Methods ), which confirmed that observed HGT counts in the urban industrialized group are higher than expected HGT counts (100 random replicates, Welsh t test, t = 225.04, degrees of freedom [df] = 154.8, p value = 1.2 × 10 −196 ; see Table S4 ). To check whether these effects were driven by outlier individuals rather than population-level differences, we shuffled membership of individuals across groups (either by shuffling the lifestyles of individuals or pairs of individuals) and re-ran the analysis; the true urban industrialized cohort still had significantly higher rates of HGT than the randomly created groups (1,000 permutations each, p values < 0.001; see Figure S4 ). This effect also holds when restricting the analysis to each type of subsistence strategy (e.g., hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, or farmer) within the rural nonindustrialized cohort, which we compared individually to the urban industrialized group ( Figures S5 A–S5D).
Along our lifestyle gradient ( Figure 4 A), we consistently found that HGTs are much more frequent among the industrialized and/or urban populations across all pairwise group comparisons ( Figures 4 C and S5 E). This effect was observed across different comparison metrics, such as the average difference in HGT frequency and the count and proportion of species pairs with higher HGT frequency ( Figures 4 D–4F).
We then controlled for different microbial and ecological factors that could confound this effect of lifestyle on HGT frequencies, such as bacterial phylogeny, bacterial cell wall architecture, and, more importantly, differences in species abundances between cohorts. We hypothesized that pairs of highly abundant species in a given ecosystem would have a higher probability of gene exchange compared to pairs involving at least one low-abundance species, independent of their phylogenetic distance. This hypothesis has never been directly tested, because datasets that paired in-depth genomic sampling with accurate abundance estimates did not yet exist. To test the abundance hypothesis, we calculated the average abundance of each bacterial species within each person (see STAR Methods and Figure 1 E). To test for the effect of cell wall architecture, we used reference Gram staining data for each bacterial species as a proxy of cell wall architecture. We used GLME models combined with LRTs on the complete dataset to measure the effect of host lifestyle on HGT frequencies while also accounting for the aforementioned factors (see STAR Methods ). We confirmed a significant association between lifestyle and HGT frequency (n (species pairs) = 10,104; OR for the industrialized lifestyle = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.96–2.03; LRT, χ 2 = 6629.4, p value < 2.2 × 10 −308 ). We also found that species abundance is a strong determinant of HGT (n = 10,104; OR for lowly abundant species = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.39–0.43; LRT, χ 2 = 3225.4, p value < 2.2 × 10 −308 ), even after accounting for the effect of other factors in the GLME models ( Figure 5 A). Abundant bacteria are more likely to engage in HGT with other abundant bacteria, which is consistent with the canonical mechanisms of HGT (e.g., conjugation, transformation, and transduction; Thomas and Nielsen, 2005 74. Thomas, C.M. ∙ Nielsen, K.M. Mechanisms of, and barriers to, horizontal gene transfer between bacteria Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3 :711-721 Crossref Scopus (1467) PubMed Google Scholar ) that involve cell-to-cell contact or access to free DNA in the environment. In addition, we found that Gram-negative bacteria engage more frequently in HGTs than Gram-positive bacteria (N = 10,104; OR for Gram-negative bacteria = 9.2; 95% CI = 6.6–12.8; LRT, χ 2 = 166.3, p value = 4.7 × 10 −38 ; Figure 5 B). This intriguing result motivates further investigation to understand the mechanisms driving increased rates of HGT between intestinal Gram-negative bacteria.
We reasoned that if HGT can occur rapidly in response to changes in host lifestyle, then the type of genes being transferred should reflect the selective pressures associated with different populations ( Brito et al., 2016 7. Brito, I.L. ∙ Yilmaz, S. ∙ Huang, K. ... Mobile genes in the human microbiome are structured from global to individual scales Nature. 2016; 535 :435-439 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). We first compared the profile of HGTs across broadly defined functional categories using species pairs found across different lifestyles. We found significant differences in HGT functions, with the rural nonindustrialized cohort having the most different profile compared to other lifestyles ( Figure 6 ; χ 2 goodness-of-fit test, p values < 0.001).
We then focused on genes involved in key functions that likely differ across populations, such as antibiotic resistance, CAZyme, and virulence genes. We also looked at genes involved in the function of mobile genetic systems (such as phages, plasmids, and transposons). We found that gut bacteria in industrialized populations tend to have higher rates of gene exchange for genes involved in plasmids and transposons ( Figure S6 B; two-proportions Z-tests, corrected p values < 0.001). This finding is consistent with the elevated rates of HGT that we observed in the gut microbiomes of these individuals ( Figure 4 ). In almost all comparisons, nonindustrialized cohorts, who generally consume larger amounts of nondigestible fiber ( Makki et al., 2018 42. Makki, K. ∙ Deehan, E.C. ∙ Walter, J. ... The Impact of Dietary Fiber on Gut Microbiota in Host Health and Disease Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :705-715 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1503) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smits et al., 2017 69. Smits, S.A. ∙ Leach, J. ∙ Sonnenburg, E.D. ... Seasonal cycling in the gut microbiome of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania Science. 2017; 357 :802-806 Crossref Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ), harbored gut bacteria that exchanged CAZyme genes at higher frequencies than individuals living in industrialized and/or urban regions ( Figure 6 ). High transfer rates of antibiotic resistance genes were also found in the gut microbiomes of both urban and rural nonindustrialized populations, which correlates with the higher environmental prevalence of ARGs in low- and middle-income countries ( Hendriksen et al., 2019 31. Hendriksen, R.S. ∙ Munk, P. ∙ Njage, P. ..., Global Sewage Surveillance project consortium Global monitoring of antimicrobial resistance based on metagenomics analyses of urban sewage Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :1124 Crossref Scopus (587) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pehrsson et al., 2016 59. Pehrsson, E.C. ∙ Tsukayama, P. ∙ Patel, S. ... Interconnected microbiomes and resistomes in low-income human habitats Nature. 2016; 533 :212-216 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is further consistent with studies showing that antimicrobial resistance is increasing in livestock from low- and middle-income regions ( Van Boeckel et al., 2019 76. Van Boeckel, T.P. ∙ Pires, J. ∙ Silvester, R. ... Global trends in antimicrobial resistance in animals in low- and middle-income countries Science. 2019; 365 :eaaw1944 Crossref Scopus (613) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We found that the Datoga, Tanzanian pastoralists who primarily raise cattle and consume high levels of meat and dairy products from their animals, had the highest levels of ARG transfers ( Figure S6 C). Like other pastoral farmers in northern Tanzania, they frequently administer antibiotics to their herds ( Caudell et al., 2017 11. Caudell, M.A. ∙ Quinlan, M.B. ∙ Subbiah, M. ... Antimicrobial Use and Veterinary Care among Agro-Pastoralists in Northern Tanzania PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0170328 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sieff, 1999 66. Sieff, D.F. The effects of wealth on livestock dynamics among the Datoga pastoralists of Tanzania Agric. Syst. 1999; 59 :1-25 Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that these recent agricultural practices rapidly altered the fitness landscape in the guts of the Datoga people and have impacted the patterns of gene transfers within their microbiomes. As the use of commercial antimicrobials is now widespread among pastoralist populations in developing countries, similar effects may occur in many populations worldwide, with broader impact on the spread of antimicrobial resistance outside the clinic.

Section: Discussion

This article reports a large-scale genomic investigation of the effects of industrialization and urbanization on HGTs in the human gut microbiome. Taken together, our results suggest that HGT occurs frequently within individual gut microbiomes and with higher frequencies in industrialized populations. These results indicate that transitioning to industrialized (and urban) lifestyles resulted in an increase in gene transfers within the gut microbiome. One possible explanation for this observation could be that increased population density and/or perturbations in the gut ecosystem associated with the consumption of processed foods and increased sanitation promote more frequent gene exchange in the gut microbiome. The overall elevated frequency of HGTs in industrialized microbiomes could also indirectly result from the shifts in microbiome composition that occur when transitioning to industrialized lifestyles ( Vangay et al., 2018 77. Vangay, P. ∙ Johnson, A.J. ∙ Ward, T.L. ... US Immigration Westernizes the Human Gut Microbiome Cell. 2018; 175 :962-972.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (478) PubMed Google Scholar ), resulting in new assortments of species that frequently exchange genes. However, our analyses captured an intrinsic response of bacterial genomes to industrialization, as our HGT estimates were calculated for pairs of species that were present across different lifestyles, in all pairs of population groups under comparison.
Microbiome perturbations that occur during adaptation to industrialization are hypothesized to contribute both to the establishment of low-grade chronic intestinal inflammation in healthy individuals and to the higher incidence of inflammation-associated diseases of the industrialized world, such as inflammatory bowel disease ( Sonnenburg and Sonnenburg, 2019b 72. Sonnenburg, J.L. ∙ Sonnenburg, E.D. Vulnerability of the industrialized microbiota Science. 2019; 366 :eaaw9255 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inflamed environments drive changes in species composition by favoring the bloom of oxygen-tolerant and pathogenic species that are particularly prone to engage in HGT ( Zeng et al., 2017 84. Zeng, M.Y. ∙ Inohara, N. ∙ Nuñez, G. Mechanisms of inflammation-driven bacterial dysbiosis in the gut Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10 :18-26 Crossref Scopus (518) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as Enterobacteriaceae. In a mouse colitis model, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli were previously shown to bloom and to engage in HGT ( Stecher et al., 2012 73. Stecher, B. ∙ Denzler, R. ∙ Maier, L. ... Gut inflammation can boost horizontal gene transfer between pathogenic and commensal Enterobacteriaceae Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :1269-1274 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further investigations are needed to illuminate how inflammation could drive the increase in HGT in the industrialized microbiome.
Numerous studies have investigated how changes in diet and clinical practices, such as fecal microbiota transplants ( Li et al., 2016 39. Li, S.S. ∙ Zhu, A. ∙ Benes, V. ... Durable coexistence of donor and recipient strains after fecal microbiota transplantation Science. 2016; 352 :586-589 Crossref Scopus (398) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smillie et al., 2018 68. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Sauk, J. ∙ Gevers, D. ... Strain Tracking Reveals the Determinants of Bacterial Engraftment in the Human Gut Following Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 23 :229-240.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ), impact the composition of the gut microbiome, but inferring mechanistic understanding from compositional changes is difficult. Our study reveals that HGT within the gut microbiome reflects the unique selective pressures of each human host. Thus, HGT patterns can be used to identify selective forces acting within each individual and thereby to gain a more mechanistic understanding of these events. Our results also show that whole-genome sequencing data provide information on individual microbiome function at a level of precision that popular approaches, such as 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, cannot achieve. Finally, the high rate of HGT in the human gut may be a recent development in response to the industrialized lifestyle, accompanied by changes in the function of genes being exchanged. Further work is needed to appreciate the consequences of these shifts in HGT frequency and function for human health.
Our study has limitations. First, our sampling design did not allow us to quantify rates of gene acquisition in nonindustrialized individuals. Many nonindustrialized populations have seasonal variations in diet and social activities, which are reflected in seasonal variations in microbiome compositions ( Smits et al., 2017 69. Smits, S.A. ∙ Leach, J. ∙ Sonnenburg, E.D. ... Seasonal cycling in the gut microbiome of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania Science. 2017; 357 :802-806 Crossref Scopus (545) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that variations in these environmental factors also impose varying selective pressures on gut bacteria. Investigating such effects on the frequency and patterns of HGTs would greatly contribute to our understanding of how the gut microbiome responds to lifestyle. Second, we did not examine the mechanisms by which lifestyle-associated factors may drive increased HGT in the gut microbiome of industrialized populations.

Research & ethics approvals were obtained from the MIT IRB (protocol #1612797956), as well as in each sampled country prior to the start of sample collection, from the following local ethics committees: Chief Dull Knife College (Montana), protocol #FWA00020985; Comite National d’Ethique de la Recherche pour la Sante Humaine (Cameroon), protocol #2017/05/901/CE/CNERSH/SP; Nunavut Research Institute (Canada), protocol #0205217N-M; National Institute for Medical Research (Tanzania), protocol #NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol. IX/2657; Coordinating Ethics Committee of Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (Finland), protocol #1527/2017; Cape Coast Teaching Hospital Ethical Review Committee (Ghana), protocol #CCTHERC/RS/EC/2016/3; Committee on Human Research, Publication and Ethics of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (Ghana), protocol #CHRPE/AP/398/18; National Health Research Ethics Committee of Nigeria (Nigeria), protocol #NHREC/01/01/2007-29/04/2018.
Samples from 11 additional USA individuals that we previously recruited in the Boston area ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ) were included in the study, providing a dataset of 48 individuals from 15 populations. Both male (54%) and female (46%) participants were recruited. The average age of participants is 33 yo (18-55 yo). We divided our cohort into four groups of different lifestyles: rural non-industrialized, urban non-industrialized, rural industrialized and urban industrialized according to two different parameters: the population density ( SEDAC Population Estimation Service, 2015 64. SEDAC Population Estimation Service https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mapping/popest/pes-v3/ Date: 2015 Google Scholar ), and the level of industrialization based on the Human Development Index at the country level ( United Nations Development Program, 2020 75. United Nations Development Program http://www.hdr.undp.org/en/data Date: 2020 Google Scholar ). Table S1 contains metadata information about each subject enrolled in this study.
Participants produced a fecal sample in a sterile container that was immediately returned to researchers in the field. Raw stool was diluted 1:5 in 25% pre-reduced (anaerobic) glycerol solution containing acid-washed glass beads, and were immediately homogenized and aliquoted into cryogenic 2mL tubes. Stool samples aliquoted in cryoprotectant were immediately flash frozen in the field at −196C, using a cryoshipper tank. Samples were then shipped to MIT for processing, culturing and storage. Table S2 contains culturing information for each bacterial isolate cultured and analyzed in this study.
In this study, we sequenced the genome of 4,149 gut bacterial isolates that we cultured from the stool sample of 37 individuals. We completed our genome dataset with the 3,632 isolate genomes of the BIO-ML collection that we previously generated ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate a total set of 7,781 isolate genomes. Table S2 contains metadata for each of the 7,781 isolates, and Table S5 provides information about the genomes that were used in the longitudinal analysis.
We used the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (QIAGEN) with manufacturers’ protocols to extract microbial genomic DNA from stool samples. Genomic DNA libraries were constructed from 1.2ng of cleaned DNA using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Prior to sequencing, libraries were pooled by collecting equal quantity of each library from batches of 94 samples. Insert sizes and concentrations of each pooled library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies). Paired-end sequencing (2x150-bp reads) was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina Inc) at the Broad Institute.
To culture and isolate the 4,149 bacterial strains generated in this study, we used stool samples collected from 37 individuals across 14 human populations. To obtain an exhaustive representation of the diversity of human gut bacteria, human fecal samples were processed anaerobically at every step in a chamber, using gas monitors controlling physico-chemical conditions (5% Hydrogen, 20% Carbon dioxide, balanced with Nitrogen). Human fecal samples were diluted in pre-reduced PBS (with 0.1% L-cysteine hydrochloride hydrate). Diluted samples were then plated onto pre-reduced agar plates and incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 7 to 14 days. Both general (nonselective) and selective media were used to culture diverse groups of organisms. We used different culturing media, combined with antibiotic, acid, and ethanol treatments to isolate 4,149 bacterial strains. See Table S2 for culturing media used in this study and other metadata for each isolate. After incubation, bacteria were isolated by picking individual colonies with an inoculation loop. They were streaked onto a second pre-reduced agar plate to increase colony purity. After 2 days of incubation at 37°C, one colony was re-streaked again onto a third agar plate for 2 additional days of incubation. One colony from each individual streak was then inoculated in liquid media in a 96-well culture plate. After 2 days of anaerobic incubation at 37°C, the taxonomy of the isolate was identified using 16S rRNA gene Sanger sequencing (starting at the V4 region). We first amplified the full 16S rRNA gene by PCR (27f 5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′ - 1492r 5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′) and then generated a ∼1kb long sequence by Sanger reaction (u515 5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′). All isolates are stored in −80°C freezers in a pre-reduced cryoprotectant glycerol buffer.
We used the DNeasy UltraClean96 MicrobioalKit (QIAGEN) kit to extract whole genome DNA from isolate colonies, following manufacturers’ protocols. Genomic DNA libraries were constructed from 1.2ng of DNA using the Nextera DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer’s protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Prior to sequencing, we pooled on average 250 samples with equal quantities of DNA. Insert size and concentration of each pooled library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies). Paired-end (2x150bp) reads sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (Illumina Inc) at the Broad Institute.
All parameters used to generate whole genome assemblies from 2x150bp paired-end data and used to perform downstream genomic analyses are embedded in the method descriptions below.
Briefly, reads were first demultiplexed using in-house scripts. We used cutadapt v1.12 ( Martin, 2011 43. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10 Crossref Google Scholar ) to remove barcodes and Illumina adapters (with parameters -a CTGTCTCTTAT -A CTGTCTCTTAT). We used Trimmomatic v0.36 ( Bolger et al., 2014 5. Bolger, A.M. ∙ Lohse, M. ∙ Usadel, B. Trimmomatic: a flexible trimmer for Illumina sequence data Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2114-2120 Crossref Scopus (38307) PubMed Google Scholar ) for the quality filtering of data (with parameters PE -phred33 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:5:20 MINLEN:50). Reads were assembled de novo into contigs using SPAdes v.3.9.1 ( Bankevich et al., 2012 2. Bankevich, A. ∙ Nurk, S. ∙ Antipov, D. ... SPAdes: a new genome assembly algorithm and its applications to single-cell sequencing J. Comput. Biol. 2012; 19 :455-477 Crossref Scopus (17085) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with parameter–careful). To iteratively improve genome assemblies, we used SSPACE v3.0 ( Boetzer et al., 2011 4. Boetzer, M. ∙ Henkel, C.V. ∙ Jansen, H.J. ... Scaffolding pre-assembled contigs using SSPACE Bioinformatics. 2011; 27 :578-579 Crossref Scopus (1788) PubMed Google Scholar ) and GapFiller v1-10 ( Nadalin et al., 2012 50. Nadalin, F. ∙ Vezzi, F. ∙ Policriti, A. GapFiller: a de novo assembly approach to fill the gap within paired reads BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13 :S8 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ) to scaffold contigs and to fill sequence gaps (with default parameters). Scaffolds smaller than 1kb were removed from genome assemblies. We aligned all reads back to the assembly to compute genome coverage using BBmap v37.68 ( https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/ ) and the covstats option (with default parameters). The final assemblies were annotated using Prokka v1.12 ( Seemann, 2014 65. Seemann, T. Prokka: rapid prokaryotic genome annotation Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :2068-2069 Crossref Scopus (10433) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with default parameters).
We measured genome assembly statistics using CheckM v1.0.7 ( Parks et al., 2015 57. Parks, D.H. ∙ Imelfort, M. ∙ Skennerton, C.T. ... CheckM: assessing the quality of microbial genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, and metagenomes Genome Res. 2015; 25 :1043-1055 Crossref Scopus (6238) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with parameters lineage_wf–tab_table -x fna Prokka_annotations/). All summary and quality statistics can be found in Table S2 . The median assembly completeness of all 7,781 genomes is 99.33%, the median contamination is 0.3%, the median scaffold N50 is 144kb, and the median coverage is 120X.
We used whole genomic information to group genomes into species clusters. We used an open-reference approach and computed all-against-all genomic distances using Mash ( Ondov et al., 2016 54. Ondov, B.D. ∙ Treangen, T.J. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Mash: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash Genome Biol. 2016; 17 :132 Crossref Scopus (1634) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with default parameters). A Mash distance lower than 0.05 is equivalent to using an Average Nucleotide Identity higher than 95%, which is a standard threshold for delineating species ( Konstantinidis and Tiedje, 2005 36. Konstantinidis, K.T. ∙ Tiedje, J.M. Genomic insights that advance the species definition for prokaryotes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :2567-2572 Crossref Scopus (1514) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used an unsupervised hierarchical clustering approach to group genomes that had Mash distances ≤ 0.05 into taxonomic units using the bClust function from the micropan R package ( Snipen and Liland, 2015 70. Snipen, L. ∙ Liland, K.H. micropan: an R-package for microbial pan-genomics BMC Bioinformatics. 2015; 16 :79 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then measured the genetic distance between the representative genome of each species cluster (defined as the genome with the highest N50) and 79,226 non-contaminated complete and draft genomes downloaded from the NCBI FTP repository ( ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ ) on March 27th, 2017 ( NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2016 52. NCBI Resource Coordinators Database resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :D7-D19 Crossref Scopus (1162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clusters with a Mash distance to NCBI genomes lower than 0.05 were assigned the taxonomy of the closest reference genome (we manually curated Mash results to assign a taxonomy to each cluster when NCBI taxonomies were incomplete or incorrect). All genome taxonomies are compiled in Table S2 .
We compared the GMbC genome collection to the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) database, which comprises the largest set of human gut bacterial genomes, with the vast majority being metagenome-assembled genomes from uncultivated bacterial species ( Almeida et al., 2021 1. Almeida, A. ∙ Nayfach, S. ∙ Boland, M. ... A unified catalog of 204,938 reference genomes from the human gut microbiome Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :105-114 Crossref Scopus (535) PubMed Google Scholar ). We measured genomic distances between our representative genomes and all UHGG representative genomes with Mash, and counted the number of species that had not been previously sequenced or cultured, using a Mash threshold of 0.05.
To reconstruct the phylogenomic tree of all 7,781 genomes, we first built a concatenated alignment of 47 nearly universal and single-copy ribosomal protein families. We used Diamond v0.8.22.84 ( Buchfink et al., 2015 9. Buchfink, B. ∙ Xie, C. ∙ Huson, D.H. Fast and sensitive protein alignment using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :59-60 Crossref Scopus (7181) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with parameters blastx —more-sensitive -e 0.000001 —id 35 —query-cover 80) to BLAST all 7,781 proteomes against the RiboDB database (v1.4.1) of bacterial ribosomal protein genes ( Jauffrit et al., 2016 34. Jauffrit, F. ∙ Penel, S. ∙ Delmotte, S. ... RiboDB Database: A Comprehensive Resource for Prokaryotic Systematics Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33 :2170-2172 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). We excluded proteins bL17, bS16, bS21, uL22, uS3 and uS4, as they were not sufficiently distributed across all genomes. In each RiboDB gene family, we excluded genomes that contained gene duplicates. Then, we aligned all protein families individually with Mafft v7.310 ( Nakamura et al., 2018 51. Nakamura, T. ∙ Yamada, K.D. ∙ Tomii, K. ... Parallelization of MAFFT for large-scale multiple sequence alignments Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :2490-2492 Crossref Scopus (581) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with parameter —auto). We filtered out misaligned sites using BMGE v1.12 ( Criscuolo and Gribaldo, 2010 13. Criscuolo, A. ∙ Gribaldo, S. BMGE (Block Mapping and Gathering with Entropy): a new software for selection of phylogenetic informative regions from multiple sequence alignments BMC Evol. Biol. 2010; 10 :210 Crossref Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ) (with parameters -t AA -g 0.95 -m BLOSUM30) and concatenated all individual alignments using Seaview v4.7 ( Gouy et al., 2010 28. Gouy, M. ∙ Guindon, S. ∙ Gascuel, O. SeaView version 4: A multiplatform graphical user interface for sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27 :221-224 Crossref Scopus (4587) PubMed Google Scholar ). We reconstructed the phylogenomic tree using FastTree v2.1.10 (with parameters -lg –gamma) ( Price et al., 2010 61. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree 2--approximately maximum-likelihood trees for large alignments PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e9490 Crossref Scopus (9016) PubMed Google Scholar ). To reconstruct phylogenetic trees of B. vulgatus , B. ovatus , B. longum and A. muciniphila ( Figure 3 and Figure S3 ), we reconstructed the alignment of core protein-coding genes with Roary v3.11.2 ( Page et al., 2015 55. Page, A.J. ∙ Cummins, C.A. ∙ Hunt, M. ... Roary: rapid large-scale prokaryote pan genome analysis Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3691-3693 Crossref Scopus (3170) PubMed Google Scholar ), removed recombining regions with Gubbins v2.2.0 ( Croucher et al., 2015 14. Croucher, N.J. ∙ Page, A.J. ∙ Connor, T.R. ... Rapid phylogenetic analysis of large samples of recombinant bacterial whole genome sequences using Gubbins Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e15 Crossref Scopus (1443) PubMed Google Scholar ), extracted SNPs with SNP-sites v2.4.1 ( Page et al., 2016 56. Page, A.J. ∙ Taylor, B. ∙ Delaney, A.J. ... SNP-sites : rapid efficient extraction of SNPs from multi-FASTA alignments Microb. Genom. 2016; 2 :e000056 Crossref Scopus (752) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inferred the tree with FastTree.
In this study, we focus on transfers occurring between bacterial species, ignoring within-species gene recombination events. We looked for gene transfers that occurred between genomes of different bacterial species. We used Blast (blastn, v2.6.0) ( Camacho et al., 2009 10. Camacho, C. ∙ Coulouris, G. ∙ Avagyan, V. ... BLAST+: architecture and applications BMC Bioinformatics. 2009; 10 :421 Crossref Scopus (12201) PubMed Google Scholar ) to systematically detect blocks of DNA that are shared by two genomes of different species. We retained blast hits with 100% similarity and that are larger than 500bp. To further increase the likelihood of looking at transfer events that occurred on timescales compatible with human lifetime, we focused many of our analyses on transferred blocks that are larger than 10kb. To remove putative contaminants from our set of blast hits when calculating HGT frequencies, we removed HGTs that involve contigs with both k-mer assembly coverage lower than 3 (as provided by SPAdes) and a relative read coverage lower than 0.2 compared to the average genome coverage in at least one of the two compared genomes.
Assuming a genome size in the order of 10 6 bp and molecular clock of 1 SNP/genome/year ( Didelot et al., 2016 16. Didelot, X. ∙ Walker, A.S. ∙ Peto, T.E. ... Within-host evolution of bacterial pathogens Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14 :150-162 Crossref Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ; Drake, 1991 17. Drake, J.W. A constant rate of spontaneous mutation in DNA-based microbes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88 :7160-7164 Crossref Scopus (885) PubMed Google Scholar ; Duchêne et al., 2016 18. Duchêne, S. ∙ Holt, K.E. ∙ Weill, F.-X. ... Genome-scale rates of evolutionary change in bacteria Microb. Genom. 2016; 2 :e000094 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhao et al., 2019 85. Zhao, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ∙ Poyet, M. ... Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), HGTs larger than 500bp with > 99% similarity are consistent with transfer events that occurred between 0 and 10,000 years ago: this time interval corresponds to the time during which a 500bp sequence can accumulate a maximum of 1% sequence divergence, i.e., 5 SNPs. When considering 10kb+ HGTs with 100% similarity, it would take 1 year for a 10kb HGT to accumulate 10 −2 SNPs, which corresponds to taking 100 years to experience 1 SNP and to be filtered out from our analysis. As such, our 10kb+ HGTs, which do not contain any mutations, correspond to events that occurred between 0 and ∼100 years ago.
To avoid inflating estimations of HGT counts and frequencies, we did not consider the absolute number of distinct blast hits between two genomes, as poor assembly or genomic processes, such as transposition, might result in splitting a single large HGT into many smaller apparent HGT events. Instead, we used a conservative approach to quantify HGTs that was previously published ( Smillie et al., 2011 67. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Smith, M.B. ∙ Friedman, J. ... Ecology drives a global network of gene exchange connecting the human microbiome Nature. 2011; 480 :241-244 Crossref Scopus (631) PubMed Google Scholar ), defining the HGT count as the number of between-species genome pairs that share at least one HGT (either one 500bp+ or 10kb+ HGT). To measure the frequency of HGT between two species, we then divided the HGT count by the total number of between-species genome pairs.
To simulate the fraction of 100% similar HGTs seen in the present generation 0 (HGT 0 s) that would result from HGT events that occurred in past generation, we simulated a population of constant size with N species in each individual. As the median number of species in the microbiome of our sampled individuals is 187 based on Kraken2 metagenomic profiles, we fixed N = 200. At each generation, each pair of species had an H% probability to engage in HGT. In our dataset, the average proportion of species pairs engaging in HGT is 0.885. We then chose to fix H to 9%. In a previous report ( Ferretti et al., 2018 20. Ferretti, P. ∙ Pasolli, E. ∙ Tett, A. ... Mother-to-Infant Microbial Transmission from Different Body Sites Shapes the Developing Infant Gut Microbiome Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :133-145.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (744) PubMed Google Scholar ), the intergenerational mother-to-infant rate of strain transmission was found to be 16%. In our simulation, we compared a 16% rate of species transmission to the next host generation to a more extreme rate of 50%. So each species had a probability to transmit into the next generation drawn from one of two possible distributions: • B (2,11), each species probability to transmit into offspring was chosen from a Beta distribution with parameters ⍺ = 2 and β = 11 • B (2,2), each species probability to transmit into offspring was chosen from a Beta distribution with parameters ⍺ = 2 and β = 2
We chose a Beta distribution to allow for some species to have an increased probability to transfer into later generations, even though the overall average was fixed at ∼16% for B (2,11) and 50% for B (2,2).
We then run the simulation across 5 generations, and recorded the generation of origin of each HGT. At the last generation (generation 0, corresponding to the generation at present time), we calculated the fraction of observed HGTs in the microbiome that occurred at each generation. We run 100 simulation replicates for each possible distribution of vertical transmission of strains into offspring. Simulations were run in Python.
We used Prokka gene annotations and Roary to reconstruct the core-genome alignment and the host individual-specific gene repertoires for B. vulgatus , B. ovatus , B. longum and A. muciniphila genomes that were longitudinally sampled in individual am ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), and for B. fragilis genomes that were longitudinally sampled in individuals L01, L03, L04, L05, L06, L07 ( Zhao et al., 2019 85. Zhao, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ∙ Poyet, M. ... Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). Note that individual am from ( Poyet et al., 2019 60. Poyet, M. ∙ Groussin, M. ∙ Gibbons, S.M. ... A library of human gut bacterial isolates paired with longitudinal multiomics data enables mechanistic microbiome research Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1442-1452 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ) and L01 from ( Zhao et al., 2019 85. Zhao, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ∙ Poyet, M. ... Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ) are the same individual. We used the following options with Roary: -e -n -z -i 90 -cd 95. We restricted our analysis to closely-related genomes that diversified within the host of origin upon colonization of the gut: genomes from individual am differed by 111, 42, 2,328 and 338 SNPs for B. vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. longum and A. muciniphila , respectively. When looking at genomes from all host individuals, isolate genomes differed by 68,746, 202,262, 51,064 and 33,793 SNPs, respectively. In addition, all B. fragilis genomes from the same individual differed by less than 100 SNPs, while those from different individuals differed by more than 10,000 SNPs ( Zhao et al., 2019 85. Zhao, S. ∙ Lieberman, T.D. ∙ Poyet, M. ... Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 25 :656-667.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). This pattern suggests that we are only including closely-related genomes, limiting the potential impact of co-colonization of different major lineages or strain replacement on the analysis of the dynamics of gene gain and loss over time. We filtered genomes that had genome completeness as measured by CheckM below 99% out of the gene tables. For each species within each individual, we excluded genomes with low average coverage. With the final set of genomes, we checked whether the genome coverage was different across time points, as this could bias estimations of gene presence/absence profiles and gene gain/loss rates in pangenomes. We found that, for each species within each individual, genome coverage was homogeneous across time points (Kruskal-Wallis tests, see Figure S3 J). Genome assemblies used to calculate gene gain and loss rates for each species within each individual is listed in Table S5 .
Because of assembly errors, genes truly ‘present’ in a genome may not have been detected in the assembly by Prokka, and were later called ‘absent’ by Roary. We confirmed the presence and absence of genes in a given genome by mapping reads of each genome onto each gene sequence inferred by Prokka. For genes initially called ‘absent’ in a given genome but ‘present’ in other genomes, we used a representative sequence of this gene for mapping. To call for the presence of a gene in a genome, genes must be covered by a minimum of 20 reads over 90% of their length, and have a minimum relative coverage of 0.2 compared to the average genome coverage. To call ‘present’ a gene that was initially called ‘absent’, the gene was also required to have less than 30% ambiguous mappings to be called ‘present’, in addition to the criteria listed above.
To measure rates of gene gain and loss in the pangenome of each species between two time points, we identified the set of gene families that were absent in all genomes at initial sampling and present in at least 1 genome at the later time point. We repeated this procedure for all pairs of time points, and we normalized the rates of gene gain and loss to a number of events per year. We employed the same strategy for calculating rates of gene loss. When measuring differences in pangenome gene repertoires between two time points, we downsampled genomes at each time point to perform comparisons with the same number of genomes.
Metagenomic data were quality-filtered with Trim Galore v0.5.0 and Trimmomatic (same options as with isolate genomic sequencing data), dereplicated with FastUniq v1.1 ( Xu et al., 2012 79. Xu, H. ∙ Luo, X. ∙ Qian, J. ... FastUniq: a fast de novo duplicates removal tool for paired short reads PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e52249 Crossref Scopus (386) PubMed Google Scholar ) (default parameters) and mapped against the hg38 human reference genome with BWA v0.7.13 ( Li and Durbin, 2009 38. Li, H. ∙ Durbin, R. Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (32752) PubMed Google Scholar ) (default options) to remove human reads. We used Kraken2 v2.0.8-beta ( Wood et al., 2019 78. Wood, D.E. ∙ Lu, J. ∙ Langmead, B. Improved metagenomic analysis with Kraken 2 Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :257 Crossref Scopus (2660) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default options and the Kraken2 database to call for taxonomies. We then used Bracken v2.5 ( Lu et al., 2017 41. Lu, J. ∙ Breitwieser, F.P. ∙ Thielen, P. ... Bracken: estimating species abundance in metagenomics data PeerJ Comput. Sci. 2017; 3 :e104 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ) to refine Kraken2 taxonomic profiles at the species level, with the following options: -t 20 -k 35 -l 150. We rarefied the OTU (species) table, by downsampling reads to the minimum number of reads among all samples. We measured beta-diversities with the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric using the ‘vegdist’ function from the ‘vegan’ R package ( Oksanen et al., 2019 53. Oksanen, J. ∙ Blanchet, F.G. ∙ Friendly, M. ... vegan: Community Ecology Package 2019 https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html Google Scholar ). Metagenomic data were not used to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes, as only genome assemblies generated from isolate bacteria were analyzed in this study.
We measured average species abundances of isolates within each individual host. For species with more than five isolate genomes per individual, we randomly selected 5 genomes to compute the average abundance. For species with less than five isolate per individual, we used all isolates to calculate the average abundance. We mapped metagenomic data generated from the same individual host against each isolate genome, and used the per base coverage K, the average read length L, the size of each genome S and the total number of reads T in the shotgun data to calculate the relative abundance A of each genome in the metagenome with A = (K ∗ S/L) / T. We used a threshold of 1% to define lowly and highly abundant bacteria. Results on the effect of abundance on HGT frequency ( Figure 5 A) hold true when using a 5% threshold to define high abundance (GLME, OR for lowly abundant species = 0.47; CI (95%) = 0.45 - 0.48; LRT, χ2 = 2668.1, p value = 1.5x10 -71 ).
We used Gram staining data from reference microbiology databases (ATCC, https://www.lgcstandards-atcc.org:443/en.aspx ; DSMZ, https://www.dsmz.de/ ) & the Microbe Directory database ( https://microbe.directory ) and from publications characterizing the phenotype of bacterial isolates to assign a consensus Gram stain to each of our bacterial species. Species with contradictory Gram staining information or with unknown taxonomy were excluded from the analysis of the correlation between HGT frequency and cell wall architecture. Our data recapitulate what we know from the literature ( Garrity, 2005 23. Garrity, G.

Functional annotation followed the basic approach described previously ( Brito et al., 2016 7. Brito, I.L. ∙ Yilmaz, S. ∙ Huang, K. ... Mobile genes in the human microbiome are structured from global to individual scales Nature. 2016; 535 :435-439 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, CDS were assigned to all 500bp+ HGTs using Prodigal v2.6.3 ( Brito et al., 2016 7. Brito, I.L. ∙ Yilmaz, S. ∙ Huang, K. ... Mobile genes in the human microbiome are structured from global to individual scales Nature. 2016; 535 :435-439 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hyatt et al., 2010 33. Hyatt, D. ∙ Chen, G.-L. ∙ Locascio, P.F. ... Prodigal: prokaryotic gene recognition and translation initiation site identification BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :119 Crossref Scopus (6812) PubMed Google Scholar ) in metagenome mode to capture gene fragments. The resultant CDS were dereplicated and clustered at 90% nucleotide identity using vsearch v2.3.4 ( Rognes et al., 2016 62. Rognes, T. ∙ Flouri, T. ∙ Nichols, B. ... VSEARCH: a versatile open source tool for metagenomics PeerJ. 2016; 4 :e2584 Crossref Scopus (6119) PubMed Google Scholar ). These gene centroids were used for subsequent functional annotation steps. Both eggNOG-mapper ( Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017 32. Huerta-Cepas, J. ∙ Forslund, K. ∙ Coelho, L.P. ... Fast Genome-Wide Functional Annotation through Orthology Assignment by eggNOG-Mapper Mol. Biol. Evol. 2017; 34 :2115-2122 Crossref Scopus (1672) PubMed Google Scholar ) and InterProScan v5.36-75.0 ( Jones et al., 2014 35. Jones, P. ∙ Binns, D. ∙ Chang, H.-Y. ... InterProScan 5: genome-scale protein function classification Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1236-1240 Crossref Scopus (5123) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used to assign putative function predictions to gene centroids. For additional classification of antibiotic resistance genes and carbohydrate active enzymes, hmmer3 v3.1b2 ( Mistry et al., 2013 47. Mistry, J. ∙ Finn, R.D. ∙ Eddy, S.R. ... Challenges in homology search: HMMER3 and convergent evolution of coiled-coil regions Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :e121 Crossref Scopus (1021) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used with the Resfam ( Gibson et al., 2015 26. Gibson, M.K. ∙ Forsberg, K.J. ∙ Dantas, G. Improved annotation of antibiotic resistance determinants reveals microbial resistomes cluster by ecology ISME J. 2015; 9 :207-216 Crossref Scopus (469) PubMed Google Scholar ) and dbCAN ( Yin et al., 2012 82. Yin, Y. ∙ Mao, X. ∙ Yang, J. ... dbCAN: a web resource for automated carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 :W445-51 Crossref Scopus (1277) PubMed Google Scholar ) hmm databases with a cutoff e-value of 1e -5 and score of 22. Text mining with a set of regular functional annotations that we previously used ( Brito et al., 2016 7. Brito, I.L. ∙ Yilmaz, S. ∙ Huang, K. ... Mobile genes in the human microbiome are structured from global to individual scales Nature. 2016; 535 :435-439 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) was employed to determine the assignment of genes into the following categories: phage, plasmid, transposons, and antibiotic resistance.
To investigate whether, within people, bacterial species engage in the transfer of gene functions that may impact bacterial metabolism or host physiology, we looked at within-person transferred genes involved in antibiotic resistance (ARG), carbohydrate degradation (CAZyme) and virulence. We chose these functions in part because they seemed likely to reflect relevant selective pressures in the human host, and also because there exist well curated databases of annotated genes. In Figure 3 D (‘Upset’ plot), each row corresponds to a function set, and each column corresponds to an interaction configuration. Empty cells (light-gray) indicate that the set is not part of the intersection, and filled (black) cells show sets that participate in the intersection. Barplots on the top and right of the matrix layout show absolute counts of species pairs for each intersection and each set, respectively.
When the R output of a p value calculation equalled to 0, we used the smallest double-precision machine number, which is 2.2 ∗ 10 −308 . Such p values are shown with an asterisk in figures.
Statistical analyses were performed in R. When comparing HGTs between two categories, e.g., within-person versus between-people or Urban industrialized versus Rural non-industrialized, the numbers of genome and individual pairs for any pair of bacterial species that were sampled are different between the two categories. This difference in sampling could interfere with comparisons of HGT frequencies. To correct for differences in sampling, we employed the following approach. Consider the comparison of within-person to between-people HGTs: we calculated, for each species pair, the observed within-person HGT count (corresponding to the number of within-person genome comparisons with at least 1 HGT) and the expected within-person HGT count based on the between-people HGT frequency of the same species pair. We then summed observed and expected HGT counts across all species pairs and compared the observed total HGT count within individual people to its expected value based on the amount of transfer seen between individuals, and calculated a p value using the Poisson distribution (ppois R function). The same approach was used to compare HGT counts of the same species pairs found in different cohorts that have different lifestyles ( Figure 4 ), for instance to compare counts of HGT in the Urban & Industrialized cohort to the Rural & Non-industrialized cohort. This approach allows us to control for differences in the number of genome, species and individual pairs sampled between two compared cohorts (within-person versus between-people or Urban & Industrialized versus Rural & Non-industrialized). Note that when measuring the effect of lifestyle on HGT, observed HGTs, expected HGTs and p values were calculated for each pair of cohorts (4 lifestyle categories, 6 cohort pairs in total). Also, as this analysis is a-symmetrical, we also performed all our tests in the other direction, i.e., testing whether the observed between-people HGT count is lower than the expected between-people HGT count based on within-person HGT frequencies (118,210 versus 671,160, p value < 2.2 ∗ 10 −308 ); and whether the observed Rural & Industrialized HGT count is lower than the expected count based on Urban & Industrialized HGT frequencies (42,254 versus 66,276, p value < 2.2 ∗ 10 −308 ).
We also controlled for the effect of including multiple genome pairs of the same species pairs sampled in individuals when comparing total observed and expected HGT counts. We downsampled our dataset by randomly drawing a single genome pair per species pair and per individual pair. We run this control for the comparison of within-person to between-people HGTs, and for the comparison of Urban & Industrialized (UI) to Rural & Non-industrialized (RN) HGTs. For each comparison, we run 100 random replicates. For each replicate, we calculated the total observed and expected HGT counts for the within-person category or the UI group, as described above. We then compared the distributions of observed and expected HGTs with a Welsh t test. Results are shown in Table S4 .
The population frequency of a given mobile gene carried by a 10kb+ HGT detected in a given species and in a given individual was calculated by counting the number of genomes carrying this mobile gene, divided by the total number of genomes of this species in this individual. Only species with a minimum of 10 genomes in each individual were included.
To measure the difference between within-person and between-people HGT across phylogenetic distance bins ( Figure 3 B), we compared for each separate bin the total observed within-person HGT count across all species pairs to its expected count value based on the between-people HGT frequencies of the same species pairs in that bin, with a Poisson distribution. P values were then combined into a single p value with Fisher’s method (‘sumlog’ function from the ‘metap’ R package).
To control for the effect of in vitro culturing on the estimation of within-person HGTs and its comparison with between-people HGTs, we used our set of 10kb+ HGTs to test (i) whether within-person HGTs are more frequent when genome pairs are sampled from the same versus different culturing plates and (ii) for genome pairs isolated from the same plate, whether HGTs are more frequent when genome pairs are sampled from a media containing antibiotics. These tests control for (i) HGTs that may occur during the culturing on the plate and (ii) HGTs that may be triggered by antibiotics present in the media. We compared HGTs for all bacterial species pairs from each individual host that were sampled in both categories of each of the aforementioned variables being tested. As we are comparing HGTs for genome pairs from the same species pairs sampled from the same individual, we do not need to control for differences in bacterial phylogenetic distances or abundances. We compared the total observed HGT counts for genome pairs cultured within the same plate to its total expected value based on the HGT frequency of genome pairs of the same species being cultured from different plates, using a Poisson distribution. We used the same approach for genome pairs being grown on antibiotic-containing media versus without antibiotics. We also correlated observed to expected HGT counts for each species pair using a Pearson correlation. Finally, we also compared within-plate to between-plate HGT frequencies and with-antibiotics versus without-antibiotics HGT frequencies using paired Wilcoxon tests. All results are shown in Table S4 .
We also used a permutation test to compare HGTs in two cohorts of different lifestyles. We defined the statistic S = (HGTcounts_observed - HGTcounts_expected) / HGTcounts_expected. For the more industrialized and urban cohort, HGTcounts_observed > HGTcounts_expected. We tested if the difference between observed and expected counts is higher with real data than under a null hypothesis. We computed the null distribution of S by rearranging the lifestyle labels of either each individual participant, or each pair of participant before calculating average HGT frequencies. The value of S obtained with real data was then compared to the null distribution to calculate the p value. Null distributions of S for these tests are shown in Figure S4 .
The effect of phylogeny on HGT frequency was measured using Generalized Linear Mixed Effects (GLME) models, assuming an intercept that is different for each pair of species. We also accounted for the effects of bacterial abundance and cell-wall architecture (Gram-negative versus Gram-positive) in the models. We used the lme4 R package ( Bates et al., 2015 3. Bates, D. ∙ Mächler, M. ∙ Bolker, B. ... Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Usinglme4 J. Stat. Softw. 2015; 67 :1-48 Crossref Scopus (53083) Google Scholar ) (glmer function) to fit the GLME models, and used Likelihood Ratio Tests (with the lmtest package and the lrtest function; Zeileis and Hothorn, 2002 83. Zeileis, A. ∙ Hothorn, T. Diagnostic Checking in Regression Relationships R News. 2002; 2 :7-10 Google Scholar ) to calculate the p value for phylogeny. Confident intervals for odds ratios were calculated with the Wald method.
We defined the following variables: • phylogeny: Continuous variable. Phylogenetic distance between two species derived from the phylogenomic tree shown in Figure 2 A. • abundance: Discrete variable. Abundance category for each pair of species in each sampled host individual, derived from the abundance category of each individual species. We used a threshold of 1% relative abundance to classify species as highly or lowly abundant in each individual. • gram_staining: Discrete variable. Gram staining category for each pair of species derived from the individual Gram staining of each individual species. • hgt_freqs: Continuous variable. Average within-person HGT frequency for each individual species pair. Average within-person HGT frequencies were calculated for each population separately, to account for population-level differences. • species_pairs: Discrete variable. Names of species pairs. Because we calculated within-person HGT frequencies on a per-population basis, a given species pair can be represented multiple times in the model. We accounted for this by considering the variable species_pairs as a random effect term in the GLME models.
We fitted the following models, with HGT frequencies either derived from the dataset of 10kb+ HGTs or from the dataset of 500bp+ HGTs: model1 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼phylogeny + abundance + gram_staining + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”) model2 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼abundance ∗ gram_staining + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”)
To assess whether phylogeny is significantly contributing to HGTs, we performed the following LRT: Phylogeny: LRT_phylogeny = lrtest(model1, model2)
To measure the effect of lifestyle on HGT with the dataset of 500bp+ HGTs, while controlling for the effects of phylogeny, abundance and cell-wall architecture, we defined the discrete variable ‘lifestyle’ as the level of host industrialization associated with the sampled species pair (i.e., ‘industrialized’ or ‘non-industrialized’), and run the following GLME models: model3 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼phylogeny + abundance + gram_staining + lifestyle + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”) model4 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼abundance + gram_staining + lifestyle + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”) model5 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼phylogeny + gram_staining + lifestyle + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”) model6 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼phylogeny + abundance + lifestyle + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”) model7 = glmer(hgt_freqs ∼phylogeny + abundance + gram_staining + (1|species_pairs), family = ”binomial”)
We run the following LRTs to evaluate the contribution of each factor to HGT: Phylogeny: LRT_phylogeny = lrtest(model3, model4) Abundance: LRT_abundance = lrtest(model3, model5) Cell-wall architecture: LRT_cell-wall = lrtest(model3, model6) Lifestyle: LRT_lifestyle = lrtest(model3, model7)
Profiles of COG functional categories were compared using a chi-square Goodness-of-fit test (chisq.test function). HGT frequencies of phage, plasmid, transposon, ARG, CAZyme and Virulence genes were compared between host populations of different lifestyles ( Figure 6 ) using two-proportions Z-tests (prop.test function), and a Bonferroni correction for multiple tests (p.adjust function).
LOESS regressions were calculated with the ggplot2 package ( Figures 3 and 5 ). HGT frequencies at phylogenetic distances lower than the smallest between-species distances (left part of the curves) are extrapolated. Bands represent confidence intervals calculated from the standard errors.
