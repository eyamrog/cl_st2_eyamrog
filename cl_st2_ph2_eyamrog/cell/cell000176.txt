Title: Elevated Calprotectin and Abnormal Myeloid Cell Subsets Discriminate Severe from Mild COVID-19


Abstract: Summary

Blood myeloid cells are known to be dysregulated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is unknown whether the innate myeloid response differs with disease severity and whether markers of innate immunity discriminate high-risk patients. Thus, we performed high-dimensional flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient peripheral blood cells and detected disappearance of non-classical CD14 Low CD16 High monocytes, accumulation of HLA-DR Low classical monocytes (Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype), and release of massive amounts of calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) in severe cases. Immature CD10 Low CD101 − CXCR4 +/− neutrophils with an immunosuppressive profile accumulated in the blood and lungs, suggesting emergency myelopoiesis. Finally, we show that calprotectin plasma level and a routine flow cytometry assay detecting decreased frequencies of non-classical monocytes could discriminate patients who develop a severe form of COVID-19, suggesting a predictive value that deserves prospective evaluation.

Section: Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which infects the lungs, leading to fever, cough, and dyspnea ( Guan and Zhong, 2020 25. Guan, W.J. ∙ Zhong, N.S. Clinical Characteristics of Covid-19 in China. Reply N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :1861-1862 Crossref Scopus (20496) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most patients presenting with mild disease develop an efficient immune response ( Thevarajan et al., 2020 59. Thevarajan, I. ∙ Nguyen, T.H.O. ∙ Koutsakos, M. ... Breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :453-455 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ), but some go on to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), often culminating in multi-organ dysfunction and death ( Wang et al., 2020 67. Wang, T. ∙ Du, Z. ∙ Zhu, F. ... Comorbidities and multi-organ injuries in the treatment of COVID-19 Lancet. 2020; 395 :e52 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (439) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In addition to cell-autonomous effects of the viral infection, a dysregulated immune response participates in the sudden deterioration of COVID-19 patients, ultimately overwhelming infected and non-infected tissues ( Vabret et al., 2020 62. Vabret, N. ∙ Samstein, R. ∙ Fernandez, N. ..., Sinai Immunology Review Project, Trainees, Faculty Advancing scientific knowledge in times of pandemics Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20 :338 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). This overt inflammatory response centers around a cytokine storm ( Chen et al., 2020a 10. Chen, G. ∙ Wu, D. ∙ Guo, W. ... Clinical and immunological features of severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :2620-2629 Crossref Scopus (3387) PubMed Google Scholar ) with elevated blood concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Accordingly, therapeutic agents targeting the IL-6/IL-6R-gp130 axis can alleviate the inflammatory response ( Michot et al., 2020 43. Michot, J.M. ∙ Albiges, L. ∙ Chaput, N. ...

Oncol. 2020; 31 :961-964 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ameliorate immune dysregulation ( Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020 23. Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.J. ∙ Netea, M.G. ∙ Rovina, N. ... Complex Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Patients with Severe Respiratory Failure Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :992-1000.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1471) PubMed Google Scholar ), emphasizing the clinical significance of this cytokine. Marked lymphocytopenia is also associated with COVID-19 severity ( Chen et al., 2020a 10. Chen, G. ∙ Wu, D. ∙ Guo, W. ... Clinical and immunological features of severe and moderate coronavirus disease 2019 J. Clin. Invest. 2020; 130 :2620-2629 Crossref Scopus (3387) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, the primary source of the cytokine storm and of the mechanisms behind lymphocytopenia remains elusive ( Li et al., 2020 38.

A growing body of evidence points to dysregulation of innate immune cells of the granulomonocytic lineage during viral infections of the lungs. A variety of human viruses infect monocytes and macrophages to spread through the tissues ( Al-Qahtani et al., 2017 2. Al-Qahtani, A.A. ∙ Lyroni, K. ∙ Aznaourova, M. ...

SARS-coronavirus replication in human peripheral monocytes/macrophages Virus Res. 2005; 107 :93-101 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is detectable in lung monocytes/macrophages of severe COVID-19 patients ( Bost et al., 2020 6. Bost, P. ∙ Giladi, A. ∙ Liu, Y. ... Host-Viral Infection Maps Reveal Signatures of Severe COVID-19 Patients Cell. 2020; 181 :1475-1488.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ), but its ability to enter these cells in the peripheral blood and activate them directly remains unclear. Also, tissue damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to release of pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns that, in turn, induce activation and recruitment of inflammatory cytokine- and chemokine-producing innate immune cells in an amplifying loop ( Liao et al., 2020 39. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (1657) PubMed Google Scholar ).
It remains unclear to what extent immune patterns associated with COVID-19 pathophysiology are causative and exacerbate the disease and/or could be used for accurate patient stratification. Here, using high-dimensional single-cell approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing, mass cytometry, and 25-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we show that patients who develop severe disease exhibit a massive release of S100A8/S100A9 calprotectin accompanied by changes in monocyte and neutrophil subsets. We further discover that this pathological immune system reorganization is initiated by onset of emergency myelopoiesis, which release immature myeloid cells with an immunosuppressive phenotype into the peripheral blood and lungs. Our study integrates frequencies of non-classical monocytes and immature neutrophils with calprotectin plasma levels as robust biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and suggests potential therapeutic strategies targeting calprotectin to alleviate severe COVID-19.

Section: Results

This non-interventional study enrolled 158 patients ( Table S1 ), including 86 and 72 subjects referred to the hospital with various flu-like symptoms who were diagnosed or not with COVID-19 based on positive and negative RT-PCR of pharyngeal swabs, respectively. Patients were stratified according to disease severity. Mild disease (n = 27) was defined as having no or limited clinical symptoms and not requiring computed tomography (CT) scanning or hospitalization. Moderate disease (n = 16) was defined as being symptomatic, with dyspnea and radiological findings of pneumonia upon thoracic CT scan, requiring hospitalization with a maximum of 9 L/min of oxygen. Severe disease (n = 43) was defined as respiratory distress requiring admission into the ICU. Mild and moderate cases were mixed in the discovery part of the study and considered separately to explore the ability of a routine flow assay to discriminate patients who require hospitalization.
To explore changes in circulating immune cell phenotype induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first collected peripheral blood samples from a discovery cohort of 13 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 (hereafter called COVID-19 patients) by RT-PCR and 12 patients suffering from flu-like symptoms but negative for SARS-CoV-2. The former group included 5 patients with mild disease and 8 patients with severe COVID-19 ( Table S2 ). After red blood cell lysis, we labeled peripheral blood cells with a panel of 25 antibodies recognizing immune cell surface markers ( Key Resources Table ) and analyzed them by spectral flow cytometry ( Figures 1 A, S1 A, and S1B). By pooling the data from the 25 control and COVID-19 patients and subjecting them to dimensionality reduction using the non-supervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction algorithm ( Becht et al., 2018 5. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (2405) Google Scholar ), we identified populations of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, CD14 High monocytes, and CD15 + CD66b + neutrophils ( Figures 1 B and 1C). We also identified HLA-DR High CD11b + and CD16 High monocytes as well as neutrophils expressing CD11b, CD15, CD16, and CD64 ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Analysis and visualization, using UMAP dimensionality reduction to the cell surface marker expression datasets from control and mild and severe COVID-19 groups suggested differences in the repartition of cell populations ( Figure 1 D).
Patients with severe disease exhibited an expansion in the proportion of circulating neutrophils within the peripheral blood cell population ( Figure 1 E) that was associated with an increase in their absolute numbers ( Table S2 ), as already reported ( Huang et al., 2020 32. Huang, C. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Li, X. ... Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Lancet. 2020; 395 :497-506 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (33242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Focusing on neutrophil subsets, we noticed a slight increase in the fraction of CD10 Low CD101 + neutrophils in patients with mild COVID-19 ( Figure 1 F), whereas the fraction of CD10 Low CD101 − neutrophils was remarkably amplified in patients with severe disease, suggesting an accumulation of immature subsets of neutrophils ( Ng et al., 2019 44. Ng, L.G. ∙ Ostuni, R. ∙ Hidalgo, A. Heterogeneity of neutrophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :255-265 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the peripheral blood of these patients ( Figures 1 G and S1 C–S1E).
In patients with severe disease, the absolute numbers of circulating monocytes ( Table S2 ) and the proportion of total monocytes among peripheral blood leucocytes ( Figures 1 H and S1 F) were similar to controls, but we noticed changes in monocyte subset repartition. The fraction of CD14 High CD16 High intermediate monocytes was significantly greater in patients with mild COVID-19 (16.95% ± 6.75%) than in the control (5.84% ±1.02%) or severe (6.77% ± 1.10%) groups, whereas the non-classical CD14 Low CD16 High monocyte fraction was lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (1.31% ± 0.35%) than in the mild (5.46% ± 1.57%) or control groups (6.68% ± 1.14%) ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Within the CD14 High CD16 Low classical monocyte subset ( Figure S1 G), we detected higher frequencies of CD11b High monocytes with increased disease severity ( Figure S1 H), whereas the intensity of HLA-DR expression was lower across the CD11b + and CD11b − monocyte populations of patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figures 1 K and 1L).
Changes in myeloid cell repartition observed in patients with severe disease were associated with lower frequencies of B cells compared with controls (p < 0.001) and of CD4 + (p < 0.001) and CD8 + T cells (p < 0.01) relative to controls and patients with mild disease, whereas CD56 + natural killer (NK) cell frequencies remained comparable across all groups ( Figure 1 M).
Altogether, these data suggested that SARS-CoV-2-induced changes in the relative abundance of monocyte and neutrophil subsets within the peripheral blood cell population, with loss of non-classical CD14 Low CD16 High monocytes, reduced the expression of HLA-DR on classical monocytes and a drop in CD101 and CD10 expression on neutrophils, characterizing severe cases.
As a second step in our discovery process, we collected peripheral blood samples from three control patients with flu-like symptoms who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and three SARS2-CoV-2-positive patients, one outpatient with mild disease and two patients with severe disease admitted to the ICU ( Figures 2 A and 2B; Table S3 ). Using the 10X Chromium droplet-based platform, these samples were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) immediately after collection and red blood cell lysis, without additional sorting or freezing, to preserve fragile cell populations, mainly neutrophils. Unsupervised clustering based on gene expression identified B and T cells as well as neutrophils, monocytes, erythroid cells, and platelets ( Figures 2 C, S2 A, and S2B). Samples analyzed by scRNA-seq were analyzed simultaneously by spectral flow cytometry for comparison ( Figure 2 D). UMAP analysis of spectral flow cytometry data suggested lower proportions of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, whereas the neutrophil fraction was greater in patients with severe disease compared with controls and with the unique patient with mild disease ( Figures 2 E and S2 C). The three SARS2-CoV-2-infected patients were sampled again 10 days later to monitor progression of the immune response in relation to clinical status ( Figures 2 A–2E).
UMAP visualization of monocytes analyzed by scRNA-seq identified three clusters ( Figure 3 A) that may correspond to well-defined monocyte subsets ( Guilliams et al., 2018 26. Guilliams, M. ∙ Mildner, A. ∙ Yona, S. Developmental and Functional Heterogeneity of Monocytes Immunity. 2018; 49 :595-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells of cluster 1 expressed CD14 , ITGAM (encoding CD11b), and KLF4 while poorly expressing FCGR3A (encoding CD16), suggesting classical monocytes. Cells of cluster 3, which expressed high levels of FCGR3A and low levels of CD14 , may correspond to non-classical monocytes, and cluster 2, in which cells expressed CD14 and FCGR3A , evoked intermediate monocytes ( Figure 3 A). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway analyses delineated a type I interferon signature in monocytes of patients with mild COVID-19 ( Figures 3 B, S3 A, and S3B; Table S4 ). This signature was less pronounced in the two severe COVID-19 samples, contrasting with the elevated expression of genes involved in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxygen species (NOS) ( Figures S3 A and S3B).
A non-supervised UMAP analysis of the data collected by spectral flow cytometry of the same samples detected variations in monocyte subset repartition among patients; compared with controls and the patient with mild disease, patient 1 with severe disease showed a lower fraction of CD14 Low CD16 High non-classical monocytes at day 0, whereas the other patient with severe disease showed a high level of this monocyte fraction ( Figure 3 C). Additionally, the two patients with severe disease showed markedly higher levels of classical CD14 High CD16 Low monocytes, expressing more CD141 ( THBD ) at their surface ( Figure 3 D), in accordance with the scRNA-seq analysis ( Table S4 ).
In the patient with mild disease, one of the most highly expressed genes in classical monocytes was the interferon-stimulated gene ( Sevelsted et al., 2015 52. Sevelsted, A. ∙ Stokholm, J. ∙ Bønnelykke, K. ... Cesarean section and chronic immune disorders Pediatrics. 2015; 135 :e92-e98 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ) SIGLEC-1 , consistent with the high level of expression of CD169, the corresponding protein, at the surface of classical monocytes at day 0 ( Figure 3 E). Ten days later, SIGLEC-1 gene expression was downregulated, and CD169 expression was undetectable at the surface of HLA-DR High classical monocytes ( Figures 3 B and 3E). The two patients with severe disease exhibited low expression of HLA-DR protein on monocyte surfaces at day 0, without significant change at day 10 ( Figure 3 E).
Validating these discovery experiments, we performed mass cytometry analysis of an independent cohort of 12 patients (four in each group; control, mild, and severe) ( Table S5 ), which showed a lower fraction of CD14 Low CD16 High non-classical monocytes in patients with severe compared with mild disease ( Figures 3 F and 3G). In accordance with pathway analysis of scRNA-seq data highlighting nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation as a prominent feature in monocytes of patients with severe disease ( Figures 3 B and S3 B), we observed significantly higher levels of the phosphorylated transcription factor RelA/p65 (P-p65), a critical effector of the canonical NF-κB pathway, in HLA-DR Low CD14 High classical monocytes from patients with severe disease compared with controls ( Figures 3 H and 3I). We also measured P-p65 expression in circulating CD34 + cells, identifying increased expression in severe disease ( Figure S3 C).
UMAP analysis of neutrophils identified two clusters ( Figure 4 A). We observed an increase of cluster 2 cells in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 4 B). Cluster 1 expressed the IL1R2 gene, whereas cluster 2 also expressed high levels of S100A8 and S100A9 , CXCR4 , SELL , and SPI1 ( Figures 4 C and S4 A). DEGs and pathway analyses in neutrophils of patients with mild disease informed about a type I interferon response at day 0 that was lost by day 10 ( Figures 4 D, S4 B, and S4C). This signature was absent in controls and also in the two samples collected from patients with severe disease at later time points ( Figure 4 D), demonstrating high expression of genes involved in production of ROS, the inducible NOS pathway, IL-1 signaling, and NF-κB activation pathways ( Figures S4 B and S4C).
Analysis of the data collected by spectral flow cytometry of the same samples distinguished CD10 + CD101 + mature neutrophils from CD10 Low CD101 − immature neutrophils. At day 0, the two patients with severe disease had more circulating CD10 Low CD101 − immature neutrophils compared with controls or the patient with mild disease ( Figure 4 E). Neutrophils from patient 1 with severe disease had increased expression of CD101 on their surfaces at day 10, whereas neutrophils from patient 2 with severe disease retained their immature phenotype at day 10. Focusing on expression of a pre-neutrophil hallmark, CXCR4, on the surface of CD10 Low CD101 − immature neutrophils ( Ng et al., 2019 44. Ng, L.G. ∙ Ostuni, R. ∙ Hidalgo, A. Heterogeneity of neutrophils Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :255-265 Crossref Scopus (365) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed an increase in the proportion of neutrophils with a CD10 Low CD101 − CXCR4 + phenotype, which, presumably, are pre-neutrophils ( Figure 4 F). Mass cytometry analysis of an independent cohort of 12 patients (four controls, four patients with mild COVID-19, and four patients with severe COVID-19; Table S5 ) again suggested a higher fraction of CD10 Low CD101 − immature neutrophils in patients with severe disease compared with control patients ( Figures 4 G and 4H).
Altogether, the results of these exploratory scRNA-seq experiments identified a transient type I interferon response in cells of a patient with mild disease and the presence of phenotypically immature subsets of monocytes and neutrophils in two patients with severe disease, which was further confirmed by mass cytometry.
S100A8 and S100A9 alarmins, representing ∼45% of the cytoplasmic proteins in neutrophils, are released under inflammatory conditions and form a stable heterodimer known as “calprotectin” ( Wang et al., 2018 66. Wang, S. ∙ Song, R. ∙ Wang, Z. ... S100A8/A9 in Inflammation Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1298 Crossref Scopus (782) PubMed Google Scholar ). In accordance with preliminary results generated by scRNA-seq ( Figure S4 A), qRT-PCR analysis detected higher expression of the S100A8 and S100A9 genes in peripheral blood nucleated cells of patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 8) compared with controls (n = 8) and patients with mild disease (n = 16) ( Figure S5 A; Table S5 ). This led us to measure the plasma level of calprotectin, together with type I interferon (IFNα) and 40 other cytokines and chemokines, in samples from a cohort of 84 patients ( Table S6 ). As seen in Figure 5 A, patients with mild disease showed significantly less CXCL8 ( Figures 5 C and S5 B) and significantly more type I IFNα ( Figures 5 A and 5C) compared with controls. Patients with severe disease exhibited dramatically higher calprotectin levels compared with patients with mild COVID-19 or controls, without a further increase in IFNα plasma levels above mild disease levels ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S5 C). Calprotectin was the most significantly increased circulating biomarker in patients with severe disease, accompanied by a rise in 23 other tested chemokines and cytokines, including CXCL-8, CXCL-12, and IL-6 ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S5 B).
Age and comorbidities (including obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancer) are predictors of severe COVID-19 disease ( Richardson et al., 2020 49. Richardson, S. ∙ Hirsch, J.S. ∙ Narasimhan, M. ..., Northwell COVID-19 Research Consortium Presenting Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Outcomes Among 5700 Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19 in the New York City Area JAMA. 2020; 323 :2052-2059 Crossref Scopus (6524) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that plasma calprotectin levels were significantly higher in control patients with comorbidities as well as in mild or severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities ( Figure 5 D). Nevertheless, the increase in calprotectin in patients with severe COVID-19 far exceeds correlations associated with comorbidities. None of the other measured circulating proteins were significantly higher in patients with comorbidities ( Figure 5 E). Bacterial infections can occur in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Chen et al., 2020c 12. Chen, N. ∙ Zhou, M. ∙ Dong, X. ... Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study Lancet. 2020; 395 :507-513 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (14505) PubMed Google Scholar ; Llitjos et al., 2020 40. Llitjos, J.F. ∙ Leclerc, M. ∙ Chochois, C. ... High incidence of venous thromboembolic events in anticoagulated severe COVID-19 patients J. Thromb. Haemost. 2020; 18 :1743-1746 Crossref Scopus (876) PubMed Google Scholar ) and were present in some of our patients with severe disease but did not significantly modify the profile of released proteins ( Figures S5 B and S5C), including calprotectin ( Figure 5 F). No correlation between calprotectin and age was observed in any group of patients ( Figure S5 D). Calprotectin concentration correlated with neutrophil counts ( Figure 5 G), fibrinogen plasma levels ( Figure 5 H), and D dimers ( Figure 5 I), the latter being fibrin degradation products reflecting a hypercoagulability state. When modeling calprotectin plasma levels using multivariable linear regression to take into account potential confounding factors (age, sex, and comorbidities) and the correlation with neutrophil count, fibrinogen, and D dimers, these associations were still statistically significant (neutrophils, p = 1.154e−04; fibrinogen, p = 5.688e−05; D dimers, p = 2.099e−03). We also uncovered a weak correlation between IL-6 plasma concentration and levels of calprotectin ( Figure S5 E), blood neutrophil count ( Figure 5 J), fibrinogen ( Figure 5 K), and D dimers ( Figure 5 L), which disappeared after adjusted multilinear regression. Finally, a logistic regression including age, sex, and comorbidities together with biological parameters identified plasma levels of calprotectin, CX3CL1, CXCL11, and CXCL13 as the parameters that best discriminate controls/patients with mild COVID-19 from patients with severe disease.
These results indicate that high plasma levels of calprotectin are seen in patients with severe COVID-19 but not in those with mild disease. Importantly, this increase is independent of confounding factors for prognosis, such as advanced age, comorbidities, or concurrent bacterial infection, which have only minor effects on plasma calprotectin levels.
The hypothesis from the scRNA-seq-based identification of CD37, CD63 (LAMP3), CD169 (SIGLEC-1), and CD184 (CXCR4) biomarkers of blood cell subsets, whose relative proportions differ in patients with mild and severe COVID-19, prompted us to add antibodies targeting these proteins to the spectral flow cytometry panel. We applied this new panel to samples from an independent validation cohort of 90 patients. This cohort included 48 control patients and 42 COVID-19-positive patients, of whom 16 had mild disease and 26 had severe disease ( Figure 6 A; Table S6 ). Non-supervised analysis and UMAP visualization identified the main cell populations in the three categories of patients combined ( Figures S6 A and S6B). Analyzing patients individually confirmed the significant decrease in B cell, CD4 + T cell, and CD8 + T cell fractions in severe patients compared with the control and mild disease groups ( Figure 6 B), which may be a consequence of the increased neutrophil fraction ( Figure 6 C) and absolute numbers ( Table S6 ). More specifically, within neutrophils, we observed a shift in CD10 Low CD101 − neutrophils ( Figures 6 D and 6E) and the subset of CD10 Low CD101 − neutrophils that express CXCR4 (CD10 Low CD101 − CXCR4 + cells) ( Figure 6 F) we observed previously in patients with severe disease. Finally, the fraction of CD10 Low CD16 Low neutrophils was also higher in patients with severe disease ( Figure S6 C), suggesting accumulation of immature neutrophils in the blood of patients with severe COVID-19.
scRNA-seq analyses of monocyte subsets indicated differential changes in the distribution of non-classical CD14 Low CD16 High monocyte fractions in the two patients with severe disease ( Figure 3 C). Because samples were collected from patients at various time points after admission to the ICU, we wanted to find out whether the duration of ICU stay affects monocyte subset distribution. In the 26 patients of this cohort with severe disease ( Table S6 ), we observed a significant correlation between the time spent in the ICU and the fraction of the non-classical monocyte subset, irrespective of the presence or absence of concurrent bacterial infection ( Figure 6 G). The mean time spent in the ICU was 5.46 days for patients with fewer than 5% non-classical monocytes compared with 8.83 days for those with 5% and more non-classical monocytes ( Figures 6 H and 6I).
Then we examined other monocyte subsets. In the majority of patients with mild disease, we observed a fraction of classical monocytes that express CD169, which was decreased in patients with severe disease ( Figures 6 J, 6K, and S6 D). CD169 expression correlated with IFNα plasma levels ( Figure S6 E). Independent of the time spent in the ICU, patients with severe disease also showed a larger fraction of classical monocytes expressing high levels of CD141 compared with controls ( Figures 6 J and 6L) and of monocytes expressing low levels of HLA-DR compared with controls and patients with mild disease ( Figure S6 F). Finally, the time spent in the ICU did not significantly affect repartition of lymphocyte populations or neutrophil subsets ( Figures S6 F and S6G).
Thus, patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a transient decrease in non-classical monocyte frequencies, a stable decrease in HLA-DR Low CD141 + classical monocytes, and a major increase in CD10 Low CD101 − CXCR4 +/− immature neutrophils.
We next investigated whether changes in circulating myeloid cell phenotypes could be used to discriminate patients who develop severe COVID-19. Within our previous cohort, we separated patients with mild (n = 12) from patients with moderate (n = 6) and severe (n = 27) disease using clinical criteria. Patients classified as having “moderate” disease demonstrated intermediate changes between those of outpatients with mild disease and patients with severe disease in the ICU ( Figure S7 A). The fraction of CD10 Low CD101 − neutrophils in patients with moderate disease was intermediate but not significantly different from any group ( Figure 7 A). However, the amount of calprotectin measured in patients with moderate COVID-19 was significantly higher than in outpatients with mild disease but still significantly lower than in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Figure 7 B). In comparison, IFNα levels were not significantly different between patients with moderate and mild disease or patients with severe disease ( Figure S7 B). The difference in non-classical monocyte fraction was significant between patients with mild and moderate disease, dropping to levels comparable with patients with severe disease ( Figure 7 C).
Thus, we hypothesized that the decreased non-classical monocyte fraction could be used as a fast and simple diagnostic test to distinguish moderate from mild COVID-19, especially in patients in whom clinical symptoms may be substantially overlapping. This would facilitate rapid and accurate identification of patients currently classified as having mild disease at the cusp of potentially progressing to more severe disease. We therefore employed a low-dimensional flow cytometry approach that measures the fraction of classical (CD14 High CD16 Low ), intermediate (CD14 High CD16 High ), and non-classical (CD14 Low CD16 High ) monocyte subsets among total peripheral blood monocytes and applied it initially to a learning cohort of 98 patients, consisting of 16 patients with mild disease, 10 with moderate disease, and 16 with severe COVID-19, along with 56 controls ( Table S7 ). All hospitalized patients were sampled within 10 days of admission to limit the potential effect of time spent in the ICU (see Figure 6 G); the mean time spent in the ICU was 5.5 days at the point of sampling. The cohort also included 56 controls. Patients with mild disease showed a fraction of non-classical monocytes similar to that observed in controls. In contrast, moderate patients showed lower levels of non-classical monocytes, as observed in patients with severe disease ( Figure 7 D). To measure the global performance of this test, we used a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve ( Hajian-Tilaki, 2013 28. Hajian-Tilaki, K. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis for Medical Diagnostic Test Evaluation Caspian J. Intern. Med. 2013; 4 :627-635 PubMed Google Scholar ). The point of the ROC curve corresponding to the best sensitivity/specificity compromise indicated that a non-classical monocyte fraction below 4% separated patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 from those with mild or no disease with 76.9% sensitivity (95% bootstrap confidence interval [BCI] [61.5%, 92.3%]) and 89% specificity (95% BCI [80.6%, 95.8%]) ( Figure S7 C).
We then applied these analyses to blood samples from an independent validation cohort of 24 hospitalized patients from a different clinical center (10 controls, 3 patients with mild disease, 4 with moderate disease, and 7 with severe COVID-19) ( Table S7 ). A non-classical monocyte fraction below 4% of total circulating monocytes, as defined in the learning cohort, also segregated those with mild disease from those with moderate and severe disease with high sensitivity (81.8%, 95% BCI [72.7%, 100%]) and specificity (92.3%, 95% BCI [83.3%, 100%]) ( Figure 7 E). These results confirmed the specificity and sensitivity of our assay to discriminate patients with different COVID-19 severity.
Further confirming these observations, serial sampling of two patients with severe disease who responded to anti-IL-6R antibodies documented that their clinical recovery was associated with reappearance of non-classical monocytes in the blood ( Figure S7 D). One patient who was initially referred with limited symptoms (atypical thoracic pain) and was SARS-Cov-2 PCR negative unexpectedly exhibited a low fraction of non-classical monocytes (3.4%) accompanied by 10% HLA-DR Low classical monocytes. The following day, pulmonary symptoms appeared and the patient was hospitalized, requiring oxygen therapy, and a lung CT scan revealed characteristic COVID-19-associated injury. Such cases suggest that loss of the non-classical monocyte fraction could be a strong indicator of existing or impending severe COVID-19.
Additional informative parameters could be added to this flow assay to increase its specificity to identify transition to severe COVID-19, including decreased expression of HLA-DR on the surface of classical monocytes ( Figure S7 E), which is associated with a decrease in the non-classical monocyte fraction below 4% ( Figure S7 F), and an increase in the fraction of CD16 Low neutrophils ( Figure S7 G). Comparison of ROC curves indicated that calprotectin plasma level and monocyte or neutrophil subset analyses distinguished mild COVID-19 in outpatients from moderate or severe disease in hospitalized patients whereas IFNα2a plasma levels did not ( Figure S7 H).
Together with calprotectin plasma levels, flow identification of a decrease in the non-classical monocyte fraction below 4% of total monocytes could provide improved resolution for clinical observations when categorizing patients at the border of mild and moderate/severe COVID-19. This would potentially identify individuals at greatest risk of rapid decline and highlight the need for pro-active management/intervention and intensive monitoring. This assay could be reinforced by analysis of HLA-DR Low classical monocyte and CD16 Low neutrophil fractions.
The lungs are major organs affected in patients with severe COVID-19. To better understand how the distinctive cell signatures found in the blood of patients with severe COVID-19 affect immune cell compartments in the lungs, particularly the presence of immature neutrophils and HLA-DR Low monocytes, we integrated our dataset using the Seurat V3 pipeline ( Stuart et al., 2019 56. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the published scRNA-seq dataset of cells from 12 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples (BALFs) of controls (n = 3) and patients with mild (n = 3) and severe (n = 6) COVID-19 ( Liao et al., 2020 39. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... Single-cell landscape of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :842-844 Crossref Scopus (1657) PubMed Google Scholar ; Database: GSE145926 ). This analysis provided an unbiased global map of immune cells in the blood and BALF of controls and patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Using dimensional reduction, we identified 5 regions based on DEGs across pooled data from all samples ( Figures 7 F and S7 I), including T cells (characterized by expression the NKG7 , CD8A , CST7 , GZMB , and GZMA genes), B cells ( IGLV3-19 , IGHV4-34 , IGHG1 , IGHA1 , and JCHAIN ), neutrophils ( G0S2 , RSAD2 , IL1R2 , and IL1RN ), alveolar macrophages ( APOE , MSR1 , MARCO , and FBP1 ), and monocytes/macrophages ( FN1 , CXCL10 , CD68 , and NUPR1 ). Validating this approach, the alveolar macrophage region was mainly present in BALF of control patients but decreased dramatically in patients with mild and severe COVID-19,and only one cell from our blood scRNA-seq matched in this region ( Figures 7 F and 7G). We also observed changes in the monocyte/macrophage region of BALF from patients with mild or severe disease versus controls and dramatic neutrophil accumulation in patients with severe disease ( Figure 7 G).
Monocytes/macrophages were increased in BALF of the mild compared with the control and severe groups ( Figures 7 H and 7I), and these cells were characterized by expression of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) ( SIGLEC-1 , IFI44 , and IFITM3 ) ( Figure 7 J), with pathway analyses indicating upregulation of the viral replication and type I IFN signaling pathways. In contrast, the NOS biosynthetic process and monocyte chemotaxis were upregulated in BALF monocytes/macrophages of patients with severe disease ( Figure S7 J), which, similar to blood monocytes, expressed lower levels of HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 and higher levels of NFKBIA mRNA compared with controls or patients with mild COVID-19 ( Figure 7 J). Finally, neutrophils were present at high frequencies in BALF from patients with severe COVID-19 but not in BALF from controls or patients with mild disease ( Figures 7 K and 7L). UMAP integration of samples from patients with severe disease samples indicated that BALF neutrophils, similar to blood neutrophils ( Figure 7 L), were characterized by high expression of S100A8 , S100A9 , as well as CXCR4 , indicating an immature state ( Figures 7 M, 7N, and S7 K).
Integration of blood and BALF myeloid cells identified, in patients with severe COVID-19, loss of HLA-DRA and HLA-DRB1 and high NFKBIA expression in monocytes/macrophages (not including alveolar macrophages) together with accumulation of neutrophils expressing high levels of S100A8/A9 and CXCR4 .

Section: Discussion

This study presents evidence that patients who develop severe COVID-19 exhibit high levels of calprotectin and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, correlating with emergency myelopoiesis generating ROS- and NOS-expressing immunosuppressive myeloid cells (HLA-DR Low monocytes and immature subsets of neutrophils).
The first line of defense in virus-infected patients typically involves a protective innate response incorporating transient and strong production of type I IFNs. By inducing expression of ISGs, type I IFNs inhibit virus replication and promote an effective innate and adaptive immune response ( Thevarajan et al., 2020 59. Thevarajan, I. ∙ Nguyen, T.H.O. ∙ Koutsakos, M. ... Breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe COVID-19 Nat.

SARS coronavirus pathogenesis: host innate immune responses and viral antagonism of interferon Curr. Opin. Virol. 2012; 2 :264-275 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). This antiviral response may be impaired in COVID-19 patients who suddenly develop clinically life-threatening disease ( Hadjadj et al., 2020 27. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and exacerbated inflammatory responses in severe Covid-19 patients medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Severe COVID-19 frequently develops in the context of advanced age and comorbidities, which provide a degree of underlying systemic chronic inflammation ( Furman et al., 2019 22. Furman, D. ∙ Campisi, J. ∙ Verdin, E. ... Chronic inflammation in the etiology of disease across the life span Nat. Med. 2019; 25 :1822-1832 Crossref Scopus (2166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such inflammation could disrupt the timing of the type I IFN response relative to the kinetics of virus replication ( Terán-Cabanillas and Hernández, 2017 58. Terán-Cabanillas, E. ∙ Hernández, J. Role of Leptin and SOCS3 in Inhibiting the Type I Interferon Response During Obesity Inflammation. 2017; 40 :58-67 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), which has been shown to be critical in mouse models of coronavirus infection ( Channappanavar et al., 2019 7.

Invest. 2019; 129 :3625-3639 Crossref Scopus (399) PubMed Google Scholar ). An imbalance between type I IFN and inflammatory responses could also be favored by the highly efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human tissues ( Chu et al., 2020 13. Chu, H. ∙ Chan, J.F. ∙ Wang, Y. ...

Rep. 2015; 5 :17554 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit abnormal partition of circulating monocytes and of neutrophils expressing the S100A8 ( calgranulin A/myeloid-related protein 8 ) and S100A9 ( calgranulin B/myeloid-related protein 14 ) alarmin genes. Importantly, accumulation of neutrophils expressing high levels of the S100A8/A9 genes was also observed in the BALF of these patients. The release of massive amounts of calprotectin, the heterodimer formed by S100A8 and S100A9 proteins, is a striking event associated with severe COVID-19. This heterodimer promotes cell migration and boosts NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase activity. Calprotectin is a TLR4 and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) ligand that, upstream of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) ( Vogl et al., 2018 64. Vogl, T. ∙ Stratis, A. ∙ Wixler, V. ... Autoinhibitory regulation of S100A8/S100A9 alarmin activity locally restricts sterile inflammation J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :1852-1866 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CXCL8 ( Simard et al., 2014 54. Simard, J.C. ∙ Noël, C. ∙ Tessier, P.A. ... Human S100A9 potentiates IL-8 production in response to GM-CSF or fMLP via activation of a different set of transcription factors in neutrophils FEBS Lett. 2014; 588 :2141-2146 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) synthesis and secretion, promotes NF-κB activation ( Riva et al., 2012 50. Riva, M. ∙ Källberg, E. ∙ Björk, P. ... Induction of nuclear factor-κB responses by the S100A9 protein is Toll-like receptor-4-dependent Immunology. 2012; 137 :172-182 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) and secretion of multiple inflammatory proteins, such as IL-6 ( Wang et al., 2018 66. Wang, S. ∙ Song, R. ∙ Wang, Z. ... S100A8/A9 in Inflammation Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1298 Crossref Scopus (782) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we propose that calprotectin may account for and possibly trigger the cytokine release syndrome that characterizes severe COVID-19. Its production may be amplified by tissue damage, generating a harmful hyperinflammation loop ( Kuipers et al., 2013 36. Kuipers, M.T. ∙ Vogl, T. ∙ Aslami, H. ... High levels of S100A8/A9 proteins aggravate ventilator-induced lung injury via TLR4 signaling PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e68694 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ) that precludes these peptides from exerting more protective functions ( Austermann et al., 2014 3.

Freise, N. ∙ Burghard, A. ∙ Ortkras, T. ... Signaling mechanisms inducing hyporesponsiveness of phagocytes during systemic inflammation Blood. 2019; 134 :134-146 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ulas et al., 2017 61.

Autoinhibitory regulation of S100A8/S100A9 alarmin activity locally restricts sterile inflammation J. Clin. Invest. 2018; 128 :1852-1866 Crossref Scopus (140) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chronic inflammation from comorbidities may synergize with SARS-CoV-2 infection to induce systemic release of calprotectin, which translates into upregulation of NF-κB and loss of HLA-DR on classical monocytes and the presence of immature neutrophils, converging to a state of chronic inflammation-induced immunosuppression. Abnormal neutrophils have been observed previously in patients with severe COVID-19 ( Wilk et al., 2020 68. Wilk, A.J. ∙ Rustagi, A. ∙ Zhao, N.Q. ... A single-cell atlas of the peripheral immune response in patients with severe COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :1070-1076 Crossref Scopus (988) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the authors concluded that these neutrophils transdifferentiate from B cells. We have no supporting results suggesting that this could be the case.
Under healthy conditions, roughly 85% of total circulating monocytes are CD14 High CD16 Low HLA-DR High cells that are rapidly recruited to inflamed tissues ( Guilliams et al., 2018 26. Guilliams, M. ∙ Mildner, A. ∙ Yona, S. Developmental and Functional Heterogeneity of Monocytes Immunity. 2018; 49 :595-613 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ). As in other severe illnesses ( Lukaszewicz et al., 2009 41. Lukaszewicz, A.C. ∙ Grienay, M. ∙ Resche-Rigon, M. ... Monocytic HLA-DR expression in intensive care patients: interest for prognosis and secondary infection prediction Crit. Care Med. 2009; 37 :2746-2752 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), expression of HLA-DR on CD14 High circulating monocytes is low in severe COVID-19, which correlates with, and could be mediated by, IL-6 overproduction ( Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020 23. Giamarellos-Bourboulis, E.J. ∙ Netea, M.G. ∙ Rovina, N. ... Complex Immune Dysregulation in COVID-19 Patients with Severe Respiratory Failure Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27 :992-1000.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1471) PubMed Google Scholar ). A more specific feature of COVID-19 is the low fraction of CD14 Low CD16 High non-classical monocytes. This fraction commonly increases in patients with sepsis and inflammatory diseases, including viral infections ( Kratofil et al., 2017 35. Kratofil, R.M. ∙ Kubes, P. ∙ Deniset, J.F. Monocyte Conversion During Inflammation and Injury Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2017; 37 :35-42 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ). The decrease in non-classical monocyte fraction could involve the ability of calprotectin to hasten trans -endothelial migration of leucocytes ( Fassl et al., 2015 18. Fassl, S.K. ∙ Austermann, J. ∙ Papantonopoulou, O. ... Transcriptome assessment reveals a dominant role for TLR4 in the activation of human monocytes by the alarmin MRP8 J. Immunol. 2015; 194 :575-583 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), unless these cells strongly adhere to the endothelium or conversion of classical into non-classical monocytes is stuck ( Hanna et al., 2011 29.

Selimoglu-Buet, D. ∙ Rivière, J. ∙ Ghamlouch, H. ... A miR-150/TET3 pathway regulates the generation of mouse and human non-classical monocyte subset Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :5455 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whatever the mechanism, the lower-than-normal frequencies of non-classical monocytes ( Thevarajan et al., 2020 59. Thevarajan, I. ∙ Nguyen, T.H.O. ∙ Koutsakos, M. ... Breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe COVID-19 Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :453-455 Crossref Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hadjadj et al., 2020 27. Hadjadj, J. ∙ Yatim, N. ∙ Barnabei, L. ... Impaired type I interferon activity and exacerbated inflammatory responses in severe Covid-19 patients medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) suggest a SARS-CoV-2-characteristic effect that is not observed in other viral infections. Most importantly, this decrease generates a highly characteristic biological signature of COVID-19’s aggressive form with the potential to be measured easily using standard diagnostic flow cytometry and provide information regarding the real-time immunological severity of the infection.
The burst of calprotectin detected in COVID-19 patients may trigger NF-κB-driven emergency myelopoiesis, generating immature and dysplastic cells ( Basiorka et al., 2016 4. Basiorka, A.A. ∙ McGraw, K.L. ∙ Eksioglu, E.A. ... The NLRP3 inflammasome functions as a driver of the myelodysplastic syndrome phenotype Blood. 2016; 128 :2960-2975 Crossref Scopus (261) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen et al., 2013 8. Chen, X. ∙ Eksioglu, E.A. ∙ Zhou, J. ... Induction of myelodysplasia by myeloid-derived suppressor cells J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123 :4595-4611 Crossref Scopus (256) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the considerable hematopoietic potential of the lungs ( Lefrançais et al., 2017 37. Lefrançais, E. ∙ Ortiz-Muñoz, G. ∙ Caudrillier, A. ... The lung is a site of platelet biogenesis and a reservoir for haematopoietic progenitors Nature. 2017; 544 :105-109 Crossref Scopus (743) PubMed Google Scholar ), the burst of calprotectin could also promote the contribution of lung megakaryocytes to disease pathogenesis in these organs. Whatever the mechanism, the immature and mature cells released into the peripheral blood by emergency myelopoiesis may be endowed with immunosuppressive functions, suggesting that myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), as detected in cancer, inflammation, and other diseases ( Veglia et al., 2018 63. Veglia, F. ∙ Perego, M. ∙ Gabrilovich, D. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells coming of age Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :108-119 Crossref Scopus (1206) PubMed Google Scholar ), might be important in COVID-19. In addition to HLA-DR Low monocytes, whose phenotype is that of monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), CD10 Low CD101 − CXCR1 + immature cells are reminiscent of granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) ( Aarts et al., 2019 1. Aarts, C.E.M. ∙ Hiemstra, I.H. ∙ Béguin, E.P. ... Activated neutrophils exert myeloid-derived suppressor cell activity damaging T cells beyond repair Blood Adv. 2019; 3 :3562-3574 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mastio et al., 2019 42. Mastio, J. ∙ Condamine, T. ∙ Dominguez, G. ... Identification of monocyte-like precursors of granulocytes in cancer as a mechanism for accumulation of PMN-MDSCs J. Exp. Med. 2019; 216 :2150-2169 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ; Veglia et al., 2018 63. Veglia, F. ∙ Perego, M. ∙ Gabrilovich, D. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells coming of age Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19 :108-119 Crossref Scopus (1206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, neutrophil precursors, such as the pre-neutrophil (preNeu) population, which is CXCR4 positive ( Evrard et al., 2018 17. Evrard, M. ∙ Kwok, I.W.H. ∙ Chong, S.Z. ...

Emergence of these populations could be a predictor of the switch to severe disease. Further research will be required to determine their specific role in disease development.
We observed that severe COVID-19 is specifically associated with (1) a burst of circulating calprotectin that precedes cytokine release syndrome, (2) low levels of non-classical monocytes in the peripheral blood, and (3) emergency myelopoiesis, which releases immature and dysplastic myeloid cells with an immune-suppressive phenotype. Monitoring calprotectin plasma levels and non-classical monocyte in the blood of patients could be implemented routinely in the lab to discriminate patients with early immunological signs consistent with developing more severe disease, as suggested recently ( Chen et al., 2020b 11. Chen, L. ∙ Long, X. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Elevated serum levels of S100A8/A9 and HMGB1 at hospital admission are correlated with inferior clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2020; Published online July 3, 2020 Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar ). Finally, in addition to the network of potential drug targets depicted recently by analysis of SARS-CoV-2 interactions ( Gordon et al., 2020 24. Gordon, D.E. ∙ Jang, G.M. ∙ Bouhaddou, M. ... A SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map reveals targets for drug repurposing Nature. 2020; 583 :459-468 Crossref Scopus (2931) PubMed Google Scholar ), our work provides a further rationale for testing several clinical strategies, including blocking emergency myelopoiesis with lenzilumab (NCT04351152), a recombinant anti-human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody ( Patnaik et al., 2020 47. Patnaik, M.M. ∙ Sallman, D.A. ∙ Mangaonkar, A. ... Phase 1 study of lenzilumab, a recombinant anti-human GM-CSF antibody, for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) Blood. 2020; blood.2019004352 Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar ); testing the oral quinoline-3-carboxamide tasquinimod ( Fizazi et al., 2017 19.

Investigational CD33-targeted therapeutics for acute myeloid leukemia Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2018; 27 :339-348 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may prevent interaction of S100A9 with myeloid progenitors ( Eksioglu et al., 2017 16.

These analyses provide snapshots of the differences in innate immune cell phenotype and calprotectin plasma levels between outpatients with mild disease at the time of sampling, having no or limited clinical symptoms and not requiring a CT scan or hospitalization, and patients with moderate to severe disease whose clinical situation requires hospitalization and, in most cases, oxygen supply. Although all statistical analyses indicate that these biomarkers efficiently discriminate these two clinical situations and may help with urgent patient triage, a serial analysis is now required to evaluate how these biomarkers can predict the switch from mild to moderate or severe COVID-19 and inform on the mechanisms involved in this switch.

This non-interventional study was approved by institutional review boards of Cochin-Port Royal (Paris, France) and Gustave Roussy (Villejuif, France) hospitals and the ethical committee of Cochin-Port Royal Hospital (CLEP Decision N°: AAA-2020-08023), and conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Controls (n = 72) were symptomatic patients who were seen at Hôtel-Dieu or Gustave Roussy COVID-19 screening unit and were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab. Mild COVID-19 patients (n = 27) were defined by having limited clinical symptoms (fever, cough, diarrhea, myalgia, anosmia/ageusia) that did not require CT-scan or hospitalization. Moderate cases (n = 16) were defined as symptomatic patients with dyspnea and radiological findings of pneumonia on thoracic CT scan, requiring hospitalization and a maximum of 9 L/min of oxygen. In the larger part of this study, mild and moderate cases were analyzed together and grouped under “mild category.” Severe patients (n = 43) were those hospitalized in the ICU with respiratory distress requiring 10L/min of oxygen or more, without or with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
Whole human peripheral blood was collected into sterile vacutainer tubes containing EDTA or heparin. Except for single cell RNA sequencing, tubes were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min at room temperature and plasma was collected. Whole blood was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with Whole Blood Cell Stabilizer (Cytodelics), incubated at room temperature for 10 min and transferred to −80°C freezer to await analysis. These samples were secondarily thawed in a water bath set to +37°C. Cells were fixed at a ratio 1:1 with Fixation Buffer (Cytodelics, ratio 1:1) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Red blood cells were lysed by addition of 2 mL of Lysis Buffer (Cytodelics, ratio 1:4) at room temperature for 10 min. White blood cells were washed with 2 mL of Wash Buffer (Cytodelics, ratio 1:5).
Cells were resuspended in 100 μL extra-cellular antibody cocktail and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. For intra-cellular labeling, a step of permeabilization was performed using 200 μL of BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (BD); cells were then incubated for 40 min at +4°C, washed in Perm Buffer (BD) and resuspended in intra-cellular antibody cocktail. After incubation, cells were washed in Flow Cytometry Buffer (1% BSA, 0.5% Na-Azide and 0.5M EDTA in PBS) and resuspended to proceed to the acquisition. All antibodies are listed in the Key Resources Table . Samples were acquired on CyTEK Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Biosciences). Fcs files were exported and analyzed using FlowJo software.
To fully capture peripheral blood cell heterogeneity, we analyzed fresh samples without cell sorting or freezing and without Ficoll enrichment, minimizing time of incubation and processing. Sample preparation was done at room temperature. After red cell lysis, single-cell suspensions were loaded onto a Chromium Single Cell Chip (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for co-encapsulation with barcoded Gel Beads at a target capture rate of ∼7000 individual cells per sample. To analyze neutrophils, we added RNase inhibitor (RNase OUT Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor Invitrogen, 40U/mL) into the loading buffer. Captured mRNAs were barcoded during cDNA synthesis using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Solution v3 (10x Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Of note, we increased the PCR cycles by two during cDNA amplification. All samples (at Day 0 and Day 10) were processed simultaneously with the Chromium Controller (10x Genomics) and the resulting libraries were prepared in parallel in a single batch. We pooled all of the libraries for sequencing in a single SP Illumina flow cell. All of the libraries were sequenced with an 8-base index read, a 28-base Read1 containing cell-identifying barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), and a 91-base Read2 containing transcript sequences on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Reads were aligned to the hg19 genome and were used for subsequent analysis.
Using the package Seurat V3 ( Stuart et al., 2019 56. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ), we normalized and scaled scRNA sequencing data. We next applied a principle component analysis to the scRNA sequencing results yielding a number of significant PCs (Using Jackstraw plot analysis). In addition, the standard deviation differences from one PC to another was taken into account as described by the Seurat V3 manual ( Stuart et al., 2019 56. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate UMAP plots, min_distance was set as 0.3 and n_neighbors was set to 30. By dimensionality reduction, distinct clusters were identified and described by performing the FindClusters feature. The resolution of this feature was reduced to 0.3 to identify main cellular population only. Following this, differential genes were identified by performing the FindAllMarkers function and selecting genes that were differentially expressed (logFC > / = +/− 0.25 and FDR < 0.05). This approach identified a number of well characterized blood cell populations. Clustering and analysis of specific cell populations were performed in a similar manner to as previously stated. Cells were clustered and separated based on well described markers (CD14/CD16 as describing monocyte populations).
The bronchoalveolar dataset was downloaded from the NIH GEO database (Liao et al., dataset GSE145926 ) and integrated with our own blood scRNaseq data using the Seurat V3 anchoring method ( Stuart et al., 2019 56. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6793) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the datasets were normalized independently and the highly variable genes were identified for each dataset using the Seurat pipeline. A corrected data matrix with both datasets was then generated using the Seurat v3 anchoring procedure to allow for joint analysis. The matrix was scaled and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using the Seurat v3 pipeline. A UMAP was performed on the 30 first Principal Components (PCs) ( Becht et al., 2018 5. Becht, E. ∙ McInnes, L. ∙ Healy, J. ... Dimensionality reduction for visualizing single-cell data using UMAP Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 37 :38-44 Crossref Scopus (2405) Google Scholar ). These principle components and subsequent clustering and analysis of scRNA sequencing data was performed as previously described.
Comparisons between patient samples were performed by a variation of the FindMarkers function that compared the differentially expressed genes from different samples, patient groups, and organs. Cutoff values were determined as previously described.
Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix with ezDNase Enzyme (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix in a BioRad CFX96 thermocycler using the standard SyBR Green detection protocol as outlined by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 12 ng of total cDNA, 50nM (each) primers and 1 × SyBR Green mixture were used in a total volume of 20 μL. Human primer sequences are the following: GUS (F: GAAAATATGTGGTTGGAGAGCTCATT; R: CCGAGTGAAGATCCCCT TTTTA); HPRT (F: GGACAGGACTGAACGTCTTGC; R: CTTGAGCACACAGAGGGCTACA); S100A8 (F: CAACACTG ATGGTGCAGTTAACTTC; R: CTGCCACGCCCATCTTTATC); S100A9 (F: CTGAGCTTCGAGG AGTTCATCA; R: CGTCACCCTCGTGCATCTTC).
Plasma samples ( Table S6 ) were centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 g, diluted 1:4, then monitored using the Bio-Plex Pro™ Human Chemokine Panel 40-plex Assay (Bio-rad, ref: 171AK99MR2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 40-plex cytokines and chemokines provided are: CCL1, CCL11, CCL13, CCL15, CCL17, CCL19, CCL2, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL23, CCL24, CCL25, CCL26, CCL27, CCL3, CCL7, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL12, CXCL13, CXCL16, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL9, GM-CSF, IFNα, IL-10, IL-16, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, MIF, TNFa. Acquisitions and analyses were performed on a Bio-Plex 200 system (Bio-rad) and a Bio-Plex Manager 6.1 Software (Bio-rad), respectively. Soluble Calprotectin (diluted 1:100) and IFNα2a were analyzed using a R-plex Human Calprotectin Antibody Set (Meso Scale Discovery, ref: F21YB-3) and the ultra-sensitive assay S-plex Human IFNα2a kit (Meso Scale Discovery, ref: K151P3S-1), respectively, following manufacturer’s instructions. Acquisitions and analyses of soluble Calprotectin and IFNα were performed on a MESO QuickPlex SQ120 reader and the MSD’s Discovery Workbench 4.0. Each plasma sample was assayed twice with the average value taken as the final result. Data representation was performed with software R v3.3.3 using tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2, ggpubr, pheatmap, corrplot or Hmisc packages.
Cells were barcoded using the 20-Plex Pd barcoding kit (Fluidigm). Briefly, they were washed in Barcode Perm Buffer, resuspended in 800 μL of Barcode Perm Buffer and 100 μL of each barcode were transferred to the appropriate sample. Cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice with Cell Staining Buffer (Fluidigm) and pooled, suspended in 100 μL filtered antibody cocktail, and incubated for 30 min at +4°C. All antibodies used are listed in Key Resources Table . After staining, cells were washed with Cell Staining Buffer and permeabilized with 200 μL of Fix/Perm from Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer kit (eBiosciences), 40 min at +4°C. After incubation, cells were washed in Perm Buffer from Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer kit (eBiosciences), resuspended in 100 μL filtered antibody cocktail, incubated for 30 min at +4°C, washed in Cell Staining Buffer and resuspended in 50 μL of CytoFix/Perm for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 400 μL of PBS containing 1.6% PFA + Iridium (1:4000) were added for 35 min at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed in Cell Staining Buffer, resuspended in 50 μL and stored at +4°C until acquisition. Cells were counted, washed and resuspended in Maxpar Cell Acquisition Solution at 0.5x 10 6 / mL and mixed with 10% EQ Beads immediately before acquisition on Helios mass cytometer using noise reduction, event length limits of 10-150 pushes. An average of 500,000 events were acquired per sample at a flow rate of 0.03mL/min. Mass cytometry standard files were normalized to a global standard determined for each log of EQ beads using CyTOF Software v.6.7.1014 (Fluidigm). Fcs files were exported and analyzed using FlowJo software. UMAP was performed with n_neighbors of 15 and a min_distance of 0.2. Clusters were identified by the detection of commonly used cell markers (T cells expressing CD4 or CD8, neutrophils expressing CD15, and monocytes expressing CD14 and or CD16).
Whole-blood samples (200μL) were labeled with anti-CD14-PC7 (clone RMO52); CD16-PB (clone 3G8); CD2-FITC (clone 39C1.5); CD56-PC5.5 (clone N901); CD24-PE (clone ALB9); CD45-KO (clone J33) and HLA-DR-APC (clone Immu-357) antibodies, all purchased from Beckman-Coulter. Red blood cells were lysed with 1 mL VersalyseTM (Beckman Coulter) before sample analysis with a Navios Cytometer (Beckman Coulter) as described ( Tarfi et al., 2019 57. Tarfi, S. ∙ Badaoui, B. ∙ Freynet, N. ..., Groupe Francophone des Myelodysplasies (GFM) Disappearance of slan-positive non-classical monocytes for diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with associated inflammatory state Haematologica. 2019; haematol.2019.219782 PubMed Google Scholar ). Monocytes were selected as CD45 High /SSC Int cells among living cells and singlets before excluding T cells as CD2 + /SSC Low , NK cells as CD56 + /SSC Low/Int , B cells as CD24 + /SSC Low , immature and mature granulocytes as CD24 + /SSC Int/High , CD16 Bright residual granulocytes, and remaining CD14 − CD16 − cells corresponding mainly to basophils and NK cells not previously excluded. Monocyte subsets were detected on a CD45/SCC dot plot, using a CD14/CD16 scattergram that separates CD14 High CD16 Low (classical), CD14 High /CD16 High (intermediate) and CD14 Low CD16 High (non-classical) subsets. Finally, the proportion of monocytes HLA-DR Low was evaluated on a HLA-DR/CD14 scattergram.
Calculations and statistical tests were performed using R v3.3.3. Unless stated, p values are two-sided with 95% confidence intervals for the reported statistic of interest. Individual data points representing the measurement from one patient are systematically calculated from the corresponding distribution. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to assess differences in concentration between two different groups. When indicated, the false discovery rate (FDR, p > 0.05) was controlled using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Spearman correlations were computed using Hmisc R package and cytokine results were shown using R package Pheatmap. Soluble factor fold ratios were calculated as log2 transformation of values of mild and severe patients versus median value of all control patients, and were converted to z scores. Hierarchical clustering of the patients based on the z score of 42 soluble factors was performed using euclidean distance and ward.D clustering. Gene ontology networks were made by subjecting the DEGs from previous scRNA sequencing analysis to the Cytoscape addon ClueGO. The selected DEGs were specific to those with increased expression by monocytes and neutrophils from mild or severe SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Biological Process gene ontologies selected had an FDR < 0.05. Other statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.
A generalized linear model was also used to analyze interactions between biological parameters. First, neutrophil count, calprotectin, fibrinogen, IL-6 and D-dimers were normalized using log transformation. Then, calprotectin plasma level was modeled using multivariable linear regression adjusted for the other parameters, and their interaction with the groups. Similar approach was performed to model IL-6. Backward selection was applied to obtain a parsimonious model.
To identify the most discriminant markers, we used a logistic regression adjusted for the scaled log2-transformed markers. Parameters were penalized using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) to limit overfitting due to the high number of markers. The regularization parameter was selected from 10-folds cross-validation using the glmnet R package ( Friedman et al., 2010 21. Friedman, J. ∙ Hastie, T. ∙ Tibshirani, R. Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent J Stat Softw. 2010; 33 :1-22 Crossref Scopus (10866) PubMed Google Scholar ). The final AUC estimate was corrected for optimism using the Harrell’s method ( Harrell et al., 1996 30. Harrell, Jr., F.E. ∙ Lee, K.L. ∙ Mark, D.B. Multivariable prognostic models: issues in developing models, evaluating assumptions and adequacy, and measuring and reducing errors Stat Med. 1996; 15 :361-387 Crossref Scopus (7729) PubMed Google Scholar ), and its confidence interval was computed using the two-stage approach proposed by Noma and colleagues ( Noma et al., 2020 45. Noma, H. ∙ Nagashima, K. ∙ Furukawa, T.A. Permutation inference methods for multivariate meta-analysis Biometrics. 2020; 76 :337-347 Crossref Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ) with 2000 bootstrap samples for each stage. In this analysis, we included age, sex and comorbidities together with biological parameters. Given the absence of validation cohort, AUC was corrected to limit overfitting bias. This correction indicated an AUC at 99.7% (95% confidence interval [98.8%; 100.0%]). The final score corresponds to the following equation: 𝑆 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 = 1 1 + e x p ⁡ ( 0 . 2 7 2 − 1 . 5 3 0 𝐶 1 − 0 . 0 1 3 𝐶 2 − 0 . 2 1 6 𝐶 3 − 0 . 2 1 2 𝐶 4 ) With 𝐶 1 , 𝐶 2 , 𝐶 3 , and 𝐶 4 , the values of the calprotectin, CX3CL1, CXCL11 and CXCL13 which are log2 transformed and scaled according to the value training cohort: 𝐶 1 = ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 2 ⁢ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑝 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ) − 1 9 . 2 8 5 / 2 . 2 7 8 ) , 𝐶 2 = ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 2 ⁢ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑋 ⁢ 3 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 1 ) − 7 . 8 0 3 / 0 . 8 9 2 ) , 𝐶 3 = ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 2 ⁢ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑋 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 1 1 ) − 5 . 5 0 3 / 1 . 6 9 1 ) , and 𝐶 4 = ( 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 2 ⁢ ( 𝐶 ⁢ 𝑋 ⁢ 𝐶 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 1 3 ) − 5 . 1 8 9 / 1 . 3 7 2 ) .
