Title: Optical Mapping of cAMP Signaling at the Nanometer Scale


Abstract: Summary

Cells relay a plethora of extracellular signals to specific cellular responses by using only a few second messengers, such as cAMP. To explain signaling specificity, cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been suggested to confine cAMP to distinct cellular compartments. However, measured rates of fast cAMP diffusion and slow PDE activity render cAMP compartmentalization essentially impossible. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that, contrary to earlier data, cAMP at physiological concentrations is predominantly bound to cAMP binding sites and, thus, immobile. Binding and unbinding results in largely reduced cAMP dynamics, which we term “buffered diffusion.” With a large fraction of cAMP being buffered, PDEs can create nanometer-size domains of low cAMP concentrations. Using FRET-cAMP nanorulers, we directly map cAMP gradients at the nanoscale around PDE molecules and the areas of resulting downstream activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Our study reveals that spatiotemporal cAMP signaling is under precise control of nanometer-size domains shaped by PDEs that gate activation of downstream effectors.

Section: Introduction

Hundreds of cell surface receptors, notably G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), signal via the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and its effector proteins, in particular protein kinase A (PKA). This pathway is central to key physiological functions and, hence, to many diseases, making it a highly attractive therapeutic target ( Nikolaev et al., 2010 31.

However, it is unclear how the huge number of receptors that change global cellular cAMP levels can result in specific cellular responses. To explain receptor-specific responses observed in experiments and how these responses might differ in different regions of a cell, many researchers have proposed cAMP compartmentalization ( Brunton et al., 1979 8.

Thus, the important question of whether and how intracellular cAMP might be compartmentalized has remained unresolved for decades.
We therefore set out to address this controversy by developing tools and methods to directly measure and characterize cAMP mobility in intact cells and at physiological levels and to measure cAMP levels and gradients in real time and with a spatial accuracy in the nanometer range.

Section: Results

To visualize how signaling by cAMP is patterned, we aimed to develop and use new technologies that allow analysis of cAMP diffusion and possible cAMP gradients at the nanometer scale. To assess intracellular cAMP diffusion under physiological conditions, we set out to directly measure cAMP dynamics in intact cells. We designed the cell-permeable fluorogenic cAMP analog 8-(2-(5(6)-carboxyfluoresceindiacetate)-aminoethylthio)adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-FDA-cAMP), which becomes fluorescent when hydrolyzed to the corresponding fluorescein compound 8-F-cAMP by intracellular esterases ( Figure 1 A). A detailed characterization of this compound is given in Methods S1 , including optical properties, equivalence to cAMP in binding to and activation of PKA, as well as resistance to degradation by PDEs.
The diffusion properties of this compound were then analyzed in intact cells by applying techniques that can report a wide range of diffusion speeds. Using a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy approach in combination with a confocal microscope, fast line scan imaging of fluorescent molecules allows precise extraction of diffusion coefficients ranging from below 0.1 μm 2 /s up to hundreds of square micrometers per second ( Ries et al., 2009 39. Ries, J. ∙ Chiantia, S. ∙ Schwille, P. Accurate determination of membrane dynamics with line-scan FCS Biophys. J. 2009; 96 :1999-2008 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hebert et al., 2005 20. Hebert, B. ∙ Costantino, S. ∙ Wiseman, P.W. Spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy (STICS) theory, verification, and application to protein velocity mapping in living CHO cells Biophys. J. 2005; 88 :3601-3614 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (342) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 1 B and S1 ; STAR Methods ). Briefly, this approach yields the probability distribution function of an individual molecule occupying a given position in space and time (spatiotemporal image correlation spectroscopy [STICS] function); rapidly diffusing molecules can travel large distances in a short time, whereas bound or very slowly diffusing molecules persist at the same position for a long time. This method can capture combinations of different diffusion modes or of diffusion and binding, as illustrated schematically in Figure 1 C. We calibrated the method by using fluorescent compounds of known molecular weight, which yielded values in agreement with their theoretical diffusion coefficients in water ( Figure S1 ).
To analyze cAMP dynamics in intact cells, we used this technology in HEK293 cells loaded with low concentrations (<100 nM) of 8-FDA-cAMP ( Figure S2 ). These experiments revealed that, at low cAMP levels, virtually all cAMP displays a pattern reflecting a bound (i.e., largely immobile) state of cAMP ( Figures 1 D and S2 D). This can be appreciated qualitatively by the long-time tail of the STICS function ( Figures 1 C, 1D, and S3 ). This observation is striking because several studies have uniformly reported that cAMP diffuses very quickly in cells ( Table S1 ). In stark contrast, our data suggest that, at basal concentrations, cAMP dynamics are severely constrained in cells.
Constrained cAMP diffusion in cells might be caused by cAMP binding to specific binding sites, resulting in “buffering.” To test whether such binding of 8-F-cAMP does indeed occur and would be overcome at higher cAMP concentrations by displacement from the binding sites, we stimulated HEK293 cells, after loading with 8-FDA-cAMP, with forskolin (fsk) (10 μM) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (100 μM) to maximally elevate intracellular cAMP levels. Analysis of cAMP dynamics under these stimulated conditions reveals a strikingly different spatiotemporal pattern; the long-time tail of the STICS function was largely lost, whereas a broader opening at shorter times was observed ( Figures 1 E, S2 E, and S3 ). This fast component can also be appreciated by looking at diffusion coefficients extracted from the rapid timescale of the mean square displacement (MSD) and also by looking at the average transit time of the molecules over a distance of 1 μm ( Figures 1 F, S2 E, and S2F); this highlights fast cAMP diffusion (tens up to hundreds of square micrometers per second) in fsk + IBMX-stimulated cells, similar to the diffusion speed of fluorescein. This is in stark contrast to cells under unstimulated conditions, where cAMP appears to be virtually immobile ( Figures 1 D and 1F).
An alternative possibility to explain restricted cAMP diffusion might be geometrical diffusion constraints in cells ( Richards et al., 2016 38. Richards, M. ∙ Lomas, O. ∙ Jalink, K. ... Intracellular tortuosity underlies slow cAMP diffusion in adult ventricular myocytes Cardiovasc. Res. 2016; 110 :395-407 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). To rule out a contribution of such constraints, we collected STICS functions for 8-F-cAMP dynamics in cytosolic preparations under basal conditions ( Figure 2 A) and after saturating binding sites with unlabeled cAMP ( Figure 2 B). A set of reference molecules was used, spanning a range of molecular weights of approximately three orders of magnitude: fluorescein alone (≈0.3 kDa), EGFP (≈25 kDa) ( Figure 2 C), and Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 (≈120 kDa) ( Figure 2 D). The diffusion coefficients obtained are displayed in Figure 2 E as a function of their molecular weights. Based on the diffusion coefficient of the heaviest molecule (D = 27 ± 2 μm 2 /s), we plotted the expected D values for the other molecules according to the Stokes-Einstein relationship, yielding the power law dependence D = molecular weight (MW) −1/3 (dotted line). Interestingly, all molecules followed the expected free diffusion behavior, with the notable exception of 8-F-cAMP. Here the values are more than twice below the expected diffusion coefficient, indicating binding to heavier components of the cytosolic extracts, in the approximate average range of 10–50 kDa (shaded area in Figure 2 E). Strikingly, 8-F-cAMP recovered its free diffusion value upon addition of 100 μM unlabeled cAMP to block all presumed cAMP-binding sites in the cytosolic preparations ( Figures 2 and S3 ).
Such immobilization of cAMP requires a high cAMP buffering capacity, and, in fact, for the main cAMP effector PKA, such sites have been reported to occur in cell lysates in the low micromolar range ( Walker-Gray et al., 2017 47. Walker-Gray, R. ∙ Stengel, F. ∙ Gold, M.G. Mechanisms for restraining cAMP-dependent protein kinase revealed by subunit quantitation and cross-linking approaches Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10414-10419 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). To quantify all cAMP binding sites, we estimated the buffering capacity of cytosolic preparations of HEK293 cells by titrating the concentration of 8-F-cAMP and determining the bound versus free ratio with steady-state anisotropy measurements ( STAR Methods ; Figure S4 ). Measurements done at two different dilutions of the cytosolic preparations gave a range of cytosolic cAMP binding sites of 6–15 μM which is, as expected, larger than reported for PKA alone ( Walker-Gray et al., 2017 47. Walker-Gray, R. ∙ Stengel, F. ∙ Gold, M.G. Mechanisms for restraining cAMP-dependent protein kinase revealed by subunit quantitation and cross-linking approaches Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10414-10419 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). The buffering capacity of entire cells (including particulate fractions, such as membranes, that are removed during cytosol preparations) is likely to be higher ( Corbin et al., 1977 12. Corbin, J.D. ∙ Sugden, P.H. ∙ Lincoln, T.M. ... Compartmentalization of adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate and adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase in heart tissue J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252 :3854-3861 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our model, we make a conservative assumption of 20 μM cAMP binding sites ( Methods S2 ).
Together, these data indicate very significant binding of cAMP to intracellular binding sites. Under basal conditions and concentrations, cAMP is mostly bound, but when it is displaced, it diffuses quickly, compatible with diffusion rates observed in earlier studies.
We and others have shown that observed cAMP gradients in cells require effective diffusion of cAMP to be restricted by orders of magnitude compared with what has been measured so far ( Rich et al., 2000 36. Rich, T.C. ∙ Fagan, K.A. ∙ Nakata, H. ... Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels colocalize with adenylyl cyclase in regions of restricted cAMP diffusion J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116 :147-161 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar , 2001 37. Rich, T.C. ∙ Fagan, K.A. ∙ Tse, T.E. ...

USA. 2001; 98 :13049-13054 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ; Feinstein et al., 2012 16. Feinstein, W.P. ∙ Zhu, B. ∙ Leavesley, S.J. ...

Estimating the magnitude of near-membrane PDE4 activity in living cells Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 309 :C415-C424 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings regarding cAMP dynamics ( Figures 1 and 2 ) show that such restricted diffusion dynamics during the spatial spread of the cAMP signals does indeed exist because of cAMP buffering. We reasoned that the resulting reduction of free cAMP might resolve these discrepancies because they might facilitate the generation of local cAMP gradients by PDEs. This would provide the first direct experimental evidence of local cAMP gradient formation.
To visualize such gradients in intact cells and directly map their dimensions, we developed a set of genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP nanorulers. Confocal images of all genetically encoded constructs in this study are compiled in Figure S5 M. These sensors are composed of the FRET-based cAMP sensor Epac1-camps ( Nikolaev et al., 2004 28. Nikolaev, V.O. ∙ Bünemann, M. ∙ Hein, L. ... Novel single chain cAMP sensors for receptor-induced signal propagation J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :37215-37218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (602) PubMed Google Scholar ) and a PDE, separated by single α-helical (SAH) domain linkers of defined nanometer length ( Figures 3 A and 3B). SAH domains are characterized by a modular sequence of ER/K amino acid repeats, resulting in a rod-like shape, which makes them ideally suited to spatially separate two protein moieties at a defined distance ( Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich, 2011 41. Sivaramakrishnan, S. ∙ Spudich, J.A. Systematic control of protein interaction using a modular ER/K α-helix linker Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :20467-20472 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). Stimulation of endogenous β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) with isoproterenol in intact HEK293 cells led to an increase in cytosolic cAMP, as measured by Epac1-camps ( Figure 3 C). Tethering a PDE4A1 directly to Epac1-camps completely blunted the isoproterenol-induced FRET response ( Figure 3 E). This must be specifically due to the tethered PDE4A1 activity because, first, the specific PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast induced a large and robust FRET change in the Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 sensor ( Figure 3 E), and, second, stoichiometric overexpression of PDE4A1 with Epac1-camps without tethering them together still gave a robust (albeit dampened) FRET signal ( Figures 3 D and 3G). These data indicate that tethered PDE4A1 effectively depletes cAMP from the region surrounding the Epac1-camps sensor.
Strikingly, upon spatial separation of Epac1-camps and PDE4A1 by 10 nm (Epac1-camps-SAH10-PDE4A1), isoproterenol stimulation induced a FRET response of almost the same amplitude as that seen with stoichiometric overexpression of both proteins individually ( Figures 3 F and 3G). As expected, inhibition of PDE4 activity in all constructs eliminated cAMP gradients ( Figure 3 H).
As controls for these experiments, we established that all constructs were expressed equally well, that the described effects were similar at all expression levels ( Figure S5 E), and that fusion of PDE4A1 or SAH10-PDE4A1 did not affect the affinity of Epac1-camps for cAMP ( Figure S5 A), nor did fusion of SAH10 to PDE4A1 reduce catalytic activity ( Figure S5 B–S5D). We also showed that the effect of tethered PDE4A1 was lost in a catalytically inactive mutant ( Figures S5 F and S5G). The highly significant differences between tethered and non-tethered or spacer-separated PDE4A1 ( Figure 3 G) strongly indicate that PDE4A1 creates a region of low cAMP concentration with a radius that is clearly smaller than 10 nm. We therefore define this as a low-cAMP nanodomain.
We reasoned that the size of such low-cAMP nanodomains might be determined by the type of PDE. Although the PDE4 family studied above comprises high-affinity (low-micromolar) but low-turnover (1–5 cAMP/s) enzymes, the PDE2 family represents the fastest enzymes with regard to cAMP degradation ( Bender and Beavo, 2006 6. Bender, A.T. ∙ Beavo, J.A. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases: molecular regulation to clinical use Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58 :488-520 Crossref Scopus (1526) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we fused a truncated version of PDE2A3, PDE2cat, comprising only its catalytic domain (amino acids [aa] 578–941), to Epac1-camps, generating Epac1-camps-PDE2cat. In line with the findings obtained with PDE4, tethered PDE2cat activity blunted the cAMP-FRET response to isoproterenol in relation to Epac1-camps alone ( Figure 4 A versus 4 C). Only upon specific inhibition of PDE2 with BAY 60-7550 did Epac1-camps-PDE2cat detect an isoproterenol-mediated cAMP increase ( Figure 4 C). Stoichiometric expression of Epac1-camps and PDE2cat individually still led to a robust FRET signal upon isoproterenol stimulation ( Figure 4 B). These data confirm that the tethered PDE2 activity generates a low-cAMP nanodomain in its immediate vicinity ( Figure 4 E).
We then designed another cAMP nanoruler, Epac1-camps-SAH30-PDE2cat, which records cAMP levels at 30-nm distance to PDE2cat ( Figure 4 D). In contrast to the observations with Epac1-camps-SAH10-PDE4A1, we found a still significant effect on cAMP levels at 30-nm distance from PDE2cat (Epac1-camps-SAH30-PDE2cat) ( Figures 4 D and 4E). As expected, inhibition of PDE2 activity in all constructs eliminated cAMP gradients ( Figure 4 F). To account for the higher catalytic activity of PDE2cat than of PDE4A1, the PDE2cat experiments were performed at lower expression levels ( Figure S5 H). Again, we also showed that Epac1-camps-PDE2cat and Epac1-camps-SAH30-PDE2cat sensors were not compromised with regard to cAMP affinity ( Figure S5 I) or PDE catalytic activity ( Figures S5 J–S5L).
Combined, our data suggest that, under basal conditions, cells are able to buffer most of their cAMP. This, in turn, allows PDEs to generate low-cAMP nanodomains. Only upon stimulation of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and inhibition of PDEs is the level of cAMP raised sufficiently to overcome the capacity of the endogenous buffers and to progressively “flood” the small domains and, ultimately, entire cells.
We then aimed to assess whether such low-cAMP nanodomains might also be demonstrated in cytosolic preparations and to quantify the concentration threshold at which they might become flooded because PDEs are no longer able to establish significant cAMP gradients ( Figure 5 ). Concentration-effect curves of cAMP-induced FRET changes of Epac1-camps are shown for the same conditions and constructs as used in cells for PDE4A1 ( Figure 5 A) and PDE2cat ( Figure 5 B), and the resultant shifts of the half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values are given in Figure 5 C. These data show, for Epac1-camps, an apparent cAMP affinity of 2.5 μM, which is shifted to 10-fold higher concentrations by tethered PDE4A1, whereas individual stoichiometric expression of Epac1-camps and PDE4A1 only caused a 2-fold affinity shift ( Figures 5 A and 5C). In line with the results obtained in intact cells, separating PDE4A1 from Epac1-camps by 10 nm reduced the shift to almost the same level as stoichiometric expression, essentially abolishing the specific nanodomains ( Figures 5 A and 5C). Analogous experiments performed with PDE2cat revealed a somewhat larger (15-fold) shift for the directly tethered PDE, and here, as in cells, a 30-nm spacer only partially reduced the shift ( Figures 5 B and 5C). Inspection of the curves shows that the shifts also exist at higher cAMP concentrations, suggesting that the low-cAMP nanodomains become fully flooded only at high concentrations of cAMP.
To investigate directly whether cAMP nanodomains translate into similarly targeted PKA signaling, we designed analogous targeted PKA activity reporters. Fusing PDE4A1 to the PKA FRET sensor AKAR4 completely suppressed detection of PKA activity in response to stimulation of HEK293 cells with isoproterenol, whereas AKAR4 alone gave a robust signal ( Figures 6 A–6D). This indicates that the PDE “protects” PKA in its immediate vicinity from cAMP stimulation.
To demonstrate that PDEs shape local PKA gradients, we used full-length PDE2A3. The long N terminus of PDE2A3 should separate the catalytic center of the PDE from N-terminally fused sensors by several nanometers ( Pandit et al., 2009 33. Pandit, J. ∙ Forman, M.D. ∙ Fennell, K.F. ... Mechanism for the allosteric regulation of phosphodiesterase 2A deduced from the X-ray structure of a near full-length construct Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106 :18225-18230 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). In fact, this construct allowed the respective sensors to again detect isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP levels ( Figure 6 E) or PKA activity ( Figure 6 F). Interestingly, the constructs detected a comparable relative level of cAMP and of PKA activity ( Figure 6 G), strongly suggesting that the amount of cAMP at a given location in the cell dictates the degree of local PKA activity.
As controls for these experiments, we showed that only inhibitors of the relevant tethered PDE lead to phosphorylation of the tethered PKA substrate, whereas inhibitors of other PDEs have no effect ( Figure S6 ). These data confirm the specificity of our results and illustrate that individual PDEs regulate cAMP signaling specifically in their immediate vicinity.
To describe our findings in quantitative terms, we use a biophysical model for formation of cAMP gradients by PDEs at the nanoscale ( Methods S2 ). Based on our experimental observations ( Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , and S4 ), this model analyzes the effects of binding sites on free cAMP concentrations in cells and on the spatial profile of cAMP gradients generated by PDE-mediated degradation.
The model confirms that cAMP gradients around PDEs are of nanometer size ( Figure 7 B; Methods S2 ). Figure 7 B illustrates the free cAMP concentration at a distance from PDE4A1 (in red) superimposed on the experimental free cAMP concentration ranges measured by using our FRET sensors at the PDE, 10 nm away, and in the bulk of the cytosol. The concentration gradient follows the equation [cAMP] = [cAMP] bulk (1−R 0 /r), where [cAMP] denotes the concentration of free cAMP, [cAMP] bulk the concentration of free bulk cAMP far from the PDE, r the distance from the PDE catalytic site, and R 0 is a radius where [cAMP] would be equal to zero. This radius R 0 relates not only to the geometrical size of the PDE but also to the flux of cAMP; i.e., the rate of degradation at the “sink” ( Methods S2 ).
Moreover, on the basis of the cAMP concentration transients we obtain upon inhibition of PDE4A1 (see, e.g., Figure 3 E), we can infer a turnover number of ~320 molecules/s. To assess whether these PDE turnover rates are compatible with the model, we concomitantly addressed the question of whether PDE4A1 exists in cells as mono- or oligomers.

Methods. 2020; 17 :273-275 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), shows that Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 is largely dimeric (in contrast to Epac1-camps alone) ( Figure S7 ). Therefore, our experiments and the biophysical model uniformly demonstrate that a single PDE4 has a turnover number of ~160 molecules cAMP/s in intact cells, which is sufficient to deplete a nanometer-sized region of cAMP and, thus, protects local cAMP effectors from being activated ( Figure 6 ).

Section: Discussion

Despite a wealth of indirect evidence that cAMP compartments might exist in cells and should be under the control of PDEs, the molecular basis of how cAMP might be sequestered in cells has remained unknown for decades. Here we provide the molecular mechanisms of such cAMP compartmentation at the nanoscale.
Our data introduce the novel concept that cellular cAMP is governed by catch-and-release or buffered dynamics ( Figure 7 A). Under basal conditions, cAMP is mostly bound and effectively diffuses very slowly, if at all, and its free concentration is well below the levels of total cAMP; i.e., the levels measured by the usual biochemical assays. When cAMP molecules are released from the binding sites, they diffuse fast, compatible with diffusion rates observed previously, but are re-captured quickly by the next cAMP binding proteins ( Figure 7 A, left). This is entirely compatible with earlier experiments by us (e.g., Nikolaev et al., 2004 28. Nikolaev, V.O. ∙ Bünemann, M. ∙ Hein, L. ... Novel single chain cAMP sensors for receptor-induced signal propagation J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 :37215-37218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (602) PubMed Google Scholar ) and others ( Table S1 ), showing that rapid diffusion refers to the first time point where a stimulus can be noticed in different areas of a cell; however, the corresponding signals continue to increase for a long time thereafter, compatible with continued production of cAMP and its slow effective diffusion. The experimental approach we apply here has the advantage of using, for the first time, only trace amounts of fluorescent cAMP, not only allowing direct tracking of cAMP dynamics (as opposed to indirect tracking using FRET reporters) but also allowing measurements at or near basal cAMP levels, which permits us to clearly demonstrate buffered diffusion.
When cAMP levels are increased (for example, by receptor stimulation), the binding sites become progressively saturated, free cAMP increases, and diffusion occurs first from one binding site to the next and, ultimately, when the binding sites become saturated, by free diffusion ( Figure 7 A, right panel). Buffering of the initial cAMP wave ensures that free cAMP levels are kept in a range that then permits individual PDEs to create and “defend” a nanometer-sized space around them with an even lower concentration of cAMP, allowing effectors such as PKA to be “protected” from external cAMP-mediated stimuli within these nanometer-size domains. Under these conditions, our data indicate that PDE catalytic rates are sufficient to metabolize the few free cAMP molecules that are present in these small volumes; when the ambient cAMP concentrations increase, the low cAMP domains become smaller. The downstream consequence of these nanometer-size regions of low cAMP is that PKA (and, presumably, other cAMP effectors) remain insensitive to cAMP signals until cAMP is increased to levels that are sufficient to progressively fill these regions ( Figure 7 A).
For our buffered diffusion model to hold, the requirement is that the buffering capacity of the cytoplasm is sufficient. In agreement with recent determinations ( Walker-Gray et al., 2017 47. Walker-Gray, R. ∙ Stengel, F. ∙ Gold, M.G. Mechanisms for restraining cAMP-dependent protein kinase revealed by subunit quantitation and cross-linking approaches Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10414-10419 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ), we directly determined the number of cytosolic cAMP binding sites to be in the range of 6–15 μM. It has been shown that ~30%–50% of the total cellular PKA is immobile and associated with the particulate fraction we remove during our cytosol preparations ( Corbin et al., 1977 12. Corbin, J.D. ∙ Sugden, P.H. ∙ Lincoln, T.M. ... Compartmentalization of adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate and adenosine 3′:5′-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase in heart tissue J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252 :3854-3861 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the total amount of cAMP binding sites in cells is likely to be even higher than quantified here in cytosolic preparations. The discovery of the biomolecular condensates described in an accompanying paper strikingly illustrates additional “sponges” for cAMP ( Zhang et al., 2020 51. Zhang, J.Z. ∙ Lu, T.W. ∙ Stolerman, L.M. ... Phase Separation of a PKA Regulatory Subunit Controls cAMP Compartmentation and Oncogenic Signaling Cell. 2020; 182 :1531-1544 this issue Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar [this issue of Cell ]) that effectively increase the buffering capacity of the cell. Together, these sites are sufficient to very significantly buffer cellular cAMP levels, much like buffering of intracellular calcium, where a large number of bindings sites reduce the free concentration and the effective diffusion rate of calcium ions ( Wagner and Keizer, 1994 46. Wagner, J. ∙ Keizer, J. Effects of rapid buffers on Ca 2+ diffusion and Ca 2+ oscillations Biophys. J. 1994; 67 :447-456 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Calculation of a concentration gradient around a single PDE4A1 based on the Smoluchowski model ( Smoluchowski, 1916 43. Smoluchowski, M.V. Drei Vorträge über Diffusion, Brownsche Bewegung und Koagulation von Kolloidteilchen Physik. Zeit. 1916; 17 :557-571 585–599 Google Scholar ; Rice, 1985 35. Rice, S.A. Diffusion-Limited Reactions. Comprehensive Chemical Kinetics Elsevier, 1985 Google Scholar ; Methods S2 ) shows that a nanometer-size region of significantly lowered cAMP does indeed occur ( Figure 7 B). Given the largely dimeric PDE4A1 structure, our data therefore indicate that the measured cAMP concentration values in the bulk and at the tethered FRET sensor are in agreement with an individual PDE4A1 turnover rate of about 160 molecules/s. Although this is higher than values reported for the purified enzyme ( Bender and Beavo, 2006 6. Bender, A.T. ∙ Beavo, J.A. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases: molecular regulation to clinical use Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58 :488-520 Crossref Scopus (1526) PubMed Google Scholar ), these latter values might well be reduced because of damage during purification, whereas ours are some of the first data providing individual PDE4 turnover rates in intact cells and, therefore, do not conflict with previous literature values. In fact, in intact cells, very high PDE activity has already been reported ( Nikolaev et al., 2005 29. Nikolaev, V.O. ∙ Gambaryan, S. ∙ Engelhardt, S. ... Real-time monitoring of the PDE2 activity of live cells: hormone-stimulated cAMP hydrolysis is faster than hormone-stimulated cAMP synthesis J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280 :1716-1719 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). The excellent agreement of the data of the cAMP measurements in intact cells and in cytosolic preparations ( Methods S2 ) further supports this conclusion.
The agreement of the size of low-cAMP nanodomains with that of PKA activity measured with the AKAR4 sensor suggests that nanometer-size PDE domains indeed modulate downstream target activation and might represent functional modules of cAMP signaling. The demonstration of such functional cAMP and PKA nanodomains is further in line with recent observations by super-resolution microscopy of PKA signaling hotspots with a diameter of 100–200 nm ( Mo et al., 2017 27. Mo, G.C. ∙ Ross, B. ∙ Hertel, F. ... Genetically encoded biosensors for visualizing live-cell biochemical activity at super-resolution Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :427-434 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). To constrain PKA activity to such small domains requires that its catalytic subunit is rapidly recaptured by regulatory subunits after activation ( Mo et al., 2017 27. Mo, G.C. ∙ Ross, B. ∙ Hertel, F. ... Genetically encoded biosensors for visualizing live-cell biochemical activity at super-resolution Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :427-434 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ; Walker-Gray et al., 2017 47. Walker-Gray, R. ∙ Stengel, F. ∙ Gold, M.G. Mechanisms for restraining cAMP-dependent protein kinase revealed by subunit quantitation and cross-linking approaches Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :10414-10419 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ) or that PKA can function as an intact holoenzyme ( Smith et al., 2017 42. Smith, F.D. ∙ Esseltine, J.L. ∙ Nygren, P.J. ... Local protein kinase A action proceeds through intact holoenzymes Science. 2017; 356 :1288-1293 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our data with PDE2 demonstrate that longer-range effects of PDEs could also be possible for cAMP and PKA signals. The mechanisms of these longer-range effects need to be explored further, but we would like to note the possibility of a larger effective radius (possibly because of the fact that, in these experiments, we used only isolated catalytic domains of PDE2 unlikely to remain immobile in intact cells because of lack of targeting domains) or of more complex arrangements. However, the excellent agreement of the data from intact cells and cytosolic preparations suggests that these observations are indeed a property of our PDE2 constructs.
Our demonstration of sharp concentration gradients along with direct translation into graded PKA activity explains how cAMP can act very locally and, thus, trigger responses spatially limited at the nanometer scale. The very small size of cAMP domains strongly suggests that compartmentalized cAMP signaling is controlled in a stochastic manner by individual molecules of cAMP. This spatially tight control provides the basis for the physiologically important specificity of cAMP signaling. Disruption of local cAMP signaling has been suggested to be associated with a variety of diseases ( Gold et al., 2013 18. Gold, M.G. ∙ Gonen, T. ∙ Scott, J.D. Local cAMP signaling in disease at a glance J. Cell Sci. 2013; 126 :4537-4543 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), such as heart failure ( Nikolaev et al., 2010 31. Nikolaev, V.O. ∙ Moshkov, A. ∙ Lyon, A.R. ... Beta2-adrenergic receptor redistribution in heart failure changes cAMP compartmentation Science. 2010; 327 :1653-1657 Crossref Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cancer ( Zhang et al., 2020 51. Zhang, J.Z. ∙ Lu, T.W. ∙ Stolerman, L.M. ... Phase Separation of a PKA Regulatory Subunit Controls cAMP Compartmentation and Oncogenic Signaling Cell. 2020; 182 :1531-1544 this issue Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Elucidation of the molecular basis of cAMP compartmentation now permits us to link disruption of cAMP compartmentation to disease and, thus, to explore novel therapeutic strategies that are based on a cell’s ability to orchestrate cAMP signaling in nanometer-size domains.

HEK-tsA201 cells (ECACC 96121229 from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH), indicated as HEK293 throughout the manuscript, were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L glucose (PAN biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Pen/Strep, GIBCO Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 2 mM-glutamine (PAN biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . Cells were passaged in T75 flasks (SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) every 2-4 days when reaching a confluency of 80%–90%. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert TM Mycoplasma Detection Kit from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland). Cell lines were not contaminated with mycoplasma.
For single-cell FRET measurements HEK293 cells were plated on 24 mm glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific GmbH, Waltham, MA, USA) in 6-well-dishes (SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) at a density of approximately 2 × 10 5 cells/mL. Transfection of plasmids (600 ng for Epac1-camps-based constructs, 300 ng for AKAR4-based constructs) was carried out 6 h after seeding using the Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN GmbH, Venlo, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 18-24 h, cells were used for imaging.
For FRET measurements in cytosolic preparations, HEK293 cells were plated on 100 mm dishes (SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) to give a density of approximately 50%–60%. 8 h later cells were transfected with a total amount of 20 μg cDNA (10 μg cDNA encoding the gene of interest and 10 μg pcDNA3) using calcium phosphate precipitation. 48 h after transfection, cells were used for experiments.
The designed fluorogenic cAMP analog 8-(2-(5(6)-carboxyfluoresceindiacetate)-aminoethylthio)adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (abbreviation: 8-FDA-cAMP ) was custom-synthesized by Biolog Life Science Institute, Bremen, Germany (details in Methods S1 ). The identity and purity of 8-FDA-cAMP were assessed with mass spectrometry and HPLC, respectively, by Biolog Life Science Institute, Bremen, Germany (details in Methods S1 ).
8-F-cAMP (the de-esterified fluorescent analog of the membrane-permeable prodrug 8-FDA-cAMP) was used for the photophysical and biochemical characterization. To provide the photophysical characteristics of 8-F-cAMP, we recorded the absorption, excitation, and emission spectra of 8-F-cAMP (details in Methods S1 ). To determine the binding affinity of 8-F-cAMP to its binding protein PKA regulatory subunit I alpha (PKA-RIα), we performed steady-state anisotropy measurements (details in Methods S1 ). To show that 8-F-cAMP activates downstream signaling, we used the PKA Colorimetric Activity Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) which reports on the activation of endogenous PKA in HEK293 cell lysates (details in Methods S1 ). To determine the stability of 8-F-cAMP toward hydrolysis by PDEs, we conducted PDE activity assays using a purified PDE from bovine brain and a colorimetric PDE assay (PDELight TM , Lonza) (details in Methods S1 ).
The cDNA encoding PDE2A (NM_002599) was purchased from OriGene, Rockville, MD, USA. The AKAR4 plasmid ( Depry et al., 2011 13. Depry, C. ∙ Allen, M.D. ∙ Zhang, J. Visualization of PKA activity in plasma membrane microdomains Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7 :52-58 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar )was a kind gift of Dr. Jin Zhang (UC San Diego, USA) and a plasmid encoding the IRES2 sequence was kindly provided by Dr. Gary Lewin (MDC Berlin, Germany).
To generate Epac1-camps-SAH10-PDE4A1 (and Epac1-camps-SAH30-PDE4A1) the SAH10 (and SAH30) linkers were PCR amplified from plasmids encoding systematic protein affinity strength modulation (SPASM) sensors published previously ( Sivaramakrishnan and Spudich, 2011 41. Sivaramakrishnan, S. ∙ Spudich, J.A. Systematic control of protein interaction using a modular ER/K α-helix linker Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108 :20467-20472 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ), and BamHI and AscI restriction sites were introduced using the following set of primers (SAH10: #1: 5′-AAAAAA GGATCC GGAGAAGAGGAAGAGAAA -3′, #2: 5′-AAAAAA GGCGCGCC CAGAGCCCTTCTTCTTGCGTTTTTC -3′, priming sequence underlined, restriction sites in italics; SAH30: #3: 5′-AAAAAAA GGATCC GGAGAAGAGGAAGAGAAGAAG -3′, #4: 5′-AAAAAA GGCGCGCC CAGAGCCTCTTTGTTTTCTTTCTGC -3′). PCR fragments were cut with BamHI and AscI and cloned in frame between Epac1-camps and PDE4A1 using a variant of Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 ( Herget et al., 2008 21. Herget, S. ∙ Lohse, M.J. ∙ Nikolaev, V.O. Real-time monitoring of phosphodiesterase inhibition in intact cells Cell. Signal. 2008; 20 :1423-1431 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) as vector. To generate Epac1-camps-PDE2A3, Epac1-camps-PDE2cat (amino acids 578-941 from PDE2A3), and Epac1-camps-SAH30-PDE2cat, the coding sequences of PDE2A3 and PDE2cat were PCR amplified and AscI and NotI restriction sites were inserted by using the following set of primers, respectively (PDE2A3: #5: 5′-AAAAAAA GGCGCGCC GGGCAGGCATGCGGCCAC -3′, #6: 5′-AAAAAA GCGGCCGC TCACTCAGCATCAAGGCT -3′; and PDE2cat: #7: 5′-AAAAAAA GGCGCGCC TCCGACGATGAGTATACCAAACTT -3′, 6#). The respective PCR products were cut with AscI and NotI and cloned in frame into Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 and Epac1-camps-SAH30-PDE4A1 where the PDE4A1 sequence was cut out with AscI and NotI. All constructs derived by restriction enzyme cloning were transformed and amplified in XL1-Blue competent E.coli (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).
AKAR4-PDE4A1 and AKAR4-PDE2A3 were generated by Gibson assembly using Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 and Epac1-camps-PDE2A3, respectively, as templates ( Gibson et al., 2009 17. Gibson, D.G. ∙ Young, L. ∙ Chuang, R.Y. ... Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 :343-345 Crossref Scopus (6587) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate AKAR4-PDE4A1, AKAR4 was PCR amplified using a pair of primers (#8: 5′-CTCACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTT TAAGGATCCCATGGTGAGCAAGGG -3′, #9: 5′-CACCAAGGGCATGGATCC CTCGATGTTGTGGCGGATCTT -3′) and inserted upstream of PDE4A1 in its vector which was linearized with the following primers (#10: 5′-AAGATCCGCCACAACATCGAG GGATCCATGCCCTTGGTG -3′, #11: 5′-CCCTTGCTCACCATGGGATCCTTA AAGCTTGGGTCTCCCTATAGTGAG -3′). To generate AKAR4-PDE2A3, AKAR4 was PCR amplified using another pair of primers (#12: 5′-GGGAGACCCAAGCT TAAGGATCCCATGGTGAGCAAG -3′, #13: 5′-GCCGCATGCCTGCCCGGCGCGCCT CTCGATGTTGTGGCGGAT -3′) and inserted upstream of PDE2A3 in its vector which was linearized with the following primers (#14: 5′-ATCCGCCACAACATCGAG AGGCGCGCCGGGCAGGCATGCGGC -3′, #15: 5′-CTTGCTCACCATGGGATCCTTA AGCTTGGGTCTCCCTAT -3′).
To generate Epac1-camps-IRES2-PDE4A1, the IRES2 sequence was PCR amplified with the indicated primers (#16: 5′-GACGAGCTGTACAAGTGAGGATCC GCCCCTCTCCCTCCCCCCCCCCTA -3′, #17: 5′-GCAGAAGAAATCCACCAAGGGCAT TGTGGCCATATTATCATCGTGTTT -3′) and inserted in frame in between Epac1-camps and PDE4A1 in the construct Epac1-camps-PDE4A1 which was linearized with the following primers (#18: 5′-AAACACGATGATAATATGGCCACA ATGCCCTTGGTGGATTTCTTCTGC -3′, #19: 5′-TAGGGGGGGGGGAGGGAGAGGGGC GGATCCTCACTTGTACAGCTCGTC -3′. Epac1-camps-IRES-PDE2cat was generated following exactly the same strategy using the following primers (IRES2:#20: 5′-GACGAGCTGTACAAGTGAGGATCCAGGCGCGCC GCCCCTCTCCCTCCCCCCCCCCTA -3′,#21: 5′-AAGTTTGGTATACTCATCGTCGGACAT TGTGGCCATATTATCATCGTGTTT -3′; and linearization of Epac1-camps-PDE2A3: #22: 5′-AAACACGATGATAATATGGCCACAATG TCCGACGATGAGTATACCAAACTT-3′ , #23: 5′-TAGGGGGGGGGGAGGGAGAGGGGC GGCGCGCCTGGATCCTCACTTGTACAGCTCGTC-3′ ). For assembly of the PCR products the Gibson Assembly® Master Mix (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All constructs derived by Gibson cloning were transformed and amplified in NEB® 5-alpha Competent E.coli (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany).
All sequences were validated by automated sequencing of each construct by Eurofins (Luxembourg, Luxembourg) or LGC (Teddington, UK). Confocal images of HEK293 cells expressing all FRET-based constructs are compiled in Figure S5 .
8-FDA-cAMP and FDA cell penetration assays were performed using a 96-well plate reader (Neo2, Biotek, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany), measuring whole fluorescence emission per well at 505 nm upon 488 nm excitation. 50,000 cells/well were seeded, and 24 wells were measured, in three replicates, for each experimental condition. Cells were kept in HBSS buffer, where spontaneous conversion of FDA and 8-FDA-cAMP to their fluorescent form is negligible. Confocal images of HEK293 cells loaded with either FDA or 8-FDA-cAMP are found in Figures S2 B and S2C.
Fluorescein-labeled compounds of different molecular weight (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran of 20, 70kDa, and 250 kDa) were dissolved in water, and the pH was set to pH = 9 by addition of NaOH. To pre-activate FDA into fluorescein, ester bonds in FDA were broken by incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes at pH 9. Concentrations were determined by absorbance spectroscopy in a ThermoFisher Evolution300 spectrophotometer. Measurements were performed at a final compound concentration of 100 nM. Approximately 40 μL of solution were inserted into an imaging chamber formed by a #1.5 coverslip immobilized onto a glass slide by melting two parallel stripes of Parafilm (Bemis Company, Neenah, USA).
Linescans were acquired in a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), with a resonant scan head allowing 12 kHz line rate. Excitation was achieved using a white light laser, at the wavelengths of 488 nm. Excitation power was set to 10% of the maximal laser output (0.3 mW at 488 nm), and 2∙10 6 lines were collected within the sample, with a length of 256 pixels and a pixel size of 50 nm. A 40x 1.4 NA objective was used. Detection was performed in photon counting mode using Leica hybrid detectors. For 8-FDA-cAMP linescan experiments cells were plated on 25 mm (#1.5) coverslips and loaded for 30 minutes with 100 nM 8-FDA-cAMP at 37°C. Cells were then washed three times in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Thermofisher) and imaged in HBSS.
Statistical analysis of the fluorescence fluctuations present in a sequence of images or a kymograph allows constructing a spatial-temporal correlation plot, containing the average single molecule transit times between any two arbitrary positions along the scan line ( Ries et al., 2009 39.

Visualizing the molecular mode of motion from a correlative analysis of localization microscopy datasets Opt. Lett. 2016; 41 :4503-4506 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such two-dimensional plots, namely Spatial-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (STICS) functions have two axes: a space and a time axis. The overall shape of the STICS function for diffusion is that of a ‘plume’, broadening in space as a function of time ( Figures 1 A and S1 A–S1C). This broadening reflects the process of diffusion: the probability of finding a Brownian particle which is found at x = 0 for time t = 0 is a normal distribution of increasing variance as time elapses. The more rapid the broadening of the plume ( Figures S1 A–S1C), the more rapid the molecular diffusion process. Horizontal sections of the plot provide Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) information (i.e., broadening as a function of time) ( Figure S1 D). Vertical cross sections, known as average Pair Correlation functions, reflect the distribution of molecular transit times across a defined distance d ( Figure S1 G). These reflect the probability of finding a molecule at a given distance from its original position at time 0, after a time lag t . The position of the peak, reflecting the broadening of the STICS function, shifts to longer times as the diffusion coefficient decreases.
The temporal resolution of the measurement is determined by how rapidly the subsequent acquisitions of the same area (or line) are performed. In our setup, taking advantage of resonant scanners operating at 12 kHz, we could reach a temporal resolution of about 80 μs.
Determining faster (> 100 μm 2 /s) diffusion is at the limit of this method, but it was possible to observe a convergence to previously measured cAMP diffusion values, viz. 135 ± 20 μm 2 /s, by fitting progressively shorter time-lags. Furthermore, the distribution of rapid arrival times ( Figure S2 G) in forskolin/IBMX-stimulated cells further confirms the presence of a fast-moving component upon displacement, in the form of a peak at about 5 ms travel time over one μm.
Briefly, the 256 × 2∙10 6 kymograph is corrected for drifts and slow fluctuations using a random number addition detrending, within a moving window of approximately 250∙10 3 lines, which corresponds to about 20 s. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and its complex conjugate were then calculated, and their product was inverse FFTed to yield the autocorrelation function of the kymograph, namely the STICS function. We used a custom algorithm written in IGOR Pro (WaveMetrics), as previously described ( Serfling et al., 2019 40. Serfling, R. ∙ Seidel, L. ∙ Bock, A. ... Quantitative Single-Residue Bioorthogonal Labeling of G Protein-Coupled Receptors in Live Cells ACS Chem. Biol. 2019; 14 :1141-1149 Crossref Scopus (29) PubMed Google Scholar ; Di Rienzo and Annibale, 2016 14. Di Rienzo, C. ∙ Annibale, P. Visualizing the molecular mode of motion from a correlative analysis of localization microscopy datasets Opt. Lett. 2016; 41 :4503-4506 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). For pure diffusion, the equation describing the STICS Function reads as follows ( Ries et al., 2009 39. Ries, J. ∙ Chiantia, S. ∙ Schwille, P. Accurate determination of membrane dynamics with line-scan FCS Biophys. J. 2009; 96 :1999-2008 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (148) PubMed Google Scholar ): 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝛾 𝜋 ⋅ 𝑁 ⋅ ( 4 ⋅ 𝐷 ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝜎 2 0 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − ( ( 𝑥 − 𝑥 0 ) 2 ( 4 ⋅ 𝐷 ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝜎 2 0 ) ) (Equation 1) With x and t being space and time, respectively, and γ the so-called gamma factor of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the microscope, normally 0.35. N is the number of fluorescent molecules in the PSF, D the diffusion coefficient of the species and σ 0 the waist of the PSF (of the order of 250-300 nm for the wavelength used). For each given t, Equation 1 can also be used for a line by line fit of the STICS function (as described in Figure S1 D), yielding the MSDs reported in Figure S1 E, as graphically highlighted in Figure S1 F.
In the case of two species displaying distinct concentrations and diffusion rates, the equation becomes (with 1 and 2 referring to each of the two species, respectively): 𝐺 ⁡ ( 𝑥 , 𝑡 ) = 𝛾 𝜋 ⋅ 𝑁 ⁢ 1 ⋅ ( 4 ⋅ 𝐷 ⁢ 1 ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝜎 2 0 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − ( ( 𝑥 − 𝑥 0 ) 2 ( 4 ⋅ 𝐷 ⁢ 1 ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝜎 2 0 ) ) + 𝛾 𝜋 ⋅ 𝑁 ⁢ 2 ⋅ ( 4 ⋅ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝜎 2 0 ) ⁢ 𝑒 − ( ( 𝑥 − 𝑥 0 ) 2 ( 4 ⋅ 𝐷 ⁢ 2 ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝜎 2 0 ) ) (Equation 2)
When two species with distinct diffusion coefficients combine, e.g., a fast diffusing and a slow diffusing component/bound component, a fast broadening STICS function and a slow one overlap. Figures S2 H and S2I illustrate how this reflects in terms of the measured STICS function and recovered MSD, respectively: a first rapid increase of MSD is followed by a decrease and again an increase, although at a slow pace. This should be interpreted in the following way: when the temporal resolution of the sampling is high enough, e.g., less than 10 ms as in Figure S2 I, then rapid ‘jumps’ of the molecules can be appreciated. However, once the temporal resolution is lower, e.g., above 100 ms, then the fast jumps cannot be captured anymore, and we are in the domain where the slower diffusing species dominates the MSD. This simulated plot represents the scenario observed in Figure 1 for the fsk/IBMX stimulated cells, where a fraction of the 8-F-cAMP diffuses very rapidly, on the background of a major fraction that still moves very slowly.
Transfected HEK293 cells were transferred to imaging chambers (Attofluor TM , ThermoFisher Scientifics), washed twice with FRET imaging buffer (144 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 (Carl Roth GmbH & Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany), 1 mM MgCl 2 (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH); pH = 7.3). FRET measurements were carried out at room temperature using an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8 inverted microscope, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an oil immersion objective (HC PL APO 40x/1.30, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), a dichroic beam splitter (T505lpxr, Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany), a high-speed polychromator (VisiChrome, Visitron Systems), a Xe-Lamp (75W, 5.7 A, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan), a camera system (Photometrics Prime 95B CMOS camera, Visitron systems) with an Optosplit II dual emission image splitter (Cairn, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK) with CFP 470/24 and YFP 535/30 emission filters (Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT, USA). Cells were brought into focus and regions of interest were drawn around single cells using the VisiView® 4.0 imaging software (Visitron Systems). Spatial homogeneity of the expression of the constructs was taken into account by ROI selection. In general, large ROIs containing most of the cell allow for averaging out any residual spatial heterogeneity within the cytosol. A time series of images was recorded every 5 s upon 100 ms exposure to 436 nm light. After reaching a stable baseline, cells were stimulated with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Iso, 10 μM), followed by specific PDE inhibition (300 nM roflumilast for PDE4A1 constructs, and 100 nM BAY 60-7550 for PDE2cat and PDE2A3 constructs). To reach maximal cAMP levels, a combination of fsk (10 μM) and IBMX (100 μM) were applied at the end of every experiment. Data from individual channels (CFP and YFP) were exported and corrected offline for background and bleedthrough ( Börner et al., 2011 7. Börner, S. ∙ Schwede, F. ∙ Schlipp, A. ... FRET measurements of intracellular cAMP concentrations and cAMP analog permeability in intact cells Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6 :427-438 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Inverted FRET ratios (CFP/FRET) were calculated and normalized to baseline (average of 10 data points before compound addition, set to 0% and fsk/IBMX (max cAMP response, set to 100%). After every experiment, direct YFP excitation at 505 nm (emission: 560 nm) was recorded to evaluate expression levels of the sensors.
Transfected HEK293 cells on a 10 cm plate (corresponding to approximately 1-1.5x10 7 cells) were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (Sigma-Aldrich) and harvested in 300 μL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7.4) containing 1 mM PMSF and protease inhibitors (20 μg/mL trypsin inhibitor from soybean and 60 μg/mL benzamidine). Cells were lysed by homogenization (two rounds of 10 s each using an T8 Ultra-Turrax® homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany)). Nuclei and cell debris were spun down by centrifugation (1000xg, 5 min, 4°C). To obtain the cytosolic fraction, the supernatant was centrifuged again (100.000xg, 30 min, 4°C). The resultant supernatants were transferred to a quartz cuvette and adjusted with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 (pH 7.4) to comparable sensor densities (assessed by direct YFP excitation). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a LS50B spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) at 436 nm excitation, and emission was measured between 460 and 550 nm after adding increasing concentrations of cAMP. 480/525 nm FRET emission ratios were calculated at different cAMP concentrations and fitted with a three-parameter logistic function and normalized to the lower (absence of cAMP; set 0%) and upper plateau (saturating concentrations of cAMP, set 100%) of the concentration-effect curves.
Cytosolic HEK293 cell preparations for the quantification of buffering capacities ( Figure S4 ) were prepared as follows: HEK293 cells grown on a 10 cm dish, containing approximately 1 × 10 7 cells, were harvested in 300 μL binding buffer (20 mM MOPS, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% CHAPS, pH7) containing 1mM PMSF and protease inhibitors (20 μg/mL trypsin inhibitor from soybean and 60 μg/mL benzamidine) and cytosolic extracts were prepared according to the protocol described above ( FRET measurements in cytosolic preparations ). Estimating an average cell volume of 1 pL per cell, the total cell volume of harvested cells (10 μL) is diluted 30 times (30x) by addition of 300 μL binding buffer for harvesting. For anisotropy measurements, 0.5 mM IBMX were added and the cytosolic preparation was further diluted twice or 50 times with binding buffer, resulting in a 60x or 1500x dilution, respectively. Steady state anisotropy (from here on only referred to as ‘anisotropy’) as well as fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were measured on a Horiba Yobin-Yvon Fluoromax Plus spectrophotometer using the appropriate routine of the FluorEssence software. 8-F-cAMP and fluorescein were both excited at 485 nm and fluorescence was measured at 535 nm. Slit width was 5 nm for both excitation and emission. 600 μL of solution were pipetted in a quartz cuvette (Thorlabs). Integration time was set to between 1-10 s. Fluorescence intensity I was measured along all polarizations (I hh , I hv , I vv , I vh ) and anisotropy r was calculated according to the standard equation ( Jameson and Ross, 2010 24. Jameson, D.M. ∙ Ross, J.A. Fluorescence polarization/anisotropy in diagnostics and imaging Chem. Rev. 2010; 110 :2685-2708 Crossref Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ): 𝑟 = 𝐼 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝐼 ℎ ⁢ ℎ 𝐼 ℎ ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝐼 𝑣 ⁢ ℎ − 1 𝐼 𝑣 ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝐼 ℎ ⁢ ℎ 𝐼 ℎ ⁢ 𝑣 ⁢ 𝐼 𝑣 ⁢ ℎ + 2 (Equation 3) When imaging scattering solutions (such as cytosolic cell extracts) anisotropy values were corrected to those of the pure solution - without any fluorescent dye added - by subtracting each of the corresponding fluorescence intensity values at each polarization.
Molecular brightness experiments were performed as previously reported ( Annibale and Lohse, 2020 2. Annibale, P. ∙ Lohse, M.J. Spatial heterogeneity in molecular brightness Nat. Methods. 2020; 17 :273-275 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, movies of 100 frames of individual cells were acquired using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope SP8 (Leica), at a speed of 400 Hz, with an excitation power of 3% at 514 nm, corresponding to a few μW in the sample plane. Detection was performed using photon counting detectors (Leica HyD), in the spectral range 520-600 nm. Molecular brightness values per pixel dwell time were calculated for each pixel, and the average cytosolic value from each individual cell is reported, after converting to photon counts/s. Briefly, molecular brightness is calculated by measuring the variance σ of the photon counts over time for each pixel by the average intensity value k , according to the formula: 𝜎 2 /k. The values of all the pixel within a homogeneous area of the cytosol are then averaged together.
Fluorescence microscopy experiments were performed either on a Leica SP8 Confocal Microscopes, using HyD photon counting detectors and a White Laser light source to achieve excitation at the desired wavelengths (488 nm, and 514 nm). Emission was collected in the 500-600 nm and 520-600 nm range respectively. A 40x 1.3 NA objective was used, and the electronic zoom was set to achieve a pixel size of 50 nm.
We have modeled cAMP reaction/diffusion behavior in the cell, in particular in the vicinity of a PDE, according to the classical treatment original provided by Smoluchowski (1916) 43. Smoluchowski, M.V. Drei Vorträge über Diffusion, Brownsche Bewegung und Koagulation von Kolloidteilchen Physik. Zeit. 1916; 17 :557-571 585–599 Google Scholar ; details in Methods S2 . Here, the catalytic site of the PDE is seen as a sphere of radius R and cAMP as a species diffusing (with a diffusion coefficient D) in its vicinity, assuming that no cAMP sources are close by. The notion that the diffusion is buffered affects the free cAMP concentration [cAMP], and in all our calculations the diffusion coefficient D refers to the free cAMP diffusion rate. This assumption is justified as we are interested in length scales of the order 30 nm, which is well below the average distance between two PDEs at physiological concentrations. Once the cAMP reaches the surfaces of the sphere, a degradation reaction takes place, making the PDE effectively a spherical sink characterized by a flux I of molecules degraded per unit time, in units of mol/s (or nmol/s or μmol/s). The requirement that the total flux of free cAMP toward the PDE at the radius R equals the turnover I ( Rice, 1985 35. Rice, S.A. Diffusion-Limited Reactions. Comprehensive Chemical Kinetics Elsevier, 1985 Google Scholar ), leads to the relation 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝑅 2 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 𝜕 [ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑃 ] 𝜕 𝑟 ∣ 𝑟 = 𝑅 = 𝐼 . (Equation 4) Which allows to solve the appropriate reaction-diffusion equation in spherical coordinates, leading to the following relation for [cAMP] as a function of the distance r from the PDE [ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑃 ] ⁢ ( 𝑟 ) = [ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑃 ] 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑘 − 𝐼 4 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ 𝐷 ⁢ 𝑟 . (Equation 5) The equation can also be written in terms of the radius R 0 where the concentration would be 0, i.e., the radius of a perfect absorber. [ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑃 ] ⁢ ( 𝑟 ) = [ 𝑐 ⁢ 𝐴 ⁢ 𝑀 ⁢ 𝑃 ] 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑘 ⁢ ( 1 − 𝑅 0 𝑟 ) . (Equation 6)
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) and IGOR Pro 7 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, USA). Normal distribution of data points was tested in every dataset using D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test before evaluating significance. When comparing two populations, a Student’s t test was used. When comparing three or more populations, a parametric one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used. The confidence interval was set to 95% (p value = 0.05). Significance was assessed as followed: ns (not significant) ∗ p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001. Data are represented throughout as mean ± error (s.e.m., SD, or 95% confidence intervals), plus – where appropriate – as scatterplots of individual results. More details about statistics, e.g., repetition of experiments and cell numbers, are indicated in the respective figure legends.
