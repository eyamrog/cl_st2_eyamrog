Title: Parasitic modulation of host development by ubiquitin-independent protein degradation


Abstract: Summary

Certain obligate parasites induce complex and substantial phenotypic changes in their hosts in ways that favor their transmission to other trophic levels. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate how SAP05 protein effectors from insect-vectored plant pathogenic phytoplasmas take control of several plant developmental processes. These effectors simultaneously prolong the host lifespan and induce witches’ broom-like proliferations of leaf and sterile shoots, organs colonized by phytoplasmas and vectors. SAP05 acts by mediating the concurrent degradation of SPL and GATA developmental regulators via a process that relies on hijacking the plant ubiquitin receptor RPN10 independent of substrate ubiquitination. RPN10 is highly conserved among eukaryotes, but SAP05 does not bind insect vector RPN10. A two-amino-acid substitution within plant RPN10 generates a functional variant that is resistant to SAP05 activities. Therefore, one effector protein enables obligate parasitic phytoplasmas to induce a plethora of developmental phenotypes in their hosts.

Section: Introduction

Parasites are known to modulate specific processes in hosts to promote colonization and virulence. Most parasites colonize one host, but a substantial number require multiple hosts to complete their life cycle. These parasites often depend on the hosts feeding on each other and, fascinatingly, appear to have evolved mechanisms to induce developmental and behavioral modifications in their hosts that increase the chance of interactions among host trophic levels ( Hughes and Libersat, 2019 33. Hughes, D.P. ∙ Libersat, F. Parasite manipulation of host behavior Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :R45-R47 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Le Fevre et al., 2015 40. Le Fevre, R. ∙ Evangelisti, E. ∙ Rey, T. ... Modulation of host cell biology by plant pathogenic microbes Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2015; 31 :201-229 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae causes severe limb abnormalities in Pacific treefrogs, such as induction of extra limbs or aborting limbs, impairing movement of the frogs and increasing the risk of predation by birds, which are the definitive hosts of the trematode parasite ( Johnson et al., 1999 38.

The effect of trematode infection on amphibian limb development and survivorship Science. 1999; 284 :802-804 Crossref Scopus (311) PubMed Google Scholar ). These parasites are spectacular examples of how the reach of genes can extend beyond an organism to affect the surrounding environment, a phenomenon known as the extended phenotype ( Dawkins, 1982 14. Dawkins, R. The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene Oxford University Press, 1982 Google Scholar ). However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning these parasite-enforced host modifications are largely unknown, and there are ongoing debates about the extent to which these phenotypes are adaptive ( Herbison et al., 2018 27.

One group of plant pathogens notorious for reprogramming host development consists of members of Candidatus (Ca.) Phytoplasma ( Doi et al., 1967 18. Doi, Y. ∙ Teranaka, M. ∙ Yora, K. ...

EPPO EPPO Global Database 2021 https://gd.eppo.int Google Scholar ). Phytoplasmas infect most vascular plant species and often induce massive changes in plant architecture, such as excessive proliferation of shoots and branches (witches’ broom) and retrograde development of flowers into leaf-like organs (phyllody) ( Hoshi et al., 2009 30.

Notably, phytoplasmas are strict obligates that have a dual host cycle that alternates between plants (kingdom Plantae) and insects (kingdom Animalia) ( Hogenhout et al., 2008 29. Hogenhout, S.A. ∙ Oshima, K. ∙ Ammar, D. ... Phytoplasmas: bacteria that manipulate plants and insects Mol. Plant Pathol. 2008; 9 :403-423 Crossref Scopus (473) PubMed Google Scholar ). In plants, phytoplasmas colonize the cytoplasm of vascular phloem sieve cells that transport nutrients to growing plant tissues and spread systemically in plants via migration through the phloem cell sieve pores ( Musetti et al., 2013 50. Musetti, R. ∙ Buxa, S.V. ∙ De Marco, F. ... Phytoplasma-triggered Ca(2+) influx is involved in sieve-tube blockage Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2013; 26 :379-386 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Sap-feeding insects that feed from the phloem, predominantly leafhoppers, planthoppers, and psyllids of the order Hemiptera, are often efficient phytoplasma vectors ( Weintraub and Beanland, 2006 73. Weintraub, P.G. ∙ Beanland, L. Insect vectors of phytoplasmas Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2006; 51 :91-111 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phytoplasma-infected plants have been referred to as “zombie plants” because they exhibit extensive architectural changes, stop reproducing, and appear to serve solely as habitats for the phytoplasma pathogens and their insect vectors ( Du Toit, 2014 20.

Phytoplasmas can be deleterious to their plant hosts, but they often have neutral or beneficial effects on their insect vectors, especially in established pathosystems where the bacteria and insects have co-evolved over long periods of time ( Beanland et al., 2000 6.

The three-way interactions among phytoplasmas, plants, and insects are an excellent system to study the genetic basis of extended phenotypes created by obligate multi-host parasites ( Huang et al., 2020 31.

Progress in the characterization of phytoplasma virulence factors is greatly accelerated by the ability of some phytoplasmas to colonize the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . One of these phytoplasmas is Aster Yellows phytoplasma (AYP) strain Witches’ Broom (AY-WB; Ca . Phytoplasma asteris ) ( Hogenhout et al., 2008 29. Hogenhout, S.A. ∙ Oshima, K. ∙ Ammar, D. ...

Molecular and symptom analyses of phytoplasma strains from lettuce reveal a diverse population Phytopathology. 2004; 94 :842-849 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). The main vector of AYPs in North America is the polyphagous aster leafhopper Macrosteles quadrilineatus , which migrates over long distances and transmits the bacteria to various crops, including oilseed rape, carrots, and several cereals ( CABI, 2021 9.

AYPs induce witches’ broom and phyllody symptoms and their occurrence can be high, sometimes contributing to loss of entire crop productions ( Frost et al., 2013a 24.

Entomol. 2013; 42 :477-490 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phytoplasmas cause these symptoms by secreting proteins, known as effectors, that are unloaded from the phloem to adjacent plant tissues, such as shoot and apical meristems ( Arashida et al., 2008 2.

Phytoplasma effector SAP54 induces indeterminate leaf-like flower development in Arabidopsis plants Plant Physiol. 2011; 157 :831-841 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mining of the AY-WB genome for potential effectors resulted in identification of 56 candidate effector genes, called secreted AY-WB proteins (SAPs) ( Bai et al., 2009 5.

Plant Microbe Interact. 2009; 22 :18-30 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). To date, only a few of these have been characterized. Among them, SAP11 binds and destabilizes A. thaliana TCP transcription factors, resulting in leaf shape changes and stem proliferation ( Bai et al., 2009 5. Bai, X. ∙ Correa, V.R. ∙ Toruño, T.Y. ...

The small phytoplasma virulence effector SAP11 contains distinct domains required for nuclear targeting and CIN-TCP binding and destabilization. New Phytol. 2014; 202 :838-848 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). SAP54 binds and degrades A. thaliana MADS box transcription factors by co-opting proteasome RAD23 shuttle factors, leading to development of leafy flowers ( MacLean et al., 2011 44.

Homologs of these effectors have been found in divergent phytoplasmas and shown to degrade TCPs and MADS box transcription factors of other plant species ( Chang et al., 2018 11.

However, the phenotypes caused by SAP11, SAP54, and their homologs do not account for all of the extensive developmental phenotypes caused by phytoplasmas, such as prolonged lifespan and witches’ broom-type tissue proliferation other than stems.
Here we discovered that a phytoplasma effector, SAP05, binds and mediates degradation of multiple members of two distinct transcription factor families, the SPL family and the GATA family, leading to delayed plant aging and simultaneous proliferation of vegetative tissue and shoots. SAP05 mediates degradation through a ubiquitination-independent mechanism by co-opting the 26S ubiquitin receptor RPN10, which is highly conserved across eukaryotes. Remarkably, SAP05 does not bind the RPN10 of phytoplasma insect vectors, and only two RPN10 amino acids define binding specificity. We used this information to engineer a functional variant of plant RPN10 that mimics the insect RPN10 sequence. This mimic has lower affinity for SAP05 and confers plant resistance to SAP05 activity during phytoplasma infection. This work shows that one single phytoplasma effector co-opts one host proteasome protein to degrade multiple developmental regulators, inducing a plethora of adaptive phenotypic changes in their plant hosts.

Section: Results

As part of functional screens with candidate AY-WB phytoplasma effectors, we found that SAP05 perturbs plant developmental processes by analyzing phenotypes of stable transgenic A. thaliana (At) lines that constitutively express the SAP05 gene (without signal peptide) under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. These SAP05 -expressing plants exhibited a range of architectural differences compared with control plants that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the same promoter ( Figure 1 ; Figure S1 ). During vegetative growth, SAP05 plants displayed accelerated leaf initiations and produced more rosette leaves ( Figures 1 A and 1E; Figures S1 A and S1C). In addition, the leaves of mature rosettes lacked serrated edges that are present in control plants ( Figure 1 A; Figure S1 A). A closer examination revealed that the appearance of abaxial trichomes, which is characteristic of adult leaves, was also delayed in SAP05 plants ( Figure 1 E; Figure S1 C). However, SAP05 plants initiated budding and flowering no later than the control plants under short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions ( Figure 1 F; Figure S1 D). SAP05 plants produced more lateral shoots and secondary branches, and these plants were reduced in height ( Figures 1 C, 1D, 1G, and 1H). At 12 weeks under LD conditions, GFP plants started to senesce, whereas SAP05 plants continued to grow ( Figure 1 D), suggesting that SAP05 delays plant senescence. Twenty-six of 32 independently transformed p35S::SAP05 lines developed abnormal flowers and had greatly compromised fertility ( Figure 1 C, inset), with extremely bushy plants showing complete sterility ( Figure S1 E).
Because phytoplasmas secrete effector proteins into phloem cells, we generated stable transgenic A. thaliana lines expressing SAP05 from the phloem-specific AtSUC2 promoter ( Mathieu et al., 2007 49. Mathieu, J. ∙ Warthmann, N. ∙ Küttner, F. ... Export of FT protein from phloem companion cells is sufficient for floral induction in Arabidopsis Curr. Biol. 2007; 17 :1055-1060 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (488) PubMed Google Scholar ). pAtSUC2::SAP05 plants exhibited similar architectural changes as p35S::SAP05 plants, such as stunting, bushiness, and sterility ( Figure 1 I), phenotypes that resemble the witches’ broom symptoms typically observed in phytoplasma-infected plants.
To identify potential SAP05 targets in plants, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen against an A. thaliana seedling cDNA library. SAP05 interacted with several A. thaliana zinc-finger transcription factors (TFs), specifically multiple GATA and SPL TFs, which are key regulators of developmental transitions in plants ( Figures 2 A–2C; Table S1 ; Ranftl et al., 2016 56.

Developmental Functions of miR156-Regulated SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1006263 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then screened SAP05 against a TF library representing over 78.5% of described A. thaliana TFs ( Pruneda-Paz et al., 2014 55. Pruneda-Paz, J.L. ∙ Breton, G. ∙ Nagel, D.H. ... A genome-scale resource for the functional characterization of Arabidopsis transcription factors Cell Rep. 2014; 8 :622-632 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of 1,957 TFs, 22 genes were identified as potential SAP05 interactors ( Table S2 ), and these included 6 SPLs and 7 GATAs. Further Y2H assays focused on these families revealed a total of 26 GATAs and 12 SPLs from A. thaliana that interact with SAP05 ( Table S3 ). GFP-SAP05 also pulled down SPL5, SPL9, and GATA18 from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves ( Figures S2 A–S2C), indicating that SAP05 interacts with SPL and GATA TFs in planta . Further, the zinc-finger (ZnF) domains of SPLs and GATAs are sufficient to mediate SAP05 binding in Y2H experiments ( Figure 2 C).
We also identified the A. thaliana 26S proteasome subunit RPN10 as a potential SAP05 interactor in the Y2H screen ( Figure 2 D; Table S1 ). RPN10 locates within the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome and serves as one of the main ubiquitin receptors recruiting ubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation ( Fu et al., 1998 26. Fu, H. ∙ Sadis, S. ∙ Rubin, D.M. ... Multiubiquitin chain binding and protein degradation are mediated by distinct domains within the 26 S proteasome subunit Mcb1 J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :1970-1981 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; van Nocker et al., 1996 70. van Nocker, S. ∙ Sadis, S. ∙ Rubin, D.M. ... The multiubiquitin-chain-binding protein Mcb1 is a component of the 26S proteasome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and plays a nonessential, substrate-specific role in protein turnover Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16 :6020-6028 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ). RPN10 is composed of two main domains: A N-terminal vWA (von Willebrand factor type A) domain required for proteasome association and a C-terminal half with ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) involved in recruiting ubiquitinated substrates. We found that SAP05 interacts with the vWA domain but not the UIM domain of AtRPN10 ( Figure 2 D).
Given that SAP05 interacts with the 26S proteasome subunit RPN10, we investigated whether SAP05 degrades GATA and SPL TFs in plant cells. GFP-SAP05 and AtRPN10-RFP (red fluorescent protein) were detected in the cytoplasm and nuclei and RFP-tagged SPL or GATA proteins in nuclei of plant cells ( Figures S2 D–S2G), indicating that SAP05, SPL, GATA, and RPN10 locate to the same subcellular locations of plant cells and may interact with each other. Upon transient co-expression of GATA or SPL genes and SAP05 (or GFP as a control) under control of the constitutive 35S promoter in A. thaliana protoplasts, GATA proteins and SPL proteins were absent or less abundant in the presence of SAP05 compared with GFP ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, the presence of SAP05 did not reduce the abundance of many other proteins, including 6 randomly selected ZnF TFs, two ribosomal proteins that were identified as potential SAP05 interactors in the A. thaliana seedling Y2H screen, three TCP TFs that were identified in the A. thaliana TF library Y2H screen, and the TF ABI5, which is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) via interaction with RPN10 ( Smalle et al., 2003 64. Smalle, J. ∙ Kurepa, J. ∙ Yang, P. ... The pleiotropic role of the 26S proteasome subunit RPN10 in Arabidopsis growth and development supports a substrate-specific function in abscisic acid signaling Plant Cell. 2003; 15 :965-980 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S2 H). Using transient expression assays, we also found SAP05-mediated decrease of GATA and SPL protein levels in whole Nicotiana benthamiana leaves ( Figure S2 I). These data show that SAP05 mediates destabilization of SPL and GATA TFs in plant cells.
To investigate the role of AtRPN10 in SAP05-mediated destabilization of plant TFs, we made use of the existing and well-described A. thaliana loss-of-function rpn10 mutant line rpn10-2 ( Lin et al., 2011 42.

In protoplasts generated from rpn10-2 plants, SAP05 no longer degraded GATA18/HAN or SPL5, but when AtRPN10 was reintroduced into the protoplasts, these TFs were degraded in the presence of SAP05 ( Figure 2 F). Therefore, AtRPN10 is required for the SAP05-mediated degradation of plant targets.
To investigate whether SPLs are degraded during phytoplasma infection, we made use of lines that express miR156-resistant forms of SPL11 and SPL13 (r SPL11 and r SPl13 , respectively) fused translationally fused with a β-glucuronidase protein (GUS) under control of their native promoters ( Xu et al., 2016 74. Xu, M. ∙ Hu, T. ∙ Zhao, J. ... Developmental Functions of miR156-Regulated SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1006263 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). In line with previous findings, rSPL11::GUS and rSPL13::GUS were expressed in young leaves but not in fully expanded leaves. Newly emerged and developing leaves of phytoplasma-infected plants had visibly reduced GUS staining compared with those of uninfected plants ( Figures 2 G and 2H), whereas the expression levels of these two genes in those leaves did not differ between healthy and diseased plants ( Figures S2 J and S2K). These data further support the theory that SPL proteins are destabilized during phytoplasma infection.
Next we investigated how SAP05 interaction with AtRPN10 leads to degradation of SPLs and GATAs. AtRPN10 is known to be involved in the UPS and autophagy, the two major pathways for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells ( Ji and Kwon, 2017 36. Ji, C.H. ∙ Kwon, Y.T. Crosstalk and Interplay between the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System and Autophagy Mol. Cells. 2017; 40 :441-449 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marshall et al., 2015 48. Marshall, R.S. ∙ Li, F. ∙ Gemperline, D.C. ... Autophagic Degradation of the 26S Proteasome Is Mediated by the Dual ATG8/Ubiquitin Receptor RPN10 in Arabidopsis Mol. Cell. 2015; 58 :1053-1066 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we wished to investigate the effect of UPS and autophagy in SAP05-mediated degradation of targets. Addition of MG132 and bortezomib, two potent proteasome inhibitors, inhibited SAP05-mediated destabilization of representative GATA and SPL proteins tested ( Figures 3 A and 3B). In contrast, two autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine and E-64d, did not interfere with SAP05-mediated degradation ( Figures 3 A and 3B). These results suggest that GATA and SPL proteins are targeted for destabilization by SAP05 in the host 26S proteasome.
SAP05 also mediates degradation of SPL or GATA ZnF domains alone ( Figure 3 F, right panel), suggesting that direct interactions of SAP05 with these domains are required for substrate degradation initiation. Indeed, SAP05 fused to a GFP nanobody ( Rothbauer et al., 2006 60. Rothbauer, U. ∙ Zolghadr, K. ∙ Tillib, S. ... Targeting and tracing antigens in live cells with fluorescent nanobodies Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 :887-889 Crossref Scopus (528) PubMed Google Scholar ), a single-chain antibody domain that specifically recognizes GFP, also degraded GFP in A. thaliana protoplasts ( Figures S3 A and S3B). To further investigate whether SAP05 directly binds its plant targets, recombinant proteins or specific domains were expressed in Escherichia coli for detecting protein-protein interactions. First, the interaction between SAP05 and the ZnF domain of AtSPL5 was confirmed in gel filtration assays. The two proteins co-eluted in gel filtration with an elution profile distinct from those of the two proteins alone ( Figure 3 C), suggesting stable in vitro complex formation. Moreover, a SUMO-tagged vWA domain was co-purified with His-tagged SAP05 from E. coli using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) for affinity purification of His-tagged fusion proteins ( Figure 3 D). In contrast, a mutated vWA domain (38GA39 > HS [evWA]) that does not interact with SAP05 in Y2H assays (further discussed below; Figure 5 B), was less enriched during co-purification ( Figure 3 D). Therefore, SAP05 also binds to the vWA domain in vitro . Finally, the His-SUMO-tagged vWA domain pulled down the ZnF domain of AtSPL5 in the presence of SAP05 but not in the absence of this effector, and the evWA domain pulled down less SAP05 and did not pull down the ZnF domain in the presence of SAP05 ( Figure 3 E). Therefore, SAP05 forms a bridge between the AtSPL5 ZnF and AtRPN10 vWA to generate a ternary complex.
Given that RPN10 functions as one of the main ubiquitin receptors by recruiting poly-ubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation ( Fu et al., 1998 26. Fu, H. ∙ Sadis, S. ∙ Rubin, D.M. ... Multiubiquitin chain binding and protein degradation are mediated by distinct domains within the 26 S proteasome subunit Mcb1 J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 :1970-1981 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lin et al., 2011 42. Lin, Y.L. ∙ Sung, S.C. ∙ Tsai, H.L. ... The defective proteasome but not substrate recognition function is responsible for the null phenotypes of the Arabidopsis proteasome subunit RPN10 Plant Cell. 2011; 23 :2754-2773 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), we investigated whether ubiquitination of lysine residues within SAP05 targets is necessary for their degradation. AtGATA18 and AtGATA19 proteins in which all lysines were replaced by arginines were more abundant than wild-type proteins in transient expression assays ( Figure 3 F, left panel), in agreement with GATAs being short-lived proteins subjected constitutively to degradation by the UPS ( Behringer et al., 2014 7. Behringer, C. ∙ Bastakis, E. ∙ Ranftl, Q.L. ... Functional diversification within the family of B-GATA transcription factors through the leucine-leucine-methionine domain Plant Physiol. 2014; 166 :293-305 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nonetheless, both GATA mutants were degraded in the presence of SAP05 ( Figure 3 F, left panel). Therefore, lysine ubiquitination of substrates may not be required for SAP05-mediated degradation. In support of this idea, co-expression of the dominant-negative ubiquitin Ub-ΔGG, which prevents the ubiquitin chain from conjugating to other proteins ( AYu et al., 1997 4. AYu, A. ∙ Swaminathan, S. ∙ Krantz, B.A. ... In vivo disassembly of free polyubiquitin chains by yeast Ubp14 modulates rates of protein degradation by the proteasome EMBO J. 1997; 16 :4826-4838 Crossref Scopus (199) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased GATA19 and SPL5 protein levels, but both proteins were still degraded in the presence of SAP05 ( Figure 3 G). In contrast, the protein level of ABI5, which does not interact with SAP05 but is subjected to RPN10-dependent degradation, was increased significantly by UbΔGG overexpression and did not reduce in the presence of SAP05 ( Figure 3 G). These data indicate that SAP05-mediated target degradation occurs independent of substrate ubiquitination. To directly test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro degradation assay with purified human 26S proteasomes. Addition of SAP05 and His-SPL5 did not result in degradation of the latter ( Figure 3 H, top right panel). However, when the purified AtRPN10 vWA domain was also added to the assay, His-SPL5 was degraded in the presence of SAP05 ( Figure 3 H, bottom left panel). Moreover, MG132 inhibited His-SPL5 degradation in the presence of SAP05 and AtRPN10 vWA ( Figure 3 H, bottom right panel). These results suggest that SAP05 and the A. thaliana vWA domain are required for His-SPL5 degradation in the human 26S proteasome. These data are in agreement with our finding that SAP05 links AtSPL5 and AtRPN10 vWA to form a ternary complex ( Figure 3 E). Because the purified recombinant human 26S proteasomes lack ubiquitin conjugation enzymes, SAP05 apparently initiates degradation of SAP05 interactors in the 26S proteasome without the need for substrate ubiquitination. These results indicate that SAP05 mediates SPL/GATA degradation in a ubiquitination-independent manner by hijacking the plant host 26S proteasome component RPN10 ( Figure 3 I).
We identified one or two SAP05 homologs in 17 phytoplasmas from 7 of 10 16S rDNA (16Sr) clades ( Figure 4 A). Most of these homologs interacted with SPLs and GATAs ( Figure 4 B). However, for witches’ broom disease of lime (WBDL) phytoplasma and peanut witches’ broom (PnWB) phytoplasmas, which have two SAP05 genes, one SAP05 interacted only with SPLs and the other only with GATAs. In contrast, SAP05 of Ca . Phytoplasma mali (AT) only interacted with SPLs. Consistent with these binding specificities in yeast, the SAP05 homologs degraded one or both representative members of the SPL and GATA families in protoplast destabilization assays ( Figure 4 C). Phylogenetic analyses of the SAP05 effectors revealed distinct subclades of SAP05 homologs that bind and degrade both TFs or only SPLs or GATAs ( Figure 4 D). These data indicate that some SAP05 homologs have evolved to differentially interact and degrade plant SPL and GATA TFs.
SPLs regulate plant developmental phase transitions, and most are regulated developmentally by microRNA156 (miR156) ( Xu et al., 2016 74. Xu, M. ∙ Hu, T. ∙ Zhao, J. ...

Stable transgenic A. thaliana plants that constitutively express genes of the SPL-interacting SAP05 WBLDa or SAP05 PnWBa phenotypically resembled miR156 overexpression plants or a high-order spl mutant ( spl9 spl11 spl13 spl15 ) ( Figures 4 E–4H), including production of more juvenile leaves ( Figure 4 F) and delayed flowering ( Figure 4 G), unlike MIM156 plants, in which miR156 activity is reduced via target mimicry ( Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007 23.

Genet. 2007; 39 :1033-1037 Crossref Scopus (1644) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, transgenic plants expressing GATA-interacting SAP05 WBLDb or SAP05 PnWBb did not show much difference in production of juvenile leaves compared with wild-type plants. A quadruple gata mutant, gnc gnl gata17 gata17l , or the overexpression of a GATA member, GNC , which significantly impair plant greening and growth ( Ranftl et al., 2016 56.

However, phenotypes of SAP05 WBLDb and SAP05 PnWBb plants resembled those of well-characterized gata mutants regarding early flowering ( Figures 4 E and 4G; Ranftl et al., 2016 56.

Ranftl, Q.L. ∙ Bastakis, E. ∙ Klermund, C. ... LLM-Domain Containing B-GATA Factors Control Different Aspects of Cytokinin-Regulated Development in Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Physiol. 2016; 170 :2295-2311 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), and narrower rosette leaves with smooth margins ( Figure S4 A; Ding et al., 2015 17. Ding, L. ∙ Yan, S. ∙ Jiang, L. ... HANABA TARANU regulates the shoot apical meristem and leaf development in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) J. Exp. Bot. 2015; 66 :7075-7087 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ). Noticeably, SAP05 homologs that bind either SPLs or GATAs did not induce the full witches’ broom-like phenotypes that were observed in plants expressing the SAP05 homologs that bind both SPL and GATA TFs. This suggests that the concurrent destabilization of SPLs and GATAs by SAP05 decouples normal plant juvenile-to-adult and vegetative-to-reproductive developmental transitions, generating plants that retain juvenile characteristics and nonetheless bolt to produce flowering shoots that remain sterile. Therefore, the combination of SAP05-mediated SPL and GATA degradation leads to induction of the witches’ broom phenotype.
Animals encode GATA TFs and RPN10 proteins but lack SPLs. To investigate whether SAP05 also interacts with GATA proteins of the leafhopper vector, we mined the transcriptome assembly of M. quadrilineatus ( Drurey et al., 2019 19. Drurey, C. ∙ Mathers, T.C. ∙ Prince, D.C. ... Chemosensory proteins in the CSP4 clade evolved as plant immunity suppressors before two suborders of plant-feeding hemipteran insects diverged bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) for GATA TFs and identified six distinct transcripts with typical GATA ZnF domains ( Figure S5 A). None of these insect ZnF domains interacted with SAP05 in Y2H assays ( Figure S5 B).
We also identified a M. quadrilineatus RPN10 homolog (MqRPN10) that is highly similar in sequence to A. thaliana RPN10 (AtRPN10) ( Figure 5 A; Figures S5 C and S5D). SAP05 of AY-WB did not interact with MqRPN10 in Y2H assays, nor with the MqRPN10 vWA domain or a hybrid RPN10 (hRPN10) consisting of the M. quadrilineatus vWA domain and the A. thaliana C-terminal (UIM) domain ( Figure 5 B). Comparison of multiple vWA domains of plant and animal RPN10 homologs revealed differences between the two groups in two regions corresponding to amino acids 38–39 (GA versus HS) and 56–58 (GKG versus K–) in the A. thaliana vWA domain ( Figure 5 A). Altering these residues within A. thaliana RPN10 to those present in the M. quadrilineatus homolog to create RPN10_38GA39 > HS (m1) and RPN10_56GKG58 > K (m2) resulted in loss of SAP05 binding in Y2H assays ( Figure 5 B). The RPN10 variants interacted with the A. thaliana RADIATION SENSITIVE23 (RAD23B) protein, a ubiquitin shuttle factor that binds RPN10 UIM domains ( Farmer et al., 2010 22. Farmer, L.M. ∙ Book, A.J. ∙ Lee, K.H. ... The RAD23 family provides an essential connection between the 26S proteasome and ubiquitylated proteins in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :124-142 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that the RPN10 variants are functional in Y2H assays. In addition, SAP05 degradation assays of AtGATA18 and AtSPL5 in A. thaliana rpn10-2 protoplasts showed that these SAP05 targets were less degraded in the presence of AtRPN10 m1 compared with AtRPN10 or AtRPN10 m2 ( Figure 5 C), indicating that the 38GA39 residues mediate SAP05 binding and activities. This result is in agreement with our finding that SAP05-mediated degradation of His-SPL5 by the human 26S proteasome occurred only in the presence of the AtRPN10 vWA domain ( Figure 3 H) because SAP05 is unlikely to interact with PSMD4, the human RPN10 homolog, because of the 38HS39 residues in its vWA domain. In addition, plant SUMO-tagged RPN10 vWA domains that carried the 38GA39 > HS mutations (SUMO-evWA) had lower affinity for SAP05 in E. coli lysates compared with the wild-type RPN10 vWA domain ( Figure 3 D), and the His-SUMO-tagged evWA domain did not pull down ZnF domain of AtSPL5 in the presence of SAP05 but His-SUMO-tagged vWA did ( Figure 3 E). Therefore, 38GA39 mediate direct binding of SAP05 of AtRPN10 in vitro and in vivo.
Next, we considered the possibility of engineering plant RPN10 as a way to block SAP05 activities. Even though rpn10 null mutants have severe growth defects ( Lin et al., 2011 42. Lin, Y.L. ∙ Sung, S.C. ∙ Tsai, H.L. ... The defective proteasome but not substrate recognition function is responsible for the null phenotypes of the Arabidopsis proteasome subunit RPN10 Plant Cell. 2011; 23 :2754-2773 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smalle et al., 2003 64. Smalle, J. ∙ Kurepa, J. ∙ Yang, P. ... The pleiotropic role of the 26S proteasome subunit RPN10 in Arabidopsis growth and development supports a substrate-specific function in abscisic acid signaling Plant Cell. 2003; 15 :965-980 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ), the SAP05 non-interacting allele AtRPN10 m1 (called eRPN10 for engineered RPN10) largely rescued the developmental defects of the rpn10-2 plants and were similar in habit to cRPN10 plants (complementation RPN10 carrying wild-type AtRPN10 ) ( Figures S4 B–S4E). Transformation of the p35S::SAP05 construct in the eRPN10 background generated wild-type-looking plants without obvious developmental phenotypes in contrast to that in cRPN10 plants ( Figures 5 D and 5E). Therefore, the RPN10_38GA39 > HS mutation confers resistance to phytoplasma-SAP05-mediated developmental changes in A. thaliana .
To investigate the contribution of SAP05 to symptom development because of AY-WB phytoplasma infection in A. thaliana , we infected wild-type, cRPN10, and eRPN10 plants with AY-WB phytoplasma. The infected wild-type and cRPN10 plants produced more small, deformed leaves and more lateral shoots compared with plants of similar age not infected with phytoplasma ( Figures 5 F–5J; Figure S4 F). The symptoms of these infected plants resembled the phenotypes of p35S::SAP05 ( Figures 1 A–1C) and cRPN10 p35S::SAP05 plants ( Figure 5 D). In contrast, eRPN10 plants infected with phytoplasma did not produce severely deformed leaves nor an increased number of lateral shoots compared with non-infected plants ( Figures 5 F–5J; Figure S4 F). Moreover, the leaves of infected eRPN10 A. thaliana plants showed enhanced reddening compared with wild-type or cRPN10 plants ( Figure 5 F; Figure S4 F), indicating that SAP05 actions may reduce plant stress-induced senescence during phytoplasma infection. Indeed, AY-WB-infected eRPN10 plants died earlier compared with cRPN10 and wild-type plants ( Figure 5 H). All AY-WB-infected A. thaliana genotypes produced leaf-like flowers ( Figure S4 G) that resemble the phyllody symptoms of AY-WB-infected plants, indicating that the engineered RPN10 allele does not interfere with the leaf-like flower phenotype induced by another AY-WB phytoplasma effector, SAP54. These data demonstrate that the AY-WB SAP05 effector is largely responsible for the shoot proliferation/witches’-broom-like symptoms during AY-WB infection of A. thaliana and that blocking SAP05 activities reduces host tolerance toward this phloem-inhabiting, insect-vectored bacterial pathogen.

Section: Discussion

This work shows that SAP05 effector co-opts the plant 26S proteasome ubiquitin receptor RPN10 to mediate degradation of SPL and GATA—two distinct classes of plant TFs—through a ubiquitination-independent process ( Figure 6 A). SPL TFs have a conserved role in controlling developmental phase transitions of vascular plants ( Huijser and Schmid, 2011 34. Huijser, P. ∙ Schmid, M.

Transcription repressor HANABA TARANU controls flower development by integrating the actions of multiple hormones, floral organ specification genes, and GATA3 family genes in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2013; 25 :83-101 Crossref Scopus (113) PubMed Google Scholar ). SAP05 binding and the degradation spectrum against SPLs or GATAs and the phenotypes of plants expressing SAP05 homologs are consistent with known functions of SPLs and GATAs ( Figures 4 D–4H). For example, SAP05, which simultaneously degrades SPLs and GATAs, decouples plant developmental phase transitions and causes delayed plant aging, witches’ broom-like excessive vegetative tissue, and sterile adult shoot production ( Figures 4 D–4H and 6 B). Our model describes a mechanistic framework for how obligate parasites can induce complex and substantial phenotypic changes in their hosts in ways that favor their transmission to other trophic levels.
SAP05-induced decoupling of host developmental transitions likely promotes plant developmental traits that facilitate survival and spread of this “zombie plant” pathogen. Phytoplasmas are restricted to the phloem. These bacteria may benefit from SAP05-induced phenotypes by increasing the numbers of leaves and adult shoots to generate more vascular tissue the phytoplasmas can colonize. In support of this notion, engineered RPN10 plants that are resistant to SAP05 activities do not produce more vegetative tissue and die earlier during phytoplasma infection ( Figures 5 F–5J). Moreover, although flower structures are formed, they remain sterile. So photosynthates transported within the phloem are not being used for flowering and seed production and may instead be consumed by the phytoplasmas, which are known to accumulate in plant sink tissues. Enrichment of nutrients is likely important because phytoplasmas lack essential metabolic pathways and depend on import of a diverse range of metabolites, including sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, and ions, mostly via ABC transporters ( Bai et al., 2006 3. Bai, X. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Ewing, A. ... Living with genome instability: the adaptation of phytoplasmas to diverse environments of their insect and plant hosts J.

Reductive evolution suggested from the complete genome sequence of a plant-pathogenic phytoplasma Nat. Genet. 2004; 36 :27-29 Crossref Scopus (402) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, a delay in plant senescence and death increases the likelihood of plants being visited and colonized by phytoplasma insect vectors, promoting the number of insects that can transmit the phytoplasmas. This effect may be intensified by insect vectors being more attracted to symptomatic phytoplasma-infected plants and the activities of SAP11 and SAP54 effectors that enhance insect attraction and colonization ( Al-Subhi et al., 2020 1.

Our finding that SAP05 does not bind RPN10 of the leafhopper vector led to a strategy for engineering plants to be insensitive to SAP05 activities. The SAP05-binding specificity to RPN10 can be dependent on just two amino acids that, fascinatingly, are one of the only few sequence differences between plant and human/animal RPN10 vWA domains ( Figure 5 A). eRPN10 plants carrying AtRPN10 GA > HS are more resistant to SAP05 activity during phytoplasma infection. Hence, introduction of single-nucleotide changes in RPN10 genes (for example, by CRISPR-Cas technologies; Chen et al., 2019 12. Chen, K. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Zhang, R. ...

Plant Biol. 2019; 70 :667-697 Crossref Scopus (911) PubMed Google Scholar ) is a promising strategy to achieve durable resistance of crops to phytoplasmas.
SAP05 bridges TFs and a conserved proteasome component through a biochemical mechanism that results in target degradation without ubiquitination. Some human proteins, such as FAT10 (HLA-F locus adjacent transcript 10) and its co-factor NUB1L (NEDD8 ultimate buster-1 long) ( Rani et al., 2012 57. Rani, N. ∙ Aichem, A. ∙ Schmidtke, G. ... FAT10 and NUB1L bind to the VWA domain of Rpn10 and Rpn1 to enable proteasome-mediated proteolysis Nat. Commun. 2012; 3 :749 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ), are known to bind the vWA domain. Unlike SAP05, FAT10 shares sequence similarity with ubiquitin ( Schmidtke et al., 2014 63. Schmidtke, G. ∙ Aichem, A. ∙ Groettrup, M. FAT10ylation as a signal for proteasomal degradation Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843 :97-102 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar ). The FAT10/NUB1L pathway also requires E1/E2/E3 ligases and the presence of lysine residues on the substrate targeted for degradation ( Rani et al., 2012 57. Rani, N. ∙ Aichem, A. ∙ Schmidtke, G. ... FAT10 and NUB1L bind to the VWA domain of Rpn10 and Rpn1 to enable proteasome-mediated proteolysis Nat. Commun. 2012; 3 :749 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike SAP05 ( Figure 3 H; Figures S3 C and S3D), FAT10 is degraded along with its substrate ( Hipp et al., 2005 28. Hipp, M.S. ∙ Kalveram, B. ∙ Raasi, S. ... FAT10, a ubiquitin-independent signal for proteasomal degradation Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25 :3483-3491 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar .) Therefore, the mode of action of SAP05 is different from that of FAT10/NUB1L despite both binding the RPN10 vWA domain. This distinct mode of action of SAP05 has potential practical applications given that targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a promising approach for drug discovery ( Chamberlain and Hamann, 2019 10. Chamberlain, P.P. ∙ Hamann, L.G. Development of targeted protein degradation therapeutics Nat. Chem. Biol. 2019; 15 :937-944 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phytoplasma SAP05 effectors may be used as alternatives to other TPD systems, such as proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), which uses small-molecule ligands to create complexes between E3 ligases and targets ( Schapira et al., 2019 62. Schapira, M. ∙ Calabrese, M.F. ∙ Bullock, A.N. ... Targeted protein degradation: expanding the toolbox Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2019; 18 :949-963 Crossref Scopus (483) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phytoplasma SAP05 effectors may enable a more direct TPD technology that is independent of E3 ligases.
In contrast to most pathogens effectors that target immune responses of their hosts, this and previous studies show that phytoplasma effectors have converged onto modulating key plant developmental regulators. Our finding that SAP05 effectors mediate degradation of SPLs and GATAs that control precise developmental stage transitions enables phytoplasmas to take control of their plant host and corroborates the view that the developmental changes enforced by multi-host obligate phytoplasma parasites are adaptive.

Section: Limitations of the study

This study used the model plant A. thaliana . With advancement of CRISPR-mediated gene targeting tools that enable DNA substitutions, it may soon be possible to introduce GA > HS mutations in RPN10 of multiple crops afflicted by phytoplasma infection. Although the phytoplasma-infected A. thaliana RPN10 GA > HS mutants were more resistant to actions of SAP05, other symptoms, including phyllody induced by the AY-WB SAP54 effector, were still observed.

A. thaliana Columbia-0 ecotype ( Col-0 ) plants were grown in the greenhouse under either long-day (16 h light/8 h dark) or short-day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark) at 22°C. Plant age was determined from the date seeds were transferred to growth chambers after stratification. Juvenile leaves refer to rosette leaves that only produce trichomes on their adaxial side. Rosette leaves that have trichomes on both side of leaves (adaxial and abaxial) were recorded as adult leaves. Bolting time was recorded when the main inflorescence reached a height of 0.5 cm. Transgenic plants were generated as previously described ( MacLean et al., 2011 44. MacLean, A.M. ∙ Sugio, A. ∙ Makarova, O.V. ... Phytoplasma effector SAP54 induces indeterminate leaf-like flower development in Arabidopsis plants Plant Physiol. 2011; 157 :831-841 Crossref Scopus (201) PubMed Google Scholar ). For generating p35S::SAP05 or pAtSUC2::SAP05 plants, codon-optimized SAP05 coding sequences (without the secretory signal peptide) were used. SAP05 sequences used for generating transgenic plants were listed in Table S4 .
M. quadrilineatus colonies carrying the AY-WB phytoplasma ( Sugio et al., 2011b 67. Sugio, A. ∙ MacLean, A.M. ∙ Kingdom, H.N. ... Diverse targets of phytoplasma effectors: from plant development to defense against insects Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2011; 49 :175-195 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ) were reared on infected lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ) and China aster ( Callistephus chinensis Nees) under long-day conditions at 24°C.
The initial Y2H screen of SAP05 against an A. thaliana seedling library was performed by Hybrigenics Services SAS (Paris, France). The coding sequence of SAP05 without the secretory signal peptide was cloned into a pB27 bait plasmid as a C-terminal fusion to the LexA domain ( Table S1 ). The prey library was constructed from an A. thaliana seedling cDNA library, with pP6 as the prey plasmid. A total 65.2 million clones were screened. In a second yeast two-hybrid screen ( Table S2 ), the same SAP05 sequence was cloned into the pDEST32 plasmid and screened against an A. thaliana transcription factor library (pDEST22-TF), as previously described ( de Folter and Immink, 2011 15. de Folter, S. ∙ Immink, R.G. Yeast protein-protein interaction assays and screens Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 754 :145-165 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). The identified interactions were further confirmed using the Matchmaker Gold yeast two-hybrid system (Clontech) or the DUALhybrid system (Dualsystems Biotech). Yeast growth on medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (-L-W) indicates presence of AD and BD constructs and on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine and alanine (-L-W-H-A) interactions between the AD and BD fusion proteins. Yeast plates were kept in 28°C growth chambers for 5 days before imaging. SPL and GATA proteins identified in these screens are summarized in Table S3 .
A. thaliana (Col-0) mesophyll protoplast isolation and transformation were carried out as reported ( Yoo et al., 2007 75. Yoo, S.D. ∙ Cho, Y.H. ∙ Sheen, J. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts: a versatile cell system for transient gene expression analysis Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :1565-1572 Crossref Scopus (3728) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from leaves of 4–5-week-old A. thaliana plants grown under short-day conditions. For transfection, 100 μL of fresh protoplast solution (40,000 protoplasts) was transformed with 8 μg of high-quality plasmids (4 μg each for co-transfection) using the PEG-calcium method. Transfected protoplasts were incubated at room temperature (22-25°C) for 16 h in the dark before harvest. For drug treatment, a final concentration of 20 μM MG132 (Sigma), 5 μM Bortezomib (Sigma), 10 μM E-64d (Sigma) or 5 mM 3-MA (Sigma) were added during the 16-h incubation period. Except for 3-MA which was prepared as 0.1 M stock solution in water, the others were prepared as 10 mM stock solution in DMSO. Equivalent volume of DMSO was used as mock control. For detection of proteins on western blots, whole protein extracts from protoplasts were separated on NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris Gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to 0.45-μm PVDF membranes (Thermo Scientific) using the Bio-Rad mini-PROTEAN Electrophoresis system. Membranes were blocked by incubation in 5% (w/v) milk power in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was carried out at 4°C overnight. Antibody to SAP05 from AY-WB phytoplasma were raised to the mature part of the SAP05 protein (residues 33–135), which was produced with a 6XHis-tag into E. coli and purified. The purified protein was used for raising polyclonal antibodies in rabbits (Genscript). Optimal detection of SAP05 in phytoplasma-infected plants occurred at a 1:2,000 dilution of the antibody, and this dilution was used in all western blot experiments for the detection of SAP05. The OptimAb HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Eurogentec) was used to detect hemagglutinin (HA)-fusion proteins at the concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. The ANTI-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma, F-3165) was used to detect FLAG tag-fusion proteins at a 1: 5000 dilution. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used with 1:10,000 dilution. Protein loading was visualized using Amido black staining solution (Sigma).
Agroinfiltration-based transient gene expression in N. benthamiana leaves and co-immunoprecipitations were performed as described with minor modifications ( MacLean et al., 2014 45. MacLean, A.M. ∙ Orlovskis, Z. ∙ Kowitwanich, K. ... Phytoplasma effector SAP54 hijacks plant reproduction by degrading MADS-box proteins and promotes insect colonization in a RAD23-dependent manner PLoS Biol. 2014; 12 :e1001835 Crossref Scopus (169) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 3XHA-TFs and SAP05 or GFP were expressed in N. benthamiana leaves for checking protein abundance. 3XHA-TFs and GFP-SAP05 or GFP constructs were expressed in N. benthamiana leaves for co-immunoprecipitation assays. The subcellular localization of GFP or RFP-tagged proteins transiently expressed in N. benthamiana leaves was visualized with Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with the objective EC Plan-Neofluar 20x/NA 0.5. Images were taken with ZEN 2012 SP5 (Black) software and visualized with the ImageJ Fiji software.
The expression of rSPL11-GUS and rSPL13-GUS reporter genes and the GUS staining of healthy or phytoplasma-infected plants at 4 weeks after phytoplasma inoculation was performed as described previously ( Xu et al., 2016 74. Xu, M. ∙ Hu, T. ∙ Zhao, J. ... Developmental Functions of miR156-Regulated SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana PLoS Genet. 2016; 12 :e1006263 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GUS-stained area on A. thaliana leaves was quantified with the ImageJ Fiji software.
DNA that code for SAP05 (Ala33-Lys135), ZnF_AtSPL5 (Ser60-Leu127), SPL5 (full length), vWA domian of AtRPN10 (Val2-Gly193) or a vWA mutant (38GA39- > HS) were subcloned to either pOPINF (for N-terminal His tag), pOPINA (no tag or C-terminal His tag), pOPINS3C (N-terminal His-SUMO tag) or pOPINM (N-terminal His-MBP tag) ( Berrow et al., 2007 8. Berrow, N.S. ∙ Alderton, D. ∙ Sainsbury, S. ... A versatile ligation-independent cloning method suitable for high-throughput expression screening applications Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :e45 Crossref Scopus (419) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MBP-vWA fragment was amplified from pOPINM-vWA and ligated to PopinA to remove the His tag. The vectors were transformed or co-transformed into E.coli strain BL21 (DE3). Protein expression and affinity purification using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) were carried out according to manufacture’s instruction (Ni-NTA agarose, QIAGEN). Briefly, protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 16°C for 20 h with shaking at 220 rev min -1 . Cell pellets were lysed in IMAC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM glycine, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0) for affinity purification and eluted with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM glycine, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0). Further purification was achieved by gel filtration (ÄKTA™ avant chromatography system) in gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5). When necessary, the tags were removed by HRV 3C protease in gel filtration buffer. For purifying the SAP05-vWA complex, MBP-vWA was co-expressed with His-SAP05. For testing complex formation in gel filtration, equal amount (molecular weight) of proteins were mixed in gel filtration buffer and left on ice for 45 mins before sample injection. For in vitro pull-down assay, His-tagged vWA or evWA domains were bound to 50 μL Ni-NTA agarose beads during protein purification starting from 50 mL cell culture and the beads were washed sequencially with IMAC buffer and gel filtration buffer. 20 μM SAP05 and/or ZnF domain of AtSPL5 were incubated with the Ni-NTA agarose beads in 100 μL gel filtration buffer for 1 h. After discarding the supernatant, the beads were washed sequencially with gel filtration buffer and IMAC buffer. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted in 100 μL elution buffer. Input samples and pull-down samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining.
For in vitro 26S proteasome degradation assay, highly purified human 26S proteasome preparation (BostonBiochem) was used immediately after thawing. 2.5 μg His-SPL5 and 5 μg SAP05 or 10 μg SAP05-vWA complex were added to 2 μg of 26S proteasome in 200 μL reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM Nacl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 5 mM ATP) and incubated at 28°C. 50 μM MG132 was added to inactivate the 26S proteasome activity. 20 μL aliquots from each reaction were collected at indicated times. Collected samples were added with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled immediately and stored at −20°C until used for western blot analysis. Penta-His antobody (QIAGEN) was used at a 1:5,000 dilution for detecting His-fusion proteins. Recombinant vWA domain was probed with an anti-AtRPN10 polyclonal antibody (Agrisera) at 1:5000.
For A. thaliana inoculation, one leaf from a 4-week-old plant grown under short-day conditions was exposed to two or three AY-WB-carrier leafhoppers in a clip cage for 2 days. The leaf and the clip cage with carrier insects were then removed. For disease symptom recording, healthy or phytoplasma-exposed plants were kept in short-day conditions (10 h light/14 h dark, 22°C) for observing leaf development and survival or transferred to long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark, 22°C) for examining branching phenotypes.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed on Phylogeny.fr web server ( http://www.phylogeny.fr/index.cgi ; Dereeper et al., 2008). Briefly, sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (v3.8.31) configured for highest accuracy. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the maximum-likelihood method implemented in the PhyML program (v3.1/3,0 aLRT). Graphical representation and editing of the phylogenetic trees were performed with TreeDyn (v198.3).
Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 7. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze experimental data with more than 2 two experimental groups followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, and two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used for other data analysis.
