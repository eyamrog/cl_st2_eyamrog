Title: An early cell shape transition drives evolutionary expansion of the human forebrain


Abstract: Summary

The human brain has undergone rapid expansion since humans diverged from other great apes, but the mechanism of this human-specific enlargement is still unknown. Here, we use cerebral organoids derived from human, gorilla, and chimpanzee cells to study developmental mechanisms driving evolutionary brain expansion. We find that neuroepithelial differentiation is a protracted process in apes, involving a previously unrecognized transition state characterized by a change in cell shape. Furthermore, we show that human organoids are larger due to a delay in this transition, associated with differences in interkinetic nuclear migration and cell cycle length. Comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals differences in expression dynamics of cell morphogenesis factors, including ZEB2, a known epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator. We show that ZEB2 promotes neuroepithelial transition, and its manipulation and downstream signaling leads to acquisition of nonhuman ape architecture in the human context and vice versa, establishing an important role for neuroepithelial cell shape in human brain expansion.

Section: Introduction

One of the most distinctive features of humans as a species is an enlarged brain. The human brain exhibits a 1,000-fold increase in total neuron number compared with mice ( Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006 38. Herculano-Houzel, S. ∙ Mota, B. ∙ Lent, R. Cellular scaling rules for rodent brains Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :12138-12143 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is the largest of all primates, roughly 3-fold larger than that of our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas ( Herculano-Houzel, 2012 37. Herculano-Houzel, S. The remarkable, yet not extraordinary, human brain as a scaled-up primate brain and its associated cost Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A number of studies have examined differences in brain development between human, mouse, and other distantly related model organisms ( Bae et al., 2015 8. Bae, B.I. ∙ Jayaraman, D. ∙ Walsh, C.A.

Although much has been learned about the mechanisms governing evolutionary divergence of primates from rodents, human-specific changes compared to other apes are less well understood.
Comparative studies have led to a number of important insights. Early in development, before the onset of neurogenesis, the human forebrain is already larger than that of mouse and macaque, indicating differences in expansion of precursor cells called neuroepithelial (NE) cells ( Rakic, 2007 80. Rakic, P. The radial edifice of cortical architecture: from neuronal silhouettes to genetic engineering Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2007; 55 :204-219 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, it has long been hypothesized that changes in these cells could lead to an expansion of the neocortical primordium ( Rakic, 1988 78. Rakic, P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas Science. 1988; 241 :170-176 Crossref Scopus (2535) PubMed Google Scholar , 1995 79. Rakic, P. A small step for the cell, a giant leap for mankind: a hypothesis of neocortical expansion during evolution Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18 :383-388 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (878) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparison of adult brain morphology has also revealed non-uniform thickening of cortical layers in primates, especially apes ( Charvet et al., 2017 13. Charvet, C.J. ∙ Stimpson, C.D. ∙ Kim, Y.D. ...

Evolution of the Human Nervous System Function, Structure, and Development Cell. 2017; 170 :226-247 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (283) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given that cortical layers are generated successively over time, this points to expansion events in humans and other apes after the onset of neurogenesis. However, comparisons of the human brain to that of other apes reveal a general increase in size without an expansion in particular layers of the cerebral cortex ( Donahue et al., 2018 20. Donahue, C.J. ∙ Glasser, M.F. ∙ Preuss, T.M. ... Quantitative assessment of prefrontal cortex in humans relative to nonhuman primates Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E5183-E5192 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar , de Sousa et al., 2010 16. de Sousa, A.A. ∙ Sherwood, C.C. ∙ Schleicher, A. ...

Comparative analysis of cortical layering and supragranular layer enlargement in rodent carnivore and primate species Brain Res. 2005; 1052 :71-81 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that while primate expansion may have been governed by both early and late changes, human-specific differences likely take place prior to the generation of cortical layer neurons. However, without being able to examine and manipulate early progenitor cell behavior in apes and humans, these observations have remained correlative.
Most of our understanding of the principles governing mammalian brain development comes from studying the mouse, where at ∼E10, cells rapidly undergo a switch from NE cells to radial glia (RG), triggering the onset of neurogenesis ( Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009 45. Kriegstein, A. ∙ Alvarez-Buylla, A. The glial nature of embryonic and adult neural stem cells Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32 :149-184 Crossref Scopus (1820) PubMed Google Scholar ). Before this transition, NE cells exhibit a columnar morphology and divide in a symmetric proliferative manner. This proliferation results in an exponential expansion leading to a ballooning out of the neocortex and enlargement of the ventricles in humans ( Bayer et al., 1993 9. Bayer, S.A. ∙ Altman, J. ∙ Russo, R.J. ... Timetables of neurogenesis in the human brain based on experimentally determined patterns in the rat Neurotoxicology. 1993; 14 :83-144 PubMed Google Scholar ). NE cells are strongly epithelial in character and held together near their apical surface by cell-cell junctions, namely tight junction components (i.e., OCLN) and adherens junction components (i.e., CDH1) ( Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996 1. Aaku-Saraste, E. ∙ Hellwig, A. ∙ Huttner, W.B. Loss of occludin and functional tight junctions, but not ZO-1, during neural tube closure--remodeling of the neuroepithelium prior to neurogenesis Dev. Biol. 1996; 180 :664-679 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rogers et al., 2018 84. Rogers, C.D. ∙ Sorrells, L.K. ∙ Bronner, M.E. A catenin-dependent balance between N-cadherin and E-cadherin controls neuroectodermal cell fate choices Mech. Dev. 2018; 152 :44-56 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). In rodents and other model vertebrates, it is well-documented that the transition to neurogenic RG cells involves a loss of some epithelial features, a thinning and elongation of the cell, the onset of expression of certain glial markers, and a switch to asymmetric cell division with one daughter remaining a RG, and the other becoming more differentiated and leaving the ventricular zone ( Götz and Huttner, 2005 32. Götz, M. ∙ Huttner, W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 :777-788 Crossref Scopus (1671) PubMed Google Scholar ). This switch in cell fate thus leads to a change in expansion from tangential to radial, with additional cells being added to the more basal layers, rather than along the apical surface of the ventricles. Although this NE-to-RG conversion has been studied in mice, where it occurs in a matter of hours, it remains entirely unknown how this process occurs in humans and other apes.
The ability to generate brain organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has enabled researchers to study a variety of neurodevelopmental processes that were previously inaccessible ( Lancaster et al., 2013 49.

Recently, a number of studies have started tackling evolutionary differences across primates, highlighting human-specific patterns of gene expression ( Kanton et al., 2019 43.

Establishing Cerebral Organoids as Models of Human-Specific Brain Evolution Cell. 2019; 176 :743-756.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). Human organoids appear to develop and mature at a slower pace, with neurogenesis commencing later ( Otani et al., 2016 68. Otani, T. ∙ Marchetto, M.C. ∙ Gage, F.H. ... 2D and 3D Stem Cell Models of Primate Cortical Development Identify Species-Specific Differences in Progenitor Behavior Contributing to Brain Size Cell Stem Cell. 2016; 18 :467-480 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (238) PubMed Google Scholar ), RG cells displaying a longer mitotic phase ( Mora-Bermúdez et al., 2016 61.

Organoid single-cell genomic atlas uncovers human-specific features of brain development Nature. 2019; 574 :418-422 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Biol. 2015; 25 :772-779 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although these studies point to important differences in terms of RG behaviors, all these comparisons have been performed at stages where neurogenesis is already underway. Given the neuroanatomical comparisons that point to an early expansion and a universal increase in neurons, it would be highly informative to examine early human and ape progenitors at a stage preceding neurogenesis. Furthermore, extending comparative analysis to include other great apes beyond chimpanzee would help identify true human-specific cellular adaptations (rather than chimpanzee-specific differences) involved in brain size determination.
Here, we examined developing human, chimpanzee, and gorilla brain organoids. We found that during early NE expansion, the NE to RG transition in human and ape is a gradual process, taking place over the course of several days, unlike the rapid differentiation of NE to RG cells described in mouse, and it involves an intermediate cell morphology state we named transitioning NE (tNE) cells. During this transition, cell shape changes occur before the change in cell identity and the onset of neurogenesis. Furthermore, human NE cells are delayed relative to ape in making this transition and proliferate more. To identify the molecular mechanism underlying these differences, we performed time-resolved sequencing analysis and identified differential expression dynamics of the zinc-finger transcription factor ZEB2 . Through ZEB2 loss- and gain-of-function experiments, we show that this gene is a driver of the NE to RG cell transition. Finally, manipulation of ZEB2 expression and its downstream signaling is able to force a human-like phenotype in the ape context and vice versa. Thus, our data suggest that in humans, a delayed onset of ZEB2 expression extends the NE stage, contributing to human-specific neocortical expansion.

Section: Results

To investigate evolutionary differences in brain development between apes, we generated cerebral organoids from human, gorilla, and chimpanzee cell lines, including a new gorilla cell line ( Figure S1 A). We optimized the protocol so that an identical method could be used for all species ( Figure 1 A) resulting in highly comparable telencephalic tissues ( Figure S1 B). This was vital to be able to attribute any differences to species-specific divergence and not protocol variations. We did, however, notice that prior to neural induction, chimpanzee embryoid bodies (EBs) progressed faster than human and gorilla EBs, potentially reflecting the shorter gestational period of chimpanzees ( Ardito, 1976 7. Ardito, G. Check-list of the data on the gestation length of primates J. Hum. Evol. 1976; 5 :213-222 Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar ). However, the difference in timing may also be a result of cell line differences and further study is needed. Nonetheless, in order to obtain comparable tissues of the proper identity ( Figure S1 C), timing was optimized and chimpanzee organoids were transferred to neural induction 2 days earlier ( Figure 1 A). All steps subsequent to germ layer determination were identical across the species.
Human organoids were consistently larger than gorilla and chimpanzee organoids at a stage when telencephalic neuroepithelial buds had formed and were undergoing expansion ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 D). We examined several time points during neuroepithelial expansion ( Figure S1 E) revealing similar size ( Figure 1 B) and tissue architecture ( Figure 1 D) across species at 3 days after neural induction. At day 5, however, gorilla and chimpanzee organoids presented more rounded circular neuroepithelial buds, while human organoids showed more elongated neuroepithelial buds ( Figure 1 B). Staining for ZO1, a tight junction protein that marks the apical surface of polarized epithelia ( Ando-Akatsuka et al., 1999 5. Ando-Akatsuka, Y. ∙ Yonemura, S. ∙ Itoh, M. ... Differential behavior of E-cadherin and occludin in their colocalization with ZO-1 during the establishment of epithelial cell polarity J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179 :115-125 Crossref Scopus (153) PubMed Google Scholar ; Medelnik et al., 2018 58. Medelnik, J.P. ∙ Roensch, K. ∙ Okawa, S. ... Signaling-Dependent Control of Apical Membrane Size and Self-Renewal in Rosette-Stage Human Neuroepithelial Stem Cells Stem Cell Reports. 2018; 10 :1751-1765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealed smaller, more rounded apical lumens in nonhuman ape organoids ( Figures 1 E and S1 F). Using a custom image analysis pipeline, apical lumens were segmented and reconstructed in 3D, revealing species-specific differences in luminal shape and size ( Figure 1 F). Quantification of the largest lumen per organoid revealed that human organoids were capable of forming larger lumens than those of the other apes ( Figures 1 G and S1 G).
The most likely explanation for expanded lumens would be a delay in the switch from symmetrically expanding NE cells to neurogenic RG cells. We therefore tested whether at this stage ape organoids had already switched to generating neurons by staining for neurogenic TBR2 + intermediate progenitors and DCX + newborn neurons. In human and gorilla organoids, neither cell type was present at day 5, only becoming clearly evident between days 10 and 15 ( Figure S2 A). This suggests that a faster neurogenic switch in ape compared to human does not explain the difference in size of cortical tissues.
Another possible explanation for the difference in tissue morphology is a difference in cell morphology. Sparse viral labeling with GFP revealed progenitors with a wide, columnar shape characteristic of NE cells at day 3 ( Figure 2 A). At day 5, however, when the difference in tissue architecture first appears, human NE cells were still wide and columnar in shape, whereas chimpanzee and gorilla NE cells exhibited more constricted apical processes ( Figure 2 A). To quantify these differences, we measured the apical surface area of individual progenitor cells using ZO1 staining to delineate apical edges at the lumen ( Figure 2 B). At day 5, the apical surface of nonhuman ape NE cells was significantly more constricted compared to human ( Figure 2 C). These findings point to species-specific differences in cell shape and reveal an apically constricted transition state, herein referred to as transitioning NE (tNE), that occurs prior to the change in cellular identity and neurogenesis characteristic of RG cells.
To further quantify cell shape, we turned to higher resolution spinning-disk confocal imaging with segmentation of individual cells. Because our findings were consistent within species and across nonhuman ape cell lines, we focused on a comparison of organoids from one representative human and one representative ape cell line. Although NE cells of the two species exhibited similar morphologies at day 3, gorilla NE cells at day 5 exhibited decreased apical process volume compared with human as a result of their highly constricted morphology ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Human cells instead exhibited this more elongated, narrow shape at day 8 ( Figure S2 B), whereas by day 10, both human and gorilla NE cells exhibited a similarly elongated and constricted morphology typical of RG cells ( Figures 2 D, 2E, and S2 B).
We next performed a temporal assessment of progenitor cell apical surface area as labeled by ZO1. At day 3, the average apical surface of cells was large and indistinguishable between human and gorilla. By day 10, both human and gorilla exhibited complete transition with apical surface area decreasing by 7-fold ( Figures 3 A and 3B). However, the transition was delayed in human, where apical surface area at day 8 more closely matched that of gorilla at day 5. These findings reveal a later switch to apically constricted tNE morphologies in human compared with nonhuman ape organoids.
Cell shape is closely linked to cell cycle through interkinetic nuclear migration, a behavior characteristic of NE and RG cells in which the nucleus moves along the apicobasal axis in time with the cell cycle. We investigated nuclear positioning and observed more frequent apical nuclei in human NE at day 5 ( Figures 3 C–3E), suggesting a difference in interkinetic nuclear migration and pointing to potential cell cycle differences. To explore this possibility, we performed live imaging of whole organoids over the course of several days, using SiMView adaptive light sheet microscopy ( Video S1 ) ( McDole et al., 2018 57. McDole, K. ∙ Guignard, L. ∙ Amat, F. ... In Toto Imaging and Reconstruction of Post-Implantation Mouse Development at the Single-Cell Level Cell. 2018; 175 :859-876.e33 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). As previously described ( Subramanian et al., 2017 93. Subramanian, L. ∙ Bershteyn, M. ∙ Paredes, M.F. ... Dynamic behaviour of human neuroepithelial cells in the developing forebrain Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14167 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ), we observed a transient loss of the basal process during NE cell division in both human and gorilla. Following the division, the apical processes of human NE daughter cells appeared thicker than those of gorilla ( Figures 3 F and S3 ; Videos S2 , S3 , S4 , and S5 ), consistent with our findings above. We also measured cell cycle lengths, revealing a shorter cell cycle in human NE cells ( Figure 3 G). Mathematical growth curve modeling of the effect of this 3-h cell cycle difference predicted a progenitor and neuron number increase in human of 1.9-fold ( Figure 3 H). These findings together suggest changes in cell shape are coupled to the cell cycle, and a delay in this transition in human leads to a larger founder progenitor pool and therefore an expected increase in neuron number ( Figure 3 I).

To identify what factors might be controlling these changes in cell shape, we examined the transcriptome profile of human and gorilla organoids. Although there are a number of published cerebral organoid single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets, including from human and chimpanzee ( Kanton et al., 2019 43. Kanton, S. ∙ Boyle, M.J. ∙ He, Z. ...

Differences and similarities between human and chimpanzee neural progenitors during cerebral cortex development eLife. 2016; 5 :e18683 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pollen et al., 2019 74. Pollen, A.A. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Andrews, M.G. ... Establishing Cerebral Organoids as Models of Human-Specific Brain Evolution Cell. 2019; 176 :743-756.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ), those collected to date do not capture early NE to RG transition stages with a high enough temporal resolution. Therefore, we decided to perform bulk RNA-seq of a large number of organoids across many early time points and replicates to identify high confidence differentially expressed genes. In total, we performed RNA-seq of 42 samples of ∼9,000 organoids, collected from day 0, corresponding to pre-neurulation tissue, up until day 25, corresponding to fully committed neurogenesis ( Figure 4 A). To compare expression of genes shared between both species, transcripts per millions (TPMs) were calculated using a filtered list of annotated genes for which an orthologous gene was present in both species ( Figure S4 A). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the samples showed biological replicates grouping together, highlighting the robustness and reproducibility of the protocol ( Figure S4 B). It also showed samples separated by species along PC1, followed by grouping by time along PC2 and PC3. PC1 was likely driven by technical artifacts arising from read mapping and annotation differences coming from the reference genomes of the two species. Therefore, to normalize within each species and at the same time focus on dynamics rather than absolute levels, the expression of each gene was normalized by Z -scaling across time.
PCA of normalized data showed samples of the same time point across species grouped together ( Figure 4 B). Hierarchical clustering on mean Z scores ( Figure 4 C) and Pearson’s correlation analysis ( Figures 4 D and S4 C) also showed grouping by time rather than species. A panel of genes with characteristic developmental roles showed expected patterns of expression in both species ( Figure 4 E). These data further confirm the proper identity and developmental trajectory of organoids from both species and demonstrate they are highly comparable.
Although organoids collected at the same time point appeared highly correlated across species, the PCA biplot revealed a degree of separation between species at days 5, 10, and 25 ( Figure 4 B). We performed Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis on the top 300 genes driving the variance at these time points ( Data S1 ). GO terms at all time points were generally associated with nervous system development, with earlier day 5 time point terms primarily covering organ development and morphogenesis, and day 25 terms associated with neuronal compartments such as dendrites and synapses, as well as neurogenesis ( Figure 4 F). We further examined some of the genes driving the variance at day 25 and saw a steeper rate of increase in genes associated with synaptic formation and maturation in gorilla ( Figure S4 D). This is consistent with previous studies ( Kanton et al., 2019 43. Kanton, S. ∙ Boyle, M.J. ∙ He, Z. ... Organoid single-cell genomic atlas uncovers human-specific features of brain development Nature. 2019; 574 :418-422 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2012 52. Liu, X. ∙ Somel, M. ∙ Tang, L. ... Extension of cortical synaptic development distinguishes humans from chimpanzees and macaques Genome Res. 2012; 22 :611-622 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ; Marchetto et al., 2019 54.

Species-specific maturation profiles of human, chimpanzee and bonobo neural cells eLife. 2019; 8 :e37527 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggesting that human neurons mature at a slower rate.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was also lower at day 5 and day 10 than any of the other time points ( Figure 4 D), coinciding with our observed differences in cell shape. We next focused on gene expression changes arising between day 3 and day 10, which would cover the time taken in both species for progenitors to transition from NE through tNE to RG morphologies. We analyzed abundantly expressed genes (TPM >10) with reproducible expression patterns between biological replicates (squared difference <6) and those with more dynamic expression patterns over the 3 time points (fold change >1.5 between any two time points in at least one species). This resulted in a list of 2,905 genes that were then subjected to analysis by TCseq ( Wu and Gu, 2020 99. Wu, M. ∙ Gu, L. TCseq: Time course sequencing data analysis. R package version 1.12.0 2020 https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TCseq.html Google Scholar ) to cluster genes with similar temporal patterns. Focusing on 3 time points meant that temporal patterns could be represented by and separated into 10 clusters with distinct shapes ( Figure 5 A). During TCseq analysis, biological replicates were kept separate in order to further filter for genes with reliable cluster assignment (i.e., genes where ≥2 replicates were assigned to the same cluster), yielding a list of 2,342 genes per species ( Data S1 ).
To assign biological functions to the identified temporal patterns, we performed GO term enrichment analysis on each TCseq cluster, keeping human and gorilla genes separate ( Data S1 ). We focused on GO:BP terms found in both species and examined whether each term was found in the same cluster for both species, or different clusters which would indicate a species-specific change in temporal dynamics for that biological function. This revealed a number of GO:BP terms associated with clusters common to both species ( Figure 5 A), for example, GO:BP terms related to “neurogenesis” and “RNA processing” exhibited identical expression dynamics in both species.
GO:BP terms with differential expression dynamics between the two species represented particularly interesting biological functions. To visualize the major shifts in temporal expression patterns, we generated a weighted network graph of GO:BP terms that were uniquely present for one species in a given cluster, but present in a different cluster for the other species ( Figure 5 A). The largest shift of GO:BP terms was between human cluster 4 and gorilla cluster 6, where terms such as “ribonucleoprotein complex assembly” were seen to move from a pattern showing a more gradual decrease in expression in human, to one dropping sharply after day 3 in gorilla ( Figure S5 A). These terms were linked to the umbrella term, “RNA processing,” and point to interesting changes in alternative splicing, previously highlighted as a key driver of evolutionary differences across primates ( Bush et al., 2017 12. Bush, S.J. ∙ Chen, L. ∙ Tovar-Corona, J.M. ... Alternative splicing and the evolution of phenotypic novelty Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372 :20150474 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ). Another interesting shift in GO terms was “cell cycle” moving from a cluster where expression levels were similar between day 3 and 5 in human (cluster 8), to a cluster where expression levels had already started declining by day 5 in gorilla (cluster 4) ( Figure S5 B). This finding fits well with the observed differences in cell cycle length ( Figure 3 G).
The shift that we found most relevant was in GO terms such as “cell morphogenesis” and “cellular component morphogenesis,” which were present in cluster 3 of gorilla but in clusters 1, 9, and 10 of human ( Figure 5 A), because differences in cell morphogenesis were precisely what we had observed. These terms were associated with genes whose expression increased more rapidly in gorilla than in human ( Figure 5 B), matching the more rapid transition in cell shape observed in nonhuman apes. In particular, SHROOM3 ( Figure 5 C) immediately stood out due to its role in actin-mediated apical constriction ( Haigo et al., 2003 34. Haigo, S.L. ∙ Hildebrand, J.D. ∙ Harland, R.M. ... Shroom induces apical constriction and is required for hingepoint formation during neural tube closure Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 :2125-2137 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hildebrand and Soriano, 1999 39. Hildebrand, J.D. ∙ Soriano, P. Shroom, a PDZ domain-containing actin-binding protein, is required for neural tube morphogenesis in mice Cell. 1999; 99 :485-497 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lee et al., 2007 50. Lee, C. ∙ Scherr, H.M. ∙ Wallingford, J.B. Shroom family proteins regulate γ-tubulin distribution and microtubule architecture during epithelial cell shape change Development. 2007; 134 :1431-1441 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunostaining for SHROOM3 at day 5 confirmed the differences detected by RNA-seq, with strong SHROOM3 localization visible along the apical surface in gorilla, whereas apical surfaces of human progenitors showed minimal to no staining ( Figure 5 D). By day 10, strong SHROOM3 staining was seen at the apical surface in both species ( Figure S5 C). Phalloidin staining also revealed more extensive accumulation of actin at the apical surface of day 5 gorilla tNE cells ( Figure S5 D), whereas such accumulation appeared later in human ( Figure S5 E). These results point to SHROOM3 and actin in apical constriction in the context of NE transition.
A closer inspection of the genes contributing to the GO:BP term shift that displayed earlier onset of expression in gorilla, revealed a group of genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ( Figure S5 F). This was particularly interesting because the process of corticogenesis, from NE cells to neurons, is characterized by a progressive and gradual loss of epithelial features, reminiscent of EMT ( Singh and Solecki, 2015 88. Singh, S. ∙ Solecki, D.J. Polarity transitions during neurogenesis and germinal zone exit in the developing central nervous system Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9 :62 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ). One such epithelial feature that is lost is the presence of the tight junction protein OCLN ( Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996 1. Aaku-Saraste, E. ∙ Hellwig, A. ∙ Huttner, W.B. Loss of occludin and functional tight junctions, but not ZO-1, during neural tube closure--remodeling of the neuroepithelium prior to neurogenesis Dev. Biol. 1996; 180 :664-679 Crossref Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ). Staining for OCLN revealed a difference in its distribution over time, going from extended staining along the entire apico-basal axis of individual cells at day 3 ( Figure S5 G) to a limited distribution apically at day 10 ( Figure S5 H). This change in its distribution was delayed in human, with day 5 organoids exhibiting a similar pattern to day 3, whereas gorilla OCLN was already more apically restricted ( Figure 5 E).
To identify upstream regulators of this process, we queried the set of genes with robust differential temporal dynamics ( Data S1 ) that belonged to the “cell morphogenesis” GO:BP term for genes predicted to be transcription factors, revealing a set of 8 genes ( Figure 5 F). Of these, ZEB2 stood out due to its well-described role as an EMT master regulator ( Peinado et al., 2007 72. Peinado, H. ∙ Olmeda, D. ∙ Cano, A. Snail, Zeb and bHLH factors in tumour progression: an alliance against the epithelial phenotype? Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7 :415-428 Crossref Scopus (2685) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stemmler et al., 2019 91. Stemmler, M.P. ∙ Eccles, R.L. ∙ Brabletz, S. ... Non-redundant functions of EMT transcription factors Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21 :102-112 Crossref Scopus (352) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, several comparative genomics analyses have pulled out ZEB2 as a human gene under selective pressure and exhibiting various human accelerated regions (HARs) ( Erwin et al., 2014 23. Erwin, G.D. ∙ Oksenberg, N. ∙ Truty, R.M. ... Integrating diverse datasets improves developmental enhancer prediction PLoS Comput. Biol. 2014; 10 :e1003677 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011 51.

Pollard, K.S. ∙ Salama, S.R. ∙ King, B. ... Forces shaping the fastest evolving regions in the human genome PLoS Genet. 2006; 2 :e168 Crossref Scopus (347) PubMed Google Scholar ). ZEB2 , which showed a shift from cluster 1 in human to 2 in gorilla, therefore stood out as a potential regulator of cell shape in this context. The expression dynamics of ZEB2 revealed an earlier peak of expression in gorilla compared with human ( Figure 5 G), matching the expected expression pattern of a gene that could be initiating the tNE shape transition.
Further examination of the full time course of ZEB2 expression and its overall levels in the RNA-seq data ( Figure 6 A) revealed ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking at day 5 in gorilla, whereas in human ZEB2 peaked at day 10. We next examined ZEB2 protein and its downstream targets in human and gorilla organoids by western blot, revealing an earlier onset of expression of ZEB2 in gorilla compared to human ( Figure 6 B). Consistent with a precocious EMT-like transition in gorilla, the epithelial cell adhesion proteins CDH1 and EpCAM showed earlier downregulation, while Vimentin, a marker of both RG and EMT, showed earlier upregulation in gorilla compared to human ( Figure 6 B).
Immunofluorescence staining for ZEB2 across various stages of organoid development revealed specific nuclear expression appearing earlier in gorilla ( Figure 6 C). Expression was gradually lost from progenitors as neurogenesis began with a switch at later stages to postmitotic neurons ( Figures S6 A–S6C). In organoids that were still completing the transition to neurogenic states, we observed a mutually exclusive pattern of expression between ZEB2 and markers of committed RG identity, such as BLBP ( Figure 6 D) and GLAST ( Figure S6 D). These data suggest that ZEB2 expression increases in NE cells during their transition to RG cells, but is then lost in fully transitioned RG cells.
To test whether ZEB2 was required for the NE-tNE-RG transition, we generated ZEB2 mutant human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). CRISPR targeting resulted in recovery of only heterozygous loss-of-function cells ( Figures S6 E–S6H), suggesting it may be necessary for pluripotency or survival. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in ZEB2 have been described to cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a complex disorder that manifests as an array of brain developmental defects with variable penetrance ( Mowat et al., 2003 63. Mowat, D.R. ∙ Wilson, M.J. ∙ Goossens, M. Mowat-Wilson syndrome J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40 :305-310 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore reasoned that ZEB2 +/− organoids may be informative, both from an evolutionary point of view, and in understanding this human condition. Cytological and RT-PCR analyses confirmed the cells were healthy and expressed key pluripotency marker genes to the same levels as the parental control ( Figures S6 I and S6J) despite showing a reduction in ZEB2 mRNA levels ( Figure S6 J). Western blot analysis of ZEB2 +/− organoids confirmed a reduction in ZEB2 protein compared to control ( Figure S6 K) and revealed expected effects on junctional proteins CDH1, CDH2, and OCLN ( Figure 6 E).
We next tested whether the ZEB2 +/− mutation led to changes in tissue architecture consistent with a role in NE to RG cell transition. Bright field imaging revealed more prominent and extended neuroepithelial buds ( Figure 6 F) with overall larger sizes ( Figure 6 G) and reduced thickness ( Figure 6 H) consistent with defective NE to RG transition. Furthermore, ZEB2 +/− organoids showed significantly decreased numbers of TBR2 + intermediate progenitor cells at early stages ( Figure S6 L) that returned to normal at later stages ( Figures S6 M and S6N), suggesting a potential delay in neurogenesis that would be consistent with a delayed transition to neurogenic RG. We tested the specificity of this phenotype by introducing a doxycycline inducible overexpression construct for ZEB2-GFP ( Figure S6 O) into ZEB2 +/− cells and selecting clones with proper integration of the expression cassette ( Figures S6 P and S6Q). iZEB2 clones of ZEB2 +/− cells ( ZEB2 +/− ; iZEB2 ) displayed a rescued phenotype upon doxycycline induction, both in terms of neuroepithelial bud size ( Figures 6 I and S6 R) and TBR2 + cell numbers ( Figures S6 S and S6T).
Staining of early neurogenic organoids showed that although control organoids had redistributed the tight junction epithelial protein OCLN near the apical surface of cells, ZEB2 +/− mutant organoids retained marked OCLN staining along the entire apico-basal axis of individual progenitor cells ( Figure 6 J). Together, these findings reveal a specific effect of decreased ZEB2 levels on tight junctions and cell shape of transitioning NE cells that leads to an enlarged neuroepithelium.
We next tested whether changing ZEB2 expression dynamics to match that of the gorilla would be sufficient to trigger an earlier transition to tNE cells in human organoids. We generated an otherwise wild-type human cell line harboring the inducible ZEB2-GFP described above ( Figure S7 A). We observed robust and tight expression upon induction, both by western blot and immunofluorescent staining ( Figures S7 B and S7C). Following doxycycline treatment in stem cells, we observed a reduction in EpCAM and CDH1 staining accompanied by an increase in VIM and CDH2 staining ( Figures S7 D and S7E) relative to the uninduced control.
Organoids from these inducible ZEB2 human (Hum iZEB2 ) cells were treated with doxycycline to induce ZEB2 expression at an earlier stage ( Figure 7 A). Examination of tissue architecture at day 3 revealed indistinguishable morphology between uninduced Hum iZEB2 , induced Hum iZEB2 , and gorilla organoids ( Figure S7 F). By day 5, however, neuroepithelial buds generated in induced Hum iZEB2 organoids were more similar to gorilla in shape, appearing smaller and more rounded, whereas uninduced Hum iZEB2 organoids exhibited buds with more elongated shapes typical of human organoids ( Figures 7 B and S7 F). This change in morphology was also accompanied by earlier expression and localization of SHROOM3 ( Figures 7 A and S7 G), the actin regulator identified to exhibit precocious expression in gorilla ( Figure 5 D).
Sparse viral labeling with GFP revealed that NE cells of induced Hum iZEB2 organoids were less columnar and more tNE-like in shape than uninduced cells, with a thinning of apical and basal processes that was highly similar to gorilla tNE cells at the same time point ( Figure 7 C). Changes in cell shape and apical constriction were quantified by cell segmentation ( Figure 7 D) and ZO1 staining of the apical surface ( Figure 7 E), revealing a remarkably similar apical constriction in human ZEB2 overexpressing organoids to gorilla organoids ( Figures 7 F and 7G). We further tested the effect on tissue size by measuring neuroepithelial bud perimeter and organoid area ( Figures 7 H and S7 H), revealing a phenotype reminiscent of the nonhuman ape. Staining of later stages revealed normal neurogenesis ( Figure S7 I), demonstrating that these effects seemed to specifically affect the timing and not the identity or fate of progenitors. These findings suggest that premature expression of ZEB2 in human organoids is sufficient to recapitulate the precocious tNE cell shape change seen in gorilla organoids.
ZEB2, also known as SMAD interacting protein 1 (SIP1), is a known regulator of SMAD signaling that leads to downstream effects on cell-cell junction proteins including OCLN and CDH1 and 2 ( Vandewalle et al., 2005 95. Vandewalle, C. ∙ Comijn, J. ∙ De Craene, B. ... SIP1/ZEB2 induces EMT by repressing genes of different epithelial cell-cell junctions Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33 :6566-6578 Crossref Scopus (453) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore tested whether SMAD signaling may also be responsible for the effects of ZEB2 in this context by performing rescue experiments with SMAD inhibitors in the context of ZEB2 +/− mutation. We observed a rescue of the effects of ZEB2 on expression of junction protein CDH1 ( Figure S7 J) as well as rescued tissue architecture ( Figure S7 K), suggesting SMAD signaling may be responsible for the EMT effects of ZEB2 during the NE to RG transition.
We next took advantage of this information to see whether gorilla organoids could be encouraged to take on a more human-like phenotype by manipulating SMAD signaling. We focused on activation of BMP-responsive SMADs, because this pathway has previously been shown to inhibit EMT ( Amarnath and Agarwala, 2017 2. Amarnath, S. ∙ Agarwala, S. Cell-cycle-dependent TGFβ-BMP antagonism regulates neural tube closure by modulating tight junctions J. Cell Sci. 2017; 130 :119-131 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ZEB2 can inhibit BMP-responsive SMADs in other neuronal contexts ( Menuchin-Lasowski et al., 2020 59. Menuchin-Lasowski, Y. ∙ Dagan, B. ∙ Conidi, A. ... Zeb2 regulates the balance between retinal interneurons and Müller glia by inhibition of BMP-Smad signaling Dev. Biol. 2020; 468 :80-92 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Application of BMP4 on gorilla organoids when they would normally begin transitioning to tNE cell morphologies led to the appearance of cells with more dilated apical processes ( Figure 7 I) and enlarged apical contacts ( Figures 7 J and 7K), reminiscent of human NE cells. Thus, by activating downstream SMADs, we were able to override the EMT processes that would normally promote acquisition of tNE morphology at this stage.
Finally, because we observed a species-specific change in actin-associated apical constriction and SHROOM3 expression that was also responsive to ZEB2 ( Figures 7 A and S7 G), we used an orthogonal approach to manipulate apical constriction through the use of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a molecule previously shown to enlarge apical contacts of NE cells in vitro ( Medelnik et al., 2018 58. Medelnik, J.P. ∙ Roensch, K. ∙ Okawa, S. ... Signaling-Dependent Control of Apical Membrane Size and Self-Renewal in Rosette-Stage Human Neuroepithelial Stem Cells Stem Cell Reports. 2018; 10 :1751-1765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Application of LPA on gorilla organoids at the onset of NE transition led to morphologies more closely mimicking the human phenotype ( Figure 7 L) with enlarged apical contacts ( Figure 7 M) and more extended OCLN staining along the apicobasal axis ( Figure 7 L). Together, these findings point to a close interaction between cell-cell junctions and apical constriction, both of which are regulated by ZEB2 to drive the change in cell shape that characterizes this newly described transition state ( Figure 7 N).

Section: Discussion

These results provide insight into how NE cells transition into neurogenic RG cells, highlighting an intermediate tNE cell stage, hitherto unidentified in the mammalian neocortex. Interestingly, a transitioning NE cell type has been described in Drosophila optic primordia with features analogous to those we have observed in human and ape organoids ( Orihara-Ono et al., 2011 67. Orihara-Ono, M. ∙ Toriya, M. ∙ Nakao, K. ... Downregulation of Notch mediates the seamless transition of individual Drosophila neuroepithelial progenitors into optic medullar neuroblasts during prolonged G1 Dev. Biol. 2011; 351 :163-175 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the intriguing possibility that such a transition may be evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, the temporal progression of events and RNA-seq reveal a shift in cell morphology preceding other changes associated with RG identity, namely expression of glial markers and production of neurons. Previous findings have similarly revealed an important role for cell morphology during neurogenesis, but in the context of proliferating basal progenitors ( Kalebic et al., 2019 42. Kalebic, N. ∙ Gilardi, C. ∙ Stepien, B. ... Neocortical Expansion Due to Increased Proliferation of Basal Progenitors Is Linked to Changes in Their Morphology Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24 :535-550 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, cell shape may be a key initiator in general during these developmental transitions.
The protracted shift to the tNE morphotype in humans, coupled with a shorter cell cycle, is particularly intriguing with regard to human brain evolution, as it may explain the linear scaling of the human brain compared with apes ( Herculano-Houzel, 2009 36. Herculano-Houzel, S. The human brain in numbers: a linearly scaled-up primate brain Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2009; 3 :31 Crossref Scopus (1054) PubMed Google Scholar ). An evolutionary modification at such an early developmental stage would be expected to affect all subsequent steps of neurogenesis and lead to a proportional increase in all neuron types. Indeed, mathematical modeling reveals an expected increase in neurons, and staining for neurons even at early stages reveals increased numbers in human organoids ( Figure S2 A). Furthermore, cytoarchitecturally, this would be expected to lead not to a thickened cortical gray matter, but rather to a more expanded brain in the tangential dimension, which is precisely what is seen in comparative neuroanatomy to other apes ( Donahue et al., 2018 20.

Together, these findings reveal a mechanism for evolutionary human brain expansion, and highlight ZEB2 as a key regulator. ZEB2 was previously shown to be involved in early germ layer specification ( Chng et al., 2010 14. Chng, Z. ∙ Teo, A. ∙ Pedersen, R.A. ...

Complementary expression pattern of Zfhx1 genes Sip1 and deltaEF1 in the mouse embryo and their genetic interaction revealed by compound mutants Dev.

Regulation of trunk neural crest delamination by δEF1 and Sip1 in the chicken embryo Dev. Growth Differ. 2016; 58 :205-214 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the cortex specifically, ZEB2 has been shown to regulate the timing of cortical laminar fate determination ( Epifanova et al., 2019 22. Epifanova, E. ∙ Babaev, A. ∙ Newman, A.G. ...

ZEB2 ’s previous identification as the causative gene in Mowat-Wilson syndrome ( Mowat et al., 2003 63. Mowat, D.R. ∙ Wilson, M.J. ∙ Goossens, M. Mowat-Wilson syndrome J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40 :305-310 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ) further highlights its importance in human neurodevelopment. Interestingly, patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome also exhibit ventriculomegaly ( Garavelli et al., 2017 30. Garavelli, L. ∙ Ivanovski, I. ∙ Caraffi, S.G. ... Neuroimaging findings in Mowat-Wilson syndrome: a study of 54 patients Genet. Med. 2017; 19 :691-700 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ), or enlarged ventricles, a phenotype paralleled by the enlarged neuroepithelial buds seen in ZEB2 +/− organoids.
ZEB2 is also well-known as a key regulator of EMT ( Fardi et al., 2019 24. Fardi, M. ∙ Alivand, M. ∙ Baradaran, B. ... The crucial role of ZEB2: From development to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer complexity J. Cell. Physiol. 2019; 234 :14783-14799 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). In many respects, the NE-tNE-RG transition resembles a partial EMT process with a progressive change in cell morphology, apical constriction, and a reduction in cell-cell junctions ( Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019 71. Pastushenko, I. ∙ Blanpain, C. EMT Transition States during Tumor Progression and Metastasis Trends Cell Biol. 2019; 29 :212-226 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1765) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, apical constriction is the first morphological change associated with EMT in several tissues ( Gracia et al., 2019 33. Gracia, M. ∙ Theis, S. ∙ Proag, A. ... Mechanical impact of epithelial-mesenchymal transition on epithelial morphogenesis in Drosophila Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :2951 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saunders and McClay, 2014 85.

Williams, M. ∙ Burdsal, C. ∙ Periasamy, A. ... Mouse primitive streak forms in situ by initiation of epithelial to mesenchymal transition without migration of a cell population Dev. Dyn. 2012; 241 :270-283 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ), and changes in epithelial cell-cell junctions are linked to cytoskeletal changes ( Morris and Machesky, 2015 62. Morris, H.T. ∙ Machesky, L.M. Actin cytoskeletal control during epithelial to mesenchymal transition: focus on the pancreas and intestinal tract Br. J. Cancer. 2015; 112 :613-620 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ) with several reports having shown cross-regulation between ZEB2 and the actin cytoskeleton ( Wiles et al., 2013 96. Wiles, E.T. ∙ Bell, R. ∙ Thomas, D. ... ZEB2 Represses the Epithelial Phenotype and Facilitates Metastasis in Ewing Sarcoma Genes Cancer. 2013; 4 :486-500 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yuan et al., 2019 102.

SHROOM2 inhibits tumor metastasis through RhoA-ROCK pathway-dependent and -independent mechanisms in nasopharyngeal carcinoma Cell Death Dis. 2019; 10 :58 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings add to this and support a link between ZEB2 and cytoskeletal targets with SHROOM3 as a key player ( Chu et al., 2013 15. Chu, C.W. ∙ Gerstenzang, E. ∙ Ossipova, O. ... Lulu regulates Shroom-induced apical constriction during neural tube closure PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e81854 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Overall, our findings suggest that a relatively simple evolutionary change in cell shape, regulated by the fundamental process of EMT, can have major consequences in brain evolution.
This study was performed using neural organoids, and like all models, such organoids will never be a perfect representation of the actual brain in vivo . However, because it is impossible to perform experiments on living human or ape embryos, organoids represent an important tool for both comparative studies and functional interrogation. Nonetheless, further examination using in vivo approaches, such as transgenic mice, or even non-invasive imaging of ape embryos would be highly informative in the future.

One human ESC line (H9), one human iPSC line (iPS(IMR90)-4, shortened to IMR-90 in this study), one chimpanzee iPSC line (C3651, shortened to Chmp) and two gorilla iPSC lines (goiPSC clone 1 and gorC1, shortened to G1 and G2 respectively) were used in this study. All cell lines were female. H9 (WA09) and iPS(IMR90)-4 were purchased from WiCell. C3651 was a gift from Yoav Gilad ( Gallego Romero et al., 2015 29. Gallego Romero, I. ∙ Pavlovic, B.J. ∙ Hernando-Herraez, I. ... A panel of induced pluripotent stem cells from chimpanzees: a resource for comparative functional genomics eLife. 2015; 4 :e07103 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). goiPSC clone 1 was previously published ( Wunderlich et al., 2014 100.

We generated gorC1 using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from leftover blood collected from a female western lowland gorilla during a routine check-up at Twycross zoo. Briefly, PBMCs were isolated using Lymphoprep (Stem Cell Technologies, 07801), followed by expansion for 9 days in Expansion Media composed of Stemspan H3000 (Stem Cell Technologies, 09850) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma, A4403), 50 ng/ml SCF (Miltenyi, 130-096-692), 10 ng/ml IL-3 (Invitrogen, PHC0035), 2 U/ml EPO (R&D Systems, 287-TC-500), 40 ng/ml IGF-1 (Miltenyi, 130-093-885), 1 μM Dexamethasone (Sigma, D8893-1MG). On day 10, expanded PBMCs were transduced with non-integrating Sendai reprogramming virus (Cytotune 2.0, Thermo Fisher, A16517) according to manufacturer’s instructions added to the Expansion Media. The next day, the media was changed and two days later the cells were collected and plated on gamma irradiated MEF feeders (GIBCO, A34181) in human ES media (DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen, 11330-032) with 20% knockout serum replacement (Invitrogen, 10828-028), 1:100 Glutamax (Invitrogen 35050-038), 1:100 NEAA (Sigma, M7145), 3.5 μl/500ml 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 ng/ml bFGF (Peprotech, 100-18B)) supplemented with ascorbic acid, SCF, IL-3, EPO, IGF-1, and Dexamethasone at the above concentrations along with iPS Boost Supplements II (Millipore, SCM094). Two days later (5 days after induction), media was changed to human ES media without PBMC supplements but with Boost Supplements. Cells were maintained in hES + Boost until colonies began to form (10 days after induction). The small colonies were then split off MEFs 15 days after induction using collagenase and a cell lifter and replated on Matrigel (Corning) coated dishes in StemFlex (Thermo Fisher, A334901) for further selection and propagation. Human ESCs used in this project were approved for use in this project by the UK Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee and iPSCs and ESCs were approved by an ERC ethics committee and are registered on the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry (hpscreg.eu). Nonhuman primate cells were approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (AWERB) of the MRC-LMB. RT-PCR (refer to the ‘ PCR analysis’ section of the methods) confirmed pluripotent gene expression ( Figure S1 F). All cell lines were maintained in StemFlex on Matrigel coated plates. Cells were passaged every 3-4 days using 0.7 mM EDTA. HEK293 cells were a gift from Dr Harvey McMahon and were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher, 31966047) and 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher, 10270106) and passaged once a week using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher, 12563029).
Commercial cell lines (H9 and iPS(IMR90)-4) were authenticated by the provider. Nonhuman primate cells were not authenticated, but were established by the authors, apart from C3651.
All oligos used for cloning are listed in Table S1 . All PCR amplification steps were done using Q5 polymerase (NEB, M049L) and TOP10 chemically competent E. coli (Thermo Fisher, C404010) were used for transformation. In order to generate the construct pT2-CAG-fl-STOP-fl-fGFP, a fl-STOP-fl cassette was ligated into the pT2-CAG-fGFP (Addgene plasmid #108714) at EcoRI and Ascl restriction sites. The construct AAVS1-Puro-CAG-fl-STOP-fl-Cas9 was generated as follows; the backbone was amplified from the Puro-Cas9 donor plasmid (a gift from Dr Danwei Huangfu, Addgene plasmid #58409) ( González et al., 2014 31.

The resulting intermediate plasmid was then digested with MluI and KpnI and ligated to the cassette containing Cas9 and the bGH-poly(A) sequence amplified from pAAV-Neo_CAG-Cas9 (a gift from Dr Ludovic Vallier, Addgene plasmid #86698) ( Bertero et al., 2016 10.

Optimized inducible shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 platforms for in vitro studies of human development using hPSCs Development. 2016; 143 :4405-4418 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) with primers Cas9_β_globin_pA_F & R. All ligations to generate this construct were done with the Quick Ligation Kit (NEB, M2200S) and the final construct was sequence validated. The construct AAVS1-Neo-TRE-CMV-CRE-rtTA was generated as follows; the tight TRE promoter was amplified from the Puro-Cas9 donor plasmid (Addgene plasmid #58409) with primers TRE_F &R and inserted into the EcoRV restriction site of AAVS1-Neo-M2rtTA (a gift from Dr Rudolf Jaenisch, Addgene plasmid #60843) ( DeKelver et al., 2010 19. DeKelver, R.C. ∙ Choi, V.M. ∙ Moehle, E.A. ... Functional genomics, proteomics, and regulatory DNA analysis in isogenic settings using zinc finger nuclease-driven transgenesis into a safe harbor locus in the human genome Genome Res. 2010; 20 :1133-1142 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) to produce the intermediate construct AAVS1-Neo-M2rtTA-TRE. A fragment containing CMV-2TO-MCS-bGH-poly(A) was PCR amplified from pcDNA4/TO (Thermo Fisher, V102020) using primers CMV_bGH_F and _R, and inserted into the EcoRV restriction site of AAVS1-Neo-M2rtTA. The fragment comprised between the SalI and AleI restriction sites was replaced with the Cre recombinase cDNA amplified from pCAG-Cre (a gift from Dr Connie Cepko, Addgene plasmid #13775) ( Matsuda and Cepko, 2007 56. Matsuda, T. ∙ Cepko, C.L. Controlled expression of transgenes introduced by in vivo electroporation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :1027-1032 Crossref Scopus (505) PubMed Google Scholar ) using primers Cre_SalI_F and Cre_KpnI_R. From the resulting plasmid a fragment containing CRE-bGH-poly(A) was excised with restriction enzymes SalI (NEB, R3138S) and AleI (NEB, R0634) and inserted into AAVS1-Neo-M2rtTA-TRE digested with the same restriction enzymes. All ligations to generate this construct were done with the Quick Ligation Kit (NEB, M2200S). The final construct was sequence validated. The PX458-AAVS1 construct used to target the AAVS1 locus was generated by cloning the AAVS1_sgRNA sequence into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) (a gift from Dr Fang Zhang, Addgene plasmid #48138) as previously described by Ran et al. (2013) 81. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar . In order to generate the construct for inducible ZEB2 expression from the AAVS1 site the coding sequence of the human ZEB2 transcript variant 1 (NM_014795.3) was purchased as an ultimate ORF clone in the pENTRY221 (Thermo Scientific, #IOH53645). The ZEB2 ORF was amplified with primers ZEB2_IndOE_F & _R and tagged with GFP-Flag by Gibson assembly into the pT2-CAG-MCS-2A-Puro plasmid linearized by restriction digestion with EcoRI (NEB, R3101S) and AgeI (NEB, R3552S). The GFP fragment was amplified and C-terminally Flag-tagged using primers GFP_IndOE_F & R and the construct pT2-CAG-fGFP (Addgene plasmid #108714) as template. While the original design aimed to fuse ZEB2 to GFP via a 4x(GGGGS)-linker motif, Gibson assembly resulted in motif duplication and produced a 6x(GGGGS)-linker between the two coding sequences. The resulting plasmid, pT2-CAG-ZEB2-GFP-Flag-2A-Puro, was used as template in a PCR reaction with primers ZEB2_GFP_Flag_IndOE_F & _R. The resulting fragment encoding ZEB2-GFP-Flag was then digested with restriction enzymes AgeI (NEB, R3552S) and KpnI (NEB, R3142S) and ligated into the CAGs-MCS-Enhanced Episomal Vector (EEV) (System Biosciences, EEV600A-1) linearized with AgeI and KpnI, using T4 ligase. Next, using primers ZEB2_AAVS1 IndOE_F &_R a fragment containing ZEB2-GFP-Flag-WPRE-poly(A) and overhangs containing MluI and FseI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively, was generated. The construct AAVS1-Puro-CAG-fl-STOP-fl-Cas9 was linearized with MluI (NEB, R3198S) and FseI (NEB, R0588S) to remove the Cas9 coding sequence, which was then replaced with the fragment encoding ZEB2-GFP-Flag-WPRE-poly(A) by ligation with T4 ligase. The ZEB2 ORF was verified after every cloning step by sequencing using primers ZEB2_Seq_1-9. For simplicity, this overexpressing construct is referred to as ZEB2-GFP throughout the text. For CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of ZEB2 in Human ESCs guide RNAs were designed using the online tool from the lab of Feng Zhang and the sequences are listed in Table S1 as ZEB2 _ sgRNA_1 & _2. Cloning of the guides was performed as outlined by Ran et al. (2013) 81. Ran, F.A. ∙ Hsu, P.D. ∙ Wright, J. ... Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2281-2308 Crossref Scopus (7783) PubMed Google Scholar ; briefly, the sense and antisense strand oligos for ZEB2_sgRNA_1 & 2 were annealed and phosphorylated, and the duplexes were cloned into pSpCas9n (BB) (PX460) and pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) (a gift from Dr Fang Zhang, Addgene plasmid #48873 and #48138, respectively) by BbsI (NEB,R3539S) digestion and ligation with T4 ligase. Colonies were sequence validated using the U6_F primer.
For establishment of the H9 ZEB2 +/− line, plasmids pSpCas9n(BB)- ZEB2 -Guide-A &-B (0.5 μg of each plasmid) were electroporated into 1x10 6 H9 cells using the Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 (Lonza, VPH-5012). Following electroporation, cells were grown in one well of a 24-well plate, reduced to a single-cell suspension and seeded into a 96-well plate at a density ranging between 1000 – 20 c/w in mTesR™1 supplemented with 1 nM ROCK inhibitor (BD Biosciences, 562822). Alternatively, cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 c/w in StemFlex supplemented with RevitaCell supplement (Thermo Fisher, A2644501). Once the cells reached ∼80% confluence the 96-well plate was split to two replica plates, one used for screening by ddPCR and the other used for further expansion. Mutant screening relied on a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) drop-off assay ( Findlay et al., 2016 27. Findlay, S.D. ∙ Vincent, K.M. ∙ Berman, J.R. ... A digital pcr-based method for efficient and highly specific screening of genome edited cells PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0153901 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Screening was performed as described in the ‘ Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)’ section of the methods. The mutant colonies were characterized by sequencing following cloning of the edit-sites into the pJET1.2 vector (using primers ZEB2_Cas9screening_F & _R), PCR followed by DNA-PAGE (using primers ZEB2_DNAPAGE_ F & _R), karyotype analyses (outsourced to Cell Guidance Systems) and RT-PCR of pluripotency markers (details in the ‘PCR analysis’ section of the methods).
For establishment of the H9 doxycycline-inducible ZEB2 line (shortened to Hum iZEB2 ) and the ZEB2 +/− ; iZEB2 rescue line, plasmids AAVS1-Neo-TRE-CMV-Cre-rtTA (2 μg), AAVS1-Puro-CAG-fl-STOP-fl-ZEB2-GFP-Flag-WPRE-poly(A) (2 μg) and PX458-AAVS1 (3 μg) were electroporated into 1.3x10 6 H9 cells or H9 ZEB2 +/− cells using the Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 (Lonza, VPH-5012). Following electroporation the cells were seeded across 3-wells of a 6 well plate coated with Matrigel in StemFlex supplemented with RevitaCell supplement (Thermo Fisher, A2644501). After 3 days from electroporation the cells were selected with StemFlex supplemented with G418 (25 μg/ml) and Puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). After approximately two weeks in selection medium, single colonies were picked and screened using three primers pair combinations; AAVS1_F & _R (AMP_1 in Figure S6 ), AAVS1_F & Puro_R (AMP_2 in Figure S6 ), AAVS1_F & Neo_R (AMP_3 in Figure S6 ), listed in Table S1 . Individual colonies of the Hum iZEB2 were tested for ZEB2-GFP transgene induction by western blot and immunofluorescence following treatment with StemFlex supplemented with 1.7 μg/ml Doxycyline for 6 days.
Cerebral organoids with telencephalic identity from human and ape cells (all female) were generated using a previously described modified protocol ( Lancaster et al., 2017 48. Lancaster, M.A. ∙ Corsini, N.S. ∙ Wolfinger, S. ... Guided self-organization and cortical plate formation in human brain organoids Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35 :659-666 Crossref Scopus (531) PubMed Google Scholar ) to generate EBs with increased surface area:volume either through the use of fibrous microscaffolds or fewer cell numbers to generate smaller EBs. For the smaller EB approach, Aggrewell 800 plates (StemCell Technologies, 34815) containing 300 microwells, each 800 μm in size, per well were used to reproducibly generate organoids in multiples of 300. Following previously described directions for EB generation in Aggrewell plates (StemCell Technologies Document #DX21397), 6 × 10 5 cells in 1.5 mL media were plated per well, i.e., 2,000 cells per EB. STEMdiff Cerebral Organoid Kit (StemCell Technologies, 08570) was used for organoid culture, with the addition of 1:1000 Fungizone and 1:100 Penicillin-streptomycin to avoid contamination risk associated with repeated plate usage. The timing of the protocol (StemCell Technologies Document #DX21849) was followed, with the exception of chimpanzee EBs being moved to neural induction media 2 days earlier than described. Organoids were fed every 2 days during the Aggrewell period prior to Matrigel embedding, using an electronic pipette set to the slowest speed in order to avoid flushing EBs out of microwells. Matrigel embedding was based on a previously described method ( Qian et al., 2018 75. Qian, X. ∙ Jacob, F. ∙ Song, M.M. ... Generation of human brain region-specific organoids using a miniaturized spinning bioreactor Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :565-580 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, organoids were removed from their well, resuspended in 300 μL Expansion media and split into 3 tubes where 150 μL Matrigel was added resulting in a 3:2 Matrigel dilution. The contents of each tube were then spread into a well of an ultra-low attachment 24-well plate (Corning, 7524). After a 30-minute incubation at 37°C, 1 mL expansion media was added per well. The fibrous microscaffold approach and in-house media was used to generate ZEB2 +/− , ZEB2 +/− ; iZEB2 , and control. All comparisons between samples and treatments were performed on organoids generated using identical protocols.
To achieve sparse labeling of neural progenitor cells, 5 μL CytoTune emGFP Sendai fluorescence reporter (Thermo Fisher, A16519) was added to Aggrewells when the organoids were switched to neural induction medium. For ZEB2 overexpression, organoids generated from the H9 doxycycline-inducible ZEB2 (Hum iZEB2 ) cell line were treated with 1.7 μg/ml doxycycline (Merck, PHR1145) during the first 5 days of the protocol. For ZEB2 rescue, ZEB2 +/− ;iZEB2 organoids were treated with 1.7 μg/ml doxycycline from day 2 until day 7. For the pharmacological rescue of ZEB2 +/− organoids, starting from day 2, after embedding, ZEB2 +/− and WT control organoids were treated with 0.5 μg/ml Noggin (R&D, 6057-NG) and 10 μM SB-431542 (R&D, 1614) for 10 days and samples were collected for biochemical and histological analysis on day 12. For treatment with LPA, 3 μM LPA (Tocris, 325465-93-8) was added to the media of aggrewell organoids 1 day after Matrigel-embedding (3 days post neural induction, using the STEMdiff Cerebral Organoid Kit). Media was changed 2x daily, as previous studies have reported that LPA activity in culture medium decreases after 10 hours ( Medelnik et al., 2018 58. Medelnik, J.P. ∙ Roensch, K. ∙ Okawa, S. ... Signaling-Dependent Control of Apical Membrane Size and Self-Renewal in Rosette-Stage Human Neuroepithelial Stem Cells Stem Cell Reports. 2018; 10 :1751-1765 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), and organoids were fixed for analysis after 48 hours of treatment (5 days post neural induction). For treatment with BMP4, 500ng/ml BMP4 (R&D, 314-BP) was added to the media of aggrewell organoids 1 day post neural induction and media was changed daily until organoids were fixed for analysis on day 5 post neural induction.
Organoids were fixed in 4% PFA either overnight at 4°C or at room temperature for 20-60 min, and washed in PBS (3x10 min). Samples for cryostat processing were incubated overnight in 30% sucrose in 0.2 M PB (21.8 g/l Na 2 HPO 4 , 6.4 g/l NaH 2 PO4 in dH 2 O), embedded in gelatin (7.5% gelatin, 10% sucrose in 0.2 M PB), plunge frozen in 2-methylbutane (Sigma-Aldrich, M32631) at ∼-40°C for 1-2 minutes and cryosectioned at a thickness of 20 μm. Both sectioned and whole mount samples were stained as previously described ( Lancaster et al., 2013 49. Lancaster, M.A. ∙ Renner, M. ∙ Martin, C.A. ... Cerebral organoids model human brain development and microcephaly Nature. 2013; 501 :373-379 Crossref Scopus (3474) PubMed Google Scholar ). For histological analysis, sections were stained for hematoxylin and eosin (Carl Roth, 9194.1) followed by dehydration in ethanol and xylene and mounting in permount mounting media.
Confocal images of fixed cryosectioned samples were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 780 or 880 confocal microscope. Images of fixed whole mount samples were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope or a Nikon CSU-W1 spinning disk microscope. Whole mount organoids were imaged at 8 μm intervals on Zeiss LSM 780 while the speed of the Nikon CSU-W1 system allowed for higher resolution imaging at 0.5 μm intervals. To calculate the apical luminal surface area of organoids, folders containing Zeiss LSM 780 Z stacks of ZO1 stained organoids as an image stack were carried over to MATLAB (Mathworks). The largest lumen per organoids was segmented using a tailor-made code that delineates the perimeter of the lumen in each Z stack by detecting fluorescent intensity and then combines the delineated perimeters into a 3D structure from which the surface area is calculated. This code is publicly available ( https://github.com/esriis/organoid-lumen-segmentation ). The apical surface area of individual cells was measured from cryosections of organoids where cells were selected based on SOX2+ staining and sectioning angle being at the apical surface of progenitors. ZO1 stain was used as a marker of apical cell perimeters and Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 86. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (39955) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to manually delineate perimeters and perform apical surface area measurements. Because of differences in tissue shrinkage during PFA fixation and handling, comparisons were performed with controls fixed and stained at the same time and treated identically. TBR2 positive cells ( Figure S6 T) were counted using a FIJI plug-in generated by Johannes Schindelin. For quantification of TBR2+ cell numbers per unit area in ZEB2-rescue and day 55 organoids, a custom Fiji macro was used to count the number of TBR2+ cells, this was then divided by the corresponding area. This macro is publicly available ( https://github.com/StefanoLG92/FIJI-macros ). Distance of nuclei as a percentage of VZ length was performed in Fiji on cryosections of organoids stained with DAPI and ZO1, where ZO1 staining indicated the sectioning angle was perpendicular to the apical surface of neuroepithelial tissue. The distance from the ZO1+ apical surface to the center of nuclei was measured and reported as a percentage of the total apico-basal thickness of the neuroepithelial tissue. Total thickness was measured from ZO1+ apical surface to the basal surface as determined by background low-level fluorescence from the tissue (average of 3 total thickness measurements). To segment and quantify apical processes of individual neural progenitor cells, the surfaces option in Imaris (Oxford Instruments, v9.2) was used to manually segment virally-labeled GFP+ cells that were clearly separated from neighboring labeled cells using images of whole mount organoids obtained on a Nikon CSU-W1 spinning disk microscope. To capture differences in apical process thickness, apical process volumes were derived by cutting segmented cells apical to the cell body (‘cut surface’ in Imaris) and obtaining the volume of the isolated apical processes in Imaris. Because volume can be influenced by topology (i.e., curvature, length), in ways that do not necessarily reflect thickness (diameter), we normalized volume measurements to surface area to account for these topological effects.
For quantification of organoid size and neuroepithelial bud perimeter, brightfield images of live organoids were taken on an EVOS (Thermo Fisher, AMF4300). Organoid area was measured by manually delineating the perimeter of individual organoids in Fiji and measuring the area within these structures. Neuroepithelial bud perimeters were obtained by manually delineating the visible basal surface of neuroepithelial buds projecting from the main organoid mass and measuring their lengths.
Cell and organoid samples were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation (500 g, 3 min) and lysed with modified-RIPA (mRIPA: 1% Triton-X, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 12 mM sodium deoxycholate) supplemented immediately prior to lysis with protease (Thermo Fisher, 78430) and phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich, 4906845001) inhibitors. The protein concentration of the samples was measured using the Quick Start Bradford Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad, 5000205). Between 3-20 μg of total protein per sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4%–20% gels) and transferred to Amersham Hybond P 0.45 PVDF blotting membranes (GE Healthcare, 10600023). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C in 5% milk or 5% BSA in PBST. Specific blocking conditions were optimized for each antibody during the initial validation stages. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit (Dako, P0448, 1:3000) and rabbit anti-mouse (Dako. P0161, 1:3000) secondary antibodies were incubated for ∼1 hr at room temperature. The blots were developed using ECL Prime enhanced chemoluminescent detection reagent (GE Healthcare, RPN2232) or alternatively SuperSignal West Femto chemoluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher, 34094) and X-ray films (Photon Imaging Systems Ltd, FM024) and developer or a Gel Doc XR + system.
Primary antibodies used for protein detection, with their corresponding dilutions for immunofluorescence (IF), western blotting (WB) and WB blocking conditions were as follows: mouse anti-β-actin (Abcam, 8226, WB 1:2000 in BSA), mouse anti-ZEB2 (Origene, TA802113, IF 1:150, WB 1:2000 in milk), sheep anti-TBR2 (R&D Systems, AF6166, IF 1:200), mouse anti-CDH2 (BD Biosciences, 610920, IF 1:500, WB 1:1000 in milk), mouse anti-CDH1 (BD Biosciences, 610181, IF 1:500, 1:1000 in milk), rabbit anti-OCLN (Abcam, ab31721, IF 1:200, WB 1:1000 in milk), rabbit anti-EMX1 (ATLAS Antibodies, HPA006421, IF 1:100), rabbit anti-EMX1 (Origene, TA325087, WB 1:1000 in BSA), rabbit anti-BLBP (Abcam, ab32423, IF 1:200), rabbit anti-GLAST (Abcam, ab416, IF 1:200), goat anti-DCX (N-19) (Santa Cruz, sc-8067, IF 1:300), rat anti-CTIP2 (Abcam, ab18465, IF 1:200), mouse anti-HuC/D (Life Technologies, A21271, IF 1:200), mouse anti-ZO1 (BD Biosciences, 610966, IF 1:300), chicken anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher, A10262, IF 1:500), rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam, ab290, WB 1:1000 in milk), rabbit anti-EpCAM (Abcam, ab71916, IF 1:300, WB 1:1000 in milk), mouse anti-Vimentin (V9) (Santa Cruz, sc-6260, IF 1:200, WB 1:1000 in BSA) rabbit anti-PAX6 (Abcam, ab195045, IF 1:200), rabbit anti-SOX2 (Abcam, ab97959, IF 1:200), rabbit anti-SHROOM3 (ATLAS Antibodies, HPA047784, IF 1:200, WB 1:1000), mouse anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245, WB 1:2000 in milk), mouse anti-TUJ1 (Biolegend, 801213, IF 1:500). Alexa Fluor 594 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher, A12380, 1:400) was used to detect F-actin. Alexafluor 405, 488, 568 and 647 secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher) were used for detection of primary antibodies in IF.
For applications aimed at amplicon size comparison GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, 9PIM712) was used according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. For molecular cloning or any other application requiring high sequence fidelity Q5 High Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB, M0492S) was used. PCR analysis of pluripotency markers was done using the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Assessment Primer Pair Panel (R&D Systems, SC012) and amplification was done using GoTaq Green. Novex TBE 10% gels (Thermo Fisher, EC6275BOX) were used for DNA-PAGE analysis of ZEB2 +/− mutant gDNA. The primers used were ZEB2_DNAPAGE_F & R ( Table S1 ), GoTaq green was used for amplification and 1X SYBR Gold Nuclei Acid Stain (Thermo Scientific, S11494) was used for detection. Samples were prepared as outlined in the PAGE gels technical sheet.
In order to detect CRISPR mutants and perform enrichment by sib-selection a TaqMan-based ddPCR drop-off assay was designed ( Findlay et al., 2016 27. Findlay, S.D. ∙ Vincent, K.M. ∙ Berman, J.R. ... A digital pcr-based method for efficient and highly specific screening of genome edited cells PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 :e0153901 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). An amplicon of 198 bp overlapping the edited genomic region (GRCh38/hg38 chr2:144,517,275-144,517,351) was produced using primers ZEB2_Cas9screening_F & R. The assay was designed so as to have a 5′-HEX-labeled 3′-BHQ1 probe binding to a nick site (i.e., ZEB2_drop-off_probe) and a 5′-FAM-labeled 3′-BHQ1 probe binding to both edited and WT amplicons (i.e., ZEB2_reference_probe). The specific sequence of primers and probes used in the assay are listed in Table S1 . The assay was performed using the ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad, 1863024) as described in the product’s technical bulletin. Briefly, reaction mixes (20 μl/reaction) were prepared as follows: 100 nM primers, 200 nM probes, 10 U MseI (NEB, R0525S), 1x ddPCR supermix for probes and 50-300 ng of genomic DNA (gDNA). The reactions were loaded into DG8 cartridges (Bio-Rad, 1864008) with droplet generation oil for probes (Bio-Rad, 1863005), the cartridge was then fitted with the DG8 gaskets (Bio-Rad, 1863009) and run on the QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, 10031907). The droplet-oil emulsions were transferred to a ddPCR-compatible 96-well plate that was sealed with the PX1 PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad) and the PCR reaction was run on a C1000 touch thermal cycler following the PCR protocol detailed in the technical bulletin. After thermal cycling, data were acquired on the QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) using the QuantaSoft Software (Bio-Rad). Negative and positive control samples for the assay were gDNA extracts from HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP- ZEB2- guide-A & -B, respectively.
Organoids generated from 3 replicate batches of H9 and G1 cell lines were collected at 7 time points for RNA-seq analysis: 0, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 25 days post neural induction. ∼300 organoids per replicate were collected at the time points ranging between day 0 and 5, ∼150 organoids at day 10, ∼100 organoids at day 15, and ∼50 organoids at day 20. Organoids were collected in Eppendorf tubes, washed with PBS, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
RNA from all 42 samples was isolated in parallel with the Direct-zol-96 RNA kit (Zymo Research, R2055), following the product’s manual. cDNA libraries were generated according to NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7760). cDNA was amplified for 12 cycles and barcoded with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (NEB E7600). Libraries were tested for quality using the 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent) and concentrations were measured using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher, Q32851) on Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher). Samples were pooled together to 15 nM concentration and sequenced with single-end 50 base mode on 3 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument.
RNA-seq reads were processed using the PRAGUI pipeline ( https://github.com/lmb-seq/PRAGUI ). Reads were trimmed using Trim Galore! version 0.6.3_dev ( Krueger, 2012 46. Krueger, F. Trim Galore! v0.4.0 2012 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ Google Scholar ) ( https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore ) with Cutadapt version 2.4 ( Martin, 2011 55. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10 Crossref Google Scholar ). Default parameters were used. Read quality was analyzed by FASTQC version v0.11.5 ( Andrews, 2010 6. Andrews, S. FastQC: a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data 2010 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc Google Scholar ). Human and gorilla reads were aligned to GRCh38 and Kamilah_GGO_v0 reference genomes respectively using HISAT2 v2.0.0-beta ( Kim et al., 2015 44. Kim, D. ∙ Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. HISAT: a fast spliced aligner with low memory requirements Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :357-360 Crossref Scopus (13753) PubMed Google Scholar ). GTF gene annotation files for both of the reference genomes were downloaded and filtered for a list of 16,763 genes that are annotated with identical gene names in both species. Reads were assigned to genes in the custom GTF files and counted using HTSeq version 0.11.2 ( Anders et al., 2015 4. Anders, S. ∙ Pyl, P.T. ∙ Huber, W. HTSeq--a Python framework to work with high-throughput sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :166-169 Crossref Scopus (13500) PubMed Google Scholar ). Read counts were then normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) within each sample and log2 transformed (log2(TPM+1)). Unbiased clustering of the samples with principal component analysis was performed using the 3000 most variable genes. Log2 transformed TPM values were converted to z-scores, (x i – μ)/σ, where x i is the TPM at a given time point, μ is the mean TPM of the gene across all time points and σ is the standard deviation of the TPM across all time points. Pearson correlation was performed on z-scaled mean log2 transformed TPM and on all replicates z-scaled. Hierarchical clustering was done on z-scaled means of the 3000 most variable genes of mean log2 transformed TPMs. GO term enrichment analysis was performed using the online g:Profiler software ( Reimand et al., 2007 82. Reimand, J. ∙ Kull, M. ∙ Peterson, H. ... g:Profiler--a web-based toolset for functional profiling of gene lists from large-scale experiments Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :W193-200 Crossref Scopus (887) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost ).
RNA-seq analysis was performed using R v3.5.3 ( R Core Team, 2018 77. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2018 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ). To assess temporal changes in gene expression between day 3, 5 and 10, the list of 16,763 genes was first filtered based on the following criteria: 1) genes were expressed at > 10 TPM in at least one time point in all replicates of both species, 2) genes displayed a fold-change of > 1.5 TPM between any two time points in at least one species. This resulted in a list of 3,526 genes. Log2 normalized TPMs were then z-scaled across the three time points. Next, the gene list was further filtered in order to remove genes with variable expression patterns across replicates by removing genes with a squared difference > 6 in either species. The squared difference value was obtained by calculating the squared difference of z-scores per time point between all three replicates and then taking the sum of this number for all time points. This list of 2,905 genes was used for time course sequencing data analysis using the TCseq package ( Wu and Gu, 2020 99. Wu, M. ∙ Gu, L. TCseq: Time course sequencing data analysis. R package version 1.12.0 2020 https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TCseq.html Google Scholar ) available online ( https://rdrr.io/bioc/TCseq/f/inst/doc/TCseq.pdf ). Replicates were kept separate for the analysis, meaning that the input was 17,430 unique patterns of gene expression representing 2,905 genes in 2 species and 3 replicates per species. The TCSeq analysis was run using the timeclust function with the settings algo = ‘cm’, k = 10 , resulting in the unsupervised soft clustering of gene expression patterns into 10 clusters with similar z-scaled temporal patterns. Replicates of 563 genes were found to be in 3 different clusters in at least one species and were removed from downstream analysis resulting in 2,342 genes ( Data S1 ). 22.5% of genes, 527 genes, were found to never be in the same cluster between species showing a robustly different expression pattern ( Data S1 ). Genes were assigned to the cluster where 2 or all of the replicates were found per species. 59% of genes were assigned to different clusters between species. GO term enrichment analysis was performed on the genes present in each of the 10 clusters generated by TCseq per species, resulting in a total of 159 GO:BP terms found in both species, of which 85 were found to be moving between species (Data S1). GO term analysis on the 527 genes moving robustly between species revealed 67 were linked to enriched cell morphogenesis-related terms (“cell morphogenesis,” “cell part morphogenesis,” “cellular component morphogenesis”). These genes were intersected with a list of 1,639 confirmed transcription factors ( Lambert et al., 2018 47. Lambert, S.A. ∙ Jolma, A. ∙ Campitelli, L.F. ... The Human Transcription Factors Cell. 2018; 172 :650-665 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1603) PubMed Google Scholar ), revealing 8 transcription factors related to cell morphogenesis ( Figure 5 F).
For live imaging, a SiMView light sheet microscope was primarily used in addition to an Andor Revolution spinning disk microscope. Whole organoids were imaged on a SiMView light-sheet microscope with environmental controls as described in McDole et al. (2018 57. McDole, K. ∙ Guignard, L. ∙ Amat, F. ... In Toto Imaging and Reconstruction of Post-Implantation Mouse Development at the Single-Cell Level Cell. 2018; 175 :859-876.e33 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, organoids were embedded in Matrigel inside of a glass capillary or placed on a cylindrical PEEK platform and either extruded into or placed inside a Teflon FEP tube (Zeus, Inc.) filled with expansion media. This was then placed inside the imaging chamber, which was kept at 37°C and 5% CO2 in atmosphere using an Okolab Bold line environmental system. Culture media was exchanged for fresh media every 24 hours. Image stacks were acquired using a 488 nm laser every 5 minutes with 2.031 μm z-spacing using two Nikon 16x 0.8 NA water-dipping objectives for detection and two Special Optics 54-12.5-31 @ 450-1000nm 6.45x 0.2NA illumination objectives. Images were collected by two Hamamatsu Orca Fusion cameras. Acquired images were then processed according to previously described methods ( Amat et al., 2015 3. Amat, F. ∙ Höckendorf, B. ∙ Wan, Y. ... Efficient processing and analysis of large-scale light-sheet microscopy data Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 :1679-1696 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ; McDole et al., 2018 57. McDole, K. ∙ Guignard, L. ∙ Amat, F. ... In Toto Imaging and Reconstruction of Post-Implantation Mouse Development at the Single-Cell Level Cell. 2018; 175 :859-876.e33 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). For analysis of cell cycle duration, individual cells were tracked manually using the MaMuT plugin in Fiji ( Wolff et al., 2018 98. Wolff, C. ∙ Tinevez, J.Y. ∙ Pietzsch, T. ... Multi-view light-sheet imaging and tracking with the MaMuT software reveals the cell lineage of a direct developing arthropod limb eLife. 2018; 7 :e34410 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the cell-cycle calculated as the time period between two divisions. For imaging on the Andor Revolution spinning disk microscope, organoids were placed on an imaging dish (2BScientific, 6160-30) and were held in place by a drop of Matrigel that was allowed to polymerize at 37°C before addition of expansion media. Single cells were selected as the focal point and a images were acquired at 4% laser power every 20 minutes and stacked at 2 μm intervals in an incubation chamber set to 37°C and 5% CO 2 between day 3 and 5 post neural induction.
Mathematical modeling of progenitor growth used a standard growth curve equation: 𝑝 𝑡 = 𝑝 𝑡 − 1 ⁢ 2 𝑓 where 𝑝 𝑡 is the number of progenitors at time 𝑡 in days, and 𝑓 is the number of divisions in 1 day. This equation was applied to calculate the number of progenitors in human and gorilla using arbitrary time length and starting cell number. There were certain assumptions governing the shape of the curves, but these assumptions were applied equally to both the human and gorilla. These assumptions were: 1. Divisions were symmetric expansive for the first half of the time period, with 𝑓 being higher early and lower at later time points. 2. During the second half of the time period, divisions were increasingly asymmetric neurogenic, where proportions of symmetric to asymmetric were taken from in vivo measurements ( Noctor et al., 2008 64. Noctor, S.C. ∙ Martínez-Cerdeño, V. ∙ Kriegstein, A.R. Distinct behaviors of neural stem and progenitor cells underlie cortical neurogenesis J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 508 :28-44 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because of the second assumption, during the second half of the time period, the growth curve was modified as follows: 𝑝 𝑡 = ( 𝑝 𝑡 − 1 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑎 ) + ( 𝑝 𝑡 − 1 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑠 ⁢ 2 𝑓 ) where 𝑟 𝑎 is the ratio of divisions that are asymmetric at time 𝑡 and 𝑟 𝑠 is the ratio of divisions that are symmetric at time 𝑡 .
Number of neurons was calculated from the progenitor number at each time point according to the following equation: 𝑛 𝑡 = 𝑛 𝑡 − 1 + ( 𝑝 𝑡 − 1 ⁢ 𝑟 𝑎 ) where 𝑛 𝑡 is the number of neurons at time 𝑡 in days, and 𝑝 𝑡 − 1 is the number of progenitors at 𝑡 − 1 as calculated above.
The only difference between human and gorilla models was an increased 𝑓 in human for a period of 5 days during the symmetric expansive phase, which was the length of time in which human and gorilla exhibited differences in their cell morphology (day 3 to day 8, Figure 3 B). During this time period, 𝑓 ℎ ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑛 was equal to 1.274, calculated from the measured average cell cycle length of 18.831 hours, while 𝑓 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 was equal to 1.086, calculated from the measured average cell cycle length of 22.099.
Overall, the model revealed an increase in human of 1.9 fold in both 𝑝 𝑡 and 𝑛 𝑡 , which was consistent and independent of the arbitrary values otherwise used to generate the growth curves.
All biological experiments were performed with multiple independent biological samples as detailed in the figure legends. Numbers of samples are detailed in figure legends for each quantification performed, including numbers of cells, organoids, and batches for each cell line. Statistical test details can be found in the figure legends. For comparisons across multiple samples, multiple comparisons corrections were applied as detailed in figure legends. Statistics were performed and graphs were generated in Prism v8.4.2 (Graphpad).
