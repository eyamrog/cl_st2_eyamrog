Title: In vivo CD8 + T cell CRISPR screening reveals control by Fli1 in infection and cancer


Abstract: Summary

Improving effector activity of antigen-specific T cells is a major goal in cancer immunotherapy. Despite the identification of several effector T cell (T EFF )-driving transcription factors (TFs), the transcriptional coordination of T EFF biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR screening platform and identified a key mechanism restraining T EFF biology through the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced T EFF responses without compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained T EFF lineage differentiation by binding to cis -regulatory elements of effector-associated genes. Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs, allowing more efficient Runx3-driven T EFF biology. CD8 + T cells lacking Fli1 provided substantially better protection against multiple infections and tumors. These data indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing CD8 + T cell transcriptional landscape from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven T EFF cell differentiation. Moreover, genetic deletion of Fli1 improves T EFF differentiation and protective immunity in infections and cancer.

Section: Introduction

Understanding the mechanisms that regulate effector CD8 + T cell (T EFF ) differentiation is crucial to improve therapeutic approaches for cancer and other diseases. Activation of naive CD8 + T cells (T N ) during acutely resolved infections or following vaccination results in differentiation into T EFF cells accompanied by transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling. After antigen clearance, a terminally differentiated subset of T EFF cells dies over the ensuing days to weeks, while a small proportion of memory precursors (T MP ) differentiates into long-term memory CD8 + T cells (T MEM ) ( Kaech and Cui, 2012 32. Kaech, S.M. ∙ Cui, W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :749-761 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ). During chronic infections and cancers, however, CD8 + T cell differentiation is diverted down a path of exhaustion. Under these conditions, T EFF cells become over-stimulated and persist poorly ( Angelosanto et al., 2012 2. Angelosanto, J.M. ∙ Blackburn, S.D. ∙ Crawford, A. ...

T EX cells have high expression of multiple inhibitory receptors including PD-1, decreased effector functions, altered homeostatic regulation compared to T MEM cells, and a distinct transcriptional and epigenetic program ( Wherry and Kurachi, 2015 94. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Kurachi, M. Molecular and cellular insights into T cell exhaustion Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :486-499 Crossref Scopus (1373) PubMed Google Scholar ). Blocking inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 can reinvigorate T EX temporarily restoring proliferation and some effector-like properties ( Barber et al., 2006 5.

Topalian, S.L. ∙ Drake, C.G. ∙ Pardoll, D.M. Immune checkpoint blockade: a common denominator approach to cancer therapy Cancer Cell. 2015; 27 :450-461 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1845) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite the success of checkpoint blockade, however, most patients do not achieve durable clinical benefit ( Sun et al., 2018 83. Sun, C. ∙ Mezzadra, R. ∙ Schumacher, T.N. Regulation and Function of the PD-L1 Checkpoint Immunity. 2018; 48 :434-452 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (945) PubMed Google Scholar ), and there is a great need to augment T cell differentiation and effector-like activity following checkpoint blockade or during cellular therapies in cancer or other diseases.
There has been considerable interest in defining the populations of T cells responding to checkpoint blockade ( Ribas and Wolchok, 2018 68. Ribas, A. ∙ Wolchok, J.D.

Brown, C.E. ∙ Mackall, C.L. CAR T cell therapy: inroads to response and resistance Nature Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :73-74 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). T EX cells are prominent in human tumors and likely represent a major source of tumor reactive T cells ( Duhen et al., 2018 20. Duhen, T. ∙ Duhen, R. ∙ Montler, R. ...

Bystander CD8+ T cells are abundant and phenotypically distinct in human tumour infiltrates Nature. 2018; 557 :575-579 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). PD-1 pathway blockade mediates clinical benefit, at least in part, due to reinvigoration of T EX cells allowing these cells to re-access parts of the T EFF cell program ( Huang et al., 2017 27. Huang, A.C. ∙ Postow, M.A. ∙ Orlowski, R.J. ...

Epigenetic stability of exhausted T cells limits durability of reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade Science. 2016; 354 :1160-1165 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, limited therapeutic efficacy is associated with suboptimal reinvigoration of T EX cells ( Huang et al., 2017 27. Huang, A.C. ∙ Postow, M.A. ∙ Orlowski, R.J. ... T-cell invigoration to tumour burden ratio associated with anti-PD-1 response Nature. 2017; 545 :60-65 Crossref Scopus (593) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 28. Huang, A.C. ∙ Orlowski, R.J. ∙ Xu, X. ...

Chen, J. ∙ López-Moyado, I.F. ∙ Seo, H. ... NR4A transcription factors limit CAR T cell function in solid tumours Nature. 2019; 567 :530-534 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fraietta et al., 2018 21.

Med. 2018; 24 :563-571 Crossref Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ), and approaches that antagonize exhaustion are actively being investigated ( Long et al., 2015 47. Long, A.H. ∙ Haso, W.M. ∙ Shern, J.F. ... 4-1BB costimulation ameliorates T cell exhaustion induced by tonic signaling of chimeric antigen receptors Nat.

Wei, J. ∙ Long, L. ∙ Zheng, W. ... Targeting REGNASE-1 programs long-lived effector T cells for cancer therapy Nature. 2019; 576 :471-476 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a key to both response to checkpoint blockade and cellular therapies to control cancer is the ability to effectively engage a robust effector program, including numerical expansion and elicitation of effector activity. Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms that control this effector activity is needed to effectively design therapeutic interventions for chronic infections and cancer.
The role of transcription factors (TFs) in regulating differentiation of T EFF versus T MEM or T EX has received considerable attention ( Kaech and Cui, 2012 32. Kaech, S.M. ∙ Cui, W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :749-761 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wherry and Kurachi, 2015 94. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Kurachi, M. Molecular and cellular insights into T cell exhaustion Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15 :486-499 Crossref Scopus (1373) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, the TFs Batf and Irf4 have an early role in T cell activation and also induce the second wave of transcriptional induction of effector genes ( Kurachi et al., 2014 38. Kurachi, M. ∙ Barnitz, R.A. ∙ Yosef, N. ... The transcription factor BATF operates as an essential differentiation checkpoint in early effector CD8+ T cells Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 :373-383 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ; Man et al., 2013 50. Man, K. ∙ Miasari, M. ∙ Shi, W. ... The transcription factor IRF4 is essential for TCR affinity–mediated metabolic programming and clonal expansion of T cells Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14 :1155-1165 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Runx3 induces T EFF gene expression through T-bet and Eomes ( Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009 17. Cruz-Guilloty, F. ∙ Pipkin, M.E. ∙ Djuretic, I.M. ... Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :51-59 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is important for the tissue resident memory CD8 + T cells (T RM ) ( Milner et al., 2017 57. Milner, J.J. ∙ Toma, C. ∙ Yu, B. ... Runx3 programs CD8+ T cell residency in non-lymphoid tissues and tumours Nature. 2017; 552 :253-257 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). Runx3 also antagonizes a follicular-like CD8 + T cell fate by inhibiting TCF-1 expression ( Shan et al., 2017 74. Shan, Q. ∙ Zeng, Z. ∙ Xing, S. ... The transcription factor Runx3 guards cytotoxic CD8+ effector T cells against deviation towards follicular helper T cell lineage Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18 :931-939 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Runx1, in contrast, is antagonized by Runx3 during T EFF differentiation ( Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009 17. Cruz-Guilloty, F. ∙ Pipkin, M.E. ∙ Djuretic, I.M. ... Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :51-59 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most T EFF -associated genes and their cognate cis -regulatory regions are inaccessible in the T N state linking the role of effector-driving TFs to chromatin accessibility changes that occur during the T N to T EFF transition. Indeed, there is evidence that some of these early operating TFs, such as Batf, may contribute to T EFF gene accessibility through chromatin remodeling ( Pham et al., 2019 61. Pham, D. ∙ Moseley, C.E. ∙ Gao, M. ... Batf Pioneers the Reorganization of Chromatin in Developing Effector T Cells via Ets1-Dependent Recruitment of Ctcf Cell Rep. 2019; 29 :1203-1220.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9) PubMed Google Scholar ), but other mechanisms of control remain to be defined.
In addition to TF that foster T EFF formation, opposing mechanisms temper complete commitment to effector differentiation to preserve more durable T cell populations for future or ongoing responses. The two alternate cell fates, T MEM and T EX , cannot form from fully committed T EFF ( Angelosanto et al., 2012 2. Angelosanto, J.M. ∙ Blackburn, S.D. ∙ Crawford, A. ...

The high mobility group (HMG) TF, TCF-1, for example, is essential for development and maintenance of both T MEM and T EX ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ...

Immunol. 2016; 17 :695-703 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, a second HMG TF, Tox, is essential for the development of the T EX cell fate and represses T EFF lineage differentiation ( Alfei et al., 2019 1. Alfei, F. ∙ Kanev, K. ∙ Hofmann, M. ...

Single-cell RNA-seq reveals TOX as a key regulator of CD8+ T cell persistence in chronic infection Nat. Immunol. 2019; 20 :890-901 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite this work, mechanisms that safeguard against commitment to T EFF differentiation remain poorly understood. Such information could enable immunotherapies for cancer and chronic infections. However, whereas inactivating pathways like TCF-1 or Tox that would de-repress the entire program of T EFF differentiation are of interest, such approaches result in terminal T EFF and may have limited therapeutic benefit because such cells cannot sustain durable responses. Thus, the discovery of mechanisms that selectively de-repress key aspects of T EFF differentiation, particularly those involved in control of numerical expansion and/or protective immunity would be of considerable interest.
Here, we used in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screening in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells responding to acute or chronic viral infection to identify key regulators of T EFF and T EX . In particular, we aimed to identify genes that resulted in gain-of-function, improving T EFF differentiation (i.e., an “Up” screen) ( Kaelin, 2017 33. Kaelin, W.G. Common pitfalls in preclinical cancer target validation Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17 :441-450 Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar ).

However, the ability to discover fundamental regulators of cellular differentiation state and/or cellular programming via in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening in CD8 + T cells relevant for immunotherapy remains a key goal. Previous in vivo CRISPR screening approaches have used Cas9-edited bone marrow progenitors ( LaFleur et al., 2019 41. LaFleur, M.W. ∙ Nguyen, T.H. ∙ Coxe, M.A. ...

Although insights have been gained using these strategies, here, we developed a platform that circumvented impacts on immune system development and was capable of using physiological numbers of CD8 + T cells in vivo to avoid altered T cell differentiation and/or viral pathogenesis that occurs when high numbers of antigen-specific T cells are used in vivo ( Badovinac et al., 2007 4.

Our CD8 + T cell CRISPR screening platform used Cas9 + antigen-specific CD8 + T cells combined with an optimized retroviral (RV) based-sgRNA expression strategy (named optimized T cell in vivo CRISPR screening [OpTICS]). We focused on TFs to identify genes with central regulatory roles in fate decisions in T EFF versus T EX differentiation. This approach identified known key TFs essential for T EFF and T EX differentiation including Batf , Irf4 , and Myc as well as known repressors of T EFF differentiation including Tcf7 , Smad2 , and Tox . However, this screen also revealed central regulators of T EFF differentiation including many that limit optimal differentiation, such as Irf2 , Erg , and Fli1 , where CRISPR perturbation led to gain-of-function and improved T EFF responses. We further interrogated the role of Fli1, an ETS family TF with roles in hematopoiesis and other developmental pathways in non-immune and immune cell types ( Kruse et al., 2009 37.

Cell. 2011; 20 :597-609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we discovered a central role for Fli1 in T EFF responses where this TF specifically antagonized the genome-wide function of ETS:RUNX activity and prevented Runx3-driven T EFF biology. Indeed, genetic loss of Fli1 resulted in robustly improved T EFF responses whereas enforced Fli1 expression restrained differentiation. Fli1 prevented chromatin accessibility specifically at ETS:RUNX motifs and loss of Fli1 enabled transcriptional induction of the T EFF program in a Runx3-driven manner. Moreover, loss of Fli1 improved T EFF biology and protective immunity not only during LCMV infection, but also following infection with influenza virus or Listeria monocytogenes . In addition, deletion of Fli1 potently improved anti-tumor immunity. Thus, Fli1 safeguards the developing activated CD8 + T cell epigenome from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven T EFF differentiation and disruption of Fli1 activity improved T EFF activity and protective immunity to infections and cancer.

Section: Results

To enable gene editing in antigen-specific primary CD8 + T cells, we crossed LSL-Cas9 + mice ( Platt et al., 2014 64. Platt, R.J. ∙ Chen, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... CRISPR-Cas9 knockin mice for genome editing and cancer modeling Cell. 2014; 159 :440-455 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (846) PubMed Google Scholar ) to CD4 CRE+ P14 + mice bearing CD8 + T cells specific for the LCMV D b GP 33–41 epitope (termed Cas9 + P14, or C9P14). We expressed the backbone-optimized Cas9 single guide RNA (sgRNA) ( Grevet et al., 2018 23. Grevet, J.D. ∙ Lan, X. ∙ Hamagami, N. ... Domain-focused CRISPR screen identifies HRI as a fetal hemoglobin regulator in human erythroid cells Science. 2018; 361 :285-290 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) with a fluorescence marker in a retroviral (RV) vector ( Figure S1 A). To evaluate gene editing efficiency in vivo , we transduced C9P14 cells ex vivo with either negative control sgRNA (sgCtrl) ( Table S1 ) or sgRNA targeting Pdcd1 (encoding PD-1, sgPdcd1) ( Table S1 ) using an optimized RV transduction protocol ( Kurachi et al., 2017 39. Kurachi, M. ∙ Kurachi, J. ∙ Chen, Z. ... Optimized retroviral transduction of mouse T cells for in vivo assessment of gene function Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1980-1998 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure S1 B). The double-positive populations of sgRNA (mCherry + ) and Cas9 (GFP + ) CD8 + T cells ( Figure S1 C) were adoptively transferred into congenic recipient mice infected with the chronic strain of LCMV (clone13; Cl13) ( Figure S1 B). On day 9 post infection (p.i.), sgRNA + C9P14 cells were isolated and evaluated. As expected, sgPdcd1 induced antigen-specific CD8 + T cell expansion 5-fold greater than the control sgRNA ( Figure S1 D), consistent with the genetic knockout of Pdcd1 ( Odorizzi et al., 2015 58. Odorizzi, P.M. ∙ Pauken, K.E. ∙ Paley, M.A. ... Genetic absence of PD-1 promotes accumulation of terminally differentiated exhausted CD8 + T cells J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212 :1125-1137 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sgPdcd1 also resulted in a robust decrease of PD-1 protein expression ( Figure S1 E) and indel mutations in the Pdcd1 locus ( Figure S1 F). Furthermore, we confirmed the high gene editing efficiency of our system by designing sgRNAs targeting Klrg1 and Cxcr3 ( Figure S1 G; Table S1 ). Collectively, this in vitro sgRNA RV transduction in C9P14 followed by in vivo adoptive transfer system provides a robust platform to investigate genetic regulatory network of mouse CD8 + T cells in vivo .
To enable in vivo pooled genetic screening in the LCMV infection system, we further optimized the C9P14 and RV sgRNA platform ( Figure 1 A). First, we determined a physiological number of adoptively transferred CD8 + T cells for screening, as the number of T cells transferred can influence progression of cancer in tumor models or the outcome of infection in vivo ( Blattman et al., 2009 8. Blattman, J.N. ∙ Wherry, E.J. ∙ Ha, S.-J. ... Impact of epitope escape on PD-1 expression and CD8 T-cell exhaustion during chronic infection J. Virol. 2009; 83 :4386-4394 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). We, therefore, limited the number of adoptively transferred RV-transduced CD8 + T cells to 1 × 10 5 per mouse (~1 × 10 4 after take), a number previously optimized in chronic infection ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kao et al., 2011 34. Kao, C. ∙ Oestreich, K.J. ∙ Paley, M.A. ... Transcription factor T-bet represses expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and sustains virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses during chronic infection Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12 :663-671 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Next, to evaluate the performance of our system we targeted a focused set of 29 TFs in CD8 + T cells in vivo using the LCMV model. Previously, we found that sgRNAs targeting functionally important protein-coding domains can substantially improve genetic screening efficiency, as both in frame and frameshift mutations contribute to generating loss-of-function alleles ( Shi et al., 2015 76. Shi, J. ∙ Wang, E. ∙ Milazzo, J.P. ... Discovery of cancer drug targets by CRISPR-Cas9 screening of protein domains Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :661-667 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). We designed and cloned a sgRNA library targeting the DNA-binding domains of 29 TFs and other control genes (e.g., non-selected control sgRNAs and Pdcd1 ) with 4–5 sgRNAs per target. An average input coverage of ~400 cells per sgRNA after CD8 + T cell engraftment improved the signal-to-noise ratio and successfully identified hits compared to 100 cells per sgRNA ( Figure S1 H). Third, we assessed the performance of our in vivo screen using P14 cells expressing heterozygous versus homozygous alleles of the LSL-Cas9 transgene. Cas9 heterozygous P14 cells outperformed Cas9 homozygous P14 cells in terms of signal-to-noise and consistency between independent screens ( Figures S1 H and S1I) perhaps due to reduced off-target DNA damage in the heterozygous setting as we have noted for CRE ( Kurachi et al., 2019 40. Kurachi, M. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ∙ Kurachi, J. ... Hidden Caveat of Inducible Cre Recombinase Immunity. 2019; 51 :591-592 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). From these preliminary optimization screens, we identified Batf , Irf4 , and Myc as essential for early T cell activation because genetic targeting of these genes potently inhibited T cell activation in vivo ( Figure S1 H), consistent with known roles for Batf and Irf4 ( Grusdat et al., 2014 24.

Quigley, M. ∙ Pereyra, F. ∙ Nilsson, B. ... Transcriptional analysis of HIV-specific CD8 + T cells shows that PD-1 inhibits T cell function by upregulating BATF Nat. Med. 2010; 16 :1147-1151 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Myc ( Lindsten et al., 1988 45. Lindsten, T. ∙ June, C.H. ∙ Thompson, C.B. Multiple mechanisms regulate c-myc gene expression during normal T cell activation EMBO J. 1988; 7 :2787-2794 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2011 89.

The transcription factor Myc controls metabolic reprogramming upon T lymphocyte activation Immunity. 2011; 35 :871-882 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (966) PubMed Google Scholar ) in T EFF biology. This system was highly efficient with up to ~100-fold enrichment for genes essential for CD8 + T cell responses ( Figure S1 H) and nearly 20-fold enrichment for genes that repress T cell activation and differentiation ( Figure S1 J).
To identify TFs governing T EFF and T EX cell differentiation, we constructed another domain-focused sgRNA library against 120 TFs ( Table S2 ; see STAR methods ). This library has 675 sgRNAs total, including 4–5 sgRNAs per DNA-binding domain, positive selection controls (sgPdcd1), and non-selection controls (e.g., sgAno9, sgRosa26, etc.) ( Figure 1 A). With this 120-TF targeting sgRNA library, we next interrogated in vivo selection and sgRNA enrichment at 1 or 2 weeks p.i. with acutely resolving LCMV Arm (Arm) or chronic Cl13 ( Figure 1 A). We examined C9P14 cells from different organs (PBMC, spleen, liver, and lung) to identify TFs broadly important for CD8 + T cell responses to infection. In general, groups clustered by time point and infection, rather than anatomical location ( Figure S1 K). At 2 weeks p.i. the data for Arm and Cl13 diverged ( Figure S1 K), consistent with distinct trajectories of T cell differentiation during acutely resolved versus chronic infections ( Wherry et al., 2007 97. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Ha, S.-J. ∙ Kaech, S.M. ... Molecular signature of CD8 + T cell exhaustion during chronic viral infection Immunity. 2007; 27 :670-684 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1137) PubMed Google Scholar ). Focusing on the spleen, Batf , Irf4 , and Myc emerged as some of the strongest negatively selected hits at both time points in both infections ( Figures 1 B and 1C). We also confirmed several other known effector-driving TFs including Tbx21 (encoding T-bet), Id2 , Stat5a , Stat5b , and components of the nuclear factor κB (NF-kB) complex ( Figures 1 B and 1C). In addition, several TFs with potential roles in T cell activation and differentiation were revealed including Smad4 , Smad7 , and Mybl2 ( Figures 1 B and 1C).
We also used the OpTICS system as an “UP” screen ( Kaelin, 2017 33. Kaelin, W.G. Common pitfalls in preclinical cancer target validation Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17 :441-450 Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar ) to identify genes that repressed optimal T cell activation and T EFF cell differentiation. Such genes, like Pdcd1 , represent potential immunotherapy targets for improving T cell responses in cancer or infections. PD-1 served as a prototypical positive control where, as expected, Pdcd1 -sgRNAs were strongly positively selected across infections, time points, and in all tissues ( Figures 1 B–1D). This screen also identified TFs that antagonized robust CD8 + T cell responses ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Among these, Smad2 has been shown to limit T EFF cell responses during both acute and chronic infection ( Tinoco et al., 2009 86. Tinoco, R. ∙ Alcalde, V. ∙ Yang, Y. ... Cell-intrinsic transforming growth factor-β signaling mediates virus-specific CD8 + T cell deletion and viral persistence in vivo Immunity. 2009; 31 :145-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also identified Nfatc2 and Nr4a2 ( Figure 1 C), both of which have been implicated in fostering T cell exhaustion and thus limiting T EFF responses ( Chen et al., 2019a 13. Chen, J. ∙ López-Moyado, I.F. ∙ Seo, H. ... NR4A transcription factors limit CAR T cell function in solid tumours Nature. 2019; 567 :530-534 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ; Martinez et al., 2015 53. Martinez, G.J. ∙ Pereira, R.M. ∙ Äijö, T. ... The transcription factor NFAT promotes exhaustion of activated CD8 + T cells Immunity. 2015; 42 :265-278 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, Gata3 identified here has been implicated in driving T cell dysfunction and inhibiting T EFF cell response ( Singer et al., 2016 79. Singer, M. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Cong, L. ... A Distinct Gene Module for Dysfunction Uncoupled from Activation in Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells Cell. 2016; 166 :1500-1511.e1509 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, this screen identified key TFs known to restrain T EFF differentiation and, in some cases, promote exhaustion.
This OpTICS screen also identified additional TFs that restrained optimal T EFF differentiation. This set of genes included Atf6 , Irf2 , Erg , and Fli1 , with Fli1 among the strongest hits in repressing T EFF differentiation. The identification of Fli1 as a repressor of T EFF differentiation occurred similarly in Arm and Cl13 infections ( Figures 1 B–1D) indicating a common role for this TF in restraining T EFF biology. We next selected 2 Fli1 -sgRNAs (sgFli1_290 and sgFli1_360) and confirmed that these sgRNAs effectively edited the Fli1 gene (70%–80% editing; Figure S2 A) leading to reduced protein expression ( Figure 1 E). Targeting Fli1 using these individual Fli1- sgRNAs in C9P14 cells in vivo resulted in 5- to 20-fold greater expansion at 1 and 2 weeks p.i. with either Arm or Cl13 ( Figures 1 F and S2 B–S2E). These data indicate repression of robust CD8 + T cell expansion by Fli1 in acutely resolving or developing chronic infection.
We next interrogated the differentiation state of Fli1 -sgRNA (sgFli1) or Ctrl-sgRNA (sgCtrl) transduced C9P14 cells during acutely resolved infection. On Day 8 p.i., Fli1 deletion reduced the proportion of the CD127 Hi memory precursors (T MP ), whereas the frequency KLRG1 Hi terminal effector (T EFF ) population remained unchanged and the CD127 Lo KLRG1 Lo population slightly increased ( Figures 2 A and S3 A). These effects were more dramatic at day 15 p.i. when the frequency of the CD127 Hi T MP population was reduced and the KLRG1 Hi T EFF cell population increased ( Figure 2 A). However, at both time points the absolute number of both T MP and T EFF was increased ~2- to 10-fold due to the proliferative expansion of Fli1 -deficient CD8 + T cells ( Figure 2 A). This skewing of T cell differentiation toward T EFF -like populations was also observed using CX3CR1 and CXCR3 ( Gerlach et al., 2016 22. Gerlach, C. ∙ Moseman, E.A. ∙ Loughhead, S.M. ... The Chemokine Receptor CX3CR1 Defines Three Antigen-Experienced CD8 T Cell Subsets with Distinct Roles in Immune Surveillance and Homeostasis Immunity. 2016; 45 :1270-1284 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar ), with sgFli1 significantly enriching for the CX3CR1 + CXCR3 − T EFF population compared to the CX3CR1 − CXCR3 + early T MEM subset ( Figure 2 B). C9P14 cells with increased cytotoxic potential (GzmB + TCF-1 − ) were also increased in the sgFli1 + group ( Figure S3 B), although the proportion of cells expressing T-bet or Eomes was similar between the groups ( Figure S3 C). The frequency of C9P14 cells producing interferon (IFN)-γ after ex vivo peptide stimulation was slightly lower in the sgFli1 + versus sgCtrl + group, but the absolute number of IFN-γ producing cells, or cells co-producing multiple effector molecules simultaneously, was increased ( Figure S3 D).
One concern with fostering an increase in T EFF is the preventing the formation of T MEM . Thus, we next examined formation of Fli1-deficient T MEM 1 month p.i. Indeed, the number of KLRG1 Hi effector memory C9P14 cells remained higher in the sgFli1 + C9P14 group compared to the sgCtrl + group on day 29 p.i. The number of CD127 Hi T MEM at this time point was similar between the groups ( Figures S3 E and S3F), indicating that the robust increase in the KRLG1 HI T EFF populations generated in the absence of Fli1 did not compromise the formation of T MEM . To further interrogate the effects of Fli1 deficiency on T MEM , we examined expression of pro-and anti-apoptotic molecules, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bim. On day 15 p.i., sgFli1 + C9P14 cells had lower expression of both Bcl-2 and Bim but no change in Bcl-XL expression compared to the sgCtrl + group ( Figures S3 G and S3H), resulting in a trend to a higher Bcl-XL/Bim ratio in the sgFli1 + C9P14 group ( Figure S3 H). There were no differences in expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bim in T EFF or T MP subsets ( Figures S3 I and S3J) suggesting that the differences in total C9P14 populations reflect, in part, different proportions of terminal T EFF and T MP . These observations may be consistent with the observation that the Bcl-XL/Bim ratio may be more important in terminal T EFF survival than the Bcl-2/Bim ratio ( Chen et al., 2017 12. Chen, Z. ∙ Stelekati, E. ∙ Kurachi, M. ... miR-150 Regulates Memory CD8 T Cell Differentiation via c-Myb Cell Rep. 2017; 20 :2584-2597 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next enforced Fli1 expression in WT LCMV-specific P14 cells using an RV-based overexpression (OE) system ( Kurachi et al., 2017 39. Kurachi, M. ∙ Kurachi, J. ∙ Chen, Z. ... Optimized retroviral transduction of mouse T cells for in vivo assessment of gene function Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1980-1998 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). An ~5-fold reduction in responding Fli1-OE-RV transduced P14 cells was observed on day 8 and day 16 p.i. compared to the empty vector control ( Figure 2 C). Furthermore, enforced Fli1 expression diverted the responding P14 cells toward T MP differentiation ( Figures 2 D and 2E). Together, these data reveal a role for Fli1 in restraining T EFF differentiation and promoting T MP development during acute infection.
During chronic viral infection, there is an early fate bifurcation for CD8 + T cell responses where antiviral CD8 + T cells develop into either terminal T EFF -like cells or form T EX precursors that ultimately seed the mature T EX population ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khan et al., 2019 35. Khan, O. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ McDonald, S. ... TOX transcriptionally and epigenetically programs CD8+ T cell exhaustion Nature. 2019; 571 :211-218 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore investigated the role of Fli1 in this cell fate decision early during chronic infection. As in acutely resolving infection, genetic perturbation of Fli1 skewed the virus-specific CD8 + T cell response toward the T EFF pathway, defined as TCF-1 − GrzmB + or Ly108 − CD39 + cells ( Figure 3 A) ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Due to the 5- to 10-fold increase in total Fli1 -deficient cells, the cell numbers of both the T EFF -like and T EX precursor populations were increased ( Figures S4 A and S4B). We also investigated the TF circuitry known to be involved in early T EX formation. TCF-1 at this early time point drives expression of Eomes, another TF central to T EX formation ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) and, indeed, Eomes was reduced in the absence of Fli1 ( Figure S4 C). Expression of T-bet, another T-box TF, was similar between sgCtrl + and sgFli1 + groups ( Figure S4 C). Loss of Fli1 was also associated with lower expression of the T EX master regulator Tox on day 15 p.i. with Cl13, suggesting that Fli1-deficiency antagonized the development of T EX and instead fostered T EFF -like differentiation ( Figure S4 C). This skewing toward the T EFF fate was associated with increased expression of cytotoxic molecules ( Figure 3 A) and higher cell numbers that translated to increased numbers of cytokine producing cells ( Figure S4 D). Moreover, genetic perturbation of Fli1 resulted in an increased proportion of CX3CR1 + and Tim3 + T EFF -like cells in chronic infection ( Figure 3 B) ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zander et al., 2019 104. Zander, R. ∙ Schauder, D. ∙ Xin, G. ... CD4 + T Cell Help Is Required for the Formation of a Cytolytic CD8 + T Cell Subset that Protects against Chronic Infection and Cancer Immunity. 2019; 51 :1028-1042.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, enforced Fli1 expression had the opposite effect and not only resulted in lower cell numbers ( Figure S4 E), but also fostered formation of Ly108 + CD39 − or TCF-1 + GrzmB − T EX precursors and fewer CX3CR1 + cells ( Figures S4 F–S4H). Notably, PD-1 expression was unchanged and, unlike acutely resolved infection, KLRG1 expression was unaffected ( Figure 3 B).
To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted sgCtrl + or sgFli1 + C9P14 cells on day 9 of Cl13 infection. Both sgRNAs targeting Fli1 resulted in a similar transcriptional effect ( Figures 3 C and S5 A). The sgFli1 + C9P14 cells were transcriptionally distinct from the sgCtrl + C9P14 cells with over 1,400 genes differentially expressed between the two conditions ( Figures 3 C and S5 A). Effector-associated genes such as Prf1 , Gzmb , Cd28 , Ccl3 , and Prdm1 were robustly increased in the sgFli1 + C9P14 cells, whereas the sgCtrl + C9P14s were enriched in T EX precursor genes such as Tcf7 , Cxcr5 , Slamf6 , and Id3 ( Figure 3 C). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis also identified cell division-associated and T cell activation-associated pathways in sgFli1 + C9P14 cells ( Figure 3 D), whereas sgCtrl + C9P14s enriched in metabolic pathways, in particular nucleotide, nucleoside, and purine biosynthesis ( Figure 3 E). We next used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to examine the early phase of chronic infection, when a divergence of differentiation into either T EFF -like or T EX precursor cell fates occurs. Indeed, the T EX precursor signature ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) was strongly enriched in sgCtrl + C9P14 cells compared to the sgFli1 + C9P14 population whereas a T EFF gene signature ( Bengsch et al., 2018 6. Bengsch, B. ∙ Ohtani, T. ∙ Khan, O. ... Epigenomic-Guided Mass Cytometry Profiling Reveals Disease-Specific Features of Exhausted CD8 T Cells Immunity. 2018; 48 :1029-1045.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) was strongly enriched in the sgFli1 + C9P14 population ( Figures 3 F and 3G). Thus, Fli1 repressed optimal T EFF differentiation in both acutely resolving and chronic infection and loss of Fli1 antagonized the development of T EX cells. However, although genetic perturbation of Fli1 drove an increase in expression of effector-associated genes at day 9 of chronic infection, Tox , Tox2 , and Cd28 were also increased. This effect may suggest that although loss of Fli1 might enhance T EFF -like biology this effect might not be at the expense of genes necessary to sustain responses in chronic infection or cancer.
In acute myeloid leukemia, FLI1 co-localizes with the chromatin remodeler BRD4 ( Roe et al., 2015 70. Roe, J.-S. ∙ Mercan, F. ∙ Rivera, K. ... BET Bromodomain Inhibition Suppresses the Function of Hematopoietic Transcription Factors in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Mol. Cell. 2015; 58 :1028-1039 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). The EWS-Fli1 fusion oncoprotein driving Ewing’s sarcoma can trigger de novo enhancer formation via chromatin remodeling and can inactivate existing enhancers by displacing ETS family members ( Riggi et al., 2014 69. Riggi, N. ∙ Knoechel, B. ∙ Gillespie, S.M. ... EWS-FLI1 utilizes divergent chromatin remodeling mechanisms to directly activate or repress enhancer elements in Ewing sarcoma Cancer Cell. 2014; 26 :668-681 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is unclear, however, how Fli1 affects epigenetic landscape changes in developing T EFF , T MEM , or T EX cells.
To examine the role of Fli1 in supporting the epigenetic landscape of CD8 + T cells, we performed ATAC-seq on sgFli1 + and sgCtrl + C9P14 cells on day 9 p.i. with Cl13. Compared to sgCtrl + C9P14 cells, the sgFli1 + group had considerable changes in chromatin accessibility ( Figure 4 A). Over 5,000 open chromatin regions (OCRs) differed between the control and Fli1- perturbed groups with approximately equal numbers of peaks gained or lost ( Figures 4 B–4D). Most of these changes were located in intronic or intergenic regions consistent with cis -regulatory or enhancer elements ( Figure 4 C).
We next assigned each OCR to the nearest gene to estimate genes that could be regulated by these cis -regulatory elements. T EFF -associated genes, such as Ccl3 , Ccl5 , Cd28 , Cx3cr1 , and Prdm1 , gained chromatin accessibility in the sgFli1 + group ( Figure 4 D), consistent with the RNA-seq data. In contrast, there was decreased chromatin accessibility near genes involved in T cell progenitor biology such as Tcf7 , Slamf6 , Id3 , and Cxcr5 ( Figure 4 D) in the sgFli1 + group. Moreover, the sgFli1 + C9P14 cells had altered accessibility in the Tox (and Tox2 ) locus, but these changes included both increased and decreased accessibility for different peaks ( Figure 4 D). These changes in chromatin accessibility corresponded to changes in gene expression with ~1/3 of the genes that changed transcriptionally associated with a differentially accessible chromatin region (402 out of 1,467) ( Figure 4 E). In general, increased accessibility correlated with increased transcription, although there was a clear subset of regions where decreased accessibility corresponded to increased transcription ( Figure 4 F).
We next defined the TF motifs present in the OCRs that were dependent on Fli1 for altered accessibility. Among the OCRs that decreased in accessibility in the absence of Fli1, the most enriched TF motifs were for IRF1 and IRF2 ( Figure 4 G), potentially linking Fli1 to IRF1 and IRF2 downstream of IFN signaling or to the regulation of cell cycle by these TFs ( Choo et al., 2006 16. Choo, A. ∙ Palladinetti, P. ∙ Passioura, T. ... The role of IRF1 and IRF2 transcription factors in leukaemogenesis Curr. Gene Ther. 2006; 6 :543-550 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the group of OCRs that increased in accessibility in the absence of Fli1, ETS and RUNX motifs were highly enriched ( Figure 4 G). The composite ETS:RUNX motif was by far the most changed with 18-fold enrichment ( Figure 4 G). These observations suggested that Fli1 may limit the activity of other ETS family members (e.g., ETS1, ETV1, or ELK1) or alter accessibility at ETS:RUNX binding sites ( Figure 4 G). Runx3 is a central driver of T EFF differentiation and functions by directly regulating effector gene expression, coordinating and enabling effector gene regulation via T-bet and Eomes and antagonizing TCF-1 expression ( Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009 17. Cruz-Guilloty, F. ∙ Pipkin, M.E. ∙ Djuretic, I.M. ... Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :51-59 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shan et al., 2017 74. Shan, Q. ∙ Zeng, Z. ∙ Xing, S. ... The transcription factor Runx3 guards cytotoxic CD8+ effector T cells against deviation towards follicular helper T cell lineage Nat.

The Transcription Factor Runx3 Establishes Chromatin Accessibility of cis-Regulatory Landscapes that Drive Memory Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Formation Immunity. 2018; 48 :659-674.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, a potential role for Fli1 in Runx3 biology would provide a mechanistic link between loss of Fli1 and improved T EFF differentiation.
We tested how Fli1 genomic binding was related to changes in chromatin accessibility and T EFF biology, using Fli1 CUT&RUN ( Skene and Henikoff, 2017 80. Skene, P.J. ∙ Henikoff, S. An efficient targeted nuclease strategy for high-resolution mapping of DNA binding sites Elife. 2017; 6 :e21856 Crossref Scopus (249) PubMed Google Scholar ). At day 9 p.i. with Cl13, >90% of the identified Fli1 binding sites were contained in OCRs detected by ATAC-seq ( Figures S5 B–S5D). Specifically, Fli1 bound to OCRs of T EFF -like genes such as Cx3cr1 , Cd28 , and Havcr2. Chromatin accessibility increased at these locations on Fli1 deletion ( Figure 4 H), resulting in increased transcription ( Figure 3 C) and protein expression ( Figures 3 B and 4 I). In contrast, for genes involved in progenitor biology that were decreased in expression in the absence of Fli1, such as Tcf7 and Id3 , direct binding of Fli1 was not observed ( Figure S5 D), likely indicating that the major role of Fli1 is to safeguard against an overly robust T EFF program rather directly enabling memory/progenitor biology. Furthermore, 78% of the sites where Fli1 was defined to bind by CUT&RUN increased in chromatin accessibility in the absence of Fli1; in contrast, 22% decreased in accessibility ( Figure 4 J), suggesting that Fli1 mainly functions to repress chromatin accessibility. Analyzing the DNA binding motifs in the Fli1 CUT&RUN data revealed the expected FLI1 motif. However, SP2, NFY1, and RUNX1 motifs were also significantly enriched where Fli1 bound ( Figure 4 K). Together with the increase in ETS:RUNX motifs in the Fli1 -deficient ATAC-seq observations above, these data support a model where Fli1 coordinates with RUNX family members to control T EFF differentiation.
Unlike T EFF biology, the roles of Runx1 and Runx3 in T EX development are less clear. Because T EFF and T EX are opposing fates in chronic infection ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ...

Yao, C. ∙ Sun, H.-W. ∙ Lacey, N.E. ... Single-cell RNA-seq reveals TOX as a key regulator of CD8+ T cell persistence in chronic infection Nat.

CD4 + T Cell Help Is Required for the Formation of a Cytolytic CD8 + T Cell Subset that Protects against Chronic Infection and Cancer Immunity. 2019; 51 :1028-1042.e4 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), and ETS:RUNX motifs become more accessible in the absence of Fli1, we hypothesized that a RUNX-Fli1 axis might influence T EFF versus T EX differentiation. We, therefore, tested whether Runx1 or Runx3 expression in Fli1 -deficient CD8 + T cells would impact T EFF differentiation in early chronic infection.
Enforced expression of Runx1 in WT P14 cells reduced cell numbers at day 7 p.i. with Cl13 infection ( Figure S5 E). Moreover, Runx1-OE fostered formation of Ly108 + CD39 − T EX precursors at the expense of the more T EFF -like Ly108 − CD39 + population at this time point ( Figure S5 E). To interrogate the impact of enforced Runx1 expression in the absence of Fli1, we used a dual RV transduction approach and combined control or Fli1 sgRNA RV transduction with either empty or Runx1 expressing RVs. Singly versus dually transduced cells were distinguished using VEX (for sgRNA) and mCherry. C9P14 cells were efficiently singly or dually transduced ( Figure S5 F), adoptively transferred into Cl13-infected mice and the double transduced (i.e., GFP + VEX + mCherry + ) C9P14 cells were analyzed on day 8 p.i. ( Figure 5 A). In the sgFli1+Runx1-OE group, the number of GFP + VEX + mCherry + C9P14 cells was reduced, and there were fewer Ly108 − CD39 + cells. In contrast, the sgFli1+Empty-RV group had an increase in the GFP + VEX + mCherry + C9P14 cell population, and these cells were skewed toward the Ly108 − CD39 + T EFF -like fate ( Figures 5 B–5D and S5 G) as above. However, in the Fli1 -deficient setting where there was enhanced CD8 + T cell expansion, Runx1 overexpression reduced the magnitude of the response and partially reversed the skewing toward the Ly108 - CD39 + T EFF -like fate caused by loss of Fli1 ( Figures 5 B–5D).
In contrast to the effect of Runx1, enforced expression of Runx3 alone (in the sgCtrl + group), modestly increased the magnitude of the CD8 + T cell response but robustly skewed the GFP + VEX + mCherry + C9P14 population toward a CD39 + Ly108 − T EFF -like population ( Figures 5 A and 5E–5G). These effects were more dramatic in the absence of Fli1 with greater numerical amplification and even further skewing toward CD39 + Ly108 − T EFF -like cells in the sgFli1+Runx3-OE enforced expression group ( Figures 5 E–5G). Whereas the sgFli1+Runx3-OE group had lower frequency of the T EX precursor population, the absolute number of this population remained unchanged compared to control ( Figures 5 E, 5G, and S5 I). Taken together, these data support a model where loss of Fli1 reveals ETS:RUNX motifs that can be used by Runx1 and/or Runx3. However, whereas Runx3 drives a more T EFF -like population, an effect amplified in the absence of Fli1 , Runx1 appears to antagonize T EFF generation, in agreement with the opposing functions of Runx1 and Runx3 ( Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009 17. Cruz-Guilloty, F. ∙ Pipkin, M.E. ∙ Djuretic, I.M. ... Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :51-59 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, Fli1 restrains the T EFF promoting activity of Runx3 function by restricting genome access and protecting ETS:RUNX binding sites. These data reveal Fli1, Runx3, and perhaps Runx1 as key regulators of the fate choice between T EFF and T EX early after initial activation.
The data above provoke the question of whether loss of Fli1 would improve control of infections due to the augmented T EFF differentiation. To test this idea, we used LCMV Cl13 to investigate protective immunity during chronic infection and two models of acute infection with influenza virus (PR8) or Listeria monocytogenes (LM) each expressing the LCMV GP 33–41 epitope (PR8 GP33 and LM GP33 ) recognized by P14 cells ( Figure 6 A).
During Cl13 infection, adoptive transfer of sgCtrl + C9P14 cells conferred a moderate degree of viral control compared to the no transfer condition (NT) ( Figure 6 B) as expected ( Blattman et al., 2009 8. Blattman, J.N. ∙ Wherry, E.J. ∙ Ha, S.-J. ... Impact of epitope escape on PD-1 expression and CD8 T-cell exhaustion during chronic infection J. Virol. 2009; 83 :4386-4394 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, sgFli1 + C9P14 provided substantially improved control of viral replication compared to sgCtrl + C9P14 cells at ~2 weeks p.i. ( Figure 6 B), demonstrating a benefit due to loss of Fli1 even in chronic viral infection where induction of exhaustion is a major barrier to effective protective immunity. Notably, in some experiments, sgFli1 + C9P14, but not sgCtrl + C9P14-recipient mice, experienced severe disease and had to be euthanized between D7–D13 p.i., ( Figure S6 A), suggesting that Fli1 may safeguard from excessive T EFF -like differentiation and limit T cell-mediated immunopathology.
We next evaluated the impact of loss of Fli1 during acutely resolving infections. During influenza-PR8 GP33 infection, mice receiving sgFli1 + C9P14 cells lost less weight than control non-transferred mice or mice receiving sgCtrl + C9P14 cells ( Figure 6 C). Decreased weight loss was associated with better control of viral replication in the lungs of mice receiving sgFli1 + C9P14 cells ( Figure 6 D). In this setting, there was variation in the magnitude of the sgFli1 + C9P14 expansion in the lungs following PR8 GP33 infection ( Figures S6 B–S6D). This heterogeneity in the T cell responses was associated with differences in viral control, with some mice nearly eliminating viral RNA by this time point ( Figure 6 D) and recovering from weight loss. Indeed, the overall magnitude of the C9P14 response was lower in mice that had recovered, consistent with prolonged viral replication and higher antigen load driving increased T cell expansion in mice that had not yet controlled the infection ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Notably, 6 out of 12 of the mice receiving sgFli1 + C9P14 cells had controlled disease by this time point, compared to only 1 out of 11 mice receiving sgCtrl + C9P14 ( Figures 6 D and S6 C). In the group of mice still harboring viral RNA in the lungs, sgFli1 + C9P14 cells had expanded to substantially higher numbers than sgCtrl + C9P14 cells ( Figure S6 C). A similar difference in T EFF cell expansion was also observed in the spleen ( Figure S6 D).
Loss of Fli1 conferred a similar advantage following LM GP33 infection. Although both sgCtrl + and sgFli1 + C9P14 cells improved survival following a high dose LM GP33 challenge ( Figure 6 E), sgFli1 + C9P14 cells resulted in substantially better control of bacterial replication compared to the sgCtrl + C9P14 cells at day 7 p.i. ( Figure 6 F). Consistent with the influenza virus model, this improved protective immunity was associated with greater numerical expansion of sgFli1 + C9P14 cells compared to the sgCtrl + group ( Figure S6 E). Thus, deficiency in Fli1 confers a substantial benefit on T EFF cell expansion and protective immunity during chronic Cl13 infection, respiratory influenza virus infection, and systemic infection with an intracellular bacterium.
We next asked whether Fli1 deficiency provided enhanced control of tumors. Thus, we employed a subcutaneous B16 GP33 tumor model. Tumor-bearing mice received equal numbers of sgCtrl + or sgFli1 + C9P14 cells on day 5 post tumor inoculation (p.t.) ( Figure 7 A). We used Rag2 −/− recipient mice to isolate the effects of sgCtrl + versus sgFli1 + C9P14 cells ( Figure 7 A). In this setting, sgFli1 + C9P14 cells robustly controlled tumor progression compared to non-transferred mice or the sgCtrl + C9P14 group ( Figure 7 B). Furthermore, tumor weight was significantly lower in the sgFli1 + C9P14 group compared to either control group at endpoint ( Figure 7 C). Although there was not a clear difference in the number of C9P14 cells/gram of tumor, this tumor control was associated with a significant increase in Ly108 − CD39 + donor C9P14 in the sgFli1 + group, consistent with a shift toward the more T EFF -like population ( Figures 7 D and 7E). In the spleen, however, there was a significant increase in sgFli1 + C9P14 cell numbers, as well as the proportion of Ly108 − CD39 + cells compared to the sgCtrl + group ( Figures 7 F and 7G). We extended these findings to immune competent mice. We used Cas9 + C57BL/6 recipient mice to prevent rejection of the C9P14 donor cells and allow responses to be analyzed for an extended period of time ( Figure S7 A). In this setting, sgFli1 + C9P14 cells again conferred substantial benefit on tumor control ( Figures S7 B and S7C) compared to sgCtrl + C9P14 cells. Furthermore, this improved tumor control was associated with an increase in the Ly108 − CD39 + T EFF -like population in the tumor, draining lymph node (dLN) and spleen, as well as increased C9P14 cell numbers in the dLN and spleen ( Figures S7 D–S7G). Thus, genetic deletion of Fli1 conferred a substantial benefit on tumor control indicating a central role for Fli1 in coordinating and restraining protective T EFF responses during tumor progression. Together, these data show that loss of Fli1 results in improved protective immunity, in the setting of systemic and local, acutely resolving and chronic infections, as well as tumor progression.

Section: Discussion

Considerable current efforts focus on improving immunotherapy for cancer and chronic infections through a better understanding of the biology of T EX and T EFF differentiation. In this study, we used a focused in vivo CRISPR screening approach to specifically interrogate the mechanisms governing T EX versus T EFF differentiation. We identified Fli1 as a key TF that safeguards the transcriptional and epigenetic commitment to full T EFF differentiation. Mechanistically, Fli1 limited epigenetic accessibility to ETS:RUNX sites, preventing Runx3 from fully enabling an effector program. As a result, deleting Fli1 robustly improved protective immunity in multiple models of acute infection, chronic infection and cancer, thus identifying Fli1 as a key regulator of the T EFF versus T EX differentiation programs and a target for future immunotherapy strategies.

Biotechnol. 2019; 39 :1-12 Google Scholar ). To better understand the fate commitment of T EFF and T EX , we developed OpTICS, an in vivo CRISPR system that allows screening in mature CD8 + T cells using physiological T cell numbers that preserve disease pathogenesis and normal CD8 + T cell differentiation biology. In addition to identifying many known regulators of CD8 + T cell responses, this approach identified several previously unexplored negative regulators of T EFF differentiation, including Smad2 , Erg , and Fli1 . Indeed, genetic loss of Fli1 improved protective immunity in multiple settings of acute or chronic infection and cancer. Moreover, unlike the effect seen with loss of the T EX -driving TF Tox, where CD8 + T cell responses cannot be sustained during chronic infection or cancer due to loss of T EX progenitor cells ( Khan et al., 2019 35. Khan, O. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ McDonald, S. ... TOX transcriptionally and epigenetically programs CD8+ T cell exhaustion Nature. 2019; 571 :211-218 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar , Seo et al., 2019 73.

USA. 2019; 116 :12410-12415 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ), deficiency in Fli1 did not diminish the T EX progenitor population.
Fli1 has a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and co-localizes with other TFs such as Gata1/2 and Runx1 ( Tijssen et al., 2011 85. Tijssen, M.R. ∙ Cvejic, A. ∙ Joshi, A. ... Genome-wide analysis of simultaneous GATA1/2, RUNX1, FLI1, and SCL binding in megakaryocytes identifies hematopoietic regulators Dev. Cell. 2011; 20 :597-609 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we find that genetic perturbation of Fli1 significantly increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells responding to viral infection. Moreover, the effect of enforced Runx3 expression is enhanced in the absence of Fli1. These observations suggest that Fli1 prevents accessibility to RUNX binding sites, restricting the activity of the effector-promoting TF Runx3. Moreover, Runx3 can coordinate epigenetic changes at loci encoding other effector-promoting TFs ( Wang et al., 2018 90. Wang, D. ∙ Diao, H. ∙ Getzler, A.J. ... The Transcription Factor Runx3 Establishes Chromatin Accessibility of cis-Regulatory Landscapes that Drive Memory Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Formation Immunity. 2018; 48 :659-674.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Runx1 likely antagonizes Runx3 and vice versa, although Runx3 appears to dominate in settings of T cell activation ( Cheng et al., 2008 15. Cheng, C.K. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Cheng, S.H. ... Transcriptional repression of the RUNX3/AML2 gene by the t(8;21) and inv(16) fusion proteins in acute myeloid leukemia Blood. 2008; 112 :3391-3402 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ; Cruz-Guilloty et al., 2009 17. Cruz-Guilloty, F. ∙ Pipkin, M.E. ∙ Djuretic, I.M. ... Runx3 and T-box proteins cooperate to establish the transcriptional program of effector CTLs J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206 :51-59 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data also suggest that Fli1 can cooperate with Runx1 to restrain T EFF differentiation, perhaps with Fli1 and Runx1 co-binding at ETS-RUNX motifs. Together, these data suggest a model where Fli1, in combination with Runx1, prevents efficient genome accessibility or activity of Runx3 and thus restrain the full effector gene program that involves the positive feed-forward effector promoting activity of Runx3. Thus, genetic deletion of Fli1 de-represses T EFF differentiation, at least partially by creating opportunities for more efficient Runx3 activity.
Recent work has begun to define the transcriptional circuitry that directs fate decisions between terminal T EFF , T MEM and T EX . Many of these transcriptional mechanisms that promote one cell fate directly repress the opposing fate. For example, Tox promotes T EX while repressing T EFF ( Alfei et al., 2019 1. Alfei, F. ∙ Kanev, K. ∙ Hofmann, M. ... TOX reinforces the phenotype and longevity of exhausted T cells in chronic viral infection Nature. 2019; 571 :265-269 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khan et al., 2019 35.

TOX transcriptionally and epigenetically programs CD8+ T cell exhaustion Nature. 2019; 571 :211-218 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ), TCF-1 promotes T MEM or T EX at the expense of T EFF ( Chen et al., 2019b 14. Chen, Z. ∙ Ji, Z. ∙ Ngiow, S.F. ... TCF-1-Centered Transcriptional Network Drives an Effector versus Exhausted CD8 T Cell-Fate Decision Immunity. 2019; 51 :840-855.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhou et al., 2010 106. Zhou, X. ∙ Yu, S. ∙ Zhao, D.-M. ... Differentiation and persistence of memory CD8( + ) T cells depend on T cell factor 1 Immunity. 2010; 33 :229-240 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Blimp-1, T-bet, Id2, and others drive T EFF and repress T MEM ( Kaech and Cui, 2012 32. Kaech, S.M. ∙ Cui, W. Transcriptional control of effector and memory CD8+ T cell differentiation Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12 :749-761 Crossref Scopus (715) PubMed Google Scholar ). The identification of Fli1 as a type of genomic “safeguard” against over-commitment to effector differentiation reveals several concepts. First, during chronic infection, loss of TCF-1 or Tox results in an ability to sustain responses later in infection due to commitment to terminally differentiated T EFF ( Alfei et al., 2019 1. Alfei, F. ∙ Kanev, K. ∙ Hofmann, M. ...

Defining CD8+ T cells that provide the proliferative burst after PD-1 therapy Nature. 2016; 537 :417-421 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ; Khan et al., 2019 35. Khan, O. ∙ Giles, J.R. ∙ McDonald, S. ... TOX transcriptionally and epigenetically programs CD8+ T cell exhaustion Nature. 2019; 571 :211-218 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ; Utzschneider et al., 2016 88. Utzschneider, D.T. ∙ Charmoy, M. ∙ Chennupati, V. ... T Cell Factor 1-Expressing Memory-like CD8( + ) T Cells Sustain the Immune Response to Chronic Viral Infections Immunity. 2016; 45 :415-427 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations provoke the question of whether fostering an increase in the T EFF cell fate necessarily comes at the expense of losing the T MEM or T EX lineage. Fli1 represents a distinct type of damper on an otherwise robust feed-forward effector transcriptional circuit. By restraining the Runx3 node in the effector wiring, Fli1 tempers a central step that not only directly controls expression of key effector genes but also positively reinforces other cooperating effector TFs. However, unlike TCF-1 and Tox, Fli1 is not required for progenitor biology and the number of both T EFF cells and T MP (in acutely resolved infections) or T EX progenitor cells (in chronic infection) were increased in the absence of Fli1. Thus, by interrupting this “damper” in the circuit, rather than deleting the master switch of T MP or T EX differentiation it may be possible to augment beneficial aspects of short-term protective immunity without compromising long-term immunity. Second, our data reveal a mechanism of competition for epigenetic access between Fli1 and other factors that bind at ETS:RUNX motifs. These effects may manifest because Fli1 occupies genomic locations that can be bound by ETS:RUNX family TFs that would catalyze chromatin accessibility changes. Alternatively, these effects may be due to chromatin changes coordinated by Fli1 itself. For example, the EWS-FLI1 fusion recruits the BAF complex to initiate chromatin changes in cancer cells ( Boulay et al., 2017 9. Boulay, G. ∙ Sandoval, G.J. ∙ Riggi, N. ... Cancer-Specific Retargeting of BAF Complexes by a Prion-like Domain Cell. 2017; 171 :163-178.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the role of Fli1 in CD8 + T cells likely involves a chromatin accessibility-based mechanism to restrain ETS:RUNX driven effector biology, though other effects through IRF1/IRF2 may also exist.
The current studies demonstrate a major beneficial effect of loss of Fli1 on protective immunity in multiple settings of infection and cancer. The absence of Fli1 consistently improved protective immunity across models. Of particular relevance for immunotherapy, deleting Fli1 improved control of both tumor progression and chronic LCMV infection where the induction of exhaustion typically limits immunity. It will be interesting to determine in future studies whether this beneficial effect on tumor immunity is due to increased T cell numbers, the de-repression of T EFF differentiation by loss of Fli1, enhanced transcription of specific effector gene programs, or a combination of these effects. It is also possible that enhanced Runx3 activity fosters more efficient tissue residency, a change that would be consistent with improved immunity in the influenza virus model. Finally, given the ability to apply CRISPR-mediated genetic manipulations in cellular therapy settings ( Stadtmauer et al., 2020 82. Stadtmauer, E.A. ∙ Fraietta, J.A. ∙ Davis, M.M. ... CRISPR-engineered T cells in patients with refractory cancer Science. 2020; 367 :eaba7365 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2019 100. Xu, L. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Liu, Y. ... CRISPR-Edited Stem Cells in a Patient with HIV and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 381 :1240-1247 Crossref Scopus (105) PubMed Google Scholar ), it might be possible to envision clinical benefits with CAR T cells by targeting Fli1 or related pathways.
Thus, the OpTICS platform provides a highly robust in vivo platform to screen genes involved in regulating CD8 + T cell differentiation as it relates to tumor immunotherapy. This highly focused and optimized platform allows for a 20- to 100-fold enrichment of sgRNA detection and considerable resolution for gain-of-function screening. In addition to the role of Fli1 revealed here, many other potential targets for exploration exist from this screen. Moreover, using OpTICS to extend from this TF focused biology to other areas of cellular biology should provide a robust platform for future discovery.

CD4 CRE , LSL-Cas9-GFP and Constitutive-Cas9-GFP mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. LSL-Cas9-GFP mice were bred to CD4 CRE mice and TCR transgenic P14 C57BL/6 mice (TCR specific for LCMV D b GP 33–41 ) and backcrossed for more than 6 generations before use. Constitutive-Cas9-GFP mice were bred to TCR transgenic P14 C57BL/6 mice. Constitutive-Cas9-GFP mice for recipient use were bred in house. 6-8 week-old C57BL/6 Ly5.2CR (CD45.1) or C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice were purchased from NCI. 6 week-old C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. 5-7 week-old Rag2 −/− C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. Recipient mice for LCMV challenge were from NCI unless otherwise noted in the figure legends. Both male and female mice were used unless otherwise noted. All mice were used in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines for the University of Pennsylvania.
Mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2 × 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) Arm or intravenously (i.v.) with 4 × 10 6 PFU Cl13. Plaque assay for LCMV Cl13 to detect viral load was processed as previously described ( Pauken et al., 2016 60. Pauken, K.E. ∙ Sammons, M.A. ∙ Odorizzi, P.M. ... Epigenetic stability of exhausted T cells limits durability of reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade Science. 2016; 354 :1160-1165 Crossref Scopus (432) PubMed Google Scholar ). Basically, tissues were homogenized, and either 1:10, 1:10 2 , 1:10 3 dilution of serum or 1:10, 1:10 2 , 1:10 3 , 1:10 4 , 1:10 5 and 1:10 6 dilution of homogenized tissue-contained media were incubated on adherent Vero cells for 1 hr. Cells were overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of medium and 1% agarose and cultured for 4 days. Plaques (PFUs) were counted after overlaying with a 9.5:9.5:1 mixture of medium:1% agarose:neutral red for 16 hr.
LM expressing D b GP33( LM GP33 ) concentration was measured by optical density (OD) after overnight culture in brain heart infusion (BHI) media (1 OD refers to 8 × 10 8 LM GP33 ). Each recipient mouse was infected intravenously (i.v.) with 1 × 10 5 CFU LM -gp33. Male mice were used for these LM GP33 experimentts. Adjusted survival was based on mice remaining above the mandatory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) euthanasia cut off of 30% weight loss. LM GP33 colony formation per unit calculation for bacteria load was calculated using 2% agarose plate with complete BHI media. Infected organs are smashed in 1ml BHI media and 20ul(2%) of the organs are taken out. 1:10, 1:10 2 , 1:10 3 , 1:10 4 , 1:10 5 and 1:10 6 dilution of the infected organ BHI media are made and plated on the BHI agarose plates. Colonies are counted after 16 hours incubation of the plates in 37°C incubator.
Mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with PR8 strain expressing D b GP33 (PR8 GP33 ) at a dose of 3.0 LD50. Male mice were used for these PR8 GP33 experiments. Mice were anesthetized before i.n. infection. PR8 viral qPCR detection for viral RNA amount was calculated as previously described ( Laidlaw et al., 2013 42. Laidlaw, B.J. ∙ Decman, V. ∙ Ali, M.-A.A. ... Cooperativity between CD8 + T cells, non-neutralizing antibodies, and alveolar macrophages is important for heterosubtypic influenza virus immunity PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9 :e1003207 Crossref Scopus (86) PubMed Google Scholar ). Total RNA (including host and viral RNA) was purified from lungs of PR8 GP33 infected mice as well as the paired spleen, followed by reverse transcriptions with random primers. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on cDNA targeting the influenza PA protein with technical triplicate. Influenza viral RNA amount was standardized using influenza PA protein cDNA standards.
B16F10 melanoma cells expressing the LCMV GP 33-41 epitope (B16F10-gp33) ( Prévost-Blondel et al., 1998 65. Prévost-Blondel, A. ∙ Zimmermann, C. ∙ Stemmer, C. ... Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes exhibiting high ex vivo cytolytic activity fail to prevent murine melanoma tumor growth in vivo J. Immunol. 1998; 161 :2187-2194 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin and L-glutamine. Tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of Rag2 −/− mice at 1 × 10 5 cells/recipient and of Cas9 + B6 mice at 2 × 10 5 cells/recipient. Activated sgRNA + C9P14 cells are sorted and transferred into recipient mice at a dose of 1 × 10 6 cells/recipient (for Rag2 −/− ) or 3 × 10 6 cells/recipient (for Cas9 + ). Tumor size was measured using digital calipers every 2-3 days after inoculation.
In this study, SpCas9 sgRNA was expressed using pSL21-VEX or pSL21-mCherry (U6-sgRNA-EFS-VEX or U6-sgRNA-EFS-mCherry, will be available through Addgene). To generate the pSL21-VEX or pSL21-mCherry, U6-sgRNA expression cassette was PCR cloned from LRG2.1 into a retroviral vector MSCV-Neo, followed by swapping the Neo selection marker with a VEX or mCherry fluorescence reporter. sgRNAs were cloned by annealing two DNA oligos and T4 DNA ligation into a Bbs1- digested pSL21-VEX or pSL21-mCherry vector. To improve U6 promoter transcription efficiency, an additional 5′ G nucleotide was added to all sgRNA oligo designs that did not already start with a 5′ G. Runx1 and Runx3 constructs are built on the MIGR or MSCV-mCherry constructs, empty MIGR or MSCV-mCherry are used as the controls for these vectors.
CD8 + T cells were purified from spleens by negative selection using EasySep Mouse CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were stimulated with 100 U/mL recombinant human IL-2, 1 μg/mL anti-mouse CD3ε, and 5 μg/mL anti-mouse CD28 in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 100 μM non-essential amino acids (NEAA), 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol.
RVs were produced in 293T cells with MSCV and pCL-Eco plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000. RV transduction was performed as described ( Kurachi et al., 2017 39. Kurachi, M. ∙ Kurachi, J. ∙ Chen, Z. ... Optimized retroviral transduction of mouse T cells for in vivo assessment of gene function Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12 :1980-1998 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, CD8 + T cells were purified from spleens of P14 mice using EasySep™ Mouse CD8 + T Cell Isolation Kit. After 18-24 hr of in vitro stimulation, P14 cells were transduced with RV in the presence of polybrene (0.5 μg/ml) during spin infection (2,000 g for 60 min at 32°C) following incubation at 37°C for 6 hr for single RV and sgRNA library, or 12 hr for double RV. RV-transduced P14 cells were adoptively transferred into recipient mice that were infected 24-48 hr prior to transfer.
For mouse experiments, tissues were processed, single cell suspensions obtained, and cells were stained as described ( Wherry et al., 2003 95. Wherry, E.J. ∙ Teichgräber, V. ∙ Becker, T.C. ... Lineage relationship and protective immunity of memory CD8 T cell subsets Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4 :225-234 Crossref Scopus (1371) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mouse cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD cell stain (Invitrogen) and antibodies targeting surface or intracellular proteins. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed after 5 hr ex vivo stimulation with GP 33-41 peptide in the presence of GolgiPlug, GolgiStop and anti-CD107a. After stimulation, cells were stained with surface antibodies, followed by fixation with Fixation/Permeabilization Buffer and then stained with intracellular antibodies for TNF, IFN-γ and MIP1α using Permeabilization Wash Buffer according to manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry was performed with an LSRII. Cell sorting experiments were performed with a BD-Aria sorter, with 70-micron nozzle and a 4°C circulating cool-down system for sequencing, western and TIDE assays.
For sorting RV + cells optimized sorting in the transfer experiments, the BD Aria Sorter was set at 37°C and 100-micron nozzle, with a flow rate lower than 3.0. 3 X 10 6 Cells are concentrated in 300ul 10% complete RPMI with 100 U/mL recombinant human IL-2 during sorting. 37°C pre-warmed collection tubes with 10% complete RPMI (100 U/ml IL-2) are used. Sorted cells are washed by 37°C warm pure RPMI before transferring into recipients.
At least 1 × 10 4 Cas9 + sgRNA + T cell pellets were frozen down. Genomic DNA was isolated from these samples using QIAmp DNA Mini Kit. A TIDE PCR, using 2x Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix and primers designed around the genome region of the sgRNA target part was run for each sample to extract the guide region from the genome DNA; the resulting products were then gel verified, PCR purified, and sent for Sanger sequencing.
2 × 10 5 T cells were sorted using FACS machine and the pellets were frozen down. Protein from these samples was extracted and denatured by boiling at 95°C in 2X working loading sample buffer (1M Tris-HCl, 10% SDS, Glycerol, 10% Bromophenol blue). Lysate was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Primary Fli1 (1:200) and GAPDH (1:1000) antibodies were staining over night, followed 1:5000 secondary antibody staining on the next day.

4-5 sgRNA were designed against individual DNA binding domains or other functional domains of each TF based on the domain sequence information retrieved from NCBI Conserved Domains Database. All of the sgRNA oligos, including positive and negative control sgRNAs, were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and pooled in equal molarity. The pooled sgRNA oligos were then amplified by PCR and cloned into BsmBI-digested SL21 vector using Gibson Assembly Kit. To verify the identity and relative representation of sgRNAs in the pooled plasmids, a deep-sequencing analysis was performed on a MiSeq instrument. We confirmed that 100% of the designed sgRNAs were cloned in the SL21 vector and the abundance of > 95% of individual sgRNA constructs was within 5-fold of the mean (data not shown).
On day 0, C9P14 cells were isolated from the spleens and lymph nodes of CD45.2 + C9P14 mice and processed to standard T cell activation protocol using anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-2; on the same day, naive CD45.1 + recipient mice were infected by LCMV. On D1 p.i., activated C9P14 cells were transduced by RV-sgRNA library and incubated for 6 hours before washing out the RV supernatant. 18-24 hours later, the transduced sgRNA + Cas9 + cells were sorted. Then, 10% of the sgRNA + Cas9 + T cells were frozen down as a D2 baseline (T0 time point) control prior to any selection, while 90% of the cells are transfer to the infected recipients (maximum 1X10 5 cells/recipient). On the T1 time point (D8 in the graph), sgRNA + Cas9 + CD45.2 + T cells were sorted out from multiple organs of the recipients. For the test screening, both male and female donor/recipient mice were used; for the 120-TF library screening, male mice were used.
To quantify the sgRNA abundance of reference and end time points, the sgRNA cassette was PCR amplified from genomic DNA using high-fidelity polymerase. The PCR product was end-repaired by T4 DNA polymerase, DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment, and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Next, a 3′ A-overhang was then added to the ends of blunted DNA fragments with Klenow Fragment (3′-5′ exo-). The DNA fragments were ligated to diversity-increased custom barcodes with Quick ligation kit. Illumina paired-end sequencing adaptors were attached to the barcoded ligated products through PCR reaction with high-fidelity polymerase. The final product was quantified by Bioanalyzer Agilent DNA 1000 and pooled together in equal molar ratio and pair-end sequenced by using MiSeq (Illumina) with MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 150-cycle (Illumina).
The sequencing data was de-multiplexed and trimmed to contain only the sgRNA sequence cassettes. The read count of each individual sgRNA was calculated with no mismatches and compared to the sequence of reference sgRNA as described previously ( Shi et al., 2015 76. Shi, J. ∙ Wang, E. ∙ Milazzo, J.P. ... Discovery of cancer drug targets by CRISPR-Cas9 screening of protein domains Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33 :661-667 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data of each sample were normalized to the same read account. Waterfall plots ( Figure 1 B): For each gene, mean of the log2 fold changes from multiple sgRNA was computed. Heatmap ( Figure 1 C): For each gene, mean of the log10 fold changes from multiple sgRNA was computed. In the matrix of genes by conditions, quantile normalization was performed across conditions such that each condition has the same distribution of values. Genes were ordered by the mean value of each row. Histogram ( Figure 1 D): For each condition, the background (gray bars and the histogram) was plotted for sgRNAs of all the genes. The 5% and 95% intervals were extracted by using the 5th percentile and 95th percentile of background values. The red bars show the log folds change for sgRNAs for one gene (or the control)
At D8 p.i. with Cl13, CD8 + T cells were isolated from spleens of infected recipients. Male mice were used for these experiments. VEX + GFP + cells are sorted using FACS with > 95% purity. RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit with 2 × 10 4 cell per sample. cDNA libraries were generated using SMARTSeq V4 Ultra Low kit. Libraries were quantified by qPCR using a KAPA Library Quant Kit (KAPA Biosystems). Normalized libraries were pooled, diluted to 1.8pg/ml loaded onto a TG NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2 (150 cycles, 130M reads, Illumina) and paired-end sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 550 (Illumina). The estimated read depth per sample is 15M reads.
Raw FASTQ files from RNaseq paired-end sequencing were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 reference genome using Kallisto ( https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/ ). Sequencing reads were read in for 19357 genes and 8 samples. Genes with zero read count in more than three conditions were filtered out. 13628 genes remained after this step. Then, differential expression analysis was run using DESeq 2 package. The expression of 1440 genes were found to significantly differ between the two conditions at a BH corrected P value < 0.05. GO enrichment analysis was performed using ClusterProfiler. The top 20 most enriched pathways are shown in the plot. GSEA was performed using the Broad Institute software ( http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp ). Enrichment scores were calculated by comparing sgCtrl to sgFli1 groups.

ATACseq sample preparation was performed as described with minor modifications ( Buenrostro et al., 2013 11. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ... Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position Nat Methods. 2013; 10 :1213-1218 Crossref Scopus (2072) PubMed Google Scholar ). Male mice were used for these experiments. VEX + GFP + cells were sorted using FACS with > 95% purity. Sorted cells (2.5 × 10 4 ) were washed twice in cold PBS and resuspended in 50 μL of cold lysis buffer (10nM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween). Lysates were centrifuge (750xg, 10min, 4°C) and nuclei were resuspended in 50 μL of transposition reaction mix (TD buffer [25 μl], Tn5 Transposase [2.5 μl], nuclease-free water [22.5 μl]; (Illumina)) and incubated for 30min at 37°C. Transposed DNA fragments were purified using a QIAGEN Reaction MiniElute Kit, barcoded with NEXTERA dual indexes (Illumina) and amplified by PCR for 11 cycles using NEBNext High Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs). PCR products were purified using a PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and amplified fragment sizes were verified on a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) using High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTapes (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were quantified by qPCR using a KAPA Library Quant Kit (KAPA Biosystems). Normalized libraries were pooled, diluted to 1.8pg/ml loaded onto a TG NextSeq 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2 (150 cycles, 130M reads, Illumina) and paired-end sequencing was performed on a NextSeq 550 (Illumina). Estimation read depth per sample is 10M reads.
Raw ATACseq FASTQ files from paired-end sequencing were processed using the script available at the following repository ( https://github.com/wherrylab/jogiles_ATAC ). Samples were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 reference genome using Bowtie2. We used samtools to remove unmapped, unpaired, mitochondrial reads. ENCODE blacklist regions were also removed ( https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists ). PCR duplicates were removed using Picard. Peak calling was performed using MACS v2 (FDR q-value 0.01). For each experiment, we combined peaks of all samples to create a union peak list and merged overlapping peaks with BedTools merge . The number of reads in each peak was determined using BedTools coverage. Differentially accessible regions were identified following DESeq2 normalization using an FDR cut-off < 0.05 unless otherwise indicated. Motif enrichment was calculated using HOMER (default parameters) on peaks differentially accessible across sgCtrl group and sgFli1 group. Transcription binding site prediction analysis was performed using known motif discovery strategy.
CUT&RUN experiments were performed as previously described ( Skene et al., 2018 81. Skene, P.J. ∙ Henikoff, J.G. ∙ Henikoff, S. Targeted in situ genome-wide profiling with high efficiency for low cell numbers Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :1006-1019 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Briefly, 2x10 5 sorted cells were washed twice with 1 mL of cold wash buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, and protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma) in 1.5ml tubes. Cells were then resuspended in 1 mL of cold wash buffer and incubated with 10 μL of BioMagPlus Concanavalin A (Bangs laboratories) by rotating at 4°C for 25 min to allow the cells to bind. Tubes were placed on a magnetic stand and liquid was removed after the solution turned clear. Primary antibody in 250 μL of cold antibody buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% digitonin, and protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma) was added to the tubes and rotated at 4°C overnight. The next day, after washing cells once with 1 mL of cold wash buffer, protein A-MNase (pA-MN) in 250 μL of cold digitonin buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 0.1% digitonin, and protease inhibitor cocktails from Sigma) was added to the tube and rotate at 4°C for 1 h. To wash away unbound pA-MN, cells were washed twice with 1 mL of cold digitonin buffer, and then resuspended in 150 μL of cold digitonin buffer. The tubes were placed on a pre-cooled metal block. To initiate pA-MN digestion, 3 μL of 0.1 M CaCl 2 was mixed with cells in 150 μL cold digitonin buffer by gently flicking the tubes 10 times. Tubes were immediately placed back in the metal block. After 30 min incubation, the digestion was stopped by adding 150 μL of 2x stop buffer (340 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 4 mM EGTA, 0.02% Digitonin, 50 μg/ml RNase A, 50 μg/ml Glycogen, and 4 pg/ml yeast heterologous spike-in DNA). Target chromatin was released by incubating the tubes on a heat block at 37°C for 10 min. Supernatant was spun at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4°C and transferred to a new tube. Chromatin was incubated with 3 μL of 10% SDS and 2.5 μL of 20 mg/ml proteinase K at 70°C for 10 min, followed by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol extraction. Upper phase containing DNA was mixed with 20 μg of glycogen and incubated with 750 μL of cold 100% ethanol at −20°C overnight. DNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. DNA pellets was washed once by cold 100% ethanol, air-dried, and stored at −20°C for library preparation. Protein A-MNase (batch 6, use at 1:200) and yeast heterologous spike-in DNA were kindly provided by Dr. Steve Henikoff. The antibodies used were: Fli1, ab15289, used at 1:50 (abcam) and guinea pig anti-rabbit IgG, used at 1:100, ABIN101961 (antibodies-online).
CUT&RUN DNA library was prepared as previously descried ( Liu et al., 2018 46. Liu, N. ∙ Hargreaves, V.V. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... Direct Promoter Repression by BCL11A Controls the Fetal to Adult Hemoglobin Switch Cell. 2018; 173 :430-442.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ) with slight modifications. Briefly, all DNA precipitated from pA-MN digestion was used for library preparation using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB). The adaptor was diluted to 1:25 for adaptor ligation. DNA was barcoded and amplified for 14 PCR cycle, and DNA library was cleaned up by AMPure XP beads ( Liu et al., 2018 46. Liu, N. ∙ Hargreaves, V.V. ∙ Zhu, Q. ... Direct Promoter Repression by BCL11A Controls the Fetal to Adult Hemoglobin Switch Cell. 2018; 173 :430-442.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). The library quality was checked with Qubit and bioanalyzer, and the quantity of the library was determined by qPCR using NEBNext Library Quant Kit for Illumina (NEB) according to manufacture’s instruction. Eighteen barcoded libraries were pooled at equal molarity and sequenced in the NextSeq 550 platform with NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit (75 cycles) v2.5 kit. Paired-end sequencing was carried out (42:6:0:42).
Paired-end reads were aligned to mm10 reference genome using Bowtie2 v2.3.4.1 with options suggested by Skene and Henikoff ( Skene et al., 2018 81. Skene, P.J. ∙ Henikoff, J.G. ∙ Henikoff, S. Targeted in situ genome-wide profiling with high efficiency for low cell numbers Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :1006-1019 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Picard tools v1.96 was used to remove presumed PCR duplicates using the MarkDuplicates command. Bam files containing uniquely mapped reads were created using Samtools v1.1. For downstream analysis, biological replicates (3 per condition) were merged at this step. Bedtools v2.28.0 was used to generate fragment BED files with size 40bp-500bp. Blacklist regions, random chromosomes, and mitochondria were removed. Filtered BED files were used for downstream analysis. Read per million (RPM) normalized bigwig files were created using bedGraphToBigWig (UCSC) and were used to visualize binding signals. Peaks were called using MACS v2.1 using the broadPeak setting with p value cutoff of 1e-8, -f BEDPE and IgG as controls. Genes proximal to peaks were annotated against the mm10 genome using annotatePeaks.pl from HOMER v4. Fli1 binding motifs were identified using findMotifsGenome.pl from HOMER v4. Venn diagram of comparison with ATAC-Seq peaks was plotted using Bioconductor package ChIPpeakAnno. Heatmap was generated using Bioconductor package ComplexHeatmap.
Statistical significance was calculated with unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test by Prism 7 (GraphPad Software). The number of mice used per experiment, number of experimental repeats and P values are indicated in the figure legends.
