Title: Cranial Suture Regeneration Mitigates Skull and Neurocognitive Defects in Craniosynostosis


Abstract: Summary

Craniosynostosis results from premature fusion of the cranial suture(s), which contain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are crucial for calvarial expansion in coordination with brain growth. Infants with craniosynostosis have skull dysmorphology, increased intracranial pressure, and complications such as neurocognitive impairment that compromise quality of life. Animal models recapitulating these phenotypes are lacking, hampering development of urgently needed innovative therapies. Here, we show that Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis have increased intracranial pressure and neurocognitive behavioral abnormalities, recapitulating features of human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Using a biodegradable material combined with MSCs, we successfully regenerated a functional cranial suture that corrects skull deformity, normalizes intracranial pressure, and rescues neurocognitive behavior deficits. The regenerated suture creates a niche into which endogenous MSCs migrated, sustaining calvarial bone homeostasis and repair. MSC-based cranial suture regeneration offers a paradigm shift in treatment to reverse skull and neurocognitive abnormalities in this devastating disease.

Section: Introduction

Craniosynostosis is a common disorder in which one or more calvarial sutures, the fibrous joints that separate the skull bones, fuse prematurely in infancy. This causes abnormal skull growth, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), delayed brain development, and often impaired cognitive functions ( Morriss-Kay and Wilkie, 2005 38. Morriss-Kay, G.M. ∙ Wilkie, A.O. Growth of the normal skull vault and its alteration in craniosynostosis: insights from human genetics and experimental studies J. Anat. 2005; 207 :637-653 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ; Twigg and Wilkie, 2015 55. Twigg, S.R. ∙ Wilkie, A.O. A Genetic-Pathophysiological Framework for Craniosynostosis Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 97 :359-377 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Calvarial suture patency is crucial for allowing the skull to compress during childbirth and accommodating its extensive postnatal growth in concert with the developing brain, which continues into adulthood. Currently, the only treatment for craniosynostosis is complex surgery to correct the skull deformity and prevent its sequelae ( Wolfswinkel et al., 2017 58. Wolfswinkel, E.M. ∙ Howell, L.K. ∙ Fahradyan, A. ... Is Postoperative Intensive Care Unit Care Necessary following Cranial Vault Remodeling for Sagittal Synostosis? Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2017; 140 :1235-1239 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). In many cases, the bones resynostose, necessitating re-operation. There is an immense need for better treatment of craniosynostosis and prevention of resynostosis.
Individuals with craniosynostosis often exhibit neurocognitive dysfunctions and intellectual disabilities ( Gripp et al., 2000 15. Gripp, K.W. ∙ Zackai, E.H. ∙ Stolle, C.A.

A. 2012; 158A :1680-1685 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have mutations in TWIST1 and show preferential loss of the coronal suture. Large deletions including the TWIST1 locus have been associated with learning disabilities and neurocognitive impairment ( Gripp et al., 2000 15. Gripp, K.W. ∙ Zackai, E.H. ∙ Stolle, C.A. Mutations in the human TWIST gene Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15 :479 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Zechi-Ceide et al., 2012 62. Zechi-Ceide, R.M. ∙ Rodrigues, M.G. ∙ Jehee, F.S. ...

A. 2012; 158A :1680-1685 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gain-of-function mutations in ZIC1 or FGFR lead to craniosynostosis and learning disabilities ( Reardon et al., 1997 44. Reardon, W. ∙ Wilkes, D. ∙ Rutland, P. ... Craniosynostosis associated with FGFR3 pro250arg mutation results in a range of clinical presentations including unisutural sporadic craniosynostosis J.

Hum. Genet. 2015; 97 :359-377 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although neurocognitive deficits are more commonly associated with syndromic craniosynostosis, some patients with nonsyndromic single-suture craniosynostosis may develop intellectual disability and developmental delays that vary in severity ( Speltz et al., 2015 53. Speltz, M.L. ∙ Collett, B.R. ∙ Wallace, E.R. ... Intellectual and academic functioning of school-age children with single-suture craniosynostosis Pediatrics. 2015; 135 :e615-e623 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wallace et al., 2016 57.

Attention and executive function in children with and without single-suture craniosynostosis Child Neuropsychol. 2017; 23 :83-98 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies highlight the heterogeneity of these deficits and provide evidence that craniosynostosis alone may cause neurocognitive dysfunction. Overall, premature suture fusion can adversely affect neurocognition, likely because of increased ICP and neuroanatomical changes ( Morriss-Kay and Wilkie, 2005 38. Morriss-Kay, G.M. ∙ Wilkie, A.O. Growth of the normal skull vault and its alteration in craniosynostosis: insights from human genetics and experimental studies J. Anat. 2005; 207 :637-653 Crossref Scopus (373) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, ICP and neurocognition have not been investigated in animal models of craniosynostosis, resulting in a gap in our understanding of this devastating disease. It therefore also remains unknown whether restoring suture patency can improve neurocognitive function.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self-renew and differentiate into an array of different cell types for tissue regeneration ( Chan et al., 2018 9. Chan, C.K.F. ∙ Gulati, G.S. ∙ Sinha, R. ...

Stem cells of the suture mesenchyme in craniofacial bone development, repair and regeneration Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10526 Crossref Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recently reported that Gli1 + cells are an indispensable MSC source within cranial sutures ( Zhao et al., 2015 64. Zhao, H. ∙ Feng, J. ∙ Ho, T.V. ... The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). They support craniofacial bone turnover, repair, and regeneration in adult mice ( Guo et al., 2018 16. Guo, Y. ∙ Yuan, Y. ∙ Wu, L. ... BMP-IHH-mediated interplay between mesenchymal stem cells and osteoclasts supports calvarial bone homeostasis and repair Bone Res. 2018; 6 :30 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Park et al., 2016 42.

Zhao, H. ∙ Feng, J. ∙ Ho, T.V. ... The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we have demonstrated that there is premature loss of Gli1 + cells prior to coronal suture fusion in Twist1 +/− mice ( Zhao et al., 2015 64. Zhao, H. ∙ Feng, J. ∙ Ho, T.V. ... The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). These studies suggest that restoring MSCs is a potential therapeutic approach for cranial suture regeneration in craniosynostosis. However, this approach presents substantial technical challenges. Previous studies have shown that the method of MSC delivery and the biomaterial(s) used in the defect area are crucial ( Zhao and Chai, 2015 63. Zhao, H. ∙ Chai, Y. Stem Cells in Teeth and Craniofacial Bones J. Dent. Res. 2015; 94 :1495-1501 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is not well understood how MSCs may participate in the cranial suture regeneration process or what the ideal biomaterials are to support them.
In this study, we show that premature fusion of the coronal suture led to increased ICP and neurocognitive abnormalities in Twist1 +/− mice, recapitulating symptoms of Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in humans. Using this clinically highly relevant mouse model, we demonstrated that Gli1 + MSCs combined with modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) can support coronal suture regeneration. Endogenous MSCs migrated to the regenerated suture area to sustain its function in calvarial tissue homeostasis and repair. Significantly, suture regeneration reduced ICP, partially alleviated calvarial deformity, and improved neurocognitive function. Because TWIST1 haploinsufficiency is associated with craniosynostosis in patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, our discovery is highly relevant for clinical translation and offers a unique approach for improving the quality of life for individuals with craniosynostosis.

Section: Results

To investigate whether craniosynostosis can lead to intracranial hypertension and neurocognitive behavioral abnormalities in Twist1 +/− mice, as reported in humans ( Millichap, 2015 36. Millichap, J.G. Cognitive Development of Children with Craniosynostosis Pediatr. Neurol. Briefs. 2015; 29 :47 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we first measured the ICP in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis (referred to as MUT) and wild-type (WT) littermate controls ( Figure 1 A) at 2 months of age. Twist1 +/− mice had significantly increased ICP compared with the WT ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Then we conducted a battery of cognitive behavioral tests. Data from male and female mice were combined for the statistical analyses because no sex-biased preference was observed ( Figures S1 B–S1G). In open field and elevated plus maze tests, Twist1 +/− mice spent comparable times in the center area of the open field arena ( Figure S1 I) and similar times and entries in the open arms of the elevated plus maze as their WT littermates ( Figures S5 E–S5G), which indicated that Twist1 +/− mice did not have unusual levels of anxiety.
In the novel object test ( Figure 1 F), the preference for a novel object was impaired significantly in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis compared with WT controls ( Figures 1 G and 1H), suggesting a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory deficit. To assess social cognition, a three-chamber test was performed ( Figure 1 I). The preferences for investigating the mouse versus empty cage and novel versus familiar mouse were decreased significantly in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis ( Figures 1 J and 1K), indicating impaired sociability and social novelty. To exclude the possibility that the impaired cognitive functions in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis may be caused by olfactory dysfunction, we performed an odor discrimination/habituation test ( Figure S5 H) and found that Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis could distinguish among and habituate to nonsocial and social odors to the same degree as their WT littermates, which suggested that they had normal olfaction ( Figure S5 I). We examined motor learning ability using a rotarod test ( Figure 1 D). WT control mice exhibited an increased latency to falling off the accelerating rotarod (4–40 rpm in 5 min) over four consecutive days, indicating active learning ( Figure 1 E). In contrast, Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis did not exhibit obvious improvement, suggesting a significant motor learning deficit. We next measured motor functions and did not find an obvious difference in grip strength ( Figure S5 D) or total distance traveled in the open field arena ( Figure S1 H), which suggested normal motor strength of Twist1 +/− mice with suture fusion. These results suggest that Twist1 +/− mice have neurocognitive dysfunction. We suspected that these deficits were mediated by their elevated ICP because Twist1 expression is not detected in the brain in adult mice, so its haploinsufficiency is unlikely to have a direct effect on neurocognition ( Figure S1 A).
To optimize formulation of a scaffold for Gli1 + cells to support regeneration of a new coronal suture in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis, we compared several different biomaterials. We tested different formulations of GelMA modified with Matrigel and collagen I (COL-I). GelMA has excellent biocompatibility and is easy to use in a surgical setting because it conforms to defects and can be light-cured in seconds ( Noshadi et al., 2017 40. Noshadi, I. ∙ Hong, S. ∙ Sullivan, K.E. ... In vitro and in vivo analysis of visible light crosslinkable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels Biomater. Sci. 2017; 5 :2093-2105 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Addition of Matrigel promotes the spread of cells in the scaffold, whereas COL-I helps form a suitable suture space, as shown below. Before settling on the final formulation, we tested some variations: (1) pure GelMA, (2) GelMA:Matrigel at a ratio of 5:1, (3) GelMA:Matrigel at 2:1, (4) GelMA:Matrigel at 1:1, (5) GelMA:Matrigel at 1:2, and (6) pure Matrigel. Pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1) had a higher compressive modulus than the other materials ( Figure S2 A), which would better maintain the space between bones after surgery for suture regeneration. The tensile strength was also tested, and there was no significant difference between pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1), whereas the remaining four groups were too soft to be measured. After being soaked/rinsed for 3 weeks, the remaining mass of pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1) remained higher than that of other groups (i.e., they had the lowest degradation rate), which would also help prevent suture refusion after surgery ( Figure S2 B). Diffusional permeability testing showed that pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel (5:1) had the lowest diffusional ability, which may help to block intrusion of cytokines, such as angiogenesis factors that could promote bone formation and suture refusion ( Figure S2 C). Using pure Matrigel, which had the highest diffusional permeability, suture refusion occurred in as soon as 1 month ( Figure S3 J). The swelling ratio showed results similar to the diffusional permeability testing, which suggested that a solution like blood could more easily get into the pure Matrigel and promote bone formation, whereas there was no significant difference between the other five groups ( Figure S2 D). Taking all these properties into account, we concluded that pure GelMA and GelMA:Matrigel at a 5:1 ratio have the most favorable properties for suture regeneration. It is important to note that Matrigel, a mouse tumor matrix preparation, may be limited in its application for human use.
We compared GelMA:Matrigel:COL-I at a ratio of 10:2:1 (M-GM) to pure GelMA (GM) and GelMA:Matrigel at a ratio of 5:1 (GM-Ma). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ( Figure S2 F) and cellular viability staining ( Figure S2 G) showed that cells could spread more easily in GM-Ma and M-GM in three-dimensional culture. After six months, M-GM with MSCs formed a regenerated suture more similar to a natural one ( Figures S2 H–S2L), which suggested that COL-I could attract osteo-related cells in later stages to form a suitable space ( Figures S2 J and S2L). None of the crucial material properties were changed significantly by adding COL-I to GM-Ma ( Figures S2 M–S2P). Ultimately, these results suggest that M-GM provides a suitable environment for MSC-mediated suture regeneration.
To investigate whether Gli1 + MSCs retained their stemness after 10 days of culture in vitro , a colony-forming assay was performed. Gli1 + MSCs formed colonies ( Figure S2 E) and could differentiate toward osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages ( Zhao et al., 2015 64. Zhao, H. ∙ Feng, J. ∙ Ho, T.V. ... The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ), confirming their stemness.
To test whether Gli1 + MSCs combined with M-GM can support coronal suture regeneration in Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion ( Figures 2 A and 2C), we generated a rectangular defect 0.3–0.4 mm wide over each of the fused coronal sutures ( Figures 2 B and 2D). Gli1 + cells with M-GM (M-GM+stem cells (SCs) were implanted into the defect on the right side ( Figures 2 E and 2F). The defect on the opposite side was (1) left empty or filled with (2) pure M-GM, (3) suture mesenchymal cells from Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-DTA GFP mice mixed with M-GM (M-GM+diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) cells), (4) heat-inactivated Gli1 + cells (H-SCs) mixed with M-GM (M-GM+H-SCs), or (5) Gli1 + cells mixed with Matrigel (Ma+SCs).
One month after surgery, there was already new bone formation in the blank controls ( Figures 2 G and 2G1), whereas spaces were found between the two bones filled with M-GM alone or with M-GM+SCs ( Figures 2 H, 2H1, and 2H2). The bone matured in the blank controls 3 months post-surgery ( Figures 2 I and 2I1), and the lateral bony edges of defects began to meet in the M-GM group ( Figures 2 J and 2J1). In contrast, the bone edges remained separated in the M-GM+SC group ( Figures 2 J and 2J2). Six months post-surgery, when the defect was left empty or filled only with M-GM, the suture sites had re-fused (Figures 2K1 and 2L1). At the same time point, the bones were still separated in defects filled with M-GM+SCs ( Figures 2 K and 2L). Even after 1 year, this regenerated suture remained patent ( Figure S3 G). All of the other groups experienced resynostosis, including those filled with M-GM+DTA cells ( Figure S3 H), heat-inactivated M-GM+H-SCs ( Figure S3 I), and Ma+SCs ( Figure S3 J), clearly indicating the crucial roles played by live Gli1 + MSCs and M-GM in successful suture regeneration.
Histological analysis ( Figure 2 M) confirmed disappearance of the coronal suture as well as the presence of thicker bone in the empty defects 1 month post-surgery. In defects filled with M-GM alone, fibrous tissue with some bony islands formed, whereas suture-like tissue could be seen between bone edges in the MGM+SC group. Three months post-surgery, the porous bone structure of the empty defects was replaced by lamellar bone. The bony margins began to connect in the M-GM group and became thicker 6 months post-surgery. In the M-GM+SC group, the gap between the bones remained and new fibrous suture formed within 6 months post-surgery ( Figure 2 M).
Next we investigated how implanted Gli1 + MSCs may contribute to suture regeneration in Twist1 +/− mice ( Figure 2 N). One month post-surgery, the majority of implanted Gli1 + MSCs were present in the center of the defect, whereas a few appeared in the osteogenic fronts, periosteum, and dura ( Figure 2 N, left). Interestingly, in defects filled with M-GM+SCs 3 months post-surgery, large numbers of tdTomato-labeled cells were detectable in the osteogenic fronts, periosteum, and dura mater near the suture ( Figure 2 N, center). A few labeled osteocytes were detected near the osteogenic fronts, whereas some remained in the center of the regenerated suture. Six months post-surgery ( Figure 2 N, right), progeny of implanted Gli1 + MSCs were detectable in the periosteum, dura , and osteocytes of calvaria further away from the defect (white arrowhead), and there were some endogenous Gli1 + MSCs (in green) in the middle of the regenerated suture. Nearly 1 year post-surgery, the majority of the implanted Gli1 + MSCs took part in formation of the nearby tissues, with only a few Gli1 + cells remaining in the center of the suture ( Figure S3 G). In the defects left empty or filled with M-GM alone, the suture had nearly or totally re-fused, and Runx2 + cells were numerous at all stages ( Figures S3 E and S3F). These results suggest that the implanted Gli1 + MSCs in the regenerated suture may contribute to turnover of the osteogenic fronts, periosteum, and dura to support calvarial tissue homeostasis.
As shown in Figures 2 N and S3 G, some Gli1 + cells (in green) were present in addition to the implanted Gli1 + MSCs (tdTomato + ) in the regenerated suture. The ratio of endogenous to implanted labeled cells increased over time, which suggests that endogenous stem/progenitor cells also played roles in sustaining suture regeneration and function. To investigate the source of these cells, the dura mater under the defect was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prior to implantation of Gli1 + MSCs and M-GM in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis ( Figure 3 A). Exogenous and endogenous Gli1 + cells were present in the suture region 4 weeks post-surgery ( Figures 3 B–3D). To confirm whether MSCs from the dura contributed to the newly regenerated suture, a Parafilm membrane with 10-nm pores was placed between the dura and the calvarial bone to block migration of endogenous MSCs into the suture ( Figure 3 E). Six weeks post-surgery, the suture area was almost re-fused in the group with the Parafilm membrane (asterisks in Figures 3 F–3F3), in contrast to the group without the Parafilm membrane, in which the suture space was maintained ( Figure 2 ). Kidney capsule transplantation of calvarial explants also indicated that M-GM+MSCs cannot regenerate a suture following removal of the dura . The defect in the explanted bone was filled with bone 6 weeks post-transplantation ( Figures 3 G and 3H–3H2). These data clearly suggest that endogenous Gli1 + MSCs, in conjunction with implanted Gli1 + MSCs, help sustain the regenerated suture in Twist1 +/− mice ( Figure 3 I).
Although Twist1 is known to maintain cranial suture MSCs and suture patency during embryonic development, its role in regulating postnatal MSCs in the cranial suture remains unclear. To test the functional requirement of Twist1 in regulating suture MSC fate in adults, we generated Gli1CreER;Twist1 fl/fl mice. Loss of Twist1 in Gli1 + cells did not lead to craniosynostosis in adult Gli1CreER;Twist1 fl/fl mice ( Figures S3 O and S3P). This suggests that Twist1’s postnatal functions are not essential, which may partially explain why implanted Gli1 + MSCs, together with endogenous dura -derived Twist1 +/− MSCs, can regenerate a sustainable cranial suture and prevent resynostosis in adult Twist1 +/− mice.
To evaluate how functionally similar coronal sutures regenerated by implanted MSCs and M-GM are to natural sutures, we performed RNA sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles of coronal sutures from WT mice, MUT mice, and endogenous cells from Twist1 +/− mice with regenerated sutures (REG). The WT and MUT groups had distinct gene expression profiles, whereas endogenous cells from the REG group had a gene expression profile more similar to that of a WT coronal suture ( Figure 4 A). t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis confirmed that the gene distributions of WT and endogenous cells from the REG group were closer to each other than to the MUT group ( Figure 4 B). The WT group and endogenous cells in the REG group had ~3,000 upregulated genes and ~6,000 (WT)/~11,000 (REG) downregulated genes relative to the MUT group, whereas there were only 800–900 differentially expressed genes between the WT group and endogenous cells in the REG group ( Figure 4 C). Putative marker genes of suture mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells such as Gli1 , Prrx1 , and Axin2 showed increased expression in endogenous cells of the REG group in comparison with the MUT group ( Figure 4 D). Msx2 , a gene implicated in osteogenesis ( Liu et al., 2019 33. Liu, H. ∙ Chen, B. ∙ Li, Y. microRNA-203 promotes proliferation, differentiation, and migration of osteoblasts by upregulation of Msh homeobox 2 J. Cell. Physiol. 2019; 234 :17639-17648 Crossref Scopus (8) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Ostn , which is specifically expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes in adult bone ( Bord et al., 2005 5. Bord, S. ∙ Ireland, D.C. ∙ Moffatt, P. ... Characterization of osteocrin expression in human bone J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53 :1181-1187 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ), were upregulated in the MUT group and restored in endogenous cells of the REG group compared with the WT group ( Figure 4 D). These results suggested that suture regeneration partially restored the normal suture gene expression profile and that exogenous MSCs induced endogenous cells from the dura to play an important role in restoring a normal gene expression profile.
To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying suture regeneration, we examined Wnt signaling, which plays an important role in craniosynostosis ( Yu et al., 2005 61. Yu, H.M. ∙ Jerchow, B. ∙ Sheu, T.J. ... The role of Axin2 in calvarial morphogenesis and craniosynostosis Development. 2005; 132 :1995-2005 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most genes in the Wnt family were upregulated in the MUT group compared with the endogenous part of the REG group and the WT group ( Figure S4 C), including Wnt1 , Wnt2 , Wnt3 , Wnt3a , Wnt5a , and Wnt9b , whereas a few were downregulated in the MUT group, such as Wnt5b , Wnt7b , and Wnt10b . Axin2, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, was downregulated in Twist1 +/− mice, and its expression was reversed by MSC implantation. These results suggest that Twist1 +/− cranial sutures exhibited upregulation of Wnt signaling that was reversed by MSC implantation. To examine cellular effects of Wnt signaling upregulation, we assessed the osteogenic differentiation ability of suture mesenchymal cells after treating them with a Wnt activator (Wnt agonist 1) or GSK3 inhibitor (activator of Wnt signaling, LY2090314). Runx2 and osteopontin (OPN) expression levels were significantly increased after Wnt signaling was enhanced ( Figures S4 A and S4B). The expression levels of Wnt-related genes could be restored by suture regeneration ( Figure S4 C). These results suggest that Wnt signaling upregulation promotes osteogenic differentiation of suture mesenchymal cells and contributes to craniosynostosis, all of which were reversed by MSC implantation.
To test the stemness of MSCs in the regenerated cranial suture, we harvested suture mesenchymal cells from coronal sutures months post-surgery and demonstrated that these cells were capable of osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic differentiation ( Figure 4 E). Interestingly, the tdTomato-labeled donor cells performed poorly in adipogenic differentiation, which implied that these cells were more committed toward osteochondrogenic lineages.
To evaluate the ability of the regenerated suture to repair bone after injury, we created a defect in the parietal bone next to the regenerated coronal suture 6 months after the first surgery (M-GM+SCs group), whereas on the other side of the calvaria, an identical defect was generated in the parietal bone next to the refused coronal suture (where the defect was left empty) ( Figures 4 F–4H). Three months later, implanted Gli1 + MSCs and endogenous MSCs contributed to bone regeneration ( Figures 4 K1 and 4K2). The defects initially treated with M-GM+SCs were healed completely ( Figure 4 I and white asterisk in Figure 4 K), whereas the blank controls did not heal fully (white asterisks in Figures 4 J and 4J2). These results suggest that regenerating a suture restores its important ability to support tissue regeneration.
To confirm the regeneration and turnover ability of the regenerated suture, we also transplanted calvarial bone containing a newly regenerated suture into another Twist1 +/− mouse after 6 months ( Figures 4 L and 4N). Calvarial bone with refused sutures taken from the blank control side of Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral craniosynostosis was also transplanted as a control ( Figures 4 L and 4M). Three months later, transplants containing the regenerated suture connected with the host bone ( Figures 4 O and 4Q). The newly regenerated tissue grew rapidly and doubled in surface area ( Figures 4 Q1, 4R, and 4S). In contrast, transplants without sutures failed to grow and did not connect with the host bone after 3 months ( Figures 4 O and 4P). These results indicate that the regenerated suture possesses the important ability to support calvarial bone turnover and homeostasis.
To investigate whether regenerating the suture can correct the skull malformations in Twist1 +/− mice, we compared the skull shapes of controls (WT), MUT mice, and REG mice. Established anatomical landmarks ( Ho et al., 2015 18. Ho, T.V. ∙ Iwata, J. ∙ Ho, H.A. ... Integration of comprehensive 3D microCT and signaling analysis reveals differential regulatory mechanisms of craniofacial bone development Dev. Biol. 2015; 400 :180-190 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures S4 D–S4F) were used to analyze the shape of the top of the calvarium (T-calvarium shape; Figure 5 B) and the lateral portion of the calvarium (L-calvarium shape; Figure 5 D) of each group. Skulls of WT control and REG mice were significantly longer in the anterior-posterior direction than those of MUT mice ( Figures 5 A and 5C). Principal-component analysis (PCA) revealed that the WT and REG groups were more similar to each other than to the MUT group in T- and L-calvarial shape ( Figures 5 E and 5F). Although the REG group had a different T-calvarium shape than the WT ( Figure 5 E2; Procrustes distance = 0.0501, p < 0.05), the differences between the MUT and WT/REG groups were greater ( Figure 5 E1; Procrustes distance = 0.1138, p < 0.01 and Figure 5 E3; Procrustes distance = 0.0853, p < 0.01). The first principal component (PC1) of L-calvarium shape, which accounted for 52.101% of the total variation in the sample, placed REG mice between the other two groups ( Figures 5 F–5F3). These results indicated that suture regeneration partially rescued head shape deformity in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis.
To test whether suture regeneration rescues neurocognitive dysfunctions in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis, we first created a comparison group by performing bilateral suture regeneration surgery on WT mice on post-natal day 14. The suture structure was recovered 6 weeks post-surgery ( Figure S7 A) in these mice. We then measured ICP and performed behavioral tests. We did not detect significant changes in ICP ( Figure S7 B), social recognition ( Figures S7 C–S7E), motor learning ( Figure S7 F), or anxiety-related behaviors ( Figures S7 G and S7H) in recovered WT mice. These results confirmed that the surgical procedure per se does not introduce behavioral changes.
We next confirmed that elevated ICP in Twist1 +/− mice was restored after suture regeneration ( Figures 6 A and 6B). We subjected WT and Twist1 +/− mice with or without suture regeneration to a battery of behavioral tests. The novel object test revealed that the impaired preference for novel objects in Twist1 +/− mice was restored after suture regeneration ( Figures 6 D and 6E). The three-chamber test showed that suture regeneration also significantly rescued the sociability and social novelty deficits in Twist1 +/− mice ( Figures 6 F–6H). Despite a trend toward improvement, motor learning was not significantly rescued after suture regeneration ( Figure 6 C). We did not detect changes in general locomotion ( Figures S5 A and S5B), grip strength ( Figure S5 D), or olfaction ( Figures S5 H and S5I) or obvious anxiety-related behaviors ( Figures S5 C and S5E–S5G).
We performed correlation analyses between ICP and cognitive behaviors, including novel object preference, sociability, and social novelty, which were impaired in Twist1 +/− mice. There was a positive correlation between ICP elevation and behavioral deficits, which was reversed by MSC-mediated suture regeneration ( Figures 6 I–6K). These results suggested that suture regeneration rescued neurocognitive dysfunctions in Twist1 +/− mice, likely through reduction of ICP.
To evaluate the importance of surgery timing, we performed suture regeneration surgery on Twist1 +/− mice at post-natal week 8, which corresponds to an adult human ~20 years old ( Semple et al., 2013 47. Semple, B.D. ∙ Blomgren, K. ∙ Gimlin, K. ... Brain development in rodents and humans: Identifying benchmarks of maturation and vulnerability to injury across species Prog. Neurobiol. 2013; 106-107 :1-16 Crossref Scopus (1442) PubMed Google Scholar ). Behavioral studies did not detect significant rescue of neurocognitive deficits when surgery was performed at this later age ( Figures S6 A–S6F), suggesting that the timing of suture regeneration surgery is crucial.
In humans, untreated craniosynostosis can lead to microcephaly ( Blount et al., 2007 4. Blount, J.P. ∙ Louis, R.G. ∙ Tubbs, R.S. ... Pansynostosis: a review Childs Nerv. Syst. 2007; 23 :1103-1109 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kabbani and Raghuveer, 2004 22. Kabbani, H. ∙ Raghuveer, T.S. Craniosynostosis Am. Fam. Physician. 2004; 69 :2863-2870 PubMed Google Scholar ; Lane, 1892 29. Lane, L.C. Pioneer Craniectomy for Relief of Mental Imbecility Due to Premature Sutural Closure and Microcephalus JAMA. 1892; 18 :49-50 Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar ), correlating with high risk of impaired intelligence, speech, and learning as well as behavioral problems ( Shim et al., 2016 48. Shim, K.W. ∙ Park, E.K. ∙ Kim, J.S. ... Neurodevelopmental Problems in Non-Syndromic Craniosynostosis J. Korean Neurosurg. Soc. 2016; 59 :242-246 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). To investigate the mechanisms underlying rescue of neurocognitive functions by suture regeneration, we measured brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Consistent with microcephaly in craniosynostosis patients, whole-brain volume was reduced in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis, but this was reversed by suture regeneration ( Figures 7 A and 7B). We then examined specific brain regions involved in behaviors altered in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis. The cortical mantle, hippocampus, and corpus callosum volumes were reduced significantly reduced in Twist1 +/− mice and restored after suture regeneration ( Figures 7 A and 7C–7E), whereas the thalamic volume was not changed significantly in Twist1 +/− mice ( Figures 7 A and 7F).
To investigate the cellular basis of brain volume changes, we examined neural numbers in different cortical layers, including Cux1-labeled layer II–IV neurons and Ctip2- and Tbr1- labeled layer V–VI neurons ( Leone et al., 2008 31. Leone, D.P. ∙ Srinivasan, K. ∙ Chen, B. ... The determination of projection neuron identity in the developing cerebral cortex Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18 :28-35 Crossref Scopus (306) PubMed Google Scholar ; Molyneaux et al., 2007 37. Molyneaux, B.J. ∙ Arlotta, P. ∙ Menezes, J.R. ... Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 :427-437 Crossref Scopus (1236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed that Cux1 + , Ctip2 + , and Tbr1 + neurons were all reduced in Twist1 +/− mice ( Figures 7 G–7L) and restored after suture regeneration ( Figures 7 G–7L). This may indicate restored neurogenesis following suture regeneration in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis but could also result from reduced cell death. Focusing on the neuronal activation maker c-Fos, we examined prelimbic and perirhinal cortical regions, which are implicated in social and object recognition, respectively ( Rinaldi et al., 2008 46. Rinaldi, T. ∙ Perrodin, C. ∙ Markram, H. Hyper-connectivity and hyper-plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex in the valproic Acid animal model of autism Front. Neural Circuits. 2008; 2 :4 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ; Krueger et al., 2009 27. Krueger, F. ∙ Barbey, A.K. ∙ Grafman, J.

Buckley, M.J. ∙ Gaffan, D. Perirhinal cortical contributions to object perception Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10 :100-107 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). IHC staining showed that the numbers of c-Fos + cells were increased in Twist1 +/− mice and restored to normal levels after suture regeneration ( Figure S6 G). These results suggest that suture regeneration restored neural numbers and brain volume reduced in Twist1 +/− mice, providing crucial insights into the mechanisms underlying impairment and restoration of neurocognitive functions.

Section: Discussion

By combining MSCs with biomaterials and establishing a mouse model of neurocognitive defects associated with craniosynostosis, we have discovered that Gli1 + MSC-based cranial suture regeneration restores not only skull dysmorphology but also neurocognitive dysfunctions in the Twist1 +/− mouse model of craniosynostosis. These findings represent a research paradigm shift and provide a MSC-based therapeutic strategy for treating craniosynostosis with potential beneficial effects on clinical practice.
Mutant animal models have been instrumental in elucidating the molecular and cellular etiology of craniosynostosis. Many of these models phenocopy the synostoses seen in individuals with the same genetic mutation, making them highly valuable ( Twigg and Wilkie, 2015 55. Twigg, S.R. ∙ Wilkie, A.O. A Genetic-Pathophysiological Framework for Craniosynostosis Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2015; 97 :359-377 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, nearly all studies have focused exclusively on cranial suture defects; analysis of the ICP and neurocognitive functions of these models has been lacking. Here we established Twist1 +/− mice to model neuroanatomic and cognitive dysfunction in individuals with craniosynostosis. These findings will promote future research of neurocognitive dysfunction in other craniosynostosis mouse models and lay the foundation for investigating the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that underlie them. Our discoveries also facilitate design and evaluation of future therapeutic interventions because syndromic and non-syndromic craniosynostosis lead to increased ICP and altered brain morphology, which, in turn, may cause significant changes in neurocognitive function ( Bellew et al., 2005 2.

Surg. 1996; 97 :276-281 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). We developed an effective treatment where Gli1 + MSCs and modified GelMA support cranial suture regeneration and correct skull dysmorphology in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis. These findings have significant potential clinical value.
Surgical correction of craniosynostosis is performed routinely within the first year of life. Whole-vault cranioplasty and endoscopic synostectomy followed by skull-molding helmet therapy are currently the most common treatments ( Brooks et al., 2018 6. Brooks, E.D. ∙ Beckett, J.S. ∙ Yang, J. ... The Etiology of Neuronal Development in Craniosynostosis: A Working Hypothesis J. Craniofac. Surg. 2018; 29 :49-55 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these procedures are invasive and associated with resynostosis and other complications. An improved treatment option is needed to ensure long-term quality of life for these young individuals. Our successful MSC-based suture regeneration depends on a uniquely modified GelMA (M-GM) scaffold that is biocompatible with Gli1 + MSCs, biodegradable, and provides excellent support for suture regeneration. Our therapeutic strategy regenerates cranial sutures that remain patent for at least 1 year and continue to function similarly as a natural cranial suture in injury repair and maintaining tissue homeostasis. Our results suggest that MSCs implanted with M-GM are a less invasive and sustainable biological solution for individuals with craniosynostosis.
Our studies provide cellular and molecular insights into the cranial suture regeneration and maintenance processes. We established the importance and inter-dependence of exogenously implanted Gli1 + MSCs and endogenous MSCs derived from the dura mater in cranial suture regeneration in Twist1 +/− mice. This is consistent with the crucial role of multipotent progenitors in the dura mater in calvarial tissue homeostasis ( Gagan et al., 2007 13. Gagan, J.R. ∙ Tholpady, S.S. ∙ Ogle, R.C.

C Embryo Today. 2007; 81 :297-304 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kwan et al., 2008 28. Kwan, M.D. ∙ Wan, D.C. ∙ Wang, Z. ...

Ogle, R.C. ∙ Tholpady, S.S. ∙ McGlynn, K.A. ... Regulation of cranial suture morphogenesis Cells Tissues Organs. 2004; 176 :54-66 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). MSC grafts can recruit endogenous stem cells to regeneration sites ( Xing et al., 2014 59. Xing, J. ∙ Hou, T. ∙ Jin, H. ... Inflammatory microenvironment changes the secretory profile of mesenchymal stem cells to recruit mesenchymal stem cells Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2014; 33 :905-919 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), likely facilitated by Wnt3a, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ( Shin and Peterson, 2013 49. Shin, L. ∙ Peterson, D.A. Human mesenchymal stem cell grafts enhance normal and impaired wound healing by recruiting existing endogenous tissue stem/progenitor cells Stem Cells Transl. Med. 2013; 2 :33-42 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). At the molecular level, haploinsufficiency of Twist1 leads to compromised Axin2 and elevated Wnt signaling ( Yu et al., 2005 61. Yu, H.M. ∙ Jerchow, B. ∙ Sheu, T.J. ... The role of Axin2 in calvarial morphogenesis and craniosynostosis Development. 2005; 132 :1995-2005 Crossref Scopus (288) PubMed Google Scholar ). Implantation of exogenous MSCs restored Wnt signaling to a level comparable with control samples, preventing resynostosis. Furthermore, our data show that Twist1’s postnatal functions are not essential because loss of Twist1 in Gli1 + MSCs does not lead to craniosynostosis in adult mice. This result also partially explains how implanted MSCs, along with recruited endogenous Gli1 + MSCs, can regenerate a patent cranial suture despite haploinsufficiency of Twist1 . Our findings suggest that implanted MSCs establish a conducive niche into which there is dynamic recruitment and integration of endogenous MSCs to support regeneration of a functional and sustainable cranial suture.
One major discovery is that restoration of suture patency not only rescues skull deformity but also normalizes ICP and restores neurocognitive function. Individuals with craniosynostosis often have learning disabilities ( Kilcoyne et al., 2019 25. Kilcoyne, S. ∙ Luscombe, C. ∙ Scully, P. ...

A. 2012; 158A :1680-1685 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Non-syndromic craniosynostosis affecting different cranial sutures may have differential effects on neurocognitive function ( Sun et al., 2019 54. Sun, A.H. ∙ Eilbott, J. ∙ Chuang, C. ... An Investigation of Brain Functional Connectivity by Form of Craniosynostosis J. Craniofac. Surg. 2019; 30 :1719-1723 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our suture regeneration approach rescued several behavioral abnormalities in Twist1 +/− mice, including deficits in novel object recognition, sociability, and social novelty. Our studies suggest that elevated ICP causes, at least in part, neurocognitive dysfunction that is rescued by suture regeneration in Twist1 +/− mice with craniosynostosis. Our MRI and histological studies indicate that changes in neural numbers and brain volume contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction in Twist1 +/− mice and that these changes are restored following suture regeneration. Our studies provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying improvement of neurocognitive function by suture regeneration. Twist1 is not expressed in the adult mouse brain, and Twist1 +/− mice without craniosynostosis have normal ICP and neurocognitive function, suggesting that Twist1 does not have a direct role in regulating development and function of brain structures. In humans, however, TWIST1 is expressed in the cerebral cortex during fetal development and upper layer excitatory neurons in adults ( Sousa et al., 2017 52. Sousa, A.M.M. ∙ Zhu, Y. ∙ Raghanti, M.A. ... Molecular and cellular reorganization of neural circuits in the human lineage Science. 2017; 358 :1027-1032 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhu et al., 2018 65. Zhu, Y. ∙ Sousa, A.M.M. ∙ Gao, T. ... Spatiotemporal transcriptomic divergence across human and macaque brain development Science. 2018; 362 :eaat8077 Crossref Scopus (232) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies will elucidate the molecular mediators or neural circuits leading to selective cognitive dysfunction and restoration in different synostosis models.
Our study demonstrates that MSCs combined with M-GM can regenerate a cranial suture, restore normal ICP, and rescue neurocognitive function in a highly clinically relevant craniosynostosis model. There are still challenges for clinical implementation of this approach, such as identifying the optimal timing of surgery and the ideal source and dosage of MSCs; these will need to be investigated further to maximize therapeutic efficacy. Nevertheless, our cranial suture regeneration approach offers an effective and less invasive treatment option for craniosynostosis, bringing new hope for individuals who suffer from this devastating disease.

Twist1 +/− and Twist1 fl/fl mice are available upon request, subject to approval from the laboratory where these mice were originally generated, and may require a Materials Transfer Agreement. This study did not generate new unique reagents.
RNA sequencing data from seven-month-old control (WT), Twist1 +/− mice (MUT), and Twist1 +/− mice at six months post-surgery (suture regeneration group, REG) have been deposited at GEO: GSE155562 [NCBI tracking system #21160175].
Twist1 +/− and Twist1 fl/fl mice were obtained from Dr. Robert Maxson (University of Southern California; Chen and Behringer, 1995 10. Chen, Z.F. ∙ Behringer, R.R. Twist is required in head mesenchyme for cranial neural tube morphogenesis Genes Dev. 1995; 9 :686-699 Crossref Scopus (532) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bildsoe et al., 2009 3.

Biol. 2009; 331 :176-188 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). The following strains were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory: Gli1-Cre ERT2 (JAX no. 007913), ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato (JAX no. 007905), CAG-EGFP (JAX no. 006567), ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-eGFP-DTA (JAX no. 006331), and C57BL/6J (JAX no. 000664). For the aged group, mice of both sexes were purchased at about six months of age, and the younger group were two months of age. Mouse experiments were approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed following the regulations for animal experiments. All mice were housed under a 12 h light/dark cycle in pathogen-free conditions with free access to food and water, in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All mice used in our study were healthy and were not involved in previous procedures. All the mice were identified by ear tags. Ear biopsies were lysed at 55°C overnight in DirectPCR solution (Viagen, 102-T) followed by 85°C heat inactivation for 1 hour and PCR-based genotyping (GoTaq Green Master Mix, Promega, and C1000 Touch Cycler, Bio-rad). Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide overdose and then decapitation.
For all experiments, mice of both sexes were used. For the experiments in Figures 1 and S1 , two-month-old C57BL/6J mice and Twist1 +/− mice were used for ICP and behavioral assays, and one-month-old C57BL/6J mice were used for in situ hybridization of Twist1 . For the experiments in Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , S2 H–S2L, and S3 E–S3J, surgeries were performed on Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion at one month of age. Fusion was assessed prior to surgery by live micro-CT ( Figures S3 K–S3N). For experiments in Figures 4 F–4K, a second calvarial defect was made on both sides of the parietal bones six months after suture regeneration in the same Twist1 +/− mice. For experiments in Figures 4 L–4S, suture and bone transplants were obtained from CAG-GFP;Twist1 +/− mice six months after suture regeneration and transplanted into one-month-old Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion. For the experiments in Figures 5 , 6 , 7 , S5 , and S6 G, the suture regeneration surgeries were performed on Twist1 +/− mice at about two weeks of age after scanning with micro-CT to confirm bilateral coronal suture fusion. For the experiments in Figures S6 A–S6F, the suture regeneration surgeries were performed on Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion at about two months of age. For the experiments in Figure S7 , two-month-old C57BL/6J mice with defect-producing surgeries at two weeks of age were used as the sham-operated group. Cells from one-month-old C57BL/6J mice were used for 2, 3-D culturing ( Figures S2 E–S2G) and western blot ( Figures S4 A and S4B). One-month-old Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato or Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-DTA GFP mice were used for cell acquisition and surgery one day post-tamoxifen induction ( Figures S3 A–S3D). For experiments in Figure S3 P, one-month-old Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;Twist1 fl/fl mice were induced with tamoxifen and the coronal suture was collected one month post-induction. Tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) was suspended in corn oil (Sigma, C8267) at 20 mg/ml and 1.5 mg/10 g body weight was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 2 days.
The suture mesenchymal cells were harvested as shown in previous studies ( James et al., 2008 21. James, A.W. ∙ Xu, Y. ∙ Wang, R. ... Proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and fgf-2 modulation of posterofrontal/sagittal suture-derived mesenchymal cells in vitro Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 2008; 122 :53-63 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, sagittal and coronal sutures of one-month-old wild-type, Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato or Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-eGFP-DTA mice were meticulously excised within 0.5 mm of abutting bones on both sides under a dissecting microscope (Leica, M60), while great care was taken to exclude tissue from the posterofrontal and lambdoid sutures. The overlying periosteum and underlying dura mater were removed carefully. The suture tissues were then washed with PBS and αMEM with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin several times and were minced into tiny pieces and transferred into a T25 dish (Nest, 705001) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. Our cell culture medium was formulated following an established protocol for mouse MSCs ( Liu et al., 2011 32. Liu, Y. ∙ Wang, L. ∙ Kikuiri, T. ... Mesenchymal stem cell-based tissue regeneration is governed by recipient T lymphocytes via IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha Nat. Med. 2011; 17 :1594-1601 Crossref Scopus (548) PubMed Google Scholar ) and contained αMEM (GIBCO, 2065542) supplemented with 20% FBS (GIBCO, 2100184), 2 mM L-glutamine (Contained in antibiotics), 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO, 2090354), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO, 2019321). After 5-6 days, cells were digested with TrypLE (GIBCO, 1897328) and the tissues were removed by passing through a 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352350), then the cells were incubated for another 3-4 days before use.
P1 cultured suture mesenchymal cells from Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-tdTomato mice were dissociated by TrypLE and resuspended in 500-1000 μl medium. Cells were then filtered with a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352340) to remove the remaining cell mass and sorted for tdTomato + cells via flow cytometry in a FACS Aria system using FACS Diva software. After sorting, the tdTomato + cells were centrifuged for colony-forming assay and suture regeneration. After 7 days, the 24-well culture plates (seeded with 2500 tdTomato + cells/well) were stained overnight with a mixture solution of 0.1% toluidine blue and 2% paraformaldehyde.
Intracranial pressure was measured in two-month-old wild-type and Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral suture fusion and six months after coronal suture regeneration surgery at two weeks of age or four and a half months after surgery at two months of age. The procedure was performed as described previously ( Murtha et al., 2012 39. Murtha, L. ∙ McLeod, D. ∙ Spratt, N. Epidural intracranial pressure measurement in rats using a fiber-optic pressure transducer J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 62 :e3689 PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic setup. A hole was drilled into the right parietal bone that was 2 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior from the Bregma. A 10 μL pipette tip (cut to 5 mm in length) used as the sensor guide was inserted into the hole and fixed with dental cement. After the dental cement dried, the sensor guide was filled with sterile PBS and the fiber-optic intracranial pressure probe (FISO Technologies) was inserted until the tip of the probe touched the dura. Caulking material was applied around the probe and the head of the sensor guide to form an airtight seal. Intracranial pressure was recorded with Evolution software (FISO Technologies).
Behavioral characterization of wild-type and Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral suture fusion was carried out at 8-12 weeks of age. As for suture regenerated mice, behavioral assays were performed six months after coronal suture regeneration surgery at two weeks of age or four and a half months after surgery at two months of age; age-matched wild-type and Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral suture fusion were also tested. In all experiments, mice were acclimated to the behavior room at least 60 minutes before the first trial began. Experimenters were blinded to animal genotypes during behavioral tests and data analyses.
This test was performed as described previously ( Leger et al., 2013 30. Leger, M. ∙ Quiedeville, A. ∙ Bouet, V. ... Object recognition test in mice Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :2531-2537 Crossref Scopus (790) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, this test consists of habituation, familiarization, and test phases. In the habituation phase, subject mice were placed in the center of a clean, empty cage and allowed to explore freely for 5 min. After 24 hours, the familiarization phase was performed. Two identical objects were taped to floor along the long axis, 10 cm away from the south and north walls. The mouse was placed in the center of the cage facing the east or west wall and allowed to explore for 10 min. The test phase was performed 3 or 24 hours after the familiarization phase. One of the identical objects was replaced with a novel object with a different shape but similar size. The mouse was placed in the center of the cage facing the east or west wall and allowed to explore for 10 min. The apparatus and objects were thoroughly cleaned with 75% ethanol to remove the olfactory cues between each trial. The entire test phase was videotaped and the travel of the subject mouse was manually documented. The preference index was calculated as (Tn − Tf)/(Tn + Tf) × 100%, where Tn and Tf represent the time spent exploring novel and familiar objects, respectively.
The test apparatus was a Plexiglas box containing three compartments connected by small openings that allow the mice free access to each compartment. The subject mouse was first placed in the middle chamber with the side doors closed for 5 min, after which the doors were opened to allow the mouse to explore the three empty chambers. After 10 min of habituation, the mouse was gently guided to the middle chamber and side doors were closed. A stranger mouse was placed in an inverted wire cup in one side chamber and an empty wire cup was placed in the other side chamber. Then the side doors were opened and the subject mouse was allowed to freely explore the chambers for 10 min. After this period, the subject mouse was again guided to the middle chamber and the doors were closed. A second stranger mouse was placed in the previously empty wire cup. The side doors were opened, and the subject mouse was allowed to freely explore for another 10 min. The amount of time that the subject mouse spent sniffing each wire cup was quantified and the preference index was calculated as (Ts1 − Te)/(Ts1 + Te) × 100% and (Ts2 – Ts1)/(Ts2 + Ts1) × 100%. Here, Te, Ts1 and Ts2 represent the time spent exploring the empty, Stranger 1 and Stranger 2 wire cups, respectively. The apparatus and wire cups were thoroughly cleaned with 75% ethanol to remove the olfactory cues between tests for each mouse.
The rotarod test consists of training and test phases. Mice were first trained by placing them on a rotating rod (Panlab, Havard Apparatus) at a constant speed of 4 rpm until they were able to stay on the rotating rod for 60 s. The test phase was performed 24 hours after the training phase. The rotarod apparatus was set to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm in 300 s, and mice were placed on the rod initially rotating at 4 rpm. The latency (time) to falling off the rod was determined. Each mouse was tested three times a day at 15 min intervals for four consecutive days.
The subject mouse was placed in an empty arena (40 cm × 40 cm) and allowed to freely explore for 15 min. The total traveled distance and time spent in the center zone were recorded and automatically measured using Smart v3.0 (Panlab, Havard Apparatus). The arena was thoroughly cleaned with 75% ethanol between tests for each mouse.
This test was performed as described previously ( Cabe et al., 1978 8. Cabe, P.A. ∙ Tilson, H.A. ∙ Mitchell, C.L. ... A simple recording grip strength device Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1978; 8 :101-102 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ; Smith et al., 1995 51. Smith, J.P. ∙ Hicks, P.S. ∙ Ortiz, L.R. ... Quantitative measurement of muscle strength in the mouse J. Neurosci. Methods. 1995; 62 :15-19 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). A Grip Strength Meter (Bioseb, BIO-GS3) was used to measure the forelimb grip strength. The gauge was reset and stabilized to 0 g before testing each mouse. A mouse was allowed to grasp the bar mounted on the force gauge and the mouse’s tail was slowly pulled back. The peak pull force in grams was recorded on a digital force transducer.
This test was performed as described previously ( Holmes et al., 2002a 19. Holmes, A. ∙ Wrenn, C.C. ∙ Harris, A.P. ... Behavioral profiles of inbred strains on novel, olfactory, spatial and emotional tests for reference memory in mice Genes Brain Behav. 2002; 1 :55-69 Crossref Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar , 2002b 20. Holmes, A. ∙ Yang, R.J. ∙ Crawley, J.N. Evaluation of an anxiety-related phenotype in galanin overexpressing transgenic mice J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 18 :151-165 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Briefly, the elevated plus maze apparatus (Panlab, Havard Apparatus) consisted of two open arms and two closed arms (29.5 × 6 cm). The entire maze was elevated 40 cm from the floor. Mice were individually placed in the center of the maze, facing toward the open arm, and allowed to freely explore the apparatus for 10 min. The open and closed arm entries (all four paws in an arm) and the time spent in the open arms were recorded using Smart v3.0 (Panlab, Havard Apparatus).
This test was performed as described previously ( Arbuckle et al., 2015 1. Arbuckle, E.P. ∙ Smith, G.D. ∙ Gomez, M.C. ... Testing for Odor Discrimination and Habituation in Mice J. Vis. Exp. 2015; 99 :e52615 Google Scholar ) with minor modifications. Each mouse was habituated for one hour to a clean new cage before test. Then the animal was presented five odors in a row delivered on cotton swabs in the following order: water, almond flavor, banana flavor, social odor 1 and social odor 2. The almond and banana odors were prepared by diluting almond and citrus extracts (McCormick) in distilled water (1:100). Each social odor was prepared by wiping a cotton swab for 15 s in a zigzag fashion across the bottom of dirty cage which was used to keep mice of the same sex as the test subject. Each odor was presented three times in a row for 2 min each time with approximately 1 min inter-trial interval. For every non-social odor exposure, the cotton swab was freshly prepared by applying 50 μL of diluted odorant. The cumulative time spent sniffing the odor (the animal’s nose was oriented toward the cotton tip at a distance less than 2 cm) was manually recorded.
Methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) was synthesized as in the previously described ( Van Den Bulcke et al., 2000 56. Van Den Bulcke, A.I. ∙ Bogdanov, B. ∙ De Rooze, N. ... Structural and rheological properties of methacrylamide modified gelatin hydrogels Biomacromolecules. 2000; 1 :31-38 Crossref Scopus (1150) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, methacrylic anhydride (MA) was added at a rate of 0.4~0.5 ml/min to a 10% gelatin/PBS (w/v) solution at pH 9 under stirring, to achieve a final MA-to-gelatin ratio of 0.3 ml/g. After allowing the reaction to proceed at 50°C for 2.5~3 h, the reacted solution was dialyzed against distilled water at 40°C for 7 days to remove the excessive methacrylic acid and anhydride, then filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane, freeze-dried and stored at −80°C for later use. The substitution degree of GelMA was measured as described previously ( Habeeb, 1966 17. Habeeb, A.F. Determination of free amino groups in proteins by trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14 :328-336 Crossref Scopus (1983) PubMed Google Scholar ), and was found to be approximately 48%. The freeze-dried GelMA was dissolved in αMEM at 5% (w/v) containing 0.5% (w/v) lithium phenyl-2, 4, 6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate (LAP) to obtain a solution. The GelMA was modified (creating what we refer to here as modified GelMA, or M-GM) by mixing 5% GelMA solution with Matrigel (Corning, 8015323) and 3 mg/mL collagen I (GIBCO, A10483-01) at 4°C with a volume ratio of 10: 2: 1. The M-GM solution was cured with a 365 nm UV light source for few seconds to completely crosslink the hydrogels. Concentration-matched (1) pure GelMA, (2) GelMA:Matrigel at a ratio of 5:1 (creating what we refer to here as GM-Ma), (3) GelMA:Matrigel at 2:1, (4) GelMA: Matrigel at 1:1, (5) GelMA:Matrigel at 1:2, and (6) pure Matrigel were also tested.
The mechanical properties of gels were characterized by compression and uniaxial tensile tests using a dynamic mechanical analysis instrument (Instron 5542, Instron, Norwood, MA). For unconfined compression tests, the hydrogels were cured in disks (3 mm thick, diameter as 12 mm) by being exposed to 365 nm UV light (1 W/cm 2 ) for 2 min. Each sample was placed between two compression plates and compressed at a displacement rate of 1 mm/min. The samples were cut into 2 × 4 × 5 mm 3 strips after photo-cross-linking and stretched at a rate of 1 mm/min to explore the tensile properties. The compression modulus and Young’s modulus were calculated as the slope of the linear region in the 0%–10% strain range of the stress-strain curves.
The natural degradation properties of the hydrogels were determined in PBS at 37°C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks. At each time point, remaining hydrogel was washed with distilled water, all liquid was removed and gels were lyophilized. The original dry weight was denoted W o and the dry weight after incubation was W d . The extent of degradation was determined gravimetrically as the percent weight loss according to following equation: Remaining weight (%) = (W o - W d )/W d × 100.
FRAP measurements were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica SP8, Germany) to analyze diffusion properties of solutes within the gels as previously reported ( Kang et al., 2012 24. Kang, M. ∙ Day, C.A. ∙ Kenworthy, A.K. ... Simplified equation to extract diffusion coefficients from confocal FRAP data Traffic. 2012; 13 :1589-1600 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaemmerer et al., 2014 23. Kaemmerer, E. ∙ Melchels, F.P. ∙ Holzapfel, B.M. ... Gelatinemethacrylamide-based hydrogels: an alternative three-dimensional cancer cell culture system Acta Biomater. 2014; 10 :2551-2562 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the gels were loaded with 1 mg/ml FITC-BSA (Invitrogen, A23015). The half time of recovery (τ 1/2 ) and diffusion coefficient were calculated from the experimental recovery curve by fitting of the appropriate FRAP model. All FRAP analyses were performed with MatlabR2019b (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). A circular bleach area with a diameter of 50 μm was used throughout all FRAP recordings.
All the gels were photo-cross-linked into a disk shape (thickness = 1 mm, diameter = 12 mm). Then, the gel disks with different compositions were immersed into 2 mL of PBS at 37°C for 24 h to reach equilibrium swelling. After being removed from PBS, the gel disks were gently blotted with a Kimwipe to remove the residual liquid, and the swollen weight of each disk was recorded (W s ). The samples were subsequently lyophilized and weighed again to determine the dry weight of each disk (W d ). The swelling ratio was then calculated as Q = (W s - W d )/W d .
To characterize the cell morphology in hydrogels, the P1 cultured suture mesenchymal cells were gently mixed with the hydrogel (5 × 10 5 cells/ml) until uniform and cured with UV light. After 1 or 5 days, samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight, washed with PBS three times and fixed with 1% OsO 4 for 1 h. After three more washes, they were dehydrated by a graded series of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%) for 15 min each and 100% ethanol twice for 20 min each, then transferred to isoamyl acetate twice for 15 min each time. Finally, the samples were carefully moved to a critical point dryer (Leica EM CPD300, Germany) for dehydration. The cross-sections of the samples were exposed and coated with Au/Pd using a sputter coater (Leica EM ACE600, Germany), while the morphology of cells inside the hydrogels was observed using scanning electron microscopy (Nova Nano SEM450, FEI, America).
Cellular viability was detected with a live/dead staining kit (Invitrogen, MP 34958). Briefly, suture mesenchymal cells from sagittal and coronal sutures of one-month-old wild-type mice were mixed with hydrogel at a density of 5 × 10 5 cells/ml, cured as above, and cultured in αMEM-based medium as described above for 1 or 5 days. Then, the samples were stained with calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer-1 for 30 min. Images were obtained on a Zeiss LSM 710 inverted confocal microscope with a scanning thickness of 3 μm for each layer. The overlaid 2D pictures were analyzed using Leica LAS AF software.
One-month-old, two-month-old, or two-week-old Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion were chosen for surgery after confirming the fusion via CT scanning. A midline sagittal incision was made on the calvaria under general anesthesia, and the bilateral coronal sutures and the surrounding bones were exposed by elevating the scalp. The overlying periosteum was removed carefully from the exposed area by curette. Then a dental round burr (Brasseler, H52. 11. 003) was used to create a rectangular defect with 0.3-0.4 mm width by referencing the residual hallmark of the fused suture (white arrowheads in Figures 2 A, 2C, and 2D) and the landmark for a normal coronal suture (BRG and SQU in Figures S4 D–S4F), while carefully avoiding damage to the underlying dura mater. A strip of bone 0.3-0.4 mm wide was preserved between the defect and the sagittal suture. Three types of cells (tdTomato + cells, heat-inactivated tdTomato + cells, and cells from Gli1-Cre ERT2 ;ROSA26 LoxP-STOP-LoxP-eGFP-DTA mice) were uniformly mixed with M-GM at a density of 5 × 10 7 cells/ml and 2 μl of the solution was added to the defect. As controls, tdTomato + cells were mixed with pure GelMA, GM-Ma or Matrigel on ice and then transferred to the defect, or defects were filled with pure M-GM or left empty. All the groups with M-GM were then cured with UV light with a wavelength of 365 nm for a few seconds. The scalp was then sutured closed with 5.0 polyglactin stitches ( Figures S3 A–S3D).
Each calvarial defect was measured six months after surgery to determine the width of the regenerated sutures, and age-matched wild-type mice were used as a control. The distance between the two bones was calculated as the width of the suture, and three points along each suture were selected (the most medial, the most lateral and the middle points of each coronal suture). All measurements were included in the analysis.
After a defect of 0.3-0.4 mm width was generated as above, a Parafilm membrane with 10 nm diameter pores (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was carefully placed between the internal surface of calvaria and the dura mater, while carefully avoiding damage to the dura. Then the defects were filled with M-GM+cells and cured by UV light as outlined above. The calvarial bone together with Parafilm membrane was harvested six weeks later.
We implanted M-GM plus MSCs into the calvarial bone of Twist1 +/− mice following the removal of the fused coronal suture. One day after this suture regeneration procedure, we removed a 2 mm × 2 mm square area of bone containing M-GM and MSCs. Then we carefully removed the periosteum and dura mater while protecting the M-GM and donor MSCs under a microscope. The explant was then grafted under the kidney capsule of a host mouse as previously described ( Xu et al., 2005 60. Xu, X. ∙ Bringas, Jr., P. ∙ Soriano, P. ... PDGFR-alpha signaling is critical for tooth cusp and palate morphogenesis Dev. Dyn. 2005; 232 :75-84 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). The explant was harvested after six weeks.
The calvarial bones and kidney capsules containing calvarial explants were radiographed in live mice using a micro-CT (Ct Lab In-vivo 90) device. Images were collected using a 70 KVp and 114 μA X-ray source. All the 3D reconstructions and sections were analyzed using AVIZO 9.4.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Suture samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS overnight at 4°C, followed by decalcification in EDTA for about 2 weeks, dehydration with a graded sucrose solutions (15% and 30% sucrose for 2 hours each at room temperature, and 30% sucrose with 50% OCT overnight at 4°C) and immediately embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek, 4583). Frozen tissue blocks were sectioned at 8 μm on a cryostat (Leica) and mounted on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher) for staining.
For brain sample sectioning, animals were intracranially perfused with PBS and 4% PFA, and the brain was dissected out, post-fixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, and dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution for 2 days. The dehydrated samples were embedded in OCT and sectioned at 40 μm on a cryostat (Leica).
Sections were permeabilized with blocking buffer containing 1% BSA, 2% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-Gli1 (Novus Biological NBP1-78259, 1:20), anti-Runx2 (Cell signaling technology 12556, 1:100), anti-Sp7 (Abcam ab22552, 1:100), anti-FABP4, anti-Collagen II, anti-Osteopontin (R&D systems SC010, 10μg/ml), anti-Cux1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC514008, 1:200), anti-Ctip2 (Abcam ab18465, 1:200), anti-Tbr1 (Abcam ab31940, 1:200), or anti-c-Fos (Cell Signaling Technology 2250, 1:400) overnight at 4°C. The following day, sections were incubated with fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen A11008, 1:150), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen A32814, 1:150), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-sheep IgG (Invitrogen A11015, 1:150), Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen A32795, 1:150) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken IgG (Invitrogen A11039, 1:150) together with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific 62248, 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories). Images were captured by a Leica DMI3000 B fluorescence microscope and a Leica DMI6000 CS confocal microscope using Leica LAS AF software.
To observe the source of Gli1 + cells in regenerated sutures, the dura mater right under the coronal suture defect region was labeled very carefully using a Qtracker Cell Labeling kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q25041MP), avoiding surrounding tissues. After staining for 30 min, excess was washed off with PBS, and then the defects were filled with M-GM+MSCs or left empty as mentioned above.
The expression of Twist1 in the brain and coronal suture of one-month-old wild-type mice was assayed using an RNAscope 2.5 HD Chromogenic Assay (Single-plex, Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Sections were acquired as mentioned above, after which ISH was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Suture mesenchymal cells from one-month-old C57BL/6J mice were cultured with 20 μM Wnt agonist 1 (Selleck, S8178) or 100 nM LY2090314 (Selleck, S7063) for one or two weeks in αMEM. Medium was changed every other day. Total protein was extracted using a solution of loading buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, 7723S), protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1861278) and DTT (Cell Signaling Technology, 7723S), then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, ISEQ00005). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk dissolved in TBST for 2 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking, and then incubated with primary antibodies: anti-Runx2 (Cell signaling technology 12556, 1:1000), anti-OPN (Abcam ab63856, 1:500), and anti-βactin (Abcam ab20272, 1:1000) at 4°C overnight followed by corresponding horseradish-peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein expression was detected by Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Touch (Bio-Rad) and intensities of bands were quantitated by ImageJ software.
To determine the differentially expressed genes between seven-month-old C57BL/6J mice (wild-type group, WT), seven-month-old Twist1 +/− mice (mutant group, MUT), and seven-month-old Twist1 +/− mice at six months post-surgery (suture regeneration group, REG), RNA sequencing analysis was performed. After removing the periosteum and dura mater, the coronal sutures of WT and REG groups were excised along with less than 0.2 mm of abutting bone on each side under a microscope. A bone sample of the same size was acquired from the coronal suture region of the MUT group. To acquire endogenous cells (tdTomato-negative) from the REG group, 3 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington, LS004194) and 4 mg/ml dispaseII (Roche, 04942078001) were used for 1 hour after mincing the regenerated sutures into tiny pieces. Cells were then filtered with a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352340) to remove the remaining tissue mass and sorted for tdTomato - cells via flow cytometry in a FACS Aria system using FACS Diva software. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, 74004). The quality of RNA samples was determined using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and all groups had RNA integrity (RIN) numbers > 7.0. cDNA library preparation and sequencing were performed at the University of California, Los Angeles Technology Center for Genomics & Bioinformatics. The paired-end reads with 1 × 75 bp read length were generated on NextSeq500 High Output equipment for three pairs from each group. Raw reads were trimmed, aligned using Partek Flow with the mm10 genome, and normalized using RPKM. Differential expression was estimated by selecting transcripts with a significance of p < 0.05. A two-way hierarchical clustering heatmap using Euclidean distance and average linkage was used to display differentially expressed genes from the three groups.
To assay the multipotential differentiation of the regenerated suture cells, cells from Twist1 +/− mice were acquired six months after surgery and cultured following the method described for suture MSCs above. After amplification to sufficient density, the cells were seeded into a 24-well culture plate (Corning, CLS3527) or 15 mL conical tube (Thermo fisher, 362695) and analyzed using a functional identification kit for mouse mesenchymal stem cells (R&D systems, SC010) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
A calvarial injury model was established by creating two circular lesions in the parietal bone using a micro-drill; the periosteum was not removed. The lesions were created bilaterally with a size of ~0.8 mm diameter, 1 mm away from the middle of the coronal suture. The left side was left empty to serve as a control while the right side was filled with M-GM plus donor cells six months after the first suture regeneration surgery. Samples were acquired after three months.
The suture transplantation surgery was performed as described in our previous work ( Zhao et al., 2015 64. Zhao, H. ∙ Feng, J. ∙ Ho, T.V. ... The suture provides a niche for mesenchymal stem cells of craniofacial bones Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :386-396 Crossref Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ). Six months after suture regeneration in CAG-EGFP;Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion, donor mice were euthanized and a 2 mm × 2 mm square area of bone containing regenerated suture (or for the control group, an equivalent sample of the coronal suture region) was immediately removed under a microscope and kept on ice for later use. The periosteum and dura mater were carefully preserved. One-month-old Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion were used as the recipient mice. A midline sagittal incision was made over the calvaria under anesthesia, and the coronal suture region and surrounding bones were exposed by elevating the scalp. The periosteum in the fused suture area was carefully removed and a 2.2-2.5 mm defect was made in the fused coronal suture region of both sides using a dental round burr (Brasseler, H52. 11. 003) without damaging the underlying dura mater. The suture transplant was placed over the recipient calvarial defect with the dura side facing inside. The scalp was then sutured closed with 5.0 polyglactin suture. Samples were acquired three months later.
Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was established for 3 groups using MorphoJ 1.07a ( Klingenberg, 2011 26. Klingenberg, C.P. MorphoJ: an integrated software package for geometric morphometrics Mol. Ecol. Resour. 2011; 11 :353-357 Crossref Scopus (3007) PubMed Google Scholar ) referencing previous work ( Parsons et al., 2014 43. Parsons, T.E. ∙ Weinberg, S.M. ∙ Khaksarfard, K. ... Craniofacial shape variation in Twist1+/− mutant mice Anat. Rec. (Hoboken). 2014; 297 :826-833 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ). The groups compared were WT (6.5-month-old C57BL/6J mice), MUT (6.5-month-old Twist1 +/− mice with bilateral coronal suture fusion), and REG (6.5-month-old Twist1 +/− mice six months after bilateral suture regeneration). The coordinates of each shape were subjected to Procrustes superimposition to place the landmark configurations into a common space using a standard geometric morphometric approach. Subsets of landmarks were used to individually analyze the differences in shape of two distinct regions of the skull (top of calvarium and lateral portion of calvarium). Principal component analysis was used to identify the variation between different groups in both these distinct regions. The landmark subsets are indicated in Figures 6 A–6C, and the analysis included a 1,000-round permutation test for Procrustes distance.
To determine the global and regional brain volume differences between 6.5-month-old C57BL/6J mice (wild-type group, WT), 6.5-month-old Twist1 +/− mice (mutant group, MUT), and 6.5-month-old Twist1 +/− mice at six months post-surgery (suture regeneration group, REG), all mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and intracardially perfused with 30 mL of 0.1 M PBS containing 10 U/ml heparin (Sigma, H3149) and 2 mM ProHance (a Gadolinium contrast agent), followed by 30 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 2 mM ProHance. Then the mice were decapitated, and brains with skulls were incubated in 4% PFA + 2 mM ProHance overnight at 4°C then transferred to 0.1 M PBS containing 2 mM ProHance and 0.02% sodium azide for 10 days before MRI scanning ( Gompers et al., 2017 14. Gompers, A. ∙ Su-Feher, L. ∙ Ellegood, J. ... Germline Chd8 haploinsufficiency alters brain development in mouse Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20 :1062-1073 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Magnetic resonance images were acquired on a MRSolutions 7 Tesla MRI scanner (Guildford, UK). Three-dimensional anatomical Fast Spin Echo (FSE) images were acquired to encompass the whole brain. Imaging parameters were as follows: TEeffective/TR = 26ms/400ms, 4 averages, echo train length = 4, field of view = 16 mm × 16 mm × 25.6 mm, matrix size = 160 × 256 × 256, and flip angle = 90°. Total acquisition time was 280 minutes.
The brain region-of-interest boundaries were manually drawn for each slice using ImageJ and a mouse brain anatomical atlas (Allen Mouse Brain Atlas). The measured areas for the whole brain, cortical mantle, hippocampus, thalamus, corpus callosum, and cerebellum were multiplied by slice thickness to calculate final volumes (mm 3 ).
For all experiments, the number of replicates is stated in the subsection on Quantification and Statistical Analysis (see below) or in the Results section. For sample-size determination, we performed power calculations, in which a p value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant difference. For behavioral analyses, based on our preliminary data we determined that the studies required a sample size of n ≅ 10 per genotype of each sex.
Criteria for exclusion of mice were predetermined. A preliminary observation of general health and home cage behaviors was conducted for each mouse. Preliminary inspections were used to exclude grossly abnormal mice including mice that lie immobile, do not react to action challenges, do not look to be thriving, or are severely ill. In the rotarod test, mice that could not maintain on the rotarod after the training session or jumped and escaped from the rod or testing bench area were excluded from the analysis. In the novel object test, mice that had less than 15 s of the total sniffing time for both the familiar and novel object were removed from the analysis. In elevated plus maze, mice that made less than three entries into both open and closed arms or fell off of the maze were removed from the analysis. In the open field, three-chamber and odor discrimination/habituation tests, mice that did not engage in the tested behaviors throughout the entire period of behavioral testing were excluded from the analysis.
SPSS software version 26.0 was used for statistical analysis. Significance was assessed by using independent two-tailed Student’s t tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA). P value s equal to or lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All of the statistical details of the experiments can be found in the figure legends. Figures S2 A–S2D, S2M–S2P, S4 A, and S4B show three replicates with independent gels/cells. The experiments in Figures 4 E and S2 E–S2G were repeated five times with independent cells. Figures S3 K–S3N show representative data from over 200 Twist1 +/− mice. Figures 2 G–2R and S3 E–S3G show representative data from 10-15 independent experiments. Figures 3 A–3H, 4 F–4S, S1 A, S2 H–S2L (three points for each sample), S3 H–S3J, S3O, and S3P, show representative data from 5 independent experiments. Each experiment (WT, REG, MUT) in Figures 4 A–4D and S4 C was repeated three times with sutures/endogenous cells from regenerated sutures/bones from five mice per group. The numbers of mice used in Figures 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , S1 B–S1I, and S5–S7 are shown in the figure legends. No methods were used to determine whether the data met assumptions of the statistical approach.
