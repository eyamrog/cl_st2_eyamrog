Title: A Viral Exposure Signature Defines Early Onset of Hepatocellular Carcinoma


Abstract: Summary

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive malignancy with its global incidence and mortality rate continuing to rise, although early detection and surveillance are suboptimal. We performed serological profiling of the viral infection history in 899 individuals from an NCI-UMD case-control study using a synthetic human virome, VirScan. We developed a viral exposure signature and validated the results in a longitudinal cohort with 173 at-risk patients who had long-term follow-up for HCC development. Our viral exposure signature significantly associated with HCC status among at-risk individuals in the validation cohort (area under the curve: 0.91 [95% CI 0.87–0.96] at baseline and 0.98 [95% CI 0.97–1] at diagnosis). The signature identified cancer patients prior to a clinical diagnosis and was superior to alpha-fetoprotein. In summary, we established a viral exposure signature that can predict HCC among at-risk patients prior to a clinical diagnosis, which may be useful in HCC surveillance.

Section: Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a main histological type of primary liver cancer, is considered a virus-related malignancy in which hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) are major etiological factors ( Farazi and DePinho, 2006 16. Farazi, P.A. ∙ DePinho, R.A. Hepatocellular carcinoma pathogenesis: from genes to environment Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6 :674-687 Crossref Scopus (1733) PubMed Google Scholar ). Viral hepatitis causes inflammation and chronic liver diseases (CLDs), which may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually, HCC. While HBV or HCV chronic carriers have an increased risk of developing HCC, the risk varies among individuals, and not all patients with liver disease develop liver cancer ( Arzumanyan et al., 2013 2. Arzumanyan, A. ∙ Reis, H.M. ∙ Feitelson, M.A. Pathogenic mechanisms in HBV- and HCV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13 :123-135 Crossref Scopus (689) PubMed Google Scholar ). An effective strategy to prevent HCC is to eliminate causative factors. However, while direct-acting antiviral treatment is remarkably effective in eliminating HCV infection, it reduces, but cannot eliminate, HCC risk ( Carrat et al., 2019; Janjua et al., 2017 9. Carrat, F. ∙ Fontaine, H. ∙ Dorival, C. ..., French ANRS CO22 Hepather cohort Clinical outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis C after direct-acting antiviral treatment: a prospective cohort study Lancet. 2019; 393 :1453-1464 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (446) PubMed Google Scholar 20. Janjua, N.Z. ∙ Chong, M. ∙ Kuo, M. ... Long-term effect of sustained virological response on hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis C in Canada J. Hepatol. 2017; 66 :504-513 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similarly, HBV vaccination, when introduced in the early 1980s, has been successful in significantly reducing the number of HBV carriers. Still, it only modestly reduces HCC burden in HBV-prevalent areas ( Chang et al., 2016 11. Chang, M.H. ∙ You, S.L. ∙ Chen, C.J. ... Long-term Effects of Hepatitis B Immunization of Infants in Preventing Liver Cancer Gastroenterology. 2016; 151 :472-480.e1 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is puzzling that the control of HBV infection in HBV-prevalent areas, as well as HCV infection, has been remarkably successful for decades, while the global HCC incidence and mortality rates continues to increase since the 1990s ( Liu et al., 2019b 23. Liu, Z. ∙ Jiang, Y. ∙ Yuan, H. ... The trends in incidence of primary liver cancer caused by specific etiologies: Results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 and implications for liver cancer prevention J. Hepatol. 2019; 70 :674-683 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (440) PubMed Google Scholar ). Changing trends of etiological factors such as alcohol and non-alcohol and non-viral-related liver diseases likely contribute to the observed increase. Thus, in addition to cancer prevention, early detection remains a key approach to prevent HCC-inflicted mortality. Currently, medical society guidelines recommend biannual surveillance using ultrasound with or without alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for certain individuals with CLD and those with cirrhosis ( Sherman et al., 2012 32. Sherman, M. ∙ Bruix, J. ∙ Porayko, M. ..., AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma: the rationale for the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommendations Hepatology. 2012; 56 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, these practices have yielded mixed results related to the effectiveness in detecting HCC at an early stage or to providing survival benefit ( Moon et al., 2018; Sherman et al., 1995; Tzartzeva et al., 2018 27. Moon, A.M. ∙ Weiss, N.S. ∙ Beste, L.A. ... No Association Between Screening for Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Reduced Cancer-Related Mortality in Patients With Cirrhosis Gastroenterology. 2018; 155 :1128-1139.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Sherman, M. ∙ Peltekian, K.M. ∙ Lee, C. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus: incidence and prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma in a North American urban population Hepatology. 1995; 22 :432-438 PubMed Google Scholar 38. Tzartzeva, K. ∙ Obi, J. ∙ Rich, N.E. ...

Notably, a majority of HCC patients are still diagnosed at an advanced stage, which precludes their chance to receive potentially curative therapies, leading to poor survival. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify an effective biomarker-guided surveillance program for early liver cancer detection.
Viruses are known to affect human health by altering host immunity, which makes the interplay between the virome and the host crucial in the pathogenesis of human chronic diseases, including cancer ( Cadwell, 2015; Foxman and Iwasaki, 2011 8. Cadwell, K. The virome in host health and disease Immunity. 2015; 42 :805-813 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar 17. Foxman, E.F. ∙ Iwasaki, A. Genome-virome interactions: examining the role of common viral infections in complex disease Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9 :254-264 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Diverse pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses may interact with one another as well as their host to shape host immunity, which may alter its response to new infections and cancer risk. Consequently, viruses that persist or are cleared in the host may leave unique molecular footprints that can affect host susceptibility to cancer and may serve as an excellent window of early onset of disease ( Cadwell, 2015 8. Cadwell, K. The virome in host health and disease Immunity. 2015; 42 :805-813 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesize that unique viral exposure signatures (VESs) resulting from virus-host interactions could reflect a cascade of events that may alter the risk of developing HCC. Such signatures may serve as early detection biomarkers and offer knowledge about potentially modifiable factors for early onset of HCC. In this study, we profiled serological samples from 899 individuals currently enrolled in an NCI-UMD (National Cancer Institute-University of Maryland) case-control study of liver cancer (NCT00913757; clinicaltrials.gov ). We used a synthetic virome technology, VirScan, based on a high-throughput sequencing method, to detect the exposure history to all known human viruses ( Xu et al., 2015 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using the high-throughput method, we developed a unique VES that can discriminate HCC cases from at-risk or healthy volunteers, and then validated this signature in a prospective NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) at-risk cohort for HCC (NCT0001971; clinicaltrials.gov ).

Section: Results

VirScan applies a phage display library that covers 93,904 viral epitopes, representing 206 human viral species and over 1,000 viral strains, to screen for previous exposure history ( Xu et al., 2015 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). A phage particle with an epitope that was recognized by a participant’s antibody was immunoprecipitated (Phage-IP), and the encoding DNA barcode was then sequenced ( Figure 1 A). We used a case-control design of the Maryland (NCI-UMD) cohort for the discovery of viral exposure profiles. The inclusion and enrollment of the study subjects are outlined in Figure S1 A, following the CONSORT guideline ( Schulz et al., 2010 30. Schulz, K.F. ∙ Altman, D.G. ∙ Moher, D., CONSORT Group CONSORT 2010 statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials BMJ. 2010; 340 :c332 Crossref Scopus (5959) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 A). For the NCI-UMD cohort, VirScan Phage-IP products yielded 0.5–5 million single-end reads per serum sample, with mean mapped read matching accuracy of 0.93 ( Figure 1 B). A total of 30,033 viral epitopes were significantly enriched with a −log10(p value) greater than the reproducibility threshold of 2.358, which was determined based on both replicates ( Figures S1 B and S1C). It was noted that the composition of the viral types at the viral taxonomic level showed small yet noticeable differences between the obtained Phage-IP products and the library input ( Figures S1 D and S1E), indicating a measurable difference between patients-derived data and the original input. When assessing viral richness among healthy volunteers as a population control (PC), CLD patients as at risk (AR), and HCC, we found that the number of detected viral infections increases initially with the sample size but reaches saturation at a sample size of 200 or more ( Figure 1 C). We detected a median of seven species of virus per sample, with four individuals showing cross-reactivity to more than 20 virus species ( Figure 1 D). Overall, the number of viral species was similarly distributed among PC, AR, and HCC ( Figure 1 D), indicating no bias in the landscape of overall viral exposure profiles between these groups. The abundance of the most prevalent viral species, including human herpesvirus 4 (EBV) and human herpesvirus 5 (CMV), was similar in our study populations to what was reported in other populations ( Figure 1 E; Table S1 B) ( Xu et al., 2015 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is consistent with previous epidemiology reports ( Ho, 1990; Straus et al., 1993 19. Ho, M. Epidemiology of cytomegalovirus infections Rev. Infect. Dis. 1990; 12 :S701-S710 Crossref Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Straus, S.E. ∙ Cohen, J.I. ∙ Tosato, G. ... NIH conference. Epstein-Barr virus infections: biology, pathogenesis, and management Ann. Intern. Med. 1993; 118 :45-58 Crossref Scopus (367) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the HCV infection rate (26%) in our study was relatively high, which is explained by the high rates in AR (48%) and HCC (39%) ( Table S1 B; Figure S2 ). Intriguingly, we detected a wide range of unique viral epitopes for each viral species that were recognized among different participants, indicating that B cell antigenicity to the same viral species is rather diverse among the participants (right panel in Figure 1 E, Figure S2 ).
To further assess the quality of VirScan, we compared VirScan results with available medical chart entries for HCV, HBV, and HIV testing results and found that VirScan had 45%, 47%, and 70% specificity in detecting HCV, HBV, and HIV, respectively, when compared to these medical record data ( Figure 2 A). In contrast, its sensitivity was 84% for HCV, 48% for HBV, and 73% for HIV. It should be noted that a majority of viral status data from medical charts are unknown or missing ( Table S2 ), which makes this comparison suboptimal. We also examined epitope enrichment of HCV1b, a major viral subtype associated with HCC ( Bruno et al., 2007 7. Bruno, S. ∙ Crosignani, A. ∙ Maisonneuve, P. ... Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b as a major risk factor associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis: a seventeen-year prospective cohort study Hepatology. 2007; 46 :1350-1356 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). An increase in peptide enrichment, corresponding mainly to the core, NS4, and NS5A of HCV1b, was consistently observed among AR and HCC when compared to PC, which could be due to a high B cell antigenicity of the epitopes as indicated by a prediction score ( Figure 2 B). We also examined the presence of HIV and other viruses known to have co-infection with HIV ( Chang et al., 2013; Echavarría, 2008; Stover et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2015 10. Chang, C.C. ∙ Crane, M. ∙ Zhou, J. ... HIV and co-infections Immunol. Rev. 2013; 254 :114-142 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar 14. Echavarría, M. Adenoviruses in immunocompromised hosts Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 21 :704-715 Crossref Scopus (388) PubMed Google Scholar 35. Stover, C.T. ∙ Smith, D.K. ∙ Schmid, D.S. ..., HIV Epidemiology Research Study Group Prevalence of and risk factors for viral infections among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and high-risk HIV-uninfected women J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187 :1388-1396 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, we found an increased co-infection prevalence for HIV with CMV, human adenovirus C, human adenovirus D, influenza B virus, human herpesvirus B and HBV at false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 ( Figure 2 C). Taken together, the above results revealed that VirScan is a reliable method to capture a broad spectrum of viral exposures with a simple serological assay.
We applied a gradient boosting approach to search for the best-fit virus composition that can discriminate HCC from PC ( Figure 3 A). Using 10-fold cross validation and 1,000 random permutations first where 90% of samples were used for training and remaining 10% of samples were used as an independent validation, we found that a VES can significantly discriminate HCC from PC with area under the curve (AUC) values above 0.9 and 0.7 for training and cross validation, respectively ( Figure 3 B). This signature consisted of unique epitopes corresponding to 61 viral strains ( Figure 3 C). Among them, 18 viral strains were positively associated, while the remaining viruses were negatively associated, with HCC. A total of 11 HCV strains, including unique variants such as 3b or Taiwan 1b, were among the main contributing viruses in the signature. This observation was not surprising, since 39% of HCC cases from this cohort were HCV positive. We also found that CMV, HDV, and influenza virus strains H1N1 and H3N2 were enriched in the HCC group. In contrast, 43 viruses, such as human respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus 23, were preferentially depleted in the HCC group ( Table S3 A; Figure 3 C). Weighed VES scores of the 61 viral strains differed significantly between HCC and PC (p < 0.0001), as well as between HCC and AR (p < 0.0001), which was not included for initial signature discovery, and also between AR and PC (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 3 D). There was a significant increase of the VES score among PC, AR, and HCC (p-trend < 0.0001), suggesting that VES was positively linked to hepatocarcinogenesis. We performed phylogenetic analysis of the reactive epitopes of the 61 viral strains to determine similarity among these HCC-related viruses ( Figure 3 E). To search common reactive viral epitopes either enriched or depleted in HCC, we restricted viral epitopes that rank at the top for their association with HCC. These viruses can be divided into eight main branches where different HCV epitopes are clustered together with other viral epitopes, with an exception of cluster #6, which contains six HCV variants (out of 12 viruses) ( Figure 3 E; Table S3 B). In general, there was no clear enrichment within each branch for increased or decreased viruses, suggesting that varying viral epitopes involved in immunoreactivity are commonly shared among HCC.
Since a majority of HCC patients has evidence of CLDs, to avoid this confounding variable, we also compared AR to HCC using the same gradient-boosting approach. We found that an AR versus HCC VES can significantly discriminate HCC from AR or PC with AUC values similar to VES for training and cross validation ( Figures S3 A and S3B). A majority of these VES-related viral strains overlap ( Figure S3 C). To further test the robustness of VES, we performed a 60/40 split where 60% of cases were used for VES discovery while the remaining 40% of cases were used for an independent prediction. We performed 1,000 permutations of the split to establish the confidence interval (CI). Again, we found similar VES with a mean of AUC 0.7 for prediction ( Figures S3 D–S3G). Collectively, these results indicate that a VES consisting of a certain set of viral epitopes is relatively stable and robust in discriminating HCC from AR or PC. Given a limited number of HCC cases in the NCI-UMD cohort, we decided to keep the original VES for further analysis.
To determine if the host genetic background may be linked to VES, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the NCI-UMD cohort, as this approach may help to identify genetic variants susceptible to viral infection and cancer ( Fumagalli et al., 2010; McKay et al., 2017; Pharoah et al., 2013 18. Fumagalli, M. ∙ Pozzoli, U. ∙ Cagliani, R. ... Genome-wide identification of susceptibility alleles for viral infections through a population genetics approach PLoS Genet. 2010; 6 :e1000849 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar 25. McKay, J.D. ∙ Hung, R.J. ∙ Han, Y. ..., SpiroMeta Consortium Large-scale association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci and heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across histological subtypes Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1126-1132 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Pharoah, P.D. ∙ Tsai, Y.Y. ∙ Ramus, S.J. ... GWAS meta-analysis and replication identifies three new susceptibility loci for ovarian cancer Nat. Genet. 2013; 45 :362-370 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). After quality assessment of genomic data using genetic quality control measures, 849 participants (PC = 402; AR = 323; HCC = 124) were included in the analysis. Following the removal of mono-allelic SNPs and the ones that deviate away from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we performed an association test for all the remaining SNPs. To further assess the quality of our GWAS data, we determined whether there was an association between an SNP, rs12979860 in IL28B, and HCV infection. As its favorable genotype, CC has been shown to be associated with better HCV treatment response or natural clearance. We found that rs12979860-CC was significantly associated with HCV genotype 3 with odds ratio (OR) 2.74 (95% CI 1.14–7.97) in a dominant model manner ( Table S4 A). Furthermore, we looked into the SNP associated with 375 epitopes abundances of HCV genotype 2 and 3. We found that the CC allele is associated with a decreased abundance of core epitopes but an increased abundance of NS5B epitopes in the HCV genome ( Figure S4 A; Table S4 B), consistent with a recent study ( Ansari et al., 2017 1. Ansari, M.A. ∙ Pedergnana, V. ∙ L C Ip, C. ..., STOP-HCV Consortium Genome-to-genome analysis highlights the effect of the human innate and adaptive immune systems on the hepatitis C virus Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :666-673 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess VES-associated SNPs, HCC and PC groups were combined and then divided into two groups based on dichotomization of VES scores. In the associated quantile-quantile plots ( Figure S5 B), a wider spread with small differences in allele frequencies was evident with increased slope of the line. Principal-component analysis based on genotyping revealed differences in ethnicity ( Figure S5 C). Manhattan plot revealed significant SNPs between the high- and low-VES score groups ( Figure 4 A). Three SNPs, namely rs34725101, rs4483229, and rs16960234, located in three different genomic regions corresponding to the RHOA, EPB41L4B, and CDH13 loci, respectively, showed associations with VES score groups at the p value <10 −7 significance level ( Figure 4 A; Table S4 C). Among them, rs16960234 was further analyzed because both major and minor alleles of this variant could be detected in this cohort. We also found 127 SNPs with a high linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2 > 0.6) for rs16960234, but none for rs34725101 and rs4483229 ( Figures 4 B–4C; Table S4 D). Seven of the high-LD SNPs of rs16960234 showed the expression profile of CDH13 as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database ( McKay et al., 2017 25. McKay, J.D. ∙ Hung, R.J. ∙ Han, Y. ..., SpiroMeta Consortium Large-scale association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci and heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across histological subtypes Nat. Genet. 2017; 49 :1126-1132 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CDH13 expression levels in the artery tibial tissues from the carriers with risk G/G genotype of rs16960234 were significantly higher than the carriers with protective genotype A/A ( Figure 4 D). To obtain the genotypic effects of rs16960234 in HCC or AR, we generated logistic regression models to calculate the genotypic OR of this SNP in AR or HCC compared to PC ( Figure 4 E). The G/G genotype of rs16960234 showed an increase in risk of HCC in AR compared to PC, OR = 1.89 (95% CI 0.30–11.4), and the risk was higher and statistically significant for HCC, OR = 7.22 (95% CI 1.30–40.0) ( Figure 4 E; Table S4 E). Consistent with the genotypic effect in HCC, the VES score also increased gradually from heterozygous A/G to G/G when compared with A/A ( Figure 4 F). Thus, rs16960234 and its linked gene, CDH13, may be associated with VES and contribute to disease risk.
To further validate the VES identified above for its clinical utility, we analyzed VirScan profiles in the at-risk NIDDK cohort for HCC. This cohort consisted of 173 CLD patients who were enrolled for a natural history study of liver disease with a follow-up of up to 20 years ( Table 1 ; Figure S5 A). Among them, 44 individuals developed HCC. The median number of viral species in the NIDDK cohort was six; i.e., similar to the NCI-UMD cohort. This cohort contained serum samples collected at enrollment (baseline) and at various follow-up time points until a diagnosis of HCC by imaging was made (diagnosis). We then performed logistic regression analysis using VES. In order to capture their performance in either the NCI-UMD cohort or the NIDDK cohort, we generated receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. AUC performance measures thus obtained were 0.89 (95% CI 0.86–0.92) in the NCI-UMD cohort ( Figure 5 A). We observed that VES scores varied substantially among HCC cases in the NCI-UMD cohort with some having scores below the detection limit and others having quite high scores ( Figure 5 B). Interestingly, patients with a high score had a significantly worse survival compared to patients with a low score or a score below the detection limit (logrank p = 0.026 and p-trend = 0.024) ( Figure 5 C). Table S5 A shows the results from univariable and multivariable Cox model survival analysis on several clinicopathologic variables to clarify the independent and additional prognostic value of VES. Among patients from the NIDDK cohort, VirScan data were available for 40 HCC cases at baseline, 129 controls at baseline, 44 HCC cases at diagnosis, and 106 controls at diagnosis. We found that the AUC values were 0.91 (95% CI 0.87–0.96) at baseline ( Figure 5 D) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.97–1) at diagnosis ( Figure 5 E). The performance of VES was superior to AFP, a known HCC diagnostic marker used in clinical practice. The DeLong test showed a significant improvement between VES and AFP (p values 4x10 −12 and 8x10 −10 at baseline and diagnosis, respectively) ( Figures 5 D and 5E). We also found similar trends (p-trend = 0.19) between the levels of VES and overall survival among 44 patients in the NIDDK cohort ( Figure S5 B). In order to assess the time-dependent performance of VES to predict the onset of HCC, we analyzed 104 cancer-free controls and 40 HCC cases (from the NIDDK validation cohort) for which at least two time points were available. In the context of survival modeling, an event was defined as the occurrence of an HCC diagnosis. Under this interpretation, censoring time was defined as the time difference between baseline and follow-up within the cancer-free control group, whereas event time was defined as the time difference between baseline and HCC diagnosis within the HCC group. Table S5 B shows results from a multivariable Cox regression model generated to predict the occurrence of HCC diagnosis based on VES scores at baseline, adjusted for clinical prognostic variables. Moreover, we performed time-dependent ROC curve analysis ( Bansal and Heagerty, 2019; Blanche et al., 2013 3. Bansal, A. ∙ Heagerty, P.J. A comparison of landmark methods and time-dependent ROC methods to evaluate the time-varying performance of prognostic markers for survival outcomes Diagn. Progn. Res. 2019; 3 :14 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 5. Blanche, P. ∙ Dartigues, J.F. ∙ Jacqmin-Gadda, H. Estimating and comparing time-dependent areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for censored event times with competing risks Stat. Med. 2013; 32 :5381-5397 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ) to assess the performance of VES over a range of landmark time points from 1 to 10 years relative to baseline ( Figures 5 F and S5 C), which appears very robust and stable across this range. Interestingly, we found that patients who developed HCC had, on average, much higher VES scores at baseline and at different times of follow-up until HCC diagnosis, when compared to cancer-free at-risk patients who were followed up at a similar time interval without developing HCC ( Figure 5 G). A statistically significant increase in viral exposures (p < 0.05) was observed only for patients who developed HCC over time during the surveillance period in the NIDDK cohort. It appears that HCC cases with a high viral exposure had a more aggressive disease than those with a low viral exposure, and that VES was a robust indicator of early onset of HCC in this prospective cohort. Furthermore, the prediction performance of AR versus HCC based on VES was superior to other clinical indicators from the patient charts, such as AFP, alanine transaminase (ALT), cirrhosis and platelet counts, as well as the combination of all key clinical variables, as shown by analyses of the NIDDK cohort at baseline ( Figure 5 H), which agree qualitatively with those of NIDDK at diagnosis ( Figure S5 D) and the NCI-UMD cohort ( Figure S5 E). An association of VES and HCC was similarly found in both HCV-positive and HCV-negative patients ( Table S5 C).

Section: Discussion

Detecting cancer at an early stage, preferably before it is symptomatic, may provide an opportunity in achieving a cure and improving cancer-related mortality. Evidence suggests that earlier detection of cancer may potentially improve survival for some cancer types such as cervical and colon cancers. A conventional approach is to develop biomarkers specific for cancer cells in order to determine cancer early diagnosis. CancerSEEK is an emerging platform with a good sensitivity and specificity to clinically detected multiple cancer types, which profiles circulating cell-free DNA (ctDNA) for driver mutations presumably shed from tumor cells ( Cohen et al., 2018 12. Cohen, J.D. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test Science. 2018; 359 :926-930 Crossref Scopus (1799) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a recent study offers a cautionary note using cancer gene panels in ctDNA because of its high false positive rate among healthy individuals ( Liu et al., 2019a 22. Liu, J. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Wang, J. ... Biological background of the genomic variations of cf-DNA in healthy individuals Ann. Oncol. 2019; 30 :464-470 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar ). Molecular and biological heterogeneity of cancer cells contributed by complex etiological landscape creates a dilemma as to how to best design cancer-specific diagnostic panels effective for early cancer detection. As such, a continuous debate has been carried out in recent decades for many malignant diseases, including HCC, as to whether available methods are adequate in achieving this goal ( Sherman et al., 2012; Shieh et al., 2016 32. Sherman, M. ∙ Bruix, J. ∙ Porayko, M. ..., AASLD Practice Guidelines Committee Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma: the rationale for the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases recommendations Hepatology. 2012; 56 :793-796 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar 33.

HCC is a unique malignancy in which we know most of the major causative etiologies ( Wang and Thorgeirsson, 2014 40. Wang, X.W. ∙ Thorgeirsson, S.S. The biological and clinical challenge of liver cancer heterogeneity Hepat. Oncol. 2014; 1 :349-353 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). However, defining biomarkers specific for HCC cells has been challenging because of its complex genomic landscape with extensive intratumor and intertumor heterogeneities. Are there common features shared among HCC patients to be used as surrogates for early detection? An emerging concept is that an interplay between viral infection and host genetic background is crucial for maintaining virome homeostasis or causing human disease ( Virgin, 2014 39. Virgin, H.W. The virome in mammalian physiology and disease Cell. 2014; 157 :142-150 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this study, we have attempted to assess how a history of viral exposures in an individual is associated with its risk to develop HCC. Using a synthetic viral scan technology (VirScan) with a simple blood test ( Xu et al., 2015 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found a VES that could discriminate HCC with a high confidence from at-risk individuals or from healthy volunteers. Remarkably, this signature was able to identify individuals at a median follow-up year of 8.8 prior to a clinical diagnosis of HCC. Thus, our results may offer a sensitive tool applicable to the HCC surveillance program to improve early diagnosis.
The current study took the advantage of a simple tool to profile serological samples to link an individual’s history of viral infection and corresponding response to early onset of HCC. Our strategy was first to search VES using a case control design that includes HCC cases as well as at-risk individuals with CLDs and healthy volunteers matched by age, sex, and race. A VES that can discriminate HCC from at-risk and healthy individuals was then validated using a prospective cohort of sequentially enrolled at-risk patients who were followed up for the development of HCC. Interestingly, the VES consists of known HCC etiologies such as HCV, HBV, and HDV, but also includes other viruses such as EBV, CMV, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and influenza A virus, among others. A few features are noted. First, HCV appears as a major etiological factor driving VES, but an extended heterogeneity in various HCV subtypes are noted in both NCI-UMD and NIDDK cohorts. Second, a set of viruses are enriched while many others, including HBV, are depleted in HCC patients. The nature of a potential impact of detected viruses in VES other than HBV, HCV, and HDV on HCC pathogenesis is unknown at the present time. One plausible explanation is that some of the detected viruses and the levels of viral burden may reflect how individuals react to a history of viral exposure and how an individual’s intrinsic immune surveillance unique to linked genetic background may react to viral infection. Encouragingly, GWAS analysis revealed that several SNPs have a strong association with a history of viral infection. Among them, rs16960234 in CDH13 has the strongest link to viral infection, a gene previously linked to CMV infection ( Børglum et al., 2014 6. Børglum, A.D. ∙ Demontis, D. ∙ Grove, J. ..., GROUP investigators10 Genome-wide study of association and interaction with maternal cytomegalovirus infection suggests new schizophrenia loci Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19 :325-333 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the molecular mechanisms of CDH13 in human cancer are unknown, some studies suggest that its expression may be associated with tumorigenesis ( Takeuchi et al., 2000 37. Takeuchi, T. ∙ Misaki, A. ∙ Liang, S.B. ... Expression of T-cadherin (CDH13, H-Cadherin) in human brain and its characteristics as a negative growth regulator of epidermal growth factor in neuroblastoma cells J. Neurochem. 2000; 74 :1489-1497 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether this variant is linked to viral infection in general remains to be further validated.
It should be noted that VES discovery was based on a case-control study design with 150 HCC cases. Given the nature of both molecular and clinical heterogeneity in HCC, we were unable to test all possible clinical covariables that may confound VES classification. To overcome this limitation, we used both 10-fold cross validation and 60/40 split approaches with random permutations to test the robustness of VES. Remarkably, various approaches yielded VES with similar viral compositions and HCC classification when compared to healthy volunteers or at-risk individuals. Moreover, the VES could independently classify HCC in a prospective at-risk population, confirming the robustness of VES in HCC diagnosis. These results suggest a clinical utility of VES as a surveillance tool to screen early onset of HCC, thereby increasing the opportunity for HCC patients receiving curative therapies. While an initial discovery of VES was validated using a prospective cohort with a longitudinal follow up, these cohorts were used retrospectively. It is important to develop a CLIA-certified diagnostic assay that consists of VES and then test its ability to reduce HCC mortality in a randomized trial, similar to the study of lung cancer ( de Koning et al., 2020 13. de Koning, H.J. ∙ van der Aalst, C.M. ∙ de Jong, P.A. ... Reduced Lung-Cancer Mortality with Volume CT Screening in a Randomized Trial N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382 :503-513 Crossref Scopus (1936) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The current method of VirScan is based on the phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) technology that provides a powerful approach for analyzing antibody-repertoire binding specificities with high throughput and at low cost to all known human viruses ( Mohan et al., 2018 26. Mohan, D. ∙ Wansley, D.L. ∙ Sie, B.M. ... PhIP-Seq characterization of serum antibodies using oligonucleotide-encoded peptidomes Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :1958-1978 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). How accurate and sensitive is the VirScan method? Comparing VirScan results (as predicted values of HCV and HBV status) against those from medical charts of the NCI-UMD cohort (as true values), we found that VirScan shows better accuracy (0.73, 95% CI 0.67–0.79), sensitivity (0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.89), and positive predictive value (0.80, 95% CI 0.76–0.84) for HCV than the accuracy (0.48, 95% CI 0.41–0.54), sensitivity (0.48, 95% CI 0.40–0.57), and positive predictive value (0.55, 95% CI 0.49–0.61) for HBV. HCV encodes a large polyprotein consisting of ∼3,000 amino acids, which is cleaved co- and post-translationally into ten different proteins associated with intracellular membranes ( Bartenschlager et al., 2013 4. Bartenschlager, R. ∙ Lohmann, V. ∙ Penin, F. The molecular and structural basis of advanced antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11 :482-496 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistently, we found that the HCV antigen reactivity is largely overlapped with the predicted antigenicity score by the B cell epitope prediction method coinciding with the epitopes to be presented at the surface of the cellular membrane. Consistent with early reports for the likelihood of coinfection of HIV and other viruses associated with AIDS and non-AIDS diseases ( Lichtner et al., 2015; Slyker et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015 21. Lichtner, M. ∙ Cicconi, P. ∙ Vita, S. ..., ICONA Foundation Study Cytomegalovirus coinfection is associated with an increased risk of severe non-AIDS-defining events in a large cohort of HIV-infected patients J. Infect. Dis. 2015; 211 :178-186 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar 34. Slyker, J.A. ∙ Casper, C. ∙ Tapia, K. ... Clinical and virologic manifestations of primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in Kenyan infants born to HIV-infected women J. Infect. Dis. 2013; 207 :1798-1806 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), we found evidence of coinfection between HIV and viruses such as HBV, herpesvirus 8 and adenovirus D, influenza B virus, adenovirus C, and CMV in patients enrolled in the NCI-UMD cohort. Interestingly, we found that history of HCV infection is prevalent among at-risk (48%) and HCC patients (39%), and healthy volunteers (4%) who reside in Maryland. This is in contrast to an estimate prevalence of about 4.6 million persons (∼1.5%) infected with HCV in the US ( Edlin et al., 2015 15. Edlin, B.R. ∙ Eckhardt, B.J. ∙ Shu, M.A. ... Toward a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States Hepatology. 2015; 62 :1353-1363 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ). It should be noted that 7.5%–44% of incarcerated individuals and 4%–38% of hospitalized patients tested positive for HCV ( Edlin et al., 2015 15. Edlin, B.R. ∙ Eckhardt, B.J. ∙ Shu, M.A. ... Toward a more accurate estimate of the prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States Hepatology. 2015; 62 :1353-1363 Crossref Scopus (345) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the current surveys underestimate the prevalence of HCV infection. In contrast, while we observed 2.6% of healthy individuals in the NCI-UMD study showing evidence of HBV infection, more than 800,000 chronic HBV carriers were detected during 2011–2012 in the noninstitutional US population ( Roberts et al., 2016 29. Roberts, H. ∙ Kruszon-Moran, D. ∙ Ly, K.N. ... Prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in U.S. households: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1988-2012 Hepatology. 2016; 63 :388-397 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). It seems that the current survey methods may underestimate the prevalence ofHBV and HCV. This is important, as both HBV and HCV are major causative factors for HCC. It should also be noted that the sensitivity and specificity of HBV detection by VirScan are relatively low. Due to a significant fraction of missing data for medical test results for HBV, we were not able to perform in-depth correlation analysis of HBV genotypes and VES-based viral loads. This is a limitation of this study. It is worth speculating that cancer-prone individuals may perceive viral epitopes differently compared to healthy individuals. An in-depth correlative analysis between individual viral epitopes, a host’s TCR and BCR profile and genetic background may help to understand mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity. VirScan is a reliable method for profiling viral exposure collectively and is both scalable (regarding to sample throughput) and non-invasive, which makes it amenable for surveillance and early detection of HCC.
In conclusion, we performed the largest study to date analyzing serological samples using a high throughput virome technology in patients with HCC, and the first one, to our knowledge, utilizing VESs as cancer biomarkers for early onset of HCC. The VES was validated in at-risk patients with a longitudinal design for HCC diagnosis. A prospective randomized study with a large population is warranted to evaluate its utility in HCC surveillance.

To measure virome-host interplay, 899 participants were recruited; all were from the greater Baltimore area between 2003 and 2016. All participants voluntarily signed informed consent for collection and analysis of blood and cheek swab samples under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocols at the National Institutes of Health. Participants were classified into three groups, as follows: healthy individuals without any diagnosis of liver disease were classified as population controls (PC, n = 412); patients diagnosed with chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), aflatoxins from fungal contamination, alcohol, nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were classified as at-risk (AR, n = 337); and patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma were classified in the third group (HCC, n = 150). All clinic measurements were covered by NCT0091375 ( clinicaltrials.gov ) with liver disease status as the enrollment criteria. Serum and matching buffy coat or cheek swab were collected at the time of interview.
This cohort consisted of 173 patients with chronic liver disease that included 44 HCC cases with 129 controls matched by liver disease etiology, age and sex. Patients were at-risk individuals for the development of HCC who were enrolled in a natural history protocol ( clinicaltrials.gov number; NCT0001971) between 1991 and 2017 with longitudinal follow-up, at least annually with serologic testing and imaging, for up to 20 years. Only cases with complete clinical and laboratory data and available longitudinal serologic samples were selected for analysis. The 44 HCC cases were sequentially identified out of 3,067 patients followed in this natural history study on chronic liver disease, and the controls were matched on a 2:1 basis as described above. HCC was diagnosed by radiologic imaging and/or liver biopsy as described by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines ( Marrero et al., 2018 24. Marrero, J.A. ∙ Kulik, L.M. ∙ Sirlin, C.B. ... Diagnosis, Staging, and Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: 2018 Practice Guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Hepatology. 2018; 68 :723-750 Crossref Scopus (3122) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the purposes of this analysis, stored serum samples (−80°C) were analyzed at study entry (baseline) and at recurrent time points until the time of HCC diagnosis.
All participants were volunteers with informed consent for collection and analysis of blood samples under the IRB-approved protocols at NCI and NIDDK.
Sera were prepared from blood samples and then stored at −80°C for research (protocols previously listed) (n = 899 from NCI-UMD, n = 488 from NIDDK). Buffy coat and cheek swab samples were collected and stored at −80°C for research (protocols previously listed) (n = 849 from NCI-UMD).
The study was approved by the NCI and NIDDK institutional review boards. All participants provided written informed consent.
The T7 phage library displays the virome peptide library. It was created to cover 56-amino acid (aa) peptide titling from all viral proteins with 28-aa overlap, which has been published previously2. The T7 library was proliferated using BLT5403 E.coli. Briefly, to keep the diversity of phage-displayed libraries during T7 phage proliferation, the agar plates were used as isolated compartments of the T7 phage library with M9LB/Ampicillin with for 3 to 4 h. The plates were checked at every 20 min after 2.5 h until the plates were just cleared, so that the final phage titer was high and also maintain the heterogeneity of the phage library. To elute the phage, each plate was covered with 10 mL of Phage Extraction Buffer and placed on a rocking platform at 4°C overnight. The phage library was harvested by tipping the plate slightly. Combine the extraction buffer from all the plates in several Falcon tubes. 0.5 mL chloroform was added to each 50 mL Falcon tube and gently mixed. The tubes were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 15 min to clarify the lysate and transfer the supernatant to a sterile bottle. DMSO was added to final volume of 10% to the supernatant. The expanded library was aliquot and snapped freeze in liquid nitrogen. Then the expanded library was stored in −80°C freezer. The titer of the amplified library was determined by plaque assay.
The library was sampled and lysed at 95C for 10min. After two rounds of PCR were performed to amplify and index the lysed bacteriophage DNA product. After gel extraction, the size and quality of libraries were assessed on a Bioanalyzer instrument from Agilent. The DNA samples were sent for sequencing. Then, the sequencing was done at Sequencing Facility - Illumina (CCR) using 50bp single round sequenced the DNA base read cycle on Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (1X50 bp) obtained ∼100 million to 200 million reads per lane (around 1,000,000 reads per sample). Total coverage rate is more than 99.99% of designed peptides displayed in T7 phage library.
We performed phage immunoprecipitation and sequencing by using a slightly modified version of previously published PhIP-Seq protocols ( Mohan et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2015 26. Mohan, D. ∙ Wansley, D.L. ∙ Sie, B.M. ... PhIP-Seq characterization of serum antibodies using oligonucleotide-encoded peptidomes Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :1958-1978 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar 41. Xu, G.J. ∙ Kula, T. ∙ Xu, Q. ... Viral immunology. Comprehensive serological profiling of human populations using a synthetic human virome Science. 2015; 348 :aaa0698 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). First, 96-deep-well plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin in TBST overnight on a rotator at 4°C. The diluted 1ml bacteriophage library were added in each blocked well. Serum samples, containing 2mg IgG, were mixed with the bacteriophage library. Two technical replicates for each sample were set up. After overnight rotation as the incubation, protein A and protein G Dynabeads were added to each well. With another 4 h incubation on a rotator at 4°C, with a 96-well magnetic stand, the beads were washed for three times with 400 mL of PhIP-Seq wash buffer. Next, the beads were resuspended in water and adhered phages were lysed at 95°C for 10 min. The blank PBS samples instead of serum were also set up as negative controls on each plate. Two rounds of PCR were performed to amplify and multiplex on the lysed bacteriophage DNA product. After the second round of PCR, PCR products were pooled equimolar amounts of all 192 samples for gel extraction. After gel extraction, the size and quality of libraries were assessed on a Bioanalyzer instrument from Agilent. The DNA samples were aliquot and stored at −80°C until sequencing. Then, the sequencing was done at Sequencing Facility - Illumina (CCR) using 50bp single round sequenced the DNA base read protocol on Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (1X50 bp) obtained ∼100 million to 200 million reads per lane (around 1 million reads per sample). Raw data from Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform was processed by BCL2FASTQ2 for demultiplexing and converting binary base calls and qualities to fastq format. The fastq files were mapped to original virome peptide reference sequences by using Bowtie program. Two sequencing samples were cut off from next-step analysis.as their reads were less than 30,000. The initial informatics and statistical analysis were performed by using a slightly modified version of the previously published technique (8, 10). Briefly, the scatterplots of the –log10(p values) and a sliding window of width 0.005 from 0 to 2 across the axis of one replicate were used. We found that the distribution of the threshold –log10 (p value) was centered around a mode of ∼2.358 ( Figure S1 B). We eliminated the 593 hits that came up in at least 3 of the 22 immunoprecipitations with PBS beads alone blank sample. We also filtered out any peptides that were not enriched in at least two of the samples. A threshold number of hits per virus was set based on the size of the virus. If the hit shared a subsequence of at least 7 aa with any hit previously observed in any of the viruses from that sample, that hit was considered to be from a cross-reactive antibody and would be ignored for that virus. The peptide hits, which do not share any linear epitopes, were summed to be strain and species score data. The final score was compared for each virus to the threshold for that virus to determine whether the sample is positive for exposure to that virus. The raw count data were calculated based on –log10(p value) = 2.358 cutoff.
Peptide sequence of HCV1b from PhIP is used to generate the prediction score based on bepipred linear epitope prediction for B cell.
DNA extraction from buffy coat or lymphocyte samples was performed following the manufacturer’s instruction (DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, QIAGEN). The eluted DNA was stored at −20°C for further analysis.
Illumina OmniExpress was applied for the SNP array. Genotyping was performed on 200 ng of genomic DNA using Illumina Infinium HTS Global Screening Arrays on an Illumina iScan system at the Genomic Share Resource of University of Hawaii Cancer Center. The raw genotyping data were processed by Illumina GenomeStudio software 2.0. Quality control was performed using PLINK version 2.0 ( http://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/2.0 ). Samples with a genotyping call rate < 95% were removed and 849 individuals remained. SNPs with mono-allelic and MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) < 0.05, HWE (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) < 10-4, and call rate < 95%, were excluded. After further considering the ones in high linkage disequilibrium, we obtained roughly 500,000 SNPs for the association study. Therefore, the suggestive genome-wide significant p value threshold in current study was set at 10 −7 as 0.05/5x10 5 using Bonferroni correction. We identified three and 849 individuals remained. SNPs with mono-allelic and MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) < 0.05, HWE (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) < 10-4, and call rate < 95%, were excluded. After further considering the ones in high linkage disequilibrium, we obtained roughly 500,000 SNPs for the association study. Therefore, the suggestive genome-wide significant p value threshold in current study was set at 10 −7 as 0.05/5x10 5 using Bonferroni correction. We identified three independent loci in three regions were associated with virus feature phenotype at p < 10 −7 using PLINK. LocusZoom was used to plot regional signals associated with phenotype with LD and recombination rate calculated from 1000 Genomes. LD structure of signals were further investigated with Haploview. A linear regression with additive model was applied to estimate the genotypic effect of SNP contributed to the disease or phenotype.
IgG, IgA and IgG4 levels in serum were measured using human ELISA kits (Bethyl and Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The ELISA results were obtained using a microplate absorbance reader from (Bio-Rad).
To identify differences between populations, Xgboost was used to calculate the significance of association of virus exposure traits with HCC versus PC.
XGBoost is a recently developed software, which implements a machine learning approach of regression and classification using ensemble learning with gradient tree boosting ( https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ). It is designed to increase the scalability and acceleration of optimized computation for practical use. XGBoost includes three types of parameters: general, booster and task. Each of these types has several hyperparameters, such as maximum depth of the regression trees, number of weak learners, learning rate, regularization, etc, that need to be tuned. We tuned these parameters using a grid search to maximize the mean AUC value computed from 10-fold cross validation on the training data. After finding the optimal values of the hyperparameters, we constructed the model using the following main parameter setting: max_depth = 3, eta = 0.1, subsample = 1, colsample_bytree = 0.5, and min_child_weight = 1. Then Xgboost was applied to the entire dataset with 200 boosting iterations.
To avoid over-fitting, we applied several approaches according to the document of XGBoost. First, we controlled model complexity, and adjust parameters max_depth, min_child_weight and gamma. Second, we added randomness to make training robust to noise and adjust parameters, subsample and colsample. Third, we introduce early stopping to training models to avoid overfitting. It stops the training procedure once the performance on the test dataset has not improved after a fixed number of training iterations. It avoids overfitting by attempting to automatically select the inflection point where performance on the test dataset starts to decrease while performance on the training dataset continues to improve as the model starts to overfit. We set to stop model training at least 20 rounds when no improvement was observed in AUC value was set (early_stopping_rounds = 20). The best iteration model was then used as the final model. XGBoost automatically conducts feature selection and calculates the importance for each feature. We tested multiple subsets of the features to achieve the highest AUC and decided to take all the output features for further analysis. For each training and testing sample, we also generated a virus feature score based on the features we selected implemented in the XGBoost classification prediction.
The full protein library sequences of 61 feature virus species were obtained from VirScan reference library and stored in fasta format. A multiple sequence alignment tool, Clustal Omega ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ ) was used to generate alignments with default parameters. The phylogenetic trees were then imported to ITOL ( https://itol.embl.de/itol.cgi ) for further visualization and labeling in normal display mode.
All analyses were conducted in R and GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA) used for statistical analyses. Data are presented either as means ± SEM or medians of continuous values and were analyzed by a two-sided Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney test used for comparison of two groups, respectively. Fisher’s exact X2 t test was used to calculate statistical significance of categorical values between groups. Two-tail P values with no more than 0.05 were considered significant. Linear regression was used to determine the correlation between two different variables.
All HCC patients were classified into high, low or below viral feature score groups based on viral feature levels. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival were estimated for each group and compared using the log rank test. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to assess associations between different viral feature level along with several clinical factors. The ability of clinical and viral features in predicting HCC was assessed by computing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using the logistic regression in R. Area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated for these variables. Comparison of ROC curves obtained from different feature sets was assessed by the DeLong test.
Cox regression was performed using the R package survival (version 3.1-8). In order to analyze time-dependent ROC curves and corresponding AUC values, the R package timeROC (version 0.4)( Blanche et al., 2013 5. Blanche, P. ∙ Dartigues, J.F. ∙ Jacqmin-Gadda, H. Estimating and comparing time-dependent areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for censored event times with competing risks Stat. Med. 2013; 32 :5381-5397 Crossref Scopus (1017) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used.
The NCI-UMD (Maryland) cohort consisted of 899 sequentially enrolled participants ( clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT0091375) and included 150 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases, 337 at-risk (AR) individuals and 412 population control (PC) healthy volunteers matched by age and sex ( Table S1 A). The NIDDK cohort ( clinicaltrials.gov number; NCT0001971) consisted of 129 AR individuals without HCC and 44 AR individuals with HCC ( Table 1 ).
