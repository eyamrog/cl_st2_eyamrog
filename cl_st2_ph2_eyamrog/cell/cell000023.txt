Title: Co-incidence of Damage and Microbial Patterns Controls Localized Immune Responses in Roots


Abstract: Summary

Recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) is crucial for the plant’s immune response. How this sophisticated perception system can be usefully deployed in roots, continuously exposed to microbes, remains a mystery. By analyzing MAMP receptor expression and response at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis, we observed that differentiated outer cell layers show low expression of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and lack MAMP responsiveness. Yet, these cells can be gated to become responsive by neighbor cell damage. Laser ablation of small cell clusters strongly upregulates PRR expression in their vicinity, and elevated receptor expression is sufficient to induce responsiveness in non-responsive cells. Finally, localized damage also leads to immune responses to otherwise non-immunogenic, beneficial bacteria. Damage-gating is overridden by receptor overexpression, which antagonizes colonization. Our findings that cellular damage can “switch on” local immune responses helps to conceptualize how MAMP perception can be used despite the presence of microbial patterns in the soil.

Section: Introduction

A number of defined molecular patterns and corresponding receptors have been identified and shown to elicit a conserved set of molecular responses ( Macho and Zipfel, 2014 44. Macho, A.P. ∙ Zipfel, C. Plant PRRs and the activation of innate immune signaling Mol. Cell. 2014; 54 :263-272 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (686) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, identical microbial patterns from symbiotic or commensal microbes should be equally perceived ( Pel and Pieterse, 2013 52. Pel, M.J.C. ∙ Pieterse, C.M.J. Microbial recognition and evasion of host immunity J. Exp. Bot. 2013; 64 :1237-1248 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is especially apparent in the microbe-rich soil environment of roots, whose outer cell layers do not possess protective barriers comparable to leaves. Recent breakthroughs in root microbiome research have heightened the interest in understanding how constitutive activation of PRRs by non-pathogenic microbes is avoided, while maintaining their effectiveness in defense ( Castrillo et al., 2017; Finkel et al., 2017; Garrido-Oter et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019 11.

The molecular outlines of microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) perception were characterized in systems allowing for quantitative, time-resolved measurements of early responses ( Felix et al., 1999 18. Felix, G. ∙ Duran, J.D. ∙ Volko, S. ... Plants have a sensitive perception system for the most conserved domain of bacterial flagellin Plant J. 1999; 18 :265-276 Crossref Scopus (1234) PubMed Google Scholar ). In Arabidopsis ( Chinchilla et al., 2006; Gómez-Gómez et al., 1999 13. Chinchilla, D. ∙ Bauer, Z. ∙ Regenass, M. ...

A single locus determines sensitivity to bacterial flagellin in Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 1999; 18 :277-284 Crossref Scopus (546) PubMed Google Scholar ), leaf-disk reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) blots, quantitative PCR (qPCR), or genome-wide transcription profiling became popular tools ( Zipfel et al., 2004, 2006 76.

Although such assays establish the molecular components of PRR signal transduction, they do not allow for a meaningful degree of spatial resolution, because they average cellular responses across entire organs. Actual, initial pathogen/microbe contacts, however, are localized to a few cells and cell types and this highly relevant spatial dimension of responses has remained largely unresolved. When studied, significant differences between single-cell and whole seedling responses were observed ( Thor and Peiter, 2014 65. Thor, K. ∙ Peiter, E. Cytosolic calcium signals elicited by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern flg22 in stomatal guard cells are of an oscillatory nature New Phytol. 2014; 204 :873-881 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Roots mount an autonomous MAMP response ( Poncini et al., 2017; Wyrsch et al., 2015 55. Poncini, L. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Dénervaud Tendon, V. ... In roots of Arabidopsis thaliana , the damage-associated molecular pattern AtPep1 is a stronger elicitor of immune signalling than flg22 or the chitin heptamer PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0185808 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar 71.

Tissue-specific FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) expression in roots restores immune responses in Arabidopsis fls2 mutants New Phytol. 2015; 206 :774-784 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporters, or callose deposition, revealed a restricted response to high concentrations of the bacterial MAMP, flg22, mainly in the root cap and root transition/elongation zone ( Jacobs et al., 2011; Millet et al., 2010 32. Jacobs, S. ∙ Zechmann, B. ∙ Molitor, A. ... Broad-spectrum suppression of innate immunity is required for colonization of Arabidopsis roots by the fungus Piriformospora indica Plant Physiol. 2011; 156 :726-740 Crossref Scopus (243) PubMed Google Scholar 47.

Innate immune responses activated in Arabidopsis roots by microbe-associated molecular patterns Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :973-990 Crossref Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ). GUS reporter assays are destructive, however, and remain below single-cell or tissue resolution. Moreover, the causes of this spatially restricted MAMP response have remained obscure, as well as its potential biological relevance.
In order to address these questions, we combined new and recently published fluorescent marker lines, based on a triple mVENUS fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS-3xmVENUS) ( Poncini et al., 2017; Vermeer et al., 2014 55. Poncini, L. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Dénervaud Tendon, V. ...

A spatial accommodation by neighboring cells is required for organ initiation in Arabidopsis Science. 2014; 343 :178-183 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). This allows for analysis of MAMP responses in vivo and at true cellular resolution. These highly sensitive markers were selected for good expression and stable responses, across transgenic lines and in successive generations. The promoters selected were based on well-established and widely used MAMP responsive genes. PER5 ( PEROXIDASE 5 ) was chosen from public databases as a strong and early MAMP-induced gene that is highly induced in roots ( Hruz et al., 2008; Wyrsch et al., 2015 31. Hruz, T. ∙ Laule, O. ∙ Szabo, G. ... Genevestigator v3: a reference expression database for the meta-analysis of transcriptomes Adv. Bioinforma. 2008; 2008 :420747 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 71.

Interplay and overlap with Avr gene-dependent defense responses and bacterial pathogenesis Plant Physiol. 2004; 135 :1113-1128 Crossref Scopus (471) PubMed Google Scholar ). MYB51 ( MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 51 ) was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by MAMPs and to control production of major Arabidopsis defense metabolites ( Clay et al., 2009; Gigolashvili et al., 2007 15. Clay, N.K. ∙ Adio, A.M. ∙ Denoux, C. ... Glucosinolate metabolites required for an Arabidopsis innate immune response Science. 2009; 323 :95-101 Crossref Scopus (864) PubMed Google Scholar 23.

The transcription factor HIG1/MYB51 regulates indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 2007; 50 :886-901 Crossref Scopus (327) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also generated FRK1 ( FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 ), a receptor-like protein of unknown function shown to be a strong and early MAMP-induced transcript ( Asai et al., 2002; Boudsocq et al., 2010 3.

Section: Results

Among the four MAMP markers generated, we found that PER5 and FRK1 , especially, displayed very low background before, and good induction upon, stimulation ( Figures 1 A–1C and S1 A) ( Poncini et al., 2017 55. Poncini, L. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Dénervaud Tendon, V. ... In roots of Arabidopsis thaliana , the damage-associated molecular pattern AtPep1 is a stronger elicitor of immune signalling than flg22 or the chitin heptamer PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0185808 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). For precise assignment of signals to specific cells and cell types, we generated double marker lines with a constitutively expressed, plasma membrane-targeted red fluorescent protein ( Figure 1 D). Alternatively, counterstaining with the red fluorescent cell wall stain propidium iodide (PI) was done.
Using these markers, we confirmed that MAMP-responses are confined to the root cap, transition/elongation zone, with an absent, or orders-of-magnitudes weaker, response in differentiated root parts, even at high doses of flg22 (1 μM) ( Figures 1 A–1C and S1 A) ( Millet et al., 2010 47. Millet, Y.A. ∙ Danna, C.H. ∙ Clay, N.K. ... Innate immune responses activated in Arabidopsis roots by microbe-associated molecular patterns Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :973-990 Crossref Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ). flg22, a peptide fragment of bacterial flagellin and a well-established elicitor in plants, was used as a prototypical MAMP ( Felix et al., 1999 18. Felix, G. ∙ Duran, J.D. ∙ Volko, S. ... Plants have a sensitive perception system for the most conserved domain of bacterial flagellin Plant J. 1999; 18 :265-276 Crossref Scopus (1234) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lack of responses in differentiated roots is not due to a problem with peptide penetration, because the active, fluorescently labeled flg22 (TAMRA-flg22) fully penetrated the root until the endodermal diffusion barrier ( Figures S1 B and S1C). Thus, the absence of responses in the endodermis, cortex, and epidermis are not due to a block in MAMP penetration, while absence in the differentiated stele might be due to the endodermal diffusion barrier. The spatially restricted responses we observe are not observed only for flg22, because other MAMPs, such as nlp20 or a medium-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acid (3-OH-C10:0) ( Böhm et al., 2014; Kutschera et al., 2019 7. Böhm, H. ∙ Albert, I. ∙ Oome, S. ... A conserved peptide pattern from a widespread microbial virulence factor triggers pattern-induced immunity in Arabidopsis PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1004491 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar 38. Kutschera, A. ∙ Dawid, C. ∙ Gisch, N. ... Bacterial medium-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acid metabolites trigger immunity in Arabidopsis plants Science. 2019; 364 :178-181 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ), display very similar response patterns ( Figure S1 D). elf18, another well-characterized bacterial MAMP ( Kunze et al., 2004 37. Kunze, G. ∙ Zipfel, C. ∙ Robatzek, S. ... The N terminus of bacterial elongation factor Tu elicits innate immunity in Arabidopsis plants Plant Cell. 2004; 16 :3496-3507 Crossref Scopus (678) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed very little response in roots overall, while the fungal chitin was the only MAMP that elicited some direct response in the differentiated zone.
Our high-resolution mapping of MAMP/flg22 responses revealed intriguing, spatially confined exceptions to the attenuated MAMP responses in differentiated roots. The first exception are emerging lateral roots, where adjacent cortical cells—that have become pushed, separated, possibly damaged, by the emerging primordium—consistently showed a strong response to MAMP treatment ( Figures 1 D, 1F, S1 E, and S1F). The second exception we observed was a flg22 responsiveness in cells whose immediate neighbor had undergone sporadic cell death ( Figures 1 E, 1G, and S1 G). Thus, differentiated roots have the capacity to respond to MAMPs and this responsiveness can be induced in a highly localized manner.
The intriguing spatial association of MAMP responsiveness and neighbor-cell-death prompted us to induce reproducible and precise cellular damage and observe its effect on flg22 responsiveness. By ablating small clusters of distinct root cell types with a pulsed infrared laser, we observed a strong enhancement of flg22 responsiveness in immediately neighboring cell layers only ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S2 A, and S2B). Importantly, ablation on its own led to no, or very little, induction of MAMP marker genes ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S2 A, and S2B), showing that cellular damage per se is insufficient to induce a robust MAMP response. Already single-cell ablations induced flg22 responsiveness, but the effects became gradually more pronounced when more cells were ablated ( Figures S2 C and S2D), prompting us to use ablation of three or four cells as our standard. Time-lapse analysis showed that the earliest observable responses occurred at 4 h after flg22 treatment ( Figure S3 ), leading us to use 6 h for most treatments. Introgression of our marker lines into an fls2 mutant demonstrated a full dependency of the responses on a functional FLS2 receptor ( Figures S2 E and S2F). Interestingly, we observed directionality to damage induction, with inward-lying tissue layers generally responding the strongest. Cells of the stele responded strongly to flg22 upon epidermis, cortex, and endodermis ablation, while ablation of an epidermal cell did not cause flg22-responsiveness in epidermal neighbors ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S2 A, and S2B). To explain the lack of responses in epidermal neighbors, one could postulate that mechanical stimulation is required for induction. Sudden pressure differences would only occur in cortex, but not in epidermal cells upon ablation, because epidermal cells do not experience counter-pressure from overlying cells. Another possibility might be that a collapse of plasmodesmatal integrity is perceived, and there are differences in quality and degree of plasmodesmatal connections between cortical and epidermal neighbors.
In the differentiated zone, absence of MAMP responsiveness without damage—even at high levels of flg22 (1 μM)—makes observation of the enhancement of MAMP responsiveness upon damage very obvious, leading to an essentially switch-like, qualitative change. Many commensal and root-pathogenic bacteria, however, preferentially colonize the root transition/elongation zone, which displays a direct response to high-doses of flg22, not requiring damage. Yet, when we used 100 nM of flg22, we saw only weak induction of MAMP responses in this zone ( Figures 2 C and 2D). In this situation of suboptimal stimulation, epidermal cell damage strongly enhanced response to flg22 in cortical cells, similar to the differentiation zone. Thus, although most easily observed in differentiated roots, damage-induced enhancement of MAMP responsiveness might be a wide-spread, possibly general, phenomenon in roots.
How cellular damage is perceived by neighboring cells is not well understood, but one important element is thought to be the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which can be abundant, but largely cytosolic molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or small peptides, such as AtPEP1 ( Roux and Steinebrunner, 2007; Toyota et al., 2018; Hander et al., 2019 29. Hander, T. ∙ Fernández-Fernández, Á.D. ∙ Kumpf, R.P. ...

In plants, cell wall-breakdown products, such as oligogalacturonides (OGs) and cellobiose are additionally acting as DAMPs ( Boller and Felix, 2009; Lotze et al., 2007; Souza et al., 2017 8. Boller, T. ∙ Felix, G. A renaissance of elicitors: perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns and danger signals by pattern-recognition receptors Annu. Rev.

Souza, C.A. ∙ Li, S. ∙ Lin, A.Z. ... Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses Plant Physiol. 2017; 173 :2383-2398 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, even when applied systemically at high concentrations, either individually or as a cocktail, DAMPs alone were not able to induce the strong and consistent flg22 responsiveness that we observe upon actual cellular damage ( Figures 3 A and 3B). AtPEP1 treatment alone caused some slight induction of FRK1 —but not PER5 responsiveness—in the stele, but could not induce any MAMP responsiveness in differentiated outer cell layers. This suggests that perception of neighbor cell damage is more complex than a simple presence of DAMPs, relying on additional cues, possibly ion and osmolyte release or mechanical stress, caused by cellular disintegration.
We found that expressing the MAMP receptor FLS2 under a constitutive UBIQUITIN 10 promoter ( pUBQ10 ) was sufficient to install responsiveness to flg22 in differentiated outer root cell layers ( Figure 4 A). This indicates that FLS2 itself is the only component restricting the ability of differentiated root cells to respond to flg22, implying that all other necessary downstream components (such as BRI1-associated kinase [BAK1], Botrytis-induced kinase [BIK1], MAPKs, WRKYs, etc.) are present. This fits with earlier observations of MAMP receptor mis-expression in other organs or species ( Lacombe et al., 2010; Wyrsch et al., 2015 39. Lacombe, S. ∙ Rougon-Cardoso, A. ∙ Sherwood, E. ... Interfamily transfer of a plant pattern-recognition receptor confers broad-spectrum bacterial resistance Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28 :365-369 Crossref Scopus (405) PubMed Google Scholar 71. Wyrsch, I. ∙ Domínguez-Ferreras, A. ∙ Geldner, N. ... Tissue-specific FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) expression in roots restores immune responses in Arabidopsis fls2 mutants New Phytol. 2015; 206 :774-784 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consequently, we wanted to also monitor FLS2 expression at single-cell resolution after damage. The currently used FLS2 promoter complements fls2 ( Zipfel et al., 2004 76. Zipfel, C. ∙ Robatzek, S. ∙ Navarro, L. ... Bacterial disease resistance in Arabidopsis through flagellin perception Nature. 2004; 428 :764-767 Crossref Scopus (1326) PubMed Google Scholar ) and roughly matches the spatial patterns of MAMP responses (our work and [ Beck et al., [2014 6. Beck, M. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Strutt, J. ... Expression patterns of flagellin sensing 2 map to bacterial entry sites in plant shoots and roots J. Exp. Bot. 2014; 65 :6487-6498 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ]). However, the promoter is of small size (less than 1,000 bp), shows important line-to-line variability and in some cases does not match with MAMP responses ( Beck et al., 2014 6. Beck, M. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Strutt, J. ... Expression patterns of flagellin sensing 2 map to bacterial entry sites in plant shoots and roots J. Exp. Bot. 2014; 65 :6487-6498 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore additionally generated a longer promoter line ( pFLS2 long ) ( Figure S4 A), which showed less variability and an average pattern that is largely consistent with the described flg22-induced MAMP responses ( Figure S4 D), i.e., responses adjacent to emerging lateral roots or enhancement of responses to ethylene ( Figures S4 E and S4F). FLS2 expression from this longer promoter fragment also complemented the absence of flg22 responses in fls2 background ( Figures S4 B and S4C).
In contrast to the MAMP response markers, we found that FLS2 is transcriptionally activated upon wounding alone, both in differentiation and elongation zone of the root ( Figures 4 B–4D, 4F, and 4G), readily explaining how cells can become responsive upon wounding. Indeed, the timing and spatial extent of FLS2 upregulation matched the observed pattern of MAMP responsiveness (compare Figures 4 B–4D and 4F with Figures 2 A–2D and S3 , respectively). We confirmed that, although less easily quantifiable, a local upregulation of FLS2 protein could also be observed using pFLS2::FLS2-GFP reporter line ( Figure 4 E). To fully correlate local FLS2 activation upon damage with MAMP responsiveness, we generated double marker lines of pFLS2::NLS-tdTomato and mVENUS MAMP reporters and found that the near-totality of neighboring MAMP responsive cells were also positive for FLS2 expression when treated with flg22 upon ablation ( Figures 4 H, 4I, S4 G, and S4H). Previously, pFLS2::GUS reporter lines showed signal in regions around large-scale wound sites, but relevance for MAMP signaling was not established at the time ( Beck et al., 2014 6. Beck, M. ∙ Wyrsch, I. ∙ Strutt, J. ... Expression patterns of flagellin sensing 2 map to bacterial entry sites in plant shoots and roots J. Exp. Bot. 2014; 65 :6487-6498 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our co-visualization of receptor expression and MAMP responses now additionally reveals that transcriptional MAMP responses can be strictly cell autonomous, allowing for a very fine-grained activation of immunity. This degree of spatial specificity is surprising, considering that flg22 stimulation was shown to induce ROS production, depolarization, and even propagating calcium waves, all of which have the potential to induce non-cell autonomous responses ( Jeworutzki et al., 2010; Keinath et al., 2015 33. Jeworutzki, E. ∙ Roelfsema, M.R.G. ∙ Anschütz, U. ... Early signaling through the Arabidopsis pattern recognition receptors FLS2 and EFR involves Ca-associated opening of plasma membrane anion channels Plant J. 2010; 62 :367-378 Crossref Scopus (190) PubMed Google Scholar 35.

Plant. 2015; 8 :1188-1200 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ).
FLS2 expression is also known to strongly depend on ethylene ( Boutrot et al., 2010; Mersmann et al., 2010 10. Boutrot, F. ∙ Segonzac, C. ∙ Chang, K.N. ... Direct transcriptional control of the Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 by the ethylene-dependent transcription factors EIN3 and EIL1 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107 :14502-14507 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar 46. Mersmann, S. ∙ Bourdais, G. ∙ Rietz, S. ... Ethylene signaling regulates accumulation of the FLS2 receptor and is required for the oxidative burst contributing to plant immunity Plant Physiol. 2010; 154 :391-400 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ) and recent work from our group demonstrated that single cell ablation causes regional induction of ethylene production ( Marhavý et al., 2019 45. Marhavý, P. ∙ Kurenda, A. ∙ Siddique, S. ... Single-cell damage elicits regional, nematode-restricting ethylene responses in roots EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e100972 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the spatial patterns of ethylene production reporters upon ablation (extending over many cellular distances, mainly in the stele, no induction of immediate neighbors) did not match the observed FLS2 induction pattern ( Marhavý et al., 2019 45. Marhavý, P. ∙ Kurenda, A. ∙ Siddique, S. ... Single-cell damage elicits regional, nematode-restricting ethylene responses in roots EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e100972 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ), we nonetheless tested whether FLS2 upregulation after damage depended on ethylene.
By combining FLS2 reporter and MAMP markers in strong ethylene-insensitive mutants, ein2-1 and etr1-1 , we could observe a very strong dependency of MAMP responses on ethylene signaling in the elongation zone ( Figures S5 A and S5B), consistent with a previous study ( Millet et al., 2010 47. Millet, Y.A. ∙ Danna, C.H. ∙ Clay, N.K. ... Innate immune responses activated in Arabidopsis roots by microbe-associated molecular patterns Plant Cell. 2010; 22 :973-990 Crossref Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, both sporadic and laser-induced cell damage were still able to induce MAMP responsiveness, independently of ethylene signaling ( Figures S5 A and S5B). This also applies to lateral root emergence, where cortical cells showed upregulation of FLS2 expression independently of ethylene signaling ( Figure S5 C). Treating wild-type MAMP marker lines with ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor corroborated these results ( Figure S5 D). Consequently, induction of FLS2 expression itself upon damage was also found to be fully independent on ethylene signaling, although the basal expression levels in the untreated controls were strongly reduced ( Figures S5 E and S5F). These findings now provide a rationale for earlier observations noting that impaired flg22 signaling in ethylene mutants is not observed in assays involving dissected (wounded) tissues ( Mersmann et al., 2010 46. Mersmann, S. ∙ Bourdais, G. ∙ Rietz, S. ... Ethylene signaling regulates accumulation of the FLS2 receptor and is required for the oxidative burst contributing to plant immunity Plant Physiol. 2010; 154 :391-400 Crossref Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we establish an abiotic stress input into immune signaling that appears to work fully independently of the important stress hormone ethylene.
In light of the comparatively high expression of FLS2 in the stele of differentiated roots, we tested whether a mutant defective in Casparian strips, the extracellular diffusion barrier in roots ( Geldner, 2013 21. Geldner, N. The endodermis Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2013; 64 :531-558 Crossref Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ), would display flg22 responsiveness, because of penetration of flg22 into the stele. Indeed, fluorescently labeled flg22 is blocked by the Casparian strip and penetrates into the stele in the barrier mutant ( schengen3-3 [ sgn3-3 ]) ( Figure S1 F). Yet, to our surprise, no flg22 response was observed in the stele of a sgn3 mutant with endogenous FLS2 expression ( Figure 5 A). However, when a constitutively expressing pUBQ10::FLS2 line was used, a strong flg22 response could be observed in the stele of the endodermal barrier mutant, but not of wild-type ( Figures 5 B and 5C). This result illustrates the ability of the Casparian strip to compartmentalize perception of immune peptides within the root. Interestingly, however, the wild-type, steady-state levels of FLS2 expression that we observe in the stele are apparently insufficient to cause MAMP-responsiveness, while enhanced receptor expression from the UBQ10 promoter is sufficient to install responsiveness. This suggests a thresholded relationship between FLS2 expression and flg22-dependent transcriptional output.
While the Casparian strip functions to block extracellular diffusion of substances (e.g., microbial patterns) into the stele, a second cell wall modification—endodermal suberin lamellae—eventually surrounds the entire endodermis and is thought to inhibit uptake of molecules into the endodermis, because the hydrophobic suberin layer does not allow molecules from the cell wall to reach the endodermal plasma membrane ( Figures 5 C and 5D) ( Barberon et al., 2016 5. Barberon, M. ∙ Vermeer, J.E.M. ∙ De Bellis, D. ... Adaptation of Root Function by Nutrient-Induced Plasticity of Endodermal Differentiation Cell. 2016; 164 :447-459 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (372) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore wanted to see whether suberization interferes with the ability of endodermal cells to perceive flg22. Indeed, we found that early differentiated endodermis (25 cells after onset of elongation, non-suberized ) still respond to flg22 in a pUBQ10::FLS2 line, while they are unresponsive in older endodermal cells (55 cells after onset of elongation, suberized ) ( Figures 5 C and 5E). We confirmed absence and presence of suberin at 25 and 55 cells, respectively, using a previously established suberization marker, pGPAT5::mCITRINE-SYP122 ( Barberon et al., 2016; Naseer et al., 2012 5.

By inducing precocious and enhanced suberization by two different mechanisms, using either the enhanced suberin 1 (esb1 ) mutant or treatment with abscisic acid (ABA) ( Barberon et al., 2016; Hosmani et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2019 5.

Surveillance of cell wall diffusion barrier integrity modulates water and solute transport in plants Sci. Rep. 2019; 9 :4227 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), flg22 responsiveness was suppressed in early endodermis (25 cells) ( Figures 5 C and 5E), demonstrating that protective suberization of a cell is incompatible with continued perception of microbial patterns ( Figure 5 D). This suppression of endodermal responses by suberization could not only be observed in the constitutive FLS2 -expressing line, but also with endogenously expressed FLS2 , after ablation of epidermis and cortex. In this case again, we found that endodermal flg22 responses, observed in early differentiated cells, were abrogated in esb1 ( Figures 5 F, S6 B, and S6C) or upon ABA treatment ( Figures S6 D and S6E). We ascertained that ABA does not cause a general suppression of MAMP responses, because responses in the root elongation zone are maintained upon ABA treatment ( Figure S6 F).
We then broadened our observations based on FLS2 to other MAMP receptors by establishing transcriptional reporter lines for three additional PRR s, the EF-TU RECEPTOR ( EFR ) ( Zipfel et al., 2006 77. Zipfel, C. ∙ Kunze, G. ∙ Chinchilla, D. ... Perception of the bacterial PAMP EF-Tu by the receptor EFR restricts Agrobacterium -mediated transformation Cell. 2006; 125 :749-760 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1437) PubMed Google Scholar ), the CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 ( CERK1 ) ( Miya et al., 2007 48. Miya, A. ∙ Albert, P. ∙ Shinya, T. ... CERK1, a LysM receptor kinase, is essential for chitin elicitor signaling in Arabidopsis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :19613-19618 Crossref Scopus (1053) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as the nlp20 receptor RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN 23 (RLP23 ) ( Albert et al., 2015 1. Albert, I. ∙ Böhm, H. ∙ Albert, M. ... An RLP23-SOBIR1-BAK1 complex mediates NLP-triggered immunity Nat. Plants. 2015; 1 :15140 Crossref Scopus (309) PubMed Google Scholar ). In all three cases, a very similar, localized upregulation of receptor expression upon laser-induced cell damage was observed ( Figures 6 A and 6B), suggesting that cell damage leads to a rather generalized upregulation of response capacity to MAMPs.
We then used an independent MAMP, 3-OH-C10:0, the newly described ligand for the LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION ( LORE ) receptor kinase ( Ranf et al., 2015 56. Ranf, S. ∙ Gisch, N. ∙ Schäffer, M. ... A lectin S-domain receptor kinase mediates lipopolysaccharide sensing in Arabidopsis thaliana Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 :426-433 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to the other PRRs , LORE expression is strongly induced upon damage in the early differentiated cells ( Figures 6 C and 6E). 3-OH-C10:0 elicits direct MAMP responses in the elongation zone, but not in the differentiation zone, similar to flg22 ( Figure 6 D). More importantly, upon damage, a strong enhancement of responses to 3-OH-C10:0 was observed in the early differentiation zone ( Figures 6 D and 6F), showing that the observed damage-gating of MAMP responses is not restricted to flg22-FLS2 module, but is also observed for a non-peptidic, conserved bacterial pattern, perceived by a non-LRR type receptor.
Finally, we tested whether our observations are relevant in the context of actual, bacterial root colonization. For this, we first used the model commensal/beneficial Pseudomonas protegens strain CHA0 (CHA0) ( Haas and Défago, 2005; Haas and Keel, 2003 27. Haas, D. ∙ Défago, G. Biological control of soil-borne pathogens by fluorescent pseudomonads Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3 :307-319 Crossref Scopus (1919) PubMed Google Scholar 28. Haas, D. ∙ Keel, C. Regulation of antibiotic production in root-colonizing Peudomonas spp. and relevance for biological control of plant disease Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2003; 41 :117-153 Crossref Scopus (655) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, despite strong colonization of seedling roots on plates and floating hydroponic roots, no significant MAMP response could be observed in undamaged, differentiated roots ( Figures 7 A and S7 A–S7C). However, when cell ablation was combined with colonization, the cells neighboring the damage site were showing a MAMP response to the presence of the bacteria ( Figures 7 B and 7C). As with flg22 treatments, MAMP responses to the bacteria were also observed around lateral root emergence sites and upon spontaneous damage ( Figure 7 A). Next, we tested a root pathogenic bacterium, Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 (GMI1000) ( Genin and Boucher, 2004 22. Genin, S. ∙ Boucher, C. Lessons learned from the genome analysis of ralstonia solanacearum Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42 :107-134 Crossref Scopus (141) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, GMI1000 colonization initially does not cause cell damage, nor a strong MAMP response ( Figure 7 D). However, progression of infection eventually leads to cell death of some epidermal cells, which is then associated with a localized upregulation of MAMP responses in neighboring cells ( Figures 7 D and S7 A–S7C). Our bacterial colonization experiments demonstrate that cellular damage and lateral root emergence does not only unlock MAMP responsiveness to high doses of pure MAMPs such as flg22, or 3-OH-C10:0, but is also effective in unlocking responses to the more complex and probably much less concentrated cocktail of MAMPs associated with actual bacterial colonization. Interestingly, flg22 derived from GMI1000 flagellin was found not to activate the Arabidopsis FLS2 receptor ( Pfund et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2018 54. Pfund, C. ∙ Tans-Kersten, J. ∙ Dunning, F.M. ... Flagellin is not a major defense elicitor in Ralstonia solanacearum cells or extracts applied to Arabidopsis thaliana Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17 :696-706 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar 70. Wei, Y. ∙ Caceres-Moreno, C. ∙ Jimenez-Gongora, T. ... The Ralstonia solanacearum csp22 peptide, but not flagellin-derived peptides, is perceived by plants from the Solanaceae family Plant Biotechnol. J. 2018; 16 :1349-1362 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ). This indicates that the damage-associated MAMP responses we observe upon GMI1000 infection must be caused by MAMPs other than flg22. In addition, the similar, local upregulation of MAMP responsiveness seen upon GMI1000-induced damage further suggests that the phenomenon we describe here is not specific to laser-ablation induced cell damage (already indicated by our observations that MAMP responsiveness also occurs adjacent to sites of spontaneous cell death).
Intriguingly, our constitutively expressing pUBQ10::FLS2 line, showed direct MAMP responses to CHA0, in the absence of damage ( Figure 7 A). Such a constitutive, non-damage-gated defense activation should interfere with root colonization of a commensal bacterium such as CHA0 and might be quantifiable, in contrast to a local interference with microbial colonization upon laser-induced damage, which would be impossible for us to quantify. We indeed found a slight, but consistently lower degree of root colonization in plate assays in pUBQ10::FLS2 lines, both by qPCR-based quantification and colony forming units (CFU) counting ( Figures 7 E and S7 D–S7G). Thus, a restricted, damage-gated MAMP responsiveness of roots contributes to allow for root colonization by innocuous or beneficial bacterial species.

Section: Discussion

Plant roots generate an attractive environment for a subset of soil-borne microbes. These microbes, in turn, affect roots by manipulating plant hormones, signaling, nutrient acquisition, or growth of other microbes, using large sets of genes associated with their root-colonizing life-style ( Levy et al., 2017 41. Levy, A. ∙ Salas Gonzalez, I. ∙ Mittelviefhaus, M. ... Genomic features of bacterial adaptation to plants Nat. Genet. 2017; 50 :138-150 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ). One important function that promotes colonization is thought to be the ability of some bacteria to suppress MAMP responses, thus avoiding production of anti-microbial compounds and inhibition of root growth. Suppression of MAMP perception by non-pathogenic colonizers has been reported, but is just starting to be understood in mechanistic terms ( Garrido-Oter et al., 2018; Pel and Pieterse, 2013; Yu et al., 2019 20. Garrido-Oter, R. ∙ Nakano, R.T. ∙ Dombrowski, N. ..., AgBiome Team Modular Traits of the Rhizobiales Root Microbiota and Their Evolutionary Relationship with Symbiotic Rhizobia Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :155-167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Pel, M.J.C. ∙ Pieterse, C.M.J. Microbial recognition and evasion of host immunity J. Exp. Bot. 2013; 64 :1237-1248 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar 73. Yu, K. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Tichelaar, R. ...

Biol. 2019; 29 :3913-3920 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ). Type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors are known to suppress MAMP perception ( Chisholm et al., 2006 14. Chisholm, S.T. ∙ Coaker, G. ∙ Day, B. ... Host-microbe interactions: shaping the evolution of the plant immune response Cell. 2006; 124 :803-814 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2267) PubMed Google Scholar ), yet appear to be associated with a pathogenic (or symbiotic) life-style, with commensal/beneficial bacteria either not possessing a T3SS or containing only few recognizable T3SS proteins whose functions remain enigmatic ( Loper et al., 2012; Stringlis et al., 2019 42. Loper, J.E. ∙ Hassan, K.A. ∙ Mavrodi, D.V. ... Comparative genomics of plant-associated Pseudomonas spp.: insights into diversity and inheritance of traits involved in multitrophic interactions PLoS Genet. 2012; 8 :e1002784 Crossref Scopus (483) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Stringlis, I.A. ∙ Zamioudis, C. ∙ Berendsen, R.L. ... Type III Secretion System of Beneficial Rhizobacteria Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 and Pseudomonas defensor WCS374 Front. Microbiol. 2019; 10 :1631 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our findings now provide an additional level of explanation of how non-pathogenic microbes can successfully colonize roots—by simply avoiding damage and the strong enhancement of immune responses that comes with it ( Figure 7 F). From the plant-side, such a damage-gating of immune responses is economical, as it avoids constitutive activation of defenses and localizes them to sites where aggressive microbial colonizers might induce cellular damage or where damage due to other causes has generated potential pathogen entry points. For innocuous, root-colonizing bacteria, such a system would alleviate the need to repress plant immunity, as long as colonization proceeds without damage. It will be intriguing to see whether the suppression of MAMP responses by non-pathogenic bacteria still allows for damage-induced enhancement of MAMP responsiveness, in contrast to suppression by type III effectors, which can directly interfere with signaling components downstream of MAMP receptors and can thus be expected to suppress MAMP perception in absence or presence of damage.
An initial pathogenic infection in soil is bound to be localized, involving one or a few cells. Manipulations and molecular readouts at single-cell resolution are therefore of crucial importance for a mechanistic understanding of root-microbe interactions. Recently, we reported that single-cell damage causes surface depolarization, actively propagating calcium signals, ROS, and ethylene production in a surprisingly large region around the single-cell wound ( Marhavý et al., 2019 45. Marhavý, P. ∙ Kurenda, A. ∙ Siddique, S. ... Single-cell damage elicits regional, nematode-restricting ethylene responses in roots EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e100972 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we demonstrate that ablation of clusters of a few cells causes an ethylene-independent, much more restricted, upregulation of MAMP responsiveness, difficult, or impossible to observe by standard molecular readouts or standard methods of wounding. Recently, damage of root cap tissue in meristems was shown to lead to jasmonate receptor-dependent regeneration responses ( Zhou et al., 2019 75. Zhou, W. ∙ Lozano-Torres, J.L. ∙ Blilou, I. ... A Jasmonate Signaling Network Activates Root Stem Cells and Promotes Regeneration Cell. 2019; 177 :942-956 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although we have focused on the differentiated and transition/elongation zone of the root—in which we do not observe regeneration responses—it would be intriguing to investigate whether and how the damage-gating of immune responses described here can be integrated with tissue regeneration. A recent report proposes that loss of cellular integrity causes calcium increases, activating AtPEP1 processing and release into the apoplast, where it could report damage to neighboring cells ( Hander et al., 2019 29. Hander, T. ∙ Fernández-Fernández, Á.D. ∙ Kumpf, R.P. ... Damage on plants activates Ca2+-dependent metacaspases for release of immunomodulatory peptides Science. 2019; 363 :eaar7486 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ). Yet, the damage-induced gain of MAMP responsiveness that we observe here is not reconstituted by co-treatment with AtPEP1 or other DAMPs. We therefore propose that local, non-propagating signals are additionally required for a damage response, such as mechanical stresses on neighboring cell walls or plasmodesmatal collapse, induced by loss of turgor and cellular disintegration in the neighbor. Our data suggest that DAMP release might be a necessary element of damage perception, but is, on its own, insufficient to reconstitute actual cellular damage. In the future, it will be fascinating to use single-cell damage to investigate the immediate molecular events and mechanism that translate loss of cellular integrity into immune responsiveness of adjacent cells.

For all experiments, plant seeds were surface-sterilized in 70% EtOH for 10 min, then washed twice in 99% ethanol and dried in sterile conditions. Seeds were stratified at 4°C in the dark on 0.8% half Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar plates without addition of sucrose. Plant roots were grown vertically for 6 d at 22°C under continuous days.
The GFP-tagged Pseudomonas protegen s strain, CHA0- gfp2 (CHA0::attTn 7 - gfp2 ; Gm r ) and the GFP-labeled Ralstonia solanacearum strain, GMI1000- gfp2 (GMI1000::attTn 7 - gfp2 ; Gm r ) were provided by Prof. Christoph Keel ( Péchy-Tarr et al., 2013 51.

Bacterial strains were incubated overnight in liquid LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract and 1% NaCl, for CHA0- gfp2 ) or BG medium (1% peptone, 0.1% Casamino acid, 0.1% yeast extract and 0.5% glucose, for GMI1000- gfp2 ) supplemented with 30 μl/ml gentamycin at 28°C. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in sterile MiliQ water for further root inoculation assays.
For generating expression constructs, the In-Fusion Advantage PCR Cloning Kit (Clontech), Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen) and GreenGate Cloning System ( Lampropoulos et al., 2013 40. Lampropoulos, A. ∙ Sutikovic, Z. ∙ Wenzl, C. ... GreenGate---a novel, versatile, and efficient cloning system for plant transgenesis PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 :e83043 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ) were used. See Table S1 for primer details. All plasmids were transformed by heat shock into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 strain with or without pSoup plasmid and then transformed into the corresponding plant lines by floral dipping method ( Clough and Bent, 1998; Zhang et al., 2006 16.

Protoc. 2006; 1 :641-646 Crossref Scopus (1557) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several independent transgenic lines were analyzed, and the strongest line of each construct was selected for further studies.
For labeling of the plasma membrane, pUBQ10::RCI2A-tdTomato construct was generated using a triple Gateway reaction recombining the following plasmids: pDONR P4-P1R- pUBQ10 , pDONR 221- RCI2A (containing the coding sequence of the small plasma membrane localized protein RARE-COLD-INDUCIBLE 2A (AtRCI2A)), pDONR P2R-P3- tdTomato and pK7m34GW (destination vector containing the kanamycin resistance gene for in planta selection). The resulting plasmid was transformed into Col-0 plants. Transcriptional reporters were created using the following promoters: pFRK1 ( Asai et al., 2002 3. Asai, T. ∙ Tena, G. ∙ Plotnikova, J. ... MAP kinase signalling cascade in Arabidopsis innate immunity Nature. 2002; 415 :977-983 Crossref Scopus (2174) PubMed Google Scholar ), pFLS2 ( Zipfel et al., 2004 76.

Immunol. 2015; 16 :426-433 Crossref Scopus (248) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned into HindШ site of pGreenHygromycin-NLS-3xmVENUS ( Vermeer et al., 2014 67. Vermeer, J.E.M. ∙ von Wangenheim, D. ∙ Barberon, M. ... A spatial accommodation by neighboring cells is required for organ initiation in Arabidopsis Science. 2014; 343 :178-183 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). The resulting constructs were introduced into Col-0 or pUBQ10::RCI2A-tdTomato background.
To overexpress FLS2 gene in MAMP marker lines, the pUBQ10::FLS2 plasmid was constructed using double Gateway cloning. The full-length genomic FLS2 DNA, including the FLS2 coding region, 227 bp of upstream sequence, and 953 bp downstream sequence was cloned into the entry clone pDONR 221. This vector was then combined to the entry clone pDONR P4-P1R- pUBQ10 and the destination vector pK7m24GW to create the final expression clone pUBQ10::FLS2 . The resulting construct was transformed into stable MAMP marker lines, which were then introduced into the sgn3-3 mutant background by genetic crossing. For generating FLS2 complementation line, the pFLS2 long ::FLS2-3xMYC-mVENUS plasmid was constructed by double Gateway cloning. Full-length genomic FLS2 fragment fused with triple MYC tag followed by a mVENUS sequence was cloned into pDONR 221. This vector was then combined with an entry clone pDONR P4-P1R- pFLS2 long and the destination vector pFR7m24GW (destination vector containing the FastRed cassette for transgenic seed selection) ( Shimada et al., 2010 61. Shimada, T.L. ∙ Shimada, T. ∙ Hara-Nishimura, I. A rapid and non-destructive screenable marker, FAST, for identifying transformed seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 2010; 61 :519-528 Crossref Scopus (255) PubMed Google Scholar ) to create the final expression clone, which was transformed into fls2 mutant background.
To combine FLS2 and MAMP-reporters in the same background, pFLS2::NLS-tdTomato plasmid was constructed using Greengate Cloning System. pFLS2 short promoter was PCR-amplified and cloned into pGGA (plasmid Green Gate A) entry vector to generate pGGA- pFLS2 , which was then recombined using Greengate reaction with the following plasmids: pGGB- SV40-NLS , pGGC -tdTomato , pGGD -dummy , pGGE -UBQ10terminator , pGGF -FastRed and pGGZ -empty destination vector. The final construct possesses the FastRed cassette for transgenic plant selection. The obtained construct was transformed into a stable MAMP marker background.

Yamaguchi, Y. ∙ Pearce, G. ∙ Ryan, C.A. The cell surface leucine-rich repeat receptor for AtPep1, an endogenous peptide elicitor in Arabidopsis, is functional in transgenic tobacco cells Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103 :10104-10109 Crossref Scopus (325) PubMed Google Scholar ) were chemically synthesized by Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH ( https://www.peptid.de/ ). The peptides were dissolved in deionized water to obtain 1 mM stock solution and further dilutions were done with half MS medium. Fluorescently-labeled peptides TAMRA-flg22 Pa and TAMRA-AtPEP1 were synthesized by Peptron ( http://www.peptron.com/ ) and dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1 μM for all assays. Extracellular ATP (eATP), D-(+)-cellobiose (cellobiose), (±)-3-Hydroxydecanoic acid (3-OH-C10:0) and chitin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Galacturonan oligosaccharide mixture DP10-DP15 (OGs) was purchased from Elicityl ( https://www.elicityl-oligotech.com/ ). These chemicals were dissolved in water to the stock concentrations of 100 mM for eATP, 1 mM for 3-OH-C10:0 and cellobiose, 2 mg/ml for chitin and 5 mg/ml for OGs. For hormone treatments, (±)-Abscisic acid (ABA) was stored as a 50 mM stock solution in methanol and 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) as a 20 mM stock solution in water. For ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor treatment, Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) was dissolved in water as a 10 mM stock solution.
For microscopic analysis of pFLS2 reporter and MAMP marker lines under various treatments, six-day-old seedlings were carefully transferred into liquid half MS medium containing the mentioned chemical molecules using 12-well culture plates (CytoOne™). The seedlings were observed under confocal microscopy after 6h treatment, unless otherwise specified, in standard growth condition. A pool of 10-12 homozygous seedlings from the T3 generation was analyzed for each assay. At least three independent replicates were performed.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM880 inverted confocal scanning microscope. Pictures were taken with a 40 × water immersion objectives. For more detailed analyses in large area of interest, imaging was performed thanks to Z-scan with tile-scan (overlap 10%). For green and red fluorophores, the following excitation and detection windows were used: mVENUS/GFP 488 nm, 500-530 nm; mCITRINE 496 nm, 530 nm; PI 520 nm, 590 nm; tdTomato 550 nm, 580 nm; TAMRA 560 nm, 570-610 nm. Sequential scanning was used to avoid interference between fluorescence channels. Confocal images after treatments and/or ablations were taken following the “four identical criteria,” that is, using the same position in the roots, the same laser detection intensity, the same laser scanning area, and the same interval and number of slices for Z stack projection.
The sample preparation and manipulation for laser ablation was done as described before ( Marhavý et al., 2019 45. Marhavý, P. ∙ Kurenda, A. ∙ Siddique, S. ... Single-cell damage elicits regional, nematode-restricting ethylene responses in roots EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e100972 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, six-day-old seedlings were carefully transferred from half MS medium plate into a Chambered Coverglass (Nunc Lab-Tek, 2-well format, Thermo Scientific). In each well 4-5 roots lied alongside the cover glass, and then the entire root parts were covered with a block of solid half MS medium (approximately equal to 1 mL in liquid volume). Finally, chambers were covered with lid and mounted onto the confocal microscopy for time-lapse imaging and cell-type-specific laser ablation. Cell ablation experiments were performed on a Zeiss LSM880 Confocal/Multiphoton (Mai-Tai Spectra-Physics Multiphoton laser). Parameters for ablation were set as below: 40 × water immersion objective, scaling dimensions (xyz), laser 800 nm −2%, beam splitter MBS_InVis: MBS 760+, pixel dwell: 0.8 μs. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn through the cell prior to ablation.
To combine laser ablation-caused cell damage with flg22 treatment in Chambered Coverglass system, we first ablated specific root cells and then immediately added 500 μL of 3 μM flg22 solution into the chamber to obtain a final concentration of 1 μM flg22. After 6h treatment, the liquid solution was removed carefully to avoid roots movement, and then confocal images were taken directly for reporter lines expressing the plasma membrane marker. For the lines devoid of plasma membrane marker, plasma membrane outline and damaged cells can be labeled clearly by adding 50 μL of PI solution (5x) onto the agar block of half MS medium for 10 min before observation.
To obtain the GFP-labeled Ralstonia solanacearum GMI1000 strain, GMI1000- gfp2 (GMI1000::attTn 7 - gfp2 ; Gm r ), we introduced a GFP fluorescent tag into the bacterial genome by electroporation transformation method as described before ( Smith and Iglewski, 1989 62. Smith, A.W. ∙ Iglewski, B.H. Transformation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by electroporation Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17 :10509 Crossref Scopus (236) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, GMI1000 was grown in BG broth (1% Bacto peptone, 0.1% casamino acids, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% glucose) with vigorous shaking at 28°C until early log phase (OD 600 = 0.4-0.6). 1.5 mL of pre-culture cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 2 min at 4°C, pellet was resuspended with the same volume MOPS-Glycerol (MOPS 1 mM with 15% Glycerol, keep on ice), re-centrifuged, washed in 1/3 volume of wash medium (MOPS-Glycerol) and finally re-suspended in 1/15 volume (75 μl) of MOPS-Glycerol. The cell suspension was chilled on ice for 30 min prior to electroporation. 5 μL of delivery vector, pBK-miniTn7- gfp2 ( Koch et al., 2001 36. Koch, B. ∙ Jensen, L.E. ∙ Nybroe, O. A panel of Tn7-based vectors for insertion of the gfp marker gene or for delivery of cloned DNA into Gram-negative bacteria at a neutral chromosomal site J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 45 :187-195 Crossref Scopus (220) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 5 μL of a helper plasmid DNA pUXBF13 ( Bao et al., 1991 4. Bao, Y. ∙ Lies, D.P. ∙ Fu, H. ... An improved Tn7-based system for the single-copy insertion of cloned genes into chromosomes of gram-negative bacteria Gene. 1991; 109 :167-168 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ), were gently mixed with cell suspension and then transferred to pre-chilled 0.2 cm cuvettes (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was performed using the following settings: capacitance, 25 μF; voltage, 2.4 kV; resistance, 200 Ω; pulse length, < 5 msec. 1 mL of SOC medium was then immediately added and the mix incubated with shaking for 1 h at 28°C. Finally, the mixture was plated on BG solid medium supplemented with 30 μl/ml gentamycin and incubated at 28°C until colonies have grown.
For bacterial infection on the roots, two different infection assays were used for both bacteria: drop dipping infection on solid MS plate and floating hydroponic inoculation. For drop dipping infection, we followed the method as described previously ( Digonnet et al., 2012 17. Digonnet, C. ∙ Martinez, Y. ∙ Denancé, N. ... Deciphering the route of Ralstonia solanacearum colonization in Arabidopsis thaliana roots during a compatible interaction: focus at the plant cell wall Planta. 2012; 236 :1419-1431 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. In short, six-day-old seedlings were selected for uniform growth and transferred to half MS agar plates carefully. After incubation overnight in LB (for CHA0) or BG (for GMI1000) medium, bacteria were collected, washed and resuspended in distil water. 10 μL of bacterial suspension at an optical density of OD 600 = 0.1 (10 8 cfu/ml) was applied to the seedling by depositing small droplets along the whole root. Infected plates were then grown vertically for one to three days before microscopic observation according to the experiments. For floating hydroponic infection, four seeds were evenly spread on a small patch of sterile mesh (2 cm x 2 cm), which was then deposited onto a half MS agar plate for germination. After 3 days, when roots grew across the holes of mesh, we transferred the seedlings-supporting mesh onto a 12-well cell culture plates, containing 7 mL of hydroponic solution by well (the seedlings-supporting mesh floating on the solution). Grown for another 4 days, the bacterial suspension was then added in the hydroponic solution of each well to a final OD 600 of 0.1. Roots were infected by bacteria for 6 h to 12 h before observation under confocal microscope.
For combining CHA0 infection with laser ablation, we used the Chambered Coverglass system similarly to flg22 treatment. Briefly, after ablation, 500 μL of bacterial suspension at an optical density of OD 600 = 0.1 was gently added into the chamber to avoid roots movement. After 6 h infection, the bacterial solution was removed carefully, and confocal images were taken on Zeiss LSM 880.
For qPCR analysis of bacterial colonization, the experiment was performed as described previously ( Garrido-Oter et al., 2018 20. Garrido-Oter, R. ∙ Nakano, R.T. ∙ Dombrowski, N. ..., AgBiome Team Modular Traits of the Rhizobiales Root Microbiota and Their Evolutionary Relationship with Symbiotic Rhizobia Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24 :155-167 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (221) PubMed Google Scholar ) with minor modification. In brief, four-day-old seedlings were carefully transferred to solid half MS plate containing CHA0 at final density of OD 600 = 0.002. After inoculation at the indicated time point, three roots for each sample were collected from plates and briefly washed once in sterile water for 5 s to remove non-attached bacterial cells. After removal of excess water with a filter paper (Whatman, UK), roots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further processing. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction mixture containing 10 μL MESA BLUE qPCR 2X MasterMix Plus for SYBR® Assay (Eurogentec, Belgium), 30 ng DNA template, 0.5 μM forward primer and 0.5 μM reverse primer. PCR was performed by a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using the following cycles: 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. Data from three biological replicates were analyzed following the delta-Ct method, which was used to estimate the relative abundance of bacteria to the abundance of plant DNA. Primers sequence used for qPCR are: 499_500 for CHA0 16S gene and plant housekeeping gene AtACTIN2 for normalization.
For calculate the number of CHA0 colonization, the experiment was conducted by CFU counting ( Saad et al., 2018 59. Saad, M. ∙ de Zelicourt, A. ∙ Rolli, E. ... Quantification of Root Colonizing Bacteria Bio Protoc. 2018; 8 Crossref Google Scholar ). Briefly, four-day-old seedlings were transferred to new half MS agar plates containing CHA0 (OD 600 = 0.002). Parts of their roots grown for indicated colonization time point were cut, gently washed by dipping in distilled water, and then ground in Eppendorf tubes using TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Germany) with stainless steel beads. Each sample was resuspended in 500 μL of extraction buffer (10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.01% Silwet L-77) to homogenize the plant material. Samples were diluted 4,000-fold, and then spread on LB agar plates supplemented with 30 μl/ml gentamycin. The CFU were counted after 36h incubation at 28°C until colonies are clearly visible. Calculated number of CFU was normalized per centimeter of root length (total root length was determined based on images of root systems before their harvest). The experiment was conducted in three biological replicates, each with three technical replicates per condition; each sample consisted of three roots.
For quantifying the nuclear-localized fluorescence intensity of MAMP markers and FLS2 reporter, confocal images were analyzed with the Fiji package ( http://fiji.sc/Fiji ). Contrast and brightness were adjusted in the same manner for all images. In short, first, we set a defined threshold value for the same experiment between control and treatments. For example, all signals below a gray value threshold of 30 were excluded from quantification to avoid autofluorescence signal and weak non-MAMP responsive signal. Note that this threshold value is not fixed between different reporters and can be adjusted according to their fluorescent intensity. Second, after setting the detectable size of pixel to avoid noise signal, the size of the total area with signal (number of pixels) can be determined, which, multiplied by the average intensity of the pixels for each area, give the total fluorescence intensity for each nucleus, called “RawIntDen” - raw intensity density (RID). Finally, the overall score of an image is the sum of the RID values of all particles (nuclei).
Counting of the numbers of MAMP-responsive and/or PRR -positive cells in different root cell types was obtained as follows: a threshold value was set for removing noise signals. In some cases, for reporter lines or specific cell layers showing weak MAMP-responsive and/or PRR -positive fluorescence, we elevated the threshold value to separate the basal level of fluorescence and the weak non-MAMP responsive signals from the strongly induced MAMP-responsive signals. All signals below a given gray value threshold were excluded from the cell nuclei counting. The score average was obtained from 10-12 images of replicate roots.
All statistical analyses were done with the Graphpad Prism 7.0 software ( https://www.graphpad.com/ ). One-way ANOVA was performed, and Tukey's test was subsequently used as a multiple comparison procedure. Details about the statistical approaches used can be found in the figure legends. The data are presented as mean ± SD, and “n” represents number of plant roots.
