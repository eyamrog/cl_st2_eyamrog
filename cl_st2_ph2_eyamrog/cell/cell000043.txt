Title: Lymphoma Driver Mutations in the Pathogenic Evolution of an Iconic Human Autoantibody


Abstract: Summary

Pathogenic autoantibodies arise in many autoimmune diseases, but it is not understood how the cells making them evade immune checkpoints. Here, single-cell multi-omics analysis demonstrates a shared mechanism with lymphoid malignancy in the formation of public rheumatoid factor autoantibodies responsible for mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. By combining single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing with serum antibody peptide sequencing and antibody synthesis, rare circulating B lymphocytes making pathogenic autoantibodies were found to comprise clonal trees accumulating mutations. Lymphoma driver mutations in genes regulating B cell proliferation and V(D)J mutation ( CARD11 , TNFAIP3 , CCND3 , ID3 , BTG2 , and KLHL6 ) were present in rogue B cells producing the pathogenic autoantibody. Antibody V(D)J mutations conferred pathogenicity by causing the antigen-bound autoantibodies to undergo phase transition to insoluble aggregates at lower temperatures. These results reveal a pre-neoplastic stage in human lymphomagenesis and a cascade of somatic mutations leading to an iconic pathogenic autoantibody.

Section: Introduction

The pathogenesis of autoimmune disease has long been hypothesized to share some of the hallmarks of lymphoid cancer ( Burnet, 1972; Dameshek and Schwartz, 1959; Goodnow, 2007; Jacobson et al., 1994 6.

An isotype switched and somatically mutated rheumatoid factor clone isolated from a MRL-lpr/lpr mouse exhibits limited intraclonal affinity maturation J. Immunol. 1994; 152 :4489-4499 PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to clonal evasion of cancer checkpoints, pathogenic autoantibody secretion may result from somatic mutations in “rogue” B lymphocyte clones, enabling B cells with unsuitable antibody characteristics to evade a series of tolerance checkpoints that normally inhibit cells making autoantibodies ( Goodnow, 2007; Goodnow et al., 1995 23. Goodnow, C.C. Multistep pathogenesis of autoimmune disease Cell. 2007; 130 :25-35 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (346) PubMed Google Scholar 24. Goodnow, C.C. ∙ Cyster, J.G. ∙ Hartley, S.B. ... Self-tolerance checkpoints in B lymphocyte development Adv. Immunol. 1995; 59 :279-368 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In mouse experiments, self-reactive B cells are switched to evade anergy and apoptotic checkpoints and instead undergo self-antigen-driven proliferation and plasmablast formation when they acquire individual gain-of-function mutations in the CARD11 gene, found recurrently in human B cell lymphoma ( Jeelall et al., 2012 36. Jeelall, Y.S. ∙ Wang, J.Q. ∙ Law, H.D. ... Human lymphoma mutations reveal CARD11 as the switch between self-antigen-induced B cell death or proliferation and autoantibody production J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1907-1917 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been impossible to test whether lymphoma driver somatic mutations contribute to human autoimmunity because of the rarity of autoantibody-forming cells.
A connected problem is the unexplained clinical transition from “benign” to pathogenic autoantibody syndromes. Autoantibodies are typically present in serum years before clinical autoimmune disease, but it has not been possible to define qualitative or quantitative changes in the autoantibodies responsible for onset of pathology ( Arbuckle et al., 2003; Theander et al., 2015 3. Arbuckle, M.R. ∙ McClain, M.T. ∙ Rubertone, M.V. ... Development of autoantibodies before the clinical onset of systemic lupus erythematosus N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 349 :1526-1533 Crossref Scopus (2086) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Theander, E. ∙ Jonsson, R. ∙ Sjöström, B. ... Prediction of Sjögren’s Syndrome Years Before Diagnosis and Identification of Patients With Early Onset and Severe Disease Course by Autoantibody Profiling Arthritis Rheum. 2015; 67 :2427-2436 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we sought to address two questions using single-cell multi-omics technologies: (1) are lymphoma driver somatic mutations present in cells making a pathogenic autoantibody, and (2) what explains the transition from a benign to pathogenic autoantibody?
We sought generalizable answers to these questions by studying “public” pathogenic autoantibodies: antibodies with similar variable region sequences responsible for pathology in many independent cases of a specific autoimmune disease. This criterion is best met by the rheumatoid factor (RF) autoantibodies in patients with mixed (type II) cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. RFs are immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies binding the Fc domain of self-IgG and were among the first described autoantibodies ( Franklin et al., 1957 22. Franklin, E.C. ∙ Holman, H.R. ∙ Muller-Eberhard, H.J. ... An unusual protein component of high molecular weight in the serum of certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis J. Exp. Med. 1957; 105 :425-438 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although RFs often appear to be benign, they are directly pathogenic in mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis ( Lospalluto et al., 1962; Meltzer et al., 1966 49. Lospalluto, J. ∙ Dorward, B. ∙ Miller, Jr., W. ... Cryoglobulinemia based on interaction between a gamma macroglobulin and 7S gamma globulin Am. J. Med. 1962; 32 :142-147 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar 52. Meltzer, M. ∙ Franklin, E.C. ∙ Elias, K. ... Cryoglobulinemia--a clinical and laboratory study. II. Cryoglobulins with rheumatoid factor activity Am. J. Med. 1966; 40 :837-856 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this disease, a monoclonal pentameric IgM RF binds five normal polyclonal IgG molecules, and the macromolecular complex undergoes a reversible phase transition into insoluble aggregates when cooled below 30°C. The aggregated autoantibody-IgG complexes activate the complement cascade, causing leukocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin (purpura). These insoluble aggregates can also form in and damage kidney glomeruli, peripheral nerves, and other tissues. 60% of pathogenic IgM RF autoantibodies in mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and their benign RF counterparts share a public “Wa idiotype” conferred by the variable domain elements IGHV1-69 , IGHJ4 , and IGKV3-20 ( Crowley et al., 1988; Kunkel et al., 1973; Shokri et al., 1993; Tzioufas et al., 1996 14.

A less frequent public RF carries the “Po idiotype” comprised of IGHV3-7 , IGHJ3 , and IGKV3-15 ( Kunkel et al., 1973 41. Kunkel, H.G. ∙ Agnello, V. ∙ Joslin, F.G. ...

Section: Results

We analyzed the pathogenic RF autoantibody in four patients with mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis that developed in the context of primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) ( Figure S1 A). Benign IgM RF autoantibodies occur in 80% of people with pSS, and 30% progress to systemic autoimmunity, including mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis ( Mariette and Criswell, 2018; Theander et al., 2015 51. Mariette, X. ∙ Criswell, L.A. Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :931-939 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar 77. Theander, E. ∙ Jonsson, R. ∙ Sjöström, B. ... Prediction of Sjögren’s Syndrome Years Before Diagnosis and Identification of Patients With Early Onset and Severe Disease Course by Autoantibody Profiling Arthritis Rheum. 2015; 67 :2427-2436 Crossref Scopus (203) PubMed Google Scholar ). A small percentage of cases develop mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, often making Wa-idiotype RF autoantibodies as cell-surface IgM ( Bende et al., 2005; Shokri et al., 1993; Tzioufas et al., 1996 4.

The nucleotide sequence of the pathogenic RF autoantibody in each patient was deduced by performing peptide sequencing of each autoantibody purified from serum cross-referenced against deep sequencing of antibody heavy- and light-chain mRNAs from 1 million blood cells taken at the same time ( Figure 1 A; Wang et al., 2018 81. Wang, J.J. ∙ Reed, J.H. ∙ Colella, A.D. ... Molecular profiling and clonal tracking of secreted rheumatoid factors in primary Sjögren’s syndrome Arthritis Rheum. 2018; 70 :1617-1625 Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar ). The paired heavy- and light-chain sequence of each pathogenic cryoglobulin was confirmed by single-cell sequencing (see below). Three of the pathogenic autoantibodies were IGHV1-69 Wa idiotype, and one was IGHV3-7 Po idiotype ( Figure S1 B). All four pathogenic autoantibodies had between three and 12 mis-sense somatic mutations in their inferred heavy- and light-chain variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) elements ( Figures 1 B and 1C).
To test the effect of the V(D)J somatic mutations, we synthesized and expressed in vitro each pentameric IgM antibody either in its somatically mutated form or reverted to the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) sequence. Cryoaggregation was measured by temperature-shift spectrophotometry in the presence of a 13-fold molar excess of normal human IgG. Each of the mutated RFs underwent a phase transition into insoluble aggregates below 30°C, whereas none of the unmutated ancestor RFs became insoluble, even at 4°C ( Figure 1 D). In parallel, each of the pathogenic IgM antibodies and their unmutated ancestors were tested for binding to the Fc fragment of normal human IgG by ELISA. Reversion of the somatic mutations drastically decreased each autoantibody’s binding to IgG ( Figure 1 E). Thus, in four of four patients analyzed, representing the two most common pathogenic RF idiotypes, somatic mutation of their autoantibody variable regions was responsible for pathogenic autoantigen binding and cryoaggregation.
Having established that rogue B cells synthesizing the pathogenic autoantibody were present in the circulation, the next step was to capture single cells and test them for mutations. The monoclonal antibody G6 binds antibody heavy chains using IGHV1-69 ( Kipps and Duffy, 1991; Potter et al., 1999; Sasso et al., 1996 40. Kipps, T.J. ∙ Duffy, S.F.

Invest. 1991; 87 :2087-2096 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar 59. Potter, K.N. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Mageed, R.A. ...

Expression of the immunoglobulin VH gene 51p1 is proportional to its germline gene copy number J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97 :2074-2080 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ), enabling flow cytometric identification and single-cell sorting of rare blood cells producing Wa-idiotype autoantibodies in patients SF, MN, and SS2 ( Figure 1 F). In healthy controls, G6 + B cells with a normal 2:1 kappa:lambda light chain ratio are frequent in the mature naive B cell repertoire but rare in the CD27 + memory B cell pool (<0.007% ± 0.004% of lymphocytes). In contrast, G6 + cells exclusively expressing kappa light chains were prominent in the CD27 + memory B cell compartment in patients SS2, SF, and MN, comprising 0.50%, 0.32%, and 0.35% of blood lymphocytes, respectively ( Figure 1 F). Compared with G6 − polyclonal memory B cells, G6 + rogue clonal memory B cells were larger, had lower cell-surface IgM and Igκ, low CD21, and increased CD27 and CD86 ( Figures S1 C and S1D). To analyze single rogue B cells using the Po idiotype, for which an anti-idiotypic antibody is not available, we sorted single CD19 + CD27 + IgD − IgM +/low B cells from patient 5005.
Hundreds of single memory B cells were sorted from blood of each patient into 96-well plates, and RNA and DNA were isolated from each cell ( Figure 2 A). Using single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we assembled large numbers of short-read sequences from each cell to deduce the V(D)J sequence and somatic mutations in each cell’s antibody, confirmed by Sanger sequencing of amplified heavy- and light-chain mRNA. This revealed clonally related cells corresponding to the pathogenic autoantibody in each patient and unrelated memory B cells with diverse polyclonal antibody sequences ( Figure S2 ).
The clonally related cells diverged by somatic mutations in their antibody V(D)J mRNA sequences. A nearest-neighbor heuristic approach that clustered heavy- and light-chain pairs by shared mutations was used to produce clonal trees ( Figure 2 B; Table S1 ). For example, most of the G6 + κ + B cells from patient SF (n = 68) shared 6 replacement and 2 silent V(D)J mutations matching the cryoaggregating autoantibody sequence expressed in vitro ( Figure 1 ), but the majority of cells had acquired additional unique mutations indicating clonal divergence ( Figure 2 B). An earlier clonal precursor with only 2 replacement mutations since the unmutated ancestor was represented in patient SF by a clonal sub-branch of 3 cells that had since acquired additional mutations. Similar patterns of ongoing clonal divergence by somatic mutation and clonal sub-branches characterized the autoantibody-expressing cells circulating in patient SS2 and patient 5005 ( Figure 2 B). In patient MN, all of the G6 + κ + rogue clonal B cells (n = 58) were more distant from the unmutated ancestor, sharing 14 replacement and 21 silent mutations matching the expressed cryoaggregating autoantibody, but again, the individual clonal members diverged from this mutated ancestor by numerous additional cell-specific mutations ( Figure 2 B). These results reveal that apparently homogeneous autoantibodies, sharing a public idiotype between patients and derived from a single clone within each patient, are, in fact, highly heterogeneous. Within each patient, somatic mutations in clonal descendants create a radiating pattern of autoantibody sequences that presumably explore protein folding and solubility space.
Having used the RNA to identify single, clonally related rogue cells responsible for each patient’s autoantibody and also polyclonal control memory B cells in the same blood sample, we used the DNA from each of these cells to perform targeted capture sequencing ( Figure 2 A) of the exons in 153 lymphoma driver genes known to be recurrently mutated in human lymphoma and leukemia ( Table S2 ). To control for false-positive mutations arising during in vitro amplification of genomic DNA from single cells and false negatives from an approximate 50% “drop-out” of DNA alleles that fail to be amplified in each cell, we filtered for exonic variants present in multiple rogue clone cells and absent from any of the polyclonal control B cells in each patient ( Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). Candidate lymphoma driver mutations were validated by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of single-cell DNA. This approach revealed different somatic mutations in lymphoma driver genes in the autoantibody clone of each of the four patients ( Figure 2 B; Table S4 ).
In patient SF, the diverging autoantibody clone carried a heterozygous somatic mutation in the CARD11 latch domain, p.Thr117Pro, a frequently mutated site in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) ( Figure 3 A). The CARD11 Thr117Pro mutation was present in cells throughout the clonal tree, including the clonal sub-branch derived from an earlier clonal precursor with only 2 V(D)J replacement mutations since the unmutated ancestor ( Figures S3 A and S3B). This result establishes that the lymphoma driver mutation was acquired before almost all of the antibody V(D)J mutations that confer pathogenicity.
CARD11 is essential for surface immunoglobulin on B cells to signal activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and B cell proliferation ( Hara et al., 2003; Jun et al., 2003 25.

Somatic gain-of-function CARD11 mutations occur in 10% of DLBCL ( Lenz et al., 2008 45. Lenz, G. ∙ Davis, R.E. ∙ Ngo, V.N. ... Oncogenic CARD11 mutations in human diffuse large B cell lymphoma Science. 2008; 319 :1676-1679 Crossref Scopus (712) PubMed Google Scholar ). CARD11 encodes a cytoplasmic protein with a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) that nucleates fibers of BCL10, MALT1, and other ubiquitin-modifying proteins to activate NF-κB ( Holliday et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2013 27. Holliday, M.J. ∙ Witt, A. ∙ Rodríguez Gama, A. ... Structures of autoinhibited and polymerized forms of CARD9 reveal mechanisms of CARD9 and CARD11 activation Nat.

Structural architecture of the CARMA1/Bcl10/MALT1 signalosome: nucleation-induced filamentous assembly Mol. Cell. 2013; 51 :766-779 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). In unstimulated cells, the N-terminal CARD domain is normally blocked from initiating BCL10 fibers by hydrophobic interactions with residues in the adjacent α-helix latch domain and coiled-coil domain ( Figure 3 B; Holliday et al., 2019; Jattani et al., 2016 27. Holliday, M.J. ∙ Witt, A. ∙ Rodríguez Gama, A. ... Structures of autoinhibited and polymerized forms of CARD9 reveal mechanisms of CARD9 and CARD11 activation Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :3070 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar 35. Jattani, R.P. ∙ Tritapoe, J.M. ∙ Pomerantz, J.L.

Chem. 2016; 291 :8338-8348 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mutations that disrupt key hydrophobic residues in the latch domain helix, exemplified by Phe115Leu, disrupt the autoinhibited state to cause potent gain-of-function signaling to NF-κB. Mutation of Thr117 to a helix-breaking proline would be predicted to cause a similarly potent gain of function. This was confirmed in a luciferase assay using HEK293 cells transduced with inducible vectors encoding destabilizing E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) protein fused with either CARD11 wild type, p.Phe115Leu, p.Thr117Pro, or p.Thr117Ala ( Figure 3 C).
We analyzed the global mRNA expression patterns in the single blood cells from patient SF, comparing normal memory B cells with clonal autoantibody cells carrying CARD11 Thr117Pro . The autoantibody-expressing cells were separated into two populations, one third corresponding to the normal memory B cells and two thirds representing plasmablasts with high expression of mRNAs upregulated in curated plasma cell gene sets ( Figure S3 C) including J-chain and IgM and downregulation of MS4A1 mRNA encoding CD20 ( Figures 3 D and 3E). The indexed flow cytometry data for these cells confirmed that plasmablasts had lower cell-surface CD20 and high CD38 ( Figure 3 F). These results are consistent with experimental evidence of plasmablast differentiation induced by gain-of-function CARD11 mutations in autoantibody-expressing mouse B cells ( Jeelall et al., 2012 36. Jeelall, Y.S. ∙ Wang, J.Q. ∙ Law, H.D. ... Human lymphoma mutations reveal CARD11 as the switch between self-antigen-induced B cell death or proliferation and autoantibody production J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1907-1917 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Bi-allelic lymphoma driver mutations mirroring loss-of-function TNFAIP3 mutations found frequently in human B cell lymphomas that truncate or eliminate an essential NF-κB inhibitory protein, A20 ( Figure 4 A; Compagno et al., 2009; Honma et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2009; Schmitz et al., 2009 13.

Like patient SF, scRNA-seq revealed that the rogue clonal cells in the blood of patient MN were split between two differentiation states, with one half displaying a plasmablast mRNA expression pattern and corresponding low CD20 and high CD38 and one half clustering with normal memory B cells ( Figures 4 B and 4C; Figures S4 E and S4F).
Other lymphoma driver mutations in genes that regulate cell proliferation were also present in the rogue autoantibody clone in patient MN and in patient 5005. In patient MN, TNFAIP3 inactivation was accompanied by CCND3 Thr283Ala , a common gain-of-function mutation disrupting a phosphodegron to prevent proteasomal degradation and increase Cyclin D3 accumulation in Burkitt lymphoma ( Figure 4 D; Figures S4 G and S4H; Richter et al., 2012; Schmitz et al., 2012 66.

The cells also carried an ID3 triple mutation that may be analogous to frequent loss-of-function ID3 mutations in Burkitt lymphoma ( Figure 4 E; Figures S4 G and S4H; Richter et al., 2012; Schmitz et al., 2012 66.

Single cells throughout the autoantibody clonal tree in patient 5005 contained a somatic mutation in BTG2 , p.Gly6Ala, in a conserved, unstructured N-terminal segment ( Winkler, 2010 83. Winkler, G.S. The mammalian anti-proliferative BTG/Tob protein family J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 222 :66-72 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ) that is recurrently mutated by missense mutations in DLBCL ( Reddy et al., 2017 64. Reddy, A. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Davis, N.S. ...

BTG2 inhibits CCND3 accumulation in pre-B cells ( Dolezal et al., 2017 18. Dolezal, E. ∙ Infantino, S. ∙ Drepper, F. ...

Winkler, G.S. The mammalian anti-proliferative BTG/Tob protein family J. Cell. Physiol. 2010; 222 :66-72 Crossref Scopus (235) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The autoantibody expressing blood B cells in two of the patients had somatic mutations in KLHL6 ( Figure 5 ; Figure S5 A). KLHL6 is highly expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells ( Bertocci et al., 2017 5. Bertocci, B. ∙ Lecoeuche, D. ∙ Sterlin, D. ...

MN’s rogue B cells carried a heterozygous KLHL6 mutation, p.Tyr96Cys, representing the third most frequently mutated residue in CLL and DLBCL, whereas patient SS2’s rogue B cells carried a Leu90Pro mutation in the most frequently mutated site ( Figure 5 A), which is substituted to Pro, Val, Arg, or Phe in DLBCL. These mutations alter highly conserved residues in the BTB (Bric à brac 1, Tramtrack, and Broad-complex) domain that is best understood in the PLZF and BACH2 proteins and in other members of the Kelch-like (KLHL) family ( Figures 5 A and 5B).
KLHL proteins are cytoplasmic, substrate-recognizing subunits of the CULLIN3-RING (CRL3) ubiquitin ligase, where the Kelch β-propeller domain binds substrates and the BTB domain binds CUL3. Although Leu90Pro and Tyr96Cys have not been functionally evaluated, other BTB domain mutations (Leu65Pro, Ser94Leu, and Phe97Leu) disrupt binding to CUL3 to prevent KLHL6 autoubiquitination and degradation ( Choi et al., 2018 11. Choi, J. ∙ Lee, K. ∙ Ingvarsdottir, K. ... Loss of KLHL6 promotes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth and survival by stabilizing the mRNA decay factor roquin2 Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :586-596 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). We extended these results to show that KLHL6 Leu90Pro and KLHL6 Tyr96Cys are also loss-of-function mutations displaying increased KLHL6 protein accumulation in 293T cells ( Figure 5 C) and diminished interaction with CUL3 ( Figure 5 D; Figure S5 B). In the crystal structure of KLHL11 bound to CUL3 ( Canning et al., 2013 8. Canning, P. ∙ Cooper, C.D. ∙ Krojer, T. ... Structural basis for Cul3 protein assembly with the BTB-Kelch family of E3 ubiquitin ligases J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 :7803-7814 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), the side chains corresponding to the frequently mutated Leu90 and Tyr97 in KLHL6 contribute to the hydrophobic core and contact surface where the BTB domain binds CUL3, with the tyrosine forming a hydrogen bond to Glu55 in CUL3 ( Figure 5 B).
As homozygotes, KLHL6 Leu90Pro CRISPR- Cas9 gene-edited mice (the orthologous mutation in mice is Klhl6 Leu88Pro ) exhibited decreased maturation of immature B cells into mature B cells, comparable with mice with a homozygous KLHL6 null mutation ( Figure S5 C; Bertocci et al., 2017 5. Bertocci, B. ∙ Lecoeuche, D. ∙ Sterlin, D. ... Klhl6 Deficiency Impairs Transitional B Cell Survival and Differentiation J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :2408-2420 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). In heterozygous Klhl6 Leu88Pro mice, however, where B cells have a genotype corresponding to the rogue cells in patient SS2, B cell maturation was not significantly altered ( Figures S5 D–S5F). These results, together with the high frequency of heterozygous Leu90, Leu65, Tyr97, and Leu96 missense mutations in human lymphoma or CLL and the paucity of KLHL6 truncating mutations, implies that the lymphoma driver advantage is different from the B cell development deficits seen in knockout mice. Instead, a different heterozygous advantage must be conferred by acquiring a single allele selectively inactivating BTB domain binding to CUL3.
In patient SS2, the two KLHL6 alleles could be distinguished by an inherited germline SNP near codon 90, revealing that one allele carried the KLHL6 Leu90Pro mutation in cells throughout a large branch of the autoantibody clonal tree (blue branch in Figure 2 B and Figures S5 G and S5H). This same allele was unmutated in sister rogue cells throughout the other main clonal branch (orange), establishing that the KLHL6 mutation arose around the time the blue branch diverged from the orange branch. Analysis of single blood cells collected from patient SS2 in 2011, 2 years before onset of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, established that the KLHL6 mutant and wild-type sub-clonal branches were already well established in similar proportions at a time when the patient had a benign RF autoantibody ( Figures S5 I and S5J).
Patient SS2’s single blood cells thus provided a unique in hominum opportunity to compare hundreds of clonally matched memory B cells with an almost identical antibody V(D)J sequence, present at the same time in the same blood sample from the same person but differing in the presence or absence of a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the KLHL6 BTB domain. Surprisingly, when we compared the global mRNA expression pattern between these sister populations of rogue B cells, we found no evidence for consistent differences in mRNA expression caused by the heterozygous KLHL6 Leu90Pro mutation, either globally or by gene set enrichment analysis, including GC gene sets, AICDA , and immunoglobulin- or interferon-induced genes ( Figure 6 A).
In contrast, comparison of 118 rogue cells in 2011 and 138 rogue cells in 2013 from patient SS2 showed that those carrying KLHL6 Leu90Pro (blue branch) accumulated significantly more antibody V(D)J mutations than their sister cells with unmutated KLHL6 (orange branch, Figure 6 B). The low number of V(D)J mutations in cells of the orange branch indicates that G6 + IgM memory B cells are not intrinsically prone to accumulate numerous V(D)J mutations. Because this analysis compares hundreds of individual cells matched for all other known variables, we conclude that the heterozygous missense mutation in KLHL6 increased the accumulation of V(D)J mutations in human blood memory B cells.
To generalize that conclusion, we crossed mice with the orthologous Klhl6 Leu88Pro mutation with immunoglobulin gene knockin (SW HEL ) mice to establish an experimental animal model for the blue and orange sub-clonal branches in patient SS2. Competing populations of heterozygous Klhl6 Leu88Pro mutant and wild-type B cells were analyzed, matched with an identical immunoglobulin V(D)J sequence and identical C57BL/6 genetic makeup, except for a CD45.1 congenic marker, to distinguish the cells by flow cytometry. To mirror patient SS2, these competing sister populations of proliferating B cells were established in Klhl6 wild-type animals ( Figure 6 C). There was equal accumulation of the competing KLHL6 Leu88Pro mutant and wild-type SW HEL cells in GC 29 days after immunization ( Figure S6 A), indicating that heterozygous Klhl6 mutation did not provide a discernible proliferative or survival advantage. Single-cell sequencing of the V(D)J exon in each SW HEL cell nevertheless revealed the KLHL6 Leu88Pro mutant B cells consistently accumulated more silent (unselected) mutations than their sister cells with normal KLHL6 ( Figure 6 D; Figure S6 B). KLHL6 Leu88Pro B cells showed normal selection of affinity-enhancing replacement mutations ( Figures S6 C and S6D), indicating that KLHL6 mutation increased V(D)J mutation accumulation but did not affect selection.
Because the clone analyzed in patient SS2 corresponded to unswitched IgM + memory B cells with low V(D)J mutation rates and not GC B cells with high mutation rates, we extended the SW HEL cell experiments to analyze GC-independent formation of predominantly unswitched IgM + memory B cells ( Chan et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2012 9. Chan, T.D. ∙ Gatto, D. ∙ Wood, K. ... Antigen affinity controls rapid T-dependent antibody production by driving the expansion rather than the differentiation or extrafollicular migration of early plasmablasts J. Immunol. 2009; 183 :3139-3149 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar 76. Taylor, J.J. ∙ Pape, K.A. ∙ Jenkins, M.K. A germinal center-independent pathway generates unswitched memory B cells early in the primary response J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :597-606 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 6 E). There was comparable accumulation of Klhl6 mutant and wild-type B220 high Fas low CD38 high SW HEL memory B cells 29 days after immunization ( Figure S6 E). Only 5% of memory B cells with normal KLHL6 had acquired a single VDJ mutation, whereas 27% of Klhl6 Leu88Pro memory B cells had accumulated between 1 and 7 VDJ mutations, representing a significant increase in silent and replacement mutations ( Figure 6 F). Thus, in human and mouse memory B cells, a heterozygous KLHL6 BTB mutation increases accumulation of random antibody V(D)J mutations.
As noted above, analysis of single cells in patient SS2’s autoantibody clonal tree revealed that the KLHL6 Leu90Pro mutation arose at the divergence of the V(D)J-mutating “blue” sub-clonal branch and was already present in 2011, when the autoantibody clonal tree was already well evolved, 2 years before transition from a benign RF to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Relative to the inferred UCA B cell (gray, sequence 1), all of the single cells present at both time points had diverged from a mutated common ancestor (MCA) that had acquired 2 silent and 3 replacement immunoglobulin mutations. Several single cells at both time points were closely related to the MCA (black, sequence 3, Figure 7 B). However, most of the rogue cells present had diverged into two major sub-clonal branches. All cells on the orange branch had a replacement mutation in the light-chain third complementarity-determining region (CDR3), Gly108Ala (sequence 2, Figure 7 B). All cells in the blue branch were descended from the black ancestor sequence 3 but had acquired a heavy-chain CDR3 replacement, Tyr115Phe (sequence 4, Figure 7 B). The sequence shown to produce a pathogenic cryoglobulin ( Figure 1 ) is denoted in red in Figure 7 (sequence 5, Figure 7 B). Cells in this red sub-branch diverged from the blue branch by acquiring two light-chain mutations: a silent c.C281T nucleotide substitution and c.G277 > C, creating a Gly108Ala replacement identical to that acquired independently in cells of the orange branch.
Cells in the red sub-branch appeared to be the chief difference in the autoantibody clonal tree from 2011–2013, accounting for only 5.1% (6 of 118) of rogue cells in 2011 and 14.5% (20 of 138) in 2013 ( Figure 7 C). This 2.8-fold increase was accompanied by a 1.9-fold increase in the frequency of G6 + cells among memory B cells ( Figure S7 A), representing a 5.3-fold overall increase. In deep-sequenced mRNA obtained from 1 million blood mononuclear cells, kappa light chain ( IGK ) mRNA from the red sub-branch could be distinguished from clonally related IGK mRNA from other parts of the autoantibody tree by the presence of paired c.C281T and c.G277C nucleotide mutations; it increased from 2.5% of all IGK mRNA in 2011 to 12.9% in 2013 at onset of vasculitis and 27.3% in 2016 at vasculitis relapse ( Figure 7 D). In contrast, IGK mRNA from cells in the orange branch and the other cells in the blue branch accounted for 20% and 15% of kappa mRNA in 2011, respectively, and these percentages showed little change in 2013 or 2016 ( Figure 7 D).
Flow cytometric evidence suggested that cells belonging to the red branch synthesized a functionally distinct antibody because they had half the surface IgM present on sibling cells on the blue or orange branches ( Figure 7 E). Their decreased surface IgM was not explained by differences in Ig heavy- or light-chain mRNA or CD79 mRNA ( Figure S7 B) or global mRNA changes ( Figure S7 D), implying that the single additional Gly108Ala light-chain mutation that differentiated the red antibody sequence from the blue precursor affected post-translational accumulation of IgM on the cell surface.
We expressed representative antibodies (sequences 2–5) and the unmutated ancestor (sequence 1) either as recombinant pentameric IgM or as monovalent Fab fragments. When tested by ELISA for binding to immobilized native human IgG Fc, the black branch IgM (sequence 3) had just-measurable binding compared with the unmutated ancestor ( Figure 7 F). Expressed as monovalent Fab, the affinity of the unmutated ancestor was too low to measure, with less than 10% of the binding signal from 4 μM IgG Fc compared with the blue-branch Fab ( Figure S7 C). IgM representing the blue branch (sequence 4) and its red sub-branch (sequence 5) exhibited increased binding by ELISA, and their corresponding Fab had K D values of 11.2 μM and 4.8 μM, respectively ( Figure 7 F; Figure S7 C). Pentameric IgM and Fab corresponding to the major orange branch (sequence 2) displayed binding comparable with the red sub-branch, with a Fab K D value of 5.3 μM.
These results showed that modest affinity maturation of the autoantibody occurred on both clonal branches, with orange and red branches converging on comparable affinity and a shared light-chain CDR3 Gly108Ala replacement. However, in the presence of 33 μM normal human IgG–an antigen concentration well in excess of the K D for orange, blue, or red Fab—only IgM corresponding to the red branch exhibited a large temperature-dependent phase transition to form insoluble aggregates ( Figures 7 G and 7H). Thus, the red sub-branch of the clone produced a potent cryoaggregating IgM RF as a consequence of a single light-chain CDR3 replacement mutation, Gly108Ala, added to the three other replacement mutations acquired by precursors in the blue branch, with the pathogenic combination of V(D)J mutations acquired after the cells had acquired the KLHL6 Leu90Pro mutation.
Autoantibody binding to IgG and cryoaggregation were also genetically separable in the autoantibody clonal tree in patient 5005. Here a sub-branch of cells acquired 6 additional replacement and 5 silent V(D)J mutations that abolished cryoaggregation but did not discernably alter IgG binding ( Figures S7 E and S7F). This shows that V(D)J mutations can cause and correct solubility problems in autoantibodies.

Section: Discussion

The multi-omics single-cell analysis above reveals a cascade of somatic genetic events in the evolution of a public pathogenic autoantibody in four patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis complicating Sjögren’s syndrome. The first was immunoglobulin gene VDJ recombination, creating the stereotypic combination of V(D)J elements and HCDR3 length characteristic of RF antibodies of Wa and Po public idiotypes ( Crowley et al., 1988; Kunkel et al., 1973; Shokri et al., 1993; Tzioufas et al., 1996 14.

We estimate that the Wa idiotype combination arises in 0.03% of newly formed B cells ( STAR Methods ). As shown in Figures 1 and 7 , the unmutated V(D)J combinations nevertheless have very weak binding to self-IgG in all four patients analyzed here. High precursor frequency and low affinity for IgG autoantigen would enable these newly formed B cells to evade triggering of central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints and be activated transiently whenever IgG forms complexes with foreign microbes ( Goodnow et al., 1995 24. Goodnow, C.C. ∙ Cyster, J.G. ∙ Hartley, S.B. ... Self-tolerance checkpoints in B lymphocyte development Adv. Immunol. 1995; 59 :279-368 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
The second step was B cell proliferation coupled with low-rate immunoglobulin gene mutation and modest affinity maturation to yield a large clone producing a low-affinity, benign RF autoantibody, similar to the large clones observed in Fas-deficient MRL mice ( Jacobson et al., 1994; Shlomchik et al., 1987 34. Jacobson, B.A. ∙ Sharon, J. ∙ Shan, H. ... An isotype switched and somatically mutated rheumatoid factor clone isolated from a MRL-lpr/lpr mouse exhibits limited intraclonal affinity maturation J.

The role of clonal selection and somatic mutation in autoimmunity Nature. 1987; 328 :805-811 Crossref Scopus (660) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mice, these low-affinity RF B cells are stimulated to divide and mutate by circulating IgG complexed with self-chromatin or ribonucleoprotein, delivering ligands for IgG-binding surface IgM and RNA- or DNA-binding TLR7 and TLR9 ( Herlands et al., 2008; Leadbetter et al., 2002 26. Herlands, R.A. ∙ Christensen, S.R. ∙ Sweet, R.A. ...

Chromatin-IgG complexes activate B cells by dual engagement of IgM and Toll-like receptors Nature. 2002; 416 :603-607 Crossref Scopus (1654) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the four pSS patients studied here, IgG autoantibodies against Ro and La ribonucleoproteins may provide this proliferation and mutation drive ( Reed et al., 2013 65. Reed, J.H. ∙ Sim, S. ∙ Wolin, S.L. ... Ro60 requires Y3 RNA for cell surface exposure and inflammation associated with cardiac manifestations of neonatal lupus J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :110-116 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clonal dominance by progeny of a single RF B cell may arise simply by rare immunoglobulin mutations that improve affinity for self-IgG.
The third somatic genetic event in each of the four patients analyzed here was acquisition of mutations in lymphoma and/or leukemia driver genes. In patient SF, a potent gain-of-function CARD11 Thr117Pro mutation could be shown to have arisen before all but two of the V(D)J mutations responsible for pathogenic cryoaggregation. Based on mouse experiments, CARD11 gain-of-function mutations are sufficient to override tolerance checkpoints ( Jeelall et al., 2012 36. Jeelall, Y.S. ∙ Wang, J.Q. ∙ Law, H.D. ... Human lymphoma mutations reveal CARD11 as the switch between self-antigen-induced B cell death or proliferation and autoantibody production J. Exp. Med. 2012; 209 :1907-1917 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ). Biallelic TNFAIP3 inactivation in patient MN may have similar effects, based on dysregulated B cells and autoantibodies in mice with homozygous B cell-specific loss of Tnfaip3 function ( Chu et al., 2011; Hövelmeyer et al., 2011; Tavares et al., 2010 12. Chu, Y. ∙ Vahl, J.C. ∙ Kumar, D. ... B cells lacking the tumor suppressor TNFAIP3/A20 display impaired differentiation and hyperactivation and cause inflammation and autoimmunity in aged mice Blood. 2011; 117 :2227-2236 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar 29.

The ubiquitin modifying enzyme A20 restricts B cell survival and prevents autoimmunity Immunity. 2010; 33 :181-191 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). In patient SS2, the KLHL6 Leu90Pro mutation preceded pathogenic autoantibody secretion by more than 2 years and was followed by the pathogenic V(D)J mutations. In the other three patients evaluated, none of the circulating cells represented early stages in the clonal tree, but in each case a radiating pattern of autoantibody sequences in individual clonal progeny could be shown to have arisen after the lymphoma driver mutation.
The final somatic genetic event in the cascade, precipitating transition from a benign RF to cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, was accumulation of particular V(D)J mutations that compromise solubility of autoantibody-antigen complexes. In patient SS2 we showed that the final step was a single light-chain Gly > Ala substitution in a clonal sub-branch (red), but only in combination with three other replacement mutations acquired by clonal precursors. The increase in circulating cells and mRNA from this clonal sub-branch at the onset of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis could theoretically be random or result from changes in the way the antibody signaled on the cell surface or an undetected additional lymphoma driver mutation. Although autoimmune disease pathogenesis has focused on mutations that increase antibody affinity, many neurodegenerative diseases are triggered by mutations that increase protein propensity to undergo phase transition into insoluble aggregates or polymers. Large protein assemblies pose a risk of insolubility in body fluids, but this problem must require especially sophisticated quality control mechanisms for antibodies where V(D)J recombination and hypermutation create novel protein sequences with unique folding and solubility challenges. As illustrated by patient 5005, V(D)J mutations can create and correct poor solubility in autoantibody-antigen complexes.
Although each of the lymphoma driver genes mutated in the patients studied here have been connected to cell proliferation, our analysis of KLHL6 mutation reveals an additional connection to V(D)J mutation. KLHL6 is highly expressed in GC B cells that undergo high-rate immunoglobulin V(D)J mutation ( Bertocci et al., 2017 5. Bertocci, B. ∙ Lecoeuche, D. ∙ Sterlin, D. ... Klhl6 Deficiency Impairs Transitional B Cell Survival and Differentiation J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :2408-2420 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ). Heterozygous KLHL6 missense mutations concentrating in the BTB domain are found in 3% of CLL and 8% of DLBCL, where they appear to be mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations ( Landau et al., 2015; Morin et al., 2011; Puente et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2017 42. Landau, D.A. ∙ Tausch, E. ∙ Taylor-Weiner, A.N. ... Mutations driving CLL and their evolution in progression and relapse Nature. 2015; 526 :525-530 Crossref Scopus (792) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Morin, R.D. ∙ Mendez-Lago, M. ∙ Mungall, A.J. ... Frequent mutation of histone-modifying genes in non-Hodgkin lymphoma Nature. 2011; 476 :298-303 Crossref Scopus (1330) PubMed Google Scholar 60. Puente, X.S. ∙ Pinyol, M. ∙ Quesada, V. ... Whole-genome sequencing identifies recurrent mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia Nature. 2011; 475 :101-105 Crossref Scopus (1283) PubMed Google Scholar 64. Reddy, A. ∙ Zhang, J. ∙ Davis, N.S. ... Genetic and Functional Drivers of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Cell. 2017; 171 :481-494.e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (740) PubMed Google Scholar ). Like TP53 mutations, it is conceivable that KLHL6 mutations also create a mutator phenotype. In CLL, KLHL6 mutations are restricted to cases with V(D)J mutation, but it is not known whether KLHL6 mutation increases V(D)J mutation or whether increased AID activity in this CLL subset mutates KLHL6 as an off-target passenger event. There are no longitudinal studies within a CLL clone comparing V(D)J mutation accumulation before and after KLHL6 mutation. The experiments here establish that the most common site for KLHL6 mutation is not simply a passenger; it compromises function and increases V(D)J mutation.
Although the mechanism linking KLHL6 mutation to increased V(D)J mutation is a follow-up question, several hypotheses are suggested by other studies. Experimentally produced bi-allelic KLHL6 loss-of-function mutations enhance lymphoma growth and survival in vitro ( Choi et al., 2018 11. Choi, J. ∙ Lee, K. ∙ Ingvarsdottir, K. ... Loss of KLHL6 promotes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma growth and survival by stabilizing the mRNA decay factor roquin2 Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :586-596 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) and increase cell cycle mRNAs in immature mouse B cells ( Bertocci et al., 2017 5. Bertocci, B. ∙ Lecoeuche, D. ∙ Sterlin, D. ... Klhl6 Deficiency Impairs Transitional B Cell Survival and Differentiation J. Immunol. 2017; 199 :2408-2420 Crossref Scopus (15) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility that increased cell replication could increase V(D)J mutation. However, we did not observe preferential accumulation of heterozygous KLHL6 L90P B cells (blue branch) over KLHL6 WT cells (orange branch) in patient SS2’s autoantibody clone during the 6-year period analyzed here, nor in the corresponding mouse GC or memory B cells, despite accumulating more immunoglobulin mutations in each context. Heterozygous KLHL6 BTB domain mutation may increase the probability that memory B cells transiently adopt GC cell fates, which might not be detected in the circulating cells of patient SS2. V(D)J mutations and off-target mutations are increased by AICDA mutations and perturbations that alter activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) cytoplasm-nucleus shuttling and ubiquitination ( Aoufouchi et al., 2008; Orthwein et al., 2010 2. Aoufouchi, S. ∙ Faili, A. ∙ Zober, C. ... Proteasomal degradation restricts the nuclear lifespan of AID J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205 :1357-1368 Crossref Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar 55.

Med. 2010; 207 :2751-2765 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising the possibility that AID is regulated by the KLHL6-CUL3 ubiquitin ligase.
Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is correlated with an ∼2-fold higher risk of B cell lymphoma in people with pSS ( Mariette and Criswell, 2018; Quartuccio et al., 2014; Tzioufas et al., 1996 51. Mariette, X. ∙ Criswell, L.A. Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 378 :931-939 Crossref Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Quartuccio, L. ∙ Isola, M. ∙ Baldini, C. ...

Here we provide a mechanistic explanation for that correlation in a direct causal sequence starting with lymphoma driver mutation followed by random immunoglobulin V(D)J mutations, a subset of which convert a benign autoantibody into a pathogenic one by diminishing protein solubility. Our findings also provide unique insight into the early stages of lymphomagenesis, where clones of memory cells with driver mutations circulate with remarkably unperturbed mRNA and cell-surface phenotype compared with their normal counterparts. We anticipate that single-cell multi-omics analysis of rogue autoimmune lymphocytes will be widely applicable for revealing pathogenic differences from normal cells and tracing responsiveness to targeted therapy.

Peripheral blood was collected from four patients with serum cryoglobulins ( Figure S1 A) and fulfilling the American-European Consensus Group Criteria for primary Sjögren’s syndrome ( Shiboski et al., 2017; Vitali et al., 2002 72. Shiboski, C.H. ∙ Shiboski, S.C. ∙ Seror, R. ..., International Sjögren’s Syndrome Criteria Working Group 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria for Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome: A Consensus and Data-Driven Methodology Involving Three International Patient Cohorts Arthritis Rheum. 2017; 69 :35-45 Crossref Scopus (1003) PubMed Google Scholar 80. Vitali, C. ∙ Bombardieri, S. ∙ Jonsson, R. ..., European Study Group on Classification Criteria for Sjögren’s Syndrome Classification criteria for Sjögren’s syndrome: a revised version of the European criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002; 61 :554-558 Crossref Scopus (4681) PubMed Google Scholar ). All patients were seropositive for RF by nephelometry, SSA/Ro60, Ro52 and SSB/La were measured by ELISA. SF’s blood was obtained three months after receiving 2 doses of Rituximab (1g, 2 weeks apart) and ongoing plasma exchange. SS2 was not being treated with any immunomodulatory medications at the time of blood sampling in 2011 and 2013 and was taking 0.5 mg of colchicine daily for the 2016 sample. MN was receiving hydroxychloroquine (400mg daily) and prednisolone (12.5mg daily) and 5005 was receiving prednisolone (20mg daily) at the time of blood sampling. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared with Ficoll-Paque and cryopreserved in RPMI 1640, 50% fetal calf serum and 10% DMSO. Written informed consent was obtained prior to blood collection. The study was conducted with approval from local Human Research Ethics Committees: Southern Adelaide Clinical; Central Adelaide Local Health Network and Western Sydney Local Health District.
CRISPR- Cas9 gene editing was performed by the MEGA Facility at the Garvan Institute (Sydney, Australia) and Australian BioResources (Moss Vale, Australia) to generate C57BL/6 mice with the corresponding Klhl6 Leu > Pro substitution (Leu88Pro). Breeding with SW HEL immunoglobulin gene targeted C57BL/6.SJL Ptprc a/a congenic mice (CD45.1) ( Phan et al., 2003 57. Phan, T.G. ∙ Amesbury, M. ∙ Gardam, S. ... B cell receptor-independent stimuli trigger immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination and production of IgG autoantibodies by anergic self-reactive B cells J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197 :845-860 Crossref Scopus (188) PubMed Google Scholar ), yielded Klhl6 WT/L88P Ptprc a/b (CD45.1/CD45.2) offspring. The Garvan Institute’s Animal Ethics Committee approved all mouse protocols and procedures.
IgM-RF heavy chains were purified from serum by precipitating with heat-aggregated IgG followed by reduced SDS-PAGE ( Wang et al., 2018 81. Wang, J.J. ∙ Reed, J.H. ∙ Colella, A.D. ... Molecular profiling and clonal tracking of secreted rheumatoid factors in primary Sjögren’s syndrome Arthritis Rheum. 2018; 70 :1617-1625 Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar ). However, this method does not separate RF light chains from IgG light chains, as both migrate at 25 kd. To separate light chains from IgG and RFs, the complexes of IgG/IgM-RFs were eluted with 0.1M glycine and 0.5M NaCl, pH 2.3, neutralised with 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and concentrated using a 10,000MWCO Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter (Millipore), then IgG and IgM-RFs were separated by non-reduced SDS-PAGE (Any kD Mini-PROTEAN_TGX Stain Free Protein Gel, Biorad). The IgM-RF band containing both heavy and light chains was excised and digested with Pierce trypsin protease (ThermoFisher Scientific), chymotrypsin (Promega), and elastase (Promega), respectively. Digested peptides were analyzed using a TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) coupled to an Ekspert NanoLC 415 HPLC (Eksigent).
Total mRNA was extracted from 1x10 6 thawed PBMC and reverse transcribed to cDNA with oligo-dT primers (Bio-Rad). Immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chain cDNA were amplified by PCR using forward primers binding the leader sequences of Ig variable segments and reverse primers binding γ (IgG), μ (IgM), κ (IgK), or λ (IgL) constant regions ( Table S5 ). The primers incorporated universal 5ʹ sequences compatible with the Illumina Nextera protocol. IgM, IgG, IgK and IgL amplicons were barcoded using the Nextera Index kit to enable pooling of multiple samples and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq capturing 300bp paired-end reads to a depth of ∼1 million read pairs per sample. Ig repertoire sequence data was processed as previously described ( Ellebedy et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2014 19. Ellebedy, A.H. ∙ Jackson, K.J. ∙ Kissick, H.T. ... Defining antigen-specific plasmablast and memory B cell subsets in human blood after viral infection or vaccination Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17 :1226-1234 Crossref Scopus (264) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Jackson, K.J. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Roskin, K.M. ... Human responses to influenza vaccination show seroconversion signatures and convergent antibody rearrangements Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16 :105-114 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, following barcode demultiplexing, merged paired-end amplicons were aligned against the IMGT human reference IGHV, IGHD and IGHJ gene segments using a local installation of IgBLAST ( Ye et al., 2013 84. Ye, J. ∙ Ma, N. ∙ Madden, T.L. ... IgBLAST: an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence analysis tool Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :W34-40 Crossref Scopus (721) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clonal lineages, frequency and relationships were inferred by clustering CDR3 nucleotide sequences at 90% identity for reads that utilized the same V and J segments and had equal CDR3 lengths. Ig repertoire reference databases for each sample were generated by translating productively rearranged cDNA amplicons from the Ig mRNA sequencing libraries. IgM-RF heavy-chain and light-chain peptide sequences were searched against the matched translated mRNA reference database by PEAKS Studio v8.0 (Bioinformatics Solutions) ( Wang et al., 2018 81. Wang, J.J. ∙ Reed, J.H. ∙ Colella, A.D. ... Molecular profiling and clonal tracking of secreted rheumatoid factors in primary Sjögren’s syndrome Arthritis Rheum. 2018; 70 :1617-1625 Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar ).
Mutated and unmutated common ancestor Ig heavy and light chain and J chain cDNA sequences of rheumatoid factor autoantibodies were synthesized in pCDNA3.1+ expression vectors by Biomatik (Ontario, Canada). IgM antibodies were transiently expressed in Expi293 cells (Life Technologies) using a serum-free cell culture system according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Supernatants containing secreted IgM were collected 7 days post-transfection and concentrated 30-fold. IgM was quantified by ELISA using Nunc Maxisorp plates coated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-human IgM antibody (Jackson Labs). After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, diluted supernatants and purified human IgM standard (Jackson Labs) were incubated for one hour at room temperature. Wells were washed with 0.1% Tween20/PBS and anti-human IgM-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Aldrich) was applied, followed by para-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. Plates were read at an optical density (OD) at 405nm and the concentration of IgM in supernatants quantified by comparison to the IgM standard curve.
Binding of RF IgM to IgG Fc was evaluated by ELISA on plates coated with 5 μg/ml human native IgG Fc (Abcam) and blocked with 3% BSA/PBS. Recombinant RF IgM supernatants were diluted to 200 μg/ml in 1% BSA/PBS and serially diluted before adding to the plate for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, anti-human IgM-alkaline phosphatase was applied and developed as described above. To evaluate monovalent binding and establish affinity kinetics for each of the RF sub-clones, mutant and unmutated common ancestor Ig heavy and light chain Fab sequences were synthesized and cloned into pCEP4 expression vectors ( Burnett et al., 2018 7. Burnett, D.L. ∙ Langley, D.B. ∙ Schofield, P. ... Germinal center antibody mutation trajectories are determined by rapid self/foreign discrimination Science. 2018; 360 :223-226 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fab fragments were transiently expressed using the Expi293 system and purified from cell culture supernatant using HisTrap FF crude columns (GE Healthcare). Interactions between Fab fragments and IgG Fc were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Biotinylated Fabs were loaded onto streptavidin sensorchips at 1300RU. Soluble recombinant human IgG1 Fc was incubated with sensors for 60 s at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 4 μM. Global fits for equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) for each 1:1 Fab:Fc interaction were determined using Scrubber 2 (Biologic Software).
Cryoglobulin activity was evaluated by a spectrophotometric assay based on light scattering ( Kalovidouris and Johnson, 1978 38. Kalovidouris, A.E. ∙ Johnson, R.L. Rapid cryoglobulin screening: an aid to the clinician Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1978; 37 :444-448 Crossref Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). IgM supernatants (0.5-2 mg/ml, 0.5-2 μM) were mixed with an equal volume of human gamma-globulin (1-10 mg/ml, 6.7-67 μM) or normal human serum (0.1 ml) at 37°C. Half of the mixture was transferred to another tube and incubated at 4°C while the remaining mixture was maintained at 37°C. After 1 hour, the OD at 500 nm was measured for each mixture. Cryoaggregation was quantified by subtracting OD 500 at 37°C from OD 500 at 4°C for each antibody. To evaluate real time cryoaggregation, a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer was used to evaluate the above mixtures of IgM supernatant and human gamma-globulin prepared at 37°C and subjected to temperature reduction of 0.1°C/min to 4°C, analyzing OD 500 of the different IgM antibodies simultaneously in parallel cuvettes.
Thawed PBMC were washed twice in PBS/1% BSA and incubated with Fc block for 30 min at 4°C. After washing, cells were stained with antibodies against CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD27, CD38, IgD, IgK, IgM and eBioscience™ Fixable Viability Dye. Anti-idiotypic monoclonal G6 antibody ( Potter et al., 1999 59. Potter, K.N. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Mageed, R.A. ... Molecular characterization of the VH1-specific variable region determinants recognized by anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies G6 and G8 Scand. J. Immunol. 1999; 50 :14-20 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ) was fluorescently labeled using the Alexa Fluor 647 Antibody Labeling kit (Life Technologies). Single cells were sorted into 96-well LoBind PCR plates (Eppendorf) on a FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences). For patient SS2, single RF B cells (CD3 - CD20 + CD27 + IgD - IgM + G6 + κ + ) and developmentally matched polyclonal B cells (2013: CD3 - CD20 + CD27 + IgD - IgM + G6 - κ - ; 2011: CD3 - CD20 + CD27 + IgD - IgM + G6 - ) were sorted, along with pools of 50 cells from 2013 sample. For patients MN, SF and 5005 single IgM + memory/plasmablast B cells (CD3 - CD19 + CD27 + IgD - IgM + ) were sorted and rogue clones were determined post hoc by Ig reconstruction from scRNA-seq. For parallel scRNA-seq and genomic DNA (gDNA) sequencing, single cells were sorted into 2 μL of RLT buffer (QIAGEN). For some plates for patient SS2, only scRNA-seq was performed by sorting cells into 2uL of Smart-seq2 lysis buffer ( Picelli et al., 2014 58. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2437) PubMed Google Scholar ).
gDNA and mRNA were isolated from single cells or pools of 50 B or 50 T cells using the G&T protocol ( Macaulay et al., 2015 50. Macaulay, I.C. ∙ Haerty, W. ∙ Kumar, P. ... G&T-seq: parallel sequencing of single-cell genomes and transcriptomes Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :519-522 Crossref Scopus (525) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mRNA of each cell was processed for scRNA-seq using the Smart-seq2 protocol described below. gDNA was subjected to multiple displacement amplification (MDA) using the REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MDA amplified products were purified using AMPure XP beads (Agencourt) and processed for either targeted capture or gene-specific PCR amplification.
Smart-seq2 scRNA-seq followed the protocol of Picelli et al. (2014) 58. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2437) PubMed Google Scholar with the following modifications. Reactions were performed at half volumes, the IS PCR primer was reduced to 50nM final concentration and the number of PCR cycles increased to 28. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) at one quarter of the recommended volume. In total, 940 cells were sequenced across 7 runs using an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument with 150 bp paired-end reads to a median depth of ∼1 million reads per cell. scRNA-seq sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh38 using STAR2.5.4b ( Dobin et al., 2013 17. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (25605) PubMed Google Scholar ) and deduplicated using SAMtools 0.1.19 ( Li et al., 2009 48. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (37560) PubMed Google Scholar ). Per-gene expression levels were called at count and transcript per million (TPM) levels using RSEM v1.3.0 ( Li and Dewey, 2011 47. Li, B. ∙ Dewey, C.N. RSEM: accurate transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data with or without a reference genome BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 :323 Crossref Scopus (13397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Gene expression counts were normalized and recovered using SAVER ( Huang et al., 2018 30. Huang, M. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Torre, E. ... SAVER: gene expression recovery for single-cell RNA sequencing Nat. Methods. 2018; 15 :539-542 Crossref Scopus (414) PubMed Google Scholar ) with default values, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found using limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 67. Ritchie, M.E. ∙ Phipson, B. ∙ Wu, D. ... limma powers differential expression analyses for RNA-sequencing and microarray studies Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 :e47 Crossref Scopus (20556) PubMed Google Scholar ) on the log-transformed recovered counts. Bonferroni correction was applied to each set of p-value s DEGs were defined as having a family-wise error rate (FWER) of < 0.05.
Paired Ig heavy and light chain full-length sequences were assembled from scRNA-seq data for individual cells with VDJPuzzle ( Rizzetto et al., 2018 68. Rizzetto, S. ∙ Koppstein, D.N.P. ∙ Samir, J. ... B-cell receptor reconstruction from single-cell RNA-seq with VDJPuzzle Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :2846-2847 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). Somatic hypermutation calls were confirmed to be accurate by Sanger sequencing amplified LVDJ-Cmu and LVJ-Ckappa products from the Smart-seq2 cDNA of 65 single cells from the SS2 2013 time point, using the primers described above for deep Ig sequencing. For sample SS2 2011, 65/144 G6 - normal and 118/168 G6 + rogue cells were assigned paired heavy and light chain sequences, while for the 2013 time point, 70/81 G6 - normal and 138/148 G6 + rogue memory B cells were assigned paired heavy and light chain sequences. For sample MN, a total of 95 IgM + memory B cells were sequenced by scRNA-seq resulting in a total of 57 rogue and 17 normal cells with paired heavy and light chain sequences. For sample SF, a total of 160 IgM + memory B cells were sequenced by scRNA-seq resulting in a total of 68 rogue cells and 24 normal cells with paired heavy and light chain sequences. For sample 5005, a total of 144 IgM + memory B cells were sequenced by scRNA-seq resulting in a total of 27 rogue cells and 67 normal cells with paired heavy and light chain sequences. “Rogue” classification was determined post hoc based on clonal IGHV1-69 (SF, SS2 and MN) or IGHV3-7 (5005) sequences. Clones were identified by individual cells utilizing the same V and J segment, equal CDR3 length and at least 90% CDR3 sequence similarity. Table S1 contain the V, (D), and J gene call as well as the CDR3 sequence and somatic mutations of paired heavy and light chains for every cell.
Two target enrichment libraries (Roche NimbleGen) were designed by identifying genes found recurrently mutated in Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, CLL and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), as listed in Table S2 . For each gene, genome coordinates of their corresponding exons were obtained from the GRCh38 primary assembly. Panel 1.0 used for patient SS2 targeted 153 genes and ∼937 kb while panel 1.1 used for patients MN, SF and 5005 targeted an additional 25 genes and a total of ∼1,430 kb. Design of probes from target regions and synthesis was performed by Roche NimbleGen using the SeqCap EZ format with a maximum of five matches to the human genome.
For targeted capture the quality of MDA efficiency from each single cell was first assessed with 3-5 individual PCR reactions of different chromosomal regions, using primer sequences from ( Leung et al., 2016 46. Leung, M.L. ∙ Wang, Y. ∙ Kim, C. ... Highly multiplexed targeted DNA sequencing from single nuclei Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 :214-235 Crossref Scopus (41) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PCR with Taq polymerase kit (Invitrogen) and the following conditions: 95°C for 3 min; [95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 15 s, 72°C for 1 min] x 35 cycles; 72°C for 5 min. Only single cell samples that contained more than 30% PCR amplicons among all PCR reactions were selected for targeted capture. 1 μg of amplified DNA was used for Illumina library preparation with the KAPA Hyper Plus Kit (Roche) with 9 cycles of PCR. Targeted capture was performed using the previously described protocol ( Mercer et al., 2014 53. Mercer, T.R. ∙ Clark, M.B. ∙ Crawford, J. ... Targeted sequencing for gene discovery and quantification using RNA CaptureSeq Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :989-1009 Crossref Scopus (126) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the following modifications. Two rounds of hybridization were performed for 24 h each at 47°C. Following each round of hybridization and capture, PCR was performed using KAPA HiFI HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) with the following PCR cycling conditions: 98°C for 3 min; 98°C for 20 s, 65°C for 15 s, 72°C for 30 s 5 cycles (first round) or 20 cycles (second round); 72°C for 1min. Enrichment of post-capture libraries was measured using qPCR and sequencing performed on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 150bp paired end reads to a depth of ∼10 million reads per cell. For patient SS2 a total of 36 single cells (18 normal and 18 rogue) and 4 pools of 50 cells (2 normal and 2 rogue were sequenced. A total of 46 single cells for patient MN (14 normal and 32 rogue), 47 single cells for patient SF (16 normal and 31 rogue) and 46 single cells for patient 5005 (22 normal and 24 rogue) were sequenced along with a pool of 50 CD3 + T cells for each of these three patients.
Somatic mutations between rogue and normal memory B cells were determined using DeepSNVMiner ( Andrews et al., 2016 1. Andrews, T.D. ∙ Jeelall, Y. ∙ Talaulikar, D. ... DeepSNVMiner: a sequence analysis tool to detect emergent, rare mutations in subsets of cell populations PeerJ. 2016; 4 :e2074 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) in combination with a modified version of an existing pipeline ( Field et al., 2015 21. Field, M.A. ∙ Cho, V. ∙ Andrews, T.D. ... Reliably Detecting Clinically Important Variants Requires Both Combined Variant Calls and Optimized Filtering Strategies PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0143199 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ) optimized for rare somatic variant detection. For all four patients, somatic mutations were called if a variant was present in two or more rogue cells and reference in two or more normal cells. A quality score filter of > 5000 was applied for each variant and variants that did not map to genes on the capture panel were discarded. Table S4 shows the somatic variants found in rogue cells for each patient using this strategy. For patient SS2, a maximum of 2/18 rogue cells contained a somatic variant. To confirm these mutations, each variant was compared to variants called independently between two sets of rogue (G6 + ) and normal (G6 - ) pools of 50 cells. True somatic variants in the rogue single cells were accepted only if present in > 10% of reads in both rogue G6 + pools and < 1% of reads in both normal G6 - pools. Only the KLHL6 p.Leu90Pro mutation met these criteria, and was validated by Sanger sequencing ( Figures S5 A and S5B). In patients MN, SF and 5005, validated somatic variants were found in greater than 10 cells, obviating the need for additional filtering on cell pools. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutations in CARD11 , KLHL6 , CCND3 , BTG2 , all three ID3 mutations, and the frameshift and splice site TNFAIP3 mutation.
The mean number of reads per nucleotide and the number of nucleotides with a read count greater than 1 or 15 within the capture panel were determined for each sample using BEDTools ( Quinlan and Hall, 2010 63. Quinlan, A.R. ∙ Hall, I.M. BEDTools: a flexible suite of utilities for comparing genomic features Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :841-842 Crossref Scopus (14497) PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S3 ). A read count of 15 or greater for a given nucleotide position was considered sufficient to detect a heterozygous mutation. Single cells across all patients had an average of 90.4% and 75.4% on-target nucleotides with > 1 read or > 15 reads, respectively.
A current limitation of whole-genome amplification for single cell gDNA sequencing is “allele dropout” where only one of the two alleles of any given gene is represented in the amplified DNA. The REPLI-g Single Cell Kit (QIAGEN) has a reported allelic dropout rate of ∼60% ( Estevez-Gomez et al., 2018 20. Estevez-Gomez, N. ∙ Prieto, T. ∙ Guillaumet-Adkins, A. ... Comparison of single-cell whole-genome amplification strategies bioRxiv. 2018; Crossref Google Scholar ) leading to false-negative variant calls. We estimated the allelic drop-out rate in our single cell data by analyzing germline heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a pool of 50 CD3 + T cells sorted in parallel from each patient (except for patient SS2). Allelic drop-out was determined for each single cell by the percentage of wild-type and homozygous variants that are heterozygous in the corresponding bulk sample. Single cells across all patients had on average an estimated allelic dropout rate of 50.7% ( Table S4 ).
To distinguish allelic dropout from genuine absence of the mutation, we took advantage of MDA amplifying fragments of mean length > 10kb ( Dean et al., 2002 16. Dean, F.B. ∙ Hosono, S. ∙ Fang, L. ... Comprehensive human genome amplification using multiple displacement amplification Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :5261-5266 Crossref Scopus (1156) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the presence of a SNP within 5kb from the mutation that tagged which alleles were amplified in each cell. “TAG” SNPs could be identified for the KLHL6 p.Leu90Pro, CCND3 p.Thr283Ala and both TNFAIP3 mutations ( Figures S4 C, S4H, S5 G and S5H).
Sanger sequencing was performed on PCR products generated from amplified gDNA from MDA reactions to validate the variants called. gDNA was diluted 1/100 and amplified using primers outlined in Table S5 and the Taq polymerase kit (Invitrogen) with the following conditions: 95°C for 3 min; [95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 15 s, 72°C for 1 min] x 35 cycles; 72°C for 5 min. Positive PCR products were Sanger sequenced by the Garvan Molecular Genetics facility (Garvan Institute, Australia).
The identified human CARD11 mutations were introduced into corresponding mouse Card11 sequence using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The coding sequences for Card11 and its variants were fused with the mutant ecDHFR sequence (kindly provided from Dr Wandless, Stanford university) in mammalain expression vector pcDNA3.1+ ( Iwamoto et al., 2010 31. Iwamoto, M. ∙ Björklund, T. ∙ Lundberg, C. ... A general chemical method to regulate protein stability in the mammalian central nervous system Chem. Biol. 2010; 17 :981-988 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for ecDHFR-CARD11 mutants and reporter plasmids expressing firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase under NF-κB and thymidine kinase promoters, respectively (pGL4.32 and pGL4.74 from Promega). The expression of CARD11 variants was induced by the addition of 10 μM trimethoprim (TMP). The transfected cells were lysed 5 hr after TMP addition, and luciferase activity was measured with Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay (Promega). Western blot analysis of the same lysates confirmed comparable expression of CARD11 proteins. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity, and NF-κB activity was calculated as the average of triplicates.
cDNAs encoding Flag-tagged wild-type, Leu90Pro or Tyr96Cys mutant human KLHL6 were synthesized by GenScript in the pcDNA3.1+ expression vector. HEK293T cells were plated at 0.5 × 10 6 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) overnight at 37°C. The cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of DNA plasmid using lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher) and incubated for 48 h at 37°C. For the cycloheximide assay, transfected cells were treated with 100 μg ml -1 of cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) for the indicated times. Transfected HEK293T cells were washed with PBS and lysed by the addition of (50 mM Tris-HCl ph 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 0.5% NP-40, plus protease inhibitors) for 15 min on ice. For immunoprecipitation of KLHL6, transfected cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (F3165, Sigma) and 20 μL of protein G Sepharose beads (prewashed and resuspended in lysis buffer). The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer. Immunoblotting was performed by adding NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (ThermoFisher) was added to each sample prior to running on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transfer onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) and incubated with anti-KLHL6 antibody (Sigma, SAB2501514), anti-cullin3 (Bethyl Laboratories, A301-109A) or anti-beta-actin antibody (Sigma, A2228) at 1:1000 dilution followed by incubation with anti-goat and anti-mouse secondary antibodies (LI-COR) at 1:20,000 dilution. Bands were detected using the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR Biosceinces) and quantified using ImageStudio software (LI-COR Biosciences).
HEL-binding B cells were obtained from Klhl6 WT/L88P Ptprc a/b (CD45.1/CD45.2) and wild-type Ptprc a/a (CD45.1) donors. HEL 3X protein was covalently conjugated to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) with 1-ethyl-3-(3-demethylaminopropyl) carbodimide hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) ( Paus et al., 2006 56. Paus, D. ∙ Phan, T.G. ∙ Chan, T.D. ... Antigen recognition strength regulates the choice between extrafollicular plasma cell and germinal center B cell differentiation J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203 :1081-1091 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ). Spleen cell mixtures comprising 3x10 4 HEL-binding B cells (50:50 Klhl6 mutant and wild-type) and 2x10 8 HEL 3X -SRBC were injected into the tail vein of recipient C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice. Spleen cell suspensions from recipient mice were analyzed 29 days after transfer and immunisation. CD45.1 wild-type SW HEL and CD45.1/CD45.2 Klhl6 mutant SW HEL GC B cells (B220 + , CD38 - , CD95 + ) from each recipient mouse were separately single cell sorted into 96-well plates using a FACSAriaIII (BD). To analyze a memory B cell response, HEL WT -SRBC with either 3x10 4 Klhl6 mutant SW HEL B cells or Klhl6 wild-type SW HEL B cells were injected into recipient C57BL/6 (CD45.2) mice. After 29 days, splenic CD45.1 wild-type SW HEL and CD45.1/CD45.2 Klhl6 mutant SW HEL memory B cells (B220 + ,CD38 high , CD95 low ) from each recipient mouse were separately single cell sorted. The VDJ H exon of each SW HEL cell was amplified from gDNA by PCR, sequenced and analyzed as previously described ( Chan et al., 2012 10. Chan, T.D. ∙ Wood, K. ∙ Hermes, J.R. ... Elimination of germinal-center-derived self-reactive B cells is governed by the location and concentration of self-antigen Immunity. 2012; 37 :893-904 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ).
IGHV1-69 , IGKV3-20 and JH4 are used in 5%, 16% and 50% of normal B cells, respectively ( Tiller et al., 2013 78. Tiller, T. ∙ Schuster, I. ∙ Deppe, D. ... A fully synthetic human Fab antibody library based on fixed VH/VL framework pairings with favorable biophysical properties MAbs. 2013; 5 :445-470 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ), while HCDR3 lengths of 12-15 amino acids occur in 8% of unselected VDJ joins ( Larimore et al., 2012 43. Larimore, K. ∙ McCormick, M.W. ∙ Robins, H.S. ... Shaping of human germline IgH repertoires revealed by deep sequencing J. Immunol. 2012; 189 :3221-3230 Crossref Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ), so that the combination is expected in 0.03% of newly formed B cells.
Per-cell tallies of silent and replacement mutations were modeled as predictors of subclonal branch via Poisson regression. P- values representing marginal coefficients for first-order effects were obtained from these models.
