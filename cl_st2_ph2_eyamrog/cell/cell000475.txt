Title: Compromised nuclear envelope integrity drives TREX1-dependent DNA damage and tumor cell invasion


Abstract: Summary

Although mutations leading to a compromised nuclear envelope cause diseases such as muscular dystrophies or accelerated aging, the consequences of mechanically induced nuclear envelope ruptures are less known. Here, we show that nuclear envelope ruptures induce DNA damage that promotes senescence in non-transformed cells and induces an invasive phenotype in human breast cancer cells. We find that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated exonuclease TREX1 translocates into the nucleus after nuclear envelope rupture and is required to induce DNA damage. Inside the mammary duct, cellular crowding leads to nuclear envelope ruptures that generate TREX1-dependent DNA damage, thereby driving the progression of in situ carcinoma to the invasive stage. DNA damage and nuclear envelope rupture markers were also enriched at the invasive edge of human tumors. We propose that DNA damage in mechanically challenged nuclei could affect the pathophysiology of crowded tissues by modulating proliferation and extracellular matrix degradation of normal and transformed cells.

Section: Introduction

In tissues, extracellular matrix fibers and cell packing limit the available space. Migrating and proliferating cells thus often face situations of crowding and confinement, which can result in strong cell and nucleus deformations. We and others showed that, in the case of migrating immune and cancer cells, strong nuclear deformation can result in transient events of nuclear envelope (NE) rupture with subsequent DNA damage ( Denais et al., 2016 9.

In this context, efficient repair responses are essential to ensure cell viability, which involve ESCRT proteins restoring NE integrity, as well as BAF1 and the DNA repair pathways ( Lusk and Ader, 2020 34.

NE ruptures can be induced by simply confining cells between two plates, independently of their migratory behavior ( Le Berre et al., 2012 26. Le Berre, M. ∙ Aubertin, J. ∙ Piel, M.

Recent studies showed that NE rupture events also occur in vivo , for example in muscle tissues that are highly solicited mechanically but also in the heart of developing embryos, due to stiffening and beating of the tissue ( Cho et al., 2019 6.

In these tissues, NE ruptures are associated with senescence and aging phenomena that affect cell proliferation, survival, and ultimately tissue function. NE ruptures are often accompanied by DNA damage ( Cho et al., 2019 6. Cho, S. ∙ Vashisth, M. ∙ Abbas, A. ...

ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mechanisms leading to senescence and DNA damage upon NE rupture are unclear. Here, we investigated the consequences of nuclear deformation and rupture associated with cell migration in crowded tissues, focusing on mammary carcinoma. These tumors, which grow confined inside the mammary ducts, have been shown to display large strands of collectively moving cells associated with the transition from in situ to the invasive stage of the tumor development ( Palamidessi et al., 2019 44.

Additionally, the breast neoplastic invasive switch requires the activity of matrix proteases for breaching out of the duct ( Feinberg et al., 2018 12. Feinberg, T.Y. ∙ Zheng, H. ∙ Liu, R. ...

Section: Results

We first investigated human samples of breast ductal adenocarcinoma in situ with microinvasion stained by immunohistochemistry for the small GTPase RAB5A (involved in recycling of cell/cell adhesions) used as a marker for strands of motile cells ( Malinverno et al., 2017 38. Malinverno, C. ∙ Corallino, S. ∙ Giavazzi, F. ... Endocytic reawakening of motility in jammed epithelia Nat. Mater. 2017; 16 :587-596 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the DNA damage marker phospho-γH2AX. We observed that tumor regions positive for RAB5A, often corresponding to micro-invasive foci ( STAR Methods ; Kim et al., 2018 24. Kim, M. ∙ Kim, H.J. ∙ Chung, Y.R. ... Microinvasive carcinoma versus ductal carcinoma in situ: A comparison of clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes J. Breast Cancer. 2018; 21 :197-205 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ), displayed a larger number of deformed and elongated nuclei ( Figures 1 A–1E). This morphology corresponds to cells squeezing each other as they move ( Friedl and Gilmour, 2009 14. Friedl, P. ∙ Gilmour, D. Collective cell migration in morphogenesis, regeneration and cancer Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10 :445-457 Crossref Scopus (1919) PubMed Google Scholar ; Palamidessi et al., 2019 44. Palamidessi, A. ∙ Malinverno, C. ∙ Frittoli, E. ... Unjamming overcomes kinetic and proliferation arrest in terminally differentiated cells and promotes collective motility of carcinoma Nat. Mater. 2019; 18 :1252-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nuclei positive for γH2AX were more abundant in invasive foci than in the tumor bulk ( Figure 1 D), and within invasive foci, γH2AX-positive nuclei were more often found in cells with higher RAB5A expression (presumably more migratory) ( Palamidessi et al., 2019 44. Palamidessi, A. ∙ Malinverno, C. ∙ Frittoli, E. ... Unjamming overcomes kinetic and proliferation arrest in terminally differentiated cells and promotes collective motility of carcinoma Nat. Mater. 2019; 18 :1252-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 1 E). This suggests that strands of motile cells at the periphery of the tumor exhibit pronounced nuclear deformation associated with elevated DNA damage.
We then investigated a xenograft mouse model based on the intraductal (intra-nipple) injection of transformed human breast cancer MCF10DCIS.com (DCIS hereafter) cells, which are derived from the non-tumorigenic breast epithelial MCF10A cell line. This model recapitulates the transition from in situ to invasive stages of breast cancer progression ( Behbod et al., 2009 2. Behbod, F. ∙ Kittrell, F.S. ∙ LaMarca, H. ... An intraductal human-in-mouse transplantation model mimics the subtypes of ductal carcinoma in situ Breast Cancer Res. 2009; 11 :R66 Crossref Scopus (179) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lodillinsky et al., 2016 33. Lodillinsky, C. ∙ Infante, E. ∙ Guichard, A. ... p63/MT1-MMP axis is required for in situ to invasive transition in basal-like breast cancer Oncogene. 2016; 35 :344-357 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). In situ tumors are characterized by a myoepithelial layer (stained with smooth muscle actin) surrounding human xenografted cells (identified by a human-specific KU70 antibody) ( Figure 1 F). Tumor sections were stained with γH2AX ( Figures 1 F and 1G). Advanced tumors (classified based on the state of the myoepithelial layer) displayed more γH2AX-positive nuclei ( Figure 1 F). Deformed nuclei were mostly found at the periphery of the tumor mass, especially in ducts inflated with large tumors, and enriched in micro-invasive foci ( Figure 1 G). Most of the γH2AX-positive nuclei did not correspond to mitotic nor apoptotic figures ( Figure S1 A), which were excluded from the analysis. We performed an automated analysis of all human nuclei in the tumor regarding their level of γH2AX staining, as a function of their distance to the tumor edge ( Figure S1 A for the method). This analysis showed enrichment for nuclei with an elevated γH2AX staining ( Z score above 2) and even more for nuclei with a very high staining ( Z score above 5) in the region closer to the tumor edge ( Figures 1 H and S1 B). Together, these data show that the periphery of mammary in situ carcinomatous lesions, both in human and in xenografted mice, often display strongly deformed nuclei with elevated levels of DNA damage. This raises the possibility that NE ruptures could be implicated in the induction of the DNA damage, as suggested by previous work on migrating cells ( Denais et al., 2016 9. Denais, C.M. ∙ Gilbert, R.M. ∙ Isermann, P. ... Nuclear envelope rupture and repair during cancer cell migration Science. 2016; 352 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Because NE ruptures of deformed nuclei were difficult to investigate in tumor samples, we developed a “duct-on-chip” microfluidic assay (inspired by Blaha et al. [2017 4. Blaha, L. ∙ Zhang, C. ∙ Cabodi, M. ... A microfluidic platform for modeling metastatic cancer cell matrix invasion Biofabrication. 2017; 9 :045001 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ]). The assay consists of three large 50-μm high channels: a lateral channel filled with culture medium, a central one with DCIS cells, and the third channel with a dense fluorescently labeled type I collagen fibrillar matrix. The channels are connected by regularly spaced V-shape gates, 10 μm-wide in their smaller section, through which cells can migrate toward the collagen-filled chamber ( Figures 1 I and S1 C). Cells invaded efficiently the collagen chamber ( Figure 1 I), and visualization of the collagen network suggested that they were able to remodel the collagen fibers over time ( Figure 1 I). Using a pan inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), GM6001, we confirmed that collagen degradation by DCIS cells was required for invasion into the collagen chamber ( Figures S1 D and S1E), similar to what we had previously observed in vivo ( Lodillinsky et al., 2016 33. Lodillinsky, C. ∙ Infante, E. ∙ Guichard, A. ... p63/MT1-MMP axis is required for in situ to invasive transition in basal-like breast cancer Oncogene. 2016; 35 :344-357 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). DCIS cells expressing catalytically inactive cGAS-mCherry (icGAS hereafter) to detect NE ruptures ( Gentili et al., 2019 15. Gentili, M. ∙ Lahaye, X. ∙ Nadalin, F. ... The N-Terminal Domain of cGAS Determines Preferential Association with Centromeric DNA and Innate Immune Activation in the Nucleus Cell Rep. 2019; 26 :2377-2393.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ) and 53BP1-GFP to detect DNA double-strand break (DSB) foci were grown in the device. The average cell density increased by 50% from 24 h to 48 h after cell loading ( Figure 1 I). The device was loaded either with a low or a high density of cells ( Figures S1 F–S1H), so that, after 48 h, the low-seeding density would remain below the initial high-seeding density. We then quantified the shape of nuclei, the number of 53BP1-GFP foci, and the fraction of nuclei showing icGAS-mCherry peripheral accumulation, characteristic of NE rupture events ( Figure S1 H; Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). 48 h after seeding at high density, but not at low density, nuclear roundness decreased, indicating that nuclei were getting confined and deformed ( Figure 1 J), and the fraction of nuclei with NE ruptures and elevated 53BP1 foci (>3) increased ( Figures 1 K and 1L). DCIS cells remained motile even at high density ( Video S1 ; Malinverno et al., 2017 38. Malinverno, C. ∙ Corallino, S. ∙ Giavazzi, F. ... Endocytic reawakening of motility in jammed epithelia Nat. Mater. 2017; 16 :587-596 Crossref Scopus (167) PubMed Google Scholar ; Palamidessi et al., 2019 44. Palamidessi, A. ∙ Malinverno, C. ∙ Frittoli, E. ... Unjamming overcomes kinetic and proliferation arrest in terminally differentiated cells and promotes collective motility of carcinoma Nat. Mater. 2019; 18 :1252-1263 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). This suggests that, similarly to what was observed for single migrating cells in a dense tissue ( Denais et al., 2016 9. Denais, C.M. ∙ Gilbert, R.M. ∙ Isermann, P. ... Nuclear envelope rupture and repair during cancer cell migration Science. 2016; 352 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raab et al., 2016 46.

ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ), the motility of DCIS cells in a crowded multicellular context can lead to nuclear deformation, NE rupture, and DNA damage.

DCIS cells moving inside the duct on a chip device, related to Figure 1 DCIS cells stably expressing 53BP1-mCherry were injected in the duct on chip and imaged using spinning disc microscopy (20x magnification).
To examine the link between nuclear deformation, NE rupture, and DNA damage, we used a 2D confiner device that allows precise deformation of cells (and nuclei) between two parallel plates ( Le Berre et al., 2014 27. Le Berre, M. ∙ Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz, E. ∙ Bonazzi, D. ... Methods for Two-Dimensional Cell Confinement Methods Cell Biol. 2014; 121 :213-229 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition to DCIS cells, we analyzed the non-tumorigenic cell lines RPE1 (normal human hTERT immortalized cells) in which we have previously characterized NE ruptures and DNA damage in migration assays ( Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ) and MCF10A expressing icGAS-mCherry and 53BP1-GFP ( Figure 2 A). We found a sharp increase in the fraction of RPE1 cells with ruptured nuclei below 3 μm confinement ( Figures S2 A and S2B), confirming our previous observations on another panel of cell types ( Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). To assess the relationship between NE rupture and DNA damage, we analyzed the number of 53BP1-GFP foci in nuclei of cells confined at various heights and displaying or not displaying NE ruptures ( Figure S2 A). Foci were counted at each time point using a semi-automated process ( Figure S2 C; STAR Methods ). We found that, similarly to cells migrating through constrictions ( Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ), only cells with ruptured NE displayed increased number of 53BP1 foci ( Figures 2 B–2D for RPE1 and Figure S2 D for DCIS and MCF10A). Almost all cells with NE rupture (>98%) displayed more than three 53BP1 foci ( Figures 2 E and 2F), whereas only a small fraction of cells without NE rupture (<2%) had this number of foci over the course of the video ( Figure 2 E). Analysis of the intensity of foci and of the background ( Figure S2 E) showed that 53BP1 accumulated in an increasing number of foci in nuclei with NE ruptures. Cells exhibiting NE ruptures were also positive for other markers of DNA damage, such as RIF1 and γH2AX ( Figures S2 F and S2G). Additionally, the number of 53BP1 foci per nucleus did not depend on the cell cycle ( Figure S2 H). Collectively, these results indicate that confinement-induced DNA damage was preceded by NE rupture events in a variety of cells, including RPE1 (in accordance with other reports) ( Raab et al., 2016 46. Raab, M. ∙ Gentili, M. ∙ de Belly, H. ... ESCRT III repairs nuclear envelope ruptures during cell migration to limit DNA damage and cell death Science. 2016; 352 :359-362 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shah et al., 2021 50. Shah, P. ∙ Hobson, C.M. ∙ Cheng, S. ... Nuclear Deformation Causes DNA Damage by Increasing Replication Stress Curr. Biol. 2021; 31 :753-765.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ), MCF10A, and DCIS cells.
In cells displaying NE ruptures, the number of 53BP1 foci remained high throughout the confinement period ( Figures 2 C and S2 D) and was associated with a majority of cells showing repeated cycles of NE blebbing, rupture, and repair over the entire duration of confinement, in contrast to cells confined at 4 μm ( Video S2 ). These resuls suggest that the occurrence of DNA damage associated with deformed nuclei in the human tumor samples could correspond to repeat NE ruptures.

RPE1 cells confined at 4 μm and 2 μm, related to Figure 2 RPE1 cells stably expressing 53BP1-EGFP and catalytically inactive cGAS-mCherry were confined at 4 (first part of the movie) and 2 μm (second part of the movie) and imaged under 40x magnification using spinning disc microscopy. Cells confined at 4 μm exhibit no NE rupture and cGAS remains cytoplasmic while 53BP1 distribution remains homogeneous inside the nucleus. At 2 μm, sequential nuclear blebbing events are observed, leading to formation of cGAS clusters at the periphery of the nucleus (at the site of blebbing) and accumulation of 53BP1 in multiple foci (DNA damage) in the nucleus.
Previous work suggested that NE rupture might lead to DNA repair proteins leaking out of the nucleus ( Irianto et al., 2017 21. Irianto, J. ∙ Xia, Y. ∙ Pfeifer, C.R. ... DNA Damage Follows Repair Factor Depletion and Portends Genome Variation in Cancer Cells after Pore Migration Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :210-223 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (191) PubMed Google Scholar ). Some cytoplasmic factor(s) might also enter the nucleus and access nuclear DNA, causing DNA damage ( Maciejowski et al., 2015 35. Maciejowski, J. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Bosco, N. ... Chromothripsis and Kataegis Induced by Telomere Crisis Cell. 2015; 163 :1641-1654 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar , 2019 36. Maciejowski, J. ∙ Chatzipli, A. ∙ Dananberg, A. ... APOBEC3B-dependent kataegis and TREX1-driven chromothripsis in telomere crisis bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Shah et al., 2017 49. Shah, P. ∙ Wolf, K. ∙ Lammerding, J. Bursting the Bubble - Nuclear Envelope Rupture as a Path to Genomic Instability? Trends Cell Biol. 2017; 27 :546-555 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ). Live recording of 53BP1-GFP showed the expected dynamic appearance and disappearance of single foci, indicative of DNA damage and repair events ( Figure 2 G; Video S2 ). We found that the frequency of appearance of new foci was significantly higher in cells with NE rupture in comparison with cells without NE rupture, reaching rates comparable to etoposide-treated cells ( Figure 2 H). Moreover, the number of new foci typically increased after a rupture event ( Figures S2 I and S2J), suggesting a causal relationship between NE rupture and new DNA damage. On the contrary, lifetime of the foci showed no difference between cells with or without NE ruptures ( Figure 2 I). Overall, these experiments suggest that DNA damage associated with NE ruptures is mostly due to the generation of new DNA damage following NE rupture events rather than to delayed repair.
To investigate whether DNA damage was solely associated to NE rupture events or whether cell and nuclear confinement were also required, we recorded non-confined cells plated on a glass coverslip. In these conditions, although very rare, spontaneous NE rupture events could be observed. Such events displayed a similar signature in terms of icGAS accumulation at a local site on the nuclear periphery and leakage of 53BP1-GFP staining in the cytoplasm before re-import into the nucleus ( Figure 2 J; Video S3 ). Each NE rupture event was followed, within 1–2 h, by an increase in the number of 53BP1-GFP foci in the nucleus ( Figures 2 J–2L). To investigate a larger population of cells, we fixed the cells and counted the number of foci using 53BP1-GFP ( Figure 2 M, left) or γH2AX staining ( Figure 2 M, right) in cells with or without NE rupture (assessed by the presence of an icGAS perinuclear accumulation). The increase in the number of foci appeared similar to the one observed after confinement-induced NE ruptures. Together, these experiments indicate that DNA damage follows NE rupture events even in the absence of confinement.

Examples of non-confined RPE1 cells with spontaneous NE rupture and subsequent DNA damage, related to Figure 2 RPE1 cells stably expressing 53BP1-EGFP and catalytically inactive cGAS-mCherry were seeded on a glass bottom dish and imaged under 40x magnification using wide field fluorescence microscopy.
NE ruptures at persistent post-mitotic chromatin bridges have been shown to cause DNA damage, which was reduced upon depletion of TREX1, a cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated exonuclease ( Maciejowski et al., 2015 35. Maciejowski, J. ∙ Li, Y. ∙ Bosco, N. ... Chromothripsis and Kataegis Induced by Telomere Crisis Cell. 2015; 163 :1641-1654 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (444) PubMed Google Scholar ). We silenced TREX1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown, or permanently knocked it out by CRISPR-Cas9 technology (in RPE1 and DCIS cells) ( Figures S3 A and S3B). We found that upon TREX1 depletion in the three cell lines (RPE1, MCF10A, and DCIS), NE ruptures were no longer accompanied by an increase in 53BP1 foci ( Figures 3 A, 3B, S3 C and S3D, quantified by an independent method in S3 E). TREX1 depletion also prevented the occurrence of DNA damage upon spontaneous NE rupture events in RPE1 cells ( Figures 3 C, S4 A, and S4B). 53BP1 foci mean intensity ( Figure S3 F), the generation of foci upon etoposide treatment ( Figure S3 G), and NE rupture frequency ( Figure S3 H) were not affected. WT TREX1, but not a catalytically deficient mutant (TREX1-D18N) ( Lehtinen et al., 2008 30. Lehtinen, D.A. ∙ Harvey, S. ∙ Mulcahy, M.J. ... The TREX1 double-stranded DNA degradation activity is defective in dominant mutations associated with autoimmune disease J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :31649-31656 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ), increased the number of foci in cells with NE ruptures ( Figures 3 A and 3B). These experiments unambiguously demonstrate a role for TREX1 in promoting DNA damage upon NE rupture events in this panel of cell lines.
To determine how TREX1 gains access to nuclear DNA upon NE rupture events, we imaged TREX1-GFP expressing cells. In non-confined cells, TREX1-GFP was mostly bound to endomembranes and excluded from the nucleoplasm. Upon confinement, TREX1-GFP foci were also found inside the nucleus ( Figure S3 I; Video S4 ). Immunoelectron microscopy using gold immunolabeling against mCherry on RPE1 TREX1 knockout (KO) cells reconstituted with TREX1-mCherry showed that, in non-confined cells, gold particles were found at ER membranes distributed throughout the cytosol, co-localizing with the ER-resident enzyme, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) ( Figures 3 D and S4 C). PDI and TREX1 staining were increased inside the nucleus in 2-μm confined cells ( Figures 3 D 3E, and S4 C). TREX1 was particularly enriched at the inner nuclear membrane of confined cells ( Figure S4 C; Tables S1 and S2 ; Mayhew, 2011 40. Mayhew, T.M. Mapping the distributions and quantifying the labelling intensities of cell compartments by immunoelectron microscopy: progress towards a coherent set of methods J. Anat. 2011; 219 :647-660 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). When localized inside the nucleus, TREX1-mCherry appeared associated to ER-like membranes together with PDI ( Figure 3 D). The presence of such intranuclear ER-like membranes was almost never observed in non-confined cells. These experiments suggest that, upon strong confinement at heights at which cells undergo NE rupture events, TREX1 relocalizes, along with other ER-bound proteins like PDI, from cytosolic ER to the inner side of the nuclear membrane and the inside of the nucleus, mostly bound to membranes.

TREX1 nuclear localization upon confinement, related to Figure 3 RPE1 cells were transiently transfected with TREX1-EGFP and 1μm thickness Z slices were acquired before and after 2 μm confinement. Cells were imaged under 40x magnification using spinning disc microscopy.
Because TREX1 is an ER membrane protein and based on the immunoelectron microscopy results, we hypothesized that TREX1 might access the chromatin by diffusion from the ER membrane to connected intra-nuclear membranes ( Ungricht and Kutay, 2015 57. Ungricht, R. ∙ Kutay, U. Establishment of NE asymmetry—targeting of membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2015; 34 :135-141 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, although WT TREX1 fully rescued the level of DNA damage induced by NE rupture in TREX1 KO DCIS cells, the DeltaC construct, lacking the C-terminal ER-binding site of the protein, failed to do so ( Figures S3 J and S3K). A construct in which the C terminus of the protein was replaced by the ER binding site of Sec61 ( Mohr et al., 2021 42. Mohr, L. ∙ Toufektchan, E. ∙ von Morgen, P. ... ER-directed TREX1 limits cGAS activation at micronuclei Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 :724-738.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ) was able to partially rescue the level of DNA damage induced by confinement in TREX1 KO DCIS cells ( Figures S3 J and S3K), similarly to what was observed in micro-nuclei ( Mohr et al., 2021 42. Mohr, L. ∙ Toufektchan, E. ∙ von Morgen, P. ... ER-directed TREX1 limits cGAS activation at micronuclei Mol. Cell. 2021; 81 :724-738.e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these experiments suggest that upon NE rupture events, ER-bound TREX1 gains access to the interior of the nucleus causing DNA damage.
Having established a mechanism of DNA damage generation after NE rupture, we next sought to examine the functional consequences of this damage. In non-transformed cells, chronic exposure to DNA damage-inducing factors is associated with cellular senescence. RPE1 and MCF10A cells showed a very clear induction of senescence upon treatment with etoposide and doxorubicin (hereafter referred to as doxo) as verified by senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (β-gal)-positive staining. However, senescence was less pronounced in the tumorigenic DCIS cells ( Figure S5 A). During confinement, even for long confinement periods, most of the cells did not undergo mitosis nor showed any sign of death ( Figures S5 B and S5C). Following confinement, cells were harvested and replated in order to track single cells that had ruptured their NE or not based on icGAS perinuclear staining/distribution ( Figure S5 D). After a short period of confinement (2 h), de-confined cells resumed proliferation with an almost normal cell-cycle duration ( Figure 4 A) (mean cell-cycle duration for non-confined cells: 14.66 h ± 2.31), regardless of their NE status. In contrast, after a long period (12 h), cells that displayed NE ruptures, while showing no sign of death, did not resume proliferation ( Figure 4 A, right panel) whereas the few dividing cells showed a much longer cell-cycle duration ( Figure 4 A). These results suggest that NE rupture and sustained confinement delay cell-cycle progression.
To characterize the senescence phenotype associated with strong confinement, RPE1 cells were confined for short or long periods of time, under weak (4 μm) or strong (2 μm) confinement, then harvested and replated for 96 h before testing a panel of senescence markers (β-gal positivity, heterochromatin foci-HP1γ staining, western blot for lamin B1 and p21) ( Gorgoulis et al., 2019 16. Gorgoulis, V. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Alimonti, A. ... Cellular Senescence: Defining a Path Forward Cell. 2019; 179 :813-827 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1449) PubMed Google Scholar ). All these markers consistently showed that although short-term or weak (4 μm) confinement did not induce senescence, long-term, strong confinement, induced a robust senescence phenotype in both RPE1 and MCF10A, but not in DCIS cells ( Figures 4 B–4G and S5 E–S5G). TREX1-depleted and TREX1 KO RPE1 cells showed no sign of senescence even after strong and prolonged confinement ( Figures 4 B, 4C, 4E–4G, and S5 E) and expression of TREX1 WT in TREX1 KO cells rescued the induction of p21 by strong confinement in RPE1 cells ( Figure 4 E). The senescence phenotype was not dependent on the activation of the canonical cGAS pathway ( Gorgoulis et al., 2019 16. Gorgoulis, V. ∙ Adams, P.D. ∙ Alimonti, A. ... Cellular Senescence: Defining a Path Forward Cell. 2019; 179 :813-827 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1449) PubMed Google Scholar ) because RPE1 cells do not express cGAS ( Figure S5 H; Basit et al., 2020 1. Basit, A. ∙ Cho, M.G. ∙ Kim, E.Y. ... The cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immunity pathway maintains chromosomal stability through regulation of p21 levels Exp. Mol. Med. 2020; 52 :643-657 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ) and did not show any sign of cGAS enzymatic activity in response to transfected DNA ( Figure S5 I). Together, these results show that TREX1-dependent chronic DNA damage induced upon strong confinement triggers the hallmarks of the senescence program in normal RPE1 and MCF10A cells but not in transformed DCIS cells.
To investigate the potential consequences of DNA damage associated with NE ruptures during the development of tumors produced by DCIS cells, we used the duct-on-chip assay described above. Both control- and TREX1-depleted cells reached high density within 48 h after injection in the device, showing that proliferation was not affected by TREX1 depletion. They also displayed comparable levels of NE ruptures ( Figure 5 A, right graph). After 24 h in the device, there was no appreciable difference in 53BP1 foci numbers between control- and TREX1-depleted cells ( Figure 5 A, left graph). In contrast, although this number significantly increased at 48 h for control cells, it remained constant in TREX1-depleted cells ( Figure 5 A, left graph). These results indicate that the increased 53BP1 foci levels observed at high density in the duct-on-chip system is a consequence of TREX1-dependent DNA damage following nuclear deformations and ruptures.
TREX1-depleted DCIS cells can thus grow at high density in the duct-on-chip device without showing an increase in DNA damage. We found that control cells invaded the collagen chamber earlier and migrated farther than TREX1-depleted cells ( Figure 5 B). This suggests that the increased invasive behavior of control cells might be due to elevated DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, differently labeled control and doxo-treated cells were mixed and injected in the duct-on-chip device. We observed that 24 h after loading the cells into the device (to ensure that cell density was still low), doxo-treated cells displayed increased invasion potential into the collagen chamber as compared to DMSO-treated cells ( Figure 5 C). These results indicate that sustained DNA damage can be a driver of the invasive behavior of DCIS cells in a 3D matrix environment. We thus assessed the collagen degradation activity of DCIS cells using an antibody that recognizes the collagenase-cleaved ¾ fragment of collagen I ( Castagnino et al., 2018 5. Castagnino, A. ∙ Castro-Castro, A. ∙ Irondelle, M. ...

Cells were either treated with doxo or confined for several hours and then were embedded in a 3D collagen gel in the absence of any further DNA damaging condition. Increasing doses of doxo caused a dose-dependent increase in collagen degradation ( Figure S6 A), suggesting that prior exposure to DNA damage enhances the collagen degradation capacity of DCIS cells. We then assayed cells after confinement. Once in the collagen gel, the nuclear area of the cells that had been confined at various heights was comparable ( Figure S6 B), showing no long-lasting nuclear deformation. TREX1-proficient cells that had been confined at 2-μm height, but not TREX1-deficient cells, showed a persistent, highly polarized morphology, increased speed in the collagen network ( Figures S6 C and quantified in S6 D; Video S5 ) and augmented collagen degradation ( Figures 5 D–5F). In agreement, overexpressing TREX1-WT augmented collagen degradation whereas TREX1-D18N did not ( Figure 5 E). Doxo treatment induced collagen degradation in TREX1-depleted cells ( Figure S6 E), confirming that TREX1 acts upstream of DNA damage to induce collagen degradation. Taken together, these experiments show that, upon strong confinement, TREX1-dependent DNA damage leads to an increase in collagen degradation by DCIS cells.

DCIS cells subjected to strong confinement exhibit exploratory behavior in 3D collagen, related to Figure 5 DCIS cells stably expressing life-actin-EGFP were confined at 10 μm or 2 μm for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested and embedded in a 3D collagen matrix for imaging under 40x magnification using spinning disc microscopy.
To further clarify how TREX1-mediated DNA damage induces collagen degradation, cells confined at 2-μm height were treated with the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, or with the ATM inhibitor KU-55933. Both treatments inhibited collagen degradation ( Figure 5 G). DNA damage during interphase might lead to cGAS activation and the establishment of an EMT-like phenotype ( Harding et al., 2017 17. Harding, S.M. ∙ Benci, J.L. ∙ Irianto, J. ... Mitotic progression following DNA damage enables pattern recognition within micronuclei Nature. 2017; 548 :466-470 Crossref Scopus (969) PubMed Google Scholar ). cGAS-depletion showed that, similarly to the senescence phenotype in RPE1 cells, the induction of collagen degradation upon confinement was not cGAS-dependent ( Figure S6 F). Increased cellular motility and invasion induced by prolonged DNA damage and ATM activation has been shown to promote a partial EMT state ( Peng et al., 2019 45. Peng, B. ∙ Ortega, J. ∙ Gu, L. ... Phosphorylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen promotes cancer progression by activating the ATM/Akt/GSK3β/Snail signaling pathway J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :7037-7045 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sun et al., 2012 54. Sun, M. ∙ Guo, X. ∙ Qian, X. ... Activation of the ATM-Snail pathway promotes breast cancer metastasis J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 4 :304-315 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ). We analyzed the mRNA expression level of a series of canonical EMT genes in cells confined at 10 μm (control) or 2 μm, comparing WT and TREX1 KO cells. We found that SNAIL1 mRNA was specifically upregulated by confinement at 2 μm, and such induction did not occur in two independent TREX1 KO clones ( Figure S6 G). In the absence of confinement, SNAIL1 was also induced by both doxo and etoposide with a peak at 4 h of treatment ( Figure S6 H). Moreover, SNAIL1 silencing abrogated the increase in collagen degradation promoted upon strong confinement ( Figure S6 I). Together, these results suggest that a partial EMT phenotype, including increased matrix degradation and invasive potential, is induced in DCIS cells due to prolonged/chronic exposure to DNA damage.
Putting these results in the context of our initial observations of nuclear deformation and DNA damage both in human breast ductal carcinoma and intraductal DCIS cell tumor xenografts ( Figure 1 ), we hypothesized that TREX1 is responsible for DNA damage in these deformed nuclei, favoring a collagen degradation program, ultimately promoting the in situ -to-invasive carcinoma transition. To directly test this hypothesis in an in vivo murine model, we injected either parental or TREX1 KO DCIS cells inside the mammary ducts of immuno-suppressed mice and allowed tumors to develop for 6–8 weeks. Both parental- and TREX1 KO-injected mice formed intraductal in situ tumors at a similar rate ( Figure S6 J). However, there was a sharp decrease in the tumor area of TREX1 KO-injected mice compared to parental-injected mice ( Figures S6 K and S6L). Strikingly, although all the mice injected with parental DCIS cells showed invasive tumors based on whole-mount carmine and histological staining within 6 weeks after injection, the formation of invasive tumors in TREX1 KO-injected mice was greatly reduced for up to 8 weeks ( Figures 6 A and 6B). This phenotype was comparable to the reduced invasive potential of membrane type I (MT1)-MMP (MMP14)-deficient DCIS cells that we previously reported using this model ( Lodillinsky et al., 2016 33. Lodillinsky, C. ∙ Infante, E. ∙ Guichard, A. ... p63/MT1-MMP axis is required for in situ to invasive transition in basal-like breast cancer Oncogene. 2016; 35 :344-357 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). The proliferation rates of parental DCIS and TREX1 KO clones were similar in vitro ( Figure S6 M). Additionally, analysis of parental and TREX1 KO tumor xenografts revealed no differences in the fraction of cells positive for the proliferation marker Ki67 ( Figure 6 C). Parental tumors displayed a significantly larger percentage of γH2AX-positive nuclei than TREX1 KO tumors ( Figures 6 C and 6D). The fraction of cells with high and very high Z scores (γH2AX intensity) was enriched at the tumor edge, and this was reduced in TREX1 KO tumors, but not in the tumor bulk ( Figures 6 E, 6F, and S6 N). Overall, these results suggest that the transition from in situ to the invasive stage is favored in WT cells by TREX1-dependent DNA damage occurring in deformed and ruptured nuclei as the tumor grows in the confined environment of the mammary ducts.
We also asked whether NE ruptures can be seen in the mice xenograft and in the human tumor. We first used a combination of lamin A/C, γH2AX, and DAPI staining and looked for chromatin herniations (i.e., interruptions of the lamin A/C staining with a protrusion of chromatin labeled by DAPI). We were able to find several of such instances in the intraductal tumor xenografts ( Figure 7 A), which correlated with nuclei positive for γH2AX staining. Next, we used a combination of cGAS, γH2AX, and DAPI staining. In mouse xenografts, we found regions enriched with the typical cGAS perinuclear accumulation that we observed in vitro , corresponding to γH2AX-positive nuclei ( Figure 7 B). Immunohistochemistry provided even clearer examples of NE ruptures, with cGAS staining at the periphery of nuclei ( Figure 7 C). Of note, the cGAS antibody was validated in vitro on DCIS cells depleted for cGAS ( Figure S7 A). Human breast cancer samples displayed heterogenous cGAS-labeling and cGAS-positive micro-nuclei, but we could also detect numerous NE rupture events ( Figure S7 B). A complete proof of the role of NE ruptures and TREX1 in human breast tumors will require deeper investigation of a larger number of patient samples. These observations show that NE rupture events occur in vivo , both in DCIS tumor xenografts and in human tumors. Therefore cGAS staining has the potential to be a powerful tool to visualize the occurrence of NE rupture events in tumor samples.

ROS and irradiation have been shown to induce TREX1 nuclear translocation, although the precise mechanisms remain elusive ( Chowdhury et al., 2006 7. Chowdhury, D. ∙ Beresford, P.J. ∙ Zhu, P. ...

Trex1 Exonuclease Degrades ssDNA to Prevent Chronic Checkpoint Activation and Autoimmune Disease Cell. 2007; 131 :873-886 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (453) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our imaging and rescue experiments, we speculate that TREX1 translocation could potentially occur upon fusion of the outer and inner nuclear membranes following NE ruptures. This could allow ER proteins, by diffusion on the membrane, to gain access to the inner nuclear membrane and potentially to the poorly characterized intranuclear membrane networks of the nuclear reticulum ( Malhas et al., 2011 37. Malhas, A. ∙ Goulbourne, C. ∙ Vaux, D.J. The nucleoplasmic reticulum: form and function Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21 :362-373 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is likely that the whole ER-bound SET complex transfers to the inner nuclear membrane upon NE rupture events. The SET complex has previously been implicated in the induction of TREX1-dependent nuclear DNA double strand breaks ( Chowdhury et al., 2006 7. Chowdhury, D. ∙ Beresford, P.J. ∙ Zhu, P. ... The exonuclease TREX1 is in the SET complex and acts in concert with NM23-H1 to degrade DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell death Mol. Cell. 2006; 23 :133-142 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). In agreement, we did not observe any transient formation of single strand breaks upon confinement using RPA-GFP, which displayed DNA damage foci upon treatment with hydroxyurea ( Figure S7 C). We thus speculate that DNA damage after NE rupture could also implicate other members of the SET complex that, together with the TREX1 exonuclease, gain access to inner nuclear membranes due to fusion of the outer and inner nuclear membranes at sites of rupture.
In the model systems here studied, the DNA damage response pathway is involved both in the senescence phenotype in RPE1 cells and in the induction of the collagenolytic response in the senescence-deficient DCIS cell line. This is in contrast to the cGAS-dependent inflammatory pathway ( Liu et al., 2018 32. Liu, H. ∙ Zhang, H. ∙ Wu, X. ... Nuclear cGAS suppresses DNA repair and promotes tumorigenesis Nature. 2018; 563 :131-136 Crossref Scopus (396) PubMed Google Scholar )( Harding et al., 2017 17.

Mitotic progression following DNA damage enables pattern recognition within micronuclei Nature. 2017; 548 :466-470 Crossref Scopus (969) PubMed Google Scholar ), which does not seem to be required in our experiments. A potential effect of ATM activation by DNA damage is a cell-cycle arrest. We indeed found that doxo-treated DCIS cells showed a reduction of cells in S/G2 upon 48 h of treatment ( Figure S7 D). Nevertheless, this cell-cycle arrest per se does not explain the increase in collagen degradation because this response was not increased comparing cells in G1 versus S/G2 ( Figure S7 E). Two recent studies pointed to a potential activation of an EMT-like phenotype downstream of ATM activation ( Jiang et al., 2019 22. Jiang, Y.N. ∙ Ni, X.Y. ∙ Yan, H.Q. ... Interleukin 6-triggered ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase activation facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer by upregulating vimentin expression Exp.

Chem. 2019; 294 :7037-7045 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, several ATM substrates have also been associated with lysosomal activity and thus potentially to collagen degradation ( Kang et al., 2017 23. Kang, H.T. ∙ Park, J.T. ∙ Choi, K. ... Chemical screening identifies ATM as a target for alleviating senescence Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 :616-623 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our results suggest that upon chronic, sub-lethal levels of DNA damage, cells that have lost the normal ATM-dependent senescence-associated proliferation arrest could initiate a partial EMT program including an invasive behavior, driving the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma stages.
A recent study ( Shah et al., 2021 50. Shah, P. ∙ Hobson, C.M. ∙ Cheng, S. ... Nuclear Deformation Causes DNA Damage by Increasing Replication Stress Curr. Biol. 2021; 31 :753-765.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) found that DNA damage can be triggered by confinement independently of NE rupture events in some cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 cells. We thus assayed these cells and found that DNA damage upon confinement was both NE rupture- and TREX1-independent ( Figures S7 G and S7H). These results suggest that tumors might be differentially sensitive to TREX1 inhibition.
Our experiments do not prove that TREX1 is the main driver of DNA damage in the human disease nor that DNA damage associated with nuclear deformation plays a role in the human disease progression. TREX1 has been described to promote pro- or anti-tumoral effects depending on different cellular and tumoral contexts ( Benci et al., 2019 3. Benci, J.L. ∙ Johnson, L.R. ∙ Choa, R. ...

Erdal, E. ∙ Haider, S. ∙ Rehwinkel, J. ... A prosurvival DNA damage-induced cytoplasmic interferon response is mediated by end resection factors and is limited by Trex1 Genes Dev. 2017; 31 :353-369 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vanpouille-Box et al., 2017 58. Vanpouille-Box, C. ∙ Alard, A. ∙ Aryankalayil, M.J. ... DNA exonuclease Trex1 regulates radiotherapy-induced tumour immunogenicity Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :15618 Crossref Scopus (1265) PubMed Google Scholar ). To get further insight into this question, we analyzed the association of TREX1 expression levels in breast cancer with overall survival using public datasets. This analysis revealed that high level of TREX1 expression is significantly associated with reduced probability of survival ( Figure S7 F). Thus, targeting this exonuclease might be an effective therapeutic strategy to curb tumor progression, while promoting anti-tumoral immune response via cGAS activation ( Stetson et al., 2008 53. Stetson, D.B. ∙ Ko, J.S. ∙ Heidmann, T. ...

Commun. 2018; 9 :1249 Crossref Scopus (210) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In this study, we focused on mammary tumors, but NE ruptures could also occur in other tumors. As a proof of concept, we performed cGAS staining on colorectal tumor samples. In 2 patients out of 4 tested, we observed a good correlation between regions highly enriched in nuclei positive for γH2AX, which corresponded to the invasive front of the tumor, and regions with a high fraction of nuclei with NE rupture events ( Figures S7 I–S7K). A broader study is needed to assess whether our findings can be extended to other tumor types.
We and others have shown that the NE is a fragile barrier constantly being challenged in physiology and disease ( Denais et al., 2016 9. Denais, C.M. ∙ Gilbert, R.M. ∙ Isermann, P. ... Nuclear envelope rupture and repair during cancer cell migration Science. 2016; 352 :353-358 Crossref Scopus (825) PubMed Google Scholar ; Raab et al., 2016 46.

Srivastava, N. ∙ Nader, G.P.F. ∙ Williart, A. ... Nuclear fragility, blaming the blebs Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2021; 70 :100-108 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nader, 2021 43. Nader Current Opinion in Cell Biology. 2021; Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar ). The occurrence of DNA damage associated with nuclear deformations is likely to be a common phenomenon. In normal tissues, this would trigger cellular senescence, contributing to developmental programs and tissue homeostasis, or even participating in tissue aging. In contrast, in tumor cells, in which the senescence checkpoint has been lost, it would lead to an aberrant invasiveness in the absence of a proliferative arrest, promoting tumor growth and invasion.
Double labeling with fluorescent 53BP1 and icGAS in live cells unambiguously demonstrated the causal relationship between NE rupture events and DNA damage. However, the different dynamics of icGAS entry and exit from the nucleus and DNA damage foci appearance and repair generate a more complex set of situations when considering cells at a fixed time point or fixed cells stained with these two proteins by immunofluorescence. This difficulty is exacerbated in 3D samples in which NE rupture events can happen out of the plan of imaging. In cases in which a direct live observation of the rupture events is difficult (e.g., in slices of tumor samples or in the duct on chip assay), cells in which cGAS perinuclear accumulation and DNA damage are simultaneously present likely represent only a subset of the cells that have undergone NE rupture-dependent DNA damage, making precise quantification difficult.

MCF10DCIS.com cells were cultured in Advanced DMEM- F12 (GIBCO) medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 5% horse serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (GIBCO #15140-122). MDA-MB-231 was maintained in L-15 culture medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) with 2mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cergy Pontoise, France) and 15% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 (GIBCO) supplemented with EGF (20ng/ml) (Peprotech #AF-100-15), hydrocortisone (0.5μg/ml) (SIGMA #H0888), cholera toxin (100ng/ml) (SIGMA #C8052), Insulin (10μg/ml) (SIGMA #I9278), 5% horse serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. RPE1 cells were grown in DMEM-F12 Glutamax medium (GIBCO), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (GIBCO). All cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , with the exception of MDA-MB-231 cells, which were maintained at 37°C in 1% CO 2 .
The following constructs were kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. Nicolas Manel (Institut Curie, Paris, France): pTRIP-CMV-mCherry-TREX1 WT and D18N were cloned from pEGFP-C1-TREX1 (Addgene #27219). pTRIP-SFFV-EGFP-FLAG-cGAS E225A/D227A and pTRIP-CMV-mCherry-FLAG-cGAS E225A/D227A are described elsewhere ( Gentili et al., 2019 15.

Lentiviral particles were produced as previously described from 293FT cells ( Lahaye et al., 2013 25. Lahaye, X. ∙ Satoh, T. ∙ Gentili, M. ... The capsids of HIV-1 and HIV-2 determine immune detection of the viral cDNA by the innate sensor cGAS in dendritic cells Immunity. 2013; 39 :1132-1142 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (292) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lentiviral viral particles and viral-like particles were produced by transfecting 1 μg of psPAX2 and 0.4 μg of pCMV-VSV-G together with 1.6 μg of a lentiviral vector plasmid per well of a 6-well plate. For cell transduction, 0.5x10 6 cells were plated in a 6 well plate in 1ml and infected with 2ml of fresh lentivector in the presence of 8 μg/ml of Protamine.
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) and quantified by NanoDrop to assess both concentration and quality of the samples. Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis kit from Invitrogen. Gene expression was analyzed by using the TaqMan Gene expression Assay (Applied Biosystems). 0.1 ng of cDNA was amplified, in triplicate, in a reaction volume of 25 μl with 10 pmol of each gene-specific primer and the SYBR Green PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed on the 14 ABI/Prism 7700 Sequence Detector System (PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems) using a pre-PCR step of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. Specificity of the amplified products was confirmed by melting curve analysis (Dissociation Curve TM; Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems) and by 6% PAGE. Preparations with RNA template without reverse transcription were used as negative controls. Samples were amplified with primers for each target gene and GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. The cycle threshold C t values were normalized to the GAPDH curve. PCR experiments were performed in triplicate and standard deviations calculated and displayed as error bars.
Cells were seeded and treated the day after with HT-DNA (1μg/ml) for 7h. 1.5x10 6 cells were recovered and washed with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in 80% methanol and frozen at −80°C. To perform cGAMP extraction, pellets were frozen/thawed five times in liquid nitrogen (with vortexing steps between each cycle). Then the samples were centrifuged at 16000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Supernatants were recovered and dried in a speed vaccum drying in Savant DNA Speed Vac DNA 110 for 3 h at 65°C. Pellets were resuspended in 150μl of DNase/RNase sterile water. cGAMP concentration was obtained with the 2′3′-cGAMP ELISA Kit (Cayman Chemical) according the manufacturer instruction. cGAMP quantities were normalized to the number of cells extracted.
The guideRNA (gRNA) targeting TREX1 was kindly provided by the lab of Titia De Lange (Rockefeller University, New York, USA): gTREX1, 5′-GAGCCCCCCCACCTCTC-(PAM)-3′. gRNA plasmid was co-transfected into target cells with an hCas9 expression plasmid (Addgene) by nucleofection (Lonza apparatus). 1x10 6 cells were mixed with electroporation buffer (freshly mixed 125 mM Na2HPO4, 12.5 mM KCl, 55 mM MgCl2 pH 7.75), 2 μg Cas9 plasmid, and 2 μg gRNA plasmid, transferred to an electroporation cuvette (BTX), and electroporated with program U-017 for RPE-1 cells or program D-023 for MCF10DCIS.com cells. Cells were then allowed to recover for 48 h before single cell FACs sorting into single wells of a 96 wells plate for single clone amplification and selection. Successful CRISPR/Cas9 editing was confirmed by both western blotting of the amplified cell colonies and analysis of indel size (using the ICE analysis toolbox ( https://www.synthego.com/products/bioinformatics/crispr-analysis ).
Unlabeled type I collagen at 2.4 mg/ml (BD Biosciences, Cat. # 354236) was injected in the “collagen chamber” of the microfabricated duct-on-a-chip and incubated for 1h at 37°C. In the meantime cells were ressuspended in matrigel (SIGMA #E1270) at a concentration of 0.7x10 6 cells/μl and then 3 μl were injected in the “cells chamber.” Images were acquired at the desired time points after injection to assess cell invasion into the “collagen chamber.”
Sections 2.5/3 micron-thick were cut from paraffin blocks, dried, de-waxed and rehydrated. The antigen unmasking technique was performed using Target Retrieval Solutions pH6 at 98°C for 30 min. After neutralization of the endogenous peroxidase with 3% H 2 O 2 and Fc blocking by a specific protein block, double-marker immunohistochemistry was carried out by incubation for 90 min at RT with the primary antibodies RAB5A (Abcam, 1:100, pH6) and γH2AX (Abcam, 1:1000, pH6). Staining was revealed using Novolink Polymer Detection Systems (Novocastra) and SuperSensitive Link-Label IHC Detection System Alkaline Phosphatase (Biogenex). DAB (3,3′- diaminobenzidine) and Vulcan Fast Red were used as substrate chromogens. The slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Novocastra). All the sections were analyzed under a Zeiss AXIO Scope.A1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and microphotographs were collected using a Zeiss Axiocam 503 Color digital camera using the Zen2 imaging software.
Antibody reference: cGAS (D1D3G) Rabbit mAb #15102; Cell Signaling, Dilution: 1/50. Antigen retrieval: BOND Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (Leica, AR9961; pH9) for 20 min; protein blocking: 5 min (protein block serum-free Dako #X0909); incubation: 1h at room temperature
For DAB staining, once immunostaining finished, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting with glycergel medium (Dako). Images were acquired using Digital Pathology slide scanner (Nanozoomer 2.5, Hamamatsu). For multiplex IF, immunostaining was processed with Opal 7-Color IHC Kits (Akoya 23 Biosciences, NEL821001KT). HRP labeled Rabbit Polymer and TSA opal fluorophores were incubated for 10 min each. Subsequently, slides were submitted to DAPI staining for 10 min, washed and coverslipped with Prolong Diamond Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher) before image acquisition.
Whole-mount carmine and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed as described ( Teulière et al., 2005 56. Teulière, J. ∙ Faraldo, M.M. ∙ Deugnier, M.A. ... Targeted activation of beta-catenin signaling in basal mammary epithelial cells affects mammary development and leads to hyperplasia Development. 2005; 132 :267-277 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). To retrieve antigens on paraffin-embedded tissue samples, sections were incubated for 20 min in 10mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0 at 90°C. After 1h incubation in 5% fetal calf serum, sections were incubated overnight with diluted primary antibodies, washed and further incubated for 2h at room temperature with appropriate secondary antibodies.
Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and then incubated for 1h at room temperature with primary antibodies. Following three washes with PBS, samples were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature. Samples were again washed three times with PBS and mounted with Fluoromount G (Molecular probes).
For collagen degradation assessment followed by immunofluorescence analysis, glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corporation) were layered with 15 μL of a solution of 5 mg/ml unlabeled type I collagen (IBIDI Cat. # 50201) mixed with 1/20-40 volume of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled collagen. Polymerization was induced at 37°C for 3 min and complete medium was added. Cells were seeded onto the polymerized collagen layer and incubated for 1h at 37°C. The medium was then gently removed and two drops of a mix of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled type I collagen (10% final) and unlabeled type I collagen at 2.4 mg/ml (BD Biosciences, Cat. # 354236) were added on top of the cells (top layer). After polymerization at 37°C for 1.5h, 1 mL of medium was added to the MatTek dishes.
For RNA interference experiments, cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) (RPE1 cells), or with Lullaby (OZ Biosciences, France) (MCF10A cells, MCF10DCIS.com cells and MDA-MB-231 cells) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The following SMARTpool siRNAs were used: human TREX1 (Dharmacon, cat. # L-013239-02-0005), human MB21D1 (cGAS) (Dharmacon, cat. # L-015607-02-0005) and validated non-targeting siRNAs (Dharmacon, cat. # D-001810-10-20). Cells were analyzed 72 h post-transfection using standard western blot or immunofluorescence analysis protocols.
The following pharmacological inhibitors and chemical compounds were used: Etoposide (DNA damaging agent, topoisomerase-II inhibitor; Cell Signaling, #2200), Doxorubicin (DNA damaging agent, topoisomerase-II inhibitor; Cell Signaling, #5927), GM6001 (pan-inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases; Millipore, # CC1010), KU-55933 (ATM kinase inhibitor; Abcam, #120637).
Cells were collected and resuspended in Laemmeli buffer. Proteins were separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE, 4%–20%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (TBS-Tween) for 1 h at room temperature, after which primary antibodies were added in TBS-Tween 5% BSA and incubated over night at 4°C. The membranes were subsequently washed in TBS-Tween after which secondary horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added in 5% BSA in TBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing in TBS-Tween ECL signal was recorded on a ChemiDoc Touch Biorad Imager.
To obtain large quantities of confined cells for cell population or biochemical studies, cell confinement was performed using a version of the cell confiner adapted to multi-well plates ( Liu et al., 2015 31. Liu, Y.-J. ∙ Le Berre, M. ∙ Lautenschlaeger, F. ... Confinement and low adhesion induce fast amoeboid migration of slow mesenchymal cells Cell. 2015; 160 :659-672 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ). To make the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, RTV615, GE) microspacers (micropillars) at the desired height, 12 mm glass coverslips were plasma treated and then placed on top of a PDMS mixture (10/1 w/w PDMS A / crosslinker B) on the wafer molds (containing holes/micropillars, fabricated following standard photolithography procedures). The height of the micropillars determines the height for spatial confinement of cells between the coverslip and the substrate. The surface of the confining side was always treated with non-adhesive pLL-PEG (SuSoS, PLL(20)-g[3.5]-PEG(2)). After baking at 95°C for 15 min, coverslips with PDMS pillars were carefully removed from the wafers under isopropanol. They were then cleaned with isopropanol, well-dried, treated with plasma for 1 min, and treated with 0.5 mg/mL pLL-PEG in 10 mM pH 7.4 HEPES buffer for 1h at room temperature. Coverslips with PDMS pillars were rinsed and incubated in medium for at least 2 hours before confining the cells. The modified cover-lid of a multi-well plate was used to apply confining slides to cells. In this case, large PDMS pillars were stuck on the cover-lid of the multi-well plate to hold the confining slides containing a layer of microfabricated micropillars. These large PDMS pillars push the confining slides from the top of the plastic 6 well cover-lid to confine the cells in 6 well glass/plastic bottom plates. The process of fabrication of these large pillars attached to the 6 well plate lid is as follows: the large PDMS pillars were fabricated by pouring a PDMS mixture (A:B = 35:1) into a custom-made metallic mold, removing bubbles under vacuum, then baking overnight at 80°C, and getting the pillars out of the mold with the help of small amount of isopropanol.
Time-lapse recordings were acquired with 20x (NA 0.75) or 40x (NA 0.85) dry objectives using either an Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with a Coolsnap HQ2 camera (Photometrics) or with an spinning-disc confocal microscope with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning-disc head on a DMI-8 Leica inverted microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu OrcaFlash 4.0 Camera, a NanoScanZ piezo focusing stage (Prior Scientific) and a motorized scanning stage (Marzhauser). Both microscopes were controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). All microscopes were equipped with an on-stage incubation chamber which maintained the temperature at 37°C and CO 2 concentration at 5% at all times. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ/Fiji software (NIH, https://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html ) or MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging).
For semi-automated analysis of nuclear γH2AX intensity in tissues as a function of distance from tumor edge, a macro was written and run on Fiji software. First, individual nuclear regions were obtained after thresholding using the DAPI channel. Subsequently, the tumor edge was manually defined on the image using the myoepithelial layer as the reference. Next, a map of the distance to the tumor edge was obtained. Finally, γH2AX intensity and the distance to the edge was measured for each nuclei of the tumor xenograft. Cells with strongly condensed chromatin (as assessed by DAPI staining) were excluded from the analysis as they could be either mitotic or apoptotic cells. Due to intensity variation between experiments, γH2AX intensities were normalized using Z scores. For each image, the distribution of the intensities of nuclei inside the tumor (> 30μm from the myoepithelial layer) and at the tumor edge (< 30μm from the myoepithelial layer) were fit using a Gaussian function to obtain an average nuclear intensity and a standard deviation. Thus, individual nuclei intensities were normalized as: Z score = (Nuclear Intensity-Average Nuclear Intensity)/Standard Deviation, to compare all experiments.
Sample preparation, ultrathin cryo-sectioning and immunolabelling were performed as previously described ( Slot and Geuze, 2007 51. Slot, J.W. ∙ Geuze, H.J. Cryosectioning and immunolabeling Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :2480-2491 Crossref Scopus (357) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, RPE1 TREX1 KO + TREX1-mCherry were confined at 2 μm for 30 min. Next, the confinement lid was removed (in order to have enough number of cells for sample preparation, a total of twelve 6well plates were confined, cells were harvested and pooled together). Cells were harvested and processed for fixation for 2h with 2% formaldehyde + 0.125% Glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The fixative was the replaced by PFA 1% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer and sample was stored at 4°C in a sealed tube. For the preparation of the blocks cells were rinsed with PBS, the blocks were embedded in 12% gelatin, cryoprotected with 2.3 M sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryo-sections were cut on a Leica ultracut UC7 cryo-microtome and picked up in a freshly prepared 1:1 mixture of 2.3 M sucrose and 1.8% methylcellulose, thawed and collected on formvar-coated grids. After washing with PBS containing 0.02 M glycine, sections were incubated with primary antibody (anti-mCherry; GeneTex #GTX 128508 used at 1:250 dilution and anti-PDI; EnzoLife Sciences ADI-SPA-891) and protein A-gold conjugates (PAG) (Utrecht University, the Netherlands). Sections were examined using a Tecnai Spirit electron microscope (FEI Company) equipped with a digital camera Quemesa (SIS). Quantitative Immuno EM analysis was used as described by Mayhew (2011 40. Mayhew, T.M. Mapping the distributions and quantifying the labelling intensities of cell compartments by immunoelectron microscopy: progress towards a coherent set of methods J. Anat. 2011; 219 :647-660 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Approach 1: Testing for shifts in compartment labeling in different groups of cells. This approach is used to test whether the distribution of gold particles across compartments alters between not confined and 2 μm confined cells. The observed numerical frequency distributions of raw gold counts in different groups of cells are compared directly by contingency table analysis. For a particular compartment in a given cell, the number of expected gold particles is calculated by multiplying the corresponding column sum by the corresponding row sum and then dividing by the grand row sum (see Table S1 ). Approach 2: Relative labeling index analysis, testing for differences in specific-labeling enrichment of TREX1-mCherry gold particles between cellular compartments. Labeling density values relate numbers of gold particles to the sizes of compartments. For the relative labeling index analysis, a total of four compartments, including “nucleus,” “peripheral ER,” “inner nuclear membrane” and “outer nuclear membrane” were selected to analyze the intracellular distribution of TREX1-gold particles. The expected distribution was obtained by superimposing to pictures an array of points that was generated digitally, and points ( P ) were counted in the selected compartments. Pictures were taken randomly with the only criterion of a well-preserved morphology. Gold particles on all sampled fields were counted and named as observed gold particles ( Ngo ). For each compartment, Ngo was compared with the expected numbers of gold particles ( Nge , derived from the observed frequencies of points P ). Labeling density ( LD ) is calculated as the number of gold particles per test point ( LD = Ngo/P ). For each compartment, relative labeling index RLI = LD compartment/LD cell . RLI = 1 indicates random labeling while RLI > 1 indicates when compartments are preferentially labeled. By means of a two-sample Chi-square ( χ2 ) analysis with two columns ( Ngo ) and ( Nge ) and c compartments (arranged in rows), two distributions were compared, the total and partial χ2 values were calculated, and whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis was decided (of no difference between distributions) for c−1 degrees of freedom. For any given compartment, the partial χ2 is calculated as ( Ngo−Nge ) 2 / Nge . If the observed and expected distributions are different, examining the partial χ2 values will identify those compartments that are mainly responsible for that difference. A convenient arbitrary cut-off is a partial χ2 value accounting for 10% or more of total ( Mayhew, 2011 40. Mayhew, T.M. Mapping the distributions and quantifying the labelling intensities of cell compartments by immunoelectron microscopy: progress towards a coherent set of methods J. Anat. 2011; 219 :647-660 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Statistical analyses for all experiments were performed in Prism (GraphPad) v5.02. Statistical data are presented as median or mean ± SEM, SD or 10-90 percentiles. Sample size (n), statistical tests used and p values are specified in the figure legends. Samples in most cases were defined as the number of cells counted/examined within multiple different fields of view on the same dish/slide, and thus represent data from a single sample within a single experiment that are representative of at least three additional independently conducted experiments.
