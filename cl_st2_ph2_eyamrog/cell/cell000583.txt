Title: A male-derived nonribosomal peptide pheromone controls female schistosome development


Abstract: Summary

Schistosomes cause morbidity and death throughout the developing world due to the massive numbers of eggs female worms deposit into the blood of their host. Studies dating back to the 1920s show that female schistosomes rely on constant physical contact with a male worm both to become and remain sexually mature; however, the molecular details governing this process remain elusive. Here, we uncover a nonribosomal peptide synthetase that is induced in male worms upon pairing with a female and find that it is essential for the ability of male worms to stimulate female development. We demonstrate that this enzyme generates β-alanyl-tryptamine that is released by paired male worms. Furthermore, synthetic β-alanyl-tryptamine can replace male worms to stimulate female sexual development and egg laying. These data reveal that peptide-based pheromone signaling controls female schistosome sexual maturation, suggesting avenues for therapeutic intervention and uncovering a role for nonribosomal peptides as metazoan signaling molecules.

Section: Introduction

Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that infect 220 million of the world’s poorest people ( Steinmann et al., 2006 43. Steinmann, P. ∙ Keiser, J. ∙ Bos, R. ...

WHO Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted infections: number of people treated in 2017: Weekly Epidemiological Record World Health Organization, 2018 https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-wer9350 Google Scholar ). These parasites claim more than 250,000 lives every year and cause chronic, debilitating symptoms in millions more ( King, 2010 23. King, C.H.

Quantification of clinical morbidity associated with schistosome infection in sub-Saharan Africa Acta Trop. 2003; 86 :125-139 Crossref Scopus (747) PubMed Google Scholar ). The morbidity associated with schistosome infection is driven almost entirely by the parasite’s massive egg output ( Grzych et al., 1991 15. Grzych, J.M. ∙ Pearce, E. ∙ Cheever, A. ... Egg deposition is the major stimulus for the production of Th2 cytokines in murine Schistosomiasis mansoni J. Immunol. 1991; 146 :1322-1327 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, these parasites can produce an egg every one to 5 min over the decades they survive in the blood ( Cheever et al., 1994 5. Cheever, A.W. ∙ Macedonia, J.G. ∙ Mosimann, J.E. ... Kinetics of egg production and egg excretion by Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum in mice infected with a single pair of worms Am. J. Trop. Med.

Hyg. 1984; 78 :385-388 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the parasite’s goal is to pass the eggs to the environment, many become lodged in host organs, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis that drive disease ( Pearce and MacDonald, 2002 31. Pearce, E.J. ∙ MacDonald, A.S. The immunobiology of schistosomiasis Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2 :499-511 Crossref Scopus (967) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since parasites incapable of egg production generate little pathology ( Langenberg et al., 2020 25. Langenberg, M.C.C. ∙ Hoogerwerf, M.A. ∙ Koopman, J.P.R. ... A controlled human Schistosoma mansoni infection model to advance novel drugs, vaccines and diagnostics Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :326-332 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ), strategies that blunt egg production could represent additional therapies.
In contrast to other flatworms that reproduce as hermaphrodites, schistosomes are dioecious, possessing separate male and female sexes ( Cort, 1921 11. Cort, W.W. Sex in the trematode family Schistosomidae Science. 1921; 53 :226-228 Crossref Scopus (7) PubMed Google Scholar ). This sexual dimorphism was such a distinguishing characteristic that early parasitologists created the genus Schistosoma to refer to the split (schistos) body (soma) of these worms ( Weinland and Wyman, 1858 52. Weinland, D.F. ∙ Wyman, J. Human Cestoides : an Essay on the Tapeworms of Man: Giving a Full Account of their Nature, Organization, and Embryonic Development; the Pathological Symptoms they Produce, and the Remedies Which have Proved Successful in Modern Practice Metcalf and Company, 1858 Crossref Google Scholar ). The male worms are large and muscular, with a specialized groove along their ventral surface, the gynecophoral canal, that the male uses to clasp the female to allow sperm transfer. Unlike the male, the female schistosome is long and slender with much of her body mass committed to egg production. Egg production in female worms relies on two large organ systems ( Figure 1 A, mature): the ovary, which produces oocytes, and the vitellaria, which produce vitellocytes (yolk cells) that provide egg shell constituents and nutrition for the developing embryo.
Presumably, as a consequence of hailing from hermaphroditic ancestors, male and female schistosomes have evolved several unique interactions. The most striking of these, first noted nearly a century ago, is that female sexual development is entirely governed by pairing with a male schistosome ( Severinghaus, 1928 38. Severinghaus, A.E. Sex studies on Schistosoma japonicum Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1928; 71 :653-702 Google Scholar ). Indeed, the ovaries and vitellaria of females grown in the absence of males are present as primordia that generate no differentiated oocytes or vitellocytes ( Figure 1 A, immature “virgin”). As a consequence, unpaired females generate no eggs. Not only do females require males to induce their sexual development, they require perpetual coupling with a male to sustain their mature reproductive status ( Popiel et al., 1984 36. Popiel, I. ∙ Cioli, D. ∙ Erasmus, D.A. The morphology and reproductive status of female Schistosoma mansoni following separation from male worms Int. J. Parasitol. 1984; 14 :183-190 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Curiously, amputated segments of male worms that lack reproductive organs can pair with virgin females and induce localized development of the female vitellaria or ovaries ( Popiel and Basch, 1984 34. Popiel, I. ∙ Basch, P.F. Reproductive development of female Schistosoma mansoni (Digenea: Schistosomatidae) following bisexual pairing of worms and worm segments J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 232 :141-150 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 49. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Collins, J.J. Systematically improved in vitro culture conditions reveal new insights into the reproductive biology of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000254 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, localized physical contact with a male, and not sperm transfer, is critical for stimulating the development of the female sexual organs. Despite progress identifying molecular pathways involved in sexual development ( Grevelding et al., 2018 14. Grevelding, C.G. ∙ Langner, S. ∙ Dissous, C. Kinases: molecular stage directors for schistosome development and differentiation Trends Parasitol. 2018; 34 :246-260 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; LoVerde et al., 2009 27. LoVerde, P.T. ∙ Andrade, L.F. ∙ Oliveira, G. Signal transduction regulates schistosome reproductive biology Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12 :422-428 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ), the molecular mechanisms by which male:female pairing induces female maturation remains one of the largest outstanding mysteries in the field.
Here, we report that the expression of the transcription factor, GLI1, is critical for male schistosomes to induce female sexual development. Transcriptional profiling and biochemical studies revealed that GLI1 is essential for the induction of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) in male worms following pairing and that this enzyme produces a dipeptide (BATT, β-alanyl-tryptamine) exclusively in paired male worms. We find that paired male worms secrete BATT to the environment and that treatment of virgin females with this dipeptide can induce their development in the absence of a male worm. Together, these studies uncover a mechanism by which male schistosomes control female development.

Section: Results

In order to uncover genes essential for male-induced female reproductive development, we performed an RNAi screen targeting components of the major signaling pathways conserved among metazoa ( Table S1 ). Given the broad roles for these pathways in controlling metazoan development ( Perrimon et al., 2012 32. Perrimon, N. ∙ Pitsouli, C. ∙ Shilo, B.Z. Signaling mechanisms controlling cell fate and embryonic patterning Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4 :a005975 Crossref Scopus (274) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that targeting one or more of these pathways could uncover molecules essential for male-stimulated female development. For this screen, we performed RNAi on virgin female worms, then on male:female worm pairs, and then measured the rate of female sexual development by monitoring egg production at D14 ( Figure 1 B).
From this screen, we uncovered a single gene, gli1 , that was essential for female worms to commence egg production ( Figure 1 C). Since both male and female worms received gli1 dsRNA, this effect could be due to gli1 depletion in male and/or female worms. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed gli1 RNAi treatment on either virgin female parasites or male parasites for 7 days and then paired these RNAi-treated worms with untreated parasites of the opposite sex. These studies revealed that RNAi of gli1 in female worms had no effect on the development of the vitellaria or egg production ( Figure 1 D). However, female worms coupled with gli1 RNAi male worms displayed little vitellaria development, scant ovary differentiation, and were incapable of egg production postpairing ( Figures 1 E and S1 A). Thus, gli1 appears to act in male worms to control one or more processes that are critical for the stimulation of female development and egg production.
gli1 is predicted to encode a zinc finger transcription factor related to the GLI family of proteins that are mediators of hedgehog-dependent and -independent signaling pathways ( Pietrobono et al., 2019 33. Pietrobono, S. ∙ Gagliardi, S. ∙ Stecca, B. Non-canonical hedgehog signaling pathway in cancer: activation of GLI transcription factors Beyond smoothened Front. Genet. 2019; 10 :556 Crossref Scopus (205) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given its potential role in transcriptional regulation, we reasoned that gli1 may control transcriptional changes in male worms that are necessary for the males to initiate processes key to induce female development. To explore this in more detail, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) to examine the distribution of gli1 mRNA in male worms. We observed gli1 expression in cells distributed along the ventral surface of both paired ( Figure 1 F) and unpaired male worms ( Figures S1 B and S1C; Video S1 ). By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we found that these ventrally positioned gli1 + cells expressed markers of neurons ( 7b2 , Figure S1 D) and the tegument (skin) ( calpain (calp) , Figure S1 E) in both paired and virgin males. Since the male worm contacts the female along his ventral surface, it appears that GLI1 is expressed in cells in proximity to female parasites upon pairing. Furthermore, it appears that the distribution of gli1 mRNA is not substantially altered in male worms following pairing.

Confocal stacks from dorsal to ventral tissue of FISH for gli1 mRNA (magenta) and DAPI (gray) staining in paired and virgin male worms, related to Figure 1
We also examined the expression of gli1 in virgin and mature female worms. We noted gli1 mRNA expressed bilaterally along the edges of the body in both mature and virgin females; by FISH, we found that these cells expressed the neural marker 7b2 ( Figure S1 G). Interestingly, we noted by WISH that mature female schistosomes expressed more gli1 throughout their bodies ( Figure S1 F). By FISH, we observed that many gli1 + cells in mature female schistosomes expressed the tegumental marker calp ( Figure S1 H). However, few calp / gli1 double positive cells were observed in virgin females ( Figure S1 H). Thus, it appears that the distribution of gli1 expression is changed in females during sexual maturation. However, since RNAi of gli1 in females resulted in no obvious phenotypes ( Figure 1 D), it is challenging to speculate the significance of these observations.
To explore which genes GLI1 may control in male parasites upon pairing, we performed RNA-seq ( Figure 2 A). For these studies, virgin male parasites were treated with gli1 dsRNA and either paired with virgin female worms or cocultured in wells with female worms but prohibited from pairing by a mesh cell strainer. Following 2 days of coculture, RNA from male ( Figure 2 B) and female worms ( Figure S2 A) were processed for RNA-seq. Similar to previous studies examining gene expression changes in male worms upon pairing ( Lu et al., 2016 28. Lu, Z. ∙ Sessler, F. ∙ Holroyd, N. ... Schistosome sex matters: a deep view into gonad-specific and pairing-dependent transcriptomes reveals a complex gender interplay Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 :31150 Crossref Scopus (94) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2017 51. Wang, J. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Shen, H. ... Dynamic transcriptomes identify biogenic amines and insect-like hormonal regulation for mediating reproduction in Schistosoma japonicum Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14693 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ), we noted only a small group of genes (16) that were induced >2-fold in male worms postpairing (p-adj. < 0.0001, Figure 2 B; Table S2 ). Many of these genes were not induced to the same level in the absence of gli1 ( Figure 2 B). The most notable difference was in the expression of Smp_158480, which was induced >20-fold in paired versus unpaired control males but only induced about 2-fold when gli1 was depleted ( Figure 2 B). Interestingly, this gene was downregulated about 10-fold in the females after pairing, and this downregulation was also dependent on male gli1 mRNA ( Figure S2 A; Table S3 ). These observations parallel previous studies that examined Smp_158480 expression in paired and unpaired worms ( Haeberlein et al., 2019 16. Haeberlein, S. ∙ Angrisano, A. ∙ Quack, T. ... Identification of a new panel of reference genes to study pairing-dependent gene expression in Schistosoma mansoni Int. J. Parasitol. 2019; 49 :615-624 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lu et al., 2019 29. Lu, Z. ∙ Spänig, S. ∙ Weth, O. ... Males, the wrongly neglected partners of the biologically unprecedented male-female interaction of schistosomes Front. Genet. 2019; 10 :796 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on BLAST, Smp_158480 appeared to encode a NRPS similar to Ebony from Drosophila ( Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ... Ebony, a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase for beta-alanine conjugation with biogenic amines in Drosophila J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). From here on, we will refer to Smp_158480 as Schistosoma mansoni nonribosomal peptide synthetase ( Sm-nrps ).
Given the robust gli1 -dependent induction of Sm-nrps expression following pairing, we conducted detailed analyses of Sm-nrps expression. As suggested by our RNA-seq data, WISH analysis found that Sm-nrps mRNA was abundantly expressed in paired male worms recovered from mixed sex infections but not in virgin male worms recovered from male-only infections ( Figure 2 C). Sm-nrps expression in paired male worms was found in distinct cells throughout the body but with expression limited to a few cells in the head ( Figures 2 C, left and S2 B). Conversely, virgin male parasites expressed little Sm-nrps in their bodies but possessed bilateral “lines” of Sm-nrps + cells in their head. Interestingly, although paired gli1 RNAi parasites had little expression of Sm-nrps in their bodies, they expressed Sm-nrps in their head in a manner similar to that of virgin male worms ( Figures 2 C and 2D). This latter result suggests that gli1 does not simply regulate global Sm-nrps levels and may be required for controlling a “switch” between paired and unpaired transcriptional programs. Consistent with Sm-nrps expression being tightly controlled by pairing status, we observed that Sm-nrps mRNA levels were induced within 24 h of pairing and were rapidly depleted in male worms within 12 h of becoming divorced from their female mates ( Figure 2 E).
We next explored the molecular identity of the Sm-nrps + pairing-responsive cells in the bodies of male worms. As was observed for gli1 , Sm-nrps + cells were almost entirely found on the ventral side of male worms ( Figure 2 F). Examination of Sm-nrps expression using a single-cell RNA-seq atlas of adult schistosomes ( Wendt et al., 2020 53. Wendt, G. ∙ Zhao, L. ∙ Chen, R. ... A single-cell RNA-seq atlas of Schistosoma mansoni identifies a key regulator of blood feeding Science. 2020; 369 :1644-1649 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) found that this gene was most highly expressed in a subpopulation of neurons ( Figure 2 I, left). Indeed, FISH analyses found that all Sm-nrps + body cells (59/59 cells examined) expressed the neural marker 7b2 ( Figure 2 G). As anticipated by our RNA-seq studies, these Sm-nrps + neurons in the body also expressed gli1 ( Figure 2 H, 37/40 cells). Conversely, the small number of Sm-nrps + cells in the head of virgin males did not express gli1 + ( Figure S2 C) and instead expressed the muscle marker tpm2 ( Figure S2 D). A closer examination of the Sm-nrps + neuron cluster on our single-cell RNA-seq atlas and subsequent FISH studies found that these cells express tppp2 ( Figures 2 I and 2J, 34/38 cells examined), a marker of ciliated cell types ( Wendt et al., 2020 53. Wendt, G. ∙ Zhao, L. ∙ Chen, R. ... A single-cell RNA-seq atlas of Schistosoma mansoni identifies a key regulator of blood feeding Science. 2020; 369 :1644-1649 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since ciliated cells are often associated with sensory functions ( Singla and Reiter, 2006 40. Singla, V. ∙ Reiter, J.F. The primary cilium as the cell's antenna: signaling at a sensory organelle Science. 2006; 313 :629-633 Crossref Scopus (884) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that these Sm-nrps + neurons on the male ventral surface could represent sensory cells involved in male:female communication. The morphology of the ventral surface where the male contacts the female worm, known as the gynecophoral canal, has received little attention due to its folded structure prohibiting detailed morphological studies. Using an optimized relaxation and fixation procedure, we performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies of the male ventral surface. Importantly, we observed cilium-like protrusions, roughly 1 μm in length and morphologically similar to previously described schistosome sensory cilia ( Collins et al., 2011 7. Collins, III, J.J. ∙ King, R.S. ∙ Cogswell, A. ... An atlas for Schistosoma mansoni organs and life-cycle stages using cell type-specific markers and confocal microscopy PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2011; 5 :e1009 Crossref Scopus (109) PubMed Google Scholar ), present throughout the gynecophoral canal in both paired ( Figure 2 K) and unpaired male worms ( Figure S2 E). These data suggest that Sm-nrps + cells along the ventral surface are ciliated neurons potentially exposed to the environment within the gynecophoral canal.
We also analyzed the expression of Sm-nrps in the females by in situ hybridization. Consistent with our RNA-seq studies, Sm-nrps mRNA was most highly expressed in virgin females in cells throughout the body and was only weakly detected in sexually mature females ( Figure S2 F). Interestingly, the two lines of Sm-nrps + head cells observed in virgin males were also present in virgin female worms ( Figure S2 F). By FISH, we found that Sm-nrps + cells in both the head and body expressed the muscle marker tpm2 but not the neural marker 7b2 ( Figures S2 G and S2H). Unlike in paired males, Sm-nrps was expressed on the dorsal surface and lateral edges of the virgin female body ( Figure S2 I).
Motivated by our gene expression studies, we performed RNAi to evaluate the role of male Sm-nrps in controlling female development. For these studies, unpaired male parasites were treated with Sm-nrps or control dsRNA for a week and then paired with virgin females for 2 weeks ( Figures 3 A and S2 J). Similar to what was observed with gli1 RNAi , we found that female worms paired with Sm-nrps RNAi males laid ∼90% fewer eggs compared with controls ( Figure 3 B). Female worms paired with Sm-nrps RNAi males also displayed reduced Fast Blue BB staining in their vitellaria and possessed poorly developed ovaries ( Figure 3 C). These data support the model that gli1 -dependent induction of Sm-nrps levels in male worms is critical for normal female sexual development. Unlike gli1 RNAi males whose postpairing Sm-nrps expression pattern was similar to virgin parasites ( Figure 2 D), Sm-nrps RNA was not detectable in heads or bodies of Sm-nrps RNAi males after pairing ( Figure 3 D), as expected.
NRPSs produce physiologically and clinically important secondary metabolites, including antibiotics ( Süssmuth and Mainz, 2017 45. Süssmuth, R.D. ∙ Mainz, A. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis-principles and prospects Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2017; 56 :3770-3821 Crossref Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ), from standard and nonstandard amino acids. Although these enzymes are widely found in bacteria and fungi, few have been characterized outside of these taxa ( Torres and Schmidt, 2019 46. Torres, J.P. ∙ Schmidt, E.W. The biosynthetic diversity of the animal world J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :17684-17692 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). One exception is the D. melanogaster Ebony protein. Ebony is composed of three domains: an N-terminal amino acid adenylation domain (A domain), a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) or thiolation domain (T domain), and a C-terminal “amine selective” domain ( Izoré et al., 2019 22. Izoré, T. ∙ Tailhades, J. ∙ Hansen, M.H. ... Drosophila melanogaster nonribosomal peptide synthetase Ebony encodes an atypical condensation domain Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :2913-2918 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ...

Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). By protein alignment with Ebony, we were able to discern both an A and a T domain in the schistosome NRPS protein sequence, suggesting this protein is potentially a true metazoan NRPS enzyme ( Figures 4 A and S3 A).
Biochemical studies have determined that Ebony is able to conjugate β-alanine (βAla) to a variety of biogenic amines, including serotonin, dopamine, and histamine ( Hartwig et al., 2014 18. Hartwig, S. ∙ Dovengerds, C. ∙ Herrmann, C. ... Drosophila Ebony: a novel type of nonribosomal peptide synthetase related enzyme with unusually fast peptide bond formation kinetics FEBS J. 2014; 281 :5147-5158 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ... Ebony, a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase for beta-alanine conjugation with biogenic amines in Drosophila J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). This enzymatic process involves three steps ( Figures 4 B and S3 B): (1) adenylation of βAla catalyzed by the A domain, (2) covalent attachment of βAla to a phosphopantetheinyl group on a conserved serine (ser611) within T domain, and (3) binding of an appropriate amine in the amine selective domain to facilitate nucleophilic attack of the βAla group resulting in a dipeptide product. The specificity of A domain toward the first amino acid substrate can be predicted by the sequence of approximately ten residues within the substrate binding pocket of the A domain ( Stachelhaus et al., 1999 42. Stachelhaus, T. ∙ Mootz, H.D. ∙ Marahiel, M.A. The specificity-conferring code of adenylation domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases Chem. Biol. 1999; 6 :493-505 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1026) PubMed Google Scholar ). Protein alignments of A domains that use βAla (Ebony and the first A domain of NRPS2-1, a bacterial enzyme) and the standard reference A domain from gramicidin synthetase 1 (GS1), which uses Phe ( Conti et al., 1997 10. Conti, E. ∙ Stachelhaus, T. ∙ Marahiel, M.A. ... Structural basis for the activation of phenylalanine in the non-ribosomal biosynthesis of gramicidin S EMBO J. 1997; 16 :4174-4183 Crossref Scopus (606) PubMed Google Scholar ), found extensive similarities between SmNRPS and its homologs that use βAla ( Figure 4 C).
To explore the ability of the schistosome enzyme to utilize βAla, we purified full-length schistosome SmNRPS from insect cells ( Figure S3 C) and measured its amino acid-dependent ATP-PP i exchange activity ( Hartwig et al., 2014 18. Hartwig, S. ∙ Dovengerds, C. ∙ Herrmann, C. ...

Hoagland, M.B. An enzymic mechanism for amino acid activation in animal tissues Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1955; 16 :288-289 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richardt et al., 2003 37.

Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). This assay measures the ability of the enzyme to catalyze the incorporation of 32 P from [ 32 P]PP i into ATP in the presence of an amino acid substrate ( Figure S3 D). Similar to Ebony, we found that SmNRPS was only active in the presence of βAla ( Figures 4 D and 4E), suggesting that the SmNRPS A domain is selective for βAla over other amino acids. Although SmNRPS had clear selectivity for βAla, its adenylation rate in the presence of βAla was roughly 8 times slower than A domain of Ebony ( Figure S3 E). As with Ebony ( Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ... Ebony, a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase for beta-alanine conjugation with biogenic amines in Drosophila J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), the ability of SmNRPS to convert PP i to ATP was not dependent on the conserved thiolation site (Ser892) ( Figure 4 C, “T”) in the T domain ( Figure 4 F).
Next, we tested the specificity for the second amine using an “unloading assay” ( Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ... Ebony, a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase for beta-alanine conjugation with biogenic amines in Drosophila J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this assay ( Figure S3 F), [ 3 H]β-alanine is reacted with SmNRPS to generate a [3H]β-alanine-NRPS intermediate by the adenylation and covalent conjugation in the T domain. Then, various amines were added to the enzyme to determine whether they can displace the tritiated moiety from the enzyme. We observed that all 20 common amino acids, various monoamines/polyamines, and epinephrine possessed little activity in this assay. However, several monoamine neurotransmitters including histamine, serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine were all capable of displacing >50% of [3H]β-alanyl moiety from the loaded enzyme ( Figure 4 G). Similar to Ebony ( Hartwig et al., 2014 18. Hartwig, S. ∙ Dovengerds, C. ∙ Herrmann, C. ... Drosophila Ebony: a novel type of nonribosomal peptide synthetase related enzyme with unusually fast peptide bond formation kinetics FEBS J. 2014; 281 :5147-5158 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ... Ebony, a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase for beta-alanine conjugation with biogenic amines in Drosophila J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ), mutation of the conserved thiolation site (S892) in the T domain to alanine (S892A) reduced [ 3 H]β-alanine conjugation to the enzyme by ∼90% ( Figure 4 H). These data confirm that SmNRPS is a NRPS and indicate this enzyme possesses β-alanyl-bioamine synthase activity in vitro .
Our biochemical studies suggested that SmNRPS may conjugate βAla to one or more natural monoamines in vivo . To determine the identity of the in vivo SmNRPS product, we treated paired worms with either natural βAla or 13 C-labeled βAla ( Figure 5 A). We then performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis on male extracts, searching for metabolites that possessed a +3-Da mass shift in extracts from the [ 13 C3]βAla-labeled worms. These studies identified a metabolite ( Figure 5 B) corresponding to the molecular weight of BATT ( Figure 5 C) that was shifted +3 Da in extracts from [ 13 C3]βAla labeled worms. LC-MS analysis of an unloading assay mixture with tryptamine confirmed that this ion from schistosome extracts was BATT ( Figure S4 A). Importantly, we did not find any evidence of [ 13 C3]βAla incorporation into molecules with masses corresponding to other β-alanyl-bioamines (e.g., β-alanyl-dopamine, -histamine, -serotonin, etc.) that SmNRPS generates in vitro ( Figure 4 G). The incorporation of [ 13 C3]βAla into BATT was only observed in male parasites ( Figure 5 D), and this ion was not observed in extracts from paired female worms ( Figure S4 B). To determine if the production of BATT in male worms was dependent on Sm-nrps expression, we performed RNAi studies along with LC-MS analyses ( Figure 5 E). We found that RNAi of either gli1 or Sm-nrps blocked the ability of worms to incorporate [ 13 C3]βAla into BATT by >90% ( Figure 5 F) and abolished total BATT levels ( Figure S4 C). Taken together, our data suggest BATT to be the physiologically relevant product of SmNRPS in male worms.
Using chemically synthesized BATT as a standard, we next quantified naturally occurring BATT levels in paired and unpaired male worms. As suggested by the expression of Sm-nrps ( Figure 2 C), we only detected high levels of BATT in samples from paired male worms ( Figure 5 G). In principle, BATT could act either as an endogenous factor in males required for them to promote female development or BATT could be released from male worms to act directly on females. To explore these possibilities, we cultured paired male worms or isolated male or female worms and quantified BATT levels in media after 48 h of culture. BATT was not detected in media conditioned by virgin male, virgin female, or male worms that had been separated from females 3 days prior to the experiment ( Figure 5 H). In contrast, media conditioned by males continuously paired with female worms contained an average of 16.6 ng/mL (71 nM) BATT ( Figure 5 H). Interestingly, male worms separated from females on day 0 of the experiment released ∼70% less BATT into the media than males that remained continuously paired ( Figure 5 H), indicating that, like Sm-nrps expression ( Figure 2 E), BATT production drops rapidly in the absence of female worms. In summary, our data suggest that SmNRPS induction upon pairing results in the production of BATT, and this molecule is released from the male worm into the environment.
The secretion of BATT from male worms suggested that BATT may act to directly stimulate female development. To examine this possibility, we first evaluated the effects of low concentration BATT on female gene expression after short-term treatment. Our previous RNA-seq studies ( Figure S2 ; Table S3 ) identified genes upregulated and downregulated in female worms postpairing whose regulation was dependent on gli1 function in male worms. We selected two such genes for analysis: a rotund (Smp_169260) homolog that was induced in females only when paired with gli1 + males and Sm-nrps that was downregulated in females postpairing with gli1 + males ( Figure 6 A). Treatment of separated females for 24 h with 0.5 μM synthetic BATT induced both a significant decrease in Sm-nrps mRNA and an increase in rotund mRNA ( Figure 6 B) when compared with controls treated with βAla alone. The magnitude of the transcriptional changes of Sm-nrps and rotund following BATT treatment were comparable in magnitude with those resulting from pairing with male worms ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
Encouraged by the gene expression changes induced by BATT, we evaluated its effects on virgin female development. Strikingly, virgin female schistosomes commenced egg production with ≥0.5 μM BATT as early as 4 days after initial treatment ( Figures 6 C and 6D). No egg production was observed with βAla treatment or 50 nM BATT ( Figure 6 C). This latter result is consistent with the observation that conditioned media that contained ∼70 nM BATT also failed to induce sexual development ( Figure S4 D). Examination of virgin females treated with ≥0.5 μM BATT found that they produced mature Fast Blue BB + vitellocytes and possessed ovaries that contained mature oocytes ( Figures 6 E, S5 A, and S5B). Indeed, examination of the expression of the vitellocyte-specific marker p48 and the oocyte-specific marker bmpg confirmed that BATT treatment induces maturation of the female reproductive machinery ( Figure S5 C). We observed similar female stimulatory activity using two batches of synthetic BATT (mcBATT and swBATT), confirming the specificity of this effect ( Figures 6 C, S5 A, and S6 B). The rate of egg production following BATT treatment was lower than that induced by male:female pairing ( Figure 6 C), and only about 16% of BATT-treated females contained bmpg + ovaries despite visible ovary differentiation ( Figure S5 C). These differences may indicate either that some feature of pairing is required for the complete egg laying phenomenon in addition to BATT or, alternatively, that a simple addition of BATT to the medium is not as effective as localized delivery.
To further evaluate the effects of BATT on female development, we performed RNA-seq analyses comparing virgin females at D8 following treatment with 5 μm BATT or βAla ( Table S4 ). We then selected the 89 most differentially regulated genes (log 2 fold change ±2, adjusted p < 0.05) following BATT treatment and evaluated how these genes were regulated in virgin versus sexually mature worms using a previously collected dataset (see key resources table ). Remarkably, of the 87 of 89 genes that were upregulated or downregulated following BATT treatment were similarly regulated in sexually mature versus virgin worms ( Figures 6 F and S6 A). We next queried where these 89 BATT-regulated genes were expressed on our single-cell RNA-seq atlas ( Wendt et al., 2020 53. Wendt, G. ∙ Zhao, L. ∙ Chen, R. ... A single-cell RNA-seq atlas of Schistosoma mansoni identifies a key regulator of blood feeding Science. 2020; 369 :1644-1649 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with BATT stimulating development of the sexual organs, roughly 60% of BATT-regulated genes were most highly expressed in cell clusters associated with late stages of development of the ovary and vitellaria (“late female germ cells” and “differentiated vitellaria,” Figure S6 B). Taken together, these data highlight that BATT induces molecular changes associated with female sexual development.
BATT treatment elicited egg production in virgin female worms several days faster than pairing with virgin male worms ( Figure 6 D), suggesting that it may take several days before virgin male worms can produce sufficient quantities of BATT to stimulate female development. Previous studies have shown that in vitro pairing with castrated male worm segments can induce virgin females to lay eggs that contain parthenogenic embryos capable of limited development ( Wang et al., 2019 49. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Collins, J.J. Systematically improved in vitro culture conditions reveal new insights into the reproductive biology of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000254 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Examination of the eggs produced by BATT-treated virgin females found that these eggs ( Figure 6 G) possessed a lateral spine characteristic of S. mansoni eggs ( Figure S5 D) and that a small fraction of these eggs (∼5%) contained clusters of proliferative EdU + embryonic cells ( Figure 6 H). Together, these data support the model that BATT can replace a male partner to trigger egg production.

Section: Discussion

The data presented here indicate that male:female pairing induces the GLI1-dependent expression of Sm-nrps in male worms, resulting in the production of BATT. BATT is then released from the male to act as a pheromone that stimulates female sexual development ( Figure 7 ). This implies that males first “sense” the presence of the female to commence BATT production and that females possess the necessary signaling machinery to interpret the presence of BATT.
Pairing with amputated male worm segments induces development of female reproductive organs only in regions in direct contract with the male worm ( Popiel and Basch, 1984 34. Popiel, I. ∙ Basch, P.F. Reproductive development of female Schistosoma mansoni (Digenea: Schistosomatidae) following bisexual pairing of worms and worm segments J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 232 :141-150 Crossref Scopus (87) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019 49. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Collins, J.J. Systematically improved in vitro culture conditions reveal new insights into the reproductive biology of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000254 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). So, if BATT is diffusible into the medium ( Figure 5 H), why does it not stimulate the development of regions not in contact with male worms? We find that single paired male worms can condition media with BATT to a concentration of ∼70 nM over 48 h and that this conditioned media cannot induce virgin female sexually maturity ( Figure S4 D). Similar concentrations of synthetic BATT are also not sufficient to stimulate virgin female development ( Figures 6 C, S5 A, and S5B). Since the volume of the gynecophoral canal, where males probably release BATT, is much smaller than the total culture volumes for these experiments, the local BATT concentrations female experience while paired are probably in the micromolar range in which BATT induces development.
Ciliated neurons play numerous roles in sensory perception in animals ( Singla and Reiter, 2006 40. Singla, V. ∙ Reiter, J.F. The primary cilium as the cell's antenna: signaling at a sensory organelle Science. 2006; 313 :629-633 Crossref Scopus (884) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the expression of Sm-nrps in ciliated neurons on the male’s ventral surface suggests the possibility that these cells are critical for detecting the presence of the female and in turn stimulating BATT production. Interestingly, studies in C. elegans have demonstrated that ciliated sensory neurons can release material into the environment enclosed in exosome-like vesicles ( Wang et al., 2014b 50. Wang, J. ∙ Silva, M. ∙ Haas, L.A. ... C. elegans ciliated sensory neurons release extracellular vesicles that function in animal communication Curr. Biol. 2014; 24 :519-525 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ). This observation, along with the fact adult schistosomes produce exosome-like vesicles ( Sotillo et al., 2016 41. Sotillo, J. ∙ Pearson, M. ∙ Potriquet, J. ... Extracellular vesicles secreted by Schistosoma mansoni contain protein vaccine candidates Int. J. Parasitol. 2016; 46 :1-5 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that vesicles have been observed in adult schistosome sensory cilia ( Hockley, 1973 21. Hockley, D.J. Ultrastructure of the tegument of Schistosoma Adv. Parasitol. 1973; 11 :233-305 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morris and Threadgold, 1967 30. Morris, G.P. ∙ Threadgold, L.T. A presumed sensory structure associated with the tegument of Schistosoma mansoni J. Parasitol. 1967; 53 :537-539 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggests that Sm-nrps + neurons could be responsible not only for the perception of the female but also for the release of BATT into the environment.
NRPS enzymes are widely found in bacteria and fungi where they produce secondary metabolites that can act as toxins, pigments, siderophores, and antibiotics ( Süssmuth and Mainz, 2017 45. Süssmuth, R.D. ∙ Mainz, A. Nonribosomal peptide synthesis-principles and prospects Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2017; 56 :3770-3821 Crossref Scopus (573) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, relatively few NRPS enzymes have been characterized in animals ( Shou et al., 2016 39. Shou, Q. ∙ Feng, L. ∙ Long, Y. ... A hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide in nematodes that promotes larval survival Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; 12 :770-772 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ; Torres and Schmidt, 2019 46. Torres, J.P. ∙ Schmidt, E.W. The biosynthetic diversity of the animal world J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :17684-17692 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2014a 48. Wang, H. ∙ Fewer, D.P. ∙ Holm, L. ... Atlas of nonribosomal peptide and polyketide biosynthetic pathways reveals common occurrence of nonmodular enzymes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :9259-9264 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ), and thus, their potential roles in metazoan biology remains largely unexplored. Perhaps, the best characterized metazoan NRPS enzyme is Ebony, which is critical for Drosophila cuticle pigmentation ( Wright, 1987 55. Wright, T.R. The genetics of biogenic amine metabolism, sclerotization, and melanization in Drosophila melanogaster Adv. Genet. 1987; 24 :127-222 Crossref Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ) and neurotransmission ( Borycz et al., 2002 4. Borycz, J. ∙ Borycz, J.A. ∙ Loubani, M. ... tan and ebony genes regulate a novel pathway for transmitter metabolism at fly photoreceptor terminals J. Neurosci. 2002; 22 :10549-10557 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike NRPS enzymes in bacteria and fungi, Ebony is not thought to produce any biologically active molecules but rather inactivate them. For instance, histamine is a key neurotransmitter in the visual system and is deactivated and recycled by its conversion to β-alanyl-histamine (carcinine) by Ebony in glial cells ( Borycz et al., 2012 3. Borycz, J. ∙ Borycz, J.A. ∙ Edwards, T.N. ... The metabolism of histamine in the Drosophila optic lobe involves an ommatidial pathway: β-alanine recycles through the retina J. Exp. Biol. 2012; 215 :1399-1411 Crossref Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ; Stenesen et al., 2015 44. Stenesen, D. ∙ Moehlman, A.T. ∙ Krämer, H. The carcinine transporter CarT is required in Drosophila photoreceptor neurons to sustain histamine recycling Elife. 2015; 4 :e10972 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ziegler et al., 2013 56. Ziegler, A.B. ∙ Brüsselbach, F. ∙ Hovemann, B.T. Activity and coexpression of Drosophila black with ebony in fly optic lobes reveals putative cooperative tasks in vision that evade electroretinographic detection J. Comp. Neurol. 2013; 521 :1207-1224 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast to flies, our data suggest that the SmNRPS product BATT directly stimulates signaling in the female, culminating in female development. Since BATT has not previously been recognized as a signaling molecule, the nature of the signaling pathway(s) that mediates its effect, and whether they are related to pathways characterized in other metazoa, remains unclear.
Interestingly, genes for SmNRPS-like proteins with A domains potentially selective for β-alanine are found not only in insects and in all schistosome species that infect humans but also in the genomes of free-living and parasitic flatworms, rotifers, annelids, cnidarians, and at least one hemichordate ( Figure S7 ; Table S5 ). Thus, BATT-like molecules may participate in cellular signaling in diverse invertebrate organisms to regulate diverse processes. Because schistosomes are the only major group of dioecious flatworms, the presence of SmNRPS in hermaphroditic flatworms is intriguing. Should SmNRPS enzymes in hermaphroditic flatworms produce BATT-like molecules necessary for development of the female reproductive system, it would suggest that, during the transition from hermaphroditism to dioecy, SmNRPS product formation was “outsourced” to the male where it could act as a pheromone, rather than an endogenous hormone, to dictate the timing of female development. Clearly, exploring SmNRPS function not just in flatworms but in a variety of metazoa may uncover more paradigms for cell-to-cell, or even animal-to-animal, communication.
BATT is capable of inducing egg production in virgin females days before females paired with virgin males ( Figure 6 D) and inducing transcriptional changes associated with sexual development ( Figure 6 F). However, the rate of egg production, the quality of eggs, and the sexual development induced by BATT (especially with the ovary) were inferior to those induced by intact male worms ( Figures 6 C, S5 A, and S5B). Thus, BATT may act in parallel with other factors to support robust female development. One possible explanation is that BATT is a key signal to initiate development; however, the male worms provide additional factors key for optimal development. Indeed, radiolabeling studies have suggested that male worms transfer molecules such as glucose ( Conford and Huot, 1981 9. Conford, E.M. ∙ Huot, M.E. Glucose transfer from male to female schistosomes Science. 1981; 213 :1269-1271 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ) and cholesterol ( Haseeb et al., 1985 19. Haseeb, M.A. ∙ Eveland, L.K. ∙ Fried, B. The uptake, localization and transfer of [4–14C]cholesterol in Schistosoma mansoni males and females maintained in vitro Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1985; 82 :421-423 Crossref Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ; Popiel and Basch, 1986 35. Popiel, I. ∙ Basch, P.F. Schistosoma mansoni: cholesterol uptake by paired and unpaired worms Exp. Parasitol. 1986; 61 :343-347 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ) to female worms. Also, since immune signals are important for optimal female development ( Davies et al., 2001 12. Davies, S.J. ∙ Grogan, J.L. ∙ Blank, R.B. ... Modulation of blood fluke development in the liver by hepatic CD4 + lymphocytes Science. 2001; 294 :1358-1361 Crossref Scopus (133) PubMed Google Scholar ), there may be host factors that potentiate the response to BATT. Alternatively, females may perceive pairing with a male and alter their behavior or metabolism in a BATT-independent manner. However, another possibility is that BATT is packaged (for instance, in vesicles or with a cofactor) and delivered from males in a manner optimal for female BATT recognition or absorption. Clearly, more detailed assessments of the similarities between paired females and those treated with BATT will provide additional insights into the mechanisms that ensure robust female development.
Nearly a century ago, Aura Severinghaus detailed the role of the male schistosome in female development and offered that “it is conceivable that hormones produced by the male may in some way be connected to the phenomenon ”( Severinghaus, 1928 38. Severinghaus, A.E. Sex studies on Schistosoma japonicum Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1928; 71 :653-702 Google Scholar ). Our studies identify BATT as a male-derived pheromone that stimulates sexual development in female schistosomes. These observations provide key insights into one of the longest-standing mysteries in schistosome biology and suggest that therapeutically blocking BATT signaling could present an opportunity to blunt both schistosome transmission and egg-induced pathology. SmNRPS is a clear target, but the identification of BATT also permits study of its receptor and downstream signaling in females. Studies of this pathway both in schistosomes and other metazoa may elucidate additional cellular signaling mechanisms as well as targets for therapeutic intervention.
BATT is a pheromone released from males that induces female S. mansoni sexual development. However, important questions remain. First, it is unclear how BATT is released from male worms and how and where it acts on female worms. Our data suggest that SmNRPS is expressed in ciliated neurons present on the ventral side of male and that sensory cilia are present on the male ventral surface, but technical limitations have prohibited our ability to definitively show these ventral sensory cells are the source of BATT for release. Second, our work has only focused on a single species of schistosome; hence, it is not clear how generalizable our results are to other species. However, studies in S. japonicum have shown that NRPS is induced in males upon coupling with a female ( Lu et al., 2019 29. Lu, Z. ∙ Spänig, S. ∙ Weth, O. ... Males, the wrongly neglected partners of the biologically unprecedented male-female interaction of schistosomes Front. Genet. 2019; 10 :796 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2017 51. Wang, J. ∙ Yu, Y. ∙ Shen, H. ... Dynamic transcriptomes identify biogenic amines and insect-like hormonal regulation for mediating reproduction in Schistosoma japonicum Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14693 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Also, studies have shown that males of one schistosome species can induce the sexual development of females of another ( Armstrong, 1965 1. Armstrong, J.C. Mating behavior and development of schistosomes in the mouse J. Parasitol. 1965; 51 :605-616 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, it is reasonable to assume that the effects of BATT are generalizable. However, given the promiscuity of SmNRPS for various monoamines ( Figure 4 G), it remains possible that some schistosome species, of which there are hundreds that infect mammals and birds, generate species-specific BATT-like molecules. This could be a strategy in regions endemic to multiple species to ensure sexual reproduction only occurs with mates capable of producing viable offspring.

S. mansoni is the Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) strain provided by the NIAID Schistosomiasis Resource Center at the Biomedical Research Institute (BRI) (Rockville, MD). Infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails (NMRI) and infected mice (Swiss-Webster female mice) were received on a regular basis for parasite recovery and in-house life cycle maintenance. Adult S. mansoni were perfused from the hepatic portal vein of mice 6-7 weeks after infection. 37 °C DMEM (Fisher Scientific MT10014CV, NH, USA) with 5% horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich H1138, MO, USA) and heparin was used as perfusion solution. Recovered parasites were washed several times with perfusion solution before culture in BM169 media ( Basch, 1981 2. Basch, P.F. Cultivation of Schistosoma mansoni in vitro . I. Establishment of cultures from cercariae and development until pairing J. Parasitol. 1981; 67 :179-185 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ) supplemented with 1 × Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Sigma-Aldrich A5955, MO, USA). Worm pairs were harvested from mice infected with pooled cercaria shed by several B. glabrata snails each parasitized with more than 5 miracidia, ensuring a mixed pool of the two sexes. Parasites derived from such infections are referred to as “Mixed Sex”. “Virgin” parasites were harvested from mice infected with cercaria shed by a single snail parasitized by a single miracidium. Adult males which were unpaired for more than 3 days or virgins from single miracidia infections were considered “unpaired”. For regular maintenance, parasites were cultivated in cell culture petri dishes/plates with ∼0.5 mL media per worm (pair) at 37°C in 5% CO 2 . Due to the slow metabolism rate of virgin females, ∼0.15 mL media/worm was used. Media was changed every other day unless mentioned otherwise. For experiments monitoring reproduction and sexual development, parasites were cultured in ABC169 media ( Wang et al., 2019 49. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Collins, J.J. Systematically improved in vitro culture conditions reveal new insights into the reproductive biology of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000254 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). dsRNA treatment was performed in BM169 unless described otherwise. To separate worm pairs, worms were suspended in BM169 with 0.25% tricaine (Sigma-Aldrich A5040, MO, USA) and agitated for 5 min. Unpaired worms were processed further or washed 2X in BM169 and returned to culture.
6-8 week old female Swiss-Webster mice ( Mus musculus ) of were infected with cercaria by tail exposure and perfused 6-7 weeks later. Mouse infections were performed either in-house or by BRI. Experiments with and care of mice were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of UT Southwestern Medical Center (approval APN: 2017-102092).
B. glabrata snails of NMRI strain were maintained in artificial pond water (0.125 mg/L FeCl 3 ⋅6H 2 O, 32 mg/L CaCl 2 ⋅2H 2 O, 25 mg/mL MgSO 4 ⋅7H 2 O in pH 7.2 phosphate buffer) and fed with 16% layer chicken feed. For snail infections, livers harvested from “Mixed sex” infected mice were blended and resuspended artificial pond water to liberate miracidia from eggs. Released miracidia were incubated with snails for either “Mixed sex” or “Virgin” infections for 3h and then cultured in artificial pond water until patency.
dsRNA production and RNAi treatment were essentially performed as previously described ( Collins et al., 2010 6. Collins, J.J. ∙ Hou, X. ∙ Romanova, E.V. ... Genome-wide analyses reveal a role for peptide hormones in planarian germline development PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 :e1000509 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar , 2013 8. Collins, J.J. ∙ Wang, B. ∙ Lambrus, B.G. ... Adult somatic stem cells in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni Nature. 2013; 494 :476-479 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oligo sequences used to generate dsRNA templates are listed in Table S6 . A dsRNA derived from two bacterial genes was used as a negative control for all RNAi experiments ( Collins et al., 2010 6. Collins, J.J. ∙ Hou, X. ∙ Romanova, E.V. ... Genome-wide analyses reveal a role for peptide hormones in planarian germline development PLoS Biol. 2010; 8 :e1000509 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). D0 represents the first day of the experiment.
For RNAi screening, virgin females were treated with 30 μg/mL dsRNA on D0 in BM169 and then paired with male parasites from D1 onwards in ABC169. Media was supplemented with an additional 30 μg/mL dsRNA on D1/2/6/10 until D14 where phenotypes were monitored. For RNAi treatment of either virgin male or female worms, the unpaired worms were treated with 30 μg/mL dsRNA in BM169 media for one week. After a week, opposite sex worms were added in fresh BM169. The following day, BM169 was replaced by ABC169 for the duration of the experiment. For RNAi experiments in Figures 1 D, 1E, 2 A, and 2B (RNAseq), Figures 3 D, 5 F, and S4 C, negative control, gli1 or Sm-nrps dsRNA was added on D0/1/2/3 with fresh media and followed by media change every other day until pairing; for experiments in Figures 3 B and 3C, dsRNAs were added every day with media change before pairing. In cases where egg output was quantified, existing eggs were removed from the culture during the last media change (D12 post pairing). Two days later, egg number and the number of female parasites was counted to calculate egg/female/day.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) ( Collins et al., 2013 8. Collins, J.J. ∙ Wang, B. ∙ Lambrus, B.G. ... Adult somatic stem cells in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni Nature. 2013; 494 :476-479 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ), Fast Blue BB, DAPI, and EdU labeling ( Wang et al., 2019 49. Wang, J. ∙ Chen, R. ∙ Collins, J.J. Systematically improved in vitro culture conditions reveal new insights into the reproductive biology of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni PLoS Biol. 2019; 17 :e3000254 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) were performed as previously described. Riboprobes were synthesized from templates generated using primers listed in Table S6 . Non-quantitative phenotypes were evaluated by reporting the fraction of worms with a given phenotype/total number of worms examined.
For RNAseq analysis of gli1 RNAi-treated worms, dsRNA treatment was performed on male worms for a week at 30 μg/mL, and these male worms were either co-cultured with virgin female parasites separated by 40 μm cell strainers (Fisher Scientific 22-363-547, NH, USA) or allowed to pair for three days in ABC169. Each of the three biological replicates included worms pooled from three technical replicates. Following three days of pairing, worms were separated with 0.25% tricaine in BM169 and collected in Trizol. RNA was extracted using Zymo Direct-zol kit (Genesee Scientific 11-331, CA, USA). The samples were then prepared by Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA library kit. All 24 samples were sequenced with one flow cell on Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer with 78bp read lengths. Reads were mapped with STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 13. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ) and data were analyzed using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 26. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). Raw and processed data have been deposited in NCBI (GSE184849).
For RNAseq analysis of BATT-treated virgin females, virgin female parasites in six-well plates were separated from equal number of virgin males by 40 μm cell strainer. 5 μM BATT or βAla was refreshed every other day with fresh ABC169 media from day0. On day8, females were processed for RNAseq as above. Each of the three biological replicates included worms pooled from two technical replicates. RNA was extracted same as described above. The samples were then prepared using the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA library kit. All samples were sequenced on one flow cell on an Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer with 78bp read lengths. Raw and processed data have been deposited in NCBI (GSE191062). Heatmaps were generated with variance stabilized transformed counts using heatmap in R. The post-pairing transcriptome change analyses were performed from publicly-available pair-ended RNAseq data from virgin (single sex) and sexually mature (mixed sex) females (WormBase ParaSite). The accession numbers of the three single sex female biological replicates and the three mixed sex female biological replicates are in the key resources table .
For qPCR analyses, worms were collected in 150 μL Trizol, homogenized, and RNA was extracted using Zymo Direct-zol kit and reverse transcribed with iScript (Bio-rad 1708891, CA, USA). Real time quantitative PCR was performed using FAST SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-rad 1725122, CA, USA) on a QuantStudio3 real-time PCR system (Fisher Scientific, NH, USA). cytochrome c (Smp_900000) was used as an endogenous control for normalization. The data were analyzed by Applied biosystems on the Thermo Fisher Cloud (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).
Freshly perfused male worms were rocked gently in BM169 containing 0.25% tricaine for 5 min and beheaded under a light microscope. To relax the male trunks such that the ventral surface was exposed for viewing by SEM, the trunk pieces were then rocked in a gradient of MgCl 2 diluted in BM169 containing 0.25% tricaine as follows: 0.12 M MgCl 2 for 30 min, 0.18 M MgCl 2 for 20 min, 0.3 M MgCl 2 for 5 min and 0.6 M MgCl 2 for 1 min). After fixation in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, worms were further fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer overnight at 4 °C. After three rinses in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, they were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 hours. Worms were rinsed with water and dehydrated with increasing concentration of ethanol, followed by increasing concentrations of hexamethyldisilazane in ethanol. Worms were air dried under the hood, mounted on SEM stubs with the ventral surface facing up and sputter coated with gold/palladium in a Cressington 108 auto sputter coater. Images were acquired with a Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (Zeiss Sigma, Jena, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 10kV.
SmNRPS or Ebony were expressed in Sf9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, MA, USA). Codon-optimized DNA of SmNRPS (Genescript, NJ, USA) or original cDNA of Ebony was cloned into pFastBac1 with a His 6 tag, a StrepII tag and a TEV site before the N terminus. Third pass virus (40 mL) was used to infect 1L of Sf9 cells at 2-2.5 × 10 6 cells/mL. After 72h, cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at -80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and lysed with 60 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1% Triton X-100, 0.024 mg/mL DNase, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, Sigma cOmplete protease inhibitor (2 tablet/100 ml) and 10% glycerol for 1 h shaking at 4 °C. The following steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Lysates were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 50 min. The supernatant was supplemented with 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0) and incubated with 3 mL equilibrated Qiagen Ni-NTA agarose (50% suspension in lysis buffer) with rotation for at least 1.5 h. The resin was centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min, resuspended with 10 mL supernatant and loaded to a glass chromatography column. The resin was washed with Buffer 1 (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.05% Triton X-100, 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 1 μg/mL aprotinin, 2 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.2 mM PMSF and 10% glycerol until A 280 in the eluate returned to baseline, followed by Buffer 1 supplemented with 450 mM NaCl and 20mM imidazole. Protein was eluted with Buffer 1 containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions containing SmNRPS were pooled and applied to a column of 0.9 mL Strep-Tactin Sepharose resin (Fisher Scientific NC9891255, NH, USA) that had been pre-equilibrated with the Ni-NTA elution buffer. The column was washed with 8 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol. SmNRPS was eluted in the same buffer but with only 150 mM NaCl and with 10 mM desthiobiotin. The first 1.8 mL elution was performed immediately. The column was left overnight in 1.8 mL elution buffer followed by elution with 4 more 1.8 mL fractions. Most of the SmNRPS was concentrated in the second fraction. Fractions containing SmNRPS or Ebony according to Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 and 3 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol) and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by comparison with BSA standards on the same gel.
The ATP/PP i exchange and βAla unloading assays were adapted from previously reported methods ( Hartwig et al., 2014 18. Hartwig, S. ∙ Dovengerds, C. ∙ Herrmann, C. ... Drosophila Ebony: a novel type of nonribosomal peptide synthetase related enzyme with unusually fast peptide bond formation kinetics FEBS J. 2014; 281 :5147-5158 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ; Richardt et al., 2003 37. Richardt, A. ∙ Kemme, T. ∙ Wagner, S. ... Ebony, a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase for beta-alanine conjugation with biogenic amines in Drosophila J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :41160-41166 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the exchange assay, each reaction contained 100 μL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP, 50 μM [ 32 P]PP i (0.11 cpm/fmol), 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 μM enzyme and 0.2 mM of the stated amino acid(s). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and quenched with a 1 mL ice cold 1.7% activated charcoal slurry (Millipore Sigma 53663, MA, USA) in 0.1 M Na 4 PPi and 0.56 M HClO 4 . Samples were centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min and the charcoal pellet was washed twice with 1 mL of 5 μM Na 4 PP i . Charcoal pellets were resuspended with 0.5 mL deionized water and radioactivity was monitored by scintillation counting.
The unloading assay involves two reaction steps, loading and unloading. In the loading step, 0.25 μM enzyme was first incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a loading cocktail of 1 mM ATP, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 μM βAla and 10 μCi/mL [ 3 H]βAla (American Radiolabeled Chemicals ART 0205, MO, USA). This mixture was chilled on ice. The unloading reaction was initiated by adding 2.22 μL of 100 μM amine to 20 μL of the loading reaction incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was then placed on ice, 15 μL of 2.5% (w/v) BSA was added, and protein was precipitated on ice with 10% (w/v) chilled trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min, the solution was transferred to a 1.5 mL conical tube, and centrifuged for 15 min at ∼12,000 rpm. The pellet was washed twice with 1 mL of 10% (w/v) chilled trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in 200 μL formic acid, and subjected to scintillation counting. Note that only 2-10% of the enzyme could be loaded with βAla in the initial loading step. This may reflect either inefficient covalent addition of the phosphopantetheinate cofactor in the Sf9 cells ( Hartwig et al., 2014 18. Hartwig, S. ∙ Dovengerds, C. ∙ Herrmann, C. ... Drosophila Ebony: a novel type of nonribosomal peptide synthetase related enzyme with unusually fast peptide bond formation kinetics FEBS J. 2014; 281 :5147-5158 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ), partial denaturation of the enzyme or erroneous estimation of enzyme concentration based on Coomassie Blue staining. Regardless, amounts of loaded enzyme at time zero was normalized to the water unloading control within the same experiment ( Figures 4 G and 4H).
For stable heavy isotope tracing, [ 13 C3]βAla (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories clm-8755-PK, MA, USA) or normal βAla (Sigma-Aldrich 146064, MO, USA) were added to ABC169 media at 1 mM final concentration and refreshed every other day during media changes for 7 days. Samples of 30 male or female worms were rinsed twice in PBS, flash frozen in liquid N 2 , and homogenized in 1 mL ice-cold 80% methanol in water (vol/vol) using an ultrasonicator (30 s × 3 times at the highest setting). Homogenates were vortexed and 200 μL was diluted in 800 μL ice-cold 80% methanol. This mixture was vortexed again (1 min), centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to new tube, dried overnight using a SpeedVac, and stored at -80 °C. The in vitro reaction mix used for the retention time reference of BATT contained 100 μL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 25 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM βAla, 0.25 mM tryptamine, 5 μM SmNRPS protein and 1 mM ATP. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2.5 h, then added with 1 mL ice-cold 80% methanol, vortexed for 1 min, centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dried to a pellet with a SpeedVac and resuspended in 100 μL deionized H2O.
Metabolite analysis data acquisition was performed by reverse-phase chromatography on a 1290 UHPLC liquid chromatography (LC) system interfaced to a high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The MS was operated in both positive and negative (ESI+ and ESI-) modes. Analytes were separated on an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 column (1.8 μm, 2.1 x 150 mm, Waters, MA, USA). The column was kept at room temperature. Mobile phase A composition was 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B composition was 0.1% formic acid in 100% ACN. The LC gradient was 0 min: 1% B; 5 min: 5% B; 15 min: 99% B; 23 min: 99% B; 24 min: 1% B; 25 min: 1% B. The flow rate was 250 μL/min. The sample injection volume was 5 μL. ESI source conditions were set as follows: dry gas temperature 225 °C and flow 18 L/min, fragmentor voltage 175 V, sheath gas temperature 350 °C and flow 12 L/min, nozzle voltage 500 V, and capillary voltage +3500 V in positive mode and -3500 V in negative. The instrument was set to acquire over the full m/z range of 40-1700 in both modes, with the MS acquisition rate of 1 spectrum s -1 in profile format. When quantification was required, both samples and BATT concentration standards were spiked with same amount of tryptophan-d5 as the internal standard.
Raw data files (.d) were processed using Profinder B.08.00 SP3 software (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) with an in-house database containing retention time and accurate mass information on 600 standards from Mass Spectrometry Metabolite Library (IROA Technologies, MA, USA) which was created under the same analysis conditions. The in-house database matching parameters were: mass tolerance 10 ppm; retention time tolerance 0.5 min; coelution coefficient 0.5. Peak integration result was manually curated in Profinder for improved consistency and exported as a spreadsheet (.csv).
One worm or worm pair were placed in one well of a 96 well plate with 150 μL ABC169 for two days. Worm pairs were either freshly perfused, freshly separated or separated for 3 days prior to experiment set up. Negative control contained only ABC169 medium. After 48 hours, 100 μL media from each well were sampled and mixed with 100 μL methanol containing 0.2% formic acid. The mixtures were vortexed for 15 s, incubated for 10 min at RT and centrifuged at ∼18000 g for 5 min. 150 μL supernatant was removed to a clean tube and stored at -20 °C. Before analysis, tryptophan-d5 was spiked into the samples as an internal standard. The negative control contained only ABC169 medium. In some experiments, media conditioned by paired worms was collected to evaluate virgin female development. For these experiments, ∼10 virgin females were cultured in 1 mL of 48 h pair conditioned media. Every other day, conditioned media was refreshed with media freshly conditioned by worm pairs of the previous 48 hours. Such worms were cultured alongside BATT (5 μM) or mock treated virgin females and harvested at day 14.
The BATT concentration was measured in conditioned media by LC-MS/MS using an AB Sciex (Framingham, MA, USA) 6500+ QTRAP® mass spectrometer coupled to a Shimadzu (Columbia, MD, USA) Prominence LC. BATT was detected in positive MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) mode by following the precursor to fragment ion transitions of 231.8 to 185.2 (qualifier ion). An Agilent C18 XDB column (5 μm, 50 x 4.6 mm) was used for chromatography with the following conditions: Buffer A: H20 + 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B: MeOH + 0.1% formic acid; 0–1.5 min 3% B (97% A); 1.5–3.5 min gradient to 100% B (0% A); 3.5-4.5 min 3% B (97% A). Tryptophan-d5 (transition 210.206 to 192.400) was used as internal standard. Concentrations of BATT were determined by comparison to a standard curve prepared by spiking synthetic BATT in DMSO into ABC169 followed by standard sample processing. A limit of detection was defined as a level three times that observed in blank media and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) as the lowest point on the standard curve that gave an analyte signal above the LOD and within 20% of nominal upon back-calculation. The LOQ for BATT was 0.5 ng/mL.
One batch of β-alanyl-tryptamine (N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)-3-aminopropanamide) was synthesized by MuseChem (Batch M21X01198, NJ, USA). We refer to this compound as mcBATT. The certificate of analysis showed the purity as 99.88% by HPLC and an ESI-MS confirmed molecular weight of 231.2 g/mol. However, the product was a green, sticky, hygroscopic solid.
We then synthesized a second batch locally (swBATT). The synthesis was a two-step sequence. Boc protected BATT (Boc-BATT, tert-Butyl (3-((2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl)amino)-3-oxopropyl)carbamate) was first synthesized as follows: i-Pr 2 NEt (1.4 mL, 8.0 mmol) was added to a solution of Boc-β-Ala-OH (1.0 g, 5.29 mmol), tryptamine (851.9 mg, 5.32 mmol) and HATU (2.42 g, 6.4 mmol) in DMF (24 mL) in a 50 mL round bottom flask. The reaction was stirred overnight and the reaction went to completion as judged by HPLC/MS analysis. Water was added to the reaction mixture, which was then extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed several times with water and then with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , filtered and condensed. The crude mixture was purified via ISCO flash chromatography in 1-10% MeOH/DCM to give 1.55 g of the Boc-BATT in 88% yield. For the second step, TFA (1.0 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of Boc-BATT (497.5 mg, 1.5 mmol) in 10 mL DCM in a scintillation vial. The reaction went to completion within 2 hours and was thereafter condensed under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was purified by reverse phase ISCO flash chromatography in 0-40% H 2 O/CH 3 CN. Fractions containing the desired product were combined and condensed on a speed vacuum (Thermo Fisher Scientific SPD1010-115, MA, USA) to give 505.4 mg of the TFA salt (98% yield). Proton NMR was performed on both Boc-BATT and the final product, swBATT, for confirmation. This product was a brown, extremely hygroscopic, oil-like compound.
Concentrated stock solutions of mcBATT or swBATT were prepared in sterile filtered deionized water and stored at < -20 °C. Because of the hygroscopic nature of both preparations and the unexpected colors, we estimated the concentration of stock solutions by UV absorbance in comparison to solutions of tryptamine after extensive dilution. Concentrated aqueous solutions of BATT displayed broad absorbance maxima above 300 nm, consistent with their appearance. Upon further dilution, the absorbance maxima sharpened and shifted to the UV such that < 1 mM BATT from either batch displayed an absorbance spectrum with a 240-300 nm spectrum essentially identical to that of tryptamine. The colors of the semi-solid and concentrated solutions thus appear to result from stacking of the indole rings. For treatment of worms, the compound was directly added into ABC169 media to achieve desired concentration. Compound was refreshed every other day with fresh media.
For RNAseq experiments, base calling was performed by Illumina cassava 1.9 software. Sequenced reads were trimmed for adaptor sequence, and masked for low-complexity or low-quality sequence, then mapped to the S. mansoni genome (v7) using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 13. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pairwise comparisons of differential gene expression were performed with DESseq2 ( Love et al., 2014 26. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). For statistical analysis of non-sequencing data, GraphPad Prism software processed and presented the data as the mean with SD. Statistical significance was calculated by unpaired two-tailed parametric t test. Unpaired ordinary one-way ANOVA was also performed in Figure 4 G. P values < 0.05 are considered significant (NS, not significant; ∗ , p < 0.05; ∗∗ , p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ , p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ , p < 0.0001).
