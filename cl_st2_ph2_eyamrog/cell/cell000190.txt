Title: pH-Gated Succinate Secretion Regulates Muscle Remodeling in Response to Exercise


Abstract: Summary

In response to skeletal muscle contraction during exercise, paracrine factors coordinate tissue remodeling, which underlies this healthy adaptation. Here we describe a pH-sensing metabolite signal that initiates muscle remodeling upon exercise. In mice and humans, exercising skeletal muscle releases the mitochondrial metabolite succinate into the local interstitium and circulation. Selective secretion of succinate is facilitated by its transient protonation, which occurs upon muscle cell acidification. In the protonated monocarboxylic form, succinate is rendered a transport substrate for monocarboxylate transporter 1, which facilitates pH-gated release. Upon secretion, succinate signals via its cognate receptor SUCNR1 in non-myofibrillar cells in muscle tissue to control muscle-remodeling transcriptional programs. This succinate-SUCNR1 signaling is required for paracrine regulation of muscle innervation, muscle matrix remodeling, and muscle strength in response to exercise training. In sum, we define a bioenergetic sensor in muscle that utilizes intracellular pH and succinate to coordinate tissue adaptation to exercise.

Section: Introduction

Skeletal muscle remodeling in response to exercise has multiple systemic health benefits in mice and humans. This muscle adaptation requires paracrine processes, including local neurotrophic signaling, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Initiation of this paracrine activity depends on upstream signals originating from contracting muscle that are poorly defined. Metabolite abundance and transport are regulated on rapid timescales that render metabolites an appropriate signaling modality for initiating rapid physiological adaptation ( Martínez-Reyes and Chandel, 2020 46. Martínez-Reyes, I. ∙ Chandel, N.S. Mitochondrial TCA cycle metabolites control physiology and disease Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :102 Crossref Scopus (1252) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mice and humans, the muscle-remodeling response begins rapidly upon acute exercise ( Ghosh et al., 2010 24. Ghosh, S. ∙ Golbidi, S. ∙ Werner, I. ...

Endocrinol. 2017; 13 :133-148 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that metabolite signals originating from exercising muscle could be essential for activating paracrine processes that control muscle remodeling.
Here we apply metabolomics approaches to mice and humans to define a metabolite pH sensor in muscle that communicates local energetic status to the paracrine tissue environment and controls tissue remodeling. We show that muscle selectively secretes the mitochondrial metabolite succinate into the muscle interstitium and circulation upon exercise. Because of its unique physiochemical properties, succinate is exported from muscle cells through acute regulation of its protonation status by local pH. When protonated, succinate is transformed from a dicarboxylate that is trapped in the cell to a monocarboxylate. In this protonated monocarboxylate form, succinate is rendered a transport substrate for the plasma membrane transporter monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), which facilitates pH-gated release. Upon pH-gated secretion during exercise, succinate signals via its cognate receptor succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1) in non-myofibrillar cells in muscle tissue to coordinate muscle remodeling. We demonstrate that muscle innervation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and increased strength initiated upon exercise depend critically on this newfound succinate-SUCNR1 signaling cascade. Moreover, we find that peak succinate concentration in the femoral vein during bicycle ergometer exercise in humans predicts post-exercise insulin sensitivity.

Section: Results and Discussion

We used a comparative metabolomics approach to determine metabolites that are selectively and locally secreted from exercising muscle in mice in vivo ( Figure 1 A; Figures S1 A and S1B; STAR Methods ). We applied acute exercise intervention, which is known to initiate muscle remodeling, improve insulin sensitivity, and provide systemic health benefits ( Ghosh et al., 2010 24. Ghosh, S. ∙ Golbidi, S. ∙ Werner, I. ... Selecting exercise regimens and strains to modify obesity and diabetes in rodents: an overview Clin. Sci.

Sylow, L. ∙ Kleinert, M. ∙ Richter, E.A. ... Exercise-stimulated glucose uptake - regulation and implications for glycaemic control Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2017; 13 :133-148 Crossref Scopus (307) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice walked on a treadmill or were subjected to a ramped running protocol until exhaustion. Following intervention, samples were rapidly isolated from the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, a major muscle engaged by treadmill running ( Henríquez-Olguin et al., 2019 30. Henríquez-Olguin, C. ∙ Knudsen, J.R. ∙ Raun, S.H. ... Cytosolic ROS production by NADPH oxidase 2 regulates muscle glucose uptake during exercise Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 :4623 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were gated on three criteria: (1) metabolite accumulation immediately post-exercise in local muscle extracellular fluid ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 A; see Figures S1 A and S1B and STAR Methods for a description of interstitial fluid isolation and quality control [QC]); (2) metabolite enrichment in muscle interstitial fluid compared with total muscle tissue ( Figure 1 C; Table S1 B); (3) local enrichment in local muscle extracellular fluid compared with bulk circulation ( Figure 1 D; Table S1 C). A single metabolite fulfilled all three criteria for a local extracellular metabolite signature of acute exercise: the mitochondrial metabolite succinate. We additionally determined the same parameters in the gastrocnemius (GA) muscle, another muscle group engaged by treadmill running, and found that succinate had a comparable signature ( Figures 1 E–1G).
We next examined whether succinate was also released by exercising muscle in humans. We recruited 25- to 35-year-old, healthy, non-obese, non-smoking men. These individuals were catheterized in the femoral artery and vein to allow local sampling of blood entering and draining from exercising muscles, as described in Kleinert et al. (2018) 39. Kleinert, M. ∙ Clemmensen, C. ∙ Sjøberg, K.A. ... Exercise increases circulating GDF15 in humans Mol. Metab. 2018; 9 :187-191 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar . Following this, individuals exercised on a bicycle ergometer for 60 min at 67% maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), with local blood collected during exercise and recovery ( Figure 1 H; Table S2 ; STAR Methods ). Muscle venous succinate concentrations rose to ∼200 μM upon exercise and then decreased rapidly upon recovery ( Figure 1 I). Notably, changes in succinate concentration were concomitant with elevations in arterial and venous lactate ( Figure S1 C). The arterial-venous difference in metabolite abundance determines whether a tissue is a net producer or consumer of a given metabolite ( Kiens et al., 1993 38. Kiens, B. ∙ Essen-Gustavsson, B. ∙ Christensen, N.J. ... Skeletal muscle substrate utilization during submaximal exercise in man: effect of endurance training J. Physiol. 1993; 469 :459-478 Crossref Scopus (360) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found a highly significant arterial-venous difference during exercise, with substantially more succinate found in exercising venous blood, indicating that exercising muscle is a source of elevated succinate ( Figure 1 J; Figure S1 D). Taken together, local and selective release of succinate by muscle is a rapid response to exercise in mice and humans.
Identification of succinate as a metabolite that is released from exercising muscle was unexpected because the plasma membrane of most mammalian cells is thought to be impermeable to mitochondrial dicarboxylates, including succinate ( Ehinger et al., 2016 19.

Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a long-standing and curious observation is that blood succinate levels are substantial and dynamic, responding to interventions like hypoxia ( Hochachka et al., 1975 33. Hochachka, P.W. ∙ Owen, T.G. ∙ Allen, J.F. ... Multiple end products of anaerobiosis in diving vertebrates Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1975; 50 :17-22 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ), exercise ( Hochachka and Dressendorfer, 1976 32. Hochachka, P.W. ∙ Dressendorfer, R.H. Succinate accumulation in man during exercise Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. Occup. Physiol. 1976; 35 :235-242 Crossref Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ), and exposure to cold temperatures ( Mills et al., 2018 50. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). In this context, because of its apparent lack of permeation through the plasma membrane, extracellular succinate is widely considered to be a proxy for cellular rupture and non-specific leakage ( Murphy and O’Neill, 2018 53. Murphy, M.P. ∙ O’Neill, L.A.J. Krebs Cycle Reimagined: The Emerging Roles of Succinate and Itaconate as Signal Transducers Cell. 2018; 174 :780-784 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (239) PubMed Google Scholar ).
However, this supposition is inconsistent with the selectivity of succinate release observed here, which precludes non-specific cell rupture ( Figure S1 E) and is indicative of a defined export mechanism for this metabolite. Succinate release into the muscle interstitium and blood was atypical compared with most mitochondrial dicarboxylates ( Figure 1 K). Based on this observation, we considered the physiochemical properties of succinate compared with other mitochondrial carboxylates ( Figures 2 A and 2B). We noted that succinate is distinct from other mitochondrial carboxylates based on its high monocarboxylic pKa ( Figure 2 A). This property would uniquely render a substantial proportion of succinate in the monocarboxylate form at the physiological pH of exercising muscle. Indeed, during exercise, muscle pH has been reported in the 6.4–6.8 range, depending on intensity and duration, and rapidly re-alkalinizes post-exercise ( Hagberg, 1985 25. Hagberg, H. Intracellular pH during ischemia in skeletal muscle: relationship to membrane potential, extracellular pH, tissue lactic acid and ATP Pflugers Arch. 1985; 404 :342-347 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robergs et al., 2004 65. Robergs, R.A. ∙ Ghiasvand, F. ∙ Parker, D. Biochemistry of exercise-induced metabolic acidosis Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp.

Effects of lactic acid accumulation and ATP decrease on muscle tension and relaxation Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240 :C121-C126 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesized that the protonated, monocarboxylic form of succinate could be the transported form during exercise ( Figure 2 C).
To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether manipulations that drive intracellular acidification are sufficient to facilitate selective release of succinate from muscle cells. Muscle acidification during exercise occurs due to elevated glycolytic lactate production to maintain cellular ATP, in part as a consequence of local hypoxia ( Hagberg, 1985 25. Hagberg, H. Intracellular pH during ischemia in skeletal muscle: relationship to membrane potential, extracellular pH, tissue lactic acid and ATP Pflugers Arch. 1985; 404 :342-347 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Robergs et al., 2004 65.

Effects of lactic acid accumulation and ATP decrease on muscle tension and relaxation Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240 :C121-C126 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, subjecting muscle cells to physiologic hypoxia increases lactate production and lowers cytosolic pH ( Bright and Ellis, 1992 5. Bright, C.M. ∙ Ellis, D. Intracellular pH changes induced by hypoxia and anoxia in isolated sheep heart Purkinje fibres Exp. Physiol. 1992; 77 :165-175 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ; Hagberg, 1985 25. Hagberg, H. Intracellular pH during ischemia in skeletal muscle: relationship to membrane potential, extracellular pH, tissue lactic acid and ATP Pflugers Arch. 1985; 404 :342-347 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, hypoxia was sufficient to selectively drive succinate release from C2C12 myotubes ( Figure 2 D). Conversely, we acutely inhibited mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which is known to elevate glycolytic flux and drive cellular acidification ( Mookerjee et al., 2015 52. Mookerjee, S.A. ∙ Goncalves, R.L.S. ∙ Gerencser, A.A. ... The contributions of respiration and glycolysis to extracellular acid production Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2015; 1847 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (252) PubMed Google Scholar ). These interventions rapidly promoted cytosolic acidification ( Figure 2 E) and concomitant selective release of succinate from muscle cells ( Figures 2 F and 2G). In parallel, we used established methods to equilibrate extracellular and cytosolic pH to clamp cytosolic pH at 6.4 (see STAR Methods for details). This intervention alone resulted in a modest increase in succinate release ( Figure S1 F). However, in combination with inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation with atpenin A5, cytosolic acidification significantly potentiated succinate release ( Figure S1 F). These findings suggest that, in addition to cytosolic acidification, a pH and succinate gradient across the plasma membrane facilitates succinate export. This supposition is examined in a later section.
To determine whether cytosolic acidification is required for succinate release under these conditions, we applied monensin, a plasma membrane Na + /H + antiporter that alkalinizes cytosolic pH ( Lin et al., 2003 41. Lin, H.J. ∙ Herman, P. ∙ Lakowicz, J.R. Fluorescence lifetime-resolved pH imaging of living cells Cytometry A. 2003; 52 :77-89 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figure 2 H). Co-incubation with monensin prevented cellular acidification by pharmacological inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure 2 I) and inhibited succinate release ( Figure 2 J). Inhibition of succinate release by monensin resulted in simultaneous accumulation of intracellular succinate ( Figure S1 G) and a further decrease in mitochondrial respiration ( Figure S1 H), indicating specific inhibition of release at the plasma membrane by this intervention. Similarly, monensin treatment during hypoxia prevented succinate release ( Figure 2 K). To examine whether pH-dependent release of succinate occurs in intact muscle, we subjected isolated muscle groups to similar acute metabolic perturbations ex vivo . We first examined whether glycolytic conditions promoting lactate production were sufficient to drive succinate release in isolated muscle. Subjecting isolated TA, EDL, and soleus muscle to high-glucose conditions was sufficient to drive succinate release ( Figure S1 I). Moreover, treatment of muscles ex vivo with atpenin A5 to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation potentiated succinate release in EDL and TA muscle ( Figure S1 I). The EDL muscle is particularly amenable to acute pharmacological perturbation ex vivo , so we examined whether inhibition of intracellular acidification affected succinate release. Remarkably, monensin treatment inhibited succinate release in EDL muscle ( Figure 2 L).
To examine the molecular basis for pH-dependent succinate release by muscle cells and muscle tissue, we determined which plasma membrane transporters are highly expressed in muscle and have the capacity to transport carboxylates. We applied proteomic mass spectrometry (MS) to TA and GA muscle, which are muscles that can export succinate ( Figure 1 E). From this comparative analysis, the annotated plasma membrane succinate transporter SLC13A3 ( Markovich and Murer, 2004 45. Markovich, D. ∙ Murer, H. The SLC13 gene family of sodium sulphate/carboxylate cotransporters Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447 :594-602 Crossref Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ) was undetectable in muscle. Instead, the only plasma membrane transporters known to transport carboxylate-containing molecules identified were MCT1 and MCT4, neither of which are thought to transport succinate ( Figure 3 A; Table S3 A).
MCT1 and MCT4 transport molecules that are structurally similar to succinate; i.e., short-chain monocarboxylates. However, MCT1 and MCT4 are strictly selective for a single carboxylate group over dicarboxylates ( Halestrap, 2012 26. Halestrap, A.P. The monocarboxylate transporter family--Structure and functional characterization IUBMB Life. 2012; 64 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on our observation of pH dependence for succinate release by muscle cells, we hypothesized that MCTs could facilitate selective release when succinate is in the protonated monocarboxylate form because of lowered intracellular pH ( Figure 3 B). Such a regulated release of succinate would utilize pH as a “gate” for its export into the extracellular space. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated reduction in MCT1, but not MCT2 or MCT4, significantly inhibited succinate release induced by pharmacological cellular acidification ( Figure 3 C; Figures S2 A–S2D). Notably, siMCT1 did not affect extracellular succinate levels in cells not subjected to cellular acidification ( Figure 3 C). Based on these findings, we treated muscle cells with established MCT1 inhibitors ( Halestrap, 2012 26. Halestrap, A.P. The monocarboxylate transporter family--Structure and functional characterization IUBMB Life. 2012; 64 :1-9 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ), all of which substantially inhibited succinate release initiated by cellular acidification ( Figures 3 D–3F; Figure S2 E). Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 in mature isolated EDL muscle tissue prevented succinate release initiated by glycolytic operation ( Figure S2 F) and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation ( Figure S2 G). Moreover, siMCT1 prevented succinate secretion initiated by hypoxia ( Figure 3 G).
We next directly examined pH-dependent transport of succinate by MCT1 by expressing the recombinant human protein in Xenopus oocytes. This system facilitates functional MCT1 expression and membrane localization and is widely used to establish its monocarboxylate transport properties ( Bröer et al., 1999 8. Bröer, S. ∙ Bröer, A. ∙ Schneider, H.P. ... Characterization of the high-affinity monocarboxylate transporter MCT2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes Biochem. J. 1999; 341 :529-535 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nancolas et al., 2015 55. Nancolas, B. ∙ Sessions, R.B. ∙ Halestrap, A.P. Identification of key binding site residues of MCT1 for AR-C155858 reveals the molecular basis of its isoform selectivity Biochem. J. 2015; 466 :177-188 Crossref Scopus (28) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that recombinant MCT1 facilitated succinate transport at pH 6.4 ( Figure 3 H; Figures S2 H and S2I). Succinate transport by MCT1 was strongly pH dependent and inhibited by the pharmacological MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 ( Figures 3 H and 3I). Notably, the kinetics of succinate transport by MCT1 in this system were lower than those observed for lactate ( Figure S2 J). These data are in line with MCT1 having a higher capacity for lactate transport over some 4-carbon monocarboxylates ( Bröer et al., 1998 7. Bröer, S. ∙ Schneider, H.P. ∙ Bröer, A. ... Characterization of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes by changes in cytosolic pH Biochem. J. 1998; 333 :167-174 Crossref Scopus (289) PubMed Google Scholar ) and therefore appear to distinguish the kinetics of MCT1-mediated succinate transport as lower in comparison with its canonical substrate. Taken together, our findings indicate that MCT1 facilitates selective release of succinate by muscle cells through a pH-gated transport mechanism ( Figure 3 B).
Having shown that muscle cells possess a mechanism for selective release of succinate and that succinate release is exercise responsive, we next considered whether this export process could initiate muscle tissue remodeling driven by exercise. We hypothesized that succinate may facilitate this type of regulation because it is an endogenous ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor SUCNR1 ( He et al., 2004 28. He, W. ∙ Miao, F.J. ∙ Lin, D.C. ... Citric acid cycle intermediates as ligands for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors Nature. 2004; 429 :188-193 Crossref Scopus (724) PubMed Google Scholar ). Local extracellular succinate levels range from less than 20 μM at rest to 60–200 μM during exercise, followed by rapid renormalization post-exercise ( Figure 1 I). The half-maximal response (EC 50 ) for succinate-induced activation of SUCNR1 is reported to be in the range of 28–56 μM, and ∼99% responses are achieved at 200 μM or higher ( He et al., 2004 28. He, W. ∙ Miao, F.J. ∙ Lin, D.C. ... Citric acid cycle intermediates as ligands for orphan G-protein-coupled receptors Nature. 2004; 429 :188-193 Crossref Scopus (724) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the local extracellular succinate concentrations achieved by exercise correlate with the dynamic regulation range of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling.
SUCNR1 agonism is upstream of numerous potential phosphorylation cascades that elicit rapid cellular adaptation; however many of these remain incompletely defined ( Mills and O’Neill, 2014 49. Mills, E. ∙ O’Neill, L.A. Succinate: a metabolic signal in inflammation Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24 :313-320 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (489) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we first explored whether regulation of SUCNR1-mediated signaling was relevant in the acute muscle response to exercise and the specific phosphorylation cascades modulated by SUCNR1 in this context. We performed unbiased phosphoproteomics of TA skeletal muscle from wild-type (WT) and SUCNR1KO mice immediately following exercise, when succinate release is maximal. Remarkably, we observed significant enrichment of several kinase pathways for which the phosphorylation status depended on SUCNR1 during exercise ( Figure 4 A; Tables S3 B and S3C). Two of these pathways are established to be downstream of SUCNR1 agonism (protein kinase A [PKA] and mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]; Ariza et al., 2012 2. Ariza, A.C. ∙ Deen, P.M. ∙ Robben, J.H. The succinate receptor as a novel therapeutic target for oxidative and metabolic stress-related conditions Front. Endocrinol. (Lausanne). 2012; 3 :22 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mills and O’Neill, 2014 49. Mills, E. ∙ O’Neill, L.A. Succinate: a metabolic signal in inflammation Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24 :313-320 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (489) PubMed Google Scholar ). We additionally observed enrichment for CDK2-dependent phosphorylation cascade targets, which have not been linked previously to SUCNR1 agonism. These data indicate that succinate-SUCNR1 phosphorylation signaling is rapidly responsive to acute exercise in whole muscle.
The SUCNR1-dependent signaling cascades described above are upstream of a diverse range of distinct transcriptional responses, the nature of which crucially depends on the identity of the target cell. Therefore, we next determined the cell populations for which acute transcriptional regulation by SUCNR1 is relevant following exercise. A recent study suggested that SUCNR1 in muscle myotubes regulates fiber type remodeling ( Wang et al., 2019 79. Wang, T. ∙ Xu, Y.Q. ∙ Yuan, Y.X. ... Succinate induces skeletal muscle fiber remodeling via SUNCR1 signaling EMBO Rep. 2019; 20 :e47892 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, we found that, although SUCNR1 is detectable in whole muscle, it is not expressed in purified muscle myotubes or isolated C2C12 myoblasts ( Figure 4 B). Instead, we determined that SUCNR1 expression in whole muscle is attributable to major non-myofibrillar resident cell types, including stromal, endothelial, and satellite cell populations ( Figure 4 B). To corroborate this, we performed RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) localization of the SUCNR1 transcript in intact muscle. Because RNA ISH provides extremely sensitive detection of transcripts in intact tissue ( Wang et al., 2012 77. Wang, F. ∙ Flanagan, J. ∙ Su, N. ... RNAscope: a novel in situ RNA analysis platform for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues J. Mol. Diagn. 2012; 14 :22-29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1832) PubMed Google Scholar , 2013 78. Wang, Z. ∙ Portier, B.P. ∙ Gruver, A.M. ... Automated quantitative RNA in situ hybridization for resolution of equivocal and heterogeneous ERBB2 (HER2) status in invasive breast carcinoma J. Mol. Diagn. 2013; 15 :210-219 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ), we reasoned that this would unequivocally localize cell populations expressing SUCNR1 in intact muscle. Remarkably, SUCNR1 transcript was undetectable in muscle fibers, exhibiting complete anti-colocalization with the myofibrillar marker desmin ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Instead, the SUCNR1 signal correlated with non-myofibrillar stromal populations based on strong colocalization with platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (pdgfrα) ( Figures 4 C and 4D). In line with these findings, we found succinate to have no direct stimulatory effect on isolated muscle myoblast differentiation, myoblast proliferation rate, or transcriptional control of myosin heavy chains in differentiated myotubes ( Figures S3 A–S3E). Together with the lack of detectable expression of SUCNR1 in mature muscle cells ( Figures 4 B–4D), our data indicate an absence of cell-autonomous succinate-SUCNR1 regulation of muscle cell remodeling.
We hypothesized that succinate secreted from muscle cells could control cell non-autonomous transcriptional regulation in muscle tissue via SUCNR1 ( Figure 4 E). To explore this hypothesis, we purified major resident cell types found in muscle tissue: endothelial, hematopoietic (resident immune cells), stromal, and satellite ( Wang et al., 2020 80. Wang, K. ∙ Yaghi, O.K. ∙ Spallanzani, R.G. ... Neuronal, stromal, and T-regulatory cell crosstalk in murine skeletal muscle Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2020; 117 :5402-5408 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). WT and SUCNR1 knockout (KO) mice were subjected to acute treadmill exercise, which drives succinate release ( Figures 1 B–1D; Figure S3 F), and cell populations were isolated immediately post-exercise, when succinate release is maximal. Pure cell populations were subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to define the transcriptional response in each cell type that requires succinate-SUCNR1 signaling ( Tables S4 A–S4D). We then performed pathway analyses to implicate biological processes that depend on SUCNR1 based on reduced transcript levels in SUCNR1 KO cells compared with the WT ( Table S4 E). Several cell-type-specific transcriptomic responses that depend on SUCNR1 were uncovered by this analysis ( Figures 4 F–4I; Tables S4 A–S4D). In satellite cells and stromal cells, we observed significant decreases in transcripts involved in neuronal projections and axon guidance due to KO of SUCNR1 ( Figures 4 F and 4G; Table S4 E). SUCNR1 KO satellite cells also exhibited decreased expression of cell-cell adhesion transcripts, whereas stromal cells lacking SUCNR1 had decreased expression of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling transcripts ( Figures 4 F and 4G; Table S4 E). Among these transcripts were established factors involved in muscle remodeling, including GDF6, a growth factor that mediates muscle repair ( Hisamatsu et al., 2016 31. Hisamatsu, D. ∙ Ohno-Oishi, M. ∙ Nakamura, S. ... Growth differentiation factor 6 derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells reduces age-related functional deterioration in multiple tissues Aging (Albany NY). 2016; 8 :1259-1275 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hematopoietic (immune) and endothelial cell populations exhibited fewer systematic changes as a consequence of SUCNR1 ablation, with select protein glycosylation and ECM-receptor transcripts exhibiting decreased expression ( Figures 4 H and 4I; Table S4 E). Together, our data show that lack of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling results in a coordinated decrease in transcripts involved in innervation, muscle regeneration, and ECM formation in multiple muscle-resident, non-myofibrillar cell types.
Our data support a model whereby succinate released from exercising muscle acts as an upstream regulator of the paracrine response to acute exercise; in particular, innervation and remodeling of muscle ECM ( Figure 4 ). Initiation of these processes is critical for the muscle response to exercise training. Therefore, we next examined the role of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling on exercise training-induced muscle remodeling. To do so, we applied a voluntary resistance wheel running protocol. Resistance wheel training elicits systemic health benefits within 3 weeks, including elevated insulin sensitivity and increased muscle strength ( Figure 5 A; Ghosh et al., 2010 24. Ghosh, S. ∙ Golbidi, S. ∙ Werner, I. ... Selecting exercise regimens and strains to modify obesity and diabetes in rodents: an overview Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2010; 119 :57-74 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ; Roemers et al., 2018 66. Roemers, P. ∙ Mazzola, P.N. ∙ De Deyn, P.P. ... Burrowing as a novel voluntary strength training method for mice: A comparison of various voluntary strength or resistance exercise methods J. Neurosci. Methods. 2018; 300 :112-126 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). We applied this training protocol to WT and SUCNR1 KO mice. Sedentary mice displayed identical grip strength ( Figure 5 B). Interestingly, SUCNR1 KO mice ran more than WT mice throughout the training protocol ( Figure 5 C). Despite this, SUCNR1 KO mice exhibited a striking absence of strength gains in response to voluntary exercise, unlike the substantial gains observed in WT mice ( Figures 5 D and 5E).
To understand the molecular basis for this lack of training-induced muscle strength adaptation, we examined the proteomes of TA muscle from WT and SUCNR1 KO mice. Trained SUCNR1 KO muscle exhibited decreased protein abundance of major pathways involved in muscle adaptation to exercise compared with the WT ( Figure 5 F; Table S5 A). First, myosin complex protein abundance was decreased in SUCNR1 KO mice. In addition to overall lower levels of these proteins, substantial remodeling of myosin chain complexes was observed across genotypes. SUCNR1 KO trained muscle had significantly lower levels of fast twitch myosin heavy chains while displaying remodeling of non-skeletal muscle myosin chains and tropomyosins ( Figure 5 G). As a class, ECM organization proteins were also depleted in SUCNR1 KO trained muscle, including major collagens and laminins ( Figures 5 F and 5H; Table S5 A). These protein families play key roles in myogenesis, force transmission, and innervation in muscle ( Sanes, 2003 69. Sanes, J.R. The basement membrane/basal lamina of skeletal muscle J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 :12601-12604 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, SUCNR1 KO trained muscle exhibited significant elevations of complement pathway markers of tissue inflammation ( Figures 5 F and 5I; Table S5 A), many of which are associated with insulin resistance ( Phieler et al., 2013 60. Phieler, J. ∙ Garcia-Martin, R. ∙ Lambris, J.D. ... The role of the complement system in metabolic organs and metabolic diseases Semin. Immunol. 2013; 25 :47-53 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, these differences were not observed between genotypes in muscle of untrained mice, indicating an exercise-dependent requirement for SUCNR1 in mediating these adaptations ( Figures S3 G–S3I; Table S5 B).
Our proteomics analysis revealed that succinate-SUCNR1 signaling is required for maintaining ECM components involved in muscle innervation following exercise training. Moreover, our analyses of the SUCNR1-dependent transcriptome post-exercise demonstrated decreased expression of transcripts involved in axon guidance and neuronal projections ( Figures 4 F and 4G). Neuronal adaptation in muscle is a paracrine consequence of exercise training that plays a key role in increasing muscle strength ( Folland and Williams, 2007 22. Folland, J.P. ∙ Williams, A.G. The adaptations to strength training : morphological and neurological contributions to increased strength Sports Med. 2007; 37 :145-168 Crossref Scopus (901) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gabriel et al., 2006 23. Gabriel, D.A. ∙ Kamen, G. ∙ Frost, G. Neural adaptations to resistive exercise: mechanisms and recommendations for training practices Sports Med. 2006; 36 :133-149 Crossref Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore hypothesized that a basis of compromised training-induced muscle strength in SUCNR1 KO mice could be attributable to impaired muscle innervation. To examine this, we performed three-dimensional whole-tissue-mount immunolabeling of the neural-specific tubulin TUBB3 in TA muscle from WT and SUCNR1 KO mice. Remarkably, we found that resistance muscle training ( Figure 5 A) resulted in substantial increases in TA muscle neural staining that were abrogated in SUCNR1 KO mice ( Figures 5 J and 5K; Video S1 ). We additionally monitored whole-tissue vascularization ( Figures S4 A and S4B; Video S1 ) and muscle fiber volume ( Figures S4 C and S4D; Video S1 ) and found no differences between genotypes.

Tubb3 Immunolabeling, CD31 Immunolabeling, and Muscle Fiber Analysis of WT and SUCNR1 KO Muscles, Related to Figure 5
Taken together, these data demonstrate that succinate-SUCNR1 signaling plays a central role in exercise training-induced muscle innervation, muscle fiber type and ECM remodeling, and muscle strength. It is noteworthy that neural adaptations in muscle are an early paracrine response to resistance training that can improve muscle strength independent of hypertrophy ( Folland and Williams, 2007 22. Folland, J.P. ∙ Williams, A.G. The adaptations to strength training : morphological and neurological contributions to increased strength Sports Med. 2007; 37 :145-168 Crossref Scopus (901) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, motor neurons directly affect target myotube fiber content and function ( Buller et al., 1960 9. Buller, A.J. ∙ Eccles, J.C. ∙ Eccles, R.M. Interactions between motoneurones and muscles in respect of the characteristic speeds of their responses J. Physiol. 1960; 150 :417-439 Crossref Scopus (722) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas sympathetic innervation of muscle and afferent signaling by sympathetic nerves can regulate muscle strength, regeneration, and blood flow to muscle ( Barker and Saito, 1981 3. Barker, D. ∙ Saito, M. Autonomic innervation of receptors and muscle fibres in cat skeletal muscle Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1981; 212 :317-332 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ; Beitzel et al., 2004 4. Beitzel, F. ∙ Gregorevic, P. ∙ Ryall, J.G. ... Beta2-adrenoceptor agonist fenoterol enhances functional repair of regenerating rat skeletal muscle after injury J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 96 :1385-1392 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it is likely that the substantial effects of succinate release and SUCNR1 signaling on strength and muscle remodeling are at least partly attributable to modulation of muscle innervation.
Finally, we further elaborated our findings that SUCNR1 signaling antagonizes chronic muscle inflammation, which is associated with insulin resistance ( Figure 5 I). In humans, a single bout of exercise improves insulin sensitivity for hours post-exercise ( Richter et al., 1989 64. Richter, E.A. ∙ Mikines, K.J. ∙ Galbo, H. ... Effect of exercise on insulin action in human skeletal muscle J. Appl. Physiol. 1989; 66 :876-885 Crossref Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ), and our data indicate an anti-inflammatory role of succinate-SUCNR1 signaling. Therefore, we examined whether the concentration of local extracellular succinate during exercise is predictive of post-exercise insulin sensitivity in humans ( Figure 5 L). Individuals were sampled as described in Figure 1 E and Table S2 A and, following recovery, were subjected to a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp ( Table S2 B). Notably, we found a significant correlation between peak exercise succinate concentration in muscle femoral vein during exercise and insulin sensitivity post-exercise ( Figure 5 M; Table S2 C). This association between peak venous succinate and insulin sensitivity was distinct among all covariates tested ( Table S2 ; Figures S4 E and S4F) and occurred in the absence of correlations with maximum VO 2 ( Figure S4 G) and peak muscle load ( Figure S4 H). Based on these findings, we examined whether succinate-SUCNR1 signaling regulates post-exercise insulin sensitivity. We found that post-exercise insulin sensitivity was blunted in SUCNR1 KO mice ( Figure 5 N), which also exhibited modest basal glucose insensitivity ( Figure S4 I). Notably, previous examinations of SUCNR1 KO mice have established glucose insensitivity that depends on obesogenesis initiated by high-fat feeding, which occurs without changes in insulin tolerance ( McCreath et al., 2015 48. McCreath, K.J. ∙ Espada, S. ∙ Gálvez, B.G. ... Targeted disruption of the SUCNR1 metabolic receptor leads to dichotomous effects on obesity Diabetes. 2015; 64 :1154-1167 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, the role of extracellular succinate-SUCNR1 signaling in insulin sensitivity observed here may be specific to the exercise response.
Together, our findings define a bioenergetic mechanism in muscle that senses intracellular pH, using succinate to communicate local energetic status to the peripheral tissue environment. Because of its distinct physiochemical properties with respect to other mitochondrial dicarboxylates, succinate can be exported from muscle cells through acute regulation of its protonation status by local pH. When protonated, succinate is transformed from a dicarboxylate, which is trapped in the cell, to a monocarboxylate. In the protonated monocarboxylate form, succinate is rendered a transport substrate for the plasma membrane transporter MCT1, which facilitates pH-gated release. Upon pH-gated secretion during exercise, succinate signals via its cognate receptor SUCNR1 in non-muscle cells present in muscle tissue to coordinate muscle remodeling. Neurotrophic and muscle ECM remodeling initiated upon exercise depend essentially on paracrine succinate-SUCNR1 signaling, which is also required for major physiologic and molecular adaptations to exercise training. Although our data demonstrate a role for succinate-SUCNR1 paracrine regulation in muscle, it is possible that autocrine regulation could also play a role in some contexts. Although we could not detect SUCNR1 in isolated muscle cells, the process of isolation and culturing could initiate cellular adaptation, leading to loss of SUCNR1 expression. Moreover, although we did not detect SUCNR1 in intact muscle by ISH, it is possible that, following certain types of exercise training or fiber type remodeling, that SUCNR1 is expressed in these cell types as well.
It is noteworthy that a recent study investigated the effects of orally administered sodium succinate on muscle metabolism. In that study, dietary succinate altered skeletal muscle outputs such as strength and time to muscle fatigue in a SUCNR1-dependent fashion ( Wang et al., 2019 79. Wang, T. ∙ Xu, Y.Q. ∙ Yuan, Y.X. ... Succinate induces skeletal muscle fiber remodeling via SUNCR1 signaling EMBO Rep. 2019; 20 :e47892 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). These adaptations were attributed to signaling through myofibrillar SUCNR1. Alternatively, it is tempting to attribute the effects of dietary succinate to the same paracrine cascade initiated by exercise-induced, muscle-derived succinate determined in this work. When considering this possibility, it should be noted that orally administered succinate has major and rapid regulatory effects on systemic glucose homeostasis ( De Vadder et al., 2016 14. De Vadder, F. ∙ Kovatcheva-Datchary, P. ∙ Zitoun, C. ... Microbiota-Produced Succinate Improves Glucose Homeostasis via Intestinal Gluconeogenesis Cell Metab. 2016; 24 :151-157 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (487) PubMed Google Scholar ), whole-body energy expenditure ( Mills et al., 2018 50. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), and intestinal nutrient assimilation ( de Vadder and Mithieux, 2018 13. de Vadder, F. ∙ Mithieux, G. Gut-brain signaling in energy homeostasis: the unexpected role of microbiota-derived succinate J. Endocrinol. 2018; 236 :R105-R108 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ). These systemic regulatory circuits are linked to muscle metabolism. Therefore, any acquired effects on muscle tissue following several weeks of dietary succinate supplementation must take these upstream pathways into account when considering mechanisms of action. In any case, it will be interesting to examine the extent to which dietary succinate initiates regulation of muscle innervation and ECM remodeling similar to the local and transient release of succinate by exercising muscle.
Our findings also propose a general model of how the intracellular energetic status can be communicated systemically through pH-gated succinate release. This mode of systemic integration reconciles the nature of succinate as an intracellular metabolite with the expanding list of physiological processes that can be regulated by extracellular succinate and/or SUCNR1, including energy expenditure ( Mills et al., 2018 50. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), inflammation ( Littlewood-Evans et al., 2016 42. Littlewood-Evans, A. ∙ Sarret, S. ∙ Apfel, V. ... GPR91 senses extracellular succinate released from inflammatory macrophages and exacerbates rheumatoid arthritis J. Exp. Med. 2016; 213 :1655-1662 Crossref Scopus (333) PubMed Google Scholar ; Peruzzotti-Jametti et al., 2018 59. Peruzzotti-Jametti, L. ∙ Bernstock, J.D. ∙ Vicario, N. ... Macrophage-Derived Extracellular Succinate Licenses Neural Stem Cells to Suppress Chronic Neuroinflammation Cell Stem Cell. 2018; 22 :355-368.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the renin-angiotensin system ( Deen and Robben, 2011 15. Deen, P.M. ∙ Robben, J.H. Succinate receptors in the kidney J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2011; 22 :1416-1422 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is also consistent with the hypothesis that extreme pathologies involving tissue ischemia, or local pH gradients between astrocytes and neurons, could drive succinate release via MCT1 ( Andrienko et al., 2017 1. Andrienko, T.N. ∙ Pasdois, P. ∙ Pereira, G.C. ... The role of succinate and ROS in reperfusion injury - A critical appraisal J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2017; 110 :1-14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (112) PubMed Google Scholar ; Molnár et al., 2008 51. Molnár, T. ∙ Barabás, P. ∙ Héja, L. ... gamma-Hydroxybutyrate binds to the synaptic site recognizing succinate monocarboxylate: a new hypothesis on astrocyte-neuron interaction via the protonation of succinate J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86 :1566-1576 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ), evidence for which was recently provided in models of myocardial infarction ( https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa148 ). In sum, our model predicts that instances of hypoxia or intracellular acidification will engage succinate release as a general mechanism to initiate cell non-autonomous modes of physiological regulation.

The published article includes all datasets generated or analyzed during this study.
Animal experiments were performed according to procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Unless otherwise stated, mice used were male C57BL/6J (8 ± 12 weeks of age; Jackson Laboratories) and housed in a temperature-controlled (23°C) room on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Male WT and SUCNR1KO littermate matched controls were used.
Ten men were recruited for the study, which was approved by the Copenhagen Ethics Committee (Reg. number H-16040740) and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed written consent was received from each participant prior to study inclusion. All subjects were healthy, moderately physically active and with no family history of diabetes. The subjects were 27 ± 0.8 (means ± SEM) years old, with a body weight of 85 ± 2.5 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 24 ± 0.5 kg⋅m-2 and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) of 49 ± 1 ml⋅kg-1⋅min-1. Maximal oxygen uptake was measured by an incremental exercise test on a Monark Ergomedic 839E bicycle ergometer (Monark). Before the trial subjects consumed a eucaloric controlled diet for 3 days to eliminate dietary differences between subjects. The daily energy requirements were individually determined from weighed dietary registrations and predicted equations from WHO/FAO/UNU. All food items were weighed and prepared in the metabolic kitchen and menus were delivered to the subjects and ingested at home. The diet consisted of 60 energy-percent (E%) carbohydrate, 25E% fat and 15E% protein.
C2C12 murine myoblasts (obtained from ATCC) were in growth media consisting of DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Upon reaching confluency, growth media was exchanged for differentiation media consisting of DMEM containing 2% horse serum. Seven days post differentiation cells appeared mostly as phase-bright fused myotubes ( Ramesh et al., 2019 62. Ramesh, M. ∙ Campos, J.C. ∙ Lee, P. ... Mitophagy protects against statin-mediated skeletal muscle toxicity FASEB J. 2019; 33 :11857-11869 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Mouse satellite cells were isolated as previously described ( Sampath et al., 2018 68. Sampath, S.C. ∙ Sampath, S.C. ∙ Ho, A.T.V. ... Induction of muscle stem cell quiescence by the secreted niche factor Oncostatin M Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :1531 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles were dissected and digested with Collagenase type 2 and Dispase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) for a total of 90-120 min. Cell suspension was strained with a 40 μm filter and stained cells the following antibodies: anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences), anti-CD11b (BD Biosciences), anti-CD31 (eBiosciences) and anti-Sca1 (BD Biosciences). Next, cells were incubated with streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech), SA-Texas Red (Invitrogen), PE labeled anti-integrin α7 antibody labeled with phycoerythrin (AbLab) and anti-CD34 eFluor660 (eBioscience). Dead cells were identified using propidium iodide staining. Cells were sorted on a FACS Aria 2 and routinely yielded > 95% CD34+ α7 integrin+ cells from a single round of sorting. Scatterplots were analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar). Live cells were plated in collagen coated plates (Corning) and maintained in growth media (50:50 DMEM /F10, 15% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2.5 ng/ml bFGF). For in vitro differentiation, satellite cells were washed with PBS and subjected to differentiation media (DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum) for three days. Depending on experimental condition, vehicle (PBS) or succinate (50, 100 and 200 μM) were added to growth and differentiation media.
Eight-week old mice were acclimated to a motorized treadmill (Columbus Instruments) for three days prior to forced running protocol. Training sessions consisted of mice walking on the treadmill for 5 min at 12 m/min followed by a 1 min rest and then 5 min at 12 m/min and 5 min at 14 m/min. On the day of running, all mice were subjected to the training protocol. Mice in the sedentary group were taken off the treadmill after the training protocol was complete while mice in the exercise group remained on the treadmill. After the training period, exercised mice remained on the treadmill and the speed was ramped up 2 m/min every 4 min, until a final speed of 26 m/min was reached. Exercised mice were removed from the treadmill once exhausted, which was deemed to be the point where they refused to step on the treadmill.
Following intervention, animals were sacrificed immediately by cervical dislocation and tissues were rapidly extracted and immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for metabolite profiling. For metabolite extraction, tissues were weighed and then homogenized with extraction buffer which consisted of 80% methanol containing inosine15N4, thymine-d4 and glycocholate-d4 internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at a 4:1 volume to wet weight ratio. Samples were then centrifuged twice (5 min, 10,000 g, 4°C). Supernatant was then further diluted with 80% HPLC grade methanol at a ratio of 1:10 extracted metabolite to methanol. Interstitial fluid was extracted from muscles immediately upon extraction using a rapid isolation procedure described previously ( Spinelli et al., 2017 73. Spinelli, J.B. ∙ Yoon, H. ∙ Ringel, A.E. ... Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass Science. 2017; 358 :941-946 Crossref Scopus (296) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sullivan et al., 2019 74.

Quantification of microenvironmental metabolites in murine cancers reveals determinants of tumor nutrient availability eLife. 2019; 8 e44235 Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar ). Muscles were subjected to centrifugation (10 min, 800 g, 4°C) following placement in a 20 μm nylon mesh filter (EMD Millipore). Metabolites were extracted by adding extraction buffer at a ratio of 1:100 interstitial fluid to methanol. Samples were then centrifuged twice (5 min, 10,000 g, 4°C) and supernatant was collected. For plasma collection, blood was taken via cheek bleed from mice, collected into a heparin column (Becton Dickson), centrifuged (10 min, 1,000 g, 4°C), and subsequently snap-frozen. Metabolites were extracted from plasma by adding extraction buffer in a 1:4 ratio plasma to methanol. Samples were then centrifuged twice (5 min, 10,000 g, 4°C) and supernatant was collected. For media metabolite extraction, media samples were collected and centrifuged (1 min, 21,100 g, 4°C) to remove any debris or cell contaminants. Metabolites from media were extracted by adding extraction buffer in a ratio of 1:4 media to methanol. Samples were then centrifuged twice (5 min, 10,000 g, 4°C) and supernatant was collected.
All extracted samples were then subjected to LC/MS analysis as previously described ( Mills et al., 2018 50. Mills, E.L. ∙ Pierce, K.A. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... Accumulation of succinate controls activation of adipose tissue thermogenesis Nature. 2018; 560 :102-106 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Metabolite extracts were loaded onto a Luna- HILIC column (Phenomenex) using an UltiMate-3000 TPLRS LC with 10% mobile phase A (20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in water) and 90% mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium hydroxide in 75:25 v/v acetonitrile/methanol). A 10 min linear gradient to 99% mobile phase A was used to separate metabolites. Subsequent analysis was carried out using a QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Negative and positive ion modes were used with full scan analysis over m/z 70-750 m/z at 60,000 resolution, 1e6 AGC, and 100 ms maximum ion accumulation time. Additional MS settings were: ion spray voltage, 3.8 kV; capillary temperature, 350°C; probe heater temperature, 320°C; sheath gas, 50; auxiliary gas, 15; and S-lens RF level 40. Targeted processing of a subset of known metabolites and isotopologues was conducted using TraceFinder software version 4.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Compound identities were confirmed using reference standards. In all case metabolite abundance was normalized using internal standards and relative changes were assessed by comparison with metabolite extracted from the same sample type (i.e., tissue, IF, plasma).
After three days on the control diet, subjects ingested a light standardized breakfast (1.6 MJ) at 6 A.M at home. Subjects arrived at the laboratory at 8 A.M, and after 10-15 min of supine rest, teflon catheters were inserted into the femoral artery in one leg and the femoral vein of the other leg under local anesthesia. After continued supine rest, basal blood samples were obtained from the femoral artery and vein at 10 A.M (0 min). Subjects then initiated a 60 min exercise bout on the Monark Ergomedic 839E bicycle ergometer at 67 ± 1% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). VO2 peak was determined by an incremental test performed on a bike ergometer (Monark) at least 1 week prior to the experiment. Femoral arterial and femoral venous samples were collected simultaneously during exercise at 20, 40 and 60 min and again after 10 and 120 min of resting supine recovery without food intake. Femoral arterial blood flow at rest was measured by high frequency 12-3 MHz linear array transducer in Power Doppler mode interfaced to an Affiniti70 ultrasound machine (Phillips Ultrasound). During exercise, leg blood flow was estimated based on pulmonary oxygen uptake and the A-V difference for oxygen as described ( Jorfeldt and Wahren, 1971 35. Jorfeldt, L. ∙ Wahren, J. Leg blood flow during exercise in man Clin. Sci. 1971; 41 :459-473 Crossref Scopus (282) PubMed Google Scholar ). The pulmonary oxygen consumption was measured using a MasterScreen CPX system (Becton).
Two hours after completion of the exercise trial, a 2 h euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp was initiated. Subjects were clamped at their individual ambient plasma glucose level obtained prior to initiation of the insulin infusion. Insulin was infused at 1.4 mU.kg -1 .min -1 resulting in a plasma insulin concentration ⁓ 100 μU/ml. Plasma glucose concentration was measured every ∼7 min and a variable glucose infusion (20% Fresenius Kabi, SE) into a forearm vein was adjusted to clamp euglycaemia as previously described ( DeFronzo et al., 1979 16. DeFronzo, R.A. ∙ Tobin, J.D. ∙ Andres, R. Glucose clamp technique: a method for quantifying insulin secretion and resistance Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237 :E214-E223 PubMed Google Scholar ). Insulin sensitivity was calculated as the glucose infusion rate over the last 30 min of the 120 min clamp.
Blood was sampled in heparinized syringes and transferred to EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged at 4°C at 3000 g for 5 min. Plasma was aspirated, frozen, and stored at −80°C until analysis.
C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at a density of 80,000 cells per well, 24 h prior to use. A minimal media was made consisting of 8.3 g/L DMEM, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES. Media was place in a sealed hypoxic chamber set to 0.1% oxygen tension, 24 h prior to use. On the day of the experiment, cells were placed in the hypoxic chamber for 2 h and previously degassed media was added to each well. After the 2 h, media from each well was collected inside the chamber, and snap frozen for metabolomic analysis.
Pharmacological acidification of intracellular pH in C2C12 cells was achieved by acute inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with 100 nM atpenin A5 (Cayman Chemical) and 0.5 mM antimycin A (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 h and 2 h, respectively. 100 μM monensin (Sigma Aldrich) were added 1h before administration of atpenin A5 or hypoxia to prevent cellular acidification. Intracellular pH acidification by extracellular equilibration was achieved as previously described ( Nadtochiy et al., 2016 54. Nadtochiy, S.M. ∙ Shafer, X. ∙ Dragony, F. ... Acidic pH Is a Metabolic Switch for 2-Hydroxyglutarate Generation and Signaling J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291 :20188-20197 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (111) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were incubated with pH 6.4 medium supplemented with 30 mM NH 4 Cl and 10 μM 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) for 15 min, followed by reincubation in pH 6.4 medium with 10 μM EIPA alone for 4 hours.
Intracellular pH was determined using the ratiometric fluorescent intracellular pH probe BCECF-AM (Invitrogen) ( Khacho et al., 2014 37. Khacho, M. ∙ Tarabay, M. ∙ Patten, D. ... Acidosis overrides oxygen deprivation to maintain mitochondrial function and cell survival Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3550 Crossref Scopus (142) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cells were loaded with BCECF (1 mM) for 30 min at 37°C. We used dual-excitation ratio of 480 nm and 440 nm and fixed emission at 535 nm to measure changes in BCECF-AM fluorescence. A calibration curve of the intracellular pH response in terms of the ratio of fluorescence intensities was performed using the high K + nigericin technique.
Pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 in C2C12 cells was achieved by preincubation with 5 mM α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 100 nM AZD 3965, and 100 nM ARC155858 for 30 min, followed by hypoxia or acidification of intracellular pH experiments
Opti-MEM media (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was incubated with lipofectamine (Life Technologies) for 10 min at room temperature. In a separate 1.5 mL tube, Opti-MEM media was incubated with 2 uL of siRNA (10 μM stock; Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min. The lipofectamine mixture was added dropwise to the siRNA mixture and left to incubate (20 min, room temperature). This final solution was added dropwise to a 12-well plate. C2C12 myoblasts were then added at a density of 40,000 cells/well. The media was changed 24 h later and the cells were used 48 h after plating. Knock-down efficiency was confirmed via qPCR.
Xenopus laevis oocytes were purchased from EcoCyte Bioscience and the transport assay was conducted as previously described ( Bröer et al., 1997 6. Bröer, S. ∙ Rahman, B. ∙ Pellegri, G. ... Comparison of lactate transport in astroglial cells and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT 1) expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes.

Markovich, D. Expression cloning and radiotracer uptakes in Xenopus laevis oocytes Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 :1975-1980 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ). Oocytes were injected with MCT1 cRNA (24 ng) prepared by in vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from the human MCT1 cloned in the plasmid pcDNA3.1 (GeneScript). Controls were injected with equivalent volume of water. Oocytes were cultured in modified Barth’s solution (88 mM NaCl, 1 mM KCl, 0.82 mM MgSO 4 , 0.4 mM CaCl 2 , 0.33 mM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , 2.4 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 mM HEPES, 10 U/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.4) for 3 days. For succinate uptake measurements, groups of 5 oocytes were incubated in OR2 buffer (82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 mM HEPES, pH 6.4 or pH 7.4) containing [U13C] succinate or lactate at different concentrations for 10 min, which we established as the time point for linear kinetics of transport. Inhibition of MCT1 was achieved by incubating oocyte with 100 nM AZD3965 5 min prior to the addition of [U13C] succinate. Oocytes were washed three times in ice cold OR2 buffer, lysed with metabolite extraction buffer, and subjected to LC/MS analysis, as described above.
Extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles were rapidly isolated, transferred to 12 well plates containing DMEM supplemented with 25 mM glucose and maintained at 37°C - adapted from ( Campos et al., 2018 11. Campos, J.C. ∙ Baehr, L.M. ∙ Gomes, K.M.S. ... Exercise prevents impaired autophagy and proteostasis in a model of neurogenic myopathy Sci. Rep. 2018; 8 :11818 Crossref Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ). For particular experiments, muscles were incubated with 10 μM AZD, 100 μM monensin for 30 min with or without 1 μM atpenin A5 for additional 60 min. Following interventions, media from each well was collected and snap frozen for metabolomic analysis.
Muscle tissues were homogenized in 100 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 1 p/15 mL protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mixture was clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant was subjected to BCA protein concentration measurement and reduced with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide. Proteins were then purified using the methanol-chloroform precipitation method and reconstituted in 200 mM EPPS at pH 8.5 and digested by Lys-C and trypsin overnight 1:100 enzyme-to-substrate ratio and an additional 6 h by trypsin the next day. Resulting peptides were labeled by TMT-pro 16plex (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the SL-TMT protocol ( Navarrete-Perea et al., 2018 56. Navarrete-Perea, J. ∙ Yu, Q. ∙ Gygi, S.P. ... Streamlined Tandem Mass Tag (SL-TMT) Protocol: An Efficient Strategy for Quantitative (Phospho)proteome Profiling Using Tandem Mass Tag-Synchronous Precursor Selection-MS3 J. Proteome Res. 2018; 17 :2226-2236 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ), and quench by adding 5% hydroxylamine. A ratio-check is then performed by mixing 1% sample from each TMT channel, and the TMT-labeled peptides were evenly mixed based on the ratio-check. The mixture was desalted using Sep-pak cartridges (Waters), dried, and fractionated using an Agilent 1100 quaternary HPLC system. Peptides were separated using a 50 min linear gradient from 18% to 40% acetonitrile in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, into a total of 96 fractions that were consolidated into 8. Samples were dried and desalted via StageTip and reconstituted in 5% formic acid and 5% ACN for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The proteomics samples were either analyzed using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos or an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (LC) pump were used to analyze the samples. The columns are packed in house with 100 mm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with 40 cm of GP-18 resin (2.6 mm, 200 A, Sepax). A FAIMSPro (Thermo Fisher Scientific) device for FAIMS separation of precursors ( Schweppe et al., 2019 71. Schweppe, D.K. ∙ Prasad, S. ∙ Belford, M.W. ... Characterization and Optimization of Multiplexed Quantitative Analyses Using High-Field Asymmetric-Waveform Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Anal. Chem. 2019; 91 :4010-4016 Crossref Scopus (131) PubMed Google Scholar ). The FAIMS device was operated with default settings and multiple compensation voltages (40V/-60V/-80V).
For protein abundance measurements on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos instrument, samples were analyzed using a single 135 min run with 9%–24% ACN at 500 nL min -1 flow rate. Fractionated peptides were injected. Under each FAIMS voltage, the full MS was operated with a scan range 375-1500 m/z at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap. Tandem mass spectra (MS2) were matched in real time to targeted proteins ( Schweppe et al., 2020 70. Schweppe, D.K. ∙ Eng, J.K. ∙ Yu, Q. ... Full-Featured, Real-Time Database Searching Platform Enables Fast and Accurate Multiplexed Quantitative Proteomics J. Proteome Res. 2020; 19 :2026-2034 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). When a peptide match was observed to a targeted protein, a quantitative SPS-MS3 scan was acquired ( McAlister et al., 2014 47. McAlister, G.C. ∙ Nusinow, D.P. ∙ Jedrychowski, M.P. ... MultiNotch MS3 enables accurate, sensitive, and multiplexed detection of differential expression across cancer cell line proteomes Anal. Chem. 2014; 86 :7150-7158 Crossref Scopus (890) PubMed Google Scholar ). For protein abundance measurements on the Orbitrap Eclipse instrument with TMT, all samples were analyzed with a 180 min gradient consisting of 2% - 23% ACN, 0.125% FA at 500 nl/min flow rate. Under each FAIMS voltage, peptide ions were collected in data-dependent mode using a mass range of m/z 400 - 1600 using 2 s cycles. Resolution for MS1 was set at 120,000, with standard automatic gain control (AGC) target. Multiply-charged ions were selected and subjected to fragmentation at 35% normalized collisional energy (NCE) for MS2 with a dynamic exclusion of 120 s. Quantification was performed using multinotch SPS-MS3 as described previously (McAlister et al., 2014). For phosphoproteomics, unfractionated samples were analyzed with a 150 min gradient consisting of 2% - 27% ACN, 0.125% FA at 525 nl/min flow rate. The samples were first analyzed with multistage activation (MSA) based on 97.9763 Da neutral loss and quantified using SPSMS3, then analyzed again using high-resolution MS2 as described previously ( Schweppe et al., 2020 72. Schweppe, D.K. ∙ Rusin, S.F. ∙ Gygi, S.P. ... Optimized Workflow for Multiplexed Phosphorylation Analysis of TMT-Labeled Peptides Using High-Field Asymmetric Waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometry J. Proteome Res. 2020; 19 :554-560 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). For label-free quantification, unfractionated samples were analyzed with a 180 min gradient consisting of 2% - 23% ACN, 0.125% FA at 500 nl/min flow rate. Peptide ions were collected in data-dependent mode using a mass range of m/z 400-1600 using 2 s cycles. Each ion is selected for further fragmentation in MS2. Maximum injection time was set to 50 ms and dynamic exclusion was 120 s.
The Comet algorithm ( Eng et al., 2013 21. Eng, J.K. ∙ Jahan, T.A. ∙ Hoopmann, M.R. Comet: an open-source MS/MS sequence database search tool Proteomics. 2013; 13 :22-24 Crossref Scopus (970) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to search all MS/MS spectra against a database containing sequences of human ( Mus musculus ) proteins downloaded from UniProt ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ). Reversed sequences were appended as decoys for FDR filtering, and common contaminant proteins (e.g., human keratins, trypsin) were included. Peptides were searched using following parameters: 25 ppm precursor mass tolerance; 1.0 Da product ion mass tolerance; fully tryptic digestion; up to three missed cleavages; variable modification: oxidation of methionine (+15.9949); static modifications: TMT (+304.2071) on lysine and peptide N terminus, carboxyamidomethylation (+57.0214637236) on cysteines. The target-decoy method was employed to control the false discovery rate (FDR) ( Elias and Gygi, 2007 20. Elias, J.E. ∙ Gygi, S.P.

Proteome Res. 2003; 2 :43-50 Crossref Scopus (1424) PubMed Google Scholar ). To distinguish correct and incorrect peptide identifications, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to control peptide-level FDR to less than 1%. Peptides shorter than six amino acids were discarded. Protein-level FDR was also controlled to 1% and as a result the number of peptide reverse hits were further decreased. Peptides were matched to the least number of proteins. TMT reporter ion signal-to-noise ratios for all quantified peptides matched to the same protein were summed up to report protein abundance. Spectral counts were used to quantify proteins in label-free samples. KEGG pathway GO enrichment analyses were performed using Enrichr ( https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/ ; Chen et al., 2013 12.

Samples were homogenized using TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5, 8 M urea, 2% SDS, 150 mM NaCl plus 1X Roche cOmplete protease and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitors. Following a BCA assay to estimate protein concentration, all lysates were reduced with 5 mM TCEP for 30 min at room temperature, then alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Proteins were precipitated by chloroform-methanol precipitation, digested, and 100 μg peptides from each sample were labeled by TMT-pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the SL-TMT protocol ( Navarrete-Perea et al., 2018 56.

Proteome Res. 2018; 17 :2226-2236 Crossref Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). Samples were then combined according to a ratio-check, then desalted using a sep-pak cartridge (Waters). Ten percent of the resulting peptides were used for protein abundance analysis and fractionated using a High-pH fractionation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiic) into 8 fractions and purified by stagetipping. The rest were subjected to phosphopeptide enrichment using the High-Select Fe-NTA kit ( Paulo et al., 2018 57. Paulo, J.A. ∙ Navarrete-Perea, J. ∙ Erickson, A.R. ...

Proteins from control and MCT1 expressing oocytes were extracted and digested as described above. After digestion, peptides from each sample were then purified using stage-tips and 2 μg peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry.
The tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, and quadricep muscles were isolated from each mouse and placed in a 1.5 mL tube containing 500 μL of phenol-free, serum-free DMEM (GIBCO). Tissues were then minced until disintegrated. Minced tissues were further digested (30 min, 37°C) in DMEM containing collagenase VIII (Sigma Aldrich) and dispase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tissue homogenate was filtered into a new 50 mL conical using a 70 μM filter and washed with phenol-free DMEM (GIBCO) containing 2% FBS and EDTA (staining buffer). Cells were then centrifuged (10 min, 1500 rpm, 4°C) and resuspended in staining buffer, twice. Buffer was aspirated and pellet was resuspended in 250 μL of staining buffer containing the following antibodies (Biolegend): CD45 BV605 (1:100), CD31 PE-Cy7 (1:100), CD140a APC (1:50), Sca1 PerCP-Cy5.5 (1:50), and Vcam1 PE (1:100). Cells were incubated for 20 min then washed twice (5 min, 1500 rpm, 4°C) and resuspended in 200 μL of staining buffer. Stained cells were then sorted using a FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson). Cells were sorted twice to ensure purity.
Cells were fixed with 100% methanol (chilled at −20°C) for 5 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 60 min. Incubation with anti-MyHC (1:400; Sigma Aldrich) diluted in PBS with 0.1% BSA was performed overnight at 4°C. Cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DAPI (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS for 1 h.
C2C12 myoblasts were seeded at a density of 40,000 cells per well in a 12 wells plate, 24h prior to use. Cells were then brought into suspension using trypsin, followed by resuspension in fresh medium. Cell suspension was mixed with trypan blue (1:1) and transferred to a hemocytometer. Number of cells was counted 24, 48 and 72 h after the beginning of the experiment.
Cell suspensions were stained with antibodies against CD45, CD31, Sca-1, CD140a (PDGFRα), and Vcam1 and sorted using FACS Aria II (Becton Dickson). DAPI was used for cellular viability. The following populations were isolated: hematopoietic (CD45+), endothelial (CD31+), stromal (CD45-CD31-PDGFRα+Sca-1+), and satellite (CD45-CD31- Sca-1-Vcam1+). One thousand cells from each population were double-sorted and collected into 5 μL Buffer TCL (QIAGEN) containing 1% beta-mercaptoethanol (Sigma Aldrich). Samples were placed on ice for 5 minutes, transferred to dry ice, and eventually stored at −80°C until submitted for sequencing. Smart-Seq2 libraries were prepared by the Broad Technology Labs and were sequenced using the Broad Genomics Platform ( Picelli et al., 2014 61. Picelli, S. ∙ Faridani, O.R. ∙ Björklund, A.K. ... Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2 Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9 :171-181 Crossref Scopus (2542) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transcripts were quantified by the Broad Technology Labs computational pipeline using Cufflinks version 2.2.1 ( Trapnell et al., 2012 76. Trapnell, C. ∙ Roberts, A. ∙ Goff, L. ... Differential gene and transcript expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with TopHat and Cufflinks Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7 :562-578 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). For pathway analysis, differentially expressed genes were defined using the following cutoffs: expression (> 10), fold-change (> 2, WT versus KO), p value (< 0.05), and coefficient of variation (< 0.3). KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analyses were performed using Enrichr ( https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/ ; Eden et al., 2007 17. Eden, E. ∙ Lipson, D. ∙ Yogev, S. ...

For insulin tolerance testing (ITT), 13-week old mice were fasted for 3.5h. At 2 h following initial fasting time, mice were subjected to a single bout of acute treadmill running for 45 min and then were allowed to rest of 45 min. Insulin (0.9 U/kg) was administered i.p. Blood glucose measurements were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min using a glucometer. For glucose tolerance testing (GTT), mice were fasted for 6h and were administered glucose (1 g/kg) i.p. Blood glucose measurements were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min using a glucometer.
Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Tissues were then washed three times in PBS and stored in 70% ethanol until paraffin embedded. Following embedding, tissues were sectioned into 5 μM thick slices and placed onto superfrost slides. In situ hybridization was performed using the RNAscope multiplex v2 assay and 4-plex ancillary kits from ACD. Slides were first deparaffinized by washing in xylene twice (room temperature, 5 min) followed by 2 methanol washes (room temperature, 2 min). Slides were then allowed to dry completely before H 2 O 2 treatment (room temperature, 10 min). Slides were subsequently washed twice in dH 2 O (room temperature, 1 min). Samples were then incubated in RNAscope 1X Target Retrieval Reagent (100°C, 30 min). Following target retrieval, slides were rinsed in dH 2 O and then washed in methanol (room temperature, 3min). Slides were then allowed to dry before RNAscope Protease Plus reagent was applied to each section (40°C, 30 min). All 40°C incubations were performed in the HybEZ Oven. Slides were washed twice with dH 2 O. Following washes, RNAscope probes for desmin, pax7, pdgfrα, and SUCNR1 were administered to each section (40°C, 2 h). Slides were then washed twice with 1X Wash Buffer (room temperature, 2 min). Amp 1 was then applied to each section (40°C, 30 min). The slides were then washed twice with wash buffer (room temperature, 2min). These steps were repeated with Amp 2 (40°C, 30 min) and Amp 3 (40°C, 15 min). HRP-C1 reagent was then applied to each section (40°C, 15 min) followed by two washes (RT, 2 min). Opal 520 fluorophore was applied (1:750, 40°C, 30 min). Slides were washed twice and then HRP blocker was applied to each section (40°C, 15 min). These steps were repeated for HRP-C2 using opal 570, HRP-C3 using opal 620, and HRP-C4 using opal 690. All opal dyes were diluted 1:750 using TSA buffer. Samples were then mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant and allowed to dry overnight. Samples were then imaged using a fluorescent microscope. Colocalization analysis was performed in Fiji using the Coloc2 plugin for determination of the Manders’ colocalization coefficient.
A resistance training wheel was created by attaching brass spacers to a standard running wheel as previously described ( Call et al., 2010 10. Call, J.A. ∙ McKeehen, J.N. ∙ Novotny, S.A. ... Progressive resistance voluntary wheel running in the mdx mouse Muscle Nerve. 2010; 42 :871-880 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ). Twelve-week old mice were singly housed and half of them were placed in cages containing a running wheel for 3 weeks. Wheels were weighted to 1 g of resistance at the start of the experiment and was increased by 1 g/week till a final weight of 3 g was reached. Distance run was continually recorded (Starr Life) and grip strength was assessed weekly in both trained and untrained mice using a force meter. Lean and fat mass were measured by MRI at the beginning and at the end of the 3 weeks. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks and the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius were harvested for further processing.
Tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Muscles were then processed for whole-tissue clearing and imaging, using the iDISCO method ( Renier et al., 2014 63. Renier, N. ∙ Wu, Z. ∙ Simon, D.J. ... iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging Cell. 2014; 159 :896-910 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1076) PubMed Google Scholar ). All washes were performed in a 2 mL tube with end-over-end shaking. Tissues were first dehydrated by washing in a series of methanol/H 2 O buffers: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100% (1 h each, room temperature). Samples were chilled (4°C) and then incubated in 66% dichloromethane (Sigma Aldrich)/ 33% methanol (o/n, room temperature). Tissues were then washed twice in 100% methanol (room temperature) and then chilled (4°C). Samples were bleached in fresh 5% H 2 O 2 (Sigma Aldrich) diluted in methanol (o/n, 4°C). Tissues were then rehydrated by washing in a series of methanol/H2O buffers: 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, PBS (1 h each, room temperature). Samples were then washed twice (1 h, room temperature) with PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich). In order to stain the whole tissue, samples were permeabilized (2 days, 37°C) using PBS containing 2% Triton X-100, glycine (Sigma Aldrich), and DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). Exogenous binding of antibodies was prevented by incubating samples in a blocking solution containing PBS, Triton X-100, DMSO, and FBS (2 days, 37°C). Following blocking, half of the samples were incubated with a TUBB3 antibody (1:2000, Biolegend) and the other half were incubated with a CD31 antibody (1:250, Biolegend) for 4 days at 37°C. Tissues were then washed 5 times with PBS containing 2% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich) and heparin (Sigma Aldrich). Samples were then incubated with secondary antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) for 4 days at 37°C. Tissues were then again washed 5 times with PBS containing 2% Tween-20. Samples were dehydrated by washing in a series of methanol/H 2 O buffers: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, 100% (1 h each, room temperature). Following dehydration, tissues were incubated in 66% dichloromethane/ 33% methanol (3 h, room temperature). Samples were then washed twice with 100% dichloromethane (15 min each, room temperature). Finally, tissues were cleared using dibenzyl ether (Sigma Aldrich). Whole tissues were then imaged at 0.66x magnification using a light sheet microscope. 3D reconstructions and renderings were made using the software Imaris (Bitplane). Further imaging analysis was performed using ImageJ.
Stromal, endothelial, immune, and satellite cells were isolated from hindlimb muscles as previously described and collected into RLT buffer (QIAGEN) for RNA extraction. RNA was further purified using the RNAeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). RNA was then quantified using a Nanodrop 2000 UV-visible spectrophotometer. 100 ng of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was then diluted in a 1:4 ratio cDNA to water and used for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. qPCR reactions were performed in 384- well plates using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega). Samples were run on a Quant Studio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Relative abundance of Sucnr1 was calculated by the ΔCt method using GAPDH as an endogenous control.
Data analysis was performed in Excel, R, and Prism as described above. All data (unless otherwise noted) was presented as mean ± SEM. Unless otherwise noted, P values were calculated using a two-tailed Student’s t test for pairwise comparisons and one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons involving a single variable. ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.005. Details of statistical analyses and n values are found in the Figure Legends. For in vivo experiments, n indicates number of mice or humans. For all other experiments, n indicates biological replicates.
