Title: Liquid-Liquid Phase Transition Drives Intra-chloroplast Cargo Sorting


Abstract: Summary

In eukaryotic cells, organelle biogenesis is pivotal for cellular function and cell survival. Chloroplasts are unique organelles with a complex internal membrane network. The mechanisms of the migration of imported nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins across the crowded stroma to thylakoid membranes are less understood. Here, we identified two Arabidopsis ankyrin-repeat proteins, STT1 and STT2, that specifically mediate sorting of chloroplast twin arginine translocation (cpTat) pathway proteins to thylakoid membranes. STT1 and STT2 form a unique hetero-dimer through interaction of their C-terminal ankyrin domains. Binding of cpTat substrate by N-terminal intrinsically disordered regions of STT complex induces liquid-liquid phase separation. The multivalent nature of STT oligomer is critical for phase separation. STT-Hcf106 interactions reverse phase separation and facilitate cargo targeting and translocation across thylakoid membranes. Thus, the formation of phase-separated droplets emerges as a novel mechanism of intra-chloroplast cargo sorting. Our findings highlight a conserved mechanism of phase separation in regulating organelle biogenesis.

Section: Introduction

Chloroplasts of higher plants are essential for photosynthesis and also play critical roles in other important physiological processes, such as lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, cell signaling, and host defense ( Schleiff and Becker, 2011; Rolland et al., 2012; Chi et al., 2013; Hölzl and Dörmann, 2019 11.

Schleiff, E. ∙ Becker, T. Common ground for protein translocation: access control for mitochondria and chloroplasts Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :48-59 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). Chloroplasts contain ∼3,000 proteins, and only a small fraction of these proteins are encoded by the chloroplast genome. Most of the nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursors with an N-terminal targeting signal called transit peptide and are subsequently translocated into chloroplasts ( Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013; Lee et al., 2017 28.

Lee, D.W. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Hwang, I. Sorting of nuclear-encoded chloroplast membrane proteins Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 40 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, one of the remarkable features of chloroplasts is their highly complex structure, with multiple suborganellar membranes (outer envelope, inner envelope, and thylakoid membranes), which thus delineate three separate compartments (intermembrane space, stroma, and lumen). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms of chloroplast protein targeting and sorting is highly challenging.
Nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins are imported across the chloroplast envelope into the stroma by a common import apparatus, namely the Toc/Tic (translocon at the outer/inner envelope of chloroplasts) complex ( Jarvis and López-Juez, 2013; Lee et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018 10. Chen, Y.L. ∙ Chen, L.J. ∙ Chu, C.C. ... TIC236 links the outer and inner membrane translocons of the chloroplast Nature. 2018; 564 :125-129 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar 28.

Lee, D.W. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Hwang, I. Sorting of nuclear-encoded chloroplast membrane proteins Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 40 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Once a preprotein reaches the stromal side of the chloroplast envelope and its transit peptide has been cleaved off by the stromal processing peptidase, in many cases, the protein is further targeted to its correct sub-compartment within the chloroplast ( Schleiff and Becker, 2011 51. Schleiff, E. ∙ Becker, T. Common ground for protein translocation: access control for mitochondria and chloroplasts Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :48-59 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). For example, some proteins are reinserted into the inner envelope membrane after being released into the stroma ( Viana et al., 2010; Chiu and Li, 2008 12. Chiu, C.C. ∙ Li, H.M. Tic40 is important for reinsertion of proteins from the chloroplast stroma into the inner membrane Plant J. 2008; 56 :793-801 Crossref Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar 60.

Chem. 2010; 285 :12948-12960 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other imported proteins, mainly those involved in the photosynthetic functions, are targeted via different pathways to the thylakoid membranes ( Cline and Dabney-Smith, 2008; Li and Chiu, 2010 14. Cline, K. ∙ Dabney-Smith, C. Plastid protein import and sorting: different paths to the same compartments Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11 :585-592 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar 33. Li, H.M. ∙ Chiu, C.C. Protein transport into chloroplasts Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61 :157-180 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thylakoid membrane proteins may be inserted spontaneously or use one of the aforementioned pathways, or engage in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) pathway that is employed predominantly by light harvesting proteins ( Schuenemann et al., 1998; DeLille et al., 2000 17. DeLille, J. ∙ Peterson, E.C. ∙ Johnson, T. ... A novel precursor recognition element facilitates posttranslational binding to the signal recognition particle in chloroplasts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A novel signal recognition particle targets light-harvesting proteins to the thylakoid membranes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :10312-10316 Crossref Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thylakoid lumen proteins usually carry further targeting information at their N-terminal end, which guides them via the chloroplast secretory (cpSec) or the chloroplast twin arginine translocation (cpTat) pathways ( Yuan et al., 1994; Settles et al., 1997 54. Settles, A.M. ∙ Yonetani, A. ∙ Baron, A. ... Sec-independent protein translocation by the maize Hcf106 protein Science. 1997; 278 :1467-1470 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar 62. Yuan, J. ∙ Henry, R. ∙ McCaffery, M. ... SecA homolog in protein transport within chloroplasts: evidence for endosymbiont-derived sorting Science. 1994; 266 :796-798 Crossref Scopus (146) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cpSec pathway requires an ATPase, cpSecA, and the translocation channel consisting of cpSecY and cpSecE, and is involved in the transport of several lumenal proteins including plastocyanin and the 33-kDa protein of the oxygen-evolving complex (OE33) ( Schleiff and Becker, 2011 51. Schleiff, E. ∙ Becker, T. Common ground for protein translocation: access control for mitochondria and chloroplasts Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12 :48-59 Crossref Scopus (206) PubMed Google Scholar ). The cpTat machinery consists of the membrane proteins Tha4, Hcf106, and cpTatC. Hcf106 and cpTatC have been shown to form a large 700 kDa receptor complex in thylakoids and provide the initial binding site for substrates, and Tha4 exists as a separate complex that interacts with the receptor complex during protein transport ( Ma and Cline, 2010 35. Ma, X. ∙ Cline, K. Multiple precursor proteins bind individual Tat receptor complexes and are collectively transported EMBO J. 2010; 29 :1477-1488 Crossref Scopus (45) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In general, substrate targeting to different pathways depends on the specific signal in the substrate protein itself ( Cline and Dabney-Smith, 2008; Lee et al., 2017 14. Cline, K. ∙ Dabney-Smith, C. Plastid protein import and sorting: different paths to the same compartments Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2008; 11 :585-592 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Lee, D.W. ∙ Lee, J. ∙ Hwang, I. Sorting of nuclear-encoded chloroplast membrane proteins Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2017; 40 :1-7 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, how the targeting signals are recognized and the mechanisms by which the imported proteins are directed across the crowded stromal environment to the different thylakoid receptors are still largely unknown. In this study, we identify and characterize two ankyrin proteins, STT1 and STT2 that form a hetero-complex to selectively direct cpTat proteins to their thylakoid translocon through a liquid-liquid phase separation mechanism. Our study further demonstrates that weak multivalent interactions between STT complex and cpTat signal peptide are critical for phase separation. Thus, this work provides insights into both protein sorting mechanisms and liquid-like biological systems.

Section: Results

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying protein sorting to the cpTat translocon, we screened for proteins that interact with the Arabidopsis cpTat pathway substrate OE23. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that an ankyrin protein EMB506 strongly interacted with OE23 ( Figure 1 A). EMB506 was previously identified as a chloroplast protein that participates in plastid differentiation and plant development in Arabidopsis ( Albert et al., 1999 1. Albert, S. ∙ Després, B. ∙ Guilleminot, J. ... The EMB 506 gene encodes a novel ankyrin repeat containing protein that is essential for the normal development of Arabidopsis embryos Plant J. 1999; 17 :169-179 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Further analysis revealed that EMB506 also interacts with other substrates of the cpTat pathway, including OE17 and PsaN but not with the substrates of the cpSec pathway like OE33 ( Figure 1 A). To investigate whether EMB506 functions in cpTat substrate protein targeting, we first checked the ability of the EMB506 to target cpTat substrates to their translocon on the thylakoid membrane. To rule out the effect of membrane-attached stroma proteins in the transport process, thylakoid membranes were additionally treated with NaBr to remove all EMB506 proteins but not cpTat components ( Frielingsdorf et al., 2008 21. Frielingsdorf, S. ∙ Jakob, M. ∙ Klösgen, R.B. A stromal pool of TatA promotes Tat-dependent protein transport across the thylakoid membrane J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :33838-33845 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (26) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures 1 C and 1D). As shown in Figure 1 E, only a small amount of radiolabeled iOE23 was detected in thylakoid membranes after NaBr treatment. However, addition of EMB506 did not significantly increase the binding efficiency of the cpTat substrate to thylakoid membranes. These results indicate that other stromal factors are also needed for the cpTat substrate targeting process.
Sequence similarity analysis revealed another chloroplast ankyrin-repeat protein AKRP with high sequence identity to EMB506, and our yeast two-hybrid results showed that AKRP also specifically interacts with cpTat substrates ( Figure 1 B). The interactions between these two ankyrin proteins and cpTat substrates were further confirmed by pull-down experiments ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Similar to EMB506, AKRP alone did not significantly increase the binding efficiency of iOE23 to thylakoid membranes. In contrast, there was a marked increase of iOE23 bound to thylakoid membranes when both EMB506 and AKRP were added ( Figure 1 E). These results suggest that EMB506 and AKRP together could facilitate substrate binding to thylakoid membranes. Therefore, we renamed EMB506 and AKRP proteins STT1 and STT2, respectively, as they are specifically involved in sorting of cpTat substrates to thylakoid membranes.
We next investigated whether the membrane-bound iOE23 was competent for translocation across the cpTat translocation channel into the lumen. As shown in Figure 1 F, few mature OE23 (mOE23) was detected when in vitro synthetized iOE23 was incubated with NaBr-treated thylakoid membranes. However, addition of both STT1 and STT2 significantly increased the import efficiency, and most of iOE23 could be processed to the mature form in 20 min. As expected, translocation of iOE23 was blocked when either STT1 or STT2 was absent. These results indicate that STT1 and STT2 may function in a coordinated manner to facilitate substrate targeting to the cpTat receptor complex.
Inactivation of STT1 or STT2 results in embryo lethality, consistent with above results that they are not functionally redundant ( Garcion et al., 2006 22. Garcion, C. ∙ Guilleminot, J. ∙ Kroj, T. ... AKRP and EMB506 are two ankyrin repeat proteins essential for plastid differentiation and plant development in Arabidopsis Plant J. 2006; 48 :895-906 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). To further dissect the roles of the STT proteins, RNAi transgenic lines were generated for the STT1 and STT2 genes. As shown in Figures S1 A and S1B, downregulation of STT1 or STT2 led to retarded growth, pale green leaves, as well as to reduced chlorophyll levels and abnormal plastids that lack stacked thylakoid membranes ( Figure S1 C). These results suggest that STT1 and STT2 play important roles in thylakoid membrane biogenesis during plastid development.
To further explore the molecular functions of the STT proteins, we examined the effect of STT1 and STT2 depletion on the accumulation of photosynthetic proteins. Immunoblot analysis showed that cpTat pathway substrates including OE23, OE17, PsaN, and PsbT were most significantly compromised, whereas cpSec pathway substrate OE33, cpSRP pathway substrates Lhcb1 and Lhca3, and spontaneous pathway substrate CF0II were only moderately affected in both RNAi transgenic plants ( Figure S1 D), indicating that STT1 and STT2 are both critical for the accumulation of the cpTat pathway substrates. In addition, components of the protein import machinery, such as Tic20, and the cpTat translocon, including Hcf106, Tha4, and cpTatC as well as chaperones like Hsp70, were not or only marginally affected in transgenic plants ( Figure S1 D), ruling out the possibility that the reduction of cpTat pathway substrates was due to impairment of STT1 and STT2 translocation into chloroplasts. We also found that PsaA/B and D1 protein showed remarkable reduction in both RNAi lines. This is consistent with previous reports that deficiencies of cpTat pathway substrates lead to reduced accumulation of photosystem core proteins ( Settles et al., 1997; Motohashi et al., 2001 43. Motohashi, R. ∙ Nagata, N. ∙ Ito, T. ... An essential role of a TatC homologue of a Delta pH- dependent protein transporter in thylakoid membrane formation during chloroplast development in Arabidopsis thaliana Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98 :10499-10504 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar 54. Settles, A.M. ∙ Yonetani, A. ∙ Baron, A. ... Sec-independent protein translocation by the maize Hcf106 protein Science. 1997; 278 :1467-1470 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Taken together, these results suggest that STT1 and STT2 play critical roles in the stable assembly of cpTat pathway substrates.
To further investigate the function of STTs, STT1-STT2 interaction was tested using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) in Arabidopsis protoplasts. BiFC assay confirmed a direct interaction between STT1 and STT2 ( Figure 2 A). Sucrose density gradient sedimentation assays with stromal extracts further suggested the existence of a STT1-STT2 complex in planta ( Figure 2 B). Taken together, these results led us to explore if STT1 and STT2 could form a ternary complex with substrate for targeting. Signals of radioactive-labeled pOE23 were visualized as a sharp band when in vitro translated radio-labeled precursor OE23 (pOE23) was incubated with the purified STT complex, suggesting that the STT complex could bind to pOE23 in vitro . The same results were obtained when purified proteins were replaced with chloroplast stroma isolated from Arabidopsis ( Figure 2 C). However, pOE23 was not detected with stroma extract pre-treated with antibodies against STT1 or STT2 ( Figure 2 C). Taken together, these results indicate that STT1 and STT2 form a complex that facilitates the binding of cpTat pathway substrates in vitro and in vivo .
We next examined whether the STT complex recognizes specific regions within cpTat substrates. Amino acid sequence analysis indicates that both STT1 and STT2 harbor an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and a C-terminal domain with five ankyrin repeats ( Figure S2 A). BiFC assays demonstrated that deletion of the ankyrin domain of STT1 and STT2 abolished the interaction between STT1 and STT2, indicating that the ankyrin domain is critical for the STT complex formation ( Figure 2 A). Moreover, deletion of IDRs of either STT1 or STT2 substantially impacts binding of OE23 to the STT complex as revealed by pull-down assays ( Figure 2 D). On the other hand, deletion analysis of OE23 revealed that the cpTat transit peptide (TP, residues 1–77) is important for interaction with the STT complex ( Figure 2 E). In summary, our results suggest that the IDRs of STT1 and STT2 associate with the transit peptide of the cpTat pathway substrates.
Binding of the OE23 transit peptide by the STT complex was also investigated by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Because of its hydrophobicity, the OE23 transit peptide was solubilized in the detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). As shown in Figure 2 G, the STT complex was able to bind the LMNG-solubilized synthetic transit peptide of OE23 (K D = 8 μM) at an approximately 1:1 protein: peptide ratio. CpTat pathway substrates possess transit peptides that contain a stromal (STP) and a lumenal targeting peptide (LTP) ( Figure 2 F). To further dissect the transit peptide recognition activity, several OE23 transit peptide deletions were used for ITC analysis. As shown in Figure 2 G, deletion of the STP domain slightly reduces the binding affinity to the STT complex (K D = 10 μM). However, substitution of the RR motif or the hydrophobic residues of the H domain to alanines substantially impacts the binding to the STT complex, with a ∼20-fold and ∼10-fold higher K D , respectively ( Figure 2 G). Thus, both the RR motif and the H domain in LTP are required for binding to the STT complex. However, the interaction between the LTP of cpSec substrate OE33 and STT complex was not detected ( Figure 2 G), which highlights the specificity of substrate recognition by STT complex.
To understand the molecular basis of STT1 and STT2 action in cpTat substrate recognition and targeting, we undertook a structural analysis of Arabidopsis STT1 and STT2. When STT1 or STT2 are expressed individually, they tend to form heterogeneous aggregates in vitro ( Figure S2 B). Analysis by gel filtration chromatography revealed that STT1 and STT2 could form a hetero-dimer in the presence of 200 mM NaCl, but tend to form higher-order oligomers in the presence of 50 mM NaCl ( Figure 3 C). We next crystallized the heteromeric complex in buffer containing 200 mM NaCl.
The crystal structure of the STT hetero-dimer complex from Arabidopsis was determined at 2.2 Å resolution ( Table S1 ). Because the IDRs of STT1 and STT2 are highly mobile, residues 40–112 of STT1 and residues 37–231 of STT2 could not be accurately modeled into the electron density. Both the monomer structures of STT1 and STT2 were further characterized as two N-terminal helices (α1 and α2, residues 114–150 in STT1, residues 232–258 in STT2) and five ankyrin repeats (Ank1 to 5, residues 151–311 in STT1; Ank1 to 5, residues 259–419 in STT2) that showed the typical fold of ankyrin repeats with a helix-turn-helix motif. STT1 and STT2 interact with each other in an antiparallel configuration through the N-terminal helices and the ankyrin repeats ( Figures 3 A and 3B). The STT hetero-dimer is primarily formed by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Overall, the two N-terminal helices and Ank1 repeats of one STT form a unique concave surface that lock Ank4-5 of the other STT, and Ank1-3 from STT1 interact with Ank3-1 of STT2 further strengthening the dimeric organization of the STT complex to form an ellipsoidal core structure ( Figures 3 A and 3B).
An electrostatic surface potential map shows two large electropositive regions within the ellipsoidal structure, one is along the edge of STT1; the other is along the edge of STT2 ( Figures 3 A and 3B). These charged residues within the electropositive regions are highly conserved in higher plants ( Figure S2 C). Substitution of the conserved positively charged residues with alanines (SCPCA) did not affect transit peptide binding ( Figure S3 ), but severely prevented STT oligomerization in the low salt buffer ( Figure 3 C). Moreover, these changes within the ellipsoidal structure severely compromised overall cpTat substrate targeting to receptor complex ( Figure 3 D). These results indicate that the conserved positively charged residues within the ankyrin domain are critical for STT oligomerization as well as for cpTat substrate targeting.
There is no obvious, clearly defined peptide binding cleft on the surface of the ellipsoidal structure ( Figures 3 A and 3B); indeed, ITC-based titration assays also demonstrated that deletion of the IDRs of either STT1 or STT2 substantially impaired binding of cpTat transit peptide to the STT complex, showing an ∼20-fold and ∼10-fold higher K D , respectively ( Figure S3 ). These results are consistent with the pull-down assay indicating that the binding of the cpTat transit peptide to the STT complex depends on their IDRs. Amino acid sequence analysis reveals several conserved motifs rich in negatively charged and hydrophobic residues within the IDRs of the STTs, including WEEPD (residues 71–85) in STT1 and LVP-W (residues 105–126) in STT2 ( Figure S2 C). Substitution of the negatively charged residues of WEEPD motif in STT1 or the hydrophobic residues of LVP-W motif in STT2 with alanines remarkably reduced the binding affinity between STT complex and LTP, indicating that these two conserved motifs are essential for binding ( Figure S3 ). Consistent with the ITC assay, substitution mutations within these two motifs also displayed significantly reduced substrate targeting activity ( Figure 3 D).
During the sample preparation for ITC experiments, we found that upon mixing STT complex and LTP of OE23 above certain concentrations, the solution becomes very rapidly opalescent. This observation is indicative of liquid-liquid phase separation, a characteristic of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions and the capacity for multivalence ( Han et al., 2012; Hyman et al., 2014; Banani et al., 2017; Uversky, 2017 3.

Intrinsically disordered proteins in overcrowded milieu: Membrane-less organelles, phase separation, and intrinsic disorder Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2017; 44 :18-30 Crossref Scopus (485) PubMed Google Scholar ). To test this further, we examined the STT complex and OE23 LTP mixture with 1:1 ratio by light microscopy and observed numerous small spherical droplets with various diameters shortly after mixing, a phenomenon characteristic of a liquid-to-liquid phase separation ( Figure 4 A). In addition, this induced phase separation of the STT complex was sharply concentration-dependent and occurred when the concentration of STT and LTP reaches 2.5 μM ( Figure 4 A). Previous studies together with our data have shown that Tat translocon components including TorD, NapD, DmsD, cpTatC/Hcf106, and STTs may bind the Tat substrate with a 1:1 stoichiometry ( Maillard et al., 2007; Ma and Cline, 2013; Dow et al., 2013; Winstone and Turner, 2015 18.

Thermodynamic characterization of the DmsD binding site for the DmsA twin-arginine motif Biochemistry. 2015; 54 :2040-2051 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). Considering that the concentration of substrate transported in vivo may be lower than that of the STTs, we also checked whether low concentrations of cpTat substrate could induce the phase separation of STTs. Our results showed that 0.5 μM in vitro -translated OE23 precursor could also induce the STTs (2.5 μM) phase separation ( Figure 4 B). In contrast, when the STT complex was mixed with the LTP of the cpSec substrate OE33 at 50 μM, the solution remained clear ( Figure 4 A). These results suggest that the cpTat signal peptide may specifically induce a phase separation of the STT complex in vitro .
To analyze the molecular composition of the condensed liquid phase, we mixed labeled STT complex tagged with a fluorescent label (STT1-GFP and STT2-mCherry) with OE23 LTP. We found that STT1-GFP and STT2-mCherry were located within the same droplets ( Figure 4 C). Next, we performed a sedimentation assay to separate the condensed liquid phase from the bulk aqueous solutions by centrifugation and assessed protein components in each fraction ( Figure 4 D). For the 1:1 molar ratio of STT complex and OE23 transit peptide at 20 μM concentration, approximately half of STT1-GFP, STT2-mCherry, and OE23 LTP were recovered in the condensed liquid phase, indicating that the drops contain STT1, STT2, and OE23 LTP ( Figure 4 D). Furthermore, STT1-GFP, STT2-mCherry, and OE23 LTP containing small liquid droplets were able to fuse into larger ones ( Figure 4 C). Moreover, experiments of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) showed that the fluorescence was efficiently recovered in a few minutes when bleaching was performed after the initiation of phase separation ( Figure 4 E). Thus, STT complex and OE23 LTP are mobile within the liquid droplets and constantly exchange between droplets and the surrounding aqueous solution.
Next, we examined the role of the STT1, STT2, and LTP of OE23 interactions in the phase transition of the complex. First, although the IDRs itself is a low-complexity region, incubation of STT1 or STT2 individually with LTP did not form spherical droplets, but produced only irregular aggregates, indicating that the prerequisite for the occurrence of liquid-liquid phase separation is the formation of STT oligomers ( Figure S4 A). Moreover, when the residues of electropositive regions within the ellipsoidal structure of individual STT1 or STT2 were changed to alanines to inhibit the formation of STT oligomers, the resulting STT mutant complex could only form smaller droplets with LTP peptide. When all the conserved positive residues of the STT electropositive regions were mutated, the resulting STT mutant complex could not induce phase transition after mixing with LTP ( Figure S4 A), consistent with the implication that formation of oligomers is required for phase transition upon binding to LTP.
Second, compared to LTP, the STT complex formed more and larger liquid droplets with TP (transit peptide) in the same buffer ( Figure S4 A). However, the STT complex formed only tiny droplets with the inactive variant signal peptide in which the arginines of the RR motif or the hydrophobic residues of the H domain were changed to alanines, and the droplets were clearly absent when both the RR motif and H domain were mutated. Substitution of the residues of the LTP binding motif within the STTs prevented phase separation ( Figure S4 A). Thus, besides formation of STT oligomers, the STTs-LTP binding reaction is also required for this phase separation. These results suggest that multivalent electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions between STT1, STT2, and LTP drive liquid-liquid phase separation. Indeed, this process was weakened by increasing NaCl or 1,6-hexanediol concentrations ( Figure S4 B).
To examine whether phase separation of STTs plays a role in cargo sorting, a substrate targeting analysis was performed. When the key amino acids implicated in phase separation in the STTs were mutated, these changes severely compromised STT phase separation as well as cpTat substrate targeting to receptor complex ( Figures 3 D and 4 F). Moreover, the addition of 300 mM NaCl or 2.5 μM 1,6-hexanediol also significantly inhibited cpTat substrate targeting by the STT complex ( Figure 3 D). These results point to the physiological importance of STT droplets in cpTat cargo targeting.
Next, we tested whether the STT complex can undergo phase separation in plant chloroplasts. Many puncta were observed in cells when STT1-GFP or STT2-GFP was individually co-expressed with OE23 ( Figure 5 A). However, FRAP analysis demonstrated that the punctate fluorescence signals of STT1-GFP/OE23 or STT2-GFP/OE23 do not recover at all after photo-bleaching ( Figures 5 A and 5B), which is consistent with the results that STT1 or STT2 individually tend to form aggregates. Nicely correlated with the in vitro phase separation experiment with the STT-cpTat signal peptide complex shown in Figure 5 C, no puncta but a diffuse pattern was detected when STT1-GFP and STT2-mCherry were co-transformed into plant cells, whereas when full-length OE23 or its transit peptide was co-transformed with STT1-GFP and STT2-mCherry, most of signals were in puncta ( Figure S4 C). To further confirm that OE23 is indeed present within the STT puncta, OE23 TP-BFP or OE23-BFP was co-transformed with fluorescent-labeled STT. The results showed many bright puncta with GFP, mCherry, and BFP signals, indicating that the puncta are enriched with STT1, STT2, and OE23 ( Figure 5 C). Furthermore, FRAP analysis demonstrated that the STT1-STT2-OE23 signals within the puncta were recovered within a few minutes, indicating that STT1-STT2-OE23 bodies in the puncta rapidly exchange with those in the surrounding chloroplast after bleaching ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Finally, time-lapse phase-contrast imaging analysis showed that multiple cells and chloroplasts in which STT1-STT2-OE23 speckles displayed at least one fusion event within a period of 10 min ( Figure 5 D). Lipid vesicles have been shown to fuse with each other and to produce larger vesicles ( Milovanovic et al., 2018; van Niel et al., 2018 40. Milovanovic, D. ∙ Wu, Y. ∙ Bian, X. ... A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles Science. 2018; 361 :604-607 Crossref Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar 59. van Niel, G. ∙ D’Angelo, G. ∙ Raposo, G. Shedding light on the cell biology of extracellular vesicles Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19 :213-228 Crossref Scopus (5081) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, protoplast staining with the membrane-selective fluorescent dye FM4-64 showed that STTs did not co-localize with vesicles ( Figure 5 C) indicating that STT droplets may not be vesicles. Collectively, these results indicate that the STTs and cpTat substrate-enriched puncta formed in cells are condensed liquid phase droplets.
Amino acid changes of the RR motif in OE23 or the WEEPD motif in STT1 reduced puncta formation ( Figure S4 C). Similarly, substitution of the hydrophobic residues of the H motif in OE23 or the LVP-W motif in STT2 to alanines also significantly decreased puncta formation ( Figure S4 C). Substitution of the conserved positively charged residues within the ankyrin domains of individual STT1 or STT2 also led to fewer puncta ( Figure S4 C). In addition, changes of both RR and H motifs in OE23, of both WEEPD and LVP-W motifs in the STTs, or of all the conserved positively charged residues within the ankyrin domains of the STTs completely inhibited the formation of puncta ( Figure S4 C). These results indicate that OE23-induced STT-enriched puncta formation depends on the specific and multivalent interactions between STT1, STT2, and signal peptide of the cpTat substrate.
Our results showed that the fluorescent signal of STT1-OE23 and STT2-OE23 did not recover after photobleaching ( Figure 5 A). However, in the cells, both endogenous STT1 and STT2 should be expressed and thereby form complexes with STT2-GFP or STT1-GFP, respectively. Thus, the failure of fluorescent signal recovery after photobleaching could be due to overexpression of cpTat substrate with one STT protein, which may lead to the formation of aggregates. In order to test whether the STT puncta signal is generated by overexpression, we expressed fluorescent-labeled STTs with their authentic promoters in Arabidopsis . We first isolated and identified the STT1 / stt1 and STT2 / stt2 heterozygote plants, then complemented them with fluorescent-labeled STT cDNA driven by the endogenous STT promoter ( STT1p::STT1-GFP / stt1 and STT2p::STT2-mCherry / stt2 ). These transgenic plants complemented with wild-type (WT) STT cDNA grew normally as WT plants, and they also showed similar chlorophyll and photosynthetic proteins levels as WT ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Moreover, as shown in Figure 6 C, the STTs still could form puncta in plants with their own promoters.
To further investigate the cellular functions of STT droplets in plant chloroplasts, we also generated transgenic plants, in which key residues implicated in phase separation were mutated in STT1 or STT2 (see STAR Methods ). We first examined whether these mutations would affect puncta formation in transgenic plants. As shown in Figure 6 C, STT mutant transgenic plants ( STT promoter) all showed markedly reduced puncta signals compared to plants complemented with WT STT cDNA, an observation consistent with the results in Figure S4 C that show less enrichment of puncta when expressing the mutated STT driven by the 35S promoter in protoplasts ( Figure 6 C). Furthermore, these transgenic plants complemented with mutated STT cDNA displayed a pale green phenotype, reduced chlorophyll levels, as well as significantly lower amounts of photosynthetic proteins, especially the substrates of the cpTat pathway ( Figures 6 A and 6B). These results indicate that key residues implicated in phase separation by STT1 and STT2 in vitro are critical for photosynthesis as well as for the accumulation of the cpTat pathway substrates.
Next, we further investigated whether these mutations would affect the cpTat substrate translocation activity. As shown in Figure 6 D, compared to WT plants, chloroplasts isolated from STT mutants transgenic lines ( STT promoter) showed greatly compromised protein transport efficiency for the cpTat pathway substrate pOE23, with more accumulated precursor and intermediate but lower level of mature protein. However, we did not observe any significant difference of the translocation pattern of the cpSec substrate pOE33 between the WT and all the transgenic plants. Taken together, the formation of STT droplets plays a critical role in facilitating cpTat substrates translocation across the stroma and targeting to thylakoid membranes.
The above results demonstrate that STTs binds specifically to chloroplast cpTat proteins and together they form a chloroplast condensate for cpTat substrate binding and targeting. We further examined whether STT1 or STT2 interacted with components involved in the cpTat pathway ( Figures 7 A, S5 A, and S5B). As shown in Figure 7 A, a strong fluorescence signal was observed when STT1 or STT2 was co-transformed with Hcf106 but not with Tha4 and cpTatC. Pull-down assays also demonstrated that STT1 and STT2 specifically interacted with the stromal domain of Hcf106 ( Figure 7 B). Moreover, deletion of IDRs of STT1 and STT2 did not affect the interactions ( Figure S5 C), suggesting that the STT complex formed by the ankyrin domains is responsible for interaction with the stromal region of Hcf106. The stromal domain of Hcf106 is predicted to harbor an amphipathic α-helix (APH, residues 108–147), and a loosely structured carboxyl terminus (LSCT, residues 148–270). Pull-down assays demonstrated that STT complex interacted with the LSCT domain, but not with the APH motif of Hcf106 ( Figure S5 C).
To further identify the specific region responsible for the STT-Hcf106 interaction, three contiguous conserved segments in the LSCT domain of Hcf106, corresponding to residues 148–187 (LSCT-1), 188–227 (LSCT-2), and 228–270 (LSCT-3), were used for pull-down assays. As shown in Figure S5 D, STTs only interacted with LSCT-2 and not with the other segments. Moreover, substitution of several residues of LSCT-2 to alanines abolished the interactions between STTs and Hcf106 by BiFC assay ( Figure S5 E). Together, these results suggest that residues 188–227 in the LSCT domain of Hcf106 are essential for the STT-Hcf106 interaction.
Our results show that mixing LSCT-2 peptide with purified STT complex prevents STT oligomerization ( Figure 3 C). Amino acid alignment revealed a conserved ED-EE motif within LSCT-2 peptide ( Figure 7 C). Our ITC results also show that electrostatic interactions between positively charged residues of STTs and negatively charged residues of LSCT-2 peptide play a key role in binding of the STT complex to Hcf106 ( Figure 7 D). As positively charged residues within the ankyrin domain of the STTs appear to be crucial for oligomerization and phase separation, we propose that direct electrostatic interactions between Hcf106 and STTs may repress STT oligomerization and phase transition. To test this, we added LSCT-2 peptide to the STT complex and OE23 LTP mixture and monitored droplet formation. Notably, droplet formation was significantly suppressed by addition of LSCT-2 peptide, indicating that Hcf106 is able to reverse phase transition of the LTP-induced STT complex ( Figure 7 E). In contrast, substitution of the conserved negatively charged residues of LSCT-2 peptide to alanines (SCNCA) has no such effect. The LSCT-2 peptide presumably binds to a basic patch on the surface of the STT heterodimer and can compete for phase separation of the STTs with OE23 LTP. However, the full-length form of Hcf106 may interact multivalently with the STTs, which could independently affect phase separation. Thus, STT-Hcf106 electrostatic interactions could play an important role for docking and for the release the substrate to the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex. We also tested whether the STTs form three-component droplets with OE23 and Hcf106 by sedimentation assay. When the 1:1:1 molar ratio of labeled STT complex, OE23 LTP, and LCST peptide was mixed at 10 μM concentration, most of STT1-GFP, STT2-mCherry, and OE23 LTP were recovered from the condensed liquid phase, while no LCST peptide was found in the condensed liquid phase ( Figure 7 F). Thus, these results derived from in vitro studies suggest that Hcf106 inhibits the STTs-OE23 phase separation and does not form three-component droplets with the STTs and OE23.
We next investigated whether the LSCT-2 domain-mediated STT-Hcf106 interaction is essential for substrate translocation across thylakoid membranes. To this end, we added the synthesized LSCT-2 peptide as a competitor of the STT complex and evaluated the substrate import efficiency. As shown in Figure 7 G, LSCT-2 peptide strongly inhibits the translocation of OE23 and OE17, whereas addition of equal amounts of the two adjacent segments, LSCT-1 or LSCT-3, has little effects. As expected, translocation of OE33 was not affected by addition of the LSCT-2 competitor peptide. In summary, our results suggest that docking of the STT complex to the Hcf106 translocon is essential for substrate translocation across the thylakoid membrane.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we have identified and functionally characterized two novel plant-specific ankyrin proteins STT1 and STT2 that are essential for the recognition of cpTat substrates and their subsequent routing to the cpTat translocon through a liquid-liquid phase transition process. This study provides the first insights into the routing mechanisms of cpTat substrate in the cpTat-dependent transport pathway within chloroplasts and also provides important clues on how substrate proteins are sorted within a crowded cellular compartment.
We have demonstrated that STT oligomers could form condensed, membrane-lacking compartments upon incubation with cpTat substrates both in vitro and in living cells ( Figures 4 , 5 , and 6 ). First, in vitro substrate targeting assays show that failure to form liquid droplets directly affects substrate targeting to thylakoid membranes ( Figures 1 E, 1F, and 3 D), excluding the possibility that the STT droplet is an in vitro artifact. Second, STTs liquid droplets are still formed when the STTs are driven by their authentic promoters in planta ( Figure 6 C). Furthermore, changes of the key amino acids implicated in phase separation not only lead to a significant decrease in STT puncta formation but also impair translocation of cpTat pathway substrates thereby underlining the in vivo physiological relevance of the STT liquid droplets ( Figures 6 B–6D). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that STT1 and STT2 function in sorting the substrates to the thylakoid cpTat translocon through liquid-liquid phase separation.
The liquid-like nature of the STT phase body appears to be mediated by binding of STT IDRs to the cpTat signal peptide. Indeed, disruption of the interaction between IDRs and cpTat signal peptide inhibits the formation of liquid droplets in vivo and in vitro ( Figures 4 F, 6 C, and S4 ). The exact nature of the binding between cpTat substrate and STT is unknown, but it is likely that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions play important roles. Consistent with this proposal, high salt concentration or 1,6-hexanediol significantly inhibits the STT phase body formation ( Figure S4 B). Moreover, the IDRs of STT contain a conserved negatively charged WEEPD and a hydrophobic LVP-W motif, which are responsible for multivalent binding to the positively charged RR motif and the hydrophobic H domain of the LTP of cpTat substrates, respectively ( Figures 2 G and S3 ), and there are additional highly conserved regions within both IDRs that may also contribute to interactions with substrates ( Figure S2 C). Our ITC assays also show that the binding affinity between STT and cpTat substrate is relatively weak (binding affinity ∼10 μΜ, Figure 2 G). Thus, our results suggest that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to the weak multivalent interactions between STT and cpTat substrate in the liquid body.
STT1 and STT2 form a unique ellipsoidal-like core structure through the antiparallel interaction of their ankyrin domains in which a dimerization module occludes the ANK groove usually used as a cargo interaction site ( Stengel et al., 2008 56. Stengel, K.F. ∙ Holdermann, I. ∙ Cain, P. ... Structural basis for specific substrate recognition by the chloroplast signal recognition particle protein cpSRP43 Science. 2008; 321 :253-256 Crossref Scopus (78) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, stabilization of the oligomer by the ankyrin domains allows the IDRs to act as flexible entities that bind to substrate by weak and specific interactions, a critical feature for phase separation.
Such a structure may have two functions. First, the ellipsoidal structure formed by the ankyrin domains may function as a stabilizing core to avoid aggregate formation during the assembly of the STT phase body. Indeed, STTs expressed individually tend to form aggregates rather than liquid droplets upon incubation with cpTat signal peptides ( Figure S4 A). Second, the different charge distribution between IDRs and ankyrin core structure may facilitate STT oligomerization that is critical for phase separation. The sequence and structural analysis showed that the IDRs of STTs are acidic ( Figure S6 A; STT1-IDR, pI = 4.23; STT2-IDR, pI = 5.51) and rich in conserved negatively charged residues, while the ankyrin domains are basic ( Figure S6 A; STT1-ANK, pI = 8.95; STT2-ANK, pI = 7.94) and rich in conserved positively charged residues distributed at the surface of the ankyrin core structure. Because substitution of the positively charged residues with alanines or deletions of the IDRs of STTs inhibit STT oligomerization and phase separation completely ( Figures 4 F and S4 ), we propose that the electrostatic interactions between IDRs and ANK are critical for STT oligomerization and phase separation. Thus, the novel structural properties of STTs are critical for multivalent interactions driving phase transition.
Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions are essential for STT complex oligomerization and phase separation; i.e., the arginine residues of the cpTat peptide bind to the conserved negatively charged residues of the IDRs and promote phase separation of STT. As the LTP peptide of OE23 is not highly charged, it is possible that OE23 allosterically activates the STT complex to undergo phase separation. While the negatively charged motif of the LSCT domain of HCF106 (pI = 4.11, Figure S6 A) binds to the electropositive regions within the STT core structure and inhibits oligomerization and phase separation of STT (see model, Figure S6 B).
The formation of liquid droplets may be also an important strategy for protecting hydrophobic signal peptides from degradation. Additionally, STT-mediated phase separation has two additional physiological advantages. First, formation of droplets may facilitate the rapid movement of STT-substrate bodies from envelope to thylakoid membrane, as both FRAP analysis and fusion experiments show that STT-formed liquid droplets are mobile and exchange rapidly with those in the surrounding chloroplast stroma ( Figure 5 A). Second, it can selectively direct some photosynthetic proteins to specific chloroplast compartments through signal peptide recognition. The cpTat substrates with lumen targeting sequences would be highly aggregation-prone in stroma space due to their overall hydrophobicity. However, FRAP analysis revealed that STTs-OE23 oligomers in liquid droplets are not aggregates ( Figure 5 A). Thus, cpTat proteins in droplets can keep their conformation and activity making them competent for targeting and translocation across the thylakoid membranes.
Protein translocation across a membrane is generally directed by a signal peptide contained in the nascent polypeptides ( Cross et al., 2009; Berks, 2015; Pfanner et al., 2019 5. Berks, B.C.

Mitochondrial proteins: from biogenesis to functional networks Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20 :267-284 Crossref Scopus (569) PubMed Google Scholar ). Effective signal recognition and subsequent protein translocation across the membrane are ensured by chaperone molecules that usually bind to nascent polypeptides and keep them translocation competent. The binding of molecular chaperones with substrate signal peptides might be a weak multivalent reaction, which not only ensures highly specific substrate recognition but also facilitates the release of protein substrate to receptor complex ( Chartron et al., 2016; Ulfig et al., 2017; Mayer and Gierasch, 2019 8.

Weak multivalent interactions have been proposed to mediate biological phase separation in other liquid-like organelles ( Li et al., 2012; Mitrea and Kriwacki, 2016; Freeman Rosenzweig et al., 2017 20.

Thus, formation of liquid droplets may be an effective strategy for facilitating cargo sorting in these crowded compartments. Several key components for protein intra-organelle sorting also have IDRs, including components PEX5 and PEX13 of the A. thaliana and M. musculus peroxisomal protein translocation machinery ( Barros-Barbosa et al., 2019 4.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10 :220-227 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 ). IDRs have been widely implicated in conferring liquid-like properties and mediating phase separation with non-membrane-bound organelles ( Li et al., 2012; Molliex et al., 2015 34.

Thus, for the first time, we report that phase separation drives intra-chloroplast cargo sorting. Moreover, our data also suggest that phase separation is a universal and conserved mechanism for driving cellular substrate sorting.

After confirmation by sequencing, the wild-type and mutant fragments were PCR amplified using Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TakaRa) then inserted into the BamHI site of pCAMBIA1300 using a homologous recombination kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd.). The resulting constructs were electroporated into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 and then introduced into the STT1/stt1 or STT2/stt2 heterozygote plants via the floral infiltration method. STT1/stt1 (CS84664) and STT2/stt2 (CS16041) heterozygous plants were obtain from the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Centers, and the heterozygous state was confirmed by PCR and sequencing (Primers STT1SF, STT1SR or STT2SF, STT2SR).

The primers used were STT1RNAi1F and STT1RNAi1R, STT1RNAi2F and STT1RNAi2R for STT1 , and STT2RNAi1F and STT2RNAi1R, STT2RNAi2F and STT2RNAi2R for STT2 (see Table S2 for primer sequences). The RNAi construct was transformed into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 and introduced into the wild-type plants by the floral dip method ( Clough and Bent, 1998 15. Clough, S.J. ∙ Bent, A.F. Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 1998; 16 :735-743 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Transgenic plants were selected on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 50 μg/ml Basta. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from the leaf tissues of STT1 RNAi line and STT2 RNAi line plants by standard protocols.
For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from the leaf tissues of STT1 RNAi line and STT2 RNAi line as described previously ( Jiang et al., 2019 29. Jiang, J. ∙ Chai, X. ∙ Manavski, N. ... An RNA chaperone-like protein plays critical roles in chloroplast mRNA stability and translation in Arabidopsis and Maize Plant Cell. 2019; 31 :1308-1327 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reverse transcription was performed with 10 μg of total RNA using Superscript RT (Invitrogen) and 10 ng of a random primer in a 100 μL reaction volume. The expression of STT1 or STT2 was determined by RT-PCR using the primers STT1RTF and STT1RTR, STT2RTF and STT2RTR, respectively ( Table S2 ). To ensure equal amounts of RNA were used for each sample, RT-PCR analysis of the actin cDNA was performed using the actinF and actinR primers.
Total protein was extracted from Arabidopsis leaves. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For immunoblot analysis, total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies, and signals from secondary conjugated antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using the Matchmaker Gold Yeast Two-Hybrid System from Clontech according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7 were used to construct the prey and bait plasmids, respectively. The plasmids constructed for yeast assays are listed in Table S2 .

Intact chloroplasts were fractionated into envelope, stromal and thylakoid membranes fractions as described previously ( Ouyang et al., 2011 45. Ouyang, M. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Ma, J. ... LTD is a protein required for sorting light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins to the chloroplast SRP pathway Nat. Commun. 2011; 2 :277 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding reactions were performed as described previously ( Celedon and Cline, 2012 7. Celedon, J.M. ∙ Cline, K. Stoichiometry for binding and transport by the twin arginine translocation system J. Cell Biol. 2012; 197 :523-534 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the optimal NaBr concentration for membrane extraction, thylakoid membranes were treated with NaBr solutions ranging from 0.1 to 1 M, resuspended in HMSN buffer. The in vitro -translated [ 35 S] iOE23 proteins were incubated with isolated thylakoid membranes in the dark at 4°C with end-over-end mixing for 1 h. Binding reactions contained 40 μg chlorophyll of thylakoid membranes and 10 μL of iOE23 proteins in a final volume of 100 μl in low-retention microfuge tubes. Substrate binding assay was performed with isolated wild-type thylakoids by adding radiolabeled iOE23 (about 0.5 μM) and the recombinant STT proteins (about 2.5 μM). Recovered membrane proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by autoradiography to quantify bound iOE23. After the binding reaction, thylakoid membranes were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice, changed tubes each time. The transport reaction was carried out for 25 min in white light (100 μmol m -2 s -1 ) at 25°C, and stopped by transfer to ice and centrifugation at 3,200 g to recover thylakoid membranes ( Celedon and Cline, 2012 7.
