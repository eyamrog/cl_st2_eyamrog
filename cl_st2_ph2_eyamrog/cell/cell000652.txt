Title: PABP/purine-rich motif as an initiation module for cap-independent translation in pattern-triggered immunity


Abstract: Summary

Upon stress, eukaryotes typically reprogram their translatome through GCN2-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, eIF2α, to inhibit general translation initiation while selectively translating essential stress regulators. Unexpectedly, in plants, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) and response to other environmental stresses occur independently of the GCN2/eIF2α pathway. Here, we show that while PTI induces mRNA decapping to inhibit general translation, defense mRNAs with a purine-rich element (“R-motif”) are selectively translated using R-motif as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). R-motif-dependent translation is executed by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) through preferential association with the PTI-activating eIFiso4G over the repressive eIF4G. Phosphorylation by PTI regulators mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 and 6 (MPK3/6) inhibits eIF4G’s activity while enhancing PABP binding to the R-motif and promoting eIFiso4G-mediated defense mRNA translation, establishing a link between PTI signaling and protein synthesis. Given its prevalence in both plants and animals, the PABP/R-motif translation initiation module may have a broader role in reprogramming the stress translatome.

Section: Introduction

Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated in the canonical cap-dependent manner ( Hinnebusch et al., 2016 16. Hinnebusch, A.G. ∙ Ivanov, I.P. ∙ Sonenberg, N.

Cell Biol. 2010; 11 :113-127 Crossref Scopus (1960) PubMed Google Scholar ). To initiate translation, the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi) is loaded onto the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S preinitiation complex (PIC), which is then recruited to the m 7 G-capped 5′ end of an mRNA through the eIF4F complex, composed of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the scaffold protein eIF4G, and the RNA helicase eIF4A. The recruitment of 43S PIC to the 5′ cap is facilitated by the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP), which loops back from the 3′ poly(A) tail of the mRNA by interacting with eIF4G in the eIF4F complex ( Kahvejian et al., 2001 20.

Circularization of mRNA by eukaryotic translation initiation factors Mol. Cell. 1998; 2 :135-140 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (751) PubMed Google Scholar ). In response to stress, general translation initiation is often inhibited through stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α, which reduces the availability of the active ternary complex. Certain stress-responsive mRNAs, such as general control nondepressible 4 ( GCN4 ) in yeast and activating transcription factor 4 ( ATF4 ) in mammals, whose translation is normally inhibited by the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their mRNAs, are preferentially translated at the reduced level of the ternary complex ( Echevarría-Zomeño et al., 2013 14.

Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) with one observed exception ( Liu et al., 2019 26. Liu, X. ∙ Afrin, T. ∙ Pajerowska-Mukhtar, K.M. Arabidopsis GCN2 kinase contributes to ABA homeostasis and stomatal immunity Commun. Biol. 2019; 2 :302 Crossref Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ). This begs the question: how do plants repress the translation of growth-related proteins while selectively translating defense proteins in response to biotic and abiotic stresses?
In our previous study of the PTI translatome, a purine-rich element, “R-motif,” was found to be highly enriched in the 5′ leader sequences of mRNAs with enhanced translational efficiency and to play an essential role in regulating defense protein translation through interaction with PABPs ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the signaling pathway from the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by the pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) to the PABP/R-motif module and the molecular mechanism by which the translatome is reprogrammed for defense remain unknown.
In this study, we report that upon perception of the MAMP, elf18 (N-terminal epitope of the bacterial elongation factor Tu), there is an increase in decapping activity by the decapping protein (DCP) to inhibit the canonical cap-dependent translation. mRNAs with the R-motif use this sequence as a cap surrogate for internal ribosome entry to promote defense protein translation by recruiting PABPs and their differential associations with eIF4G and eIFiso4G. Although PABP-associated eIF4G represses basal resistance, its isomer eIFiso4G facilitates elf18-triggered immunity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the switch from canonical cap-dependent translation to R-motif-mediated translation is triggered by the key PTI regulators MPK3/6 through phosphorylation of PABP, eIF4G, and eIFiso4G with receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) as a scaffold.

Section: Results

To determine how elf18 induces translational reprogramming, we first tested the decapping process, catalyzed by the enzyme decapping 2 (DCP2) along with its co-activator DCP1 and the scaffold protein varicose (VCS) ( Figure S1 A), which is known to control mRNA turnover ( Yu et al., 2019 49. Yu, X. ∙ Li, B. ∙ Jang, G.J. ... Orchestration of processing body dynamics and mRNA decay in Arabidopsis immunity Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :2194-2205.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). We generated transgenic lines overexpressing either the wild-type (WT) DCP2 or the decapping-deficient variant, DCP2 E158Q ( Xu et al., 2006 47. Xu, J. ∙ Yang, J.Y. ∙ Niu, Q.W. ... Arabidopsis DCP2, DCP1, and VARICOSE form a decapping complex required for postembryonic development Plant Cell. 2006; 18 :3386-3398 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the dcp2-1 mutant. We found that the WT DCP2 rescued the growth defect of the mutant, whereas DCP2 E158Q failed to do so ( Figure 1 A). Since DCPs also serve as core components of processing bodies (P-bodies) ( Xu et al., 2006 47. Xu, J. ∙ Yang, J.Y. ∙ Niu, Q.W. ... Arabidopsis DCP2, DCP1, and VARICOSE form a decapping complex required for postembryonic development Plant Cell. 2006; 18 :3386-3398 Crossref Scopus (227) PubMed Google Scholar ), we imaged YFP-tagged DCP2 E158Q to determine its effect on P-body formation. We found that the E158Q mutant protein colocalized with the WT DCP2 ( Figure 1 B), indicating that the phenotype of the dcp2-1 allele is less likely caused by a deficiency in P-body formation than the deficiency in mRNA decapping known for the DCP2 E158Q mutant.
We then used the dcp2-1 mutant to determine whether decapping occurs upon PTI induction and whether it is a selective process to target non-defense mRNAs. We performed the exonuclease sensitivity assay on mRNAs extracted from mock- and elf18- treated WT, dcp2-1 and vcs-7 mutant plants to measure the decapping activity. We found that the housekeeping gene ubiquitin 10 ( UBQ10 ) indeed became sensitive to the exonuclease digestion upon elf18 induction in WT plants but not in the decapping mutants ( Figure 1 C). Surprisingly, mRNAs of TL1-binding transcription factor 1 ( TBF1 ), encoding a key positive immune regulator ( Pajerowska-Mukhtar et al., 2012 31. Pajerowska-Mukhtar, K.M. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Tada, Y. ... The HSF-like transcription factor TBF1 is a major molecular switch for plant growth-to-defense transition Curr. Biol. 2012; 22 :103-112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ), and eight other R-motif-containing defense genes ( Table S1 ), all became more sensitive to exonuclease digestion in a DCP-dependent manner ( Figures 1 D and S1 B–S1I). This conclusion was further confirmed by quantifying mRNAs immunoprecipitated by an antibody against the cap structure before and after elf18 treatment ( Figures S1 J and S1 K).
We next tested whether this elf18-triggered mRNA decapping plays a role in PTI by generating transgenic lines with an inducible artificial microRNA (amiRNA) to transiently knockdown DCP2 ( Schwab et al., 2006 36. Schwab, R. ∙ Ossowski, S. ∙ Riester, M. ... Highly specific gene silencing by artificial microRNAs in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2006; 18 :1121-1133 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ) without the growth defect observed in the dcp2-1 mutant ( Figure 1 A). Quantitative PTI-induced seedling growth inhibition was used as a readout because it likely results from translatome reprogramming. We found all the amiRNA lines partially compromised in elf18-induced plant growth inhibition similarly to the dcp2-1 mutant, whereas the DCP2-HA overexpressing lines (DCP2OE-HA) had no detectible effect ( Figure 1 E), consistent with a previous report ( Yu et al., 2019 49. Yu, X. ∙ Li, B. ∙ Jang, G.J. ... Orchestration of processing body dynamics and mRNA decay in Arabidopsis immunity Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :2194-2205.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these findings demonstrate that elf18-triggered decapping of mRNAs by the DCP complex contributes positively to PTI, possibly by diminishing canonical translational activity required for plant growth.
Since PTI-induced decapping is not specific to growth-related mRNAs, we asked how defense proteins are selectively translated during PTI independently of the cap structure. Our previous study identified a highly enriched purine-rich mRNA consensus sequence, R-motif, in the 5′ leader sequences of mRNAs with increased translational efficiency upon PTI induction ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). We hypothesized that the R-motif might function as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to mediate cap-independent translation of key defense proteins. To test this hypothesis, we used a translational firefly luciferase (FLUC) reporter driven by the TBF1 5′ leader sequence. Our previous studies showed that immune-induced translation of TBF1 is regulated by its 5′ leader sequence containing one R-motif and two uORFs ( Pajerowska-Mukhtar et al., 2012 31. Pajerowska-Mukhtar, K.M. ∙ Wang, W. ∙ Tada, Y. ... The HSF-like transcription factor TBF1 is a major molecular switch for plant growth-to-defense transition Curr. Biol. 2012; 22 :103-112 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ; Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Re-analysis of the sequence led to the discovery of two additional R-motifs, R2 and R3, located between and downstream of uORF1 and uORF2, respectively ( Figure S2 A). To determine whether mutating these R-motifs affects TBF1 translation, we made the “dual luciferase” reporters with the constitutively expressed renilla luciferase, 35S:RLUC , as an internal control for the reporter containing either WT 35S:uORF/R TBF1 -FLUC or the R-motif mutants ( mRs ) 35S:uORFs/mRs TBF1 -FLUC ( Table S2 ). The reporters were either stably transformed into Arabidopsis plants or transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana ( Nb ). We found that mutating the R-motifs, especially R2 and R3, greatly diminished the elf18-induced reporter translation ( Figures 2 A and S2 B) but not the reporter mRNA abundance ( Figure S2 C), suggesting that R-motifs positively regulate defense-related mRNA translation during PTI. We then performed in vitro translation assays using the TBF1 reporter mRNAs without the 5′ cap and found that mutating any of the three R-motifs decreased the level of translation compared with WT ( Figure 2 B), indicating that R-motifs in the TBF1 5′ leader sequence could facilitate translation independently of the cap, perhaps as a cap surrogate in recruiting ribosome. To test whether addition of the cap structure to the TBF1 reporter would affect R-motifs’ activity, we used the uORF1 and uORF2 mutant, uorf , to remove the effect of cap-dependent regulation of uORFs on the reporter. We found that although addition of the cap enhanced translation in the in vitro system, the fold increases in the translational activities caused by capping the uorf and uorf/mR123 reporter mRNAs were similar, indicating that the R-motif contributes positively to translation, regardless of the presence of the cap ( Figure S2 D), supporting our hypothesis that R-motif-mediated translation is cap-independent.
To confirm that R-motif functions as an IRES in planta , we took two different approaches. First, we used a translation inhibitory element (TIE) found in a mammalian gene to block cap-dependent translation ( Xue et al., 2015 48. Xue, S. ∙ Tian, S. ∙ Fujii, K. ... RNA regulons in Hox 5′ UTRs confer ribosome specificity to gene regulation Nature. 2015; 517 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ) by adding it to the 5′ end of the TBF1 leader sequence ( uorf ) in the luciferase reporters and transiently expressed them in Nb plants. We found that compared with the drastic reduction in the reporter activity by mutating R-motifs, the addition of TIE to uorf and uorf/mR123 caused similar fold reductions in reporter activities ( Figure 2 C), indicating that R-motif-mediated translation is cap-independent. Second, we constructed bicistronic reporters in which the uorf or uorf/mR123 leader sequence of TBF1 was inserted between the first cistron RLUC and the second cistron FLUC . From the same mRNA, the 5′ RLUC is translated through cap-dependent initiation and serves as an internal control, although the 3′ FLUC is expected to be translated only if the TBF1 5′ leader sequence contains an IRES. We found that when transiently expressed in Nb plants, translational activities observed in the uorf reporter were diminished in the uorf/mR123 reporter ( Figure 2 D), supporting our hypothesis that R-motif is a cellular IRES.
We next sought to explore the underlying mechanisms of R-motif-mediated protein translation during PTI. Our previous study showed that PABPs (PAB2, PAB4, and PAB8) can bind to synthetic GA-rich RNA probes (GA × 60, G[A]3 × 30, and G[A]6 × 20) in vitro ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), making them promising candidates in mediating R-motif-dependent translation. To test this hypothesis, we used biotin-conjugated RNA probes containing TBF1 R-motifs and incubated them with PAB8-FLAG purified from protoplasts with or without elf18 treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that all three probes interacted with the PAB8-FLAG protein, and the interactions were transiently increased following elf18 treatment compared with the poly(A) control whose interaction with PAB8-FLAG remained unchanged ( Figure 2 E), indicating that PABP binding to R-motifs is dynamically regulated during PTI. Next, we coexpressed PAB8-HA with either the WT or the R-motif mutant ( mR123 ) dual luciferase reporters in Nb plants to test the effects of PABPs on the reporter translation. The results showed that at comparable reporter mRNA and PAB8-HA protein levels ( Figures S2 E and S2F), PAB8-HA significantly promoted the WT, but not the mR123 , reporter translation ( Figure 2 F), consistent with our hypothesis that PABPs can regulate protein translation through binding to the R-motif. Tethering experiment ( Bertrand et al., 1998 1. Bertrand, E. ∙ Chartrand, P. ∙ Schaefer, M. ... Localization of ASH1 mRNA particles in living yeast Mol. Cell. 1998; 2 :437-445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1257) PubMed Google Scholar ) demonstrates that recruitment of PABPs to the 5′ leader sequence is sufficient to initiate translation in the absence of R-motif ( Figure S2 G). To further confirm the role of PABPs in R-motif-mediated translation genetically, we transiently expressed the WT reporter into protoplasts made from WT or the pab2.5 ( pab2 pab8 pab4 +/− ) mutant and found that the elf18-induced translation was similarly compromised in pab2.5 as the mR123 reporter ( Figure 2 G), supporting the role of PABPs in regulating protein translation through dynamic association with R-motif.
Previous work in yeast showed that PABPs have a redundant function with the eIF4E in mediating protein translation ( Tarun and Sachs, 1995 40. Tarun, S.Z. ∙ Jr. ∙ Sachs, A.B. A common function for mRNA 5′ and 3′ ends in translation initiation in yeast Genes Dev. 1995; 9 :2997-3007 Crossref Scopus (331) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tarun et al., 1997 41. Tarun, S.Z. ∙ Jr. ∙ Wells, S.E. ... Translation initiation factor eIF4G mediates in vitro poly(A) tail-dependent translation Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94 :9046-9051 Crossref Scopus (271) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that PABPs may serve as eIF4E alternates in recruiting other eIFs to the R-motif. To test this hypothesis, we performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify PABP-interacting proteins and detected 10 eIFs and 13 other candidates that may function in the translation initiation process ( Table S3 ). STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) analysis showed that eIF4G and RACK1A are possible “hub proteins” mediating the interaction of PABPs with the translation initiation complex ( Figure 3 A). We first confirmed the PABP-eIF4G interaction using both the split-luciferase complementation assays in Nb plants ( Figures S3 A–S3C) as well as co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in Arabidopsis protoplasts ( Figures S3 D and S3E). The plant-specific isomer of the canonical eIF4G, eIFiso4G1, also interacted with PABPs ( Figures S3 A–S3E). We then performed a time course experiment to trace the interaction dynamics of PABPs with eIF4G and eIFiso4G1 after treating Nb plants with elf18. Surprisingly, we found that following the elf18 treatment, PABPs’ interactions with these proteins were initially reduced before recovering, with the PABPs/eIF4G pair showing a faster and more dramatic reduction and recovery than the PABPs/eIFiso4G1 pair ( Figures 3 B, S3 F, and S3G), indicating that upon PTI induction, PABP may switch from canonical cap-dependent translation to R-motif-mediated cap-independent defense protein translation by transiently switching association from eIF4G to eIFiso4G.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the double-mutant eif4g eif4e1 , known as eif4f ( Patrick and Browning, 2012 32. Patrick, R.M. ∙ Browning, K.S. The eIF4F and eIFiso4F complexes of plants: an evolutionary perspective Comp. Funct. Genomics. 2012; 2012 :287814 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ), and that of the two redundant eIFiso4G genes, eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 , ( Lellis et al., 2010 22. Lellis, A.D. ∙ Allen, M.L. ∙ Aertker, A.W. ... Deletion of the eIFiso4G subunit of the Arabidopsis eIFiso4F translation initiation complex impairs health and viability Plant Mol. Biol. 2010; 74 :249-263 Crossref Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ) for translation of R-motif-containing dual luciferase reporters made from the R-motif-containing 5′ leader sequences of TBF1 , ZIK3 , and ATG8E . We found that without PTI signaling, translation of these reporters was increased in the eif4g eif4e1 mutant but decreased in the eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant compared with WT ( Figures S3 H and S3I), suggesting that eIF4G and eIFiso4G may be negative and positive regulators of R-motif-mediated translation, respectively. Noticeably, for the control mRNA without an R-motif, translation was decreased in the eif4g eif4e1 mutant ( Figure S3 H), consistent with eIF4G and eIF4E being canonical translation initiation factors, but not in the eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant ( Figure S3 I), supporting eIFiso4G’s specific activity in R-motif-dependent translation. Also, consistent with their proposed opposing roles in PTI-specific translation, the eif4g eif4e1 mutant displayed either WT or higher-than-WT level of elf18-induced reporter activities ( Figure 3 C), whereas the eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant failed to respond to the induction ( Figure 3 D).
To determine whether translational perturbations observed in the mutants of PABP, eIF4G, and eIFiso4G impact basal and elf18-triggered immunity, we inoculated the mutants with Pseudomonas syringae pathovar maculicola ( Psm ) ES4326. We found the pab2.5 mutant to have significantly enhanced basal resistance to Psm ES4326 but compromised elf18-induced resistance to the pathogen ( Figure 4 A), consistent with our previous report using lower order mutants ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the eif4g and eif4g eif4e1 mutants, higher-than-WT levels of basal resistance ( Figure 4 B), but normal elf18-triggered protection, were observed. In contrast, the eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant was only compromised in elf18-induced resistance to Psm ES4326, with normal basal resistance ( Figure 4 C). Interestingly, mutants of the cap-binding proteins eIF4E and eIFiso4E had no effect on elf18-induced resistance against Psm ES4326 ( Figures 4 B and 4C), supporting our hypothesis that these cap-binding proteins are dispensable for PTI.
The relationship between PABP and eIF4G or eIFiso4G in regulation of basal and elf18-triggered immunity was then studied using quadruple mutants pab2 pab8 eif4g eif4e1 and pab2 pab4 eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 . The pab2 pab4 eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant was used instead of pab2 pab8 eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 because the latter was not viable in our growth conditions. We found the pab2 pab8 eif4g eif4e1 mutant to have similarly enhanced basal defense to Psm ES4326 as the eif4g eif4e1 double mutant ( Figure 4 D), consistent with our hypothesis that the canonical eIF4G/4E1 work downstream of PABP to inhibit basal resistance. In contrast, mutating eIFiso4G in the pab2 pab4 eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 quadruple mutant not only reduced basal resistance to the WT level but also compromised elf18-induced defense ( Figure 4 E), demonstrating that eIFiso4G, in association with PABP, plays a positive role in conferring basal resistance as well as in inducing PTI.
To elucidate the signal pathway that leads to the switch from canonical cap-dependent translation to PABP/R-motif-mediated cap-independent translation upon pathogen perception, we focused on the second “hub protein,” RACK1A, identified in our LC-MS/MS analysis ( Figure 3 A; Table S3 ). RACK1 is a noteworthy PABP interactor because its knockdown mutant has a defense phenotype similar to that of pab2.5 ( Figure 4 F), and it physically and genetically interacts with PABPs, eIF4G, and eIFiso4G ( Figure S4 ). More importantly, RACK1 is not only a 40S ribosome-associated protein ( Ceci et al., 2003 7. Ceci, M. ∙ Gaviraghi, C. ∙ Gorrini, C. ... Release of eIF6 (p27BBP) from the 60S subunit allows 80S ribosome assembly Nature. 2003; 426 :579-584 Crossref Scopus (344) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sengupta et al., 2004 37. SenGupta, J. ∙ Nilsson, J. ∙ Gursky, R. ... Identification of the versatile scaffold protein RACK1 on the eukaryotic ribosome by cryo-EM Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11 :957-962 Crossref Scopus (207) PubMed Google Scholar ) but also known as a scaffold that bridges MPK3/6 with the heterotrimeric G-protein complex during PTI ( Cheng et al., 2015 9. Cheng, Z. ∙ Li, J.-F. ∙ Niu, Y. ... Pathogen-secreted proteases activate a novel plant immune pathway Nature. 2015; 521 :213-216 Crossref Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since MPK3/6 are essential regulators of PTI-associated transcription, we tested the possibility that MPK3/6 have an additional function in directing translational reprogramming early in this immune response by transforming the R-motif-containing dual luciferase reporters into the inducible mpk3 mpk6 double-mutant ( mpk6SR ) protoplasts. We found that knocking down the MPK3/6 function indeed compromised elf18-induced translation of the TBF1 , ZIK3 , and ATG8E reporters ( Figures S5 A–S5C).
To test whether MPK3/6 regulate R-motif-containing mRNA translation by phosphorylating R-motif-associated translation regulators, we first performed the phos-tag gel analysis on the PAB8 protein expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts after elf18 treatment and found an elf18-induced transient mobility shift of the protein ( Figure 5 A) which is sensitive to phosphatase treatment ( Figure S5 D). We next treated the transgenic lines expressing PAB2, PAB4, and PAB8 with elf18 to further confirm the results in planta . Surprisingly, we found that this elf18-triggered mobility shift was only observed in PAB8 ( Figure S5 E), not in PAB2 or PAB4 ( Figure S5 F). It is worth noting that the timing of PAB8 phosphorylation ( Figure 5 A) coincided well with its enhanced association with R-motif ( Figure 2 E), suggesting that PAB8 binding to R-motif is modulated by its phosphorylation status.
To identify the phosphorylation site(s) in PAB8, we conducted LC-MS/MS analysis and detected only one elf18-induced phosphorylation residue, S566 ( Figure S5 G), and this residue is absent in PAB2 and PAB4, indicating that if phosphorylation does occur in these proteins, it is likely to be at different residues and not detectable by the phos-tag gel ( Figure S5 F). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to substitute S566 with alanine and the PAB8 S566A mutation completely abolished the elf18-induced mobility shift of the PAB8 protein ( Figure 5 B). Interestingly, this serine is in a typical MPK3/6 phosphorylation motif X-(Ser/Thr)-Pro ( Clark-Lewis et al., 1991 11. Clark-Lewis, I. ∙ Sanghera, J.S. ∙ Pelech, S.L.

Chem. 1991; 266 :15180-15184 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sörensson et al., 2012 38. Sörensson, C. ∙ Lenman, M. ∙ Veide-Vilg, J. ... Determination of primary sequence specificity of Arabidopsis MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6 leads to identification of new substrates Biochem. J. 2012; 446 :271-278 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ), consistent with our hypothesis that MPK3/6 are the kinases regulating PABP activities during PTI.
To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed the MPK3/6-PAB8 interaction ( Figure S5 H) and then examined the elf18-induced PAB8 band shift in the mpk6SR mutant and the kinase scaffold RACK1 knockdown mutant rack1-es2 and found the band shift diminished in each mutant ( Figure 5 C). To further confirm that MPK3/6 work with PABP in the same pathway, we crossed pab2 pab8 with mpk6SR and found the resulting pab2 pab8 mpk6SR line similarly compromised in response to elf18-associated plant growth inhibition as the parents ( Figure 5 D). Moreover, in an in vitro phosphorylation assay, MPK6 was shown to phosphorylate PAB8, but not the PAB8 S566A variant, using a phospho-specific antibody against pSer566 ( Figure 5 E). These data clearly demonstrate that MPK3/6 phosphorylate PAB8 at Ser566 during elf18-triggered PTI.
To determine whether this modification is responsible for the enhanced PAB8 binding to R-motifs ( Figure 2 E), we performed R-motif binding assay using proteins produced in protoplasts. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the phosphodead PAB8 S566A had a weakened binding to R-motif 3, whereas the phosphomimetic PAB8 S566D had a stronger binding ( Figure 5 F), confirming that the dynamic change in PABP association with R-motif is indeed regulated through its phosphorylation. Using RNA-immunoprecipitation-qPCR, we further showed that in planta , PAB8 S566D had a significantly higher level of association with R-motifs in the TBF1 5′ leader sequence than PAB8 S566A ( Figure S5 I).
To examine whether PAB8 S566 phosphorylation affects its function in translation, we coexpressed PAB8, PAB8 S566A , and PAB8 S566D with the TBF1 dual luciferase reporter 35S:uORF/R TBF1 -FLUC/35S:RLUC in Nb plants. The results showed that PAB8 S566A had a much lower reporter translation than the WT PAB8 and PAB8 S566D ( Figure 5 G). The role of PAB8 S566 phosphorylation in PTI response was then examined by introducing PAB8 , PAB8 S566A , or PAB8 S566D transgenes under the control of its native promoter (NP) into the pab2 pab8 mutant. Although introduction of the NP:PAB8-HA or NP:PAB8 S566D - HA transgene restored plants sensitivity to elf18-induced growth retardation, the NP:PAB8 S566A -HA transgene failed to do so ( Figure 5 H). The fact that the NP:PAB8 S 566D -HA/pab2 pab8 plants are responsive to elf18 induction indicates that phosphorylation of PAB8 is necessary but not sufficient for PTI induction.
Besides PABPs, we also considered the associated eIF4G and eIFiso4G as potential substrates of MPK3/6. We first detected an elf18-specific and phosphatase-sensitive band shift of eIF4G which occurred as early as 5 min post treatment ( Figures 6 A and S6 A). Through LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified fifteen phosphorylation sites in eIF4G with eight of them having a typical MPK3/6 phosphorylation motif ( Figure S6 B, highlight in red) ( Clark-Lewis et al., 1991 11. Clark-Lewis, I. ∙ Sanghera, J.S. ∙ Pelech, S.L. Definition of a consensus sequence for peptide substrate recognition by p44mpk, the meiosis-activated myelin basic protein kinase J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266 :15180-15184 Abstract Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sörensson et al., 2012 38. Sörensson, C. ∙ Lenman, M. ∙ Veide-Vilg, J. ... Determination of primary sequence specificity of Arabidopsis MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6 leads to identification of new substrates Biochem. J. 2012; 446 :271-278 Crossref Scopus (50) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because eIF4G is nearly 190 kDa in MW and poorly resolved on a phos-tag gel ( Figures 6 A and S6 A), we truncated eIF4G into the N-terminal (4G-N) and the C-terminal (4G-C) halves, respectively, and performed simultaneous alanine substitutions. The resulting mutants significantly reduced the elf18-induced band shift, with mutants of those eight MPK3/6 phosphorylation residues Ser530, Ser1066, Thr1069, Ser1366, Ser1367, Ser1376, Ser1508, and Ser1527 showing the most significant effects (“3A” in Figure S6 C and “5A” in Figure S6 D), indicating that they are major phosphorylation sites in eIF4G responsive to elf18 treatment through the activity of MPK3/6.
The dependency on MPK3/6 was confirmed by demonstrating that MPK3/6 interact with eIF4G ( Figures S6 E and S6F) and by in planta testing using the mpk6SR mutant in which the elf18-induced band shift was significantly diminished in the mutant ( Figure S6 G). We next demonstrated that MPK6 could phosphorylate eIF4G directly using an in vitro kinase assay followed by immunoblotting using antibodies against phospho-eIF4G S1066,T1069 (pSer1066/Thr1069) ( Figure 6 B). To examine the impact of MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation on eIF4G translational activity, we transiently expressed mutants of all eight MPK3/6 target sites eIF4G 8A or eIF4G 8D with the TBF1 dual luciferase reporter in Nb plants. We found that the phosphodead eIF4G 8A mutant supported higher-than-WT reporter translation, whereas the phosphomimetic eIF4G 8D mutant had little effect ( Figure 6 C), indicating that phosphorylation of eIF4G negatively impacts translation of the reporter either through reduced activity or dissociation from PABPs. Therefore, MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation of eIF4G is another mechanism, beside decapping of mRNA, for plants to rapidly inhibit canonical translation in response to pathogen challenge.
We next examined the phosphorylation of eIFiso4G1 and found that similar to PAB8 and eIF4G, there were phosphorylation-associated band shifts in the protein following elf18 perception, which occurred within 5 min of treatment ( Figures 6 D and S6 H). Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified two phosphorylation sites, S487 and S542, in eIFiso4G1, both within the typical MPK3/6 phosphorylation motif ( Figure S6 I). Interestingly, S542 phosphorylation by Snf1-related protein kinase 1 was also observed during hypoxia ( Cho et al., 2019 10. Cho, H.Y. ∙ Lu, M.J. ∙ Shih, M.C. The SnRK1-eIFiso4G1 signaling relay regulates the translation of specific mRNAs in Arabidopsis under submergence New Phytol. 2019; 222 :366-381 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). Simultaneously substituting these two residues with alanine significantly decreased elf18-induced band shift ( Figure S6 J). The role of MPK3/6 in phosphorylating eIFiso4G1 was then demonstrated in planta based on the MPK3/6-eIFiso4G interaction data ( Figure S6 K) as well as the phos-tag gel analysis using the mpk6SR and rack1-es2 mutants ( Figure S6 L). We then performed in vitro phosphorylation reaction on eIFiso4G1 followed by immunoblotting analysis using antibodies against phospho-Ser487 (pSer487) and phospho-Ser542 (pSer542) in the protein and found MPK6 could phosphorylate eIFiso4G1 directly ( Figure 6 E).
The effect of phosphorylation on eIFiso4G translational activity was examined by coexpressing different eIFiso4G1 variants with the TBF1 dual luciferase reporter in Nb plants. Opposite to the canonical eIF4G ( Figure 6 C), the phosphodead eIFiso4G1 2A mutant had significantly less, whereas the phosphomimetic eIFiso4G1 2D mutant had a similar reporter translation compared with the WT eIFiso4G1 ( Figure 6 F), indicating that MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation enhances translational activity of eIFiso4G. Subsequent genetic complementation experiment using NP:eIFiso4G1 , NP:eIFiso4G1 2A , and NP:eIFiso4G1 2D showed that introducing either the eIFiso4G1 or eIFisoI4G1 2D transgene restored PTI-induced growth inhibition to the eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant ( Figure S6 M). In contrast, independent transformants with the NP:eIFiso4G 2A transgene completely failed to restore the elf18-associated growth inhibition. Finally, we tested PTI-associated resistance on the transgenic lines and observed that similar to elf18-induced growth inhibition results ( Figure S6 M), NP:eIFiso4G1 and NP:eIFiso4G1 2D , but not NP:eIFiso4G1 2A , rescued the PTI-deficient phenotype of the eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant ( Figure 6 G). Together, these data demonstrate that through MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation of PABP, eIF4G, and eIFiso4G, plants can quickly reprogram their translatome upon pathogen perception.

Section: Discussion

This study demonstrates that in response to immune induction, R-motif serves as a cellular IRES to mediate cap-independent stress protein translation ( Figure 6 H). Normally, translation from R-motif is repressed either through cap-mediated competition for PABPs via the poly(A) tail or by an unknown inhibitor associated with PABPs. Upon immune induction, there is an increase in mRNA decapping activity, relieving cap-competition with PABP/R-motif-mediated translation. However, whether decapping is required for this alternative translation mechanism needs further investigation. Another question that remains to be answered is: does R-motif-mediated translation occur in the P-bodies where decapping is known to occur or are decapped mRNAs released into the cytosol for translation? The previous report of transient disappearance and reappearance of P-bodies after PTI induction ( Yu et al., 2019 49. Yu, X. ∙ Li, B. ∙ Jang, G.J. ... Orchestration of processing body dynamics and mRNA decay in Arabidopsis immunity Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :2194-2205.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggests that the latter is a plausible hypothesis. Alternatively, decapping-mediated mRNA decay and activation of PABP/R-motif-mediated translation of defense mRNAs may be two separate events in PTI induction.
In plants, both eIF4G and eIFiso4G can initiate protein translation under normal growth conditions. As a plant-specific isomer, eIFiso4G has been reported to also translate mRNAs under certain stress conditions, such as hypoxia and viral infection, through an unknown mechanism ( Cho et al., 2019 10. Cho, H.Y. ∙ Lu, M.J. ∙ Shih, M.C. The SnRK1-eIFiso4G1 signaling relay regulates the translation of specific mRNAs in Arabidopsis under submergence New Phytol. 2019; 222 :366-381 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nicaise et al., 2007 29. Nicaise, V. ∙ Gallois, J.L. ∙ Chafiai, F. ... Coordinated and selective recruitment of eIF4E and eIF4G factors for Potyvirus infection in Arabidopsis thaliana FEBS Lett. 2007; 581 :1041-1046 Crossref Scopus (102) PubMed Google Scholar ). It is interesting to note that the eif4f plants (i.e., the eif4g eif4e1 double mutant) are morphologically similar to WT ( Figure 4 D), probably due to compensatory expression of eIFiso4G ( Bi et al., 2019 2. Bi, C. ∙ Ma, Y. ∙ Jiang, S.C. ... Arabidopsis translation initiation factors eIFiso4G1/2 link repression of mRNA cap-binding complex eIFiso4F assembly with RNA-binding protein SOAR1-mediated ABA signaling New Phytol. 2019; 223 :1388-1406 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upregulation of eIFiso4G may also explain the high basal resistance observed in the eif4f mutant ( Figures 4 B and 4D). In contrast to eif4f , the e ifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant plants have a reduced stature ( Figure 4 E; Bi et al., 2019 2. Bi, C. ∙ Ma, Y. ∙ Jiang, S.C. ... Arabidopsis translation initiation factors eIFiso4G1/2 link repression of mRNA cap-binding complex eIFiso4F assembly with RNA-binding protein SOAR1-mediated ABA signaling New Phytol. 2019; 223 :1388-1406 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ), implying that a deficiency in eIFiso4G cannot be reciprocally compensated by eIF4G. The differential dissociation and reassociation of eIF4G and eIFiso4G from PABPs following elf18 induction ( Figures 3 B, S3 F, and S3G) show that during PTI, distinct eIFs are dynamically recruited by PABPs to the R-motif and/or the 5′ cap, depending on the mRNA sequence and structure, to translate defense mRNAs.
This study also found that the immune-induced translational reprogramming is mediated by the essential PTI regulators MPK3/6, previously known mainly for their role in regulating transcription ( Bigeard et al., 2015 4. Bigeard, J. ∙ Colcombet, J. ∙ Hirt, H. Signaling mechanisms in pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) Mol. Plant. 2015; 8 :521-539 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (664) PubMed Google Scholar ; Meng and Zhang, 2013 28. Meng, X. ∙ Zhang, S. MAPK cascades in plant disease resistance signaling Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2013; 51 :245-266 Crossref Scopus (922) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rasmussen et al., 2012 34. Rasmussen, M.W. ∙ Roux, M. ∙ Petersen, M. ... MAP kinase cascades in Arabidopsis innate immunity Front. Plant Sci. 2012; 3 :169 Crossref Scopus (158) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon immune induction, MPK3/6 turn off the canonical cap-dependent translation through induction of mRNA decapping ( Figures 1 and S1 ; Xu and Chua, 2012 45. Xu, J. ∙ Chua, N.H. Dehydration stress activates Arabidopsis MPK6 to signal DCP1 phosphorylation EMBO J. 2012; 31 :1975-1984 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yu et al., 2019 49. Yu, X. ∙ Li, B. ∙ Jang, G.J. ... Orchestration of processing body dynamics and mRNA decay in Arabidopsis immunity Cell Rep. 2019; 28 :2194-2205.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) and inhibition of eIF4G activity, while turning on the R-motif-dependent translation through enhancement of the “PABP/R-motif” translation initiation module ( Figures 5 and 6 ). A previous study showed that eIF4G’s translational activity could also be inhibited by phosphorylation upon photosynthetic input ( Boex-Fontvieille et al., 2013 5. Boex-Fontvieille, E. ∙ Daventure, M. ∙ Jossier, M. ... Photosynthetic control of Arabidopsis leaf cytoplasmic translation initiation by protein phosphorylation PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e70692 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ), indicating that this key translation initiation factor is regulated by different environmental stresses. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found 15 phosphorylation events in eIF4G ( Figure S6 B), and 8 of them are modified by MPK3/6. Whether different environmental stresses inhibit eIF4G through the same phosphorylation sites or different ones need to be further studied.
The rapidity of the phosphorylation events suggests that the MPK3/6-controlled translational reprogramming is an initial event in PTI induction. Consistent with this hypothesis, knocking down MPK3/6 ( mpk6SR ) in the pab2 pab8 mutant did not further compromise the responsiveness of the higher order mutant to elf18 ( Figure 5 D). It is likely that defense transcription factors, such as TBF1, must be translated from preexisting mRNAs to trigger transcriptional reprogramming. It is also worth noting that R-motifs have been found in the 5′ leader sequences of MPK6 , PAB2 , PAB4 , PAB8 , eIFiso4G1 , and eIFiso4G2 , but not that of eIF4G ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that these regulators of PTI-associated translation can also be produced through R-motif-mediated translation, forming an amplification loop.
It will be interesting to determine whether this cap-independent PABP/R-motif translational module functions in stress responses of other higher eukaryotes. In yeast, cap-independent translation of several mRNAs involved in invasive growth has been found to require Pab1p binding to a poly(A) stretch in their 5′ UTRs ( Gilbert et al., 2007 15. Gilbert, W.V. ∙ Zhou, K. ∙ Butler, T.K. ... Cap-independent translation is required for starvation-induced differentiation in yeast Science. 2007; 317 :1224-1227 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our previous study showed that R-motif is prevalent in the 5′ leader sequences of stress mRNAs from Drosophila , mouse to human, including the human p53 mRNA ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). Translation of these mRNAs may be similarly switched on in response to stress by phosphorylation of PABP and translation initiation factors.
The limitations of the study are intrinsic to the translation process, which is impacted by a myriad of factors at different levels of regulation. Since plants do not have specialized immune cells, perturbation of plant defense-related translational activity is likely to also influence plant growth and development. To overcome these challenges, we had to use proxies to deduce the PTI-specific translational effects in a few experiments. For example, PTI-induced growth inhibition of plate-grown seedlings, a phenotype that is certain to result in part from immune-induced translatome reprogramming, is used to minimize environmental variations and obtain reproducible quantitative data in characterizing the translation mutants. As shown in Figure S6 M, the PTI-induced growth inhibition assay results are consistent with the observed PTI-associated resistance ( Figure 6 G). Another challenge for the study is the involvement of essential genes, such as DCP2 , PABPs , RACK1 , and MPK3/6 . For example, PABPs are required for both growth- and defense-related translation, and there are eight PABPs in the Arabidopsis genome. Higher order pab mutants are required to observe a defense phenotype, which is also influenced by the plant growth conditions. Among the three PABPs tested, only PAB8 had a detectable elf18-induced mobility shift on a phos-tag gel, leaving the phosphorylation status of other PABPs unknown. Finally, this study focuses on elucidating the role of R-motif in PTI-mediated translation. However, besides the R-motif, defense mRNAs contain other regulatory elements in their 5′ leader sequences, such as the two uORFs found downstream of R-motif 1 and R-motif 2, respectively, in the TBF1 mRNA. Nevertheless, the elucidation of the role of R-motif as a cellular IRES and the establishment of the signaling pathway linking pathogen perception to R-motif-mediated translation activation in this study provide a necessary framework for future research.

T-DNA insertion mutants dcp2-1 ( SALK_000519 ) and vcs-7 ( N66965 ) were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). DCP2OE-HA and amiR-DCP2 Arabidopsis transgenic lines were generated in the WT background; the 35S:DCP2-HA and 35S:DCP2 E158Q -HA lines in the dcp2-1 mutant background; the NP:PAB8-HA , NP:PAB8 S566A -HA and NP:PAB8 S566D -HA lines in pab2 pab8 ; NP:PAB2-HA and NP:PAB4-HA lines in pab2 pab4 ; the NP:I4G1-HA , NP:I4G1 2A -HA and NP:I4G1 2D -HA lines in eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 ; and the 35S:uORF/R TBF1 -FLUC ( WT ), 35S:uORF/mR123 TBF1 -FLUC ( mR123 ) and 35S:uORF/mR3 TBF1 -FLUC ( mR3 ) lines in the WT background. All transgenic lines used in this study are in the T3 generation. High-order mutants ( pab2.5 , eif4g eif4e1 , pab2 pab8 eif4g eif4e1 , pab2 pab4 eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 , pab2 pab8 rack1-es2 , eif4g eif4e1 rack1-es2 , eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 rack1-es2 , pab2 pab8 mpk6SR and eif4g eif4e1 mpk6SR ) were generated by genetic crossing.
To generate 35S:DCP2-HA , 35S:DCP2 E158Q -HA and 35S:DCP2OE-HA transgenic plants in the dcp2-1 mutant background, the DCP2 fragment were PCR-amplified from WT cDNA and cloned into the pCAMBIA1300-35S:HA-RBS plasmid. The estradiol -inducible DCP2 knockdown transgenic plants, amiR-DCP2 , were generated using 21mer artificial microRNA ( amiR ) designed following a previous report ( Schwab et al., 2006 36. Schwab, R. ∙ Ossowski, S. ∙ Riester, M. ... Highly specific gene silencing by artificial microRNAs in Arabidopsis Plant Cell. 2006; 18 :1121-1133 Crossref Scopus (1108) PubMed Google Scholar ) and used to replace the corresponding region of the Arabidopsis -derived miR319a by overlapping PCR, and the resulting recombinant miR319a containing the designed artificial microRNA targeting DCP2 (amiR-DCP2) was cloned into pBm43GW vector following a previous report ( Karimi et al., 2005 21. Karimi, M. ∙ De Meyer, B. ∙ Hilson, P. Modular cloning in plant cells Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10 :103-105 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (450) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate FLAG- or HA-tagged PAB2, PAB8, eIF4G, eIFiso4G1, RACK1A, and MPK6 constructs for transient expression in protoplasts, the corresponding coding sequences (CDSs) were PCR-amplified from WT cDNA and introduced into the PUC19-35S:FLAG/HA-RBS vector by either ligation or In-fusion cloning (Takara). Point mutations of PAB8, eIF4G and eIFiso4G1 were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). The TBF1 leader sequence was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA, the R-motif point mutant variants in the leader sequence ( mR1 , mR2 , mR3 and mR123 ) were synthesized by IDT ( Table S2 ), the TIE sequence (170 nt) was PCR-amplified from the RLUC-Hoxa3 5′ UTR FLUC construct ( Xue et al., 2015 48. Xue, S. ∙ Tian, S. ∙ Fujii, K. ... RNA regulons in Hox 5′ UTRs confer ribosome specificity to gene regulation Nature. 2015; 517 :33-38 Crossref Scopus (218) PubMed Google Scholar ) and fused with the TBF1 5′ leader sequence with either the uORF mutant ( uorf ) or the uORF and R-motif mutant ( uorf/mR123 ) by overlapping PCR. The resulting fragments were cloned into the pGX plasmid ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) by ligation. For the bicistronic assay, the RLUC and FLUC sequences were PCR-amplified and fused by overlapping PCR. The resulting fragments were cloned into the pGX plasmid ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) by ligation to generate a bicistronic construct. The TBF1 5′ leader sequence with either the uORF mutations ( uorf ) or the uORF and R-motif mutations ( uorf/mR123 ) was inserted into the bicistronic construct between RLUC and FLUC sequences by ligation cloning. For the MS2 tethering assay, MS2 and 6x MS2 binding sites ( M6 ) sequences were PCR-amplified from plasmids pMS2-YFP and pSL-MS2-6x ( Bertrand et al., 1998 1. Bertrand, E. ∙ Chartrand, P. ∙ Schaefer, M. ... Localization of ASH1 mRNA particles in living yeast Mol. Cell. 1998; 2 :437-445 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1257) PubMed Google Scholar ), respectively. The resulting MS2 fragment was ligated into pCAMBIA-35S-PAB8-HA and the M6 fragment was introduced into the uorf/mR123 dual reporter by In-fusion cloning. To generate a control for PAB8-HA-MS2 protein, eGFP was PCR-amplified and ligated into the pCAMBIA-35S-PAB8-HA-MS plasmid to replace the PAB8 fragment. For the split-luciferase assay, CDSs with the FLAG tag were PCR-amplified from the corresponding PUC19 constructs and introduced into pCAMBIA-Cluc or pCAMBIA-Nluc ( Chen et al., 2008 8. Chen, H. ∙ Zou, Y. ∙ Shang, Y. ... Firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay for protein-protein interactions in plants Plant Physiol. 2008; 146 :368-376 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ) by either ligation or In-fusion cloning.

For the dual luciferase assay, CDSs of PAB8, eIF4G, eIFiso4G1 and their phosphorylation variants were PCR-amplified from the corresponding PUC19 vectors and cloned into the pCAMBIA1300-35S:HA-RBS plasmid through ligation or In-fusion cloning. ZIK3 (pGX731) and ATG8E (pGX728) were previously reported ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate NP:PAB2-HA and NP:PAB4-HA transgenic plants in pab2 pab4 , a fragment containing about 1 kb native promoter ( NP ) of PAB2 or PAB4 with their corresponding CDS was PCR-amplified from WT genomic DNA and cloned into the pCAMBIA1300-HA-RBS vector by In-fusion cloning. For generating PAB8 and eIFiso4G1 transgenic plants containing mutated phosphosites, a fragment containing about 1.3 kb native promoter of PAB8 or eIFiso4g1 fused with their corresponding CDS was cloned into the pCAMBIA1300-HA-RBS vector. Point mutations of DCP2 , PAB8 and eIFiso4G1 were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) and introduced into WT, dcp2-1 , pab2 pab4 , pab2 pab8 or eifiso4g1 eifiso4g2 mutant plants correspondingly by Agrobacterium -mediated transformation ( Clough and Bent, 1998 12. Clough, S.J. ∙ Bent, A.F. Floral dip: a simplified method for Agrobacterium -mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana Plant J. 1998; 16 :735-743 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The GST fusion constructs were generated using CDSs of desired genes amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEX 6P-1 vector ( Wang et al., 2018 42. Wang, J. ∙ Grubb, L.E. ∙ Wang, J. ...

Agrobacterium strain GV3101 carrying indicated construct was cultured for 12 h at 28 °C, 220 rpm in 2 mL Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, gentamycin and rifampicin before secondary propagation in 15 mL LB broth supplied with same antibiotics and 200 μM acetosyringone. After overnight incubation, bacteria were spun down at 2,000 g for 5 min, washed once, and resuspended in the infiltration buffer [10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 200 μM acetosyringone] at OD 600nm = 0.6 before infiltration into fully expanded Nb leaves. The imaging was performed with the Zeiss 880 Airyscan inverted confocal laser scanning microscope using a 40x/1.2 water correction objective. YFP was excited through a 488 nm argon laser, and emission was recorded with a 516-544 nm band pass filter. mCherry was excited through a 561 nm DPSS laser, and emission was detected with a 592-629 nm band pass filter. A spectral GaAsP detector was used to collect emission from YFP when YFP and mCherry were imaged together.
8-day-old seedlings (20/sample) grown on solid ½ MS were transferred to 1 mL liquid ½ MS overnight before adding another 1 mL liquid ½ MS with mock or 20 μM elf18 for 1 h. Total mRNA (Control) was extracted from the mock- and elf18- treated seedlings using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For exonuclease-based decapping assay, 10 μg of each sample was exposed to 1 U exonuclease (Lucigen) at 42 °C for 30 min. The exonuclease-treated mRNA was purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to reverse transcription together with the control mRNA using the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo) following the manufacturer's manual before qPCR was performed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Kit (Roche). Decapping was measured by the ratio of exonuclease-treated mRNA normalized to the untreated control mRNA. For cap recognition antibody-based decapping assay, 200 μL protein A agarose (Millipore) was washed 3 times with 1 mL of ice-cold IPP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Half of the agarose was resuspended in 250 μL IPP buffer with 0.2 U/μL SUPERase⋅In RNase Inhibitor (Invitrogen) and treated overnight at 4 °C with rotations (non-coated beads). The other half of the agarose was resuspended in 250 μL IPP buffer with 8 μL anti-m7G-cap mouse monoclonal antibody (Synaptic Systems) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rotations. The antibody-conjugated protein A beads were further incubated with 50 U RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen) at 4 °C overnight with rotations (antibody-coated beads) and washed 5 times with 1 mL ice-cold IPP buffer before resuspension in 100 μL IPP buffer. 2 μg of RNA was added to the non-coated beads for 1 h at 4 °C to remove the background bindings. The RNA/beads slurry was then centrifuged at 700 g, 4 °C for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was added to the 100 μL antibody-coated beads and incubated at 4 °C overnight with rotations with 0.5 M random decamers (Invitrogen, Japan) as blocking reagent. The resulting beads (capped RNA) were washed 5 times with 1 mL ice-cold IPP buffer and centrifuged at 700 g, 4 °C for 2 min. The capped RNA was extracted from the final pellet using 1 mL TRIzol and subjected to RT-PCR with the total RNA without cap antibody purification as input. The primers used are listed in Table S4 .
Elf18-induced growth inhibition assay was performed as previously described ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Seeds were sterilized in a 20% Germicidal Bleach solution (CLOROX) for 10 min and washed 5 times with sterilized water before sowing on solid ½ Murashige & Skoog (MS). 5-day-old seedlings (6-10/sample) were transferred to liquid ½ MS overnight in the presence of 50 μM estradiol (for estradiol-inducible transgenes) or 2 μM NA-PP1 (for the inhibitor-sensitized MPK3 variant-rescued mpk3 mpk6 double mutant, mpk6SR ), then treated with mock or 100 nM elf18, and fresh weight was measured 3-4 days after the treatment.
Luciferase assay in Arabidopsis plants was performed through CCD imaging as previously described ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. In brief, 3-4-week-old independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines carrying the dual luciferase 35S:uORF/R TBF1 -FLUC/35S:RLUC (WT), 35S:uORF/mR123 TBF1 -FLUC/35S:RLUC ( mR123 ) or the 35S:uORF/mR3 TBF1 -FLUC/35S:RLUC ( mR3 ) reporter were sprayed with 2 mM luciferin overnight before infiltration with either 10 μM elf18 or water for 1 h. Luciferase activity was measured using a CCD camera with 20 min exposure time. Dual luciferase assay in Nb plants was performed as previously described ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Briefly, after 3 h incubation at room temperature in the infiltration buffer [10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 200 μM acetosyringone], Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 containing the indicated construct was infiltrated into fully expanded Nb leaves at OD 600nm = 0.1, except for the EFR-GFP strain (OD 600nm = 0.2). For elf18 induction, the dual luciferase reporter strain (OD 600nm = 0.1) and the elf18 receptor EFR-GFP strain (OD 600nm = 0.2) were coinjected into Nb leaves, after 20 h, one half of the leaf was infiltrated with water (mock) while the other half was infiltrated with 10 μM elf18. After 2 h, leaf discs were collected, ground in liquid nitrogen and lysed with the PLB buffer (Promega, E1910). For the bicistronic assay, Agrobacterium strains containing the bicistronic reporter (OD 600nm = 0.4) and EFR-GFP construct (OD 600nm = 0.2) were co-infiltrated into Nb leaves. After 20 h, water or 10 μM elf18 was infiltrated into either half of a Nb leaf and leaf discs were collected after 2 h, ground in liquid nitrogen and dual luciferase assay was performed (Promega, E1910). For testing the effect of PABPs, eIF4G and eIFiso4G on the TBF1 dual luciferase reporter translation in Nb plants, Agrobacterium containing the reporter was mixed with those carrying the indicated (Test) constructs or HA-mCherry (CK) at a ratio of 1:1. After 3 h of incubation, half of the Nb leaf was infiltrated with TBF1/CK, and the other half was infiltrated with TBF1/Test. After 2 days, leaf discs were collected, lysed with the PLB buffer and used for dual luciferase assay. To test if PAB8 promotes translation through the MS2 tethering system, Agrobacterium (OD 600nm = 0.2) containing the M6-uorf/mR123 reporter was mixed with those carrying PAB8-HA-MS2 , eGFP-HA-MS2 , PAB8-HA or HA-mCherry construct at a ratio of 1:1. After 3 h, half of the Nb leaf was infiltrated with either M6-uorf/mR123/eGFP-HA-MS2 or M6-uorf/mR123/HA-mCherry , and the other half was infiltrated with M6-uorf/mR123/PAB8-HA-MS2 or M6-uorf/mR123/PAB8-HA correspondingly. After 2 days, leaf discs were collected, lysed with the PLB buffer and dual luciferase assay was performed. For translation assay in protoplasts, 20-40 μg of the indicated the dual luciferase reporter was delivered into 300 μL protoplasts by PEG-mediated transfection ( Niu and Sheen, 2012 30. Niu, Y. ∙ Sheen, J. Transient expression assays for quantifying signaling output Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 876 :195-206 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) and incubated overnight in the WI buffer (0.5 M mannitol, 4 mM MES, 20 mM KCl, pH 5.7) for assays without induction or W5 buffer (154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MES, pH 5.7) for assays with elf18 induction. For non-induction assay, samples were collected at 2,000 g for 30 sec after overnight incubation. For elf18 induction assay, protoplasts were treated with 1 μM elf18 for 45 min before collection at 2,000 g for 30 sec. The collected protoplasts were lysed with the PLB buffer and 10 μL of the supernatant was taken for luciferase signal capture in a Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer) using previously reported settings ( Xu et al., 2017 44. Xu, G. ∙ Greene, G.H. ∙ Yoo, H. ... Global translational reprogramming is a fundamental layer of immune regulation in plants Nature. 2017; 545 :487-490 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The template DNA used for in vitro transcription was amplified by overlapping PCR using the primers listed in Table S4 , and 2 μg of purified template DNA was subjected to in vitro transcription for 4 h using the RiboMAX™ Large Scale RNA Production Systems (Promega) following the manufacturer's instruction. The transcribed mRNA was capped using the Vaccinia Capping System (New England Biolabs). mRNA was purified using RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen) and translated in the wheat-germ system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, 1 μg of mRNA was incubated at 67 °C for 10 min and immediately cooled down on ice for 5 min before being added into a 20 μL reaction system, including 10 μL wheat-germ extract, 0.08 mM amino acid mixture, 60 mM potassium acetate and 0.8 U/μL RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen). The translation reaction was incubated at 25 °C for 60-90 min followed by addition of 100 μL 1 mM luciferin (BioVision) for luciferase measurement using the Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer).
Arabidopsis protoplasts were used for the purification of the FLAG-tagged PAB8 and phospho-sites variants as previously described ( Niu and Sheen, 2012 30. Niu, Y. ∙ Sheen, J. Transient expression assays for quantifying signaling output Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 876 :195-206 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. In brief, 3 mL protoplasts (from 5-10 fully-expanded leaves digested in 3 mL enzyme solution) were transfected with 200 μg indicated plasmids, incubated overnight and treated with or without 1 μM elf18 for indicated time. Samples were collected at 2,000 g for 30 sec and lysed with 1 mL of the extraction buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3% Triton-X 100, 1 mM DTT, 1× proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. After centrifuging at 16,000 g for 15 min, the supernatant was incubated with 50 μL agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C with rotations. The precipitates were washed 6 times with the washing buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X 100] before elution with 60 μL of 20 μg/mL 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h. The purified protein concentration was determined using Qubit™ Protein Assay Kit (Invitrogen). 5′ biotin-conjugated RNA probes were synthesized by IDT and listed in Table S2 . For the PABP/R-motif binding assay, 10 μL Dynabeads™ M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen) was pre-treated in 1 mL of the washing buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X 100] supplied with 2% BSA at 4 °C for 2 h with rotations, then 0.2-0.4 nmol biotin-conjugated RNA probes were added to the bead slurry and incubated for another 2 h in the presence of 200 U/mL RNase inhibitors (Invitrogen). The RNA probe-coated beads were washed 3 times with 1 mL ice-cold extraction buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3% Triton-X 100, 1 mM DTT, 1× proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)], followed by resuspension in 600 μL extraction buffer, addition of 200 U/mL RNase inhibitor and 9 μg plant-purified FLAG-tagged protein and incubation overnight at 4 °C with rotations. The resulting beads were washed 5 times using 1 mL ice-cold washing buffer and resuspended in 20 μL 1× protein loading buffer before 10 min 95 °C treatment for subsequent immunoblotting.
The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed as previously reported ( Liu et al., 2009 25. Liu, J. ∙ Elmore, J.M. ∙ Fuglsang, A.T. ... RIN4 functions with plasma membrane H+-ATPases to regulate stomatal apertures during pathogen attack PLoS Biol. 2009; 7 :e1000139 Crossref Scopus (223) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. Briefly, to identify PABP-associated proteins, 96 mL protoplasts transfected with 4.8 mg of pUC19-35S:PAB2-FLAG or pUC19-35S:FLAG-RBS (negative control) overnight were lysed with 15 mL buffer I [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/mL Dextran (Sigma), 1× proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore) followed by addition of 60 μL anti-FLAG agarose beads (Sigma) and incubation at 4 °C for 4 h with rotations. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed 2 times with buffer II (50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), and 2 times with buffer III (50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100). The immunoprecipitates were then eluted with 75 μL of 20 μg/mL 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) for 1 h and submitted to the Duke Proteomics Core Facility for trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis as previously described ( Li et al., 2014 23.

To identify the elf18-induced phosphosites in PAB8, eIF4G and eIFiso4G1, protoplasts expressing FLAG-tagged PAB8, eIF4G or eIFiso4G1 were treated with 1 μM elf18 for 10 min before protein extraction. The eluted proteins were separated in 4-12% (FLAG-tagged PAB8 and eIFiso4G1) and 3-8% (eIF4G-FLAG) NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), digested with trypsin, and subject to mass spectrometric analysis after phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2.
Proteins in Table S3 were submitted to the STRING tool ( Szklarczyk et al., 2021 39. Szklarczyk, D. ∙ Gable, A.L. ∙ Nastou, K.C. ... The STRING database in 2021: customizable protein–protein networks, and functional characterization of user-uploaded gene/measurement sets Nucleic Acids Res. 2021; 49 :D605-D612 Crossref Scopus (4155) PubMed Google Scholar ) to search for potential “hub proteins” linking PABPs and the translation initiation complex using text-mining, coexpression and experimental determination as active interaction sources. The interaction score was set to 0.700.
The split-luciferase assay was performed as previously described ( Chen et al., 2008 8. Chen, H. ∙ Zou, Y. ∙ Shang, Y. ... Firefly luciferase complementation imaging assay for protein-protein interactions in plants Plant Physiol. 2008; 146 :368-376 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 containing indicated construct was infiltrated into fully expanded Nb leaves at OD 600nm = 0.1. Leaf discs were taken after 2 days and incubated with 1 mM luciferin in a 96-well plate for 15 min. Luminescence was captured for 1 sec using the Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer). To detect the dynamic interaction of PABPs with eIF4G or eIFiso4G1, leaf discs were treated with 10 μM elf18 or water in the presence of 1 mM luciferin before luciferase measurement at the indicated times.
The co-IP assay was performed as in the PABP/R-motif binding assay. Briefly, 100-200 μg of indicated constructs were delivered into 3 mL protoplasts (from 5-10 fully expanded leaves digested in 3 mL enzyme solution) by PEG-mediated transfection ( Niu and Sheen, 2012 30. Niu, Y. ∙ Sheen, J. Transient expression assays for quantifying signaling output Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 876 :195-206 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ), incubated overnight and treated with water or 1 μM elf18 for 10 min. Samples were collected and lysed with 1 mL of the extraction buffer. After centrifuging at 16,000 g for 15 min, 60 μL supernatant was taken as input, and the rest of the sample was used to affinity-purify the co-IP complex through agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody and eluted with 3× FLAG peptide before immunoblotting.
Elf18-induced protection assay was performed as previously described ( Zhang et al., 2010 51. Zhang, J. ∙ Li, W. ∙ Xiang, T. ... Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases integrate signaling from multiple plant immune receptors and are targeted by a Pseudomonas syringae effector Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7 :290-301 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (627) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications, 3- to 4-week-old plants were pre-treated with water (mock) or 1 μM elf18 for 1 day, or pre-treated with 50 μM estradiol (for estradiol-inducible transgenes) for 1 day before treatment with mock or 1 μM elf18 in the presence of 50 μM estradiol for another day followed by inoculation with Psm ES4326 at OD 600nm = 0.001. After another 2 days, bacterial titer in the leaf was determined by serial dilutions in 10 mM MgCl 2 solution.
For phos-tag gel assay of protoplast-produced proteins, 15-20 μg of indicated constructs were introduced into 300 μL protoplasts prepared from WT or mutant plants, incubated overnight with or without 50 μM estradiol ( rack1-es ) or 2 μM NA-PP1 ( mpk6SR ), and treated with 1 μM elf18 or water for the indicated time. For phos-tag gel assay using proteins produced in transgenic plants, 7-day-old seedlings grown on solid ½ MS were transferred to liquid ½ MS overnight before being treated with mock or 10 μM elf18 for the indicated time. The candidate proteins were extracted with modified extraction buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 0.5% Triton-X 100, 1 mM DTT, 1× proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] and subjected to phos-tag gel analysis following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the candidate proteins were analyzed using 8% (PAB8) or 6% (eIF4G and eIFiso4G1) SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 40 μM MnCl 2 and 20 μM Phos-tag Acrylamide (FUJIFILM Wako). After electrophoresis, the gel was treated with the transfer buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM Glycine) containing 10 mM EDTA 3 times for 10 min each with gentle shaking and then one time without EDTA before protein transfer using the transfer buffer containing 0.05% SDS followed by immunoblotting.
The phospho-specific antibodies against PAB8 S566 , eIF4G S1066/T1069 , eIFiso4G1 S487 and eIFiso4G1 S542 were produced by Proteintech using the following peptides: Cys-GVHHRDS(p)PTSQPV (S566), Cys-KGLFPS(p)PHT(p)PMQVMH (S1066/T1069), Cys-SSGGPVS(p)PGPVYP (S487) and Cys-GPGPLHS(p)PAVSKS (S542).
Purified from E. coli , 200 ng MPK6-HIS was incubated with 2 μg GST-PAB8, GST-eIF4G or GST-eIFiso4G in 20 mL kinase reaction buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 100 mM ATP] at 30 °C for 30 min with GST-PAB8 S566A , GST-eIF4G 8A and GST-eIFiso4G1 2A as negative controls. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS loading buffer and treated at 95 °C for 10 min. The phosphorylation of PAB8 S566 , eIF4G S1066/T1069 , eIFiso4G1 S487 and eIFiso4G1 S542 were detected using anti-pS566, anti-pS1066/T1069, anti-pS487 and anti-pS542, antibodies, respectively.
Arabidopsis protoplasts were used for the transient expression of the FLAG-tagged PAB8 phospho-sites variants as previously described ( Niu and Sheen, 2012 30. Niu, Y. ∙ Sheen, J. Transient expression assays for quantifying signaling output Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 876 :195-206 Crossref Scopus (18) PubMed Google Scholar ) with modifications. In brief, 4 mL protoplasts (from 6-12 fully-expanded leaves digested in 4 mL enzyme solution) were transfected with 200 μg indicated plasmids and incubated overnight before treatment with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched by adding 125 mM Glycine for 5 min, followed by 2 times wash with W5 buffer. Samples were collected at 2,000 g for 30 sec and lysed with 900 μL of the lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 1× proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 200 U/mL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific)]. After centrifuging at 16,000 g for 15 min, 200 μL of the supernatant was taken and treated with 2 mg/mL Proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min to release RNAs cross-linked with proteins, followed by addition of 1 mL TRIzol and storage at -80 °C until further process (Input). The remaining supernatant was incubated with 5 μM oligos (5′-ACCAGAATTAGACTCAGAAGG-3′) targeting the TBF1 mRNA to guide digestion by 6 U/mL RNAse H (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C for 30 min to separate the 5′ fragment containing R-motifs from the 3′ poly (A) tail. The digested RNA sample was incubated with 50 μL agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), which was prewashed 5 times with ice-cold NT2 buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 40 U/mL RiboLock RNase Inhibitor] for 4 h at 4 °C with rotations. The precipitates were washed 5 times with the NT2 buffer and resuspended with 100 μL Proteinase K buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS]. 2 mg/mL Proteinase K was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to release RNAs (IP). The IP and Input RNA samples were subjected to 1 mL TRIzol extraction and reverse transcription using the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo) following the manufacturer's manual before qPCR was performed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Kit (Roche). The binding affinity of PAB8 to R-motif was measured by the ratio of IP RNA normalized to the Input RNA. The primers used are listed in Table S4 .
All experiments were repeated at least two times with similar results. Data plotting and statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. Statistical information is embedded in the figure legends.
