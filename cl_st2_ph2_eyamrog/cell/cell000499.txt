Title: Mammalian hybrid pre-autophagosomal structure HyPAS generates autophagosomes


Abstract: Summary

The biogenesis of mammalian autophagosomes remains to be fully defined. Here, we used cellular and in vitro membrane fusion analyses to show that autophagosomes are formed from a hitherto unappreciated hybrid membrane compartment. The autophagic precursors emerge through fusion of FIP200 vesicles, derived from the cis -Golgi, with endosomally derived ATG16L1 membranes to generate a hybrid pre-autophagosomal structure, HyPAS. A previously unrecognized apparatus defined here controls HyPAS biogenesis and mammalian autophagosomal precursor membranes. HyPAS can be modulated by pharmacological agents whereas its formation is inhibited upon severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or by expression of SARS-CoV-2 nsp6. These findings reveal the origin of mammalian autophagosomal membranes, which emerge via convergence of secretory and endosomal pathways, and show that this process is targeted by microbial factors such as coronaviral membrane-modulating proteins.

Section: Introduction

Autophagy is a fundamental biological process contributing to cytoplasmic quality control and cellular metabolism ( Deretic and Kroemer, 2021 29. Deretic, V. ∙ Kroemer, G.

The mammalian autophagy pathway induced by starvation is controlled by several protein modules ( Morishita and Mizushima, 2019 101. Morishita, H. ∙ Mizushima, N. Diverse Cellular Roles of Autophagy Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2019; 35 :453-475 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). This includes the FIP200 complex, with ULK1/2 kinase acting as the conduit for regulation by mTOR and AMPK, and a protein lipidation system that includes ATG16L1 and results in membrane association of mammalian Atg8 proteins (mAtg8s), such as the autophagosomal marker LC3B ( Morishita and Mizushima, 2019 101.

Canonical autophagosomes are presumed to originate from pre-existing membranes contributed by a number of putative sources ( Melia et al., 2020 96. Melia, T.J. ∙ Lystad, A.H. ∙ Simonsen, A.

Mammalian systems controlling autophagy include less understood but important contributors, extended synaptotagmins (E-SYTs) ( Nascimbeni et al., 2017 103.

E-SYTs function as Ca 2+ -regulated tethers between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) and participate in intermembrane lipid transfer ( Saheki et al., 2016 119.

A key area of interest in autophagy research is the integration of known protein complexes with the provenance and source of membranes for autophagosome formation and growth ( Hamasaki et al., 2013 56.

Autophagosome formation is initiated at phosphatidylinositol synthase-enriched ER subdomains EMBO J. 2017; 36 :1719-1735 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we show that FIP200 and ATG16L1 reside on two distinct sources of membranes, cis -Golgi and PM-derived endosomes respectively, which merge to form autophagosomes. This is a pivotal event leading to the formation of hybrid pre-autophagosomal structures (HyPAS) during autophagosomal biogenesis. Further, HyPAS is a hitherto unknown cellular target perturbed by SARS-CoV-2, positioned at the crossroads between autophagy and the biogenesis of specialized coronavirus-induced compartments ( Cottam et al., 2011 25.

Section: Results

To test whether FIP200 and ATG16L1 compartments fuse during autophagy induction, we employed a panel of techniques. Confocal microscopy and high content microscopy (HCM) quantification showed overlaps between FIP200 and ATG16L1 compartments, which increased upon autophagy induction by starvation (Earle’s balanced salt solution [EBSS]) using antibodies against endogenous proteins ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Similar results were observed with FIP200 and FLAG-ATG16L1 profiles in HeLa cells ( Figures 1 C and S1 A) and in primary human bronchial epithelial cells ( Figures S1 B and S1C).
In full medium, FIP200 displayed mostly perinuclear Golgi localization ( Figure S1 A) ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) and localized with the cis -Golgi marker GM130 ( Figures S1 D–S1F). Upon starvation-induced autophagy, FIP200 + GM130 + puncta did not increase in abundance ( Figures S1 E and S1F) but dispersed from their usual perinuclear location of the Golgi ( Figures S1 G–S1I), increasing the number of punctate FIP200 profiles ( Figures S1 J and S1K).
ATG16L1 profiles increased in cells induced for autophagy ( Figures S1 L and S1M), with a subset of FLAG-ATG16L1 colocalizing with both FIP200 and GM130 ( Figure S1 N). The percentage of FIP200 profiles positive for FLAG-ATG16L1 increased upon starvation-induced autophagy ( Figure S1 A) as quantified by HCM ( Figures 1 C and S1 O). This was confirmed with endogenous FIP200 and ATG16L1 ( Figures S1 P and S1Q) and, in another cell line, Huh7 ( Figures S1 R and S1S), indicating a merger of FIP200 and ATG16L1 profiles during autophagy induction.
By correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) ultrastructural analysis, this compartment appeared as a combination of vesicular and cisternal profiles, observed most distinctly in the vicinity of both lipid droplets ( Figure 1 D, subpanels i–iii) and unclosed autophagosomes ( Figure 1 D, subpanels iv–vii). In electron microscopy (EM) serial sections, the yellow fluorescence surrounding lipid droplets (corresponding to GFP-FIP200 and mCherry-ATG16L1) appeared morphologically as groups of vesicular (40–55 nm in diameter) ( Figure 1 D, white arrows) and cisternal ( Figure 1 D, gray arrows) structures of varying sizes and sometimes bent shapes. The morphologically distinct phagophore in Figure 1 D (subpanels iv-vii; traced in vii) overlapped with the yellow fluorescence corresponding to the phagophore membrane and was on a cradle of ER in the vicinity of a mitochondrion with potential ER-mitochondrion contact. We interpret the CLEM results as an indication that FIP200-ATG16L1 compartments coincide with vesicular and cisternal profiles in the vicinity of membranous profiles surrounding lipid droplets or are parts of standalone nascent phagophores.
Fluorescently labeled cholera toxin B (CtxB) has been used as a probe to define the ATG16L1 + endosomal compartments derived from PM that participate in autophagosome formation ( Ravikumar et al., 2010 116. Ravikumar, B. ∙ Moreau, K. ∙ Jahreiss, L. ... Plasma membrane contributes to the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 :747-757 Crossref Scopus (693) PubMed Google Scholar ). We used CtxB-Alexa Fluor 488 (CtxB-488) to detect mixing of cis -Golgi-derived FIP200 and endosomal ATG16L1 compartments. As with ATG16L1 puncta ( Figures S1 L and S1M), CtxB profiles increased during starvation ( Figures S1 T and S1U). The number of CtxB-488 + profiles that were simultaneously positive for FIP200 and ATG16L1 increased upon autophagy induction ( Figures S1 V–S1X) paralleled by increases in the percentage of CtxB-488 + profiles positive for FIP200 ( Figures S1 Y and S1Z) or FLAG-ATG16L1 ( Figures S1 A 1 and S1B 1 ). Several endosomal sub-compartments contribute to ATG16L1 autophagosome precursors, including ATG9A vesicles ( Moreau et al., 2011 100. Moreau, K. ∙ Ravikumar, B. ∙ Renna, M. ... Autophagosome precursor maturation requires homotypic fusion Cell. 2011; 146 :303-317 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ; Puri et al., 2013 113.

Diverse autophagosome membrane sources coalesce in recycling endosomes Cell. 2013; 154 :1285-1299 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (317) PubMed Google Scholar ). ATG9A KO cells showed increased basal colocalization between FIP200 and FLAG-ATG16L1 but no further increase upon starvation ( Figures S1 C 1 and S1D 1 ), suggesting that ATG9A affects the flow of membranes to these compartments. In summary, cis -Golgi-derived FIP200 and ATG16L1 originating from PM-derived endosomes merge during autophagy.
STX17 is a SNARE, first thought to play a role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion ( Itakura et al., 2012 69. Itakura, E. ∙ Kishi-Itakura, C. ∙ Mizushima, N.

Syntaxin 17 regulates the localization and function of PGAM5 in mitochondrial division and mitophagy EMBO J. 2018; 37 :e98899 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ) suggest that STX17 may act earlier in the pathway around initiation stages, consistent with STX17-ATG14L interactions ( Diao et al., 2015 30.

ATG14 promotes membrane tethering and fusion of autophagosomes to endolysosomes Nature. 2015; 520 :563-566 Crossref Scopus (403) PubMed Google Scholar ) and ATG14L’s function during initiation ( Baskaran et al., 2014 10.

STX17 influences FIP200-containing initiation complexes ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested whether STX17 affects the merger of FIP200 and ATG16L1 compartments by quantifying colocalization of FIP200 and FLAG-ATG16L1 profiles in STX17 knockout (KO) (STX17 HeLaKO ) ( Kumar et al., 2018 80. Kumar, S. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Farzam, F. ... Mechanism of Stx17 recruitment to autophagosomes via IRGM and mammalian Atg8 proteins J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :997-1013 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ) versus STX17 HeLaWT cells. STX17 was required for fusion of FIP200 and FLAG-ATG16L1 compartments ( Figures 1 E, 1F, S2 A, and S2B). A small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of human STX17 reduced overlap between FLAG-ATG16L1 and FIP200, a phenotype that was complemented by siRNA-insensitive mouse Stx17 ( Figures S2 C and S2D). GFP-STX17 colocalization with FLAG-ATG16L1 and FIP200 increased upon autophagy induction ( Figures S2 E and S2F). In STX17 HeLaKO cells, the area of FLAG-ATG16L1 punctate profiles increased upon autophagy induction ( Figures S2 G and S2H), reflecting precursor accumulation. Because STX17 is required for FIP200 peripheral profiles ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ), the number of FIP200 puncta was reduced in STX17 HeLaKO cells. ATG16L1 profiles increased in positivity for the endosomal marker transferrin receptor (TFRC) ( Figures S2 I and S2J). The defect in fusion was confirmed in a different cell line (Huh7) ( Gu et al., 2019 51. Gu, Y. ∙ Princely Abudu, Y. ∙ Kumar, S. ... Mammalian Atg8 proteins regulate lysosome and autolysosome biogenesis through SNAREs EMBO J. 2019; 38 :e101994 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ): STX17 Huh7KO showed no response to starvation whereas in STX17 Huh7WT cells the percentage of FIP200 + ATG16L1 + profiles increased ( Figures 1 G and S2 K). Super-resolution microscopy ( Figures 1 H and 1I) and cluster quantification showed that FIP200 and FLAG-ATG16L1 were dispersed in STX17 HeLaKO versus STX17 HeLaWT cells ( Figure 1 I). Thus, STX17 is a SNARE contributing to the merger of FIP200 and ATG16L1 compartments.
One hypothesis that emerged from the above studies is that FIP200 and ATG16L1 represent two precursor membranes with STX17 facilitating heterotypic fusion between them early in autophagy. To test this, we used an established assay for in vitro membrane fusion ( Matsui et al., 2018 93. Matsui, T. ∙ Jiang, P. ∙ Nakano, S. ...

HCV-induced autophagosomes are generated via homotypic fusion of phagophores that mediate HCV RNA replication PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13 :e1006609 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ). This method mixes vesicles from different cells expressing green (GFP-FIP200) and red (mCherry-ATG16L1) markers and, after addition of an ATP and ATP-regenerating system, vesicle fusion is monitored by fluorescence microscopy. We adapted this to permit HCM quantification allowing highly powered analyses and termed it IvitHC (in vitro fusion high content assay) ( Figure 2 A). ATP-dependent fusion between GFP-FIP200 and mCherry-ATG16L1 vesicles peaked 1 h after autophagy induction ( Figures S2 L and S2M), resulting in an 8-fold merger of GFP-FIP200 and mCherry-ATG16L1 in wild-type (WT) cells, whereas in STX17 HeLaKO , fusion was diminished ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Thus, STX17 is required for formation of a hybrid pre-autophagosomal structure (HyPAS) observed both in vivo and in vitro .
To confirm that membrane fusion occurs, we developed an assay for membrane-content mixing between the two compartments based on a combination of the RUSH ( Boncompain et al., 2012 13. Boncompain, G. ∙ Divoux, S. ∙ Gareil, N. ... Synchronization of secretory protein traffic in populations of cells Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :493-498 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ) and APEX2 ( Lam et al., 2015 84. Lam, S.S. ∙ Martell, J.D. ∙ Kamer, K.J. ... Directed evolution of APEX2 for electron microscopy and proteomics Nat Methods. 2015; 12 :51-54 Crossref Scopus (764) PubMed Google Scholar ) systems and termed it RUPEX ( Figure 2 D). RUPEX consists of an integral membrane protein target in one (“donor”) compartment and APEX2-fused to a different membrane protein in the partner (“acceptor”) compartment ( Figure 2 D). If the two membranous compartments fuse, either protein can diffuse through the delimiting membrane of the hybrid structure, and proximity biotinylation by APEX2 can occur. If the membranes are just tethered but not fused, the two membranes stay separated and APEX2 has no or very limited access to the target protein. To provide an additional layer of control, we employed the RUSH system ( Boncompain et al., 2012 13. Boncompain, G. ∙ Divoux, S. ∙ Gareil, N. ... Synchronization of secretory protein traffic in populations of cells Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :493-498 Crossref Scopus (350) PubMed Google Scholar ), which is based on a “hook” and a “reporter” ( Figure 2 D). The hook acts as a clamp and keeps the reporter transmembrane protein in the ER (based on streptavidin-streptavidin binding protein/SBP cassette integrated into the transmembrane protein). Only upon breaking the hook-reporter interaction, which is sensitive to biotin, is the reporter free to traffic to its normal intracellular location. We employed the characterized ManII-reporter and an ER hook, which allowed us to control location of ManII in the cell: only after adding biotin did ManII relocate to cis -Golgi ( Figure S2 N) and colocalize with FIP200 ( Figure S2 O).
The acceptor compartment in the RUPEX system consisted of APEX2-TFRC, with APEX2 facing the cytosol. Target biotinylation (ManII) can occur only after the two compartments fuse allowing ManII and TFRC to come in proximity by diffusion. ManII was biotinylated (assessed by enrichment on avidin beads followed by immunoblotting) in cells co-expressing APEX2-TFRC only after release of the RUSH clamp and was enhanced by starvation but only in STX17 WT and not STX17 KO cells ( Figures 2 E and 2F). A KO of FIP200 in HeLa cells reduced starvation-induced mixing of the two compartments ( Figures 2 G and 2H). For comparison, we tested the effects of RUBCN. RUBCN is required for LC3 lipidation on noncanonical single membrane structures but is not required for double membrane canonical autophagy ( Martinez et al., 2015 92. Martinez, J. ∙ Malireddi, R.K. ∙ Lu, Q. ... Molecular characterization of LC3-associated phagocytosis reveals distinct roles for Rubicon, NOX2 and autophagy proteins Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 :893-906 Crossref Scopus (610) PubMed Google Scholar ). Knocking out RUBCN affected neither starvation-induced membrane mixing ( Figure S2 P) nor HyPAS formation ( Figures S2 Q and S2R). Thus, the starvation-induced mixing between cis -/early-Golgi compartments (ManII) and endosomal compartments (TFRC) required FIP200, a component of the canonical autophagy core complex transducing signals from mTOR and AMPK upon starvation-induced autophagy.
We tested whether HyPAS is on the pathway for downstream ATG-dependent processes of canonical autophagy or noncanonical pathways ( Galluzzi and Green, 2019 39. Galluzzi, L. ∙ Green, D.R. Autophagy-Independent Functions of the Autophagy Machinery Cell. 2019; 177 :1682-1699 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (527) PubMed Google Scholar ) such as LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) ( Martinez et al., 2015 92. Martinez, J. ∙ Malireddi, R.K. ∙ Lu, Q. ... Molecular characterization of LC3-associated phagocytosis reveals distinct roles for Rubicon, NOX2 and autophagy proteins Nat.

Pharmacological modulators of autophagy activate a parallel noncanonical pathway driving unconventional LC3 lipidation Autophagy. 2017; 13 :854-867 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparing STX17 HeLaKO and STX17 HeLaWT cells, we detected no effects of STX17 KO on increase in LC3-ATG16L1 overlap, as a measure of LAP-like noncanonical autophagy ( Fletcher et al., 2018 36.

We next used early markers of autophagy initiation, phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS) ( Nishimura et al., 2017 107. Nishimura, T. ∙ Tamura, N. ∙ Kono, N. ... Autophagosome formation is initiated at phosphatidylinositol synthase-enriched ER subdomains EMBO J. 2017; 36 :1719-1735 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ) and DFCP1 ( Axe et al., 2008 7. Axe, E.L. ∙ Walker, S.A. ∙ Manifava, M. ... Autophagosome formation from membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and dynamically connected to the endoplasmic reticulum J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182 :685-701 Crossref Scopus (1415) PubMed Google Scholar ). STX17 KO prevented starvation-induced greater colocalization between endogenous FIP200 and mCherry-PIS ( Figures S3 A–S3C). DFCP1 marks omegasomes, membranous structures found in the proximity of LC3 profiles believed to act as a cradle for nascent autophagosomes ( Axe et al., 2008 7. Axe, E.L. ∙ Walker, S.A. ∙ Manifava, M. ... Autophagosome formation from membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and dynamically connected to the endoplasmic reticulum J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182 :685-701 Crossref Scopus (1415) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tooze and Yoshimori, 2010 143. Tooze, S.A. ∙ Yoshimori, T. The origin of the autophagosomal membrane Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12 :831-835 Crossref Scopus (455) PubMed Google Scholar ). DFCP1 kinetically segregated from HyPAS and appeared later than HyPAS ( Figures S3 D and S3E). HyPAS formation preceded WIPI2b ( Dooley et al., 2014 31. Dooley, H.C. ∙ Razi, M. ∙ Polson, H.E. ... WIPI2 links LC3 conjugation with PI3P, autophagosome formation, and pathogen clearance by recruiting Atg12-5-16L1 Mol. Cell. 2014; 55 :238-252 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (559) PubMed Google Scholar ) but eventually became positive for WIPI2b ( Figures S3 F and S3G). HyPAS appearance preceded LC3 + stage by 15 min ( Figures S3 H and S3I) with delayed recruitment of LC3 to HyPAS 30 min after autophagy induction. This makes HyPAS a prophagophore. Double positive LC3 + FLAG-ATG16L1 + profiles were reduced in STX17 KO cells ( Figures S3 J–S3L). HyPAS was independent of the six mATG8s inactivated in Hexa KO cells ( Nguyen et al., 2016 104. Nguyen, T.N. ∙ Padman, B.S. ∙ Usher, J. ... Atg8 family LC3/GABARAP proteins are crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion but not autophagosome formation during PINK1/Parkin mitophagy and starvation J. Cell Biol. 2016; 215 :857-874 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ) (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2) that showed normal HyPAS formation ( Figures S3 M and S3N). We conclude that HyPAS formation through STX17-dependent heterotypic fusion of FIP200 and ATG16L1 vesicles affects other known events during autophagy initiation.
FIP200 and ATG16L1 form protein complexes ( Fujita et al., 2013 37. Fujita, N. ∙ Morita, E. ∙ Itoh, T. ...

FIP200 regulates targeting of Atg16L1 to the isolation membrane EMBO Rep. 2013; 14 :284-291 Crossref Scopus (136) PubMed Google Scholar ). Does formation of these complexes need fusion of precursor membranes? We compared the ability of endogenous FIP200 and FLAG-tagged ATG16L1 to form protein complexes in HeLa WT versus STX17 KO cells. STX17 was absolutely required for detection of FIP200-ATG16L1 complexes ( Figures 3 A and 3B), confirmed with endogenous proteins ( Figure S3 O).
We examined the distribution of endogenous ATG16L1 and FIP200 by cell membrane fractionation. In cells induced for autophagy by starvation, a membranous compartment with ATG16L1 and FIP200 was formed (HyPAS) ( Figure S3 P, left panel). At least a portion of this compartment contained LC3-II, a downstream autophagosomal marker. HyPAS membranes were enhanced in intensity in cells induced for autophagy (EBSS) relative to fed cells ( Figure S3 P). This compartment did not form in STX17 KO cells ( Figure S3 Q, right). Instead, in STX17 KO cells, ATG16L1 and FIP200 floated in a very light membranous neo-compartment, in addition to FIP200 being retained in heavy fractions together with the Golgi marker GM130 ( Figure S3 Q).
Proteomic analyses with STX17 ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) revealed two R-SNAREs, VAMP7 and VAMP8, as STX17 interactors ( Figure 3 C), in keeping with prior work ( Wang et al., 2016 151. Wang, Z. ∙ Miao, G. ∙ Xue, X. ... The Vici Syndrome Protein EPG5 Is a Rab7 Effector that Determines the Fusion Specificity of Autophagosomes with Late Endosomes/Lysosomes Mol. Cell. 2016; 63 :781-795 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). VAMP8 is implicated in autophagosome-lysosome fusion ( Itakura et al., 2012 69. Itakura, E. ∙ Kishi-Itakura, C. ∙ Mizushima, N. The hairpin-type tail-anchored SNARE syntaxin 17 targets to autophagosomes for fusion with endosomes/lysosomes Cell. 2012; 151 :1256-1269 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (906) PubMed Google Scholar ). VAMP7’s role is less clear albeit it is implicated in autophagy initiation via ATG16L1 vesicles ( Moreau et al., 2011 100. Moreau, K. ∙ Ravikumar, B. ∙ Renna, M. ... Autophagosome precursor maturation requires homotypic fusion Cell. 2011; 146 :303-317 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (305) PubMed Google Scholar ). Under basal conditions, VAMP7 associated with ATG16L1 but not with FIP200 in coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) whereas STX17 associated with FIP200 ( Figures 3 D and 3E). In cells induced for autophagy, FLAG-STX17 and endogenous VAMP7 colocalized ( Figure S3 R). VAMP7 colocalized with HyPAS in starved cells ( Figure S3 S). Knocking down (KD) VAMP7 reduced the formation of HyPAS ( Figures 3 F, 3G, S3 T, and S3U) whereas KD of VAMP8 did not ( Figures S4 A and S4B). We tested in vitro the effects of VAMP7 on HyPAS formation by IvitHC and found reduced HyPAS formation using vesicles from VAMP7 KD cells ( Figures 3 H–3J). Thus, VAMP7 contributes to early stages of autophagosome formation via fusion of FIP200 + and ATG16L1 + precursor membranes.
Proteomic analyses with STX17 ( Figure S4 C) showed that it interacts with the Q bc SNARE SNAP-47 in addition to its well characterized Q bc partner SNAP-29 ( Diao et al., 2015 30.

SNAP-47 CoIPed with STX17 but not with STX17 lacking its SNARE domain ( Figures S4 E and S4F). KD of SNAP-29 did not affect HyPAS formation ( Figure S4 G), suggesting that this Q bc SNARE, which acts in autophagosome-lysosome fusion ( Diao et al., 2015 30. Diao, J. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Rong, Y. ...

STX17 is phosphorylated by TBK1 at S202, and this is important in formation of mammalian pre-autophagosomal structures ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ). We tested whether TBK1 affected HyPAS formation. TBK1 KO HeLa cells ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) had reduced HyPAS formation ( Figures 3 K and 3L). VAMP7, but not VAMP8, lost binding to a non-phosphorylatable mutant (S202A) of STX17 ( Figures S4 H–S4K). Complementation of STX17 KO cells with WT STX17 or with its phosphomimetic mutant STX17 S202D rescued HyPAS formation, whereas the non-phosphorylatable STX17 S202 A mutant did not ( Figures 3 M and S4 L). Thus, phosphorylation of STX17 and its kinase TBK1 regulate the specificity of STX17 interactions with its R-SNARE partners during HyPAS formation.
Mining the mass spectrometry database MS (MSV000083251) deposited for proteomic analyses with GFP-STX17 ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) uncovered that one of STX17’s binding partners is the ubiquitous ER calcium pump SERCA2 ( Figure 4 A) participating in the early stages of autophagosomal biogenesis ( Zhao et al., 2017 161. Zhao, Y.G. ∙ Chen, Y. ∙ Miao, G. ... The ER-Localized Transmembrane Protein EPG-3/VMP1 Regulates SERCA Activity to Control ER-Isolation Membrane Contacts for Autophagosome Formation Mol. Cell. 2017; 67 :974-989.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (130) PubMed Google Scholar ). The interaction between STX17 and SERCA2 was observed with endogenous proteins ( Figure 4 B) and confirmed in CoIP between GFP-STX17 and SERCA2 ( Figure S4 M). FLAG-STX17 colocalized with endogenous SERCA2 ( Figure S4 N). SERCA2 pumping removes cytosolic Ca 2+ ( MacLennan and Kranias, 2003 90. MacLennan, D.H. ∙ Kranias, E.G. Phospholamban: a crucial regulator of cardiac contractility Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4 :566-577 Crossref Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar ; Periasamy and Kalyanasundaram, 2007 110.

Biol. 2011; 3 :a004184 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ), and conceivably, STX17-SERCA2 interactions could involve Ca 2+ . Thus, we tested whether chelating cytoplasmic Ca 2 + with BAPTA-AM affected HyPAS formation. Under starvation-induced autophagy, HyPAS formation was reduced by BAPTA-AM to an extent similar to the effects of STX17 KO, whereas BAPTA-AM did not further affect HyPAS formation in STX17 KO cells ( Figures 4 C, 4D, S4 O, and S4P). A similar effect of chelation by BAPTA was observed by IvitHC ( Figures 4 E and 4F). SERCA2 is inhibited by thapsigargin (TG), and so the expected effect of TG would be increased HyPAS formation. In cells treated with TG ( Engedal et al., 2013 33. Engedal, N. ∙ Torgersen, M.L. ∙ Guldvik, I.J. ... Modulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis blocks autophagosome formation Autophagy. 2013; 9 :1475-1490 Crossref Scopus (76) PubMed Google Scholar ; Ganley et al., 2011 42. Ganley, I.G. ∙ Wong, P.M. ∙ Gammoh, N. ... Distinct autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion mechanism revealed by thapsigargin-induced autophagy arrest Mol. Cell. 2011; 42 :731-743 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ), HyPAS formation was increased in basal conditions ( Figure 4 G). The effect of TG was abrogated in STX17 KO cells ( Figures 4 G, 4H, S4 Q, and S4R). SERCA2 expression inhibited HyPAS ( Figure 4 I). SERCA2 was present in multiple fractions on OptiPrep gradients ( Figure S3 P). During autophagy induction (Hank’s balanced salt solution [HBSS]), cytosolic Ca 2+ (measured by FLUO-3) was elevated ( Figures 4 J and 4K), as described ( Cárdenas et al., 2010 17. Cárdenas, C. ∙ Miller, R.A. ∙ Smith, I. ... Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics by constitutive InsP3 receptor Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria Cell. 2010; 142 :270-283 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (815) PubMed Google Scholar ). In STX17 KO cells, cytosolic calcium did not increase, consistent with unabated activity of SERCA2 in the absence of its partner STX17 ( Figures 4 J and 4K). We conclude that STX17 interacts with SERCA2 and that STX17 directly or indirectly inhibits its function ( Figure 4 L) during autophagy induction.
Among other potential interactors of STX17 based on the MS (MSV000083251) database, we identified E-SYT2 as an STX17 partner ( Figure 5 A). E-SYT2 is a member of the ESYT family of ER proteins with a role for Ca 2+ in tethering to PM ( Giordano et al., 2013 49. Giordano, F. ∙ Saheki, Y. ∙ Idevall-Hagren, O. ...

Interactions between STX17 and E-SYT2 were observed with endogenous proteins ( Figure 5 B) and confirmed in CoIP ( Figure S5 A). FLAG-STX17 and GFP-E-SYT2 profiles overlapped by immunofluorescence ( Figure 5 C). FLAG-E-SYT2 colocalized with HyPAS ( Figure S5 B). E-SYT2-KD prevented HyPAS formation ( Figures S5 C–S5E) indicative of fusion arrest by the juxtaposition of ATG16L1 and FIP200 profiles ( Figure S5 C) similar to the STX17 KO effects ( Figure 1 E).
E-SYT2 KO cells ( Saheki et al., 2016 119. Saheki, Y. ∙ Bian, X. ∙ Schauder, C.M. ... Control of plasma membrane lipid homeostasis by the extended synaptotagmins Nat.

E-SYT2 was necessary for in vitro HyPAS formation by IvitHC ( Figures 5 G and 5H). E-SYT2 was required for mixing of cis -Golgi and endosomal compartments in the RUPEX assay ( Figures 5 I and 5J). Finally, E-SYT2 was important for HyPAS formation in response to SERCA inhibition by TG ( Figures S5 G and S5H), suggesting that it acts as a downstream effector of SERCA and Ca 2+ . Thus, in addition to SERCA, which regulates cytosolic Ca 2+ , E-SYT2, which can act as an effector of Ca 2+ ( Giordano et al., 2013 49. Giordano, F. ∙ Saheki, Y. ∙ Idevall-Hagren, O. ...

E-SYTs play a role in membrane tethering at ER-PM contact sites ( Giordano et al., 2013 49. Giordano, F. ∙ Saheki, Y. ∙ Idevall-Hagren, O. ...

Synaptotagmins in principle control SNARE complexes with the paradigm being based on synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) ( Brose et al., 1992 16. Brose, N. ∙ Petrenko, A.G. ∙ Südhof, T.C. ... Synaptotagmin: a calcium sensor on the synaptic vesicle surface Science. 1992; 256 :1021-1025 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Chapman, 2002 20. Chapman, E.R. Synaptotagmin: a Ca(2+) sensor that triggers exocytosis? Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3 :498-508 Crossref Scopus (380) PubMed Google Scholar ). We thus wondered if E-SYT2 may have an as-yet unrecognized function in HyPAS formation catalyzed by SNAREs. Homology alignments with SYT1 revealed conserved polybasic regions in E-SYT2′s C2C domain corresponding to the polybasic region in SYT1’s C2B domain ( Figure 5 K). We mutated six basic residues in E-SYT2 (K805, R806, R807, R809, R810, and K811A) to generate E-SYT2 6A . The corresponding polybasic stretch in SYT1 is essential for the regulatory effects of SYT1 on its cognate syntaxin ( Brewer et al., 2015 15. Brewer, K.D. ∙ Bacaj, T. ∙ Cavalli, A. ... Dynamic binding mode of a Synaptotagmin-1-SNARE complex in solution Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22 :555-564 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). CoIP analyses showed reduced binding to STX17 of E-SYT2 6A versus GFP-E-SYT2 WT ( Figures 5 L and 5M). E-SYT2 6A could not rescue HyPAS formation in E-SYT2 KO, whereas E-SYT2 WT did ( Figure 5 N and S5 I). Thus, mutational analysis, based on prototypical synaptotagmin-syntaxin relationships, revealed that E-SYT2 interacts with STX17 to regulate its function in HyPAS formation.
We observed reduced levels of STX17 in VAMP7 immunoprecipitates from E-SYT2 KO cells ( Figures 5 O and 5P). Comparing overexpressed GFP-VAMP7 and GFP-VAMP8 in complexes with FLAG-STX17, we observed that in E-SYT2 KO cells GFP-VAMP7, but not GFP-VAMP8, was diminished in SNARE complexes ( Figures 5 Q and 5R). Thus E-SYT2, in addition to its previously characterized roles in lipid transfer ( Saheki et al., 2016 119. Saheki, Y. ∙ Bian, X. ∙ Schauder, C.M. ... Control of plasma membrane lipid homeostasis by the extended synaptotagmins Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18 :504-515 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) and PI3P production at ER-PM contact sites during peripheral LC3 puncta formation ( Nascimbeni et al., 2017 103. Nascimbeni, A.C. ∙ Giordano, F. ∙ Dupont, N. ... ER-plasma membrane contact sites contribute to autophagosome biogenesis by regulation of local PI3P synthesis EMBO J. 2017; 36 :2018-2033 Crossref Scopus (137) PubMed Google Scholar ), plays a role in early stages of autophagosome formation.
The STX17 interactors controlling HyPAS formation (SERCA and E-SYT2) are located in the ER. Another ER-localized interactor of STX17 is SIGMAR1 ( Yang et al., 2019 157. Yang, H. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Li, J. ... SIGMAR1/Sigma-1 receptor ablation impairs autophagosome clearance Autophagy. 2019; 15 :1539-1557 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), which plays a role in autophagy ( Christ et al., 2019 23.

Yang, H. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Li, J. ... SIGMAR1/Sigma-1 receptor ablation impairs autophagosome clearance Autophagy. 2019; 15 :1539-1557 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). SIGMAR1 co-fractionated with HyPAS in OptiPrep density gradients ( Figure S3 P). HyPAS formation was reduced in SIGMAR1 KO cells ( Yang et al., 2019 157. Yang, H. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Li, J. ... SIGMAR1/Sigma-1 receptor ablation impairs autophagosome clearance Autophagy. 2019; 15 :1539-1557 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) relative to WT cells ( Figures 6 A–6C). FLAG-SIGMAR1 CoIPed with VAMP7 ( Figure S5 J). Complementation of SIGMAR1 KO with full-length FLAG-SIGMAR1 recovered HyPAS formation ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S5 K). Expression of a truncated version of SIGMAR1, FLAG-SIGMAR1N80 ( Yang et al., 2019 157. Yang, H. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Li, J. ... SIGMAR1/Sigma-1 receptor ablation impairs autophagosome clearance Autophagy. 2019; 15 :1539-1557 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), consisting of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and only a portion of the cytosolic-facing surface of the SIGMAR1 protomers within the SIGMAR1 trimeric architecture ( Schmidt et al., 2016 123. Schmidt, H.R. ∙ Zheng, S. ∙ Gurpinar, E. ... Crystal structure of the human σ1 receptor Nature. 2016; 532 :527-530 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not restore HyPAS formation ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S5 K). This was in keeping with effects on mitophagy ( Yang et al., 2019 157. Yang, H. ∙ Shen, H. ∙ Li, J. ... SIGMAR1/Sigma-1 receptor ablation impairs autophagosome clearance Autophagy. 2019; 15 :1539-1557 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, the ability of SIGMAR1 to form trimers or to interact with additional components is necessary for HyPAS formation in autophagy.
We tested whether E-SYT2 and, by extension, HyPAS are responsible for removal of autophagic cargo. We tested Parkin-dependent mitophagy ( Narendra et al., 2008 102. Narendra, D. ∙ Tanaka, A. ∙ Suen, D.F. ... Parkin is recruited selectively to impaired mitochondria and promotes their autophagy J.

Cell Biol. 2016; 215 :857-874 Crossref Scopus (409) PubMed Google Scholar ) by HCM while gating on YFP-Parkin + cells. E-SYT2 KO cells had diminished mitophagy relative to WT elicited with OA (oligomycin+antimycin) ( Figures 6 F and 6G) or CCCP ( Figures S5 L and S5M). In a complementation assay, E-SYT2 6A mutant, which does not bind STX17, failed to restore mitophagy whereas E-SYT2 WT did ( Figures 6 H and S6 A). SIGMAR1 KO cells transfected with YFP-Parkin showed reduced mitophagy in response to CCCP ( Figures S6 B and S6C). Thus, HyPAS is required for mitophagy.
We next tested autophagy of ribosomes (ribophagy) ( An and Harper, 2018 3. An, H. ∙ Harper, J.W. Systematic analysis of ribophagy in human cells reveals bystander flux during selective autophagy Nat.

We transfected the RPL28-Keima ribophagy probe ( An and Harper, 2018 3. An, H. ∙ Harper, J.W. Systematic analysis of ribophagy in human cells reveals bystander flux during selective autophagy Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :135-143 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ) into WT and E-SYT2 KO HeLa cells. After starvation for 8 h in EBSS, Keima-positive autolysosomal organelles engaged in ribophagy were quantified by HCM (Ex/Em 560/620 nm) ( Katayama et al., 2011 72.

Soc. 2009; 131 :10356-10357 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). E-SYT2 KO cells showed reduced ribophagy relative to E-SYT2 WT parental cells ( Figures S6 D and S6E). The E-SYT2 6A mutant failed to complement ribophagy whereas E-SYT2 WT did ( Figures S6 F and S6G). SIGMAR1 KO 293A cells exhibited reduced ribophagy ( Figures 6 I and S6 H). Thus, HyPAS is important for ribophagy.
We next tested bulk autophagy ( Kopitz et al., 1990 79. Kopitz, J. ∙ Kisen, G.O. ∙ Gordon, P.B. ... Nonselective autophagy of cytosolic enzymes by isolated rat hepatocytes J.

Autophagic bulk sequestration of cytosolic cargo is independent of LC3, but requires GABARAPs Exp.

Systematic analysis of ribophagy in human cells reveals bystander flux during selective autophagy Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20 :135-143 Crossref Scopus (110) PubMed Google Scholar ). E-SYT2 KO cells had fewer autolysosomes containing the bulk autophagy probe LDH-Keima relative to E-SYT2 WT cells ( Figures 6 J and S6 I), with a similar result in SIGMAR1 KO 293A cells ( Figures 6 K and S6 J).
In response to starvation, E-SYT2KO cells exhibited reduced lipophagy-lipolysis ( Zechner et al., 2017 159. Zechner, R. ∙ Madeo, F. ∙ Kratky, D. Cytosolic lipolysis and lipophagy: two sides of the same coin Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18 :671-684 Crossref Scopus (300) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figures S6 K and S6L) and degradation of endogenous SQSTM1/p62 ( Figures S6 M and S6N), a principal autophagy receptor ( Bjørkøy et al., 2005 12.

Chem. 2007; 282 :24131-24145 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3527) PubMed Google Scholar ). The starvation-induced degradation of p62 paralleled that of ManII ( Figures S6 O and S6P), an early Golgi resident enzyme that colocalizes with FIP200 and was utilized in the RUPEX assay ( Figure S2 O). ManII was degraded during starvation, abrogated in E-SYT2 KO cells ( Figures S6 O and S6P). Thus, HyPAS is critical for autophagy of diverse cargo.
Phagophores eventually close to sequester cargo. E-SYT2 was required for protection of p62 from proteinase K ( Nguyen et al., 2016 104. Nguyen, T.N. ∙ Padman, B.S. ∙ Usher, J. ...

ESCRT-mediated phagophore sealing during mitophagy Autophagy. 2020; 16 :826-841 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). When cells are depleted of the ESCRT-III component CHMP2A, this results in morphologically scorable aberrant retention of the ESCRT-III component CHMP4B ( Teis et al., 2008 140. Teis, D. ∙ Saksena, S. ∙ Emr, S.D. Ordered assembly of the ESCRT-III complex on endosomes is required to sequester cargo during MVB formation Dev.

ESCRT-mediated phagophore sealing during mitophagy Autophagy. 2020; 16 :826-841 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). In cells induced for autophagy by starvation, CHMP4B puncta increased upon CHMP2A KD, indicative of accumulating unclosed autophagosomes ( Zhen et al., 2020 162. Zhen, Y. ∙ Spangenberg, H. ∙ Munson, M.J. ... ESCRT-mediated phagophore sealing during mitophagy Autophagy. 2020; 16 :826-841 Crossref Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CHMP4B puncta were diminished in E-SYT2 KO HeLa cells, indicative of fewer phagophores being formed ( Figures S6 S and S6T).

In the IvitHC assay, CQ inhibited HyPAS formation in vitro ( Figures S7 A and S7B) whereas bafilomycin A1 did not ( Figures S7 A and S7B). The known CQ target SIGMAR1 was important for STX17 and E-SYT2 interactions ( Figures S7 C and S7D) whereas CQ treatment inhibited them ( Figures S7 E and S7F). The effect was specific because CQ did not inhibit STX17 and SERCA2 interactions ( Figures S7 E and S7G). Thus, CQ interferes with autophagy at a very early point, i.e., HyPAS formation.

The agonist cutamesine induced HyPAS formation in cells grown in full medium ( Figures S7 H and S7I) whereas the antagonist BD1047 inhibited HyPAS formation induced by starvation ( Figures S7 J and S7K). Thus, pharmacological agonists and antagonists of SIGMAR1 affect the formation of the precursor structure to mammalian autophagosomes.

Chloroquine does not inhibit infection of human lung cells with SARS-CoV-2 Nature. 2020; 585 :588-590 Crossref Scopus (291) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) using viral preparations causing cytopathic effect in Vero E6 ( Bradfute et al., 2020 14. Bradfute, S.B. ∙ Hurwitz, I. ∙ Yingling, A.V. ... Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Neutralizing Antibody Titers in Convalescent Plasma and Recipients in New Mexico: An Open Treatment Study in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 J. Infect. Dis. 2020; 222 :1620-1628 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and verified in Huh7 cells ( Figure S7 L). SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibited HyPAS formation in Calu3 ( Figures 7 A and 7B) and Huh7 ( Figures S7 M and S7N) cells. Thus, HyPAS is affected by SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV nsp6 causes LC3 puncta to be smaller than regular autophagosomes ( Cottam et al., 2014 26. Cottam, E.M. ∙ Whelband, M.C. ∙ Wileman, T. Coronavirus NSP6 restricts autophagosome expansion Autophagy. 2014; 10 :1426-1441 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ). The SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 polyprotein, which includes nsp6, shows 76% identity to SARS-CoV ( Zhou et al., 2020 163. Zhou, P. ∙ Yang, X.L. ∙ Wang, X.G. ... A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin Nature. 2020; 579 :270-273 Crossref Scopus (13990) PubMed Google Scholar ). We carried out proximity biotinylation proteomic analysis with APEX2-SARS-CoV-2-nsp6 in stably transfected (Flp-In) cells with APEX2-nsp6 expression controlled by the Tet-ON system ( Figure 7 C; Tables S1 A–S1C). The functionality of the SARS-CoV2-nsp6 construct was validated in an assay developed for nsp6 of SARS-CoV ( Cottam et al., 2014 26. Cottam, E.M. ∙ Whelband, M.C. ∙ Wileman, T. Coronavirus NSP6 restricts autophagosome expansion Autophagy. 2014; 10 :1426-1441 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 O). The proteomic data confirmed the previously reported nsp6-SIGMAR1 interaction ( Gordon et al., 2020 50. Gordon, D.E. ∙ Jang, G.M. ∙ Bouhaddou, M. ... A SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map reveals targets for drug repurposing Nature. 2020; 583 :459-468 Crossref Scopus (2759) PubMed Google Scholar ) and revealed that nsp6 interacts with VAMP7, E-SYT2, SERCA2, and TBK1 ( Figure 7 D; Table S1 B). Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 and SERCA2 were validated by CoIP ( Figure S7 P). In summary, proximity biotinylation proteomic analysis uncovered E-SYT2, VAMP7, and SERCA2 as SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 interactors and revealed that the HyPAS regulator TBK1, which phosphorylates STX17 ( Kumar et al., 2019 81. Kumar, S. ∙ Gu, Y. ∙ Abudu, Y.P. ... Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 17 by TBK1 Controls Autophagy Initiation Dev. Cell. 2019; 49 :130-144.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ) and authorizes it to engage VAMP7, is targeted by SARS-CoV-2 nsp6.
We next tested whether SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 affects HyPAS. Following published procedures ( Cottam et al., 2014 26. Cottam, E.M. ∙ Whelband, M.C. ∙ Wileman, T. Coronavirus NSP6 restricts autophagosome expansion Autophagy. 2014; 10 :1426-1441 Crossref Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ), we expressed SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 in HeLa cells and quantified HyPAS formation by HCM. SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 (GFP-nsp6) reduced HyPAS yields upon autophagy induction (EBSS) ( Figures 7 E, S7 Q, and S7R). In contrast to nsp6, expression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, reported to interfere with autophagosomal fusion with lysosomes ( Miao et al., 2021 97. Miao, G. ∙ Zhao, H. ∙ Li, Y. ... ORF3a of the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 blocks HOPS complex-mediated assembly of the SNARE complex required for autolysosome formation Dev. Cell. 2021; 56 :427-442.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ), or SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 did not significantly inhibit HyPAS formation ( Figures 7 F, 7G, S7 S, and S7T).
To test the effects of nsp6 in vitro by IvitHC, we co-expressed FLAG-nsp6 SARS-CoV-2 with GFP-FIP200 and separately co-expressed FLAG-nsp6 with mCherry-ATG16L1 in HeLa cells before preparing vesicles for in vitro fusion ( Figure 7 H). IvitHC showed that nsp6 SARS-CoV-2 inhibited HyPAS formation in vitro ( Figures 7 I and 7J). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 interferes with early formation of autophagosomes at the HyPAS stage.

Section: Discussion

We have identified a critical step in the biogenesis of canonical autophagosomes in mammalian cells. This step is embodied in HyPAS, a prophagophore compartment formed through fusion of membranes derived from the constitutive secretory pathway and the endosomal pathway ( Figure 7 K). The system responds to starvation, a classical inducer of autophagy, and engages ATG16L1-positive endosomal vesicles ( Lystad et al., 2019 89. Lystad, A.H. ∙ Carlsson, S.R. ∙ de la Ballina, L.R. ...

Thus, mammalian cells commit to autophagy through a regulated intermixing of two membrane sources that are normally not intended to directly communicate, one working vectorially within the secretory pathway and the other running in the opposite direction via the endocytic pathway.

A long-standing question in mammalian autophagy has been where the autophagosomal membranes come from.

Our study provides the physical and mechanistic link between the two disparate theses and explains how they can both be correct. This accommodates the reported role of ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and COPII vesicles ( Ge et al., 2013 45. Ge, L. ∙ Melville, D. ∙ Zhang, M. ...

HyPAS is formed via SNARE-dependent fusion centered upon STX17 and is affected by Ca 2+ . The role of Ca 2+ along the autophagosomal-autolysosomal continuum is complex and acts as a positive or negative regulator depending on the checkpoint reached: (1) prolonged Ca 2+ influx from ER to mitochondria (mitochondria-associated ER-membranes [MAM]) ( Hayashi and Su, 2007 58.

(2) As we show, Ca 2+ is a positive co-factor for HyPAS formation with all three STX17 partners within the HyPAS apparatus, SIGMAR1 ( Hayashi and Su, 2007 58. Hayashi, T. ∙ Su, T.P.

SIGMAR1 redistributes in response to Ca 2+ from the MAM to the entire ER ( Hayashi and Su, 2007 58. Hayashi, T. ∙ Su, T.P.

(3) Ca 2+ is a negative regulator of phagophore separation from membranes to which they are initially tethered ( Bissa and Deretic, 2018 11. Bissa, B. ∙ Deretic, V.

(4) Pharmacological inhibition of SERCA prevents fusion between autophagosomes and lysosome ( Ganley et al., 2011 42. Ganley, I.G. ∙ Wong, P.M. ∙ Gammoh, N. ...

Thus, Ca 2+ transients are necessary to move the autophagy pathway from its beginning to its completion.

STX17 orchestrates progression of the autophagy pathway, whereby different combinations of STX17 and its R-SNARE partners catalyze sequential stages. During HyPAS formation, STX17 favors VAMP7 over VAMP8, which acts in autolysosome formation ( Diao et al., 2015 30. Diao, J. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Rong, Y. ...

Some aspects of coronavirus VRCs include morphological features of autophagosomes (e.g., DMVs) ( Snijder et al., 2006 128. Snijder, E.J. ∙ van der Meer, Y. ∙ Zevenhoven-Dobbe, J. ...

The inhibition of HyPAS by SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 suggests potential diversion of membrane sources engaged in autophagy toward the formation of DMVs and CMs to support coronavirus RTCs.

A molecular pore spans the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle Science. 2020; 369 :1395-1398 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Our own proximity biotinylation proteomic analysis (MSV000087840) with SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 indicates multiple interactions between nsp6 and components of the HyPAS fusion apparatus (E-SYT2, VAMP7, and SIGMAR1) and regulators of HyPAS formation including SERCA2 (Ca 2+ pump with Ca 2+ being a key signal for HyPAS formation), TBK1 (a protein kinase phosphorylating and authorizing STX17 to associate with VAMP7), and a number of key regulators of autophagy, mTOR and AMPK ( Tables S1 B and S1C). Conversely, factors controlling fusion processes along the endosomal organelles where ATG16L1 is located (i.e., ORF3a) did not affect HyPAS formation, indicating that nsp6 domain of action is mostly within the early secretory pathway, albeit we noticed nsp6 interactions with a number of Golgi proteins ( Table S1 C).
The definition of HyPAS in this work is of significance, not only as a potential target for pharmacological intervention in COVID-19, but because of the fundamental value of understanding the formation of autophagosomes and, hence, the many physiological functions and disease states affected by autophagy.
The findings that SARS-CoV-2 nsp6 inhibits HyPAS beckon future studies to discern whether the membranes used for HyPAS are diverted by the virus for its own DMVs. Further studies are needed to rule in or out contributions of nsp3 and nsp4 to HyPAS inhibition, address nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 interactions, and investigate interactions of nsp6 with multiple components of the HyPAS apparatus. The SARS-CoV-2 effects on HyPAS invite follow-up studies of physiological consequences in infection models or in clinical studies with pharmacological agents. Technical limitations include our inability to demonstrate whether SNAP-47 works in HyPAS formation. We furthermore point out that R-SNAREs and other SNARES may act redundantly and compensate individual knockouts.

Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 500 g at 4°C, the postnuclear supernatant was collected and was equally divided into three parts, one of the samples was left untreated, and the other two were incubated with 25 μg/ml PK only in presence or absence of Triton X-100 (TX-100; 0.2%) for 10 min on ice. All samples were then subjected to TCA precipitation, and protein pellets were resuspended in the same volume of 2 x sample buffer. Approximately 40–60 μg of each sample was analyzed by immunoblotting.
Cells were infected with the indicated MOI with SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA/1/2020 (deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, NR-52281). Cell death was measured at the indicated times using the CyQUANT XTT cell viability assay (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For HCM, Calu-3 and Huh7 cells were seeded in 96 well plates and transfected with FLAG-ATG16L1 and then taken to BSL3 facility. Half of the plate was incubated in EBSS (2h). Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI:1) for 24h. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Plates were decontaminated, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin and blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min and stained with FLAG and FIP200 antibodies. HCM was performed as detailed under HCM section.
HEK293T Flp-In-nsp6 TetON cells were left in full media or incubated with EBSS for 2h. Cells were then incubated in 500 μM biotin-phenol for the last 30 min of EBSS incubation. Cells were next incubated in 1 mM H 2 O 2 at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with quenching buffer (10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide and 5 mM Trolox in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline [DPBS]). All samples were washed three times with quenching buffer, and twice with DPBS. For LC-MS/MS analysis, cell pellets were lysed in 500 μL ice-cold lysis buffer (6 M urea, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide, 5 mM Trolox, 1% glycerol and 25 mm Tris/HCl [PH 7.5]) for 30 min by gentle pipetting. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentrations were quantified. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Pierce) were washed with lysis buffer. 3 mg of each sample was mixed with 100 μL of streptavidin bead. The suspensions were gently rotated at 4°C overnight to bind biotinylated proteins. The flowthrough after enrichment was removed and the beads were washed in sequence with 1 mL IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) twice; 1 mL 1M KCl; 1 mL of 50 mM Na 2 CO 3 ; 1 mL 2 M Urea in 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8); 1 mL IP buffer. Biotinylated proteins were eluted and processed for mass spectrometry.
Protein samples on magnetic beads were washed four times with 200ul of 50mM Triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) with a twenty-minute shake time at 4°C in between each wash. Roughly 2.5 μg of trypsin was added to the bead and TEAB mixture and the samples were digested overnight at 800 rpm shake speed. After overnight digestion the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed once with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate. After 20 minutes at a gentle shake the wash is removed and combined with the initial supernatant. The peptide extracts were reduced in volume by vacuum centrifugation and a small portion of the extract was used for fluorometric peptide quantification (Thermo scientific Pierce). One microgram of sample based on the fluorometric peptide assay was loaded for each LC-MS analysis.
Peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS by trapping on a C18 peptide trapping column (Thermo Scientific) and separated on a Pepsep 8 cm x 150 um C18 column (Merslev, Denmark) using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nUPLC. Samples were run on Thermo Scientific Exploris 480 mass spectrometer for 90 min using Data independent Acquisition mode (DIA). DIA was acquired between 360-1200 Da with 45 Da non-overlapping windows. MS1 resolution was set at 120K and MS2 at 30K, MS1 normalized AGC target of 300% and MS2 1000% respectively.
DIA data was analyzed using Spectronaut 15 with directDIA workflow and default settings.
Intracellular calcium was analyzed using FLUO-3AM fluorescence on the FL-1 channel of flow cytometer (BD FACScan). Wild-type HeLa or STX17Ko cells were left unstimulated on incubated in HBSS for 2h. Cells were incubated with 5μM of FLUO-3AM for 30 min followed by analysis in a flow cytometer.
Immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) were performed as described previously( Kumar et al., 2018 80. Kumar, S. ∙ Jain, A. ∙ Farzam, F. ... Mechanism of Stx17 recruitment to autophagosomes via IRGM and mammalian Atg8 proteins J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217 :997-1013 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ). For co-IP, cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmids, wherever stated, and lysed in NP-40 buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, cat# 11697498001) and PMSF (Sigma, cat# 93482). Lysates were mixed with 5 μg antibody and incubated at 4°C for overnight followed by incubation with Dynabeads protein G (Life Technologies) for 4 h, at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with PBS and then boiled with SDS-PAGE buffer for analysis of interacting protein by immunoblotting.
Data are expressed as means ± SEM (n ≥ 3). Data were analyzed with a paired two-tailed Student’s t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was defined as † p ≥ 0.05, ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01.
