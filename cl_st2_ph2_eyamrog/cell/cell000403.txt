Title: The ZAR1 resistosome is a calcium-permeable channel triggering plant immune signaling


Abstract: Summary

Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are major immune receptors in plants and animals. Upon activation, the Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1 forms a pentameric resistosome in vitro and triggers immune responses and cell death in plants. In this study, we employed single-molecule imaging to show that the activated ZAR1 protein can form pentameric complexes in the plasma membrane. The ZAR1 resistosome displayed ion channel activity in Xenopus oocytes in a manner dependent on a conserved acidic residue Glu11 situated in the channel pore. Pre-assembled ZAR1 resistosome was readily incorporated into planar lipid-bilayers and displayed calcium-permeable cation-selective channel activity. Furthermore, we show that activation of ZAR1 in the plant cell led to Glu11-dependent Ca 2+ influx, perturbation of subcellular structures, production of reactive oxygen species, and cell death. The results thus support that the ZAR1 resistosome acts as a calcium-permeable cation channel to trigger immunity and cell death.

Section: Introduction

The plant innate immune system is composed of cell surface receptors, which perceive immunogenic molecular patterns derived from invading pathogens, and intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), which sense pathogen effectors that are delivered into the host cell intended to promote pathogenesis ( Jones et al., 2016 29.

Plant NLRs can be classified based on their variable N-terminal domains, thus those carrying a coiled coil (CC) domain are called CNLs, those carrying a Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain are referred to as TNLs, and those carrying an RPW8-like CC domain (CC R ) are called RNLs ( Jones et al., 2016 29. Jones, J.D. ∙ Vance, R.E. ∙ Dangl, J.L. Intracellular innate immune surveillance devices in plants and animals Science. 2016; 354 :aaf6395 Crossref Scopus (697) PubMed Google Scholar ). NLRs are also important innate immune receptors in animals ( Davis et al., 2011 10. Davis, B.K. ∙ Wen, H. ∙ Ting, J.P.-Y. The inflammasome NLRs in immunity, inflammation, and associated diseases Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 29 :707-735 Crossref Scopus (1322) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon activation, NLRs often form oligomeric complexes referred to as inflammasomes in animals and resistosomes in plants ( Davis et al., 2011 10. Davis, B.K. ∙ Wen, H. ∙ Ting, J.P.-Y.

Animal inflammasomes activate caspases to promote the maturation of gasdermin proteins, which form pores in the plasma membrane (PM) to trigger pyroptosis and immune responses ( Liu and Lieberman, 2020 40. Liu, X. ∙ Lieberman, J. Knocking’em dead: Pore-forming proteins in immune defense Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 38 :455-485 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). Activation of plant NLRs also leads to regulated cell death called hypersensitive response (HR), but the nature of the HR cell death and underlying mechanism remain poorly understood ( Mukhtar et al., 2016 46.

ZAR1 is a CNL with a canonical CC domain that acts both as a sensor for pathogen effectors and an executor for signaling. Importantly, ZAR1 is an ancient NLR that emerged more than 100 million years ago and is able to sense a growing number of pathogen effector proteins including HopZ1a, HopF1, HopX1, HopO1, and HopBA1 from Pseudomonas syringae tomato ( Pst ), XopJ4 from Xanthomonas perforans , and AvrAC from Xanthomonas campestris campestris ( Xcc ) ( Adachi et al., 2020 2.

ZAR1 senses diverse effector proteins by associating with a class of homologous pseudokinases called ZRKs and a second class of kinases, PBLs ( Lewis et al., 2013 38.

The decoy substrate of a pathogen effector and a pseudokinase specify pathogen-induced modified-self recognition and immunity in plants Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :285-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to pathogen infection, ZAR1 interacts with various ZRKs in the resting state. Upon pathogen delivery of effectors into the plant cell, ZRKs in the pre-formed complexes further recruit PBL proteins that have been post-translationally modified by effectors to form ternary complexes. For example, AvrAC uridylylates the Arabidopsis PBL2 protein and gives rise to PBL2 UMP , which is then recruited by RKS1/ZRK1 to form a ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2 UMP complex ( Wang et al., 2015 65. Wang, G. ∙ Roux, B. ∙ Feng, F. ... The decoy substrate of a pathogen effector and a pseudokinase specify pathogen-induced modified-self recognition and immunity in plants Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :285-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our previous structural work revealed that the activated ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2 UMP was assembled into a pentameric resistosome in vitro , with five N-terminal helices from each ZAR1 forming a funnel-shaped structure and protruding out of the wheel-defined plane. Further mutagenesis analyses suggested the funnel-shaped structure may function as a channel pore ( Hu et al., 2020 26. Hu, M. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Bi, G. ... Bacterial effectors induce oligomerization of immune receptor ZAR1 in vivo Mol. Plant. 2020; 13 :793-801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019a 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, it is not clear whether the ZAR1 oligomer also adopts a pentameric configuration in the plant cell. More importantly, the precise biochemical function of the ZAR1 resistosome remains to be elucidated. It is not clear whether the ZAR1 resistosome pore directly disrupts cellular membranes or acts as an ion channel that first triggers intracellular signaling prior to cell killing.
Here, we show that the ZAR1 resistosome possesses channel activity in Xenopus oocytes in a manner dependent on the conserved Glu11 residue in the channel pore. The pre-assembled ZAR1 resistosome is readily incorporated into planar lipid-bilayers and acts as a cation-selective channel that is permeable to Ca 2+ . Activation of ZAR1 in the plant cell triggers Glu11-depenent Ca 2+ influx. Single-molecule imaging showed that the activated ZAR1 can form pentameric resistosomes in the PM, supporting its pore-forming activity in the PM. Time-lapse live-cell imaging showed that ZAR1 activation led to Glu11-dependent production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), perturbation of organelle structures, and cell death marked by an abrupt rupture of the cell in the final stage. Together, our results suggest that the ZAR1 channel activity initiates immune signaling and cell death.

Section: Results

One of the most remarkable features of the ZAR1 resistosome is the central pore through the pentameric axis of the assembled complex ( Wang et al., 2019a 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ; PDB: 6J5T ; Figure 1 A). The pore is divided into a central cavity and an intracellular cavity, with a pronounced constriction (∼1.7 Å in radius) near the carboxylate ring of Glu134 in the middle of the ion permeation path ( Figure 1 B). Within the central cavity, other acidic residues, including Glu11, Glu18, Glu19, Asp26, Asp33, Glu37, Glu120, and Glu130, form additional carboxylate rings that line the pore and render the inner surface generally electro-negative ( Figure 1 C). This structural feature likely contributes to conducting cations across membranes. While the channel pore hypothesis agrees with a body of previous observations, direct evidence for it is still lacking.
We first determined which of these acidic residues are required for ZAR1-mediated cell death in protoplasts. Expression of ZAR1 along with RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC led to cell death in protoplasts 8–9 h after transfection ( Figure S1 A). Our previous study showed that simultaneous substitutions of Glu11 and Glu18 to Ala abolished immunity and cell death but not the oligomerization activity ( Wang et al., 2019a 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). We further substituted these residues to Gln or Asp, and the resulting ZAR1 E11Q/E18Q variant similarly abolished the death-inducing activity in protoplasts ( Figure S1 B), while ZAR1 E11D/E18D was fully functional, suggesting that acidic residues at both or either of the positions are important for function. Further analyses showed that ZAR1 E11A was abolished in cell death activity, whereas ZAR1 E18A , ZAR1 E130A , ZAR1 E134A , and ZAR1 E130A/E134A were fully capable of triggering cell death ( Figure S1 B). The results support a critical role of the Glu11 carboxylate ring in ZAR1 function.
To determine whether the activated ZAR1 protein possesses channel activity, we expressed wild-type (WT) ZAR1 along with AvrAC, RKS1, and PBL2 in Xenopus oocytes and performed two-electrode voltage clamp recording. We observed strong current traces upon application of voltage ( Figure 1 D). Because Glu11 is required for triggering cell death, we tested whether this residue plays a role in conducing current in oocytes by replacing WT ZAR1 with ZAR1 E11A , ZAR1 E11Q , or ZAR1 E11D variant. Oocytes expressing ZAR1 E11Q or ZAR1 E11A displayed markedly reduced current traces, whereas those expressing ZAR1 E11D had WT-like current traces ( Figure 1 D). A current-voltage (I-V) relationship plot supported channel activities in oocytes expressing WT ZAR1 and ZAR1 E11D ( Figure 1 E). These results demonstrate that the activated ZAR1 indeed possesses a channel activity and that the Glu11 carboxylate ring is required for this channel activity.
To better characterize the channel activity of the ZAR1 resistosome, we reconstituted the pre-assembled ZAR1 resistosome complex (pentameric ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2 UMP ) into the planar lipid bilayers and conducted single-channel measurements in symmetrical or asymmetrical solutions ( Figure 2 A). In the symmetrical solutions of 150 mM NaCl in both trans and cis chambers, the application of a series of transmembrane potentials to the trans side resulted in square step-like currents with a linear single-channel I-V relationship ( Figures 2 B and 2E), confirming that the ZAR1 resistosome forms an ion-conducting pore in the bilayer. To further examine the permeability property of the ZAR1 resistosome, single-channel recordings were carried out in asymmetrical solution, replacing 150 mM NaCl with 150 mM Na-Gluconate in the trans side. We observed similar apparent unitary currents with a linear single-channel I-V relationship ( Figures 2 C and 2E), suggesting that Na + is the permeant ion under these conditions, as gluconate is an impermeable anion, whose dimension is much larger than 3.4 Å at the narrowest constriction of the ZAR1 resistosome pore. To rule out the possibility of conducting Cl − by the ZAR1 resistosome, we replaced the trans solution with 150 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), and the recorded currents displayed a rectification characteristic, with only negative currents observed under applied voltages ranging from −60 mV to +60 mV ( Figures 2 D and 2E). The rectifying currents suggest that the ZAR1 resistosome is impermeable to chloride anions as no positive current was observed under positive voltages applied. Considering that the cis chamber (150 mM NaCl) is grounded, the negative current is composed of Na + ion flux from cis to trans side, as TEA is a large cation with a radius of 3.85 Å and is not permeable to known ion channels. Altogether, these observations demonstrate that the ZAR1 resistosome forms a channel-like pore, with selectivity for cation ions.
To further investigate ion selectivity for the ZAR1 resistosome channel, single-channel recordings were conducted under different bi-ionic conditions. The representative current traces at +60 mV or −60 mV holding potential in different chamber solutions are shown in Figure 3 A. Positive currents indicate cation flow from the trans to the cis chamber, and vice versa. Overall, the ZAR1 resistosome pore was permeable to Na + , K + , Cs + , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ but with distinctive current amplitudes ( Figure 3 B). In the bilayer, no clear preference exists for Na + flow from either direction across the ZAR1 resistosome pore in symmetrical solution of 150 mM NaCl, as evidenced by nearly identical current amplitudes at either +60 mV or −60 mV voltage. When the trans side was replaced by 150 mM KCl in the asymmetrical solution, the K + current (+60 mV) and Na + current (−60 mV) had similar amplitudes but differed in gating behaviors, which were also observed at other voltages ( Figure S2 A). In the case of 150 mM CsCl/NaCl recording, the Cs + current (+60 mV) had a lower amplitude compared to that of the Na + current (−60 mV). The recordings in MgCl 2 /NaCl and CaCl 2 /NaCl asymmetrical solution showed significantly reduced amplitudes for both Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ currents (+60 mV). Interestingly, the amplitudes of Na + currents (−60 mV) were reduced to a level much smaller than those observed in monovalent solutions ( Figure 3 B). Such phenomenon may be caused by the anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE), which also occurs in other calcium-permeable channels, such as RyR and L-type Ca 2+ channel ( Gillespie et al., 2009 16. Gillespie, D. ∙ Giri, J. ∙ Fill, M. Reinterpreting the anomalous mole fraction effect: the ryanodine receptor case study Biophys. J. 2009; 97 :2212-2221 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Friel and Tsien, 1989 14. Friel, D.D. ∙ Tsien, R.W. Voltage-gated calcium channels: direct observation of the anomalous mole fraction effect at the single-channel level Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :5207-5211 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). The precise reason for this remains unclear, but it is possible that different ions form distinctive interactions with the pore-lining residues within the ZAR1 resistosome pore. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that the ZAR1 resistosome is a cation-selective channel that is permeable to Ca 2+ .
We next asked whether the activation of ZAR1 in the plant cell leads to increased cytosolic Ca 2+ . An aequorin reporter line ( Knight et al., 1996 31. Knight, H. ∙ Trewavas, A.J. ∙ Knight, M.R. Cold calcium signaling in Arabidopsis involves two cellular pools and a change in calcium signature after acclimation Plant Cell. 1996; 8 :489-503 Crossref Scopus (753) PubMed Google Scholar ) was crossed into the zar1 mutant to generate a zar1 aequorin line. We isolated protoplasts from this line and expressed WT ZAR1 or various ZAR1 variants along with RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC or the catalytic-dead variant AvrAC H469A . Strong luminescence signals were recorded in protoplasts expressing the WT ZAR1 in the presence of AvrAC 4 h after transfection, whereas WT ZAR1 co-expressed with AvrAC H469A showed only a background-level luminescence ( Figure 3 C), indicating that the activation of ZAR1 by AvrAC is sufficient to trigger Ca 2+ influx. In contrast, protoplasts expressing ZAR1 E11A or ZAR1 E11Q in the presence of AvrAC showed only residue levels of luminescence, whereas those expressing ZAR1 E18A showed WT-like luminescence, indicating that Glu11, but not Glu18, is required for the ZAR1-mediated Ca 2+ influx. Protoplasts expressing ZAR1 E11D showed a strong luminescence indistinguishable from protoplasts expressing WT ZAR1, indicating that the Glu11 carboxylate ring is important for the ZAR1-mediated Ca 2+ influx.
To test whether the activation of ZAR1 also triggers a Ca 2+ influx in leaves during infection and whether this Ca 2+ influx requires the acidic residues, we adopted previously developed zar1 lines complemented with WT ZAR1 or ZAR1 E11 / 18A transgene ( Wang et al., 2019a 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). The former transgenic line was fully responsive to Xcc carrying avrAC and Pst hopZ1a , whereas the latter one was completely non-responsive. The aequorin reporter gene was introduced into these lines by crossing. The resulting reporter lines were then infiltrated with Pst DC3000 hopZ1a bacteria and recorded for Ca 2+ fluxes. We chose Pst hopZ1a for this experiment because Xcc is a vascular pathogen and does not allow activation of ZAR1 in mesophyll cells. The aequorin reporter line of Col-0 background showed a marked increase of cytosolic Ca 2+ ∼2 h after infiltration ( Figure 3 D). This cytosolic Ca 2+ signal peaked at ∼4 h and lasted throughout the rest of experiment. In contrast, the zar1 reporter line had only background levels of cytosolic Ca 2+ throughout the experiment. The ZAR1 -complemented reporter line was largely restored in this DC3000 HopZ1a- triggered cytosolic Ca 2+ elevation, whereas the ZAR1 E11 / 18A reporter line had a severely diminished cytosolic Ca 2+ elevation that was both delayed in time and reduced in amplitude. Combined with the normal Ca 2+ influx and cell death activities of ZAR1 E18A in protoplasts, we conclude that the defect of ZAR1 E11 / 18A is attributed to the E11A mutation. To rule out the possibility that DC3000 effectors other than HopZ1a contributed to the Ca 2+ flux, we introduced hopZ1a into an effector-less strain D36E, which is derived from DC3000 ( Wei et al., 2015 69. Wei, H.-L. ∙ Chakravarthy, S. ∙ Mathieu, J. ... Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 type III secretion effector polymutants reveal an interplay between HopAD1 and AvrPtoB Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 17 :752-762 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ), and examined Ca 2+ flux in plants. A strong Ca 2+ influx was observed in the aequorin line of the Col-0 background ( Figure S2 B), indicating that the bacterially delivered HopZ1a is sufficient for triggering the Ca 2+ influx. We similarly inoculated this reporter line with DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2 and AvrPphB, which are recognized by their cognate CNL proteins RPS2 and RPS5, respectively. These strains also induced strong Ca 2+ influxes in leaves, although the timing and amplitude varied among different strains ( Figure S2 C). D36E carrying AvrRpt2 also triggered the Ca 2+ flux ( Figure S2 B). We also treated the reporter lines used in Figure 3 D with flg22, an immunogenic peptide derived from bacterial flagellin, which is sensed by the cell surface receptor FLS2 ( Gómez-Gómez and Boller, 2000 17. Gómez-Gómez, L. ∙ Boller, T. FLS2: an LRR receptor-like kinase involved in the perception of the bacterial elicitor flagellin in Arabidopsis Mol. Cell. 2000; 5 :1003-1011 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). All lines displayed a rapid cytosolic Ca 2+ elevation within minutes ( Figure S2 D), indicating that the ZAR1 mutations did not affect Ca 2+ flux triggered by the surface receptor. The patterns of the ZAR1-, RPS2-, and RPS5-mediated Ca 2+ flux are similar to that of the RPM1-mediated Ca 2+ flux ( Grant et al., 2000 18. Grant, M. ∙ Brown, I. ∙ Adams, S. ... The RPM1 plant disease resistance gene facilitates a rapid and sustained increase in cytosolic calcium that is necessary for the oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death Plant J. 2000; 23 :441-450 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
We sought to determine whether the activated ZAR1 protein forms a pentameric complex and its subcellular localization in protoplasts by single-molecule imaging. WT ZAR1 or ZAR1 E11A fused to a monomeric EGFP (mEGFP) was co-transfected into Arabidopsis zar1 protoplasts along with RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC. For control, AvrAC H469A was used in place of AvrAC. After 5–7 h, we plated the protoplasts on a coverslip for a few minutes and then imaged the bottom surface of protoplasts using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy calibrated with single mEGFP sensitivity. Well-dispersed and diffraction-limited fluorescence spots were observed on the bottom surface of protoplasts expressing ZAR1-mEGFP ( Figure 4 A; Video S1 ). They were also observed in protoplasts expressing ZAR1 E11A and AvrAC ( Figure S3 B), or in the lanthanum chloride (LaCl 3 )-treated protoplasts ( Figure S3 C). However, motile fluorescence spots were not seen on the surface of protoplasts expressing AvrAC H469A with either ZAR1 or ZAR1 E11A ( Figures S3 A and S3B; Video S2 ), confirming that AvrAC uridylyl transferase activity was required for the formation of the ZAR1 spots. These spots moved laterally and in all directions, as revealed by the single-molecule tracking ( Figures 4 A and S4 A), resembling the diffusion activities of membrane proteins in the PM of living plant cells ( Hink et al., 2008 25. Hink, M.A. ∙ Shah, K. ∙ Russinova, E. ...

Single-molecule analysis of PIP2;1 dynamics and partitioning reveals multiple modes of Arabidopsis plasma membrane aquaporin regulation Plant Cell. 2011; 23 :3780-3797 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trajectories of individual ZAR1-mEGFP spots were further subjected to mean square displacement (MSD) analysis for the evaluation of mobility and diffusion ( Qian et al., 1991 51. Qian, H. ∙ Sheetz, M.P. ∙ Elson, E.L. Single particle tracking. Analysis of diffusion and flow in two-dimensional systems Biophys. J. 1991; 60 :910-921 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (947) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tarantino et al., 2014 60. Tarantino, N. ∙ Tinevez, J.-Y. ∙ Crowell, E.F. ... TNF and IL-1 exhibit distinct ubiquitin requirements for inducing NEMO-IKK supramolecular structures J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204 :231-245 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). The majority of ZAR1-mEGFP spots showed a heterogeneous but mostly mobile normal diffusion ( Figures 4 B, S4 A, and S4B). By analyzing the fluorescence intensity distribution of these ZAR1-mEGFP clusters calibrated using the fluorescence of purified monomeric mEGFP, we found that they were oligomers with the majority containing around five molecules ( Figure 4 C). Thus, the quantitative single-molecule imaging approach provided direct evidence that the AvrAC-induced ZAR1 complex indeed formed pentamers in living protoplasts.

ZAR1-mEGFP signal at the bottom surface of a protoplast expressing AvrAC H469A imaged every 1 s by TIRF microscopy, related to Figure 4
In order to track the source of the ZAR1 oligomers observed in protoplasts, we photobleached the existing GFP fluorescence on the bottom surface of the protoplast using continuous TIRF illumination and imaged again by TIRF microscopy. Interestingly, reappearance of ZAR1 oligomers from the bottom surface was rare. Instead, they appeared from the edge and then diffused laterally to the bottom area of the protoplast from the non-bleached area above the bottom surface ( Figure 5 A), and this is consistent with the recovery and diffusion dynamics of known PM proteins ( Video S3 ) ( Ghosh et al., 2014 15.

These dynamic diffusion behaviors of ZAR1 oligomers suggested that they associated with the PM and diffused laterally on the inner surface of the PM and were less likely associated with intracellular structures such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

ZAR1 E11A -mEGFP (green) and PIP2;1-mCherry (magenta) signal at the bottom surface of a protoplast expressing AvrAC imaged every 1 s by TIRF microscopy, related to Figure 5
To further determine whether the ZAR1 resistosome can be localized in the PM, we included an mCherry-tagged water channel protein PIP2;1 as a PM resident protein and an RFP-tagged ER marker HDEL in TIRF imaging ( Nelson et al., 2007 48. Nelson, B.K. ∙ Cai, X. ∙ Nebenführ, A. A multicolored set of in vivo organelle markers for co-localization studies in Arabidopsis and other plants Plant J. 2007; 51 :1126-1136 Crossref Scopus (1635) PubMed Google Scholar ). We primarily examined the localization of the ZAR1 E11A to circumvent interference from cell death caused by the WT ZAR1. In the presence of AvrAC, ZAR1 E11A -mEGFP formed oligomers at the bottom surface and displayed similar dynamic movement as the PIP2;1-mCherry signal ( Figure 5 B, left panel; Video S3 ), suggesting that the ZAR1 resistosome can be located in the PM. ZAR1 E11A -mEGFP oligomers were largely absent from the ER ( Figure 5 B, right panel). The ZAR1-mEGFP signal in the presence of AvrAC also had a similar distribution as PIP2;1-mCherry ( Figure S4 D). We thus conclude that the ZAR1 resistosome can be localized in the PM but not the ER.
The data presented above show that the ZAR1-triggered cell death is analogous to pyroptosis and necroptosis in animals in that they are all initiated by pore-forming proteins. To better understand the cell death process triggered by ZAR1, we used a live/dead stain combination of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) to characterize the death of mesophyll cells in leaves that had been inoculated with DC3000 hopZ1a bacteria by live-cell imaging. The death of individual mesophyll cells occurred in a rapid succession of cellular events ( Figure 6 A; Video S4 ). FDA-derived fluorescein was initially confined to the cytoplasm of live cells, indicating an intact PM. At 3.5 h after bacterial inoculation, the FDA signal attenuated and PI entered into cells, suggesting a loss of PM integrity. Next, cytoplasmic streaming and chloroplast movement declined and eventually stopped. The process was terminated by an abrupt disintegration of nuclei and cell collapse ( Figure 6 A; Video S4 ). These changes occurred in a time frame of ∼10 min, although in some protoplasts they could last for 1 h. Animal cells undergoing necroptosis osmotically swell and eventually explode, whereas cells undergoing pyroptosis develop blebbing protrusions of the PM called pyroptotic bodies before cell rupture ( Chen et al., 2016 8. Chen, X. ∙ He, W.T. ∙ Hu, L. ... Pyroptosis is driven by non-selective gasdermin-D pore and its morphology is different from MLKL channel-mediated necroptosis Cell Res. 2016; 26 :1007-1020 Crossref Scopus (539) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shi et al., 2015 58.

We observed neither cell swelling nor PM protrusion in the aforementioned experiments. However, plant cells possess a cell wall, which may hamper the observation of these potential changes.

Pst hopZ1a triggered death of mesophyll cells stained by FDA (green) and PI (magenta) and imaged by spinning-disk confocal microscopy, related to Figure 6
To better resolve subcellular alterations during the ZAR1-triggered cell death, we investigated the dynamic process of the ZAR1-induced death of protoplasts. Time-lapse live-cell imaging was employed to monitor the process in detail. Because the protoplast death occurred between 8 and 9 h after transfection ( Figure S1 A), we focused on the 6–9 h window. Six hours after transfection, protoplasts expressing ZAR1, RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC were stained with SYTOX Red, which, like PI, also stains cells that have lost PM integrity. We collected fluorescence images continuously (every 30 s) to identify cells penetrated by SYTOX Red. The autofluorescence from chloroplasts was also collected to show overall morphology of protoplasts as well as distributions of chloroplasts. Brightfield images were then collected at 30–60 min intervals to capture morphological changes during the ZAR1-mediated death. Like the DC3000 hopZ1a- induced death of mesophyll cells, SYTOX Red staining occurred in the final stages of imaging and lasted ∼10 min ( Figures 6 B and S5 B). The dying protoplast was terminated by a sudden rupture as seen during necroptosis. SYTOX Red staining and protoplast rupture were absent in protoplasts expressing AvrAC H469A ( Figure S5 C). Similar results were obtained when fluorescence images were collected every 30–40 min and brightfield images collected continuously (every 30 s) between fluorescence images ( Figure S5 A), indicating that the observed cell death was not caused by prolonged laser exposure. Neither swelling nor PM protrusion was ever observed in any of these protoplasts during the entire process ( Figure 6 B, S5 A, and S5B).
Interestingly, SYTOX Red signal appeared initially in individual chloroplasts, followed by continuous uptake and staining of more chloroplasts, and eventually the staining of the whole protoplast before rupture ( Figures 6 B, S5 A, and S5B; Video S5 ), suggesting that chloroplasts were damaged prior to cell rupture. We next sought to explore the possibility that ZAR1 activation may first induce subcellular processes prior to PM damage. Protoplasts prepared from a transgenic line carrying a GFP-tagged vacuole marker protein VHP1 ( Segami et al., 2014 56. Segami, S. ∙ Makino, S. ∙ Miyake, A. ... Dynamics of vacuoles and H + -pyrophosphatase visualized by monomeric green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis: artifactual bulbs and native intravacuolar spherical structures Plant Cell. 2014; 26 :3416-3434 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ) were transfected with ZAR1, RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC/AvrAC H469A and stained with SYTOX Red. Compared to AvrAC H469A -expressing protoplasts, many AvrAC-expressing protoplasts had vacuoles with weak VHP1-GFP signals and altered overall structures ( Figures 6 C and S6 ; Video S6 ). Their continuous membrane structures seem to be interrupted in these protoplasts. These morphological changes were widely observed in protoplasts 6.5 h after transfection ( Figure S6 C). Time-lapse imaging showed that these protoplasts were destined to die as indicated by the incorporation of SYTOX Red ( Figures 6 C and S6 B).

HR cell death is associated with the production of ROS ( Levine et al., 1994 34. Levine, A. ∙ Tenhaken, R. ∙ Dixon, R. ... H 2 O 2 from the oxidative burst orchestrates the plant hypersensitive disease resistance response Cell. 1994; 79 :583-593 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2334) PubMed Google Scholar ). We stained protoplasts with H 2 DCFDA for the detection of ROS production and PI for PM integrity and tracked the process by live-cell imaging ( Figures 7 A–7C). Protoplasts expressing the WT ZAR1 along with RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC showed continuous increase of ROS levels prior to PI staining, whereas protoplasts expressing ZAR1, RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC H469A showed an absence of PI staining and relatively flat ROS levels throughout the experiment ( Figure 7 D). Similar results were also observed with protoplasts expressing ZAR1 E11A along with RKS1, PBL2, and AvrAC. Thus, the aforementioned results suggested that the cell death is preceded by a perturbation of organelle hemostasis and ZAR1 channel-dependent ROS production, followed by a loss of PM integrity.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we show that the ZAR1 resistosome possesses a calcium-permeable cation channel activity in the absence of any other proteins, confirming previous hypothesis ( Burdett et al., 2019 5. Burdett, H. ∙ Bentham, A.R. ∙ Williams, S.J. ... The plant “resistosome”: Structural insights into immune signaling Cell Host Microbe. 2019; 26 :193-201 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019a 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). This also confirms that the funnel-shaped structure formed by the N-terminal α1 helix is sufficient to penetrate the lipid bilayer, which is consistent with previous finding that a 20 amino acid antimicrobial peptide of alamethicin can form an ion channel ( Hall et al., 1984 19. Hall, J.E. ∙ Vodyanoy, I. ∙ Balasubramanian, T.M. ... Alamethicin. A rich model for channel behavior Biophys. J. 1984; 45 :233-247 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (267) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ZAR1 channel activity requires the conserved Glu11 residue, which is consistent with a role of the carboxylate ring in conducting cations. We further show that the ZAR1 oligomer can be located in the PM and adopts a pentameric configuration, confirming that the activated ZAR1 indeed can form a resistosome pore in the PM. The PM localization of the ZAR1 resistosome is consistent with the myristoylation-mediated PM localization of HopZ1a that activates ZAR1 ( Lewis et al., 2008 36. Lewis, J.D. ∙ Abada, W. ∙ Ma, W. ... The HopZ family of Pseudomonas syringae type III effectors require myristoylation for virulence and avirulence functions in Arabidopsis thaliana J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190 :2880-2891 Crossref Scopus (81) PubMed Google Scholar ). AvrAC also possesses a putative myristoylation motif that likely anchors this effector to the PM. α1 of ZAR1 is conserved and functionally interchangeable among a sub-class of CNLs existing in diverse plant species ( Adachi et al., 2019 1. Adachi, H. ∙ Contreras, M.P. ∙ Harant, A. ... An N-terminal motif in NLR immune receptors is functionally conserved across distantly related plant species eLife. 2019; 8 :e49956 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the ZAR1 CC domain and RNL CC R domain adopt a similar fold to the pore-forming segment of MLKL ( Bentham et al., 2018 4. Bentham, A.R. ∙ Zdrzałek, R. ∙ De la Concepcion, J.C. ... Uncoiling CNLs: Structure/function approaches to understanding CC domain function in plant NLRs Plant Cell Physiol. 2018; 59 :2398-2408 PubMed Google Scholar ; Jubic et al., 2019 30. Jubic, L.M. ∙ Saile, S. ∙ Furzer, O.J. ... Help wanted: helper NLRs and plant immune responses Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2019; 50 :82-94 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, a very recent study reported that mutation-triggered oligomerization of RNLs NRG1 and ADR1 can lead to Ca 2+ influx in HeLa cells ( Jacob et al., 2021 27. Jacob, P.M. ∙ Kim, N.H. ∙ Wu, F. ... The plant immune receptors NRG1.1 and ADR1 are calcium influx channels bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, a resistosome channel model is likely to apply to many plant NLRs.
Ca 2+ is a master regulator of plant immunity ( Tian et al., 2020 63. Tian, W. ∙ Wang, C. ∙ Gao, Q. ... Calcium spikes, waves and oscillations in plant development and biotic interactions Nat. Plants. 2020; 6 :750-759 Crossref Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Several Ca 2+ permeable channels have been shown to conduct Ca 2+ currents and mediate immune responses by surface immune receptors ( Tian et al., 2019 62. Tian, W. ∙ Hou, C. ∙ Ren, Z. ... A calmodulin-gated calcium channel links pathogen patterns to plant immunity Nature. 2019; 572 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2019b 67. Wang, J. ∙ Liu, X. ∙ Zhang, A. ... A cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mediates cytoplasmic calcium elevation and disease resistance in rice Cell Res. 2019; 29 :820-831 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Thor et al., 2020 61. Thor, K. ∙ Jiang, S. ∙ Michard, E. ... The calcium-permeable channel OSCA1.3 regulates plant stomatal immunity Nature. 2020; 585 :569-573 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, none of these channels have an established role in conducting Ca 2+ currents during NLR-mediated immunity. Our work adds a new type of Ca 2+ -permeable channel to the list of Ca 2+ -permeable channels that function in plant immunity. The ZAR1 resistosome channel is permeable to a variety of monovalent and divalent cations tested including Na + , K + , Cs + , Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ . This property is shared by the majority of calcium channels in plants that show permeability to both mono- and divalent cations with low selectivity ( Demidchik et al., 2018 11. Demidchik, V. ∙ Shabala, S. ∙ Isayenkov, S. ... Calcium transport across plant membranes: mechanisms and functions New Phytol. 2018; 220 :49-69 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). The possibility that the ZAR1 resistosome is a calcium channel is consistent with the Glu11-dependent Ca 2+ influx in plant cells upon ZAR1 activation in the absence of bacterial infection. In addition to Glu11, other negative charged residues in the channel cavity likely also contribute to the cation-selectivity, a possibility to be determined in the future.
Our time-lapse live-cell imaging analyses showed that during the final stages of the ZAR1-mediated death, the PM loses integrity in a relatively short time frame and the cell is then terminated by an abrupt rupture. An ion channel-triggered cell death following ZAR1 activation is reminiscent of necroptosis triggered by the MLKL pore, which also appears to be a cation channel ( Xia et al., 2016 71. Xia, B. ∙ Fang, S. ∙ Chen, X. ... MLKL forms cation channels Cell Res. 2016; 26 :517-528 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). The MLKL channel activity is postulated to induce osmotic swelling of the cell, which eventually bursts ( Zhang et al., 2018 75. Zhang, Y. ∙ Chen, X. ∙ Gueydan, C. ... Plasma membrane changes during programmed cell deaths Cell Res. 2018; 28 :9-21 Crossref Scopus (649) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the activation of ZAR1 did not cause any measurable swelling of protoplasts. Animal cells undergoing pyroptosis form pyroptotic bodies ( Ruan et al., 2018 52. Ruan, J. ∙ Xia, S. ∙ Liu, X. ... Cryo-EM structure of the gasdermin A3 membrane pore Nature. 2018; 557 :62-67 Crossref Scopus (273) PubMed Google Scholar ). No pyroptotic body-like structure was observed in the ZAR1-mediated cell death. How and to what extent the HR cell death is different from necroptosis and pyroptosis requires further investigation.
Ca 2+ influx is one of the earliest cellular responses and is essential for NLR-mediated plant immune signaling and HR cell death ( Grant et al., 2000 18. Grant, M. ∙ Brown, I. ∙ Adams, S. ... The RPM1 plant disease resistance gene facilitates a rapid and sustained increase in cytosolic calcium that is necessary for the oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death Plant J. 2000; 23 :441-450 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Lecourieux et al., 2006 33. Lecourieux, D. ∙ Ranjeva, R. ∙ Pugin, A. Calcium in plant defence-signalling pathways New Phytol. 2006; 171 :249-269 Crossref Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ; Levine et al., 1996 35.

Biol. 1996; 6 :427-437 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (501) PubMed Google Scholar ). The ZAR1- and RPM1-dependent Ca 2+ influxes occur within ∼2 h after bacterial inoculations, which coincide with the time Pst secretes effectors ( Grant et al., 2000 18. Grant, M. ∙ Brown, I. ∙ Adams, S. ... The RPM1 plant disease resistance gene facilitates a rapid and sustained increase in cytosolic calcium that is necessary for the oxidative burst and hypersensitive cell death Plant J. 2000; 23 :441-450 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Schechter et al., 2004 53. Schechter, L.M. ∙ Roberts, K.A. ∙ Jamir, Y. ... Pseudomonas syringae type III secretion system targeting signals and novel effectors studied with a Cya translocation reporter J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186 :543-555 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that Ca 2+ influx is an immediate early event upon effector delivery. Increased cytosolic Ca 2+ also occurred in leaves inoculated with Pst strains carrying AvrRpt2 and AvrPphB, suggesting that this rapid Ca 2+ flux is a common feature upon CNL activation. Ca 2+ influx as a trigger of cell death is also consistent with recent findings that mis-regulated Ca 2+ accumulation can cause HR cell death and auto-immunity ( Yu et al., 2019 73. Yu, X. ∙ Xu, G. ∙ Li, B. ... The receptor kinases BAK1/SERK4 regulate Ca 2+ channel-mediated cellular homeostasis for cell death containment Curr. Biol. 2019; 29 :3778-3790.e8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). We show that a direct disruption of the PM by the ZAR1 resistosome pore is an unlikely mechanism of the HR cell death, as the ZAR1 resistosome forms in the PM hours before the PM loses integrity. Instead, existing data suggest that the channel activity of ZAR1 is required for the cell death, as supported by the apparent requirement of Glu11 for the ZAR1-mediated Ca 2+ influx and cell death. Likewise, the channel blocker LaCl 3 impairs cell death but does not affect resistosome assembly ( Hu et al., 2020 26. Hu, M. ∙ Qi, J. ∙ Bi, G. ... Bacterial effectors induce oligomerization of immune receptor ZAR1 in vivo Mol. Plant. 2020; 13 :793-801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). A very recent study also suggests that oligomerized NRG1 and ADR1 proteins trigger cell death in a manner dependent on Ca 2+ influx ( Jacob et al., 2021 27. Jacob, P.M. ∙ Kim, N.H. ∙ Wu, F. ... The plant immune receptors NRG1.1 and ADR1 are calcium influx channels bioRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A requirement of channel activity for cell death is also consistent with the observations that intracellular alterations occur in ZAR1-activated protoplasts prior to a loss of the PM integrity. Early studies indicated an association of HR cell death with a number of events such as ROS production, cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial swelling, chloroplast disruption, and vacuolization ( Mur et al., 2008 47. Mur, L.A. ∙ Kenton, P. ∙ Lloyd, A.J. ... The hypersensitive response; the centenary is upon us but how much do we know? J. Exp. Bot. 2008; 59 :501-520 Crossref Scopus (537) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the AvrAC-triggered, ZAR1-dependent death occurred 8–9 h after transfection, marked alterations of vacuolar structures were observed at ∼6 h. In fact, a role of vacuole in regulated cell death is well-known ( Hara-Nishimura and Hatsugai, 2011 20. Hara-Nishimura, I. ∙ Hatsugai, N. The role of vacuole in plant cell death Cell Death Differ. 2011; 18 :1298-1304 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar , Hatsugai et al., 2015 23. Hatsugai, N. ∙ Yamada, K. ∙ Goto-Yamada, S. ... Vacuolar processing enzyme in plant programmed cell death Front. Plant Sci. 2015; 6 :234 Crossref Scopus (156) PubMed Google Scholar ). It has been reported that activation of the Arabidopsis NLR proteins RPM1 and RPS2 by Pst avrRpm1 and Pst avrRpt2 induces fusion of the central vacuole with the PM 3–6 h after infection ( Hatsugai et al., 2009 22. Hatsugai, N. ∙ Iwasaki, S. ∙ Tamura, K. ... A novel membrane fusion-mediated plant immunity against bacterial pathogens Genes Dev. 2009; 23 :2496-2506 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, activation of the NLR protein N by TMV leads to vacuole disruption, and the release of the vacuolar protease VPE1 has been attributed to the HR ( Hatsugai et al., 2004 21. Hatsugai, N. ∙ Kuroyanagi, M. ∙ Yamada, K. ... A plant vacuolar protease, VPE, mediates virus-induced hypersensitive cell death Science. 2004; 305 :855-858 Crossref Scopus (515) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, we show that ROS production, loss of PM integrity, and eventual HR cell death all required Glu11, highlighting a critical role of the ZAR1 channel activity in the execution of downstream signaling events leading to cell death and immunity.
We show that single-molecule imaging is a powerful approach to studying the assembly of resistosomes in the plant cell. It should be noted, however, that the analysis relied on transient overexpression of the host components and pathogen effector. The future challenge will be to determine whether the native ZAR1 protein displays the same dynamics during pathogen infection. Another limitation of the study is with the cell death analysis. While it is clear that the ZAR1 channel activity and calcium flux are required for cell death triggering, the direct executor of cell death remains elusive and will require future studies.

Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 expressing aequorin ( Knight et al., 1996 31. Knight, H. ∙ Trewavas, A.J. ∙ Knight, M.R. Cold calcium signaling in Arabidopsis involves two cellular pools and a change in calcium signature after acclimation Plant Cell. 1996; 8 :489-503 Crossref Scopus (753) PubMed Google Scholar ) were crossed with zar1 or zar1 mutant plants complemented with ZAR1 or ZAR1 E11/18A ( Wang et al., 2015 65.

VHP1-GFP transgenic plants were used to examine vacuole structures during cell death in this study ( Segami et al., 2014 56. Segami, S. ∙ Makino, S. ∙ Miyake, A. ... Dynamics of vacuoles and H + -pyrophosphatase visualized by monomeric green fluorescent protein in Arabidopsis: artifactual bulbs and native intravacuolar spherical structures Plant Cell. 2014; 26 :3416-3434 Crossref Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Homozygosity of these transgenic plants was selected by PCR-based genotyping. Arabidopsis plants were grown in soil at 23°C a 10/14-h light/dark photoperiod for 4 to 5 weeks.
Pst DC3000 or D36E bacteria ( Wei et al., 2015 69. Wei, H.-L. ∙ Chakravarthy, S. ∙ Mathieu, J. ...

Constructs for AvrAC, PBL2, RKS1, and ZAR1 used in this study have been reported previously ( Wang et al., 2015 65. Wang, G. ∙ Roux, B. ∙ Feng, F. ... The decoy substrate of a pathogen effector and a pseudokinase specify pathogen-induced modified-self recognition and immunity in plants Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18 :285-295 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). To generate ZAR1-mEGFP and ZAR1 E11A -mEGFP constructs for protoplast transfection, cDNA of ZAR1 and ZAR1 E11A fused with an xten linker (aagtccggcagcgagacgccaggcacctccgagagcgctacgcctgaa) and a C-terminal mEGFP ( Zacharias et al., 2002 74. Zacharias, D.A. ∙ Violin, J.D. ∙ Newton, A.C. ... Partitioning of lipid-modified monomeric GFPs into membrane microdomains of live cells Science. 2002; 296 :913-916 Crossref Scopus (1854) PubMed Google Scholar ) was cloned into pUC19-35S-RBS using a ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit (no. C113; Vazyme Biotech). To generate constructs for transient expression in Xenopus oocytes, coding sequences of desired genes are amplified by PCR and cloned into the pGEMHE2. Mutant plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. To generate PIP2;1-mCherry construct, the cDNA fragments of PIP2;1 from Col-0 and the coding sequence of mCherry were PCR-amplified and inserted into pUC19-35S-RBS ( Nelson et al., 2007 48. Nelson, B.K. ∙ Cai, X. ∙ Nebenführ, A. A multicolored set of in vivo organelle markers for co-localization studies in Arabidopsis and other plants Plant J. 2007; 51 :1126-1136 Crossref Scopus (1635) PubMed Google Scholar ). HDEL-RFP is an ER signal peptide fused with RFP ( Nelson et al., 2007 48. Nelson, B.K. ∙ Cai, X. ∙ Nebenführ, A. A multicolored set of in vivo organelle markers for co-localization studies in Arabidopsis and other plants Plant J. 2007; 51 :1126-1136 Crossref Scopus (1635) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Protoplasts from zar1 mutant plants expressing desired constructs were incubated for indicated times, and cell viability was measured by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G7570) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence counts were recorded by the EnSpire Multimode plate Reader (Perkin Elmer), and percentage of cell survival was calculated. Cell viability at 2 h was assigned 100%.
The two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were conducted as previously described ( Chen et al., 2010 7. Chen, Y.H. ∙ Hu, L. ∙ Punta, M. ... Homologue structure of the SLAC1 anion channel for closing stomata in leaves Nature. 2010; 467 :1074-1080 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, all genes for ZAR1 resistosome assembly, including ZAR1 WT and mutant variants (E11D, E11Q, E11A), RKS1, PBL2 and AvrAC, were cloned into plasmid pGHME2 for expression in Xenopus oocytes. Linearized plasmids were used to generate cRNAs using T7 polymerase. Both the injection amount of cRNA and the oocyte incubation time were optimized, due to the toxicity caused by the assembled ZAR1 resistosome. One nanogram of cRNA of each construct ZAR1 (WT or mutants), RKS1, PBL2 and AvrAC, were co-injected into isolated oocytes. Oocytes were then incubated at 18°C for ∼10 h in ND96 buffer (1.8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2,5 mM KCl, 96 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES/Tris, pH = 7.5).
Using an Oocyte Clamp OC-725C amplifier (Warner Instruments) and a Digidata 1550 B low-noise data acquisition system with pClamp software (Molecular Devices), two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed in the same ND96 buffer that used for oocyte incubation. The microelectrode solutions contained 3 M KCl and the bath electrode was a 3 M KCl agar bridge. Voltage-clamp currents were measured in response to 7.5 s-long voltage steps to test potentials that ranged from −130 mV to 50 mV in 20 mV increments. Prior to each voltage step the membrane was held at 0 mV for 1.60 s, and following each voltage step the membrane was returned to 0 mV for 2.0 s. I–V relationship for ZAR1 resistosome channels was generated from currents measured 0.2 s before the end of each test voltage step. Three independent batches of oocytes were investigated and showed consistent findings. Data from one representative oocyte batch are shown.
Lipid bilayer experiments were conducted as previously described in our study of TRIC channel ( Wang et al., 2019c 68. Wang, X.H. ∙ Su, M. ∙ Gao, F. ... Structural basis for activity of TRIC counter-ion channels in calcium release Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :4238-4243 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The full complex of ZAR1-RKS1-PBL2 UMP was assembled and purified as previously described ( Wang et al., 2019a 66. Wang, J. ∙ Hu, M. ∙ Wang, J. ... Reconstitution and structure of a plant NLR resistosome conferring immunity Science. 2019; 364 :eaav5870 Crossref Scopus (461) PubMed Google Scholar ). Purified ZAR1 resistosome, at a concentration of 0.1∼0.2 μg/mL, was fused from the cis chamber into planar lipid bilayers formed by painting a lipid mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a 5:3 ratio in decane across a 200 mm hole in a polystyrene partition separating the internal and external solutions in polysulfonate cups (Warner Instruments). The trans chamber (1.0 mL), representing the extracellular compartment, was connected to the head stage input of a bilayer voltage clamp amplifier. The cis chamber (1.0 mL), representing the cytoplasmic compartment, was held at virtual ground. Solutions used for I–V relationship analysis or cation/anion permeability detection were as follows: 150 mM NaCl in cis chamber; 150 mM Na-Gluconate or 150 mM TEA-Cl in trans chamber.
For ion selectivity experiments, the trans-side was changed to either 150 mM XCl (KCl, or CsCl) or 75 mM YCl 2 (CaCl 2 or MgCl 2 ). All solutions were buffered with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0). Purified proteins were added to the cis side and fused with the lipid bilayer. Currents were recorded every 1∼2 min after application of the voltage to the trans side. Single-channel currents were recorded using a Bilayer Clamp BC-525D (Warner Instruments), filtered at 800 Hz using a Low-Pass Bessel Filter 8 Pole (Warner Instruments) and digitized at 4 kHz. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23 ± 2°C). The recordings were analyzed by using Clampfit 10.6 (Molecular Devices) and Prism (ver.5.0, GraphPad).
To measure Ca 2+ influx induced by incompatible bacterium, 4- to 5-week-old Arabidopsis plants were infiltrated with Pst DC3000 or D36E bacteria carrying desired effector genes at a concentration of 1 × 10 8 CFU/mL supplemented with 10 μM coelenterazine. Then leaf discs of 4 mm in diameter were punched and placed in 96-well plates containing 100 μL of 10 μM coelenterazine. Luminescence counts was recorded at 180-s intervals by EnSpire Multimode plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). To measure flg22-induced Ca 2+ influx, leaf discs were punched and incubated in 96-well plates containing 100 μl of 10 μM coelenterazine for 6 h in the darkness. Luminescence counts were recorded at 3-s intervals after the injection of 1 μM flg22. To measure ZAR1-triggered Ca 2+ influx in plant cells, protoplasts of zar1 plants expressing aequorin were transfected with indicated plasmids, recovered for 1 h, and then incubated with 100 μL of 10 μM coelenterazine for 1 h in the darkness. Luminescence counts were then recorded at 600-s intervals. To calculate luminescence values of the remaining aequorin, 100 μL of discharging buffer (2 M CaCl 2 and 20% ethanol) was added, and the immune-induced luminescence relative to total luminescence (L/Ltotal) was used to indicate the increase of cytosolic Ca 2+ as previously described ( Tian et al., 2019 62. Tian, W. ∙ Hou, C. ∙ Ren, Z. ... A calmodulin-gated calcium channel links pathogen patterns to plant immunity Nature. 2019; 572 :131-135 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The TIRF microscopy system was based on a Nikon TIE microscope equipped with a CFI Apochromat TIRF 100X objective (1.49 NA, Nikon), a motorized TIRF Illuminator Unit (Nikon), a Perfect Focus Unit (Nikon), a UNO stage top incubator (Okolab), OBIS CellX 405, 488, 561 and 637 nm lasers (4 × 100 mW, Coherent), a W-VIEW GEMINI image splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor Technology). The 1.5 × tube lens equipped on the Nikon TIE microscope was switched on for single-molecule imaging experiments, which provided a final pixel size corresponding to 86.7 nm of image. Imaging sequences were acquired by Micro-Manager ( Edelstein et al., 2010 12. Edelstein, A. ∙ Amodaj, N. ∙ Hoover, K. ... Computer control of microscopes using μManager Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2010; Crossref Scopus (1152) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Protoplasts from zar1 mutant plants were isolated and transfected with the indicated plasmids as described ( Yoo et al., 2007 72. Yoo, S.-D. ∙ Cho, Y.-H. ∙ Sheen, J. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts: a versatile cell system for transient gene expression analysis Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2 :1565-1572 Crossref Scopus (3728) PubMed Google Scholar ) and incubated for 6 to 8 h or otherwise indicated times. The protoplasts were then spun down briefly for 2 min at 200 g. The supernatant was removed and the protoplasts were plated in the center of a 25 mm round glass coverslip (#1.5; Warner Instruments) mounted on an Attofluor Cell Chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The coverslip was then covered with a 12 mm round glass coverslip (#1.5; Warner Instruments). The sample was then moved to the microscope, placed in the stage top incubator, and waited for 3 to 5 min to let the protoplasts attach and spread on the coverslip. The protoplasts were imaged every 1 s (exposure time 100 ms) for 60 s to 300 s using TIRF illumination. The samples were imaged for 30 min and then replaced with a fresh sample.
The spinning-disk confocal microscopy system was based on a Nikon TIE microscope equipped with a CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda 60X Oil objective (1.40 NA, Nikon) and a 20X objective (0.75 NA, Nikon), OBIS 488 nm LS 150 mW, 561 nm LS 150 mW and 647 nm LX 120 mW lasers (Coherent), a CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal unit (Yokogawa), a fully enclosed and environmentally controlled cage incubator (Okolab), and an EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra 888, Andor Technology). Imaging sequences were acquired by Micro-Manager ( Edelstein et al., 2010 12. Edelstein, A. ∙ Amodaj, N. ∙ Hoover, K. ... Computer control of microscopes using μManager Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol. 2010; Crossref Scopus (1152) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To track the dynamic process of ZAR1-triggered cell death, protoplasts were transfected with different plasmids for 6 h and then incubated with 100 ng/mL of SYTOX™ Red Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 100 ng/mL PI (Sigma). The protoplasts in culture medium were then moved to a 35 mm glass bottom dish (#1.5; Cellvis), filled with 2 mL medium, and imaged by the spinning-disk confocal microscopy. The autofluorescence in protoplasts without GFP expression was excited by the 488-nm laser and the signal was collected to indicate the morphology of chloroplasts as well as the whole protoplasts. The protoplasts were imaged every 30 s (exposure time 100 ms) for 30 min to several h for time-lapse videos. The generation of montages, measurement of cell areas, measurement of fluorescence intensities, reversing the LUT of images, and merge of channels were done by Fiji.
Plant leaves were infiltration with Pst DC3000 hopZ1a at a concentration of 1 × 10 8 CFU/mL and detached at 2 h after inoculation. The lower epidermis were peeled from rosette leaves. Then mesophyll cells were incubated with staining solution containing 20 ng/mL FDA and 100 ng/mL PI for 0.5 h and imaged with PerkinElmer UltraView Vox spinning disk microscope equipped with a 60X (1.42 NA) objective. FDA was excited with the 488-nm laser, and the emission was detected between 495 and 545 nm. PI was excited with a 561-nm laser and detected between 580 and 680 nm. Images were collected at 5-min intervals and processed using the Zen software.
For single-molecule imaging analyses, detection and tracking of ZAR1-mEGFP spots for motion analysis was performed by the TrackMate plugin in Fiji ( Tinevez et al., 2017 64. Tinevez, J.Y. ∙ Perry, N. ∙ Schindelin, J. ... TrackMate: An open and extensible platform for single-particle tracking Methods. 2017; 115 :80-90 Crossref Scopus (1800) PubMed Google Scholar ). The linking max distance, the gap-closing max distance and max frame gap were 15, 12 and 4 pixels (86.7 nm per pixel) for the LAP tracker. Mean square displacement (MSD) and diffusion coefficients ( D ) analysis were performed using the msdanalyzer package ( Tarantino et al., 2014 60. Tarantino, N. ∙ Tinevez, J.-Y. ∙ Crowell, E.F. ... TNF and IL-1 exhibit distinct ubiquitin requirements for inducing NEMO-IKK supramolecular structures J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204 :231-245 Crossref Scopus (304) PubMed Google Scholar ). The tracks longer than 20 frames were used for MSD analysis as described ( Calebiro et al., 2013 6. Calebiro, D. ∙ Rieken, F. ∙ Wagner, J. ... Single-molecule analysis of fluorescently labeled G-protein-coupled receptors reveals complexes with distinct dynamics and organization Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :743-748 Crossref Scopus (362) PubMed Google Scholar ). Diffusion coefficients were calculated according to the equation MSD = 4 D Δt using the first five spots in the MSD-Δt curves. Curves with goodness of liner fit (R 2 ) > 0.8 were used for the estimation of mean diffusion coefficient.
Single mEGFP molecule calibration and counting of the ZAR1-mEGFP oligomers were performed as described previously ( Cocucci et al., 2012 9. Cocucci, E. ∙ Aguet, F. ∙ Boulant, S. ... The first five seconds in the life of a clathrin-coated pit Cell. 2012; 150 :495-507 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (277) PubMed Google Scholar ; He et al., 2020 24. He, K. ∙ Song, E. ∙ Upadhyayula, S. ... Dynamics of Auxilin 1 and GAK in clathrin-mediated traffic J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219 :e201908142 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, recombinant mEGFP made from E. coli was diluted in PBS, plated on a 25 mm round glass coverslip for 5 min, washed gently for 3 times with PBS and then imaged using the 488 nm laser (same laser power, exposure time and TIRF angle as the imaging experiments). The single mEGFP molecules were detected by the cmeAnalysis software package using MATLAB (MathWorks) ( Aguet et al., 2013 3. Aguet, F. ∙ Antonescu, C.N. ∙ Mettlen, M. ... Advances in analysis of low signal-to-noise images link dynamin and AP2 to the functions of an endocytic checkpoint Dev. Cell. 2013; 26 :279-291 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the distribution of the fluorescence values of single mEGFPs was determined. The detection and tracking of ZAR1-mEGFP oligomers for molecule counting were also performed using the cmeAnalysis software package. The trajectories with lifetime longer than 10 frames were selected, and the amplitude of the 2-D Gaussian point spread function fitting for the detected ZAR1-mEGFP was used to estimate the number of ZAR1-mEGFP molecules calibrated by the intensity of single mEGFP.
To quantify the ROS production in protoplasts, the H 2 DCFDA fluorescence signal after correction by Histogram Matching was used for plotting ( Miura, 2020 45. Miura, K. Bleach correction ImageJ plugin for compensating the photobleaching of time-lapse sequences F1000Res. 2020; 9 :1494 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). For protoplast-based cell death assays, statistical analyses were performed with the Graphpad Prism 7.0 software ( https://www.graphpad.com/ ). One-way ANOVA was performed, and Tukey’s test was carried out for multiple comparison. More details are provided in METHOD DETAILS and FIGURE LEGENDS.
