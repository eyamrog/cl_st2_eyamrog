Title: Genetically engineered myeloid cells rebalance the core immune suppression program in metastasis


Abstract: Summary

Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and greater knowledge of the metastatic microenvironment is necessary to effectively target this process. Microenvironmental changes occur at distant sites prior to clinically detectable metastatic disease; however, the key niche regulatory signals during metastatic progression remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a core immune suppression gene signature in pre-metastatic niche formation that is expressed predominantly by myeloid cells. We target this immune suppression program by utilizing genetically engineered myeloid cells (GEMys) to deliver IL-12 to modulate the metastatic microenvironment. Our data demonstrate that IL12-GEMy treatment reverses immune suppression in the pre-metastatic niche by activating antigen presentation and T cell activation, resulting in reduced metastatic and primary tumor burden and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice. We demonstrate that IL12-GEMys can functionally modulate the core program of immune suppression in the pre-metastatic niche to successfully rebalance the dysregulated metastatic microenvironment in cancer.

Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, there is an unmet need to better understand the metastatic process, and the development of effective therapies for metastatic disease remains a major challenge. The metastatic microenvironment offers a potential therapeutic target given its vital role in the pathogenesis and regulation of metastasis ( Joyce and Pollard, 2009 41. Joyce, J.A. ∙ Pollard, J.W.

The pre-metastatic niche is a complex and dynamic microenvironment, with tumor-derived factors triggering the activation of non-immune stromal cells, extracellular matrix remodeling, and accumulation of bone-marrow-derived cells ( Kaplan et al., 2005 44.

Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We have previously shown the expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow of tumor-bearing mice, with these cells entering circulation and arriving in pre-metastatic lungs prior to the arrival of tumor cells ( Kaplan et al., 2005 44. Kaplan, R.N. ∙ Riba, R.D. ∙ Zacharoulis, S. ...

Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Elevated circulating progenitor cells can also be detected in cancer patients at diagnosis and are predictive of disease relapse ( Giles et al., 2016 26. Giles, A.J. ∙ Reid, C.M. ∙ Evans, J.D. ... Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). These circulating progenitor cells enter the pre-metastatic lung where they differentiate into immunosuppressive myeloid cells ( Giles et al., 2016 26. Giles, A.J. ∙ Reid, C.M. ∙ Evans, J.D. ... Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we hypothesize that myeloid-mediated immune suppression is a central regulator of metastasis.
To expand on our observations that bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells accumulate in pre-metastatic lungs, we set out to explore the function of these cells in the pre-metastatic niche and interrogate changes in the immune compartment in pre-metastatic lungs during the course of tumor progression. Myeloid cells can limit T cell activation and intravasation ( Gabrilovich et al., 2012 22. Gabrilovich, D.I. ∙ Ostrand-Rosenberg, S. ∙ Bronte, V.

These myeloid-based immuno suppressive mechanisms are also well characterized in the context of tumorigenesis and in the primary tumor microenvironment ( Gabrilovich, 2017 21. Gabrilovich, D.I.

Neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation awaken dormant cancer cells in mice Science. 2018; 361 :eaao4227 Crossref Scopus (326) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we reason that the immune regulation that tightly governs stem cell niche biology might also be relevant to the niche that fosters metastatic progression.
Here, we comprehensively explore the dynamics of immune cells in the earliest metastatic microenvironment of the lung and interrogate the core niche programs by transcriptional profiling of the pre-metastatic lungs of tumor-bearing mice. We utilized multi-dimensional flow cytometry, high-resolution tissue RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define how metastatic progression reshapes the immune landscape within the lung. Our findings reveal that myeloid cell signatures and pathways are among the most significantly enhanced features of the pre-metastatic microenvironment of the lung and that the transcriptional profile of the pre-metastatic niche is enriched in an immune suppression gene signature derived predominantly from myeloid populations. We hypothesize that reprogramming myeloid-mediated immune suppression pathways in the pre-metastatic microenvironment could limit metastatic disease.
In order to determine the impact of disrupting immune suppression in the pre-metastatic niche, we investigate the use of myeloid cells as a platform to deliver antitumor cytokines to pre-metastatic sites. To take advantage of the accumulation of myeloid cells that help create the pre-metastatic niche, we generated genetically engineered myeloid cells (GEMys) to deliver the antitumor cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) into the local milieu during metastatic progression. IL-12 is produced by myeloid cells in response to infection and cancer, stimulates T and natural killer (NK) cell priming, effector function, and survival, and induces a strong interferon gamma (IFN-γ) response that increases antigen presentation and decreases pro-tumorigenic processes such as angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling ( Brunda et al., 1993 7.

Previous efforts to use IL-12 clinically through systemic administration or secretion by T cells have had limitations due to toxicity associated with the presence of high levels of systemic IL-12, highlighting the need to mimic a more physiologic approach for the local delivery of IL-12 ( Kerkar et al., 2011 46.

Other groups have utilized macrophages or dendritic cells to secrete therapeutic factors into tissue sites; however, these terminally differentiated cells have different functional properties and have not been investigated in metastatic disease ( Moyes et al., 2017 63.

Klichinsky, M. ∙ Ruella, M. ∙ Shestova, O. ... Human chimeric antigen receptor macrophages for cancer immunotherapy Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :947-953 Crossref Scopus (132) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on the unique homing and surveillance properties of myeloid cells that lead to their accumulation in pre-metastatic sites, myeloid cells have the capability to infiltrate even immunologically “cold” tumors where T cells are often excluded or limited to the periphery ( Awad et al., 2018 2. Awad, R.M. ∙ De Vlaeminck, Y. ∙ Maebe, J. ... Turn Back the TIMe: Targeting Tumor Infiltrating Myeloid Cells to Revert Cancer Progression Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1977 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Harnessing the homing and tumoritropic properties of myeloid cells for the local delivery of specific cargo is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer and metastasis.
Transcriptomic analysis of lung tissue following administration of IL-12-secreting GEMys (IL12-GEMys) demonstrates a dramatic reprogramming of the metastatic niche, resulting in downregulation of immunosuppressive pathways, upregulation of antigen presentation machinery, and subsequent activation of cytotoxic T cell and NK cell responses. Treatment of mice bearing established tumors with IL12-GEMy therapy significantly reduced metastatic and primary tumor burden, prolonging the survival of mice in an IL-12- and T cell-dependent manner. Our study sheds light on how myeloid cells, one of the most abundantly recruited populations to tumor and metastatic microenvironments, can be harnessed as a platform to locally deliver cargo to rebalance dysregulated microenvironments.

Section: Results

We aimed to explore how immune populations change in the lung in response to primary tumor growth at a distant site. We utilized M3-9-M, a syngeneic orthotopic tumor model of rhabdomyosarcoma, that spontaneously metastasizes to the lungs and is highly analogous to human metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma ( Meadors et al., 2011 61. Meadors, J.L. ∙ Cui, Y. ∙ Chen, Q.R. ... Murine rhabdomyosarcoma is immunogenic and responsive to T-cell-based immunotherapy Pediatr. Blood Cancer. 2011; 57 :921-929 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ), an aggressive pediatric cancer arising from muscle tissue. We examined immune population dynamics in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice by flow cytometry ( Figures 1 A and 1B) at pre- (days 5–20) and early (∼days 20–22) metastatic time points ( Figures S1 A–S1E). We define the pre-metastatic window as the time points during primary tumor progression prior to evidence of metastasis in the lung by visual inspection, flow cytometry ( Figure S1 B), or bioluminescent imaging of labeled tumor ( Giles et al., 2016 26. Giles, A.J. ∙ Reid, C.M. ∙ Evans, J.D. ... Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), not excluding the possible presence of disseminated tumor cells or very early micro-metastasis ( Murgai et al., 2017 64. Murgai, M. ∙ Ju, W. ∙ Eason, M. ... KLF4-dependent perivascular cell plasticity mediates pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1176-1190 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kaplan et al., 2005 44. Kaplan, R.N. ∙ Riba, R.D. ∙ Zacharoulis, S. ... VEGFR1-positive haematopoietic bone marrow progenitors initiate the pre-metastatic niche Nature. 2005; 438 :820-827 Crossref Scopus (2239) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed a significant increase in the number of myeloid cell populations, including granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and monocytic dendritic cells (DCs) in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice ( Figure 1 A). Conversely, we found a dramatic decrease of conventional DCs, which are needed for antigen presentation and priming of an effective adaptive immune response.
In parallel, we discovered that there is a marked reduction in the number of T cells in pre-metastatic lungs, primarily in the CD4 + T cell compartment, while the number of CD8 + T cells and NK cells were not significantly changed ( Figure 1 B). Furthermore, we found that PD1 hi CD44 int T cells, associated with a dysfunctional phenotype, are most significantly increased in the pre-metastatic lung ( Figure S1 E) (Xia et al., 2019) 106. Xia, A. ∙ Zhang, Y. ∙ Xu, J. ... T Cell Dysfunction in Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy Front Immunol. 2019; 10 :1719 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar . Although T cell numbers are diminished in pre-metastatic lungs, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells retain their proliferative capacity when isolated from the pre-metastatic microenvironment and activated with CD3/CD28 beads in vitro ( Figure S1 F), suggesting that local signals within the pre-metastatic milieu suppress T cell activity rather than an intrinsic defect in T cell expansion. These data demonstrate the presence of a myeloid-rich, T cell-poor microenvironment that is formed in pre-metastatic lungs during cancer progression.
In order to investigate the transcriptional programs that underlie the pre-metastatic niche environment, we performed deep transcriptional analysis of whole lungs from naive and pre-metastatic mice. We found a dramatic shift in the expression of many genes in the lungs in response to the presence of a distant tumor ( Figure 1 C; Figures S2 A and S2B). Genes associated with adaptive immune cell recruitment and activation ( Cxcl9 , Tarm1 , Ifng , Gzmb ) are significantly increased in tumor-bearing mice compared to naive mice, demonstrating an activated immune response in the lung during the pre-metastatic phase ( Figure S2 C). Most notably, we identified many upregulated genes associated with immune suppression ( Acod1 , Ly6g , S100a8 , S100a9 , Mmp8 , Mmp9 , Ido1 , Trem1 , Il1b , Arg1 ) ( Figure S2 C). These data provide evidence that the pre-metastatic lung does not lack adaptive immunity, but rather there is a program of active immune suppression that inhibits effective antitumor immunity. To better define this program of immune suppression, we created a pre-metastatic gene signature based on the top 50 genes upregulated and downregulated in pre-metastatic compared to naive lungs ( Figure S2 C). We compared this signature to published datasets and found that the genes upregulated in the lung pre-metastatic niche in our rhabdomyosarcoma model are conserved in pre-metastatic sites in other metastatic tumor models ( Figure S2 D) ( Hiratsuka et al., 2008 35.

To investigate the functional implications of this drastic change in gene expression between pre-metastatic and naive lungs, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We identified the enrichment of gene ontology (GO) gene sets associated with myeloid cell activation, migration, and differentiation in parallel with negative regulation of adaptive and T cell-mediated immune responses ( Figure 1 D). Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) indicated a significant enrichment in multiple pathways of myeloid cell-mediated immune suppression, including production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), p38 MAPK signaling, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling, the inflammasome pathway, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) signaling ( Figure S2 E) ( Gabrilovich, 2017 21.

T cell exhaustion-associated pathways are also enriched in the pre-metastatic lungs ( Figure S2 E), and genes associated with a functional T cell response were downregulated in the pre-metastatic setting such as IL12a , Tril , and Ccr6 ( Figure S2 C), implicating active suppression of adaptive immune responses during metastatic development. Furthermore, liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling are significantly downregulated in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice, which are pathways involved in lipid metabolism, suppression of tumor growth, reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cell abundance, and dampening inflammation in the bone-marrow niche ( Figure S2 E) ( Tavazoie et al., 2018 94.

Further, we performed functional annotation analysis of the top 50 genes upregulated in pre-metastatic lungs that confirmed the significant enrichment of many myeloid-mediated biological processes that play a role in immune suppression ( Figure S2 F). Among these, leukocyte and neutrophil migration and aggregation indicate enhanced expression of genes that promote the intravasation of myeloid cells early in metastatic progression, while NO and ROS biosynthesis and protein nitrosylation demonstrate inhibition of T cell receptor signaling and attenuated T cell activation ( Figure S2 F) ( Gabrilovich, 2017 21.

Altered recognition of antigen is a mechanism of CD8+ T cell tolerance in cancer Nat. Med. 2007; 13 :828-835 Crossref Scopus (721) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, our transcriptomics data support a core module of immune suppression within the pre-metastatic niche.
To further elucidate the cellular source of the transcriptional immune suppression program in the lungs of tumor-bearing hosts, we performed scRNA-seq of naive and pre-metastatic lungs. Cell-type identity of each cluster was defined by the expression of lineage markers ( Figures S3 A and S3B). scRNA-seq revealed a global shift in immune cell populations ( Figure 1 E). Consistent with our flow cytometry data, we observed a striking expansion of the number of granulocytes along with a significant decrease in lymphocytes including non-cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, and B cells compared to naive lung ( Figure 1 F). Key immune suppression genes from the pre-metastatic niche gene signature ( Figure S2 C) are most highly expressed by myeloid cells, including S100a8 , S100a9 , Mmp8 , Mmp9 , Acod1 , and Trem1 ( Figure 1 G; Figure S3 C). In addition, Nfe2l2 , Arg2 , and Trem2 , genes implicated in the immunosuppressive function of myeloid cells, are upregulated by many myeloid cell types in the pre-metastatic niche ( Figure 1 H) ( Beury et al., 2016 3. Beury, D.W. ∙ Carter, K.A. ∙ Nelson, C. ... Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Survival and Function Are Regulated by the Transcription Factor Nrf2 J.

Furthermore, evolutionarily conserved interferon-inducible transmembrane genes that play a role in suppressing interferon-mediated immunity in stem cell niches, Ifitm1 and Ifitm3 , were also significantly upregulated in myeloid populations in the pre-metastatic lungs ( Figure S3 D). We found a high degree of similarity between many of the myeloid-associated immune suppression genes that we found in our sequencing data and human bone-marrow myeloid populations from the hematopoietic stem cell niche ( TREM1 , CYBB , S100A8, S100A9, I L1B , IFITM1 , IFITM3 ) ( Figure S4 ) ( Hay et al., 2018 32.

Hematol. 2018; 68 :51-61 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (36) PubMed Google Scholar ), drawing a parallel between the programs limiting immune responses in the pre-metastatic niche and stem cell niche.
These data demonstrate that the pre-metastatic niche is a myeloid-rich, T cell-poor microenvironment expressing a core regulatory program of active myeloid-mediated immune suppression.
We and others have shown that bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells are elevated in circulation and highly enriched in the tumor and metastatic microenvironments in both mice and humans ( Figure 1 ) ( Giles et al., 2016 26.

To take advantage of this marked infiltration of myeloid cells into pre-metastatic lungs, we generated genetically engineered myeloid cells, herein referred to as “GEMys,” as an immunotherapy platform to deliver cargo to manipulate the microenvironment of the pre-metastatic niche. As IL-12 has previously been shown to demonstrate potent antitumor activity ( Wolf et al., 1991 105. Wolf, S.F. ∙ Temple, P.A. ∙ Kobayashi, M. ...

Colombo, M.P. ∙ Trinchieri, G. Interleukin-12 in anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13 :155-168 Crossref Scopus (554) PubMed Google Scholar ), we designed GEMys to secrete IL-12 (IL12-GEMys) to target the core immune suppression program in the metastatic microenvironment. Given that the myeloid cells accumulating in the pre-metastatic lungs are of bone-marrow origin ( Giles et al., 2016 26. Giles, A.J. ∙ Reid, C.M. ∙ Evans, J.D. ... Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), we generated GEMys from lineage-depleted bone-marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Cells were transduced with lentivirus encoding IL-12 and the Thy1.1 reporter, and cultured in the presence of SCF, FLT3L, and IL-6 for 4 days ( Figure 2 A). The IL12-GEMy product is a heterogeneous population, predominantly resembling the macrophage and monocyte profiles within our scRNA-seq clusters ( Figure 2 B), with a large component of Ly6G – Ly6C + monocytes ( Figure S5 A). IL-12 production was confirmed by ELISA ( Figure 2 C; Figure S5 B).
Upon intravenous (i.v.) administration of IL12-GEMys into tumor-bearing mice, IL-12 levels peaked in the lungs at 4 days post-treatment, followed by a delayed peak of IFN-γ production at 1 week ( Figure 2 D). Similar trends were seen in the serum, spleen, and tumor, with no appreciable differences in IL-12 or IFN-γ in the liver over vector-control-treated mice ( Figure S5 C). Notably, the highest IFN-γ levels were detected in the lung and in the tumor, at levels two times greater than the amount detected in the serum and spleen ( Figure 2 D; Figure S5 C). IL12-GEMys generated from CD45.1 + Pepboy mice transferred into CD45.2 + wild-type hosts were detected primarily in the lung, liver, and spleen in similar proportions as vector-control cells at 24 h after adoptive transfer, suggesting that the expression of IL-12 does not significantly impact cell homing ( Figure S5 D). Both IL12-GEMy and vector-control cells were detected at low frequencies in the bone marrow, tumor, lymph nodes, and blood. In contrast to the high proportion of Ly6G + endogenous myeloid cells, IL12-GEMys retain a Ly6G – monocytic phenotype in the lungs, suggesting that their phenotype is not drastically changed upon injection in vivo ( Figure S5 E). Together these data demonstrate the feasibility of generating functional murine GEMys from HSCPs and that IL12-GEMys effectively deliver IL-12 to the pre-metastatic microenvironment.
To determine the impact of IL12-GEMys on immune populations in the metastatic microenvironment, we profiled lymphoid and myeloid populations in the lungs of mice at primary tumor endpoint that received either no treatment, control myeloid cells, or IL12-GEMys. Although, there was no significant change in the total number of myeloid cells in the lungs of IL12-GEMy-treated mice compared to controls, there was a significantly higher number of both monocytic and conventional DCs, which can serve as professional antigen-presenting cells to activate adaptive immunity, along with monocytes and macrophages ( Figure 2 E). Dendritic cells increased in the lung as early as 1 week following IL12-GEMy treatment, while other myeloid populations remained relatively stable ( Figure S5 F). There were minimal changes in myeloid populations in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor between IL12-GEMy-treated and control mice ( Figure S5 G).
The lungs of tumor-bearing mice that received IL12-GEMys had significantly more CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, and NK cells compared to mice receiving no treatment or control myeloid cells ( Figure 2 F). Additionally, IL12-GEMy treatment significantly increased the relative percentage of activated PD1 int CD44 hi T cells without impacting the dysfunctional PD1 hi CD44 int T cell subset ( Figure 2 G). The increase of T cells 3 days after IL12-GEMy treatment was also observed by immunofluorescence imaging of lung tissue, which showed an increased trend in CD4 + cells and significantly higher numbers of CD8 + cells ( Figure 2 H). To further delineate the kinetics of T cell recruitment or expansion, lungs were harvested from M3-9-M tumor-bearing mice that were treated with IL12-GEMys and analyzed by flow cytometry at various time points. The number of T cells and NK cells increased as early as 3 days post-IL12-GEMy transfer ( Figure S5 H), while the greatest increase in the proportion of PD-1 + and CD44 + T cells occurred between 3–7 days after IL12-GEMy delivery ( Figure S5 I), coinciding with IL-12 cargo delivery to the pre-metastatic lung and rise in IFN-γ levels ( Figure 2 D). There were no appreciable differences in the frequency of CD3 + and NK1.1 + cells in the spleen or tumor, with decreased NK1.1 + cells in the tumor-draining lymph node of IL12-GEMy-treated mice ( Figure S5 J), indicating a metastatic niche-specific response to IL12-GEMy treatment in tumor-bearing mice.
The IL12-GEMy cell number remained stable in the lung up to a week after transfer, indicating that the IL12-GEMys have limited expansion in vivo ( Figure S5 K). The proliferation of T cells expressing high levels of IL-12 was responsible for toxicity observed in previous studies ( Obstfeld et al., 2017 70. Obstfeld, A.E. ∙ Frey, N.V. ∙ Mansfield, K. ... Cytokine release syndrome associated with chimeric-antigen receptor T-cell therapy: clinicopathological insights Blood. 2017; 130 :2569-2572 Crossref Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ; Maude et al., 2014 60. Maude, S.L. ∙ Barrett, D. ∙ Teachey, D.T. ... Managing cytokine release syndrome associated with novel T cell-engaging therapies Cancer J. 2014; 20 :119-122 Crossref Scopus (421) PubMed Google Scholar ).
These data indicate that IL12-GEMy treatment reshapes the metastatic environment by promoting the accumulation of activated T cells, NK cells, and DCs in the lung.
To determine the impact of IL12-GEMy treatment on the pre-metastatic microenvironment, we profiled the transcriptomic landscape of the pre-metastatic lungs 3 days after treatment with IL12-GEMys. IL12-GEMy treatment promotes a dramatic shift in the transcriptional program of pre-metastatic lungs ( Figures S6 A and S6B). IL12-GEMy treatment induces the expression of genes associated with adaptive immune cell activation, such as Th1 phenotype ( Tbx21 , Ifng , Stat1 ), cytotoxicity ( Prf1 , Ctsw , Klrg1 ), and T cell receptor signaling ( Lck , Lat ) ( Figure 3 A). Furthermore, there is a dramatic upregulation of genes associated with antigen processing and presentation ( Ciita , Batf3 , B2m , Tap1 , H2-K1 , H2-Q4 , H2-Aa , H2-Ab1 , and H2-Eb1 ) ( Figure 3 A). Strikingly, immunosuppressive genes that are upregulated in pre-metastatic lungs compared to naive lungs are downregulated with IL12-GEMy treatment ( Figure 3 A). This reversal of the core immune suppression program is demonstrated by analyzing the pre-metastatic gene signature generated in Figure S2 C. The top 50 genes downregulated in the pre-metastatic niche are significantly increased with IL12-GEMy treatment, and the top 50 genes upregulated in the pre-metastatic niche are significantly reduced with IL12-GEMy treatment ( Figure 3 B). This reversal of the core immune suppression program illustrates the plasticity of the pre-metastatic niche phenotype that can be targeted by the introduction of IL12-GEMys to induce profound reprogramming of the niche environment in the lungs of tumor-bearing mice.
GSEA confirmed the enrichment of gene sets associated with IL-12 production, CD8 + T cell activation, IFN-γ signaling, and antigen processing and presentation, together with the downregulation of gene sets related to myeloid cell homeostasis and migration ( Figure 3 C). Pathway analysis revealed the upregulation of T cell pathways related to antitumor activity, such as ICOS signaling ( Hutloff et al., 1999 40. Hutloff, A. ∙ Dittrich, A.M. ∙ Beier, K.C. ... ICOS is an inducible T-cell co-stimulator structurally and functionally related to CD28 Nature. 1999; 397 :263-266 Crossref Scopus (1107) PubMed Google Scholar ; Soldevilla et al., 2019 88. Soldevilla, M.M. ∙ Villanueva, H. ∙ Meraviglia-Crivelli, D. ... ICOS Costimulation at the Tumor Site in Combination with CTLA-4 Blockade Therapy Elicits Strong Tumor Immunity Mol. Ther. 2019; 27 :1878-1891 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ), PPAR signaling ( Koeffler, 2003 49. Koeffler, H.P. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and cancers Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9 :1-9 PubMed Google Scholar ), Th1 activation, NFAT signaling, and interferon signaling ( Figure S6 C). In parallel, the transcriptional profile of IL12-GEMy-treated lungs revealed a significant downregulation of pathways involved in niche-associated immune suppression such as TGF-β, IL-1, IL-6, and iNOS signaling, as well as oxidative stress response and the production of NO and ROS ( Figure S6 C).
In order to examine the transcriptional effects of IL12-GEMys on specific cell populations, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on pre-metastatic lungs from tumor-bearing non-treated and IL12-GEMy-treated mice. Although there was no significant change in the relative numbers of the myeloid cell populations by scRNA-seq, myeloid cells did demonstrate a marked shift of transcriptional reprogramming in response to IL12-GEMy ( Figure S6 D). To better understand IL12-GEMy-dependent phenotypic changes in the transcriptional programs of myeloid cells, we performed pathway analysis of myeloid cell clusters in the lungs of IL12-GEMy-treated versus non-treated tumor-bearing mice. We observed marked activation of interferon, Th1, and DC maturation pathways in monocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, and DCs ( Figure 3 D). In addition, there was also a strong reduction in genes related to leukocyte extravasation within the granulocyte population ( Figure 3 D). Notably, there was a strong downregulation of immunosuppressive pathways within myeloid clusters including the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, Th2 signaling, TGF-β, and IL-8 signaling ( Figure 3 D) ( Gajewski et al., 2006 23. Gajewski, T.F. ∙ Meng, Y. ∙ Harlin, H. Immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment J. Immunother. 2006; 29 :233-240 Crossref Scopus (177) PubMed Google Scholar ). These findings implicate IL12-GEMy cell therapy in reducing a multitude of diverse signaling pathways within the pre-metastatic niche that can contribute to the core immune suppression program.
To further elucidate the contribution of specific cell types to the IL12-GEMy response, we examined the expression of relevant genes on a per cluster basis. One of the main downstream effects of IL-12 signaling is IFN-γ production, which is robustly induced after IL12-GEMy administration in cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, as well as significantly upregulated, although at a lower level, in DCs, monocytes, and granulocytes ( Figure 3 E). IFN-γ signals through Stat1, which is also highly upregulated by many cell types in the pre-metastatic niche in response to IL12-GEMys ( Figure 3 E). IFN-γ-induced Slamf8, a negative regulator of ROS production and migration in myeloid cells, is robustly upregulated in DCs, macrophages, and monocytes following IL12-GEMy treatment ( Figure 3 E) ( Wang et al., 2015 100. Wang, G. ∙ van Driel, B.J. ∙ Liao, G. ... Migration of myeloid cells during inflammation is differentially regulated by the cell surface receptors Slamf1 and Slamf8 PLoS ONE. 2015; 10 :e0121968 PubMed Google Scholar ). IL-12 signaling is also associated with the upregulation of antigen presentation machinery ( Kerkar et al., 2011 46. Kerkar, S.P. ∙ Goldszmid, R.S. ∙ Muranski, P. ... IL-12 triggers a programmatic change in dysfunctional myeloid-derived cells within mouse tumors J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 :4746-4757 Crossref Scopus (208) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many genes associated with both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ( H2-K1 , H2-D1 , Psmb8 , Tap2 ) and MHC class II ( Ciita , H2-DMa ) antigen processing and presentation are dramatically upregulated in myeloid cells and many other cell types ( Figure 3 F). Furthermore, single-cell analysis revealed that the expression of many of the immunosuppressive genes is reduced in specific cell populations, such as Il1b ( Mantovani et al., 2018 58. Mantovani, A. ∙ Barajon, I. ∙ Garlanda, C. IL-1 and IL-1 regulatory pathways in cancer progression and therapy Immunol. Rev. 2018; 281 :57-61 Crossref Scopus (120) PubMed Google Scholar ) in monocytes and granulocytes, Cybb ( Martner et al., 2019 59. Martner, A. ∙ Aydin, E. ∙ Hellstrand, K. NOX2 in autoimmunity, tumor growth and metastasis J. Pathol. 2019; 247 :151-154 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ) in monocytes, and Trem2 ( Katzenelenbogen et al., 2020 45. Katzenelenbogen, Y. ∙ Sheban, F. ∙ Yalin, A. ... Coupled scRNA-Seq and Intracellular Protein Activity Reveal an Immunosuppressive Role of TREM2 in Cancer Cell. 2020; 182 :872-885 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (37) PubMed Google Scholar ) in macrophages and monocytes ( Figure 3 G). Additionally, Pik3r5 , a recently identified molecular switch that controls immune suppression ( Kaneda et al., 2016 43. Kaneda, M.M. ∙ Messer, K.S. ∙ Ralainirina, N. ... PI3Kγ is a molecular switch that controls immune suppression Nature. 2016; 539 :437-442 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ), is reduced in cytotoxic T cell, NK cell, and monocyte populations ( Figure 3 G). Other genes that we and others have previously identified as playing vital roles in the pre-metastatic niche are also differentially regulated. Mmp9 ( Hiratsuka et al., 2002 34. Hiratsuka, S. ∙ Nakamura, K. ∙ Iwai, S. ... MMP9 induction by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 is involved in lung-specific metastasis Cancer Cell. 2002; 2 :289-300 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (694) PubMed Google Scholar ) is significantly downregulated in granulocytes and Cxcr4 , an important chemokine receptor for HSPC homing ( Giles et al., 2016 26. Giles, A.J. ∙ Reid, C.M. ∙ Evans, J.D. ... Activation of Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells Promotes Immunosuppression Within the Pre-metastatic Niche Cancer Res. 2016; 76 :1335-1347 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), is reduced in many cell types ( Figure 3 G). Additionally, we and others have shown that perivascular cell-derived fibronectin ( Fn1 ) is a key component of the pre-metastatic niche ( Murgai et al., 2017 64. Murgai, M. ∙ Ju, W. ∙ Eason, M. ...

Here, we demonstrate that monocytes and eosinophils also contribute to fibronectin production in addition to non-immune stromal cells, and IL12-GEMy treatment significantly reduces Fn1 production in all three populations ( Figure 3 G).
Together, these data provide evidence that IL12-GEMys have the ability to induce a cascade of transcriptional events in multiple cell types to reverse immune suppression in the pre-metastatic lung microenvironment, leading to the activation of adaptive immune responses. Further, our analysis offers key insights into the cell-specific responses to IL-12 signaling in vivo within the pre-metastatic niche environment.
We next sought to determine whether reversing the core immune suppression signature in the pre-metastatic microenvironment with IL12-GEMy treatment has a therapeutic impact on metastatic disease progression. We utilized luciferase-expressing rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cells to measure spontaneous metastasis to the lung. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with vector control or IL12-GEMys, lungs were harvested on day 22, and bioluminescent signal was measured ex vivo for quantification of metastatic tumor burden. Mice treated with IL12-GEMys had significantly lower metastatic signal in their lungs than vector-control-treated mice ( Figure 4 A). IL12-GEMy-treated mice survived significantly longer than non-treated and vector-control-treated mice (p < 0.001), and we observed regression of established primary tumors ( Figure 4 B). As we did not observe a difference in tumor progression nor survival between vector-control and non-treated mice, we used non-treated mice as controls in future experiments.
To determine whether IL-12 delivery by GEMys is important or whether the presence of IL-12 in the myeloid cell culture results in therapeutic efficacy, we adoptively transferred control myeloid cells, in vitro IL-12 pre-treated myeloid cells, or IL12-GEMys into tumor-bearing mice. IL12-GEMy treatment significantly improved survival compared to non-treated mice (p = 0.0006) and had significantly smaller primary tumors at endpoint than mice without treatment or mice receiving non-transduced myeloid or IL-12 pre-treated myeloid cells ( Figure S6 E). Lungs from IL12-GEMy-treated mice had significantly less metastatic burden and frequency of metastasis compared to lungs from non-treated mice ( Figure S6 F). By contrast, there was no significant difference in survival, primary tumor growth, or metastasis in mice that received either control or IL-12 pre-treated myeloid cells compared to mice without treatment ( Figures S6 E and S6F). Together these results demonstrate that the delivery of IL-12 by GEMys significantly reduces spontaneous metastasis and tumor progression in mice.
To evaluate the impact of IL12-GEMy treatment on metastatic tumors independent of primary tumor growth, mice were injected with tumor cells intravenously to establish lung lesions followed by IL12-GEMy treatment 11 days later and assessed for metastatic progression by bioluminescence imaging ( Figure 4 C). Mice treated with IL12-GEMys had decreased metastatic burden and increased survival, indicating that IL12-GEMys limit aggressive metastatic tumor growth.
Clinically, many rhabdomyosarcoma patients undergo surgical resection of their primary tumor; however, 30% of patients later relapse with metastatic disease ( Pappo et al., 1999 72. Pappo, A.S. ∙ Anderson, J.R. ∙ Crist, W.M. ... Survival after relapse in children and adolescents with rhabdomyosarcoma: A report from the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17 :3487-3493 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to model neo-adjuvant treatment and metastasis independent of effects on primary tumor but in the presence of pre-metastatic niche formation, tumor-bearing mice were treated with IL12-GEMys followed by amputation of the tumor-bearing leg 1 week after treatment. A single dose of IL12-GEMy cell therapy prior to tumor resection significantly extended the survival of mice, with no evidence of disease over 1 year after treatment in 90% of mice, while all mice receiving surgery alone succumbed to relapsed disease ( Figure 4 D).
To determine whether the efficacy of IL12-GEMy treatment is dose dependent, we administered either a single high dose or low dose of IL12-GEMys to mice with established primary tumors ( Figure S6 G). Low-dose IL12-GEMys resulted in transient tumor regression in 20% of the mice with no significant improvement in survival, while high-dose IL12-GEMys resulted in more durable tumor regressions in 100% of mice, significantly enhancing the survival of mice relative to low-dose IL12-GEMys (p = 0.0003) ( Figure S6 G). These data indicate that the therapeutic efficacy of IL12-GEMys is dose dependent.
Many immunotherapies have demonstrated enhanced efficacy when used in combination with chemotherapy conditioning due to enhanced production of homeostatic chemokines and cytokines that occurs with chemotherapy-induced leukopenia ( Turtle et al., 2016a 96.

Moreover, many T cell-based immunotherapies require chemotherapy pre-conditioning for optimal effect, leading us to ask whether the same might be true for myeloid cell-based therapies. To test whether the efficacy of IL12-GEMy therapy is enhanced by cyclophosphamide chemotherapy pre-conditioning, M3-9-M tumor-bearing mice were administered a single dose of 2 mg cyclophosphamide 10 days post-tumor inoculation followed by IL12-GEMy treatment 2 days later ( Figure 4 E). Cyclophosphamide alone had a modest delay in primary tumor growth and significantly increased survival compared to non-treated mice (p = 0.0035) ( Figure 4 E). The combination of cyclophosphamide with either low-dose or high-dose IL12-GEMys demonstrated a marked decrease in tumor progression and significantly improved survival compared to cyclophosphamide alone ( Figure 4 E). Furthermore, cyclophosphamide combined with IL12-GEMy treatment was curative in 30% of mice receiving a low dose of IL12-GEMys and reached 66.7% in mice that received a high dose of IL12-GEMys ( Figure 4 E). These data indicate that the therapeutic benefit of chemotherapy pre-conditioning may be generalized to many types of cell-based immunotherapies and can greatly improve outcomes for IL12-GEMy therapy.
Given that IL12-GEMys can home to the liver ( Figure S5 D) and to extend our findings to an epithelial tumor model, we tested the impact of IL12-GEMy therapy on cancer progression in a highly aggressive pancreatic cancer liver metastasis model. KPC177669 is a Kras – /p53 – tumor cell line derived from the KPC mouse model ( Lee et al., 2016 52. Lee, J.W. ∙ Komar, C.A. ∙ Bengsch, F. ... Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Pancreatic Cancer: The KPC Model (LSL-Kras(G12D/+); LSL-Trp53(R172H/+); Pdx-1-Cre), Its Variants, and Their Application in Immuno-oncology Drug Discovery Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2016; 73 :14.39.1-14.39.20 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) that metastasizes specifically to the liver when cells are delivered into splenic circulation. Administration of IL12-GEMys 5 days post-intrasplenic injection of tumor cells delayed primary tumor and metastatic outgrowth and significantly extended the survival of mice with KPC177669 pancreatic tumors (p = 0.0013) ( Figure 4 F). Together, these data indicate that IL12-GEMy therapy targets the metastatic process in multiple tumor models as well as the pre-metastatic niche of the liver. Our data demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of the intravenous administration of a myeloid-based immunotherapy for the treatment of tumor progression and metastasis.
Given the efficacy of IL12-GEMy therapy, we sought to further investigate the mechanism of action of IL12-GEMys in metastatic regulation. As pathways associated with T cell activation were upregulated in the lungs of IL12-GEMy-treated mice ( Figure 3 A), we more closely examined the mechanism of T cell activation by IL12-GEMys. Based on our findings of a strong Ifng gene signature in the transcriptomic analysis of whole lung ( Figure 3 A) and the induction of Ifng in the cytotoxic T cell cluster by single-cell analysis ( Figure 3 E), we evaluated the ability of IL12-GEMys to induce IFN-γ production by T cells. Co-culture of T cells with IL12-GEMys enhanced the ability of both naive and activated OT-I CD8 + and OT-II CD4 + T cells to produce IFN-γ in vitro in response to cognate peptide relative to co-culture with control myeloid cells ( Figure 5 A). These data demonstrate the direct impact that IL12-GEMys have on T cell IFN-γ-production and support our previous findings that IL12-GEMy function, at least in part, by inducing IFN-γ production by T cells in vivo .
Whole-lung deep transcriptomic profiling of IL12-GEMy-treated mice demonstrates low expression of genes associated with naive T cells and elevated expression of genes associated with effector function and cytotoxicity, suggesting that IL12-GEMy cell therapy promotes the activation of cytotoxic T cell responses ( Figure 5 B). Furthermore, the expression of genes associated with T cell exhaustion is low, suggesting that T cells are being functionally activated in the lungs of IL12-GEMy-treated mice ( Figure 5 B). Single-cell analysis demonstrates the upregulation of key cytotoxicity and activation markers in T cells and NK cells including Gzma , Gzmb , Prf1 , Klrg1 , Nkg7 , Cd69 , and Tnfrsf18 ( Figure 5 C). Furthermore, expression of the T cell exhaustion regulator Nr4a2 is significantly reduced in CD8 + and NK cells ( Figure 5 C) ( Chen et al., 2019 11. Chen, J. ∙ López-Moyado, I.F. ∙ Seo, H. ... NR4A transcription factors limit CAR T cell function in solid tumours Nature. 2019; 567 :530-534 Crossref Scopus (168) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pathway analysis of the cytotoxic T cell cluster from scRNA-seq supports these findings, as metabolic activity associated with T cell activation is significantly enriched in these cells ( Figure 5 D). Pathways related to NK cell activation, including ceramide signaling and cytotoxic apoptosis of target cells, are upregulated by IL12-GEMy treatment ( Figure 5 D). These data implicate cytotoxic T and NK cells as key effectors of IL12-GEMy cell therapy on limiting metastatic progression.
To gain a more detailed understanding of T and NK cell populations in the pre-metastatic niche following IL12-GEMy treatment, we selected the cytotoxic T cell, non-cytotoxic T cell, NK cell, and other lymphocyte clusters from our scRNA-seq analysis and performed higher resolution clustering analysis on these cell subsets ( Figure 5 E; Figure S6 H). We observe a significant increase in CD8 + Hmgb2 -expressing cells and gamma delta (γδ) T cells ( Figure 5 E). Interestingly, we found a decrease in NK cells expressing Ccl5 and Tyrobp with an increase in NK cells expressing AW112020 and Ccl4 ( Figure 5 E). Furthermore, we found that the Ccl5 -expressing CD8 + T cell and NK cell clusters had the highest upregulation of Ifng and cytotoxic factors Gzma , Gzmb , and Prf1 in response to IL12-GEMy treatment ( Figure 5 F). All of the NK cell clusters expressed these effector genes even in absence of treatment, which were further upregulated in the presence of IL-12 ( Figure 5 F). Of note, the γδ T cell cluster significantly upregulated Ifng expression, which has been associated with the antitumor function of γδ T cells ( Schilbach et al., 2020 82. Schilbach, K. ∙ Welker, C. ∙ Krickeberg, N. ... In the Absence of a TCR Signal IL-2/IL-12/18-Stimulated γδ T Cells Demonstrate Potent Anti-Tumoral Function Through Direct Killing and Senescence Induction in Cancer Cells Cancers. 2020; 12 :130 Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar ) ( Figure 5 F). Together, these data provide insights into cell-specific responses to IL-12 in the pre-metastatic niche.
Given the robust activation of genes and pathways associated with T and NK cell function, we next tested which immune cell populations are necessary for the function of IL12-GEMys. We performed in vivo antibody depletion experiments to target CD8 + , CD4 + , or NK1.1 + cells to evaluate which lymphoid populations are necessary for mediating the efficacy of IL12-GEMy therapy ( Figure 5 G). Specific cell depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood 1 week after initiation of the depletion antibody regimen ( Figure S7 A). IL12-GEMy treatment in the isotype-treated group reduced large established primary tumors and significantly extended survival (p = 0.008) of tumor-bearing mice ( Figure 5 G). Mice that were depleted of CD8 + cells had no response to IL12-GEMy therapy, indicating that CD8 + cells are essential for the antitumor effect of IL12-GEMys. CD4 + cell targeting had a partial effect on IL12-GEMy efficacy, while depletion of NK1.1 + cells in combination with IL12-GEMy treatment did not have a significant difference in survival compared to the isotype plus IL12-GEMy treatment. These data demonstrate that CD8 + T cells play a critical role in the mechanism of action of IL12-GEMy therapy.
Given that IL12-GEMy therapy is dependent on CD8 + T cells and promotes the activation of T cells in vitro and in vivo , we investigated the impact of IL12-GEMy therapy on the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. An ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing M3-9-M cell line was generated and confirmed to be recognized by CD8 + OT-I T cells ( Figures S7 B and S7C). OT-I T cells, IL12-GEMys, or a combination of the two were transferred into M3-9-M ffluc-mCherry-OVA tumor-bearing mice at sub-therapeutic doses of IL12-GEMys and T cells ( Figure 6 A). The transfer of low-dose OT-I T cells or IL12-GEMys alone did not impact primary tumor growth or survival. However, the combination of adoptive transfer of IL12-GEMys and OT-I T cells significantly increased the survival of the mice (p < 0.0001) and delayed primary tumor growth ( Figure 6 A). This enhancement of therapeutic activity was elicited in the absence of any pre-conditioning regimen, suggesting that the reversal of immune suppression with IL12-GEMy cell therapy was sufficient to enhance the antitumor activity of transferred T cells.
T cell therapies currently used in the clinic are given following a pre-conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Cy/Flu) ( Heczey et al., 2017 33. Heczey, A. ∙ Louis, C.U. ∙ Savoldo, B. ... CAR T Cells Administered in Combination with Lymphodepletion and PD-1 Inhibition to Patients with Neuroblastoma Mol. Ther. 2017; 25 :2214-2224 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (184) PubMed Google Scholar ). Patients on trial for CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells who receive Cy/Flu pre-conditioning had greater CAR-T expansion, persistence, and higher response rates than patients pre-conditioned with Cy alone ( Turtle et al., 2016b 97. Turtle, C.J. ∙ Hanafi, L.A. ∙ Berger, C. ... Immunotherapy of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with a defined ratio of CD8+ and CD4+ CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells Sci Transl Med. 2016; 8 :355ra116 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cy/Flu pre-conditioning has been shown to increase efficacy through the enhanced engraftment and expansion of transferred T cells ( Turtle et al., 2016b 97. Turtle, C.J. ∙ Hanafi, L.A. ∙ Berger, C. ... Immunotherapy of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma with a defined ratio of CD8+ and CD4+ CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells Sci Transl Med. 2016; 8 :355ra116 Crossref Scopus (503) PubMed Google Scholar ). The suggested mechanism of action of this pre-conditioning is to deplete endogenous peripheral immune cells to create immunological space and increase the availability of cytokines for the homeostatic expansion of transferred cells ( Bracci et al., 2007; Hirayama et al., 2019; Neelapu, 2019 5. Bracci, L. ∙ Moschella, F. ∙ Sestili, P. ... Cyclophosphamide enhances the antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred immune cells through the induction of cytokine expression, B-cell and T-cell homeostatic proliferation, and specific tumor infiltration Clin Cancer Res. 2007; 13 :644-653 Crossref Scopus (181) PubMed Google Scholar 36. Hirayama, A.V. ∙ Gauthier, J. ∙ Hay, K.A. ... The response to lymphodepletion impacts PFS in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with CD19 CAR T cells Blood. 2019; 133 :1876-1887 Crossref Scopus (68) PubMed Google Scholar 68. Neelapu, S.S. CAR-T efficacy: is conditioning the key? Blood. 2019; 133 :1799-1800 Crossref Scopus (24) PubMed Google Scholar ). We observed lower levels of circulating T cells following Cy/Flu pre-conditioning, while myeloid populations were not impacted ( Figure S7 D). Lymphodepletion is a transient phenomenon, with endogenous lymphocyte populations rebounding by homeostatic proliferation ( Sistigu et al., 2011 86. Sistigu, A. ∙ Viaud, S. ∙ Chaput, N. ... Immunomodulatory effects of cyclophosphamide and implementations for vaccine design Semin Immunopatho. 2011; 33 :369-383 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Notably, when combined with a single-dose pre-conditioning regimen of Cy/Flu 2 days preceding cell transfer, IL12-GEMy cell therapy resulted in durable cures (>100 days) of mice with established primary tumors ( Figure 6 B). Cy/Flu pre-conditioning significantly increased the presence of transduced IL12-GEMy cells in the lungs but not primary tumors of mice 4 days after injection ( Figure S7 E). The presence of IL12-GEMys in the lung decreases over time, indicating that the cell product does not have long-term persistence in vivo ( Figure S7 E). We observe an increased trend in IL-12 levels and a 10-fold increase in IFN-γ levels in the lungs and primary tumors of mice treated with Cy/Flu and IL12-GEMys compared to IL12-GEMys without Cy/Flu pre-conditioning ( Figure S7 F). This enhanced IFN-γ response is associated with a robust expansion of PD-1 + Lag3 – CD8 + T cells in both the lung and tumor, with the response peaking earlier in the lung at 1 week after treatment and later in the primary tumor, close to 20 days after IL12-GEMy injection ( Figure S7 G). We observe a contraction of this CD8 + T cell response with resolution and cure of the tumors ( Figure S7 G). Together, these data demonstrate that a small, transient number of IL12-GEMys in the context of Cy/Flu pre-conditioning has the ability to induce a robust immune response in the pre-metastatic niche of the lung and in the primary tumor, resulting in tumor regression and long-term cure.
IL-12 can act on effector T cells to promote the production of memory T cells that persist in a functional immune response and provide protective immunity ( Xiao et al., 2009 107. Xiao, Z. ∙ Casey, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ... Programming for CD8 T cell memory development requires IL-12 or type I IFN J. Immunol. 2009; 182 :2786-2794 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ). In order to interrogate IL12-GEMy function in eliciting a memory response, cured mice were re-challenged with either unlabeled tumor or the original OVA-expressing tumor in the contralateral leg. When re-challenged with unlabeled M3-9-M, lacking the strong OVA antigen, IL12-GEMy-cured mice displayed a statistically significant delay in tumor growth relative to age-matched naive controls (p = 0.0023), evidence that IL12-GEMys elicit endogenous T cell responses that recognize multiple tumor antigens, including non-dominant antigens ( Figure 6 C). Cured mice re-challenged over 100 days post-IL12-GEMy treatment with the original tumor line were immune and did not develop tumors, consistent with the generation of functional memory T cells ( Figure 6 D).
We investigated the role of IL-12 in the maintenance of IL12-GEMy-induced remission. Mice were treated with anti-IL12 or isotype antibody and IL-12 depletion in the serum was confirmed by ELISA ( Figure S7 H). 50% of mice receiving anti-IL12 blocking antibody relapsed, suggesting that IL-12 is required for long-term tumor control ( Figure 6 E).
Together, these studies demonstrate that IL12-GEMys support the function of tumor-specific CD8 + T cells by enhancing suboptimal T cell therapy and that IL12-GEMy therapy in combination with Cy/Flu pre-conditioning is capable of generating durable cures with endogenous T cell memory to multiple antigens. This stimulation of adaptive immune responses coupled with the reversal of the immune suppression program has a profound impact on tumor and metastatic progression.
To translate our findings into the human setting, we transduced human monocyte SC cells with lentiviral vector encoding human IL-12 with truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (tEGFR) as a reporter for transduction efficiency ( Figures 7 A and 7B). To test the ability of human IL12-GEMys to induce IFN-γ production by T cells, human IL12-GEMys were co-cultured with bead-stimulated donor human lymphocytes at varying ratios. Human IL12-GEMys significantly increased the secretion of IFN-γ by human lymphocytes compared to vector-control-transduced SC cells ( Figure 7 C). These data demonstrate the expression of functional IL-12 in a human monocyte cell line and their ability to induce IFN-γ production by human lymphocytes.

Section: Discussion

We found that there is a marked myeloid-derived core immune suppression transcriptional signature in the pre-metastatic lung. We demonstrate that this pre-metastatic niche signature is a coordinated, multigenic program that induces the upregulation of many genes, while few genes are downregulated ( Figure 1 C), signifying an active immune suppression process rather than a failure of adaptive immune activation. Further, we identified parallels in myeloid-mediated immune suppression genes between the pre-metastatic niche and the human bone-marrow stem cell niche ( Figure S4 ). Although this transcriptional signature is most notably upregulated in myeloid cell populations, it is important to acknowledge that multiple other cell types also contribute to this immunosuppressive program and others features of the pre-metastatic niche ( Murgai et al., 2017 64. Murgai, M. ∙ Ju, W. ∙ Eason, M. ... KLF4-dependent perivascular cell plasticity mediates pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis Nat.

These findings are remarkably consistent with transcriptomic profiling of pre/early metastatic microenvironment by other groups with diverse metastatic tumor models ( Figure S2 D) ( Hiratsuka et al., 2008 35.

Our study provides a better understanding of how various cell types in the pre-metastatic niche create an immunoregulatory environment.
The application of myeloid cells as a platform to reshape immunosuppressive microenvironments is a previously unappreciated strategy to target cancer progression. There is a large body of literature highlighting the importance of myeloid cell homing to human tumors and metastatic sites ( Gabrilovich, 2017 21. Gabrilovich, D.I. Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Cancer Immunol. Res. 2017; 5 :3-8 Crossref Scopus (591) PubMed Google Scholar ; Gabrilovich et al., 2012 22. Gabrilovich, D.I. ∙ Ostrand-Rosenberg, S. ∙ Bronte, V.

CNS-Native Myeloid Cells Drive Immune Suppression in the Brain Metastatic Niche through Cxcl10 Cell. 2020; 183 :1234-1248.e25 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In our pre-clinical models, the introduction of IL12-GEMys reversed the core immune suppression gene program ( Figure 3 B) by disrupting the pre-metastatic niche environment to establish effective adaptive immunity ( Figures 5 B–5F), demonstrating the powerful impact that myeloid cells have in orchestrating immune responses. We highlight that the adoptive transfer of IL12-GEMys drives the plasticity of multiple different cell types toward an antitumor phenotype ( Figures 3 E–3G), suggesting that reversing these immunosuppressive programs in lieu of depleting specific cell populations is an effective therapeutic strategy. Although myeloid cell depletion is an active area of investigation that holds promise, this approach is not without shortcomings ( Awad et al., 2018 2. Awad, R.M. ∙ De Vlaeminck, Y. ∙ Maebe, J. ... Turn Back the TIMe: Targeting Tumor Infiltrating Myeloid Cells to Revert Cancer Progression Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :1977 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The depletion of immunostimulatory myeloid populations can enhance tumor growth, myeloablative therapy leaves patients immunocompromised and at risk for life-threatening infections, and myeloid depletion may result in a rebound of immunosuppressive myeloid populations produced by the bone marrow that can accelerate tumor progression ( Awad et al., 2018 2.

Cessation of CCL2 inhibition accelerates breast cancer metastasis by promoting angiogenesis Nature. 2014; 515 :130-133 Crossref Scopus (353) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, despite multiple studies implicating any one particular cell population, our data highlight that a single cell type is not responsible for immune suppression; rather, immune suppression is driven by a transcriptional program expressed in many interacting cell populations. Given the diversity of myeloid populations, the individual contribution of specific cell types and differentiation states within the IL12-GEMy product is still not fully characterized; however, we hypothesize that the heterogeneity of the cell product is an advantageous quality as different cell types can possess varying levels of persistence, homing, and functionality that come together for remarkable therapeutic efficacy. We show that, despite the findings that IL12-GEMys have a low transduction efficiency ( Figure S5 A), have limited persistence ( Figure S7 E), and induce transiently elevated IL-12 and IFN-γ levels in vivo ( Figure 2 D; Figure S5 C), we observe long-lasting tumor control ( Figures 4 and 6 ). Our data with IL-12 inhibition suggest that immune surveillance is IL-12 dependent ( Figure 6 E). Particularly in the context of Cy/Flu, we observe significantly higher induction of IFN-γ responses in the lung and primary tumor by IL12-GEMys ( Figure S7 F) that is associated with increased CD8 + T cell responses ( Figure S7 G) and complete tumor regression ( Figure 6 B). We postulate that durable cures induced by IL12-GEMy treatment may result from the generation of functional memory T cells to anti-tumor targets ( Figures 6 B–6D) without the need for the long-term persistence of the IL12-GEMys themselves. However, there may be a small population of long-lived cells in the IL12-GEMy product that persists and maintains immune surveillance. These questions are areas of future investigation.
Many current immunotherapeutic strategies are based on mounting T cell responses to specific tumor antigens. The advantage of the myeloid-based approach is the in vivo activation of endogenous T cells and NK cells to mount a more complete immune response paired with the downregulation of immune suppression that often limits the efficacy of T cell-based approaches. Our findings from scRNA-seq of lymphocyte subpopulations demonstrate selective and coordinated cell-type-specific responses to IL-12 that result in effective anti-tumor immunity and may be exploited for future combination approaches with IL12-GEMys ( Figure 5 ). Further, the observation that IL12-GEMys can impact cancer progression in the context of both lung and liver metastatic models highlights the potential application to multiple solid tumor malignancies ( Figure 4 ). With elevated lung cytokine levels in the lung metastatic sarcoma model ( Figure S5 C), we predict that the homing of GEMys is linked to site-specific metastasis. The ability of GEMys to deliver cargo to metastatic sites other than the lung in tumor models that metastasize to other tissues is an area of great therapeutic potential. This technology could provide a platform to capitalize on the intrinsic specificity of myeloid cell homing to the earliest sites of metastases when the lesions might be most susceptible to reversal of immune suppression and activation of T cell immunity. Our studies also suggest that myeloid cells could be successfully combined with T cell-based immunotherapies ( Figure 6 A), providing rationale for future combination to enhance CAR-T cell and transgenic T cell receptor approaches for the treatment of solid tumors, which are limited by myeloid-mediated immune suppression ( Li et al., 2019 54.

CAR-T Cells Hit the Tumor Microenvironment: Strategies to Overcome Tumor Escape Front. Immunol. 2020; 11 :1109 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also demonstrate that Cy/Flu chemotherapy pre-conditioning enhances IL12-GEMy efficacy, resulting in tumor regression and durable cures in our pre-clinical metastatic models ( Figures 6 B–6D). Further investigations into the mechanism of chemotherapy-mediated improvement of IL12-GEMy therapy are needed.
Together with our preliminary studies in human IL12-GEMys ( Figure 7 ), our data provide a rationale for the clinical application of IL12-GEMys for the treatment of various late-stage malignancies. This body of work opens up exciting avenues for translation, with active investigations into human monocyte persistence, fate decisions of myeloid progenitor cells, and selection of the optimal starting population for the human IL12-GEMy cell product for clinical development. Truncated EGFR is included in the human construct for the monitoring of transduction efficiency, tracking of cells, and for safety to allow cell depletion with cetuximab (anti-EGFR) administration. GEMys can be configured to express variable cargos, receptors, and safety switches, with inducible tissue-specific expression for fine-tuned modulation of the microenvironment. Our vision for this platform in patients with high-risk solid tumors is to have cells collected up front for GEMy production and given to locally activate an immune response and limit the immune evasion responsible for break in tumor dormancy and metastatic outgrowth. This approach has the potential to promote long-lived anti-tumor T cells needed for durable remissions. Our work and others’ support the development of myeloid cell-based therapy as a disruptive technology in the field of immunotherapy ( Klichinsky et al., 2020 47.

Cancer. 2020; 8 Published online September 30, 2020 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). More broadly, this platform holds promise for harnessing cell-cell communication in both immune and non-immune cell populations to rebalance dysregulated niches in many diseases. Repurposing of targeted agents that demonstrate limited benefit when administered systemically provide a wealth of opportunities for future GEMy cargo. GEMys can also be designed to deliver factors to target other non-immune mechanisms mediating pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic progression.
Together, our data provide valuable insight into the cell populations that contribute to a core transcriptional signature of immune suppression in the pre-metastatic niche. Our investigations suggest that the introduction of IL12-GEMys into the local milieu can result in profound transcriptional reprogramming in the pre-metastatic niche environment to subvert immune evasion by disseminated tumor cells. Ultimately, we demonstrate that perturbation of this immunosuppressive microenvironment with the innovative IL12-GEMy immunotherapy platform can have a profound impact on the progression of tumor growth and metastasis. The ability of myeloid cells to locally deliver cytokines or other biological mediators suggests that the applicability of such a platform could extend beyond the immune axis to deliver other key niche modulatory signals with potential application to diseases other than cancer.
This study demonstrates a proof of concept for genetically engineering myeloid cells for the treatment of cancer. Additional work will be necessary to translate and evaluate the efficacy of this approach as a human therapy. First, in these studies the mouse bone-marrow-derived GEMy cell product is a heterogeneous population of cells. The contributions and persistence of specific cell types has not yet been elucidated. Further, these studies were performed in mouse models that may be more susceptible to immunologic targeting than human tumors and cytokine toxicity may be different in animal models compared to humans. Therefore, the safety switch design in the human studies will be important to limit potential toxicity. Acknowledging these limitations, we can see tantalizing future possibilities based on the findings from this cell-therapy platform to reprogram the dysregulated microenvironment.

6-10-week-old C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 Albino mice were purchased from Charles River at NCI Frederick. B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (Pepboy), C57BL/6-Tg (TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J (OT-I), and B6.Cg-Tg (TcraTcrb)425Cbn/J (OT-II) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. RAG −/− OT-I mice were donated by Terry Fry. Male mice were used for all M3-9-M experiments and female mice were used for KPC177669 experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in specific pathogen-free conditions at the NIH Animal facility.
M3-9-M embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells were derived by Crystal Mackall’s group from a tumor in a male transgenic mouse overexpressing hepatocyte growth factor and heterozygous for mutated p53 in the Pediatric Oncology Branch at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) ( Meadors et al., 2011 61. Meadors, J.L. ∙ Cui, Y. ∙ Chen, Q.R. ... Murine rhabdomyosarcoma is immunogenic and responsive to T-cell-based immunotherapy Pediatr. Blood Cancer. 2011; 57 :921-929 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). KPC177669 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells were derived from a tumor-bearing female KPC mouse ( Lee et al., 2016 52. Lee, J.W. ∙ Komar, C.A. ∙ Bengsch, F. ... Genetically Engineered Mouse Models of Pancreatic Cancer: The KPC Model (LSL-Kras(G12D/+); LSL-Trp53(R172H/+); Pdx-1-Cre), Its Variants, and Their Application in Immuno-oncology Drug Discovery Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2016; 73 :14.39.1-14.39.20 Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) by the NCI Center for Advanced Preclinical Research (CAPR). Lenti-X cells were provided by Terry Fry. All cell lines were verified via microarray analysis and routinely tested for mycoplasma. Tumor lines were transduced with pFUGW-Pol2-ffLuc2-eGFP or pFUGW-Pol2-ffLuc2-mCherry and sterile-sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to establish labeled cell lines. M3-9-M ffluc-mCherry cells were transduced with a retrovirus encoding ovalbumin (pMSCV-OVA) provided by Terry Fry, stained with PE anti-mouse H-2K b bound to SIINFEKL (BioLegend), and sorted by FACS to establish the M3-9-M ffluc-mCherry-OVA cell line. All tumor cell lines were cultured in complete RPMI: 10% FBS (Atlantic Biologicals), 1% glutamax (GIBCO), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO), 1% non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), 1% sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 1 mM HEPES (GIBCO), and 50μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 37°C 5% CO 2 . SC (CRL-9855) human peripheral blood monocyte cells were purchased from ATCC. Cells were cultured in IMDM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlantic Biologicals), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO), HT supplement (GIBCO), and 50μM 2-mercaptoethanol (GIBCO).
For M3-9-M orthotopic tumor experiments, mice were injected in the gastrocnemius muscle with 5x10 5 M3-9-M cells in 100 μL of HBSS (GIBCO). Primary tumors were measured two to three times a week and mice were monitored for survival over time. Tumor volume was calculated as 4 3 ⁢ 𝜋 ⁢ ( 𝑋 − 𝑋 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 ) ⁢ ( 𝑌 − 𝑌 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑠 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑒 ) ⁢ ( 𝑍 ) , where X, Y, and Z are the radius of each dimension of the mouse leg. For lung colonization experiments, 5x10 4 M3-9-M ffluc-mCherry cells were injected intravenously (i.v.) via tail vein in 200 μL HBSS. For amputation experiments, primary tumors were surgically resected when tumor diameter was approximately 2 cm in the longest direction. For KPC177669 tumor experiments, mice were injected intrasplenically ( Soares et al., 2014 87. Soares, K.C. ∙ Foley, K. ∙ Olino, K. ... A preclinical murine model of hepatic metastases J. Vis. Exp. 2014; Published online September 27, 2014 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar , Morikawa et al., 1988 62. Morikawa, K. ∙ Walker, S.M. ∙ Nakajima, M. ... Influence of organ environment on the growth, selection, and metastasis of human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice Cancer Res. 1988; 48 :6863-6871 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and an 8-10 mm left subcostal incision was made. The spleen was exteriorized and 5x10 5 KPC177669-ffluc2-mCherry cells were injected in 100 μL HBSS, followed by an additional 100 μL of HBSS to flush the cells into the portal circulation. After two minutes, splenectomy was performed, and the incision was closed in two layers.
For metastasis experiments, lesions were detected by whole body in vivo and postmortem ex vivo organ bioluminescence imaging by in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Anesthetized mice received a 100 μL intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 30 μg/mL D-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology) and were incubated for five minutes. For ex vivo tissue imaging, tissues were perfused with PBS, harvested, and incubated in 1 μg/ml D-luciferin in PBS for five minutes. Luminescence was detected by IVIS Lumina Series III (Perkin Elmer) for an exposure time of one minute. Display and image analysis were performed using Living Image Software (Perkin Elmer).
We generated genetic constructs encoding the murine or human p40 and p35 IL-12 subunits fused by a linker sequence ( Zhang et al., 2015 111. Zhang, L. ∙ Morgan, R.A. ∙ Beane, J.D. ... Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes genetically engineered with an inducible gene encoding interleukin-12 for the immunotherapy of metastatic melanoma Clin. Cancer Res. 2015; 21 :2278-2288 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ) in the pELNS lentiviral transfer vector under the constitutive EF1α promoter. The murine vector containing murine IL-12 and Thy1.1 reporter protein was synthesized by Genewiz and cloned into the pELNS lentiviral transfer vector. The human lentiviral transfer vector expressing a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (tEGFR) reporter and human IL-12 was synthesized by GenScript. A construct expressing only Thy1.1 served as a vector control. Lenti-X cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO) at 37°C 5% CO 2. The day preceding lentivirus production, 1.8-2x10 7 cells were seeded onto 150 mm poly-D-Lysine coated plates (Corning). Cells were transiently transfected with Opti-MEM media (GIBCO) containing Lipofectamine 3000 and P3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), lentiviral packaging plasmids (pRSV-Rev, pMDLg/pRRE, pMD2.G) and lentiviral vector ( Dull et al., 1998 18. Dull, T. ∙ Zufferey, R. ∙ Kelly, M. ... A third-generation lentivirus vector with a conditional packaging system J. Virol. 1998; 72 :8463-8471 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Virus-containing supernatants were harvested at 24 hours and 48 hours, centrifugated to remove cellular debris, and stored at −80°C. For human cell studies, lentivirus was titered by p24 ELISA (Lonza) to determine lentiviral particles (LP) per mL of viral supernatant.
Bone marrow was flushed from the femurs and tibia of syngeneic mice with collection media (Mg - Ca - HBSS with 2% FBS and 1mM EDTA) and enriched for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells using the magnetic bead-based EasySep Mouse Hematopoietic Progenitor Cell Isolation Kit (StemCell Technologies) per the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The isolated cells were cultured in StemSpan SFEM (StemCell Technologies) media supplemented with 50 ng/mL of mouse SCF, IL-6, and FLT3-L (Bio-Techne) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were immediately transduced with lentivirus in the presence of 10 μg/mL protamine sulfate (Fresenius Kabi) and cultured at 37°C for four days. Transduction was confirmed by ELISA for IL-12 p70 (R&D Systems) and by flow cytometry analysis for Thy1.1. In cell tracking experiments, B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (Pepboy) mice were used as donors to track the CD45.1 congenic marker.
Lungs were perfused with PBS and inflated with digestion medium (HBSS supplemented with 1 mg/mL collagenase I, 20 μg/mL DNase I and Dispase II). Single-cell suspensions were prepared by finely mincing tissues with a scalpel and incubating the tissue on a shaker at 37°C for 20 minutes in 1 mL of digestion media. Tissue was passed through a 70 μM mesh strainer and washed with collection media twice. Tumors were disassociated using a modified protocol as described ( Beury et al., 2016 3. Beury, D.W. ∙ Carter, K.A. ∙ Nelson, C. ... Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cell Survival and Function Are Regulated by the Transcription Factor Nrf2 J. Immunol. 2016; 196 :3470-3478 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ). A fragment of the tumor was placed into a gentleMACs C tube (Miltenyi Biotech) containing 5 mL of digestion media. Tumors were then minced with scissors, processed on the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech) using the program m_impTumor_02. Tubes were secured in an inverted position and agitated in a 37°C shaker at 100 rpm for 40 minutes. Samples were processed again on the gentleMACS dissociator using program m_impTumor_03, passed through 70 μM cell strainer, and washed with collection media. For spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, tissues were mashed through a 70 μM cell strainer and washed with collection media. For spleen, liver and tumor tissues, red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Life Technologies) for 5 minutes and washed with collection media.
Cells were washed with PBS and stained with either Fixable Viability Dye e506 (eBiosciences) or Live/Dead Aqua (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark. Cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% BSA and 0.05% NaN 3 ), Fc blocking was performed with purified CD16/CD32 antibody (Invitrogen) and a combination of antibodies diluted in either FACS buffer or Brilliant Violet Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4°C in the dark. Cells were washed in FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. If cells were not able to be analyzed on the same day, they were fixed in 4% PFA and analyzed by flow cytometry within three days. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD LSR Fortessa or BD LSRII with the BD High Throughput Sampler (HTS) 96-well plate attachment, when applicable, and analyzed with FlowJo software version 10.5 or greater (Tree Star). In all flow cytometry assays, manual gating was based on fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls.
Mice were injection with 5x10 5 unlabeled M3-9-M tumor cells. Vector control and IL12-GEMys were generated from GFP + Luciferase + donor mice and 8x10 6 cells were injected into tumor-bearing mice i.v. on day 12 post primary tumor inoculation. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, allowed to clot at room temperature, and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for serum isolation. Lung, spleen, liver, and tumor tissue were harvested and flash frozen at indicated time points. Tissues were weighed then mechanically homogenized in T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) with HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), centrifuged to pellet cellular debris, and tissue extracts were analyzed by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Cyclophosphamide monohydrate (Sigma Aldrich) was prepared to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL in PBS and passed through a 22 μm filter. Fludarabine phosphate (Actavis Pharma, Inc. or Leucadia Pharmaceuticals) was reconstituted with sterile PBS to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL.100 μL of each was injected per mouse i.p. 2 days prior to IL12-GEMy transfer.
For cell depletion studies, mice were injected with 100 μL antibodies i.p. An initial depletion with 200 μg of anti-CD8α antibody clone 2.43, anti-CD4 antibody clone GK1.5, or rat IgG2b isotype control clone LTF-2, or 100 μg of anti-NK1.1 (PK136) (BioXCell) was administered on days 9, 11, and 12 post tumor inoculation. Antibody depletion treatment continued with the administration of 200 μg of antibody every 3-5 days for the duration of the experiment. For IL-12 blocking studies, 1 mg per mouse of InVivoMAb anti-mouse IL-12 p75 (R2-9A5) or InVivoMAb rat IgG2b isotype (LTF-2) (BioXCell) was administered i.p. on day 12 post tumor inoculation and every 5 days for the duration of the experiment.
Naive splenocytes from OT-I or OT-II mice were co-cultured with non-transduced control myeloid cells or IL12-GEMys at various ratios in the presence of 1 μg/mL OVA 257-264 (SIINFEKL) or OVA 323-339 peptide, respectively (AnaSpec, Inc), in complete RPMI (GIBCO). To generate activated T cells, splenocytes were first cultured in the presence of 1 μg/mL peptide (AnaSpec, Inc) and 50 units/mL of recombinant IL-2 (Clinigen) for 4 days prior to co-culture with myeloid cells in the presence of 1 ng/mL cognate peptide. Supernatant from co-cultures was collected after 24 hours and IFNγ was quantified by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Spleens from Rag −/− OT-I mice were harvested and processed into single cell suspension as described above. Splenocytes were activated in complete RPMI in the presence of 50 units/mL recombinant IL-2 (Clinigen) and 1 μg/mL OT-I cognate peptide OVA 257-264 (SIINFEKL) or OT-II cognate peptide OVA 323-339 for four days (AnaSpec, Inc). Activated OT-I T cells were transferred into mice i.v. via tail vein.
Lungs were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours. Fixed lungs were embedded in paraffin and 8-μM thick sections were prepared for staining (VitroVivo Biotech). Slides were stained using the Opal 7-Color Manual IHC Kit (PerkinElmer) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated in a series of xylene and ethanol gradients, microwaved in Rodent Decloaker (Biocare Medical) and then cooled. Slides were washed with water and then TBST (TBS + 0.05% Tween-20) followed by blocking with Bloxall Blocking Solution (Vector Laboratories). Staining with primary and secondary antibodies and OPAL fluorophores were performed per the manufacturer’s instructions. The following antibodies were used: CD4 (Invitrogen, clone 4SM95; 1:100), CD8 (Invitrogen, clone 4SM16; 1:100), ImmPRESS HRP Goat anti-rat IgG (Vector Laboratories; 1:4). All images were collected on a Zeiss 880/Airyscan Microscope at the CCR Microscopy Core Facility using the 20X and 40X objectives. For quantitation, the 20X images were used to manually count the number of CD4 and CD8 cells and calculate nuclear area using color thresholding in ImageJ (NIH).
Naive or tumor-bearing mice were treated or not with 8x10 6 IL12-GEMys on day twelve post tumor inoculation (n = 4 mice per group). Mice were euthanized three days after IL12-GEMy transfer and lungs were harvested. For bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), lungs were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was homogenized in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher) and RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction followed by the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. 3′ library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit and Hiseq4000 platform (Illumina) at a total of 100 million reads per sample according to standard operating procedure at the CCR Genomics core facility. Alignment, normalization, and primary gene expression analysis were performed as previously described ( Murgai et al., 2017 64. Murgai, M. ∙ Ju, W. ∙ Eason, M. ... KLF4-dependent perivascular cell plasticity mediates pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis Nat. Med. 2017; 23 :1176-1190 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) utilizing the computational resources of the NIH HPC Biowulf cluster ( https://hpc.nih.gov/ ). Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN) on gene sets with a greater-than-two-fold change and p value cut off of 0.05.
In each RNA-seq profile from the lungs of treated and non-treated tumor-bearing mice, we ranked genes in descending order based on their log-fold change in expression compared to non-tumor-bearing control mice. We tested the enrichment of selected pathways using the fgsea package ( Korotkevich et al., 2019 50. Korotkevich, G. ∙ Sukhov, V. ∙ Sergushichev, A. Fast gene set enrichment analysis bioRxiv. 2019; 060012 Google Scholar ) in R, where 10,000 permutations were used to compute enrichment p values for each pathway. Pathways with an adjust enrichment p value less than 0.1 were considered to be significantly enriched.
We derived two 50-gene pre-metastatic niche gene sets, referred to as Up-regulated and Down-regulated gene sets, by picking 50 genes that showed the highest log-fold changes in expression between lungs of non-treated tumor-bearing and control mice. To validate these gene sets, we analyzed a collection of published bulk RNA-seq and microarray-based gene expression profiles from pre-metastatic niches. Normalized microarray and bulk RNA-seq expression profiles for each dataset were downloaded using the GEOquery package in Bioconductor ( Davis and Meltzer, 2007 16. Davis, S. ∙ Meltzer, P.S. GEOquery: a bridge between the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and BioConductor Bioinformatics. 2007; 23 :1846-1847 Crossref Scopus (763) PubMed Google Scholar , Gentleman et al., 2004 25. Gentleman, R.C. ∙ Carey, V.J. ∙ Bates, D.M. ... Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics Genome Biol. 2004; 5 :R80 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). We log-transformed expression values from raw FPKM values to units of log(1 + FPKM) in RNA-seq datasets and used the author-submitted normalized expression values in microarray-based datasets. In datasets that contained replicates, we computed the average expression, after which we computed log-fold changes of gene expression between pre-metastatic and control samples. We then used a one-sided Wilcoxon test to check if genes in the Up-regulated (or Down-regulated) gene set had a higher (or lower) log-fold change than genes in the rest of the genome.
Lungs from naive or tumor-bearing mice with or without IL12-GEMy treatment (n = 4 mice per group) were processed into single-cell suspension and oligodT-based cDNA libraries were barcoded by droplet-partioning using the Chromium Single Cell Controller (10x Genomics) system at the NCI-CCR Single Cell Analysis Facility. Dead cell removal was performed, and samples were incubated with TotalSeq-A hashtag oligos (HTOs) (BioLegend). Two biological replicates were run together per capture lane. Sequencing was performed on the NovaSeq (Illumina) at the NCI-CCR Sequencing Facility. Sequencing read demultiplexing, alignment to mm10 (Ensembl Ref annotation 93), and generation of a unique-molecular-index-collapsed gene expression matrix was performed using Cell Ranger version 3.0.2 (10x Genomics). Additional data processing and analysis was performed using Seurat v3.0.2 ( Butler et al., 2018 8. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (2176) PubMed Google Scholar , Stuart et al., 2019 91. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1519) PubMed Google Scholar ) in RStudio running R v3.6.0. In short, each sample set was filtered for cell barcodes with greater than 500 genes detected and less than 20% percent mitochondrial gene expression. Cell barcodes with either no cell hashing antibody detected or multiple were excluded from the analysis. Data from all samples were merged, and normalization and scaling was performed using SCTransform ( Christoph Hafemeister, 2019 12. Christoph Hafemeister, R.S. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clustering and UMAP projections were performed on combined data, with collapsing of biologically relevant clusters informed by clustree empirical analysis. Cell type / cluster marker gene detection was performed with FindAllMarkers () in Seurat with Wilcoxon ranked sum test. Differential expression testing across conditions for each cluster performed with MAST ( Finak et al., 2015 19. Finak, G. ∙ McDavid, A. ∙ Yajima, M. ... MAST: a flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :278 Crossref Scopus (524) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single cell plots generated within Seurat using ggplot2 ( Hadley, 2016 31. Hadley, W. Ggplot2 Springer, 2016 Google Scholar ). Analysis notebooks available on request.
We created a comparison gene set to compare the IL12-GEMy product with cells in our scRNA-seq data. We first picked a set of the 3,000 most variable genes, determined by the SCTransform ( Christoph Hafemeister, 2019 12. Christoph Hafemeister, R.S. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :296 Crossref Scopus (160) PubMed Google Scholar ) function in Seurat, across all 70,370 cells in our scRNA-seq data. Out of these 3,000 genes, 1,884 were annotated and expressed in the bulk sequencing of the IL12-GEMy product, which formed our comparison gene set. To overcome noise from transcript drop-outs in the scRNA-seq data, we utilized a bootstrapping approach where we picked 90% of cells in each cluster and averaged the SCTransformed expression values of each gene in the comparison gene set. We repeated this process 100 times to generate 100 groups of cells for each cluster. We computed the cosine similarity between the average gene expression of each bootstrapped group with the IL12-GEMy bulk RNA-seq profile. Since the gene expression values are all non-zero, the cosine similarity ranges between 0 and 1, with a higher score indicating greater similarity between gene expression profiles. We then averaged the cosine similarity scores across all bootstrap groups to obtain a single similarity score between the IL12-GEMy product and each scRNA-seq cluster.
SC (CRL-9855) human peripheral blood monocyte cells were transduced with vector control or tEGFR-IL12 lentivirus for 24 hours at varying multiplicities of infection (MOI). MOI was calculated from p24 titer as lentiviral particles (LP) per cell. Transduction efficiency was measured by flow cytometry staining of human cetuximab biosimilar EGFR antibody (R&D Systems). IL-12 production was measured in the supernatant by ELISA (R&D Systems).
Primary human elutriated lymphocytes from healthy donors were acquired from the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine. Vector control or tEGFR-IL12 SC cells were transduced at a MOI of 150 LP/mL for 24 hours. Lymphocytes were incubated overnight in StemSpan SFEM II media supplemented with gentamicin and 10 units/mL of recombinant human IL-2 (Clinigen). T cells were activated with 12.5 μL/mL T Cell TransAct beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and 40 units/mL of recombinant human IL-2 and co-cultured at varying GEMy:Lymphocyte ratios. Supernatant was collected at 24 hours and analyzed for IFN-γ production by ELISA (R&D Systems).
All statistical analysis was performed in Prism version 7.03 or greater (GraphPad Software). Graphs represent mean values ± standard error. P values were calculated for bar graphs using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test, one-way ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test, and log-rank statistics for survival analyses, as indicated in figure legends. In boxplots, the center line represents the median, the box limits denote the 25 th to the 75 th percentile and the whiskers represent the minimum and maximum value. For scRNA-seq data, statistical differences between groups analyzed by Wilcoxon test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ∗ p ≤ 0.05, ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01, ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.0001.
