Title: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor ACE2 Is an Interferon-Stimulated Gene in Human Airway Epithelial Cells and Is Detected in Specific Cell Subsets across Tissues


Abstract: Summary

There is pressing urgency to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2 , a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection.

Section: Introduction

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that can cause mild to severe respiratory disease ( Fung and Liu, 2019 34. Fung, T.S. ∙ Liu, D.X. Human Coronavirus: Host-Pathogen Interaction Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :529-557 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ). Over the past two decades, zoonotic transmission events have led to the emergence of two highly pathogenic CoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, was first reported in late 2019 ( Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Paules et al., 2020 19.

COVID-19 is characterized by pneumonia, fever, cough, and occasional diarrhea ( Guan et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020 43.

As of April 19, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread worldwide, and there are over 2,401,379 confirmed cases, 165,044 deaths, and 623,903 recovered individuals in 185 countries and regions ( Dong et al., 2020a 28.

Early models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics estimate one infectious individual infects slightly over two individuals; travel restrictions reduce that spread to one individual, although these figures might evolve as more accurate epidemiological data become available ( Kucharski et al., 2020 66.

Work during the first SARS-CoV epidemic identified the human host factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for SARS-CoV ( Li et al., 2003 71. Li, W. ∙ Moore, M.J. ∙ Vasilieva, N. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor for the SARS coronavirus Nature. 2003; 426 :450-454 Crossref Scopus (2253) PubMed Google Scholar ). SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has been experimentally shown to bind ACE2 on host cells with significantly higher affinity than SARS-CoV-S ( Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020 48. Hoffmann, M. ∙ Kleine-Weber, H. ∙ Schroeder, S. ...

The main host protease that mediates S protein activation on primary target cells and initial viral entry is the type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 ( Glowacka et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2019; Matsuyama et al., 2010; Shulla et al., 2011; Walls et al., 2020 39.

Other host proteases, such as furin, have also been suggested to promote the pathogenesis of this pandemic SARS-CoV-2 clade, but when and where they process S protein remains to be determined ( Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al., 2013; Bugge et al., 2009; Coutard et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020 7.

Binding of SARS-CoV-S to ACE2 results in receptor-mediated internalization ( Grove and Marsh, 2011; Kuba et al., 2005 42. Grove, J. ∙ Marsh, M. The cell biology of receptor-mediated virus entry J.

Importantly, ACE2 functions as a key tissue-protective component during severe acute lung injury ( Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005 55. Imai, Y. ∙ Kuba, K. ∙ Rao, S. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure Nature. 2005; 436 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (1086) PubMed Google Scholar 65. Kuba, K. ∙ Imai, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ...

A tissue-level basis for understanding SARS-CoV tropism was proposed based on ACE2 histological staining and expression in human epithelia of the lung and small intestine ( Hamming et al., 2004; Harmer et al., 2002; Jonsdottir and Dijkman, 2016 46. Hamming, I. ∙ Timens, W. ∙ Bulthuis, M.L. ... Tissue distribution of ACE2 protein, the functional receptor for SARS coronavirus. A first step in understanding SARS pathogenesis J.

Jonsdottir, H.R. ∙ Dijkman, R. Coronaviruses and the human airway: a universal system for virus-host interaction studies Virol. J. 2016; 13 :24 Crossref Scopus (5) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, unlike the specific expression of CDHR3 (the rhinovirus-C receptor), which is resolved to ciliated epithelial cells of the upper airway ( Griggs et al., 2017 41. Griggs, T.F. ∙ Bochkov, Y.A. ∙ Basnet, S. ... Rhinovirus C targets ciliated airway epithelial cells Respir. Res. 2017; 18 :84 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ), the specific cell subsets within each tissue that express ACE2 remain unknown. Identifying the cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2 + ) and those at greatest risk of direct infection (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + ) is critical for understanding and modulating host defense mechanisms and viral pathogenesis.
After cellular detection of viral entry into a host cell, interferon (IFN) induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) is essential for host antiviral defense in mice, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans ( Bailey et al., 2014; Deeks et al., 2017; Dupuis et al., 2003; Everitt et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2014; Utay and Douek, 2016 4.

Utay, N.S. ∙ Douek, D.C. Interferons and HIV Infection: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Pathog. Immun. 2016; 1 :107-116 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). There are three distinct types of IFNs: type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β), type II IFNs (IFN-γ), and type III IFNs (IFN-λ) ( Broggi et al., 2020; Müller et al., 1994; Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006 10. Broggi, A. ∙ Granucci, F. ∙ Zanoni, I. Type III interferons: Balancing tissue tolerance and resistance to pathogen invasion J. Exp.

Type I interferons in host defense Immunity. 2006; 25 :373-381 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (743) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each appears to converge on almost indistinguishable responses, mediated through the binding of STAT1 homodimers or STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers to ISGs. However, mounting evidence suggests that each type of IFN might have a non-redundant role in host defense or immunopathology, particularly at epithelial barriers ( Broggi et al., 2020; Iwasaki et al., 2017; Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014; Jewell et al., 2010 10.

Although the host response to SARS-CoV highlighted a role for IFNs, most studies assessed the effect of IFN restriction in cell lines that might not fully recapitulate the repertoire of ISGs present in primary human target cells ( Bailey et al., 2014; de Lang et al., 2006; Sainz et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004 4.

One study of SARS-CoV suggested the timing of the type I IFN response was critical in vivo ( Channappanavar et al., 2016 15. Channappanavar, R. ∙ Fehr, A.R. ∙ Vijay, R. ... Dysregulated Type I Interferon and Inflammatory Monocyte-Macrophage Responses Cause Lethal Pneumonia in SARS-CoV-Infected Mice Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 19 :181-193 Full Text Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical therapy using approved IFNs has been attempted for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of a controlled trial to mixed effect, resulting in anecdotal evidence suggesting either rapid improvement or worsening of symptoms ( Dong et al., 2020b; Lei et al., 2020; Li and De Clercq, 2020 29.

Elucidating tissue- and cell-type-specific ISGs and their activity is essential for understanding the role of IFNs in host defense during human SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Massively parallel single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is transforming our ability to comprehensively map the cell types, subsets, and states present during health and disease in barrier tissues ( Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2020; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018; Smillie et al., 2019 91.

This has been particularly evident in the elucidation of novel human epithelial and stromal cell subsets and states ( Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018; Regev et al., 2017; Ruiz García et al., 2019; Schiller et al., 2019; Smillie et al., 2019; Vieira Braga et al., 2019 91.

Recently, scRNA-seq has been applied to better understand the cellular variation present during viral infection in vitro and in vivo ( Russell et al., 2018; Steuerman et al., 2018 105.

Dissection of Influenza Infection In Vivo by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Cell Syst. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Global single-cell profiling efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) initiative are ideally poised to rapidly share critical data and enhance our understanding of disease during emergent public health challenges ( Sungnak et al., 2020 120. Sungnak, W. ∙ Huang, N. ∙ Becavin, C. ... SARS-CoV-2 Entry Genes Are Most Highly Expressed in Nasal Goblet and Ciliated Cells within Human Airways Nat. Med. 2020; Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, using published and unpublished datasets (all from non-SARS-CoV-2-infected samples), we analyze human, NHP, and mouse tissues that have been clinically identified to harbor virus in patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. We provide a cautionary note on the interpretation of the scRNA-seq data presented below, given that many factors such as dissociation, profiling method, and sequencing depth can influence results ( STAR Methods ). Here, we focus our analysis and discussion on the specific subsets where ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are enriched and on relative comparisons within each dataset, rather than between datasets or equivalence to absolute numbers of total cells. Across several studies of human and NHP tissues, we found ISGs upregulated in ACE2 -expressing cells.
Strikingly, by treating primary human upper airway basal cells with distinct types of inflammatory cytokines, we demonstrate that IFN-α drives ACE2 expression. Human influenza infection also induces broader expression of ACE2 in upper airway epithelial cells and is corroborated by publicly available databases. Overall, our data provide motivation to better understand the trade-offs of antiviral and/or IFN therapy in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 in order to balance host restriction, tissue tolerance, and viral enhancement mechanisms ( Davidson et al., 2015; Fung and Liu, 2019; Imai et al., 2005; Iwasaki et al., 2017; Kuba et al., 2005; Lei et al., 2020; Medzhitov et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2014 22.

Importantly, although our findings identify similar cell subsets enriched for Ace2 in mice, neither in vitro nor in vivo IFN-stimulation nor in vivo viral challenge substantially alter Ace2 expression levels. The dynamic, species-specific and multifaceted role of IFN raises implications for pre-clinical COVID-19 disease modeling.

Section: Results

To investigate which cells within human and NHP tissues represent likely SARS-CoV-2 targets, we analyzed new and existing scRNA-seq datasets to assess which cell types express ACE2 , alone or with TMPRSS2 . In a previously unpublished dataset consisting of NHP ( Macaca mulatta ) lung tissue collected after necropsy of healthy adult animals and analyzed by using Seq-Well v1 ( Gierahn et al., 2017 37. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :395-398 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ), we recovered at least 17 distinct major cell types, including various lymphoid, myeloid, and stromal populations ( Figures 1 A–1C; Table S1 ; STAR Methods ). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were primarily expressed in epithelial cells, with 6.7% of type II pneumocytes expressing ACE2 and 3.8% co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figures 1 B and 1C). Notably, the only double-positive cells observed were classified within the type II pneumocyte population; however, we also identified TMPRSS2 expression within club cells, ciliated epithelial cells, and type I pneumocytes, albeit at diminished abundance and frequency compared with type II pneumocytes ( Figure 1 C; Table S1 ).
Next, we compared ACE2 + with ACE2 − type II pneumocytes to explore broader gene programs that differentiate putative SARS-CoV-2 target cells from cells of a similar phenotype and ontogeny ( Figure 1 D; Table S1 ). Among genes significantly upregulated in ACE2 + type II pneumocytes, we observed IFNGR2 (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p = 0.022), a receptor for type II IFNs. Notably, previous work has demonstrated limited anti-viral potency of IFN-γ for SARS-associated coronaviruses, compared with that of type I IFNs, at least in vitro ( Sainz et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2004 106. Sainz, Jr., B. ∙ Mossel, E.C. ∙ Peters, C.J. ... Interferon-beta and interferon-gamma synergistically inhibit the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Virology. 2004; 329 :11-17 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 142. Zheng, B. ∙ He, M.L. ∙ Wong, K.L. ... Potent inhibition of SARS-associated coronavirus (SCOV) infection and replication by type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) but not by type II interferon (IFN-gamma) J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24 :388-390 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other co-regulated genes of potential interest include TRIM27 (FDR-adjusted p = 0.025), as well as NT5DC1 (FDR-adjusted p = 0.003) and ARL6IP1 (FDR-adjusted p = 0.047), which were upregulated in the A549 adenocarcinoma alveolar basal epithelial cell line after exposure to IFN-α and IFN-γ for 6 h ( Sanda et al., 2006 108. Sanda, C. ∙ Weitzel, P. ∙ Tsukahara, T. ... Differential gene induction by type I and type II interferons and their combination J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2006; 26 :462-472 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found IFNAR1 consistently expressed among both ACE2 + type II pneumocytes and ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + co-expressing type II pneumocytes, but its level of upregulation compared with all remaining pneumocytes did not meet statistical significance (FDR-adjusted p = 0.11). This analysis finds ACE2 + cells enriched within a rare fraction of secretory cells in NHPs and that ACE2 expression is co-regulated with genes involved in IFN responses.
To assess whether the findings from NHP lung cells were similarly present in humans, we analyzed a previously unpublished scRNA-seq dataset derived from surgical resections of fibrotic lung tissue collected with Seq-Well S 3 ( Hughes et al., 2019 54. Hughes, T.K. ∙ Wadsworth, M.H. ∙ Gierahn, T.M. ... Highly Efficient, Massively-Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Skin Pathology bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Unsupervised analysis identified multiple cell types and subtypes of immune cells ( Figures 2 A–2C; STAR Methods ), as defined by the genes displayed in Figure 2 C (full lists available in Table S2 ). Here, we found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were primarily expressed within type II pneumocytes and ciliated cells, in line with our analysis of the NHP-derived cells ( Figures 1 and 2 A, 2B). In type II pneumocytes (identified by unique expression of surfactant proteins SFTPC , SFTPB , and SFTPA1 ), we found 1.4% of cells expressing ACE2 (FDR-adjusted p = 1.35E−21), 34.2% expressing TMPRSS2 (FDR-adjusted p < 1E−300), and 0.8% co-expressing both. In ciliated cells, we found 7% were ACE2 + (FDR-adjusted p = 5E−64), 24.6% were TMPRSS2 + (FDR-adjusted p = 3.8E−30), and 5.3% co-expressed both.
As above, to assess for cellular pathways significantly co-expressed within putative target cells for SARS-CoV-2, we computed differentially expressed genes between ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + type II pneumocytes and all other type II pneumocytes ( Figures 2 C and 2D; Table S2 ). We found significant enrichment of BATF among ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells (FDR-adjusted p = 3.25E−7), which has been demonstrated previously to be upregulated by type I and type II IFNs ( Murphy et al., 2013 90. Murphy, T.L. ∙ Tussiwand, R. ∙ Murphy, K.M. Specificity through cooperation: BATF-IRF interactions control immune-regulatory networks Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 :499-509 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Of note, we also observed TRIM28 co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 among type II pneumocytes in this dataset (FDR-adjusted p = 2.34E−9), which might play a role in potentiating an IFN response in lung epithelial cells ( Krischuns et al., 2018 64. Krischuns, T. ∙ Günl, F. ∙ Henschel, L. ... Phosphorylation of TRIM28 Enhances the Expression of IFN-β and Proinflammatory Cytokines During HPAIV Infection of Human Lung Epithelial Cells Front. Immunol. 2018; 9 :2229 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). Within this cohort of donors, 3 individuals were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) + and diagnosed with active tuberculosis, 3 donors had active tuberculosis and were HIV − , and 2 were negative for both pathogens. Surprisingly, we found that all of the ACE2 + cells across all cell types were derived from HIV + Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) + donors despite approximately equivalent recovery of epithelial cell types from all donors (likelihood-ratio test, p = 0.009) ( Figure 2 E). Given limited cell and patient numbers combined with potential sampling biases, we caution that this observation requires much broader cohorts to validate a potential role for co-infections; still, we note our observation is suggestive of a role for chronic IFNs in the induction of ACE2 , given that HIV infection is associated with persistent upregulation of ISGs, and we observed elevated amounts of IFNAR2 , IFI30 , and IKBKB ( Utay and Douek, 2016 124. Utay, N.S. ∙ Douek, D.C. Interferons and HIV Infection: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Pathog. Immun. 2016; 1 :107-116 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) (FDR-adjusted p = 1.1E−6, 8.8E−9, 1.57E−7, respectively; HIV + versus HIV − epithelial cells).
Next, using a previously unpublished scRNA-seq dataset consisting of granuloma and adjacent, uninvolved lung samples from Mtb-infected NHPs ( Macaca fascicularis ) collected with Seq-Well S 3 , we identified subsets of epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 ( Figure S1 ; Table S3 ; STAR Methods ). The majority of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells were, once again, type II pneumocytes (22%) and type I pneumocytes (9.7%) and were largely enriched within granulomatous regions compared with those in adjacent uninvolved lung ( Figures S1 B and S1C) (p = 0.006, Fisher Exact Test). ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + type II pneumocytes expressed significantly higher amounts of antimicrobial effectors such as LCN2 compared with remaining type II pneumocytes ( Figure S1 D). Cells with club cell/secretory, type I pneumocyte, and ciliated cell types also contained some ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells, but we did not have sufficient power to detect significantly differentially expressed genes between these cells and other cells within those clusters. Altogether, we identify ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells in lower airways of humans and NHPs with consistent cellular phenotypes and evidence supporting a potential role for IFN-associated inflammation in upregulation of ACE2 .
Next, we examined several other tissues for ACE2 -expressing cells on the basis of the location of hallmark symptoms of COVID-19, focusing on the gastrointestinal tract due to reports of clinical symptoms and viral shedding ( Xiao et al., 2020 137. Xiao, F. ∙ Tang, M. ∙ Zheng, X. ... Evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2 Gastroenterology. 2020; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (658) Google Scholar ). Leveraging a previously unpublished scRNA-seq atlas of NHP (M. mulatta) tissues collected with Seq-Well v1, we observed that the majority of ACE2 + cells reside in the small intestine, principally within the ileum, jejunum, and, to a lesser extent, the liver and colon ( Figure 3 A; STAR Methods ). Critically, we note that, in this experiment, the dissociation method used on each tissue was optimized to preserve immune cell recovery, and therefore under-sampled stromal and epithelial populations, as well as neurons from the brain. Within the ileum, we identified ACE2 + cells as absorptive enterocytes on the basis of specific expression of ACE2 within cells defined by APOA1 , SI , FABP6 , and ENPEP, among others, by a likelihood-ratio test ( Figures 3 B and 3C) (p < 1E−300, 62% of all absorptive enterocytes; see Table S4 ). All other epithelial subtypes expressed ACE2 to a lesser extent, and variably co-expressed ACE2 with TMPRSS2 (see Table S4 for full statistics).
Persistent viral RNA in rectal swabs has been detected in pediatric infection, even after negative nasopharyngeal tests ( Xu et al., 2020 138. Xu, Y. ∙ Li, X. ∙ Zhu, B. ... Characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and potential evidence for persistent fecal viral shedding Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :502-505 Crossref Scopus (442) PubMed Google Scholar ). In an additional dataset consisting of endoscopic biopsies from the terminal ileum of a human pediatric cohort (n = 13 donors, ranging in age from 10 to 18 years old), collected with 10X 3′ v2, we confirmed a large abundance of ACE2 + cells with selective expression within absorptive enterocytes (29.7% ACE2 + , FDR-adjusted p = 2.46E−100) ( Figures 3 D and 3E; Table S5 ; STAR Methods ). Furthermore, we identified a subset (888 cells, ∼6.5% of all epithelial cells) that co-express both genes ( Figures S2 A–S2C). We performed differential expression testing and GO-term enrichment using these cells relative to matched non-expressers to highlight putative biological functions enriched within them, such as metabolic processes and catalytic activity, and to identify shared phenotypes of ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + ileal cells across both human and NHP cohorts ( Table S5 ). We speculate that viral targeting of these cells, taken from patients without overt clinical viral infection, might help explain intestinal symptoms. Finally, we compared ileal absorptive enterocytes from healthy NHPs and NHPs infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) and then treated for 6 months with anti-retroviral therapy (animal and infection characteristics published in Colonna et al., 2018 18. Colonna, L. ∙ Peterson, C.W. ∙ Schell, J.B. ... Evidence for persistence of the SHIV reservoir early after MHC haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 :4438 Crossref Scopus (2) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( STAR Methods ). We found significant upregulation of ACE2 , STAT1 , and IFI6 within the absorptive enterocytes of SHIV-infected animals (which maintain chronically elevated amounts of IFNs and ISGs) compared with those of uninfected controls (FDR-adjusted p < 2E-7) ( Figure S2 D) ( Deeks et al., 2017; Utay and Douek, 2016 25. Deeks, S.G. ∙ Odorizzi, P.M. ∙ Sekaly, R.P. The interferon paradox: can inhibiting an antiviral mechanism advance an HIV cure? J. Clin. Invest. 2017; 127 :103-105 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar 124. Utay, N.S. ∙ Douek, D.C. Interferons and HIV Infection: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Pathog. Immun. 2016; 1 :107-116 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
To identify potential viral target cells in nasal and sinus tissue, two regions that are frequently primary sites of exposure for coronaviruses, we analyzed existing scRNA-seq datasets from the human upper airway (inferior turbinate and ethmoid sinus mucosa) across a spectrum of healthy donors and individuals with allergic inflammation due to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) collected with Seq-Well v1 ( Figure 4 A; STAR Methods ) ( Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We had previously noted a significantly enriched IFN-dominated gene signature in inferior turbinate secretory epithelial cells from both healthy and CRS donors compared with CRS samples from the ethmoid sinus, which were significantly enriched for interleukin-4 (IL-4)/IL-13 gene signatures ( Giovannini-Chami et al., 2012; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 38. Giovannini-Chami, L. ∙ Marcet, B. ∙ Moreilhon, C. ... Distinct epithelial gene expression phenotypes in childhood respiratory allergy Eur. Respir. J. 2012; 39 :1197-1205 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). We speculate that these cells, taken from clinically non-virally infected patients, yet constantly exposed to environmental viruses, might provide one of the earliest locations for coronaviruses to infect before spreading to other tissues. We observed significant enrichment of ACE2 expression in apical epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, ciliated cells compared with all cell types recovered from surgically resected mucosa (1% of apical epithelial cells, FDR-adjusted p = 4.55E−6, n.s. in ciliated cells) ( Figure 4 B; Table S6 ).
To better map putative SARS-CoV-2 targets among epithelial subsets, we employed a finer-grained clustering method applied to both ethmoid sinus surgical specimens and scrapings from the inferior turbinate and ethmoid sinus ( Figures 4 C–4F). Once again, we observed selective expression of ACE2 within a minority of cell types, with 1.3% of all secretory cells expressing ACE2 ( Figure 4 C) (FDR-adjusted p = 0.00023), specifically sub-clusters 7 and 13, which represent two varieties of secretory epithelial cell ( Figures 4 C, 4F, and 4G). Cluster 7 secretory cells are marked by S100P , LYPD2 , PSCA , CEACAM5 , and STEAP4 ; encompass some MUC5AC goblet cells; and contain the most significantly enriched ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression (4% express ACE2 , FDR-adjusted p = 7.32E−28; 28% express TMPRSS2 , FDR-adjusted p = 2.15E−132; Table S6 ). We next explicitly gated cells by their TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression, identifying a rare subset that co-expresses both, the majority of which fall within the “Secretory Cluster 7” cell type ( Figures 4 E and 4F) (30 cells, ∼0.3% of all upper airway secretory cells, 1.6% of goblet “Secretory Cluster 7”). These findings are aligned with concurrent work by the HCA Lung Biological Network on human nasal scRNA-seq data, which identified nasal secretory cells to be enriched for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ( Sungnak et al., 2020 120. Sungnak, W. ∙ Huang, N. ∙ Becavin, C. ... SARS-CoV-2 Entry Genes Are Most Highly Expressed in Nasal Goblet and Ciliated Cells within Human Airways Nat. Med. 2020; Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although we identified co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in few airway cells overall, we detected ACE2 and TMPRSS2 single- and double-positive cells in over 20 donors and thus posit that these genes are enriched in secretory cells and are not a product of individual-patient-driven variability ( Figure S3 A). Inferior turbinate scrapings collected on Seq-Well S 3 , which increases the resolution of lower-abundance transcripts compared with Seq-Well v1, revealed consistent and specific expression restricted to goblet secretory cells, but at a greater detection frequency in samples from the same donors ( Figure S3 B) ( ACE2 + from 4.7% v1 to 9.8% S 3 ; ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + from 1.9% v1 to 4% S 3 ) ( Hughes et al., 2019 54. Hughes, T.K. ∙ Wadsworth, M.H. ∙ Gierahn, T.M. ... Highly Efficient, Massively-Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Skin Pathology bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Using the gated ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells, we tested for differentially expressed genes compared to the remaining secretory epithelial cells (full results provided in Table S6 ). Notably, we observed significant upregulation of ADAR , GBP2 , OAS1 , JAK1 , and DUOX2 (FDR adjusted, all p < 0.02) within ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells, potentially indicative of IFN signaling ( Figure 4 G). Almost all “Secretory Cluster 7” cells were from inferior turbinate scrapings of healthy and allergically inflamed individuals, few cells were from the ethmoid sinus tissue of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, and no cells were detected in polyp tissue ( Figure 4 H). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of enriched genes in double-positive cells include processes related to intracellular cytoskeleton and macromolecular localization and catabolism, potentially involved in viral particle entry, packaging, and exocytosis ( Fung and Liu, 2019 34. Fung, T.S. ∙ Liu, D.X. Human Coronavirus: Host-Pathogen Interaction Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2019; 73 :529-557 Crossref Scopus (162) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We next utilized IFN-inducible gene sets of relevance to human airway epithelial cells, which we derived from a prior study by performing differential expression on a published dataset where air-liquid interface cultures from primary human nasal epithelial cells were treated with IFN-αA/D, IFN-β1a, IFN-γ, IL-4, or IL-13 ( Giovannini-Chami et al., 2012; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 38. Giovannini-Chami, L. ∙ Marcet, B. ∙ Moreilhon, C. ... Distinct epithelial gene expression phenotypes in childhood respiratory allergy Eur. Respir. J. 2012; 39 :1197-1205 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using these gene lists, we scored the human nasal epithelial cells analyzed by scRNA-seq described in Figures 4 C and 4F and found significant concomitant upregulation of the IFN-α-stimulated gene set within ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + secretory goblet cluster 7 ( Figure 4 I).
The meta-analysis described above consistently identified an association between ACE2 expression and canonical ISGs or components of the IFN-signaling pathway. This prompted us to investigate whether IFNs might play an active role in regulating ACE2 expression levels in specific target cell subsets, thus potentially allowing for a tissue-protective host response or increased viral binding of SARS-CoV-2 through ACE2. Our initial literature search indicated that IFN-γ and IL-4 downregulate the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 in Vero E6 cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells [ de Lang et al., 2006 23. de Lang, A. ∙ Osterhaus, A.D. ∙ Haagmans, B.L. Interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 downregulate expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor ACE2 in Vero E6 cells Virology. 2006; 353 :474-481 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ]), appearing to invalidate this hypothesis. Relatedly, in vitro stimulation of A549 cells, a commonly used cell line model for lung epithelia, with IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IFN-α+IFN-γ for 24 h did not identify ACE2 as an ISG ( Russell et al., 2018 105. Russell, A.B. ∙ Trapnell, C. ∙ Bloom, J.D. Extreme heterogeneity of influenza virus infection in single cells eLife. 2018; 7 :e32303 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ). This is potentially explained by recent work that aimed to understand SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage by performing screening studies within cell line models and found that A549 cells did not express ACE2 and therefore represents a poor model to understand regulation of this gene ( Letko et al., 2020 69. Letko, M. ∙ Marzi, A. ∙ Munster, V. Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5 :562-569 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ). While conducting experiments to directly test the hypothesis that ACE2 is an ISG, we noted in our own gene lists used for scoring from Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar and in a supplementary extended table available from Giovannini-Chami et al., 2012 38. Giovannini-Chami, L. ∙ Marcet, B. ∙ Moreilhon, C. ... Distinct epithelial gene expression phenotypes in childhood respiratory allergy Eur. Respir. J. 2012; 39 :1197-1205 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar that ACE2 was in upregulated gene lists after exposure to Type I IFN.
We directly tested whether IFN-α induces ACE2 in primary human upper airway epithelial cells in greater detail. We cultured human primary basal (stem and progenitors) epithelial cells to confluence and treated them with increasing doses (0.1–10 ng/mL) of IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-13, IL-17A, or IL-1β for 12 h and then performed bulk RNA-seq ( Figure S3 C). Only IFN-α2 and IFN-γ led to upregulation of ACE2 over the time period tested, and compared with all other cytokines, IFN-α2 lead to greater and more significant upregulation over all doses tested ( Figure S3 D,Wilcoxon test: IFN-α2 FDR-adjusted p = 4.1E−07; IFN-γ p = 9.3E-03, Figures S3 E and S3F, all statistical tests compared with 0 ng/mL dose). We confirmed substantial and dose-dependent induction of canonical members of the interferon response after IFN-α2 and IFN-γ ( Figures S3 G and S3H). Conversely, we found that IFN-γ, relative to IFN-α2, induced potent upregulation of GBP5 , a GTPase-like protein thought to act as a viral restriction factor through inhibiting furin-mediated protease activity, which could limit viral processing from infected cells, whereas IFN-α2 more robustly induced IFITM1 ( Figure S3 G–S3K) ( Braun and Sauter, 2019 9. Braun, E. ∙ Sauter, D. Furin-mediated protein processing in infectious diseases and cancer Clin. Transl. Immunology. 2019; 8 :e1073 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further extend and substantiate these findings, as above, we stimulated primary mouse tracheal basal cells, the commonly used human bronchial cell line BEAS-2B, and upper airway basal cells from two human donors ( Figure 5 A-D). We confirmed appropriate induction of an IFN response in each cell type by performing differential expression testing between untreated cells and IFN-treated cells for each condition ( Table S7 ). Within each cell type, stimulation with IFN-α2, IFN-γ, or IFN-β resulted in dose-dependent upregulation of canonical ISGs, including STAT1/Stat1 , BST2/Bst2 , XAF1/Xaf1 , IFI35/Ifi35 , MX1/Mx1 , and GBP2/Gbp2. Notably, Ace2 expression was not robustly induced in basal cells derived from healthy mouse trachea under any interferon stimulation condition ( Figure 5 A). The magnitude of ACE2 upregulation was diminished in BEAS-2B cells compared to that in our original findings in primary human upper airway epithelial cells, but reached statistical significance compared with that of the untreated condition after IFN-γ exposure ( Figure 5 B). In primary basal cells derived from healthy nasal mucosa, we confirmed significant induction of ACE2 after IFN-α2 stimulation and, to a lesser extent, after stimulation with IFN-γ (IFN-α2-stimulated: both Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.001; IFN-γ-stimulated: both Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.05) ( Figures 5 C and 5D). Expression of ACE2 was significantly correlated with expression of STAT1 in all human cell types, with a larger effect size and correlation coefficient in primary human basal cells ( Figure 5 E-H). These experiments support a relationship between induction of the canonical IFN response, including key transcription factors and transcriptional regulation of the ACE2 locus. Finally, among primary human samples, we confirmed the dose-dependence of ACE2 upregulation after IFN-α2 or IFN-γ treatment and significant induction of ACE2 after IFN-α2 stimulation at concentrations as low as 0.1–0.5 ng/mL ( Figure 5 I-L).
Next, using a publicly available resource ( interferome.org ) that hosts genomic and transcriptomic data from cells or tissues treated with IFN, we queried ACE2 expression within human and mouse cells, searching for datasets with a log 2 -fold-change of >1 or < −1 compared with untreated samples, including all IFN types ( Rusinova et al., 2013 104. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). We recovered 21 datasets spanning 8 distinct primary tissues or cell lines with non-trivial changes in ACE2 expression after both type I and type II IFN treatment ( Figure S4 A). We observed substantial upregulation of ACE2 in primary skin and primary bronchial cells treated with either type I or type II IFN (> 5-fold upregulation compared with that in untreated cells), in strong support of our in vitro data ( Figures 5 C, 5D, 5G–5L, and S3 D–S3F). Immune cell types, such as CD4 T cells and macrophages, were noticeably absent from datasets with a significant change in ACE2 expression after IFN stimulation or were even found to downregulate ACE2 (e.g., primary CD4 T cells + type I IFN) ( Figure S4 A, and in our analysis of scRNA-seq peripheral blood mononuclear cell data from Butler et al., (2018) 12. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (1479) PubMed Google Scholar ; data not shown).
Given that the majority of cells robustly upregulating ACE2 were epithelial, this observation potentially explains why previous analyses to define canonical ISGs within immune populations did not identify ACE2 as an induced gene. Furthermore, using both Transcription Factor database (TRANSFAC) data hosted by the interferome database, as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (provided by the ENCODE Factorbook repository), we found evidence for STAT1, STAT3, IRF8, and IRF1 binding sites within −1500–500 bp of the transcription start site of ACE2 (all in human studies, Figure S4 B) ( Gerstein et al., 2012; Matys et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013 36.

This finding is supportive of our current hypothesis that ACE2 represents a previously unappreciated ISG in epithelial cells within barrier tissues.
Given minimal upregulation of Ace2 among primary mouse basal cells in vitro , we were curious as to whether Ace2 represented a murine ISG in vivo . We treated two mice intranasally with saline and two mice intranasally with 10,000 units of IFN-α ( Guerrero-Plata et al., 2005 44. Guerrero-Plata, A. ∙ Baron, S. ∙ Poast, J.S. ... Activity and regulation of alpha interferon in respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus experimental infections J. Virol. 2005; 79 :10190-10199 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 12 h, we isolated the nasal mucosa, consisting of both respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with underlying lamina propria, and performed scRNA-seq using Seq-Well S 3 ( Figure S5 A). We collected from both tissue sites because of early reports of anosmia in COVID-19 ( Lechien et al., 2020 67. Lechien, J.R. ∙ Chiesa-Estomba, C.M. ∙ De Siati, D.R. ... Olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions as a clinical presentation of mild-to-moderate forms of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a multicenter European study Eur. Arch. Otorhinolaryngol. 2020; Crossref Scopus (587) Google Scholar ). We recovered 11,358 single cells, including epithelial, stromal, neuronal, and immune cell types, generating the largest single-cell atlas of mouse respiratory and olfactory mucosa to date ( Figures 6 A and S5 B). We annotated all 36 clusters, focusing our attention on epithelial cell clusters, given that we noted enrichment for Ace2 and Tmprss2 within epithelial cell subsets, consistent with our human and NHP results ( Table S8 ). Specifically, we found Ace2 enriched within olfactory epithelial gland cells, Muc5b + Scgb1c1 + goblet cells, basal epithelial cells, and myofibroblasts/pericytes (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.01) ( Figures 6 B and S5 B) ( Brann et al., 2020; Dear et al., 1991; Montoro et al., 2018; Tepe et al., 2018 8.

Notably, Furin was enriched within olfactory epithelial gland cells ( Table S8 ). Next, we asked whether a 12 h stimulation with IFN-α would upregulate Ace2 in vivo. Focusing on basal epithelial cells, which contain the highest abundance of Ace2 + cells, we found that despite robust upregulation of canonical murine ISGs, Ace2 expression was only slightly elevated after IFN-α treatment ( Figures 6 C, 6D, S5 C, and S5D).
This observation was supported by analysis of scRNA-seq data from 5,558 epithelial cells from the lungs of mice 3–6 days after intranasal infection with murine gamma herpesvirus-68 (MHV68) ( Figure S5 E). Here, we found significant enrichment of Ace2 + cells within type II pneumocytes, in line with our data from NHP and human lungs ( Figures S5 F). We did not observe changes in Ace2 expression among viral-transcript-positive cells or “bystander” type II pneumocytes (those without detectable cell-associated viral RNA in MHV68-infected animals), nor did we see significant alterations in Ace2 + cell abundance among MHV68-infected mice lacking IFN-γR ( Figure S5 G and S5H). These observations were in agreement with our in vitro murine basal cell assay ( Figure 5 A and 5E).
Finally, we sought to validate our hypothesis that ACE2 is upregulated in human epithelial cells during upper airway viral infections, which are known to induce a robust IFN response ( Bailey et al., 2014; Everitt et al., 2012; Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014; Jewell et al., 2010; Russell et al., 2018; Steuerman et al., 2018 4.

Steuerman, Y. ∙ Cohen, M. ∙ Peshes-Yaloz, N. ... Dissection of Influenza Infection In Vivo by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Cell Syst. 2018; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). We re-analyzed a publicly available dataset of RNA-seq from human lung explants isolated after surgical resections that were infected with influenza A virus ex vivo for 24 h. Here, we found that ACE2 expression was significantly correlated with that of SFTPC , supporting our hypothesis that ACE2 is expressed within type II pneumocytes ( Figures 1 C, 2 C, S5 I, and S5J) ( Matos et al., 2019 79. Matos, A.D.R. ∙ Wunderlich, K. ∙ Schloer, S. ... Antiviral potential of human IFN-α subtypes against influenza A H3N2 infection in human lung explants reveals subtype-specific activities Emerg. Microbes Infect. 2019; 8 :1763-1776 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, although the abundance of SFTPC was not significantly altered by influenza A virus infection, ACE2 expression was significantly upregulated after viral exposure (p = 0.0054, ratio paired t test) ( Figures S5 K and S5L). This suggests that influenza A virus infection increases ACE2 expression. Nevertheless, these population-level analyses are not able to definitively resolve specific cell subsets of relevance, nor whether they are directly infected cells or bystanders of infection.
In order to address these questions, we leveraged an ongoing scRNA-seq study of nasal washes from 18 individuals with confirmed influenza A virus or influenza B virus infection or healthy controls collected with Seq-Well v1, which yielded 35,840 cells resolved into 17 distinct cell types ( Figure 6 E; STAR Methods ) ( Cao et al., 2020 13. Cao, Y. ∙ Guo, Z. ∙ Vangala, P. ... Single-cell analysis of upper airway cells reveals host-viral dynamics in influenza infected adults bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We investigated the cell types with greatest enrichment for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in non-infected controls and individuals with influenza A and B. Strikingly, ACE2 was most upregulated in samples from influenza-virus-infected individuals within bystander goblet or squamous cells not directly infected by virus ( Figures 6 F and 6G). ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + goblet cells during influenza infection exhibited enrichment for canonical ISGs such as the CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11 gene cluster; correspondence with ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + goblet cells in healthy and allergic nasal scrapings; and a shared overlap in ISGs including GBP2 , ZNFX1 , ADAR , and ACE2 (significantly differentially expressed gene lists) ( Table S6 ). Together, our data suggest that ACE2 is an ISG in vitro and in vivo in human primary upper airway epithelial basal cells, but that the murine homolog Ace2 is not in airway epithelial basal cells or pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro or in vivo . Collectively, our findings suggest that careful considerations of animal and cellular models will be needed for assessing therapeutic interventions targeting the IFN system when studying ACE2 / Ace2 -associated biology.
Finally, because our in vivo and in vitro work indicate that IFN might promote human cellular targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human upper airway by inducing ACE2 , we attempted to extend our transcriptomic data on IFN-driven expression of ACE2 to protein-level induction of ACE2. As testing of various commercially available polyclonal antibody preparations found broad evidence for non-specific or inconclusive staining in histological immunofluorescent based readouts (data not shown), we assessed whether IFN-γ-stimulated human bronchial air-liquid interface cultures induced ACE2 within 24 h. Our results show that cells from one patient robustly induced ACE2 (+2.02x), cells from another mildly induced ACE2 (+1.21x) and two patient’s cells showed minor changes (+/−1.12x) ( Figure S5 M). We provide a note of caution as these cells were derived from asthmatic patients, and the overall changes did not reach significance. Furthermore, we could not determine cell surface localization of ACE2 but do note that these results align with our transcriptomic data.

Section: Discussion

Here, we utilize scRNA-seq across various barrier tissues and model organisms to identify the potential initial cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To review the data presented: (1) we found that expression of the cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 , is primarily restricted to type II pneumocytes in the lung, absorptive enterocytes within the gut, and goblet secretory cells of the nasal mucosa; (2) ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in respiratory tissues is consistently found only among a rare subset of epithelial cells; (3) we observed similarities in the cellular identities and frequencies of putative SARS-CoV-2 target cells across human and NHP cohorts; (4) we observe increased expression of ACE2 during SHIV and TB infection of NHPs, and HIV/TB co-infection and influenza infection of humans compared with that in matched controls but caution that none of the datasets presented here were designed to answer this specific query. Specific targeting of these cell subsets has only been described for a handful of viruses, including the following: goblet cells by human adenovirus-5p and enterovirus 71, type II pneumocytes by H5N1 avian influenza, and absorptive enterocytes by rotavirus ( Fleming et al., 2014; Good et al., 2019; Holly and Smith, 2018; Weinheimer et al., 2012 33.

Additionally, we provide an overall note of caution when interpreting scRNA-seq data for low abundance transcripts like ACE2 and TMPRSS2 because detection inefficiencies might result in an underestimation of the actual frequencies of ACE2 + or ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells in a tissue. Moreover, the protein amounts of each might differ from their mRNA abundances ( Genshaft et al., 2016; Jovanovic et al., 2015; Rabani et al., 2011; Shalek et al., 2013 35.

Single-cell transcriptomics reveals bimodality in expression and splicing in immune cells Nature. 2013; 498 :236-240 Crossref Scopus (663) PubMed Google Scholar ). We also present datasets separately, given that each study differed in its methods of tissue processing and collection, which can influence the frequency of recovered cell subsets ( STAR Methods ). We provide Table S9 as a summary of ACE2 + and ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells across various datasets. Moreover, we present Figure S6 , which describes statistical modeling and power calculations underlying detection and dropout of ACE2 , to help guide interpretation of these data. This includes an examination of the probability to detect a lowly expressed transcript like ACE2 within a cell, as well as upper bound estimates on the percentage of positive cells within a cluster, considering the effects of transcript counts, sequencing depth, and cell numbers in these calculations ( STAR Methods ).
Whether ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are needed on the same cell or soluble proteases can activate SARS-CoV-2 S protein to invade ACE2 single-positive cells is an area of active inquiry ( Coutard et al., 2020; Letko et al., 2020 20. Coutard, B. ∙ Valle, C. ∙ de Lamballerie, X. ... The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade Antiviral Res. 2020; 176 :104742 Crossref Scopus (387) PubMed Google Scholar 69.

Microbiol. 2020; 5 :562-569 Crossref Scopus (579) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, rapidly evolving literature has identified that SARS-CoV-2-S might have a furin cleavage site, leading to a broader set of host proteases that could mediate S protein activation ( Bugge et al., 2009; Coutard et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020 11.

Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein Cell. 2020; 181 :281-292.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1404) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, because an active S protein has a finite lifetime to find a target cell membrane, the timing and cellular location of S protein activation is key to consider. Activation events proximal to the plasma membrane have been shown to be most effective for SARS-CoV entry ( Shulla et al., 2011 114. Shulla, A. ∙ Heald-Sargent, T. ∙ Subramanya, G. ... A transmembrane serine protease is linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor and activates virus entry J. Virol. 2011; 85 :873-882 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our study finds that type I IFNs, and to a lesser extent type II IFNs, upregulate ACE2. This is based on several lines of evidence: (1) we identified a human goblet secretory cell subset in upper airway nasal epithelium enriched for ACE2 expression to have the highest IFN-α-induced gene signature; (2) we found that IFN-α, and to a lesser extent IFN-β or IFN-γ, induced ACE2 expression in a published dataset of air-liquid interface cultures derived from human nasal epithelial cells ( Giovannini-Chami et al., 2012; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 38. Giovannini-Chami, L. ∙ Marcet, B. ∙ Moreilhon, C. ... Distinct epithelial gene expression phenotypes in childhood respiratory allergy Eur. Respir.

Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ); (3) we extended our search through the Interferome database ( Rusinova et al., 2013 104. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ) and found that, in epithelial barrier tissues, type I IFNs upregulate ACE2 in multiple studies, especially in primary bronchial cells and keratinocytes ( Rusinova et al., 2013 104. Rusinova, I. ∙ Forster, S. ∙ Yu, S. ... Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ); (4) we found two STAT1 binding sites in the promoter of ACE2 ; (5) in our unpublished atlas of SHIV-infected macaques, known to have elevated amounts of chronic IFN signaling, we found ACE2 upregulation in absorptive enterocytes; (6) we directly provided evidence for IFN-α, and to some extent IFN-γ, inducing ACE2 expression in primary human upper airway basal cells; and (7) influenza infection in humans, a known inducer of the IFN pathway, leads to increased ACE2 expression in goblet secretory cells of the nasal epithelium ( Cao et al., 2020 13. Cao, Y. ∙ Guo, Z. ∙ Vangala, P. ... Single-cell analysis of upper airway cells reveals host-viral dynamics in influenza infected adults bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Altogether, our own and publicly available data highlight that ACE2 might have been missed as a canonical ISG because of its notable absence in peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets and in lung-derived transformed cell lines such as the A549 cell line ( Butler et al., 2018; Letko et al., 2020; Rusinova et al., 2013 12. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (1479) PubMed Google Scholar 69. Letko, M. ∙ Marzi, A. ∙ Munster, V.

Interferome v2.0: an updated database of annotated interferon-regulated genes Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 :D1040-D1046 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ). Importantly, other groups have independently analyzed publicly available datasets, some referenced in our work, and observed ACE2’s behavior as an ISG ( Wang and Cheng, 2020 128. Wang, P.-H. ∙ Cheng, Y. Increasing Host Cellular Receptor—Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) Expression by Coronavirus may Facilitate 2019-nCoV Infection bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Furthermore, we found weak IFN- or virally driven induction of Ace2 in murine cells and tissues. This highlights the importance of studying primary human epithelial cells and the careful consideration of appropriately selected gene lists and in vitro models of in vivo cellular systems for understanding human biology ( Jonsdottir and Dijkman, 2016; Mead and Karp, 2019; Regev et al., 2017 60.

As SARS-CoV-S leads to ACE2-receptor-mediated internalization, the host IFN response could thus promote the ability for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to maintain cellular targets in neighboring human upper airway epithelial cells. Altogether along with a study of HCoV-OC43, which co-opts IFN-inducible transmembrane 2 (IFITM2) and IFITM3 to promote viral entry, this adds to the growing evidence that coronaviruses, as well as other viruses, have evolved to leverage features of the human IFN pathway ( Fung and Liu, 2019; Mar et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2014 34.

Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6756-6761 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Whether type I IFNs are net protective or detrimental to the host might depend on the stage of infection; cell subsets in question; the SARS viral clade ( Channappanavar et al., 2016; Channappanavar et al., 2019; Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017; Davidson et al., 2015 14.

Understanding the specific host restriction factors targeting SARS-CoV-2 and identifying specific drivers of these genes in the absence of ACE2 upregulation might provide strategies to dissociate the dual roles of IFN in certain coronavirus infections. Whether IFNs upregulate ACE2 in putative target cell subsets in vivo will be of significant interest to define in future work once current COVID-19-related restrictions on basic scientific inquiry are lifted ( Qian et al., 2013 97. Qian, Z. ∙ Travanty, E.A. ∙ Oko, L. ... Innate immune response of human alveolar type II cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2013; 48 :742-748 Crossref Scopus (90) PubMed Google Scholar ).
ACE2 is a central component of the renin-angiotensin system, which has emerged as a key regulator of sterile- or microbially induced lung pathology ( Imai et al., 2005 55. Imai, Y. ∙ Kuba, K. ∙ Rao, S. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure Nature. 2005; 436 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (1086) PubMed Google Scholar ). In brief, ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II ( Skeggs et al., 1980 115. Skeggs, L.T. ∙ Dorer, F.E. ∙ Levine, M. ... The biochemistry of the renin-angiotensin system Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 130 :1-27 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Angiotensin II then acts to drive acute lung injury through various mechanisms, including increased vascular permeability ( Imai et al., 2005 55. Imai, Y. ∙ Kuba, K. ∙ Rao, S. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from severe acute lung failure Nature. 2005; 436 :112-116 Crossref Scopus (1086) PubMed Google Scholar ). Amounts of angiotensin II in humans and mice are elevated during influenza infection, and ACE2 exerts tissue-protective functions by reducing amounts of angiotensin II ( Zou et al., 2014 143. Zou, Z. ∙ Yan, Y. ∙ Shu, Y. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infections Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3594 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of SARS-CoV-S to mouse ACE2 in vivo reduced ACE2 expression leading to acute acid-aspiration-induced lung failure ( Kuba et al., 2005 65. Kuba, K. ∙ Imai, Y. ∙ Rao, S. ... A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury Nat. Med. 2005; 11 :875-879 Crossref Scopus (1240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Depending on the questions asked in future work, there are mouse models available on the basis of transgenic expression of human ACE2 (required for overt infectious pathology of SARS-CoV in mice), there are established NHP models available of SARS-CoV infection in M. fascicularis and C. aethiops , and early reports suggest symptomatic infection in M. mulatta and M. fascicularis models for SARS-CoV-2 ( Bao et al., 2020; McCray et al., 2007; Munster et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2020; Smits et al., 2011 5.

For example, examining the efficacy of recombinant human ACE2 to act as a decoy receptor or the effect of “ACE inhibitors” in patients with, or at risk for, COVID-19 will require careful experimentation in appropriate models together with well-controlled clinical trials ( Hofmann et al., 2004; Monteil et al., 2020; Vaduganathan et al., 2020 49.

IFN responses that induce ISGs are essential for host antiviral defense in mice, NHPs, and humans ( Bailey et al., 2014; Dupuis et al., 2003; Everitt et al., 2012 4.

Canonical ISGs function by directly restricting viruses and reducing burden ( Schneider et al., 2014 112. Schneider, W.M. ∙ Chevillotte, M.D. ∙ Rice, C.M. Interferon-stimulated genes: a complex web of host defenses Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 32 :513-545 Crossref Scopus (1077) PubMed Google Scholar ). More recently, disease tolerance to equivalent pathogen burden by factors that increase the ability of the host to tolerate tissue damage has been identified as part of a combined host defense strategy ( Iwasaki et al., 2017; Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014; Medzhitov et al., 2012; Schneider and Ayres, 2008 56. Iwasaki, A. ∙ Pillai, P.S. Innate immunity to influenza virus infection Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :315-328 Crossref Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar 57. Iwasaki, A. ∙ Foxman, E.F. ∙ Molony, R.D. Early local immune defences in the respiratory tract Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :7-20 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar 85. Medzhitov, R. ∙ Schneider, D.S. ∙ Soares, M.P. Disease tolerance as a defense strategy Science. 2012; 335 :936-941 Crossref Scopus (812) PubMed Google Scholar 111. Schneider, D.S. ∙ Ayres, J.S. Two ways to survive infection: what resistance and tolerance can teach us about treating infectious diseases Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8 :889-895 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Disease tolerance factors in the lung include IL-22 and amphiregulin ( Iwasaki et al., 2017 57. Iwasaki, A. ∙ Foxman, E.F. ∙ Molony, R.D. Early local immune defences in the respiratory tract Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17 :7-20 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ). During acute infection in the respiratory system, ACE2 is critical for early tissue tolerance responses to respiratory infection, including H5N1 influenza ( Huang et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2014 52. Huang, F. ∙ Guo, J. ∙ Zou, Z. ... Angiotensin II plasma levels are linked to disease severity and predict fatal outcomes in H7N9-infected patients Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3595 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar 143. Zou, Z. ∙ Yan, Y. ∙ Shu, Y. ... Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protects from lethal avian influenza A H5N1 infections Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3594 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, our discovery that ACE2 is an ISG in human epithelial cells, along with SARS-CoV-2 utilizing host ACE2 to gain entry to cells, suggests that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 might exploit the ACE2-mediated tissue-protective response to provide further cellular targets for entry. This potential strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 could present a unique challenge for the human host and is distinct from HCoV-OC43, which targets the two restriction factors IFITM2 and IFITM3 ( Zhao et al., 2014 141. Zhao, X. ∙ Guo, F. ∙ Liu, F. ... Interferon induction of IFITM proteins promotes infection by human coronavirus OC43 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :6756-6761 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study provides motivation to understand the specific role and balance of type I and type II IFNs, as well as type III IFNs, in tissue protection during, and host restriction of, SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key experiments to understand ACE2 as an ISG in tissue protection or genuine tolerance will require the appropriate mouse, NHP, or other model in BSL3 or BSL4 facilities to execute SARS-CoV-2 viral infections and measure host tissue health along with viral loads. Further work will also be needed to understand how co-infections, as well as other host factors, might affect both the susceptibility to, and dynamics of, host SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, carefully controlled clinical trials will be essential to determine the overall effects of different IFNs ( Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2020 95. Prokunina-Olsson, L. ∙ Alphonse, N. ∙ Dickenson, R.E. ... COVID-19 and emerging viral infections: The case for interferon lambda J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200653 Crossref Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Altogether, we anticipate that comprehensive characterization of the putative cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 will be critical to understand basic mechanisms of viral tropism and disease pathophysiology, inform differential susceptibility among vulnerable populations, and potentially suggest unanticipated targets for drug inhibitors of viral infection. The cellular targets we nominate will need to be confirmed by specific reagents for SARS-CoV-2, as done for SARS-CoV ( Ding et al., 2004 27. Ding, Y. ∙ He, L. ∙ Zhang, Q. ... Organ distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in SARS patients: implications for pathogenesis and virus transmission pathways J. Pathol. 2004; 203 :622-630 Crossref Scopus (425) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, the transcriptional response to the virus will need to be rigorously characterized in appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems ( Blanco-Melo et al., 2020 6. Blanco-Melo, D. ∙ Nilsson-Payant, B.E. ∙ Liu, W.-C. ... SARS-CoV-2 launches a unique transcriptional signature from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). We provide gene lists associated with target cells in specific tissues and diseases to aid the community in understanding this emergent disease. A concurrent HCA Lung Biological Network study assessing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across more tissues also identified enrichment in nasal goblet and ciliated cells ( Sungnak et al., 2020 120. Sungnak, W. ∙ Huang, N. ∙ Becavin, C. ... SARS-CoV-2 Entry Genes Are Most Highly Expressed in Nasal Goblet and Ciliated Cells within Human Airways Nat. Med. 2020; Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other studies are considering additional tissues; co-variates such as age, sex, and co-infection state; and represent a large coordinated international effort to the ongoing crisis ( Pinto et al., 2020 94. Pinto, B.G. ∙ Oliveira, A.E. ∙ Singh, Y. ... ACE2 Expression is Increased in the Lungs of Patients with Comorbidities Associated with Severe COVID-19 medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). One study in particular identified upregulation of ACE2 by respiratory viruses and TMPRSS2 by IL-13 in a pediatric cohort, suggesting further links to how underlying allergic conditions or co-infections might modulate these two SARS-CoV-2-related host factors ( Sajuthi et al., 2020 107. Sajuthi, S.P. ∙ DeFord, P. ∙ Jackson, N.D. ... Type 2 and interferon inflammation strongly regulate SARS-CoV-2 related gene expression in the airway epithelium bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
During the preparation of this manuscript, several papers have been posted to bioRxiv assessing patterns of ACE2 + and TMPRSS2 + cells in barrier tissues ( Brann et al., 2020; Lukassen et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020 8. Brann, D. ∙ Tsukahara, T. ∙ Weinreb, C. ... Non-neural expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the olfactory epithelium suggests mechanisms underlying anosmia in COVID-19 patients bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar 74.

The digestive system is a potential route of 2019-nCov infection: a bioinformatics analysis based on single-cell transcriptomes bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). At a high level, these studies are largely in agreement with our report. Furthermore, another study appeared on medRxiv profiling bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients, though they were unable to profile sufficient numbers of epithelial cells ( Liao et al., 2020 72. Liao, M. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Yuan, J. ... The landscape of lung bronchoalveolar immune cells in COVID-19 revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ).
Our study highlights the power of scRNA-seq datasets, both existing and novel, to derive hypotheses relevant to human disease that might differ from paradigms established by using cell lines. Further work will be critical to determine how SARS-CoV-2 influences temporal dynamics of host responses at single-cell resolution and which host factors might affect this ( Kazer et al., 2020 62. Kazer, S.W. ∙ Aicher, T.P. ∙ Muema, D.M. ... Integrated single-cell analysis of multicellular immune dynamics during hyperacute HIV-1 infection Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :511-518 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the unappreciated complexities of host-pathogen interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the best measures to combat this pandemic continue to be surveillance and avoidance—especially given that a deep understanding of the full spectrum of resistance and tolerance mechanisms will require the concerted efforts of scientists around the globe ( Amanat et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020; Hadfield et al., 2018 2. Amanat, F. ∙ Nguyen, T. ∙ Chromikova, V. ... A serological assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in humans medRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar 17.

Hadfield, J. ∙ Megill, C. ∙ Bell, S.M. ... Nextstrain: real-time tracking of pathogen evolution Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :4121-4123 Crossref Scopus (237) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we seek to share our initial findings and data so that other groups might build on this discovery of ACE2 as an ISG and further consider the careful balance between tissue tolerance and viral infection needed at the human airway epithelium.

C57BL/6J mice purchased from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were maintained within Ragon Institute’s HPPF barrier facility and all experiments were conducted with institutional IACUC approval. In this study, mice were 8-10 weeks of age, representing male and female animals.
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). IFNγR−/− mice on C57BL/6 background (C57BL/6, IFNγR −/− B6.129S7- Ifngr1 tm1Agt /J) were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and subsequently bred and propagated under SPF conditions at the Helmholtz Zentrum München. Animals with different genotypes were kept in the same animal room for the time of the experiment including an adaptation period prior to the start of the experiment. All animal experiments were in compliance with the German Animal Welfare Act (German Federal Law §8 Abs. 1 TierSchG), and the protocols were approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee.
Animals were perfused with 0.5 L of PBS/kg immediately following euthanasia, tissues were isolated and placed in RPMI + 10% FBS and kept on ice until dissociation. Tissue sections were digested by mincing and incubating with collagenase IV (Life Technologies) and DNase I (Roche) at 37°C for 1 h with agitation. Digested tissue was passed through a 100 μm metal strainer, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 300 g, rinsed with RPMI + 10% FBS, counted, and prepared as a single cell suspension for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well v1 (see below).
All lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow were ground through a metal strainer, transferred to a conical in RPMI + 10% FBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g x 10 min. LN-derived cells were resuspended in RPMI + 10% FBS, counted and prepared as a single cell suspension. Spleen, bone marrow, and PBMCs were subjected to ACK lysis for 10 min at room temperature, quenched with RPMI + 10% FBS. PBMCs and bone marrow derived cells were purified over a ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare) by centrifuging at 400 g for 20 min at room temperature with no brake. Cells were then resuspended in RPMI + 10% FBS, counted, and diluted for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well v1 (see below).
Ten Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected ( Martin et al., 2017 78. Martin, C.J. ∙ Cadena, A.M. ∙ Leung, V.W. ... Digitally Barcoding Mycobacterium tuberculosis Reveals In Vivo Infection Dynamics in the Macaque Model of Tuberculosis MBio. 2017; 8 :e00312-17 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) adult non-human primates ( M. fascicularis ) were included in this study. A piece of lung tissue (without any grossly visible pathology) and 4 individual TB lung granulomas per animal were excised at necropsy and enzymatically dissociated using the GentleMacs system (Tumor dissociation kit, human; Miltenyi Biotec). Single cell suspensions were resuspended in RPMI + 10% FBS, counted and diluted for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well S 3 (see below).
Surgical samples from diseased lung tissue (n = 3 TB + HIV + ; n = 3 TB + ; n = 2 non-infected patients) were processed as described in ( Ardain et al., 2019 3. Ardain, A. ∙ Domingo-Gonzalez, R. ∙ Das, S. ... Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate early protective immunity against tuberculosis Nature. 2019; 570 :528-532 Crossref Scopus (40) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, each sample was collected into cold RP-10 (RPMI (Sigma-Aldrich) + 10% FBS), minced, and incubated for 25-30 min at 37°C with digestion buffer containing collagenase D (Sigma-Aldrich), DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Following incubation, samples were homogenized using a GentleMACS, filtered using a 70 μm metal strainer, and pelleted by centrifugation at 400 g for 5 min. After obtaining the pellet, cells were resuspended in RP-10, passed through another 70μm strainer (Corning), stained with trypan blue, and then counted and diluted for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well S 3 (see below).
Single-cell suspensions were collected from biopsies as described ( Smillie et al., 2019 116. Smillie, C.S. ∙ Biton, M. ∙ Ordovas-Montanes, J. ... Intra- and Inter-cellular Rewiring of the Human Colon during Ulcerative Colitis Cell. 2019; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (85) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, biopsies were rinsed in cold PBS, the epithelial layer was separated from the underlying lamina propria by end over end rotation for 15 min. The lamina propria and epithelial fractions were digested separately, using Liberase TM (Roche) and DNase I (Roche) for the lamina propria, and TrypLE (ThermoFisher) for the epithelial fraction. Following digestion, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, subjected to ACK lysis for 3 min, and filtered through a 40 μm strainer. Following centrifugation, the cells were counted and prepared as a single cell suspension for scRNA-seq using 10X 3′ v2 (10X Genomics).
Surgical samples from ethmoid sinus and nasal scraping of the inferior turbinate were processed as described ( Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, each sample was collected into cold RPMI (Corning), minced and incubated for 30 min (15 min for nasal scrapings) at 37°C with digestion buffer containing collagenase IV (Worthington), DNase I (Roche) in RPMI with 10% FBS. Samples were triturated and digestion quenched with EDTA. Cells were filtered using a 70 μm metal strainer and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g, rinsed with PBS, and subjected to red blood cell (RBC) lysis using ACK buffer (ThermoFisher) for 3 min on ice, and finally pelleted prepared as a single cell suspension for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well v1 or S 3 (see below).
Mice received either 200ng of IFNα (Biolegend 752802) or saline intranasally (each group n = 2 mice), and were sacrificed 12 h later. Respiratory and olfactory mucosa were isolated as in ( Davidson et al., 2004; Dunston et al., 2013 21. Davidson, D.J. ∙ Gray, M.A. ∙ Kilanowski, F.M. ... Murine epithelial cells: isolation and culture J. Cyst. Fibros. 2004; 3 :59-62 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar 30. Dunston, D. ∙ Ashby, S. ∙ Krosnowski, K. ... An effective manual deboning method to prepare intact mouse nasal tissue with preserved anatomical organization J. Vis. Exp. 2013; Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, using surgical tools under a dissecting microscope, the skull bones surrounding the nasal tissue of skinned mouse heads were removed. The respiratory and olfactory mucosa were collected in RPMI media with 10% FBS. Cells were digested in media containing Liberase TM (Roche) and DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37°C with agitation. Cells were filtered using a 70 μm strainer, washed with EDTA-containing media to quench enzymatic digestion, and pelleted by centrifugation. RBCs were lysed using ACK buffer (ThermoFisher) for 2 min, cells were again pelleted, counted, and prepared as a diluted single cell suspension for scRNA-seq using Seq-Well S 3 .
Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages during the MHV68 infection period. MHV68 stocks were grown and quantified by plaque assay as previously described ( Adler et al., 2000 1. Adler, H. ∙ Messerle, M. ∙ Wagner, M. ... Cloning and mutagenesis of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 genome as an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome J. Virol. 2000; 74 :6964-6974 Crossref Scopus (269) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5 × 10 ∗ 4 plaque forming units of MHV68 diluted in PBS in a total volume of 30 μl. Prior to i.n. infection, mice were anesthetized with medetomidine–midazolam–fentanyl. At the predetermined time points, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lung tissue was processed for subsequent experiments. All lobes were removed, minced and transferred for mild enzymatic digestion for 20-30 min at 37°C in an enzymatic mix containing Dispase (50 caseinolytic U/mL), Collagenase (2 mg/mL), Elastase (1 mg/mL), and DNase I (30 μg/mL). Single cells were harvested by straining the digested tissue suspension through a 70μm strainer. After centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min, single cells were counted, and prepared as a single cell suspension. For Drop-seq, cells were aliquoted in PBS supplemented with 0.04% of bovine serum albumin at a final concentration of 100 cells/μl.
Nasal washes were obtained from adult healthy controls and from adults with diagnosis of acute influenza A or B by rapid antigen test (Flu A or B antigen, direct fluorescence antigen test) and/or by respiratory virus panel (PCR testing for influenza A, influenza A H1, influenza A H3, influenza B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A, respiratory syncytial virus B, rhino/enterovirus, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3), who show symptoms up to seven days ( Cao et al., 2020 13. Cao, Y. ∙ Guo, Z. ∙ Vangala, P. ... Single-cell analysis of upper airway cells reveals host-viral dynamics in influenza infected adults bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Samples were obtained by irrigation of each naris with up to 10 mL of saline, and collected in a single container. The sample was then transported to the research laboratory for processing. Upon receipt, the sample was immediately stored on ice and 10 mL cell growth media (DMEM or RPMI1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum) was added. The material was strained using a 40 μm nylon cell strainer (Corning) into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Cells were pelleted at 1300 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. All but 1 mL of supernatant was discarded, the pellet resuspended in the remaining 1 mL of supernatant, and material was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and pelleted at 2000 rpm for 5 min. If the pellet contained visible blood, 200 μL of RBC lysis solution (ACK buffer, Thermo Fisher) was added to resuspend the pellet and incubated at room temperature for 2 min, after which 1 mL of cell media was added, and the cells were pelleted at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The final pellet was resuspended in up to 1 mL of media and quantified before performing scRNA-seq with Seq-Well v1.
Seq-Well was performed as described ( Gierahn et al., 2017 37. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :395-398 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ). Single cells were diluted to 15,000 cells in 200 μL RPMI + 10% FBS and deposited onto a pre-functionalized PDMS array. 15,000 cells were deposited onto the top of each PDMS array and let settle by gravity into distinct wells. The array was gently washed with PBS, and sealed using a functionalized polycarbonate membrane. Seq-Well arrays were sealed in a dry 37°C oven for 40 min, and submerged in a lysis buffer containing guanidium thiocyanate (Sigma), EDTA, 1% beta-mercaptoethanol and sarkosyl (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Arrays were transferred to hybridization buffer containing NaCl (Fisher Scientific) and agitated for 40 min at room temperature, mRNA capture beads with mRNA hybridized were collected from each Seq-Well array, and beads were resuspended in a master mix for reverse transcription containing Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase and buffer, dNTPs, RNase inhibitor, a 5′ template switch oligonucleotide, and PEG for 30 min at room temperature, and overnight at 52°C with end-over-end rotation. Exonuclease digestion and PCR were carried out as described. Post-whole transcriptome amplification workup involved AMPure XP SPRI bead cleanup occurred at a 0.6 x volume ratio, followed by 0.8x. Library size was analyzed using an Agilent Tapestation hsD5000 kit, confirming the expected peak at ∼1000 bp, and absence of smaller peaks corresponding to primer. Libraries were quantified using Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit and prepared for Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kit using 900 pg of cDNA library as input to tagmentation reactions. Amplified final libraries were purified twice with AMPure XP SPRI beads as before, with a volume ratio of 0.6x followed by 0.8x. Libraries from 2-3 Seq-Well arrays were pooled and sequenced together using a NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit (75 cycles) using a paired end read structure with custom read 1 primer: read 1: 20 bases, read 2: 50 bases, read 1 index: 8 bases.
Seq-Well S 3 modified the following protocol steps from v1, above ( Hughes et al., 2019 54. Hughes, T.K. ∙ Wadsworth, M.H. ∙ Gierahn, T.M. ... Highly Efficient, Massively-Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Skin Pathology bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). First, hybridization buffer was supplanted with 8% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, Sigma). Second, after exonuclease digestion, bead-associated cDNA was denatured for 5 min in 0.2 mM NaOH with end over end rotation. Next, beads were washed with TE + 0.01% tween-20, and second strand synthesis was carried out by resuspending beads in a master mix containing Klenow Fragment (NEB), dNTPs, PEG, and the dN-SMRT oligonucleotide to enable random priming off of the beads.
Single cells were loaded onto 3′ library chips as per the manufacturers protocol for Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library (v2) (10X Genomics). Each biopsy was sequenced on two channels of the 10X Chromium Single Cell Platform, one for the epithelial fraction and the other for the lamina propria fraction in order to recover sufficient numbers of epithelial and lamina propria cells for downstream analyses. An input of 6,000 single cells was added to each channel with a recovery rate of approximately 2,000 cells.
Drop-seq experiments were performed according to the original protocol ( Macosko et al., 2015 76. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, single cells (100/μl) were co-encapsulated in droplets with barcoded beads (120/μl, ChemGenes) at rates of 4000 μl/h. Droplet emulsions were collected for 10-20 min/each prior to droplet breakage by perfluorooctanol (Sigma-Aldrich). After breakage, beads were harvested and the hybridized mRNA transcripts reverse transcribed (Maxima RT, Thermo Fisher). Exonuclease digestion and PCR were carried out as described (12 PCR cycles). For each sample, 1 ng of pre-amplified cDNA from an estimated 1000 cells was tagmented by Nextera XT (Illumina) with a custom P5-primer (Integrated DNA Technologies). Single-cell libraries were sequenced in a 100 bp paired-end run on the Illumina HiSeq4000.
Population RNA-seq was performed as described ( Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018; Trombetta et al., 2014 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar 123. Trombetta, J.J. ∙ Gennert, D. ∙ Lu, D. ... Preparation of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Libraries for Next Generation Sequencing Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 2014; Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, RNA from population lysates was purified using AMPure RNA Clean Spri beads (Beckman Coulter) at a 2.2x volume ratio, and mixed with oligo-dT primer, dNTPs (NEB), and RNase inhibitor (Fisher Scientific) at 72°C for 3 min on a thermal cycler to anneal the 3′ primer to polyadenylated mRNA. Reverse transcription was carried out in a master mix of Maxima RNaseH-minus RT enzyme and buffer (Fisher Scientific), MgCl 2 (Sigma), Betaine (Sigma), RNase inhibitor, and a 5′ template switch oligonucleotide, and PCR was carried out using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems) and IS PCR primer and amplified for 18 cycles. Libraries were purified using AMPure XP SPRI beads at a volume ratio of 0.8x followed by 0.9x. Library size was assessed using a High-Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Bioanalyzer), confirming the expected size distribution of ∼1,000-2,000 bp. Tagmentation reactions were carried out with the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) using 250 pg of cDNA per single cell as input, with modified manufacturer’s instructions as described. Libraries were purified twice with AMPure XP SPRI beads at a volume ratio of 0.9x, size distribution assessed using a High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent Bioanalyzer) and Qubit High-Sensitivity DNA kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were pooled and sequenced using NextSeq500/550 High Output v2 kits (75 cycles, Illumina) using 30-30 paired end sequencing with 8-mer dual indexing.
Data represented in Figures 5 A–5L: Cytokines were added for 12 h overnight at increasing doses (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 ng/mL) of IL-4 (human: Biolegend 574002), IL-17A (human: Biolegend 570502), IFNγ (human: Biolegend 570202; mouse: Peprotech 315-05), IFNα (human: Biolegend 592702; mouse: Biolegend 752802), or IFNβ (mouse: R&D Systems 8234-MB-010). Each condition was run as a biological triplicate. Data represented in Figure S3 C-K: cytokines were added for 12 h overnight at increasing doses (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 ng/mL) of human IL-4 (Biolegend 574004), IL-13 (Biolegend 571104), IFNα (Biolegend 592704), IFNγ (Biolegend 570204), IL-17A (Biolegend 570504), or IL-1β (Biolegend 579404) (each condition run as a biological quadruplicate). All populations were lysed in 50 μL lysis buffer (RLT + 1% BME, QIAGEN and Sigma, respectively) and snap frozen on dry ice. Bulk RNA-seq was performed as described previously and summarized above ( Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018 91. Ordovas-Montanes, J. ∙ Dwyer, D.F. ∙ Nyquist, S.K. ... Allergic inflammatory memory in human respiratory epithelial progenitor cells Nature. 2018; 560 :649-654 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ). Populations were sequenced to an average ± SEM read depth of 3.95 ± 0.11 million reads per sample, with an average ± SEM alignment percentage to either hg19 or mm10 reference transcriptomes of 71 ± 0.3%. All samples met quality thresholds regarding genomic and transcriptomic alignment.
Established air-liquid interface cultures from bronchial brushings of four asthmatic patients were treated with 10ng/μL of human IFNγ for 24 h. Protein lysates were prepared, and anti-ACE2 human antibody (AF933 R&D goat polyclonal) was used to probe for ACE2 by western blot. Bands were normalized to GAPDH as loading control, and fold change was computed based on normalized ACE2 values.
Libraries corresponding to 7 animals (variable number of tissues per animal) were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq. Reads were aligned to the M. mulatta genome assembly 8.0.1 annotation version 102 and processed according to the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq ). Data was normalized and scaled using the Seurat R package v2.3.4 ( https://satijalab.org/seurat/ ): transforming the data to log e (UMI+1) and applying a scale factor of 10,000. To identify major axes of variation within our data, we first examined only highly variable genes across all cells, yielding approximately 1,000-3,000 variable genes with average expression > 0.1 log-normalized UMI across all cells. An approximate principal component analysis was applied to the cells to generate 100 principal components (PCs). Using the JackStraw function within Seurat, we identified significant PCs to be used for subsequent clustering and further dimensionality reduction. For 2D visualization and cell type clustering, we used a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction technique ( https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap ) with “min_dist” set to 0.5 and “n_neighbors” set to 30. To identify clusters of transcriptionally similar cells, we employed unsupervised clustering as described above using the FindClusters tool within the Seurat R package with default parameters and k.param set to 10 and resolution set to 0.5. Each cluster was sub-clustered to identify more granular cell types, requiring each cell type to express > 25 significantly upregulated genes by differential expression test (FindMarkers implemented in Seurat, setting “test.use” to “bimod,” Bonferroni-adjusted p value cutoff < 0.001). Differential expression tests between cells from ACE2 + versus ACE2 - Type II Pneumocytes were conducted using the SCDE R package with default parameters ( Kharchenko et al., 2014 63. Kharchenko, P.V. ∙ Silberstein, L. ∙ Scadden, D.T. Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :740-742 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar ).

Libraries corresponding to 8 donors were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq. Reads were aligned to the hg19 genome assembly and processed according to the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq ). Data was normalized and scaled using the Seurat R package v3.1.0 (https://satijalab.org/seurat/), transforming the data to log e (UMI+1) and applying a scale factor of 10,000. For each array, we assessed the quality of constructed libraries by examining the distribution of reads, genes and transcripts per cell. Variable gene selection, principal components analysis, and selection of significant principal components was performed as above. We visualized our results in a two-dimensional space using UMAP ( https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap ), and annotated each cluster based on the identification of highly expressed genes. To further characterize substructure within cell types (for example, T cells), we performed dimensionality reduction (PCA) and clustering over those cells alone. Sub-clusters (i.e., clusters within broad cell type classifications) were annotated by cross-referencing cluster-defining genes with curated gene lists and online databases SaVanT ( http://newpathways.mcdb.ucla.edu/savant-dev/ ) and GSEA/MsigDB ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp ). Proliferating cells from the human lung ( Figure 2 C) express high levels of mitotic markers, such as MKI67, and represent primarily T cells ( CD3D, CD3E ), B cells/antibody-secreting cells ( IGJ, MZB1, IGHG1 ), and myeloid cells ( CD14, APOE ) and represent a composite cell cluster. Differential expression analysis between ACE2+ TMPRSS2+ and negative type II pneumocytes was performed in Seurat using a likelihood-ratio test (FindMarkers implemented in Seurat, setting “test.use” to bimod). Expression data for epithelial cells included in this dataset can be visualized and downloaded here: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP814?scpbr=the-alexandria-project#study-summary .
Libraries corresponding to 13 donors were sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq S2 with a Read 1 26bp, Read 2 91bp, Index 1 8bp configuration before reads were aligned to GRCh38. Each sample was filtered individually for low quality cells and genes by analyzing distributions of reads, transcripts, percent reads mapped to mitochondrial genes, and complexity per cell, then merged as an outer join to create a single dataset. Clustering and differential expression tests were processed using Seurat v3.1.0 ( https://satijalab.org/seurat/ ). Normalization and variable gene selection was processed with SCTransform ( https://github.com/ChristophH/sctransform ). Clustering for major cell types was performed using Louvain clustering on dimensionally reduced PCA space with resolution set via grid search optimizing for maximum average silhouette score. Due to the scale of the dataset, a randomized subsampling from across the dataset was used to calculate the silhouette score. We annotated clusters based on highly expressed genes, then sub-clusters were characterized by performing PCA dimensionality reduction and clustering over those cells alone, and annotated based on highly expressed genes found via one-versus-rest differential expression test (Wilcoxon) within the major cell type. Differential expression analysis between ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + and negative epithelial cells was performed in Seurat using a Wilcoxon test and Bonferroni p value correction. Expression data for epithelial cells included in this dataset can be visualized and downloaded here: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP812?scpbr=the-alexandria-project#study-summary .

Libraries corresponding to 10 animals (variable number of tissues/animal) were sequenced using Illumina NovaSeq S2. Data was aligned using the Dropseq-tools pipeline on Terra ( app.terra.bio ) to M. fascicularis reference genome assembly 5, annotation version 101. Clustering was performed using Leiden clustering in the Scanpy ( scanpy.readthedocs.io ) package ( Wolf et al., 2018 133. Wolf, F.A. ∙ Angerer, P. ∙ Theis, F.J. SCANPY: large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis Genome Biol. 2018; 19 :15 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). Cell type labels were assigned using known marker genes. In this analysis, we include all epithelial cell subsets (secretory, multiciliated, type II pneumocytes, and type I pneumocytes) from all samples. Differential expression between ACE2 + TMPRSS2 + cells and other cells of the matched cell subtype (e.g., Secretory Cells) were performed using the “bimod” likelihood-ratio test within each cell subtype and filtered on Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected p value < 0.05.

Reads were aligned to the hg19 or mm10 genome assembly using the cumulus platform https://cumulus-doc.readthedocs.io/en/0.12.0/smart_seq_2.html and output as TPM using RSEM v1.3.2. Populations were transformed to transcripts per 10K reads and log2(1+TP10K) transformed. ACE2 expression by stimulation condition and dose were assessed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc testing using a Bonferroni correction. Plots were generated using ggplot2, and transcriptome-wide differential expression was calculated using the Seurat R package v3.1.0 ( https://satijalab.org/seurat ), function FindMarkers with test.use = ”bimod.” Expression data can be visualized and downloaded here:

Libraries corresponding to 4 mice, with 2 Seq-Well arrays per mouse were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq as described ( Gierahn et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2019 37. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat.

Highly Efficient, Massively-Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Skin Pathology bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome and processed according to the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq ). Data was normalized and scaled using the Seurat R package v2.3.4 ( https://satijalab.org/seurat/ ): transforming the data to log e (UMI+1) and applying a scale factor of 10,000. Cells with fewer than 1000 UMIs and 500 unique genes were removed. To identify major axes of variation within our data, we first examined only highly variable genes across all cells, yielding approximately 5,000 variable genes. An approximate principal component analysis was applied to the cells to generate 200 principal components (PCs). Using a combination of the Jackstraw function in Seurat and observing the “elbow” of the standard deviations of PCs, we chose the top 70 PCs for subsequent clustering and visualization. For 2D visualization, we used a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction technique ( https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap ) with “min_dist” set to 0.3 and “n_neighbors” set to 50. To identify clusters of transcriptionally similar cells, we employed unsupervised clustering as described above using the FindClusters tool within the Seurat R package with default parameters and k.param set to 10. Resolution was chosen based on maximization of the average silhouette width across all cells. Clusters were merged if a cell type expressed fewer than 25 significantly upregulated genes by differential expression test (FindAllMarkers implemented in Seurat, setting “test.use” to “bimod,” Bonferroni-adjusted p value cutoff < 0.001). Differential expression tests between cells from saline-treated or IFNa-treated mice were assessed using the FindMarkers function with “test.use” set to “bimod.

Libraries corresponding to 14 mice were aligned to a custom reference genome encompassing both murine (mm10) and herpes virus genes: 84 known genes from MHV68 were retrieved from NCBI (NCBI: txid33708) and added to the mm10 mouse genome. Reads were aligned to the custom joint genome and processed according to the Drop-Seq Computational Protocol v2.0 ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq ). Barcodes with < 200 unique genes, > 20,000 UMI counts, and > 30% of transcript counts derived from mitochondrially encoded genes were discarded. Data analysis was performed using the Scanpy Package following the common procedure, the expression matrices were normalized using scran ’s size factor based approach and log transformed via scanpy’s pp.log1p() function ( Lun et al., 2016; Wolf et al., 2018 75. Lun, A.T. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Marioni, J.C.

SoupX was utilized to reduce ambient RNA bias, using default parameters with pCut set to 0.3, and was applied to each sample before merging the count matrices ( Young and Behjati, 2020 139. Young, M.D. ∙ Behjati, S. SoupX removes ambient RNA contamination from droplet based single-cell RNA sequencing data bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). UMI per cell and cell cycle were regressed out. Highly variable genes were selected by running pp.highly_variable_genes() for each sample separately, returning the top 4,000 variable genes per sample, and genes identified in variable in > 5 samples were retained, yielding 14,305 genes. Next, only Epcam + cells were considered, principal components (PCs) were calculated using only the selected variable genes, and 6 PCs were used to perform unsupervised Louvain clustering. Type I Pneumocytes were excluded from this analysis based on uniformly negative expression of Ace2 , resulting in a final dataset subset of 5,558 cells. Cells were identified as infected if at least one viral read was detected.
Sample processing, sequencing, and analysis was performed as in ( Cao et al., 2020 13. Cao, Y. ∙ Guo, Z. ∙ Vangala, P. ... Single-cell analysis of upper airway cells reveals host-viral dynamics in influenza infected adults bioRxiv. 2020; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). Reads were aligned to the GRCh37 reference genome combined with influenza genomes. Mapped reads from each sample were then corrected for Drop-seq barcode synthesis error using the Drop-seq core computational tools developed by the McCarroll Lab ( Macosko et al., 2015 76. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes were quantified using End Sequence Analysis Toolkit (ESAT, github/garber-lab/ESAT) with parameters -wlen 100 -wOlap 50 -wExt 0 -scPrep ( Derr et al., 2016 26. Derr, A. ∙ Yang, C. ∙ Zilionis, R. ... End Sequence Analysis Toolkit (ESAT) expands the extractable information from single-cell RNA-seq data Genome Res. 2016; 26 :1397-1410 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, UMIs that likely result from sequencing errors were corrected by merging any UMIs that were observed only once and have 1 hamming distance from a UMI detected by two or more aligned reads. Only cell barcodes with more than 1,000 UMIs were analyzed. Cell barcodes with mostly erythrocyte genes ( HBA, HBB ) were removed. From here on, the remaining cell barcodes in the matrix would be referred to as cells. The final gene by cell matrix was normalized using the scran package v3.10 ( Lun et al., 2016 75. Lun, A.T. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Marioni, J.C. A step-by-step workflow for low-level analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data with Bioconductor F1000Res. 2016; 5 :2122 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). The normalized matrix was used for dimensionality reduction by first selecting variable genes that had a high coefficient of variance (CV) and were expressed (> = 1 UMI) by more than three cells. Influenza viral genes, interferon stimulated genes, and cell cycle related genes were removed from the variable gene list in order to minimize the impact of viral responses and mitosis on clustering and cell type identification. This resulted in the selection of 2484 variable genes. t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) was applied to the first ten principal components (PCs), which explained 95% of the total data variance. Density clustering ( Rodriguez and Laio, 2014 102. Rodriguez, A. ∙ Laio, A. Machine learning. Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks Science. 2014; 344 :1492-1496 Crossref Scopus (2143) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed on the resulting tSNE coordinates and identified four major clusters: epithelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages and leukocytes. The epithelial cell cluster and the leukocyte cluster were then re-clustered independently, as described above, to identify populations within each metacluster. Specifically, the epithelial cell cluster was re-embedded using 2629 variable genes selected by the same criteria mentioned in the previous section and 13 PCs that explained 95% of the variance. Density clustering over the epithelial cell subset revealed ten clusters. Differential gene expression analysis using edgeR ( Robinson et al., 2010 100. Robinson, M.D. ∙ McCarthy, D.J. ∙ Smyth, G.K. edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data Bioinformatics. 2010; 26 :139-140 Crossref Scopus (12806) PubMed Google Scholar ) was performed to identify marker genes for each cluster. Influenza-infected and bystander cells were identified after correcting for sample-specific distribution of ambient influenza mRNA contamination and predicted cells most likely to be infected identified using a hurdle zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.
We conducted the following statistical analysis to estimate the effects of various factors on our ability to make confident claims regarding the presence/absence of transcripts of interest (e.g., ACE2 ), both within individual cells and clusters ( Figure S6 ). Specifically, we investigated the roles of capture/reverse transcription efficiency, ACE2 expression level, sequencing depth, and cell numbers. Taken together, the results of this power analysis are in agreement with other efforts to model biological and technical sources of zero-inflation within scRNA-seq data (e.g., https://satijalab.org/howmanycells and Kharchenko et al., 2014; Svensson, 2020 63. Kharchenko, P.V. ∙ Silberstein, L. ∙ Scadden, D.T. Bayesian approach to single-cell differential expression analysis Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :740-742 Crossref Scopus (457) PubMed Google Scholar 121. Svensson, V. Droplet scRNA-seq is not zero-inflated Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 :147-150 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We began by quantifying how likely we are to capture and transcribe at least one ACE2 mRNA molecule, as a function of the number ACE2 mRNA molecules per cell and a protocol’s efficiency ( Figure S6 A). Drop-Seq has a capture/transcription efficiency of ∼10% (as estimated using ERCC spike ins; see ( Macosko et al., 2015 76. Macosko, E.Z. ∙ Basu, A. ∙ Satija, R. ... Highly Parallel Genome-wide Expression Profiling of Individual Cells Using Nanoliter Droplets Cell. 2015; 161 :1202-1214 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2240) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the experimental platforms used in this study are either equivalent (e.g., Seq-Well v1, ( Gierahn et al., 2017 37. Gierahn, T.M. ∙ Wadsworth, 2nd, M.H. ∙ Hughes, T.K. ... Seq-Well: portable, low-cost RNA sequencing of single cells at high throughput Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :395-398 Crossref Scopus (254) PubMed Google Scholar ) or superior (e.g., 10-fold better unique molecule detection, 5-fold better gene detection using Seq-Well S 3 ;( Hughes et al., 2019 54. Hughes, T.K. ∙ Wadsworth, M.H. ∙ Gierahn, T.M. ... Highly Efficient, Massively-Parallel Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular States and Molecular Features of Human Skin Pathology bioRxiv. 2019; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar )). Most relevant to this context, inferior turbinate scrapings were processed using both Seq-Well v1 and Seq-Well S 3 ( Figure S3 B). Importantly, Seq-Well S 3 provided > two-fold increase in the detection frequency of rare ACE2 transcripts (i.e., ACE2 +: 4.7% for v1 versus 9.8% for S 3 ), making it reasonable to expect that such improvements in single-cell experimental technologies have yielded corresponding improvements in capture and transcription efficiency. Based on Drop-Seq’s 10% efficiency, even if ACE2 is expressed at the low level of 5 mRNA molecules per cell (a reasonable order-of-magnitude estimate, given that non-human primate ileum cells had a maximum of 10 ACE2 unique molecules per cell observed via sequencing and an average of 1.93 molecules per cell in expressing cells, see Figures 3 B and 3C), our experimental platforms have a minimum likelihood of 41% to capture and reverse transcribe at least one ACE2 mRNA molecule in any given individual cell. This likelihood rapidly increases if we estimate higher efficiencies for improved scRNA-seq technologies (e.g., 67% likelihood within any individual cell at 20% capture/transcription efficiency, 76% likelihood at 25% efficiency, Figure S6 A). Thus, while transcript drop-out may reduce the fraction of positive cells, with the capture and transcription efficiencies of improved single-cell technologies, the impact is likely to be minor (reads are likely underestimated by up to a factor of ∼2.5x), given a sufficient depth of sequencing (see below). We note that this impacts both clusters deemed to contain and not contain ACE2 + cells, and suggests our percentages are likely lower bounds for true expression (within a factor of ∼2.5x).
Next, we examined the probability of sequencing an ACE2 transcript as a function of read depth and ACE2 ’s fractional abundance in each single cell within our sequencing libraries. First, across two different tissues (non-human primate ileum and lung, representing a high expresser of ACE2 and low expresser, respectively), we calculated the proportion of unique ACE2 molecules in our ACE2 + cells (defined as any cell with at least 1 UMI aligning to ACE2 ) as a fraction of total reads within individual cells to provide an order-of-magnitude estimate for average ACE2 abundance in our single-cell sequencing libraries (i.e., the probability that a read within a cell corresponds to a unique molecule of ACE2 , Figure S6 B). We highlight that by calculating probabilities based on ACE2 unique molecules divided by an individual cell’s total reads, we are providing a conservative estimate for the probability of observing ACE2 as a function of sequencing depth (e.g., as compared to basing these probabilities on ACE2 non-UMI-collapsed reads divided by total reads). Next, we obtained information on the number of reads in these cell populations to provide estimates of average sequencing depths ( Figure S6 C). Using the mean fractional abundances of ACE2 from each tissue ( Figure S6 B) and the mean read depths for all genes ( Figure S6 C), we calculated the probability of detecting at least 1 ACE2 molecule (i.e., P(detecting > 0 ACE2 molecules) = 1 - (1 - ACE2 fractional abundance) Read depth ). This results in a 93.7% probability in ileum-derived cell libraries that contain ACE2 , and a 76.0% probability for lung-derived cell libraries, indicating that our sequencing depths are sufficient to detect ACE2 + cells ( Figure S6 D).
To further evaluate whether our ability to detect ACE2 + cells was an artifact of sequencing depth, we compared the number of ACE2 + cells in a cluster to the mean number of reads across all cells in that same cluster ( Figure S6 E). We did not observe any significant correlation: the ileum cell cluster with the highest number of ACE2 + cells had the lowest sequencing depth of all ileum clusters, and the lung cell cluster with the highest number of ACE2 + cells was approximately average in its read depth (on a log-log scale, Pearson’s r = −0.31, non-significant). Further, when comparing ACE2 + cells to ACE2 - cells within a given tissue, we did not observe a positive correlation between read depth and ACE2 status (i.e., mean ± standard error of the mean, SEM, reads among all lung cells = 28,512 ± 344; mean ± SEM reads among ACE2 + lung cells = 28,553 ± 2,988; mean ± SEM reads among all ileum cells = 14,864 ± 288; mean ± SEM reads among ACE2 + ileum cells = 10,591 ± 441, full statistics on cell depth among ACE2 + cells compared to ACE2 - cells of the same cell type can be found in Table S9 ). Thus, we can be confident that the observed differences in ACE2 + proportions across clusters are not driven by differences in sequencing depth.
Finally, we investigated how observed differences in ACE2 + proportions across clusters might be affected by cell sampling. Using the proportion of ACE2 + cells in a “typical” cluster annotated as being ACE2 positive (i.e., 6.8% in non-human primate type II pneumocytes, Figure 1 ), we calculated the cluster sizes needed to be confident that the probability of observing zero to a few positive cells is unlikely to have arisen by random chance (probabilities calculated under a negative binomial distribution with parameter p = 0.068, Figure S6 E). We found that as cluster sizes approach and exceed 100 cells, the probability of observing zero to a few positive cells rapidly approaches zero, if we assume 6.8% of cells are positive. Further, to examine our confidence in estimating an approximate upper bound (ignoring the impact of protocol inefficiencies discussed above) for the fraction of cells positive in a cluster as a function of the number of cells in that cluster, we also calculated the probability of observing zero (and its complement, probability of observing at least 1) ACE2 + cells as a function of cluster size across true positive proportions ranging from 0.1% to 10% (probabilities calculated under a negative binomial distribution with parameter p = 0.001 to 0.1, representing hypothetical proportions of ACE2 + cells Figure S6 F). Given our typical cluster sizes (on the order of hundreds of cells, exact values provided in Table S9 ), we find that for us to observe 0 ACE2 + cells in a cluster due to sampling artifacts, the fraction of true positives must be ∼1% or less. Thus, these complementary approaches demonstrate that our observed variations in ACE2 + cell proportions across clusters likely reflect underlying biological differences, rather than random chance.
Parameters such as sample size, number of replicates, number of independent experiments, measures of center, dispersion, and precision (mean ± SEM) and statistical significances are reported in Figures and Figure Legends. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Where appropriate, a Bonferroni or FDR correction was used to account for multiple tests, alternative correction methods are noted in the figure legends or Methods. All statistical tests corresponding to differential gene expression are described above and completed using R language for Statistical Computing.
