Title: GPR35 promotes neutrophil recruitment in response to serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA


Abstract: Summary

Rapid neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation is crucial for innate immune responses. Here, we reveal that the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR35 is upregulated in activated neutrophils, and it promotes their migration. GPR35-deficient neutrophils are less recruited from blood vessels into inflamed tissue, and the mice are less efficient in clearing peritoneal bacteria. Using a bioassay, we find that serum and activated platelet supernatant stimulate GPR35, and we identify the platelet-derived serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) as a GPR35 ligand. GPR35 function in neutrophil recruitment is strongly dependent on platelets, with the receptor promoting transmigration across platelet-coated endothelium. Mast cells also attract GPR35 + cells via 5-HIAA. Mice deficient in 5-HIAA show a loss of GPR35-mediated neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissue. These findings identify 5-HIAA as a GPR35 ligand and neutrophil chemoattractant and establish a role for platelet- and mast cell-produced 5-HIAA in cell recruitment to the sites of inflammation and bacterial clearance.

Section: Introduction

Neutrophils are crucial early responders at sites of inflammation, mediating rapid clearance of invading bacteria, and defects in neutrophil recruitment are a cause of recurrent infections in humans ( Etzioni, 2009 23. Etzioni, A. Genetic etiologies of leukocyte adhesion defects Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2009; 21 :481-486 Crossref Scopus (80) PubMed Google Scholar ). Neutrophil recruitment to the sites of inflammation occurs via a multistep cascade ( Nourshargh and Alon, 2014 57. Nourshargh, S. ∙ Alon, R. Leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues Immunity. 2014; 41 :694-707 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (823) PubMed Google Scholar ). Locally, the endothelium upregulates selectins and integrin ligands, whereas, systemically, neutrophils are mobilized from the bone marrow (BM) ( Strydom and Rankin, 2013 82. Strydom, N. ∙ Rankin, S.M. Regulation of circulating neutrophil numbers under homeostasis and in disease J. Innate Immun. 2013; 5 :304-314 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mobilized neutrophils highly express molecules needed for homing, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, chemokine receptors, and integrins. Neutrophils enter into rolling interactions with selectin-expressing endothelium, allowing encounter with chemokines displayed on the endothelium that can then trigger firm integrin-mediated adhesion and crawling ( Nourshargh and Alon, 2014 57. Nourshargh, S. ∙ Alon, R. Leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues Immunity. 2014; 41 :694-707 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (823) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiple additional signals subsequently promote transendothelial migration, and the precise requirements for this step continue to be determined ( Filippi, 2019 26. Filippi, M.D. Neutrophil transendothelial migration: updates and new perspectives Blood. 2019; 133 :2149-2158 Crossref Scopus (152) PubMed Google Scholar ; Girbl et al., 2018 33.

Activated platelets can rapidly adhere to the inflamed endothelium and display P-selectin and integrin ligands, providing additional support for neutrophil attachment ( Deppermann and Kubes, 2018 18.

Immunol. 2018; 9 :2739 Crossref Scopus (92) PubMed Google Scholar ). Platelets also release granules containing numerous mediators, including chemokines and lipids that promote neutrophil adhesion and transmigration steps ( Deppermann and Kubes, 2018 18.

Platelets contribute to neutrophil recruitment to inflamed peritoneum, lymph nodes (LNs), skin, and other sites ( Bogoslowski et al., 2018 8. Bogoslowski, A. ∙ Butcher, E.C. ∙ Kubes, P.

Another cell type that contributes to neutrophil recruitment is the perivascular mast cell. Mast cells can be activated by a range of inflammatory agents, and they promptly release multiple mediators that contribute to mobilizing selectins on endothelial cells, promoting vascular leakiness and chemoattracting neutrophils ( Galli et al., 2020 29.

Immunol. 2014; 14 :478-494 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar ). There is evidence for platelet-mast cell communication across the endothelium, such that activation of one cell type can cause activation of the other ( Karhausen et al., 2020 40. Karhausen, J. ∙ Choi, H.W. ∙ Maddipati, K.R. ... Platelets trigger perivascular mast cell degranulation to cause inflammatory responses and tissue injury Sci.

Allergy. 1987; 58 :226-235 PubMed Google Scholar ).
The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR35 is expressed by various myeloid cell types, as well as by intestinal epithelium, peripheral sensory neurons, adipose, and cardiovascular tissue ( Quon et al., 2020 68. Quon, T. ∙ Lin, L.C. ∙ Ganguly, A. ... Therapeutic opportunities and challenges in targeting the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35 ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2020; 3 :801-812 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). Ligand screening studies have identified multiple candidate ligands for GPR35, the most studied being kynurenic acid (KynA), as well as several synthetic agonists, including Lodoximide ( Deng et al., 2012 17. Deng, H. ∙ Hu, H. ∙ Fang, Y. Multiple tyrosine metabolites are GPR35 agonists Sci. Rep. 2012; 2 :373 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Foata et al., 2020 27.

Pharmacol. 2010; 78 :560-568 Crossref Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has also been suggested to be a GPR35 ligand, with 2-acyl LPA being more active ( Kaya et al., 2020 41. Kaya, B. ∙ Donas, C. ∙ Wuggenig, P. ...

However, the low (micromolar) potency of the identified ligands has led to the view that GPR35 remains an orphan receptor ( Quon et al., 2020 68. Quon, T. ∙ Lin, L.C. ∙ Ganguly, A. ... Therapeutic opportunities and challenges in targeting the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35 ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2020; 3 :801-812 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ). In some studies, GPR35 was reported to couple to Gα 12 /Gα 13 and support Rho activation ( Jenkins et al., 2011 39. Jenkins, L. ∙ Alvarez-Curto, E. ∙ Campbell, K. ...

Zaprinast, a well-known cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is an agonist for GPR35 FEBS Lett. 2006; 580 :5003-5008 Crossref Scopus (123) PubMed Google Scholar ). An in vitro study reported that GPR35 agonism with KynA can promote arrest of monocytes and neutrophils on endothelium under flow conditions ( Barth et al., 2009 5. Barth, M.C. ∙ Ahluwalia, N. ∙ Anderson, T.J. ... Kynurenic acid triggers firm arrest of leukocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :19189-19195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, whether GPR35 mediates neutrophil chemoattraction or recruitment to sites of inflammation in vivo is not known.
Here, we set out to define the significance of GPR35 expression in neutrophils in the context of their trafficking to sites of inflammation and to define ligand requirements for GPR35 function. We found that GPR35 was rapidly upregulated on mobilized neutrophils and that it supported their chemotactic migration. In vivo , GPR35 contributed to the efficiency of neutrophil recruitment to three sites of inflammation and augmented clearance of bacteria from the peritoneum. Using a bioassay, serum and activated platelet supernatant were found to engage GPR35, and we identified the platelet-derived metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) as a nanomolar GPR35 ligand. Platelets were important for GPR35-mediated neutrophil recruitment, and imaging experiments showed GPR35 augmented neutrophil transmigration in regions of platelet accumulation. Mast cells, another source of 5-HIAA, contributed to the GPR35-dependent neutrophil recruitment.
Treatment with serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine to prevent platelet loading with serotonin or with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor to block conversion of serotonin to 5-HIAA overcame GPR35-mediated neutrophil recruitment. Genetic deficiency in the serotonin transporter (SERT) in platelets or of the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph1) in hematopoietic cells also caused loss of GPR35-dependent recruitment. The findings establish GPR35–5-HIAA as a chemoattractant receptor–ligand system that cooperates with other inflammation-induced factors in mediating neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation. In addition, given GPR35 expression across diverse cell types, these data shed light on 5-HIAA as an inflammatory mediator for immune and non-immune cell populations.

Section: Results

Acute peritonitis represents a serious medical condition, and rapid neutrophil recruitment is essential for protection against invading peritoneal pathogens ( Buscher et al., 2016 12. Buscher, K. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Protection from septic peritonitis by rapid neutrophil recruitment through omental high endothelial venules Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10828 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the thioglycolate (TG) model of peritonitis, there is strong neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum that begins in the first hours after TG injection and persists for at least 24 h ( Ajuebor et al., 1999 2. Ajuebor, M.N. ∙ Das, A.M. ∙ Virág, L. ... Role of resident peritoneal macrophages and mast cells in chemokine production and neutrophil migration in acute inflammation: evidence for an inhibitory loop involving endogenous IL-10 J. Immunol. 1999; 162 :1685-1691 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). In a time-course experiment, Gpr35 was more than 10-fold upregulated in peritoneal neutrophils at 2 h and expression had begun to decline by 18 h ( Figure 1 A). Gpr35 expression in blood neutrophils was higher than in immature BM neutrophils and was upregulated after 2 h of mobilization ( Figure 1 A). Staining for total GPR35 protein with an antibody against the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain confirmed that protein expression was strongly upregulated within 2 h ( Figure 1 B). Subcutaneous Listeria monocytogenes inoculation also led to the upregulation of Gpr35 in neutrophils recruited to the draining LNs, whereas skin pricking with a Listeria -contaminated needle led to the GPR35 upregulation in neutrophils recruited to skin ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Analysis of a scRNA-seq dataset ( Xie et al., 2020 92. Xie, X. ∙ Shi, Q. ∙ Wu, P. ... Single-cell transcriptome profiling reveals neutrophil heterogeneity in homeostasis and infection Nat. Immunol. 2020; 21 :1119-1133 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that Gpr35 expression was elevated in neutrophils recruited to the peritoneum in response to E. coli while being minimally expressed in BM neutrophils ( Figures S1 C and S1D). In gene expression data from human neutrophils exposed to the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis ( Schwartz et al., 2013 75. Schwartz, J.T. ∙ Bandyopadhyay, S. ∙ Kobayashi, S.D. ... Francisella tularensis alters human neutrophil gene expression: insights into the molecular basis of delayed neutrophil apoptosis J. Innate Immun. 2013; 5 :124-136 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ), GPR35 was strongly upregulated at 6 h ( Figure S1 E).
In experiments with GPR35 transfected WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells, GPR35-dependent chemotactic responses were detected to micromolar amounts of Lodoxamide and KynA but not to 1-acyl or 2-acyl LPA ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 F, and S1G). Migration could be inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment, in accord with chemotactic migration depending on Gα i -coupling ( Figure S1 H). Additionally, Lodoxamide and high micromolar amounts of KynA—but not LPA—were effective at promoting internalization of GPR35 ( Figures S1 I–S1K). Mobilized neutrophils were also found to transmigrate across an endothelial monolayer to millimolar amounts of KynA in a GPR35-dependent manner ( Figures 1 E and 1F). In accord with previous work ( Barth et al., 2009 5. Barth, M.C. ∙ Ahluwalia, N. ∙ Anderson, T.J. ... Kynurenic acid triggers firm arrest of leukocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :19189-19195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), KynA could promote adhesion of GPR35 + cells to an endothelial monolayer in an integrin-dependent manner ( Figures 1 G and S1 L). These findings demonstrated that GPR35 could function as a pro-migratory and pro-adhesive receptor in mobilized neutrophils, although, as with findings in other contexts ( Barth et al., 2009 5. Barth, M.C. ∙ Ahluwalia, N. ∙ Anderson, T.J. ... Kynurenic acid triggers firm arrest of leukocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :19189-19195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ; Quon et al., 2020 68. Quon, T. ∙ Lin, L.C. ∙ Ganguly, A. ... Therapeutic opportunities and challenges in targeting the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35 ACS Pharmacol. Transl. Sci. 2020; 3 :801-812 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ), the high amounts of KynA required for these actions made it unlikely that it was a physiological ligand.
The ability of GPR35 to support in vitro migration of mobilized neutrophils suggested that it may influence their recruitment to sites of inflammation. Using a mixed transfer approach in mice, GPR35-deficiency led to a 2-fold reduction in neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed peritoneum at 18 h after TG injection ( Figures 2 A, 2B, S2 A, and S2B). Time course studies showed that GPR35 KO cell homing was already reduced at 2 h after TG treatment ( Figure S2 C). Similar findings were obtained for peritoneal homing of endogenous neutrophils in TG immunized GPR35 WT:KO mixed BM chimeras that contain approximately equal frequencies of WT- and GPR35-deficient neutrophils ( Figure S2 D) and also in full GPR35 KO mice ( Figures S2 E and S2F). In peritoneally inflamed GPR35 KO mice, there was an increased frequency of neutrophils in the blood, which is likely a consequence of the reduced peritoneal recruitment ( Figures S2 G and S2H). Total cell numbers in the inflamed peritoneum were not affected by GPR35-deficiency, indicating selectivity in the neutrophil recruitment defect ( Figure S2 I). GPR35-deficient neutrophil recruitment to the peritoneum was also reduced following TNF-induced inflammation ( Figure 2 C). Deficiency in IDO1, an enzyme in the KynA biosynthetic pathway ( Cheong and Sun, 2018 14. Cheong, J.E. ∙ Sun, L. Targeting the IDO1/TDO2-KYN-AhR pathway for cancer immunotherapy - challenges and opportunities Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2018; 39 :307-325 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ), did not alter the GPR35 contribution to neutrophil recruitment ( Figure S2 J). In a second model, we observed a GPR35 KO neutrophil recruitment defect into LNs that were inflamed following s.c. injection with Listeria ( Figures 2 D and S2 K–S2N). A similar defect was observed in recruitment to the site of Listeria injection in the skin ( Figures 2 E and S2 O). BM neutrophil frequency and the surface phenotype of BM and peritoneal neutrophils were unchanged in GPR35-deficient compared with WT ( Figures S3 A–S3C) and migration of BM neutrophils in response to other chemoattractants was unaltered ( Figure S3 D).
Listeria is a cause of peritonitis in humans ( Eisa et al., 2018 21. Eisa, M. ∙ Tefera, K. ∙ Alvanpour, A. Listeria peritonitis and bacteremia in a patient with cholangiocarcinoma IDCases. ID. 2018; 14 , e00430 Google Scholar ; Poulsen et al., 2018 67. Poulsen, H.B. ∙ Steig, T.Á. ∙ Björkman, J.T. ... Peritonitis with Listeria monocytogenes in a patient on automated peritoneal dialysis BMJ Case Rep. 2018; 2018 bcr2017220088 Google Scholar ; Tablang, 2008 83. Tablang, M.V. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis caused by infection with Listeria monocytogenes Case Rep. Gastroenterol. 2008; 2 :321-325 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Following intraperitoneal infection with Listeria , the recruited neutrophils were GPR35 hi ( Figure 2 F), and there was 2-fold less neutrophil recruitment in GPR35-deficient mice ( Figure 2 G). In accord with the defect in neutrophil recruitment, GPR35-deficient mice were less efficient at clearing Listeria from the peritoneum ( Figure 2 H). E. coli is another cause of human peritonitis ( Facciorusso et al., 2019 24. Facciorusso, A. ∙ Antonino, M. ∙ Orsitto, E. ... Primary and secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: current state of the art Expert Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2019; 13 :751-759 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ). GPR35 KO neutrophils were less efficiently recruited to the E. coli infected peritoneum ( Figure 2 I), and GPR35-deficient mice were less able to clear the bacteria ( Figures 2 J and 2K). Ablation of neutrophils prior to the bacterial infections caused a loss of the GPR35 KO phenotype, consistent with GPR35 being required in neutrophils for bacterial clearance ( Figures 2 H and 2K). Using mixed BM chimeric mice in which the only lineage fully deficient in GPR35 was neutrophils, we again observed a defect in clearance of bacteria from the peritoneum (Figure 2L).
In the peritoneal inflammation experiments, all the neutrophils measured in the peritoneal lavage fluid are extravascular. Many neutrophils enter the peritoneum via the omentum, a sheet-like tissue composed of mesothelial cells and containing adipocytes, endothelial cells, and aggregates of macrophages and lymphocytes in so-called “milky spots” ( Buscher et al., 2016 12. Buscher, K. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Protection from septic peritonitis by rapid neutrophil recruitment through omental high endothelial venules Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10828 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ; Jackson-Jones et al., 2020 37. Jackson-Jones, L.H. ∙ Smith, P. ∙ Portman, J.R. ... Stromal cells covering omental fat-associated lymphoid clusters trigger formation of neutrophil aggregates to capture peritoneal contaminants Immunity. 2020; 52 :700-715.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (54) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flow cytometric analysis of intravascularly labeled cells showed that a significantly greater fraction of the GPR35-deficient neutrophils in the omentum were blood exposed 2 h after transfer ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Taken together, the findings suggested that the reduced accumulation of extravascular neutrophils in the peritoneum reflected reduced migration from vessels into omental tissue and not reduced attachment to the endothelium.
Intravital 2-photon microscopy was employed to gain dynamic information regarding the post-attachment recruitment step that was affected by GPR35-deficiency. To permit visualization of WT and GPR35-deficient neutrophils in the same animals, BM from Mrp8-Cre × mTmG mice in which neutrophils express GFP was mixed with BM from GPR35-deficient mice and used to reconstitute irradiated WT recipients. To permit visualization of all neutrophils, mice were pretreated with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated Ly6G antibody. Imaging of the omentum in these BM chimeras showed that GPR35-deficient neutrophils were less efficient at moving from the vessel lumen into the parenchyma ( Figures 3 C–3F; videos S1 and S2 ). Similar observations were made with transferred fluorescently labeled neutrophils ( video S3 ), although the low frequencies of transferred cells in each imaging volume made this approach less quantitative. Figure 3 G shows a zoomed-in view of a transmigration event. GPR35 KO neutrophil track speed within vessels was increased ( Figure S4 A), whereas no differences were observed in total cell track speed that included many cells in the parenchyma ( Figure S4 B). Microscopy on the skin of WT:GPR35 KO mixed BM chimeras showed a similar dependence on GPR35 for neutrophil movement from blood vessel into tissue ( Figures S4 C–S4F; video S4 ), and the cells showed a trend for increased speed ( Figure S4 G); in this tissue, total GPR35-deficient cells also had a slightly increased track speed ( Figure S4 H). These data suggest that GPR35 contributes, along with other chemoattractant factors, to promoting transendothelial migration of activated neutrophils and that this activity involves a reduction in speed perhaps due to GPR35-promoting increased adhesion of crawling cells.

Using an in vitro migration-based bioassay, we screened tissue extracts for GPR35 ligand activity and found activity in serum ( Figure 4 A). Serum is made up of plasma and the contents of activated platelets. Serum had stronger GPR35 ligand activity than plasma, consistent with platelets functioning as a source of ligand ( Figure 4 A). Indeed, activated platelet supernatant promoted attraction of GPR35 + cells ( Figures 4 B and 4C). Platelet supernatant was also able to cause GPR35 internalization ( Figure S5 A). Platelets have not been identified as a source of KynA and have minimal expression of KynA synthetic enzymes ( Manne et al., 2020 52. Manne, B.K. ∙ Denorme, F. ∙ Middleton, E.A. ...

Immunol. 2018; 8 :1957 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ), but they are an important reservoir of gut-derived serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine), another tryptophan metabolite ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Serotonin was inactive in recruiting GPR35 + cells ( Figure S5 B) in accord with earlier data ( Wang et al., 2006 89. Wang, J. ∙ Simonavicius, N. ∙ Wu, X. ... Kynurenic acid as a ligand for orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35 J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281 :22021-22028 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (538) PubMed Google Scholar ). Platelets express monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), and they metabolize serotonin into 5-HIAA, and their dense granules contain 5-HIAA, as well as serotonin ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pletscher, 1968 65. Pletscher, A. Metabolism, transfer and storage of 5-hydroxytryptamine in blood platelets Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1968; 32 :1-16 Crossref Scopus (228) PubMed Google Scholar ; Shad and Saeed, 2007 77. Shad, K.F. ∙ Saeed, S.A. The metabolism of serotonin in neuronal cells in culture and platelets Exp. Brain Res. 2007; 183 :411-416 Crossref Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Strikingly, 5-HIAA was a potent chemoattractant of mouse and human GPR35 + cells ( Figures 4 D, 4E, and S5 C), and it could promote GPR35 + cell adhesion to endothelial monolayers ( Figure S5 D). 5-HIAA was also effective in promoting activated neutrophil migration ( Figure 4 F) and their transmigration across an endothelial monolayer in a GPR35-dependent manner ( Figure S5 E). Mixing CXCL1 and 5-HIAA had an additive effect in promoting activated neutrophil adhesion and transmigration ( Figures S5 F and S5G). Confirming that 5-HIAA was acting as a GPR35-ligand, it caused internalization of the murine and human receptor from the cell surface in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it did not internalize a control GPCR ( Figures 4 G–4I and S5 H).
Since platelet-derived 5-HIAA could promote migration of GPR35 + cells in vitro , we explored the contribution of platelets to GPR35-mediated neutrophil recruitment in vivo . By real-time imaging of PF4-Cre + mTmG reporter mice that harbor GFP + platelets, a dense accumulation of platelets was observed on the inflamed endothelium in the omentum ( Figure 5 A), as well as in LNs and skin ( Figure S6 A). Neutrophils were observed attached to platelet-coated endothelial surfaces and often crossed the endothelium in these regions ( Figure 5 A; videos S5 and S6 ). GPR35-deficient neutrophils showed reduced association with platelets and most notably, reduced transmigration in platelet-rich regions ( Figures 5 A and S6 B; videos S5 and S6 ). Quantitation showed that GPR35-deficient cells had reduced platelet contact and reduced total time in contact and a greater distance of transmigrating cells from platelets ( Figures 5 B, 5C, S6 C, and S6D). Neutrophil interaction with platelets can lead to neutrophils acquiring platelet membrane markers ( Page and Pitchford, 2013 62. Page, C. ∙ Pitchford, S. Neutrophil and platelet complexes and their relevance to neutrophil recruitment and activation Int. Immunopharmacol. 2013; 17 :1176-1184 Crossref Scopus (108) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flow cytometric analysis showed reduced acquisition of the platelet marker CD41 (Itga2b/GPIIb) by GPR35-deficient neutrophils in peritoneally inflamed mice, consistent with the reduced intravascular neutrophil-platelet contact ( Figures 5 D and S6 E).

Neutrophil transfers into platelet-deficient mice showed that GPR35 was less able to augment neutrophil recruitment to inflamed skin since wild-type and GPR35 KO cells were recruited more similarly ( Figure 5 E). Moreover, WT, but not KO neutrophils, showed higher labeling by intravascular antibody in skin-inflamed platelet-deficient mice, indicating less efficient movement from blood vessels into the tissue parenchyma ( Figure 5 F). Enumeration of the recruited transferred cells confirmed the platelet dependence of GPR35 function and showed that platelet deficiency had a further effect on neutrophil recruitment ( Figure S6 F), consistent with multiple platelet-derived factors being involved in recruitment. A similar platelet dependence of GPR35 function was observed in Listeria -inflamed LNs ( Figure 5 G). Homing to peritoneum could not be readily studied in platelet-deficient mice due to the strong inflammation frequently causing blood leakage into the peritoneum in the absence of platelets. Taken together, these data strongly implicate platelets, likely acting as a source of 5-HIAA, in GPR35-mediated neutrophil recruitment.
Platelets do not synthesize serotonin but acquire it from intestinal epithelial cells ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ). The one peripheral cell type beyond intestinal epithelium that highly expresses Tph1 and synthesizes serotonin is the mast cell ( Herr et al., 2017 35. Herr, N. ∙ Bode, C. ∙ Duerschmied, D.

Commun. 2020; 11 :463 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mast cells also express MAO ( Immgen.org ), and a few studies have suggested that they can be a source of 5-HIAA ( Freitag et al., 1995 28. Freitag, A. ∙ Wessler, I. ∙ Racke, K. Characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine release from isolated rabbit and rat trachea: the role of neuroendocrine epithelia cells and mast cells Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.

Sjoerdsma, A. ∙ Waalkes, T.P. ∙ Weissbach, H. Serotonin and histamine in mast cells Science. 1957; 125 :1202-1203 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that activation of peritoneal mast cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to generation of extracellular 5-HIAA and the mast cell supernatant was active in attracting GPR35 + cells ( Figures 6 A and 6B). The P815 mastocytoma cell line constitutively released 5-HIAA ( Figure 6 C). Treatment with anti-5-HIAA blocked GPR35-dependent cell migration to mast cell supernatants and to serum ( Figures 6 D and 6E). We then observed that mast cell-deficient mice supported reduced GPR35-dependent recruitment of neutrophils to Listeria -inflamed skin ( Figure 6 F). Intravascular labeling showed that the GPR35-dependent exit of cells from the skin vascular compartment required mast cells ( Figure 6 G). Listeria inoculation in the skin caused rapid mast cell activation, measured by CD63 upregulation ( Figure 6 H). To examine the sufficiency of mast cell-derived 5-HIAA to promote neutrophil recruitment, we performed experiments in platelet-depleted mice. Listeria induced less mast cell activation in platelet-depleted mice ( Figure 6 H), in accord with the evidence that platelets trigger activation of perivascular mast cells ( Karhausen et al., 2020 40. Karhausen, J. ∙ Choi, H.W. ∙ Maddipati, K.R. ... Platelets trigger perivascular mast cell degranulation to cause inflammatory responses and tissue injury Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 , eaay6314 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ). Treatment of Listeria inoculated platelet-depleted mice with the mast cell-triggering compound 48/80 ( Freitag et al., 1995 28. Freitag, A. ∙ Wessler, I. ∙ Racke, K. Characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine release from isolated rabbit and rat trachea: the role of neuroendocrine epithelia cells and mast cells Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 353 :55-63 Crossref Scopus (10) PubMed Google Scholar ) was able to restore mast cell activation ( Figure 6 H), and this treatment increased the GPR35-dependence of neutrophil recruitment ( Figure 6 I). Additionally, injection of 5-HIAA into the skin of mast cell-deficient mice at the same time as Listeria inoculation promoted GPR35-dependent neutrophil recruitment, determined both by the efficiency of recruitment of transferred cells ( Figure 6 J) and by enumerating the recruitment of endogenous neutrophils ( Figure 6 K). These data are consistent with the possibility of mast cell-derived 5-HIAA cooperating with platelet-derived 5-HIAA during neutrophil recruitment.
Fluoxetine (Prozac™) is a serotonin uptake inhibitor and chronic fluoxetine treatment is well established to prevent serotonin accumulation (and 5-HIAA generation) selectively in platelets due to their lacking Tph1 and acquiring intestinal serotonin from circulation ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three week treatment of mice with fluoxetine reduced the recruitment of transferred WT neutrophils to the inflamed skin but did not cause further reduction in recruitment of GPR35 KO cells when assessed as a percent of total cells recruited ( Figures 7 A and 7B). This was also seen when the data were plotted as a recruitment index ( Figure 7 C). Treatment with phenelzine to inhibit MAO and block serotonin conversion to 5-HIAA in both platelets and mast cells ( Bortolato et al., 2008 10. Bortolato, M. ∙ Chen, K. ∙ Shih, J.C. Monoamine oxidase inactivation: from pathophysiology to therapeutics Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60 :1527-1533 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar ) had a similar effect in reducing the percent of WT but not causing significant further reduction in the percent of GPR35-deficient neutrophil recruitment ( Figures 7 A–7C). Plotting the numbers of WT neutrophils recruited showed strong reductions after both fluoxetine and phenelzine treatment ( Figure S7 A). Significantly less GPR35 KO cells were recruited under control treatment conditions, but there was a trend toward a further reduction after fluoxetine treatment and a significant further reduction after phenelzine treatment ( Figure S7 A). GPR35-independent effects of drug treatment are consistent with the contributions of platelet-derived serotonin to neutrophil recruitment ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Duerschmied et al., 2013 20. Duerschmied, D. ∙ Suidan, G.L. ∙ Demers, M. ... Platelet serotonin promotes the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of acute inflammation in mice Blood. 2013; 121 :1008-1015 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kubes and Gaboury, 1996 43. Kubes, P. ∙ Gaboury, J.P. Rapid mast cell activation causes leukocyte-dependent and -independent permeability alterations Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271 :H2438-H2446 PubMed Google Scholar ). Intravascular labeling in inflamed mice showed that the intravascular accumulation bias of GPR35-deficient skin neutrophils observed in control recipients was lost in phenelzine-treated recipients ( Figures 7 D and 7E). Fluoxetine and phenelzine treatment also reduced the skin homing efficiency of endogenous neutrophils, and there was increased intravascular labeling of neutrophils in the inflamed skin ( Figures 7 F and 7G). Importantly, supernatant from activated platelets purified from fluoxetine or phenelzine-treated mice was less effective in promoting GPR35-dependent chemotaxis ( Figure 7 H) and contained significantly reduced amounts of 5-HIAA ( Figure 7 I).
As an MAO inhibitor, phenelzine would be expected to reduce 5-HIAA production by both platelets and mast cells. We, therefore, treated platelet-deficient mice with phenelzine in an attempt to measure the impact of blocking mast cell generation of 5-HIAA. Although Listeria was less effective in promoting mast cell activation and GPR35-dependent neutrophil recruitment in the absence of platelets, some mast cell activation did occur ( Figure 6 F), and there was a trend for a GPR35 contribution to the recruitment in the absence of platelets ( Figures 5 E and 6 I). In accord with the detection of some platelet independent GPR35 recruitment activity, phenelzine treatment of platelet-deficient mice led to a reduction in Listeria -induced neutrophil recruitment to the skin ( Figure 7 J).
In another approach, mice were treated with a large intravenous dose of 5-HIAA to disrupt endogenous 5-HIAA gradients. Two hours after the treatment, the plasma 5-HIAA concentration was in the near-micromolar range ( Figure S7 B), well above the low nanomolar concentration found in normal mouse and human plasma ( Figure S7 B) ( Callebert et al., 2006 13.

Acta. 2014; 428 :38-43 Crossref Scopus (49) PubMed Google Scholar ). This treatment caused reduced recruitment of transferred WT but not GPR35-deficient neutrophils to the inflamed skin and peritoneum ( Figures S7 C and S7D). The treatment also reduced homing of endogenous WT neutrophils to the inflamed peritoneum ( Figure S7 E) and skin ( Figure S7 F). In contrast, treatment with an equivalent dose of KynA was without effect ( Figure S7 G). The 5-HIAA treatment did not alter the frequency of neutrophils, including marginated cells, in lungs, spleen, or BM ( Figures S7 H and S7I).
Next, we examined SERT KO mice that lack 5-HIAA in platelets ( Bengel et al., 1998 6. Bengel, D. ∙ Murphy, D.L. ∙ Andrews, A.M. ...

In accordance with the fluoxetine treatment results, there was reduced GPR35-dependent homing of transferred neutrophils to the inflamed skin of SERT KO mice ( Figures 7 K and S8 A) and reduced recruitment of endogenous neutrophils ( Figure S8 B). To confirm that this reflected a role for SERT in platelets, we examined mixed BM chimeras where full SERT deficiency was restricted to platelets. As in SERT KO mice, there was reduced GPR35-dependent neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed ear skin ( Figures S8 C–S8E).
To genetically disable 5-HIAA production in mast cells, we reconstituted lethally irradiated WT mice with BM from Tph1 KO mice ( Côté et al., 2003 16. Côté, F. ∙ Thévenot, E. ∙ Fligny, C. ...

USA. 2003; 100 :13525-13530 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ). Such chimeric mice retain Tph1 expression in gut epithelium, the source of platelet 5-HIAA ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mast cells from the Tph1 KO BM chimeras were confirmed to have significantly reduced ability to produce 5-HIAA ( Figure S8 F). Tph1 KO BM chimeras showed reduced GPR35-dependent recruitment of transferred neutrophils to Listeria inoculated ear skin ( Figures 7 L and S8 G) and reduced recruitment of endogenous neutrophils ( S8 H). Taken together, these data indicate that 5-HIAA is an in vivo ligand of GPR35, and they provide the evidence that both platelets and mast cells contribute to 5-HIAA production at sites of inflammation.

Section: Discussion

This study reveals that the major serotonin metabolite, 5-HIAA, acts as a physiological ligand for GPR35 and thereby promotes neutrophil recruitment to the sites of inflammation and bacterial clearance. Our data suggest that platelet- and mast cell-derived 5-HIAA cooperate non-redundantly in neutrophil recruitment, working with other mediators produced by these cells. In the simplest model, we propose that platelet-derived 5-HIAA promotes adhesion of crawling neutrophils in association with platelet clusters and that mast cell-derived 5-HIAA provides directional signals during transmigration. The ability of platelets and mast cells to cross-activate each other may amplify these events ( Karhausen et al., 2020 40. Karhausen, J. ∙ Choi, H.W. ∙ Maddipati, K.R. ...

Schwartz, L.B. Mediators of human mast cells and human mast cell subsets Ann. Allergy. 1987; 58 :226-235 PubMed Google Scholar ). Our study does not fully exclude the roles for other cell types as sources of neutrophil-recruiting 5-HIAA. GPR35 and 5-HIAA are likely to contribute to the recruitment of additional GPR35 + blood cells, such as monocytes, to sites of inflammation, and they may also guide myeloid cell migration within tissues ( Barth et al., 2009 5.

Serotonin was discovered over 70 years ago, and it is known to have wide ranging influences on animal physiology, but 5-HIAA has been considered to merely be its waste metabolite ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bortolato et al., 2010 11.

(Editors) Handbook of Behavioral Neurobiology of Serotonin Elsevier, 2010; 203-218 Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar ). Our findings add to the nascent evidence that 5-HIAA is itself an intercellular signaling molecule, with one study suggesting that it acts as a ligand for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( Rosser et al., 2020 71. Rosser, E.C. ∙ Piper, C.J.M. ∙ Matei, D.E. ... Microbiota-derived metabolites suppress arthritis by amplifying aryl-hydrocarbon receptor activation in regulatory B cells Cell Metab. 2020; 31 :837-851.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (315) PubMed Google Scholar ) and work in C. elegans suggesting that it modulates RAS/MAPK signaling ( Schmid et al., 2015 73. Schmid, T. ∙ Snoek, L.B. ∙ Fröhli, E. ... Systemic regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling by the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA PLOS Genet. 2015; 11 , e1005236 Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar ). Serotonin acts on the endothelium to promote vascular leakiness and leukocyte rolling interactions, with the latter involving mobilization of endothelial cell adhesion molecules ( Askenase et al., 1980 3. Askenase, P.W. ∙ Bursztajn, S. ∙ Gershon, M.D. ... T cell-dependent mast cell degranulation and release of serotonin in murine delayed-type hypersensitivity J. Exp.

Kubes, P. ∙ Gaboury, J.P. Rapid mast cell activation causes leukocyte-dependent and -independent permeability alterations Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271 :H2438-H2446 PubMed Google Scholar ). We suggest that serotonin and 5-HIAA may often cooperate during the neutrophil recruitment process. Our findings prompt the need to consider how widely used serotonin (and thus 5-HIAA) modulating drugs ( Berger et al., 2009 7. Berger, M. ∙ Gray, J.A. ∙ Roth, B.L. The expanded biology of serotonin Annu. Rev. Med. 2009; 60 :355-366 Crossref Scopus (1447) PubMed Google Scholar ; Bortolato et al., 2008 10. Bortolato, M. ∙ Chen, K. ∙ Shih, J.C. Monoamine oxidase inactivation: from pathophysiology to therapeutics Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60 :1527-1533 Crossref Scopus (504) PubMed Google Scholar ) or neuroendocrine tumors that lead to markedly elevated plasma 5-HIAA ( Lindström et al., 2018 48. Lindström, M. ∙ Tohmola, N. ∙ Renkonen, R. ... Comparison of serum serotonin and serum 5-HIAA LC-MS/MS assays in the diagnosis of serotonin producing neuroendocrine neoplasms: a pilot study Clin. Chim. Acta. 2018; 482 :78-83 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ) influence GPR35-mediated processes. Depending on the inflammatory condition, reduced neutrophil recruitment in mice treated chronically with fluoxetine may reflect reduced rolling-mediated attachment to the less activated endothelium ( Duerschmied et al., 2013 20. Duerschmied, D. ∙ Suidan, G.L. ∙ Demers, M. ... Platelet serotonin promotes the recruitment of neutrophils to sites of acute inflammation in mice Blood. 2013; 121 :1008-1015 Crossref Scopus (251) PubMed Google Scholar ), as well as reduced GPR35 function. Although serotonin has been suggested to act directly on neutrophils ( Herr et al., 2017 35. Herr, N. ∙ Bode, C. ∙ Duerschmied, D. The effects of serotonin in immune cells Front. Cardiovasc. Med. 2017; 4 :48 Crossref Scopus (310) PubMed Google Scholar ), there is a lack of genetic evidence that neutrophils functionally express serotonin receptors. We suggest that the putative direct actions of serotonin modulators on neutrophils instead involve reductions in 5-HIAA and thus GPR35 function. The doses of fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) used to treat psychiatric conditions in patients may not be sufficient to fully deplete platelets of serotonin and 5-HIAA. However, evidence exists for increased bacterial infections in some SSRI-treated patients and for the occasional development of skin lesions, conditions consistent with reduced neutrophil function ( Herstowska et al., 2014 36. Herstowska, M. ∙ Komorowska, O. ∙ Cubała, W.J. ... Severe skin complications in patients treated with antidepressants: a literature review Postepy Dermatol.

Rogers, M.A. ∙ Greene, M.T. ∙ Young, V.B. ... Depression, antidepressant medications, and risk of Clostridium difficile infection BMC Med. 2013; 11 :121 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our finding of an intraluminal enrichment of GPR35-deficient versus WT neutrophils at sites of inflammation suggests that GPR35 deficiency does not impede attachment to the endothelium. However, our findings do not exclude the possibility, suggested based on in vitro data ( Barth et al., 2009 5. Barth, M.C. ∙ Ahluwalia, N. ∙ Anderson, T.J. ... Kynurenic acid triggers firm arrest of leukocytes to vascular endothelium under flow conditions J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 :19189-19195 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (127) PubMed Google Scholar ), that GPR35 contributes to the neutrophil rolling-to-sticking transition under some conditions. Platelets are a source of multiple neutrophil recruitment factors, including platelet activating factor, adhesion molecules, and chemokines ( Slaba and Kubes, 2017 79. Slaba, I. ∙ Kubes, P. Platelets and immunity Gresele, P. ∙ Kleiman, N.S. ∙ Lopez, J.A. ... (Editors) Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-Thrombotic Disorders: Pathophysiology, Pharmacology and Therapeutics: an Update Springer International Publishing), 2017; 489-512 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ), and 5-HIAA must act in concert with these factors to promote adhesion of crawling neutrophils in association with platelets and their subsequent transmigration across endothelium. Multiple reports have established that platelets augment neutrophil transendothelial migration into tissue, and although their contribution of P-selectin and integrin ligands are well established ( Slaba and Kubes, 2017 79. Slaba, I. ∙ Kubes, P. Platelets and immunity Gresele, P. ∙ Kleiman, N.S. ∙ Lopez, J.A. ... (Editors) Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-Thrombotic Disorders: Pathophysiology, Pharmacology and Therapeutics: an Update Springer International Publishing), 2017; 489-512 Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar ), how the chemoattractive mediators augment the transendothelial migration step remains less understood. As with other platelet-derived chemoattractants, it is unclear whether platelet 5-HIAA is only acting intralumenally, or whether the continual loss of luminal molecules in blood flow allows a transendothelial gradient to be established. In this regard it is notable that platelets were the principal source of serotonin in inflamed tissue of mast cell-deficient mice ( Geba et al., 1996 31. Geba, G.P. ∙ Ptak, W. ∙ Anderson, G.M. ... Delayed-type hypersensitivity in mast cell-deficient mice: dependence on platelets for expression of contact sensitivity J. Immunol. 1996; 157 :557-565 PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to platelets, mast cells also produce multiple neutrophil chemoattractants ( Galli et al., 2020 29. Galli, S.J. ∙ Gaudenzio, N. ∙ Tsai, M. Mast cells in inflammation and disease: recent progress and ongoing concerns Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 38 :49-77 Crossref Scopus (192) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wernersson and Pejler, 2014 90. Wernersson, S. ∙ Pejler, G. Mast cell secretory granules: armed for battle Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :478-494 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar ), raising interesting questions about how individual factors have non-redundant roles during the recruitment process. Early cell depletion and drug treatment studies implicated platelet- and mast cell-derived serotonin in cell recruitment events associated with delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) ( Askenase et al., 1980 3. Askenase, P.W. ∙ Bursztajn, S. ∙ Gershon, M.D. ... T cell-dependent mast cell degranulation and release of serotonin in murine delayed-type hypersensitivity J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152 :1358-1374 Crossref Scopus (154) PubMed Google Scholar , 1983 4. Askenase, P.W. ∙ Van Loveren, H. ∙ Kraeuter-Kops, S. ...

Geba, G.P. ∙ Ptak, W. ∙ Anderson, G.M. ... Delayed-type hypersensitivity in mast cell-deficient mice: dependence on platelets for expression of contact sensitivity J. Immunol. 1996; 157 :557-565 PubMed Google Scholar ). It seems likely that 5-HIAA will also be involved in the DTH response. It will be important to determine the mechanism of 5-HIAA release from mast cells and whether it can be triggered differentially from histamine release, as has been suggested for serotonin ( Meixiong et al., 2019 53. Meixiong, J. ∙ Anderson, M. ∙ Limjunyawong, N. ... Activation of mast-cell-expressed mas-related G-protein-coupled receptors drives non-histaminergic itch Immunity. 2019; 50 :1163-1171.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (225) PubMed Google Scholar ; Theoharides et al., 1982 86.

Moreover, whether mast cell Tph1 and MAO continue to act following mast cell activation and thereby allow ongoing 5-HIAA production need investigation.
Although the production of serotonin by murine mast cells is well established, production by human mast cells has been questioned ( Sjoerdsma et al., 1957 78. Sjoerdsma, A. ∙ Waalkes, T.P. ∙ Weissbach, H. Serotonin and histamine in mast cells Science. 1957; 125 :1202-1203 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, subsequent work showed serotonin in the supernatant of human mast cells in amounts within 5-fold of those produced by mouse mast cells ( Enerbäck, 1963 22. Enerbäck, L. Serotonin in human mast cells Nature. 1963; 197 :610-611 Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar ; Kushnir-Sukhov et al., 2007 44. Kushnir-Sukhov, N.M. ∙ Brown, J.M. ∙ Wu, Y. ... Human mast cells are capable of serotonin synthesis and release J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2007; 119 :498-499 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wernersson and Pejler, 2014 90. Wernersson, S. ∙ Pejler, G. Mast cell secretory granules: armed for battle Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :478-494 Crossref Scopus (737) PubMed Google Scholar ). A proteomic study revealed that MAO-B is one of the proteins most enriched in human and mouse mast cells compared with non-mast cells ( Plum et al., 2020 66. Plum, T. ∙ Wang, X. ∙ Rettel, M. ... Human mast cell proteome reveals unique lineage, putative functions, and structural basis for cell ablation Immunity. 2020; 52 :404-416.e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Moreover, many patients with mastocytosis had elevated serum serotonin, and patients with urticaria pigmentosa (a condition of elevated skin mast cell activity) had elevated circulating 5-HIAA ( Kushnir-Sukhov et al., 2007 44. Kushnir-Sukhov, N.M. ∙ Brown, J.M. ∙ Wu, Y. ... Human mast cells are capable of serotonin synthesis and release J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2007; 119 :498-499 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ; Morishima, 1970 54.

Therefore, we contend that, similar to the mouse mast cells, human mast cells contribute to 5-HIAA production and GPR35-mediated cell recruitment at sites of inflammation, but further study of this topic is needed.
GPR35 has been shown to influence intestinal inflammation and colon cancer development, as well as cardiac, vascular, and adipose tissue function ( Agudelo et al., 2018 1.

Some of these effects may involve actions in myeloid cells, whereas others may occur through actions in the epithelium or other GPR35-expressing cell types. By identifying 5-HIAA as an in vivo ligand for GPR35, our findings will enable advances in understanding actions of GPR35 in physiology and disease. Moreover, this ligand-receptor axis might be targeted by next generation drugs, such as MAO-inhibitors, with reduced blood brain barrier permeability ( Gealageas et al., 2018 30. Gealageas, R. ∙ Devineau, A. ∙ So, P.P.L. ... Development of novel monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors with reduced blood-brain barrier permeability for the potential management of noncentral nervous system (CNS) diseases J. Med. Chem. 2018; 61 :7043-7064 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ) to modulate GPR35 + cell responses in the context of infections, autoinflammatory diseases, sensory neuron responses, and cancer.
Although we provide extensive functional evidence that 5-HIAA is a GPR35 ligand, we have not performed binding studies. It will be of interest in the future to determine the 5-HIAA-binding constants using purified GPR35 protein. We also do not exclude the possibility that other metabolites of serotonin or related amines may function as GPR35 ligands under some conditions. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine and genetic deficiency in SERT reduce platelet serotonin content, whereas phenelzine treatment may increase the same, and both conditions can lead to increases in plasma serotonin. By comparing WT- and GPR35-deficient neutrophil migration in the same animals, indirect (systemic) effects of the drug treatments or SERT deficiency are controlled for, but a co-dependence of the observed effects on altered serotonin levels, as well as 5-HIAA levels, cannot be excluded. This is also the case for possible effects of reduced hematopoietic serotonin production in Tph1-deficient BM chimeras.

C57BL/6J and BoyJ (CD45.1) mice were bred in an internal colony and 7–12-week-old mice of both sexes were used. Gpr35 −/− mice were obtained from EMMA (EM09677; Gpr35tm1b(EUCOMM)Hmgu) and maintained on a B6 background. C57BL/6-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(HBEGF)Awai/J (iDTR mice) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Platelet-deficient mice ( c- mpl −/− ), Pf4-Cre x mTmG (Gt(ROSA)26Sor tm4(ACTB-tdTomato,-EGFP)Luo /J) platelet reporter mice ( Lefrançais et al., 2017 46. Lefrançais, E. ∙ Ortiz-Muñoz, G. ∙ Caudrillier, A. ... The lung is a site of platelet biogenesis and a reservoir for haematopoietic progenitors Nature. 2017; 544 :105-109 Crossref Scopus (769) PubMed Google Scholar ) and Mrp8-Cre x mTmG neutrophil reporter mice ( Lefrançais et al., 2018 45. Lefrançais, E. ∙ Mallavia, B. ∙ Zhuo, H. ... Maladaptive role of neutrophil extracellular traps in pathogen-induced lung injury JCI Insight. 2018; 3 , e98178 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ) were all on a B6 background. Mast cell-deficient Kit/v x Kit/W mice and SERT-deficient mice ( Bengel et al., 1998 6. Bengel, D. ∙ Murphy, D.L. ∙ Andrews, A.M. ... Altered brain serotonin homeostasis and locomotor insensitivity to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“Ecstasy”) in serotonin transporter-deficient mice Mol.

Côté, F. ∙ Thévenot, E. ∙ Fligny, C. ... Disruption of the nonneuronal tph1 gene demonstrates the importance of peripheral serotonin in cardiac function Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :13525-13530 Crossref Scopus (349) PubMed Google Scholar ) BM was provided by Huaquing Wang and Waliul Khan (McMaster Univ.). Littermate controls (WT and HET) were used for experiments, mice were allocated to control and experimental groups randomly, sample sizes were chosen based on previous experience to obtain reproducible results and the investigators were not blinded.
In co-transfer experiments, purified WT and KO neutrophils were stained for 30 min at 37°C with Cell trace Violet (#C34557, Fisher), CMTMR (#C2927, ThermoFisher), CFSE (#C34554, ThermoFisher), or Deep red (#C34565, Life Tech) as indicated and mixed 50:50 before injection (0.5-3 x 10 7 neutrophil / mouse in 200ul saline), 30 min before i.p. TG. To induce peritonitis, mice were injected i.p. with either 1ml of thioglycolate 4% (Sigma), 500ng TNF in 500μl saline (Biolegend) or 1x10 5 CFUs Listeria or 1x10 4 CFUs E.coli in 500μl saline. To stimulate neutrophil recruitment to draining LNs, mice were s.c. injected with 5 x 10 6 CFUs in 40μl saline. To boost neutrophil homing to the skin, anesthetized mice were ear-pricked (20 time/ear) with Listeria -contaminated needles (27G). To deplete platelet 5-HIAA, mice were treated for 3 weeks with Fluoxetine (160mg/L dissolved in drinking water, #1279804, Millipore Sigma) before skin-pricking, similarly to what has been previously reported ( Cloutier et al., 2012 15. Cloutier, N. ∙ Paré, A. ∙ Farndale, R.W. ... Platelets can enhance vascular permeability Blood. 2012; 120 :1334-1343 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ; Musgrave et al., 2011 55. Musgrave, T. ∙ Benson, C. ∙ Wong, G. ... The MAO inhibitor phenelzine improves functional outcomes in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) Brain Behav. Immun. 2011; 25 :1677-1688 Crossref Scopus (62) PubMed Google Scholar ). To deplete total generation of 5-HIAA, mice were treated with two i.p. doses of Phenelzine (30mg/kg, #P6777, Millipore Sigma) at -18hr and -1hr before skin-pricking. To disrupt 5-HIAA or Kynurenic acid in vivo gradients, 200μl saline containing 100μM 5-HIAA or Kynurenic acid (Sigma) were injected i.v. 10 min before i.p. TNF treatment. To produce mixed chimeras, CD45.1 congenic Boy/J mice were lethally irradiated with 1300 rad in split doses and reconstituted with 5 × 10 6 BM cells (∼50:50) as indicated. Mice were analyzed 6–7 weeks later. Animals were housed in a pathogen-free environment in the Laboratory Animal Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco, and all experiments conformed to ethical principles and guidelines that were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. To generate mice with full GPR35-deficiency restricted to neutrophils, MRP8-Cre x iDTR BM was mixed 1:1 with GPR35 WT or KO BM and used to reconstitute WT mice. After 6 weeks reconstitution the chimeras were treated with 400ng diptheria toxin i.v. (DT) at d-1 and with 80ng DT i.v. 2hr before infection with Listeria . iDTR-expressing neutrophil depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry. To deplete platelets, mice were treated with 2ug/g of anti-CD42b depleting antibody (Emfret Analytics) 24 hr before the experiment. Platelet-deficient or platelet-depleted mice showed extensive peritoneal bleeding after i.p. TG or TNF injection, resulting in animals having to be euthanized within 12-18hrs after injection. Therefore, all data with platelet deficient or depleted mice were obtained using the skin model. To locally activate mast cells, 50μl of compound 48/80 (50μg/ml, Sigma) were injected s.c. 5 min before Listeria pricking. In indicated experiments, mast cell-deficient mice were injected s.c.with 2uM 5-HIAA (or DMSO) in 20ul in the ear skin immediately before Listeria skin-pricking.
Neutrophils were identified as either Ly6G + Ly6C + CD11b + or Ly6G + CD11b + cells as indicated, using the following antibodies: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ly6C (AL-21, #553104, BD); APC-Cy7-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ly6G (1A8, TONBO); BV785-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD11b (M1/70, #101243, BioLegend) and APC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CXCR2 (SA044G4, #149312, BioLegend). PE rat anti-mouse CD45.1 (A20, 110708, Biolegend) and FITC rat anti-mouse CD45.2 antibody (104,109805, BioLegend). FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD11a (I21/7, #153105, BioLegend); Biotin-conjugated rat-anti mouse CD18 (C71/16, #557439, BD); FITC-conjugated rat anti mouse LFA-1 (REA880, #130-114-422, Miltenyi Biotec); APC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CXCR2 (SA044G4, #149311, BioLegend); PE-Cy7-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD62L (Mel-14, #104418, BioLegend); BV421-conjugated rat anti-mouse PSGL1 (2PH1, #562807, BD). To analyze mast cells, PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD117 (2B8, #553355, Fisher) and FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD63 (NVG-2, #143920, BioLegend) were used.
To identify intravascular cells, 2 μg / 200μl saline of PE- conjugated anti-mouse CD45.2 (104, #109808, Biolegend) were injected 2 min before sacrifice as indicated. For flow cytometry staining, cells were placed in a 96-well round bottom plate and washed with staining buffer (PBS containing 2% NBCS and 0.5 mM EDTA), and 40 μl of antibody cocktail was added to each sample for 20 min on ice. After incubation, cells were washed twice with staining buffer. For staining of the N-terminal OX56 tag, a 1:200 dilution of a biotinylated OX56 antibody (Bio X Cell) was placed on the cells for 25 min on ice, after which the cells were washed and a 1:200 dilution of streptavidin–PE (#405203, BioLegend) was incubated with the cells for 20 min. To identify Thy1.1 reporter expression, AF647-conjugated anti-mouse/rat CD90.1 (#202508) was used. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GPR35 was produced by Biomatik (using as immunogen the C terminus peptide: MAREFQEASKPATSSNTPHKSQDSQILSLT) and affinity-purified. To reduce staining background, anti-GPR35 polyclonal antibody was pre-absorbed against GPR35 KO splenocytes overnight at 4°C. Cells were surface-stained, fixed and permeabilized (eBioscience™, #00552100) before intracellular staining. AF647-Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Ab (A21245, Fisher Scientific) was used as secondary antibody. To quantify neutrophil-platelet interaction, 100 μl of blood were obtained by retro-orbital bleeding (heparinized capillaries) and drawn into tubes containing 1ml of Lyse/Fix Buffer 5X (Ox-7, #558049, BioLegend) and incubated for 15 min. Cells were than wash and resuspended in staining buffer. FITC- conjugated anti-mouse CD41 (MWReg30, # 133903, BioLegend) was used to stain neutrophils that had acquired membrane-bound platelet. Data were acquired using a BD LSR II flow cytometer or a Cytek Aurora. A BD FACSAria II was used to sort murine Ly6G + CD11b + CXCR2 + neutrophils (purity >96%). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using Flowjo (v.10.6.2).
Murine and human GPR35 were cloned into the murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-GFP retroviral vector (mGPR35-GFP or hGPR35-Thy1.1). The retroviruses encoding mGPR35-GFP/hGPR35-Thy1.1 were produced using the Platinum-E packaging cell line, as previously described ( Lu et al., 2019 49. Lu, E. ∙ Wolfreys, F.D. ∙ Muppidi, J.R. ... S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione is a ligand for human B cell-confinement receptor P2RY8 Nature. 2019; 567 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 5 × 10 5 WEHI-231 cells were placed in a 6-well plate along with the retroviral supernatant and the cells were centrifuged at 1,340g (2,400 r.p.m.) for 2 h at room temperature. This spinfection was repeated with fresh retrovirus for a second time 24 h later. Then, 48 h after the second spinfection, the highest 3% of GFP/Thy1.1-expressing cells were sorted using a BD FACSAria II. These cells were combined with GFP/Thy1.1-negative cells in a ∼1:1 ratio to run transwell migration assays.
HEK293T and bEND3 cells were grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine and 50 IU/L penicillin/streptomycin. WEHI-231 were grown in upright T25 flasks in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM glutamine, 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 50 U penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines were previously obtained from other laboratories and further authentication was not performed. The cell lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination. To test the activity of 2-acyl LPA, empty vector (EV) or Lipase member H (LIPH)-transfected HEK293T cells were grown out in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and allowed to reach confluence. The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium (RPMI containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM HEPES) and tested in the bioassay. LIPH is also known as PA-PLA1 and it catalyzes removal of the sn-1 acyl chain from phosphatidic acid to generate 2-acyl LPA ( Sonoda et al., 2002 81. Sonoda, H. ∙ Aoki, J. ∙ Hiramatsu, T. ... A novel phosphatidic acid-selective phospholipase A1 that produces lysophosphatidic acid J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 :34254-34263 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (180) PubMed Google Scholar ). For transfection of HEK293T cells, mouse Liph was cloned into an MSCV-Thy1.1 retroviral vector, similarly to what previously described ( Lu et al., 2019 49. Lu, E. ∙ Wolfreys, F.D. ∙ Muppidi, J.R. ... S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione is a ligand for human B cell-confinement receptor P2RY8 Nature. 2019; 567 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, HEK293T cells were seeded into 10-cm tissue culture dishes and grown until 75% confluent in antibiotic-free medium. Plasmids were aliquoted in Opti-MEM, then mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (at 6 μl per 3 μg plasmid) and allowed to sit for 25 min at room temperature. The mixtures were gently added dropwise to the HEK293T cells. Then, 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium. To inhibit Gαi-signaling, GPR35-GFP and control WEHI-231 cells were pre-treated with 100ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX, #181, List Biological Labs, Inc) for 30 min at 37°C before running the transwell migration assay. P815 mastocytoma cells were used as a mast cell-like cell line. To block 5-HIAA-driven migration, anti-5-HIAA polyclonal antibody (My-bio-Source) was used at 2ug/ml.
Lodoxamide (#SML2307), Kynurenic acid (#K3375), 18:1 LPA (#L7260), and 5-HIAA (#H8876) were purchased from Sigma. Serotonin (#14332) was purchased from Cayman Chemical.
Total RNA from sorted BM, blood or peritoneal neutrophils was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase. qPCR was performed using Power SYBR Green with an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus instrument. Data were analyzed with the comparative Ct (2−ΔΔCt) method, using the housekeeping genes indicated in the figures.
Control and GPR35-transduced WEHI-231 cells were taken from T25 flask cultures, washed twice in pre-warmed migration medium (RPMI containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 50 IU/L penicillin/streptomycin) and mixed 50:50. The cells were resuspended in migration medium at 2 × 10 6 cells / ml and resensitized for 10 min in a 37 °C water bath in migration medium (0.5% fatty-acid free BSA, 10mM Hepes RPMI). Transwell filters (6 mm insert, 5 μm pore size, Corning) were placed on top of each well, and 100 μl containing 2 × 10 5 cells of GPR35–GFP/ control WEHI-231 cell mix was added to the transwell insert. The cells were allowed to migrate for 3 hr, after which the cells in the bottom well were counted by flow cytometry. For neutrophil transwell migration assay, peritoneal cells from WT-CD45.1 / GPR35 KO mixed chimeras (2hr after TG) were diluted at 2 × 10 6 cells / ml in 0.5% fatty-acid free BSA, 0.5% FBS (migration plus) medium. Preliminary experiments established that inclusion of a low amount of FBS was necessary to maintain viability of the neutrophils during the assay. Representative experiments for each migration assay are plotted as a percentage of input migration. The baseline migration between experiments differs based on the growth state of the WEHI-231 cells.
To perform a neutrophil in vitro transmigration assay, bEND3 cells were trypsinized and resuspended at 4-5x10 5 / ml in complete medium. 24 well plate containing 0.6ml complete (10%FCS) medium per well were prepared, transwells (5um) were inserted in the plates and 100ul of bEND3 cell mix were gently pipetted on each transwell (5um, Corning). Cells were allowed to grow on transwells for 48 hrs. Confluent bEND3-containing transwells were stimulated for 1hr with TNF (100ng/ml) before the assay. After activation, excess medium was removed, transwells were washed twice and placed in new 24-well plates containing indicated dilutions if migration stimuli. Peritoneal cells (2hr after TG) were diluted at 2x10 6 / ml and 100ul of peritoneal cell mix in migration medium were gently pipetted on bEND3 transwells. Cells were allowed to migrate for 2hr at 37°C. Cells and migration stimuli were diluted in 0.5% FBS migration plus medium. Data are plotted as % of input migration. To perform neutrophil or WEHI-231 adhesion assays, 3x10 4 bEND3 cells /well were seeded in flat 96 well plates for 24hr. Confluent bEND3-containing wells were stimulated for 1hr with TNF (100ng/ml) before the assay. After activation, bEND3 monolayers were washed and 50ul of chemokine solutions (2x) were added. Peritoneal cells (2hr after TG) or WEHI-231 were prepared at 2x10 6 / ml in migration medium and 50ul of cell mix was gently pipetted on bEND3 layer and incubated at 37°C for 45 minutes. Monolayers were then gently washed with migration medium (5x) and 100ul of 5mM EDTA solution was added to each well and incubated for 15 min on ice. Harvested cells were centrifuged, washed and resuspended in FACS buffer for flow cytometry analysis. To test integrin dependency, cells were inhibited with 20ug/ml of anti-aL and anti-a4 blocking antibody (BioXcell) for 15 min at 37°C before the assay. Cells and migration stimuli were diluted in 0.5% migration plus medium. Data are plotted as % of input migration.
Murine and human GPR35 were cloned into an MSCV-GFP/Thy1.1 retroviral vector with an N-terminal OX56 epitope tag ( Lu et al., 2019 49. Lu, E. ∙ Wolfreys, F.D. ∙ Muppidi, J.R. ... S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione is a ligand for human B cell-confinement receptor P2RY8 Nature. 2019; 567 :244-248 Crossref Scopus (59) PubMed Google Scholar ) to track surface expression levels of each receptor. Both receptors were transduced into WEHI-231 cells. Confluent cultures of each of the lines indicated above were washed twice in migration medium, resuspended at 5 × 10 6 cells ml −1 and resensitized at 37 °C for 10 min. For each line, 50 μl of cells was aliquoted into a 96-well plate. Stimuli were prepared in migration medium and 50-μl aliquots were placed into a 96-well round bottom plate that was placed in a 37 °C cell culture incubator for 45 min. The plate was then placed on ice, washed with ice-cold flow cytometry buffer and stained for OX56 by flow cytometry. OX56 surface levels on transduced cells were assessed by gating on the top 40% of OX56-expressing cells in the control condition, then using the same gate on the transduced cells treated with various compounds to assess % internalization.
Blood from control or treated (Phenelzine or Fluoxetine) mice was drawn from the inferior vena cava into a syringe containing acid citrate dextrose (Sigma Aldrich C3821). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by mixing blood with modified HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer (140mM NaCl, 2mM KCl, 12mM NaHCO3, 0.3mM NaH2PO4, 1mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 5mM HEPES, pH6.8) containing 0.35% BSA followed by 300g centrifugation during 4 min. PGI2 was added to platelet-rich plasma (500nM final concentration) and platelets were then pelleted by centrifugation at 1000g for 6 min. Pelleted platelets were resuspended in modified HEPES-Tyrode’s buffer (pH 7.38) containing ADP scavenger apyrase (adenosine-5’-triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, 0.02 IU/ml final) before being put at rest for 45 min at 37°C. Platelets were activated with 0.5 IU/mL of Thrombin for 3 minutes at 37°C, centrifugated and supernatant was collected for further experiments. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, except BSA (RPI research product international). Mast cells were isolated from peritoneal lavage of B6 mice by positive selection (EasySep Mouse CD117 (cKIT) Positive Selection Kit). P815 cells or isolated primary mast cells were diluted in migration medium and seeded in flat 24 well plates (5x10 5 cells / well) 30 min before activation with LPS (100ng/ml, Sigma). Supernatants were collected 2hr after activation, centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30min at 4°C and tested for migration or ELISA. To quantify 5-HIAA in cell supernatants, Mouse 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) ELISA Kit (AssayGenie) was used following manufacturer instructions.
Intravital imaging of omentum was performed as previously described ( Buscher et al., 2016 12. Buscher, K. ∙ Wang, H. ∙ Zhang, X. ... Protection from septic peritonitis by rapid neutrophil recruitment through omental high endothelial venules Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :10828 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (Low-Flow Anesthesia System, Somno Suite®) at 1.5 hr after TG injection. Follow-up surgery and imaging was carried out with lower concentrations of isoflurane (between 0.5% and 0.8%, adjusted according to breathing rate). After removal of abdominal fur, a 1–1.5-cm median incision was done at the linea alba of the upper abdomen to exteriorize the greater omentum, gently handed with cotton-wool tips. A custom-made microscopic stage allowed fixation of the omentum between two cover slips, immersed in warm saline. Throughout the experiment the animals were kept warm on a 37 °C heating pad (Biogenics). To visualize neutrophils and vessels in mixed chimeras, PE-conjugated anti–mouse Ly6G (2ug/200ul, #127608, Biolegend) and dextran Cascade Blue (#D1976, Fisher) were injected i.v. immediately before surgery. For transfer experiments, BM-derived neutrophils were enriched (purity > %80) with negative magnetic selection (EasySep™) following manufacture instructions and using the following biotin-conjugated antibodies: rat anti-mouse anti-CD115 (CSF-IR, #135508), anti-SiglecF (S17007L, #155512), anti-CD3 (145-2C11, #100304, BioLegend), anti-B220 (RA3-6B2, #103204, BioLegend), anti-CD4 (GK1.5, #100404, Biolegend), anti-CD8 (53-6.7, #100704, BioLegend). Purified WT and KO neutrophils were stained with Cell trace Violet or CFSE (#C34554, ThermoFisher), or Deep red (#C34565, Life Tech) according to manufacture instructions and mixed 50:50 before injection (3 x 10 7 neutrophil / mouse in 200ul saline), 30 min before i.p. TG. Dextran Cascade Blue was used as blood tracer. Pf4Cre mTmG mice expressed GFP selectively in platelets; these mice broadly expressed tdTom in other cell types including neutrophils but the intensity of red fluorescence in these cells was weak as reported ( Muzumdar et al., 2007 56. Muzumdar, M.D. ∙ Tasic, B. ∙ Miyamichi, K. ... A global double-fluorescent Cre reporter mouse Genesis. 2007; 45 :593-605 Crossref Scopus (2581) PubMed Google Scholar ) and was at least 100-fold less intense than for the transferred CMTMR labeled neutrophils such that only the transferred cells were detected. To image inflamed skin, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane at 1.5 hr after Listeria ear-pricking. After hair removal, the dorsal side of the ear was attached to a plastic coverslip mounted on a 37°C heating stage. Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 7MP equipped with a Chameleon laser (Coherent) and a x20 objective, samples were excited at 820-850nm. For video acquisition, a series of planes of 3μm z-spacing spanning a depth of 30–60 μm were collected every 7–14 s.
Multiphoton intravital movies were imported into IMARIS software (v.9.6.0). Vessel surface was obtained using IMARIS built-in surface function based on dextran-Cascade Blue or dextran-Rhodamine plus CD31-PE or TdTomato (mTmG) signal as indicated. To visualize WT and KO neutrophils in Mrp8-Cre + mTmG / GPR35 KO mixed chimeras, we injected i.v. anti-Ly6G-PE and imaged 2 independent neutrophil populations: double-positive Mrp8-Cre + mTmG (GFP + ) Ly6G-PE + WT and single-positive Ly6G-PE + GPR35 KO neutrophils. To create 2 independent channels for WT and KO neutrophils, GFP channel was subtracted from Ly6G-PE + channel using channel subtraction function in IMARIS. To track single cells, surface seed points were created and tracked over time with IMARIS spot built-in function. Tracks were manually examined and verified. To quantify transmigrating tracks, an iso-surface of the vessel was generated and tracks that had a shortest distance from the surface of ≤ 0μm (points internal to the surface have a negative value) were selected using Imaris. Of these, tracks that left the vessel and moved at least 5μm away were manually identified and scored as transmigrating. To quantify interactions of WT or KO neutrophils with platelets, iso-surfaces representing WT / KO neutrophils and platelets were created based on channel signal intensity (Imaris). Mean duration contact of WT or KO neutrophils with platelet surfaces was quantified by using Kiss and Run Imaris built-in function. Transmigrating track shortest distance to platelets was automatically quantified after generation of platelets surfaces and tracks (Imaris).
Prism software (GraphPad 9.0.1) was used for all statistical analyses. The statistical tests used are specified in the figure legends. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests were performed when comparing only two groups, Paired- t-tests were used to compare internally controlled replicates, and ordinary one-way ANOVA using Turkey’s multiple comparisons test was performed when comparing one variable across multiple groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant. In summary graphs, points indicate individual samples and horizontal lines are means or medians as indicated. In bar graphs, bars show means and error bars indicate standard error mean (SEM).
