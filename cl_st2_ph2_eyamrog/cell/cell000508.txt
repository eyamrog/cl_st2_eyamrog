Title: Evolutionary assembly of cooperating cell types in an animal chemical defense system


Abstract: Summary

How the functions of multicellular organs emerge from the underlying evolution of cell types is poorly understood. We deconstructed evolution of an organ novelty: a rove beetle gland that secretes a defensive cocktail. We show how gland function arose via assembly of two cell types that manufacture distinct compounds. One cell type, comprising a chemical reservoir within the abdomen, produces alkane and ester compounds. We demonstrate that this cell type is a hybrid of cuticle cells and ancient pheromone and adipocyte-like cells, executing its function via a mosaic of enzymes from each parental cell type. The second cell type synthesizes benzoquinones using a chimera of conserved cellular energy and cuticle formation pathways. We show that evolution of each cell type was shaped by coevolution between the two cell types, yielding a potent secretion that confers adaptive value. Our findings illustrate how cooperation between cell types arises, generating new, organ-level behaviors.

Section: Introduction

Animal diversification has been shaped by the evolution of new organs with novel functional properties ( Raff, 1996 125. Raff, R. The Shape of Life: Genes, Development, and the Evolution of Animal Form University of Chicago Press, 1996 Google Scholar ). Structures such as eyes, skeletons and brains were multicellular innovations that opened new ecological frontiers and catalyzed major cladogenesis ( Erwin, 2021 54. Erwin, D.H. A conceptual framework of evolutionary novelty and innovation Biol. Rev. Camb. Philos. Soc. 2021; 96 :1-15 Google Scholar ). How the functions of complex organs originate has challenged biologists since Darwin ( Darwin, 1859 36. Darwin, C. On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or, the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life John Murray, 1859 Crossref Google Scholar ; Dawkins, 1986 37. Dawkins, R.

The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104 :8597-8604 Google Scholar ; Oakley and Speiser, 2012 110. Oakley, T.H. ∙ Speiser, D.I. How Complexity Originates: The Evolution of Animal Eyes Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 2012; 46 :1-24 Google Scholar ; Shubin et al., 2009 136. Shubin, N. ∙ Tabin, C. ∙ Carroll, S. Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty Nature. 2009; 457 :818-823 Google Scholar ; West-Eberhard, 2003 162. West-Eberhard, M.J. Developmental Plasticity and Evolution Oxford University Press, 2003 Google Scholar ). Organs are composed of specialized cell types that perform dedicated roles within these structures ( Schmidt-Rhaesa, 2007 135. Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. The Evolution of Organ Systems Oxford University Press, 2007 Google Scholar ); yet, knowledge of how cell types are constructed at the molecular level during evolution, and how they cooperate to produce emergent, organ-level behaviors, remains fragmentary. At the gene regulatory level, new cell types are thought to arise from the evolution of unique, combinatorial transcription factor activities that specify novel cell identities ( Arendt et al., 2016 6. Arendt, D. ∙ Musser, J.M. ∙ Baker, C.V.H. ... The origin and evolution of cell types Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :744-757 Google Scholar ). However, a major problem is explaining how the downstream molecular components, which carry out the function of the differentiated cell, themselves originate. For a cell to execute its role, multiple gene products must be configured to work in concert. In a multicellular organ, this process must be coordinated across multiple cell types, fostering a division of labor that generates organ behavior ( Kishi and Parker, 2021 78. Kishi, Y. ∙ Parker, J. Cell type innovation at the tips of the animal tree Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2021; 69 :112-121 Google Scholar ).
The molecular changes leading to new cell type- and organ-level functions are obscured by the deep antiquity of many animal organs ( Shubin et al., 2009 136. Shubin, N. ∙ Tabin, C. ∙ Carroll, S. Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty Nature. 2009; 457 :818-823 Google Scholar ). However, insight may be gained from “evolutionary novelties”—lineage-specific structures that are absent in outgroups or serially homologous body parts ( Erwin, 2015 53. Erwin, D.H. Novelty and Innovation in the History of Life Curr. Biol. 2015; 25 :R930-R940 Google Scholar ; Wagner and Lynch, 2010 157. Wagner, G.P. ∙ Lynch, V.J. Evolutionary novelties Curr. Biol. 2010; 20 :R48-R52 Google Scholar ). Vertebrate eyes ( Lamb et al., 2007 85. Lamb, T.D. ∙ Collin, S.P. ∙ Pugh, Jr., E.N. Evolution of the vertebrate eye: opsins, photoreceptors, retina and eye cup. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8 :960-976 Google Scholar ), insect wings ( Linz and Tomoyasu, 2018 88. Linz, D.M. ∙ Tomoyasu, Y. Dual evolutionary origin of insect wings supported by an investigation of the abdominal wing serial homologs in Tribolium Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2018; 115 :E658-E667 Google Scholar ), beetle horns ( Hu et al., 2019 70. Hu, Y. ∙ Linz, D.M. ∙ Moczek, A.P. Beetle horns evolved from wing serial homologs Science. 2019; 366 :1004-1007 Google Scholar ) and the mammalian placenta ( Griffith and Wagner, 2017 62. Griffith, O.W. ∙ Wagner, G.P. The placenta as a model for understanding the origin and evolution of vertebrate organs Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2017; 1 :0072 Google Scholar ) are paradigms that connect genomic and developmental changes to the establishment of new phenotypes. Nevertheless, knowledge of how the functions of novel organs arise at the cellular level has been limited. One hurdle has been the challenge of measuring the transcriptomic composition of cell types—critical for tracing how different subfunctions within a cell evolved. The advent of single-cell methods has now brought many questions regarding cell-type evolution within reach ( Marioni and Arendt, 2017 95. Marioni, J.C. ∙ Arendt, D. How Single-Cell Genomics Is Changing Evolutionary and Developmental Biology Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33 :537-553 Google Scholar ). New tools permit decomposition of the transcriptome, enabling discovery of gene expression programs underlying cell identity and quantitative assessment of relationships between cell types ( Way and Greene, 2019 161. Way, G.P. ∙ Greene, C.S. Discovering Pathway and Cell Type Signatures in Transcriptomic Compendia with Machine Learning Annu. Rev. Biomed. Data Sci. 2019; 2 :1-17 Google Scholar ). Here, we leverage these methods to trace the evolution of cooperating cell types in an animal organ.
Exocrine glands are archetypal organ novelties: unique, clade-specific glands have evolved convergently thousands of times in metazoans, transforming how animals interact via pheromones and chemical defenses, enabling specialized modes of prey capture and digestion, and aiding in substrate adhesion, desiccation avoidance, and antimicrobial protection ( Brückner and Parker, 2020 24. Brückner, A. ∙ Parker, J. Molecular evolution of gland cell types and chemical interactions in animals J. Exp. Biol. 2020; 223 :jeb211938 Google Scholar ). Each origin of a new gland involves the evolution of new secretory cell types that synthesize natural products ( Torres and Schmidt, 2019 152. Torres, J.P. ∙ Schmidt, E.W. The biosynthetic diversity of the animal world J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :17684-17692 Google Scholar ). Venom glands of wasps, scorpions, and cone snails; the explosive weaponry of bombardier beetles; and diverse mammalian scent glands are multicellular novelties composed of taxon-restricted cell types found nowhere else. For many such organs, including vertebrate salivary glands ( Roussa, 2011 131. Roussa, E. Channels and transporters in salivary glands Cell Tissue Res. 2011; 343 :263-287 Google Scholar ), moth silk glands ( Suzuki et al., 1990 149. Suzuki, Y. ∙ Takiya, S. ∙ Suzuki, T. ... Developmental regulation of silk gene expression in Bombyx mori Hagedorn, H.H. ∙ Hildebrand, J.G. ∙ Kidwell, M.G. ... (Editors) Molecular Insect Science SpringerLink, 1990; 83-89 Google Scholar ), cnidarian digestive glands ( Babonis et al., 2019 9. Babonis, L.S. ∙ Ryan, J.F. ∙ Enjolras, C. ... Genomic analysis of the tryptome reveals molecular mechanisms of gland cell evolution Evodevo. 2019; 10 :23 Google Scholar ), and venom glands of many species ( Surm and Moran, 2021 148. Surm, J.M. ∙ Moran, Y. Insights into how development and life-history dynamics shape the evolution of venom Evodevo. 2021; 12 :1 Google Scholar ), the final secretion is a cocktail produced by distinct secretory cell types. Biosynthetic synergism between cell types is pronounced in many small molecule-based chemical defense systems. Here, an inactive toxin and its activating enzyme may be produced by separate glands; alternatively, a soluble toxin and its solvent are secreted into a common reservoir, yielding a bioactive secretion ( Kishi and Parker, 2021 78. Kishi, Y. ∙ Parker, J. Cell type innovation at the tips of the animal tree Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2021; 69 :112-121 Google Scholar ). Such functional interdependence encapsulates how emergent, organ-level behaviors can arise from cooperation between cell types.
One animal clade notable for pervasive glandular innovation is the rove beetles (Staphylinidae)—a radiation of 64,000 predominantly soil-dwelling predators that comprise Metazoa’s largest family ( Betz et al., 2018 15. Betz, O. ∙ Irmler, U. ∙ Klimaszewski, J. Biology of Rove Beetles (Staphylinidae) Springer, 2018 Google Scholar ; Parker, 2017 112. Parker, J. Staphylinids Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :R49-R51 Google Scholar ). Rove beetles exhibit widespread evolution of abdominal glands that produce diverse compounds including quinones, terpenes, alkaloids, iridoids, hydrocarbons and esters ( Francke and Dettner, 2005 59. Francke, W. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemical Signalling in Beetles Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 240 :85-166 Google Scholar ). A unique, flexible body enables rove beetles to target secretions at other organisms, fostering interspecies relationships from chemical defense to symbiosis ( Parker, 2016 111. Parker, J. Myrmecophily in beetles (Coleoptera): evolutionary patterns and biological mechanisms Myrmecol. News. 2016; 22 :65-108 Google Scholar ). The glands are often composite organs that produce multi-compound secretions via distinct cell types ( Dettner, 1993a 40. Dettner, K. Defensive secretions and exocrine glands in free-living staphylinid beetles—their bearing on phylogeny (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) Biochem. Syst. Ecol. 1993; 21 :143-162 Google Scholar ). Although their chemistry and anatomy have been studied in many species ( Francke and Dettner, 2005 59. Francke, W. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemical Signalling in Beetles Top. Curr. Chem. 2005; 240 :85-166 Google Scholar ), how these organs function at the molecular level, and how they evolved in specific lineages, is unknown. Here, we examine the molecular architecture of one such gland, enabling us to infer how a novel organ and its constituent cell types evolved. We exploited the model species Dalotia coriaria of the megadiverse Aleocharinae, a subfamily that possess a defensive “tergal gland” on the dorsal abdomen ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). Using single-cell transcriptomics, we uncover pathways for defensive compounds in tergal gland cell types. By inferring transcriptomic and pathway relationships with more ancient cell types, we retrace how the tergal gland was functionally assembled during evolution. We present evidence that evolution followed an accessible path toward cell-type cooperativity, building an organ capable of producing a multi-compound secretion that confers adaptive value.

Section: Results

When provoked, Dalotia flexes its abdomen to release the contents of a large chemical defense gland—the tergal gland—situated between abdominal segments A6 and A7 ( Figures 1 A and 1B) ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). The secretion is smeared directly onto the perceived threat and contains three benzoquinones (BQs) ( Figure 1 D)—aromatics that are common arthropod defensive compounds ( Blum, 1981 19. Blum, M. Chemical Defenses of Arthropods Academic Press, 1981 Google Scholar ). BQs are topical irritants that bind TRPA1 channels ( Ibarra and Blair, 2013 71. Ibarra, Y. ∙ Blair, N.T. Benzoquinone reveals a cysteine-dependent desensitization mechanism of TRPA1 Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 83 :1120-1132 Google Scholar ), activating nociceptive pathways ( Kang et al., 2010 73. Kang, K. ∙ Pulver, S.R. ∙ Panzano, V.C. ... Analysis of Drosophila TRPA1 reveals an ancient origin for human chemical nociception Nature. 2010; 464 :597-600 Google Scholar ). The adaptive value of Dalotia ’s secretion is demonstrated by experimentally depleting the contents of the gland, disarming the beetle, and compromising its defense against predatory ants ( Figures 1 C and S1 A). The BQs may also have antimicrobial properties ( Carcamo-Noriega et al., 2019 31. Carcamo-Noriega, E.N. ∙ Sathyamoorthi, S. ∙ Banerjee, S. ... 1,4-Benzoquinone antimicrobial agents against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived from scorpion venom Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :12642-12647 Google Scholar ).
Although BQs are highly noxious, each compound in isolation is a solid. Consequently, the secretion also contains four less toxic compounds: large amounts of a C11 alkane, n -undecane, low amounts of two C10 esters, ethyl decanoate and isopropyl decanoate, and trace levels of a C12 ester, ethyl dodecanoate ( Figure 1 D). These compounds may function as solvents, combining with BQs to create a potent secretion, as well as promoting spreading and penetration into cuticles ( Blum, 1981 19. Blum, M. Chemical Defenses of Arthropods Academic Press, 1981 Google Scholar ; Dettner, 1984 38. Dettner, K. Isopropylesters as Wetting Agents From the Defensive Secretion of the Rove Beetle Coprophilus striatulus F. (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) Insect Biochem. 1984; 14 :383-390 Google Scholar ). The secretion is thus a cocktail, the composition of which may be explained by possible synergism between its components. To produce this cocktail, the tergal gland consists of two anatomically distinct cell types: (1) a secretory epithelium, composed of columnar cells that are continuous with the epidermis and form a large reservoir inside the body into which they secrete directly ( Figures 1 E and 1F); and (2) large, bulbous secretory cells, 8–14 per animal, located posterior to the reservoir into which they feed via tubular ducts ( Figures 1 E and 1F). The tergal gland, and these two cell types, are specific to aleocharines ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ); they are absent in outgroup rove beetles (subfamily Tachyporinae) that cannot produce defensive compounds ( Figures 1 G, S1 B, and S1C). We sought to determine how these two cell types cooperate to synthesize Dalotia ’s defensive secretion.
Dalotia ’s ability to produce defensive compounds is refractory to antibiotics ( Figures S1 D–S1H). We therefore reasoned that biosynthesis relies not on symbiotic bacteria, as in some other chemically defended rove beetles ( Piel, 2002 116. Piel, J. A polyketide synthase-peptide synthetase gene cluster from an uncultured bacterial symbiont of Paederus beetles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99 :14002-14007 Google Scholar ), but on enzymes encoded in the beetle’s genome and expressed within the gland. We dissected small numbers of each gland cell type and performed SMART-Seq RNA sequencing, creating cell type transcriptomes ( Figures S2 A–S2C). This approach led to recovery of candidate enzymes in each cell type. We focused initially on synthesis of the undecane and esters, hypothesizing that their hydrocarbon chains derive from fatty acids ( Stanley-Samuelson et al., 1988 144. Stanley-Samuelson, D.W. ∙ Jurenka, R.A. ∙ Cripps, C. ... Fatty acids in insects: Composition, metabolism, and biological significance Arch. Insect Biochem. 1988; 9 :1-33 Google Scholar ). Fatty acids are built from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA units produced by glycolysis ( Wakil et al., 1983 159. Wakil, S.J. ∙ Stoops, J.K. ∙ Joshi, V.C. Fatty acid synthesis and its regulation Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52 :537-579 Google Scholar ). Rearing Dalotia on D-glucose- 13 C 6 food, we observed strong 13 C incorporation into the undecane and esters ( Figure S3 A), confirming they originate via the glycolytic pathway and fatty acid synthesis. In contrast, adding D 23 -dodecanoic acid to food led to negligible D 23 incorporation ( Figure S3 B). The compounds thus do not derive from consumed fatty acids.
In animals, the multistep reaction to produce fatty acids is catalyzed by a multidomain fatty acid synthase (FASN) ( Smith, 1994 140. Smith, S. The animal fatty acid synthase: one gene, one polypeptide, seven enzymes FASEB J. 1994; 8 :1248-1259 Google Scholar ; Smith et al., 2003 141. Smith, S. ∙ Witkowski, A. ∙ Joshi, A.K. Structural and functional organization of the animal fatty acid synthase Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42 :289-317 Google Scholar ). FASNs generally synthesize the commonest fatty acids, C16 and C18 in length ( Smith et al., 2003 141. Smith, S. ∙ Witkowski, A. ∙ Joshi, A.K. Structural and functional organization of the animal fatty acid synthase Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42 :289-317 Google Scholar ). However, Dalotia ’s gland compounds are shorter (C10–C12). Notably, a predicted FASN was upregulated in the epithelial secretory cells comprising the reservoir ( Figure S2 B) but not in the bulbous secretory cells ( Figure S2 C). Strong expression in these cells was confirmed via in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) ( Choi et al., 2018 33. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Schwarzkopf, M. ∙ Fornace, M.E. ... Third-generation in situ hybridization chain reaction: multiplexed, quantitative, sensitive, versatile, robust Development. 2018; 145 :dev165753 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 2 F). To deduce this FASN ’s function, we temporally silenced it with systemic RNA interference (RNAi) ( Parker et al., 2018 113. Parker, J. ∙ Eldredge, K.T. ∙ Thomas, I. ... Hox-logic of body plan innovations for social insect symbiosis in rove beetles bioRxiv. 2018; 198945 Google Scholar ; Tomoyasu and Denell, 2004 151. Tomoyasu, Y. ∙ Denell, R.E. Larval RNAi in Tribolium (Coleoptera) for analyzing adult development Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214 :575-578 Google Scholar ) ( Figure S2 D). Silencing caused near-total loss of undecane and all three esters without impacting the BQs ( Figures 2 A, 2B, and S3 C). We name this enzyme “Master Fatty Acid Synthase” (MFASN), due to its upstream role in synthesizing fatty acid-derived compounds in the tergal gland. We infer that the epithelial secretory cells (magenta cell type in Figure 2 J) are the source of these compounds. This cell type is hence named the “solvent cell type.”
Further analysis of the solvent cell transcriptome led to discovery of a complete fatty acid pathway downstream of MFASN. The maximally expressed transcript is a predicted cytochrome P450 (CYP) ( Figure S2 B), cell-type-specific expression of which was confirmed by HCR ( Figure 2 G). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this CYP belongs to an insect-specific “CYP4G” class ( Figure S3 G), known to decarbonylate aldehydes to create alkanes ( Feyereisen, 2020 55. Feyereisen, R. Origin and evolution of the CYP4G subfamily in insects, cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2020; 143 :106695 Google Scholar ; Qiu et al., 2012 124. Qiu, Y. ∙ Tittiger, C. ∙ Wicker-Thomas, C. ... An insect-specific P450 oxidative decarbonylase for cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :14858-14863 Google Scholar ). Consistent with this function, silencing the tergal gland CYP4G (herein “ TG-CYP4G ”) caused selective loss of the undecane and the appearance of its C12 aldehyde precursor, dodecanal ( Figures 2 C and S3 D). We infer that TG-CYP4G functions downstream of MFASN as a terminal enzyme that decarbonylates dodecanal to make undecane. To produce dodecanal, the activated C12 fatty acid (dodecanoyl-CoA) produced by MFASN must first be reduced to an aldehyde. Conspicuously, a predicted fatty acyl-CoA reductase (herein “ TG-FAR ”) was strongly expressed in solvent cells ( Figures 2 H and S2 B). As with TG-CYP4G , silencing TG-FAR caused specific loss of undecane, this time without the appearance of dodecanal ( Figures 2 D and S3 E). We infer that solvent cells make undecane via a pathway in which MFASN produces dodecanoic acid that is reduced by TG-FAR and decarbonylated by TG-CYP4G ( Figure 2 J).
In addition to this alkane pathway, a second branch of the solvent pathway yields the esters. Silencing MFASN caused loss of the three esters ( Figure 2 B). Because two of these are C10 compounds (isopropyl and ethyl decanoate), MFASN must produce their C10 fatty acid precursor, decanoic acid, in addition to the dodecanoic acid precursor of undecane ( Figure 2 J). Notably, we observed strong upregulation of a single α-esterase enzyme in solvent cells ( Figures 2 I and S2 B). Silencing this enzyme (“ TG- α Est ”) removed all three esters without affecting undecane ( Figures 2 E and S3 F). TG-αEst is thus the key enzyme in the ester branch of the solvent pathway. TG-αEst esterifies both C10-CoA and C12-CoA to yield the three esters ( Figure 2 J).
Solvent cells create a volatile solution that we hypothesize dissolves the BQs. To investigate how this function evolved, we reconstructed the evolutionary steps by which the solvent cells were pieced together. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using droplet microfluidics (10x Chromium v.3) to entire adult abdominal segments, enabling us to determine the transcriptomic relationships of solvent cells to other cell types in the Dalotia abdomen. We created two segmental atlases: “Segment 7” comprising segment A7 plus the solvent cell reservoir ( Figure 3 A); and “Segment 6” encompassing segment A6 minus the reservoir. Segment 6 is serially homologous but lacks the gland, approximating ancestral segment morphology ( Figures 3 A and 3B). We integrated five 10x runs ( Figures S4 A–S4C) and selected 3,000 transcripts that capture transcriptional heterogeneity across cells for subsequent analyses. Using Seurat 3.1 ( Butler et al., 2018 29. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Google Scholar ), we determined 26 cell clusters, assigning these to putative cell types using marker genes from Drosophila (see STAR Methods ). The atlas is shown in Figure 3 C as a UMAP.
Using each cell type’s mean expression of the 3,000 transcript set, we inferred a tree of transcriptomic similarity, and used the topology to test whether the 26 cell types could be grouped into higher-order classes via a random forest classifier ( Figures S4 D and S4E). This classifier produced strong support for 14 higher groupings, herein called “cell classes” ( Figures 3 C, S4 E, and S4F). Overall, 85% of all cells were correctly assigned to one cell class ( Figure S4 E). The 26 cell types and 14 cell classes thus represent a robust classification of cell types in abdominal segments 6 and 7 of Dalotia .
Within the abdominal cell atlas, a single cluster co-expressed the four solvent pathway enzymes ( Figures 3 D–3G and S5 A–S5F). This cell type—cluster number 6—is thus the solvent cell type, a determination further supported it being almost exclusively restricted to segment 7 ( Figure 3 B). To investigate solvent pathway evolution, we searched for features shared with other cell types. We observed that several cell types—1, 5, 13, 14, and 18—expressed MFASN to high levels, indicating fatty acid synthesis ( Figures 3 D and S5 A). We deduced that these cell types comprise Dalotia ’s fat body—an ancient insect organ sharing many functions with vertebrate liver and adipose tissue ( Arrese and Soulages, 2010 7. Arrese, E.L. ∙ Soulages, J.L. Insect fat body: energy, metabolism, and regulation Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2010; 55 :207-225 Google Scholar ). Fat body cells are sites of fat and glucose storage, as well as lipid synthesis, and are identifiable as lipid droplet-containing cells forming loose tissue throughout the abdomen. HCR revealed strong MFASN expression in Dalotia ’s fat body ( Figure S5 G). Phylogenetic analysis shows that MFASN is a single copy gene present in all beetles, as well as in Drosophila ( Figure 4 L). MFASN ’s deep conservation and broad expression across Dalotia ’s fat body cell types imply an ancestral function in the insect fat body. We HCR-labeled MFASN in a distantly related outgroup beetle, Tribolium (Tenebrionidae), revealing strong, fat body-specific expression ( Figure S5 H). MFASN ’s ancestral function was indeed in the fat body; production of C12 and C10 precursors evolved by co-opting MFASN into solvent cells.
Fat body cells can be highly heterogenous in insects ( Haunerland and Shirk, 1995 66. Haunerland, N.H. ∙ Shirk, P.D. Regional and Functional Differentiation in the Insect Fact Body Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40 :121-145 Google Scholar ), and this is so in Dalotia . First, cell types 1, 5, 14 and 18—but not 13—cluster-based on mean transcript expression ( Figure S4 D), implying two different fat body classes. The four former cell types also express Drosophila fat body markers including pumpless and apolipophorin , whereas cell type 13 does not ( Figures 5 I–5I″). Most strikingly, the two fat body classes differ in expression of α - esterases ( Data S1 ): all α - esterase copies except one are expressed in cell types 1, 5, 14, and 18 (and occasional other cell types) ( Data S1 ), whereas cell type 13 expresses only TG- α Est , shared exclusively with solvent cells ( Figure 3 G; Data S1 ). Using HCR of TG- α Est , we identified cell type 13 as subepidermal bands of fat body containing large lipid droplets ( Figures 4 A–4C). We refer to cell type 13 as “ventral fat body” (VFB) and other fat body types distributed more dorsally as “dorsal fat body” (DFB; cell types 1, 5, 14+18) ( Figures S4 D and S5 I). Given the general function of α - esterases in the fat body, that sister paralogs of TG- α Est are expressed primarily in fat body, and that TG- α Est itself functions in the VFB, we infer that the solvent pathway’s ester branch evolved by recruiting a fat body α - esterase to function downstream of MFASN ( Figure 4 O). Importantly, TG- α Est is an aleocharine-specific gene that is absent in other beetles, including outgroup Tachyporinae ( Data S1 ). Furthermore, the duplicate occurs in genomes of species known to produce esters, including Dalotia (tribe Athetini), Drusilla , and Platyusa (both Lomechusini), but is absent from Aleochara (Aleocharini) that does not ( Data S1 ).
Many aleocharines synthesize esters as the putative BQ solvent but lack alkanes, which may represent a more recent evolutionarily addition ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). Recruitment of MFASN and TG-αEst may thus have been an early step in solvent pathway evolution, with the alkane branch added subsequently. We noted that one cell type—23—expressed a paralog of TG-CYP4G ( Figure 4 K; Data S2 A). CYP4Gs have been shown to function canonically in oenocytes—ancient pheromone-producing cells found in all insects ( Makki et al., 2014 94. Makki, R. ∙ Cinnamon, E. ∙ Gould, A.P. The development and functions of oenocytes Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2014; 59 :405-425 Google Scholar ). Oenocytes synthesize very long-chain (C25–C40) alkanes and alkenes known as cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that are secreted onto the body and encode a chemical signature of species identity ( Billeter et al., 2009 16. Billeter, J.-C. ∙ Atallah, J. ∙ Krupp, J.J. ... Specialized cells tag sexual and species identity in Drosophila melanogaster Nature. 2009; 461 :987-991 Google Scholar ). CHCs also form a waxy barrier against desiccation ( Koto et al., 2019 82. Koto, A. ∙ Motoyama, N. ∙ Tahara, H. ... Oxytocin/vasopressin-like peptide inotocin regulates cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis and water balancing in ants Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :5597-5606 Google Scholar ; Qiu et al., 2012 124. Qiu, Y. ∙ Tittiger, C. ∙ Wicker-Thomas, C. ... An insect-specific P450 oxidative decarbonylase for cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :14858-14863 Google Scholar ). In oenocytes, CYP4G performs terminal decarbonylation to yield the secreted CHCs ( Qiu et al., 2012 124. Qiu, Y. ∙ Tittiger, C. ∙ Wicker-Thomas, C. ... An insect-specific P450 oxidative decarbonylase for cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :14858-14863 Google Scholar ). We HCR-labeled this CYP4G , revealing clusters of enlarged cells subepidermally in the ventral abdomen, often intermingled with VFB ( Figures 4 D and 4E). Silencing this locus led to near-total loss of Dalotia ’s CHCs ( Figures 4 F and 4G; Data S2 E), confirming that these cells are the oenocytes. We name this enzyme O-CYP4G ( Oenocyte-CYP4G ).
Recent studies have delineated a conserved oenocyte CHC pathway ( Blomquist and Ginzel, 2021 18. Blomquist, G.J. ∙ Ginzel, M.D. Chemical Ecology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of Insect Hydrocarbons Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2021; 66 :45-60 Google Scholar ). This pathway bears striking similarity to the alkane branch of the solvent pathway: oenocytes use FASNs to produce fatty acids that are reduced to aldehydes by FARs before decarbonylation by CYP4G ( Blomquist and Ginzel, 2021 18. Blomquist, G.J. ∙ Ginzel, M.D. Chemical Ecology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of Insect Hydrocarbons Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2021; 66 :45-60 Google Scholar ; Holze et al., 2021 69. Holze, H. ∙ Schrader, L. ∙ Buellesbach, J. Advances in deciphering the genetic basis of insect cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis and variation Heredity. 2021; 126 :219-234 Google Scholar )—modifications that mirror exactly the steps for undecane synthesis ( Figure 2 J). Consistent with the deep conservation of the insect CHC pathway, we find that, in addition to O-CYP4G , cell type 23 expresses three FASN paralogs and four FAR s ( Figure 4 K; Data S2 B and S2C). As with O-CYP4G , silencing selected copies of these enzymes strongly diminished CHC production ( Figures 4 H and 4I; Data S2 F and S2G). Hence, Dalotia expresses parallel alkane pathways in ancient oenocytes and novel solvent cells, their close similarity implying common ancestry. Indeed, we find that TG-CYP4G and O-CYP4G are sister duplicates found only in Aleocharinae ( Figure 4 M); in Dalotia , the two copies sit tandemly in the genome ( Figure 4 N). The ancestral CYP4G was likely an oenocyte enzyme that synthesized CHCs; duplication gave rise to oenocyte and solvent cell copies ( Figure 4 O). Indeed, TG-CYP4G is conserved in species that produce alkanes ( Aleochara , Drusilla , Platyusa , and Dalotia ) but is absent from Lissagria that does not ( Figure 4 M). Whether duplication of an O-FAR led to TG-FAR is less clear; FAR s undergo extensive gene birth-and-death, so their history is challenging to infer ( Finet et al., 2019 56. Finet, C. ∙ Slavik, K. ∙ Pu, J. ... Birth-and-death evolution of the fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR) gene family and diversification of cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis in Drosophila Genome Biol. Evol. 2019; 11 :1541-1551 Google Scholar ). TG-FAR is not a sister paralog of an O-FAR ( Data S2 J), so its role in alkane synthesis may have arisen convergently. Regardless, the CHC pathway represented a pre-existing template: by recruiting a FAR and CYP4G downstream of MFASN, alkanes were added to the defensive secretion ( Figure 4 O).
Despite similar enzyme logic, the products of the two pathways are markedly different: the CHC pathway produces very-long-chain waxy hydrocarbons, whereas the solvent pathway makes a medium-chain volatile liquid. Oenocytes make longer compounds via elongases (ELOs) ( Blomquist and Ginzel, 2021 18. Blomquist, G.J. ∙ Ginzel, M.D. Chemical Ecology, Biochemistry, and Molecular Biology of Insect Hydrocarbons Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2021; 66 :45-60 Google Scholar ; Holze et al., 2021 69. Holze, H. ∙ Schrader, L. ∙ Buellesbach, J. Advances in deciphering the genetic basis of insect cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis and variation Heredity. 2021; 126 :219-234 Google Scholar ) ( Figure 4 O). We find Dalotia oenocytes express five ELOs ( Figure 4 K; Data S2 D), knockdown of which caused an altered profile with many shorter chain compounds ( Figure 4 J; Data S2 I) without reducing total CHC levels ( Data S2 H). In contrast, solvent cells express no ELOs ( Figure 4 K; Data S2 D). Hence, the solvent pathway evolved via selective FAR and CYP4G recruitment without an ELO, enabling medium-chain biosynthesis ( Figure 4 O).
Solvent cells comprise part of the beetle’s cuticle, forming part of the intersegmental membrane joining segments A6 and A7 ( Figure 1 E). Developmentally, the cells derive from the epidermal posterior (P) compartment of A6 and express Engrailed ( Figure 1 F; Data S2 K and S2L), the P compartment selector transcription factor ( Morata and Lawrence, 1975 103. Morata, G. ∙ Lawrence, P.A. Control of compartment development by the engrailed gene in Drosophila Nature. 1975; 255 :614-617 Google Scholar ). Like the surrounding epidermis, solvent cells produce chitin, which forms an internal lining to the reservoir and is continuous with the rest of the exoskeleton ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). Despite their epidermal identity, solvent cells are enlarged, columnar secretory cells that produce undecane and esters. To understand how solvent cells acquired this property, we studied their transcriptomic relationship to other cell types within the abdomen. We employed consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) ( Kotliar et al., 2019 81. Kotliar, D. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq eLife. 2019; 8 :e43803 Google Scholar ), performing an unsupervised search for constellations of significantly co-expressed transcripts across all cells within the 10x dataset, irrespective of their cell type. cNMF applies iterative NMF treatments on a transcripts-by-transcripts matrix to identify groups of significantly co-expressed genes (“gene expression programs” or “GEPs”). GEPs discretize the transcriptome into building blocks that may be surrogates of cellular properties. A GEP used in one or a few cell types may confer aspects of cell identity; conversely, a GEP used by many cell types likely underlies a routine activity such as mitosis ( Kotliar et al., 2019 81. Kotliar, D. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq eLife. 2019; 8 :e43803 Google Scholar ). Employing cNMF, we determined that 20 GEPs accurately capture a decomposed representation of the total transcriptome of A6 and A7 ( Data S3 ). We calculated the proportional contribution of each GEP to each individual cell type’s transcriptome, depicted as a usage map ( Figure 5 A). Visualizing transcriptome composition in this way, some GEPs appear cell-type-specific, such as GEP8 and GEP2—unique identity GEPs expressed in heart and midgut cells, respectively. Conversely, most cell types express GEPs 18 and 12, implying common cellular activities.
Of particular interest are cell types composed of combinations of GEPs ( Figure 5 A). These include the solvent cells, recovered as a composite of GEPs 17 and 9 ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Consistent with solvent cells being part of the cuticular epidermis, GEP17 is the principal GEP expressed by the cuticular cell class ( Figures 5 B–5D). This cell class is composed of cell types 0, 9, 17, and 20 ( Figures 3 C and S4 D), which express multiple cuticle proteins and Laccase 2 that functions in cuticle tanning ( Arakane et al., 2005 5. Arakane, Y. ∙ Muthukrishnan, S. ∙ Beeman, R.W. ... Laccase 2 is the phenoloxidase gene required for beetle cuticle tanning Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :11337-11342 Google Scholar ) ( Figure S6 F). However, solvent cells are clearly divergent from other cuticular cells in their additional expression of GEP9, which accounts for ∼20% of the transcriptome ( Figure 5 B). The composition of GEP9 reveals that it is constituted by 61 core transcripts (applying a stringent Z score filter of <0.002) ( Data S4 A) that show strong and significant enrichment for biological processes related to lipid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis ( Data S4 B–S4D). GEP9 is thus a transcriptional module that may endow solvent cells with their capacity for high level fatty acid production and modification.
Remarkably, GEP9 is the principal GEP of both oenocytes and VFB ( Figures 5 A, 5B, 5E, and 5F). This expression module therefore defines the two cell types from which solvent pathway enzymes were co-opted or duplicated. Unlike solvent cells, VFB and oenocytes show no pronounced GEP usage beyond GEP9 (aside from GEPs 18 and 12 that most cell types express) ( Figure 5 A). GEP9 thus likely contributes to the functional identity of these two cell types, which are both specialized for fatty acid biosynthesis. It follows that GEP9 probably imparts this same function in solvent cells. A close relationship between solvent cells, VFB, and oenocytes is further supported by the three cell types forming a clade based on mean transcript expression ( Figure S4 D), and random forest classifies them into the same cell class ( Figures S4 E and S4F). That solvent cells are a novelty within Dalotia ’s cuticle, whereas oenocytes and fat body cells are ancient, non-cuticular cell types in all insects, implies a specific evolutionary scenario ( Figures 5 G and 5H). We suggest that solvent cells arose via transcriptomic hybridization: they are a cuticular cell type, ancestrally comprising intersegmental membrane, that gained an expression module that evolved in oenocytes and fat body, equipping them for high-level fatty acid synthesis ( Figure 5 H). As part of this process, the oenocytes and fat body also contributed distinct branches of the solvent pathway ( Figure 4 O).
We next focused on BQ synthesis. Although defensive BQs have arisen in myriapods, arachnids, earwigs, termites, cockroaches, grasshoppers, capsid bugs, and at least seven times in beetles ( Wagner et al., 2020 158. Wagner, J.M. ∙ Naragon, T.H. ∙ Brückner, A. Benzoquinones in the defensive secretion of a bug (Pamillia behrensii): a common chemical trait retrieved in the Heteroptera bioRxiv. 2020; Google Scholar ), their mechanistic origins were hitherto unknown in any species. Aromatic compounds in animals are often acquired from dietary aromatic amino acids or symbiotic microbes, or sometimes synthesized de novo ( Brückner et al., 2020 25. Brückner, A. ∙ Kaltenpoth, M. ∙ Heethoff, M. De novo biosynthesis of simple aromatic compounds by an arthropod ( Archegozetes longisetosus ) Proc. Biol. Sci. 2020; 287 :20201429 Google Scholar ; Torres et al., 2020 153. Torres, J.P. ∙ Lin, Z. ∙ Winter, J.M. ... Animal biosynthesis of complex polyketides in a photosynthetic partnership Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :2882 Google Scholar ). To infer the synthetic route, we fed Dalotia D-glucose- 13 C 6 and observed negligible 13 C incorporation into the BQs ( Figure S6 A), arguing against complete de novo synthesis. Conversely, feeding Tyr- 13 C 6 or Phe- 13 C 6 led to strong 13 C incorporation, with molecular weights of all BQs increasing by exactly 6 ( Figure S6 A). The BQ’s benzene rings thus derive from dietary aromatic amino acids.
Beyond their use in chemical defense, quinones play key roles in insect metabolism: ubiquinone (coenzyme Q 10 ) is a redox-active compound synthesized in mitochondria where it functions in electron transport ( Stefely and Pagliarini, 2017 145. Stefely, J.A. ∙ Pagliarini, D.J. Biochemistry of Mitochondrial Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42 :824-843 Google Scholar ); additionally, quinone intermediates arise during exoskeleton maturation (cuticle tanning) ( Noh et al., 2016 108. Noh, M.Y. ∙ Muthukrishnan, S. ∙ Kramer, K.J. ... Cuticle formation and pigmentation in beetles Curr. Opin. Insect Sci. 2016; 17 :1-9 Google Scholar ). In both contexts, aromatic amino acids are the precursors. We asked whether these ancient pathways could give clues to BQ synthesis in the tergal gland. In cuticle tanning, oxidation of Tyr-derived dopa and dopamine creates quinones that are pigment precursors and protein crosslinkers used for cuticle hardening (sclerotization) ( Noh et al., 2016 108. Noh, M.Y. ∙ Muthukrishnan, S. ∙ Kramer, K.J. ... Cuticle formation and pigmentation in beetles Curr. Opin. Insect Sci. 2016; 17 :1-9 Google Scholar ). Oxidation is mediated by Laccase 2 (Lac2), a secreted multicopper oxidase (MCO) ( Asano et al., 2019 8. Asano, T. ∙ Seto, Y. ∙ Hashimoto, K. ... Mini-review an insect-specific system for terrestrialization: Laccase-mediated cuticle formation Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2019; 108 :61-70 Google Scholar ). A predicted MCO was strongly upregulated in the second cell type within the gland—the bulbous secretory cells ( Figure S2 C). This transcript encodes a secreted protein with three cupredoxin domains in the same configuration as other laccases ( Figure 6 A) ( Dwivedi et al., 2011 48. Dwivedi, U.N. ∙ Singh, P. ∙ Pandey, V.P. ... Structure–function relationship among bacterial, fungal and plant laccases J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2011; 68 :117-128 Google Scholar ). Silencing this laccase caused near-total loss of all three BQs, without affecting the solvents ( Figures 6 B and S6 B). We name this laccase “Decommissioned” (Dmd) after its loss-of-function phenotype where the irritant is eliminated from the secretion.
We confirmed dmd ’s expression in the bulbous secretory cells via HCR ( Figures 6 C and 6D), establishing the source of the BQs. We refer to these cells as the “BQ cell type.” Because Dmd is secreted, we hypothesized that it may be a terminal pathway enzyme that oxidizes secreted BQ precursors. Laccases are well known to oxidize hydroxyl groups, and studies in other aleocharine rove beetles have shown that in addition to BQs, trace levels of corresponding hydroquinones (HQs) can occasionally be detected in the secretion, consistent with HQs being unoxidized precursors ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). In Dalotia , we sometimes recover trace levels of 2-methyl-1,4-HQ in the secretion, corresponding to the non-oxidized form of the highest abundance BQ. Strikingly, we find that although silencing dmd diminishes levels of 2-methyl-1,4-BQ, it leads to excess levels of 2-methyl-1,4-HQ ( Figure 6 E). Further, a HQ precursor of a different BQ species, 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-HQ, additionally appears ( Figure 6 F). Accumulation of HQs following dmd silencing provides strong evidence that this laccase oxidizes secreted HQs, converting them into BQs. We relate this function to the BQ cell’s anatomy, where the cell envelopes a lumen connected directly to the duct ( Figure 6 P). We posit that the lumen is an oxidation chamber into which Dmd and HQs are secreted and combine. The duct channels the resulting cytotoxic BQs into the solvent reservoir ( Figure 6 P).
We recovered dmd orthologs only in genomes of aleocharines that possess a tergal gland and synthesize BQs ( Figure 6 G). Phylogenetically, Dmd does not branch from inside either clade of conserved insect laccase, Lac1 and Lac2 ( Figure 6 G). As in other insects, Dalotia lac2 is expressed in cuticular cells ( Figure S6 F) and silencing it abolishes tanning ( Figures S6 C and S6D), whereas dmd is not expressed in the cuticle ( Figure S6 G) and is not involved in tanning ( Figures S6 C and S6E). Dmd thus defines an aleocharine-specific laccase clade that functions as a terminal oxidase in BQ synthesis. To corroborate this model, we synthesized Dmd protein and tested its ability to oxidize HQ precursors of all three BQs in vitro . Consistent with its inferred function, Dmd strongly catalyzed conversion of all three HQs to BQs ( Figures 6 H–6J and S6 H). Further, we synthesized Dalotia Lac1 and Lac2 and found that although both enzymes exhibited some activity on at least one HQ substrate, neither were as efficient as Dmd ( Figure 6 K). We conclude that Dmd is a catalytically specialized laccase that performs HQ oxidation in BQ cells.
What pathway produces the HQ precursors for Dmd? Our data indicate that BQs derive from Tyr ( Figure S6 A), but how the aromatic ring is hydroxylated to make HQs and decorated with methyl and methoxy groups is unknown. One eukaryotic pathway exists that integrates these steps: ubiquinone biosynthesis. Here, Tyr is converted to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB), which is modified in the mitochondrion to yield an HQ, ubiquinol ( Wang and Hekimi, 2019 160. Wang, Y. ∙ Hekimi, S. The Complexity of Making Ubiquinone Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2019; 30 :929-943 Google Scholar ). Dalotia ’s BQs resemble less modified versions of ubiquinol, at most incorporating methyl and methoxy groups ( Figure 6 L). To test whether HQs derive from a similar pathway, we fed Dalotia 4-HB- 13 C 6 and measured 13 C 6 incorporation into the BQs. Although the absolute level of incorporation was not high, we observed significant 13 C 6 enrichment into the two most abundant BQs ( Figure 6 M). The magnitude of 13 C 6 incorporation was lower than observed on feeding Dalotia Tyr- 13 C 6 ( Figure S6 A), likely because 4-HB is a catabolite, not a dietary precursor, limiting its access from the gut to the correct cellular location. This result nevertheless identifies 4-HB as an intermediate in the conversion of Tyr to HQs.
Key steps in 4-HB’s conversion to ubiquinol are carried out by sequentially acting CoQ enzymes ( Wang and Hekimi, 2019 160. Wang, Y. ∙ Hekimi, S. The Complexity of Making Ubiquinone Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2019; 30 :929-943 Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 J). Two CoQ enzymes are of potential relevance: CoQ5, a methyltransferase that adds the methyl group, and CoQ3, an O-methyltransferase that creates the methoxy groups. We asked whether these enzymes add methyl or methoxy groups to Dalotia ’s BQs. In most eukaryotes, including insects, CoQ enzymes are encoded by conserved single copy genes ( Kawamukai, 2016 75. Kawamukai, M. Biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in eukaryotes Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2016; 80 :23-33 Google Scholar ). Due to their essential role in cellular respiration, studying them in vivo is challenging. For example, we observed ∼3-fold higher transcription of CoQ5 in BQ cells ( Figure S7 B), but knockdown with even low dsRNA levels led to complete lethality. Unusually, however, we found that CoQ3 has duplicated in Dalotia , as well as in genomes of all other aleocharines surveyed (in some cases it has duplicated twice) ( Figure 7 F). Conspicuously, one of Dalotia ’s CoQ3 s is strongly upregulated in BQ cells ( Figure S7 D) as well as moderately so in putative sensory neurons ( Figure S7 H). Studies across eukaryotes have shown that CoQ3 adds two methoxy groups to ubiquinol using S -adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor ( Poon et al., 1999 120. Poon, W.W. ∙ Barkovich, R.J. ∙ Hsu, A.Y. ... Yeast and rat Coq3 and Escherichia coli UbiG polypeptides catalyze both O-methyltransferase steps in coenzyme Q biosynthesis J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274 :21665-21672 Google Scholar ). An analogous reaction might yield the methoxy group of 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-BQ. We fed Dalotia CD 3 -labeled methionine and observed direct incorporation of CD 3 into 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-BQ, confirming that the same reaction takes place ( Figure S7 A). Remarkably, silencing the BQ cell-expressed CoQ3 duplicate led to complete loss of 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-BQ in the secretion ( Figures 6 O and S7 E–S7G), without affecting Dalotia ’s other BQs ( Figures 6 O and S7 G). We name this CoQ3 paralog “ methoxyless ” ( meos ) and deduce that it performs an identical modification to a defensive BQ as canonical CoQ3 does to ubiquinone. meos appears to be a single copy gene that is specific to aleocharines ( Figure 6 N).
Canonical CoQ3 functions on the mitochondrial inner membrane, where MeOS is likewise predicted to localize ( Figure S7 I). Furthermore, another enzyme, CoQ6, which performs essential priming hydroxylation prior to methoxylation of ubiquinol by CoQ3, is also upregulated in BQ cells ( Figure S7 C), presumably permitting MeOS to methoxylate HQs ( Figure S7 J). However, silencing CoQ6 led to beetle lethality. Discovery of MeOS therefore provides a serendipitous genetic window into a mitochondrial route where 4-HB is modified by CoQ enzymes to make HQs ( Figure 7 I), closely paralleling ubiquinol synthesis ( Figure S7 J). Fully delineating the pathway in vivo is currently impossible owing to essential systemic functions of other CoQ enzymes. However, we postulate their co-option as a parsimonious model and conjecture that Dalotia ’s three BQs arise via differential processing by MeOS and other CoQ enzymes ( Figures 6 Q and S7 J).
Why did cell type evolution follow the routes we have uncovered? The tergal gland secretion enhances beetle survival ( Figure 1 C), so we reasoned that the BQ and solvent cells together underlie the gland’s adaptive value. To test this hypothesis, we performed a large-scale selection experiment, placing Dalotia in multiplexed arenas with predatory ants and quantifying relative survival of beetles that were either wild-type (GFP RNAi; 12 arenas, n = 120 beetles), MFASN -silenced to inhibit solvent production (12 arenas, n = 120 beetles), or dmd -silenced to inhibit BQ synthesis (12 arenas, n = 120 beetles). We allowed ants and beetles to interact for 48 h before assaying survival. In both MFASN - and dmd- silenced treatments, we observed a comparable, significant reduction in survival (64% for GFP RNAi, 50% for MFASN RNAi, p < 0.001, 45% for dmd RNAi; p < 0.001) ( Figure 7 A). Reduced survival appears to result from impaired chemical defense, because silencing MFASN or dmd without ant exposure did not significantly impact survival ( Data S5 A). These results demonstrate each cell type’s adaptive value at the organismal level.
Because the BQ and solvent cells secrete into a common reservoir, their products may combine to make a bioactive secretion. We explored how the compounds interact to shape the secretion’s physicochemical properties. Two parameters capture salient properties of defensive secretions: the surface coating ability (SCA)—a measure of wetting potential, and extensional viscosity (EV)—a substance’s resistance to deformation when force is applied. The SCA and EV of arthropod secretions are species-specific and highly variable, likely arising as a balance of factors including safe containment in gland reservoirs, controlled exudation, efficient spread across target tissues, as well as final irritancy. We used a custom high-speed video rheometer to quantify SCA and EV of droplets of synthetic mixtures of different defensive compounds ( Figures 7 D and 7E). We found that SCAs of the BQ species alone or in combination are zero ( Figure 7 F), whereas their EVs are virtually infinite ( Data S5 B), because the three compounds remain in solid phase even when mixed. However, adding undecane dissolves the BQs, creating a moderately viscous liquid with high SCA ( Figure 7 F; Data S5 B). Undecane thus acts as a solvent, unlocking the BQs. Equivalent SCA and EV are observed whether esters are present or not ( Figure 7 F). Undecane is therefore the primary solvent and the main determinant of the secretion’s SCA and EV.
We examined the biological consequences of this chemical synergism by measuring toxicity against other organisms. Using viability of Drosophila larvae as a readout, we made synthetic secretions and measured survival rates 1 h after drastic, whole-body immersion. Dipping fly larvae for 1 s in a solution composed solely of undecane or esters, or both compound classes combined, led to only a small-to-modest survival reduction ( Figure 7 B). Due to the BQs being solids, we could not immerse fly larvae in them, but found that completely bathing larvae in BQ powder caused a comparably limited drop in survival ( Figure 7 B). However, when the BQs were combined with the undecane and esters at their natural ratios, mortality increased dramatically, reaching 80% (with 100% mortality in 2 of 5 replicates) ( Figure 7 B). High mortality was also obtained if undecane was substituted for a higher ester fraction, or vice versa, demonstrating the critical effect of dissolving the BQs ( Figure 7 B). These data indicate that the BQ and solvent cells are indeed engaged in biosynthetic synergism; only when their products are combined is a potent secretion with demonstrable adaptive value obtained ( Figures 1 C and 7 A).
We studied the antimicrobial effects of the secretion, noting that Dalotia self-applies the secretion topically to its own body. To do so, we assayed how synthetic combinations impact growth of the Gram-negative bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens —a common soil species and potential insect pathogen ( Pineda et al., 2010 118. Pineda, A. ∙ Zheng, S.-J. ∙ van Loon, J.J.A. ... Helping plants to deal with insects: the role of beneficial soil-borne microbes Trends Plant Sci. 2010; 15 :507-514 Google Scholar ; Scales et al., 2014 133. Scales, B.S. ∙ Dickson, R.P. ∙ LiPuma, J.J. ... Microbiology, genomics, and clinical significance of the Pseudomonas fluorescens species complex, an unappreciated colonizer of humans Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 27 :927-948 Google Scholar ). When added to the P. fluorescens culture medium, no single compound inhibited growth (as measured by the OD500 of the culture at the endpoint of the assay) ( Figure 7 C; Table S1 ). Similarly, adding pairs of compound classes (undecane+esters, undecane+BQs, or esters+BQs) caused no effect (all pairwise tests p ≥ 0.18) ( Figure 7 C; Table S1 ). Remarkably, however, all three compound classes together caused dramatic growth suppression (all pairwise tests p ≤ 0.007) ( Figure 7 C). This suppressive effect was also manifested in a significantly prolonged lag-time prior to the exponential growth phase of the P. fluorescens culture (all pairwise tests p < 0.001) ( Data S5 C). Antimicrobial efficacy arising from combining these compounds is unexpected and striking; to our knowledge it has not been previously reported. The effect is again consistent with the adaptive utility of the tergal gland arising from cooperation between BQ and solvent cells.
Dalotia ’s tergal gland secretion is thus a multi-compound cocktail with emergent properties possessed by no single component. Although the BQs form the active defensive agent, the solvents provide a vehicle for the BQs while simultaneously conferring surface coating and tissue penetrating properties. We find two principal ways in which the solvent pathway may be specialized to meet these demands. First, the pathway favors high-level alkane and low-level ester synthesis. We noticed that silencing either TG-CYP4G or TG-FAR strongly increased levels of the C12 ester (“ester shift” in Figures 2 H and 2I), consistent with TG-CYP4G and TG-FAR normally titrating most C12-CoA toward undecane, permitting TG-αEst to make only trace ethyl dodecanoate ( Figures 1 C and 2 F). Accordingly, silencing TG-CYP4G or TG-FAR frees up C12-CoA for TG-αEst, resulting in elevated ethyl dodecanoate ( Figures 2 H and 2I). The alkane branch is thus specialized for C12-CoA, whereas TG-αEst can use both C10- and C12-CoA. In this way, the solvent pathway produces large amounts of undecane as both the primary solvent and determinant of EV and SCA. This alkane bias strongly impacts the secretion: if undecane is replaced with the esters at their natural ratios, substantially higher EV and exceptionally high SCA result ( Figure 7 F; Data S5 B). Such a sticky, surface active secretion may be challenging to secrete and difficult to contain in the reservoir. Low abundance esters are nevertheless critical for the secretion’s antimicrobial effect ( Figure 7 C) and may also promote penetration into cuticles ( Dettner, 1991 39. Dettner, K. Solvent-dependent Variability of Effectiveness of Quinone-defensive Systems of Oxytelinae Beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) Entomol. Gen. 1991; 15 :275-292 Google Scholar ).
A second aspect is the use of undecane as opposed to a longer chain alkane as the solvent. Undecane stands in contrast to the very-long-chain CHCs produced in oenocytes. During solvent pathway evolution, the importance of selective recruitment of a reductase (FAR) and decarbonylase (CYP4G) but not an elongase (ELO) is underscored by insolubility of BQs in even the shortest of Dalotia ’s CHCs, heptacosane (C27) ( Figures 7 F and 7G). However, the lack of ELO recruitment was not the only critical feature. Most insect FASNs produce C14–C18 fatty acids, rather than C12. We find that the corresponding alkanes (C13, C15, and C17), although only moderately longer than undecane, create secretions with much lower SCAs when mixed with the BQs, even in the presence of esters ( Figures 7 F and 7G). In the case of heptadecane (C17), adding BQs without esters caused the secretion to freeze ( Figure 7 F), and BQ crystals were still evident when esters were included. Hence, synthesis of C12-CoA by MFASN is central to creating an alkane that can both solubilize the BQs and create a topical secretion ( Figure 7 G).

Section: Discussion

We have traced the evolution of new cellular functions comprising an organ novelty—the defensive tergal gland of rove beetles. First, we uncovered small molecule enzyme pathways that execute the biosynthetic functions of two taxon-restricted secretory cell types. Second, we presented evidence that these pathways—as well as a transcriptomic module expressed within one of the cell types—arose via repurposing components from more ancient cell types within the beetle. Third, we demonstrated the consequences of cell type evolution at the organ level, assigning adaptive value to the coordinated actions of the two cell types, as well as to specialized features of the solvent pathway that render the secretion effective in chemical defense. Our findings indicate that the functional evolution of animal cell types can be a constrained process, employing pre-existing pathway motifs and expression programs and hence potentially convergence-prone. Conversely, our study demonstrates that the route followed by cell-type evolution may also be a highly contingent process, conditional on other cell types within the organ and the fitness consequences of their collective output.
Using scRNA-seq, we pinpointed specific cell types from which solvent pathway enzymes had been ancestrally sourced, enabling us to reconstruct the assembly of the pathway via co-option or duplication of oenocyte and fat body enzymes. We also determined that a transcriptome module that defines oenocytes and VFB, GEP9, has been re-employed in solvent cells. Through these changes, an ancestral region of abdominal cuticle evolved into specialized secretory cells comprising a reservoir. That the beetle’s capacity to manufacture solvents is derived from its primary metabolism supports the view of genetic paths of least resistance to new animal chemistries—a notion stemming from pervasive convergence in the compounds that animals produce ( Brückner and Parker, 2020 24. Brückner, A. ∙ Parker, J. Molecular evolution of gland cell types and chemical interactions in animals J. Exp. Biol. 2020; 223 :jeb211938 Google Scholar ). The BQ pathway likewise points to an underlying genomic blueprint; here, HQ synthesis, although not yet fully delineated, owes at least part of its existence to the ubiquinone pathway from which the CoQ3 paralog meos originated via duplication. We predict the connection will turn out to be still more extensive, with ubiquinone and HQ pathways sharing a subset of enzymes ( Figure S7 J). Similarly, the role of the laccase, Dmd, parallels or may derive from the conserved function of Lac2 in cuticle tanning ( Asano et al., 2019 8. Asano, T. ∙ Seto, Y. ∙ Hashimoto, K. ... Mini-review an insect-specific system for terrestrialization: Laccase-mediated cuticle formation Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2019; 108 :61-70 Google Scholar ). The discovery of laccase involvement in BQ-based termite chemical defense ( Bourguignon et al., 2016 20. Bourguignon, T. ∙ Šobotník, J. ∙ Brabcová, J. ... Molecular Mechanism of the Two-Component Suicidal Weapon of Neocapritermes taracua Old Workers Mol. Biol. Evol. 2016; 33 :809-819 Google Scholar ) hints at parallel use of laccases in BQ-producing arthropod clades. We propose that repurposing pathway motifs from ancient metabolic cell types—or entire expression programs that enable production of certain compounds—represent accessible routes to new biosynthetic functions in animal cell types. A consequence is that exploration of chemical space is constrained, leading to widespread convergence.
Together with recruitment of solvent pathway enzymes, we propose that acquisition of GEP9 was causal in transforming the intersegmental membrane between A6 and A7 into a glandular epithelium. The membrane is naturally invaginated between segments in rove beetles ( Figure 5 G); consequently, further growth created a reservoir into which the solvent cells could secrete directly ( Figure 5 H). The antiquity of the oenocytes and fat body, which originated at the base of the Insecta, combined with GEP9 being the sole program recovered in these cell types, indicates that the polarity of recruitment was from these ancient cell types into solvent cells rather than vice versa. We cannot, however, rule out that some newer GEP9 components may have evolved functions in solvent cells and found secondary, pleiotropic utility in oenocytes or VFB.
The solvent cells shed mechanistic light on the phenomenon of “cell type fusion” where a novel cell type appears to take on features of two ancestral cell types ( Arendt et al., 2016 6. Arendt, D. ∙ Musser, J.M. ∙ Baker, C.V.H. ... The origin and evolution of cell types Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 :744-757 Google Scholar ; Oakley, 2017 109. Oakley, T.H.

A Short History of Nearly Every Sense-The Evolutionary History of Vertebrate Sensory Cell Types Integr. Comp. Biol. 2018; 58 :301-316 Google Scholar ). Redeployment of a pre-existing transcriptional program in a new cellular context may be a common means for generating cellular- and organ-level novelties, and contrasts with duplication and divergence of sister cells within organs or repeating developmental fields such as body segments ( Marioni and Arendt, 2017 95. Marioni, J.C. ∙ Arendt, D. How Single-Cell Genomics Is Changing Evolutionary and Developmental Biology Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2017; 33 :537-553 Google Scholar ) or brain nuclei ( Kebschull et al., 2020 76. Kebschull, J.M. ∙ Richman, E.B. ∙ Ringach, N. ... Cerebellar nuclei evolved by repeatedly duplicating a conserved cell-type set Science. 2020; 370 :eabd5059 Google Scholar ). Transcriptomic hybridization may be mechanistically facile if expression programs conferring cell identity are controlled by one or a few transcription factors (i.e., “terminal selectors”) ( Hobert, 2016 67. Hobert, O. Terminal Selectors of Neuronal Identity Curr. Top Dev. Biol. 2016; 116 :455-475 Google Scholar ). How GEP9 became expressed in solvent cells is unknown, but this abdominal location is a region of overlapping expression of the Abdominal A and Abdominal B Hox proteins, both of which are needed for solvent cell development ( Parker et al., 2018 113. Parker, J. ∙ Eldredge, K.T. ∙ Thomas, I. ... Hox-logic of body plan innovations for social insect symbiosis in rove beetles bioRxiv. 2018; 198945 Google Scholar ). Conceivably, a terminal selector controlling GEP9 in oenocytes and VFB could have come under Hox control and been co-opted into cuticle cells, creating a GEP9/17 hybrid transcriptome. Future studies may uncover the regulatory basis of BQ and solvent cell identities.
Demonstrating adaptive change at the molecular level depends on connecting such changes to phenotypic outcomes that differentially impact fitness ( Barrett and Hoekstra, 2011 10. Barrett, R.D.H. ∙ Hoekstra, H.E. Molecular spandrels: tests of adaptation at the genetic level Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12 :767-780 Google Scholar ). Our data connect the evolution of new cellular functions to a cooperative interaction between cell types that dictates whole organ performance and directly impacts animal survival. Hence, we propose that coevolution between the BQ and solvent cells has been driven, at least in part, by natural selection for organ-level properties. Our findings underscore how metazoan cell type and organ evolution are intrinsically coupled, with changes at the cellular level being comprehensible—and conferring adaptive value—only when their impact at the collective, multicellular organ level is considered ( Kishi and Parker, 2021 78. Kishi, Y. ∙ Parker, J. Cell type innovation at the tips of the animal tree Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2021; 69 :112-121 Google Scholar ).
Inferring the steps leading to cooperativity between the solvent and BQ cells is informed by two observations. First, the recalcitrance of the solid BQs makes a “solvents first” scenario likely, where alkanes or esters, or fatty acid-derived progenitors thereof, initially arose. Such compounds may have conferred modest chemical defense or acted as pheromones or lubricants for the flexible abdomen. This reasoning is supported by the second observation: that the earliest-diverging branch of the tergal gland-bearing Aleocharinae—the tribe Hypocyphtini—produce fatty acid-derivatives but lack BQs. We deduce that the prior evolution of a fatty acid-based secretion set the stage for the subsequent evolution of BQs, the potency of which could be unlocked by the former compounds acting as effective solvents. Features of the solvent pathway such as its alkane bias, the use of medium chain compounds and the presence of low-abundance esters, can be interpreted as specializations to harness the BQs’ toxicity and manipulability ( Figure 7 F ; Data S5 ). Hence, we suggest that the solvent cells in turn underwent adaptive modifications to make better use of the BQs, implying reciprocal coevolution between the two cell types. Across Aleocharinae, BQs are a constant feature of the secretion but the fatty acid derivatives vary extensively, including hydrocarbons, esters, and aldehydes of differing chain lengths and ratios ( Steidle and Dettner, 1993 146. Steidle, J.L.M. ∙ Dettner, K. Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). These differences are expected to strongly influence the secretion’s physicochemical nature, further emphasizing reciprocal coevolution.
Cooperative behavior is a feature of biological systems at all scales of organization. The tergal gland, comprising the simplest case of only two cell types, presents a model for explaining the evolution of cooperativity at the organ level. According to this model, the solvent cells created a niche for the BQ cells, which enhanced the gland’s adaptive value. The dependence of the BQs on the product of the solvent cells, and the reciprocal dependence of the solvent cells on the BQs to enhance their own adaptive value, meant that the two cell types became “locked in” as a unit evolving within constraints set by performance at the organ level. This hypothesized route toward cooperativity contrasts with models for cooperativity within protein complexes. Here, dependencies between subunits can arise via entrenchment of binding interactions that were ancestrally selectively neutral ( Hochberg et al., 2020 68. Hochberg, G.K.A. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Marklund, E.G. ... A hydrophobic ratchet entrenches molecular complexes Nature. 2020; 588 :503-508 Google Scholar ; Lukeš et al., 2011 90. Lukeš, J. ∙ Archibald, J.M. ∙ Keeling, P.J. ... How a neutral evolutionary ratchet can build cellular complexity IUBMB Life. 2011; 63 :528-537 Google Scholar ). In the tergal gland, we posit that interdependence has likewise been enforced, but through the addition of a new cell type that is functionally contingent on a pre-existing cell type, which itself became obligately reliant on the second cell type to realize a relative selective advantage. Such a scenario could iterate through further cycles, informing how cooperative interactions between diverse cell types may arise generally within organs.
The BQ cells’ large diameter (∼30–40 μm) and scarcity (∼8–14 cells/animal) precluded their recovery in the 10x scRNA-seq cell type atlas. We were thus unable to determine their GEP composition via cNMF, and thus their transcriptomic relationship to other cell types remains unclear at this time. Future studies of early-branching aleocharines are needed to gauge the conservation of BQ and solvent pathway enzymes across phylogeny; such efforts may further illuminate the tergal gland’s stepwise evolution.

The Greenhouse Rove Beetle ( Dalotia coriaria , Kraatz) strain used in this study was originally donated by Applied Bionomics (Canada) and inbred for nine generations. Beetles were kept as previously described ( Parker et al., 2018 113. Parker, J. ∙ Eldredge, K.T. ∙ Thomas, I. ... Hox-logic of body plan innovations for social insect symbiosis in rove beetles bioRxiv. 2018; 198945 Google Scholar ) and fed with oat/poultry-rearing pellet-powder three times per week.
Late third instar larvae were fed with a mixture of sterilized oat/poultry-rearing pellet-powder with amoxicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline antibiotics (2.5% w/w for each) or pure sterile oat/poultry-rearing pellet-powder as a control. Beetles were single-housed in 5 cm Petri dishes with a thin layer of Plaster of Paris. Petri dishes were moisturized three times a week and fresh food was provided ad libitum . Ten days after adult eclosion, tergal gland contents were extracted in hexane and analyzed via GC-MS (see below). To assess the effect of antibiotic treatment on absolute numbers of bacteria associated with the beetles, bacterial 16S rRNA copy numbers determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Since many insects have bacteria on their cuticles, the beetles were surface washed in 5% ( v/v ) sodium dodecyl sulfate solution before bacterial quantification. For the control and antibiotic treatments, DNA was extracted from eight replicates of individual Dalotia using the Zymo Research Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. For qPCR, we used universal eubacterial 16S rRNA gene primers (Univ16SRT-F: 5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′; Univ16SRT-R: 5′-TATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC-3′) ( Clifford et al., 2012 34. Clifford, R.J. ∙ Milillo, M. ∙ Prestwood, J. ... Detection of bacterial 16S rRNA and identification of four clinically important bacteria by real-time PCR PloS one. 2012; 7 , e48558 Google Scholar ). For quality assessment of DNA extracts and standardization of bacterial titers, qPCR with primers targeting host 28S rRNA was conducted simultaneously (D3A _F: 5′-GACCCGTCTTGAAACACGGA-3′; and D3B_R: 5′-TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA-3′) ( Litvaitis and Rohde, 1999 89. Litvaitis, M.K. ∙ Rohde, K. A molecular test of platyhelminth phylogeny: inferences from partial 28S rDNA sequences Invertebrate Biology. 1999; 118 :42-56 Google Scholar ). qPCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real Time PCR System in final reaction volumes of 25 μl, including the following components: 1 μl of DNA template, 2.5 μl of each primer (10 μM), 12.5 μl of autoclaved distilled H 2 O, and 6.5 μl of Luna® Universal qPCR Master Mix (New England BioLabs). PCR conditions were: 95°C for 5 minutes, 40 cycles at 95°C for 10 s, 70°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 10 s. A melting curve analysis was performed by increasing the temperature from 60°C to 95°C within 20 min. Standard curves were established for host 28S and bacterial 16S using PCR product as templates. A Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher) was used to measure DNA concentrations to calibrate standard curves. The ratio between absolute copy numbers of bacterial 16S and host 28S ( = bacterial/host copy ratio) was used as a standardized measure of bacterial abundance per beetle sample and the difference between the antibiotic-treatment and control group beetles was assessed with a Mann-Whitney-U-test.
Late third instar larvae were fed sterilized oat/poultry-rearing pellet-powder with amoxicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline antibiotics (2.5% w/w for each) plus 25% ( w/w ) stable isotope-labeled precursors: 13 C 6 -D-glucose, 13 C 6 -tyrosine (all > 99% enrichment, Sigma-Aldrich), D 3 -methione, D 23 -dodecanoid acid and 13 C 6 -4-hydroxybenzoic acid (98%–99% enrichment, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) as well as a control with sterile oat/poultry-rearing pellet-powder. Beetles were single-housed and glands of adults were extracted ten days after eclosion using hexane. Crude hexane extracts were analyzed with a GC-MS as described in detail below. Electron ionization mass spectra of characteristic fragment ions were monitored in single ion mode (SIM) and at 70 eV.
We developed a protocol to artificially disarm Dalotia , creating beetles that lack the tergal gland secretion. Adult beetles were collected from laboratory stock populations and placed on a CO 2 fly pad; after the beetles were initially anesthetized the valve was closed and beetles could recover. Subsequently, we pulsed the beetles with low doses of CO 2 which initiated abdomen flexing and visible release of chemicals from the tergal gland. We repeated this cycle of anesthesia, recovery, and low pulses of CO 2 five times. To check success of the protocol, a subgroup of CO 2 -treated beetles, as well as control animals form the stock population beetles were individually extracted in 70 μL hexane for 10 min and their glandular compounds profiled with GC-MS (see below). Control group beetle glands contained 6.3 ± 5.6 μg (mean ± SD) of secretion, while CO 2 -treated animals contained 0.5 ± 1 ng ( Figure S1 A). CO 2 -treatment did not affect survival of the beetles and after 72 h all 25 beetles in both the treated and control groups were still alive. For the survival biotest, ten Dalotia beetles were paired with five Liometopum occidentale Emery ants (collected: Chaney Canyon, Altadena, CA; 34°13’04.1”N 118°09’06.4”W). Beetles and ants were placed in a 100x100x50mm plastic box with 10mm Plaster of Paris and two rolled pieces of Kimwipe to create an artificial foraging space ( Vucic-Pestic et al., 2010 156. Vucic-Pestic, O. ∙ Birkhofer, K. ∙ Rall, B.C. ... Habitat structure and prey aggregation determine the functional response in a soil predator–prey interaction Pedobiologia (Jena). 2010; 53 :307-312 Google Scholar ). In total, we prepared 14 boxes each of control and disarmed beetles ( = 140 beetles and 70 ants per treatment). The experiment ran for 48 h and the percentage of surviving beetles calculated for each box. Difference in survival between control and disarmed groups was analyzed using a Mann-Whitney-U-test.
Double-stranded RNA was prepared from cDNA from pooled from all life-stages of the beetle. Regions of 450-650 bp for locus were amplified using primers with T7 linkers (5′- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′). Fragments were cloned into a pCR4-TOPO Vector (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, ThermoFisher) using primers listed in the Key Resource Table.
The same primers were subsequently used to amplify template DNA from the TOPO vector for dsRNA synthesis, using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher). After synthesis, dsRNA was cleaned using acid phenol/chloroform (50:50) and adjusted to a concentration of ∼6 mg/ml. For injection, dsRNA stock was then diluted 1:1 in DEPC-treated 1x PBS and blue food dye following a previously published protocol ( Philip and Tomoyasu, 2012 115. Philip, B.N. ∙ Tomoyasu, Y. Gene knockdown analysis by double-stranded RNA injection Molecular methods for evolutionary genetics Humana Press, 2012; 471-497 Google Scholar ). Following the same protocol, dsRNA against green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was prepared and injected as a control. Late third instar larvae were collected from laboratory stock populations and microinjection was performed according to Parker et al. (2018) 113. Parker, J. ∙ Eldredge, K.T. ∙ Thomas, I. ... Hox-logic of body plan innovations for social insect symbiosis in rove beetles bioRxiv. 2018; 198945 Google Scholar . After injection, the larvae were individually placed into 5 cm plastic Petri dishes with thick moistened filter paper. Larvae that died before pupation or did not pupate by the end of ten days were discarded. The filter paper was moistened three times per week. After adults had eclosed, beetles were additionally fed with frozen fruit flies and oat/poultry-rearing pellet-powder on the same schedule for ten days. Mature beetles were used for experiments chemical assays.
To screen chemical phenotypes of dsRNA knockdown and dsGFP control beetles, single specimens were submersed ( Dettner, 1984 38. Dettner, K. Isopropylesters as Wetting Agents From the Defensive Secretion of the Rove Beetle Coprophilus striatulus F. (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) Insect Biochem. 1984; 14 :383-390 Google Scholar , 1993b 41.

A GCMSQP2020 gas chromatography/mass-spectrometry system (Shimadzu, Kyōto, Japan) equipped with a ZB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID, df = 0.25 μm) from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) was used for chemical profiling. Crude hexane sample aliquots (2 μl) were injected by using an AOC-20i autosampler system (Shimadzu) into a split/splitless-injector which operated in splitless-mode at a temperature of 310°C. Helium was used as the carrier-gas with a constant flow rate of 2.13 ml/min. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: The column temperature at the start was 40°C with a 1-minute hold after which the temperature was initially increased 30°C/min to 250°C and further increased 50°C/min to a final temperature of 320°C and held for 5 minutes. Electron impact ionization spectra were recorded at 70 eV ion source voltage, with a scan rate of 0.2 scans/sec from m/z 40 to 450. The ion source of the mass spectrometer and the transfer line were kept at 230°C and 320°C, respectively.
Compounds were identified based on their m/z fragmentation patters and by comparison to authentic standards (1,4-benzoquinone, 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, undecane, isopropyl decanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate; all SigmaAldrich; 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquninone was synthesized as outlined below). Additionally, compound identity was confirmed by comparison of retention indices and MS data with published literature ( Dettner, 1984 38. Dettner, K. Isopropylesters as Wetting Agents From the Defensive Secretion of the Rove Beetle Coprophilus striatulus F. (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) Insect Biochem. 1984; 14 :383-390 Google Scholar ; Dettner et al., 1985 42. Dettner, K. ∙ Schwinger, G. ∙ Wunderle, P.

Chemistry and morphology of the tergal gland of freeliving adult Aleocharinae (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and its phylogenetic significance Syst. Entomol. 1993; 18 :149-168 Google Scholar ). The authentic standards were used to construct four-point calibrations curves for external standardization and quantification of BQs, esters and alkanes. Semi-quantification of bulk cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) was based on the internal C18 standard. We quantified the ion abundance and the absolute amounts of compounds in ng based on the internal or external standard (see above), as well as the relative composition of individual CHCs compared to ion abundance of the other CHCs. For quantifying gland compounds following RNAi silencing, we compared the target compound amounts between dsRNA knockdown and dsGFP control beetles with a Kruskal-Wallis test or Mann-Whitney-U-tests. Compositional data of CHCs was compared by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix and analyzed using PERMANOVA ( Anderson, 2001 3. Anderson, M.J. A new method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance Austral Ecol. 2001; 26 :32-46 Google Scholar ; Brückner and Heethoff, 2017 23. Brückner, A. ∙ Heethoff, M. A chemo-ecologists’ practical guide to compositional data analysis Chemoecology. 2017; 27 :33-46 Google Scholar ). GC-MS data related to RNAi can be found at CaltechData ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1917 ).
For in situ HCR, DNA probe sets, DNA HCR amplifier, HCR hairpins as well as hybridization, wash and amplification buffers were purchased from Molecular Instruments (Beckman Institute at Caltech; https://www.molecularinstruments.com/ ) for each target transcript ( Key Resources Table ). For dissections, adult beetles were immersed in ice-cold DEPC-treated PBS and their abdomens were removed. Ventral segments were removed with dissection scissors. Dorsal abdominal segments were fixed in 4% PFA in DEPC-treated PBST for 25 minutes at room temperature and subsequently washed with DEPC-treated PBST (3x5 min). Fixation was followed by a 5 min proteinase K (10 μg/mL) treatment at room temperature, and samples were then rinsed in DEPC-treated PBST (3x). Samples were postfixed in 4% PBST-PFA for 25 minutes at room temperature and washed again with DEPC-treated PBST (3x5 min). The amplification and detection stages followed published protocols ( Choi et al., 2018 33. Choi, H.M.T. ∙ Schwarzkopf, M. ∙ Fornace, M.E. ... Third-generation in situ hybridization chain reaction: multiplexed, quantitative, sensitive, versatile, robust Development. 2018; 145 :dev165753 Google Scholar ). Probes were either initiated with B1-Alexa546 or B4-Alexa488 amplifiers. After amplification and before the final wash steps, DAPI or Hoechst 33342 (1:2000) to mark nuclei, Alexa 488- or Alexa-647-Wheat Germ Agglutinin Conjugate (WGA; 1:200) to label cell membranes and in selected samples BODIPY 493/503 (1:200) to stain for neutral lipids were added. Tissue samples were imaged as whole mounts of dorsal abdomens in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (ThermoFisher), using a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan fast.
To test the toxicity of Dalotia tergal gland compounds, we followed an approach by Dettner (1984) 38. Dettner, K. Isopropylesters as Wetting Agents From the Defensive Secretion of the Rove Beetle Coprophilus striatulus F. (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) Insect Biochem. 1984; 14 :383-390 Google Scholar . First, artificial test solutions were prepared using the main gland constituents mimicking the natural ratios. An all-compound mixture (∼100 μl) was prepared by mixing 8 mg 1,4- benzoquinone, 28 mg 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, 47 mg undecane, 7 mg isopropyl decanoate, 13 mg ethyl decanoate and 7 mg ethyl dodecanoate (all Sigma Aldrich). Subsequently, mixtures were prepared without certain compounds to create the following treatments: undecane+BQs, esters+BQs, all BQs, undecane+esters, undecane, esters; 1x PBS was used as control. For the survival tests a group of 25 Drosophila melanogaster third instar wandering larvae were immersed for 1 s in 1 mL of artificial secretion or dipped into solid BQ powder and subsequently moved into a fresh culture tube. This protocol was repeated five times for each of the eight different treatments. Numbers of surviving fly larvae were counted after 1 h. For statistical analysis we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with binomial error distribution and logit as link-function in R. We fitted ‘fly survival’ as a binomial response variable of surviving fly larvae and total number of fly larvae (25 individuals) in each replicate. Finally, we used the R-implemented ‘Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses’ with Tukey contrast for pairwise comparisons.
To assay the antimicrobial properties of the Dalotia tergal gland secretion, we performed bacterial growth assays in a standard 96-well plate design. Artificial test solutions that mimicked natural ratios of compounds, as well and individual and pairs of compound classes were prepared as above (Fly toxicity biotest) and diluted in LB broth to a concentration of ∼6 μg/μl. 1x PBS was used as a control. Cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens wild-type (strain WCS365) ( Jorth et al., 2019 72. Jorth, P. ∙ Spero, M.A. ∙ Livingston, J. ... Quantitative Visualization of Gene Expression in Mucoid and Nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aggregates Reveals Localized Peak Expression of Alginate in the Hypoxic Zone MBio. 2019; 10 :e02622 Google Scholar ) were grown on LB agar plates overnight at 30°C. Subsequently, ∼5 μl of the bacterial colony was transferred into 500 μl and the OD 500 was measured on a NanoDrop Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Based on the OD reading, the cell suspension was diluted to OD 500 = 0.1. For the growth assay, 15 μl of the cell suspension was inoculated with 134 μl LB and 1 μl of test secretion, and overlayed with 50 μl sterile mineral oil. Growth curves were recorded over 24h every 10 min on a Biotek Synergy 4 running in continuous shaking mode at 30°C. Each treatment and the negative PBS control were replicated 13 times across two plates.
The OD 500 values were plotted over time, and we modeled the bacterial growth with a Bayesian regression using a normal likelihood with mean given by a logistic function: 𝑂 ⁢ 𝐷 5 0 0 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = A 1 + 𝑒 4 ⁢ μ 𝑚 𝐴 ⁢ ( 𝜆 − 𝑡 ) + 2 Where λ describes the lag time (in h) before bacterial growth takes off, μ m is the maximal growth rate, t is the time since inoculation and A is the asymptote of the curve after growth levels off. We sampled these parameters for each growth event using the Stan implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and took the median sample value for each parameter for a given growth curve. A detailed script can be found on CaltechData ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ). We then compared the lag time λ and the OD 500 at the endpoint data after 24h for each treatment using a Welch’s ANOVA and one-way ANOVA, respectively, followed by a Tukey’s HDS pairwise posthoc test.
To test for an adaptive role of the BQ and solvent cells in chemical defense, we generated beetles with either BQ-free or solvent-free gland secretions by knocking down dmd or MFASN , respectively, by injecting dsRNA (∼3 mg/ml) against these targets. As a control treatment, we injected dsRNA against GFP (∼3 mg/ml). Due to some mortality post-injection, we injected ∼400-500 larvae for each dsRNA target. The detailed RNAi protocol, primer sequences and beetle care were the same as those used for pathway characterization (see below). 10-day old adults were used to set up the following survival assays: like previously, ten beetles were paired with five ants (collected: Chaney Canyon, Altadena, CA; 34°13’04.1”N 118°09’06.4”W) in a 100x15 mm plastic Petri dish with a thin layer of Plaster of Paris and two rolled pieces of Kimwipe. In total, we prepared 12 dishes per treatment ( = 120 beetles and 60 ants per treatment), running the assay for 48 h before counted the number of surviving beetles. Because the amount of secretion per beetle cannot be determined before the experiment, we collected and extracted every beetle, regardless if dead or alive, in 30 μl of a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) hexane:chloroform for 15 min. We then ran a total of 360 beetle samples on the GC-MS using the same chromatographic conditions as outlined below. To determine if RNAi was successful in each individual beetle, we used single-ion detection of characteristic ions of 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquione ( m/z = 122) and undecane ( m/z = 156) to determine whether the glands of extracted beetles were benzoquinone-free ( dmd -RNAi), solvent-free ( MFASN RNAi) or not influenced ( GFP ). Only beetles with the correct gland composition were included in the final dataset; beetles with completely empty glands at the end of the experiment were removed from the dataset because it is possible they possessed empty glands at the start of the experiment. For statistical analysis of survival differences among BQ-free, solvent-free and control beetles, we again used a GLM with binomial error distribution and logit as link-function in R. We fitted ‘beetle survival’ as a binomial response variable of counted surviving beetles with a non-empty gland and total number of beetles (dead+alive) with a non-empty gland to account for the different sample sizes in each replicate. Finally, we used the R-implemented ‘Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses’ with Tukey contrast for pairwise comparisons. The R script for this experiment can be found at CaltechData ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ). As a control to assess survival without ants, we injected 50 larvae for each construct ( MFASN , dmd and GFP ), raised them until maturity and recorded their survival for a period of twelve consecutive days.
For bulk RNA sequencing (3 biological and 3 technical replicates), a total of 105 gland (Segment A7) and control (Segment A6) segments from male beetles were dissected and separately collected for total RNA extraction with Trizol. Library preparation followed the Illumina TruSeq mRNA stranded kit protocol, including chemical shearing to obtain an average final library size of ∼300 bp. Illumina 100 bp paired-end sequencing was performed on a HiSeq2500 platform in which the twelve Dalotia gland libraries were multiplexed on the same lane. For genome-guided assembly of the transcriptome, a bam-file was created from the Dalotia coriaria reference genome assembly: ( http://131.215.78.39/genomebrowser/cgi-bin/hgGateway?genome=Dcor2&hubUrl=http://131.215.78.39/genomebrowser/evolution/parkergroup/Dalotia_coriaria/hub2.txt ) using STAR ( Dobin et al., 2013 44. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Google Scholar ), while the approximately 240 million RNaseq reads were in silico normalized and subsequently used together with the bam-file to assemble transcripts using Trinity v2.8.4 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 61. Grabherr, M.G. ∙ Haas, B.J. ∙ Yassour, M. ... Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :644-652 Google Scholar ). Finally, transcript sequences were clustered and concatenated to remove duplications using CD-HIT ( Fu et al., 2012 60. Fu, L. ∙ Niu, B. ∙ Zhu, Z. ... CD-HIT: accelerated for clustering the next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :3150-3152 Google Scholar ) with a sequence identity threshold of 0.95, yielding an assembly with a total length of 61.1 Mbp, an N50 = 3097 bp and a BUSCO score ( Simão et al., 2015 137. Simão, F.A. ∙ Waterhouse, R.M. ∙ Ioannidis, P. ... BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness with single-copy orthologs Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3210-3212 Google Scholar ) of C:97.6%[S:67.5%,D:30.4%],F:0.5%,M:1.6%. Annotations of transcripts were transferred from the respective gene models from the genome and additionally confirmed by blastx ( Altschul et al., 1990 2. Altschul, S.F. ∙ Gish, W. ∙ Miller, W. ... Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Google Scholar ) of all transcripts against the non-redundant NCBI protein database ( Pruitt et al., 2007 122. Pruitt, K.D. ∙ Tatusova, T. ∙ Maglott, D.R. NCBI reference sequences (RefSeq): a curated non-redundant sequence database of genomes, transcripts and proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :D61-D65 Google Scholar ). Finally, the bulk-transcriptome was used to build a kallisto ( Bray et al., 2016 21. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Google Scholar ) index file for pseudoalignment of single-cell RNaseq reads and cell-type specific, ultra-low input RNaseq (SMART-Seq). The assembled transcriptome can be found at CaltechData ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1914 ).
For microdissection of specific gland cell types, male Dalotia beetles were injected with Invitrogen Wheat Germ Agglutinin, Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate, to visualize the glandular structure in vivo , using a microinjector. Under fluorescence microscopy, we dissected the BQ cells in groups of 3-7 cells, the solvent cell tissue (∼1000 cells) and entire tergite 6 (control tissue) in ice-cold DEPC-treated PBS. We used the NEBNext® Single Cell/Low Input RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® together with NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® (New England Biolab) for library preparation, including cell dissociation, reverse transcription of poly(A) RNA, amplification full-length cDNA, fragmentation, ligation and final library amplification according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We performed cDNA amplification for 18-20 PCR cycles and final library amplification for 8 PCR cycles. In total, we constructed 31 libraries (ten D1, ten D2 and eleven control). The quality and concentration of the resulting libraries were assessed using the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA kit (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 platform (single-end with read lengths of 50 nt) with ∼20-25 million reads per library. Illumina sequencing reads were pseudoaligned to the bulk transcriptome and quantified (100 bootstrap samples) with kallisto 0.46.0 ( Bray et al., 2016 21. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Google Scholar ).
For cell-type specific differential expression analysis, kallisto-quantified RNaseq data were processed with sleuth 0.30.0 ( Pimentel et al., 2017 117. Pimentel, H. ∙ Bray, N.L. ∙ Puente, S. ... Differential analysis of RNA-seq incorporating quantification uncertainty Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :687-690 Google Scholar ) using Likelihood Ratio tests in R 3.6.1 ( R Core Team, 2018 128. R Core Team R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing 2018 https://www.R-project.org/ Google Scholar ). To assign either up or downregulation for each transcript we extracted the normalized transcripts per million (tpm) from gland and control samples of sleuth object and defined up and downregulation as: d o w n − r e g u l a t e d : 1 𝑛 𝑔 ⁢ ∑ 𝑛 𝑔 𝑖 = 1 𝑥 𝑖 1 𝑛 𝑐 ⁢ ∑ 𝑛 𝑐 𝑗 = 1 𝑥 𝑗 < 1 ; 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑝 − 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑔 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑡 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑑 : 1 𝑛 𝑔 ⁢ ∑ 𝑛 𝑔 𝑖 = 1 𝑥 𝑖 1 𝑛 𝑐 ⁢ ∑ 𝑛 𝑐 𝑗 = 1 𝑥 𝑗 > 1 Where x i is the transcripts per million of a gene y across all gland libraries (n g ), and x j is the transcripts per million of a gene y across all control libraries (n c ). The code can be found in the R script ‘sleuth_R_file’ in the Script repository on CaltechData ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ). Based on the differential expression data, we extracted transcripts that were down or upregulated in the BQ or solvent gland cells compared to control tissue.
One hundred and fifty tergal gland segments (Segment 7) and control segments (Segment 6) of Dalotia males were dissected in EBSS (Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution; ThermoFisher) and transferred to into 150 μl ice-cold Schneider’s Drosophila medium and fetal bovine serum (SDM+FBS, 90:10 V/V; both ThermoFisher). After centrifugation at 250x g for 2 min, subsequent washing in 300 μl ice-cold EBSS and centrifugation for another 2 min at 250x g, the supernatant was replaced by 150 μl of pre-warmed (37°C) trypsin (Corning 0.25% Trypsin, 0.1% EDTA; Fisher Scientific). Cells were dissociated at 37ᵒC for 25 min and the reaction was reinforced by pipette mixing every 5 min. After 25 min, trypsin was inhibited with 100 μl soybean trypsin inhibitor (SigmaAldrich) and incubated for 5 min. Subsequently, 500 μl SMD+FBS was added and the cell suspension was passed through a 40 μm cell strainer (pluriStrainer, ImTec Diagnostics). Finally, cells were pelleted at 300x g for 8 min and resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) 0.04% BSA (ThermoFisher) prior to 10x scRNaseq runs. For cell counting the LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher) was used. The above protocol was repeated twice for segment 6 and three times for segment 7, yielding five 10x runs.
After manually determining the cell concentration using a hemocytometer, suspensions were further diluted to desired concentrations (∼1000 cells/μL) if necessary. The appropriate volume of reverse transcription mix was added to target 2,500–10,000 cells for loading into the 10x chip. The Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library & Gel Bead Kit v3, Chromium Single Cell 3′Chip kit v3 (PN-120236), and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit were used for all downstream RT, cDNA amplification (12 PCR cycles), and library preparation as instructed by the manufacturer (Chromium Single Cell 3′Reagents Kits v3 User Guide). The quality and concentration of the resulting libraries were assessed using the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA kit (Thermo Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay. scRNaseq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 or NovaSeq6000 (paired-end with read lengths of 150 nt) and reads were aligned to the reference transcriptome using kallisto 0.46.0 ( Bray et al., 2016 21. Bray, N.L. ∙ Pimentel, H. ∙ Melsted, P. ... Near-optimal probabilistic RNA-seq quantification Nat. Biotechnol. 2016; 34 :525-527 Google Scholar ). From a total of 1,669,423,289 reads, 86.3% mapped to the Dalotia transcriptome using kallisto | bustools ( Melsted et al., 2019 100. Melsted, P. ∙ Ntranos, V. ∙ Pachter, L. The barcode, UMI, set format and BUStools Bioinformatics. 2019; 35 :4472-4473 Google Scholar , 2021 101. Melsted, P. ∙ Booeshaghi, A.S. ∙ Liu, L. ... Modular, efficient and constant-memory single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :813-818 Google Scholar ), giving an approximate sequencing depth of 100,000 reads per cell. The total number of transcripts detected across all cells was 26,259 (58.3%) out of 45,044 RNAs in the transcriptome. The mean number of genes per cell ranged between 1,227 for Segment 7 and 1,219 for Segment 6 (CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1915 and https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ).
Kallisto alignment files were quantified with BUStools (v.0.39.3) ( Melsted et al., 2021 101. Melsted, P. ∙ Booeshaghi, A.S. ∙ Liu, L. ... Modular, efficient and constant-memory single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing Nat. Biotechnol. 2021; 39 :813-818 Google Scholar ) and loaded into R using BUSpaRse ( Moses and Pachter, 2021 105. Moses, L. ∙ Pachter, L. BUSpaRse: kallisto | bustools R utilities, R Package Version 1.4.2 2021 Google Scholar ). First, we used knee plot method s as implemented in DropletUtils ( Lun et al., 2019 91. Lun, A.T.L. ∙ Riesenfeld, S. ∙ Andrews, T. ..., 1st Human Cell Atlas Jamboree EmptyDrops: distinguishing cells from empty droplets in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing data Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :63 Google Scholar ) to filter empty droplets before downstream analysis in Seurat v3.1 ( Stuart et al., 2019 147. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Google Scholar ). To create Seurat objects for each library, we filtered cells with low (nFeature_RNA > 200) or overly large (nFeature_RNA > 15,000) transcript counts, merged all objects into one for quality assessment, and then split by library for normalization and scaling. From three 10x runs for Segment 7 and two 10x runs for Segment 6, we obtained 10,364 high-quality cells after stringent filtering (4,663 and 5,701 cells from Segments 6 and 7, respectively). Individual transcript counts in each cell were normalized by the total number of counts for that cell, multiplied by a scale factor (10,000), and natural log-transformed (NormalizeData function). Expression of each transcript was scaled to achieve a mean of zero and variance of 1 across cells (ScaleData function). Transcripts with high overall expression and variance across cells were identified (FindVariableFeatures function; highest standardized variance was selected by selection.method = ‘vst’). Subsequently, all five objects (libraries) were integrated, and shared sources of variation were identified by Seurat CCA alignment ( Butler et al., 2018 29. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2019 147. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive Integration of Single-Cell Data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Google Scholar ). We selected the 3000 most variable transcripts across datasets (SelectIntegrationFeatures function) and used this set of transcripts to identify correspondences among the datasets, termed anchors (FindIntegrationAnchors function). Anchors were used to integrate the five datasets (IntegrateData function). The integrated Seurat object was again scaled and used as input for dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Subsequently, we constructed a Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) graph for the dataset (FindNeighbors function) using the first 20 principal components of the PCA as well as an SNN pruning cutoff of 0.067 before performing cell clustering with the Louvain algorithm (FindClusters function; resolution of 0.25-1.0). We eventually used a resolution of 0.55, as this resulted in the separation of cell clusters that we had previously identified as different cell types by HCR (see CaltechData: https://doi.org/10.22002/D1.1918 ). Finally, we ran the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction technique on the 20 principal components using default options, creating the abdominal cell type atlas ( Becht et al., 2018 13.

To annotate cell types, differentially expressed transcripts in cell clusters were identified in Seurat v3.1 (FindAllMarkers function) using both the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test as well as ROC analysis. Marker transcripts were computed using default settings for each cluster individually (FindMarkers function). A dendrogram was built in Past 4.02 ( Hammer et al., 2001 65. Hammer, O. ∙ Harper, D.A. ∙ Ryan, P.D. PAST: Paleontological statistics software package for education and data analysis Palaeontol. Electronica. 2001; 4 :9 Google Scholar ) using neighbor joining clustering (NJ) (see Musser et al. [2021 106. Musser, J.M. ∙ Schippers, K.J. ∙ Nickel, M. ... Profiling cellular diversity in sponges informs animal cell type and nervous system evolution Science. 2021; 374 :717-723 Google Scholar ] for a similar approach) on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix (n = 10,000 bootstraps) based on the normalized and scaled cluster average expression profiles of the 3000 most variable transcripts. We used the list of overall differentially expressed genes, the individual cluster markers, the results of the NJ clustering and the transcript annotation, to connect cell types to known cell type classes using published marker genes from fly expression data using http://flybase.org/ , https://www.uniprot.org/ and https://bgee.org ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1915 ).
To test the robustness of NJ clustering, we employed random forest analysis to assign cells to their pre-defined cell type classes. Random forest is a machine learning classifier that assigns samples (here cells) to predefined groups (here cell type classes) in multiple iterations and estimates the correct classification ( Breiman, 2001 22. Breiman, L. Random Forests Mach. Learn. 2001; 45 :5-32 Google Scholar ). For the analysis, ntree = 1,000 bootstrap replicates were drawn with mtry = 55 variables randomly selected at each node. A confusion matrix showing the number of correctly assigned cell communities to either cell type as well as proportional class errors and total out-of-basket (OOB) estimate of error rates were computed.
We used the filtered cells-by-transcripts count matrix (10,634 cells by 26,259 transcripts) to infer gene expression programs (GEPs) of single cells using consensus Non-negative Matrix Factorization (cNMF) as implemented in Python ( Kotliar et al., 2019 81. Kotliar, D. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq eLife. 2019; 8 :e43803 Google Scholar ). The method takes the count matrix (N cells x T transcripts) as input and produces both a gene expression program (GEP) x T matrix and a N x GEP matrix that specify the usage of each program for each cell in the data. The cNMF implementation runs multiple NMFs for each number of components (K) over a range of selected K, and combines the results of each replicate for different K to obtain more robust consensus estimates for the stability (silhouette score) and Frobenius error of each NMF model ( Kotliar et al., 2019 81. Kotliar, D. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq eLife. 2019; 8 :e43803 Google Scholar ). We selected the most over-dispersed transcripts (T = 2000) using v-scoring ( Klein et al., 2015 79. Klein, A.M. ∙ Mazutis, L. ∙ Akartuna, I. ... Droplet barcoding for single-cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells Cell. 2015; 161 :1187-1201 Google Scholar ) as the input for cNMF, which is essential for performing cNMF on biologically meaningful transcriptional variation ( Kotliar et al., 2019 81. Kotliar, D. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq eLife. 2019; 8 :e43803 Google Scholar ). Expression of each over-dispersed transcript T was then scaled to unit variance and subjected to cNMF over a broad range of K (K = 16-36). The cNMF implementation was run with default parameters with the maximum number of iterations set to 250. Each iteration was run on the same normalized dataset over the range of Ks but with different randomly selected seeds. Subsequently, the factorizations for all iterations of each K were combined and the stability and error were computed. To choose the number of components K, we followed several approaches suggested by Kotliar et al. (2019) 81. Kotliar, D. ∙ Veres, A. ∙ Nagy, M.A. ... Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq eLife. 2019; 8 :e43803 Google Scholar ; i) we plotted the stability and error as a function of K ( Alexandrov et al., 2013 1. Alexandrov, L.B. ∙ Nik-Zainal, S. ∙ Wedge, D.C. ... Deciphering signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer Cell Rep. 2013; 3 :246-259 Google Scholar ), ii) performed a scree plot analysis of variance explained per principal component for the same dataset to confirm the appropriate choice of K (Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem; Eckart and Young, 1936 49. Eckart, C. ∙ Young, G. The approximation of one matrix by another of lower rank Psychometrika. 1936; 1 :211-218 Google Scholar ) and iii) re-ran the same cNMF steps with a variable number of over-dispersed T to see whether stability and error converge on a similar K (CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1915 and https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ; Data S3 ).
Ultimately, we selected K = 20 and proceeded with the downstream cNMF workflow using default options, with density threshold r set to 0.05 in order to filter out replicates with low matching to a respective GEP ( Data S3 ). We used the K = 20 cNMF dataset to calculate the normalized GEP usage score for each cell, and then loaded the cell type or cell class assignment from our previous Seurat clustering/NJ+random forest analysis into Python to calculate GEP usage (in %) for each cell type/class. The resulting GEP usage matrix for each cell type was visualized as a heatmap. We also exported the normalized cells-to-GEPs (N x GEP) and GEPs-to-transcript (GEP x T) matrices (CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1915 ) and loaded the N x GEP matrix into R as a matrix, integrating the GEP usage data as a new assay into the pre-existing Seurat object (CreateAssayObject function). This enabled us to plot % GEP usage across single cells, permitting visualization of GEP usage across the UMAP cell atlas.
Finally, we extracted the expression data for the GEP9 to examine its composition ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1915 ). We assigned GO terms to each GEP9 transcript and performed over-representation analysis ( Yu et al., 2012 167. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Google Scholar ) of GO terms to visualize the number of genes for each GO-term after GO-slim. GO terms for the respective gene models were assigned based on the gene id with highest homology from the SwissProt database (download February 2019) or NCBI nr database (downloaded February 2019). A custom database of GO terms was created with makeOrgPackage function in the R package AnnotationForge v1.26.0 ( Carlson and Pages, 2019 32. Carlson, M. ∙ Pages, H. AnnotationForge: tools for building SQLite-based annotation data packages. R package version 1.36.0 2019 https://bioconductor.org/packages/AnnotationForge Google Scholar ). Over-representation analysis of GO terms was tested using the enrichGO function in the R package clusterProfiler v3.12.0 ( Yu et al., 2012 167. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.-G. ∙ Han, Y. ... clusterProfiler: an R package for comparing biological themes among gene clusters OMICS. 2012; 16 :284-287 Google Scholar ) with a hypergeometric distribution and a Fisher’s Exact test. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate correction ( Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 14. Benjamini, Y. ∙ Hochberg, Y. Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing J R Stat Soc Series B Stat Methodol. 1995; 57 :289-300 Crossref Google Scholar ). Enriched GO-terms were subsequently visualized using the REViGO tool available at http://revigo.irb.hr and the MonaGO tool available at https://monago.erc.monash.edu/ .
Genomic DNA was isolated using a non-destructive extraction method described by Maruyama and Parker (2017) 98. Maruyama, M. ∙ Parker, J. Deep-Time Convergence in Rove Beetle Symbionts of Army Ants Curr. Biol. 2017; 27 :920-926 Google Scholar for Coproporus and Drusilla canaliculata or, for Tachinus , using the QIAGEN Blood & Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA quantity was assessed using the Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA kit (Thermo Scientific) and DNA integrity was assessed with Bioanalyzer. Illumina paired-end libraries (2 × 150bp) were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq DNA kit or NEBNext Ultra FS DNA library kit and sequenced on either the Illumina HiSeq X platform by Iridian Genomes/J. Parker and collaborators, or the HiSeq 2500 platform by the Millard and Muriel Jacobs Genetics and Genomics Laboratory at California Institute of Science and Technology. Reads for Coproporus and Drusilla were previously deposited on NCBI’s Sequence read archive ( Coproporus SRA id: SRR4301367; Drusilla SRA id: SRR5906249). Additionally, we downloaded reads of Aleochara bilineata (NICBI BioProject: PRJNA378164) ( Kraaijeveld et al., 2019 83. Kraaijeveld, K. ∙ Neleman, P. ∙ Mariën, J. ... Genomic Resources for Goniozus legneri, Aleochara bilineata and Paykullia maculata, Representing Three Independent Origins of the Parasitoid Lifestyle in Insects. G3 (Bethesda). 2019; 9 :987-991 Google Scholar ), re-assembled the genome and performed gene prediction.
Read quality for each taxon was assessed using FastQC v0.11.8 ( Andrews, 2010 4. Andrews, S. FastQC: a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data 2010 https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ Google Scholar ). Illumina adapters, low-quality bases (phred scores below 15) and reads shorter than 50 bp were removed using cutadapt v1.18 ( Martin, 2011 97. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnet. J. 2011; 17 :10-12 Google Scholar ). A preliminary assembly constructed from the filtered, adaptor-trimmed reads using MEGAHIT v1.1.3 ( Li et al., 2016 86. Li, D. ∙ Luo, R. ∙ Liu, C.-M. ... MEGAHIT v1.0: A fast and scalable metagenome assembler driven by advanced methodologies and community practices. Methods. 2016; 102 :3-11 Google Scholar ) with multiple k-mers (–k-list = 21, 29, 39, 59, 79, 99, 119) was filtered for bacterial contamination using Blobtools v1.0 ( Laetsch and Blaxter, 2017 84. Laetsch, D.R. ∙ Blaxter, M.L. BlobTools: Interrogation of genome assemblies. F1000Res. 2017; 6 :1287 Google Scholar ). Contigs with sequence similarity to bacterial sequences to the NCBI nt database (downloaded February 2019, Evalue 1e-25) were removed. The filtered contigs were then assembled into scaffolds with three iterations of the Redundans v0.14a ( Pryszcz and Gabaldón, 2016 123. Pryszcz, L.P. ∙ Gabaldón, T. Redundans: an assembly pipeline for highly heterozygous genomes Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 :e113 Google Scholar ) reference-based pipeline using the Dalotia v1 genome assembly as the reference (–iters 3,–limit 0.5,–nogapclosing). Scaffolds smaller than 1 kb were removed and gaps filled using GapCloser v1.12 ( Luo et al., 2012 92. Luo, R. ∙ Liu, B. ∙ Xie, Y. ... SOAPdenovo2: an empirically improved memory-efficient short-read de novo assembler Gigascience. 2012; 1 :18 Google Scholar ). Genome completeness was measured against the conserved Arthropoda v10 gene set (n = 1013 single-copy genes) using BUSCO v4.1.1 ( Simão et al., 2015 137. Simão, F.A. ∙ Waterhouse, R.M. ∙ Ioannidis, P. ... BUSCO: assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness with single-copy orthologs Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :3210-3212 Google Scholar ).
Species-specific repetitive elements were identified with RepeatModeler v 1.0.11 ( Smit and Hubley, 2008 139. Smit, A.F. ∙ Hubley, R. RepeatModeler Open-1.0 2008 https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=c1050e3d-8dc1-48ba-81c8-b372af25be50 Google Scholar ) and MITE tracker ( Crescente et al., 2018 35. Crescente, J.M. ∙ Zavallo, D. ∙ Helguera, M. ... MITE Tracker: an accurate approach to identify miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements in large genomes BMC Bioinformatics. 2018; 19 :348 Google Scholar ) as described by ( Brückner et al., 2021 26.

Molecular evolutionary trends and biosynthesis pathways in the Oribatida revealed by the genome of Archegozetes longisetosus Biorxiv. 2021; 2020.12.10.420141 Google Scholar ). Repeats were further filtered for genuine gene products through sequence similarity searches against a local protein database of beetle sequences (RefSeq: GCF_001937115.1, GCF_000699045.2, GCF_000390285.2, GCF_000355655.1, GCF_000500325.1, GCF_001412225.1, GCF_000648695.1, GCA_001443705.1, GCF_000002335.3). Unclassified repeats with sequence similarity to known TEs were retained (E-value 1e-5) whereas those with no blast homology were removed ( Petersen et al., 2019 114. Petersen, M. ∙ Armisén, D. ∙ Gibbs, R.A. ... Diversity and evolution of the transposable element repertoire in arthropods with particular reference to insects BMC Evol. Biol. 2019; 19 :11 Google Scholar ). Predicted repeats that were 80% identical were clustered with vsearch v 2.7.1 (–iddef 1–id 0.8–strand both) ( Rognes et al., 2016 129. Rognes, T. ∙ Flouri, T. ∙ Nichols, B. ... VSEARCH: a versatile open source tool for metagenomics PeerJ. 2016; 4 :e2584 Google Scholar ). The final repeat library was used to soft mask the assemblies using RepeatMasker v 4.07 ( Smit, 2004 138. Smit, A.F. Repeat-Masker Open-3.0 2004 http://www.Repeatmasker.Org Google Scholar ). For Coproporus , Tachinus and A. bilineata , a combination of ab inito (GeneMark-ES v.4.33 ( Ter-Hovhannisyan et al., 2008 150. Ter-Hovhannisyan, V. ∙ Lomsadze, A. ∙ Chernoff, Y.O. ... Gene prediction in novel fungal genomes using an ab initio algorithm with unsupervised training Genome Res. 2008; 18 :1979-1990 Google Scholar ) and Augustus v3.2.3 ( Stanke and Waack, 2003 143. Stanke, M. ∙ Waack, S. Gene prediction with a hidden Markov model and a new intron submodel Bioinformatics. 2003; 19 :ii215-ii225 Google Scholar ) and reference proteome tools (GeMoMA v1.6.1 ( Keilwagen et al., 2019 77. Keilwagen, J. ∙ Hartung, F. ∙ Grau, J. GeMoMa: Homology-Based Gene Prediction Utilizing Intron Position Conservation and RNA-seq Data Methods Mol. Biol. 2019; 1962 :161-177 Google Scholar )) were used to predict coding sequences. For Drusilla , in addition to the tools above, male and female whole body transcriptome evidence was used in two ways, through read mapping using BRAKER v2.1.2 ( Brůna et al., 2021 27. Brůna, T. ∙ Hoff, K.J. ∙ Lomsadze, A. ... BRAKER2: automatic eukaryotic genome annotation with GeneMark-EP+ and AUGUSTUS supported by a protein database Nar. Genom. Bioinform. 2021; 3 :lqaa108 Scopus (288) Google Scholar ) and de novo Trinity assembled transcripts mapping using PASA v2.3.3 ( Haas et al., 2008 63. Haas, B.J. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. ∙ Zhu, W. ... Automated eukaryotic gene structure annotation using EVidenceModeler and the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R7 Google Scholar ). Gene predictions were combined using EVidenceModeler v.1.1.1 ( Haas et al., 2008 63. Haas, B.J. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. ∙ Zhu, W. ... Automated eukaryotic gene structure annotation using EVidenceModeler and the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R7 Google Scholar ) with the following weights for Corproporus and Tachinus : ab inito evidence = 1 and protein evidence = 5; and for Drusilla : ab inito evidence = 1, protein evidence = 1, PASA = 10, and BRAKER = 4.
Samples for RNaseq of Lissagria laeviuscula females and males (whole body) as well as Platyusa sonomae female and males (head and rest of the body separate) were placed in RNAlater and subsequently extracted following the Trizol protocol. Extracted RNA was shipped to Omega Bioservices (Norcross, GA, USA) on dry ice for library preparation and sequencing. The RNA for each sample was poly-A selected, cDNA was synthesized, and the final libraries were prepared following the Illumina TruSeq mRNA Stranded Kit protocol. Libraries were sequenced with ∼90 million 150 bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HighSeq4000 platform. For each species, RNaseq reads were combined, in silico normalized and used for de novo transcriptome assembly with Trinity v2.8.4 ( Grabherr et al., 2011 61. Grabherr, M.G. ∙ Haas, B.J. ∙ Yassour, M. ... Full-length transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data without a reference genome Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :644-652 Google Scholar ). Sequences for each transcriptome were clustered and concatenated to remove duplications using CD-HIT ( Fu et al., 2012 60. Fu, L. ∙ Niu, B. ∙ Zhu, Z. ... CD-HIT: accelerated for clustering the next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :3150-3152 Google Scholar ) with a sequence identity threshold of 0.95. We then ran TransDecoder ( Haas et al., 2013 64. Haas, B.J. ∙ Papanicolaou, A. ∙ Yassour, M. ... De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1494-1512 Google Scholar ) to predict the longest ORFs and obtained preliminary annotations of transcripts by blastx search ( Altschul et al., 1990 2. Altschul, S.F. ∙ Gish, W. ∙ Miller, W. ... Basic local alignment search tool J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215 :403-410 Google Scholar ) of all transcripts against the non-redundant NCBI protein database ( Pruitt et al., 2007 122. Pruitt, K.D. ∙ Tatusova, T. ∙ Maglott, D.R. NCBI reference sequences (RefSeq): a curated non-redundant sequence database of genomes, transcripts and proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35 :D61-D65 Google Scholar ).
To infer enzyme relationships, we first ran TransDecoder ( Haas et al., 2013 64. Haas, B.J. ∙ Papanicolaou, A. ∙ Yassour, M. ... De novo transcript sequence reconstruction from RNA-seq using the Trinity platform for reference generation and analysis Nat. Protoc. 2013; 8 :1494-1512 Google Scholar ) using default settings to predict the longest ORFs in the bulk Dalotia transcriptome and translate them into protein sequences. We then ran cd-hit ( Fu et al., 2012 60. Fu, L. ∙ Niu, B. ∙ Zhu, Z. ... CD-HIT: accelerated for clustering the next-generation sequencing data Bioinformatics. 2012; 28 :3150-3152 Google Scholar ) with default options and a sequence identity threshold of 0.9 on this protein set to cluster them and remove short-length sequence artifacts. The protein sequences of eight previously published beetle genomes and Drosophila melanogaster were downloaded (see Key Resources Table ) and combined with the predicted protein sequences from the newly generated genomic data for Coproporus and Tachinus (outgroup Tachyporinae) and Drusilla canaliculata (Aleocharinae: Lomechusini), as well as transcriptome data for Lissagria laeviuscula (Aleocharinae: Falagriini) and Platyusa sonomae (Aleocharinae: Lomechusini) (protein datasets listed below and deposited at CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1919 ). We again ran cd-hit with default options and an identity threshold of 0.98 to remove isoforms. The protein sets were clustered into orthogroups with Orthofinder v2 ( Emms and Kelly, 2015 50. Emms, D.M. ∙ Kelly, S. OrthoFinder: solving fundamental biases in whole genome comparisons dramatically improves orthogroup inference accuracy Genome Biol. 2015; 16 :157 Google Scholar , 2019 51. Emms, D.M. ∙ Kelly, S. OrthoFinder: phylogenetic orthology inference for comparative genomics Genome Biol. 2019; 20 :238 Google Scholar ), using initial Diamond sequence alignment ( Buchfink et al., 2015 28. Buchfink, B. ∙ Xie, C. ∙ Huson, D.H. Fast and sensitive protein alignment using DIAMOND Nat. Methods. 2015; 12 :59-60 Google Scholar ) and MCL clustering ( Enright et al., 2002 52. Enright, A.J. ∙ Van Dongen, S. ∙ Ouzounis, C.A. An efficient algorithm for large-scale detection of protein families Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30 :1575-1584 Google Scholar ) to assign orthogroups. This was followed by multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT ( Katoh and Standley, 2013 74. Katoh, K. ∙ Standley, D.M. MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software version 7: improvements in performance and usability Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30 :772-780 Google Scholar ) to align orthogroups and FastTree 2 ( Price et al., 2010 121. Price, M.N. ∙ Dehal, P.S. ∙ Arkin, A.P. FastTree 2--approximately maximum-likelihood trees for large alignments PLoS ONE. 2010; 5 :e9490 Google Scholar ) to infer Maximum Likelihood protein trees for each orthogroup. When then used the orthogroup alignments containing our target sequences and concatenated them into one master fasta-file for each enzyme family and realigned the protein sequences using MAFFT. All alignment files and tree files have been deposited at CaltechData ( https://data.caltech.edu/records/1916 ). Master alignments were each analyzed using IQ-TREE v1.6.12 ( Nguyen et al., 2015 107. Nguyen, L.-T. ∙ Schmidt, H.A. ∙ von Haeseler, A. ... IQ-TREE: a fast and effective stochastic algorithm for estimating maximum-likelihood phylogenies Mol. Biol. Evol. 2015; 32 :268-274 Google Scholar ) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Where appropriate, enzyme trees were rooted using D. melanogaster . Trees were visualized with FigTree v1.4.4 ( Rambaut, 2012 126. Rambaut, A. FigTree v1.4.1 2012 http://Tree.Biol.Ed.Ac.Uk/Software/Figtree/ Google Scholar ). For most trees, we used Drosophila sequences as an outgroup. The laccase tree in Figure 6 G is unrooted because the outgroup of insect laccases is unknown.
To characterize the cytochrome P450s of Dalotia belonging to the 4G subfamily, we downloaded a curated dataset of > 350 sequences by Feyereisen (2020) 55. Feyereisen, R. Origin and evolution of the CYP4G subfamily in insects, cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2020; 143 :106695 Google Scholar and added the two Dalotia paralogs, performing a phylogenetic analysis with the same parameters as described in Feyereisen (2020) 55. Feyereisen, R. Origin and evolution of the CYP4G subfamily in insects, cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2020; 143 :106695 Google Scholar . The tree was rooted with a Panonychus citri CYP450 sequence.
Synthetic cDNAs encoding the three laccases (Dmd, Lac1 and Lac2) were codon optimized for E. coli (CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1917 ). Sequences were cloned into pTEV16 ( VanDrisse and Escalante-Semerena, 2016 154. VanDrisse, C.M. ∙ Escalante-Semerena, J.C. New high-cloning-efficiency vectors for complementation studies and recombinant protein overproduction in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica Plasmid. 2016; 86 :1-6 Google Scholar ) with a cleavable N-terminal 6xHis tag and TEV protease site. All proteins were expressed in BL21 competent E. coli cells (provided by C. VanDrisse, Caltech). Cells were grown in TB and protein expression was induced by 0.25 mM IPTG at OD600 ≈0.7 and harvested after 12 h at 20°C. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing six times in lysis buffer (50 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, DNase, and Thermo Scientific Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail). Proteins were passed over a column with Ni-NTA resin at room temperature, washed with 50 mM MES, 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole (pH = 7.5) and then eluted with 50 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole (pH = 7.5). Proteins were dialyzed with Thermo Scientific SnakeSkin for 4 h at room temperature into a final buffer of 10 mM MES and 100 mM CuSO 4 and then concentrated to 5 mg/ml for experiments and storage at −80ᵒC.
Enzymatic activity of each protein was tested against a standard substrate, ABTS ( Data S6 A). The reaction mixture was prepared as 5 mM MES, 0.3 M CuSO 4 , and 2 mM of ABTS, with 2 μM of laccase. The UV spectrum was traced for three minutes ( Data S6 B). Subsequently, reactions were quenched with 5 M urea. To verify the RNAi results of the gland laccase Dmd, we set up the following reaction: 2mM of each HQ (1,4-hydroquinone, 2-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone and 2-methoxy-3-methy-1,4-hydroquinone) was separately added to vials containing the same reaction buffer previously used. A pilot experiment was set up for each compound and Dmd protein was added (same concentration as above) ( Data S6 C). this experiment was run for 10 min to determine the quenching time for the enzyme reactions via UV recordings every 30 s. Subsequently, 20 samples for each compound were prepared using the same method. To half of the samples we added 0.5 mM Dmd, while the other half served as control. Reactions were UV recorded for 1 minute and directly quenched with 0.05 M EDTA before being flash frozen and stored at −80ᵒC until further analysis. For the comparative analysis of Dmd, Laccase 1 and Laccase 2 we used the same buffers and substrates as previously. A total of three replicates and the same number of controls for each substrate-enzyme combination (i.e., 36 samples in total) were assayed.
To prepare samples for chemical profiling with either GC-FID or GC/MS for the Dmd versus control and comparative laccase assay, respectively, we used the following liquid-liquid extraction protocol. Frozen reaction mixtures were thawed and transferred into a clean glass vial with a sealed Teflon lid. For extraction, the aqueous phase was washed twice with 100 μl freshly Na 2 SO 4 -dried hexane. Organic fractions were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 and carefully concentrated under a gentle stream of N 2 to a volume of ≈50 μl. For chemical analyses sample aliquots (1 μl) were injected by an AOC-20i autosampler system from Shimadzu, into split/splitless-injector which operated in splitless-mode at a temperature of 310°C. Either a GCMSQP2020 gas chromatography/mass-spectrometry system or a GC-2010PLUS with a flame-ionization detector (all Shimadzu, Kyōto, Japan) both equipped with a ZB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm ID, df = 0.25 μm) from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) were used. Helium was used as the carrier-gas with a constant flow rate of 2.13 ml/min. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: column temperature at the start was 40°C with a 1-minute hold after which the temperature was initially increased 50°C/min to 250°C and further increased 60°C/min to a final temperature of 300°C and held for 2 minutes. For the MS, electron impact ionization spectra were recorded at 70 eV ion source voltage, with a scan rate of 0.2 scans/sec from m/z 40 to 450. The ion source of the mass spectrometer and the transfer line were kept at 230°C and 320°C, respectively. For the FID, detector temperature was kept at 350°C. For quantification of the endpoint data (in ng) we used synthetic 1,4-BQ, 2-methyl-1,4-BQ (Sigma-Aldrich) and freshly synthesized 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-BQ (see below).
To measure the surface-coating ability and extensional viscosity of different artificial mixtures of synthetic secretions, we used dripping-onto-substrate (DoS) rheology. In contrast to conventional rheology which requires sample sizes on the order of milliliters, a DoS measurement can be accomplished with microliters. The instrument comprises a controlled dispensing system, a nozzle and a high-speed camera ( Dinic et al., 2017 43. Dinic, J. ∙ Jimenez, L.N. ∙ Sharma, V.

Sousa, P.C. ∙ Vega, E.J. ∙ Sousa, R.G. ... Measurement of relaxation times in extensional flow of weakly viscoelastic polymer solutions Rheol. Acta. 2017; 56 :11-20 Google Scholar ). Mixtures were prepared using 1,4-BQ, 2-methyl-1,4-BQ, undecane, isopropyl decanoate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl dodecanoate (all Sigma Aldrich). 2-Methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-BQ was synthesized as follows: 2 mmol 2-Methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-hydroquinone (Sigma Aldrich) and 2 mmol NaIO 4 were mixed in a 50 mL round-bottom flask and 10 mL CH 2 Cl 2 and 5 mL of water were then added. The biphasic mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min and the layers were subsequently separated and then the aqueous layer was washed with 10 mL CH 2 Cl 2 . All organic fractions were combined, dried over Na 2 SO 4 and concentrated in vacuo .
The all-compound mixture mimicking the beetles’ secretion was prepared by mixing 8 mg 1,4-benzoquinone, 18 mg 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, 10 mg 2-methoxy-3-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, 47 mg undecane, 7 mg isopropyl decanoate, 13 mg ethyl decanoate and 7 mg ethyl dodecanoate. For some experimental mixtures, undecane was replaced by tridecane, pentadecane, heptadecane or heptacosane (all Sigma Aldrich). The ratios of compounds in all mixtures always represented the average ratios of the respective compounds in Dalotia ’s gland secretion ( Figure 1 D). Mixtures were dispensed at a rate of 0.02 ml/min through the nozzle with an inner diameter of 0.413 mm and outer diameter of 0.718 mm onto an aluminum substrate a distance of 2.5 mm below the nozzle. The fluid transitions from the nozzle to substrate via an unstable liquid bridge. The behavior of this liquid bridge was captured by the camera at 20,000 to 40,000 frames per second and analyzed to produce rheological data on the fluid (CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1905 and https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ). Each measurement was repeated at least 3 times and the videos were processed using Python 3. Briefly, the videos were converted to a series of binary images and the minimum diameter at each frame was recorded. The code and parameters for each video are available in the supplement (CaltechData: https://data.caltech.edu/records/1918 ). This yielded a dataset of diameter and time which was fit to an equation describing power-law fluids: 𝑅 𝑅 0 = 𝑌 ⁢ ( 𝑡 𝑝 − 𝑡 ) 𝑛 Here, R 0 is 0.359 mm, n is the flow behavior index, and t p is the pinch-off time, the moment the liquid bridge separates from the substrate. This equation was solved to estimate the elongational-flow consistency index Y (1/s n ) and the flow behavior index n. Y describes what happens if a flow in imposed on fluid, while n describes how Y changes as the flow rate changes. Y decreases as the ratio of surface tension to viscosity decreases. When n = 1, mixtures behave as Newtonian fluids (no change with flow rate) and when n≠ 1 they behave as non-Newtonian fluid or power law fluids. For n < 1, fluid flows more easily (shear thinning) as the flow rate increases. The closer n is to 1, the weaker is the dependence on flow rate. For n > 1, the fluid more strongly resists flowing (shear thickening). Fluids with both low Y and low n possess higher extensional viscosity (EV). Furthermore, previous work has shown Y = φ(n)σ/K ( Doshi et al., 2003 45. Doshi, P. ∙ Suryo, R. ∙ Yildirim, O.E. ... Scaling in pinch-off of generalized Newtonian fluids J Non-Newton Fluid. 2003; 113 :1-27 Google Scholar ). This is the product of the shape factor, φ(n), and surface tension divided by the power-law flow consistency index ( Blair et al., 1939 17. Blair, G.W.S. ∙ Hening, J.C. ∙ Wagstaff, A. The Flow of Cream through Narrow Glass Tubes J. Phys. Chem. 1939; 43 :853-864 Google Scholar ). The data fit this power-law function from the last frame with R/R 0 = 1 to t = t p , with 0 to 5 datapoints (a maximum of ∼125 μs) excluded near t p because during this period the fluid deviates from the power-law behavior. We solved the previous equation to get K/σ which is the ratio of the flow consistency index and surface tension. We interpret this ratio as a metric of how a fluid flows over a surface at a given surface tension. K/σ can therefore be used as a proxy to describe the ability of a mixture to coat a surface, like the cuticle of other insects. We refer to this metric as the surface coating ability (SCA).
