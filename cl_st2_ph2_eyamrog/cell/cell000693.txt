Title: TREM2 drives microglia response to amyloid-β via SYK-dependent and -independent pathways


Abstract: Summary

Genetic studies have highlighted microglia as pivotal in orchestrating Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Microglia that adhere to Aβ plaques acquire a transcriptional signature, “disease-associated microglia” (DAM), which largely emanates from the TREM2-DAP12 receptor complex that transmits intracellular signals through the protein tyrosine kinase SYK. The human TREM2 R47H variant associated with high AD risk fails to activate microglia via SYK. We found that SYK-deficient microglia cannot encase Aβ plaques, accelerating brain pathology and behavioral deficits. SYK deficiency impaired the PI3K-AKT-GSK-3β-mTOR pathway, incapacitating anabolic support required for attaining the DAM profile. However, SYK-deficient microglia proliferated and advanced to an Apoe -expressing prodromal stage of DAM; this pathway relied on the adapter DAP10, which also binds TREM2. Thus, microglial responses to Aβ involve non-redundant SYK- and DAP10-pathways. Systemic administration of an antibody against CLEC7A, a receptor that directly activates SYK, rescued microglia activation in mice expressing the TREM2 R47H allele, unveiling new options for AD immunotherapy.

Section: Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of late-onset dementia worldwide ( Alzheimer’s Association, 2021 1. Alzheimer’s Association 2021 Alzheimer’s disease facts and figures Alzheimers Dement. 2021; 17 :327-406 Crossref Scopus (1726) PubMed Google Scholar ). AD pathology features extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and hyperphosphorylation of intraneuronal Tau, causing neuronal and synaptic loss, ultimately leading to cognitive impairment ( Long and Holtzman, 2019 27. Long, J.M. ∙ Holtzman, D.M. Alzheimer disease: an update on pathobiology and treatment strategies Cell. 2019; 179 :312-339 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1677) PubMed Google Scholar ). Microglia are professional phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS) that contribute to CNS development, homeostasis, and defense ( Prinz et al., 2021 40.

In response to Aβ pathology, microglia proliferate, associate with Aβ plaques, and acquire an activated transcriptional profile, commonly referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM) ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 23.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has further resolved DAM complexity, identifying four signatures of microglia in amyloid pathology, namely DAM proper (enriched for ApoE , Spp1 , Clec7a , Cd11c , Cst7 , and Lpl ), MHC class II (MHCII) microglia (enriched for MHC-II molecules and Cd74 ), type I interferon-responsive (IFN-R) microglia (enriched for Ifitm3 , Bst2 , and Stat1 ), and proliferating microglia (enriched for Mki67 and Top2a ) ( Mathys et al., 2017 32.

To comprehend beneficial and detrimental functions of plaque-associated microglia, it is necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms of DAM generation.
The microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) binds phospholipids, apoptotic cells, Aβ, and lipoproteins such as ApoE, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ( Atagi et al., 2015 3.

TREM2 associates with the transmembrane adapter DAP12 ( Ulland and Colonna, 2018 55. Ulland, T.K. ∙ Colonna, M. TREM2 — a key player in microglial biology and Alzheimer disease Nat. Rev.

Blunted microglial responses to Aβ along with impaired acquisition of DAM signature are evident in mice deficient for Trem2 or expressing the hypofunctional TREM2 R47H human variant ( Ellwanger et al., 2021 11.

Other than TREM2, there are several immune receptors upregulated in DAM signaling via SYK, including CLEC7A, CD300LB, CD200R4, and the β2 integrin CD11c ( Keren-Shaul et al., 2017 23.

Based on these observations we hypothesized that SYK signaling may play a central role in microglial responses to Aβ.
To test this hypothesis, we crossed the 5xFAD mouse model of amyloid pathology ( Oakley et al., 2006 38. Oakley, H. ∙ Cole, S.L. ∙ Logan, S. ... Intraneuronal β-amyloid aggregates, neurodegeneration, and neuron loss in transgenic mice with five familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations: potential factors in amyloid plaque formation J. Neurosci. 2006; 26 :10129-10140 Crossref Scopus (2423) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Cx3cr1 CreERT2 × Syk fl/fl mice lacking Syk expression in microglia. Using complementary techniques, we demonstrated that SYK-deficient microglia develop an intermediate activation signature in response to Aβ, but fail to attain a complete DAM phenotype, indicating that microglia require cooperation of both SYK-dependent and -independent pathways to elicit an effective response to Aβ. Furthermore, we demonstrated that immunotherapies boosting SYK through CLEC7A improve microglia activation during Aβ pathology, providing a possible therapeutic avenue for AD.

Section: Results

We first tested whether Aβ accumulation activates SYK in microglia. Immunoblot analysis revealed increased SYK phosphorylation in microglia from 5xFAD mice, whereas the total amount of SYK protein was unchanged ( Figure 1 A). Next, we crossed Syk fl/fl mice ( Saijo et al., 2003 43. Saijo, K. ∙ Schmedt, C. ∙ Su, I. ... Essential role of Src-family protein tyrosine kinases in NF-κB activation during B cell development Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4 :274-279 Crossref Scopus (250) PubMed Google Scholar ) with Cx3cr1 CreERT2 mice ( Yona et al., 2013 71. Yona, S. ∙ Kim, K.W. ∙ Wolf, Y. ... Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis Immunity. 2013; 38 :79-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2234) PubMed Google Scholar ), which enable inducible deletion of Syk in Cx3cr1 -positive cells by administration of tamoxifen (TAM). We refer to these mice as Syk iΔMG whereas Syk fl/fl serve as controls. Microglia originate from yolk sac hematopoiesis ( Ginhoux et al., 2010 14. Ginhoux, F. ∙ Greter, M. ∙ Leboeuf, M. ...

Tissue-resident macrophages originate from yolk-sac-derived erythro-myeloid progenitors Nature. 2015; 518 :547-551 Crossref Scopus (1635) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, TAM induction of Cx3cr1 CreERT2 allows for permanent gene deletion in microglia, while bone-marrow-derived monocytes that undergo Cre-mediated recombination are replaced within 4 weeks due to their constant turnover. We further crossed Syk iΔMG mice to 5xFAD mice, which recapitulate features of Aβ pathology characteristic of AD. 1-month-old Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice and Syk fl/fl -5xFAD control mice were fed with TAM-containing chow until 2 months of age and returned to regular chow until 6 or 9 months of age to allow accumulation of Aβ plaques ( Figure 1 B). Using flow cytometry, we showed that SYK protein was greatly reduced in microglia from Syk iΔMG mice, whereas monocytes, neutrophils, and B cells remained unaffected ( Figures S1 A and S1B). Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) exhibited a moderate SYK reduction, consistent with their embryonic origin and slow turnover ( Goldmann et al., 2016 15.

Early fate defines microglia and non-parenchymal brain macrophage development Cell. 2020; 181 :557-573.e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, given the extra-parenchymal localization of BAMs, partial Syk deletion in these cells is unlikely to significantly affect parenchymal Aβ pathology. 9-month-old Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice had markedly less microgliosis and more fibrillar Aβ deposition ( Figures S1 C–S1F). In both the cortex and hippocampus, microglia density within a 15-μm radius from plaque borders was significantly reduced in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice ( Figures 1 C–1E). Likewise, Iba1 + methoxy-X04 + colocalized staining was diminished in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice, indicating fewer plaque-associated microglia. This finding was further confirmed by staining for the transcription factor PU.1, which is expressed solely in microglia in the brain parenchyma. A reduced percentage of plaque-associated PU.1 + nuclei was apparent in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice, whereas the density of PU.1 + nuclei away from the plaques was unchanged ( Figures S1 G–S1I). Of note, no difference in microglia numbers or Iba1 staining was found when comparing Syk iΔMG and Syk fl/fl mice without amyloid pathology ( Figures S1 J–S1L). Thus, SYK appears redundant for microglial development and self-renewal in the steady state. Conversely, SYK signaling is required to induce microglia responses to Aβ plaques.
We asked whether SYK deficiency affected microglial phagocytosis. 3D reconstructions of Iba1, CD68, and methoxy-X04 staining revealed Aβ in microglial CD68 + phagosomes in both genotypes ( Figure 1 F). To quantify Aβ uptake, we injected mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) with methoxy-X04 and analyzed microglia by flow cytometry. Syk iΔMG - 5xFAD mice had fewer methoxy-X04 + microglia, indicating less Aβ engulfment ( Figures 1 G and 1H). To validate this, we assessed pHrodo-labeled Aβ 1–42 uptake in primary microglia cultures by flow cytometry. Since neonatal mice cannot feed on TAM-containing chow, we cultured microglia from P4 mice with constitutive deletion of Syk ( Syk fl/fl × Cx3cr1 Cre , referred to as Syk cΔMG ) ( Yona et al., 2013 71. Yona, S. ∙ Kim, K.W. ∙ Wolf, Y. ... Fate mapping reveals origins and dynamics of monocytes and tissue macrophages under homeostasis Immunity. 2013; 38 :79-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2234) PubMed Google Scholar ). SYK-deficient microglia phagocytosed less Aβ 1–42 than did control microglia ( Figures 1 I and 1J). Thus, SYK deficiency affects microglia clustering around Aβ plaques and Aβ phagocytosis.
We compared Syk iΔMG -5xFAD and Syk fl/fl -5xFAD mice for neuronal damage and behavioral alterations. First, we examined brain accumulation of Aβ 1–42 by immunofluorescence and found that Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice had a significant increase of Aβ 1–42 deposition at both 6 and 9 months ( Figures 2 A and 2B). Aβ 1–42 is prone to aggregation and adhesion to cell membranes ( Masters and Selkoe, 2012 30. Masters, C.L. ∙ Selkoe, D.J. Biochemistry of amyloid β-protein and amyloid deposits in Alzheimer disease Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2 :a006262 Crossref Scopus (443) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mucke and Selkoe, 2012 36. Mucke, L. ∙ Selkoe, D.J. Neurotoxicity of amyloid β-protein: synaptic and network dysfunction Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2 :a006338 Crossref Scopus (822) PubMed Google Scholar ), which makes it highly neurotoxic. Thus, we examined the damage of axons and dendrites (collectively neurites) by staining for LAMP1, which labels vesicles accumulating in dystrophic neurites ( Condello et al., 2015 8. Condello, C. ∙ Yuan, P. ∙ Schain, A. ... Microglia constitute a barrier that prevents neurotoxic protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots around plaques Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :6176 Crossref Scopus (426) PubMed Google Scholar ). LAMP1 staining volume was significantly amplified in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice ( Figures 2 C and 2D), indicating increased neuronal dystrophy. Similar results were observed by staining for the N terminus of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which accumulates in dystrophic neurites ( Figures S2 A and S2B). SYK deficiency in microglia also impacted the shape and compactness of Aβ deposits (inert, dynamic, and filamentous plaques) ( Figure S2 C). Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice had fewer inert plaques at both 6 and 9 months, and more dynamic plaques at 9 months of age ( Figure S2 D).
Lastly, we performed a battery of behavioral tests. 5xFAD mice had impaired learning ability in comparison with non- 5xFAD mice at both 6 and 9 months of age by the end of 5days trials in the Morris water maze ( Figure 2 E); no differences were noted between the Syk fl/fl and Syk iΔMG groups at either age ( Figure 2 F). However, at the memory recall session without a submerged platform, 6-month-old Syk iΔMG - 5xFAD mice spent significantly less time in the target quadrant than did Syk iΔMG mice, whereas no difference was found between Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD and Syk fl/fl mice ( Figure 2 G). At 9 months, both Syk iΔMG - 5xFAD and Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD groups spent less time in the target quadrant than did either Syk iΔMG or Syk fl/fl mice, with Syk iΔMG - 5xFAD mice exhibiting the most significant defect ( Figure 2 G). Latency time to reach the visible platform did not reveal any impairment of visual or swimming ability ( Figure S2 E). Thus, SYK deficiency in microglia accelerates memory impairment in 5xFAD mice.
Mice were also tested at the elevated plus maze, which assesses anxiety levels ( Figure 2 H). At 6 months, Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice made significantly more entries and traveled longer distances in the open arms than did Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD and all non-5XFAD mice ( Figures 2 I and 2J). At 9 months, however, Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD behaved similarly: both made significantly more entries and traveled longer distances in the open arms than did non- 5xFAD mice ( Figures 2 I and 2J). All groups traveled comparable total distances, indicating no locomotor impairment ( Figure S2 F). We conclude that SYK deficiency in microglia exacerbates the Aβ 1–42 load and neuronal damage, worsening behavioral deficits.
TREM2-DAP12 elicits the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, enhancing anabolic and energy production pathways required for microglia activation ( Ulland et al., 2017 56. Ulland, T.K. ∙ Song, W.M. ∙ Huang, S.C.C. ... TREM2 maintains microglial metabolic fitness in Alzheimer’s disease Cell. 2017; 170 :649-663.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we asked whether SYK acts through a similar mechanism. First, we sorted microglia from Syk iΔMG -5xFAD and Syk fl/fl -5xFAD mice ( Figure S3 A) and performed biochemical analyses. SYK deficiency was associated with reduced phosphorylation of AKT and its targets N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β), which are implicated in mTOR activation, protein synthesis and cell-cycle progression ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Conversely, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was not activated in either genotype ( Figure 3 B). Microglia from Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice also had significantly reduced mitochondrial mass ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Further biochemical analysis was conducted in primary microglia cultures from neonatal mice with a constitutive deletion of Syk . Microglia were cultured with or without CSF1-containing medium (LCCM, L-929 cell-conditioned medium) to evaluate sensitivity to metabolic stress. SYK-deficient microglia had reduced phospho-AKT and the mTOR target phospho-S6 kinase (S6K) regardless of the presence of CSF1, indicating a metabolic defect ( Figure S3 B). Thus, SYK-deficient microglia suffer impaired AKT-mTOR signaling. Concurrently, microglia activated autophagy. The LC3II /LC3I ratio was higher in Syk iΔMG :5xFAD microglia, indicating increased autophagy ( Figure 3 E). Consistently, immunofluorescence analysis revealed accumulation of LC3 + autophagosomes in Syk iΔMG :5xFAD microglia ( Figures 3 F, 3G, and S3 C). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) corroborated that microglia from Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice contained abundant multivesicular/multilamellar structures indicative of autophagosomes, which were largely absent in the other genotypes ( Figures 3 H and 3I). TEM also showed that Syk iΔMG :5xFAD microglia accumulated lipid-rich vesicles ( Figures S3 D and S3E). SYK deficiency may impair cholesterol efflux and lipid catabolism, a defect recently observed in TREM2-deficient microglia ( Claes et al., 2021 7. Claes, C. ∙ Danhash, E.P. ∙ Hasselmann, J. ...

We conclude that SYK-deficient microglia exhibit metabolic defects during Aβ pathology, such as impaired AKT-mTOR signaling, along with an increase in autophagy.
We asked whether SYK deficiency affects microglia fitness when induced during disease progression rather than before its onset. We fed Syk iΔMG -5xFAD and Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD control mice with TAM-containing chow from 4 to 5 months of age ( Figure S4 A), when mice have already developed Aβ deposits and microgliosis. One cohort of mice was analyzed at the end of TAM treatment (5 months of age), whereas a second cohort was returned to normal chow and analyzed at 9 months of age ( Figure S4 A). Quantification of plaque-associated microglia in cortex and hippocampus exposed subtle differences between genotypes at 5 months, whereas a significant reduction was observed in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice at 9 months of age ( Figures S4 B and S4C). Furthermore, analysis of the colocalized Iba1 and methoxy-X04 staining revealed a reduction at both 5 and 9 months of age in cortex and hippocampus ( Figures S4 B–S4D). Lastly, we determined whether the total number of microglia was also affected by late Syk deletion. Quantification of PU.1 + nuclei revealed that microglia numbers were slightly but significantly reduced in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice as early as 5 months of age. At 9 months, microglia numbers were elevated in both groups; however, Syk iΔMG - 5xFAD mice had significantly fewer microglia than did Syk fl/fl -5xFAD mice ( Figures S4 E and S4F). These results demonstrate that SYK is required for the maintenance of microglial clustering around Aβ plaques after the onset of disease.
We examined the impact of SYK deficiency on microglial transcriptome during amyloid pathology by scRNA-seq. Single/live CD45 + cells were sorted from Syk fl/fl -5xFAD, Syk iΔMG -5xFAD, Syk fl/fl , and Syk iΔMG cortices, and single-cell transcriptomes were generated using the 10x Genomics platform ( Figure 4 A). After quality control, a total of 89,615 single cells were plotted on uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) dimensions for visualization. Unsupervised clustering revealed a total of 15 distinct clusters across all mice ( Figure S5 A), which were annotated based on differential expression of known cell-type-specific marker genes. The preponderance of cells captured by our scRNA-seq dataset were microglia, with significantly fewer BAMs, monocytes, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils ( Figure S5 B). None of the genotypes had a significant impact on non-microglial cell types.
We next re-clustered microglia only, resulting in 11 distinct clusters comprising 57,830 cells ( Figures 4 B and S5 C). Based on expression of specific marker genes ( Chen and Colonna, 2021 5. Chen, Y. ∙ Colonna, M. Microglia in Alzheimer’s disease at single-cell level. Are there common patterns in humans and mice? J. Exp. Med. 2021; 218 :1-10 Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar ), we identified homeostatic (clusters 0, 1, 2, and 7), DAM (cluster 6), MHCII (cluster 8), IFN-R (cluster 4), and proliferating (clusters 9 and 10) microglia ( Figures 4 B and S5 C–S5H). We also detected two clusters of microglia with intermediate signatures between homeostatic and DAM, defined as transitioning microglia (TM1 and TM2, clusters 3 and 5), which may represent prodromal stages of DAM. We next examined the representation of DAM, TM1, TM2, MHCII, IFN-R, and proliferating microglia clusters in each genotype ( Figure 4 C). Notably, DAM appeared almost entirely represented in Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD mice (93.3%), with a minimal contribution from Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice (5.6%). MHCII and IFN-R microglia were abundant in Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD mice (38.1% and 43.5% respectively), but less represented in the other groups. All genotypes contributed similarly to cycling microglia, though Syk fl/fl contributed the least and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD the most. Breakdown of TM1 among different genotypes showed that 54% of these cells were present in Syk iΔMG :5xFAD microglia, while relatively small percentages were present in the other genotypes ( Figure 4 C). Thus, SYK deficiency in the 5xFAD background mainly affected the generation of DAM. However, TM1 microglia (bona fide prodromal to DAM) were expanded, and microglia cycling was unaffected, in fact elevated. This suggests that a basal microglia response to Aβ pathology is maintained in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice, although microglia are not able to fully develop a DAM phenotype.
To validate these findings, we performed immunofluorescence staining for TMEM119 (homeostatic marker), TREM2, CLEC7A, CD11c (DAM markers), and CD74 (MHCII marker). Consistent with transcriptomic data, we found significantly fewer TREM2 + ( Figures S6 A–S6C), CLEC7A + ( Figures S6 D and S6E), CD11c + ( Figures 4 D and 4E), and CD74 + microglia ( Figures 4 F and 4G) in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice, along with increased TMEM119 + microglia ( Figures S6 D and S6F). These changes were particularly evident in microglia adjacent to Aβ plaques ( Figure S6 D), whereas SYK deficiency had little impact on microglia distal to Aβ plaques. The morphology of non-plaque-associated microglia was also similar in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD and Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD mice ( Figure S6 G). Immunofluorescence staining for the proliferation marker Ki67 exposed similar numbers of Ki67 + microglia in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD and Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD mice ( Figures 4 H and 4I), corroborating scRNA-seq data. We also delved into the characterization of TM1 cells of cluster 3, which were enriched in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice ( Figure 4 J). Analysis of genes differentially expressed among cluster 3, homeostatic cluster 0, and DAM cluster 6 revealed that cluster 3 expressed higher levels of microglia activation genes ( Apoe , Ctsz , Ctsl , and Lyz2 ) than did homeostatic microglia. However, these genes were expressed at lower levels in cluster 3 than in DAM. Conversely, the homeostatic genes Tmem11 9, P2ry12 , and Fcrls were more highly expressed in cluster 3 than in DAM but at lower levels than in homeostatic microglia. DAM also expressed high levels of Cst7 and Lpl , which were not detected in either cluster 3 or cluster 0 ( Figures 4 K and 4L). Analysis of the DAM signature among clusters 0, 3, and 6 indicated that cluster 3 occupies a transitional state between homeostatic microglia and DAM ( Figure 4 M). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially expressed genes in TM and DAM clusters from Syk iΔMG : 5xFAD and Syk fl/fl :5xFAD microglia showed that metabolic pathways were highly affected by SYK deficiency ( Figures S6 H and S6I). We conclude that SYK deficiency and the related metabolic defect prevent the acquisition of a complete DAM phenotype in response to Aβ pathology. However, SYK deficiency does not restrain microglia proliferation and allows accumulation of a microglial population expressing intermediate levels of both homeostatic and DAM genes that is prodromal to DAM.
SYK is a critical component of TREM2 signaling but is also required by other receptors ( Hamerman et al., 2009 19. Hamerman, J.A. ∙ Ni, M. ∙ Killebrew, J.R. ... The expanding roles of ITAM adapters FcRγ and DAP12 in myeloid cells Immunol. Rev. 2009; 232 :42-58 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mócsai et al., 2006 33. Mócsai, A. ∙ Abram, C.L. ∙ Jakus, Z. ... Integrin signaling in neutrophils and macrophages uses adaptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7 :1326-1333 Crossref Scopus (302) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, we sought to examine how SYK deficiency impacts microglia activation in comparison with TREM2 deficiency. To do so, we re-clustered our scRNA-seq data of Syk iΔMG :5xFAD and Syk fl/fl : 5xFAD microglia together with newly generated scRNA-seq data from Trem2 +/+ -5xFAD and Trem2 − / − - 5xFAD microglia. We identified 10 clusters recapitulating the same populations described above ( Figures 5 A and 5B). Because the MHCII cluster (cluster 9) contained only 167 cells, this population was excluded from further analyses. We next analyzed the representation of the remaining microglial clusters in each genotype. Compared with their respective controls, both Syk iΔMG and Trem2 −/− microglia evinced a decrease in DAM (cluster 4), IFN-R (cluster 5), and TM2 (cluster 6, a DAM prodromal stage), whereas some homeostatic populations were expanded (particularly cluster 2). However, an increase in the TM1 transitional stage (cluster 3) was only evident in Syk iΔMG microglia ( Figure 5 C). Moreover, cycling microglia (cluster 8) was depleted Trem2 − / − , but not in Syk iΔMG microglia ( Figure 5 C). Pseudotime trajectory analysis corroborated that the homeostatic population differentiated into three terminal stages (DAM, IFN-R, and cycling microglia). TM1 and TM2 stages appeared to precede DAM, but not IFN-R and cycling clusters ( Figure 5 D). We next considered the distribution of Trem2 −/− and Syk iΔMG microglia along these three trajectories. Trem2 −/− microglia were associated with a complete blockade of all fates. By contrast, Syk iΔMG microglia were partially inhibited along the DAM trajectory with an arrest at the transitional stage TM1, the IFN-R trajectory was moderately impaired, and no defect was observed in the cycling trajectory ( Figure 5 E). Thus, unlike Trem2 −/− microglia, Syk iΔMG microglia can proliferate and initiate a DAM differentiation program, but are unable to reach a DAM terminal stage, resulting in the accumulation of the prodromal stage TM1 ( Figure 5 F).
We then assessed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two genotypes along the DAM trajectory. We identified 16 DEGs, including the DAM signature genes Apoe and Fabp5 , which were both reduced in Trem2 −/− microglia compared with Syk iΔMG and control microglia ( Figure 5 G). Focusing specifically on the TM1 cluster, Apoe was sharply enriched in Syk iΔMG microglia, compared with Trem2 −/− microglia ( Figure 5 H). Collectively, these data suggest that induction of Apoe is TREM2 dependent but SYK independent, at least in part. Yet, absence of SYK impedes the acquisition of a complete DAM signature. To further corroborate this conclusion, we performed immunofluorescence staining for ApoE on brain sections from all analyzed groups ( Figures 5 I and 5J). Both Trem2 − / − - 5xFAD and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice had a reduced percentage of ApoE + plaques compared with respective controls, which is consistent with the significant reduction of DAMs in both genotypes. However, reduction in ApoE + plaques was more significant in Trem2 − / − - 5xFAD mice than in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice (−76.2% versus −36.7% respectively) ( Figures 5 K and 5L). Moreover, the staining pattern of plaque-associated ApoE in Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice appeared more diffuse than in Syk fl/fl - 5xFAD mice ( Figure 5 J). This may be due to the defective clustering of Syk iΔMG microglia and/or tempered ApoE production. We conclude that Aβ pathology may elicit a TREM2 dependent, yet SYK independent, pathway in microglia that is sufficient to support both proliferation and advancement to a prodromal stage of DAM, which is demarcated by simultaneous expression of homeostatic genes and Apoe .
We sought to determine how TREM2 activates microglia independently of SYK. It has been shown that the TREM2-DAP12 complex modulates ERK activation through a pathway independent of SYK ( Peng et al., 2010 39. Peng, Q. ∙ Malhotra, S. ∙ Torchia, J.A. ... TREM2- and DAP12-dependent activation of PI3K requires DAP10 and is inhibited by SHIP1 Sci. Signal. 2010; 3 :ra38 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). We asked whether this pathway could induce the large Apoe + TM1 cluster observed in SYK-deficient microglia. To test this, we used DAP12 knockin mice (known as Dap12 KΔY75 ), which harbor a deletion in the cytoplasmic motif of DAP12 that disrupts signaling without affecting pairing with TREM2 and trafficking to the cell membrane ( Tomasello et al., 2000 53. Tomasello, E. ∙ Desmoulins, P.O. ∙ Chemin, K. ... Combined natural killer cell and dendritic cell functional deficiency in KARAP/DAP12 loss-of-function mutant mice Immunity. 2000; 13 :355-364 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). We then crossed Dap12 KΔY75 with 5xFAD mice and analyzed microglia from 6-month-old Dap12 KΔY75 - 5xFAD and 5xFAD mice by scRNA-seq. Dap12 KΔY75 : 5xFAD microglia evinced a phenotype mirroring that of microglia in Syk iΔMG : 5xFAD mice—i.e., preserved cycling microglia and accumulation of Apoe + TM1 population ( Figures 6 A and 6B). Biochemical analysis of bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Dap12 KΔY75 , Trem2 −/− , and Syk cΔMG mice showed that lack of either TREM2 or DAP12, but not SYK, impacted ERK activation ( Figure 6 C), corroborating that the microglia phenotype induced by SYK deficiency is independent of any signal dependent on the TREM2-DAP12 axis.
In addition to DAP12, TREM2 associates with the transmembrane adapter DAP10 ( Hcst ) in BMDM ( Peng et al., 2010 39. Peng, Q. ∙ Malhotra, S. ∙ Torchia, J.A. ... TREM2- and DAP12-dependent activation of PI3K requires DAP10 and is inhibited by SHIP1 Sci. Signal. 2010; 3 :ra38 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). DAP10 is similar to DAP12 but lacks a canonical cytoplasmic ITAM. In fact, it contains a cytoplasmic Y-x-N-M motif that directly recruits PI3K and the adapter GRB2 ( Lanier, 2009 25. Lanier, L.L. DAP10- and DAP12-associated receptors in innate immunity Immunol. Rev. 2009; 227 :150-160 Crossref Scopus (226) PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, we asked whether TREM2-dependent SYK-independent microglia activation requires DAP10. We cultured microglia from Dap10 −/− and wild-type neonatal mice pulsed with BrdU and showed that lack of DAP10 impaired microglia proliferation ( Figures 6 D and 6E). Biochemical analysis of microglia cultures from Dap10 −/− , Trem2 −/− , Syk cΔMG , and Syk fl/fl mice showed that DAP10 deficiency affected phosphorylation of AKT and its target GSK-3β ( Figure 6 F). Additionally, Dap10 −/− BMDM were more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic effect of the SYK inhibitor BAY61-3606 than wild-type BMDM. The survival defect was completely reversed by a pharmacological inhibitor of GSK-3β, promoting cell survival and proliferation ( Eldar-Finkelman, 2002 10. Eldar-Finkelman, H. Glycogen synthase kinase 3: an emerging therapeutic target Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8 :126-132 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (401) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 6 G and 6H). Additionally, Dap10 −/− BMDM cultured with Aβ oligomers appeared less phagocytic than wild-type BMDM, while SYK inhibition reduced phagocytic capacity in both groups ( Figures 6 I and 6J). Comparing Dap10 −/− , Trem2 −/− , Dap12 KΔY75 , Syk cΔMG , and Syk fl/fl BMDM, we confirmed that DAP10 deficiency curtailed phagocytosis, albeit to a lesser extent than did lack of either SYK, TREM2, or DAP12 signaling ( Figure 6 K). These data demonstrate that DAP10 signaling sustains microglia proliferation, metabolic activation, survival and Aβ phagocytosis independently of SYK, while both pathways are required for full microglia activation.
We previously described a reduced microglia response to Aβ pathology in 5xFAD mice carrying the human TREM2 R47H variant rather than the common variant ( TREM2 CV ) ( Song et al., 2018 46. Song, W.M. ∙ Joshita, S. ∙ Zhou, Y. ... Humanized TREM2 mice reveal microglia-intrinsic and -extrinsic effects of R47H polymorphism J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 :745-760 Crossref Scopus (166) PubMed Google Scholar ). Since the TREM2 R47H variant is unable bind ligands and activate SYK, we attempted to rescue SYK activation in this mouse model by engaging an alternative surface receptor that recruits SYK. We chose CLEC7A (DECTIN1), a member of the C-type lectin receptor family that is expressed in neutrophils, dendritic cells, alveolar and peritoneal macrophages ( Brown et al., 2002 4. Brown, G.D. ∙ Taylor, P.R. ∙ Reid, D.M. ... Dectin-1 is a major β-glucan receptor on macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196 :407-412 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is upregulated in microglia during neurodegeneration ( Herre et al., 2004 21. Herre, J. ∙ Marshall, A.S.J. ∙ Caron, E. ...

Dectin-1 activates Syk tyrosine kinase in a dynamic subset of macrophages for reactive oxygen production Blood. 2005; 106 :2543-2550 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). The CLEC7A cytoplasmic domain contains a hemi-ITAM domain that directly recruits and activates SYK upon dimerization ( Herre et al., 2004 21. Herre, J. ∙ Marshall, A.S.J. ∙ Caron, E. ...

Dectin-1 activates Syk tyrosine kinase in a dynamic subset of macrophages for reactive oxygen production Blood. 2005; 106 :2543-2550 Crossref Scopus (431) PubMed Google Scholar ). To engage CLEC7A in microglia during Aβ pathology, we initially evaluated a recombinant Fc-mutated variant of the anti-CLEC7A monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 ( Brown et al., 2002 4. Brown, G.D. ∙ Taylor, P.R. ∙ Reid, D.M. ... Dectin-1 is a major β-glucan receptor on macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196 :407-412 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ): mAb 2A11 specifically stained microglia cultured from neonatal mice ( Figure 7 A); moreover, 2A11 mAb-mediated cross-linking of CLEC7A in cultured microglia induced phosphorylation of SYK and S6K ( Figure 7 B), indicating that this mAb activates CLEC7A in microglia. To test whether CLEC7A engagement can enhance Aβ phagocytosis, TREM2 R47H - 5xFAD mice were injected i.p. with a single dose of 2A11 mAb or isotype control. 24 h after treatment, mice were injected with methoxy-X04 and microglia were analyzed by flow cytometry. More methoxy-X04 + microglia were found in the 2A11 mAb- than in the control mAb-treated group, indicating increased Aβ uptake ( Figures 7 C and 7D). We next mimicked short-term treatment by injecting TREM2 R47H - 5xFAD mice i.p. with mAb 2A11 or isotype control for 10 days. 24 h after the final injection, mice were analyzed by imaging ( Figure 7 E). Mice receiving the 2A11 mAb exhibited a significant increase of Iba1 ( Figures 7 F and 7G) and CD11c staining ( Figures 7 H and 7I), indicating more robust microglia activation. Increased expression of Itgax (encoding CD11c) was validated by RT-PCR in brain lysates ( Figure 7 J). Although short-term treatment did not affect the overall Aβ 1–42 load in cortex and hippocampus ( Figures S7 A and S7B), 2A11-mAb-treated mice had fewer filamentous plaques and more dynamic and inert plaques than did control mice ( Figures S7 C and S7D). Thus, CLEC7A engagement in microglia with hypofunctional TREM2 can, at least, partially rescue microglial responses to Aβ ( Figure 7 K). Lastly, we mined published snRNA-seq data of human AD and age matched controls for expression of SYK and CLEC7A mRNA using TREM2 for comparison ( Zhou et al., 2020 74. Zhou, Y. ∙ Song, W.M. ∙ Andhey, P.S. ... Human and mouse single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal TREM2-dependent and TREM2-independent cellular responses in Alzheimer’s disease Nat. Med. 2020; 26 :131-142 Crossref Scopus (549) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that SYK and CLEC7A are highly expressed in human microglia from both AD and control subjects ( Figure 7 L). Thus, the CLEC7A-SYK pathway in microglia might be a potential therapeutic target for AD.

Section: Discussion

This study demonstrates that SYK signaling is a central node in microglia responses to Aβ pathology. Conditional deletion of SYK in microglia prior to or after disease onset dramatically impaired the ability of microglia to encase Aβ plaques, resulting in augmented Aβ deposition, increased neuronal damage, and worsened behavioral deficits, suggesting that SYK is required for generation and maintenance of microglia responses to Aβ. Mechanistically, SYK deficiency impaired the activation of the PI3K-AKT-GSK-3β-mTOR axis. In parallel, SYK-deficient microglia escalated autophagy, which may provide an alternative energetic pathway. Using scRNA-seq, we resolved intermediate and terminal stages of the microglial response to Aβ, showing that SYK-deficient microglia fail to acquire DAM profiles. SYK function in the microglial response to Aβ strikingly mimics that of Drosophila Shark, an analogous non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is recruited to the phagocytic receptor Draper through an ITAM and is required for phagocytosis of neuronal cell corpses by glia ( Ziegenfuss et al., 2008 75. Ziegenfuss, J.S. ∙ Biswas, R. ∙ Avery, M.A. ... Draper-dependent glial phagocytic activity is mediated by Src and Syk family kinase signalling Nature. 2008; 453 :935-939 Crossref Scopus (157) PubMed Google Scholar ). This similarity epitomizes a highly conserved mechanism to clear protein aggregates and cellular debris.
We revealed a notable discrepancy between TREM2-deficient and SYK-deficient microglia at the transcriptomic level. While both SYK and TREM2 deficiencies did impede the generation of DAM, SYK deficiency led to the expansion of a microglia cluster with an intermediate phenotype prodromal to DAM. This suggests that TREM2 activates microglia through a SYK-dependent and a yet unexplored SYK-independent pathway. We provided evidence that TREM2 can sustain SYK-independent microglia activation through DAP10, which directly recruits PI3K ( Peng et al., 2010 39. Peng, Q. ∙ Malhotra, S. ∙ Torchia, J.A. ... TREM2- and DAP12-dependent activation of PI3K requires DAP10 and is inhibited by SHIP1 Sci. Signal. 2010; 3 :ra38 Crossref Scopus (266) PubMed Google Scholar ). Accordingly, DAP10 deficiency affected phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3β and moderated microglia proliferation, survival, and phagocytosis.
Lastly, we demonstrated that systemic administration of an agonistic anti-CLEC7A antibody to 5xFAD mice carrying the hypofunctional TREM2 R47H variant promotes SYK signaling and improves microglia activation. Since both CLEC7A and SYK are expressed in human microglia, CLEC7A emerges as a potential therapeutic target to boost microglia activation in AD. Thus, therapeutic activation of microglia in AD may be achieved by using agonists for the broad range of receptors that signal through SYK.
Our study of SYK-deficient microglia is limited to a prototypic mouse model of Aβ accumulation. While we showed for the first time an impact of SYK and DAP10 signaling on microglia responses to amyloid pathology, how these pathways orchestrate microglia functions remains unclear. Finally, it will be important to determine therapeutic and side effects of the anti-CLEC7A mAb dosing regimens.

Mice were of mixed sexes. Mice within experiments were age and sex matched. Syk fl/fl - and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice were generated by crossing the Syk fl/fl -Cx3cr1 CreERT2/+ mice with Syk fl/fl -5xFAD . Syk fl/fl mice were also crossed with Cx3cr1 Cre mice to ensure constitutive Syk deletion, named Syk cΔMG in contrast to TAM-inducible Syk fl/fl -Cx3cr1 CreERT2 mice referred to as Syk iΔMG mice, that were used for in vitro experiments. Trem2 –/– , Dap12 KΔY75 , Dap10 –/– and Trem2 R47H -5xFAD mice were previously described ( Gilfillan et al., 2002 13. Gilfillan, S. ∙ Ho, E.L. ∙ Cella, M. ...

TREM2 lipid sensing sustains the microglial response in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell. 2015; 160 :1061-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1145) PubMed Google Scholar ). For generation of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) 6-12 weeks old mice were used. Primary microglia for culture were isolated from pups at postnatal day 4. Mice used in this study were sacrificed at indicated time points. Mice were housed in the animal facilities of Washington University in St. Louis. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with Institutional regulations, under authorized protocols # 19-0981 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Primary microglia cultures of high purity were generated as previously described ( Wang et al., 2015 61. Wang, Y. ∙ Cella, M. ∙ Mallinson, K. ... TREM2 lipid sensing sustains the microglial response in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell. 2015; 160 :1061-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1145) PubMed Google Scholar ) for Aβ phagocytosis assay, immunoblotting, BrdU proliferation assay and antibody binding assay. In brief, the neonatal mouse brain at P4 was dissected and dissociated by Trypsin (1.67 mg/mL) with Dnase (0.33 mg/mL). The mixed glial culture was resuspended in the complete DMEM medium (supplemented with 1 × GlutaMAX™ supplement, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and seeded on PLL-coated T25 flask. From day 5, floating cells (primary microglia) were collected and seeded in 24-well plates at the density of 2 × 10 5 cells per well in the complete DMEM medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 10% of L-929 cell conditioned medium (LCCM) for further experiments.
To prepare BMDM for immunoblotting, survival and Aβ phagocytosis assays, bone marrow was collected from femurs and tibias and cells were plated at 5 × 10 6 cells/100-mm Petri dish in complete RPMI medium (supplemented with 1 × GlutaMAX™ supplement, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 10% LCCM. Cells were cultured for 5 days before use.
For generation of Syk fl/fl - and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice, 1- or 4-month-old littermates were fed a tamoxifen (TAM) diet for 4 weeks followed by replacement with regular chow. Treated mice were sacrificed at 6-, 9- or 5-, 9-months of age as indicated in the RESULTS. To determine fibrillar Aβ phagocytosis by microglia in vivo, 6-month-old Syk fl/fl - and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice were intraperitoneally injected with methoxy-X04 (Tocris) at 10 mg/kg in a PBS/DMSO mixture. Mice were sacrificed after 3 hours of injection and brains were made into single-cell suspension. For the short term of anti-CLEC7A antibody treatment, 8-month-old Trem2 R47H -5xFAD mice received intraperitoneal injection of anti-CLEC7A antibody (2A11), or anti-human ILT1 antibody (Fc mutated, clone 135.5) ( Molgora et al., 2020 34. Molgora, M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Vermi, W. ... TREM2 modulation remodels the tumor myeloid landscape enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Cell. 2020; 182 :886-900.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a control, for 4 times within 10 days. Mice were sacrificed within 24 hours after the last injection for assessment. For testing the in vivo effect of 2A11 treatment on fibrillar Aβ phagocytosis by microglia Trem2 R47H -5xFAD mice were first injected ip. with a single dose of 2A11 followed by ip. injection of methoxy-X04 after 24 hours.
Cells were incubated with Fc block prior to staining. The following antibodies were used in the study: CD45-PE or -APCCy7 (clone 30-F11), CD11b-APC (clone M1/70), Ly6C-APCCy7 (clone HK1.4), Ly6G-FITC (clone 1A8); P2RY12-BV421 (clone S16001E), Syk-PE (clone 5F5), BrdU-PE (Bu20a). Cells, stained with indicated antibodies for 30 min on ice, were acquired (LSR FORTESSA, Canto II, Calibur 3, BD Bioscience) and analyzed using FlowJo software. Cellular mitochondrial mass was assessed by using MitoTracker Green. For antibody binding assay, cells were stained with anti-CLEC7A (2A11) for 30 min on ice followed by a secondary anti-mouse IgG2a-PE staining for 30 min at 4°C. Cells stained by anti-mouse IgG2a-PE only were used as a control. Cell viability was determined by Aqua LIVE/Dead-405 nm staining (Invitrogen) or DAPI, and negative cells were considered viable. Propidium iodide (PI) was used for survival assay. Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience) was used for intracellular staining.
Cells from brain were isolated from the indicated animals as previously described ( Wang et al., 2015 61. Wang, Y. ∙ Cella, M. ∙ Mallinson, K. ... TREM2 lipid sensing sustains the microglial response in an Alzheimer’s disease model Cell. 2015; 160 :1061-1071 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1145) PubMed Google Scholar ). CD45 lo CD11b + microglia or CD45 + cells in the brain were fluorescence-activated cell-sorted (FACS Aria II, BD Bioscience) directly into 2%FBS in PBS for TEM or immunoblot lysates or 0.04% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for single-cell RNAseq.
Sorted microglia, cultured primary microglia, or BMDM were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) for 20-30 min on ice. Cell extract was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 15 min and supernatant was collected and subjected to protein estimation. Equal amount of protein from each sample mixed in 4 × Laemmli sample buffer was loaded on 4-20% mini protein TGX gels from Bio-Rad and run using Tris-Glycine-SDS buffer. Resolved proteins were transferred on PVDF membranes. Membranes were washed using TBST (Tris-buffered-saline with 0.1% tween 20), blocked using 5% BSA or non-fat dried milk and incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The following primary antibodies were used in the study: anti-phospho Syk (1:500, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Syk (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho Akt 473 (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Akt (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho NDRG1 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-NDRG1 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho GSK3-β (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GSK3-β (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho ERK (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ERK (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho S6K (1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-S6K (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell signaling Technology), anti-LC3 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-beta-actin-HRP (1:4,000, mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation in primary antibody, membranes were washed and incubated in HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature (RT), washed again and developed using SuperSignal West Pico Plus Chemiluminescent substrate inside Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system. Quantification of immunoblotting was performed by ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).
Sorted microglia were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/2.5% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella Inc.) in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.2 for 1 hour at RT. Following washes with sodium cacodylate buffer, cells were embedded in 2.5% agarose and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (Ted Pella Inc.) for 1 hour. After three washes in dH 2 O, samples were en bloc stained in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 hour. Samples were washed with dH 2 O, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and infiltrated with Eponate 12 resin (Ted Pella Inc.). Ultrathin sections (95 nm) were cut with a diamond knife using a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems Inc.) and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Samples were analyzed and imaged on a JEOL 1200 EX II transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc.) equipped with an AMT 8-megapixel digital camera and AMT Image Capture Engine V602 software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). Quantitative evaluation was performed by taking random images of 30 cells of comparable size and sectioned through the nucleus (indicating center of cell) and measuring the cross-sectional area using ImageJ. Data was expressed as the total number of a multivesicular/multilamellar structures or lipid droplets per cross-sectional area of cytosol.
Confocal microscopy analysis was performed as previously described ( Wang et al., 2020 60. Wang, S. ∙ Mustafa, M. ∙ Yuede, C.M. ... Anti-human TREM2 induces microglia proliferation and reduces pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease model J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200785 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, after transcardial perfusion with ice-cold PBS containing 1 U/ml of heparin, brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by incubating in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C before embedding in a 2:1 mixture of 30% sucrose and optimal cutting temperature compound. 40-μm serial coronal sections were cut on a cryo-sliding microtome. Sections were blocked with PBS+5% BSA and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X 100 in blocking solution. Primary antibodies were added at indicated combinations overnight at a dilution of 1:1,000 (rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology) or 1:500 (goat polyclonal, Abcam) for Iba1, 1:1,000 for CD68 (rat monoclonal, BioLegend), 1:100 for Pu.1 (rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:500 for Aβ 1-42 (rabbit recombinant monoclonal, Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 1:1,000 for Aβ 1-16 (6E10, BioLegend), 1:1,000 for Lamp1 (rat monoclonal, BioLegend), 1:100 for APP (22C11 mouse mAb, Millipore), 1:50 for LC3-Alexa Fluor® 488 (rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:100 for CD11c (rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:300 for CD74-Alexa Fluor® 647 (rat monoclonal, BioLegend), 1:100 for Ki67 (rabbit polyclonal, Abcam), 1:300 for ApoE (biotinylated HJ6.3, ( Xiong et al., 2021 67. Xiong, M. ∙ Jiang, H. ∙ Serrano, J.R. ... APOE immunotherapy reduces cerebral amyloid angiopathy and amyloid plaques while improving cerebrovascular function Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13 :1-13 Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar ), 1:50 for Trem2 (polyclonal sheep, R&D Systems), 1:100 for Tmem119 (rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology), 1:50 for Clec7a (rat monoclonal, InvivoGene). Secondary antibodies were added as follows: anti-goat IgG Alexa-Fluor®488 1:1,000 (donkey polyclonal, Abcam), anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 555 1:1,000 (donkey polyclonal, Abcam), anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor® 647 1:1,000 (donkey polyclonal, Abcam), anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 647 1:1,000 (goat recombinant polyclonal, Invitrogen), anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor®647 1:1,000 (chicken polyclonal, Invitrogen), Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor® 647 1:500 (BioLegend), anti-sheep IgG Alexa Fluor®555 1:1,000 (donkey polyclonal, Abcam) for 1.5 hours at RT. TO-PRO-3 iodide (300 nM; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to counterstain for nuclei, and Aβ plaques were labeled with methoxy-X04 (3 μg/ml; Tocris). The respective areas were captured using a conventional fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope) or confocal microscopes (Nikon A1Rsi+ or Zeiss LSM880 airyscan), or a Zeiss Axio Scan 7 Brightfield / Fluorescence Slide Scanner. Images were then processed with Imaris 7.7 (Bitplane).
The density of microglial clustering around Aβ plaques within z stacks was determined by using the Spots and Surface function of Imaris followed by running an automated scripts in MATLAB as described before ( Ulland et al., 2017 56. Ulland, T.K. ∙ Song, W.M. ∙ Huang, S.C.C. ... TREM2 maintains microglial metabolic fitness in Alzheimer’s disease Cell. 2017; 170 :649-663.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (718) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the Spots function was used to identify microglia within the Iba1 and TO-PRO-3 colocalized channel and the volume as well as location of Aβ plaques was reported by Surface function on methoxy-X04 image data. The density of microglia within 15-μm of plaque surfaces was estimated in MATLAB mathematically. The volumes of dystrophic neurites around plaques were calculated by a similar approach in which the Surfaces function was used to identify the volumes and location of methoxy-X04 as well as Lamp1 or APP positive signals within z stacks. Microglial coverage around Aβ plaques was calculated as the total Iba1 + methoxy-X04 + volume divided by the total methoxy-X04 + volume. Iba-1 intensity profile was generated by Surface function and the number of microglia was determined by the Spots function of Imaris on Pu.1 image data. Three-dimensional reconstruction of methoxy-X04 and CD68 positive signals was performed by Surfaces function for visualization of Aβ engulfed by microglial CD68 + phagosome on the images.
The measurement of total methoxy-X04 and Aβ 1-42 area coverage was performed as described before ( Wang et al., 2020 60. Wang, S. ∙ Mustafa, M. ∙ Yuede, C.M. ... Anti-human TREM2 induces microglia proliferation and reduces pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease model J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200785 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cortex and hippocampus regions or a similar regions encompassing portions of cortex were drawn in ImageJ from individual image and a threshold in which a fixed intensity was much greater than the mean for the selected region was used for calculating the percentage of area coverage automatically by batch processing in ImageJ. Two or three brain sections per mouse were used for quantification. The plaque load for each mouse was shown as the average of two or three sections. Quantification of Iba1, Tmem119, or Clec7a coverage in the cortex was performed by a similar procedure, with different threshold settings. The conformation of individual plaque in each condition was determined as described before ( Wang et al., 2020 60. Wang, S. ∙ Mustafa, M. ∙ Yuede, C.M. ... Anti-human TREM2 induces microglia proliferation and reduces pathology in an Alzheimer’s disease model J. Exp. Med. 2020; 217 :e20200785 Crossref Scopus (233) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, we evaluated: 1) “inert plaques” made of fibrillar Aβ mostly stained by methoxy-X04; 2) “dynamic plaques” exhibiting a core of methoxy-X04+ fibrillar Aβ surrounded by a halo of 6E10+ non-fibrillar Aβ; 3) “filamentous plaques” with little content of β-sheet structure and branched amyloid fibrils mainly stained with the 6E10 antibody. The proportion of distinct plaque morphology was calculated by normalizing the total number of plaques from each z -stack image.
For measurement of CD11c + pixels within Iba1 + pixels, the Spots function on z -stack image data was used to conduct the Iba1 + channel. The thresholds for CD11c + within Iba1 + pixels were determined by visual inspection and used for all images. For each z -stack image, the percentages of CD11c + pixels within Iba1 + pixels were calculated. A similar procedure was used for measurement of percentage of LC3 + or CD74 + microglia over total microglia population. The mean intensity of the TREM2 channel within Iba1 + pixels was exported to Microsoft Excel. A threshold of mean TREM2 intensity was set and simply averaged to obtain the final mean intensity. Sholl analysis of non-plaque associated microglia was perform by ImageJ. Five individuals Tmem119 + Iba1 + non-plaque associated microglia in each brain image were analyzed and data from individual cell was averaged to determine the number of intersections in each brain section. Two brain sections from each mouse were calculated and the final results were shown as the average of the number of intersections in each mouse of two genotypes.
Human Aβ 1-42 peptides were aggregated and labeled by pHrodo Red and diluted to a final concentration of 100 μM. 5 × 10 4 cultured primary microglia or BMDM were seeded overnight into a 96-well plate before adding pHrodo Red labeled Aβ 1-42 oligomers. Uptake of Aβ 1-42 aggregates was then captured in a period of 1 or 2 hours by FACS after removing Aβ 1-42 oligomers from culture media.
Cultured primary microglia were carefully washed of growth factors and re-plated in a non-tissue culture-treated 96-well plate at 1× 10 5 cells per well. After 48 hours cells were pulsed with 10 μM BrdU for additional 48 hours. Cells were detached with 1mM EDTA and BrdU incorporation measured as instructed by the manufacturer (BD Pharmingen BrdU Flow Kit).
To assess cell survival, WT or Dap10 –/– BMDM were seeded into 96-well plate at 5 × 10 4 /well and cultured with following conditions: 1) 10% LLCM; 2) 0% LLCM; 3) 0% LLCM with 1 μM BAY61-3606 (Syk inhibitor); 4) 0% LLCM with 1 μM BAY61-3606 (Syk inhibitor) and 10 μM SB216763 (GSK-3β inhibitor) 5) 0% LLCM with 10 μM SB216763 (GSK-3β inhibitor) for 48 hours. Frequencies of viable cells were determined by FACS with PI staining.
All behavioral testing was conducted during the light cycle, by a female experimenter blinded to experimental group. Equipment was cleaned with 2% chlorhexidine diacetate between animals. The order of tests conducted for each cohort were as follows: 1 hour locomotor activity, elevated plus maze, visible platform trials of the water maze, submerged platform trials, and water maze probe trial.
To evaluate general activity levels mice were evaluated over a 1-hour period in transparent (47.6 × 25.4 × 20.6 cm high) polystyrene enclosures. Each cage was surrounded by a frame containing a 4 × 8 matrix of photocell pairs, the output of which was fed to an on-line computer (Hamilton-Kinder). The system software (Hamilton-Kinder) was used to define a 33 × 11 cm central zone and a peripheral or surrounding zone that was 5.5 cm wide with the sides of the cage being the outermost boundary. This peripheral area extended along the entire perimeter of the cage. Variables that were analyzed included the total number of ambulations and rearing on hindlimbs, as well as the number of entries, the time spent, and the distance traveled in the center area as well as the distance traveled in the periphery surrounding the center.
EPM was conducted as previously described ( Wozniak et al., 2013 64. Wozniak, D.F. ∙ Diggs-Andrews, K.A. ∙ Conyers, S. ... Motivational disturbances and effects of L-dopa administration in Neurofibromatosis-1 model mice PLoS One. 2013; 8 :e66024 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, a 5 min trial was conducted in a dimly lit room using a standard mouse elevated plus maze from Kinder Scientific (Poway). The maze consisted of a black acrylic surface measuring 5x5 cm and elevated 63 cm above the floor equipped with photo beam pairs. Four arms (35 cm long, 5 cm wide; two open and two with 15 cm high walls) extended from a central area. The MotorMonitor software (Kinder Scientific) quantified beam breaks as duration, distance traveled, entries, and time at rest in each zone (closed arms, open arms and center area).
MWM was conducted as previously described ( Wozniak et al., 2004 65. Wozniak, D.F. ∙ Hartman, R.E. ∙ Boyle, M.P. ... Apoptotic neurodegeneration induced by ethanol in neonatal mice is associated with profound learning/memory deficits in juveniles followed by progressive functional recovery in adults Neurobiol. Dis. 2004; 17 :403-414 Crossref Scopus (263) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, cued (visible platform), place (submerged platform), and probe trials were conducted in a galvanized steel pool, measuring 120 cm in diameter, and filled with opaque water (diluted nontoxic white tempera paint). The PVC escape platform measured 11.5 cm in diameter. A digital video camera connected to a PC computer and the computer software program ANY-maze (Stoelting Co) tracked the swimming pathway of the mouse to the escape platform and quantified path length, latency to find escape platform, and swimming speeds.
On two consecutive days, animals received four cued trials, separated by 1 hour, during which a red tennis ball atop a rod was attached to the escape platform and served as a visual cue. To prevent spatial learning, the escape platform was moved to a different quadrant location for each trial. The mouse was released from the quadrant opposite to the platform location and allowed 60 s to locate the platform. Once the mouse found the platform, it was allowed to remain there for 10 s before being returned to its home cage. Three days following visible platform testing, the cue was removed from the platform, and it was submerged 1 cm under the water for the hidden platform tests. Animals received two blocks of two consecutive trials on five consecutive days, with an inter-trial interval between 30-90 s and approximately 2 hour separating trial blocks. The escape platform remained in the same quadrant location for all trials and distal cues were placed on the walls of the room to support spatial learning. The mouse was released from a different location for each trial on each day. The mouse was allowed 60 s to find the escape platform and allowed to sit on it for 10 s before being returned to its home cage. Visible and submerged platform trials were combined into blocks of two or four trials for analyses, respectively. Following completion of submerged platform trials on the 5 th day of training, the escape platform was removed from the pool and one 60 s probe trial was conducted to assess memory retention for the location of the platform.
6-month-old of Syk fl/fl , Syk iΔMG , Syk fl/fl -5xFAD and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD , as well as Trem2 +/+ -5xFAD , Trem2 – / – -5xFAD and DAP12 KΔY75 -5xFAD male mice were sacrificed for the sample preparation. After perfusion with cold PBS, cortices were dissociated, and CD45 + cells were sorted using FACS. All CD45 + cell libraries were prepared using the 10× Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3′ v3 Gene Expression Kit and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq.
Anti-mouse CLEC7A monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2A11 was previously reported ( Brown et al., 2002 4. Brown, G.D. ∙ Taylor, P.R. ∙ Reid, D.M. ... Dectin-1 is a major β-glucan receptor on macrophages J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196 :407-412 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). A DNA fragment encoding heavy chain variable (VH) and CH1 regions was cloned into the pFUSEmIgG2A-Fc1 vector with L234A, L235A, P329G (LALA-PG) mutation, which blocks Fc binding. A DNA fragment encoding the light chain was cloned into Fc-null pFUSE-mIgG2A-Fc1 vector as previously described ( Molgora et al., 2020 34. Molgora, M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Vermi, W. ... TREM2 modulation remodels the tumor myeloid landscape enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Cell. 2020; 182 :886-900.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ). The heavy chain and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for expression at mass ratio 1:2. When cell viability was below 50% (5-7 days), the supernatant was collected and filtered with 0.22-μm filters. The antibody was purified with protein A agarose (GoldBio). Final preps were concentrated to about 10 mg/mL into PBS and stored in 80°C for future use.
Before stimulation, primary microglia were starved for 3 hours in 1% serum RPMI. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with 10 μg/ml of anti-CLEC7A or anti-human ILT1 antibody (Fc mutated, clone 135.5) ( Molgora et al., 2020 34. Molgora, M. ∙ Esaulova, E. ∙ Vermi, W. ... TREM2 modulation remodels the tumor myeloid landscape enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Cell. 2020; 182 :886-900.e17 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (303) PubMed Google Scholar ) as a control. Cells were then washed 3 times with cold PBS at 4°C and incubated at 37°C for 5 min in the presence of purified goat F(ab')2 anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (15 μg/ml, polyclonal, SouthernBiotech). After stimulation, cells were washed 3 times once again with cold PBS at 4°C and lysed with lysis buffer for the immunoblotting.
Total RNA was extracted from cortices of the left-brain hemispheres using miRNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). After cDNA synthesis using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and LightCycler 96 detection system (Roche). The reference gene was actin and relative gene expression levels were determined by the ΔΔCt method. Gene expression was considered undetectable if Ct values were >35 cycles.
All graphs represent the mean of all samples in each group ± SEM as indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. P < 0.05 was considered significant difference between different conditions, determined by a two-tailed unpaired t test, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons test as indicated in the figure legends. P-values in violin plots shown in the Figure 7 L were calculated using stat_compare_means() function of ggpubr package (0.4.0) in R, using Wilcox rank-sum test. Quantification of fluorescence microscopy, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy images were performed using Imaris, ImageJ and MATLAB.
Cell Ranger Software Suite (v6.0.0) from 10xGenomics was used for sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell counting. Cellranger count was used to align samples to the reference genome GRCm39, quantify reads, and filter reads and barcodes. Only protein-coding genes, with the exception of Clec7a , were retained in the analysis. The Seurat (v4.0) package in R (v4.1.0) was used for downstream analysis ( Hao et al., 2021 20. Hao, Y. ∙ Hao, S. ∙ Andersen-Nissen, E. ... Integrated analysis of multimodal single-cell data Cell. 2021; 184 :3573-3587.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (4942) PubMed Google Scholar ). For quality control, cells with mitochondrial content more than 7.5% were removed. Cells with low UMI and gene number per cell were filtered out. Cutoffs for UMI and gene number were empirically determined on the basis of histograms showing cell density as a function of UMI per gene counts. Cutoffs of UMI greater than 2000 and less than 20000, and genes greater than 1000 were applied. Genes expressed in fewer than 10 cells were removed from the dataset. Microglia clusters were digitally isolated and further filtered for clusters containing doublets, stress genes, and apoptotic cells. After filtering, the dataset from Syk fl/fl , Syk iΔMG , Syk fl/fl -5xFAD and Syk iΔMG -5xFAD mice (n = 3 for each genotype) showed in Figures 4 and S5 (refer to as SYK ONLY) contained a total of 57,830 microglia cells with a median 5871 UMI and median 2537 genes and the integration dataset from Syk fl/fl -, Syk iΔMG -, Trem2 +/+ - (n = 2) and Trem2 – / – -5xFAD mice (n = 3) showed in Figure 5 (refer to as SYK-TREM2) contained a total of 38,404 microglia cells remained with a median 5483 UMI and median 2359 genes per cell. For 5xFAD (n = 3), DAP12 KΔY75 -5xFAD (n = 4) dataset, cells with mitochondrial content of more than 10% were removed. Cutoffs of UMI greater than 500 and less than 100,000, and genes greater than 500 and less than 10,000 were applied. Genes expressed in fewer than 10 cells were removed from the dataset. After quality control, 26,921 microglia cells with a median 6,369 UMI and median 2,663 genes were analyzed (refer to as DAP12 ONLY). Then microglia from the DAP12 ONLY dataset were reference mapped to the UMAP of integration SYK-TREM2 dataset using FindTransferAnchors () and MapQuery () functions in the Seurat package and the UMAP was shown in Figure 6 A.
For both SYK ONLY and SYK-TREM2 datasets, data were normalized using the SCTransform method regressed on mitochondrial gene percentage and integrated using FindIntegrationAnchors function and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) ( Hafemeister and Satija, 2019 18. Hafemeister, C. ∙ Satija, R. Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression 2019 10.1101/576827 Crossref Scopus (1785) Google Scholar ; Stuart et al., 2019 49. Stuart, T. ∙ Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ... Comprehensive integration of single-cell data Cell. 2019; 177 :1888-1902.e21 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (7310) PubMed Google Scholar ). Principle component analysis was performed, and the top 30 principal components were selected for dimensionality reduction using the Uniform Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm. Clustering was performed using the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions using a resolution of 0.6 (SYK ONLY) or 0.4 (SYK-TREM2). Marker genes were identified by comparing each cluster against all other clusters using the FindAllMarkers function with default settings (log-fold change threshold of 0.25 and >10% cells expressing the gene). Cell clusters from each tissue were annotated based on marker gene expression. For data visualization and figure preparation, the scRNA-seq data was also analyzed with BBrowser version 2.7.5 (SingleCell). Differential gene expression testing was performed using the mixed model method “dream” from the muscat package ( Crowell et al., 2020 9. Crowell, H.L. ∙ Soneson, C. ∙ Germain, P.L. ... Muscat detects subpopulation-specific state transitions From multi-sample multi-condition single-cell transcriptomics data Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :6077 Crossref Scopus (155) PubMed Google Scholar ). Genes detected in fewer than 10 cells or with total count less than 10 were excluded from analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed with GSEA ( Mootha et al., 2003 35. Mootha, V.K. ∙ Lindgren, C.M. ∙ Eriksson, K.F. ... PGC-1α-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation are coordinately downregulated in human diabetes Nat. Genet. 2003; 34 :267-273 Crossref Scopus (7207) PubMed Google Scholar ; Subramanian et al., 2005 50. Subramanian, A. ∙ Tamayo, P. ∙ Mootha, V.K. ... Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102 :15545-15550 Crossref Scopus (33572) PubMed Google Scholar ). Fold changes were calculated by comparing Syk iΔMG -5xFAD vs. Syk fl/fl -5xFAD on cells aggregated from TM1, TM2, and DAM clusters using FindMarkers with the MAST method and a nominal FDR threshold (q < 0.05). Genes were then ranked by log 2 fold change and submitted for gene set enrichment analysis using GSEAPreranked and the hallmark gene sets from MSigDB.
Single-cell pseudotime trajectories were inferred using the R package slingshot (v2.1.0) ( Street et al., 2018 48. Street, K. ∙ Risso, D. ∙ Fletcher, R.B. ... Slingshot: cell lineage and pseudotime inference for single-cell transcriptomics BMC Genomics. 2018; 19 :477 Crossref Scopus (1200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Normalized values resulting from batch integration were used as input for the calculation of cell lineages and pseudotime. Genes that were significantly differentially expressed along pseudotime were identified using the R package tradeSeq (v1.6) ( Van den Berge et al., 2020 59. Van den Berge, K. ∙ Roux de Bézieux, H. ∙ Street, K. ... Trajectory-based differential expression analysis for single-cell sequencing data Nat. Commun. 2020; 11 :1201 Crossref Scopus (285) PubMed Google Scholar ). A negative binomial generalized additive model was fit to the identified lineages using the fitGAM function using the top 3000 variable features. Genes that changed significantly along the DAM trajectory were identified using associationTest . Microglia from Syk iΔMG -5xFAD were then compared against Trem2 – / – -5xFAD microglia along the DAM trajectory using the conditionTest function. DE genes (FDR < 0.05) were further filtered by selecting those which overlapped with those that changed significantly along the DAM trajectory.
