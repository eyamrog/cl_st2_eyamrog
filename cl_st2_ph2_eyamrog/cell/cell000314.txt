Title: Structural basis for IL-12 and IL-23 receptor sharing reveals a gateway for shaping actions on T versus NK cells


Abstract: Summary

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 are heterodimeric cytokines that are produced by antigen-presenting cells to regulate the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and they share IL-12Rβ1 as a receptor signaling subunit. We present a crystal structure of the quaternary IL-23 (IL-23p19/p40)/IL-23R/IL-12Rβ1 complex, together with cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of the complete IL-12 (IL-12p35/p40)/IL-12Rβ2/IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) complexes, which reveal “non-canonical” topologies where IL-12Rβ1 directly engages the common p40 subunit. We targeted the shared IL-12Rβ1/p40 interface to design a panel of IL-12 partial agonists that preserved interferon gamma (IFNγ) induction by CD8 + T cells but impaired cytokine production from natural killer (NK) cells in vitro . These cell-biased properties were recapitulated in vivo , where IL-12 partial agonists elicited anti-tumor immunity to MC-38 murine adenocarcinoma absent the NK-cell-mediated toxicity seen with wild-type IL-12. Thus, the structural mechanism of receptor sharing used by IL-12 family cytokines provides a protein interface blueprint for tuning this cytokine axis for therapeutics.

Section: Introduction

The use of shared signaling receptors is a pervasive mechanism used by cytokines to regulate pleiotropic, often redundant aspects of physiology through multimerization of cell surface receptors and induction of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway ( Murray, 2007 51. Murray, P.J. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway: input and output integration J. Immunol. 2007; 178 :2623-2629 Crossref Scopus (975) PubMed Google Scholar ). The principal shared receptor subunits gp130, common gamma (γ c ), common beta (β c ), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor beta (IL-10Rβ), among others, are shared among multiple cytokines ( Wang et al., 2009 77. Wang, X. ∙ Lupardus, P. ∙ Laporte, S.L. ... Structural biology of shared cytokine receptors Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 :29-60 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ). The IL-12 family cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 share the IL-12Rβ 1 subunit (IL-12Rβ1) and are produced by antigen-presenting cells in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( Vignali and Kuchroo, 2012 74. Vignali, D.A. ∙ Kuchroo, V.K. IL-12 family cytokines: immunological playmakers Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :722-728 Crossref Scopus (995) PubMed Google Scholar ).
IL-12 was the first heterodimeric cytokine identified and consists of a four-helix bundle α subunit, IL-12p35, and a β subunit, p40, with homology to type I cytokine receptors ( Kobayashi et al., 1989 33. Kobayashi, M. ∙ Fitz, L. ∙ Ryan, M. ... Identification and purification of natural killer cell stimulatory factor (NKSF), a cytokine with multiple biologic effects on human lymphocytes J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170 :827-845 Crossref Scopus (1989) PubMed Google Scholar ). IL-12 signals through a receptor complex of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and T cells ( Figure 1 A) ( Chua et al., 1994 17. Chua, A.O. ∙ Chizzonite, R. ∙ Desai, B.B. ... Expression cloning of a human IL-12 receptor component. A new member of the cytokine receptor superfamily with strong homology to gp130 J.

A functional interleukin 12 receptor complex is composed of two beta-type cytokine receptor subunits Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93 :14002-14007 Crossref Scopus (603) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dimerization of the IL-12 receptor induces activation of the receptor-associated JAK molecules JAK2 and Tyk2, which trans-phosphorylate one another as well as tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of IL-12Rβ2, which serve as docking sites for the SH2-containing STAT4 ( Yao et al., 1999 80. Yao, B.B. ∙ Niu, P. ∙ Surowy, C.S. ... Direct interaction of STAT4 with the IL-12 receptor Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368 :147-155 Crossref Scopus (32) PubMed Google Scholar ). Receptor-associated STAT4 proteins are then phosphorylated before translocating to the nucleus, where they promote the expression of interferon gamma (IFNγ) and the polarization of CD4 + T cells toward a T helper 1 (Th1) phenotype ( Trinchieri, 2003 71. Trinchieri, G. Interleukin-12 and the regulation of innate resistance and adaptive immunity Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3 :133-146 Crossref Scopus (3156) PubMed Google Scholar ). Given the similarities between immunity to intracellular pathogens and cancer, therapeutic approaches that stimulate Th1 responses, either indirectly through selection of vaccine adjuvants and epitopes or directly through administration of IL-12, have been explored in the context of cancer immunotherapy ( Berraondo et al., 2018 5. Berraondo, P. ∙ Etxeberria, I. ∙ Ponz-Sarvise, M. ... Revisiting interleukin-12 as a cancer immunotherapy agent Clin. Cancer Res. 2018; 24 :2716-2718 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ; Lasek et al., 2014 37. Lasek, W. ∙ Zagożdżon, R. ∙ Jakobisiak, M. Interleukin 12: still a promising candidate for tumor immunotherapy? Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2014; 63 :419-435 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In preclinical models, IL-12 administration has been shown to promote tumor clearance ( Ardolino et al., 2014 1. Ardolino, M. ∙ Azimi, C.S. ∙ Iannello, A. ...

Anchoring of intratumorally administered cytokines to collagen safely potentiates systemic cancer immunotherapy Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11 :eaaw2614 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ); however, translating these findings to human immunotherapy has been challenging due to toxicity associated with IL-12 administration ( Cohen, 1995 18. Cohen, J. IL-12 deaths: explanation and a puzzle Science. 1995; 270 :908 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonard et al., 1997 39. Leonard, J.P. ∙ Sherman, M.L. ∙ Fisher, G.L. ... Effects of single-dose interleukin-12 exposure on interleukin-12-associated toxicity and interferon-gamma production Blood. 1997; 90 :2541-2548 PubMed Google Scholar ). In mice, IL-12 toxicity is mediated by NK cells when co-administered with IL-2 ( Carson et al., 1999 12. Carson, W.E. ∙ Yu, H. ∙ Dierksheide, J. ... A fatal cytokine-induced systemic inflammatory response reveals a critical role for NK cells J. Immunol. 1999; 162 :4943-4951 PubMed Google Scholar ), IL-15 ( Biber et al., 2002 6. Biber, J.L. ∙ Jabbour, S. ∙ Parihar, R. ... Administration of two macrophage-derived interferon-gamma-inducing factors (IL-12 and IL-15) induces a lethal systemic inflammatory response in mice that is dependent on natural killer cells but does not require interferon-gamma Cell. Immunol. 2002; 216 :31-42 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ; Carson et al., 1999 12. Carson, W.E. ∙ Yu, H. ∙ Dierksheide, J. ... A fatal cytokine-induced systemic inflammatory response reveals a critical role for NK cells J. Immunol. 1999; 162 :4943-4951 PubMed Google Scholar ), or IL-18 ( Carson et al., 2000 13. Carson, W.E. ∙ Dierksheide, J.E. ∙ Jabbour, S. ... Coadministration of interleukin-18 and interleukin-12 induces a fatal inflammatory response in mice: critical role of natural killer cell interferon-gamma production and STAT-mediated signal transduction Blood. 2000; 96 :1465-1473 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that narrowing the pleotropic actions of IL-12 may be beneficial in reducing toxicity.
IL-12 shares its p40 subunit with another four-helix bundle, IL-23p19, to form the cytokine IL-23 ( Oppmann et al., 2000 54. Oppmann, B. ∙ Lesley, R. ∙ Blom, B. ... Novel p19 protein engages IL-12p40 to form a cytokine, IL-23, with biological activities similar as well as distinct from IL-12 Immunity. 2000; 13 :715-725 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2388) PubMed Google Scholar ). IL-23 signals through a receptor complex formed by IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23R ( Figure 1 A) ( Parham et al., 2002 55. Parham, C. ∙ Chirica, M. ∙ Timans, J. ... A receptor for the heterodimeric cytokine IL-23 is composed of IL-12Rβ1 and a novel cytokine receptor subunit, IL-23R J. Immunol. 2002; 168 :5699-5708 Crossref Scopus (1149) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a shared receptor for IL-12 and IL-23, IL-12Rβ1 is expressed on T cells, NK cells, and monocytes ( Uhlén et al., 2015 73. Uhlén, M. ∙ Fagerberg, L. ∙ Hallström, B.M. ... Proteomics. Tissue-based map of the human proteome Science. 2015; 347 :1260419 Crossref Scopus (9493) PubMed Google Scholar ), while IL-23R is found on γδ T cells ( Liang et al., 2013 41. Liang, D. ∙ Zuo, A. ∙ Shao, H. ... IL-23 receptor expression on γδ T cells correlates with their enhancing or suppressive effects on autoreactive T cells in experimental autoimmune uveitis J. Immunol. 2013; 191 :1118-1125 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ) and CD4 + T cells ( Yeste et al., 2014 82. Yeste, A. ∙ Mascanfroni, I.D. ∙ Nadeau, M. ... IL-21 induces IL-22 production in CD4+ T cells Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :3753 Crossref Scopus (124) PubMed Google Scholar ). Despite shared use of IL-12Rβ1, IL-12 and IL-23 have distinct phenotypic effects. In CD4 + T cells, IL-23 signaling promotes phosphorylation of STAT3 and stabilization of the IL-17-producing Th17 lineage ( Zhou et al., 2007 87. Zhou, L. ∙ Ivanov, I.I. ∙ Spolski, R. ... IL-6 programs T(H)-17 cell differentiation by promoting sequential engagement of the IL-21 and IL-23 pathways Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8 :967-974 Crossref Scopus (1789) PubMed Google Scholar ). While Th17 cells and IL-23 signaling play an important role in the immune response against extracellular pathogens, aberrant Th17 activity has been associated with multiple autoimmune conditions ( Littman and Rudensky, 2010 43. Littman, D.R. ∙ Rudensky, A.Y. Th17 and regulatory T cells in mediating and restraining inflammation Cell. 2010; 140 :845-858 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (884) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, genetic deficiency in IL-23p19 protects mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( Thakker et al., 2007 70. Thakker, P. ∙ Leach, M.W. ∙ Kuang, W. ... IL-23 is critical in the induction but not in the effector phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis J. Immunol. 2007; 178 :2589-2598 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ) and colitis ( Yen et al., 2006 81. Yen, D. ∙ Cheung, J. ∙ Scheerens, H. ... IL-23 is essential for T cell-mediated colitis and promotes inflammation via IL-17 and IL-6 J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116 :1310-1316 Crossref Scopus (1321) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinically, antagonist antibodies targeting IL-23 have been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis; however, many of these antibodies block both IL-12 and IL-23 signaling ( Chan et al., 2018 14. Chan, T.C. ∙ Hawkes, J.E. ∙ Krueger, J.G. Interleukin 23 in the skin: role in psoriasis pathogenesis and selective interleukin 23 blockade as treatment Ther. Adv. Chronic Dis. 2018; 9 :111-119 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kopp et al., 2015 34. Kopp, T. ∙ Riedl, E. ∙ Bangert, C. ... Clinical improvement in psoriasis with specific targeting of interleukin-23 Nature. 2015; 521 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ; Koutruba et al., 2010 35. Koutruba, N. ∙ Emer, J. ∙ Lebwohl, M. Review of ustekinumab, an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 inhibitor used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis Ther. Clin. Risk Manag. 2010; 6 :123-141 PubMed Google Scholar ). Thus, a deeper understanding of the basis of IL-12Rβ1 sharing could enable better separation of the divergent functions of IL-12 and IL-23.
Currently, it is unclear how these closely related cytokines engage their shared receptor subunits because the structure of a complete signaling complex containing IL-12Rβ1 has not been reported. A crystal structure of IL-23R bound to IL-23, absent IL-12Rβ1, showed the N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of IL-23R engages IL-23 in an extended conformation ( Bloch et al., 2018 7. Bloch, Y. ∙ Bouchareychas, L. ∙ Merceron, R. ... Structural activation of pro-inflammatory human cytokine IL-23 by cognate IL-23 receptor enables recruitment of the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 Immunity. 2018; 48 :45-58.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ), analogous to the “site 3” paradigm established by the interaction between IL-6 and gp130 ( Boulanger et al., 2003b 9. Boulanger, M.J. ∙ Chow, D.C. ∙ Brevnova, E.E. ... Hexameric structure and assembly of the interleukin-6/IL-6 alpha-receptor/gp130 complex Science. 2003; 300 :2101-2104 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chow et al., 2001 16. Chow, D. ∙ He, X. ∙ Snow, A.L. ... Structure of an extracellular gp130 cytokine receptor signaling complex Science. 2001; 291 :2150-2155 Crossref Scopus (241) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, blocking antibodies that bind the shared p40 subunit neutralize signaling of both IL-12 and IL-23 ( Benson et al., 2011 4. Benson, J.M. ∙ Sachs, C.W. ∙ Treacy, G. ... Therapeutic targeting of the IL-12/23 pathways: generation and characterization of ustekinumab Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :615-624 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the assembly of IL-12 and IL-23 receptor signaling complexes may be unique compared to the gp130 model ( Bloch et al., 2018 7. Bloch, Y. ∙ Bouchareychas, L. ∙ Merceron, R. ... Structural activation of pro-inflammatory human cytokine IL-23 by cognate IL-23 receptor enables recruitment of the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 Immunity. 2018; 48 :45-58.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we report a 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of IL-12Rβ1, a 3.4 Å resolution crystal structure of the IL-23 (IL-23p19/p40)/IL-23R/IL-12Rβ1 receptor complex, and cryo-EM structures of complete IL-12 and IL-23 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) complexes. Together, these structures reveal a modular mechanism of IL-12 and IL-23 receptor assembly that is unique within the cytokine superfamily. We targeted the “shared” IL-12Rβ1/p40 interaction site to design a series of IL-12 partial agonists that preferentially supported T cell activation with reduced activity on NK cells. IL-12 partial agonists exhibited similar cell-type biases in vivo and promoted anti-tumor responses in the MC-38 murine colorectal cancer model without inducing toxicity associated with wild-type IL-12 administration. Thus, the unique structure and mechanism of IL-12Rβ1 sharing provides a blueprint to engineer functionally selective agonists.

Section: Results

IL-23(IL-23p19/p40) signals through a receptor complex composed of IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 ( Figure 1 A). The ECD of IL-12Rβ1 consists of five fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains of which the N-terminal D1–D2 domains mediate binding to IL-23 ( Schröder et al., 2015 66. Schröder, J. ∙ Moll, J.M. ∙ Baran, P. ... Non-canonical interleukin 23 receptor complex assembly: p40 protein recruits interleukin 12 receptor β1 via site II and induces p19/interleukin 23 receptor interaction via site III J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 :359-370 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine the structural basis for IL-23 receptor assembly, we crystalized a complex of IL-12Rβ1 D1–D2 with IL-23 and the IL-23R ectodomain. The quaternary complex diffracted to 3.4 Å resolution ( Table S1 ), and we determined a structure of a partial complex by molecular replacement using the previously published IL-23R ternary (IL-23p19/p40/IL-23R) complex ( Bloch et al., 2018 7. Bloch, Y. ∙ Bouchareychas, L. ∙ Merceron, R. ... Structural activation of pro-inflammatory human cytokine IL-23 by cognate IL-23 receptor enables recruitment of the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 Immunity. 2018; 48 :45-58.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additional electron density for IL-12Rβ1 was observed, but there was no published IL-12Rβ1 structure to use as a search model, and we were not able to determine the complete structure by molecular replacement with alternative models. Thus, we determined the structure of the human IL-12Rβ1 D1-D2 domains to a resolution of 2.0 Å by multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) ( Figure 1 B; Table S1 ). We then used this structure as a search model and were able to place the IL12Rβ1 D1 domain in the electron density of the quaternary complex. The D2 domain was poorly ordered and did not exhibit interpretable electron density, likely due to interdomain flexibility and loose crystal packing ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 A, and S1B; Table S1 ).
The quaternary IL-23R complex exhibits a modular architecture in which IL-23 serves as a bridge connecting IL-23R with IL-12Rβ1 to initiate intracellular JAK2/Tyk2 trans-phosphorylation ( Figures 1 C–1G). The tip of IL-23p19 and the side of p40 collectively engage the N-terminal Ig domain of IL-23R in a classical site 3 interaction as previously observed ( Bloch et al., 2018 7. Bloch, Y. ∙ Bouchareychas, L. ∙ Merceron, R. ... Structural activation of pro-inflammatory human cytokine IL-23 by cognate IL-23 receptor enables recruitment of the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 Immunity. 2018; 48 :45-58.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 1 G). Similar to other IL-6 family cytokines, this interaction is anchored by an aromatic residue at the tip of IL-23p19 (Trp156), which packs against the inner beta sheet of IL-23R D1 Ig domain ( Boulanger et al., 2003b 9. Boulanger, M.J. ∙ Chow, D.C. ∙ Brevnova, E.E. ... Hexameric structure and assembly of the interleukin-6/IL-6 alpha-receptor/gp130 complex Science. 2003; 300 :2101-2104 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). Alignment of the two IL-23R-bound structures on IL-23p19 shows that IL-23R is rotated by 18° in our structure compared to the previously reported partial receptor complex ( Figure S1 C; Table S2 ).
The shared receptor, IL-12Rβ1, binds to the “back” of p40, at the intersection between the N-terminal D1 Ig and D2 fibronectin domains of p40. IL-12Rβ1 binds p40 in a single, 1,532-Å 2 interface that is characterized by a high degree of charge complementarity between the interacting proteins. The base of the interface is formed by a contiguous, positively charged loop in p40 (His216, Lys217, and Lys219) that interacts with a negatively charged patch in IL-12Rβ1 made up of Glu28, Asp58, and Asp101 ( Figure 1 F). Above these charge-charge interactions sits a hydrophobic strip on p40 formed by the aromatic residues Trp37 and Phe82, which is ringed by polar residues in IL-12Rβ1 (Gln102, Ser106, Tyr109, Gln132, and Tyr134) that make hydrogen bonding interactions with side-chain and main-chain atoms in p40 ( Krissinel and Henrick, 2007 36. Krissinel, E. ∙ Henrick, K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 :774-797 Crossref Scopus (7666) PubMed Google Scholar ; Table S2 ). Interestingly, the IL-12Rβ1 binding site on p40 appears to be a hotspot for protein-protein interactions, as the clinical antibodies ustekinumab and briakinumab, along with the nanobody chaperone Nb22E11, bind to this site ( Figure S2 ) ( Bloch et al., 2018 7.

The IL-23p19/p40 heterodimer bears a strong resemblance to the IL-6Rα/IL-6 binary “site 1” complex, which lead to the conjecture that IL-23 would use a similar receptor assembly mechanism as seen in IL-6 and other gp130-family cytokines ( Figures 2 A and 2B) ( Boulanger et al., 2003a 8.

Charged residues dominate a unique interlocking topography in the heterodimeric cytokine interleukin-12 EMBO J. 2000; 19 :3530-3541 Crossref Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ). IL-6 has formed the paradigm for assembly of “tall” cytokine receptors such as gp130, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), and oncostatin M receptor (OSMR), which contain additional membrane-proximal FNIII domains compared to other “short” cytokine receptors, such as growth hormone receptor (GHR). This assembly model has been correctly applied to signaling complexes for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) ( Skiniotis et al., 2008 67. Skiniotis, G. ∙ Lupardus, P.J. ∙ Martick, M. ...

Boulanger, M.J. ∙ Bankovich, A.J. ∙ Kortemme, T. ... Convergent mechanisms for recognition of divergent cytokines by the shared signaling receptor gp130 Mol.

USA. 2007; 104 :12737-12742 Crossref Scopus (71) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the IL-6 paradigm, the four-helix bundle of IL-6 binds to IL-6Rα and gp130 through opposing helical faces (sites 1 and 2, respectively) while engaging a second gp130 molecule at the tip of IL-6 (site 3) to generate a full, hexameric complex ( Figure 2 C) ( Boulanger et al., 2003b 9. Boulanger, M.J. ∙ Chow, D.C. ∙ Brevnova, E.E. ... Hexameric structure and assembly of the interleukin-6/IL-6 alpha-receptor/gp130 complex Science. 2003; 300 :2101-2104 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Analogous to IL-6, IL-23 consists of a site 1 interaction between IL-23p19 and p40. IL-23R binds IL-23 via a site 3 interaction between the N-terminal Ig domain of IL-23R and the tip of IL-23p19. However, IL-23 breaks with the IL-6 paradigm in that IL-12Rβ1 is predicted to bind to IL-23p19 opposite p40 at the site analogous to IL-6/gp130 “site 2.” Instead, IL-12Rβ1 binds directly to p40, having no contact with the helical cytokine p19 ( Figure 2 D). This interaction predicts that p40 should bind IL-12Rβ1 independently of IL-23p19. Consistent with this, we find that IL-12Rβ1 binds both IL-23 and p40 with similar affinity and thus is not affected by the presence of the helical IL-23p19 subunit ( Figure 2 E). In contrast, IL-23R binding requires the presence of IL-23p19, as predicted by the site 3 interaction observed in the crystal structure.
The modular interaction between p40 and IL-12Rβ1 represents a striking deviation from the typical mechanism of receptor sharing employed by other cytokines. Rather than interacting with multiple cytokines through a cross-reactive interface, IL-12Rβ1 binds the p40 subunit using highly specific interactions characterized by charge complementarity and hydrogen bonding.
We sought to determine if the unusual assembly mechanism we observed for IL-23 extended to the IL-12 receptor complex. Since cryo-EM studies are carried out at relatively dilute protein concentrations at which low-affinity complexes may dissociate, we “affinity-matured” IL-12Rβ1 binding to IL-23 using an error-prone yeast display library in order to stabilize the receptor complexes for structural studies by cryo-EM ( Figure 3 A). Although the selections were performed using IL-23, enriched clones displayed heightened binding to both IL-12 and IL-23, consistent with IL-12Rβ1 binding to the shared p40 subunit of both cytokines ( Figure 3 B). Sequencing of the enriched population revealed a pair of affinity-enhancing mutations in IL-12Rβ1 (Tyr109Ser Gln132Leu, referred to hereafter as affi-IL-12Rβ1), which map to the p40 binding interface, thereby providing independent validation of the interaction observed in the IL-23R crystal structure ( Figures 3 C and 3D).
For structural analysis, IL-23 was complexed with the ectodomain of IL-23R and the full ECD of IL-12Rβ1 (D1–D5) containing affinity-enhancing mutations. The complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography and vitrified on grids for single-particle cryo-EM analysis. Particle projections from 2D averages with well-defined features for the complex were selected for 3D classification, thereby identifying a 3D class that was refined to a resolution of 8.0 Å ( Figures S3 A–S3D; Table S3 ). Despite the low resolution of the maps, individual subunits can be clearly delineated. The overall assembly is consistent with the binding mode observed in the crystal structure in which IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 engage the IL-23p19 and p40 cytokine components, respectively ( Figures 3 E–3G). While both the D1–D2 domains of IL-12Rβ1 are observed in the cryo-EM maps, poor density is seen for IL-12Rβ1 D3–D5, indicating that this region is flexible.
To visualize the IL-12 receptor complex, we applied a similar approach, complexing IL-12, IL-12Rβ2 D1–D3, and affi-IL-12Rβ1 D1–D5. This yielded a structure of the IL-12 receptor complex at a resolution of ∼10 Å ( Figures S3 E–S3H; Table S3 ). The overall architecture of the IL-12 receptor complex is similar to the arrangement seen in the IL-23 crystal structure and cryo-EM maps. IL-12Rβ2 engages IL-12 via an N-terminal Ig domain similar to the interaction between IL-23R and IL-23p19, while IL-12Rβ1 binds the back of p40 ( Figure 3 H-J). In both IL-12 and IL-23, the shared p40 subunit directly binds the common IL-12Rβ1, indicating a convergent function of p40 in mediating the assembly of IL-12 and IL-23 signaling complexes.
Despite use of the shared p40 subunit, IL-12 and IL-23 play nonredundant roles in the immune system. Comparison of the cryo-EM maps indicates that functional differences between IL-12 and IL-23 are likely the result of their unique four-helix bundle components, IL-12p35 and IL-23p19, specifically engaging private receptors, IL-12Rβ2 and IL-23R, which leads to STAT4 and STAT3 activation, respectively. To determine if the four-helix bundle components of IL-12 and IL-23 mediate distinct receptor interactions, we measured binding of IL-12Rβ2 and IL-23R to IL-12 and IL-23 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We found that these “private receptors” mediate highly specific interactions; IL-12Rβ2 binds specifically to IL-12, but not IL-23, and IL-23R binds to IL-23, but not IL-12 ( Figure 4 A).
This extracellular receptor specificity is relayed to distinct patterns of intracellular signaling in which IL-12 led to phosphorylation of STAT4 with minimal activation of STAT3 while IL-23 led to phosphorylation of STAT3 without inducing STAT4 phosphorylation in primary human CD4 + T cells ( Figures 4 B and 4C). The specificity of IL-12 and IL-23 signaling suggests that p40 plays similar roles in both complexes to recruit IL-12Rβ1/Tyk2 and initiate STAT signaling specified by phospho-tyrosine motifs in IL-12Rβ2 and IL-23R.
Based on the shared role of the p40/IL-12Rβ1 interaction in both the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor complexes, we targeted this interface to modulate STAT4 signaling in the context of IL-12, and STAT3 signaling in the context of IL-23, by systematically impairing the efficiency of IL-12Rβ1 recruitment. We created a series of IL-12 and IL-23 variants by introducing alanine substitutions in two loops of p40 D1 that mediate interactions with IL-12Rβ1 ( Figure 4 D). We found that individual alanine mutations (Glu81Ala and Phe82Ala) reduced the potency of IL-12 and IL-23, as indicated by an increase in the half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for phospho-STAT4 (pSTAT4) and phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3). This effect was exaggerated by multiple alanine mutations (4A: Pro39Ala/Asp40Ala/Glu81Ala/Phe82Ala) that had decreased maximal STAT phosphorylation and increased the EC 50 relative to wild-type cytokines ( Figures 4 E and 4F). The magnitude of these effects was larger for IL-23, likely due to the ∼10-fold difference in affinity between IL-12 and IL-23 for IL-12Rβ2 and IL-23R, respectively. The ability of a single interface on p40 to modulate pSTAT3 and pSTAT4 suggests that the p40/IL-12Rβ1 interface can serve as a “fulcrum” to control both IL-12 and IL-23 signaling.
IL-12 has shown promise as a cancer therapy by potentiating both T cells and NK cells; however, systemic administration of IL-12 leads to toxicity associated with heightened IFNγ production ( Cohen, 1995 18. Cohen, J. IL-12 deaths: explanation and a puzzle Science. 1995; 270 :908 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonard et al., 1997 39. Leonard, J.P. ∙ Sherman, M.L. ∙ Fisher, G.L. ... Effects of single-dose interleukin-12 exposure on interleukin-12-associated toxicity and interferon-gamma production Blood. 1997; 90 :2541-2548 PubMed Google Scholar ). Biasing IL-12 to preferentially activate T cells with reduced NK cell IFNγ induction may decrease toxicity by focusing the actions of IL-12 on antigen-specific T cells. An important difference in IL-12 signaling between T cells and NK cells is that antigen stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) enhances IL-12 sensitivity through upregulation of IL-12 receptor subunits ( Szabo et al., 1997 68. Szabo, S.J. ∙ Dighe, A.S. ∙ Gubler, U. ... Regulation of the interleukin (IL)-12R beta 2 subunit expression in developing T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185 :817-824 Crossref Scopus (879) PubMed Google Scholar ). Using p40 as a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) staining reagent to assess IL-12Rβ1 surface expression, we found low levels of IL-12Rβ1 on NK cells and CD8 + T cells; however, stimulation of CD8 + T cells (blasts) led to upregulation of IL-12Rβ1 ( Figures 5 A and S4 A).
Based on our structural finding that p40 mediates recruitment of IL-12Rβ1 in order to initiate heterodimerization with IL-12Rβ2 or IL-23R, we reasoned that reducing the affinity of p40 for IL-12Rβ1 may more severely impair signaling on NK cells, which have reduced levels of IL-12Rβ1 expression relative to antigen-experienced T cells. To test this, we designed a series of alanine mutations in murine p40 that are predicted to disrupt binding to IL-12Rβ1 based on sequence homology with human p40 ( Figure S4 B). To characterize mouse IL-12 variants, we tested signaling on CD8 + T cell blasts, and, as predicted, mutations in p40 at the IL-12Rβ1 binding interface increased the EC 50 and reduced maximal STAT4 phosphorylation ( Figure 5 B). IL-12 with two alanine substitutions (2xAla; Glu81Ala/Phe82Ala) reduced STAT4 phosphorylation to roughly 50% of wild-type, while IL-12 with three (3xAla; Glu81Ala/Phe82Ala/Lys106Ala) or four (4xAla; Glu81Ala/Phe82Ala/Lys106Ala/Lys217Ala) alanine substitutions did not induce measurable STAT4 phosphorylation by flow cytometry; however, we are able to observe residual pSTAT4 by western blot ( Figure 5 C). Functionally, these variants act as IL-12 partial agonists by reducing the maximal signaling output at saturating concentrations of cytokine.
A well-documented effect of IL-12 signaling in both T cells and NK cells is the induction of IFNγ. To determine the capacity of IL-12 partial agonists to promote IFNγ production in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, we activated ovalbumin (OVA)-specific OT-I T cells ( Hogquist et al., 1994 29. Hogquist, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ∙ Heath, W.R. ... T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection Cell. 1994; 76 :17-27 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2402) PubMed Google Scholar ) for 48 h in the presence of IL-12 variants. IL-12 along with the 2xAla, 3xAla, and 4xAla variants led to upregulation of IFNγ as measured by intracellular cytokine stain ( Figures 5 D and S4 C–S4E) and supernatant ELISA ( Figure S4 F). Similar effects were observed in CD4 + T cells, where TCR stimulation led to upregulation of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12 partial agonists supported Th1 polarization of naive CD4 + T cells as measured by IFNγ stain, although to a lesser extent than wild-type IL-12 ( Figures S4 G–S4I). Thus, IL-12 partial agonists support IFNγ induction in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.
To assess the ability of IL-12 variants to stimulate NK cells, we first confirmed that IL-12 partial agonists modulate STAT4 signaling in NK cells. Similar to the effects in CD8 + T cell blasts, we find that mutations in p40 at the IL-12Rβ1 binding site reduce STAT4 phosphorylation in NK cells ( Figure S5 A). Unlike T cells, which require stimulation through the TCR to respond to IL-12, NK cells produce IFNγ in response to IL-12 in combination with the IL-1 family cytokine IL-18 ( Figure S5 B). IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation induced robust IFNγ expression, a response that was attenuated with 3xAla and 4xAla variants as measured by intracellular cytokine stain ( Figures 5 E, S5 C, and S5D) and supernatant ELISA ( Figure S5 E). IL-12 and IL-18 also promoted upregulation of Ifng at the transcript level following 8-h stimulation, an effect that was reduced with 3xAla/IL-18 stimulation ( Figure S5 F); however, under these conditions, we did not observe induction of Tigit by IL-12 ( Figure S5 G). Previously, the γ c family cytokines IL-2 and IL-15 have been shown to modulate the activity of NK cells and lead to upregulation of IL-12 receptor components ( Lehmann et al., 2001 38. Lehmann, C. ∙ Zeis, M. ∙ Uharek, L. Activation of natural killer cells with interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-12 increases perforin binding and subsequent lysis of tumour cells Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 114 :660-665 Crossref Scopus (73) PubMed Google Scholar ; Oka et al., 2020 53. Oka, N. ∙ Markova, T. ∙ Tsuzuki, K. ... IL-12 regulates the expansion, phenotype, and function of murine NK cells activated by IL-15 and IL-18 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2020; 69 :1699-1712 Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ; Romee et al., 2012 63. Romee, R. ∙ Schneider, S.E. ∙ Leong, J.W. ... Cytokine activation induces human memory-like NK cells Blood. 2012; 120 :4751-4760 Crossref Scopus (470) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these reports, we find that pre-activation of NK cells with IL-2 led to a slight upregulation of IL-12Rβ1 ( Figure S5 H). Addition of IL-2 to NK cell cultures increased IFNγ production above IL-18 alone; however, IL-2 did not synergize with 3xAla and 4xAla to enhance IFNγ induction above IL-2/IL-18 ( Figure S5 I).
To determine if human IL-12 partial agonists were capable of eliciting cell-type-specific responses, we assessed IL-12Rβ1 expression and IFNγ production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Similar to our findings in mouse, TCR stimulation enhanced IL-12Rβ1 expression in CD8 + T cells above that of nonactivated T cells and NK cells ( Figures S6 A and S6B). We generated analogous IL-12 muteins and tested pSTAT4 signaling in CD8 + T cell blasts ( Figures S6 C and S6D). Human IL-12 partial agonists preferentially supported induction of IFNγ by CD8 + T cells relative to NK cells ( Figures S6 E and S6F). These findings indicate that upregulation of IL-12Rβ1 is a conserved mechanism used by T cells to enhance sensitivity to IL-12 signaling and that IL-12 partial agonists are capable of biasing signaling toward T cells in both human and mouse.
In CD8 + T cells, IL-12 acts to potentiate antigen-specific killing of tumors and virally infected cells through upregulation of cytotoxic factors, such as granzyme B, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines, including IFNγ ( Aste-Amezaga et al., 1994 2. Aste-Amezaga, M. ∙ D’Andrea, A. ∙ Kubin, M. ... Cooperation of natural killer cell stimulatory factor/interleukin-12 with other stimuli in the induction of cytokines and cytotoxic cell-associated molecules in human T and NK cells Cell. Immunol. 1994; 156 :480-492 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ; Rubinstein et al., 2015 64. Rubinstein, M.P. ∙ Su, E.W. ∙ Suriano, S. ... Interleukin-12 enhances the function and anti-tumor activity in murine and human CD8(+) T cells Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2015; 64 :539-549 Crossref Scopus (31) PubMed Google Scholar ). A well-described role of IFNγ is the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, which can render transformed cells sensitive to T cell surveillance ( Zhou, 2009 86. Zhou, F. Molecular mechanisms of IFN-gamma to up-regulate MHC class I antigen processing and presentation Int. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 28 :239-260 Crossref Scopus (290) PubMed Google Scholar ). To determine if supernatants from OT-I effector T cells were capable of driving MHC class I upregulation, we assessed MHC class I surface expression on B16-F10 murine melanoma cells by antibody stain following incubation with supernatants from OT-I effectors. Supernatants from IL-12 and partial agonist cultures more potently induced MHC class I expression than supernatant generated in the absence of IL-12, consistent with elevated IFNγ levels observed by intracellular stain and ELISA ( Figure 5 F).
Our finding that IL-12 partial agonists promote IFNγ production and subsequent upregulation of MHC class I on tumor cells led us to examine the capacity of IL-12 partial agonists to potentiate tumor cell killing. To measure antigen-specific CD8 + T cell killing, we transduced B16-F10 cells with a plasmid containing OVA along with a GFP marker (OVA-GFP) and added these cells 1:1 with wild-type B16-F10 cells. This mixture of B16-F10 cells was then incubated with OT-I effectors, and the frequency of OVA-GFP-expressing cells was used as a readout of antigen-specific tumor cell killing ( Figure 5 G). OT-I effectors generated in the presence of IL-12 or partial agonists were able to kill OVA-expressing tumor cells at a lower effector to target ratio, indicating increased potency of anti-tumor response ( Figure 5 H). Together, these data indicate that IL-12 partial agonists with reduced affinity for IL-12Rβ1 promote IFNγ production and tumor cell killing by antigen-specific CD8 + T cells with reduced activity on NK cells.
To test whether IL-12 partial agonists elicit cell-type-specific responses in vivo , we adoptively transferred OT-I CD8 + T cells into congenic recipients and immunized with OVA (257–264) in incomplete Freud’s adjuvant (OVA-IFA) followed by daily cytokine administration for 5 days ( Figure 6 A). For in vivo studies, we expressed IL-12 and partial agonists in mammalian cells (Expi293F) and confirmed that mammalian-expressed IL-12 partial agonists retain cell-type bias in vitro , as seen for the baculovirus-expressed material used previously ( Figures S7 A–S7F).
Treatment with IL-12, but not 2xAla and 3xAla, induced weight loss and elevated levels of IFNγ in serum ( Figures 6 B and 6C). To assess the impact of immunization on T cell activation, we monitored expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on OT-I T cells. Immunization increased the frequency of PD-1 + OT-I T cells independent of cytokine treatment, indicating activation of adoptively transferred cells ( Figures 6 D, 6E, and S7 G). The effects of immunization were potentiated by IL-12, which increased the frequency of OT-I T cells in the draining lymph node, an effect not seen with partial agonists ( Figure 6 F). Within NK cells, IL-12, but not partial agonists, increased a population of activated NK cells as measured by high side scatter (SSC) and expression of the inhibitory receptor LAG-3 ( Figures 6 G and S7 H).
Previously, the IL-2Rα chain, CD25, has been described as a marker of activated T cells ( Au-Yeung et al., 2017 3. Au-Yeung, B.B. ∙ Smith, G.A. ∙ Mueller, J.L. ... IL-2 modulates the TCR signaling threshold for CD8 but not CD4 T cell proliferation on a single-cell level J. Immunol. 2017; 198 :2445-2456 Crossref Scopus (77) PubMed Google Scholar ) and NK cells ( Leong et al., 2014 40. Leong, J.W. ∙ Chase, J.M. ∙ Romee, R. ... Preactivation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 induces CD25 and a functional high-affinity IL-2 receptor on human cytokine-induced memory-like natural killer cells Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2014; 20 :463-473 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (196) PubMed Google Scholar ). IL-12 strongly upregulated CD25 expression on both OT-I T cells and NK cells, while the 2xAla and 3xAla partial agonists led to intermediate upregulation of CD25 on OT-I T cells without increasing expression on NK cells ( Figures 6 H–6J). Interestingly, while the 2xAla variant did not exhibit as significant T/NK cell bias as the 3xAla variant in vitro ( Figures S7 E and S7F), it shows comparably strong T/NK cell bias to 3xAla in vivo , highlighting that the therapeutic window will likely be quantitatively different in vitro than in vivo . These results indicate that IL-12 partial agonists support intermediate levels of T cell activation with reduced NK cell stimulation and toxicity in vivo .
Based on in vitro characterization and in vivo cell profiling, IL-12 partial agonists may be capable of supporting anti-tumor T cell immunity without systemic toxicity by biasing the activity of IL-12 toward antigen-specific T cells and away from NK cells. To determine the capacity of IL-12 partial agonists to provide therapeutic benefit in vivo , we performed tumor studies using the colon adenocarcinoma MC-38, which has been shown to be responsive to IL-12 ( Corbett et al., 1975 21. Corbett, T.H. ∙ Griswold, Jr., D.P. ∙ Roberts, B.J. ... Tumor induction relationships in development of transplantable cancers of the colon in mice for chemotherapy assays, with a note on carcinogen structure Cancer Res. 1975; 35 :2434-2439 PubMed Google Scholar ; Nastala et al., 1994 52. Nastala, C.L. ∙ Edington, H.D. ∙ McKinney, T.G. ... Recombinant IL-12 administration induces tumor regression in association with IFN-gamma production J. Immunol. 1994; 153 :1697-1706 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Mice were engrafted with MC-38 for 1 week prior to initiation of daily cytokine treatment for 7 days ( Figure 7 A). IL-12 administration, either at 1 μg or 30 μg, resulted in profound toxicity, as measured by weight loss ( Figure 7 B), elevated serum IFNγ ( Figure 7 C), and reduced mobility ( Figures 7 D and 7E). All mice administered 30 μg IL-12 succumbed to lethal toxicity between days 13 and 15. As a result, we were unable to measure mobility of these mice on day 16. In contrast, the 2xAla and 3xAla partial agonists were well tolerated and did not induce toxicity in tumor-bearing mice. Although additional IL-12-responsive cell types, including intraepithelial type 1 innate lymphoid cells ( Fuchs et al., 2013 28. Fuchs, A. ∙ Vermi, W. ∙ Lee, J.S. ... Intraepithelial type 1 innate lymphoid cells are a unique subset of IL-12- and IL-15-responsive IFN-γ-producing cells Immunity. 2013; 38 :769-781 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (758) PubMed Google Scholar ) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells ( Wallington et al., 2018 76. Wallington, J.C. ∙ Williams, A.P. ∙ Staples, K.J. ... IL-12 and IL-7 synergize to control mucosal-associated invariant T-cell cytotoxic responses to bacterial infection J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2018; 141 :2182-2195.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (51) PubMed Google Scholar ), are present in vivo , we find that IL-12 partial agonists with reduced activity on NK cells do not induce systemic toxicity, consistent with the requirement for NK cells in IL-12-mediated toxicity ( Biber et al., 2002 6. Biber, J.L. ∙ Jabbour, S. ∙ Parihar, R. ... Administration of two macrophage-derived interferon-gamma-inducing factors (IL-12 and IL-15) induces a lethal systemic inflammatory response in mice that is dependent on natural killer cells but does not require interferon-gamma Cell.

Coadministration of interleukin-18 and interleukin-12 induces a fatal inflammatory response in mice: critical role of natural killer cell interferon-gamma production and STAT-mediated signal transduction Blood. 2000; 96 :1465-1473 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
Both IL-12 and partial agonists attenuated tumor growth and prolonged survival relative to treatment with PBS ( Figures 7 F–7H). However, the 2xAla and 3xAla partial agonists did so without inducing the systemic toxicity observed with IL-12 administration. These results provide additional in vivo support for our hypothesis that the biased agonists, designed based on the structure of the IL-12Rβ1 shared interface, have the capacity to decouple T cell from NK cell activation, significantly reducing IL-12 pleiotropy.

Section: Discussion

A key feature of cytokine signaling is the use of shared receptors that act as common signal transducing subunits for multiple cytokines. Unlike other shared receptors, which interact with multiple four-helix bundle cytokines through cross-reactive interfaces ( Wang et al., 2009 77. Wang, X. ∙ Lupardus, P. ∙ Laporte, S.L. ... Structural biology of shared cytokine receptors Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 :29-60 Crossref Scopus (320) PubMed Google Scholar ), we find that IL-12Rβ1 binds directly to the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, which is an Ig-fold protein reminiscent of cytokine receptor ECDs, rather than the IL-23p19 four-helical bundle typically engaged by cytokine receptors. The nature of this interaction is completely unique among the known cytokine receptor complexes.
How this “non-canonical” mechanism of receptor assembly emerged is unclear. It is worth noting that p40 shares homology with the single-pass transmembrane cytokine receptors IL-6Rα, IL-11Rα, and CNTF receptor (CNTFR). These Ig superfamily (IgSF) proteins share a similar domain architecture with an N-terminal Ig domain followed by a cytokine-binding homology region formed by tandem fibronectin (FNIII) domains. Despite structural similarity between IL-6Rα/IL-6 and IL-23, the mechanism of receptor assembly differs, as IL-6 interacts with both IL-6Rα and gp130 receptor subunits through sites on the four-helix bundle cytokine (sites 1, 2, and 3), while IL-23 engages IL-23R and IL-12Rβ1 through two distinct sites on IL-23p19 and p40. Thus, IL-12 and IL-23 have evolved in such a way to dispense with the typical site 2 interaction and have created a new interaction with the N-terminal Ig domain of p40. Interestingly, IL-6Rα, IL-11Rα, and CNTFR also contain an N-terminal Ig domain; however, this domain is not required for assembly of the canonical IL-6R complex ( Boulanger et al., 2003b 9. Boulanger, M.J. ∙ Chow, D.C. ∙ Brevnova, E.E. ... Hexameric structure and assembly of the interleukin-6/IL-6 alpha-receptor/gp130 complex Science. 2003; 300 :2101-2104 Crossref Scopus (536) PubMed Google Scholar ). What role, if any, this domain serves is currently unclear.
In addition to IL-12 and IL-23, a more recently identified set of heterodimeric cytokines have been characterized that utilize the secreted factor Epstein Bar virus induced 3 (Ebi3). Similar to p40, Ebi3 contains tandem fibronectin domains and has been shown to pair with four-helix bundles IL-27p28 (IL-27), IL-12p35 (IL-35), and IL-23p19 (IL-39) to form a second set of heterodimeric cytokines that signal through the shared gp130 receptor ( Collison et al., 2007 19. Collison, L.W. ∙ Workman, C.J. ∙ Kuo, T.T. ...

A novel IL-23p19/Ebi3 (IL-39) cytokine mediates inflammation in lupus-like mice Eur. J. Immunol. 2016; 46 :1343-1350 Crossref Scopus (128) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, unlike p40, Ebi3 lacks an N-terminal Ig domain. Our finding that p40 engages IL-12Rβ1 via its N-terminal Ig domain suggests that the mechanism of sharing for Ebi3-containing cytokines is likely different than that of IL-12 and IL-23. Instead, we suggest that these cytokines may assemble receptor complexes in a manner similar to the site1/2/3 paradigm of IL-6/CNTF/LIF.
The modular receptor assembly mechanism used by IL-12 and IL-23 suggests that expression of cytokine components alone should antagonize signaling by binding to receptors but failing to induce dimerization. Indeed, expression of either IL-12p35 ( Dambuza et al., 2017 22. Dambuza, I.M. ∙ He, C. ∙ Choi, J.K. ... IL-12p35 induces expansion of IL-10 and IL-35-expressing regulatory B cells and ameliorates autoimmune disease Nat.

USA. 2020; 117 :21557-21567 Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ) in isolation has been reported to antagonize IL-12 signaling. Consistent with these reports, blocking antibodies that bind p40 inhibits signaling of both IL-12 and IL-23 ( Benson et al., 2011 4. Benson, J.M. ∙ Sachs, C.W. ∙ Treacy, G. ... Therapeutic targeting of the IL-12/23 pathways: generation and characterization of ustekinumab Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 :615-624 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ). Comparison of p40 binding antibodies and nanobodies with the IL-12Rβ1 complex reported here explains the basis for their antagonism and suggests that p40-targeted antagonists will be unable to confer cytokine-specific activity, as they directly compete with IL-12Rβ1 for cytokine binding ( Figure S2 ). Instead, cytokine-specific antagonists must target the specific interaction between the helical subunits of the cytokines and IL-12Rβ2 or IL-23R. A second generation of IL-23 antagonists targeting IL-23p19 are in clinical trials or have been approved for use in plaque psoriasis ( Chan et al., 2018 14. Chan, T.C. ∙ Hawkes, J.E. ∙ Krueger, J.G. Interleukin 23 in the skin: role in psoriasis pathogenesis and selective interleukin 23 blockade as treatment Ther. Adv. Chronic Dis. 2018; 9 :111-119 Crossref Scopus (89) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kopp et al., 2015 34. Kopp, T. ∙ Riedl, E. ∙ Bangert, C. ... Clinical improvement in psoriasis with specific targeting of interleukin-23 Nature. 2015; 521 :222-226 Crossref Scopus (186) PubMed Google Scholar ). Unlike p40 binding antagonists, these therapies limit antibody blockade to IL-23 while preserving IL-12 signaling and as a result may limit unwanted side-effects of p40 blockade ( Koutruba et al., 2010 35. Koutruba, N. ∙ Emer, J. ∙ Lebwohl, M. Review of ustekinumab, an interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 inhibitor used for the treatment of plaque psoriasis Ther. Clin. Risk Manag. 2010; 6 :123-141 PubMed Google Scholar ). Increased specificity of IL-23 blockade may reduce off-target effects; however, this strategy blocks both pathogenic and protective effects of IL-23. Future work will focus on generating IL-23 partial agonists that preserve immune function at barrier sites without potentiating autoimmune conditions.
In contrast to IL-23, therapeutic modulation of IL-12 signaling has focused on potentiation of IL-12 signaling in the context of cancer immunotherapy. Current therapeutic approaches have attempted to limit toxicity associated with IL-12 administration by targeting IL-12 to tumors through antibody fusion ( Pasche et al., 2012 56. Pasche, N. ∙ Wulhfard, S. ∙ Pretto, F. ... The antibody-based delivery of interleukin-12 to the tumor neovasculature eradicates murine models of cancer in combination with paclitaxel Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18 :4092-4103 Crossref Scopus (74) PubMed Google Scholar ), collagen binding ( Momin et al., 2019 48. Momin, N. ∙ Mehta, N.K. ∙ Bennett, N.R. ... Anchoring of intratumorally administered cytokines to collagen safely potentiates systemic cancer immunotherapy Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11 :eaaw2614 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ), transfer of IL-12-expressing cells ( Pegram et al., 2012 57. Pegram, H.J. ∙ Lee, J.C. ∙ Hayman, E.G. ... Tumor-targeted T cells modified to secrete IL-12 eradicate systemic tumors without need for prior conditioning Blood. 2012; 119 :4133-4141 Crossref Scopus (555) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zitvogel et al., 1995 88. Zitvogel, L. ∙ Tahara, H. ∙ Robbins, P.D. ... Cancer immunotherapy of established tumors with IL-12. Effective delivery by genetically engineered fibroblasts J. Immunol. 1995; 155 :1393-1403 PubMed Google Scholar ), or introduction of IL-12-coding nucleic acid ( Fewell et al., 2009 27. Fewell, J.G. ∙ Matar, M.M. ∙ Rice, J.S. ... Treatment of disseminated ovarian cancer using nonviral interleukin-12 gene therapy delivered intraperitoneally J. Gene Med. 2009; 11 :718-728 Crossref Scopus (44) PubMed Google Scholar ; Tamura et al., 2001 69. Tamura, T. ∙ Nishi, T. ∙ Goto, T. ... Intratumoral delivery of interleukin 12 expression plasmids with in vivo electroporation is effective for colon and renal cancer Hum. Gene Ther. 2001; 12 :1265-1276 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ). Broadly, these strategies rely on regulating the spatial distribution of cytokine. This is in contrast with the approach used here in which we narrowed the pleiotropic effects of IL-12 by leveraging differences in receptor expression across cell types and activation states. By limiting the activity of IL-12 to T cells, IL-12 partial agonists elicit anti-tumor activity without inducing systemic toxicity associated with IL-12 administration. As toxicity has been a major limitation to the clinical implementation of IL-12 ( Cohen, 1995 18. Cohen, J. IL-12 deaths: explanation and a puzzle Science. 1995; 270 :908 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Leonard et al., 1997 39. Leonard, J.P. ∙ Sherman, M.L. ∙ Fisher, G.L. ... Effects of single-dose interleukin-12 exposure on interleukin-12-associated toxicity and interferon-gamma production Blood. 1997; 90 :2541-2548 PubMed Google Scholar ), IL-12 partial agonists with reduced cytokine pleiotropy may provide a mechanism to enhance the therapeutic utility of IL-12. Collectively, our results reveal new strategies to design IL-12 and IL-23 agonists and antagonists with improved therapeutic potential.

USA. 2002; 99 :13419-13424 Crossref Scopus (540) PubMed Google Scholar ) maintained in FreeStyle 293 Expression Media (GIBCO) with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Fisher Scientific) and GlutaMAX (GIBCO). For cell signaling assays and in vivo studies, proteins were expressed in Expi293F cells (GIBCO) maintained in Expi293 Expression Media (GIBCO). HEK293S and Expi293 cells are of female human origin and were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2 and gentle agitation.
For in vitro tumor cell killing, B16-F10 cells (ATCC) derived from male murine pulmonary melanoma were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific), GlutaMAX (GIBCO), and penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO). For in vivo tumor studies, MC-38 (Kerafast) derived from female murine colon adenocarcinoma were maintained in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, MEM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 10mM HEPES (GIBCO), and penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO). Tumor cells were grown at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Cell lines were not authenticated but were checked regularly for morphology and viability.
For recombinant protein expression, baculovirus was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9 ) ovarian cells (ATCC) maintained in Sf-900 III medium (GIBCO) with 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific) and GlutaMAX (GIBCO). Protein was expressed by baculoviral infection of Trichoplusia ni ( T. ni) ovarian cells (Expression Systems) maintained in ESF 921 Insect Cell Culture Medium (Expression Systems). Insect cells were grown at 27°C with ambient CO 2 and gentle agitation.
EBY100 yeast (ATCC) were cultured at 30°C with shaking in YPD media (Sigma) and selected in media containing glucose and casamino acids (SDCAA): 1L deionize water with 20 g dextrose (Sigma), 6.7g yeast nitrogen base (RPI), 5g Bacto casamino acids (GIBCO), 10.4g sodium citrate (Sigma), and 6.4g citric acid monohydrate (Sigma), pH 4.5. Expression was induced at 20°C with shaking in galactose containing media (SGCAA) which resembles SDCAA but includes 20 g galactose (Sigma) instead of glucose.
Peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human donors were obtained from Stanford Blood Bank and cultured in complete RPMI: RPMI 1640-glutaMAX (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific), 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (βME, Sigma), MEM non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), sodium pyruvate (GIBCO), 15mM HEPES (GIBCO), and penicillin-streptomycin (GIBCO) at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
Primary mouse lymphocytes were isolated from secondary lymphoid organs of female mice and cultured in complete RPMI at 37°C with 5% CO 2 .
Female C57BL/6J, C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/j and B6.PL- Thy1 a /CyJ age 8-12 weeks were obtained from Jackson Labs or bred in house. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle at Stanford University. All mouse experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC) protocol number 32279.
For crystallographic studies, human p40 (23-328), IL-23p19 (20-189), and IL-12Rβ1 D1-D2 (25-239) were cloned into the pAcSG2 baculoviral vector with an N-terminal GP64 signal sequence. P40 and IL-12Rβ1 were expressed with a C-terminal 6xHis while IL-23p19 lacked a C-terminal tag. Human IL-23R (1-315) was cloned into the pVLAD6 BacMam vector with C-terminal 3C protease site, Protein C tag, and 6xHis. Baculovirus was produced by transfection of Sf9 insect cells with Cellfectin II (GIBCO) and Sapphire Baculovirus DNA (Allele) followed by viral amplification in Sf9 . For IL-23 production, T. ni cells were coinfected with p40 and IL-23p19 baculovirus in the presence of the endoplasmic reticulum mannosidase I (ERM1) inhibitor, kifunensine (Toronto Research Chemicals). 48-72 h post infection, heterodimeric IL-23 was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superdex S200 Increase column (Cytiva). Similarly, IL-12Rβ1 was expressed by baculoviral infection of T. ni cells followed by Ni-NTA purification and SEC. IL-23R was expressed by baculoviral infection of GnTI deficient HEK293S suspension cells, Ni-NTA purification and SEC.
For IL-12Rβ1 structure determination, initial crystals of native IL-12Rβ1 were grown by vapor diffusion from 1.75 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M NaCl, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 5.9. These crystals were then used for microseeding to grow both native and SeMet-labeled crystals using the same precipitant solution. For selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeling, IL-12Rβ1 D1-D2 (25-239) was expressed by baculovirus infection of T. ni cells in Met-free medium (Expression Systems) in the presence of SeMet (Fisher Scientific) and purified as described for native IL-12Rβ1. Data of native and SeMet-derivative crystals were collected at a temperature of 100K at beamline 8.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and at beamline 12-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), respectively. All data were processed with the XDS package ( Kabsch, 2010 31. Kabsch, W. Xds Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12943) PubMed Google Scholar ). The structure of IL-12Rβ1 was solved by SeMet multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) using autoSHARP ( Vonrhein et al., 2007 75. Vonrhein, C. ∙ Blanc, E. ∙ Roversi, P. ... Automated structure solution with autoSHARP Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 364 :215-230 PubMed Google Scholar ). The program COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 25. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20222) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used for model building. Refinement against the native dataset was carried out in PHENIX ( Liebschner et al., 2019 42. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1 . The structure was deposited in the RCSB protein databank with accession ID PDB: 6WDP .
For complex structural determination, IL-23 and receptor components were treated with endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and 3C protease along with carboxypeptidase A (Sigma) and B (Sigma) overnight at 4°C. SEC fractions containing all complex components were collected and concentrated to 12.4mg/mL. The complex crystalized in a solution of Peg12K, CAPSO pH9.4, 5% dioxane, 10% spermine HCl. Diffraction data was collected at 100K at SSRL beamline 12-2. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using XDS. The quaternary complex structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program PHASER using the partial complex of IL-23R and IL-23 (PDB: 5MZV ) ( Bloch et al., 2018 7. Bloch, Y. ∙ Bouchareychas, L. ∙ Merceron, R. ... Structural activation of pro-inflammatory human cytokine IL-23 by cognate IL-23 receptor enables recruitment of the shared receptor IL-12Rβ1 Immunity. 2018; 48 :45-58.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (91) PubMed Google Scholar ) and D1 of IL-12Rβ1 (reported here) as search models. Due to clashes with symmetry mates, D1-D2 of IL-12Rβ1 could not be placed as a unit by molecular replacement and only D1 is modeled in the complex structure ( Figure S1 D). The final model was built by iterative cycles of reciprocal space refinement with PHENIX and manual rebuilding using COOT. The structure was deposited in the RCSB protein databank with accession ID PDB: 6WDQ . Crystallographic software used in the project was installed and configured by SBGrid ( Morin et al., 2013 50. Morin, A. ∙ Eisenbraun, B. ∙ Key, J. ... Collaboration gets the most out of software eLife. 2013; 2 :e01456 Crossref Scopus (683) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For affinity measurements, human p40 (23-328) was cloned into pD649 vector with an N-terminal HA signal peptide, C-terminal AviTag (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE) and 6xHis. Human IL-12p35 (23-219) and IL-23p19 (28-189) were cloned into pD649 with an N-terminal HA signal peptide, Flag-tag, and TEV protease site. IL-12 (IL-12p35 and p40), IL-23 (IL-23p19 and p40) and p40 alone were expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F cells (GIBCO) using ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (GIBCO) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Supernatants were subject to Ni-NTA purification and incubated with soluble BirA ligase in buffer containing 0.5mM Bicine (pH 8.3), 100mM ATP, 100mM magnesium acetate, and 500 μM biotin overnight at 4°C. Biotinylated proteins were then purified by SEC.
Affinity measurements were made using a BIAcore T100 instrument. Biotinylated cytokines or biotinylated frizzled 8 (Fzd8) control were immobilized on a streptavidin sensor chip (Cytiva) at low density (∼100RU) and binding to recombinant receptor ECDs was measured. For BIAcore studies, human IL-23R (1-309) was cloned into the pVLAD6 BacMam vector with C-terminal 3C protease site, Protein C tag, and 6xHis. hIL-23R was produced in GnTI- HEK293S cells and purified by Ni-NTA followed by SEC. Human IL-12Rβ2 D1-D3 (24-317) was cloned into the pAcSG2 with an N-terminal GP64 signal sequence and a C-terminal 6xHis tag. IL-12Rβ2 was expressed in T. ni cells and purified by Ni-NTA followed by SEC. The D1-D2 domains of IL-12Rβ1, either wild-type or Tyr109Ser Gln132Leu (affi-IL-12Rβ1), was expressed in T. ni cells as described for crystallization.
Binding measurements were performed at 25°C with a flow rate of 50 μL/min. Receptor ECDs were diluted in HBS containing 0.005% P20 (HBS-P, Cytiva) and injected over the chip for 120 s followed by a 500 s dissociation phase. Following each injection, the chip was regenerated with 4M MgCl 2 . Binding curves were exported for analysis in Prism (Graphpad Software) and steady state affinity was calculated using BIAevaluation software (Cytiva).
The D1-D2 domains of human IL-12Rβ1 (25-234) were cloned into the pCT302 yeast display vector with an N-terminal Aga2 followed by a 3C protease site and a C-terminal Myc-tag ( Midelfort et al., 2004 47. Midelfort, K.S. ∙ Hernandez, H.H. ∙ Lippow, S.M. ... Substantial energetic improvement with minimal structural perturbation in a high affinity mutant antibody J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343 :685-701 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). EBY100 yeast (ATCC) were transformed with IL-12Rβ1 display vector, selected in media containing glucose and casamino acids (SDCAA) followed by induction with galactose containing media (SGCAA) ( Chao et al., 2006 15. Chao, G. ∙ Lau, W.L. ∙ Hackel, B.J. ... Isolating and engineering human antibodies using yeast surface display Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1 :755-768 Crossref Scopus (677) PubMed Google Scholar ). Proper folding was confirmed by αmyc AF488 staining (Cell Signaling Technologies) and IL-23 tetramer (biotinylated IL-23 complexed with streptavidin-AF647 at a 4:1 molar ratio). For IL-23 staining, human IL-23p19 (28-189) was cloned into the pAcSG2 baculoviral vector with GP64 signal peptide and co-expressed with human p40 (23-328) in pAcGP67a baculoviral vector with an N-terminal GP64 signal peptide and C-terminal BirA substrate peptide (LHHILDAQKMVWNHR) and 6xHis tag. Similarly, IL-12 was expressed by co-infection of human p40 with human IL-12p35 (22-212) in pAcSG2 with an N-terminal GP64 signal sequence. Heterodimeric IL-12 and IL-23 were purified by Ni-NTA and biotinylated in vitro . An error prone library of IL-12Rβ1 was generated using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with 0.1ng DNA/reaction, to achieve an average mutation rate of 3.3 mutations/gene. EBY100 yeast were electroporated to generate a library with a diversity of 1.09x10 9 . The library was selected for IL-23 binding over five rounds of increasing selection stringency starting with 200nM magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) using Streptavidin microbeads (Miltenyi Cat#130-048-101) with LS magnetic selection column (Miltenyi Cat#130-042-401) and finishing with 1nM monomer selection by fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) using a SH800S cell sorter (Sony). DNA from enriched yeast was isolated using the Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep II Kit (Zymo Research), transformed into DH5α (Zymo Research), and sequenced by rolling circle amplification to identify convergent mutations. To track enrichment of cytokine binding, yeast expressing wild-type IL-12Rβ1 or error prone library from various rounds were stained with αmyc AF488 and 10nM cytokine (biotinylated IL-12 or IL-23) followed by 50nM streptavidin-AF647 to detect binding of biotinylated monomer. Fluorescence intensity was measured using CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo software (BD).
For electron microscopy, the ectodomain of human affi-IL-12Rβ1 (25-542) was cloned into the pAcGP67a baculoviral vector with an N-terminal GP64 signal peptide and C-terminal 6xHis tag. IL-23R was expressed as described for SPR measurements and complexed with T. ni expressed IL-23 (coinfection of IL-23p19 and p40, as described in Affinity maturation of IL-12Rβ1 ) and affi-IL-12Rβ1. The complex was purified by SEC and concentrated to 1.04mg/mL. Samples were spiked with 0.05% octyl beta glucoside and applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil Au1.2/1.3, 200 mesh grids (SPI supplies), then plunge-froze in liquid ethane using FEI Vitrobot. Data were collected using Titan Krios at 300 kV with a Gatan K3 direct detection camera. Raw images were collected as a movie, recorded at a magnification of 29,000 x corresponding to 0.85 pixel per Å. Each of these movies were recorded for 2 s at 0.05 s/frame with a total dose of 44 electrons/Å 2 and defocus values ranging from −1.5 to −2.4 microns. The frames were motion-corrected, dose-weighted using motioncor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 85. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ), and contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were determined by CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015 62. Rohou, A. ∙ Grigorieff, N. CTFFIND4: fast and accurate defocus estimation from electron micrographs J. Struct. Biol. 2015; 192 :216-221 Crossref Scopus (2867) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particles were semi-automatically picked based on a template built from manually picked particles using Autopick software from Relion pipeline ( Zivanov et al., 2018 89. Zivanov, J. ∙ Nakane, T. ∙ Forsberg, B.O. ... New tools for automated high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination in RELION-3 eLife. 2018; 7 :e42166 Crossref Scopus (2943) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle projections were sorted by reference-free 2D classification and 2D averages with well-defined complex features were selected for 3D classification. The most well resolved 3D class was further refined to an indicated resolution of 8.0 Å, according to 0.143 “gold-standard” Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criteria and deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under accession ID EMD-21646 ( Figures S3 A–S3D). X-ray crystal structures of the individual components were fit into the map by using Chimera software to visualize the relative arrangement of the receptors. For the IL-23 model individual components of IL-23R (PDB: 5MZV ), IL-23 (PDB: 3DUH ), and IL-12Rβ1 (reported here) fit to the map density.
IL-12 complexes for cryo-EM were analogous to those used for IL-23. Human IL-12p35 (22-212) was cloned into pAcSG2 with an N-terminal GP64 signal sequence. Human IL-12Rβ2 (24-317) was expressed as described for SPR measurements. Heterodimeric IL-12 (coinfection of IL-12p35 and p40), affi-IL-12Rβ1 D1-D5, and IL-12Rβ2 were expressed in T. ni cells. Complex components were mixed and purified by SEC. Fractions were concentrated to 0.9mg/mL and samples were processed as described above. Data were collected and processed similar to the approach described for IL-23 with the exception that Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 84. Zhang, K. Gctf: real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2392) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to obtain CTF parameters ( Figures S3 E–S3H). The most well resolved 3D class was further refined to an indicated resolution of ∼10 Å, according to 0.143 “gold-standard” Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criteria and deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under accession ID EMD-21645. For the IL-12 model, IL-12Rβ2 (no reported crystal structure, using IL-23R PDB: 5MZV in model), IL-12 (PDB: 1F45 ), and IL-12Rβ1 (reported here) were fit to the map density.
For human T cell signaling, IL-12 and IL-23 variants were produced in Expi293F cells (GIBCO) as described for surface plasmon resonance experiments. IL-12p35 and IL-23p19 were co-transfected with p40 variants (wild-type, Glu81Ala, Phe82Ala, 4A: Pro39Ala Asp40Ala Glu81Ala Phe82Ala, 2xAla: Glu81Ala Phe82Ala, 3xAla: Glu81Ala Phe82Ala Lys106Ala) and purified by Ni-NTA followed by SEC. Human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from Stanford Blood Bank samples using SepMate-50 columns (StemCell Technologies) with Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Cytiva). Cells were diluted in sterile PBS (GIBCO) with 2% FBS (Fisher Scientific) and added to SepMate-50 columns pre-loaded with 15mL Ficoll. Red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (GIBCO) for 5 min, quenched with PBS containing 2% FBS (Fisher Scientific) and resuspended at 50x10 6 /mL in freezing media containing 90% FBS (Fisher Scientific) and 10% DMSO (Fisher Scientific). Cells were stored frozen at −80°C until ready for use. Human PBMCs were stimulated in 6 well plates coated with 2.5 μg/mL αCD3 (OKT3, BioLegend) in complete RPMI supplemented with 5 μg/mL αCD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend), and 100IU/mL recombinant human IL-2. Cells were cultured for 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO 2 , washed once, and rested overnight in complete RPMI. For STAT signaling, cells were stained with αCD4 PacBlue (RPA-T4, BD) for CD4+ T cell signaling or αCD8 BV605 (SK1, BioLegend) for CD8+ T cells signaling and stimulated with IL-12 and IL-23 variants for 20 minutes at 37°C prior to fixation with 1.6% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in methanol and stored at −20°C until analysis. Cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS pH7.4 with 2% FBS and 2mM EDTA) and stained with antibodies against STAT4 pY693 AF488 (38/p-Stat4, BD) and STAT3 pY705 AF647 (4/P-STAT3, BD) for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity of pSTAT staining in CD4+ T cells was analyzed using a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
For analysis of IL-12Rβ1 in human PBMCs, cells were stained directly ( ex vivo ) or activated as described above to generate T cell blasts. To identify T cells and NK cells, Fc receptors were blocked with TruStain FcX (BioLegend) and cells were stained with a phenotyping panel of αCD3 Pacific Blue (UCHT1, BioLegend), αCD4 FITC (OKT4, BioLegend), αCD8 AF750 (R&D systems), and αCD56 BV605 (HCD56, BioLegend). Human p40 tetramers were prepared by mixing 200nM streptavidin-AF647 with four-fold molar excess of biotinylated p40 expressed as described in the surface plasmon resonance section. Cells were stained for 2 h at 4°C followed by live cell detection using propidium iodide (PI, Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed using CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) followed by analysis in FlowJo (BD). CD8+ T cells were defined as liveCD3+CD8+, NK cells were defined as liveCD3-CD56+. See Figure S6 B for gating.
For human CD8+ T cell IFNγ induction assay, CD8+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs by MACS using CD8+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) and LS magnetic columns (Miltenyi). Purified CD8+ T cells were stimulated at 80,000 cells/well in 96-well round bottom plates in coated with 2 μg/mL αCD3 (OKT3, BioLegend) in the presence of 0.5 μg/mL αCD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend), and 5ng/mL human IL-2. After 48 h, cells were pelleted and supernatant was analyzed using human IFNγ ELISA MAX Deluxe (BioLegend) with Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates (BioLegend).
For human NK cell IFNγ induction assays, NK cells were isolated from PBMCs by MACS using the EasySep human NK cell isolation kit (StemCell) with EasySep Magnet (StemCell). Purified NK cells were stimulated at 40,000 cells/well in 96 well round bottom plates in the presence of 100ng/mL IL-18 (R&D systems). After 48 h, supernatant was harvested and processed as described for CD8+ T cell IFNγ induction assays.
For IL-12Rβ1 surface staining, mouse p40 (23-335) was cloned into pAcGP67a with N-terminal GP64 signal peptide and C-terminal AviTag and 6xHis tags. Mouse p40 is secreted as a disulfide bonded homodimer. To obtain monomeric p40, Ni-NTA purified protein was reduced with 20mM cysteine and alkylated with 40mM iodoacetamide in HEPES buffered saline (HBS) pH 8.2 followed by SEC. Monomeric p40 was biotinylated with recombinant BirA and purified by a second round of SEC.
For surface staining and cell signaling, spleen and lymph nodes from female C57BL/6J mice were isolated, red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (GIBCO) and single cell suspension was generated. For T cell blasts, single cell suspension was added to plates coated with 2.5 μg/mL αCD3 (145-2c11, BioLegend) in complete RMPI with 5 μg/mL αCD28 (37.51, Bio X Cell), and 100IU/mL recombinant mouse IL-2 for 48 h at 37°C. For cell staining, ex vivo cells and T cell blasts were incubated with TruStain FcX (93, BioLegend) and stained with a phenotyping panel of αCD3 FITC (17A2, eBiosciences), αCD4 PerCP-Cy5.5 (GK1.5, BioLegend), αCD8 BV785 (53-6.7, Biolegend), and αNK1.1 eFluor450 (PK136, eBioscience). Mouse p40 tetramers were prepared by mixing 200nM streptavidin-AF647 with four-fold molar excess of biotinylated p40 and cells were stained for 2 h at 4°C followed by live cell detection using propidium iodide (PI, Invitrogen). Samples were analyzed using CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) followed by analysis in FlowJo (BD). CD8+ T cells were defined as liveCD3+CD8+, CD4+ T cells were gated as liveCD3+CD4+, and NK cells were identified as liveCD3-NK1.1+ ( Figure S4 A).
For in vitro studies, mouse IL-12 was expressed as a single chain with N-terminal p40 (23-335) followed by a 3xGGGS linker, 3C protease site, and IL-12p35 (23-215). Single chain mouse IL-12 was cloned into pAcGP67a with an N-terminal GP64 signal peptide and C-terminal 6xHis tag. Mouse IL-12 variants were expressed in T. ni cells and purified by Ni-NTA and SEC. For cell signaling, mouse T cell blasts were prepared as described above, rested overnight in complete RPMI, stained with αCD8 BV785 (53-6.7, Biolegend) and stimulated for 20 minutes at 37°C with IL-12 variants before fixation, permeabilization, and staining as described for human T cell signaling. For NK cell signaling, NK cells were MACS isolated from spleen and lymph nodes of female C57BL/6J mice using NK cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) and LS magnetic columns (Miltenyi). Purified NK cells were mixed with Cell Trace Violet (CTV, Invitrogen) labeled Expi293F (GIBCO) carrier cells and stimulated with cytokine for 20 minutes before fixation in FixLyse buffer (BD) and permeabilization in Perm Buffer III (BD). Carrier cells were used in these assays to improve cell retention during washing and staining. Cells were stained with anti-STAT4 pY693 AF488 (38/p-Stat4, BD) and analyzed using CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). NK cells were identified as CTV negative.
For western blot analysis, CD8+ T cell blasts were generated as described above. After 48 h activation, CD8+ T cells were isolated by MACS using CD8+ T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi) and LS magnetic columns (Miltenyi). Purified CD8+ T cells were rested overnight in complete RPMI. In the morning, 1x10 6 cells were starved for 1 hour in RPMI without serum and stimulated for 20 minutes with 1 μM cytokine. Cells were washed once in cold PBS and lysed in 100 μL of Pierce IP lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with 1:100 Abcam phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Abcam), 1:100 Halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific), 1:200 Sodium Orthovanadate (NEB) and 1:10 cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysates were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE (BioRad Cat#4561046) and transferred to PVDF membranes using Trans-Blot Turbo transfer kit (BioRad). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour in TBS-T (20mM Tris pH7.4, 150mM NaCl, 0.1% tween 20) containing Blotting-Grade Blocker (BioRad). Primary antibodies against phosphorylated STAT4 (Tyr693, Cell Signaling Technologies) and total STAT4 (C46B10, Cell Signaling Technologies) were detected with swine anti-rabbit HRP (Dako) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent (Cytiva). Blots were developed on Hyperfilm ECL (Cytiva)
For NK cell IFNγ induction assays, NK cells were isolated as described for pSTAT4 signaling. Purified NK cells were stimulated at 25,000 cells/well in a 96 well round bottom plate with 50ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-18 (R&D systems) and IL-12 variants for 48 h at 37°C. In the final four hours of culture, GolgiStop (BD) was added to prevent further cytokine secretion. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD) and stained with αIFNγ AF647 (XMG1.2, BD). Fluorescence intensity was recorded using CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed in FlowJo (BD). Supernatants were assessed for IFNγ using the ELISA MAX Deluxe Set (BioLegend) and Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates (BioLegend).
For transcriptional analysis, MACS isolated NK cells were stimulated with 50ng/mL IL-18 (R&D systems) and 1 μM IL-12 variants for 8 h followed by RNA isolation using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). cDNA was generated using iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR (BioRad). Primer sets for Ifng (Mm.PT.58.41769240), Tigit (Mm.PT.56a.6925849), and Gapdh (Mm.PT.39a.1) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). qPCR was performed using PowerTrack SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). For analysis, Ct values were exported from StepOne Software (Applied Biosystems) and ΔCt was calculated for all samples relative to Gapdh control. ΔΔCt was calculated relative to unstimulated cells and fold change was expressed as 2 -ΔΔCt .
For CD8+ T cell assays, splenocytes from female C57BL/6-Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/j OT-I TCR transgenic mice ( Hogquist et al., 1994 29. Hogquist, K.A. ∙ Jameson, S.C. ∙ Heath, W.R. ... T cell receptor antagonist peptides induce positive selection Cell. 1994; 76 :17-27 Abstract Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2402) PubMed Google Scholar ) were stimulated in complete RPMI containing 1 μg/mL OVA (257-264, GenScript), 0.5 μg/mL αCD28 (37.51, Bio X Cell), 100IU/mL IL-2, and IL-12 variants. For IFNγ induction assays, cells were stimulated for 48 h at 80,000 cells/well in a 96 well round bottom plate. For the final four hours, GolgiStop (BD) was added to prevent further cytokine secretion. Supernatants were analyzed for IFNγ by ELISA as described for NK assays and cells were stained with αCD3 eFluor450 (17A2, eBioscience) and αCD8 BV785 (53-6.7, BioLegend) before being fixed/permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD) and stained with αIFNγ AF647 (XMG1.2, BD). OT-I T cells were gated on CD3+CD8+ cells and αIFNγ AF647 staining was assessed using CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) followed by analysis in FlowJo (BD). For gating see Figure S4 C. For OT-I effectors used in in vitro tumor cell killing assay, OT-I T cells were stimulated as described above for 72 h in 24 well plates. Cells were spun down and supernatant saved.
For MHC-I upregulation, 25,000 B16-F10 melanoma cells (ATCC) were plated on 96 flat bottom plates for 4 h at 37°C prior to exchanging media for OT-I effector supernatants diluted in compete RPMI. After 16 h at 37°C, media was removed and cells were detached using TrypLE (GIBCO). Cells were stained with αH-2K b APC (AF6-88.5, BioLegend) and PI to identify live cells. Data were collected on CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and analyzed in FlowJo (BD).
For antigen-specific tumor cell killing, B16-F10 cells expressing pCDH-EF1-cOVA-T2A-copGFP ( Tseng et al., 2013 72. Tseng, D. ∙ Volkmer, J.P. ∙ Willingham, S.B. ... Anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis of cancer by macrophages primes an effective antitumor T-cell response Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :11103-11108 Crossref Scopus (502) PubMed Google Scholar ) were cultured with wild-type B16-F10 wild-type at a 1:1 ratio and 25,000 cells were plated on a 96 flat bottom plate. After 4 h at 37°C, media was removed and OT-I effectors were added in complete RPMI for 36 h at 37°C. Media was removed and cells were detached using TrypLE (GIBCO) and stained with PI and αCD45.2 APC (104, eBioscience) prior to analysis on CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter). B16-F10 were identified as liveCD45.2- and % GFP+ was quantified as compared to no effector condition.
For Th1 polarization, naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from spleen and lymph nodes of female C57BL/6J mice using Naive CD4+ T cell isolation Kit (Miltenyi) with LS columns (Miltenyi). Naive CD4+ T cells were stimulated at 80,000 cells/well in a 96-well round bottom plates coated with 2 μg/mL αCD3 (145-2c11, BioLegend) in complete RMPI with 0.5 μg/mL αCD28 (37.51, Bio X Cell), 1 μg/mL αIL-4 (11b11, eBioscience), and 5ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-2. After 48 h, cells were re-stimulated in 1 μg/mL Ionomycin (Sigma), 50ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma), and GolgiStop (BD) for 4 h prior to analysis of IFNγ by intracellular cytokine stain as described for NK cells and OT-I T cells.
For in vivo characterization, mouse IL-12p35 (23-215) and p40 (23-335) were cloned into pD649 vector with an N-terminal HA signal peptide. IL-12p35 also included a C-terminal 6xHis tag for Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Mouse IL-12 and variants were expressed in Expi293F cells (GIBCO) by co-transfection of plasmids containing IL-12p35 and p40. IL-12 heterodimer was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by SEC. Endotoxin was removed using High Capacity NoEndo Columns (Protein Ark) and levels were quantified using the LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit (Pierce). All in vivo preparations had < 1U endotoxin/dose.
To assess cell-type bias in vivo , female B6.PL- Thy1 a /CyJ Thy1.1 mice were seeded with 2.5x10 6 CD8+ T cells from female OT-I TCR transgenic mice by retro-orbital transfer. The following day, mice were immunized subcutaneously in the chest with 50 μg OVA (257-264, Genscript) in Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA, BD) and cytokine was administered daily by interperitoneally injection for five days. On day six, mice were sacrificed for analysis of serum IFNγ and cellularity in draining lymph nodes. For analysis of serum cytokine, blood was allowed to clot for 20 minutes at room temperature and samples were spun down at 2,000xg for 10 minutes. Serum was diluted and analysis of IFNγ using ELISA MAX Deluxe Set (BioLegend) and Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates (BioLegend). For cell profiling, a single cell suspension from draining lymph nodes was stained with TruStain FcX (93, BioLegend) and a phenotyping panel of αCD3 PerCP-Cy5.5 (145-2c11, eBioscience), αCD4 PE-Cy7 (GK1.5, eBioscience), αCD8 BV785 (53-6.7, BioLegend), αThy1.2 PE (30-H12, BioLegend), αNK1.1 eFluor450 (PK136, eBioscience), and αNKp46 FITC (29A1.4, eBioscience). For gating, see Figure S7 G. To assess activation by cell surface staining, αLAG-3 AF647 (C9B7W, BioLegend), αPD-1 BV605 (29F.1A12, BioLegend), and αCD25 APC (PC61, BioLegend) were used as indicated.
Female C57BL/6J mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the flank with 5x10 5 MC-38 (Kerafast) in Matrigel (Corning). After 7 days, tumors volumes were calculated as: v = a 2 b/2, where a is minor radius and b is major radius. Mice with tumors between 50-200 mm 3 were randomized to groups and administered daily cytokine injections for 7 days. Measurements of serum IFNγ were performed as described for adoptive transfer and immunization on day 10 following 3 doses of cytokine. Mice were euthanized when tumor volumes reached around 2000 mm 3 , tumors showed profound ulceration, or when animals displayed limited locomotion and were moribund.
For mobility tracking, 30 s movies of individual mice were exported to an image series at 5 frames/second and imported into ImageJ using Fiji ( Schindelin et al., 2012 65. Schindelin, J. ∙ Arganda-Carreras, I. ∙ Frise, E. ... Fiji: an open-source platform for biological-image analysis Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :676-682 Crossref Scopus (40013) PubMed Google Scholar ). Images were converted to 8-bit Grayscale and a threshold was set to identify mice (dark object on light background). Mice were tracked using MTrack2 ( Klopfenstein and Vale, 2004 32. Klopfenstein, D.R. ∙ Vale, R.D. The lipid binding pleckstrin homology domain in UNC-104 kinesin is necessary for synaptic vesicle transport in Caenorhabditis elegans Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15 :3729-3739 Crossref Scopus (106) PubMed Google Scholar ). X, Y positions were plotted in Prism (GraphPad Software) and cumulative displacement was calculated as the sum of the absolute value of ΔX and ΔY for each time point.
SPR data was analyzed using BIAevaluation software (Cytiva). Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo software (BD). qPCR data was analyzed using StepOne Software (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analyses were performed using Prism v8.4 (GraphPad Software). Groups were compared by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test if Brown-Forsythe test indicated no difference in standard deviation between groups and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated the data were normally distributed. Otherwise Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons was performed. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier test and P values from log-rank test were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Holm-Šídák method. In vitro experiments are shown as mean ± standard deviation of duplicate wells. N values for in vivo experiments indicate the number of mice in each condition. All data are representative of two or more independent experiments. Additional information, including n values and number of replicates, can be found in figure legends.
