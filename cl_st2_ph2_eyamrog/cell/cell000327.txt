Title: Antidepressant drugs act by directly binding to TRKB neurotrophin receptors


Abstract: Summary

It is unclear how binding of antidepressant drugs to their targets gives rise to the clinical antidepressant effect. We discovered that the transmembrane domain of tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TRKB), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor that promotes neuronal plasticity and antidepressant responses, has a cholesterol-sensing function that mediates synaptic effects of cholesterol. We then found that both typical and fast-acting antidepressants directly bind to TRKB, thereby facilitating synaptic localization of TRKB and its activation by BDNF. Extensive computational approaches including atomistic molecular dynamics simulations revealed a binding site at the transmembrane region of TRKB dimers. Mutation of the TRKB antidepressant-binding motif impaired cellular, behavioral, and plasticity-promoting responses to antidepressants in vitro and in vivo . We suggest that binding to TRKB and allosteric facilitation of BDNF signaling is the common mechanism for antidepressant action, which may explain why typical antidepressants act slowly and how molecular effects of antidepressants are translated into clinical mood recovery.

Section: Introduction

Several targets for antidepressant (AD) drug action have been identified, but it is not clear how binding to these targets translates into clinical effects. Typical ADs such as tricyclic ADs (TCA), serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), increase the synaptic levels of monoamines by inhibiting their reuptake or metabolism, but it is unclear why their clinical effects are delayed, while the effects on monoamines are fast ( Belmaker and Agam, 2008 11.

Depression Lancet. 2018; 392 :2299-2312 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (308) PubMed Google Scholar ). The rapid AD effect of ketamine (KET) is attributed to inhibition of NMDA-type glutamate receptors ( Abdallah et al., 2015 1. Abdallah, C.G. ∙ Sanacora, G. ∙ Duman, R.S. ...

However, 2R,6R-hydroxynorketamine (R,R-HNK), a KET metabolite with AD-like activity, exhibits low affinity to NMDA receptors, which has called the role of NMDA receptors in the KET action into question ( Zanos et al., 2016 126.

Essentially all ADs, including KET and R,R-HNK, increase the expression and signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) through neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TRKB) ( Autry and Monteggia, 2012 8.

The effects of SSRIs and KET on BDNF signaling have been considered to be indirect, through the inhibition of serotonin transporter (5HTT) and NMDA receptors, respectively. BDNF mimics the effects of ADs in rodents and inhibiting TRKB signaling prevents their behavioral effects ( Duman and Monteggia, 2006 27. Duman, R.S. ∙ Monteggia, L.M.

Neurosci. 2003; 23 :349-357 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Activation of TRKB is a critical mediator of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity ( Park and Poo, 2013 91. Park, H. ∙ Poo, M.-M. Neurotrophin regulation of neural circuit development and function Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14 :7-23 Crossref Scopus (987) PubMed Google Scholar ), and the AD-induced TRKB signaling reactivates a state of juvenile-like plasticity in the adult brain, which has been suggested to underlie the effects of ADs on mood ( Castrén and Antila, 2017 18.

TRKB signaling is bidirectionally linked to brain cholesterol (CHOL) metabolism. BDNF promotes production of CHOL in neurons ( Suzuki et al., 2007 114. Suzuki, S. ∙ Kiyosue, K. ∙ Hazama, S. ...

CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol Science. 2001; 294 :1354-1357 Crossref Scopus (1115) PubMed Google Scholar ), but it does not pass the blood-brain barrier, therefore, neurons are dependent on CHOL synthesized by astrocytes and transported through an ApoE-mediated mechanism ( Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011 95. Pfrieger, F.W. ∙ Ungerer, N. Cholesterol metabolism in neurons and astrocytes Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50 :357-371 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ). Synaptic CHOL levels are low during the embryonic and early postnatal life but strongly increase during the 3 rd postnatal week in mice ( Suzuki et al., 2004 113. Suzuki, S. ∙ Numakawa, T. ∙ Shimazu, K. ... BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J.

Remodeling of the postsynaptic plasma membrane during neural development Mol. Biol.

The responsiveness of TrkB to BDNF and antidepressant drugs is differentially regulated during mouse development PLoS ONE. 2012; 7 :e32869 Crossref Scopus (27) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many ADs interact with phospholipids and accumulate in CHOL-rich membrane domains, such as lipid rafts ( Erb et al., 2016 29. Erb, S.J. ∙ Schappi, J.M. ∙ Rasenick, M.M. Antidepressants Accumulate in Lipid Rafts Independent of Monoamine Transporters to Modulate Redistribution of the G Protein, Gαs J. Biol.

NMDAR-independent, cAMP-dependent antidepressant actions of ketamine Mol. Psychiatry. 2019; 24 :1833-1843 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ).
These data prompted us to investigate the potential interactions between TRKB, CHOL, and ADs. We found that the TRKB transmembrane domain (TMD) senses changes in the cell membrane CHOL levels, and we elucidated its mechanism. Furthermore, we found that different AD drugs directly bind to a site formed by a dimer of TRKB TMDs, thereby facilitating cell surface expression of TRKB and promoting BDNF signaling. These data suggest that direct binding to TRKB and promotion of BDNF-mediated plasticity is a mechanism of action for AD drugs.

Section: Results

CHOL is known to promote neuronal maturation and plasticity, but how it exerts these effects is unclear ( Mauch et al., 2001 76. Mauch, D.H. ∙ Nägler, K. ∙ Schumacher, S. ... CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol Science. 2001; 294 :1354-1357 Crossref Scopus (1115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011 95. Pfrieger, F.W. ∙ Ungerer, N. Cholesterol metabolism in neurons and astrocytes Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50 :357-371 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ). CHOL is proposed to interact with proteins through the so-called CHOL-recognition and alignment consensus (CRAC) domain or its inverted version CARC ( Fantini et al., 2019 33. Fantini, J. ∙ Epand, R.M. ∙ Barrantes, F.J. Cholesterol-Recognition Motifs in Membrane Proteins Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2019; 1135 :3-25 Crossref Scopus (11) PubMed Google Scholar ). We identified a CARC motif in the TRKB transmembrane (TM) region. This sequence is specific to TRKB and is not present in other TRK receptors ( Figure 1 A), suggesting that CHOL might directly interact with TRKB. Indeed, addition of CHOL at 20 μM to the culture media enhanced TRKB phosphorylation (pTRKB) by BDNF (10 ng/mL) in primary cortical neurons ( Figure 1 B). However, at higher concentrations (50–100 μM), CHOL suppressed the effects of BDNF ( Figure 1 B). CHOL promoted the interaction of TRKB, but not of TRKA, with phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) ( Figures S1 A–S1E), a critical mediator of TRKB intracellular signaling ( Minichiello et al., 2002 84. Minichiello, L. ∙ Calella, A.M. ∙ Medina, D.L. ... Mechanism of TrkB-mediated hippocampal long-term potentiation Neuron. 2002; 36 :121-137 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ), and this effect was blocked by beta-cyclodextrin (βCDX), a CHOL-sequestering agent, at a dose that counteracts CHOL effects ( Figures 1 C and S1 F). Microscale thermophoresis (MST) ( Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2014 48. Jerabek-Willemsen, M. ∙ André, T. ∙ Wanner, R. ... MicroScale Thermophoresis: Interaction analysis and beyond J. Mol. Struct. 2014; 1077 :101-113 Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar ) experiments demonstrated that CHOL (10–100 μM) directly interacts with GFP-TRKB in HEK293T cell lysates with an affinity of ∼20 μM ( Figure 1 E).
TRKB mostly resides in intracellular vesicles not accessible to BDNF ( Du et al., 2000 26. Du, J. ∙ Feng, L. ∙ Yang, F. ...

Depolarization and cAMP elevation rapidly recruit TrkB to the plasma membrane of CNS neurons Neuron. 1998; 21 :681-693 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (427) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that CHOL treatment increased cell surface translocation of TRKB ( Figure S1 C). The effects of BDNF on TRKB-PLC-γ1 interaction ( Figure 1 D) and on the neurite branching in cultured neurons ( Figures S1 G–S1K) were prevented by a CHOL synthesis inhibitor pravastatin (1 μM/3 days), as reported previously ( Suzuki et al., 2004 113. Suzuki, S. ∙ Numakawa, T. ∙ Shimazu, K. ... BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). At 2 μM for 5 days, pravastatin reduced neuronal survival that was rescued by CHOL (20 μM), but not by BDNF ( Figures S1 L and S1M).
Mutation of TRKB tyrosine 433, a predicted key residue in the CARC motif ( Fantini and Barrantes, 2013 32. Fantini, J. ∙ Barrantes, F.J. How cholesterol interacts with membrane proteins: an exploration of cholesterol-binding sites including CRAC, CARC, and tilted domains Front. Physiol. 2013; 4 :31 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ) to phenylalanine (TRKB.Y433F), did not influence the binding affinity of BDNF (TRKB.wt = 3.1 pM; TRKB.Y433F = 2.9 pM) ( Figure S2 A), but it compromised CHOL sensing of TRKB ( Figure 1 E) and reduced the BDNF-induced increase in the phosphorylation of TRKB at the PLC-γ1 interaction site Y816, but not at Y515 ( Figures S2 B and S2C). Split luciferase protein complementation assay ( Merezhko et al., 2020 79. Merezhko, M. ∙ Pakarinen, E. ∙ Uronen, R.-L. ... Live-cell monitoring of protein localization to membrane rafts using protein-fragment complementation Biosci. Rep. 2020; 40 BSR20191290 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) indicated that although Y433F mutation did not influence the basal TRKB dimerization, it compromised BDNF-induced increase in TRKB dimerization ( Figure S2 D). Furthermore, BDNF-induced translocation of TRKB.Y433F to lipid rafts ( Figure S2 F) and its interaction with the raft-restricted FYN ( Pereira and Chao, 2007 94. Pereira, D.B. ∙ Chao, M.V. The tyrosine kinase Fyn determines the localization of TrkB receptors in lipid rafts J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :4859-4869 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ) was reduced when compared to the wild-type TRKB ( Figure S2 E). These data indicate that the Y433 in the TRKB CARC domain is important for BDNF-induced translocation of TRKB to lipid-raft regions on the neuronal surface, thereby promoting BDNF signaling.
We next used atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the organization of TRKB TMD dimers ( Table S1 ). Using a docking algorithm, we modeled five TMD dimer structures to initiate MD simulations, which showed that only one of them is stable in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer with 20–40 mol % CHOL. The stable structure features a cross-like conformation, where the two TMD helices interact at 439 AXXXG 443 ( Figures 1 G–1I), a GXXXG-like dimerization motif ( Figure 1 G) ( Li et al., 2012 67. Li, E. ∙ Wimley, W.C. ∙ Hristova, K. Transmembrane helix dimerization: beyond the search for sequence motifs Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1818 :183-193 Crossref Scopus (100) PubMed Google Scholar ; Senes et al., 2004 109. Senes, A. ∙ Engel, D.E. ∙ DeGrado, W.F. Folding of helical membrane proteins: the role of polar, GxxxG-like and proline motifs Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14 :465-479 Crossref Scopus (336) PubMed Google Scholar ). A similar cross-like conformation was proposed for the EGF receptor, where the distance between the C-termini of TMDs determines EGF signaling ( Arkhipov et al., 2013 7.

Biol. 2018; 25 :857-870.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The average distance between the C termini of TRKB TMDs at CHOL concentrations of 0, 20, and 40 mol% was 19.4 Å, 14.3 Å, and 12.4 Å, respectively ( Figure S3 A).
Additional simulations revealed that the conformation of TRKB TMD dimers is sensitive to CHOL. As the fixed-length hydrophobic TMD helices reduce their tilt to match the thicker membrane at higher CHOL concentration, the stable cross-like dimer conformation seen at 20 mol% CHOL switched to a more parallel conformation at 40 mol% ( Figures 1 H and 1I). The Y433F mutation induced a 40° rotation of the TMD helices relative to each other ( Figure 1 J). This compromises the contact at the 439 AXXXG 443 motif and reduces the C-terminal distance of the TMDs ( Figures S3 A and S3B). In TRKA, which has no CARC or GXXXG-like domains, different CHOL concentrations did not influence the TMD dimer conformation ( Figure S3 C). These findings are consistent with our experimental data showing an optimal CHOL concentration for TKRB function ( Figure 1 B), which is compromised as the TMD helices are separated at the C terminus at low CHOL concentration and adopt an unstable parallel TM orientation at high CHOL concentration ( Figure S3 A).
Essentially all ADs promote TRKB signaling in rodents and this signaling is required for their behavioral effects ( Castrén and Antila, 2017 18. Castrén, E. ∙ Antila, H.

Neurosci. 2003; 23 :349-357 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Many AD drugs are cationic amphipathic molecules that interact with phospholipids and accumulate at the lipid rafts ( Chen et al., 2012 19. Chen, J. ∙ Korostyshevsky, D. ∙ Lee, S. ...

Psychiatry. 2019; 24 :1833-1843 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ). We found that fluoxetine (FLX) and KET enhanced pTRKB at Y816 ( Figure 2 A) and FLX increased the surface expression of TRKB in primary cortical neurons ( Figure 1 F). FLX, imipramine, KET, and R,R-HNK increased TRKB interaction with PLC-γ1 and their effects were blocked by βCDX ( Figures 1 C and S1 N–S1Q), which indicates that CHOL modulates AD-induced TRKB signaling. FLX partially rescued the reduction in BDNF-induced pTRKB response observed under high-CHOL ( Figure 2 B), suggesting that ADs promote TRKB signaling particularly in synaptic-like membranes rich in CHOL.
We then tested if ADs directly bind to TRKB. First, we found that biotinylated FLX binds to immunoprecipitated TRKB with a low μM affinity (K d = 2.42 μM) ( Figure 2 C), but not to TRKA or lysates from non-transfected cells ( Figures S4 L and S4M). Although the affinity of FLX to serotonin transporter (5HTT) is much higher than that to TRKB, micromolar affinity corresponds well to the concentrations of ADs reached in the human brain during chronic treatment ( Bolo et al., 2000 15.

Karson, C.N. ∙ Newton, J.E. ∙ Livingston, R. ... Human brain fluoxetine concentrations J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1993; 5 :322-329 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of biotinylated FLX (1 μM) to TRKB was displaced by unlabeled FLX (K i = 1.69 μM) ( Figure S4 B), indicating specific binding. A deletion construct without most of the extracellular and intracellular domains of TRKB except for the TMD and short juxtamembrane sequences (TRKB.T1ΔEC) ( Haapasalo et al., 1999 38. Haapasalo, A. ∙ Saarelainen, T. ∙ Moshnyakov, M. ... Expression of the naturally occurring truncated trkB neurotrophin receptor induces outgrowth of filopodia and processes in neuroblastoma cells Oncogene. 1999; 18 :1285-1296 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) also demonstrated robust binding ( Figure S4 N), whereas FLX failed to bind to a chimeric TRKB with the TMD of TRKA ( Figure 2 D), which focuses the binding activity to the TRKB TMD.
Binding of FLX to TRKB was also observed in intact cells using in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA). A robust PLA signal was observed when N2A cells transfected to express TRKB were exposed to biotinylated FLX ( Figures 2 J and S5 E–S5G), confirming a close proximity of bound FLX to TRKB. No signal was observed with FLX in control cells lacking TRKB ( Figures 2 K and S5 B–S5D).
To verify the direct interaction between FLX and TRKB, we used MST assay ( Jerabek-Willemsen et al., 2014 48. Jerabek-Willemsen, M. ∙ André, T. ∙ Wanner, R. ... MicroScale Thermophoresis: Interaction analysis and beyond J. Mol. Struct. 2014; 1077 :101-113 Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar ) that detects ligand-receptor binding directly in cell lysates ( Welsch et al., 2017 122. Welsch, M.E. ∙ Kaplan, A. ∙ Chambers, J.M. ... Multivalent Small-Molecule Pan-RAS Inhibitors Cell. 2017; 168 :878-889.e29 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (116) PubMed Google Scholar ). This assay confirmed that unlabeled FLX directly binds to GFP-tagged TRKB in lysates of transfected HEK293T cells ( Figure 2 L).
We further found that tritiated imipramine binds to TRKB at micromolar affinity (K d = 1.43 μM) ( Figure 2 F), similar to that seen with FLX. Binding of biotinylated FLX (1 μM) to TRKB was displaced by imipramine, venlafaxine, moclobemide, KET, esketamine, and R,R-HNK with K i of 1.03, 2.08, 1.51, 12.30, 2.86, and 2.23 μM, respectively ( Figures 2 G and S4 C–S4G). By contrast, control compounds isoproterenol, chlorpromazine, diphenhydramine, and 2S,6S-HNK that are structurally and physico-chemically similar to ADs, produced weak, if any, displacement of biotinylated FLX ( Figures S4 H and S4I). BDNF failed to displace FLX from TRKB ( Figure S4 J), which is consistent with different interaction sites.
The finding that KET and R,R-HNK compete with FLX indicates that not only the typical but also the novel rapid-acting ADs bind to TRKB. Remarkably, R,R-HNK clearly binds to TRKB (K d = 1.82 μM) ( Figure 2 E), and S,S-HNK failed to displace bound R,R,-HNK, indicating that AD binding to TRKB is stereoselective ( Figure S4 K). R,R-HNK produces AD-like effects in rodents at concentrations that do not inhibit NMDA receptors, the proposed primary interaction site for rapid-acting ADs ( Zanos et al., 2016 126. Zanos, P. ∙ Moaddel, R. ∙ Morris, P.J. ... NMDAR inhibition-independent antidepressant actions of ketamine metabolites Nature. 2016; 533 :481-486 Crossref Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar , 2018 127. Zanos, P. ∙ Moaddel, R. ∙ Morris, P.J. ... Ketamine and Ketamine Metabolite Pharmacology: Insights into Therapeutic Mechanisms Pharmacol. Rev. 2018; 70 :621-660 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ), but no alternative binding site for R,R-HNK that could explain its AD-like effects has been identified. Our finding suggests that TRKB might be this elusive direct target for R,R-HNK. CHOL did not compete with FLX or R,R-HNK, but increased the interaction of these compounds with TRKB, suggesting the presence of two distinct and cooperative recognition mechanisms for CHOL and ADs ( Figures 2 H and 2I).
These acute effects of ADs are not mediated by functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA) or sphingolipid metabolism ( Kornhuber et al., 2010 63. Kornhuber, J. ∙ Tripal, P. ∙ Reichel, M. ... Functional Inhibitors of Acid Sphingomyelinase (FIASMAs): a novel pharmacological group of drugs with broad clinical applications Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2010; 26 :9-20 Crossref Scopus (187) PubMed Google Scholar ), because FIASMA compounds chlorpromazine, pimozide, and flupenthixol failed to rescue BDNF-induced activation of TRKB under high concentrations of CHOL, as FLX does ( Figures 2 B and S2 H). Further, chlorpromazine failed to displace FLX binding to TRKB ( Figure S4 I), whereas non-FIASMA ADs venlafaxine, KET, and R,R-HNK readily displaced FLX ( Figures S4 E–S4G). Together, these results suggest that all of the investigated ADs directly bind to TRKB at clinically meaningful concentrations ( Bolo et al., 2000 15. Bolo, N.R. ∙ Hodé, Y. ∙ Nédélec, J.F. ...

Docking followed by an extensive set of 120 1-μs-long MD simulations suggested a binding site and mode for FLX in the crevice facing the extracellular side of the crossed TRKB TMD dimer ( Figure 3 A). This binding site and mode engages both TMDs in the dimer and also recruits phospholipids, which can further stabilize the binding ( Figure 3 B). The simulations also revealed several protein residues important for binding, including Y433, V437, and S440 ( Figures 3 A, 3C, and 3D). Mutagenesis experimentally verified this binding site: FLX binding to TRKB.Y433F and TRKB.V437A was essentially lost, and binding to TRKB.S440A was significantly reduced ( Figures 2 C and S4 O). Furthermore, binding of FLX to a chimeric TRKB carrying TMD from TRKA (TRKB/TRKA.TM) was very low, and the affinity of imipramine and R,R-HNK to TRKB.Y433F was also much lower than to the wild-type TRKB ( Figures 2 D–2F).
As shown above, the stable configuration of TRKB TM dimers at 20 mol % of CHOL is destabilized by increased membrane thickness at 40 mol % of CHOL ( Figure 1 G,H). Remarkably, at 40 mol %, FLX binding maintained the active configuration of TRKB dimers close to that observed in 20 mol % ( Figure 3 E), which is consistent with our biochemical observation that FLX preferentially acts under high CHOL conditions ( Figure 2 B). Following drug expulsion, the dimers transitioned to the more parallel conformation seen in Figure 1 I. Protein-free simulations with varying CHOL concentrations showed that interaction of ADs with membrane lipids alone does not explain the observed drug binding, because neither FLX, R,R-HNK, nor esketamine altered the order parameters of the membrane lipids (systems 21–50 in Table S1 ). The Y433F mutation decreased the residence-time of FLX by at least 4-fold, to 161 ns when compared to the >696 ns for the wild-type protein, consistent with a low binding affinity of FLX to TRKB.Y433F ( Figure 2 C). Accordingly, Y433 is directly involved in FLX binding and indirectly involved in CHOL sensing via membrane thickness. The other mutations (V437A, S440A; Table S1 , systems 12–14) also substantially decreased the FLX residence-time and binding affinity ( Figure S4 O). Together, these data suggest that FLX, by binding to the dimeric TRKB interface, acts like a wedge and stabilizes the cross-shaped active conformation at high CHOL concentration typically present in synaptic membranes ( Figures 3 A and 3E).
We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay in primary hippocampal neurons (DIV14) to evaluate the mobility of TRKB in neuronal spines. In neurons transfected to express GFP-tagged TRKB, the fluorescence was rapidly recovered in dendritic shafts, but not in spines after bleaching ( Figures 4 A and S6 A). Pretreatment with BDNF (20 ng/mL/15 min) brought about a rapid recovery of GFP-TRKB fluorescence in spines after bleaching, indicating TRKB trafficking to spines ( Figures 4 B and 4E). Similarly, pretreatment of neurons with FLX (1 μM/15 min) or KET (10 μM/15 min) also promoted recovery of GFP-TRKB fluorescence in dendritic spines ( Figures 4 C, 4D, 4F, 4G, and S6 A) without any additional effect on dendritic shafts. Neither BDNF, FLX, nor KET increased the fluorescence of GFP-TRKB.Y433F mutant receptors in dendritic spines after bleaching ( Figures 4 H–4J), although the localization of GFP-TRKB.Y433F before bleaching was identical to the wild-type GFP-TRKB. These data demonstrate that BDNF, FLX, and KET promote TRKB trafficking in dendritic spines, and this effect is disrupted in TRKB.Y433F mutants.
Super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM/TIRF) revealed that BDNF, FLX, KET, and CHOL all increased the size of clusters formed by wild-type GFP-TRKB, but not clusters of GFP-TRKB.Y433F mutants at the plasma membrane of fibroblast cell line, indicating that the increased trafficking may lead to increased cell surface expression and clustering of TRKB ( Figures 4 K–4P). The basal cell surface expression of GFP-TRKB.Y433F was again similar to that of the wild-type TRKB ( Figures 4 K, 4M, and 4O).
ADs are known to increase the cell surface expression of AMPA glutamate receptors and the blockade of AMPA receptors prevents the behavioral effects of KET and R,R-HNK ( Maeng et al., 2008 72. Maeng, S. ∙ Zarate, Jr., C.A. ∙ Du, J. ... Cellular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine: role of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors Biol.

NMDAR inhibition-independent antidepressant actions of ketamine metabolites Nature. 2016; 533 :481-486 Crossref Scopus (684) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that FLX and R,R-HNK increased cell surface localization of GluR1 subunits of AMPA receptors, and this effect was prevented by the TRKB inhibitors ANA12 and k252a ( Figures S6 B and S6C) and in neurons from TRKB.Y433F mutant mice ( Figures S6 D and S6E). These data suggest that the effect of ADs on synaptic AMPA receptor surface exposure is a downstream effect of TRKB activation by these drugs.
BDNF is a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity and is required for long-term potentiation (LTP) in slices as well as in vivo , and these effects are mediated by TRKB ( Ernfors and Bramham, 2003 30.

BDNF mechanisms in late LTP formation: A synthesis and breakdown Neuropharmacology. 2014; 76 :664-676 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). Theta-burst stimulation reliably induced an LTP in the CA3-CA1 synapses in slices derived from wild-type mice. Remarkably, similar stimulation of slices derived from heterozygous mice carrying a TRKB.Y433F mutation (TRKB.Y433F mice) failed to induce any significant potentiation ( Figure S6 F). However, tetanic stimulation induced LTP in both wild-type and TRKB.Y433F slices ( Figure S6 G), consistent with the central role of BDNF in theta-burst-mediated LTP ( Kang et al., 1997 54.

Infusion of BDNF into the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats significantly increased synaptic strength, as previously reported ( Messaoudi et al., 2002 81. Messaoudi, E. ∙ Ying, S.-W. ∙ Kanhema, T. ... Brain-derived neurotrophic factor triggers transcription-dependent, late phase long-term potentiation in vivo J.

BDNF mechanisms in late LTP formation: A synthesis and breakdown Neuropharmacology. 2014; 76 :664-676 Crossref Scopus (174) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, this effect of BDNF was partially prevented when rats were co-treated with pravastatin (10 mg/kg/day/14 days) ( Figure 5 A), suggesting that neuronal CHOL is required for the effects of BDNF on LTP.
ADs increase the proliferation and survival of newly born dentate granule neurons ( Malberg et al., 2000 73. Malberg, J.E. ∙ Eisch, A.J. ∙ Nestler, E.J. ...

Requirement of hippocampal neurogenesis for the behavioral effects of antidepressants Science. 2003; 301 :805-809 Crossref Scopus (3306) PubMed Google Scholar ). We confirmed that FLX (15 mg/kg/day, leading to FLX brain concentration of 31.9 ± 5.9 μM) ( Table S2 ) significantly increased survival of newborn hippocampal neurons in wild-type mice, however, no increase was observed in the dentate gyrus of TRKB.Y433F mice ( Figure 5 B).
Chronic FLX treatment reactivates critical period-like plasticity in the visual cortex of adult mice, allowing an ocular dominance (OD) shift in response to monocular deprivation, which normally only happens during a developmental critical period ( Maya Vetencourt et al., 2008 77. Maya Vetencourt, J.F. ∙ Sale, A. ∙ Viegi, A. ... The antidepressant fluoxetine restores plasticity in the adult visual cortex Science. 2008; 320 :385-388 Crossref Scopus (606) PubMed Google Scholar ; Steinzeig et al., 2017 112. Steinzeig, A. ∙ Molotkov, D. ∙ Castrén, E. Chronic imaging through “transparent skull” in mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0181788 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). In mice treated with FLX for 4 weeks (10 mg/kg/day), a 7-day monocular deprivation during the last treatment week induced a dramatic shift in OD in favor of the open eye ( Figure 5 C). We now show that both KET and R,R-HNK (both 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) also induced a significant shift in OD, but a much shorter treatment was needed than that for FLX ( Figure 5 C), consistent with their fast action. The response to R,R-HNK was comparable to that produced by FLX, however, the magnitude of response to KET was lower than that to FLX and R,R-HNK. Remarkably, the effect of FLX and R,R-HNK on the shift in ocular dominance was lost in TRKB.Y433F mice ( Figures 5 D and 5E) and in wild-type mice co-treated with pravastatin ( Figures 5 F and 5G), indicating that the plasticity-inducing effects of ADs may be mediated by their direct binding to TRKB.
We next investigated whether AD interaction with TRKB influences neuronal plasticity-dependent learning and behavior. FLX (15 mg/kg/day) for 7 days facilitated long-term memory in object location memory (OLM) test in TRKB.wt mice, but not in TRKB.Y433F mice, although the behavior of vehicle-treated TRKB.Y433F mice was similar to their vehicle-treated wild-type littermates ( Figure 6 A). A similar lack of response to FLX was observed in BDNF haploinsufficient mice ( Figure S6 J) and in animals co-treated with pravastatin ( Figures 6 B and 6C). Remarkably, serotonin transporter knockout (5HTT.ko) mice lacking the primary site of action of SSRIs responded to FLX treatment normally in the OLM test ( Figure S6 K), indicating that the effects of FLX in this test are not mediated by inhibition of serotonin transport. This is consistent with the findings that the biochemical, behavioral, and electrophysiological effects of SSRIs are preserved in 5HTT.ko mice ( Normann et al., 2018 88. Normann, C. ∙ Frase, S. ∙ Haug, V. ... Antidepressants Rescue Stress-Induced Disruption of Synaptic Plasticity via Serotonin Transporter-Independent Inhibition of L-Type Calcium Channels Biol.

Antidepressant drugs transactivate TrkB neurotrophin receptors in the adult rodent brain independently of BDNF and monoamine transporter blockade PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e20567 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, a recent study found that behavioral effects of FLX are lost in mice with a point mutation in 5HTT that impairs the response to AD drugs ( Nackenoff et al., 2016 86. Nackenoff, A.G. ∙ Moussa-Tooks, A.B. ∙ McMeekin, A.M. ...

Activation of the TrkB neurotrophin receptor is induced by antidepressant drugs and is required for antidepressant-induced behavioral effects J. Neurosci. 2003; 23 :349-357 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). FLX (15 mg/kg, for 21 days) and KET (10 mg/kg i.p., 2 h before) significantly reduced immobility in the FST in wild-type mice, but both drugs were ineffective in TRKB.Y433F mice ( Figures 6 D and 6E).
FLX promotes extinction of conditioned fear in a BDNF-dependent manner ( Andero and Ressler, 2012 5. Andero, R. ∙ Ressler, K.J.

Fear erasure in mice requires synergy between antidepressant drugs and extinction training Science. 2011; 334 :1731-1734 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). The freezing response was indistinguishable between the genotypes immediately after conditioning ( Figures 6 G and 6H). FLX (15 mg/kg for 2 weeks, starting immediately after conditioning) and KET (10 mg/kg i.p., immediately after conditioning and 2 h before each extinction trial) promoted extinction of conditioned fear in wild-type mice ( Figures 6 G and 6H), but no increase in fear extinction was seen in FLX- or KET-treated TRKB.Y433F mice ( Figures 6 G and 6H) or in pravastatin-FLX co-treated mice ( Figure 6 F).
Together, these data demonstrate that the behavioral effects produced by different ADs were lost in TRKB.Y433F mutant mice, consistently with AD binding to TRKB. Moreover, we observed that many of these behavioral effects were also lost when ADs were co-administered with pravastatin ( Figures 6 B, 6C, and 6F), supporting the notion that CHOL sensing is necessary for the behavioral effects of BDNF on TRKB signaling.

Section: Discussion

BDNF signaling is crucial for the action of essentially all AD drugs ( Autry and Monteggia, 2012 8. Autry, A.E. ∙ Monteggia, L.M.

Psychiatry. 2006; 59 :1116-1127 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (2359) PubMed Google Scholar ), but this effect has been assumed to be indirectly mediated by other proteins such as 5HTT or NMDA receptors. We now show that ADs bind to the TMD of TRKB dimers with a therapeutically relevant affinity ( Bolo et al., 2000 15. Bolo, N.R. ∙ Hodé, Y. ∙ Nédélec, J.F. ... Brain pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in vivo of fluvoxamine and fluoxetine by fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23 :428-438 Crossref Scopus (125) PubMed Google Scholar ; Karson et al., 1993 56. Karson, C.N. ∙ Newton, J.E. ∙ Livingston, R. ... Human brain fluoxetine concentrations J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1993; 5 :322-329 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ), stabilizing a conformation of the TRKB TM dimers favorable for signaling, thereby promoting TRKB translocation to and retention at the plasma membrane, where it is accessible to BDNF. Specific binding was observed not only for FLX and imipramine, representing typical SSRI and TCAs, respectively, but also for the rapid-acting KET metabolite RR-HNK. Binding of labeled FLX was displaced by FLX itself and by imipramine, moclobemide, RR-HNK, KET, and esketamine, which suggests that these drugs bind to at least partially overlapping sites. These data suggest that direct interaction with the TMDs of TRKB dimer may function as a binding site for several different, if not all, ADs.
MD simulations identified a binding site for FLX at the outer opening of the crossed dimer of TRKB TMDs. Several mutations predicted by and tested in MD were used in experimental mutagenesis, which confirmed the binding site. Our data suggest that in thick CHOL-rich membranes, typically found in synapses and lipid rafts, dimers of TRKB TMDs assume a near-parallel, presumably unstable position, which leads to the exclusion of TRKB from synaptic membranes and limits synaptic TRKB signaling ( Pereira and Chao, 2007 94.

BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ). Binding of FLX to a site formed by the crossed TMDs acts as a wedge, maintaining a more stable structure in synaptic membranes, thereby allosterically facilitating synaptic BDNF signaling. Simulations predict that membrane lipids also participate in FLX binding to TRKB. Because TRKB exists as a multi-protein complex that also includes transmembrane proteins ( Fred et al., 2019 35. Fred, S.M. ∙ Laukkanen, L. ∙ Brunello, C.A. ... Pharmacologically diverse antidepressants facilitate TRKB receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 J.

Chondroitinase and antidepressants promote plasticity by releasing TRKB from dephosphorylating control of PTPσ in parvalbumin neurons J. Neurosci. 2020; Published online December 8, 2020 Crossref Scopus (1) PubMed Google Scholar ), it is possible that other proteins and lipids participate in AD binding to TRKB in cell-type- and subcellular compartment-dependent manner. Further characterization of this binding site may yield important information for discovery of new ADs with increased potency for plasticity-related behavioral effects.
It has been known for decades that the clinical response to typical ADs is only reached after several days or weeks of treatment, but the reason for this delay has remained a mystery. One explanation has been that the process of neuronal plasticity induced by ADs may take time to develop. However, the discovery of the rapid action of KET, which is also dependent on plasticity, has undermined this explanation. FLX and imipramine bind to 5HTT with a much higher affinity than to TRKB, while the affinity of KET to TRKB is comparable to its affinity to NMDA receptors ( Zanos et al., 2018 127. Zanos, P. ∙ Moaddel, R. ∙ Morris, P.J. ... Ketamine and Ketamine Metabolite Pharmacology: Insights into Therapeutic Mechanisms Pharmacol. Rev. 2018; 70 :621-660 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ). Remarkably, micromolar concentrations of typical ADs are reached and required in the brain during chronic treatment, as shown in humans for FLX ( Bolo et al., 2000 15.

Psychiatry. 2000; 157 :1506-1508 Crossref Scopus (47) PubMed Google Scholar ) and here for FLX in mice. Importantly, typical ADs gradually accumulate in the brain, reaching a plateau after several weeks of treatment ( Karson et al., 1993 56. Karson, C.N. ∙ Newton, J.E. ∙ Livingston, R. ... Human brain fluoxetine concentrations J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1993; 5 :322-329 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Kornhuber et al., 1995 62. Kornhuber, J. ∙ Retz, W. ∙ Riederer, P. Slow accumulation of psychotropic substances in the human brain. Relationship to therapeutic latency of neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs? J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1995; 46 :315-323 PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the clinical response is only achieved when the drug reaches a brain concentration high enough to interact with a low-affinity binding target, such as TRKB. Sufficient concentrations may not be reached in fast metabolizers or patients with limited compliance, which may contribute to the failure to respond. KET, on the other hand, readily penetrates to the brain to achieve sufficient synaptic concentrations quickly. Therefore, the gradual increase in brain concentration to a level needed for TRKB binding might be at least one explanation for why typical ADs take so long to act, while the rapid brain penetration of KET enables fast action. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that effects on TRKB mediate all the effects of ADs and that inhibition of 5HTT and NMDA receptors also play a role ( Harmer et al., 2017 40.

AD binding detected here is clearly distinct from that amitriptyline binding, as it includes many different ADs, it is specific to TRKB, and TRKB construct including the TMD but lacking the reported amitriptyline binding site in the first leucine-rich repeat readily binds FLX.
Our findings imply that high doses of statins might interfere with the AD response. A recent study indicates more depression and more AD use among statin users ( Köhler-Forsberg et al., 2019 60. Köhler-Forsberg, O. ∙ Gasse, C. ∙ Petersen, L. ... Statin treatment and the risk of depression J. Affect. Disord. 2019; 246 :706-715 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ), but meta-analyses have found, if anything, less depression among statin users ( Yatham et al., 2019 125. Yatham, M.S. ∙ Yatham, K.S. ∙ Ravindran, A.V. ... Do statins have an effect on depressive symptoms? A systematic review and meta-analysis J. Affect. Disord. 2019; 257 :55-63 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (12) PubMed Google Scholar ). This discrepancy to our rodent findings is likely related to the high statin dose used in our studies. Interestingly, serum CHOL levels have been found to be low in suicidal patients ( Kim and Myint, 2004 57. Kim, Y.-K. ∙ Myint, A.-M. Clinical application of low serum cholesterol as an indicator for suicide risk in major depression J. Affect. Disord. 2004; 81 :161-166 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Due to the effects of TRKB on neuronal survival and plasticity, small-molecule agonists of TRKB have been actively searched ( Longo and Massa, 2013 71. Longo, F.M. ∙ Massa, S.M. Small-molecule modulation of neurotrophin receptors: a strategy for the treatment of neurological disease Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12 :507-525 Crossref Scopus (165) PubMed Google Scholar ; Saragovi et al., 2019 107. Saragovi, H.U. ∙ Galan, A. ∙ Levin, L.A. Neuroprotection: Pro-survival and Anti-neurotoxic Mechanisms as Therapeutic Strategies in Neurodegeneration Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2019; 13 :231 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data show that ADs bind to TRKB and allosterically potentiate BDNF signaling, thereby maintaining use-dependency, which limits the action of TRKB selectively to active synapses that release BDNF, avoiding undesirable stabilization of inactive synapses in a way full TRKB agonists may do. This action of ADs as “smart drugs” is consistent with the wide utility of these drugs in many neurological and psychiatric disorders beyond depression ( Schneider et al., 2019 108. Schneider, J. ∙ Patterson, M. ∙ Jimenez, X.F. Beyond depression: Other uses for tricyclic antidepressants Cleve. Clin. J. Med. 2019; 86 :807-814 Crossref Scopus (3) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Astrocyte-derived CHOL has been recognized as an important regulator of neuronal maturation and plasticity ( Martin et al., 2014 75. Martin, M.G. ∙ Ahmed, T. ∙ Korovaichuk, A. ... Constitutive hippocampal cholesterol loss underlies poor cognition in old rodents EMBO Mol. Med. 2014; 6 :902-917 Crossref Scopus (42) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mauch et al., 2001 76. Mauch, D.H. ∙ Nägler, K. ∙ Schumacher, S. ... CNS synaptogenesis promoted by glia-derived cholesterol Science. 2001; 294 :1354-1357 Crossref Scopus (1115) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pfrieger and Ungerer, 2011 95. Pfrieger, F.W. ∙ Ungerer, N. Cholesterol metabolism in neurons and astrocytes Prog. Lipid Res. 2011; 50 :357-371 Crossref Scopus (224) PubMed Google Scholar ), but the mechanisms through which CHOL acts to produce these effects have remained unclear. Here, we have demonstrated that TRKB TMD possesses a CARC domain ( Fantini and Barrantes, 2013 32. Fantini, J. ∙ Barrantes, F.J. How cholesterol interacts with membrane proteins: an exploration of cholesterol-binding sites including CRAC, CARC, and tilted domains Front. Physiol. 2013; 4 :31 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ), and CHOL potentiates the effects of BDNF on TRKB signaling.
CHOL regulates BDNF signaling ( Pereira and Chao, 2007 94. Pereira, D.B. ∙ Chao, M.V. The tyrosine kinase Fyn determines the localization of TrkB receptors in lipid rafts J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :4859-4869 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2004 113. Suzuki, S. ∙ Numakawa, T. ∙ Shimazu, K. ... BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zonta and Minichiello, 2013 131. Zonta, B. ∙ Minichiello, L. Synaptic membrane rafts: traffic lights for local neurotrophin signaling? Front. Synaptic Neurosci. 2013; 5 :9 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ), and BDNF, in turn, promotes neuronal CHOL synthesis ( Suzuki et al., 2007 114. Suzuki, S. ∙ Kiyosue, K. ∙ Hazama, S. ... Brain-derived neurotrophic factor regulates cholesterol metabolism for synapse development J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :6417-6427 Crossref Scopus (107) PubMed Google Scholar ). Synaptic membranes are enriched in CHOL and resemble CHOL-rich lipid rafts ( Ikonen, 2008 45. Ikonen, E. Cellular cholesterol trafficking and compartmentalization Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9 :125-138 Crossref Scopus (824) PubMed Google Scholar ). TRKB normally resides outside rafts but can transiently translocate to rafts upon BDNF stimulation ( Pereira and Chao, 2007 94. Pereira, D.B. ∙ Chao, M.V. The tyrosine kinase Fyn determines the localization of TrkB receptors in lipid rafts J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :4859-4869 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2004 113. Suzuki, S. ∙ Numakawa, T. ∙ Shimazu, K. ... BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), as also observed here. This translocation may be related to our observation of TRKB trafficking to dendritic spines and clustering on the plasma membrane, both of which were stimulated by BDNF and ADs. TRKB residence in lipid rafts is short-lived ( Pereira and Chao, 2007 94. Pereira, D.B. ∙ Chao, M.V. The tyrosine kinase Fyn determines the localization of TrkB receptors in lipid rafts J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :4859-4869 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2004 113. Suzuki, S. ∙ Numakawa, T. ∙ Shimazu, K. ... BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), which may be explained by our simulation data suggesting instability of the crossed TRKB TMD structure in thick CHOL-rich membranes. Translocation of TRKB to rafts is dependent on FYN kinase ( Pereira and Chao, 2007 94. Pereira, D.B. ∙ Chao, M.V. The tyrosine kinase Fyn determines the localization of TrkB receptors in lipid rafts J. Neurosci. 2007; 27 :4859-4869 Crossref Scopus (75) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2004 113. Suzuki, S. ∙ Numakawa, T. ∙ Shimazu, K. ... BDNF-induced recruitment of TrkB receptor into neuronal lipid rafts: roles in synaptic modulation J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167 :1205-1215 Crossref Scopus (135) PubMed Google Scholar ), and we observed that BDNF increases interaction of FYN with wild-type TRKB, but not with the TRKB.Y433F mutant cells. These data suggest a scenario where the interaction between TRKB and BDNF or ADs promotes its retention in CHOL-rich synaptic membranes.
Our simulation data predict that TMDs of TRKB interact at 439 AXXXG 443 dimerization motif, and suggest that, analogous to the EGF receptor ( Arkhipov et al., 2013 7. Arkhipov, A. ∙ Shan, Y. ∙ Das, R. ... Architecture and membrane interactions of the EGF receptor Cell. 2013; 152 :557-569 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (297) PubMed Google Scholar ; Endres et al., 2013 28. Endres, N.F. ∙ Das, R. ∙ Smith, A.W. ... Conformational coupling across the plasma membrane in activation of the EGF receptor Cell. 2013; 152 :543-556 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (298) PubMed Google Scholar ; Sinclair et al., 2018 111. Sinclair, J.K.L. ∙ Walker, A.S. ∙ Doerner, A.E. ... Mechanism of Allosteric Coupling into and through the Plasma Membrane by EGFR Cell Chem. Biol. 2018; 25 :857-870.e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), the angle between the dimerized and crossed TRKB TMDs, regulated by the CHOL-regulated membrane thickness, plays an important role in TRKB signaling. Obviously, the configuration of the TMD is not the only determinant of TRKB signaling capacity, nevertheless, our findings are a major step forward in understanding the interaction of TRKB with cellular membranes.
TRKB appears to be the only CHOL-sensing member from the TRK family of neurotrophin receptors. Although TRK family members show high homology, the TMD of TRKB differs from that of TRKA and TRKC, which, in contrast to TRKB, act as dependence receptors inducing cell death in the absence of a ligand ( Nikoletopoulou et al., 2010 87. Nikoletopoulou, V. ∙ Lickert, H. ∙ Frade, J.M. ... Neurotrophin receptors TrkA and TrkC cause neuronal death whereas TrkB does not Nature. 2010; 467 :59-63 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ); this property is apparently dependent on the transmembrane domain ( Dekkers et al., 2013 21. Dekkers, M.P.J. ∙ Nikoletopoulou, V. ∙ Barde, Y.-A. Cell biology in neuroscience: Death of developing neurons: new insights and implications for connectivity J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203 :385-393 Crossref Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest that TRKB has evolved to become a CHOL sensor, which may be important for its function as mediator of activity-dependent plasticity.
The present findings demonstrate that ADs bind to TRKB and allosterically increase BDNF signaling, thereby directly linking the effects of ADs to neuronal plasticity. AD-induced plasticity is utilized by network-specific neuronal activity to guide re-wiring of plastic networks, allowing beneficial re-adaptation of networks abnormally wired during development or by stress ( Castrén, 2013 17. Castrén, E. Neuronal network plasticity and recovery from depression JAMA Psychiatry. 2013; 70 :983-989 Crossref Scopus (99) PubMed Google Scholar ). Our data suggest a framework that unites the effects of all ADs with therapy-mediated guidance to achieve the clinical AD response.

Experimental data generated in the present study is available in FigShare ( https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12698012 ). This study did not generate new code.
The cell line NIH 3T3 (mouse fibroblasts) stably transfected to express TRKB or TRKA (MG87.TRKB or MG87.TRKA, respectively) were used for in vitro assays ( Antila et al., 2014 6. Antila, H. ∙ Autio, H. ∙ Turunen, L. ... Utilization of in situ ELISA method for examining Trk receptor phosphorylation in cultured cells J. Neurosci. Methods. 2014; 222 :142-146 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), N2A and HEK293T cells were used to overexpress GFP-tagged TRKB for binding assays. The cells were maintained at 5% CO2, 37°C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and, in the case of MG87.TRKB cells, with 400 mg/ml of G418). The cell lines used in the present study were not authenticated or genotyped for sex.
Cortex or hippocampus of E18 rat or mouse embryos were dissected and the cells plated in poly-L-lysine coated wells at a 0.5x10 6 cells/ml density at 5% CO2, 37°C in Neurobasal medium as described in detail ( Sahu et al., 2019 103. Sahu, M.P. ∙ Nikkilä, O. ∙ Lågas, S. ... Culturing primary neurons from rat hippocampus and cortex Neuronal Signal. 2019; 3 :NS20180207 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The cells were left undisturbed, except for medium change, for 8-22 days depending on the experimental procedure. The primary cultures were not genotyped for sex.
GFP-tagged TRKB.wt or mutants were expressed in cortical or hippocampal cells, HEK293T or in MG87.TRKB cells using Lipofectamine 2000 as transfection agent. All compounds used in pharmacological treatments were diluted in DMSO for in vitro experiments, except NGF and BDNF, diluted in PBS. Cholesterol was dissolved in DMSO and sonicated.
C57BL/6NTac-Ntrk2em6006(Y433F)Tac (TRKB.Y433F) mice were generated by introducing the Y433F point mutation into exon 12 of the Ntrk2 gene using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing with a specific gRNA (Non-Seed_Seed-PAM: TCCTCAGG_TCTATGCCGTGG-TGG) and HDR (homology directed repair) oligonucleotide (GCAAGGTCATCAGACCTGGCTCTTTCTCTCTCCTCAGGTCTTCGCCGTGGTGGTGATTGCATCTGTGGTGGGATTCTGCCTGC). Introduction of the point mutation generates a restriction site for the BbsI restriction enzyme. The targeting strategy was based on NCBI transcript NM_001025074.2.
After the administration of hormones, superovulated C57BL/6NTac females were mated with C57BL/6NTac males. One cell stage fertilized embryos were isolated from the oviducts at dpc 0.5. For microinjection, the one cell stage embryos were placed in a drop of M2 medium under mineral oil. A microinjection pipette with an approximate internal diameter of 0.5 μm (at tip) was used to inject the mixed nucleotide preparation (tracrRNA, crRNA, HDR oligo and Cas9 protein) into the pronucleus of each embryo. After recovery, 25-35 injected one cell stage embryos were transferred to one of the oviducts of 0.5 dpc, pseudopregnant NMRI females.
The genomic DNA was extracted from biopsies and analyzed by PCR. The following templates were used as controls: H2O (ctrl1), wild-type genomic DNA (ctrl2). A two primer PCR (forward primer: GTTGAGGTTAAAGTGACCTGCTG; reverse primer: TCCTGCTGAGTTAGTCCACACTC) detects the CRISPR/Cas9-induced constitutive knock-in allele as well as potential indel modifications and the unmodified wild-type allele. To distinguish indel modifications from unmodified wild-type sequences, heteroduplex analysis (e.g., via capillary electrophoresis) has to be performed. The PCR amplicons were analyzed using a Caliper LabChip GX device. An aliquot of the PCR reaction was used to validate the presence or absence of the restriction site introduced via homology directed repair. 10U of BbsI enzyme was pipetted into the PCR reaction aliquot and incubated at the appropriate temperature. BbsI digest results in cleavage of the 493bp PCR product (HDR) in two fragments (362bp and 131bp).
The PCR product of the positive animals from the restriction analysis was subcloned for further characterization of the founder animals. 12 subclones have been prescreened for the integration of the HDR oligonucleotide by restriction with BbsI. The ratio between the total number of analyzed clones and a positive restriction result allows an estimation of the HDR mosaicism of the founder animals. Subsequently, up to 4 clones were sequenced to confirm correct integration of the HDR oligo and presence of the Y433F point mutation. Finally, the TRKB.Y433F mice were crossed with C57BL6-RccHsd (Envigo-Harlan, the Netherlands), in the University of Helsinki. All animals used from this strain were heterozygous for the Y433F mutation (TRKB.Y433F) or wild-type littermates, and genotyped after weaning.
The SERT-KO mice [line B6.129(Cg)-Slc6atm1Kpl/J] on a C57BL/6 background were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY, USA) and bred at the Biomedical Center, University of Freiburg. In every animal, tail biopsies were genotyped with PCR using primers from the Jackson Laboratory database to confirm homozygous knock-out. The SERT-KO mice showed bands at 210 bp, whereas the wild-type mice showed bands at 318 bp, which confirmed the gene disruption at the SERT locus. Finally, for in vivo electrophysiology, male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used.
The present study used males and female mice (18-22 weeks old at the beginning of the experiments), and male Sprague-Dawley rats (15 weeks old at the beginning of the experiments). All animals used in the present study were experimentally naive before the beginning of the described experimental procedures. The animals were group housed (3-6 per cage - type ll: 552 cm2 floor area - for mice; and 3 per cage - type IV: 1500 cm2 - for rats, all from Tecniplast, Italy) and randomly allocated into the experimental groups, except when the drug administration was performed in the drinking water. All behavioral experiments were conducted in at least two separated cohorts and analyzed automatically or by experienced observers blind to the treatment/genotype conditions. The number of animals in each experiment was based on previous studies from the literature cited in the correspondent section. For in vivo experiments, fluoxetine and pravastatin were dissolved in the drinking water (0.08 or 0.1mg/l for fluoxetine and 0.08mg/l for pravastatin) and the volume consumed per cage was monitored every 3 days. R,R-HNK and ketamine were diluted in sterile saline for intraperitoneal injections.
All experimental protocols were approved by the local ethics committees in Finland (#ESAVI/10300/04.10.07/2016), Norway (#6159) and Germany (#G-18-88).
The protein simulated in this work included the transmembrane (TM) domains of a TRKB dimer (residues 427-459). For comparison, we also studied a TRKA dimer (residues 410-443). The lipid membranes considered were two-component bilayers composed of varying concentrations of palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and cholesterol (CHOL). Drug binding studies in the case of TRKB were performed for fluoxetine (FLX). The effects of drugs on the physical properties of lipid membranes were studied for FLX, ketamine, and R,R-HNK. The Charmm36/m force field was used for proteins ( Huang et al., 2017 44. Huang, J. ∙ Rauscher, S. ∙ Nawrocki, G. ... CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :71-73 Crossref Scopus (956) PubMed Google Scholar ) and lipids ( Klauda et al., 2010 58. Klauda, J.B. ∙ Venable, R.M. ∙ Freites, J.A. ... Update of the CHARMM all-atom additive force field for lipids: validation on six lipid types J. Phys. Chem. B. 2010; 114 :7830-7843 Crossref Scopus (2133) PubMed Google Scholar ), the TIP3P model was used for water ( Jorgensen et al., 1983 52. Jorgensen, W.L. ∙ Chandrasekhar, J. ∙ Madura, J.D. ... Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79 :926-935 Crossref Google Scholar ), and a compatible parameter set was employed for ions ( Beglov and Roux, 1994 10. Beglov, D. ∙ Roux, B. Finite representation of an infinite bulk system: Solvent boundary potential for computer simulations J. Chem. Phys. 1994; 100 :9050-9063 Crossref Google Scholar ). Parameters for the drugs were generated using the CHARMM general force field (CGenFF) program ( Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2012 119. Vanommeslaeghe, K. ∙ Raman, E.P. ∙ MacKerell, Jr., A.D. Automation of the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) II: assignment of bonded parameters and partial atomic charges J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2012; 52 :3155-3168 Crossref Scopus (651) PubMed Google Scholar ). For details, see below. Table S1 summarizes all simulations and relevant parameters.
The 3D structure for a segment of mouse TRKB containing its TM domain (residues 427-459) in its monomeric form was generated using the FMAP (Folding of Membrane-Associated Peptides) server ( Lomize et al., 2018 70. Lomize, A.L. ∙ Hage, J.M. ∙ Pogozheva, I.D. Membranome 2.0: database for proteome-wide profiling of bitopic proteins and their dimers Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :1061-1062 Crossref Scopus (6) PubMed Google Scholar ). The server predicted that the residues V432-A456 form an α - helical TM segment.
RosettaMP docking framework ( Alford et al., 2015 3. Alford, R.F. ∙ Koehler Leman, J. ∙ Weitzner, B.D. ... An Integrated Framework Advancing Membrane Protein Modeling and Design PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004398 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to predict the best dimer configurations to be used in atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The orientation of the monomeric helix in a lipid membrane was determined with the OPM server ( Lomize et al., 2006 68. Lomize, M.A. ∙ Lomize, A.L. ∙ Pogozheva, I.D. ... OPM: orientations of proteins in membranes database Bioinformatics. 2006; 22 :623-625 Crossref Scopus (791) PubMed Google Scholar ). To sample possible TM dimer interfaces and configurations extensively, each helix was rotated around the membrane normal at 30° intervals and simultaneously also tilted with respect to the membrane normal at 10° intervals covering a range between −30° and 30°, starting from the OPM predicted tilt angle. This procedure resulted in 2 × 6 × 12 = 144 starting configurations for docking. Rosetta MPdock tool ( Alford et al., 2015 3. Alford, R.F. ∙ Koehler Leman, J. ∙ Weitzner, B.D. ... An Integrated Framework Advancing Membrane Protein Modeling and Design PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11 :e1004398 Crossref Scopus (58) PubMed Google Scholar ) was used to generate 960 dimers for each of the 144 starting configurations, yielding a total of 138,240 TM dimer models. These models were sorted by their interface score, and the leading 10% were clustered into five groups using the Calibur clustering application ( Li and Ng, 2010 66. Li, S.C. ∙ Ng, Y.K. Calibur: a tool for clustering large numbers of protein decoys BMC Bioinformatics. 2010; 11 :25 Crossref Scopus (48) PubMed Google Scholar ) based on the models’ structural similarity. The structures with the best interface score in each cluster were selected as representative models.
The initial model of the human TRKA TM (amino acids 410-443) dimer was adapted from the NMR structure (PDB: 2N90 ). The initial position of the TRKA TM region in the lipid bilayers was determined using the PPM Server ( Lomize et al., 2017 69. Lomize, A.L. ∙ Lomize, M.A. ∙ Krolicki, S.R. ... Membranome: a database for proteome-wide analysis of single-pass membrane proteins Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :D250-D255 Crossref Scopus (21) PubMed Google Scholar ).
We initially performed an extensive set of exploratory simulations (10 repeats × 500 ns × 5 dimers × 2 membrane compositions) in a membrane environment (POPC:CHOL = 100:0 and POPC:CHOL = 60:40) at 363 K to assess the stability of the selected TRKB TM dimers, and to obtain relaxed structures. The temperature was chosen based on an objective to foster sampling and to find the thermally most stable dimer structures. These exploratory simulations revealed that the only stable dimer model is centrally-coupled (A439-G443) in a cross-like configuration. The simulations of TRKB presented in this study were all started from conformations sampled from the simulations of these dimers. All membrane-protein systems considered in this study were constructed using CHARMM-GUI ( Jo et al., 2017 50. Jo, S. ∙ Cheng, X. ∙ Lee, J. ... CHARMM-GUI 10 years for biomolecular modeling and simulation J. Comput. Chem. 2017; 38 :1114-1124 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The drug-binding pocket in the TRKB TM helix dimer was characterized by locally docking FLX to the TRKB TM dimers using RosettaScripts ( Fleishman et al., 2011 34. Fleishman, S.J. ∙ Leaver-Fay, A. ∙ Corn, J.E. ... RosettaScripts: a scripting language interface to the Rosetta macromolecular modeling suite PLoS ONE. 2011; 6 :e20161 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). 30 different cross-like dimer conformations generated by 30 independent 1-μs-long MD simulations in a membrane with 20 mol% cholesterol were used as the “receptor” conformations. FLX was separately placed in the vicinity of the four crevices formed at the dimer interface. The decoys from all docking runs (30 conformations × 4 crevices × 10,000 models) were combined, sorted based on interface score, and visually inspected. The best scoring model, where FLX is bound to the crevice facing the extracellular site in a wide-open cross-like dimer conformation, was selected as the basis for further simulations.
One hundred and twenty independent MD simulations (up to 500 ns each, POPC:CHOL = 80:20, 310 K) were initiated by randomly repositioning and reorienting the drug in the vicinity of the aforementioned TRKB binding pocket by perturbing it from its docked mode. The effect of net positive charge on the stability of FLX binding was assessed by protonation of FLX in place (6 repeats × 500 ns).
The details of the simulation systems reported in this study are given in Table S1 . The preparation of simulation systems and the simulation protocols follows the strategies described above. Systems 1-4 were simulated at 363 K ( Table S1 ) to improve the sampling of the conformational space of the TRKB dimer structure. In these high temperature simulations, the sampling space was confined to dimeric configurations using half-harmonic flat-bottomed restraints. These studies were guided by recent work on proteins in a membrane environment, which has shown simulations at elevated temperature to accurately reproduce the native-state structural equilibria ( Ulmschneider et al., 2011 117. Ulmschneider, J.P. ∙ Smith, J.C. ∙ White, S.H. ... In silico partitioning and transmembrane insertion of hydrophobic peptides under equilibrium conditions J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133 :15487-15495 Crossref Scopus (70) PubMed Google Scholar , 2014 118. Ulmschneider, M.B. ∙ Ulmschneider, J.P. ∙ Schiller, N. ... Spontaneous transmembrane helix insertion thermodynamically mimics translocon-guided insertion Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4863 Crossref Scopus (60) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2016 121. Wang, Y. ∙ Chen, C.H. ∙ Hu, D. ... Spontaneous formation of structurally diverse membrane channel architectures from a single antimicrobial peptide Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13535 Crossref Scopus (61) PubMed Google Scholar ). The results of the present work are consistent with this conclusion: the protein fold was not disrupted in any of the cases we simulated, and the wild-type TRKB dimers were stable. However, since TRKB dimers including the Y433F mutation were occasionally less stable at the elevated temperature, the half-harmonic flat-bottomed restraint was used to keep the Y433F dimer stable (system 4). Further, the validity of observations for systems 1-4 ( Figure 1 ) were confirmed by additional simulations at 310 K (systems 5-8). The key results and conclusions were consistent: the simulations at 310 K revealed the same overall distributions as those in Figure 1 but indicated that each one of those is comprised of 2-3 peaks that are separated by a free energy barrier.
As to the Y433F mutation, the results discussed in this paper refer to the heterozygous variant. Additional simulations for the homozygous variant (not discussed here) revealed similar behavior.
Systems 9-14 ( Table S1 ) were prepared starting from the stable FLX-bound state characterized in exploratory simulations described above. The binding site mutations were introduced in systems 12-14. Drug residence times were calculated for systems 10, 12, 13, 14.
Simulations of the TRKA TM region ( Table S1 , systems 15-20) were carried out in the same way as for TRKB.
For FLX, three independent sets of free energy calculations were performed to estimate the free energy of transfer from the gas phase to the aqueous phase to the membrane phase, and to the protein-binding site at 310 K. All calculations employed the free energy perturbation (FEP) method with Hamiltonian replica exchange ( Jiang and Roux, 2010 49. Jiang, W. ∙ Roux, B. Free Energy Perturbation Hamiltonian Replica-Exchange Molecular Dynamics (FEP/H-REMD) for Absolute Ligand Binding Free Energy Calculations J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010; 6 :2559-2565 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ) (exchange attempts at every 1 ps between neighboring windows with an even-odd alternating pattern). Soft-core potentials ( Beutler et al., 1994 14. Beutler, T.C. ∙ Mark, A.E. ∙ van Schaik, R.C. ... Avoiding singularities and numerical instabilities in free energy calculations based on molecular simulations Chem. Phys. Lett. 1994; 222 :529-539 Crossref Scopus (734) Google Scholar ) were employed for both Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions (α, the power for lambda term, the power of the radial term, and sigma were set to 0.5, 1, 6, and 0.3, respectively). Each free energy calculation employed 24 windows. For the membrane phase and the protein-binding scenario, the length of the simulations per window was 30-50 ns, and for the aqueous phase 20 ns.
Positional and orientational restraints in the harmonic form were employed to improve phase space overlap in the case of protein-binding calculations, except for the fully coupled state ( Wang et al., 2006 120. Wang, J. ∙ Deng, Y. ∙ Roux, B. Absolute binding free energy calculations using molecular dynamics simulations with restraining potentials Biophys. J. 2006; 91 :2798-2814 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (257) PubMed Google Scholar ). Half harmonic restraints were similarly employed to keep the decoupled molecules within the membrane slab in the membrane-transfer simulations. The lambda values, as well as the strength and the center of the restraints, were adjusted to improve the phase space overlap and exchange rates between the lambda windows.
The free energies and their statistical errors were estimated with the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method ( Shirts and Chodera, 2008 110. Shirts, M.R. ∙ Chodera, J.D. Statistically optimal analysis of samples from multiple equilibrium states J. Chem. Physiol. 2008; 129 :124105 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ) using Alchemical Analysis and the pymbar software ( Klimovich et al., 2015 59. Klimovich, P.V. ∙ Shirts, M.R. ∙ Mobley, D.L. Guidelines for the analysis of free energy calculations J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2015; 29 :397-411 Crossref Scopus (213) PubMed Google Scholar ). A separate set of calculations in the gas phase was performed to estimate the necessary corrections for decoupling the intracellular interactions. The necessary corrections arising from the added restraints and the decoupled intra-molecular interactions were applied to obtain the final free energy values.
To test the possibility that drug-induced modulation of lipid bilayer properties could indirectly activate or contribute to the activation of TRKB, we performed additional protein-free simulations of POPC-cholesterol bilayers with varying CHOL concentration (0, 20, and 40 mol%) (Systems 21-50). We used drug-to-lipid ratios of 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5.
All simulations were carried out using GROMACS 2018 ( Abraham et al., 2015 2. Abraham, M.J. ∙ Murtola, T. ∙ Schulz, R. ... GROMACS: high performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers SoftwareX. 2015; 1–2 :19-25 Crossref Scopus (5139) Google Scholar ). The equations of motion were integrated using the leap-frog algorithm with a 2 fs time step. All bonds involving hydrogens were constrained using the LINCS algorithm ( Hess et al., 1997 42. Hess, B. ∙ Bekker, H. ∙ Berendsen, H.J.C. ... LINCS: a linear constraint solver for molecular simulations J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18 :1463-1472 Crossref Google Scholar ). Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by the smooth particle mesh Ewald scheme ( Essmann et al., 1995 31. Essmann, U. ∙ Perera, L. ∙ Berkowitz, M.L. ... A smooth particle mesh Ewald method J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103 :8577-8593 Crossref Google Scholar ) with a real-space cutoff of 1.2 nm, a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm, and a fourth-order interpolation. A Lennard–Jones potential with a force-switch between 1.0 and 1.2 nm was used for van der Waals interactions.
Before the production runs, all protein-membrane systems were equilibrated in stages with the protein heavy atoms kept restrained, at 310 K and 1 atm pressure using the Berendsen thermostat and barostat ( Berendsen et al., 1984 12. Berendsen, H.J.C. ∙ Postma, J.P.M. ∙ van Gunsteren, W.F. ... Molecular dynamics with coupling to an external bath J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81 :3684-3690 Crossref Google Scholar ).
All production simulations ( Table S1 ) were performed in the NpT ensemble except for systems 1-4 and 15-17, which were performed in the NVT ensemble with a half-harmonic flat-bottomed restraint in case of TRKB (force constant 1000 kJ/mol/nm2) to maintain the inter-helical distance between the G443 Cα atoms below 0.45 nm. The temperature was maintained either at 310 K or 363 K ( Table S1 ) using the Nosé-Hoover thermostat ( Hoover, 1985 43. Hoover, W.G. Canonical dynamics: Equilibrium phase-space distributions Phys. Rev. A Gen. Phys. 1985; 31 :1695-1697 Crossref Scopus (13387) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nosé, 1984 89. Nosé, S. A molecular dynamics method for simulations in the canonical ensemble Mol. Physics. 1984; 52 :255-268 Crossref Scopus (6139) Google Scholar ). The protein, the membrane, and the solvent (water and 0.15 M KCl) were each coupled to separate heat baths at the temperatures indicated in Table S1 with a time constant of 1.0 ps. The free energy simulations, on the other hand, employed the leap-frog stochastic dynamics integrator maintaining the temperature at 310 K with the inverse friction constant for each group set to 2.0 ps. Pressure was controlled semi-isotropically using the Parrinello–Rahman barostat ( Parrinello and Rahman, 1981 92. Parrinello, M. ∙ Rahman, A. Polymorphic transitions in single crystals: a new molecular dynamics method J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 52 :7182-7190 Crossref Scopus (8666) Google Scholar ) with a reference pressure of 1 atm, a time constant of 5 ps, and compressibility of 4.5 × 10 −5 bar −1 on the xy -plane (membrane plane).
The simulation time for systems discussed in this work (the exploratory, the production and the free energy simulations) was over 295 μs. Including a large variety of test simulations (∼330 μs) the total simulation time adds up to more than 625 μs.
The cell viability assay was performed using CellTiterGlo (#G7571; Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, equal amounts of medium and the mixture of regents A and B were added to the E18 cortical cells (DIV8) cultivated in clear bottom 96-well plates and incubated for 40min. The luminescence was analyzed in a plate reader.
The TRKB:pY (phosphorylated TRKB), TRKB:PLC-γ1, PLC-γ1:pTRKB.Y816 interactions and were determined by ELISA, based on the general method described in literature ( Antila et al., 2014 6. Antila, H. ∙ Autio, H. ∙ Turunen, L. ... Utilization of in situ ELISA method for examining Trk receptor phosphorylation in cultured cells J. Neurosci. Methods. 2014; 222 :142-146 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Fred et al., 2019 35. Fred, S.M. ∙ Laukkanen, L. ∙ Brunello, C.A. ... Pharmacologically diverse antidepressants facilitate TRKB receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the endocytic adaptor complex AP-2 J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 :18150-18161 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), with minor adjustments. Briefly, white 96-well plates (OptiPlate 96F-HB, Perkin Elmer) were coated with capturing anti-TRKB or PLC-γ1 antibody (1:1000) in carbonate buffer (pH = 9.8) overnight (ON) at 4°C. Following a blocking step with 2%BSA in TBS-T (2 h, RT), samples were incubated ON at 4°C. The incubation with antibody against pTRKB.Y816, PLC-γ1 or pY (1:2000, ON, 4°C) was followed by HRP-conjugated anti-Rb IgG (1:5000, 2h, RT) or HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:10000, 2h, RT). Finally, the chemiluminescent signal generated by the reaction with ECL was analyzed in a plate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Scientific).
The surface levels of TRKB were also determined by ELISA ( Zheng et al., 2008 129. Zheng, J. ∙ Shen, W.-H. ∙ Lu, T.-J. ... Clathrin-dependent endocytosis is required for TrkB-dependent Akt-mediated neuronal protection and dendritic growth J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 :13280-13288 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the MG87.TRKB cells or primary cortical cells from rat or mouse embryos, cultivated in clear bottom 96-well plates (ViewPlate 96, Perkin Elmer), were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 100μl of 4% PFA per well. After washing with PBS and blocking with PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 5% BSA, the samples were incubated with primary anti-TRKB antibody (R&D Systems, #AF1494, 1:1000 in blocking buffer) or anti-GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors (CST, #8850, 1:2000 in blocking buffer) ON at 4°C. Following washing, the samples were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-goat or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 in blocking buffer) for 1h at RT. The cells were washed 4x with 200μl of PBS for 10 min each. Finally, the chemiluminescent signal generated by reaction with ECL was analyzed in a plate reader.
Protein-fragment complementation assay ( Remy and Michnick, 2006 101. Remy, I. ∙ Michnick, S.W. A highly sensitive protein-protein interaction assay based on Gaussia luciferase Nat. Methods. 2006; 3 :977-979 Crossref Scopus (319) PubMed Google Scholar ) (PCA) was measured upon the reconstitution of enzymatic activity of a humanized Gaussia princeps luciferase (GLuc) following the direct interaction of the proteins of interest in white 96-well plates. Two complementary fragments of the luciferase reporter protein were fused to the intracellular C terminus domain of TrkB or mutant TrkB(Y433F) to produce the PCA pairs GLuc1C-TRKB.wt/GLuc2C-TRKB.wt and GLuc1C-TRKB.Y433F/GLuc2C-TRKB.Y433F. Alternatively, the GLuc1C-TRKB.wt/GLuc2C-FYN or GLuc1C-TRKB.Y433F/GLuc2C-FYN pairs were used The GLuc2C-FYN construct expresses a lipid-raft enriched fragment of Src-family kinase FYN ( Merezhko et al., 2020 79. Merezhko, M. ∙ Pakarinen, E. ∙ Uronen, R.-L. ... Live-cell monitoring of protein localization to membrane rafts using protein-fragment complementation Biosci. Rep. 2020; 40 BSR20191290 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). The GLuc tag was linked via a GS linker that allows the physiological dynamics of TrkB without interference from the presence of the tag. When two TrkB molecules carrying the complementary GLuc fragments interact, the reporter can refold in its original and active conformation thereby producing bioluminescence in the presence of its substrate native coelenterazine. Neuro2A cells, in 10% (v/v) poly-L-Lysine coated 96 wells (10,000 cells/well) were transfected with the above-mentioned constructs. Cells were treated 48h post-transfection with BDNF (10ng/ml/10min), and luminescence measured as a direct indication of TRKB homodimerization with a plate reader (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Scientific, average of 5 measurements, 0.1 s each) immediately after the injection of the coelenterazine substrate (Nanolight Technology).
The levels of total and phosphorylated TRKB at Y515 or Y816 in MG87.TRKB cells, challenged with BDNF, as well as the levels of PLCg1 and pTRKB.Y816 were measured by western-blotting ( Rantamäki et al., 2007 99. Rantamäki, T. ∙ Hendolin, P. ∙ Kankaanpää, A. ... Pharmacologically diverse antidepressants rapidly activate brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor TrkB and induce phospholipase-Cgamma signaling pathways in mouse brain Neuropsychopharmacology. 2007; 32 :2152-2162 Crossref Scopus (214) PubMed Google Scholar ).
For the analysis of TRKB migration to lipid rafts, the samples from transfected N2A cells to express GFP-tagged TRKB.wt or TRKB.Y433F, challenged with BDNF, were processed to isolate detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fractions in sucrose gradient ( McGuinn and Mahoney, 2014 78. McGuinn, K.P. ∙ Mahoney, M.G. Lipid rafts and detergent-resistant membranes in epithelial keratinocytes Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1195 :133-144 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). N2A cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 million per plate on 10 cm plates and transfected after 24 hours with either wild-type GFP-tagged full length TRKB or the GFP-tagged Y433F TRKB mutant. 48 hours after plating, cells were washed with ice cold 1x PBS and scraped in extraction buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) with the addition of 0.5% v/v Lubrol (Serva) and a cocktail of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Cellular membranes were mechanically broken by passing the cell suspension through a 23G needle five times. Protein concentration was measured for each sample and equal amounts of proteins were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and mixed with sucrose in the extraction buffer to a final concentration of 72%. The samples were then transferred to the bottom of Beckman 2.2 mL ultracentrifuge tubes and carefully covered with equal volumes of 35% sucrose and 5% sucrose in the extraction buffer.
The samples were centrifuged at 52000 x g for 18 hours at +4°C with a TLS-55 rotor in a Beckman Coulter XP Optima ultracentrifuge. Finally, 12 fractions per sample, collected from the top of the tube, were transferred to clean tubes, sonicated for 10 minutes in 0.25% SDS and prepared for western blotting, where the levels of GFP-tagged TRKB and flotillin-2 were analyzed.
The cell-free assays (binding assays) were performed in white 96-well plates, based on the protocol used for western-blotting or ELISA ( Baeza-Raja et al., 2016 9. Baeza-Raja, B. ∙ Sachs, B.D. ∙ Li, P. ... p75 Neurotrophin Receptor Regulates Energy Balance in Obesity Cell Rep. 2016; 14 :255-268 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (22) PubMed Google Scholar ; Das et al., 2015 20. Das, I. ∙ Krzyzosiak, A. ∙ Schneider, K. ... Preventing proteostasis diseases by selective inhibition of a phosphatase regulatory subunit Science. 2015; 348 :239-242 Crossref Scopus (217) PubMed Google Scholar ). The plates were precoated with anti-GFP, anti-FLAG, anti-TRK or anti-TRKB antibody (1:1000) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.8), ON at 4°C. Following blocking with 3% BSA in PBS buffer (2 h at RT), 120 ug of total protein from each sample (of lysates from HEK293T cells transfected to overexpress GFP-TRKB.wt or GFP-TRKB.Y433F) were added and incubated overnight at 4°C under agitation. As controls, lysate from MG87 cells expressing TRKA were compared with cells expressing TRKB, and HEK293T cells expressing GFP-TRKB were compared with non-transfected cells, see Figure S4 . The plates were then washed 3x with PBS buffer, and the biotinylated fluoxetine or RR-HNK (0-100μM), or a mixture of biotinylated (1μM of fluoxetine or R,R-HNK) and non-biotinylated compounds (0-10μM), was added for 1h at RT. The amino-biotinylation of fluoxetine and RR-HNK was performed using a commercial kit (EZ-Link NHS-PEG4 Biotinylation Kit, #21455, Thermo Scientific) and the reaction monitored by mass spectrometry ( Tikka et al., 2016 115. Tikka, S. ∙ Monogioudi, E. ∙ Gotsopoulos, A. ... Proteomic Profiling in the Brain of CLN1 Disease Model Reveals Affected Functional Modules Neuromolecular Med. 2016; 18 :109-133 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar ). The luminescence was determined via HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:10000, 1h, RT) activity reaction with ECL by a plate reader. The luminescence signal from blank wells (containing all the reagents but the sample lystates, substituted by the blocking buffer) was used as background. The specific signal was then calculated by subtracting the values of blank wells from the values of the samples with matched concentration of the biotinylated ligand. For Figure 2 E, the precipitated TRKB.wt or Y433F was incubated with tritiated imipramine (0-30μM) and the radioactive emission of the ligand was determined by scintillation (OptiPhase Supermix cocktail: #1200-439; MicroBeta2, Perkin-Elmer). The scintillation signal from blank wells was used as background, and the specific signal was then calculated by subtracting the values of blank wells from the values of the samples with matched concentration of the radioactive ligand.
Microscale Thermophoresis - MST - experiments were performed using Monolith NT.115 (Blue/Red) instrument (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, Germany). The cell lysates of HEK293T cells expressing GFP-TRKB were used as a source of fluorescently labeled TRKB. HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-fused TRKB as described and lysed 24h after transfection. To evaluate binding of fluoxetine to TRKB, cell lysates were diluted 1.5x times with MST buffer (10mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1mM MgCl2, 3mM KCl, 150mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) to provide optimal level of fluorescence. The lysates of non-transfected HEK293T cells were used to evaluate background fluorescence, which appeared to be undetectable in current MST set up. Titration series of fluoxetine (0-100μM) were incubated with diluted cell lysates. The measurements were done in premium coated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, MO-K025) using LED source with 470nm and 50% infrared-laser power at 25°C. Hill model was used to evaluate binding affinity, each data point represents mean ΔFnorm values from four independent experiments. The bound fraction of the GFP-TRKB was determined and the fitting was performed using the Hill model method incorporated by the MO Affinity Analysis v2.3 software (NanoTemper Technologies).
Proximity ligation assay was done with Duolink In Situ Red Starter Kit Mouse/Goat (#DUO92103, Sigma-Aldrich), following manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, N2A cells (grown in 13 mm glass coverslips, in DMEM 10% FBS) were co-transfected by lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher) to express TRKB and farnesylated EGFP and, 24h later, were treated with biotinylated fluoxetine (10 μM/15min). Cells were fixed with PFA 4% for 15 min, washed, and incubated in Duolink blocking buffer for 1h at 37°C. Then, the coverslips were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated HRP (1:5000 in Duolink antibody diluent) for 45 min at room temperature. After washing twice in Duolink washing buffer A, samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with a mix of goat anti-TRKB (1:1000, #AF1494, R&D System) and mouse anti-HRP (1:1000, #200-3138-0100, Rockland Immunochemicals) diluted in Duolink antibody diluent. After washing in Duolink washing buffer A, samples were incubated for 1h at 37°C with a mix of minus and plus probes diluted 1:5 in Duolink antibody diluent. Then, ligation of probes with connector oligo was done by washing the samples in washing buffer A, and incubating for 30min at 37°C with ligase (25 U/ml) diluted in the Duolink ligation buffer. Amplification was done by washing the samples in the washing buffer A, and incubating for 100min at 37°C with polymerase (125 U/ml) diluted in the amplification buffer. Coverslips were washed in buffer B, then in buffer B diluted 1:100 in milliQ water, and mounted in Duolink in situ mounting medium with DAPI. All incubation steps were done in a humidified chamber.
Images were acquired in z stacks (at least 15 slices, 1.5μm each) with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (objective alpha Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.46 oil Korr M27, with 3x zoom).
For the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, E18 rat embryo hippocampal cells were plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) in 4-well cell culture plates at a density of 200.000 cells/well. The cultures were incubated at +37°C in serum-free Neurobasal medium (supplemented with 2% B27, 1% L-glutamine and 1% ampicillin) for approximately 2 weeks (DIV 14-16), renewing half of the growth media weekly. Then, they were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in order to overexpress GFP-tagged TRKB constructs (TRKB.WT or TRKB.Y433F). The cultures were incubated with the transfection mix (per well: 50ul neurobasal medium, 1ul Lipofectamine 2000, 1ug plasmid DNA) in serum-free media for 1.5 hours, followed by 3x medium washes and returned to the original growth medium after that. The cells were left at +37°C o/n to overexpress the constructs ( Koskinen et al., 2012 64. Koskinen, M. ∙ Bertling, E. ∙ Hotulainen, P. Chapter three - Methods to Measure Actin Treadmilling Rate in Dendritic Spines Conn, P.M. (Editor) Methods in Enzymology Academic Press, 2012; 47-58 Google Scholar ). Next day, FRAP was performed with a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710, Carl Zeiss AG) adapted for live cell imaging with a chamber set at +37°C and 5%CO2 (Zeiss Temp Module system, Carl Zeiss AG). Coverslips with the cultured hippocampal neurons were carefully transferred to 35mm Petri dishes with warm HBSS medium without phenol red or serum to avoid sources of background fluorescence. After a 10 minutes adaptation period in the microscope chamber to avoid focus drift caused by temperature fluctuations of the stage and objective, dendritic shafts or spines (spine head diameter = ∼1um) were localized with a 63x/0.90 NA dipping water objective. Picture format was 512x512 pixels. The nominal speed to capture images was set to 9 (pixel dwell 3.15 μseconds, taking approximately 0.5 s to finish a scan), and the pinhole aperture was set to completely open to obtain a strong fluorescent signal ( Koskinen et al., 2012 64. Koskinen, M. ∙ Bertling, E. ∙ Hotulainen, P. Chapter three - Methods to Measure Actin Treadmilling Rate in Dendritic Spines Conn, P.M. (Editor) Methods in Enzymology Academic Press, 2012; 47-58 Google Scholar ; Zheng et al., 2011 130. Zheng, C.-Y. ∙ Petralia, R.S. ∙ Wang, Y.-X. ... Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) of Fluorescence Tagged Proteins in Dendritic Spines of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons J. Vis. Exp. 2011; 2568 PubMed Google Scholar ). Once a region of interest (ROI) was selected with a circle that contained the whole spine, it was bleached to establish the FRAP baseline. In the prebleaching phase, three frames were taken for the purpose of normalization, setting the first frame as 100% FRAP start value. The bleaching phase consisted of a very short cycle (1-5 bleach iterations, ∼0.01–0.5 s) of bleaching to decrease signal of the ROI to 50%. The postbleaching phase lasted for 2 minutes (with a time resolution of 2 s/frame), until a plateau was reached and the shape of the recovery curve was clear. Next, fluoxetine (1μM), ketamine (10μM) or BDNF (20ng/ml) was added to the medium to reach a concentration of and was incubated for 15 minutes. After FRAP establishing baseline, bleaching was performed in different dendritic shafts or spines, and the following recording lasted again for 2 minutes (time resolution of 2 s/frame). Once added to the medium, the drug was present for the rest of the FRAP recording. Finally, for the FRAP image analysis we used the native Zeiss LSM 710 Zen software. The intensity value of the bleached ROI is normalized to a second neighboring unbleached dendritic ROI of the same area and similar initial intensity in order to compensate for the photobleaching generated in the acquisition of the images. That intensity value is then converted to % by dividing the intensity values of individual frames by the start value of the first frame (t0, 100%). The mean values from the different experimental groups were then plotted to generate the recovery curve ( González-González et al., 2012 36. González-González, I.M. ∙ Jaskolski, F. ∙ Goldberg, Y. ...

MG87.TRKB or primary cultured cortical cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and unspecific binding sites were blocked with a blocking buffer (5% normal donkey serum, 1% Bovine serum albumin, 0.1% gelatin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS). The MG87.TRKB cells were stained with anti-GFP, while primary cultures were incubated with anti-actin. The fluorescence was obtained following incubation with secondary antibodies. The coverslips were mounted with Dako Fluorescence Mounting Medium (#S3023). Images were acquired with Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (63x oil objective).
For Sholl analysis of cultured hippocampal cells, confocal images were processed using FIJI ImageJ (NIH software), and the number of branches in the 80-μm range from the cell soma were counted using FIJI plugin.
For direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) MG87.TRKB cells were grown on cell view 35mm dishes with glass bottom (Greiner) coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma). Cells were transfected to overexpress TRKB.wt or TRKB.Y433F, and 24h later treated with BDNF (10 ng/ml), fluoxetine (10 μM), cholesterol (20 μM) or ketamine (10 μM) for 15 minutes and fixed as for regular immunofluorescence imaging. Briefly, cells were fixed 24 hours post transfection with 4% PFA for 20 minutes, washed three times for 5 min with 1x PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% gelatin, 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS; all from Sigma) for 1 hour. The primary antibody against GFP (Abcam, #ab290) was diluted 1:100 and incubated overnight at +4°C, while the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit 647 (Invitrogen) was diluted 1:500 and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The dishes were stored in +4°C in 1x PBS no longer than 48 hours before imaging.
During imaging, cells were maintained in blinking buffer (10% glucose, 0.07% cysteamine, 0.75 mg/ml glucose oxidase and 0.04 mg/ml catalase in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 7.8-8; all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich), which was freshly prepared and changed every hour. Imaging was performed in TIRF mode (TIRF angle 89.3 calibrated with ring-TIRF at least twice per sample) to specifically image the fluorophores at the plasma membrane. A GE DeltaVision OMX SR system (GE Healthcare) equipped with an Apo N 60x/1.49 oil objective and a sCMOS camera was used to acquire the images. The 640 nm diode laser was used at 100% of power to excite the Alexa 647 fluorophores while the 405 nm laser was adjusted until approximately 50% of power in order to maintain the blinking throughout the imaging session. For each cell, 35000 frames were acquired, and the localization map of single fluorophores was reconstructed with SoftWoRx 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). For the localization map, the first 1000 frames approximately were discarded and the reconstruction parameters were maintained identical for all the samples.
Reconstruction parameters: For the localization of all the blinking events in the dataset, the point spread function size factor was set at 1.550 with a local maximum factor of 0.05. Drift correction was adjusted dividing the frames into 20 groups. Tracking of the fluorophores was performed with a maximum localization precision of 100 nm without fiducial markers. The final localization map of the fluorophores identified was built with a reconstruction pixel size of 10 nm and localization precision set at 5 and 100 nm respectively for the minimum and the maximum, and a fluorophore persistence threshold set at 3 frames.
The analysis of the reconstructed images was performed in Fiji. Depending on the size of picture, 5 or 10 representative regions of interest (ROIs) of 2x1 μm were blindly chosen per cell and used for particle analysis of the TRKB-positive clusters. The images acquired were from three independent experiments ( Jacobson et al., 2007 46. Jacobson, K. ∙ Mouritsen, O.G. ∙ Anderson, R.G.W.

In vivo electrophysiology. Intrahippocampal BDNF infusion was performed as described previously ( Messaoudi et al., 1998 80. Messaoudi, E. ∙ Bârdsen, K. ∙ Srebro, B. ... Acute intrahippocampal infusion of BDNF induces lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in the rat dentate gyrus J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79 :496-499 Crossref Scopus (161) PubMed Google Scholar ). The experiments were carried out on 20 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (15 weeks old, Janvier, France). Rats were housed in the animal facility for 1-week prior to the start of drug administration. Pravastatin was administered in drinking water at a dose of 10mg/kg/day (0.08mg/l solution) for 15-17 days calculated on the basis of daily body weight.
For electrophysiological experiments, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of urethane (U2500, Sigma-Aldrich) 1.5 g/kg body weight, positioned in a stereotaxic frame. The body temperature was constantly monitored and maintained at 37°C with an electric heating pad. Holes were drilled in the skull and a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (Tip separation 500micrometers; SNEX 100; Rhodes Medical Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA) was positioned in the angular bundle for stimulation of the medial perforant path (7.9 mm posterior to bregma, 4.2 mm lateral to the midline, and 2.5 mm below the dura.
A Teflon-coated tungsten wire recording electrode (outer diameter of 0.075 mm; A-M Systems #7960) was glued to the infusion cannula (30 gauge). The electrode was then cut so that it extended 800 μm from the end of the cannula. The recording electrode was placed in the dentate hilus (3.9 mm posterior to bregma, 2.2 mm lateral, and 2.8–3.1 mm below the dura). The recording electrode was slowly lowered into the brain with 0.1 mm increment while monitoring response waveform evoked at 400 μA with biphasic rectangular test pulse of 0.033 Hz (pulse-width 0.15 ms). The tip of the infusion cannula was located in the deep stratum lacunosum-moleculare of field CA1, 800 μm above the hilar recording site and 300-400 μm above the medial perforant synapse. The infusion cannula was connected via a polyethylene (PE50) tube to a 10μl Hamilton syringe and infusion pump.
Responses were allowed to stabilize for 1 hour at a stimulation intensity that produced a population spike 30% of maximum. After baseline recording for 20 min, infusion of 2μl of 1 ug/ul BDNF over 30 min at a rate of 0.067μl/min. Evoked responses were recorded for 120 min post infusion. Recorded field potentials were amplified, filtered (0.1 Hz to 10 kHz), and digitized (25 kHz). Electrophysiological data was analyzed using Datawave Technologies Software company. Changes in the fEPSP slope were expressed in percent of baseline. After recordings rats were decapitated and dentate gyri were dissected and immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until use.
Ex vivo electrophysiology. Extracellular field potentials (fEPSP) were recorded in acute slices of adult mouse hippocampus ( Popova et al., 2017 96. Popova, D. ∙ Castrén, E. ∙ Taira, T. Chronic fluoxetine administration enhances synaptic plasticity and increases functional dynamics in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses Neuropharmacology. 2017; 126 :250-256 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ). Adult male and female mice (18-22 weeks old) were deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane, the brains were dissected and immersed in ice-cold dissection solution containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 15 D-glucose, 9 MgSO4 and 0.5 CaCl2. The cerebellum and anterior part of the brain were removed and horizontal 350 μm brain slices of the hippocampus were cut on a vibratome. For recovery, the slices were incubated for 30 min at 31-32°C in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 26 NaHCO3, 15 D-glucose, and 2 CaCl2 and bubbled with 5% CO2/95% O2.
Field excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSPs) were recorded in an interface chamber using ACSF-filled glass microelectrodes (2-4 MΩ) positioned in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region and amplified an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Electric stimulation (100 μsec duration) was delivered with a bipolar concentric stimulation electrode placed at the Schaffer collateral. Baseline synaptic responses were evoked every 20 s with a stimulation intensity that yielded a half-maximum response. After obtaining a 15 min stable baseline theta burst stimulation (TBS: 10 bursts of four pulses at 100 Hz, with an interburst interval of 200 msec) or tetanic stimulation (200ms pulse interval; 100 pulses; 0.1ms pulse duration) was delivered and field potentials were recorded for 45 min.
Input/output (I/O) curves were constructed using gradually increased stimulation intensities of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mV until the fEPSP reached plateau or visible population spike was seen.
To examine short term plasticity, we performed paired-pulse-facilitation (PPF) experiments using interpulse intervals (IPIs) of 20, 50, 100, and 200 ms and stimulation intensity evoking half-maximal fEPSP slopes were used. WinLTP (0.95b or 0.96, https://www.winltp.com ) was used for data acquisition.
The “transparent skull” preparation was executed as described in literature ( Steinzeig et al., 2017 112. Steinzeig, A. ∙ Molotkov, D. ∙ Castrén, E. Chronic imaging through “transparent skull” in mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0181788 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, adult female mice (20-22 weeks old) were anesthetized via i.p. injection with a mixture containing: 0.05 mg/kg fentanyl (Hameln, Germany); 5 mg/kg midazolam (Hameln, Germany); 0.5 mg/kg medetomidine (Orion Pharma, Finland); diluted in saline (B Braun, Germany). The animals’ eyes were covered with protective-gel (Alcon, UK). The animal’s head was shaved and disinfected with ethanol and Betadine. The mouse head was then fixed on the stereotaxic frame and the temperature was maintained at 37°C. A mixture of lidocaine and adrenaline (Orion Pharma, Finland) was applied locally on the head and the skin was cut with spring scissors. The incision area was restricted 2 mm above the bregma and caudal edge of intraparietal bone. The scalp was removed and a focused air stream and a cotton swab were used to clean and stop bleeding. The periosteum was gently scratched away from the skull with an eye scalpel and the temporal muscles were pushed aside, in order to expose enough space around the area of interest to attach the metal holder. When the skull was smooth, white and dry, fat was removed from the skull rapidly by passing on it a cotton swab soaked in acetone and the air current was used to avoid its penetration into the bone. Then, with a metal stick, a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue (Loctite 401, Henkel, Germany) was applied to the surface of the skull, in order to make the skull transparent. After waiting 10 minutes for the glue to dry, a first layer of acryl was applied on the skull surface with a brush. Acryl was used to prolong the life of the transparency and was prepared by stirring acrylic powder (EUBECOS, Germany) with methacrylate liquid (Densply, Germany) until a nail-polish consistency was reached. After 30 minutes, a second layer of acryl was applied and was left to dry overnight. Finally, the animals were injected s.c. with 5 mg/kg Carprofen (ScanVet, Nord Ireland) for postoperative analgesia and i.p. with a wake-up composed by: 1.2 mg/kg Naloxone (Orpha-Devel Handels und Vertriebs GmbH, Austria), opioid receptor antagonist; 0.5 mg/kg Flumazenil (Hameln, Germany), GABA-A receptor antagonist; 2.5 mg/kg Atipamezole (Vet Medic animal Health Oy, Finland), adrenergic receptor antagonist; diluted in saline (B Braun, Germany). The next day, isoflurane at 4% was used for a couple of minutes to induce the anesthesia and then it was reduced at 2% for the procedure. The acryl layer was polished only on the area of interest, using a hand drill with a polishing bit. A metal head holder was first glued on the skull, carefully keeping the area of interest at the center of the holder, and then fixed with a mixture of cyanoacrylate glue and dental cement (Densply, Germany). Finally, transparent nail polished (#72180, Electron Microscopy Sciences) was applied inside the metal holder above the area of interest.
Monocular deprivation. -Isoflurane at 4% was used for a couple of minutes to induce the anesthesia and then it was maintained at 2% until the end of the procedure. A drop of antibiotic eye gel (Isothal Vet 1%, Dechra, Canada) was applied on the left eye, the eyelashes were cut and the eye was sutured shut with 3 mattress sutures. At the end, antibiotic ointment (Oftan Dexa-Chlora, Anten, Finland) was applied on the sutured eye and Carprofen (5 mg/kg) was injected s.c. for postoperative analgesia. The monocular deprivation lasted 8 days and during that period, all animals were checked daily and resutured when showed a sign of the thread loss to prevent reopening of the eyes.
Optical imaging. The saturation of haemoglobin in the primary visual cortex of the right hemisphere was measured to assess cortical activity ( Cang et al., 2005 16. Cang, J. ∙ Rentería, R.C. ∙ Kaneko, M. ... Development of precise maps in visual cortex requires patterned spontaneous activity in the retina Neuron. 2005; 48 :797-809 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003 53. Kalatsky, V.A. ∙ Stryker, M.P. New paradigm for optical imaging: temporally encoded maps of intrinsic signal Neuron. 2003; 38 :529-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). The animals were anesthetized with 1.8% isoflurane with a 1:2 mixture of O2:air for 15 minutes and then maintained at 1.2% isoflurane for at least 10 minutes before starting the imaging session. Two sessions of imaging were performed: one before the beginning of the treatment administration (IOS I) and one on the 8th day after monocular deprivation (IOS II).
Optical Imaging Apparatus. The animals were kept on a heating pad located in front of and within 25 cm from the stimulus monitor. The head holder was firmly fixed and the animal’s nose was aligned to the midline of the stimulus monitor. The visual stimulus was a 2° wide horizontal bar moving upward with a temporal frequency of 0.125 Hz and a spatial frequency of 1/80 degree, displayed in the central part of a high refresh rate monitor (−15 to 5 degree azimuth, relative to the animal visual field) in order to preferentially stimulate the binocular part of the visual field. First, a green light (540 ± 20 nm) was used to illuminate the skull surface in order to find the region of interest and acquire a map of the surface vascular pattern, then the camera was focused 600 μm below the pial surface and the green light switched with a red light (625 ± 10 nm), to record the intrinsic signal. A longpass red filter (590 nm) was put between the skull surface and the camera to avoid that light from the stimulus monitor could affect the intrinsic signal acquisition. When the signal from one eye was being recorded, the other eye was protected with viscotears and covered with a patch. The continuous-periodic stimulation was synchronized with a continuous frame acquisition, frames were collected independently for each eye at a rate of 30 fps for 5 minutes and stored as a 512 × 512 pixel image, after spatial binning of the camera images.
Data analysis. An analysis software package designed by Kalatsky et al. was used to perform Fourier decomposition on the cortical maps, that allowed to extract the intrinsic signal from the biological noise ( Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003 53. Kalatsky, V.A. ∙ Stryker, M.P. New paradigm for optical imaging: temporally encoded maps of intrinsic signal Neuron. 2003; 38 :529-545 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (378) PubMed Google Scholar ). The intrinsic response was presented as fractional changes in skull surface reflectance x 104 and its magnitude was used to calculate the activation of the visual cortex in the right hemisphere due to ipsilateral or contralateral eye stimulation. A low-pass filter (uniform kernel of 5 × 5 pixel) was applied to the ipsilateral magnitude map to smoothen it and then, in the resulting map, the 30% of the peak response amplitude was set as threshold in order to eliminate background noise and to define the area that produced the strongest response to the ipsilateral eye. This smoothened and thresholded map was used as a mask to select the binocularly responsive region of interest within the visual cortex. After obtaining cortical maps for both contralateral (C) and ipsilateral (I) eyes and computing Ocular Dominance score as (C−I)/(C+I), finally, the Optical Dominance Index (ODI) was calculated as the mean of the OD score for all responsive pixels ( Cang et al., 2005 16. Cang, J. ∙ Rentería, R.C. ∙ Kaneko, M. ... Development of precise maps in visual cortex requires patterned spontaneous activity in the retina Neuron. 2005; 48 :797-809 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (183) PubMed Google Scholar ; Greifzu et al., 2014 37. Greifzu, F. ∙ Pielecka-Fortuna, J. ∙ Kalogeraki, E. ... Environmental enrichment extends ocular dominance plasticity into adulthood and protects from stroke-induced impairments of plasticity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111 :1150-1155 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The ODI values are contained in an interval going from −1 to +1: positive values indicate a contralateral bias, negative ones indicate ipsilateral bias and ODI values of 0 indicate that ipsilateral and contralateral eyes are equally strong ( Steinzeig et al., 2017 112. Steinzeig, A. ∙ Molotkov, D. ∙ Castrén, E. Chronic imaging through “transparent skull” in mice PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 :e0181788 Crossref Scopus (4) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Object-location memory (OLM): this test was performed in a square arena (28cm side) with opaque walls containing cues (black stripes or spots). The adult male and female mice (18-22 weeks old) were placed for 3 consecutive days (15min per session) in the arena with two identical objects (table tennis balls glued to caps of 50ml Falcon tubes) in the same position throughout the sessions (pretest). At the test session one of the objects is moved to a different position and the number of visits (counted as sniffing or interacting with the object) to the old (A) or newly located (A’) object was determined by an observer bling to the conditions ( Ampuero et al., 2013 4. Ampuero, E. ∙ Stehberg, J. ∙ Gonzalez, D. ... Repetitive fluoxetine treatment affects long-term memories but not learning Behav. Brain Res. 2013; 247 :92-100 Crossref Scopus (17) PubMed Google Scholar ; Dere et al., 2007 22. Dere, E. ∙ Huston, J.P. ∙ De Souza Silva, M.A. The pharmacology, neuroanatomy and neurogenetics of one-trial object recognition in rodents Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2007; 31 :673-704 Crossref Scopus (506) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Contextual fear conditioning: this test was modified from previous studies ( Karpova et al., 2011 55. Karpova, N.N. ∙ Pickenhagen, A. ∙ Lindholm, J. ... Fear erasure in mice requires synergy between antidepressant drugs and extinction training Science. 2011; 334 :1731-1734 Crossref Scopus (231) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, adult male and female mice (18-22 weeks old) were conditioned to 5 scrambled foot shocks (0.6mA/2 s) during the 8 min session (arena: 23 × 23 × 35cm) under constant illumination (100 lux). During the extinction trials, the animals were exposed to the same context where the shocks were delivered and the time spent in freezing during the 8 min session was automatically determined by the software (TSE Systems, Germany).
Forced swimming test: animals (adult male and female mice, 18-22 weeks old) were placed in 5l glass beaker cylinders (19cm diameter, with 20cm water column) for 6min. The immobility was assessed in the last 4min of the session ( Diniz et al., 2018 25. Diniz, C.R.A.F. ∙ Casarotto, P.C. ∙ Fred, S.M. ... Antidepressant-like effect of losartan involves TRKB transactivation from angiotensin receptor type 2 (AGTR2) and recruitment of FYN Neuropharmacology. 2018; 135 :163-171 Crossref Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ). The water was changed between each test. After swimming, animals were towel-dried and kept in a warmed cage before returning to their home cages. Test was videotaped and analyzed by a trained observer blind to treatment.
Animals: both males and females were used in this experiment. The Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma) was administered intraperitoneally at the dose of 75 mg/kg four times every 2 hr to reach 300 mg/kg total for each animal. The injection procedure was carried out at the start of the treatment (fluoxetine 15mg/kg/day in the drinking water for 3 weeks, solution at 0.1mg/l). On day 21 of the drug treatment, the animals were euthanized by CO2, brains were quickly removed, followed by hippocampus dissection on ice, instantly frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until further use.
A semiquantitative dot-blot method was performed as previously described with minor modifications ( Wu and Castrén, 2009 124. Wu, X. ∙ Castrén, E. Co-treatment with diazepam prevents the effects of fluoxetine on the proliferation and survival of hippocampal dentate granule cells Biol. Psychiatry. 2009; 66 :5-8 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). To isolate the DNA of the hippocampus samples, DNeasy® Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) was used. The extraction procedure was as per the manufacturer’s instruction. The DNA purity was assessed by the spectrophotometer NanoDrop 2000C (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). DNA was incubated with 1 volume of 4N NaOH solution for 30 min at room temperature to render it as single stranded and immediately kept on ice to prevent reannealing. The DNA solution was neutralized by an equal volume of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). The single-stranded neutralized DNA (1ug) was dot-blotted onto a nylon transfer membrane (Schlleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) with a dot-blot apparatus (Minifold, Schlleicher and Schuell) under vacuum and the DNA was fixed by ultraviolet cross-linker (1200 μJ × 100, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These membranes were processed as mentioned in the previous publication. The mouse anti BrdU monoclonal antibody (1:1000, B2531, Sigma) was used as the primary antibody and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Bio-Rad, USA) as the secondary antibody. The Pierce ECLplus kit (Thermo Fisher scientific, USA) was used as a chemiluminescent method to develop the membrane. The membranes were scanned by imaging using a Fuji LAS-3000 Camera (Tamro Medlabs, Finland) and the densitometry analysis was performed by ImageJ Software.
The brain samples were homogenized in 200 μL of 100% methanol (LiChrosolv, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with an ultrasound sonicator (GM35-400, Rinco Ultrasonic, Switzerland) continuously for at least 30 s. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20800 g for 35 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then removed to 0.5 mL Vivaspin filter concentrators (10,000 MWCO PES; Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany) and centrifuged at 8600 x g at 4°C for 35 min.
The HPLC system for determination of the concentration of fluoxetine consisted of a solvent delivery pump (Jasco model PU-1580 HPLC Pump, Jasco International Co, Japan) connected to an online degasser (Jasco 3-Line Degasser, DG-980-50) and a ternary gradient unit (Jasco LG-1580-02), an analytical column (Kinetex C-18 5 μm, 4.60 × 50 mm, Phemomenex Inc) protected by a 0.5-mm inlet filter and thermostated by a column heater (CROCO-CIL, Cluzeau Info-Labo, France), and a fluorescence detector (Jasco Intelligent Fluorescence Detector model FP-1520). The wavelengths of the fluorescence detector were set to 290 (excitation) and 230 (emission), which have been found to be optimized for fluoxetine ( Raggi et al., 1998 98. Raggi, M.A. ∙ Mandrioli, R. ∙ Casamenti, G. ... Determination of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine in human plasma by high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1998; 18 :193-199 Crossref Scopus (46) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1 M NaH2PO4 buffer (Merck, D), pH 2.7 (adjusted with phosphoric acid), 35% (v/v) acetonitrile (LiChrosolv, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and the flow-rate was 1.0 ml/min. Ten microliters of the filtrate was injected onto the column with a refrigerated autoinjector (Shimadzu NexeraX2 SIL-30AC, Shimadzu Corp, Japan). The chromatograms were processed by AZUR chromatography data system software (Cromatek, Essex, UK). The results can be found in Table S2 .
The data in the present study was analyzed by Student’s t test (two-tailed, paired or independent); one- or two-way ANOVA were also applied, followed by Fisher’s LSD post hoc test using GraphPad Prism ( https://www.graphpad.com/ ) v6.01; or multivariate ANOVA using JASP ( https://jasp-stats.org/ ) v.0.14.1.
