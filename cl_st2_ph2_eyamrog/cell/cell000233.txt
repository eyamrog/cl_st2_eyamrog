Title: Trained Immunity-Promoting Nanobiologic Therapy Suppresses Tumor Growth and Potentiates Checkpoint Inhibition


Abstract: Summary

Trained immunity, a functional state of myeloid cells, has been proposed as a compelling immune-oncological target. Its efficient induction requires direct engagement of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. For this purpose, we developed a bone marrow-avid nanobiologic platform designed specifically to induce trained immunity. We established the potent anti-tumor capabilities of our lead candidate MTP 10 -HDL in a B16F10 mouse melanoma model. These anti-tumor effects result from trained immunity-induced myelopoiesis caused by epigenetic rewiring of multipotent progenitors in the bone marrow, which overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, MTP 10 -HDL nanotherapy potentiates checkpoint inhibition in this melanoma model refractory to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Finally, we determined MTP 10 -HDL’s favorable biodistribution and safety profile in non-human primates. In conclusion, we show that rationally designed nanobiologics can promote trained immunity and elicit a durable anti-tumor response either as a monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitor drugs.

Section: Introduction

In the last two decades, the immuno-oncology field has generated several significant breakthroughs in cancer therapy, including immunotherapies that have shown major clinical benefit in patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic cancer. These immunotherapies act primarily by stimulating an adaptive T cell response ( Pardoll, 2012 42. Pardoll, D.M. Immunology beats cancer: a blueprint for successful translation Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13 :1129-1132 Crossref Scopus (149) PubMed Google Scholar ). Checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies are among the most advanced immunotherapies for cancer treatment. Checkpoint inhibitor drugs induce or restore T cells’ ability to mount an effective anti-tumor response by eliminating the brakes on these cells’ anti-tumor properties ( Sharma and Allison, 2015 52. Sharma, P. ∙ Allison, J.P. The future of immune checkpoint therapy Science. 2015; 348 :56-61 Crossref Scopus (3636) PubMed Google Scholar ). CAR-T therapy involves the adoptive transfer of T cells genetically modified to effectively seek and kill tumor cells in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent manner ( Gross et al., 1989 14. Gross, G. ∙ Waks, T. ∙ Eshhar, Z. Expression of immunoglobulin-T-cell receptor chimeric molecules as functional receptors with antibody-type specificity Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86 :10024-10028 Crossref Scopus (1190) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kalos et al., 2011 19. Kalos, M. ∙ Levine, B.L. ∙ Porter, D.L. ... T cells with chimeric antigen receptors have potent antitumor effects and can establish memory in patients with advanced leukemia Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3 :95ra73 Crossref Scopus (1974) PubMed Google Scholar ). Exploiting the innate immune response in cancer therapy is beginning to gain traction but remains largely uncharted territory.
The innate immune system acts as a rapid first line of defense, triggered through recognition of either pathogens or endogenous danger signals by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) ( Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002 18. Janeway, Jr., C.A. ∙ Medzhitov, R. Innate immune recognition Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20 :197-216 Crossref Scopus (6548) PubMed Google Scholar ). Upon detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) ( Akira et al., 2006 1. Akira, S. ∙ Uematsu, S. ∙ Takeuchi, O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity Cell. 2006; 124 :783-801 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (9536) PubMed Google Scholar ), PRRs initiate an innate immune response, which involves activating the subsequent adaptive immune system by antigen presentation (signal 1), co-stimulation (signal 2), and cytokine excretion (signal 3) ( Kambayashi and Laufer, 2014 20. Kambayashi, T. ∙ Laufer, T.M. Atypical MHC class II-expressing antigen-presenting cells: can anything replace a dendritic cell? Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :719-730 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ; Murphy et al., 2012 36. Murphy, K. ∙ Travers, P. ∙ Walport, M. ... Janeway’s immunobiology Garland Science, 2012 Google Scholar ). In addition, PRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading to non-infectious inflammatory responses ( Seong and Matzinger, 2004 51. Seong, S.Y. ∙ Matzinger, P. Hydrophobicity: an ancient damage-associated molecular pattern that initiates innate immune responses Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4 :469-478 Crossref Scopus (1025) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Though the innate immune system was long believed to lack memory, recent studies show that innate immune cells undergo metabolic and epigenetic rewiring, adjusting their functional programs in a process termed “trained immunity” that is considered a de facto innate immune memory ( Netea et al., 2016 39. Netea, M.G. ∙ Joosten, L.A. ∙ Latz, E. ... Trained immunity: A program of innate immune memory in health and disease Science. 2016; 352 :aaf1098 Crossref Scopus (1693) PubMed Google Scholar ; Netea et al., 2011 38. Netea, M.G. ∙ Quintin, J. ∙ van der Meer, J.W. Trained immunity: a memory for innate host defense Cell Host Microbe. 2011; 9 :355-361 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1097) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trained immunity is regulated and maintained through induction of training properties in bone marrow progenitor cells, resulting in durable reprogramming that exceeds the myeloid cell lifespan in the bloodstream ( Mitroulis et al., 2018 33. Mitroulis, I. ∙ Ruppova, K. ∙ Wang, B. ... Modulation of Myelopoiesis Progenitors Is an Integral Component of Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 172 :147-161.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (669) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although trained immunity can be easily induced with a range of “training agents” in cultured myeloid cells, its systemic induction requires bone marrow progenitor cell engagement. Toward this purpose, nanomaterials can be functionalized with trained immunity-inducing molecular structures and designed to exhibit high bone marrow avidity, in order to facilitate association with myeloid-biased progenitor cells ( Braza et al., 2018 5. Braza, M.S. ∙ van Leent, M.M.T. ∙ Lameijer, M. ... Inhibiting Inflammation with Myeloid Cell-Specific Nanobiologics Promotes Organ Transplant Acceptance Immunity. 2018; 49 :819-828.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). If appropriately designed, such nanomaterials can elicit a durable anti-cancer innate immune response by stimulating the production of trained myeloid cells and their resulting influx into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Simultaneously, these trained cells mobilize adaptive immune responses via enhanced T cell activation, primarily through the augmentation of signals 2 and 3 ( Kambayashi and Laufer, 2014 20. Kambayashi, T. ∙ Laufer, T.M. Atypical MHC class II-expressing antigen-presenting cells: can anything replace a dendritic cell? Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14 :719-730 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ), but also through improved antigen presentation ( Leentjens et al., 2015 27. Leentjens, J. ∙ Kox, M. ∙ Stokman, R. ... BCG Vaccination Enhances the Immunogenicity of Subsequent Influenza Vaccination in Healthy Volunteers: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study J. Infect. Dis. 2015; 212 :1930-1938 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here, we present the development and therapeutic application of trained immunity-inducing nanobiologics. Following a thorough screening of differently composed nanobiologics, we identified a lead candidate, named MTP 10 -HDL, for subsequent intravenous application in a mouse melanoma model. We studied this nanobiologic’s therapeutic benefits using a combination of tumor growth profiling, ATAC- and RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and multiple imaging techniques. In addition to its application as monotherapy, MTP 10 -HDL therapy enhances the immune system’s susceptibility to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy and thereby improves therapeutic outcomes in a mouse melanoma model. MTP 10 -HDL therapy’s pharmacokinetics and safety profile were evaluated in mice and non-human primates.

Section: Results

Nanobiologics are nanomaterials bioengineered from natural carrier molecules, i.e., phospholipids and cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA1) ( Mulder et al., 2009 35. Mulder, W.J. ∙ Strijkers, G.J. ∙ van Tilborg, G.A. ... Nanoparticulate assemblies of amphiphiles and diagnostically active materials for multimodality imaging Acc. Chem. Res. 2009; 42 :904-914 Crossref Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter is the main protein constituent of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). ApoA1 provides structural integrity to nanobiologics’ overall structure and through its ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 specificity also contributes to nanobiologics’ affinity for myeloid cells and their progenitors ( Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010 60. Yvan-Charvet, L. ∙ Pagler, T. ∙ Gautier, E.L. ... ATP-binding cassette transporters and HDL suppress hematopoietic stem cell proliferation Science. 2010; 328 :1689-1693 Crossref Scopus (592) PubMed Google Scholar ). We have previously shown that nanobiologics exhibit high bone marrow avidity ( Braza et al., 2018 5. Braza, M.S. ∙ van Leent, M.M.T. ∙ Lameijer, M. ... Inhibiting Inflammation with Myeloid Cell-Specific Nanobiologics Promotes Organ Transplant Acceptance Immunity. 2018; 49 :819-828.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ; Pérez-Medina et al., 2015 46. Pérez-Medina, C. ∙ Tang, J. ∙ Abdel-Atti, D. ... PET Imaging of Tumor-Associated Macrophages with 89Zr-Labeled High-Density Lipoprotein Nanoparticles J. Nucl. Med. 2015; 56 :1272-1277 Crossref Scopus (144) PubMed Google Scholar ) and that they can be functionalized with therapeutic moieties, such as peptidoglycan derivatives in this study. Peptidoglycans can induce trained immunity by activating the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) receptor ( Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012 21. Kleinnijenhuis, J. ∙ Quintin, J. ∙ Preijers, F. ... Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :17537-17542 Crossref Scopus (1190) PubMed Google Scholar ). The smallest immunoreactive peptidoglycan-derived molecular structure is muramyl dipeptide (MDP) ( Kufer et al., 2006 23. Kufer, T.A. ∙ Banks, D.J. ∙ Philpott, D.J. Innate immune sensing of microbes by Nod proteins Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2006; 1072 :19-27 Crossref Scopus (98) PubMed Google Scholar ). L 18 -MDP, a 6- O -acyl MDP derivative with a stearoyl fatty acid, and muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE) are both known to induce trained immunity ( Meyers, 2009 32. Meyers, P.A. Muramyl tripeptide (mifamurtide) for the treatment of osteosarcoma Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 2009; 9 :1035-1049 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Mourits et al., 2018 34. Mourits, V.P. ∙ Wijkmans, J.C. ∙ Joosten, L.A. ... Trained immunity as a novel therapeutic strategy Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2018; 41 :52-58 Crossref Scopus (52) PubMed Google Scholar ). These compounds exhibit amphiphilic properties favorable for their HDL incorporation. The resulting HDL nanobiologics have MDP or MTP exposed on their surfaces, essentially forming nanosized trained immunity-inducing microbial mimetics.
We created an MDP/MTP-HDL mini library comprising nanobiologics composed of human apoA1 and the phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) that incorporated different molar quantities of either L 18 -MDP or MTP-PE (1.0–10 mol%). Additionally, we incorporated cholesterol (5.0–20 mol%) to improve nanobiologic stability. We then screened these nanobiologics by longitudinally measuring their size by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and establishing drug release kinetics as a function of cholesterol content. Concurrently, we investigated the nanobiologics’ trained immunity-promoting capacity in vitro on human and murine myeloid cells. The nanobiologics were additionally labeled with the radioisotope zirconium-89 ( 89 Zr) to quantitatively study, using gamma counting, their in vivo behavior in C57BL/6 mice. For ex vivo flow cytometric analyses, nanobiologics were labeled with lipophilic fluorophores ( Figure 1 A).
The results of this comprehensive screen are presented in the Supplemental Information and show that, while including cholesterol significantly improved the nanobiologics’ stability, the MDP/MTP surface density had little influence on blood clearance and biodistribution. For further studies, we therefore selected the most stable formulation with the highest MTP density, as this version allowed us to administer the relatively lowest nanobiologic dose ( Figure S1 and S2 ).
The selected lead candidate, MTP 10 -HDL ( Figure 1 B), containing 10 mol% MTP-PE and 20 mol% cholesterol, has a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 20 nm ± 2 nm (Ð = 0.3) as measured by DLS ( Figure 1 C). We observed a discoidal morphology by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM, Figures 1 D and S2 D). Longitudinal size measurements established MTP 10 -HDL’s size stability in PBS for at least 10 days ( Figure 1 E). After determining MTP 10 -HDL’s physicochemical characteristics, we extensively studied its properties to induce trained immunity on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells treated with MTP 10 -HDL were analyzed for epigenetic changes using chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR), and medium was subjected to multiplex cytokine analysis. ChIP-qPCR showed increased H3K4 methylation of both promotors of TNFA , IL6 , and IL1B cytokine genes known to be cytokine biomarkers of trained immunity. In conjunction, the multiplex data showed increased production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-y, further corroborating that our lead candidate MTP 10 -HDL effectively trains cells in vitro ( Figures 1 F and 1G).
Following this extensive characterization, we radiolabeled MTP 10 -HDL with 89 Zr to generate 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL and studied its in vivo behavior in C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 melanoma. Using in vivo PET/CT imaging, we showed that 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL accumulated in bone marrow and spleen at 24 h post-intravenous administration, with a relatively low liver uptake ( Figure 2 A). Blood clearance measurements revealed 89 Zr-MTP-HDL’s weighted half-life ( t 1/2 ) to be 45.7 min ( Figure 2 B). 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL’s avidity for hematopoietic organs was validated by ex vivo gamma counting and autoradiography. We determined a bone marrow uptake of 28 ± 6.5 percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) and uptakes of 51 ± 17 %ID/g and 3.2 ± 1.0 %ID/g in the spleen and tumor, respectively ( Figure 2 C).
Next, we incorporated the fluorescent labels DiIC 18 (3) and DiOC 18 (3) to generate DiI-MTP 10 -HDL and DiO-MTP 10 -HDL, respectively. Ex vivo near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of organs from mice injected with MTP 10 -HDL labeled with both DiIC 18 (3) and 89 Zr (DiI- 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL) corroborated the nanobiologic’s bone marrow avidity. Autoradiography and NIRF imaging revealed marginal to undetectable uptake in muscle and vital organs, such as the brain and heart, and clearly showed DiI- 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL accumulation in the bone marrow, particularly in the proximal and distal parts where red marrow is located ( Figure 2 D). Live mice injected with DiI-MTP 10 -HDL as well as green fluorescent dextran were subjected to intravital microscopy (IVM). We observed DiI-MTP 10 -HDL’s association with myeloid cells throughout the spleen ( Figure S3 A) and the calvarium bone marrow ( Figure 2 E). In tumors, we found that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the vicinity of tumor blood vessels had taken up DiI-MTP 10 -HDL ( Figure 2 F).
After deploying IVM to establish MTP 10 -HDL’s general proclivity for myeloid cells, we used flow cytometry to thoroughly investigate MTP 10 -HDL uptake by immune cell subsets. To that end, intravenously injected DiO-MTP 10 -HDL was allowed to circulate for 24 h in tumor-bearing mice. In the femoral bone marrow, we observed DiO-MTP 10 -HDL uptake in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) ( Figure 2 G) along with all other myeloid progenitors ( Figure S3 B). High myeloid cell uptake was also observed in blood and spleen ( Figure S3 C) as well as in tumors ( Figure 2 G), while lymphocytes showed minimal uptake in all investigated tissues ( Figure 2 G).
Before we ventured into therapeutic studies, we investigated MTP 10 -HDL’s toxicity profile in mice. We first performed ELISA on mouse serum at 6 and 24 h after injection. At 6 h post-injection, we found a moderate increase in serum TNF-α levels that were normalized after 24 h, indicative of an initial immune response that did not result in a cytokine storm ( Figure S4 A). Furthermore, we performed blood chemistry of mice treated with MTP 10 -HDL and did not observe signs of renal toxicity or liver damage ( Figure S4 B). Histology of spleen and liver sections showed no pathological morphological changes ( Figure S4 C). Collectively, the in vitro trained immunity assays, in vivo biodistribution, and toxicity experiments revealed MTP 10 -HDL’s favorable characteristics for immunotherapeutic studies.
We first investigated MTP 10 -HDL’s ability to suppress tumor growth. To that aim, we performed an in vivo dose response study in C57BL/6 mice that were subcutaneously injected with 1 × 10 5 B16F10 melanoma cells. One week after tumor inoculation, when palpable tumors were established (~20 mm 3 ), mice received either control phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment or one of six different MTP 10 -HDL regimens, intravenously. The latter regimens consisted of one, two, or three intravenous injections of either a low (0.375 mg/kg) or high (1.5 mg/kg) MTP dose. Tumor size was monitored by daily caliper measurements. We observed clear dose- and regimen-dependent tumor growth inhibition without changes in bodyweight ( Figures 3 A and S4 D). Significantly different tumor growth rates in the mice treated with intensive regimens (two and three MTP 10 -HDL injections at 1.5 mg/kg MTP), when compared to the PBS-treated group (p = 0.0126; p = 0.0039), were measured. We found the mean tumor volume of 604 ± 99 mm 3 in the treatment group subjected to the most effective regimen to be nearly half of, and significantly different from, the control group (1,099 ± 173 mm 3 , p = 0.0002).
In two separate animal cohorts, we performed additional control experiments. In the first experiment we compared free MDP- and non-functionalized (bare) HDL against PBS-treated animals. We found no significant differences in tumor growth rates. ( Figure S4 E). In a separate experiment, we found MTP 10 -HDL administered intraperitoneally to not exhibit favorable bone marrow accumulation ( Figures S4 F and S4G) and not to impact tumor growth ( Figure S4 H). Since mice tolerated intravenously MTP 10 -HDL treatments without weight loss or other signs of toxicity, we applied the most effective regimen, i.e., three injections of 1.5 mg/kg MTP 10 -HDL, in ensuing experiments ( Figure 3 A).
As described above, intravenously administered MTP 10 -HDL accumulates in the bone marrow ( Figures 2 A–2E). The induction of myelopoiesis is an intrinsic part of the trained immunity phenotype and we therefore hypothesized that the bone marrow is critical for MTP 10 -HDL’s anti-tumor effect ( Mitroulis et al., 2018 33. Mitroulis, I. ∙ Ruppova, K. ∙ Wang, B. ... Modulation of Myelopoiesis Progenitors Is an Integral Component of Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 172 :147-161.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (669) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore transplanted bone marrow from mice treated with either MTP 10 -HDL or PBS into non-treated (naive) mice. In the first experiment, naive mice received the bone marrow transplant directly after irradiation and were inoculated with 1 × 10 5 B16F10 melanoma cells 6 weeks thereafter. In a similar experiment on non-irradiated mice, tumor cell inoculation was performed the day after bone marrow transplantation. Both experiments revealed a significant difference in tumor size at day 9, but the size difference was more pronounced in the irradiated mice (MTP 10 -HDL: 159 ± 25 mm 3 ; PBS: 379 ± 69 mm 3 , p < 0.0001, Figure 3 B) compared to the non-radiation experiment (MTP 10 -HDL: 362 ± 83 mm 3 ; PBS: 613 ± 87 mm 3 , p < 0.0001, Figure S4 I). In line with the differences in tumor size, we found a significant decrease in tumor growth rate in the irradiated mice that received bone marrow from treated mice as compared to control (p = 0.0359) ( Figure 3 B). These results are indicative of the bone marrow’s important contribution to MTP 10 -HDL nanoimmunotherapy’s anti-tumor effects.
Next, we elucidated the mechanism underlying MTP 10 -HDL’s anti-tumor effect in C57BL/6 mice without tumors. Trained immunity is a state of hyperresponsiveness that results from myeloid cells’ metabolic rewiring, including heightened glycolysis ( Arts et al., 2016 4. Arts, R.J. ∙ Joosten, L.A. ∙ Netea, M.G. Immunometabolic circuits in trained immunity Semin. Immunol. 2016; 28 :425-430 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because in vivo 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG)-PET imaging can visualize and quantify metabolic activity, we intravenously injected C57BL/6 mice with 18 F-FDG at day five after the first MTP 10 -HDL injection. PET imaging revealed a significantly higher 18 F-FDG uptake in the bone marrow of MTP 10 -HDL-treated animals. The mean maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max ) in this treatment group was 1.45 ± 0.31, while the control group had an SUV max of 1.02 ± 0.04 (p = 0.017) ( Figure 3 C).
The critical hallmark of trained immunity is epigenetic rewiring of myeloid progenitor cells. To asses these cells’ epigenetic state following MTP 10 -HDL treatment, we used an assay transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC sequencing) ( Buenrostro et al., 2013 6. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Giresi, P.G. ∙ Zaba, L.C. ... Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position Nat. Methods. 2013; 10 :1213-1218 Crossref Scopus (4008) PubMed Google Scholar ). HSCs and MPPs from six mice were pooled and processed for library creation ( Figure 3 D). Principal component analysis shows a relationship between samples based on the chromatin structure ( Figure 3 E), which was stronger in the treatment group. We found MPPs to be significantly more affected by MTP 10 -HDL treatment than HSCs ( Figure 3 F). Pathway analysis of the MPP ATAC sequencing data ( Figures 3 G and 3H) revealed that chromatin became more accessible near promoters of genes regulating key cytokines like tumor necrosis factor and IL-6. In addition to epigenetic shifts in immune system regulation, we also found that MPPs of mice treated with MTP 10 -HDL showed a more open chromatin for genes regulating pathways related to myeloid activation and differentiation.
Transcriptomic changes in HSCs and MPPs were studied by RNA sequencing. Bone marrow from treated and untreated mice was harvested, and these cells were isolated by flow sorting. HSCs and MPPs from four mice were seperately pooled, and samples of total RNA were isolated for sequencing ( Figure 3 D). Principal component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that treatment with MTP 10 -HDL treatment causes a transcriptional shift in a wide range of genes ( Figures S4 J and S4K). Pathway analysis performed on both HSC and MPP data demonstrated that genes associated with innate immune function were significantly upregulated as well as several pathways associated with metabolic rewiring. By contrast, pathways involved in the adaptive immune system and B cell activation were overrepresented in the downregulated genes ( Figures S4 L and S4M).
The trained immunity-induced epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in HSCs and MPPs result in a myeloid cell production bias. To study myelopoiesis in detail, we first treated three groups of C57BL/6 mice with either PBS, bare HDL, or MTP 10 -HDL and concurrently injected them with the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a compound that incorporates into DNA during replication and is used to study cellular proliferation rates. Flow cytometry analyses revealed significantly more BrdU-positive HSCs and MPPs, with increases of 259% (p = 0.0021) and 168% (p = 0.0003), respectively, in the MTP 10 -HDL-treated mice compared to PBS-treated mice ( Figure 4 A). These increased proliferation rates resulted in elevated MPP and HSC counts ( Figure 4 B) and increased numbers of the progenitor subsets MPP3 and MPP4 in MTP 10 -HDL-treated mice as compared to controls ( Figures 4 C and S5 A).
Interestingly, we also found higher granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) numbers (PBS: 6.8 × 10 4 ± 0.6 × 10 4 cells/femur; MTP 10 -HDL: 9.0 × 10 4 ± 0.8 × 10 4 cells/femur, p = 0.0401) ( Figures 4 C and S5 B), which likely results in an elevated monocyte count. To confirm this, we harvested bone marrow from femurs and tibia and quantified monocytes. This revealed that MTP 10 -HDL treatment significantly increased monocyte and neutrophil counts as compared to control ( Figure 4 D). Treatment with bare HDL did not result in significant changes in cell populations as compared to PBS, confirming that the observed myelopoietic response is MTP/NOD2 mediated ( Figures S5 C, S5D, and S5E).
After establishing increased myelopoiesis, we assessed the training state of bone marrow cells following MTP 10 -HDL treatment by determining inflammatory cytokine production following ex vivo LPS re-stimulation. Mice were treated with MTP 10 -HDL or PBS after which bone marrow was harvested at days five, seven, and eleven. Bone marrow cells were plated and subsequently re-stimulated with LPS. We found elevated expression of TNF-α (p = 0.0148) and IL-6 (p = 0.0317) upon LPS restimulation at day five, thus confirming MTP 10 -HDL’s training capabilities ( Figure 4 E).
In summary, we demonstrated MTP 10 -HDL’s ability to inhibit tumor growth by engaging bone marrow progenitors in vivo and enhancing their proliferation and metabolism, thereby resulting in higher levels of myeloid cells with increased cytokine response upon heterologous stimulation, a phenotype associated with the induction of trained immunity.
Our in-depth analysis of MTP 10 -HDL treatment’s action mechanism revealed increased epigenetic rewiring underlying heightened expression of genes that regulate proliferation and glycolysis of HSC and myeloid cell progenitors in the bone marrow. These cells’ resulting increased proliferative activity induced myelopoiesis. At a systems level, we studied myeloid cells in vivo using CD11b-specific nanobodies radiolabeled with 89 Zr to generate the 89 Zr-CD11b-Nb radiotracer for immuno-PET imaging ( Rashidian et al., 2017 48. Rashidian, M. ∙ Ingram, J.R. ∙ Dougan, M. ... Predicting the response to CTLA-4 blockade by longitudinal noninvasive monitoring of CD8 T cells J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2243-2255 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 melanomas were treated with MTP 10 -HDL or PBS, while at day seven or fourteen, the animals were administered 89 Zr- CD11b-Nb ( Figure 5 A). Twenty-four hours after receiving 89 Zr-CD11b-Nb administration, mice underwent PET/CT imaging ( Figure 5 B). We found a significantly higher SUV in the spleen one day post-treatment (day eight) (SUV max MTP 10 -HDL: 2.9 ± 0.4; PBS: 1.8 ± 0.3, p = 0.0079) ( Figure 5 C). Bone marrow image analysis showed a trend toward increased CD11b + cells at day eight (SUV max MTP 10 -HDL: 1.6 ± 0.2; PBS: 1.5 ± 0.2, p = 0.1508), which became significant at day 15 (SUV max MTP 10 -HDL: 4.2 ± 0.3; PBS: 3.6 ± 0.2, p = 0.0079).
These results combined with our transplantation study show that MTP 10 -HDL treatment modulates the myeloid compartment resulting in tumor growth inhibition. Therefore, we excised B16F10 tumors after the last MTP 10 -HDL treatment and isolated the immune cells for further flow cytometric analysis. Although we found a decrease of the monocyte population relative to the myeloid cells with a concurrent increase of neutrophils, their absolute numbers did not change ( Figures 5 D and S5 F).
To study innate and adaptive immunity’s contributions to the anti-tumor effect, we performed experiments in C57BL/6 Rag-1 knockout ( Rag1 −/− ) mice that lack mature T cells and B cells. Although we observed a significantly smaller mean tumor size in the MTP 10 -HDL-treated group as compared to the PBS-treated control group at day 10 (p = 0.0039) ( Figure 5 E), the tumor growth rates did not differ significantly (p = 0.0874). This demonstrates that myeloid cell activation is crucial for the observed anti-tumor effects, but optimal therapeutic activity requires engagement with adaptive immune cells.
In order to explore this, we investigated MTP 10 -HDL’s ability to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapy ( Anderson et al., 2017 3.

To that aim, we performed an extensive comparative tumor growth study in C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 melanoma. Seven days after 1 × 10 5 tumor cell injections, when established tumors were present, mice were randomized and allocated one of seven treatment groups. The seven treatment groups consisted of one MTP 10 -HDL monotherapy group, three checkpoint inhibitor groups (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or the combination anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4), and three groups in which MTP 10 -HDL treatment was combined with the three different checkpoint inhibitor regimens. Checkpoint inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 200 μg, twice a week, starting at day two of the experiment ( Figure 5 F). The primary focus in these experiments was to compare checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy offered alone versus in combination with our trained immunity-inducing MTP 10 -HDL therapy.
Anti-PD-1 monotherapy displayed a small anti-tumor effect as compared to the PBS control (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5 G). Combining anti-PD-1 with MTP 10 -HDL treatment displayed a significantly lower tumor growth rate than anti-PD-1 monotherapy (p = 0.0161). We did not observe anti-tumor effects for anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy, but the combination with MTP 10 -HDL treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth rate (p = 0.0090) ( Figure 5 H). Most interestingly, while anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 treatment did not show any anti-tumor effects, combining it with MTP 10 -HDL strongly suppressed tumor growth rate (p = 0.0048) ( Figure 5 I). At day nine, the mean tumor volume was half that of PBS- and anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4-treated mice (MTP 10 -HDL and anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4: 382 ± 62 mm 3 ; PBS: 822 ± 161 mm 3 , p < 0.0001). Finally, and motivated by a good MTP 10 -HDL tolerability, one group of mice received six MTP 10 -HDL injections, combined with anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 treatment. This resulted in a more than eightfold reduction in mean tumor volume, as compared to control, at day nine (MTP 10 -HDL: 95 ± 49 mm 3 ; PBS: 822 ± 161 mm 3 , p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5 I).
After establishing that MTP 10 -HDL treatment rebalances the immune cell populations in the bone marrow and the spleen, a change that suppresses tumor growth and primes the immune system’s susceptibility to checkpoint blockade therapy, we used flow cytometry to further examine leukocyte population changes. Tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice were treated with either PBS, MTP 10 -HDL monotherapy, anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4, or combined MTP 10 -HDL and anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4. We focused on the latter group because anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 treatment had no effect on tumor growth, but combining it with MTP 10 -HDL resulted in a strong anti-tumor response. At day five, animals were sacrificed, and single cell suspensions were generated from several tissues, i.e., bone marrow, tumor, blood, and spleen. We employed an extensive multicolor flow cytometry panel that combined myeloid cell markers, including CD11b, Ly6G, and F4/80, as well as T and B lymphocyte markers, including CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD45R (B220). The resulting high-dimensional dataset was visualized using the viSNE algorithm, while we used unsupervised clustering to group the cells in phenotypically distinct subsets in a truly unbiased fashion ( Figures 6 A and 6B).
Using this method, we observed that MTP 10 -HDL immunotherapy, as a monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4 treatment, significantly increased the myeloid cell compartment in the bone marrow, spleen, and blood ( Figures 6 C, 6D, and S6 ), which is in line with the activation of HSCs and myeloid-biased progenitors, reported in Figures 4 A and 4B.
Concurrently, we focused on analyzing tumor leukocyte subpopulations changes that result from the different treatments ( Figures 6 E–6G). Importantly, the regimens involving MTP 10 -HDL treatment lowered the amount TAMs ( Figure 6 H). The reduction in this population is likely one of the underlying mechanisms for MTP 10 -HDL’s anti-tumor effects and its ability to prime the immune system for effective checkpoint blockade therapy.
Compared to humans, mice are much more resilient to immunostimulation, which can hinder the translation of newly developed immunotherapies ( Warren et al., 2010 58. Warren, H.S. ∙ Fitting, C. ∙ Hoff, E. ... Resilience to bacterial infection: difference between species could be due to proteins in serum J. Infect. Dis. 2010; 201 :223-232 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ). Non-human primates are widely considered to be a superior model to investigate the toxicity profile and biodistribution of immunotherapies ( Hérodin et al., 2005 16. Hérodin, F. ∙ Thullier, P. ∙ Garin, D. ... Nonhuman primates are relevant models for research in hematology, immunology and virology Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2005; 16 :104-116 PubMed Google Scholar ; Lameijer et al., 2018 24. Lameijer, M. ∙ Binderup, T. ∙ van Leent, M.M.T. ... Efficacy and safety assessment of a TRAF6-targeted nanoimmunotherapy in atherosclerotic mice and non-human primates Nat. Biomed. Eng. 2018; 2 :279-292 Crossref Scopus (101) PubMed Google Scholar ). We therefore injected two non-human primates with 89 Zr-labeled MTP 10 -HDL and subjected them to full-body PET with magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) to study biodistribution in vivo and non-invasively. Following intravenous 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL administration, dynamic PET/MR imaging ( Figure 7 A) showed fast bone marrow and spleen accumulation, as well as liver uptake ( Figure 7 B). At 48 h post-injection, we did not observe 89 Zr -MTP 10 -HDL uptake in vital organs such as the brain. Similar to what we observed in mice, 89 Zr -MTP 10 -HDL was found predominantly accumulated in the bone marrow and spleen to relatively favorable levels as compared to the liver ( Figures 7 C and 7D).
Simultaneously, blood was collected at three different time points to assess toxicity. The first hour following 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL injection, non-human primates were monitored for hemodynamic instability. No significant changes in heart frequency or electrocardiogram were observed. Blood chemistry revealed acceptable changes in alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating that MTP 10 -HDL treatment is well tolerated ( Koo et al., 2019 22. Koo, B.-S. ∙ Lee, D.-H. ∙ Kang, P. ... Reference values of hematological and biochemical parameters in young-adult cynomolgus monkey ( Macaca fascicularis ) and rhesus monkey ( Macaca mulatta ) anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride Lab. Anim. Res. 2019; 35 :7 Crossref Scopus (39) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 7 E). Collectively, these results indicate that the biodistribution and toxicity profile of MTP 10 -HDL treatment were very similar in mice and non-human primates, underlining the translational potential of our nanobiologic immunotherapy.

Section: Discussion

In this study, we showed that inducing trained immunity with a bone marrow-avid nanoimmunotherapeutic potently suppresses tumor growth and primes the immune system’s responsiveness to checkpoint blockade therapy. Although immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, the currently available approaches have several major limitations. For example, single-agent checkpoint blockade therapy benefits only a small fraction of patients and is associated with severe adverse effects ( Sharma and Allison, 2015 52. Sharma, P. ∙ Allison, J.P. The future of immune checkpoint therapy Science. 2015; 348 :56-61 Crossref Scopus (3636) PubMed Google Scholar ). Numerous immunotherapy combination trials seeking to overcome these challenges are now underway ( Tang et al., 2018 55. Tang, J. ∙ Shalabi, A. ∙ Hubbard-Lucey, V.M. Comprehensive analysis of the clinical immuno-oncology landscape Ann. Oncol. 2018; 29 :84-91 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (400) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many of these strategies focus solely on T cell responses and are not designed to concurrently engage the innate immune system. For example, bladder cancer treatment with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) may be mediated through trained immunity, a process based on epigenetic reprogramming of myeloid cells ( Buffen et al., 2014 8. Buffen, K. ∙ Oosting, M. ∙ Quintin, J. ... Autophagy controls BCG-induced trained immunity and the response to intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 :e1004485 Crossref Scopus (176) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012 21. Kleinnijenhuis, J. ∙ Quintin, J. ∙ Preijers, F. ... Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109 :17537-17542 Crossref Scopus (1190) PubMed Google Scholar ), leading to ameliorated lymphocyte responses by augmented antigen presentation ( Leentjens et al., 2015 27. Leentjens, J. ∙ Kox, M. ∙ Stokman, R. ... BCG Vaccination Enhances the Immunogenicity of Subsequent Influenza Vaccination in Healthy Volunteers: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Pilot Study J. Infect. Dis. 2015; 212 :1930-1938 Crossref Scopus (185) PubMed Google Scholar ). Therefore, it was proposed that trained immunity-based treatments amplify the capabilities of checkpoint inhibition ( Netea et al., 2017 40. Netea, M.G. ∙ Joosten, L.A.B. ∙ van der Meer, J.W.M. Hypothesis: stimulation of trained immunity as adjunctive immunotherapy in cancer J. Leukoc. Biol. 2017; 102 :1323-1332 Crossref Scopus (33) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Our approach aims to specifically modulate the innate immune system by inducing trained immunity, which causes the tumor microenvironment to shift from an immunosuppressive to a pro-inflammatory anti-tumor state. Several key findings in this study elucidate the mechanisms behind this shift. We found that MTP 10 -HDL’s anti-tumor effect is transferable through bone marrow transplantation, which indicates that its therapeutic action originates from HSC and MPP engagement. In this experiment, tumor cells were inoculated 6 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, indicative of the durability of trained immunity induction.
MTP 10 -HDL treatment causes epigenetic rewiring of HSC and MPP and results in increased myelopoiesis, which is a hallmark of trained immunity ( Figure 3 ) ( Mitroulis et al., 2018 33. Mitroulis, I. ∙ Ruppova, K. ∙ Wang, B. ... Modulation of Myelopoiesis Progenitors Is an Integral Component of Trained Immunity Cell. 2018; 172 :147-161.e12 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (669) PubMed Google Scholar ). Through advanced imaging techniques, we found the trained immunity-induced myelopoiesis causes a systemwide increase of myeloid cells that is both rapid and durable ( Figures 5 B and 5C). We hypothesize that the elevation in trained monocytes boosts antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment (signal 1). Furthermore, our results show that myeloid cell hyperresponsiveness, another hallmark of trained immunity, raises cytokine production in vitro and in vivo (signal 3) ( Figures 1 F and 4 E), an effect we expect also occurs within the tumor microenvironment. Together, these factors likely enhance the effect of checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (signal 2, Figures 5 F–5I). Another aspect of carcinogenesis is the presence of immunosuppressive cells, like TAMs ( Mantovani et al., 2008 31. Mantovani, A. ∙ Allavena, P. ∙ Sica, A. ... Cancer-related inflammation Nature. 2008; 454 :436-444 Crossref Scopus (8864) PubMed Google Scholar ), in the tumor immune microenvironment ( DeNardo and Ruffell, 2019 11. DeNardo, D.G. ∙ Ruffell, B. Macrophages as regulators of tumour immunity and immunotherapy Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2019; 19 :369-382 Crossref Scopus (1395) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flow cytometry analyses showed that MTP 10 -HDL treatment significantly shrank the TAM populations ( Figures 5 D and 6 H), a result that benefits checkpoint inhibitor treatment ( Sharma et al., 2017 53. Sharma, P. ∙ Hu-Lieskovan, S. ∙ Wargo, J.A. ... Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy Cell. 2017; 168 :707-723 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (3421) PubMed Google Scholar ). The latter changes, combined with increasing myelopoiesis by inducing trained immunity, are likely the immunological driving force behind the dramatic tumor growth suppression. Numerous other tumor types, such as glioblastoma multiforme and pancreatic cancer ( Lim et al., 2018 29. Lim, M. ∙ Xia, Y. ∙ Bettegowda, C. ... Current state of immunotherapy for glioblastoma Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2018; 15 :422-442 Crossref Scopus (863) PubMed Google Scholar ; Neoptolemos et al., 2018 37. Neoptolemos, J.P. ∙ Kleeff, J. ∙ Michl, P. ... Therapeutic developments in pancreatic cancer: current and future perspectives Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2018; 15 :333-348 Crossref Scopus (760) PubMed Google Scholar ), exhibit an immunoparalyzed or “cold” TME and are therefore insensitive to immunotherapy. The combination of innate immune activation through trained immunity may be used to treat these malignancies, particularly in combination with checkpoint inhibition.
Our carefully designed nanobiologic platform comprises surface-functionalized HDL-based nanodiscs, which are inherently biocompatible and exhibit high in vivo tolerability. The safety of unfunctionalized reconstituted HDL has been established in cardiovascular disease trials ( Tardif et al., 2014 56. Tardif, J.C. ∙ Ballantyne, C.M. ∙ Barter, P. ..., Can HDL Infusions Significantly QUicken Atherosclerosis REgression (CHI-SQUARE) Investigators Effects of the high-density lipoprotein mimetic agent CER-001 on coronary atherosclerosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes: a randomized trial Eur. Heart J. 2014; 35 :3277-3286 Crossref Scopus (212) PubMed Google Scholar ). MDP and MTP, the incorporated trained immunity compounds, are also well tolerated, and their toxicity profiles are well studied ( Ogawa et al., 2011 41. Ogawa, C. ∙ Liu, Y.J. ∙ Kobayashi, K.S. Muramyl dipeptide and its derivatives: peptide adjuvant in immunological disorders and cancer therapy Curr. Bioact. Compd. 2011; 7 :180-197 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ). Monotherapy with MTP 10 -HDL did not affect renal function ( Figure S4 B), body weight, behavior, and macroscopic features ( Langford et al., 2010 25. Langford, D.J. ∙ Bailey, A.L. ∙ Chanda, M.L. ... Coding of facial expressions of pain in the laboratory mouse Nat. Methods. 2010; 7 :447-449 Crossref Scopus (1019) PubMed Google Scholar ). While PET imaging displayed liver accumulation, no toxicity was observed in blood chemistry, and the liver remained morphologically unaltered ( Figures S4 B and S4C). MTP 10 -HDL biodistribution and toxicity were also monitored in non-human primates. Importantly, a similar favorable safety profile was recorded in this translational model. We therefore foresee a direct pathway to clinical translation.
The platform’s flexibility enables the inclusion of different MDP/MTP surface payloads, thus allowing the creation of a trained immunity-promoting nanobiologic library ( Tang et al., 2016 54. Tang, J. ∙ Baxter, S. ∙ Menon, A. ... Immune cell screening of a nanoparticle library improves atherosclerosis therapy Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :E6731-E6740 Crossref Scopus (96) PubMed Google Scholar ). Based on a comprehensive screen that simultaneously integrates stability measurements, in vitro trained immunity assays, and in vivo biodistribution studies, we selected MTP 10 -HDL as the lead candidate. We analyzed MTP 10 -HDL’s potent anti-tumor properties using a broad approach that integrated RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and a variety of in vivo imaging modalities. The acquired insights into MTP 10 -HDL’s anti-tumor mechanism motivated us to combine it with checkpoint inhibition. We found the combination regimen results in an augmented anti-tumor immune response. Our study paves the way for exploiting trained immunity induction as an in vivo cell therapy to treat cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with other immunotherapeutics.
Based on bone marrow transplantation studies, we concluded that MTP 10 -HDL therapy has a durable anti-tumor effect. However, an extensive longitudinal epigenetic and immunological profiling follow-up study is warranted. This study would entail the transplantation of MTP 10 -HDL-treated and untreated bone marrow cells into radiated recipient mice. At different time points the recipient bone marrow should be investigated to untangle trained immunity’s durability, its dynamics and how long it exerts anti-tumor effects. The current study focuses on MTP 10 -HDL treatment’s effects on tumor growth using a B16F10 mouse melanoma model. This model is widely used in cancer immunotherapy research and is known to be resistant to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Clinically, melanomas in general are immunogenic tumors. We therefore started exploring MTP 10 -HDL treatment’s effects on tumors with lower immunogenicity. MTP 10 -HDL treatment can be employed as an anti-tumor monotherapy and has great potential sensitizing less immunogenic tumors to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The non-human primate data demonstrate that MTP 10 -HDL avidity for hematopoietic organs is preserved across species and displays a favorable safety profile, paving the way for clinical translation.

Female C57BL/6 and B6.129S7- Rag1 tm1Mom /J ( Rag1 −/− ) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and VU University Medical Center Dierexperimentencommissie (DEC) guidelines as well as Dutch requirements and laws on animal experimentation. Mice were co-housed and allowed to acclimate to the housing facility for at least 1 week. All mice had free access to food and water and were randomly assigned to experimental groups.
7-week-old female C57BL/6 and Rag1 −/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice weight was 17 to 21 g. For tumor experiments, 1x10 5 tumor cells in 100 μL PBS supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were injected subcutaneously in the flank on day −7. On day 0, mice were randomized and treatment began. For the dose response experiment, treatment consisted of 1, 2, or 3 intravenous injections of either 0.375 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg MTP 10 -HDL on day 0, 2, and 4 and a control group consisting of intravenous PBS treatment. In addition to a PBS treated group in the dose response experiment and bone marrow flow cytometry experiments, another control group consisted of mice that were treated with nonfunctional HDL nanobiologics. In a separate experiment, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 3 doses at 1.5 mg/kg MTP 10 -HDL. MTP 10 -HDL treatment for all other experiments consisted of 3 doses of 1.5 mg/kg MTP 10 -HDL on day 0, 2, and 4. One treatment arm comprised an extended MTP 10 -HDL treatment regimen with six injections of 1.5 mg/kg MTP 10 -HDL. For experiments involving checkpoint inhibition therapy, checkpoint inhibitors were injected intraperitoneally twice a week using doses of 200 μg anti-CTLA-4 (clone, 9H10, BioXcell) and/or 200 μg anti-PD-1 (clone, RMP1-14, BioXcell). Treatment started at day 2 and continued until the end of the experiment. Tumors were measured daily by caliper and tumor volume was calculated as (width x width x height) x 0.52. At time of sacrifice for analysis, mice were euthanized using CO 2 and underwent subsequent cervical dislocation.
For bone marrow transplantation experiments, 7-week-old female C57BL/6 were treated with 3 injections of either PBS or MTP 10 -HDL, as described above, and bone marrow was harvested after the last injection. In the first experiment, mice received a radiation dose of two times 600 cGy and were subsequently injected with the harvested bone marrow. After 6 weeks, mice received a subcutaneous injection of 1x10 5 tumor cells in 100 μL PBS supplemented with 0.5% FBS. For the second experiment, non-radiated mice received an injection of the harvested bone marrow and received a subcutaneous injection of 1x10 5 tumor cells in 100 μL PBS supplemented with 0.5% FBS the following day. Tumor growth was measured daily, in a blinded fashion.
Two adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were used for the non-human primate studies. The weight of the animals was 6.4 and 9.84 kg, respectively. Monkeys were pair-housed when possible in climate-controlled conditions with 12 h light/dark cycles. Monkeys were provided water ad libitum and fed Teklad Global 20% Protein Primate Diet.
The B16F10-Fluc-Neo/eGFP-Puro cell line was purchased from Imanis Life Sciences and the B16F10 murine melanoma cell line was kindly provided by Dr. I.J. Fidler (Houston, TX). Both the B16F10-Fluc-Neo/eGFP-Puro cell line and B16F10 cell line are male derived. B16F10 murine melanoma cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycine (P/S). B16F10-Fluc-Neo/eGFP-Puro murine melanoma cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.8 mg/mL G418 (Invivogen), 1 μg/mL puromycin (Invivogen), and 1% P/S. Harvested murine bone marrow cells and isolated monocytes of female mice were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI)(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, 20 mM HEPES (GIBCO), L-glutamine (GIBCO), and MEM Non-essential amino acids (Milipore Sigma).
1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) was obtained from Avanti Lipids. All dyes were obtained from Thermo-Scientific. apoA1 was isolated from human HDL concentrate from Biosource Technology and purified as previously reported ( Braza et al., 2018 5. Braza, M.S. ∙ van Leent, M.M.T. ∙ Lameijer, M. ... Inhibiting Inflammation with Myeloid Cell-Specific Nanobiologics Promotes Organ Transplant Acceptance Immunity. 2018; 49 :819-828.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Vivaspin tubes were obtained from Sartorius Biotech and PD-10 columns were purchased from General Electric (Sephadex G-25 M). A 150 V/T ultrasonic homogenizer working at 70% power output was used for tip sonication. DLS measurements were performed on a Brookhaven Instrument Corporation ZetaPALS analyzer. 89 Zr oxalate was made at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center using an EBCO TR19/9 variable beam energy cyclotron using the 89 Y(p,n) 89 Zr reaction and purified using a method from the literature ( Holland et al., 2009 17. Holland, J.P. ∙ Sheh, Y. ∙ Lewis, J.S. Standardized methods for the production of high specific-activity zirconium-89 Nucl. Med. Biol. 2009; 36 :729-739 Crossref Scopus (354) PubMed Google Scholar ). SEC radio-HPLC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu system equipped with a Superdex 10/300 SEC column using a flow rate of 1 mL/min and demiwater as the eluent. A Lablogic Scan-RAM radio-TLC/HPLC detector was used. Dialysis experiments were performed using 10 kDa Slide-a-Lyzer dialysis cassettes from Thermo-Scientific.
1,2-dimyristoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC, 5 mg, 7.37 μmol), cholesterol (0.57 mg, 1.47 μmol), and MTP-PE (Mifamurtide) (0.91 mg, 0.74 μmol) were dissolved in chloroform (2 mL) and placed in a 20 mL vial. Chloroform was evaporated under vacuum to form a thin lipid film, to which apoA1 (2 mg) and PBS (5 mL) were added and the mixture sonicated using an ultrasonic bath for 5 min, followed by incubation at 37°C for 20 min. The opaque solution was sonicated using a tip sonicator for 30 min while cooling in an ice-water bath. The transparent solution was transferred to a 10kDa MWCO Vivaspin tube and centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4°C until a volume of ~1 mL remained. PBS (1 mL) was added and the tube was again centrifuged until 1 mL remained; this was repeated twice. The resulting solution was filtered using a 0.22 μm PES syringe filter to obtain the finished MTP 10 -HDL particles.
For the particles with other DMPC and MTP-PE/L 18- MDP or cholesterol molar ratios the same method was used with the corresponding amounts of MTP-PE or cholesterol incorporated in the lipid mix. To include DiLC 18 (3) and DiOC 18 (3) dyes in the nanobiologics, 0.5 mg of the desired dye was dissolved in the chloroform solution used to prepare the lipid film. To prepare the DFO- 89 Zr radiolabeled nanobiologics, 50 μg of DPSE-DFO, made according to a procedure from the literature ( Pérez-Medina et al., 2014 45. Pérez-Medina, C. ∙ Abdel-Atti, D. ∙ Zhang, Y. ... A modular labeling strategy for in vivo PET and near-infrared fluorescence imaging of nanoparticle tumor targeting J. Nucl. Med. 2014; 55 :1706-1711 Crossref Scopus (83) PubMed Google Scholar ), was incorporated in the lipid film.
A solution of 89 Zr oxalate in 1M oxalic acid was neutralized using a 1M sodium carbonate solution until a pH between 6.8-7.4 was reached. The 89 Zr solution was added to the DSPE-DFO-containing nanobiologics and incubated at 37°C using a thermomixer (600 rpm) for 30-60 min. The resulting solution was purified using a PD-10 column with PBS as eluent. The radiolabeled nanobiologics’ radiochemical purity was typically over 95%, as assessed by SEC radio-HPLC.
Particle size was determined using a ZetaPALS analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation). An aliquot (10 μL) of the purified nanobiologic solution was diluted with PBS (1 mL), filtered using a 0.22 μm PES syringe filter, and analyzed by dynamic light scattering to determine the mean of the number average size distribution.
The MTP-PE or L 18 -MDP concentration in the nanobiologic solutions was determined using a colorimetric assay to detect N-acetylglucosamine, as reported by Reissig et al. ( Reissig et al., 1955 50. Reissig, J.L. ∙ Storminger, J.L. ∙ Leloir, L.F. A modified colorimetric method for the estimation of N-acetylamino sugars J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217 :959-966 Full Text (PDF) PubMed Google Scholar ). Calibrants containing muramyl dipeptide (0-100 μg/mL) in PBS were made. Both these and the MTP 10 -HDL or L 18 -MDP-HDL solution were transferred to Eppendorf tubes (125 μL of each solution), and aqueous potassium tetraborate solution (0.8 M, 25 μL) was added. The tubes were heated at 100°C for 3 min, then allowed to cool to room temperature, and an aliquot of each tube (25 μL) was transferred to a 96-well plate. Subsequently, 150 μL of a solution containing concentrated hydrochloric acid (1.19 mL), acetic acid (10 mL), and 4-(dimethylaminobenzaldehyde) (114.3 mg) was added, at which point the solution turned purple. The well plate was incubated at 37°C for 20 min, after which the samples’ absorption was measured at 544 nm.
Release kinetics studies of L 18 -MDP and MTP-PE from HDL nanobiologics were performed. Nanobiologic solutions were loaded into dialysis bags (10,000 MWCO) and placed inside PBS (4°C), fetal bovine serum (37°C), or 10% FBS (37°C). At predetermined time points (0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min), L 18 -MDP/MTP-PE concentration was determined using the colorimetric assay described above.
C57BL/6 mice were injected with 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL nanoparticles (6.1 ± 0.2 MBq) in 150-200 μL PBS via tail-vein injection. At predetermined time points (2, 15, and 30 min, and 1, 4, 8, and 24 h) blood samples (5-10 μL) were taken, weighed, and measured for radioactivity content using a Wizard2 2480 automatic gamma counter (Perkin Elmer). Data were converted to %ID/g, plotted in a time-activity curve, and fitted using a non-linear two-phase decay regression in Prism GraphPad (GraphPad Software Inc.). Finally, a weighted blood radioactivity t 1/2 was calculated. At 24 h, animals were euthanized and extensively perfused with PBS. Tissues of interest (liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, muscle, heart, aorta, bone, and brain) were collected, blotted, and weighed before radioactivity counting on a Wizard2 2480 automatic gamma counter (Perkin Elmer,). Radioactivity values were corrected for decay and normalized to tissue weight to express radioactivity concentration as percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g).
After an overnight fast, non-human primates were anaesthetized with ketamine (5 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (0.0075–0.015 mg/kg), and blood was collected from the femoral vein. The animals were injected with 15.4 and 25.1 MBq 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL at a dose of 0.0549 mg/kg. Dynamic PET imaging was performed during the first 60 min after infusion. Additional PET/MRI scans were performed at 1 and 48 h after injection. PET and MRI images were acquired on a combined 3T PET/MRI system (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthineers). On day 1, dynamic PET imaging was performed for 60 min using one bed position covering the chest and abdomen, directly after injection with 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL. MR imaging parameters were as follows: acquisition plane, coronal; repetition time, 1,000 ms; echo time, 79 ms; number of slices, 144; number of averages, 4; spatial resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.0 mm 3 and acquisition duration, 42 min and 42 s. After dynamic PET image acquisition, static whole-body PET images were acquired from the cranium to the pelvis, using 4 consecutive bed positions of 15 min each. Simultaneously with each bed, MR images were acquired as described above, except using only 1.4 signal averages, number of slices 160, and spatial resolution 0.6 × 0.6 × 1.0 mm 3 (acquisition duration, 14 min 56 s per bed). Whole-body PET and MR imaging was also performed at 48 h after injection, using 4 PET bed positions of 30 min each, with MR parameters as follows: acquisition plane, coronal; repetition time, 1,000 ms; echo time, 79 ms; number of slices, 224; number of averages, 2; spatial resolution of 0.6 × 0.6 × 1.0 mm 3 ; acquisition duration, 29 min and 56 s. Whole-body MR images from each bed were automatically collated together by the scanner. After acquisition, PET raw data from each bed were reconstructed and collated together offline using the Siemens proprietary e7tools with an Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm with Point Spread Function (PSF) correction for 3 iterations and 24 subsets. Also, Gaussian filter of 4 mm was applied to the images. A three-compartment (soft tissue, lung and air) attenuation map was used for attenuation.
Non-tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed 6 and 24 h after injection with MTP 10 -HDL or PBS. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min. Serum was collected and TNF-α levels were measured by ELISA. Spleen and livers were harvested and frozen directly in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura), and stored at –80°C in preparation for staining. Sections of 8mm were cut using a Leica 1900CM cryomicrotome. Liver and spleens were stained with H&E. Images were taken on a Zeiss AxioImager Z2M.
In non-human primates, blood was collected before and at 1.5 and 48 h after 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL infusion. The collected blood was centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min. Serum was analyzed with a Beckman AU680 chemistry analyzer.
Tissues were placed in a film cassette against a phosphorimaging plate (BASMS-2325, Fujifilm) at −20°C to determine the radioactivity distribution. The plates were read at a pixel resolution of 25 μm with a Typhoon 7000IP plate reader (GE Healthcare).
Mice received a single intravenous injection with DiI-MTP 10 -HDL. 24 h later, mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected for NIRF imaging. Fluorescent images were acquired using an IVIS 200 system (Xenogen), with an 11 s exposure time, using a 535 nm excitation filter and a 580 nm emission filter.
Vitrified thin films for CryoTEM analysis containing MTP 10 -HDL nanoparticles were prepared using an automated vitrification robot (FEI Vitrobot Mark III) by plunge vitrification in liquid ethane. Before vitrification, a 200-mesh copper grid covered with a Quantifoil R 2/2 holey carbon film (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH) was surface plasma treated for 40 seconds using a Cressington 208 carbon coater. CryoTEM imaging was performed with the Eindhoven University of Technology/FEI cryoTITAN equipped with a field emission gun (FEG), a post-column Gatan energy filter (GIF) and a post-GIF 2k × 2k Gatan charge-coupled-device camera. The microscope was operated at 300 kV acceleration voltage in zero-loss energy filtering mode at a nominal magnification of 24.000 × and at a dose rate of 4.5 electrons/A 2 ·s with a 1 s image acquisition time. Representative CryoTEM micrographs show the presence of disc shaped nanoparticles in random orientations which show the highest contrast when viewed edge on resembling a line.
All human primary cells were isolated from healthy male and female volunteers who gave written informed consent (Sanquin Blood Bank). PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare), washed three times in PBS, and resuspended in culture medium (RPMI) (GIBCO) supplemented with 5 μg/mL gentamicin (Centraform), 2mM L-glutamin (GIBCO), and 1mM pyruvate (GIBCO). Percoll monocytes were isolated by layering hyper-osmotic Percoll solution (48,5% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich)), 41,5% sterile H2O, 0.16M filter sterilized NaCl) on PBMCs. After 15 min of centrifugation at 580 x g, the interphase layer was isolated, and then cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in culture medium. To increase the purity of Percoll-isolated monocytes, the monocytes were adhered to polystyrene flat bottom plates (Corning) for 1 h at 37°C followed by washing with warm PBS. Next, cells were pre-incubated with culture medium supplemented with 10% human pooled serum together with the nanobiologics for 1 h. Subsequently, culture medium supplemented with 10% human pooled serum added as a control or combined with either 2 μg/mL β-glucan, 10 μg/mL Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), or 5 μg/mL muramyl dipeptide (MDP). After 24 h, cells were washed with warm PBS and culture medium was added. After 3 days, culture medium was refreshed. On day 6, cells were restimulated with RPMI (GIBCO) or LPS (10 ng/mL)(Sigma Aldrich). After 24 h, supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C until further use.
Bone marrow was flushed with PBS from the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon), incubated with Red Blood Cell (RBC) Lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 30 s, and washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were resuspended in complex RPMI (GIBCO) medium supplemented with 50 mL FBS and 5 mL Pen-Strep, 5 mL L-Glutamine solution (GIBCO), 5 mL MEM Non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), and 5 mL HEPES buffer (GIBCO) substituted with recombinant GM-CSF (20 ng/mL) and IL-4 (20 ng/mL) (both Peprotech), counted, and plated in a 96 well flat bottom plate (50.000 cells/well). Cells were cultured for 3 days, after which medium was refreshed and cells were cultured another 3 days. Cells were stimulated with β-glucan (Sigma Aldrich), free MDP, empty HDL, or nanobiologic (0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μM) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were washed with 200 uL PBS and fresh medium was added. After 48 h, cells were restimulated with LPS (10 ng/mL)(Sigma Aldrich) for 24 h. Supernatant was collected after 24 h and stored at −80°C until further use.
Non tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed 1, 3, or 7 days after treatment. In sterile conditions, femur and tibia were removed and bone marrow was flushed out. Bone marrow cells were incubated with RBC Lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 4 min, washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS, and subsequently resuspended in complex RPMI (GIBCO) . Total cell numbers were determined and diluted to 7.5 × 10 5 cells per mL. Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 10 6 cells per well and left to adhere for 1 h at 37°C. LPS (Sigma Aldrich) was added to a concentration of 10 ng/mL. Supernatant was collected after 24 h and stored at −80°C until further use.
Human monocytes were isolated by using Percoll solution as described above, and 10x10 6 cells were seeded into 10 cm Petri dishes (Corning). Cells were trained as described above. On day 6, cells were harvested and cross-linked in methanol free 1% formaldehyde, followed by sonication and immunoprecipitation using 1ug of antibody against H3K4me3 (Diagenode). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was processed further for qRT-PCR analysis using MiniElute DNA purification kit (QIAGEN). The primes used are listed below. Samples were measured on StepOne PLUS qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR green (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruction. The following primers were used: IL-1β-1 FW: AATCCCAGAGCAGCCTGTTG; RV: AACAGCGAGGGAGAAACTGG; IL-1β-2 FW: CATGGCTGCTTCAGACACCT; RV: ACACATGAACGTAGCCGTCA; Myoglobulin FW: AGCATGGTGCCACTGTGCT; RV: GGCTTAATCTCTGCCTCATGAT; GAPDH FW: CCCCGGTTTCTATAAATTGAGC; RV: AAGAAGATGCGGCTGACTGT; TNF-1 FW: CAGGCAGGTTCTCTTCCTCT; RV: GCTTTCAGTGCTCATGGTGT; TNF-2 FW: GTGCTTGTTCCTCAGCCTCT; RV: ATCACTCCAAAGTGCAGCAG; IL-6-1 FW: AGGGAGAGCCAGAACACAGA; RV: GAGTTTCCTCTGACTCCATCG; IL-6-2 FW: TCGTGCATGACTTCAGCTTT; RV: GCGCTAAGAAGCAGAACCAC;
Cytokine production was determined in supernatants using commercial ELISA (ThermoFisher Scientific and R&D Systems, MN, USA) ELISA kits for human or mouse TNF-α and IL-6, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Sample absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a GloMax-Multi+ plate reader (Promega). Analyses were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Luminex assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ProcartaPlex ThermoFisher) on the Luminex Magpix Instrument.
CD11b single-domain antibody fragments were generously gifted to us by Rashidian and Ploegh ( Rashidian et al., 2017 48. Rashidian, M. ∙ Ingram, J.R. ∙ Dougan, M. ... Predicting the response to CTLA-4 blockade by longitudinal noninvasive monitoring of CD8 T cells J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214 :2243-2255 Crossref Scopus (178) PubMed Google Scholar ). Nanobodies were radiolabeled similarly to the nanobiologics. A solution of 89 Zr oxalate in 1M oxalic acid was neutralized using a 1M sodium carbonate solution until a pH between 6.8-7.4 was reached. The 89 Zr solution was added to the nanobodies in PBS and incubated at 25°C using a thermomixer (600 rpm) for 30 min. The obtained solution was purified using a PD-10 column with PBS as eluent. The radiolabeled nanobodies’ radiochemical purity was assessed using radio-TLC with an aqueous EDTA solution (50 mM) as eluent, in which the nanobodies stayed at the baseline. A radiochemical purity of well above 95% was typically obtained.
For 18 FDG /PET, tumor-free C57BL/6 mice were fasted for 8 h before injection. 18 F-FDG (9.3 ± 1.1 MBq, n = 5, in 100 μL PBS solution) was administered via tail vein and allowed to circulate for 30 min before PET/CT imaging. For biodistribution studies, C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10 tumors were injected with 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL nanoparticles (6.1 ± 0.2 MBq, n = 5, in 100 μL PBS solution) via tail vein. 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL was allowed to circulate for 24 h, after which mice were imaged by PET/CT. For 89 Zr-labeled CD11b-Nb imaging, 2 groups of 5 C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10-Luc-GFP tumors were treated with either PBS or MTP 10 -HDL. At day 12, mice were intravenously injected with 89 Zr-CD11b-Nb (2.2 ± 0.2 MBq, n = 5 per group, in 100 μL PBS solution), which was allowed to circulate for 24 h.
Before the scan, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare)/oxygen gas mixture (2% for induction, 1% for maintenance) and subsequently imaged on a Mediso nanoScan PET/CT scanner (Mediso). PET/CT acquisition time was 30 min for 18 F-FDG and 89 Zr-MTP 10 -HDL experiments and 20 min for nanobody experiments. A whole-body CT scan was performed (energy 50 kVp, current 180 μAs, isotropic voxel size at 0.25 mm 3 ) followed by a PET scan. The coincidences were filtered with an energy window between 400 - 600 keV. The voxel size was isotropic, 0.6 mm 3 in width, and the reconstruction was applied for two full iterations, 6 subsets per iteration. PET data were reconstructed using CT-based attenuation correction. Reconstruction was performed using the TeraTomo 3D reconstruction algorithm from the Mediso Nucline software. Immediately after the PET/CT scan, animals were euthanized and perfused with PBS. Tissues of interest (spleen, blood, tumor, lymph nodes, and femurs) were collected, blotted, and weighed before radioactivity counting on a Wizard2 2480 automatic gamma counter (Perkin Elmer ) . Radioactivity values were corrected for decay and normalized to tissue weight to express radioactivity concentration as percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g).
Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and mice were subsequently perfused with 20 mL cold PBS. Spleen, tumor, iliac lymph nodes, and femurs were harvested. Blood was incubated with red RBC Lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 4 min and washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS. Spleens were mashed, filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon), incubated with RBC Lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 4 min, and washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS. Bone marrow was flushed out of the femur with PBS, filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon), incubated with RBC Lysis buffer (BioLegend) for 30 s, and washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS. Lymph node and tumor were pushed through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon) and washed with PBS containing 0.5% FBS.
Bone marrow cells were incubated with biotin-conjugated antibodies (all BD Bioscience): anti-Ter-119, anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-CD5 (clone 53-7.3), anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5), anti-CD8a (clone 53-6.7), anti-CD45R (clone RA3-6B2), and anti-Ly6G/C (clone RB6-8C5). Antibodies were added at a concentration of 1:100 for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and incubated with MACS streptavidin-conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi) for 30 min at 4°C. Depleting the lineage-committed cells was performed by magnetic bead separation using LS columns and MACS® Separator (both Miltenyi).
For cellular specificity, mice were injected with DiO-MTP 10 -HDL that was allowed to circulate for 24 h. Subsequently, mice were sacrificed and single cell suspensions were created from blood, spleen, bone marrow, or tumor cells as previously described. Cell suspensions were incubated with several antibody cocktail variants. Blood and spleen suspensions were incubated with anti-CD115 (clone AFS98), anti-Ly6C (clone Al-21), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-CD19 (clone 1D3), and anti-CD90.2 (clone 53-2.1).

For BrdU labeling, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 mg of BrdU (10mg/mL in PBS) at day 3 (48 h before sacrifice). Bone marrow was subsequently harvested and depleted of lineage-committed cells. The remaining cells were incubated with Streptavidin-APC-Cy7, anti-c-Kit (clone 2B8,), anti-Sca-1 (clone D7), anti-CD150 (clone mShad150), and anti-CD48 (clone HM48-1). All antibodies were added at a concentration of 1:100 and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. For BrdU flow cytometry, BrdU staining was performed using the BrdU staining kit, following manufacturer’s instructions. All data were acquired on an LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
For flow cytometry tumors were excised and weighed. Tumors were digested for 60 min at 37°C using liberase digestion buffer consisting of DNaseI (40 U/mL)(Sigma-Aldrich), Hyaluronidase (60 U/mL)(Sigma-Aldrich), Liberase TH (4 U/mL)(Roche) in PBS. After straining through a 70 μm cell strainer (BD Falcon) cells were washed and resuspended in 40% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich). An 80% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich) solution was pipetted beneath and the suspension was centrifuged for 23 min at 325 g at room temperature. Interface was collected and washed. Subsequently cells were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-Ly6C (clone AL-21), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8), anti-F4/80 (clone BM8), anti-CD3 (clone 145-2C11). All antibodies were added at a concentration of 1:100 for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. 10 μL DAPI was added for viability staining. All data were acquired on an LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Single cell suspensions of all 5 tissues noted above were stained with the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-CD117 (c-Kit)(clone 2B8), anti-Sca-1 (Ly6-A/E)(clone E13-161.7), anti-CD48 (clone HM48-1), anti-CD150 (clone TC15-12F12.2), anti-CD135 (clone A2F10), anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11), anti-CD3 (clone 17A2), anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5), anti-CD8a (clone 53-6.7), anti-CD69 (clone H1.2F3), anti-CD25 (clone 3C7), anti-CD62L (clone MEL-14), anti-CD44 (clone IM7), anti-CD45R (clone RA3-6B2), anti-CD161 (clone 2D9), anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-Ly-6C (clone HK1.4), anti-Ly-6G (clone 1A8), anti-CD11c (clone N418), anti-F4/80 (clone BM8), anti-PD-1 (clone 29F.1A12), anti-CD64 (clone AT152-9), anti-CD24 (clone M1/69), anti-MHC II (clone M5/114.15.2), and anti-Mannose Receptor (clone C068C2). All antibodies were added at a concentration of 1:100 for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. ZombieNIR (0.005mg) (BioLegend) was added for viability staining to 10 × 10 6 cells. Data were acquired on a Cytek Aurora (CytekBio).
For HSC sorting, the lineage-committed cells were depleted as described above and the remaining cells were incubated with Streptavidin-APC-Cy7, anti-c-Kit (clone 2B8), anti-Sca-1 (clone D7), anti-CD150 (clone mShad150), and anti-CD48 (clone HM48-1) (all 1:100), all of which were added and incubated at 4°C for 30 min. ZombieNIR (0.005mg) (BioLegend) was added for viability staining to 10 × 10 6 cells right before sorting on a BD FACSAria Sorter. For RNA sequencing HSCs and MPPs were collected in LoBind tubes containing 1 mL sterile PBS with 0.5% BSA (cell culture grade). Cells were subsequently spun down at 800 g at 4°C for 20 min and resuspended in 100 μL TRI reagent (Zymo Research). Samples were vortexed briefly every 3 min for a total of 15 min and stored in −80°C until RNA isolation. For ATAC-seq HSCs and MPPs were collected in 15 mL Falcon tubes containing complete RPMI medium and were used immediately for library creation.
Total RNA was isolated from HSCs and MPPs using a Direct-zol RNA Kit (Zymo Research) with DNase treatment. For HSCs RNA amplification and cDNA generation were performed using Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (NuGEN). Libraries were constructed using Ovation Ultralow V2 DNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (NuGEN). Samples were pooled and diluted to 10 nM and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina) to a depth of ± 20 million single-ended 50 bp reads. For MPPs RNA with RIN greater than 7 underwent polyA selection. Insect carrier RNA Was added to allow low-input RNA library prep. Furthermore, samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA. cDNA libraries were prepared using 50-100ng of total RNA using the Nextflex Rapid Direction RNA-Seq kit (Perkin-Elmer). cDNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Nextseq 500 platform to obtain 75-bp single-end reads.
Omni-ATAC was performed as previously described ( Corces et al., 2017 10. Corces, M.R. ∙ Trevino, A.E. ∙ Hamilton, E.G. ... An improved ATAC-seq protocol reduces background and enables interrogation of frozen tissues Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :959-962 Crossref Scopus (1214) PubMed Google Scholar ) with optimization suited for both MPP cells (50,000 per sample) and HSCs (10,000 per sample). Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 μL of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% NP40, 0.1% Tween-20, and 0.01% digitonin and allowed to lyse for 3 min on ice. After lysis, 1 mL of ATAC-seq RSB containing 0.1% Tween-20 (without NP40 or digitonin) was added, and the tubes were inverted to mix. Nuclei were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 rcf at 4°C. Nuclei were resuspended in 50 μL of transposition mix [25 μL 2 × TD buffer, transposase (1.75 uL for MPP – 1 uL for HSC), 16.5 μL PBS, 0.5 μL 1% digitonin, 0.5 μL 10% Tween-20, and water (5.75 uL for MPP – 6.5 uL for HSC)] by pipetting up and down six times. Transposition reactions were incubated at 37°C for 30 min in a thermomixer with shaking at 1,000 rpm. Reactions were cleaned with a QIAGEN MinElute Reaction Cleanup kit. The following ATAC-seq library preparation was performed as previously described ( Buenrostro et al., 2015 7. Buenrostro, J.D. ∙ Wu, B. ∙ Chang, H.Y. ... ATAC-seq: A Method for Assaying Chromatin Accessibility Genome-Wide Curr Protoc Mol Biol. 2015; 109 :21-29 Crossref Scopus (1646) PubMed Google Scholar ). Multiplexed libraries were sequenced at 4 nM on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (PE 75bp reads).
Intravital multiphoton microscopy (IVM) of B16F10 tumor-bearing mice was performed with methods similar to those in previous studies ( Patsialou et al., 2013 43. Patsialou, A. ∙ Bravo-Cordero, J.J. ∙ Wang, Y. ... Intravital multiphoton imaging reveals multicellular streaming as a crucial component of in vivo cell migration in human breast tumors Intravital. 2013; 2 :e25294 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) using an Olympus FV1000-MPE microscope with a 25X, 1.05NA water immersion objective with correction collar. Excitation at 880 nm was performed using a standard femtosecond-pulsed laser system (Mai Tai HP with DeepSee, Newport/Spectra-Physics). Red and green fluorescence and second-harmonic signals were collected simultaneously with three separate photomultiplier-tube (PMT) detectors.
To qualitatively appreciate MTP 10 -HDL particle biodistribution and uptake by immune cells homing to the tumor, mice (n = 3) were injected with DiI- MTP 10 -HDL particles labeled with red dye 8 h prior to imaging. Right before imaging, 70 kDa FITC dextran was injected to visualize vessels. For all 3 mice, B16F10 melanoma, spleen, and bone marrow were scanned in vivo and several representative images were captured. Tumor was imaged at different depths to better represent the distribution. Additionally, as control, mice (n = 3) bearing B16F10 tumor were injected with 70 kDa Texas Red dextran, known to stain tissue macrophages.
Aurora high dimensional cytometry data were visualized using viSNE and implemented using Cytobank ( Amir et al., 2013 2. Amir, E.-a.D. ∙ Davis, K.L. ∙ Tadmor, M.D. ... viSNE enables visualization of high dimensional single-cell data and reveals phenotypic heterogeneity of leukemia Nat Biotechnol. 2013; 31 :545-552 Crossref Scopus (1211) PubMed Google Scholar ; Chen and Kotecha, 2014 9. Chen, T.J. ∙ Kotecha, N. Cytobank: providing an analytics platform for community cytometry data analysis and collaboration Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2014; 377 :127-157 PubMed Google Scholar ). viSNE plots were generated separately for each tissue, incorporating all samples in concatenated files for each tissue. Single cell data were clustered within and across samples. FlowSOM clustering analyses were performed using the respective tools on Cytobank ( Van Gassen et al., 2015 57. Van Gassen, S. ∙ Callebaut, B. ∙ Van Helden, M.J. ... FlowSOM: Using self-organizing maps for visualization and interpretation of cytometry data Cytometry A. 2015; 87 :636-645 Crossref Scopus (1077) PubMed Google Scholar ). viSNE and FlowSOM analyses were performed using all markers except CD45 and Live/Dead discrimination. To generate heatmap displays, marker expression was normalized by dividing by the minimum cluster median value for each parameter. Clusters with less than 0.5% of total number of events were not displayed in the heatmaps to increase figure clarity. This cut-off was chosen to protect against population misidentification. Notably, none of these low-frequency populations were significantly modulated by checkpoint blockade treatment, and other populations’ frequencies were not altered to reflect their omission from display.
First, NextSeq adaptor sequences were trimmed from the FASTQ files with NGmerge 0.1 ( Gaspar, 2018 13. Gaspar, J.M. NGmerge: merging paired-end reads via novel empirically-derived models of sequencing errors BMC Bioinformatics. 2018; 19 :536 Crossref Scopus (115) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads were mapped to the mouse genome mm10 with bowtie2 2.2.8 ( Langmead and Salzberg, 2012 26. Langmead, B. ∙ Salzberg, S.L. Fast gapped-read alignment with Bowtie 2 Nat. Methods. 2012; 9 :357-359 Crossref Scopus (33760) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the -X 2000 setting. BAM files were subsequently filtered for MAPQ > 30 with SAMTools 1.9 ( Li et al., 2009 28. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (38835) PubMed Google Scholar ) and duplicate reads were removed with picard 2.2.4. Reads mapping to the mitochondrial genome were removed from downstream analyses. Consensus peaks for HSC and MPP samples were called separately with MACS 2.1 ( Zhang et al., 2008 61. Zhang, Y. ∙ Liu, T. ∙ Meyer, C.A. ... Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) Genome Biol. 2008; 9 :R137 Crossref Scopus (10883) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the following parameters:–nomodel–nolambda–keep-dup all–slocal 10000. The top 50% peaks sorted by the -log10(p value) reported by MACS were selected for downstream analyses. Selected peaks were annotated with ChIPseeker 1.20 ( Yu et al., 2015 59. Yu, G. ∙ Wang, L.G. ∙ He, Q.Y. ChIPseeker: an R/Bioconductor package for ChIP peak annotation, comparison and visualization Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 :2382-2383 Crossref Scopus (1977) PubMed Google Scholar ) using the TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene annotation in an R 3.6.1 environment. Differential peak accessibility between PBS and MTP 10 -HDL-treated samples was assessed with DiffBind 2.12 by comparing the number of reads mapped within ± 500bp of each peak summit using DESeq2 ( Love et al., 2014 30. Love, M.I. ∙ Huber, W. ∙ Anders, S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2 Genome Biol. 2014; 15 :550 Crossref Scopus (48397) PubMed Google Scholar ). PCA plots were generated using sklearn 0.21.3 in a Python 3.7.4 environment from a matrix containing log10(RPKM+1) and Z-score normalized values of the top 75,000 peaks ranked by the differential expression p value reported by DiffBind. Enrichment analysis was performed using g:Profiler ( Raudvere et al., 2019 49. Raudvere, U. ∙ Kolberg, L. ∙ Kuzmin, I. ... g:Profiler: a web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update) Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 :W191-W198 Crossref Scopus (3026) PubMed Google Scholar ) by submitting ENSEMBL IDs of genes annotated to differentially accessible peaks with p value < 0.05. Results from the Gene Ontology Biological Processes and Reactome libraries were reported.
Reads were aligned to the mouse genome mm10 by STAR 2.7.2a with default settings ( Dobin et al., 2013 12. Dobin, A. ∙ Davis, C.A. ∙ Schlesinger, F. ... STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 :15-21 Crossref Scopus (27042) PubMed Google Scholar ). Differential expression between PBS and MTP 10 -HDL-treated samples was assessed using the DESeq2 1.24 bioconductor package in an R 3.6.1 environment. PCA plots were generated using sklearn 0.21.3 in a Python 3.7.4 environment from a matrix containing expression levels of the top 10,000 genes ranked by the differential expression p value reported by DESeq2. Heatmaps were generated from a matrix containing expression levels of the top 2,500 genes ranked by differential expression p value. For both PCA plots and heatmaps, gene expression counts were normalized using the variance Stabilizing Transformation function from DESeq2 followed by Z-score transformation. Enrichment analysis was performed using g:Profiler by submitting ENSEMBL IDs of differentially expressed genes with p value < 0.05. Results from the Gene Ontology Biological Processes library were reported.
All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) except for tumor growth experiments where mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) is presented. Number (n) and type (biological or technical) of replicates are indicated in the figure legends. Tumor growth curves were analyzed by growth rate analysis as described by Hathers et al. ( Hather et al., 2014 15. Hather, G. ∙ Liu, R. ∙ Bandi, S. ... Growth rate analysis and efficient experimental design for tumor xenograft studies Cancer Inform. 2014; 13 :65-72 PubMed Google Scholar ). Data were tested using a two-tailed Student’s t test (when comparing two groups) or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc comparison (to test multiple groups) in GraphPad Prism version 7.0 software, as indicated in the figure legends. p values < 0.05 were considered significant, with levels of significance as follows: ∗ p < 0.05; ∗∗ p < 0.01; ∗∗∗ p < 0.001; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001; ns, not significant.
