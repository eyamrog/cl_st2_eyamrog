Title: Ensembles of endothelial and mural cells promote angiogenesis in prenatal human brain


Abstract: Summary

Interactions between angiogenesis and neurogenesis regulate embryonic brain development. However, a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell maturation is lacking, especially in the prenatal human brain. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, single-cell transcriptomics, and histological and ultrastructural analyses, we show that an ensemble of endothelial and mural cell subtypes tile the brain vasculature during the second trimester. These vascular cells follow distinct developmental trajectories and utilize diverse signaling mechanisms, including collagen, laminin, and midkine, to facilitate cell-cell communication and maturation. Interestingly, our results reveal that tip cells, a subtype of endothelial cells, are highly enriched near the ventricular zone, the site of active neurogenesis. Consistent with these observations, prenatal vascular cells transplanted into cortical organoids exhibit restricted lineage potential that favors tip cells, promotes neurogenesis, and reduces cellular stress. Together, our results uncover important mechanisms into vascular maturation during this critical period of human brain development.

Section: Introduction

The vasculature is increasingly recognized to impact brain function in health and disease ( Licht and Keshet, 2015 32. Licht, T. ∙ Keshet, E. The vascular niche in adult neurogenesis Mech. Dev. 2015; 138 :56-62 Crossref Scopus (79) PubMed Google Scholar ; Silva-Vargas et al., 2013 44. Silva-Vargas, V. ∙ Crouch, E.E. ∙ Doetsch, F. Adult neural stem cells and their niche: a dynamic duo during homeostasis, regeneration, and aging Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23 :935-942 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Endothelial and mural cells constitute the main structural and functional vascular elements. Endothelial cells form the lumen of blood vessels and also secrete factors that influence neurogenesis in the mouse brain ( Silva-Vargas et al., 2013 44. Silva-Vargas, V. ∙ Crouch, E.E. ∙ Doetsch, F. Adult neural stem cells and their niche: a dynamic duo during homeostasis, regeneration, and aging Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23 :935-942 Crossref Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). Mural cells, which include smooth muscle cells and pericytes, are located outside the endothelial cells. They are critical for the development of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neurovascular coupling ( Armulik et al., 2010 2. Armulik, A. ∙ Genové, G. ∙ Mäe, M. ...

Brain endothelial cells are thought to originate from a perineural vascular plexus external to the brain parenchyma ( Hogan et al., 2004 22. Hogan, K.A. ∙ Ambler, C.A. ∙ Chapman, D.L. ...

Neurovascular development uses VEGF-A signaling to regulate blood vessel ingression into the neural tube Development. 2009; 136 :833-841 Crossref Scopus (84) PubMed Google Scholar ), whereas the ontogeny of mural cells remains elusive ( Armulik et al., 2011 3.

Although recent results have shed light on the contributions of vascular cells to brain aging and neurodegeneration ( Garcia et al., 2022 18. Garcia, F.J. ∙ Sun, N. ∙ Lee, H. ...

A human brain vascular atlas reveals diverse mediators of Alzheimer’s risk Nature. 2022; 603 :885-892 Crossref Scopus (284) PubMed Google Scholar ), a comprehensive understanding of the stages of vascular cell development in the prenatal brain is lacking.
In the developing mouse cortex, the nascent vasculature establishes distinct regional characteristics; the neural progenitors in the ventricular zone exist in a hypoxic avascular niche while oligodendrocyte precursor cells and basal progenitors prefer a perivascular location ( Komabayashi-Suzuki et al., 2019 28. Komabayashi-Suzuki, M. ∙ Yamanishi, E. ∙ Watanabe, C. ...

In subcortical regions, physical contact between vasculature and neural progenitors regulates key aspects of differentiation. Vascular filopodia in the ganglionic eminences contact radial glia, which elongates their cell cycle and favors neuronal differentiation ( Di Marco et al., 2020 12. Di Marco, B. ∙ Crouch, E.E. ∙ Shah, B. ... Reciprocal Interaction between Vascular Filopodia and Neural Stem Cells Shapes Neurogenesis in the Ventral Telencephalon Cell Rep. 2020; 33 , 108256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Radial glia also extend fibers that are anchored to local blood vessels; disruption of this interaction decreases the number of interneurons produced ( Tan et al., 2016 46. Tan, X. ∙ Liu, W. ∙ Zhang, X.-J. ... Vascular influence on ventral telencephalic progenitors and neocortical interneuron production Dev. Cell. 2016; 36 :624-638 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (65) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the adult mouse brain, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals three distinct subtypes of endothelial cells, including venous, capillary, and arterial subtypes ( Vanlandewijck et al., 2018 47. Vanlandewijck, M. ∙ He, L. ∙ Mäe, M.A. ... A molecular atlas of cell types and zonation in the brain vasculature Nature. 2018; 554 :475-480 Crossref Scopus (1097) PubMed Google Scholar ). Compared to the adult mouse brain, the subtypes of endothelial cells in postnatal day 7 (P7) mouse brain expand to include mitotic and tip cells ( Sabbagh et al., 2018 41. Sabbagh, M.F. ∙ Heng, J.S. ∙ Luo, C. ... Transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of CNS and non-CNS vascular endothelial cells Elife. 2018; 7 :e36187 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Trajectory analysis of P7 mouse endothelial cells suggests the presence of a hierarchical structure in which progenitor-like venous and mitotic cells give rise to arterial and tip cell phenotypes ( Sabbagh et al., 2018 41. Sabbagh, M.F. ∙ Heng, J.S. ∙ Luo, C. ... Transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of CNS and non-CNS vascular endothelial cells Elife. 2018; 7 :e36187 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Similar to endothelial cells, scRNA-seq data identifies several mural cell subtypes in adult mouse brain, including smooth muscle cells, classic pericytes, and parenchymal fibroblasts ( Vanlandewijck et al., 2018 47. Vanlandewijck, M. ∙ He, L. ∙ Mäe, M.A. ... A molecular atlas of cell types and zonation in the brain vasculature Nature. 2018; 554 :475-480 Crossref Scopus (1097) PubMed Google Scholar ). Though these studies revealed brain vascular transcriptomics in mice, the developmental origins and progression of vascular cells in the prenatal human brain remain unknown.

Section: Results

To study angiogenesis in the prenatal human brain, we used a CD31 antibody to label endothelial cells, and NG2 and PDGFR-β antibodies to identify mural cells in the pallium, including the cerebral cortex, the ventricular zone/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) regions, and the subpallium, including the ganglionic eminences (GE) from 14–39 gestational weeks (GW) ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and S1 A). Given the presence of active neurogenesis in VZ/SVZ in the pallium and the GE in the subpallium, we divided these regions into three zones based on the distance to the ventricle. Zone 1, defined by the expression of Nestin and PDGFR-β, included the VZ and SVZ up to 100 μm and contained abundant radial glia. Zone 2 contained densely packed immature neurons between 100 μm and 1 mm from the VZ/SVZ. Finally, Zone 3 defined 500 μm regions distal to Zone 2 ( Figure 1 C, S1 A, and S1B). Quantification showed that CD31 + endothelial cell surface area was significantly higher in Zone 1 in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ at 14–17 and 21–25 GW ( Figures 1 C, 1D, S1 B, and S1C). At 39 GW, the CD31 + density in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ regions showed no difference compared to those in Zones 2 and 3 ( Figures 1 D; S1 A and S1C). Similarly, NG2 + mural cell density was significantly higher in Zone 1 of the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ at 14–17 GW, but not at 21–25 GW ( Figures 1 C, 1E, S1 B, and S1D). At 39 GW, NG2 and PDGFR-β antibodies detected non-vascular glial ribbons in VZ/SVZ and therefore were not quantified ( Figure S1 A). Unlike the results in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ, endothelial cell density in the cortex showed uniform density similar to Zone 3 at all ages ( Figures S1 E and S1F). 3D reconstructions showed that many CD31 + endothelial cells at 14–17 GW contained abundant filopodia interdigitated with NG2 + mural cells in Zone 1, which were significantly reduced in Zones 2 and 3 ( Figures 1 F, 1G, and Video S1 ). The density of filopodia in Zone 1 reduced drastically at 21–25 GW ( Figure 1 G). Because filopodia are associated with active angiogenesis, we also quantified vascular branch points. These results showed that Zone 1 indeed contained more branch points than Zones 2–3 at 14–17 GW ( Figure 1 H). In addition, at 14–17 GW, Zone 1 contained more Ki-67 + endothelial (Ki-67 + ;CD31 + ) and mural (Ki-67 + ;PDGFR-β + ) cells compared to Zone 3 ( Figures 1 I–1K, S1 G-S1I, and Video S2 ). These findings indicate that the neurogenic ventricular zone in the prenatal human brain is also highly angiogenic.

Next, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine blood vessels in VZ and SVZ in GE and cortex from 17–23 GW ( Figures 2 A, 2L, S2 A, and S2L, magenta-shaded areas). At least three distinct populations of endothelial cells can be discerned based on their ultrastructural features ( Figures 2 , S2 , and Table S1 ). The first endothelial cell subtype exhibited light translucent cytoplasm that contained few polyribosomes, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), small Golgi complexes, and few caveolae and clathrin-coated vesicles ( Figures 2 B–2J, 2M–2T, S2 B–S2E, and S2G–S2I, shaded in lavender). The second subtype contained dark, electron-dense cytoplasm and had abundant polyribosomes, RER, Golgi, and caveola-like vacuoles ( Figures 2 B–2J, 2M–2T, S2 B–S2E, and S2G–S2I, shaded in green). The third subtype contained intermediate electron lucent cytoplasm with filopodia ( Figures 2 B–2J, 2M–2T, and S2 B–S2E, and S2G–S2I, shaded in blue). Dark endothelial cells had more mitochondrial mass at 17 GW compared to light endothelial cells and, overall, endothelial cells at 17 GW compared to 21 GW contained less mitochondrial mass ( Figures 2 P–2U). In addition, all three endothelial cell subtypes displayed prominent RER, whose connection to mitochondria may contribute to angiogenesis ( Wang et al., 2021 49. Wang, C. ∙ Dai, X. ∙ Wu, S. ... FUNDC1-dependent mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes are involved in angiogenesis and neoangiogenesis Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :2616 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). Other features characteristic of endothelial cells included junctional complexes ( Figures 2 B–2G, S2 C and S2I, double arrows) and Weibel-Palade bodies ( Figures 2 H and 2I, arrows). The endothelial cells were covered by sparse and discontinuous basal lamina, indicative of immature BBB ( Figures 2 D, 2G, and S2 D). Some blood vessels in the VZ/SVZ at 17 GW contained no detectable lumen, suggesting that these were nascent sprouts that were not yet perfused ( Figures 2 N, S2 C, and S2D). By 23 GW, most vessels in these regions showed small lumens, some containing red blood cells ( Figure S2 A).
On TEM, mural cells were closely associated with the endothelial cells, but not covering them in their entirety. These mural cells were characterized by electron-dense cytoplasm and irregular nuclei with deep invaginations, large nucleoli, and lumpy chromatin associated with the nuclear membrane ( Figures 2 B, 2C, 2J, 2K, and S2 E, shaded in magenta). These mural cells contained abundant polyribosomes, RER, and mitochondria ( Figures 2 C and 2J), and contacted endothelial cells using junctional complexes ( Figure 2 C), immature basement membranes ( Figure 2 G), and interdigitating cytoplasmic processes ( Figures 2 K and S2 E). Unlike the endothelial cells, the mural cells did not contain ultrastructural features that defined subtype specification ( Table S1 ).
To investigate the stages of vascular development during the second trimester, we used a FACS-based strategy to purify endothelial and mural cells. Based on single-cell transcriptomics data from prenatal human brain ( Nowakowski et al., 2017 33. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ), we identified CD31 (PECAM1), ANPEP (CD13), and CD45 (PTPRC) as an effective combination to isolate endothelial and mural cells from micro-dissected cortex and GE and simultaneously exclude perivascular myeloid cells ( Figure 3 A)( Crouch and Doetsch, 2018 8. Crouch, E.E. ∙ Doetsch, F. FACS isolation of endothelial cells and pericytes from mouse brain microregions Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :738-751 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crouch et al., 2015 9. Crouch, E.E. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Silva-Vargas, V. ... Regional and stage-specific effects of prospectively purified vascular cells on the adult V-SVZ neural stem cell lineage J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :4528-4539 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Flow cytometry confirmed the validity of these markers to isolate distinct populations of endothelial cells (CD45 − ; CD31 + ; and ANPEP − ) and mural cells (CD45 − ; CD31 - ; and ANPEP + ) ( Figures 3 A and S3 A). All CD31 + cells were CD34 + , CD105 lo , CD146 + and negative for PDGFR-β and ANPEP, whereas mural cells were PDGFR-β + , ANPEP + , CD146 high , CD34 − , and CD105 lo ( Figures S3 B and S3C). To validate these results, we cultured endothelial and mural cells separately on collagen in endothelial growth media (EGM-2). In these conditions, endothelial cells displayed typical cobblestone morphology and expressed CD31 at cell-cell junctions, whereas mural cells had spindle-shape morphology and expressed PDGFR-β ( Figure 3 B). In 3D Matrigel cultures, both endothelial and mural cells formed tube-like structures as expected for vascular cells ( Figures 3 C and 3D). Next, we performed scRNA-seq using FACS-isolated endothelial cells and mural cells from the 15–23 GW human GE and cortex ( Figure 3 E). In total, we collected data from 147,228 cells from 7 samples (2 regions each), with an average of 96,778 reads per cell, 1,468 genes per cell in sequencing depth, and 122,798 unique molecules per cell ( Table S2 ). Visualization of scRNA-seq data from these samples with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) revealed distinct separation of endothelial and mural cells. Endothelial cells expressed PECAM1 , CD34 , and TIE1 and mural cells ANPEP , PDGFRB , and RGS5 as expected ( Figures 3 E and 3F). Contamination by other neural subtypes such as neuroblasts, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes was minimal ( Figure S3 D). Though endothelial and mural cells from the two brain regions showed significant overlap on the UMAP, minor differences by age were noted, suggesting age-dependent developmental trajectories ( Figure 3 E).
Unbiased clustering identified five subtypes of endothelial cells from 15–23 GW prenatal human brain, including mitotic, venous, capillary, tip cell, and arterial ( Figures 4 A, 4B, and Table S3 ) Genes enriched in the mitotic endothelial cell clusters included proliferative markers ( TOP2A , CENPF , and BIRC5 ) and generated the gene ontology (GO) terms kinetochore, mitotic G2/M, AuroraB pathway, DNA replication, regulation of cell cycle process, and cell cycle ( Figure S4 A). In contrast, the arterial, venous, capillary, and tip cell clusters contained genes that were either shared with the P7 mouse brain or specific for the prenatal human brain ( Figures 4 B, 4C, S4 B, and Table S3 ) ( Sabbagh et al., 2018 41. Sabbagh, M.F. ∙ Heng, J.S. ∙ Luo, C. ... Transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of CNS and non-CNS vascular endothelial cells Elife. 2018; 7 :e36187 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). These included ALPL , CXCL12 , ELN , GJA4 , HEY1 , SRGN , and UNC5B for the arterial endothelial cell cluster; ADM , ANGPT2 , APLN , CXCR4 , and PGF for the tip cell cluster; ADGRG6 , IFI27 , LY6E , PRCP , PMAIP1 , RPS2 , and RPS23 for the venous endothelial cell cluster; and CD27 , CSRP2 , HES1 , PON2 , SLCO1A2 , and SLC39A10 for the capillary endothelial cell cluster.
Next, we analyzed scRNA-seq data for endothelial cells using RNA velocity to decipher the relationships between different cell clusters and their developmental trajectories ( La Manno et al., 2018 29. La Manno, G. ∙ Soldatov, R. ∙ Zeisel, A. ... RNA velocity of single cells Nature. 2018; 560 :494-498 Crossref Scopus (1950) PubMed Google Scholar ). These results showed that at 15 GW, mitotic endothelial cells gave rise to venous endothelial cells, which then progressed through an intermediate stage consisting of capillary endothelial cells and tip cells before terminating as arterial endothelial cells ( Figures 4 D and S4 C). At 23 GW, both venous and mitotic endothelial cells showed partial overlaps and were positioned at the beginning of the trajectory, giving rise to capillary endothelial cells, tip cells, and arterial endothelial cells. The 23 GW samples showed more arterial and fewer capillary endothelial cells, supporting the maturation of vascular cells at this prenatal stage ( Figure 4 D).
Next, we performed RNAscope and immunostaining from the prenatal human brain at early (15–17 GW) and late (23–24 GW) second trimester sections. RNAscope showed that ADGRG6 , a marker for venous and capillary clusters, was detected in non-continuous segments of CD31 + vasculature in pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ at 15 and 23 GW ( Figures 4 E and 4F, left panel). In contrast, immunostaining showed diffuse presence of capillary/venous marker MFSD2A in endothelial cells ( Figure 4 G). Consistent with the results in Figures 1 F and 1G, tip cell markers ( ADM and ANGPT2 ) were focally enriched in endothelial cells in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ, but were sparsely present in endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex at 15 GW ( Figure 4 H). ADM and ANGPT2 expression persisted at 23 GW in endothelial cells in the VZ/SVZ but was not detected in the endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex ( Figure 4 I). Consistent with the RNAscope data, immunostains for ADM confirmed its presence in endothelial cells in the VZ/SVZ ( Figure 4 J). Similar to the non-continuous expression of capillary/venous and tip cell markers, the arterial markers GJA4 , FBLN5 , and ELN were detected in discrete segments of the endothelial cells in larger blood vessels in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ ( Figures 4 K–4M).
Differential gene expression analysis showed that younger endothelial cells were more enriched in genes related to ribosomal functions and ribosomal subunits, and mitochondrial genes in oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory chain complex, cytochrome complex assembly, and antioxidant pathways ( Figures 4 N, 4O, and Table S3 ). The over-representation of these metabolic pathways was consistent with the results from TEM, and supports that endothelial cells in 15–18 GW brain are metabolically different from adult endothelial cells, which use the glycolytic pathway as their primary energy source ( Li et al., 2019 31. Li, X. ∙ Sun, X. ∙ Carmeliet, P. Hallmarks of endothelial cell metabolism in health and disease Cell Metab. 2019; 30 :414-433 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (262) PubMed Google Scholar ). The metabolic pathways in the young endothelial cells resembled those in tumor endothelial cells ( Rohlenova et al., 2020 39. Rohlenova, K. ∙ Goveia, J. ∙ García-Caballero, M. ... Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Maps Endothelial Metabolic Plasticity in Pathological Angiogenesis Cell Metab. 2020; 31 :862-877.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ), suggesting that the younger endothelial cells might be exposed to a relatively hypoxic environment. In contrast, older endothelial cells showed enrichment of genes related to blood vessel development, chromatin-related genes, RNA processing, and structural genes, including cell junctions and supramolecular fiber organization ( Figure S4 C).
To characterize the mitochondrial contents and metabolism in the second trimester brain endothelial cells, we performed flow cytometry using Mitotracker Red and immunostains with Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane complex subunit 20 (TOMM20). These results showed that the endothelial cells from 15–18 GW had less mitochondrial mass than those from 20–23 GW ( Figures S4 D and E). Flow cytometry experiments with Mitotracker Red confirmed these results; endothelial cells from 15–18 GW had less abundant mitochondrial mass compared to adult endothelial cells, and trend toward less than those from 20–23 GW ( Figures 4 P and 4Q). In addition, Seahorse assays showed that, despite having lower basal levels of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), the endothelial cells from 15–18 GW exhibited more reserve capacity for respiration and less reserve capacity for glycolysis compared to those from 20–23 GW ( Figures 4 R–4T). These results provide an important link between the morphology, transcriptomics, and functions of endothelial cells.
Unbiased clustering of our scRNA-seq dataset identified four subtypes of mural cells, including smooth muscle cells, classic pericytes, fibroblasts, and mitotic mural cells ( Figures 5 A, 5B, and Table S3 ). All four subtypes were detected in GE and cortex from 15 to 23 GW ( Figure 5 A). The mitotic mural cells expressed cell cycle-related genes, including AURKB , NUF2 , BIRC5 , KIF20B , UBE2C , and HHMR , which defined GO terms such as cell cycle, regulation of cell cycle process, and AuroraB pathway ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S5 A). Smooth muscle cells expressed genes such as ACTA2 , TAGLN , MYL9 , TPM1 and TPM2 ( Figures 5 B and 5C), with GO terms related to actin filament-based process, muscle structure development, smooth muscle contraction, and signaling by RhoGTPases ( Figure S5 A). In addition, our scRNA-seq data identified a subpopulation of mural cells that expressed marker genes for fibroblasts in adult mouse brain, such as COL1A1 , COL3A1 , LUM , and SERPING1 , as well as human-specific fibroblast marker genes like CLU , VCAN , and PTGDS ( Figure S5 B). The GO terms defined by these genes included fibroblast functions, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, blood vessel development, and response to wounding ( Figures 5 B, 5C, and S5 A). Finally, our scRNA-seq data identified classic pericytes, which expressed well-known pericyte genes KCNJ8 , ATP1A2 , and CD248 ( Figures 5 B and 5C). The GO terms for this classic pericyte subtype included ECM proteoglycans, basement membranes, and transport across the BBB, consistent with the known roles of these cells ( Figure S5 A) ( Armulik et al., 2010 2.

Differential gene expression analysis showed that mural cells from 20–23 GW preferentially expressed genes associated with blood vessel development, cell adhesion, and ECM ( Figures S5 C, S5D, and Table S4 ), consistent with their role as vascular support cells ( Armulik et al., 2011 3.

Blood Flow Metab. 2016; 36 :451-455 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, mural cells from 15–18 GW upregulated genes related to ribosomes, oxidative phosphorylation, smooth muscle cell differentiation, and immune-related groups such as host interactions of HIV factors ( Figures S5 C and S5D). The upregulation of ribosomal genes in mural cells at 15–18 GW supported the more immature, progenitor state of mural cells at this age, whereas the presence of immune-related genes may relate to the emerging role of mural cells in the BBB ( Daneman et al., 2010 10.

Next, we analyzed the trajectory of mural cells using RNA Velocity, which showed three distinct states of cellular maturation in mural cells at 15 GW, beginning with mitotic mural cells (brown, UBE2C + and BIRC5 + ), which progressed toward non-proliferative smooth muscle cells (red, MYL9 + and TAGLN + ), and finally to classic pericytes (blue, ATP1A2 + and KCNJ8 + ) ( Figures 5 D and S5 E). In addition, 15 GW mural cells also contained a large group of fibroblasts that expressed LUM (yellow) and SERPING1 ( Figures 5 D and S5 E). Although a subset of fibroblasts seemed to arise from mitotic mural cells, the majority of fibroblasts at this age appeared to derive from cells of unknown origin. Consistent with the progressive reduction in Ki-67 + mural cells from 14–17 GW to 21–25 GW ( Figure 1 K), RNA velocity analysis in the 23 GW mural cells showed a marked reduction of the mitotic mural cell cluster, a distinct population of smooth muscle cells that gave rise to fibroblasts, and expansion of classic pericytes ( Figure 5 D, right panel).
Finally, RNAscope detected the expression of classic pericyte markers KCNJ8 and ATP1A2 in many mural cells in smaller blood vessels in the VZ/SVZ of pallium and subpallium at 15 and 23 GW ( Figures 5 E, 5F, and Video S3 ). Although KCNJ8 expression was restricted to mural cells, ATP1A2 transcripts were detected in neural progenitors in the ventricular zone ( Figure 5 E) ( Fu et al., 2021 17.

Immunostains for another classic pericyte marker, CD248, showed CD248 + cells encasing endothelial cells in the subpallial VZ/SVZ at 17 GW ( Figure 5 G). These results were consistent with those from NG2 ( Figure 1 E), another classic pericyte marker, and suggested a gradient of classic pericytes developing from the ventricular wall. Unlike pericytes, RNAscope for fibroblast markers LUM and SERPING1 showed that these fibroblasts were more readily detected around the blood vessels of the cerebral cortex in 15 and 23 GW, and sparsely present in the vasculature in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ ( Figures 5 H and 5I). As previously noted ( Eze et al., 2021 14. Eze, U.C. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Haeussler, M. ... Single-cell atlas of early human brain development highlights heterogeneity of human neuroepithelial cells and early radial glia Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :584-594 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ), abundant LUM transcripts were found in neural progenitors in the VZ/SVZ at 15 GW. Immunostains also showed that LUM proteins were broadly present in the ventricular zone and on rare perivascular cells ( Figure 5 J). Finally, RNAscope for smooth muscle cell markers, MYL9 and TAGLN , showed an infrequent presence of these cells at 15 and 23 GW. At 15 GW, MYL9 + and TAGLN + cells were most commonly found in larger vessels of the cortex ( Figures 5 K and 5L, panel 1). Immunostains detected few MYL9 + smooth muscle cells around the vasculature in the pallial and subpallial VZ/SVZ ( Figure 5 M).

Next, we used CellChat to query the signaling pathways for cell-cell communication between endothelial and mural cells ( Jin et al., 2021 24. Jin, S. ∙ Guerrero-Juarez, C.F. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Inference and analysis of cell-cell communication using CellChat Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :1088 Crossref Scopus (2221) PubMed Google Scholar ). The most over-represented pathways were ECM protein families, such as collagen, laminin, and fibronectin (FN) ( Figures 6 A, S6 A, and S6B). Chord plots and violin plots showed extensive expression of collagen type IV α1 (COL4A1) chain and integrin α1 (ITGA1) in most vascular subtypes at 15 and 23 GW ( Figure 6 B). In agreement, immunostains revealed high levels of COL4A1 and ITGA1 throughout the brain vasculature at 23 GW ( Figure 6 C). Unlike COL4A1, COL1A1 was only expressed by fibroblasts at 15 and 23 GW, whereas COL9A3 showed expression in tip cells only ( Figure S6 A). Other adhesion or tight junction proteins included junction adhesion molecules (JAM), cadherins (CDH), PECAM1, occludin (OCLN), and claudin (CLDN), though their contribution was small ( Figures 6 A and S6 C). In addition, CellChat identified ligand-receptor pairs, such as Notch, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), PDGF, ephrins, and insulin-like growth factor, known to promote vascular expansion and remodeling ( Figures 6 A and S6 D–S6F). However, the most abundant growth factor-related pathway was midkine (MDK), which promotes angiogenesis and is structurally and functionally similar to pleiotrophin ( Ross-Munro et al., 2020 40. Ross-Munro, E. ∙ Kwa, F. ∙ Kreiner, J. ... Midkine: the who, what, where, and when of a promising neurotrophic therapy for perinatal brain injury Front. Neurol. 2020; 11 , 568814 Crossref Scopus (13) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weckbach et al., 2012 50. Weckbach, L.T. ∙ Groesser, L. ∙ Borgolte, J. ... Midkine acts as proangiogenic cytokine in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2012; 303 :H429-H438 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure 6 D). To investigate its expression in the developing human brain, we performed immunostains for MDK and two of its receptors, Syndecan 2 (SDC2) and Integrin β1 (ITGB1). Consistent with the scRNA-seq data, ITGB1 showed extensive expression in all types of endothelial and mural cells ( Figures 6 E and S6 E). In contrast, SDC2 expression showed progressive increase in smooth muscle cells from 15 to 23 GW and in mitotic mural cells and fibroblasts at 23 GW ( Figures 6 D, 6F, and S6 E). Finally, 3D Matrigel tube assays showed that MDK (20 ng/mL) increased, whereas MDK inhibitor iMDK (100 nM) reduced, branching in both endothelial and mural cells ( Figures 6 G–6I).
To examine the roles of vascular cells in neural progenitors, we transplanted FACS-purified endothelial and mural cells into 7 to 9-week-old human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical organoids, which mimic cortical development during the second trimester ( Bhaduri et al., 2020 5. Bhaduri, A. ∙ Andrews, M.G. ∙ Mancia Leon, W. ... Cell stress in cortical organoids impairs molecular subtype specification Nature. 2020; 578 :142-148 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to transplantation, endothelial and mural cells were labeled by AAV-CMV-GFP to track their presence in the organoids ( Figures 7 A and 7B). Two weeks after transplantation, immunostains showed that 27% of the transplanted endothelial cells and 22% of mural cells were Ki-67 + ( Figures 7 C and 7D), and RNAscope identified different mural and endothelial cell subtypes, including smooth muscle cells ( MYL9 and TAGLN ), classic pericytes ( ATP1A2 and KCNJ8 ), fibroblasts ( SERPING1 and LUM ), tip cells ( ANGPT2 and ADM ), arterial ( GJA4 and FBLN5 ), and capillary/veinous ( ADGRG6 and PRDX3 ). These results showed that the majority of the mural cells in the cerebral organoids displayed smooth muscle cell subtype markers with smaller percentages of classic pericytes and fibroblasts ( Figures 7 E and 7F). In contrast, most transplanted endothelial cells expressed tip cell markers, ANGPT2 and ADM ( Figures 7 G and 7H).
To determine how transplanted vascular cells affect neuronal development, we quantified the number of neurons expressing BCL11B (CTIP2) (which labels excitatory neurons in layers 5–6 of the cortex), CUX1/2 (excitatory neurons in layers 2–4 of the cortex), SATB2 (callosal projection neurons), RBFOX3 (NeuN), and PAX6 (progenitors) within 350 μm of GFP + endothelial cells or mural cells ( Figures 7 I–7K and S7 A-S7E). As controls, we quantified areas without transplanted cells. In addition, we transplanted NIH3T3 cells into the organoids as cell-type-specific controls. These results showed that transplanted mural and endothelial cells increased the number of RBFOX3 + cells and BCL11B + cells in the organoids ( Figures 7 I–7K). Compared to endothelial cells and NIH3T3cells, the transplanted mural cells modestly promoted the development of SATB2+ neurons, whereas neither endothelial cells, mural cells, or NIH3T3 cells affected the development of CUX1/2 + or PAX6 + cells ( Figures S7 A-S7E).
Our previous work shows that newly born neurons in cerebral organoids exhibit cellular stress and upregulate genes in the ER stress pathway, including PGK1 , ARCN1, and GORASP2 . Immunostains for PGK1 showed that both endothelial and mural cells decreased the number of PGK1 + cells in regions adjacent to the vascular cells ( Figures 7 L and 7M). In addition, immunostains for glycolytic enzymes enolase and GORASP1, which are readouts for caspase-mediated Golgi fragmentation ( Gee et al., 2011 19. Gee, H. ∙ Noh, S. ∙ Tang, B. ... Rescue of ΔF508-CFTR trafficking via a GRASP-dependent unconventional secretion pathway Cell. 2011; 146 :746-760 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (247) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kim et al., 2016 26.

Monomerization and ER relocalization of GRASP is a requisite for unconventional secretion of CFTR Traffic. 2016; 17 :733-753 Crossref Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ), showed that transplanted endothelial and mural cells can reduce the number of enolase + and GORASP1 + cells in the organoids ( Figure S7 F-S7I).

Section: Discussion

One remarkable discovery of our study is the mosaic development of vascular cells in the prenatal human brain ( Figure S7 J). Specifically, our results support a model wherein the developing vasculature in the second trimester is tiled by an ensemble of diverse endothelial and mural cell subtypes, including those previously reported in postnatal mouse brain ( Sabbagh et al., 2018 41. Sabbagh, M.F. ∙ Heng, J.S. ∙ Luo, C. ... Transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of CNS and non-CNS vascular endothelial cells Elife. 2018; 7 :e36187 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018 47. Vanlandewijck, M. ∙ He, L. ∙ Mäe, M.A. ... A molecular atlas of cell types and zonation in the brain vasculature Nature. 2018; 554 :475-480 Crossref Scopus (1097) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with this model, RNA velocity of endothelial cell transcriptomes shows a directional flow from immature venous and mitotic endothelial cells, through capillary and tip cells, ending with arterial endothelial cells ( Figure 4 ). In agreement with this trajectory, endothelial cells expressing arterial markers GJA4 and FBLN5 were present in low abundance in the prenatal human brain at 15 GW and became more prominent at 23 GW. Conversely, both tip cells and capillary endothelial cells show progressive reductions in their relative abundance from 15 to 23 GW. In addition to these temporal changes, endothelial cell development may also be influenced by environmental cues. For example, the ventricular zone is largely occupied by tip cells, mitotic endothelial cells, and mitotic mural cells. In this region, endothelial tip cells have previously been shown to promote neurogenesis using a VEGF-mediated mechanism ( Di Marco et al., 2020 12. Di Marco, B. ∙ Crouch, E.E. ∙ Shah, B. ... Reciprocal Interaction between Vascular Filopodia and Neural Stem Cells Shapes Neurogenesis in the Ventral Telencephalon Cell Rep. 2020; 33 , 108256 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (25) PubMed Google Scholar ). Transplanted FACS-isolated endothelial cells also preferentially displayed a tip cell phenotype under the neurogenic environment of cerebral organoids. Together, these results support the idea that the developmental trajectories of endothelial cells are guided by an intrinsic program and can be influenced by environmental signals that encourage a specific subtype.
Another intriguing result revealed by our scRNA-seq datasets is that the endothelial cells from early second trimester exhibit more abundant transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation. Using TEM, confocal microscopy, and FACS, we show that the endothelial cells from 17 GW have less mitochondrial mass compared to those from 21–22 GW and adult brains ( Figures 2 P–2U, 4 P–4Q, S4 D, and S4E). In addition, endothelial cells from 15–18 GW exhibit more reserve capacity for respiration and less reserve capacity for glycolysis compared to those from 20–23 GW ( Figures 4 R–4T). These results support the idea that the endothelial cells from early second trimester may upregulate the expression of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation to compensate for smaller mitochondrial masses. Future studies using subtype-specific markers will shed light on how these ultrastructural and bioenergetic properties of endothelial cells correlate with specific transcriptomic subpopulation(s).
Three distinct subtypes of mural cells, including classic pericytes, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells, have been identified in the adult mouse brain. Our approach identifies these three mural cell subtypes and an additional subpopulation of mitotic mural cells in the prenatal human brain. To query the developmental trajectories of mural cells, RNA velocity at 15 GW shows the mitotic mural cells can give rise to fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. At this age, classic pericytes represent a very small population that are derived from smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, this analysis suggests that a subpopulation of fibroblasts may also function as progenitors. By 23 GW, the relative abundance of mitotic mural cells reduces significantly. Instead, the smooth muscle cells are projected to give rise to classic pericytes and fibroblasts, both representing the more abundant cell types at this age.
Contrary to the lack of smooth muscle cells in embryonic mouse brain ( Jung et al., 2018 25. Jung, B. ∙ Arnold, T.D. ∙ Raschperger, E. ... Visualization of vascular mural cells in developing brain using genetically labeled transgenic reporter mice J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2018; 38 :456-468 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ), our results reveal cells expressing smooth muscle cell markers in the second trimester human brain vasculature. These results highlight species-specific differences in the timing of smooth muscle cell development in prenatal human vasculature. Notably, our mural cell lineage trajectory differs from recent reports in the developing mouse heart and postnatal mouse brain ( Ando et al., 2022 1. Ando, K. ∙ Tong, L. ∙ Peng, D. ... KCNJ8/ABCC9-containing K-ATP channel modulates brain vascular smooth muscle development and neurovascular coupling Dev. Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (20) PubMed Google Scholar ; Volz et al., 2015 48. Volz, K.S. ∙ Jacobs, A.H. ∙ Chen, H.I. ... Pericytes are progenitors for coronary artery smooth muscle Elife. 2015; 4 :e10036 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Future studies using lineage tracing and functional characterization will be critical to understand organ and species-specific differences in mural cell fate.
Our CellChat analysis provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which these endothelial and mural cells interact to promote prenatal human brain angiogenesis. Among the most prominent ligand-receptor pairs are collagen and laminin, which are related to ECM organization. These results are supported by immunostaining and TEM that confirm the presence of vascular basal laminae. Interestingly, the thin and discontinuous basement membrane in TEM suggests that the second trimester is an early and dynamic period of BBB formation. Another top ligand-receptor pair for endothelial-mural cell interactions is MDK and its receptors, integrins and syndecan. MDK has also been investigated as a key mechanism that promotes angiogenesis induced by hypoxia and in tumorigenesis ( Filippou et al., 2020 16. Filippou, P.S. ∙ Karagiannis, G.S. ∙ Constantinidou, A. Midkine (MDK) growth factor: a key player in cancer progression and a promising therapeutic target Oncogene. 2020; 39 :2040-2054 Crossref Scopus (138) PubMed Google Scholar ; Weckbach et al., 2012 50. Weckbach, L.T. ∙ Groesser, L. ∙ Borgolte, J. ... Midkine acts as proangiogenic cytokine in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2012; 303 :H429-H438 Crossref Scopus (72) PubMed Google Scholar ). In support of these findings, our results comparing the transcriptomes of endothelial cells at 15–18 GW and 20–23 GW show that the metabolic pathways employed by these young endothelial cells resemble those in tumor endothelial cells ( Rohlenova et al., 2020 39. Rohlenova, K. ∙ Goveia, J. ∙ García-Caballero, M. ... Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Maps Endothelial Metabolic Plasticity in Pathological Angiogenesis Cell Metab. 2020; 31 :862-877.e14 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (175) PubMed Google Scholar ). Together, these findings capture an important metabolic mechanism employed by endothelial cells in response to the relatively hypoxic environment in the prenatal human brain.
Our results in Figure 1 show that angiogenesis is actively occurring in the VZ and SVZ, where robust neurogenesis exists. We previously showed that organoids capture many aspects of neurogenesis in the ventricular zone of the prenatal human cerebral cortex from 6–22 GW ( Bhaduri et al., 2020 5. Bhaduri, A. ∙ Andrews, M.G. ∙ Mancia Leon, W. ... Cell stress in cortical organoids impairs molecular subtype specification Nature. 2020; 578 :142-148 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ). Consistent with these findings, these organoids promote the differentiation of transplanted endothelial and mural cells toward tip cells and smooth muscle cells, respectively. Though unexpected, these results reveal how a highly neurogenic environment, such as the cortical organoids, can impact the differentiation of vascular cells. Although the exact mechanism(s) remain unclear, our results suggest that the VEGF-VEGFR signaling pathway and actin filament-based processes may promote the development of tip cells and smooth muscle cells, respectively. Another important finding of our study is that the transplanted vascular cells can improve neurogenesis and reduce cellular stress in the cortical organoids ( Figures 7 and S7 ). One potential mechanism for the transplanted vascular cells to reduce cellular stress is endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which has been shown to protect against brain injury after ischemia or TNFα-induced cytotoxicity ( De Palma et al., 2008 11. De Palma, C. ∙ Falcone, S. ∙ Panzeri, C. ... Endothelial nitric oxide synthase overexpression by neuronal cells in neurodegeneration: a link between inflammation and neuroprotection J. Neurochem. 2008; 106 :193-204 Crossref Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Faraci, 2006 15. Faraci, F.M. Protecting the Brain With eNOS Circ. Res. 2006; 99 :1029-1030 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because vascularization of brain organoids is an increasingly popular area of research, our findings will open new directions to improve the environmental milieu for cortical organoids and to reveal pathways that govern angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the prenatal human brain.
Finally, congenital vascular diseases have profound impacts on neurodevelopment. For example, mutations in COL4A1 are associated with significant neonatal hemorrhages and subsequent leukoencephalopathy ( Gould et al., 2005 20. Gould, D.B. ∙ Phalan, F.C. ∙ Breedveld, G.J. ... Mutations in Col4a1 cause perinatal cerebral hemorrhage and porencephaly Science. 2005; 308 :1167-1171 Crossref Scopus (447) PubMed Google Scholar ). Indeed, collagen and laminin are the two most dominant signaling pathways in second trimester human brain vascular cells, and COL4A1 specifically is expressed in all of our vascular subtypes. These results provide important insights as to why vascular defects caused by mutations in COL4A1 arise as early as the second trimester. In contrast, genes involved in the formation of adherens and tight junctions only show limited expression at this age. Our data, available at https://vascular-dev.cells.ucsc.edu , will be a resource for future studies of vascular cell subtypes and therapeutic strategies.
Our results provide an important blueprint for additional studies that focus on vascular development in the third trimester, perinatal, and early postnatal stages. These results will progress to a more complete model of vascular cell changes and environmental influences in other critical periods. However, there are several limitations to our study. First, despite the differences in the vascular density between the VZ and SVZ in the pallium and subpallium during the second trimester, our single-cell transcriptomic data did not show any definitive differences in endothelial or mural cells from these regions in morphology, transcriptomes, or subtype classifications. It is possible that region-specific factors from non-vascular cells may dictate the timing and the extent of angiogenesis in different parts of the developing brain. Another limitation of our study is that organoids appear to restrict subtype development of the transplanted vascular cells. Future organoid experiments could benefit from including additional cellular repertoires to more faithfully model prenatal human brain development. Finally, recent studies show that the BBB can be targeted by neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative conditions, but how the BBB is established in normal human brain remains unclear. Future studies on BBB development in the third trimester and postnatal stages will provide important connections with our findings in the prenatal human brain.

De-identified tissue samples were collected with previous patient consent in strict observance of the legal and institutional ethical regulations. Autopsy consent and all protocols were approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo, and Stem Cell Research Committee (institutional review board) at the University of California, San Francisco. All cases were determined by chromosomal analysis, physical examination, and/or pathological analysis to be control tissues, which indicates that they were absent of neurological disease. Cases with any abnormalities in these parameters were not used for this manuscript. The same cases were able to be used for immunohistochemistry and RNAscope. For TEM, scRNA-seq, Matrigel tube assays, and organoid transplants, none of the same cases were used for two types of experiments because the tissue or cells needed to be processed in a different way for each type of experiment.

Nests of dividing neuroblasts sustain interneuron production for the developing human brain Science. 2022; 375 , eabk2346 Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar ), human specimens with postmortem interval of less than 48 h were collected with previous patient consent in strict observance of the legal and institutional ethical regulations. Protocols were approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo, and Stem Cell Research (GESCR) Committee at the University of California, San Francisco. Tissue samples were dissected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1.25 mM NaH2PO4 under a stereotaxic dissection microscope (Leica).
Brains were cut into ∼1.5 cm coronal or sagittal blocks, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days, and then cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose solution. Blocks were cut into 30-micron sections on a cryostat, mounted on glass slides for immunohistochemistry, and stored at −80C. Frozen slides were gradually equilibrated to room temperature, moved from −80°C to 4°C the night prior to staining and then to the lab bench for 2 h before beginning the immunostaining protocol. Slides were washed once with 1X PBS for 5 min, then once with 1X TBS for 5 min before blocking with TBS++++ (goat serum, BSA, albumin, glycine and Triton X- in TBS) for 1 h. Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight at room temperature in TBS++++. The following day, three 1x TBS washes were performed before incubating with secondary antibodies in TBS++++ for 2 h. After three additional TBS washes, DAPI was added and the slides were mounted. Ki-67 staining required antigen retrieval and TSA amplification as previously described ( Paredes et al., 2016 34. Paredes, M.F. ∙ James, D. ∙ Gil-Perotin, S. ... Extensive migration of young neurons into the infant human frontal lobe Science. 2016; 354 :aaf7073 Crossref Scopus (242) PubMed Google Scholar ). The autofluorescence caused by red blood cells in postmortem brain tissues generated significant with the RNAscope workflow and were removed from the images with post-image processing in ImageJ. Raw images available upon request.
To quantify the surface area of vascular cells in the developing human brain, images were acquired using a Keyence VH-600 digital microscope with mouse anti-human CD31, goat anti-human PDGFR-β, and rabbit anti-human NG2. The entire ventricular area was captured. Zones were determined based on cellular features in the ganglionic eminences (GE). Zone 1 is the ventricular zone with dense radial glia fibers, and Zone 2 includes densely packed newly-born neurons, which are PDGFR-β negative. Areas lateral to Zone 2 are designated as Zone 3. For consistency, the same measurements were used for the GE and the cortex in each slide. To determine the surface area occupied by the vasculature, the particle analysis tool in ImageJ was used. Filopodia and number of branches in each zone were counted manually from 40X confocal images of each zone from the same slides. To determine mitochondrial surface area, sections were stained with CD34 and Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane complex subunit 20 (TOMM20). In ImageJ, the non-vascular areas were subtracted from the image and we measured the area of all mitochondria and divided by the surface area of the CD34 + staining in that section.
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), samples were sectioned with a vibratome (200 microns), postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide solution. Sections were dehydrated in crescent ethanol concentrations, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and finally embedded in araldite resin (Durcupan ACM Fluka, Sigma), and polymerized at 69°C for 72 h. Ultrathin sections were obtained (70 nm) and were contrasted with lead citrate solution on the grids. Postfixation was performed with 7% glucose-1% Osmium tetroxide and, afterward, followed a conventional embedding protocol. Vascular cells were identified based on their subcellular features and location. Similar to confocal microscopy, mitochondrial surface area was determined by measuring the area of each mitochondria and dividing by the surface area of the endothelial cell in that section. For quantification in Figure 2 U, 30 blood vessel segments were quantified per each subtype per case.
To isolate vascular cells from prenatal human brain tissues, we adapted a previously published protocol that was used for the adult mouse brain ( Crouch and Doetsch, 2018 8. Crouch, E.E. ∙ Doetsch, F. FACS isolation of endothelial cells and pericytes from mouse brain microregions Nat. Protoc. 2018; 13 :738-751 Crossref Scopus (88) PubMed Google Scholar ; Crouch et al., 2015 9. Crouch, E.E. ∙ Liu, C. ∙ Silva-Vargas, V. ... Regional and stage-specific effects of prospectively purified vascular cells on the adult V-SVZ neural stem cell lineage J. Neurosci. 2015; 35 :4528-4539 Crossref Scopus (0) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, brain tissue was minced with a scalpel and digested with collagenase/dispase (3 mg/mL) for 30 min at 37°C with rotation, triturated in 2% FBS in 1X PBS with DNase (0.25 mg/mL), and centrifuged through 22% Percoll to remove debris. The samples were incubated on ice for 15 min with Alexa 488-conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 to label endothelial cells (1:100), Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated mouse anti-ANPEP (1:100) to label mural cells, and PECy7-conjugated mouse anti-hCD45 (1:200) to exclude blood cells and microglia. After washing, samples were resuspended in HBSS buffer with DAPI (1:500) to exclude dead cells. Cells were sorted using a Becton Dickinson FACSAria using 13 psi pressure and 100 μm nozzle aperture. All FACS gates were set using unlabeled cells, single-color and isotype controls from human samples. For flow cytometry experiments to examine other vascular markers, the same procedure was used with the following antibody combinations: Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-hPDGFR-β (1:200), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-hCD146 (1:200), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-hCD34 (1:200), and Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-hCD105 (1:100). Mitotracker Red was added at 50 nM.
Endothelial or mural cells from cortex were pooled from 4–6 FACS experiments and cultured in EGM-2 media (Lonza) on collagen type 1-coated wells in 24 well dishes for 2D experiments. 3D experiments were performed in Ibidi μ-Slide Angiogenesis with 20,000 cells per well in undiluted Growth-Factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) with EGM-2 media for 7 days. Media was changed every other day in both assays. The same antibodies at the same concentrations were used as described in the tissue sections above, and Images were acquired on an Echo Revolve microscope. For Midkine experiments, passaged primary endothelial and mural cells at passage 3–7 were added at 20,000 cells per well and incubuated with recombinant Midkine (20 ng/mL) or Midkine inhibitor iMDK (100 nM). Images were acquired at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h on an ECHO REVOLVE microscope and branch points manually quantified in ImageJ.
Endothelial and mural cells from 7 cases, GW 15–23, were utilized in these experiments (see table under human tissue samples). Following a similar protocol to our previous work ( Bhaduri et al., 2020 5. Bhaduri, A. ∙ Andrews, M.G. ∙ Mancia Leon, W. ... Cell stress in cortical organoids impairs molecular subtype specification Nature. 2020; 578 :142-148 Crossref Scopus (318) PubMed Google Scholar ), single-cell capture from live cells was performed following the 10x v2 and v3 Chromium manufacturer’s instructions. In each sample, 10,000 cells were targeted for capture and 12 cycles of amplification for each of the cDNA amplification and library amplification were performed. Libraries were sequenced as per manufacturer recommendation on a NovaSeq S2 flow cell.
We first explored the cell-type identities of endothelial and mural cells using Louvain-Jaccard clustering ( Nowakowski et al., 2017 33. Nowakowski, T.J. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Pollen, A.A. ... Spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories reveal developmental hierarchies of the human cortex Science. 2017; 358 :1318-1323 Crossref Scopus (563) PubMed Google Scholar ). Prior to clustering, batch correction was performed in a similar way to previous approaches ( Peng et al., 2019 37. Peng, Y.-R. ∙ Shekhar, K. ∙ Yan, W. ... Molecular classification and comparative taxonomics of foveal and peripheral cells in primate retina Cell. 2019; 176 :1222-1237.e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (275) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each set of cells within a batch was normalized to the highest expressing gene, making the range of expression from 0 to 1. These values were multiplied by the average number of counts within the batch. These normalized datasets were piped into Seurat v.2 ( Butler et al., 2018 6. Butler, A. ∙ Hoffman, P. ∙ Smibert, P. ... Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data across different conditions, technologies, and species Nat. Biotechnol. 2018; 36 :411-420 Crossref Scopus (6218) PubMed Google Scholar ), and in the case of individual sample analysis (such as GW23 mural and/or endothelial cells) log-normalized counts were used. After transfer to Seurat, cells with fewer than 200 genes per cell or more than 10% of reads aligning to mitochondrial genes were discarded. Normalized counts matrices were log2-transformed, and variable genes were calculated using default Seurat parameters. Data were scaled in the space of these variables, and the batch was regressed out. Principal component analysis was performed using FastPCA, and significant principal components were identified using a published formula ( Shekhar et al., 2016 43. Shekhar, K. ∙ Lapan, S.W. ∙ Whitney, I.E. ... Comprehensive Classification of Retinal Bipolar Neurons by Single-Cell Transcriptomics Cell. 2016; 166 :1308-1323.e30 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (726) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the space of these significant principal components, the k = 10 nearest neighbors were identified as per the RANN R package. The distances between these neighbors were weighted by their Jaccard distance, and Louvain clustering was performed using the igraph R package. If any clusters contained only one cell, the process was repeated with k = 11 and upwards until no clusters contained only one cell. Cluster markers were set to have a minimum percentage of 25% in either population in addition to Seurat package default parameters. UMAPs were generated with Seurat default parameters.
Velocity estimates were calculated using the veloctyo.py and scvelo algorithms, as previously described ( Eze et al., 2021 14. Eze, U.C. ∙ Bhaduri, A. ∙ Haeussler, M. ... Single-cell atlas of early human brain development highlights heterogeneity of human neuroepithelial cells and early radial glia Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24 :584-594 Crossref Scopus (195) PubMed Google Scholar ). Reads that passed quality control after clustering were used as input for the velocyto command line implementation. The human expressed repeat annotation file was retrieved from the UCSC Genome Browser. The genome annotation file used was provided via CellRanger. The output loom file was used as input to estimate velocity through scvelo. For each individual analysis, cells were filtered based on the following parameters: minimum total counts ≥200, minimum spliced counts ≥20 and minimum unspliced counts ≥10. For the combined cortical analysis, the processed loom files for each individual analysis were combined to generate a new UMI count matrix of 15,473 genes across 53,096 cells, for which the velocity embedding was estimated using the stochastic model. For the combined progenitor analysis, cells that were identified as progenitors were used to create the loom file. The loom files for each of the individuals were combined for a total count matrix of 14,207 genes across 30,562 embedding using the same criteria. Each embedding was visualized using UMAP.
RNAscope experiments were performed according to their protocol for integrated Co-detection for fixed frozen tissue and the Multiplex fluorescent v2 Assay. In brief, slides were first baked at 60°C for 30 min, followed by a 15 min fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. We then performed target retrieval for 5 min using the RNAscope solution in an Oster steamer as recommended by ACD. After target retrieval, we dipped the slides in water, then 100% ethanol, and finally clipped the slides to the rack and drew a hydrophobic barrier. Once the barrier was dry, we added the protease plus solution for 30 min in the RNAscope Hybridization oven at 40°C for 30 min. During this incubation, we warmed the probes for 10 min in a 40°C water bath and then allowed them to cool for 10 min. Following the protease plus incubation, we washed the slides in distilled water twice, and then added the probes for 2 h in the RNAscope Hybridization oven at 40°C. After the probe hybridization, we added the Amp 1 and 2 solutions successively for 30 min in the RNAscope Hybridization oven at 40°C and then Amp 3 solution for 15 min. All of these steps were interspersed with 2 washes for 2 min in the ACD wash buffer solution. We then added the HRP-C1 signal for 15 min in the RNAscope Hybridization oven at 40°C, followed by the diluted Opal Dye for signal development for 30 min in the RNAscope Hybridization oven at 40°C, and finally a 15 min incubation in the RNAscope Hybridization oven at 40°C with the HRP blocker. In between all of these steps, we again performed 2 washes for 2 min with the ACD wash buffer solution. We then repeated the HRP signal, the Opal Dye, and the HRP blocker for the C2 probes. We then transitioned into our immunohistochemistry protocol listed earlier in this section and blocked for 1 h with TBS++++. We then added the primary antibody overnight in TBS++++ and performed secondary staining the following day. Of note, the target retrieval step for RNAscope significantly decreased the sensitivity of antibody staining and we added antibodies 10x more concentrated than for immunohistochemistry alone per ACD guidelines. Due to the postmortem collection of our samples, they are not perfused and have red blood cells in the vasculature. These red blood cells generate significant autofluorescence with the RNAscope workflow and were removed from the images with post-image processing in ImageJ. Raw images available upon request.
Cellchat analysis was done as described in ( Jin et al., 2021 24. Jin, S. ∙ Guerrero-Juarez, C.F. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Inference and analysis of cell-cell communication using CellChat Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :1088 Crossref Scopus (2221) PubMed Google Scholar ). Default 'trimean' threshold was used for more stringent identification of interactions. Minimum cell number per group was set to 10. Plots were generated as described in Jin et al., (2021) 24. Jin, S. ∙ Guerrero-Juarez, C.F. ∙ Zhang, L. ... Inference and analysis of cell-cell communication using CellChat Nat. Commun. 2021; 12 :1088 Crossref Scopus (2221) PubMed Google Scholar with modifications as noted in our code which is provided on SRA.
Respiration and glycolytic rates were measured in endothelial cells using a 96-well Seahorse XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Endothelial cells were plated in XF96 microplates (20,000 cells per well) and incubated overnight. A Seahorse 96-well assay cartridge was placed in a CO2-free incubator with calibration medium overnight. On the day of the assay, cells were incubated with Seahorse XF DMEM Medium, supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, and 2 mM glutamine, pH = 7.4, and incubated in a CO2-free incubator for 1 h. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured at baseline and after the addition of respiratory inhibitor FCCP (4μM carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone, which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation from membrane potential), followed by rotenone (2μM a complex I inhibitor). Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was measured at baseline and after the addition of respiratory inhibitor oligomycin A (5μM an ATP synthase inhibitor), followed by rotenone. After each assay was completed, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the OCR and ECAR signals were normalized to the number of cells in each well, estimated using Hoescht 33,342 staining, as well as to the baseline reading at the initial timepoint.
Organoid cultures were grown as previously described ( 27 ). Endothelial and mural cells from 6 cases, GW 13–23, were utilized in these experiments (see table under human tissue samples). NIH3T3cells were cultured in DMEM/High glucose media (Cytiva) as recommended and transplanted at passage 2. Immediately following FACS experiments, endothelial and mural cells were infected with AAV-CMV-GFP (Vector Biolabs) at 1:2000 with an approximate infection ratio of 25% and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with 1X PBS and gently added on top of 8-10 week old organoids. Organoids were stabilized on Millicell hanging culture inserts (Sigma) and incubated at 37°C with the transplanted cells for 30 min before being immersed in media. Media was changed three times per week and transplanted cells were cultured for 2 weeks before being fixed with PFA. Fixed organoids were embedded in an equal parts mix of 30% Sucrose and OCT and sectioned for immunostaining. We performed immunohistochemistry as described above. GFP-positive organoid regions were defined as being within 350μm from multiple GFP(+) cells. GFP-negative organoid regions were defined as being greater than 350μm from any GFP(+) cells.
The interactive viewer at https://vascular-dev.cells.ucsc.edu was created with the tools from the UCSC Cell Browser package ( https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_maximilianh_cellBrowser&d=DwIFaQ&c=iORugZls2LlYyCAZRB3XLg&r=gDfG4LoneiL92oJnZQfO8eN8b_paD72mG14zH9dq9HA&m=4YISTHA_IFiTyFUpiw_spcf9rZQpCSYEJl8Q4Db72Uw&s=V6WLAOUJqEo1EORxKrIJFOQ15xjqqSzzCDZz13MXJ0w&e= ). Data was exported from the Seurat object with cbImportSeurat, marker genes were manually added and annotated with cbMarkerAnnotate, and configuration files adapted based on information in the manuscript.
GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.3) was used to generate all graphs. Throughout the paper, ∗ indicates p < 0.05, ∗∗ indicates p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ indicates p < 0.005, ∗∗∗∗ indicates p < 0.001. The details of what n represents are defined in each figure legend. Non-statistically significant comparisons are not shown. ANOVAs were used for comparisons with multiple groups with post-hoc t tests to assess differences within groups. Comparisons of two variables were determined with Student’s t tests. The assumptions of the ANOVA were checked using Q-Q plots to assess normality and a plot of residual vs. predicted was used to assess constant variance. Data are represented as mean ± SEM.
