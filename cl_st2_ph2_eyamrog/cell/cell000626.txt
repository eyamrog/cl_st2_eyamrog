Title: Antibody escape of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 from vaccine and BA.1 serum


Abstract: Summary

The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2, which was first described in November 2021, spread rapidly to become globally dominant and has split into a number of sublineages. BA.1 dominated the initial wave but has been replaced by BA.2 in many countries. Recent sequencing from South Africa’s Gauteng region uncovered two new sublineages, BA.4 and BA.5, which are taking over locally, driving a new wave. BA.4 and BA.5 contain identical spike sequences, and although closely related to BA.2, they contain further mutations in the receptor-binding domain of their spikes. Here, we study the neutralization of BA.4/5 using a range of vaccine and naturally immune serum and panels of monoclonal antibodies. BA.4/5 shows reduced neutralization by the serum from individuals vaccinated with triple doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine compared with BA.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, using the serum from BA.1 vaccine breakthrough infections, there are, likewise, significant reductions in the neutralization of BA.4/5, raising the possibility of repeat Omicron infections.

Section: Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan in late 2019 to rapidly cause a pandemic. It is now estimated to have infected over half a billion people and caused over 6 million deaths ( https://covid19.who.int/ ). Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase possesses some proofreading ability, there has been a rapid evolution of the viral sequence. Because of the scale of the pandemic, it is estimated that all single-point mutations in the large SARS-CoV-2 genome will be generated every day ( Sender et al., 2021 35. Sender, R. ∙ Bar-On, Y.M. ∙ Gleizer, S. ... The total number and mass of SARS-CoV-2 virions Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2021; 118 e2024815118 Crossref Scopus (147) PubMed Google Scholar ). Most mutations will be silent, deleterious, or of little consequence; however, a few may give the virus an advantage leading to rapid natural selection ( Domingo, 2010 12. Domingo, E. Mechanisms of viral emergence Vet. Res. 2010; 41 :38 Crossref Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Many thousands of individual mutations have been described, and about a year after the outbreak started, strains began to emerge containing multiple mutations, particularly in the spike (S) gene. Several of these have been designated variants of concern (VoCs) ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-classifications.html ) and have led to successive waves of infection: first, Alpha ( Supasa et al., 2021 39. Supasa, P. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant by convalescent and vaccine sera Cell. 2021; 184 :2201-2211 e7 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ), second, Delta ( Liu et al., 2021a 26.

Alongside these, Beta ( Zhou et al., 2021 49. Zhou, D. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Supasa, P. ...

Antibody evasion by the P.1 strain of SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2021; 184 :2939-2954 e9 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (404) PubMed Google Scholar ) caused large regional outbreaks in Southern Africa and South America, respectively, but did not dominate globally. As of April 29 th , over 2.5 million cases of Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) have been reported in the UK alone ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-variants-genomically-confirmed-case-numbers/variants-distribution-of-case-data-29-april-2022#omicron ), and although the disease is less severe, particularly in vaccinated individuals, the scale of the outbreak has still led to a large number of deaths ( Nealon and Cowling, 2022 30. Nealon, J. ∙ Cowling, B.J. Omicron severity: milder but not mild Lancet. 2022; 399 :412-413 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (104) PubMed Google Scholar ).
S is the major surface glycoprotein on SARS-CoV-2 and assembles into extended transmembrane anchored trimers ( Walls et al., 2020 40. Walls, A.C. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ...

Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation Science. 2020; 367 :1260-1263 Crossref Scopus (95) PubMed Google Scholar ), which give virions their characteristic spiky shape. S is divided into N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 regions. S1 contains the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). A small 25 amino acid (aa) patch at the tip of the RBD is responsible for interaction with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ( Lan et al., 2020 23. Lan, J. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Yu, J. ... Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor Nature. 2020; 581 :215-220 Crossref Scopus (4079) PubMed Google Scholar ). Following ACE2 binding, S1 is cleaved and detached, whereas S2 undergoes a major conformational change to expose the fusion loop, which mediates the fusion of viral and host membranes, allowing the viral RNA to enter the host cell cytoplasm and commence the replicative cycle ( Walls et al., 2017 41. Walls, A.C. ∙ Tortorici, M.A. ∙ Snijder, J. ... Tectonic conformational changes of a coronavirus spike glycoprotein promote membrane fusion Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114 :11157-11162 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ).
S is the major target for neutralizing antibodies, and studies by a number of groups have isolated panels of monoclonal antibodies from infected or vaccinated volunteers ( Barnes et al., 2020 2. Barnes, C.O. ∙ Jette, C.A. ∙ Abernathy, M.E. ...

Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Potently neutralizing antibodies are largely confined to three sets of sites on S1. The first is within the NTD ( Cerutti et al., 2021 5. Cerutti, G. ∙ Guo, Y. ∙ Zhou, T. ...

A neutralizing human antibody binds to the N-terminal domain of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :650-655 Crossref Scopus (950) PubMed Google Scholar ); these antibodies do not block ACE2 interaction, and their mechanism of action is still not well determined. The second region of binding is on or in close proximity to the ACE2 binding surface of the RBD; most potently neutralizing antibodies bind this region and prevent the interaction of S with ACE2 on the host cell, blocking infection ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 9.

Yuan, M. ∙ Liu, H. ∙ Wu, N.C. ... Structural basis of a shared antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 Science. 2020; 369 :1119-1123 Crossref Scopus (370) PubMed Google Scholar ). Finally, some potent antibodies bind the RBD but do not block ACE2 binding, exemplified by mAb S309, which binds in the region of the N-linked glycan at position 343 ( Pinto et al., 2020 34. Pinto, D. ∙ Park, Y.J. ∙ Beltramello, M. ... Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody Nature. 2020; 583 :290-295 Crossref Scopus (1209) PubMed Google Scholar ), these antibodies may function to destabilize the S-trimer ( Huo et al., 2020b 19.

Biol. 2020; 27 :950-958 Crossref Scopus (209) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Although mutations in the VoC are spread throughout S, there are particular hotspots in the NTD and RBD, exactly where potent neutralizing antibodies bind, and they are likely being driven by escape from the antibody response following natural infection or vaccination. Mutation of the ACE2 interacting surface may also give an advantage by increasing ACE2 affinity for S or by possibly altering receptor tropism ( Zahradník et al., 2021 48. Zahradník, J. ∙ Marciano, S. ∙ Shemesh, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 variant prediction and antiviral drug design are enabled by RBD in vitro evolution Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1188-1198 Crossref Scopus (240) PubMed Google Scholar ). Increased ACE2 affinity has been found in VoC compared with ancestral strains ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2021b 10.

Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 leads to widespread escape from neutralizing antibody responses Cell. 2022; 185 :467-484 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ) and only marginally in BA.2 ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ).
The initial Omicron wave was caused by the BA.1 strain, which, compared with ancestral strains, contains 30-aa substitutions, 6-aa deletions, and 3-aa insertions, which are largely clustered at the sites of interaction of potently neutralizing antibodies: the ACE2 interacting surface, around the N343 glycan, and in the NTD ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 8. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 leads to widespread escape from neutralizing antibody responses Cell. 2022; 185 :467-484 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ). These changes cause large reductions in the neutralization titers of vaccine or naturally immune serum, leading to high levels of vaccine breakthrough infections and contributing to the intensity of the Omicron wave of infection ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 8. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ...

Structural basis of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron immune evasion and receptor engagement Science. 2022; 375 :864-868 Crossref Scopus (259) PubMed Google Scholar ).
A number of Omicron sublineages have been described. BA.2 and BA.3 were reported at about the same time as BA.1 and are highly related but contain some unique changes in S ( Figure 1 A), while another sublineage BA.1.1, which contains an additional R346K mutation, also emerged ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ). The BA.2 strain, which possesses a small transmission advantage, has become globally dominant. BA.3, reported in relatively few sequences compared with BA.1 and BA.2, appears to be a mosaic of BA.1 and BA.2 changes (with 3 differences in the RBD compared with BA.1 and 3 differences compared with BA.2). Cases of BA.2 infection following BA.1 are not thought to be common due to good levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies following vaccination ( Nutalai et al, 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar , https://www.who.int/news/item/22-02-2022-statement-on-omicron-sublineage-ba.2 ).
In early April 2022, two new Omicron lineages were reported from Gauteng in South Africa and designated BA.4 and BA.5 ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1067672/Technical-Briefing-40-8April2022.pdf ). These have become dominant in Gauteng and look to be fueling a new wave of infection in South Africa, with some international spread. BA.4 and BA.5 (from here on referred to as BA.4/5) have identical S sequences and appear to have evolved from BA.2. They contain additional mutations in the RBD, in particular, the reversion mutation R493Q (Q493 is found in ancestral strains), together with mutations L452R and F486V ( Figure 1 A).
Here, we report the antigenic characterization of BA.4/5 compared with the other Omicron sublineages (for completeness, we also report data on BA.3, although this is of less concern). We find that the neutralization of BA.4/5 by triple-dosed vaccine serum is reduced compared with BA.1 and BA.2. We also see reductions in titers against BA.4/5 compared with BA.1 and BA.2 in the sera from individuals who had suffered vaccine breakthrough BA.1 infections. The neutralization of the Omicron lineage by a panel of recently derived potent Omicron-specific mAbs raised following vaccine breakthrough BA.1 infection ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ) is reduced: 10/28 are completely knocked out against BA.4/5, while several others suffer large reductions in activity compared with the other Omicron lineages. We corroborate the neutralization results with a biophysical analysis of binding and provide structure-function explanations for mAb failure against BA.4/5 with the changes at residues 452 and 486, both of which cause serious impact. Finally, we measure the affinity of the BA.4/5 RBD for ACE2 and find that it is higher than earlier Omicron strains BA.1 and BA.2.

Section: Results

BA.4 and BA.5 S sequences are identical and closely related to BA.2 (sequence diversity in Omicron S is shown in Figure 1 A). Compared with BA.2, BA.4/5 has residues 69 and 70 deleted and contains 2 additional substitutions in the RBD: L452R and F486V. Finally, BA.4/5 lacks the Q493R change seen in BA.1 and BA.2, reverting to Q493 as in the Victoria/Wuhan strain.
The 2 additional mutations in the RBD are of most concern in terms of antibody escape: L452R is a chemically radical change and is one of the pair of changes in Delta RBD (the other, T478K, is already found in the Omicron lineage), and L452R is also found in Epsilon and the recently reported Omicron BA.2.11 ( https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants ). Mutation F486L was found in the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Mink early in the pandemic. F486 is also a site of escape mutations to several mAbs ( Gobeil et al., 2021 17. Gobeil, S.M. ∙ Janowska, K. ∙ McDowell, S. ... Effect of natural mutations of SARS-CoV-2 on spike structure, conformation, and antigenicity Science. 2021; 373 :6555 Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar ), and F486I was noted during SARS-CoV-2 evolution in an immunocompromised individual ( Clark et al., 2021 7. Clark, S.A. ∙ Clark, L.E. ∙ Pan, J. ... SARS-CoV-2 evolution in an immunocompromised host reveals shared neutralization escape mechanisms Cell. 2021; 184 :2605-2617 e18 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (117) PubMed Google Scholar ). The change F486V in BA.4/5 also causes a reduction in the bulk of the hydrophobic side chain as in F486L but is more significant. Both residues 452 and 486 lie close to the edge of the ACE2 interaction surface ( Figure 1 B) and, together with the reversion to ancestral sequence Q493, which lies within the ACE2 footprint, have the potential to modulate ACE2 affinity and the neutralizing capacity of the vaccine or naturally acquired serum. The L452R and F486V mutations are likely to cause more antibody escape, whereas the reversion at 493 may reduce the escape from the responses to earlier viruses.
To verify structural inferences, the crystal structure of BA.4/5 RBD was determined at 1.9 Å as a ternary complex with a neutralizing Fab and nanobody ( Table S1 ; Figure S1 ). This confirmed that the structure of the BA.4/5 RBD is very similar to that of other variants, although the residue 371–375 region, which is a hotspot of Omicron-specific mutations, is unusually well ordered and the tip of the arginine side chain of L452R is found in two conformations ( Figure S1 ).
We constructed a panel of pseudotyped lentiviruses ( Di Genova et al., 2020 11. Di Genova, C. ∙ Sampson, A. ∙ Scott, S. ... Production, titration, neutralisation and storage of SARS-CoV-2 lentiviral pseudotypes Bio Protoc. 2020; 11 :e4236 Google Scholar ) expressing the S gene from the Omicron sublineages BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, and BA.4/5 together with the early pandemic Wuhan-related strain, Victoria, used as a control. Neutralization assays were performed using serum obtained 28 days following a third dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine AZD1222 (n = 41) ( Flaxman et al., 2021 15. Flaxman, A. ∙ Marchevsky, N.G. ∙ Jenkin, D. ... Reactogenicity and immunogenicity after a late second dose or a third dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in the UK: a substudy of two randomised controlled trials (COV001 and COV002) Lancet. 2021; 398 :981-990 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (170) PubMed Google Scholar ) or Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine BNT162b2 (n = 19) ( Cele et al., 2022a 3. Cele, S. ∙ Jackson, L. ∙ Khoury, D.S. ... Omicron extensively but incompletely escapes Pfizer BNT162b2 neutralization Nature. 2022; 602 :654-656 Crossref Scopus (731) PubMed Google Scholar ; Figures 2 A and 2B). For AZD1222, neutralization titers for BA.4/5 were reduced 2.1-fold compared with BA.1 (p < 0.0001) and 1.8-fold compared with BA.2 (p < 0.0001). For BNT162b2, neutralization titers were reduced 3.1-fold (p < 0.0001) and 3.1-fold (p < 0.0001) compared with BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. These reductions in titers may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines at preventing infection, particularly at longer time points, as antibody titers naturally wane, although it would be expected that protection would remain against severe disease.
Early in the Omicron outbreak when BA.1 predominated, we recruited vaccinated volunteers who had suffered PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection—most were sequence-confirmed BA.1 infections or contacts of BA.1 confirmed cases, and all of the infections were mild. Early samples (n = 12, 9F and 3M; median age is 26; and median time since vaccine is 141 days) were taken ≤17 days from symptom onset (median is 12 days), and later samples (n = 14, 7F and 7M; median age is 23; and median time since vaccine is 111 days) were taken ≥28 days following symptom onset (median is 45 days). All cases had been vaccinated, all but 2 had received 2 doses, and 3 of the late convalescent cases received a third dose of vaccine following Omicron infection. Pseudoviral neutralization assays were performed against the panel of pseudoviruses described above ( Figures 2 C and 2D).
As we have previously described, BA.1 infection following vaccination leads to a broad neutralizing response, with high titers to all the VoC, which is boosted at later time points ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ). Neutralization titers against BA.4/5 were significantly less than those against BA.1 and BA.2. At the early time point, BA.4/5 titers were reduced 1.9- (p = 0.0005) and 1.5-fold (p = 0.0015) compared with BA.1 and BA.2, respectively. At the later point, BA.4/5 titers were reduced 3.4- (p = 0.0001) and 2-fold (p = 0.0017) compared with BA.1 and BA.2, respectively.
Thus, BA.4/5 shows a degree of immune escape from the vaccine/BA.1 response when compared with BA.1 and BA.2. These samples were all taken reasonably close to the time of infection meaning that further waning in the intervening months may render individuals susceptible to reinfection with BA.4/5.
We have recently reported a panel of potent human mAb generated from cases of Omicron breakthrough infection ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ). For the 28 most potent mAbs (BA.1 IC50 titers <100 ng/mL), we used pseudoviral assays to compare BA.4/5 neutralization with the neutralization of BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3 ( Figures 3 and S2 ). The neutralization of BA.4/5 was completely knocked out for 10/28 mAbs. Four further mAbs (Omi-09, 12, 29, and 35) showed >5-fold reduction in the neutralization titer of BA.4/5 compared with BA.2. All of these antibodies interact with the RBD, with the exception of Omi-41, which binds the NTD and specifically neutralizes BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 but not BA.2 or BA.4/5 (for unknown reasons, Omi-41 can neutralize wild-type (WT) Victoria virus but not Victoria pseudovirus) ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ).

Section: Sensitivity to L452R

We have previously reported that Omi-24, 30, 31, 34, and 41 show complete knockout of neutralizing activity against Delta, with Omi-06 showing a severe knockdown of activity ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ). Since BA.1 and BA.2 harbor only one (T478K) of the 2 Delta RBD mutations, while BA.4/5 also harbor L452R, we would expect all five of these L452-directed mAbs to be knocked out on BA.4/5. This is indeed observed ( Figures 3 and S2 ). Omi-41 also fails to neutralize, which is attributed to the differences in mutations in the NTD ( Figure 1 A).
To confirm that the neutralization effects observed are directly attributable to alterations in RBD interactions, we also performed binding analyses of selected antibodies to BA.4/5 and BA.2 RBDs by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) ( Figures 4 and S3 ). Omi-31 was chosen as the representative of the set of L452R sensitive antibodies, and as expected, the binding is severely affected ( Figure 4 A). Since we have detailed information on the interaction of several Omicron responsive antibodies with the RBD, including Omi-31, we modeled the BA.4/5 RBD mutations in the context of known structures for Omicron Fabs complexed with BA.1 or Delta RBDs ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 8. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 leads to widespread escape from neutralizing antibody responses Cell. 2022; 185 :467-484 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ; Figure 5 ). The Omi-31 complex is shown in Figure 5 A, and it reveals that L452 is tucked neatly into a hydrophobic pocket, which is unable to accommodate the larger positively charged arginine in BA.4/5 and Delta without major conformational changes.
Omi-32 shows 77-fold enhanced neutralization of BA.4/5 compared with BA.2. Kinetic analysis of Fab binding to the RBDs suggests that this is mainly achieved by a 5-fold increase in the on rate of binding ( Figures 4 B and 4C). This could be explained by the arginine at 452 making a salt bridge to residue 99 of the heavy-chain (HC) CDR3 ( Figure 5 B). It is possible that electrostatic changes enhance on rate by electrostatic steering of the incoming antibody.

Section: Sensitivity to F486V

Extending the logic used to understand Delta sensitivity, the remaining antibodies affected by BA.4/5 > BA.2, but which retain activity against Delta, namely Omi-02, 09, 12, 23, 25, 26, and 29, are likely sensitive to the F486V change. The binding sensitivity was confirmed by SPR analysis of Omi-12, a VH1-58 family member, which, like AZD 8895 (below), binds over F486 ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ; Figures 4 D and 4E) and showed an almost 1,000-fold reduction in affinity to BA.4/5.
Another example of the structural basis of sensitivity to F486V is provided by Omi-25, which shows reduced binding and no neutralizing activity against BA.4/5 ( Figures 3 and S3 J). The Omi-25 complex shows that the phenylalanine side chain acts as a binding hotspot, nestled in a hydrophobic cavity making favorable ring-stacking interactions with Y106 of the HC CDR3 ( Figure 5 C).
We tested a panel of antibodies that have been developed for therapeutic/prophylactic use against BA.4/5 ( Figures 3 and S4 ). Many of these antibodies have already suffered severe reductions or knockout of activity against BA.1, BA.1.1, or BA.2. For AstraZeneca AZD1061, activity against BA.4/5 was similar to that against BA.2 (<2-fold reduction), while for AZD8895, residual activity against BA.2 was knocked out. The activity of the combination of both antibodies in AZD7442 ( Dong et al., 2021 13. Dong, J. ∙ Zost, S.J. ∙ Greaney, A.J. ... Genetic and structural basis for recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by a two-antibody cocktail Nat. Microbiol. 2021; 6 :1233-1244 Crossref Scopus (164) PubMed Google Scholar ) was reduced 8.1-fold compared with BA.2. The residual activity of REGN10987 ( Weinreich et al., 2021 42. Weinreich, D.M. ∙ Sivapalasingam, S. ∙ Norton, T. ... REGN-COV2, a neutralizing antibody cocktail, in outpatients with Covid-19 N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384 :238-251 Crossref Scopus (1195) PubMed Google Scholar ) against BA.2 was further reduced on BA.4/5; likewise, residual BA.1 neutralizing activity was knocked out for ADG20 ( Yuan et al., 2022 47. Yuan, M. ∙ Zhu, X. ∙ He, W.-T. ... A broad and potent neutralization epitope in SARS-related coronaviruses Preprinta at bioRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ) on BA.4/5. For S309 (VIR-7831/7832) ( Sun and Ho, 2020 38. Sun, Y. ∙ Ho, M. Emerging antibody-based therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 during the global pandemic Antib Ther. 2020; 3 :246-256 PubMed Google Scholar ), the activity against BA.4/5 was 1.6-fold reduced compared with BA.2.
These effects can be rationalized by reference to the way the antibodies interact with the RBD; for instance, in the case of AZD8895 (an IGVH1-58 genotype mAb, Figure 5 D), F486 forms a hydrophobic interaction hotspot, which will be abrogated by the mutation to a much smaller valine side chain. Antibody residues involved in the interactions with F486 are highly conserved among this genotype of mAbs, including Omi-12, 253, and Beta-47 ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ; Dejnirattisai et al., 2021a 9.

The antigenic anatomy of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain Cell. 2021; 184 :2183-2200 e22 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (229) PubMed Google Scholar ; Liu et al., 2021b 27. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The Beta mAb response underscores the antigenic distance to other SARS-CoV-2 variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ), explaining the severe effect of the F486V mutation on neutralization of these mAbs ( Figures 3 and S5 ).
Both Omi-3 (a representative of the IGVH3-53 gene family) and AZD8895 (IGVH1-58) make contact with F486. While the F486V mutation has little effect on Omi-3 ( Figures 3 , 4 F, 4G, and 5 E), it seriously reduces the neutralization of AZD8895 and other IGVH1-58 mAbs, e.g., Omi-12 ( Figures 3 , 4 D, 4E, and 5 D). It is notable that whereas the numerous Omi series antibodies belonging to the closely related IGVH3-53 and IGVH3-66 gene families (9/28 in total Figure S2 ) are almost entirely resilient to the BA.4/5 changes, the large majority of antibodies from these gene families elicited against earlier variants are knocked out on BA.1 and BA.2 ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ), consistent with selection of a subset of antibodies by breakthrough Omicron infection that is insensitive to the further BA.4/5 mutations.
The effects on antibodies with broadly similar epitopes can vary dramatically, and this is equally true for antibodies, which have 452 or 486 central to their binding footprint. Thus, Omi-31 (IGVH1-69) and Omi-32 (IGVH3-33) both bind in front of the right shoulder with their CDR-H3 positioned close to 452; while the activity of Omi-31 is abolished by L452R (as detailed above), Omi-32 is markedly enhanced ( Figures 3 , 5 A, 5B, and S2 ). Similarly, Omi-25 and Omi-42 both belong to the IGVH3-9 gene family, and their footprints are in the 486 region ( Figures 5 C and 5F). Omi-25 contacts F486, and thus, the neutralization of BA.4/5 is abolished. By contrast, Omi-42 does not contact either of the mutation sites, and neutralization is fully retained for BA.4/5 ( Figures 3 , 4 H, 4I, and 5 F).
We measured the affinity of BA.4/5 RBD for ACE2 by SPR ( Figures 6 A–6D). The affinity of BA.4/5 RBD was increased compared with the ancestral virus (Wuhan), BA.1, and BA.2 (approximately 3-, 3-, and 2-fold, respectively [BA.4/5/ACE2 KD = 2.4 nM]) ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2022 8. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Huo, J. ∙ Zhou, D. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-B.1.1.529 leads to widespread escape from neutralizing antibody responses Cell. 2022; 185 :467-484 e15 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (624) PubMed Google Scholar ; Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ), which is mainly attributed to an increase in binding half-life. Modeling of the ACE2/RBD complex suggests that the bulk of this effect comes from the electrostatic complementarity between ACE2 and the RBD contributed by the L452R mutation ( Figures 6 E–6G).
The neutralization data above has been used to place BA.3 and BA.4/5 on an antigenic map. We repeated the method used for the analysis of the Delta and Omicron variants ( Liu et al., 2021a 26. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ), where individual viruses were independently modeled allowing for serum-specific scaling of the responses ( STAR Methods ). The measured and modeled responses are shown in Figure 7 A (with 1,551 observations and 340 parameters, the residual error is 23%). The results are best visualized in three dimensions (see Video S1 ), but 2D projections are shown in Figure 7 B. This shows, as expected, that the Omicron sublineages are clustered together but well separated from early pandemic virus and earlier VoC. Among the Omicron cluster, BA.4/5 is the most distant from the pre-Omicron viruses; the distance between BA.4/5 and BA.2 is similar to that between BA.2 and BA.1.

Section: Discussion

Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in November 2019, a succession of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants have appeared with increased fitness; these variants have rapidly outcompeted the preceding strain and spread globally—the most recent, Omicron, appearing in late 2021.
Despite the availability of vaccines, the pandemic has not been brought under control, and through Omicron, infections are as high as ever. Although vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease, they are less effective at preventing transmission, particularly of the Omicron sublineages. The very high level of viral replication globally drives the accrual of mutations in the viral genome, and we are now seeing the assembly of dozens of individual changes in single viruses. Virus recombination, which was predicted, is now being detected, allowing the shuffling of complex genomes, such as XD (Delta/BA.1) and XE (BA.1/BA.2), which in the latter case, may be more transmissible ( https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063424/Tech-Briefing-39-25March2022_FINAL.pdf ).
How such large sequence jumps, such as that to the Omicron lineage, occur is not known. It has been suggested that these may be occurring in immunocompromised or HIV-infected cases, where chronic infections have been documented to last for many months or in some cases over a year. The selection of antibody escape mutations has been documented in such individuals ( Cele et al., 2022b 4. Cele, S. ∙ Karim, F. ∙ Lustig, G. ... SARS-CoV-2 prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease evolves extensive immune escape Cell Host Microbe. 2022; 30 :154-162 e5 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (122) PubMed Google Scholar ; Karim et al., 2021 20. Karim, F. ∙ Moosa, M.Y.S. ∙ Gosnell, B.I. ... Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and intra-host evolution in association with advanced HIV nfection Preprint at medRxiv. 2021; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ; Kemp et al., 2021 21. Kemp, S.A. ∙ Collier, D.A. ∙ Datir, R.P. ... SARS-CoV-2 evolution during treatment of chronic infection Nature. 2021; 592 :277-282 Crossref Scopus (620) PubMed Google Scholar ), and successive rounds of replication, recombination, and perhaps reinfection may be responsible for the selection of the constellation of S mutations found in the Omicron lineage.
BA.4/5, the most recently reported Omicron sublineages, seem to be taking hold in South Africa and may spread globally to replace BA.2. Although highly related to BA.2, BA.4/5 contain the 69-70 deletion in the NTD that was also found in Alpha, BA.1, and BA.3, together with additional mutations in the RBD (L452R and F486V). Thus, BA.4/5 has assembled mutations at all of the previously described positions in the VoC Alpha (N501Y), Beta (K417N, E484K, N501Y), Gamma (K417T, E484K, N501Y), and Delta (L452R, T478K), the only difference being E484A in BA.4/5 rather than E484K found in Beta and Gamma.
Here, we report a greater escape from the neutralization of BA.4/5 compared with BA.1 and BA.2. Serum from triple vaccinated donors has ∼2- to 3-fold reduction in neutralization titers compared with the neutralization of BA.1 and BA.2. Additionally, serum from breakthrough BA.1 infections in vaccinees shows ∼2- to 3-fold reduction in neutralization titers to BA.4/5 compared with BA.1 and BA.2. These reductions are in good agreement with the reductions of BA.4 and BA.5 neutralization titers reported following BA.1 vaccine breakthrough infections ( Khan et al., 2022 22. Khan, K. ∙ Karim, F. ∙ Ganga, Y. ... Omicron sub-lineages BA.4/BA.5 escape BA.1 infection elicited neutralizing immunity Preprint at medRxiv. 2022; Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar ). These data suggest that a further wave of Omicron infection, driven by BA.4/5, is likely, partly due to breakthrough of vaccine and naturally acquired immunity, although there is no evidence yet of increased disease severity.
Using a panel of potent mAbs generated from vaccinated individuals infected with BA.1, we show the importance of the two new RBD mutations in BA.4/5. The activity of many mAbs is either knocked out or severely impaired against BA.4/5 compared with BA.2. From the neutralization data on BA.4/5, compared with that on Delta, we have been able to impute the contribution of L452R and F486V, and by combining with SPR data, as well as previous mapping by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) competition matrices and detailed structural data ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ), we are able to understand the basis of these effects on neutralization and show that the L452R and F486V mutations both make major contributions to BA.4/5 escape.
It is clear that the Omicron lineage, particularly BA.4/5, has escaped or reduced the activity of mAbs developed for clinical use, with most mAbs showing complete knockout of activity. AZD7442 still shows activity against BA.4/5 (65 ng/mL), but 65-fold less than the activity against Victoria, and S309 activity against BA.4/5 is 8-fold reduced compared with Wuhan with IC50 titers >1,000 ng/mL. The reduction in the neutralizing activity of S309 reported here using pseudoviruses is less than that for WT viruses and may be due to differences in the assay format; for instance, the IC50 for BA.2 using pseudovirus is 638 ng/mL, while we reported 5,035 ng/mL using a WT virus ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ).
New monoclonals and combinations may be needed to plug the gap in activity and protect the extremely vulnerable and those unable to mount adequate vaccine responses. There is also a question about vaccines. All current vaccines use spike derived from the original virus isolated from Wuhan. Vaccines have been remarkably effective at reducing severe disease, and a triple dosing schedule has provided, at least in the short term, protection against Omicron. However, the prevention of transmission may become less effective as viruses evolve antigenically further from ancestral strains. Some argue for next-generation vaccines tailored to antigenically distant strains, such as Omicron, to give better protection, probably used in combination with boosters containing ancestral strains. While vaccination is unlikely to eliminate transmission, the combination of vaccines with boosting by natural infection will probably continue to protect the majority from severe disease.
Finally, it is impossible to say where SARS-CoV-2 evolution will go next, but it is certain that the virus will continue to drift antigenically. This may be a continuation along the Omicron lineage, or we may see a large jump to a completely new lineage, like the one from Delta to Omicron. The observation that of the 30-aa substitutions in BA.1, all but one was achieved by a single base change in the codon suggests that there remains plenty of antigenic space for SARS-CoV-2 to explore and the capacity for recombination, which has so far not been observed to have breakpoints within the major antigenic sites, could generate a more radical antigenic shift.
One of the limitations of this study is that serum was obtained at early time points following vaccination or breakthrough infection, so titers are likely to wane thereafter. In addition, the true in vivo protection induced by vaccination may be underestimated using in vitro neutralization assays where complement, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and T cell responses are not operative. It would also be interesting to look at BA.4/5 neutralization using serum from unvaccinated individuals who had suffered primary BA.1 infection where the degree of escape of BA.4/5 may be greater than that seen with the vaccine breakthrough BA.1 serum reported here.

Participants from the first wave of SARS-CoV2 in the U.K. and those sequence confirmed with B.1.1.7 lineage in December 2020 and February 2021 were recruited through three studies: Sepsis Immunomics [Oxford REC C, reference:19/SC/0296]), ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections [Oxford REC C, reference 13/SC/0149] and the Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID sub study [Sheffield REC, reference: 16/YH/0247]. Diagnosis was confirmed through reporting of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and a test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested in accredited laboratories. A blood sample was taken following consent at least 14 days after symptom onset. Clinical information including severity of disease (mild, severe or critical infection according to recommendations from the World Health Organisation) and times between symptom onset and sampling and age of participant was captured for all individuals at the time of sampling. Following heat inactivation of plasma/serum samples they were aliquoted so that no more than 3 freeze thaw cycles were performed for data generation.
Beta and Delta samples from UK infected cases were collected under the “Innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker family and household members” protocol affiliated to the Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID sub study discussed above and approved by the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee. All individuals had sequence confirmed Beta/Delta infection or PCR-confirmed symptomatic disease occurring whilst in isolation and in direct contact with Beta/Delta sequence-confirmed cases. Additional Beta infected serum (sequence confirmed) was obtained from South Africa. At the time of swab collection patients signed an informed consent to consent for the collection of data and serial blood samples. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand (reference number 200313) and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Gamma samples were provided by the International Reference Laboratory for Coronavirus at FIOCRUZ (WHO) as part of the national surveillance for coronavirus and had the approval of the FIOCRUZ ethical committee (CEP 4.128.241) to continuously receive and analyse samples of COVID-19 suspected cases for virological surveillance. Clinical samples were shared with Oxford University, UK under the MTA IOC FIOCRUZ 21-02.
Following informed consent, individuals with omicron BA.1 were co-enrolled into the ISARIC/WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections [Oxford REC C, reference 13/SC/0149] and the “Innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare worker family and household members” protocol affiliated to the Gastro-intestinal illness in Oxford: COVID sub study [Sheffield REC, reference: 16/YH/0247] further approved by the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee. Diagnosis was confirmed through reporting of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or a positive contact of a known Omicron case, and a test positive for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested in accredited laboratories and lineage sequence confirmed through national reference laboratories. A blood sample was taken following consent at least 10 days after PCR test confirmation. Clinical information including severity of disease (mild, severe or critical infection according to recommendations from the World Health Organisation) and times between symptom onset and sampling and age of participant was captured for all individuals at the time of sampling.
Pfizer vaccine serum was obtained from volunteers who had received three doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Vaccinees were Health Care Workers, based at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, not known to have prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 and were enrolled in the OPTIC Study as part of the Oxford Translational Gastrointestinal Unit GI Biobank Study 16/YH/0247 [research ethics committee (REC) at Yorkshire & The Humber – Sheffield] which has been amended for this purpose on 8 June 2020. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants enrolled in the study. Participants were sampled approximately 28 days (range 25-56) after receiving a third “booster dose of BNT162B2 vaccine. The mean age of vaccinees was 37 years (range 22-66), 21 male and 35 female.
Full details of the randomized controlled trial of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), were previously published (PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33220855/ /PMID: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702298/ ). These studies were registered at ISRCTN (15281137 and 89951424) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04324606 and NCT04400838). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the trial is being done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. The studies were sponsored by the University of Oxford (Oxford, UK) and approval obtained from a national ethics committee (South Central Berkshire Research Ethics Committee, reference 20/SC/0145 and 20/SC/0179) and a regulatory agency in the United Kingdom (the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency). An independent DSMB reviewed all interim safety reports. A copy of the protocols was included in previous publications ( Folegatti et al., 2020 16. Folegatti, P.M. ∙ Ewer, K.J. ∙ Aley, P.K. ...

Data from vaccinated volunteers who received three vaccinations are included in this study. Blood samples were collected and serum separated approximately 28 days (range 26-34 days) following the third dose.
Pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins from ancestral strain (Victoria, S247R), BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 were constructed as described previously ( Nie et al., 2020 32.

A similar strategy was applied for BA.3 and BA.4/5, briefly, BA.3 mutations were constructed using the combination fragments from BA.1 and BA.2. The resulting mutations are as follows, A67V, Δ69-70, T95I, G142D, Δ143-145, Δ211/L212I, G339D, S371F, S373P, S375F, D405N, K417N, N440K, G446S, S477N, T478K, E484A, Q493R, Q498R, N501Y, Y505H, D614G, H655Y, N679K, P681H, N764K, D796Y, Q954H, and N969K. Although BA.4/5 S protein shared some amino acid mutations with BA.2 ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ), to generate BA.4/5 we added mutations Δ69-70, L452R, F486V, and R498Q. The resulting S gene-carrying pcDNA3.1 was used for generating pseudoviral particles together with the lentiviral packaging vector and transfer vector encoding luciferase reporter. Integrity of constructs was sequence confirmed.
The details of the pseudoviral neutralization test are as described previously ( Liu et al., 2021b 27. Liu, C. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Nutalai, R. ... The Beta mAb response underscores the antigenic distance to other SARS-CoV-2 variants Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 30 :53-68 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (43) PubMed Google Scholar ) with some modifications. Briefly, the neutralizing activity of potent monoclonal antibodies generated from donors who had recovered from Omicron were assayed against Victoria, Omicron-BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.4/5. Four-fold serial dilutions of each mAb were incubated with pseudoviral particles at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 hr. Stable HEK293T/17 cells expressing human ACE2 were then added to the mixture at 1.5 x 10 4 cells/well. 48 hr post transduction, culture supernatants were removed and 50 μL of 1:2 Bright-GloTM Luciferase assay system (Promega, USA) in 1x PBS was added to each well. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 mins and firefly luciferase activity was measured using CLARIOstar® (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The percentage neutralization was calculated relative to the control. Probit analysis was used to estimate the dilution that inhibited half maximum pseudotyped lentivirus infection (PVNT50).
To determine the neutralizing activity of convalescent plasma/serum samples or vaccine sera, 3-fold serial dilutions of samples were incubated with pseudoviral particles for 1 hr and the same strategy as mAb was applied.
To generate His-tagged constructs of BA.4/5 RBD, site-directed PCR mutagenesis was performed using the BA.2 RBD construct as the template ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ), with the introduction of L452R, F486V and R493Q mutations.

The Constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing after plasmid isolation using QIAGEN Miniprep kit (QIAGEN).
Plasmids encoding RBDs were transfected into Expi293F™ Cells (ThermoFisher) by PEI, cultured in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression Medium (ThermoFisher) at 30 °C with 8% CO 2 for 4 days. To express biotinylated RBDs, the RBD-BAP plasmid was co-transfected with pDisplay-BirA-ER (Addgene plasmid 20856; coding for an ER-localized biotin ligase), in the presence of 0.8 mM D-biotin (Sigma-Aldrich). The conditioned medium was diluted 1:2 into binding buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, pH 8.0). RBDs were purified with a 5 mL HisTrap nickel column (GE Healthcare) through His-tag binding, followed by a Superdex 75 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM sodium chloride.
The surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare). All assays were performed with running buffer of HBS-EP (Cytiva) at 25 °C.
To determine the binding kinetics between the RBDs and mAb Omi-32 / Omi-42, a Biotin CAPture Kit (Cytiva) was used. Biotinylated RBD was immobilised onto the sample flow cell of the sensor chip. The reference flow cell was left blank. The mAb Fab was injected over the two flow cells at a range of five concentrations prepared by serial two-fold dilutions, at a flow rate of 30 μl min −1 using a single-cycle kinetics programme. Running buffer was also injected using the same programme for background subtraction. All data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore T200 Evaluation Software 3.1.
To determine the binding kinetics between RBDs and ACE2 / other mAbs, a Protein A sensor chip (Cytiva) was used. ACE2-Fc or mAb in the IgG form was immobilised onto the sample flow cell of the sensor chip. The reference flow cell was left blank. RBD was injected over the two flow cells at a range of five concentrations prepared by serial two-fold dilutions, at a flow rate of 30 μl min −1 using a single-cycle kinetics programme. Running buffer was also injected using the same programme for background subtraction. All data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using Biacore T200 Evaluation Software 3.1.
To determine the binding affinity of BA.4/5 RBD and mAb Omi-12, a Protein A sensor chip (Cytiva) was used. The Ig Omi-12 was immobilised onto the sample flow cell of the sensor chip. The reference flow cell was left blank. RBD was injected over the two flow cells at a range of seven concentrations prepared by serial twofold dilutions, at a flow rate of 30 μl min −1 . Running buffer was also injected using the same programme for background subtraction. All data were fitted to a 1:1 binding model using Prism9 (GraphPad).
To compare the binding profiles between BA.2 and BA.4/5 RBD for mAb Omi-06 / Omi-25 / Omi-26, a Protein A sensor chip (Cytiva) was used. mAb in the IgG form was immobilised onto the sample flow cell of the sensor chip to a similar level (∼350 RU). The reference flow cell was left blank. A single injection of RBD was performed over the two flow cells at 200 nM, at a flow rate of 30 μl min −1 . Running buffer was also injected using the same programme for background subtraction. The sensorgrams were plotted using Prism9 (GraphPad).
To compare the binding profiles between BA.2 and BA.4/5 RBD for mAb Omi-02 / Omi-23 / Omi-31, a Biotin CAPture Kit (Cytiva) was used. Biotinylated BA.2 and BA.4/5 RBD was immobilised onto the sample flow cell of the sensor chip to a similar level (∼120 RU). The reference flow cell was left blank. A single injection of mAb Fab was performed over the two flow cells at 200 nM, at a flow rate of 30 μl min −1 . Running buffer was also injected using the same programme for background subtraction. The sensorgrams were plotted using Prism9 (GraphPad).
AstraZeneca and Regeneron antibodies were provided by AstraZeneca, Vir, Lilly and Adagio antibodies were provided by Adagio. For the in-house antibodies, heavy and light chains of the indicated antibodies were transiently transfected into 293Y cells and antibody purified from supernatant on protein A as previously described ( Nutalai et al., 2022 33. Nutalai, R. ∙ Zhou, D. ∙ Tuekprakhon, A. ... Potent cross-reactive antibodies following Omicron breakthrough in vaccinees Cell. 2022; Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (86) Google Scholar ). Fabs were digested from purified IgGs with papain using a Pierce Fab Preparation Kit (Thermo Fisher), following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Crystals of BA.4 RBD/Beta-27 complex were grown from 4% (v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1M BIS-Tris propane, pH9.0, 20% (w/v) PEG monomethyl ether 5000 using the sitting drop method and nanobody NbC1 as a crystallisation chaperon. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline I03 of Diamond Light Source, UK, using the automated queue system that allows unattended automated data collection ( https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/I03/I03-Manual/Unattended-Data-Collections.html ). Structures were determined by molecular replacement with PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 29. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J Appl Crystallogr. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (15800) PubMed Google Scholar ). VhVl and ChCl domains of Beta-27 ( Liu et al., 2021a 26. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ) and RBD/NbC1 complex (PDB, 7OAP) were used as search models. Model rebuilding was done with COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 14. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (19612) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement with Phenix ( Liebschner et al., 2019 25. Liebschner, D. ∙ Afonine, P.V. ∙ Baker, M.L. ... Macromolecular structure determination using X-rays, neutrons and electrons: recent developments in Phenix Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2019; 75 :861-877 Crossref Scopus (3061) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Data collection and structure refinement statistics are given in Table S1 and structural details in Figure S1 . Structural comparisons used SHP ( Stuart et al., 1979 37. Stuart, D.I. ∙ Levine, M. ∙ Muirhead, H. ... Crystal structure of cat muscle pyruvate kinase at a resolution of 2.6 A J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134 :109-142 Crossref Scopus (387) PubMed Google Scholar ) and figures were prepared with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.2r3pre, Schrödinger, LLC).
Antigenic mapping of Omicron was carried out through an extension of a previous algorithm ( Liu et al., 2021a 26. Liu, C. ∙ Ginn, H.M. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... Reduced neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 by vaccine and convalescent serum Cell. 2021; 184 :4220-4236.e13 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (520) PubMed Google Scholar ). In short, coronavirus variants were assigned three-dimensional coordinates whereby the distance between two points indicates the base drop in neutralization titre. Each serum was assigned a strength parameter which provided a scalar offset to the logarithm of the neutralization titre. These parameters were refined to match predicted neutralization titres to observed values by taking an average of superimposed positions from 30 separate runs. The three-dimensional positions of the variants of concern: Victoria, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron were plotted for display.
Statistical analyses are reported in the results and figure legends. Neutralization was measured on pseudovirus. The percentage reduction was calculated and IC 50 determined using the probit program from the SPSS package. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for the analysis and two-tailed P values were calculated on geometric mean values.
