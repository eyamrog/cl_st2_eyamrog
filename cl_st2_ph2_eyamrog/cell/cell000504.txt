Title: Human antibody C10 neutralizes by diminishing Zika but enhancing dengue virus dynamics


Abstract: Summary

The human monoclonal antibody (HmAb) C10 potently cross-neutralizes Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus. Analysis of antibody fragment (Fab) C10 interactions with ZIKV and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) particles by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) shows that Fab C10 binding decreases overall ZIKV particle dynamics, whereas with DENV2, the same Fab causes increased dynamics. Testing of different Fab C10:DENV2 E protein molar ratios revealed that, at higher Fab ratios, especially at saturated concentrations, the Fab enhanced viral dynamics (detected by HDXMS), and observation under cryo-EM showed increased numbers of distorted particles. Our results suggest that Fab C10 stabilizes ZIKV but that with DENV2 particles, high Fab C10 occupancy promotes E protein dimer conformational changes leading to overall increased particle dynamics and distortion of the viral surface. This is the first instance of a broadly neutralizing antibody eliciting virus-specific increases in whole virus particle dynamics.

Section: Introduction

Flavivirus infections are the most prevalent arthropod-borne diseases and are a major global public health burden ( Bhatt et al., 2013 3. Bhatt, S. ∙ Gething, P.W. ∙ Brady, O.J. ... The global distribution and burden of dengue Nature. 2013; 496 :504-507 Crossref Scopus (6734) PubMed Google Scholar ). Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are two serious pathogens belonging to the Flaviviridae family ( Westaway et al., 1985 28. Westaway, E.G. ∙ Brinton, M.A. ∙ Gaidamovich SYa ... Flaviviridae Intervirology. 1985; 24 :183-192 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). There are four DENV serotypes and one serotype of ZIKV ( Whitehead et al., 2007 29. Whitehead, S.S. ∙ Blaney, J.E. ∙ Durbin, A.P. ... Prospects for a dengue virus vaccine Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2007; 5 :518-528 Crossref Scopus (482) PubMed Google Scholar ). The mature flavivirus virion is composed of a single-stranded RNA genome, 3 structural proteins (capsid [C], envelope [E], and membrane [M]), and a lipid bilayer membrane ( Kuhn et al., 2002 15. Kuhn, R.J. ∙ Zhang, W. ∙ Rossmann, M.G. ... Structure of dengue virus: implications for flavivirus organization, maturation, and fusion Cell. 2002; 108 :717-725 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (1271) PubMed Google Scholar ). The virus surface comprises 180 copies of E and M protein heterodimers arranged with icosahedral symmetry ( Zhang et al., 2013a 30. Zhang, X. ∙ Ge, P. ∙ Yu, X. ... Cryo-EM structure of the mature dengue virus at 3.5-Å resolution Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :105-110 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ; Kostyuchenko et al., 2016 13. Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Lim, E.X. ∙ Zhang, S. ... Structure of the thermally stable Zika virus Nature. 2016; 533 :425-428 Crossref Scopus (384) PubMed Google Scholar ). The E proteins exist as 90 E protein dimers, with the protomers oriented in an antiparallel head-to-tail fashion ( Zhang et al., 2013a 30. Zhang, X. ∙ Ge, P. ∙ Yu, X. ... Cryo-EM structure of the mature dengue virus at 3.5-Å resolution Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :105-110 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three parallel E protein dimers (6 E protein protomers) constitute a raft, and 30 rafts are arranged in a herringbone pattern to form the icosahedral virus surface ( Zhang et al., 2013a 30. Zhang, X. ∙ Ge, P. ∙ Yu, X. ... Cryo-EM structure of the mature dengue virus at 3.5-Å resolution Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20 :105-110 Crossref Scopus (338) PubMed Google Scholar ). Each of the 60 asymmetric units are formed by three individual E proteins (molecules A, B, and C) ( Figure S1 A). A raft consists of two asymmetric units containing three dimers (A/C’, B/B’, and C/A’). The A/C dimers (either (A/C’ or C/A’) are hereafter referred to as L2 dimers and the B/B’ dimers as I2 dimers ( Figure S1 A), consistent with the accompanying paper by Sharma et al in this issue of Cell . Although the overall conformation of the L2 and I2 dimers is the same, they have different local environments on the virus surface ( Figure S1 A); one side of the L2 dimer is at the E-E inter-raft interface and the other side at the E-E interdimer interface, whereas the I2 dimer is surrounded by interdimer interfaces. An E protein consists of three ectodomains (DI, DII, and DIII) ( Modis et al., 2003 20. Modis, Y. ∙ Ogata, S. ∙ Clements, D. ... A ligand-binding pocket in the dengue virus envelope glycoprotein Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100 :6986-6991 Crossref Scopus (890) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is the major antigenic structure on the viral surface.
Previous studies using amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) showed that different serotypes and strains of DENV particles display varying magnitudes of intrinsic dynamics in solution ( Lim et al., 2017b 18. Lim, X.X. ∙ Chandramohan, A. ∙ Lim, X.Y. ... Conformational changes in intact dengue virus reveal serotype-specific expansion Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14339 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ) with reversible or irreversible conformational fluctuations ( Fibriansah et al., 2013 9. Fibriansah, G. ∙ Ng, T.S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ... Structural changes in dengue virus when exposed to a temperature of 37°C J. Virol. 2013; 87 :7585-7592 Crossref Scopus (150) PubMed Google Scholar ; Zhang et al., 2013b 31. Zhang, X. ∙ Sheng, J. ∙ Plevka, P. ... Dengue structure differs at the temperatures of its human and mosquito hosts Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110 :6795-6799 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) in response to an increase in temperature. This suggests that flaviviruses are highly dynamic particles in solution and that this property is critical for antibody recognition.
Recently, an important class of highly potent and broadly neutralizing E-dimer-dependent epitope (EDE) antibodies were isolated from individuals with mostly secondary dengue infections ( Dejnirattisai et al., 2015 6. Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Wongwiwat, W. ∙ Supasa, S. ... A new class of highly potent, broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from viremic patients infected with dengue virus Nat. Immunol. 2015; 16 :170-177 Crossref Scopus (361) PubMed Google Scholar ). Interestingly, C10 also exhibits potent neutralization of ZIKV ( Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016 2. Barba-Spaeth, G. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ∙ Rouvinski, A. ... Structural basis of potent Zika-dengue virus antibody cross-neutralization Nature. 2016; 536 :48-53 Crossref Scopus (408) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To uncover the basis of the broad neutralization of C10 with DENV and ZIKV, we set out to probe interactions of the antibody fragment (Fab) of C10 with the DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) New Guinea C (NGC) strain and ZIKV through an integrated approach combining cryo-EM and HDXMS. HDXMS offers a powerful thermodynamic readout of whole virus particles in solution ( Lim et al., 2017a 17. Lim, X.X. ∙ Chandramohan, A. ∙ Lim, X.E. ... Epitope and Paratope Mapping Reveals Temperature-Dependent Alterations in the Dengue-Antibody Interface Structure. 2017; 25 :1391-1402.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ) using backbone amides as conformational probes for dynamics at peptide resolution at the millisecond and slower timescales ( Englander and Kallenbach, 1983 8. Englander, S.W. ∙ Kallenbach, N.R. Hydrogen exchange and structural dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 16 :521-655 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). HDXMS of dengue whole virus particles mapped viral surface breathing dynamic hotspots and temperature-dependent expansion ( Lim et al., 2017a 17. Lim, X.X. ∙ Chandramohan, A. ∙ Lim, X.E. ... Epitope and Paratope Mapping Reveals Temperature-Dependent Alterations in the Dengue-Antibody Interface Structure. 2017; 25 :1391-1402.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Here we report the effects of Fab C10 binding to ZIKV and DENV2 (NGC strain). Fab C10 at saturating concentrations decreased ZIKV dynamics, whereas increasing the concentrations of Fab C10 induced overall increases in dynamics in DENV2. We observed that, at all Fab C10:E protein molar ratios (1:3, 2:3, and 3:3), Fab C10 shows a strong preference to bind L2 dimers over I2 dimers. At saturating Fab concentrations (3Fab:3E molar ratio), a subpopulation of viral particles becomes distorted, consistent with the increased E protein dynamics. Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar show that Fab C10 binding to the DENV2 E protein ectodomain dimer can result in distortion of the dimeric conformation for DENV2 but not for ZIKV. Our results show that Fab, when bound to DENV2, induces conformational changes in E protein and that, at high Fab occupancy, this conformational change can lead to the virus surface becoming distorted, which is also corroborated by the increases in E protein dynamics. These results highlight the contrasting effects the same Fab can have on the ZIKV and DENV2 surfaces.

Section: Results

Antibodies are capable of neutralizing viruses by various mechanisms; for instance, through inhibition of virus attachment to cells, inhibition of virus:endosomal membrane fusion, or both. To investigate whether the human monoclonal antibody (HmAb) C10 can prevent virus binding to target cells, immunoglobulin G (IgG) was mixed with DENV2 and then incubated with BHK-21 cells that were precooled at 4°C. The unbound virus was washed away, and then real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify the remaining virus bound to the cells. The result shows that IgG at the tested concentrations (0.1–10 μg/mL) inhibited virus attachment to cells by ∼50%–70% for DENV2 and ZIKV ( Figure 1 A). This suggests that the antibody is able to partially block virus attachment to BHK-21 cells.
We observed previously under cryo-EM that, for DENV, exposure to low pH (pH 5.0) caused virus aggregation. This is due to the individual virus particles fusing with each other, probably as a result of E proteins flipping up at low pH and then attaching to membranes of adjacent viral particles. This process mimics the structural changes necessary for fusion of DENV particles with the endosomal membrane at low pH. Therefore, we can use this assay to test whether Fab C10 could block structural changes that are required for fusion. Fab C10 was first added to DENV2 at pH 8.0, which mimics the extracellular environment. We subsequently lowered the pH from 8.0 to 6.5 (early endosome pH) or 5.0 (late endosome pH). The controls were uncomplexed virus particles under the respective pH conditions. Cryo-EM micrographs of uncomplexed DENV2 particles at pH 8.0 showed mostly particles with a smooth surface. At pH 6.5, most uncomplexed DENV2 particles were similar to those observed at pH 8.0, but some had undergone distortion. At pH 5.0, the uncomplexed virus particles appeared smaller and spiky and had aggregated. When Fab C10 was present, the virus particles did not aggregate under any of the above pH conditions, suggesting that Fab C10 binding was capable of inhibiting fusion ( Figure 1 B).
Our results indicate that HmAb C10 can partially prevent virus attachment to cells and inhibit virus-endosomal membrane fusion.
The C10 epitope has been mapped previously by cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography ( Zhang et al., 2016 32. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ; Rouvinski et al., 2015 23. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ), but those studies did not measure any viral surface protein dynamics changes upon antibody binding. Here we use HDXMS to map the epitope to peptide resolution and probe E protein surface dynamics ( Lim et al., 2017a 17. Lim, X.X. ∙ Chandramohan, A. ∙ Lim, X.E. ... Epitope and Paratope Mapping Reveals Temperature-Dependent Alterations in the Dengue-Antibody Interface Structure. 2017; 25 :1391-1402.e3 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (34) PubMed Google Scholar ; Mandell et al., 1998 19. Mandell, J.G. ∙ Falick, A.M. ∙ Komives, E.A. Identification of protein-protein interfaces by decreased amide proton solvent accessibility Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :14705-14710 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Interactions of Fabs on whole viral particles are influenced by the extensive E-E quaternary interactions on the whole virus. HDXMS will detect the E-E protein intrinsic dynamics and the antibody binding-induced changes in viral dynamics. Hereafter, the whole DENV2 particle and the recombinant DENV2 E protein ectodomain are referred to as DENV2 and sE, respectively. HDXMS of the Fab C10:sE protein maps the C10 epitope on sE proteins, whereas that of Fab C10:DENV2 captures a combination of epitope interactions with any allosteric/long-range changes of the E protein conformation induced upon antibody binding.
To map interactions of Fab C10 with ZIKV, we obtained 34 pepsin fragment peptides with high signal to noise and spanning 65.5% of ZIKV E protein amino acid sequences ( Figure S1 B). Decreases in deuterium exchange were observed in peptides spanning residues 69–82 ( b strand, bc loop), 90–107 ( c strand, cd loop), and 243–269 ( ij hairpin, α2 helix) ( Figure 2 A). These peptides spanned part of the C10 epitopes, including the fusion loop, identified from the cryo-EM structure of the Fab C10:ZIKV complex ( Zhang et al., 2016 32. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ).
On the antibody, we detected decreases in deuterium exchange in peptides spanning the heavy chain (residues 35–71, 94–106, and 116–123) and light chain (residues 19–32, 38–74, and 87–103) interfaces ( Figures S2 A–S2C). The heavy-chain peptide 35–71 spans complementarity determining regions (CDRs) HCDR2 (51, 52, 52A, and 53–57), 94–106 spans HCDR3 (92–100, 100A–100K, and 101–102), light chain peptide 19–32 spans LCDR1 (27, 27A–27C, and 28–32), 38–74 spans LCDR2 (49–52), and 87–103 spans LCDR3 (89–95, 95A, and 96–98). Importantly, we also observed peptides spanning residues 243–269 ( ij hairpin) from the E protein intradimer interface in ZIKV showed decreased exchange upon C10 binding, suggesting that Fab C10 binding stabilized the entire ZIKV particle ( Figures 2 B and 2C).
We next investigated Fab C10 interactions with recombinant DENV2 sE protein by HDXMS. Fab binding resulted in decreased deuterium exchange at multiple peptides corresponding to the epitope on the E protein (58–73, 83–107, 313–322, and 352–367) as well as peptides (238–260 and 270–278) ( Figures S2 D and S2E). Corresponding decreases in deuterium exchange in the Fab paratope were observed at peptides spanning the heavy (50–76) and light chains (50–74 and 75–81)) ( Figures S2 F and S2G, S3 A–S3G, and S4 A–S4H). Additionally, decreased exchange at the intradimer interface residues in peptides spanning residues 238–260 indicated that Fab binding resulted in reduced intradimer dynamics in the recombinant sE-protein dimer.
To map interactions of Fab C10 binding with DENV2 virus particles, Fab C10:DENV2 complexation was carried out by saturating DENV2 with Fab C10 at a molar ratio of approximately 3 Fab:3 E protein. Under our experimental conditions, we identified 13 optimal pepsin fragment peptides each for C10 heavy (sequence coverage, ∼82.5%) and light chains (sequence coverage, ∼97.2%) ( Figure S1 C). 1, 36, and 5 peptides of proteins C (sequence coverage, ∼10%), E (sequence coverage, ∼60.5%), and M (sequence coverage, ∼56%) were identified for DENV2 ( Figure S1 C).
In contrast to the Fab C10:ZIKV HDXMS results, none of the peptides across the DENV2 E and M proteins showed any decreases in deuterium exchange, as might be expected at the Fab:DENV2 interface ( Lim et al., 2017b 18. Lim, X.X. ∙ Chandramohan, A. ∙ Lim, X.Y. ... Conformational changes in intact dengue virus reveal serotype-specific expansion Nat. Commun. 2017; 8 :14339 Crossref Scopus (55) PubMed Google Scholar ). Instead, unexpectedly large increases in average deuterium exchange were detected across multiple peptides from E ( Figure 3 A) and M proteins ( Figure S4 C) in the Fab C10:DENV2 complex. A closer examination of the mass spectral envelope of the peptides showing increased average deuterium exchange revealed a broadening of the isotope envelope width with significantly more isotopic peaks in deuterium exchange peptides from E and M proteins when comparing Fab-bound and unbound DENV2 viral particles ( Figure 3 G). Mass spectra for deuterium exchange in representative peptides spanning epitope sites (peptides 78–103 and 83–107 [ c strand, cd loop], 214–230 [ hh’ hairpin], 238–260 [ ij hairpin], and 352–377 [DE loop]) are shown in Figure 3 G. The extent of peak broadening was not equivalent for all peptides. Certain peptides, such as residues 31–42 (C 0 strand, C 0 D 0 loop, and D 0 strand) showed no peak broadening. The broadening of peak width is reflective of the presence of multiple protein/particle conformations ( Weis et al., 2006 27. Weis, D.D. ∙ Wales, T.E. ∙ Engen, J.R. ... Identification and characterization of EX1 kinetics in H/D exchange mass spectrometry by peak width analysis J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17 :1498-1509 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). These included peptides spanning the E protein N terminus (residues 1–10), glycosylation sites (residues 57–69 [ a and b strands] and 152–163) [E 0 F 0 loop]), E-interdimer interface (residues 78–107 [ c strand, cd loop] and residues 214–230 [ hh’ hairpin]), and E-intradimer interface (238–260 [ ij hairpin] and 270–278 [ kl hairpin]) ( Figures 3 A and 3B). Several of these peptides ( Table S1 ) spanned the epitope residues identified previously ( Rouvinski et al., 2015 23. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ). In addition, we also detected increases in deuterium exchange in peptides spanning the stem helix (residues 27–47) of the M protein ( Figure S4 C).
The broader spread of the spectral envelopes shows low- and high-exchanging populations, indicating that Fab C10, when bound to DENV2, increased the number DENV2 conformations. The high-exchanging population represents regions with more rapid kinetics of association/re-association of Fab C10 to E protein on the DENV2 viral surface. Notably, loci exhibiting increased deuterium exchange localized to E protein dimer interface contacts in Fab C10:DENV2 (peptides 214–230 [ hh’ hairpin at the interdimer interface] and 238–260 [ ij hairpin] [intradimer interface]), indicating propagated increases in dynamics across the Fab C10:bound DENV2 viral particle. These two dimer interface peptides are outside of the epitope residues identified by X-ray crystallography ( Table S1 ; Rouvinski et al., 2015 23. Rouvinski, A. ∙ Guardado-Calvo, P. ∙ Barba-Spaeth, G. ... Recognition determinants of broadly neutralizing human antibodies against dengue viruses Nature. 2015; 520 :109-113 Crossref Scopus (272) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Fab paratope peptides showed characteristic decreases in exchange. These included the heavy (residues 50–76 [spanning HCDR2] and 104–112 [spanning HCDR3]) and light (residues 17–44 [spanning LCDR1], 50–74 [spanning LCDR2], and 80–106 [spanning LCDR3] chain peptides ( Figures 3 C–3E). Overall, Fab C10 binding resulted in increased exchange in DENV2 E protein, mapped on the virus particle (marked in red in Figures 3 B and 3G) and decreased exchange in specific heavy- and light-chain peptides from Fab C10 (marked in blue in Figure 3 E). Furthermore, comparable decreases in exchange across paratope sites in Fab C10 were seen in Fab C10:DENV2 and Fab C10-recombinant sE protein complexes. This indicated that Fab C10 is tightly bound to DENV2 without affecting the association/dissociation kinetics.
We next tracked Fab C10 interactions with DENV2 at sub-stoichiometric molar ratios of 1Fab:3E and 2Fab:3E by HDXMS. Decreases in deuterium exchange in E protein peptides spanning the C10 epitopes were detected at these molar ratios. Specifically, in the 1Fab:3E molar ratio sample, we detected decreases in deuterium exchange in peptides spanning C10 epitopes (residues 78–107, 307–321, 322–338, and 352–377) ( Figures 4 A and 4B). Importantly, peptide 78–107 also mediates interdimer interactions on DENV2. Interestingly, the effects of Fab C10 binding on inducing increased dynamics at sub-stoichiometric Fab concentrations were also observed at the two glycosylation sites (peptides 57–69 and 152–163) ( Figures 4 A and 4B). For easier comparison, deuterium exchange difference plots of sub-stoichiometric and saturating concentrations of Fab C10:DENV2 are shown side by side in Figures S3 A–S3C. This indicated that Fab C10 binding greatly increased the dynamics of the glycan loops on DENV2. Importantly, long-range propagated conformational changes arising from Fab C10 binding to E monomers were also detected as increases in deuterium exchange, observed in peptides spanning the stem helices (residues 27–47) of the M protein ( Figure S4 C). At a molar ratio of 2Fab:3E, similar magnitude decreases in deuterium exchange were observed in peptides spanning the C10 epitope (residues 78–107, 307–321, 322–338, and 352–377) ( Figures 4 C and 4D). Increases in deuterium exchange were now seen in peptides spanning the E-intradimer interface (residues 238–260) ( Figures 4 C and 4D), reflecting an induced conformational distortion at the E-intradimer interface. A closer examination of the isotopic envelopes of peptides spanning the C10 recognition site on the E protein revealed a characteristic bimodal envelope that was specific to the ratio of Fab C10 to DENV2 E protein and reflected the mixture of Fab C10-bound and unbound E protein present at sub-stoichiometric ratios. With increasing Fab C10 concentration, this envelope shifted to the right to merge into a higher exchanging population, expanding the overall width of the isotopic envelope ( Figure 4 E). An ensemble behavior of DENV2 E and M proteins in solution can be gleaned from deconvolution of mass spectral envelopes ( Figure S4 ).
Importantly, Fab C10 binding elicited long-range conformational changes across the entire DENV2 virion ( Figures 4 F and 4G). A close-up of the spectral envelope showed that Fab C10 binding elicited increased exchange of the higher-exchanging species. Centroids (filled triangles, Figure 4 E) of the higher-exchanging species (green dashed lines) for substoichiometric Fab C10:DENV2 complexes were shifted to the right compared with uncomplexed DENV2. Incrementally induced allosteric effects of Fab C10 binding (interdimer and inter-raft interaction peptides 214–230 [ hh’ hairpin], intradimer 238–260 [ ij hairpin]) resulted in an increase in the weighted average deuterium exchange. The greatest magnitude average increases in deuterium exchange were seen in fully saturated Fab C10:DENV2 complexes ( Figure 4 H). To measure the conformational heterogeneity induced by increasing Fab C10 binding, we applied a deconvolution function on mass spectral envelopes of deuterium-exchanged peptides showing spectral broadening using a deuterium exchange mass spectrum analysis program, HDExaminer version 3.2 (Sierra Analytics). Certain peptides, at substoichiometric concentrations of Fab C10, generated bimodal mass spectra of deuterium-exchanged states that could be deconvolved into two isotopic envelopes, each representing a separate deuterium-exchanging conformation within the ensemble. The results of this deconvolution are shown in Figure S4 for peptides 83–107, 238–260, and 33–47 from the M protein. Not all peptides showed bimodal distributions. E (peptides 4–10, 31–42, 199–205, 202–213, 214–230, and 378–387) showed unimodal exchange in all states examined. The deconvolution function used here broadly approximates mass spectral broadening into two conformational subpopulations, which does not preclude the presence of additional minor conformational subpopulations. However, it offers insights into ensemble behavior upon C10 binding by identifying loci showing conformational heterogeneity across the E protein.
As expected, similar decreases in deuterium exchange were observed in peptides spanning the Fab heavy and light chain in Fab C10:DENV2 complexes at sub-stoichiometric Fab:E ratios ( Figures S3 D–S3F). Additionally, decreases in deuterium exchange were observed in peptides spanning Fab paratope heavy (residues 50–76) and light (residues 50–74 and 75–81) chains at saturating 3Fab:3E molar ratios ( Figures 3 C and 3D).
These results suggest that Fabs at all stoichiometric ratios were bound tightly to the E protein on the viral surface, whereas the overall dynamics of the E protein across the virus increased drastically at saturating Fab C10 concentrations (3Fab:3E) ( Figures S3 C and S4 ).
We mixed Fabs with DENV2 at Fab:E molar ratios of 1:3, 2:3, and 3:3 at 28°C before flash-freezing on cryo-EM grids. After imaging, during the cryo-EM image reconstruction process, we conducted 2D and 3D classifications of picked particles from the cryo-EM micrograph and then averaged the particles within their respective class. We observed increased distorted/elliptical particles with increasing Fab concentration. At Fab:E molar ratios of 1:3, 2:3, and 3:3, we observed 0%, 3%, and 60.4% distorted particles, respectively ( Figures 5 A–5C). This suggests that increased Fab binding can cause distortion of viral particles. However, we are unable to determine the structure of these distorted particles because of heterogeneity of the particles and the inherent high dynamics/structural disorder.
We determined the cryo-EM structures of the intact spherical Fab C10:DENV2 complex particles at 1Fab:3E, 2Fab:3E, and 3Fab:3E molar ratios to 3.1 Å, 3.3 Å, and 3.6 Å, respectively ( Figures 6 A–6C and S6 ; Table S3 ). The 1Fab:3E and 2Fab:3E cryo-EM maps showed no binding to the I2 dimer and a gradual increase in binding to the L2 dimer (A-C dimer) with increasing Fab concentrations. Only at a 3Fab:3E molar ratio were weak Fab densities observed on the I2 dimer, whereas those on the L2 dimers were much stronger ( Figures 6 A and 6C). We calculated the Fab occupancy on the three individual epitopes in an asymmetric unit for all molar ratios of Fab:E protein cryo-EM maps ( Figure 6 D). The maximum Fab occupancy is always on the epitope on the L2 dimer, but it only reaches a maximum of 59%, even at saturated Fab concentrations. This suggests that not all epitopes are equally optimal for Fab binding.
To map interactions of Fab C10 with DENV2, we used the cryo-EM map of the Fab C10:DENV2 complex at a 3:3 Fab:E molar ratio, determined to an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. However, the local resolution of the Fab and the E protein interacting interface is 4.5 Å ( Figures 6 G and S5 A), and therefore we could only deduce their interacting residues by using 8-Å distance cutoffs between Cα chains. The C10 epitope straddles the E protein protomers within the dimer at the intradimer interface. Most of the residues in the epitope are the same between the L2 and I2 dimers ( Figure 6 E). Part of the epitope is on an E protein protomer: the b strand (residues 67–73), the bc loop (residues 69–82), the fusion loop (residues 102–106), and the ij hairpin (residues 246–247). The other part of the epitope is on the other E protein protomer: the D 0 strand (residues 46–47 on DI), the D 0 -a loop (residues 52 and 54 on DII), the glycan loop (residues 148, 149, 153, and 155–156 on DII), the kl hairpin (residues 273–274 on DII), and the DIII ABE β sheet region (residues 309, 325, and 361–364) ( Figures 6 E and 6G).
There are also differences in the C10 epitopes on the L2 and I2 dimers because of differences in their local environment. For the epitope on the I2 dimer, we observed that Fab C10 additionally binds residues across the interdimer E protein interfaces ( Figure 6 F). For the epitopes on both ends of the L2 dimer, one is located around the 5-f and the other around the 3-f vertices. The epitope around the 5-f vertex, in addition to the residues within the dimer, also consists of eight residues from a neighboring E protein across the inter-raft interface. They are mainly mediated by electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, the opposite epitope on the same L2 dimer around the 3-f vertex consists of residues identical to those on the I2 dimer. Therefore, the epitope around 5-f is unique compared with the other epitopes. In particular, the E protein rafts may display less tight contacts around 5-f, facilitating C10 binding at higher temperatures. The interdimer and inter-raft residues are not critical for binding because the Fab can also bind to soluble E dimer proteins, which do not have the higher quaternary E protein arrangements observed on the viral surface ( Sharma et al., 2021 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ).
To investigate the binding of a bivalent antibody, we used bivalent C10 F(ab’)2 to complex with virus particles. When mixed in solution, massive aggregation was observed by cryo-EM, preventing structural studies. To overcome this, we coated the C10 F(ab’) 2 onto thin carbon and then added DENV2 particles so that they were spaced out to reduce aggregation. We then added more F(ab’) 2 to coat the virus surface. Our cryo-EM images show some particles clustering together, but there are some individual particles that can be used for cryo-EM reconstruction ( Figure 7 A). The final resolution of the resulting DENV2:F(ab’) 2 map is 3.5 Å, and the antibody occupancy is low ( Table S2 ) because it can only be visualized at low contour levels ( Figure 7 B). We conducted localized reconstruction of the E protein raft with C1 symmetry. Classification showed that class I, forming 15% of the masked raft, had one F(ab’) 2 bound bivalently to two L2 E dimers, each around the 3-f vertex ( Figure 7 C). Class II (54% of the masked raft) had very low F(ab’) 2 densities that were distributed evenly around the 5-, 3-, and 2-fold vertices. Class III, forming 29% of the masked raft, had no F(ab’) 2 bound ( Figure S7 A). Comparison of the cryo-EM maps of the class I DENV:F(ab’) 2 localized reconstruction and the icosahedrally averaged whole DENV:Fab complexes ( Figure S7 B) showed that the distance between residues (Cys231) at the tip of the two Fab constant regions binding to the two neighboring 3-f vertices is closer in the DENV:F(ab’) 2 than in the DENV:Fab map: ∼40 Å versus ∼100 Å ( Figure S7 C). This suggests that the two Fabs at neighboring 3-f vertices in the DENV:F(ab’) 2 cryo-EM map are derived from the same F(ab’) 2 .

Section: Discussion

For cryo-EM reconstruction of the DENV2: F(ab’) 2 complex, we selected individual particles that did not aggregate; these particles may show more bivalent binding of a single F(ab’) 2 to two neighboring E protein dimers each around the 3-f vertices ( Figure 7 D). In this cryo-EM map, the densities of Fabs of F(ab’) 2 on the epitopes around the 5-fold or 2-fold vertices are very weak. However, we were still able to fit Fabs into the densities ( Figure S7 C). The angle and orientation of the two Fab molecules suggests that they are not derived from a single F(ab’) 2 . Hence, when a Fab arm of an IgG bound to one of these epitopes, the other Fab arm will not be able to engage any epitope within the same viral particle, and, hence, this Fab arm will likely bind to other viral particles, causing aggregation ( Figure S7 D). According to Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar , bivalency of IgG is important for neutralization for DENV2. There could be different neutralization mechanisms at different IgG concentrations. For example, it is possible at low antibody concentrations because of the higher avidity of the IgG toward the two epitopes (each from a L2 dimer) around neighboring 3-f vertices; this could be the preferential way of antibody binding. At high antibody concentrations similar to those in our cryo-EM studies with the F(ab’) 2 , the ability of F(ab’) 2 to aggregate virus particles could become an important contributor of neutralization. We observed that IgG, even at saturating concentrations, can only achieve partial occupancy. It is plausible that the bound IgG could cause vibrations/distortion of the surface, inducing the unbound E protein to change into fusion conformation, leading to virus aggregation. Alternatively, it could just be a function of the bivalent antibody binding to different viral particles.
There are possibly many ways DENV could attach to different receptors on different cells; e.g., dendritic cell-specific ICAM3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), heparin sulfate, etc. In our attachment assay, we used BHK-21 cells, and IgG C10 can partially block virus attachment to these cells. It has been suggested previously that DIII and the glycosylation site on the E protein are important for virus attachment to host cell receptors ( Hung et al., 2004 11. Hung, J.J. ∙ Hsieh, M.T. ∙ Young, M.J. ... An external loop region of domain III of dengue virus type 2 envelope protein is involved in serotype-specific binding to mosquito but not mammalian cells J. Virol. 2004; 78 :378-388 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because the C10 epitope consists of these two sites, antibody binding may block virus interaction with some receptors. It may not be possible for an antibody to block all types of receptor binding because there could be many receptors on different cell lines.
Regardless of which receptor the DENV engages, the virus will subsequently need to fuse with the endosomal membrane so that its viral genome can be released into the cell cytoplasm. Here we showed that Fab C10 can block structural changes that are required for fusion. It is known that fusion of a virus to the endosomal membrane is initiated by structural re-organization of E proteins on the virus surface upon exposure to low pH. This involves the E protein protomers within a dimer dissociating from each other and then re-organizing into trimeric structures ( Bressanelli et al., 2004 4. Bressanelli, S. ∙ Stiasny, K. ∙ Allison, S.L. ... Structure of a flavivirus envelope glycoprotein in its low-pH-induced membrane fusion conformation EMBO J. 2004; 23 :728-738 Crossref Scopus (500) PubMed Google Scholar ). Because Fab C10 binds across E proteins at the intradimer interface, it will lock E protein protomers in a dimeric structure, preventing the structural reorganization required for fusion.
During cryo-EM reconstruction of DENV2 complexed with the Fab C10 at saturating concentrations, we observed that 60% of the particles become distorted. This suggests that, at high antibody concentrations, there is an added mechanism of neutralization: by distortion of DENV particle.
Our HDXMS results indicated that Fab C10 interacts with ZIKV, resulting in overall decreased dynamics of the virus surface ( Figure 2 ), whereas with DENV2, Fab induced an overall increase in dynamics ( Figure 4 H). However, HDXMS of the Fab C10 paratope showed decreased dynamics, suggesting that the Fab is constantly bound tightly to its epitope. This is unexpected because one would think that the highly mobile DENV2 surface will negatively affect Fab binding. Superposition of the residues comprising the E protein epitopes (identified by cryo-EM) and the peptides with increased dynamics detected by HDXMS shows that only parts of them are overlapping. Because HDXMS reports a combination of Fab binding and dynamics effects and is unable to distinguish whether the sites that are undergoing dynamics are bound or not bound by Fabs, a mixture of conformational states likely contribute to the readout as a composite average deuterium exchange signal.
In the study by Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar , their crystal structure of variable domain fragment (ScFv) of C10 complexed with DENV2 recombinant E protein showed that binding of scFv C10 can induce hinge-like motions in the E protein dimer. We speculate that increasing Fab C10 beyond a threshold molar ratio of 2Fab:3E protein on the DENV2 surface promotes a new ensemble where a single Fab C10 binding to one site on a dimer results in an overall re-arrangement of the dimer so that a second Fab C10 likely cannot bind at the second site on the same dimer ( Sharma et al., 2021 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ). Further, Fab C10 shows preferential binding to the L2 dimer. It is possible that binding to the less favorable I2 dimer can be initiated only beyond the threshold molar ratio of 2Fab:3E protein, also inducing further motions of the E proteins. This accounts for the higher overall deuterium exchange at saturating Fab C10 concentrations. This is also consistent with cryo-EM results showing particle heterogeneity in the presence of saturating Fab C10.
All of our cryo-EM maps showed that the Fab densities on the I2 dimer are much weaker than on the L2 dimer. A possible reason why the Fab binds better to the L2 than the I2 dimer is shown by Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar : when the Fab C10 bind to part of its epitope ij loop, this will cause slight conformational changes to the connecting hh’ hairpin. This hairpin motion can likely be accommodated better in the inter-raft region than the interdimer interface, allowing more Fabs to bind to the L2 dimer. However, this slight change in the hh’ hairpin cannot be observed in our cryo-EM map because of the limitation of the resolution. Another reason could be that the Fab also binds to additional E proteins across the inter-raft region when bound to the L2 dimer compared with the I2 dimer ( Figure 6 F).
Given the high dynamics of E proteins detected by the HDXMS, it is surprising that we could obtain a high-resolution cryo-EM map of the Fab:DENV complex at a molar ratio of 3Fab:3E. Analysis of the local resolution ( Figure S5 A) and B-factor distribution ( Figure S5 B) suggests no large differences in mobility between the L2 and I2 dimers. Therefore, it suggests that the cryo-EM-reconstructable spherical Fab:DENV2 particles are not the ones that are undergoing increased dynamics.
The Fab occupancies on the cryo-EM reconstructable DENV2 spherical particles reach a maximum of only 59% at best at even saturating Fab concentration (molar ratio of 3Fab:3E) ( Figure 6 D), suggesting that none of these epitopes on this spherical viral surface are the most optimal for Fab binding ( Figure 6 A). Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar showed that Fab C10, when bound to the DENV2 sE protein dimer, distorts the dimeric structure; perhaps this is the most optimal conformation for Fab C10 binding. These conformational changes are restricted in the context of the spherical viral particles because of the extensive E-to-E interactions at the interdimer and inter-raft interfaces and, hence, were not observed in our cryo-EM structure. However, from the 2D and 3D class averages, we observed that, at saturating Fab concentrations, in total there are 60.4% distorted virus particles (which are not reconstructable). We speculate that, on these particles, there is higher Fab occupancy; this may push some E protein dimers to undergo conformational changes, as observed in the crystal structure of the Fab C10:sE protein in Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar . This is consistent with the dramatic increase in dynamics detected by HDXMS for the 3Fab:3E molar ratio compared with 1Fab:3E and 2Fab:3E ( Figures S3 A–S3C). Thus, the increase in dynamics detected by HDXMS may be contributed by these distorted particles, which skew the weighted average deuterium exchange across the sample.
The cryo-EM structure of the Fab C10-ZIKV complex showed mostly equal C10 densities on their epitope across all asymmetric units under saturating C10 concentrations ( Zhang et al., 2016 32. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This is consistent with Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar showing that the paratope and the ZIKV E protein dimer epitope complement each other very well; hence, no distortion of E protein is needed for optimal Fab binding. This is consistent with its strong Fab neutralization activity for ZIKV ( Sharma et al., 2021 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ). For DENV2, because optimal Fab binding requires distortion of the E protein dimer on the virus surface, which is restricted because of the virus quaternary structure, the neutralizing activity of the Fab is much poorer ( Sharma et al., 2021 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar ).
An antibody can neutralize a virus through a combination of mechanisms: inhibition of attachment, inhibition of fusion, and inducing distortion of the virus surface. The ability of an antibody to induce large-scale viral structural changes has not been studied widely; our current work shows the relationship of induced conformational changes by antibodies with the stability of virus quaternary structure.
From our study, the dynamics induced by Fab occur only upon binding to DENV2 and not ZIKV, which suggests that antibody-induced distortion of virus particles is not part of the mechanism of neutralization for ZIKV. The ability of the antibody to partially block attachment and fusion ( Zhang et al., 2016 32. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and achieve full occupancy on the ZIKV surface is sufficient to cause neutralization. According to the study by Sharma et al. (2021) 25. Sharma, A. ∙ Zhang, X. ∙ Dejnirattisai, W. ... The epitope arrangement on flavivirus particles contributes to Mab C10’s extraordinary neutralization breadth across Zika and dengue viruses Cell. 2021; 184 Published online November 30, 2021 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Google Scholar , C10 has a similar binding and neutralization profile across DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. This suggests that C10 most likely can also cause particle distortion of DENV3 and DENV4. However, this requires further evaluation using a combination of cryo-EM and HDXMS.
The attachment assay used IgG antibodies, whereas for HDXMS experiments, we could only analyze Fab complexes because IgG caused virus aggregation and sample heterogeneity, precluding HDXMS analysis. For cryo-EM study of the IgG:DENV2 complex, we could only analyze the non-aggregated individual particles, even though the sample contained lots of aggregates. Therefore, HDXMS and cryo-EM studies could only show limited information regarding the effect of IgG on virus particles.

Mature DENV2 (NGC) and ZIKV were produced and purified as below: Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum at 29°C. At 80% confluency, the cells were inoculated with ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or DENV2 NGC strain at a MOI of 0.1 and incubated at 29°C for 4 days. The virus-containing media was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 1 h. Virus was precipitated overnight from the supernatant using 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 in NTE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA) and the suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 1 h. The resulting pellet containing the virus was resuspended in NTE buffer and then purified through a 24% (w/v) sucrose cushion followed by a linear 10%–30% w/v potassium tartrate gradient. The virus band, visualized by its light scattering ability, was extracted, buffer exchanged into NTE buffer and concentrated using a concentrator with 100-kDa molecular weight cut-off filter. All steps of the purification procedure were done at 4°C. Amounts and concentrations of purified DENV2 (NGC) and ZIVK particles were estimated by comparing the corresponding E-protein band intensity with the band intensities of BSA standards of known concentrations on as SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue dye. Purified mature DENV2 (NGC) and ZIKV corresponding to 0.25 mg/mL and 0.1mg/mL of E-protein in the virus samples was used for subsequent HDXMS experiments.
Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells (ThermoFisher (Invitrogen) Cat. No: R69007, Singapore) were transfected with pMT/BiP/V5-HisA plasmid encoding soluble deletion mutant of soluble E-protein (residues 1-394) from DENV2. Recombinant E-protein was glycosylated at identical positions (N67, N153) as viral E-protein as shown previously (Lim et al., 2017). Tissue culture supernatant containing the recombinant E-protein was purified using 4.8 A affinity column, washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 5 and eluted with 0.1 M Glycine-HCl, pH 2.7. Eluted recombinant E-protein was dialyzed with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 and concentrated to a final concentration of 1.0 mg/mL.
Soluble C10 IgG was expressed in HEK293T cells that were co-transfected with plasmids containing the C10 heavy and light chain variable regions sequences ( Zhang et al., 2016 32. Zhang, S. ∙ Kostyuchenko, V.A. ∙ Ng, T.S. ... Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 :13679 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and purified by protein A affinity chromatography. Purified C10 IgG was subsequently resuspended in 200 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaOAc, pH 7.0. The Fab fragments of C10 were generated from overnight digestion of the purified IgG (8 mg/mL) with immobilized papain (Thermo scientific) at 37°C. The Fab fragments were purified by anion exchange chromatography (resource Q, GE Healthcare) followed by gel filtration (Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) and subsequently concentrated to 3 mg/mL.
Purified ZIKV was pre-equilibrated at 28°C for 30 min followed by incubation of ZIKV with slight molar excess of C10 Fab fragment in a molar ratio of 1 E-protein: 1.2 Fab C10 to ensure saturated binding at 28°C for 40 min.
Purified unexpanded DENV2 (DENV2) was pre-equilibrated at 28°C for 30 min followed by incubation of DENV2 with slight molar excess of C10 Fab fragment in a molar ratio of 1 E-protein: 1.2 Fab C10 to ensure saturated binding with Fab at 28°C for 40 min.
DENV2 complexed with C10 fab fragments under non-saturated binding conditions (1:3 and 2:3 ratios of C10 to E-proteins)
Purified DENV2 was pre-equilibrated at 28°C for 30 min followed by incubation of DENV2 with C10 Fab fragment in a molar ratio of 1 C10: 3 E-proteins or 2 C10: 3 E-proteins at 28°C for 40 min.
Purified recombinant E-proteins (1.0 mg/mL) was equilibrated with the Fab fragment of C10 in a molar ratio of 1 unassembled E-protein: 1.2 Fab C10 for 40 min at 28°C.
Fab C10:DENV2 complex was formed as described above. The samples were incubated at 28°C before freezing on cryoEM grids. The 400 mesh grids with a less than 3nm thick carbon lacey support (TED PELLA, INC) were glow-discharged at 5mA for 1min using Emitech K100X Glow Discharge Unit. About 2.1 μL of samples were applied to the grids, blotted with a filter paper (Ted Pella Standard Vitrobot filter paper, Grade 595) for 8 s (Blot force 4, Blot Time 8 s, Drain time 0.5 s, Humidity 100%) to remove excess sample, and then flash frozen in liquid ethane by using the Vitrobot Mark IV plunger (FEI, Netherland). To ensure temperature consistency, the temperature of the Vitrobot humidity chamber was adjusted to 22°C for blotting.
SerialEM was used to carry out the automated data collection. The datasets for 2Fab:3E molar ratio of 2:3 and F(ab’)2 uses beam shift for acquisition. Image shift was used to target 6 exposures per stage position for Fab ratio 1:3 and 3:3 with an image shift of 1.6 um. Images for all samples were recorded by movie mode, with similar total exposure of 2.9 s, 25 frames per movie and total dose of 25 e-/Å2. The frames from each “movie” were aligned using MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 33. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4520) PubMed Google Scholar ) to produce full dose images used for particle selection and orientation search, and images from the first several frames amounting to the dose of about 18 e-/Å2 for use in 3D reconstruction. The images were taken at underfocus in 0.8 to 2.0 μm range. In total, 3096, 2836, 3090 and 3819 micrographs were collected for Fab C10:DENV2 at Fab:E molar ratio of 1:3,2:3, 3:3 and the F(ab’)2:DENV2 complex, respectively. The astigmatic defocus parameters were estimated with Patch CTF estimation in Cryosparc ( Punjani et al., 2017 22. Punjani, A. ∙ Rubinstein, J.L. ∙ Fleet, D.J. ... cryoSPARC: algorithms for rapid unsupervised cryo-EM structure determination Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :290-296 Crossref Scopus (4045) PubMed Google Scholar ) and is corrected during orientation search. After automatically particle picking using Cryosparc, a total number of 355 475, 238 894, 235 059 and 120 326 particles of bin4 were selected for 20 rounds iterations of 2D classification in Cryosparc to produce 2D class averages. The 20 rounds iterations of 3D reconstruction with C1 symmetry were done with CryoSparc and Relion ( Scheres, 2012 24. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3645) PubMed Google Scholar ). The uncomplexed DENV2 (EMDB ID EMD-5520) was lowpass to 60 Å and used as the starting model. Classes with broken and distorted particles were removed. 109 712, 70 534, 42 509 and 38 387 individual particles from Fab C10:DENV2 at Fab:E molar ratio of 1:3,2:3, 3:3 and the F(ab’)2:DENV2 complex, respectively, were selected for further processing. Structure refinement was done, and icosahedral symmetry were applied to improve the resolution. The 3D reconstruction procedure produced the complex structures with resolutions of 3.1 Å, 3.3 Å, 3.6 Å and 3.6 Å for Fab C10:DENV2 at Fab:E molar ratio of 1:3, 2:3, 3:3 and the F(ab’)2:DENV2 complex using the Fourier shell correlation cutoff of 0.143 ( Figure S6 ; Table S3 ). Local map resolution was estimated with ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 14. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1315) PubMed Google Scholar ).
To further investigate the structures of FabC10:DENV2 (molar ratio 3Fab:3E) and also the F(ab’)2:DENV2 around the 2-fold vertices, we used Relion symmetry expansion and Scipion ( de la Rosa-Trevín et al., 2016 5. de la Rosa-Trevín, J.M. ∙ Quintana, A. ∙ Del Cano, L. ... Scipion: A software framework toward integration, reproducibility and validation in 3D electron microscopy J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 195 :93-99 Crossref Scopus (377) PubMed Google Scholar ) to extract subregions and perform localized reconstruction described as below ( Ilca et al., 2015 12. Ilca, S.L. ∙ Kotecha, A. ∙ Sun, X. ... Localized reconstruction of subunits from electron cryomicroscopy images of macromolecular complexes Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 :8843 Crossref Scopus (171) PubMed Google Scholar ). After 3D refinement with imposition of icosahedral symmetry, we extracted sub-particles from the 2-fold region or the asymmetry in a box-size of 220 × 220 pixels and expanded the sub-particles with I4 symmetry. The extracted sub-particles were used to generate the initial model using relion_reconstruct. 3D classification was then performed without alignment. Further refinement of best class of the FabC10:E protein raft (molar ratio 3Fab:3E) map led to a structure at 3.9 Å resolution, the class of F(ab’) 2 :E protein raft map, at 4.6 Å resolution. The resolution was assessed by Fourier shell correlation curve with a cutoff at 0.143 from two independent half-sets of the sub-particles. Local map resolution was estimated with ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al., 2014 14. Kucukelbir, A. ∙ Sigworth, F.J. ∙ Tagare, H.D. Quantifying the local resolution of cryo-EM density maps Nat. Methods. 2014; 11 :63-65 Crossref Scopus (1315) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The C10-DENV2 structures were interpreted by fitting in the free DENV2 (PDB ID 3J27 ) and Fab C10 (PDB ID 4UT9 ) first as rigid bodies in Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 21. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33480) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then refined with phenix.real_space_refine with default parameters plus rigid body refinement and secondary-structure and torsion restraints ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1519) PubMed Google Scholar ) and COOT was used to fix regions manually with poor geometry. ( Emsley and Cowtan, 2004 7. Emsley, P. ∙ Cowtan, K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 :2126-2132 Crossref Scopus (25430) PubMed Google Scholar ). The refined subunits were used to build the biological unit with the command sym in Chimera. The final coordinates of the asymmetric units were checked by MolProbity. Maps and structures shown in the figures were generated with PyMOL, Chimera and Coot.
the Fab occupancies on the three individual epitopes within an asymmetric unit were calculated by comparing the densities of the Fab with that of the E protein dimer in the “fit in map” tool in the program “Chimera.” The parameter “average map value” represent the trilinear interpolation of map gray values from the eight corners of the data cell enclosing each atom position. The ratio of the “average map values” for Fab to E protein was used to quantify Fab occupancy at each Fab binding site. The formula is the average map value of ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑎 ⁢ 𝑏 ÷ 𝐸 ⁢ 𝑑 ⁢ 𝑖 ⁢ 𝑚 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑟 ) × 1 0 0 %
Deuterium exchange buffer was prepared by solubilizing lyophilized NTE (12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) buffer in 99.9% D 2 O. D 2 O NTE buffers were incubated separately at 28 and 37°C for 30 min prior to deuterium exchange reactions to ensure temperature consistency during HDX labeling reactions. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange of C10-DENV2 complexes were initiated by 10X dilution of C10-DENV2 complexes with temperature equilibrated D 2 O NTE buffers (final D 2 O concentration of 89.9%). HDX of Fab C10 (3 mg/mL) was carried with D 2 O NTE buffer equilibrated at 37°C and HDX of sE (1.0 mg/mL) and C10-sE complexes were carried out with D 2 O NTE buffer equilibrated at 28°C.
We selected a single deuterium exchange time point of 1 min as we have previously shown that the deuterium exchange times from 1 min to 60 min showed minimal differences in the extent of deuteration across all the peptide in DENV2 (Lim et al., 2017). Furthermore, at fast timescales, HDXMS reports on changes at the antibody-antigen interface and any associated propagated conformational fluctuations detectable at these experimental timescales ( Mandell et al., 1998 19. Mandell, J.G. ∙ Falick, A.M. ∙ Komives, E.A. Identification of protein-protein interfaces by decreased amide proton solvent accessibility Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95 :14705-14710 Crossref Scopus (193) PubMed Google Scholar ). Hence, the shortest time point of 1 min offered a suitable window for mapping interaction interfaces of C10 with ZIKV by HDXMS. As such, deuterium exchange of free ZIKV and C10-ZIKV complex were carried out for 1 min.
Deuterium exchange labeling for all reactions were carried out for 1 min and carefully maintained at their respective indicated temperatures of 28°C and 37°C. Deuterium exchange were quenched by lowering the pHread to 2.5 upon addition of cold NaOH in GnHCl and Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP-HCl) to a final concentration of 1.5M GnHCl and 0.25M TCEP-HCl. 0.1 mg of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) were added to the quenched reaction mixture and incubated for 1 min with mixing at 30 s on ice to remove viral membrane phospholipids. TiO 2 were removed from the sample with 0.22 μm filter by centrifugation at 14,549 g for 1 min at 4°C. Collectively, TiO 2 treatment step resulted in an addition of 2 min to the sample handling time. In the case of recombinant E-proteins, C10-recombinant E-proteins and Fab C10, where viral phospholipids were not present, TiO 2 treatment step was replaced with 2 min incubation on ice to ensure equivalent post-quenching sample treatment time between C10-DENV2 complexes and these samples. All deuterium exchange reactions were performed in triplicate, and the reported values for every peptide are an average of three independent reactions without correcting for back exchange.
Quenched samples were injected into a chilled nano-UPLC HDX sample manager (Waters, Milford, MA) as described by Wales and Engen (2006) 26. Wales, T.E. ∙ Engen, J.R. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry for the analysis of protein dynamics Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25 :158-170 Crossref Scopus (716) PubMed Google Scholar and subjected to online pepsin digestion using the Waters Enzymate BEH pepsin (2.1 X 30 mm) column in 0.05% formic acid in water at 100 mL min -1 . Pepsin proteolysis peptides from the samples were trapped using a 2.1 mm X 5 mm C18 trap column (ACQUITY BEH C18 VanGuard Pre-column, 1.7 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted using an 8%–40% gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 40 mL min -1 into a reverse phase column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column, 1.0 X 100 mm, 1.7 mm, Waters) by nanoACQUITY Binary Solvent Manager (Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were ionized by electrospray into SYNAPT G2-Si mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) acquiring in HDMS E mode ( Li et al., 2009 16. Li, G.Z. ∙ Vissers, J.P. ∙ Silva, J.C. ... Database searching and accounting of multiplexed precursor and product ion spectra from the data independent analysis of simple and complex peptide mixtures Proteomics. 2009; 9 :1696-1719 Crossref Scopus (456) PubMed Google Scholar ) for detection and mass-measurements with ion mobility activated at wave height of 40V and velocity of 600 m/s. Peptides separated after ion mobility separation were carried by the transfer wave at height of 4V and velocity of 197 m/s. 200 fmol/μl of [Glu 1 ]-fibrinopeptide B ([Glu 1 ]-Fib) was simultaneously injected into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 μL/min for continuous calibration during sample acquisition.
Peptides of C-, E- and M-proteins from ZIKV and DENV2 were identified through independent searches of mass spectra from the undeuterated samples against individual ZIKV and DENV2 database containing the amino acid sequences of all the three structural proteins using PROTEIN LYNX GLOBAL SERVER version 3.0 (Waters, Milford, MA) software. Mass spectra of peptides from a single undeuterated sample were filtered using precursor ion mass tolerance of < 10 ppm, and products per amino acids of at least 0.2 with a minimum intensity of 5000 for both precursor and product ions. Five and three undeuterated samples were collected for DENV2 (NGC) and ZIKV samples respectively, and the final peptide list includes only peptides that fulfilled the above described criteria and were identified independently in at least 3 of the 5 undeuterated samples. In DENV2 dataset, the three glycopeptides (57-68, 57-69, 152-163) we similarly identified in DENV2 E-protein with the glycans detected in several of the fragment peptides as indicated from the previous study (Lim et al., 2017). Peptides of C-, E- and M protein from C10-DENV2 and ZIKV complexes were independently identified by searching the mass spectra of the undeuterated samples of the C10-DENV2 or C10-ZIKV complexes against their respective peptide list and were selected if they were identified independently in a minimum of 2 out of 3 undeuterated samples.
Peptides from recombinant E-protein were identified by searching the mass spectra of the undeuterated sample against a database containing the amino acid sequence of DENV2 (NGC) E-protein (1-394) and filtered according to the search criteria as indicated above. Mass spectra from three undeuterated samples were collected and peptides were retained if they were independently identified in a minimum of two out of three undeuterated samples. Peptides of the heavy and light chain of Fab C10 were identified by searching the mass spectra of the undeuterated sample against a database containing the heavy and light chain amino acid sequences following the search criteria as described above. Selected peptides were independently identified in at least 2 out of the three undeuterated samples. Corresponding heavy and light chain peptides of C10 from the C10-DENV2 complexes and C10-recombinant E-proteins were searched against this peptide list and selected if they were independently identified in at least 2 of the 3 undeuterated samples.
Deuterium uptake in all peptides were determined by subtracting the average mass centroid of deuterium exchanged peptides with the respective undeuterated peptides as described in the previous chapters. The difference in absolute number of deuterons between the two states compared was calculated by subtracting centroid masses of deuterated peptides between two experimental conditions. The differences in deuterons exchanged for all peptides from C-, E- and M-protein from DENV2/ZIKV and the heavy and light chain of C10 are represented in individual difference plots. The standard deviations for deuterium uptake in all peptides were determined and a difference of 0.5 Da was used as the significance threshold for differences in deuterium uptake across the two states compared and agrees with the observed standard errors measured in deuterated peptides ( Houde et al., 2011 10. Houde, D. ∙ Berkowitz, S.A. ∙ Engen, J.R. The utility of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry in biopharmaceutical comparability studies J. Pharm. Sci. 2011; 100 :2071-2086 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (299) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Deconvolution of mass spectral envelopes was carried out by HDExaminer version 3.2 (Sierra Analytics, Modesto CA) to check for ensemble behavior in solution, specifically to check for two distinct distributions of mass spectral envelopes. Each of these envelopes would represent distinct conformations in solution ( Weis et al., 2006 27. Weis, D.D. ∙ Wales, T.E. ∙ Engen, J.R. ... Identification and characterization of EX1 kinetics in H/D exchange mass spectrometry by peak width analysis J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 17 :1498-1509 Crossref Scopus (189) PubMed Google Scholar ). We set a threshold fit value score of 0.9 for the goodness of fit of the experimental mass spectral envelope for deuterium exchanged peptides with the theoretical envelope. If the fit score for a peptide is less than the threshold, the program will fit the spectral envelope to a bimodal distribution. If the score of the bimodal distribution is greater than that of the unimodal distribution, the program assigns a lower exchanging (left population) and a higher exchanging (right population). Results from deconvolution for three representative mass spectra are shown in Figure S4 .
