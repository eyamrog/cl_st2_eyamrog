Title: A Structure-Based Model for the Complete Transcription Cycle of Influenza Polymerase


Abstract: Summary

Influenza polymerase uses unique mechanisms to synthesize capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from the genomic viral RNA (vRNA) template, which is packaged inside ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs). Here, we visualize by cryoelectron microscopy the conformational dynamics of the polymerase during the complete transcription cycle from pre-initiation to termination, focusing on the template trajectory. After exiting the active site cavity, the template 3′ extremity rebinds into a specific site on the polymerase surface. Here, it remains sequestered during all subsequent transcription steps, forcing the template to loop out as it further translocates. At termination, the strained connection between the bound template 5′ end and the active site results in polyadenylation by stuttering at uridine 17. Upon product dissociation, further conformational changes release the trapped template, allowing recycling back into the pre-initiation state. Influenza polymerase thus performs transcription while tightly binding to and protecting both template ends, allowing efficient production of multiple mRNAs from a single vRNP.

Section: Introduction

The heterotrimeric influenza polymerase, with subunits PA, PB1, and PB2, binds to the conserved 5′ and 3′ termini, the “promoter,” of each of the eight negative sense, single-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) genome segments, which are packaged by the viral nucleoprotein (NP) into ribonucleoprotein particles (vRNPs). Following viral entry into the infected cell, vRNPs are transported to the nucleus where they associate with transcribing Pol II and the viral polymerase performs “primary” transcription to generate viral mRNA leading to viral protein synthesis ( Eisfeld et al., 2015; Pflug et al., 2017; Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016 6.

Influenza polymerase employs unique mechanisms to synthesize 5′ capped and 3′ poly-adenylated viral mRNA. Capped oligomers of 10–15 nt long, pirated from nascent Pol II transcripts, are used to prime transcription ( Lukarska et al., 2017; Plotch et al., 1981 22.

Polyadenylation is achieved by stuttering of the polymerase on an oligo(U) stretch proximal to the template 5′ end ( Poon et al., 1999 38. Poon, L.L. ∙ Pritlove, D.C. ∙ Fodor, E. ... Direct evidence that the poly(A) tail of influenza A virus mRNA is synthesized by reiterative copying of a U track in the virion RNA template J. Virol. 1999; 73 :3473-3476 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). The same vRNPs perform unprimed replication of vRNA into complementary cRNA, which is only stable when packaged into cRNPs using newly synthesized polymerase and NP ( Vreede et al., 2004 48. Vreede, F.T. ∙ Jung, T.E. ∙ Brownlee, G.G. Model suggesting that replication of influenza virus is regulated by stabilization of replicative intermediates J. Virol. 2004; 78 :9568-9572 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). cRNPs are the template for production of progeny vRNPs that can perform “secondary” transcription and/or be exported for packaging into new virions. Consistent with this, primary mRNA synthesis continues in cells infected in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, but the stable synthesis of cRNA is inhibited due to the lack of NP and polymerase ( Hay et al., 1980; Vreede et al., 2004 11. Hay, A.J. ∙ Skehel, J.J. ∙ McCauley, J. Structure and synthesis of influenza virus complementary RNAs Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Model suggesting that replication of influenza virus is regulated by stabilization of replicative intermediates J. Virol. 2004; 78 :9568-9572 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, a single primary vRNP can perform transcription without additional viral components ( Jorba et al., 2009 14. Jorba, N. ∙ Coloma, R. ∙ Ortín, J. Genetic trans-complementation establishes a new model for influenza virus RNA transcription and replication PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5 :e1000462 Crossref Scopus (129) PubMed Google Scholar ), and continued accumulation of viral mRNA in the presence of cycloheximide ( Vreede et al., 2004 48. Vreede, F.T. ∙ Jung, T.E. ∙ Brownlee, G.G. Model suggesting that replication of influenza virus is regulated by stabilization of replicative intermediates J. Virol. 2004; 78 :9568-9572 Crossref Scopus (173) PubMed Google Scholar ) shows that single vRNPs can perform multiple rounds of transcription. The implied efficient recycling mechanism is consistent with the need to rapidly generate large amounts of viral mRNA from the relatively small number of RNPs that initially infect the cell during a true infection ( Russell et al., 2018 42.

We have previously described how influenza polymerase accesses nascent host-capped transcripts by binding directly to the serine 5 phosphorylated CTD of Pol II ( Lukarska et al., 2017 22. Lukarska, M. ∙ Fournier, G. ∙ Pflug, A. ... Structural basis of an essential interaction between influenza polymerase and Pol II CTD Nature. 2017; 541 :117-121 Crossref Scopus (93) PubMed Google Scholar ), how rotation of the PB2 cap-binding domain allows the capped primer to be excised by the PA endonuclease and then directed into the polymerase active site to initiate RNA synthesis ( Kouba et al., 2019; Pflug et al., 2018; Reich et al., 2014 16.

Structural insight into cap-snatching and RNA synthesis by influenza polymerase Nature. 2014; 516 :361-366 Crossref Scopus (356) PubMed Google Scholar ), and revealed the sequence of conformational changes that accompany the transition from the initiation to elongation phase of transcription ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we present a detailed mechanistic model of the entire cycle of mRNA synthesis by influenza polymerase based on high resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of actively transcribing bat influenza A (FluA) polymerase that cover the complete transcription cycle from pre-initiation, through elongation and termination, to product dissociation and template recycling. These structures give new insight into the template trajectory after passing through the active site, the mechanics of poly-adenylation, and how template recycling likely occurs. In particular, we find that after translocation through the active site, the 3′ extremity of the template docks into a partially buried binding site on the polymerase surface and remains sequestered there through termination and product dissociation. By tightly holding on to both extremities of the template throughout mRNA synthesis, the polymerase both protects the template from degradation and can efficiently recycle it, reform the promoter, and initiate the next cycle of transcription. The proposed model is fully compatible with transcription occurring, physiologically, in the RNP context, which necessitates NP uncoating and recoating of the incoming and outgoing template strands, respectively.

Section: Results

To obtain snapshots of successive states of actively transcribing polymerase, we developed strategies to stall the polymerase after different amounts of template translocation ( Figures 1 A and 1B). Previously we used an extended 18+3-mer template, capped 15-mer primer, and 14-mer 5′ vRNA activating “hook,” together with ATP and GTP, to stall influenza B (FluB) polymerase, through lack of CTP, after the addition of only five nucleotides to the primer ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we used bat FluA polymerase with the same RNAs but added first ATP and GTP, and subsequently CTP together with a non-hydrolysable UTP analog, UpNHpp ( Figure 1 D). The template then translocates by 12 nt from the initiation state before stalling at the first adenine in the template sequence at position 15 from the native 3′ end of the template. At this point, the principle product is a capped 26-mer, as confirmed by next-generation sequencing of the transcription reaction products ( Figures 1 D and S6 ).
Cryo-EM analysis of this early elongation state confirms the biochemical characterization with the two major 3D classes clearly showing a template-product duplex with UpNHpp bound in a pre-catalytic configuration base-paired to A15 of the template at the +1 position ( Figures 1 B and S1 ; Table S1 ; Method S1 B). In one 3D class, at 3.02 Å resolution (PDB: 6T0V ), the cap-binding domain still associates with the polymerase core with the cap-proximal part of the primer bound to it. There is smeared density for the bulged-out part of the product mRNA connecting to the duplex. The second major 3D class is at 2.50 Å resolution (PDB: 6SZV ) ( Figure 1 B; Method S1 B), enabling ions, ribose hydroxyls, base substituents, and >210 water molecules to be resolved. In this structure, there is no density for the cap-binding domain, and only the part of the product in the product-template duplex within the active site cavity is visible. Comparison of this elongation state with the structure of the bat FluA pre-initiation state (PDB: 6T0N ) ( Figure 1 B; Method S1 A) shows that the initiation-elongation transition of bat FluA polymerase exhibits the same characteristic conformational changes as previously described for FluB polymerase ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), confirming that the mechanism is likely general for all influenza polymerases ( Figure S2 ). These changes include (1) complete extrusion of the priming loop and opening of the template exit channel, (2) promoter collapse involving ∼28° rotation of the PB1 β-ribbon, (3) refolding of PB1/667-681 and formation of a three-strand sheet with the β-ribbon ( Figure S2 A), (4) outward rotation of the PB1 thumb domain and associated PB2-N domains by ∼5°, (5) displacement of PB2/37-44 to allow duplex growth, and (6) duplex strand-separation by stacking of PB2 lid domain Tyr205 and PB1/Arg706 on the last duplex base pair ( Figure S2 B). The only difference with FluB polymerase is that in FluA, promoter collapse is correlated with a refolding and shift of the PA arch residues 372–385, bringing a cluster of acidic residues PA/D375, E377, and D378 into contact with PB1/K188 and R203 on the PB1 β-ribbon (all cited residues conserved in FluA) ( Figure S2 C). The FluA elongation structure allows visualization at high resolution of the pre-catalytic state with incoming non-hydrolysable UpNHpp with both magnesium ions, Mg(A) and Mg(B), configured for catalysis ( Figure S3 A). Compared to the inactive configuration ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ), Mg(A) shifts by ∼5 Å from the Mg(A′) position to coordinate the 3′ hydroxyl of the priming nucleotide and the α-phosphate of the incoming NTP, with concomitant rotamer changes of the motif A and C aspartates, but otherwise no major structural changes occur ( Figure S3 A, right). This structure, together with the high resolution post-catalytic state (see below, Figure S3 B), provides details that will be useful for drug development targeting the RNA synthesis active site but will not be described further here.
Compared to the previously described FluB early elongation state, in the FluA UpNHpp structure, the template has translocated an additional 7 nt beyond the end of the product-template duplex. Four of these are reasonably well-resolved in the cryo-EM map, thus revealing the template exit path ( Figures 2 A and 2B). The exiting template runs in a narrow channel between residues 680-697 of PB1 helix α20 on one side, and the base of the extruded priming loop (PB1/632-634) and the PB2-N1 domain (PB2/54-110) on the other side. The floor of the groove is formed by extended peptide PB1/671-674 with basic residues K669, R670, and R672 contributing to its electro-positivity. PB1/His633 stacks on U4, PB2/Arg88 is close to the phosphates of U4 and G3, and PB1/Arg687 is in proximity to the phosphates of C2 and U1. Prior to the transition to elongation, the exit groove does not exist ( Figures 2 A–2C). It is blocked first by the unextruded priming loop and second by the PB2/80-90 loop of the PB2-N1 domain, which is sandwiched between the PB1/Arg670-Glu686 salt-bridge and PB1/Arg687 ( Figures 2 B and 2C). Its opening requires the concerted rigid-body movement of the thumb and PB2-N1 domains that accompanies the transition to elongation as well as an additional outward movement of the tip of the PB2/80-90 loop. This correlates with a reconfiguration of the PB1/671-674 peptide with change of salt-bridge partner of Glu686 from Arg670 to Arg672 ( Figure 2 B).
To determine the subsequent path of the template and to give insight into the mechanism of polyadenylation, we determined cryo-EM structures after initiating mRNA synthesis with a single-chain 44-mer mini-vRNA template in which the native 3′ and 5′ ends are connected by a loop. The template either had a 6U poly-adenylation (poly(A)) signal starting at the natural position 17 nt from the 5′ end (v44-6U template), which is expected to promote poly(A) tail formation by stuttering, or the 6U sequence was replaced by UGUGUA (v44 template) to produce a defined, non-polyadenylated product ( Figure 1 A). The template sequences were chosen so that the first adenine occurred at position 16 (v44-6U) or 17 (v44) from the 5′ end. For the v44-6U template, addition of all NTPs produced, as expected, a smear of polyadenylated products ranging in apparent size from around 50–200 nt ( Figure 1 E). In the case of the v44 template, ATP, GTP, CTP, and non-hydrolysable UpNHpp were added with the expectation that transcription would stall with UpNHpp base pairing with A17 at the +1 position, resulting in a capped 37-mer as main product ( Figure 1 A). Addition of all NTPs should increase the product size to a 38-mer, resulting from incorporation of U opposite template position A17. In fact, the major products appear to migrate at a size of around 55–60 nt ( Figure 1 E). Loading and running of control RNAs or transcription products on denaturing PAGE at different temperatures ( Figure S4 B) clearly shows that the aberrant mobility is due to formation of a high-melting point product-template duplex ( Figure S4 C). To further confirm the identity of the capped transcription products, we performed, after decapping, next-generation sequencing of the main product bands of the 18+3-mer and two v44 template transcription reactions ( Figures 1 D, 1E, boxed, and S6 ; Table S3 ). We find that of the reads that start with the primer sequence, around 60% end at the expected position with a minority of these exhibiting primer realignment resulting in one or two repeats of the AGC at the primer 3′ end ( Figure S6 D). The isolated band from the v44 reactions also contains approximately 1:1 ratios of the template RNA ( Table S3 ) supporting that it is hybridized to the product in the gel. The combined evidence of the PAGE migration analysis, next-generation sequencing and the sequence register deduced from the cryo-EM density ( Figures S6 A–S6C), thus unambiguously identify the observed transcription products. Interestingly, an apparent larger size product was previously observed for related viral transcription/replication systems ( Pyle and Whelan, 2019; Vogel et al., 2019 39. Pyle, J.D. ∙ Whelan, S.P.J. RNA ligands activate the Machupo virus polymerase and guide promoter usage Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2019; 116 :10518-10524 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar 47.

Chem. 2019; 294 :8088-8100 Crossref Scopus (30) PubMed Google Scholar ) and our observations now provide a plausible explanation of this phenomenon.
The sample with the v44 template reacted with ATP, GTP, CTP, and non-hydrolysable UpNHpp produced a major 3D class at 2.41 Å resolution, denoted “pre-termination” state (PDB: 6SZU ) ( Figure S1 ; Table S1 ; Methods S1 C). This is a pre-translocation product complex with U18 at the +1 position base-pairing with A37 incorporated into the capped 37-mer product, together with pyrophosphate ( Figures 1 A, 1B, S3 B, S5 , and S6 A; Video S1 , part 1). However, we expected to observe UpNHpp opposite template A17 at the +1 position. This suggests that placing A17 in the +1 position is unfavorable, probably due to strain in the connection to the firmly bound 5′ hook, but it can occur transiently, because when UTP is used instead of UpNHpp, an extra base is incorporated to form the capped 38-mer product (see above, Figures 1 E, S4 A, and S4B). Indeed, cryo-EM analysis of the v44 template incubated with all NTPs, visualized at 2.70 Å resolution, unambiguously shows U38 of the product at the +1 position opposite A17 in a complex we denote “termination” state (PDB: 6TW1 ) ( Figure S6 B; Methods S1 D). These observations are discussed below in the context of the mechanism of polyadenylation.

Conformational Dynamics of Influenza during Transcription, Related to Figures 1–7 The pre-termination structure (part 1). Conformational transitions between the pre-initiation, elongation, pre-termination and product-dissociation states (part 2).
In the pre-termination state structure, there is excellent density for almost the entire 44-mer template RNA, allowing unambiguous assignment of the complete sequence ( Figures S5 and S6 A). Furthermore, the catalytic metal ions Mg(A) and Mg(B) are clearly visible ( Figures S3 B and S5 C) as well as ∼275 ordered water molecules, mainly hydrating the protein-RNA interface ( Figure S5 D). The pre-termination state corresponds to translocation of the template by 24 nt (i.e., capped 13-mer primer extended to a 37-mer), with the template 3′ end 27 nt from the +1 active site position. The important new features of this structure are, first, the well-ordered direct connection of the template from the 5′ hook to the active site, and second, the outgoing template is observed to progress along the exit channel and bend around the PB2-N1 domain, with the five 3′ terminal nucleotides binding into a partially buried groove between the PB1 thumb and PA-C domains, which we call the “secondary 3′ end binding site.”
In the v44 pre-termination state, the template makes an almost direct connection between the 5′ hook and the active site rather than the sinuous route taken by the 3′ end of the promoter at the start of transcription ( Figure 3 A). The connector RNA has an irregular but highly ordered conformation that is stabilized by several highly conserved arginines, which both stack on bases and interact with phosphates ( Figures 3 B and S5 B). The bases of A13 and C15 stack together and are sandwiched between PB1/Q186 and PB1/R203 of the collapsed β-ribbon on the A13 side and PB1/R353 on the C15 side. PB1/R353 also interacts with the phosphate of C15. The base of A16 stacks on the other side of PB1/R353 and also partially on the backbone of PB1/G33 as well as hydrogen bonding with PA/N508. The base of G14 is bulged out into a distinct pocket, stacking between the aliphatic part of PA/R507 and PB2/R38 and with the N7 hydrogen bonding to the main-chain of PB1/L675. PA/R507 also makes multivalent interactions with the phosphate of G14 and base and ribose of A11. PB1/R249 and R126 interact with the phosphates of A17 and U18, respectively, although the base of A17 is less well-ordered having no stacking interactions. The position of nt 1–14 from the 5′ end are the same as in the elongation structure, and similarly for nt 16–18. However, in the elongation structure, the 5′ end hook and the incoming template are not connected (mimicking the indirect linkage by a long loop of RNA for a physiological vRNA template), and in this case, the two segments of RNA are kept apart by a different position of the side chain of PB1/R353 ( Figure 3 C). In the termination state, base A17 moves into the +1 position, maximally straightening the connection to the 5′ hook ( Figure 3 D). C15 pushes PB1/R353 to a position similar to the elongation state and A16 relocates to pre-termination position of A17.
In the pre-termination and termination states, the outgoing template is guided along a positively charged groove around the PB2-N1 domain and into a partially buried extended pocket between the PA-C and PB1 thumb domains where the 3′ extremity binds in a sequence-specific manner ( Figure 4 ). For longer templates, this implies that as transcription proceeds, the emerging template would have to bulge away from the protein while the 3′ extremity remains tightly bound in the secondary binding site. Indeed, in the termination state, there is no clear density for the nucleotides along the exit channel, probably due to disorder resulting from the extra base translocation of the template.
Comparison of the UpNHpp elongation and pre-termination structures shows that in the first section of the exit groove, bounded by the extruded priming loop, PB2-N1 domain, and PB1 helix α20, different sequences and conformations of RNA can be accommodated as expected for a non-specific translocation channel ( Figure 2 B). The trajectory of the template follows the positively charged electrostatic surface of the groove that naturally guides the 3′ extremity into the secondary binding site ( Figure 4 A). In this site, identical for both pre- and termination states, there are numerous interactions of PB1/553-571, PA/302, 351-352, 459-491, 577, and PB2/53-54 with the backbone and bases of the 5 terminal nucleotides (3′-UCGUC) ( Figure 4 B). For example, the phosphates of nt 1–4 are contacted, respectively, by PB1/K553, PA/K483 and Y459, PB1/Y557 and R560, and PB1/Arg571 ( Figure 4 B). Aromatics PB1/Y557, PA/F352, and PA/Y459 each undergo induced fit rotamer flips upon RNA binding with PB1/Y557 and PA/F352 stacking on bases 2 and 3 ( Figure 4 C). Base-specific interactions are made, for example, by PA/R577 and T462 to C2 and PA/Q476 to U4. Most of the 3′ end interacting residues are absolutely conserved among all FluA strains (except bat FluA-specific PA/F352), and many residues are functionally conserved in other influenza types ( Figure 4 D). Using fluorescence polarization to measure binding of labeled RNA 6-mers to bat FluA polymerase, we showed first that the wild-type 3′-UCGUCU sequence has a K d of ∼20 nM whereas swapping purines for pyrimidines in the first four positions (3′-AGCACU) or an A 6 sequence had ∼100-fold less affinity ( Figures 4 E and S7 A). To confirm the site of binding and the importance of various interacting residues, we showed that single mutations of key residues PA/K483, PB1/K553 and R560, and PB2/K54 reduced binding by 15- to 100-fold and double and triple mutants by 200-fold ( Figure S7 B), with no effect of the mutations on protein integrity as judged by the intrinsic RNA synthesis activity of the polymerase ( Figure S7 C) ( Reich et al., 2017 41. Reich, S. ∙ Guilligay, D. ∙ Cusack, S. An in vitro fluorescence based study of initiation of RNA synthesis by influenza B polymerase Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :3353-3368 PubMed Google Scholar ). By cryo-EM, we confirmed that the site and mode of binding is conserved in FluB polymerase (PDB: 6T0W ) ( Figure S7 E; Table S1 ; Methods S1 G). Importantly, our high resolution maps show unambiguous density for vRNA 3′ end nt 1–5 bound specifically in the secondary binding site ( Figure 4 F). In contrast, in a lower resolution structure of influenza D polymerase ( Peng et al., 2019 32. Peng, Q. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Peng, R. ... Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), vRNA nucleotides positions 2–6 were assigned to the binding site, even though in the corresponding map there is no density for the implied overhanging first nucleotide and the last visible ribose is orientated such that no prolongation is possible (as in the Bat FluA structure). Interestingly, other recent cryo-EM structures for influenza D ( Peng et al., 2019 32. Peng, Q. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Peng, R. ... Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), FluB, and A/H3N2 ( Fan et al., 2019 8. Fan, H. ∙ Walker, A.P. ∙ Carrique, L. ... Structures of influenza A virus RNA polymerase offer insight into viral genome replication Nature. 2019; 573 :287-290 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ) polymerases, show that the cRNA 3′ end can also bind in this site. In all these cRNA bound structures, the secondary binding site nucleotides are assigned to positions 4–8 of the cRNA. However, we have high resolution cryo-EM maps showing unambiguous binding of cRNA nt 1–5, 3′-UCAUC, in the secondary binding site of bat A polymerase (unpublished data). In summary, our structural and biochemical results are consistent with the secondary binding site being specific for the conserved 3′ extremity of vRNA and cRNA for all influenza strains with consensus sequence 3′-U 1 C 2 A/G 3 U 4 C 5 (exceptionally FluD has an adenine at position 5 from the vRNA 3′ end) ( Figure S7 D). Finally, we note that the influenza polymerase secondary 3′ end binding site corresponds precisely to that observed for 3′ end vRNA binding to La Crosse bunyavirus (LACV) polymerase ( Gerlach et al., 2015 9. Gerlach, P. ∙ Malet, H. ∙ Cusack, S. ... Structural Insights into Bunyavirus Replication and Its Regulation by the vRNA Promoter Cell. 2015; 161 :1267-1279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Figure S7 F, left). For LACV, the binding is also both sequence-specific and with the extreme 3′ end ribose bound to preclude continuation. As discussed below, the sequestration of the 3′ end during active transcription now provides a rationale for the existence of this site.
A sample of the v44-6U template incubated with all NTPs was analyzed by cryo-EM. In this poly-adenylating sample, one of the 3D classes, at 3.04 Å resolution (PDB: 6T0S ) ( Table S1 ; Methods S1 E) resembles the v44 template termination state, but, according to the base assignment in the duplex ( Figure S6 C), the polymerase has stalled after transcription of the U17-U22 polyadenylation signal, but prior to poly(A)-tail elongation ( Figures 1 A, 1B, 5A, and 5 B). The register of the product strand is the same as in the termination state but the template strand is distorted and the connection between 5′ end nt 13 and 17 is not visible. We refer to this as the “stuttering” state. There is weak density for A38 incorporated into the product at the +1 position. However, the U17-A38 base pair is not formed. Instead, template base U17 is at the +2 position and U18 is at the +1 site forming a tilted base pair with A37 of the product ( Figure 5 B). Indeed, the proximal part of the template-product duplex is stretched and tilted compared to that in the v44 termination state, before regaining the same geometry at the top of the duplex ( Figures 5 A and 5B). As in the termination state, the template in the exit channel is poorly ordered, whereas its extreme 3′ end is clearly bound in the secondary 3′ end binding site. We interpret the v44-6U stuttering structure as partially translocated. The distortion in the duplex backbone structure during translocation is accompanied by a concerted longitudinal shift in PB1 helix α8 276–292 and the preceding turn (PB1/271-275) as well as PB1/124-128, both of which abut the template backbone ( Figure 5 C). Moreover, Mg(A) is observed in the shifted position, Mg(A′), coordinated by PB1/D446 and E491 ( Figure 5 B). Based on these structures, a model for the mechanism of polyadenylation is proposed in the discussion ( Figure 5 D).
The v44 pre-termination and v44-6U samples each have a second 3D class of interest at, respectively, 3.12 (PDB: 6T0U ) and 2.82 Å (PDB: 6T0R ) resolution ( Table S1 ; Methods S1 C and S1E). A very similar class is also observed for the v44 termination state (data not shown). All these structures clearly show the 5′ proximal part of the template entering the active site (e.g., up to U17 in the v44-6U case) and the extreme 3′ end of the template bound in the secondary binding site as in the termination and stuttering structures, but lack density for the product-template duplex in the active site cavity ( Figures 6 A and 6B). We interpret this as the “product-dissociation” state in which the three-stranded beta-sheet together with the clamped down β-ribbon remains formed, the priming loop is fully extruded, and the template stays threaded through the active site cavity, but the product mRNA has dissociated ( Figures 1 A, 1B, and 6 A). Due to the lack of a well-defined duplex imposing an ordered structure, there is only low resolution density for the template passing through the active site cavity and exit channel, but that in the secondary binding site is unambiguous ( Figure 6 B).
A major difference between the product-dissociation state and the preceding elongation and termination states (which are globally similar) is a further rotation by ∼6°, but about a different axis, of the entire thumb domain (PB1/520-669) and rigidly associated regions of PA-C and PB2-N (PB2/43-250), while preserving template binding through the exit channel into the secondary 3′ end site ( Figure 6 C). This we call the “dislocated” state of the polymerase, which is characterized by refolding of the PB1/500-513 peptide immediately after conserved polymerase motif E at the start of the thumb domain ( Figures 6 C and S8 A–S8C). This peptide (500-GFVANFSMELPSFG-513) is highly conserved in all influenza polymerases ( Figure S8 B). In the dislocated state, a characteristic third beta-strand is formed by PB1/501-503 with the preceding motif E hairpin loop ( Figures 6 C and S8 C). Furthermore, the new position of PB1/S506-M507-E508 would clash with the product strand in the duplex ( Figure 6 C) and PB1/R126 and the PB1/521-536 helix α16 with the template strand, emphasizing that this state is unable to bind a duplex. The two major transitions that occur during transcription, from (pre-) initiation to elongation and from termination to product dissociation (i.e., dislocation), are complex, having distinct local and more global components, as shown in Figure S8 D and Video S1 (part 2).
Interestingly, we and others have observed the dislocated state of the polymerase together with the vRNA template 3′ end bound in the secondary binding site in situations where the polymerase has never been actively transcribing. When either bat FluA or FluB resting polymerase-promoter complexes (i.e., in the absence of NTPs), with or without capped primer, are examined by cryo-EM, in addition to majority 3D classes corresponding to the un-dislocated, promoter-bound, pre-initiation state, there is always a small fraction of particles in the dislocated state, with the 3′ end of the template bound in the secondary binding site (PDB: 6T2C ) ( Figures 6 D and 6E; Table S1 ; Methods S1 F). In these open and flexible structures, there is disorder in the C-terminal region of PB1 beyond 670 and the N-terminal region of PB2 up to residue 40 with the PB1-PB2 interface and endonuclease not being visible (this is also the case in recent A/H3N2 polymerase cryo-EM structures, e.g., PDB: 6QWL , 6QX3 , and 6QX8 ) ( Fan et al., 2019 8. Fan, H. ∙ Walker, A.P. ∙ Carrique, L. ... Structures of influenza A virus RNA polymerase offer insight into viral genome replication Nature. 2019; 573 :287-290 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, whereas the 5′ end side of the promoter duplex is reasonably well-defined, the 3′ end side is less so, and the connection to the secondary site is also poorly ordered. An exception is the recent FluD polymerase structure (PDB: 6KUR ), which is also dislocated ( Figure S8 C), but where the connection between the template extremity bound in the secondary site to the promoter duplex region is clearly seen ( Figure S7 F, right). The authors refer to this promoter configuration as mode B, distinct from mode A, when the 3′ end is in the active site as in the pre-initiation state ( Peng et al., 2019 32. Peng, Q. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Peng, R. ... Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ). The RNA bound LACV structure ( Gerlach et al., 2015 9. Gerlach, P. ∙ Malet, H. ∙ Cusack, S. ... Structural Insights into Bunyavirus Replication and Its Regulation by the vRNA Promoter Cell. 2015; 161 :1267-1279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) also exhibits mode B promoter binding ( Figure S7 F, left). Recent cryo-EM structures of dimeric (PDB: 6QX8 ) and monomeric (PDB: 6QX3 ) A/H3N2 polymerase, with or without bound cRNA promoter, are also in the dislocated state ( Figure S8 C). When polymerase is bound to the cRNA promoter, mode B exclusively predominates over mode A ( Fan et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019 8. Fan, H. ∙ Walker, A.P. ∙ Carrique, L. ... Structures of influenza A virus RNA polymerase offer insight into viral genome replication Nature. 2019; 573 :287-290 Crossref Scopus (134) PubMed Google Scholar 32. Peng, Q. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Peng, R. ... Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), probably because of the two nucleotide longer single-stranded region of the cRNA 3′ end, whereas for vRNA binding, the majority are in mode A ( Peng et al., 2019 32. Peng, Q. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Peng, R. ... Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), as also observed for bat influenza polymerase.
We interpret the dislocated, mode B promoter bound, vRNA structure as a critical recycling intermediate between the product disassociation state (also dislocated and highly flexible) and the mode A pre-initiation state in which the promoter is stably reformed (see Discussion ).

Section: Discussion

Polyadenylation of influenza mRNAs occurs by “stuttering” at the 5′ proximal oligo(U) motif ( Li and Palese, 1994; Poon et al., 1999 21. Li, X. ∙ Palese, P. Characterization of the polyadenylation signal of influenza virus RNA J. Virol. 1994; 68 :1245-1249 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 38. Poon, L.L. ∙ Pritlove, D.C. ∙ Fodor, E. ... Direct evidence that the poly(A) tail of influenza A virus mRNA is synthesized by reiterative copying of a U track in the virion RNA template J. Virol. 1999; 73 :3473-3476 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ) and the pre-termination, termination, and stuttering structures described above allow us to propose a mechanism for exactly how this takes place, consistent with the known biochemistry ( Figure 5 D).
The polyadenylation signal comprises a track of five or six, exceptionally seven, uridines always starting at position 17 from the 5′ end of the vRNA template. The exact position from the 5′ end is critical, because displacement of the oligo(U) tract forward by only one position dramatically decreases polyadenylation levels ( Li and Palese, 1994; Poon et al., 1999 21. Li, X. ∙ Palese, P. Characterization of the polyadenylation signal of influenza virus RNA J. Virol. 1994; 68 :1245-1249 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar 38. Poon, L.L. ∙ Pritlove, D.C. ∙ Fodor, E. ... Direct evidence that the poly(A) tail of influenza A virus mRNA is synthesized by reiterative copying of a U track in the virion RNA template J. Virol. 1999; 73 :3473-3476 Crossref PubMed Google Scholar ). This we confirmed by using a v45-6U template, in which C17 was inserted so that the oligo(U) motif starts at position 18, in which case polyadenylation is eliminated ( Figures S4 D–S4F). The v44 pre-termination state structure reveals the path of the template RNA from the tightly bound 5′ hook structure (A1–A10), via the sandwiched dinucleotide A11-G12 to the irregular but highly ordered 13–17 linker, allowing U18 to enter the +1 position in the active site ( Figure 3 C). This structure also shows that even in the presence of a non-hydrolysable NTP complementary to nucleotide 17, the corresponding pre-catalytic base pair is not observed at the +1 position ( Figure 5 D, 1). This suggests that it is unfavorable for the template nucleotide at position 17 to enter the +1 position, because this requires disruption of the network of interactions that maintain the conformation of nt 13–16, in particular, PB1/R353 intercalating between A16 and C15 ( Figures 3 B and 3C). However, consistent with the observation that incorporation does occur at position 17 of the v44 template ( Figure 1 E), and a uridine at position 17 is essential for polyadenylation ( Figures S4 D and S4F), the termination structure shows that the position 17 base is able to dock into the +1 position despite the necessary stretching of nt 13–16 ( Figure 3 D). However, only if an incoming NTP can base pair with it, immediately proceeding to catalysis with incorporation into the product, is the energy cost compensated ( Figure 5 D, 2 and 3). Importantly, we could only trap the termination structure because the v44 template sequence results in a strong, G-C rich template-product duplex, which compensates for the maximal stretching of the linker to the 5′ hook. In contrast, in the true polyadenylation situation, with the v44-6U template, there is a considerably weaker, A-U rich duplex, and after incorporation of the adenine opposite U17, the tension in the stretched template causes template backtracking. U17 is pulled out of the active site and U18 moves back into the +1 position, tilting its base pair with the adenine in the −1 position as well as the U:A base pairs involving U19-21 higher up the duplex ( Figure 5 D, 4). At this stage, the template-product duplex is shortened to nine base pairs and contains five, tilted A-U base pairs. The unpaired +1A product nucleotide stacks on PB1 motif B M410 but has yet to be translocated. This state corresponds to the partially translocated v44-6U “stuttering” structure that we observe ( Figure 5 B). The overall weakening of the duplex, together with the backward pull on the template and forward force on the product, promotes inter-strand slippage and product translocation by one base, leaving the +1 position on the product site vacant ( Figure 5 D, 5). The previously described conformational change in the motif B loop ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) may assist this step. The next incoming ATP can then engage with U17, which is flipped transiently back into the active site for another round of incorporation into the growing poly(A) tail ( Figure 5 C, 6 and 7). Initial product slippage, however, introduces three mismatches in the upper half of the duplex ( Figure 5 C, 5–7), reducing significantly the number of regular base pairs. This facilitates template-product slippage in the next rounds of ATP incorporation but also increases the probability of product dissociation. Furthermore, as observed, if the oligo(U) tract is six nucleotides long, polyadenylation is more efficient, because there will be fewer mismatches in the duplex, favoring slippage and disfavoring product release.
In summary, we propose a mechanism of stuttering and slippage in which U17 flips in and out of the active site +1 position, with the template in the active site cavity alternating between 9 and 10 nt in length between every ATP incorporation round without any net translocation. Thus, in contrast to regular translocation during elongation, at polyadenylation, only the product translocates out of the active site chamber.
Based on our extensive, high resolution structural data showing successive snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase, we propose a comprehensive and coherent model for the full transcription cycle of influenza polymerase ( Figure 7 ; Video S2 ). The model provides a strong rationale for the existence of the secondary 3′ end binding site, first observed in LACV polymerase ( Gerlach et al., 2015 9. Gerlach, P. ∙ Malet, H. ∙ Cusack, S. ... Structural Insights into Bunyavirus Replication and Its Regulation by the vRNA Promoter Cell. 2015; 161 :1267-1279 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (139) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently for influenza polymerase ( Fan et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019 8.

Simplified Animation of the Complete Transcription Cycle of Influenza Polymerase, Related to Figure 7
The initiation and transition to elongation steps have been described previously ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) for FluB and confirmed here for FluA ( Figure S2 ). The key elements are the growth of the template-product duplex, which correlates with disruption of the promoter, clamping down of the β-ribbon, opening of the PB1 thumb domain, unblocking of the template exit channel via extrusion of the priming loop and strand separation by the PB2 lid domain ( Figures 7 A–7C). Further elongation drives the template along a positively charged groove and after translocation of ∼24 nt, the leading extremity of the template docks into the 3′ end secondary binding site in a sequence-dependent manner ( Figure 7 D). The template 3′ end is sequestered by the polymerase during all subsequent steps of transcription, protecting it from degradation by cellular exonucleases. Thereafter, the exiting template is forced to bulge out in a loop that increases in size as transcription proceeds to termination ( Figure 7 E). Correspondingly, the incoming template loop between the bound 5′ hook and the active site decreases in size until nucleotide 18 is at the +1 position and further translocation cannot occur without introducing strain in the linkage to the 5′ hook ( Figure 7 F). Poly(A) tail synthesis then occurs as described above ( Figure 5 D). The exact determinants of poly(A) length and the potential involvement of host-factors in polyadenylation remain unclear ( Landeras-Bueno et al., 2011 17. Landeras-Bueno, S. ∙ Jorba, N. ∙ Pérez-Cidoncha, M. ... The splicing factor proline-glutamine rich (SFPQ/PSF) is involved in influenza virus transcription PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7 :e1002397 Crossref Scopus (69) PubMed Google Scholar ). At some point, the relatively weak, U-A rich, and mismatched product-template duplex dissociates, and the capped and polyadenylated viral mRNA is released. Duplex destabilization and product-dissociation is likely facilitated by coupling to a conformational switch of the polymerase into the dislocated state. This state is incompatible with duplex binding due to the reconfiguration of the post-motif E peptide and repositioning of PB1/521-536 helix such that they would clash with the product and template strands, respectively ( Figure 7 G).
In the product-dissociation state, the 5′ proximal part of the template forms a loop that is trapped inside a tunnel formed by the active site cavity and exit channel. The tunnel walls comprise the priming loop and PB2-N1 domain on one side and PB1/680-700 and PB2/26-37 on the other side, both of which are connected to the PB2-Nter/PB1-Cter helical bundle that packs against the 170-loop of the PB2 helical lid domain, burying the template ( Figures 7 G and S8 E). The template cannot be extracted without a dramatic conformational change of the polymerase. One way this may occur is for the PB2-Nter/PB1-Cter helical bundle to peel away, opening the tunnel and allowing the template loop to be released ( Figure 7 H). Indication that this is feasible comes from a crystal structure of dimeric A/H7N9 polymerase core ( Table S2 ) (PDB: 6TU5 ) in which the PB2-Nter/PB1-Cter helical bundle has rotated down as envisaged ( Figure S8 F). This would need to be followed by the PB2-Nter/PB1-Cter helical bundle threading back through the template loop in a “skipping rope” fashion. The polymerase could then reconfigure into the still dislocated “recycling” state, with the 3′ and 5′ ends remaining bound in their respective sites, corresponding to mode B promoter binding, but with the observed weak promoter duplex ( Figure 7 I). Finally, the polymerase can switch back into the preferred pre-initiation state with mode A promoter binding. This is probably driven by polymerase closure (i.e., reversing the dislocation) and robust promoter duplex formation resulting in release of the 3′ end from its secondary binding site. In the case of cRNA, which binds preferentially in mode B ( Peng et al., 2019 32. Peng, Q. ∙ Liu, Y. ∙ Peng, R. ... Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ), dimer formation may be required to release the 3′ end from the secondary binding site to facilitate cRNA to vRNA replication ( Fan et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019 8. Fan, H. ∙ Walker, A.P. ∙ Carrique, L. ...

Structural insight into RNA synthesis by influenza D polymerase Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4 :1750-1759 Crossref Scopus (53) PubMed Google Scholar ).
In the viral RNP, the vRNA genome is pseudo-circularized by promoter binding to the viral polymerase with the rest of the RNA forming a supercoiled helical loop coated by NP ( Arranz et al., 2012 2. Arranz, R. ∙ Coloma, R. ∙ Chichón, F.J. ... The structure of native influenza virion ribonucleoproteins Science. 2012; 338 :1634-1637 Crossref Scopus (245) PubMed Google Scholar ). Influenza NP is believed to bind to 24–26 nt RNA ( Hutchinson et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2000 12. Hutchinson, E.C. ∙ Charles, P.D. ∙ Hester, S.S. ... Conserved and host-specific features of influenza virion architecture Nat. Commun. 2014; 5 :4816 Crossref Scopus (200) PubMed Google Scholar 31. Ortega, J. ∙ Martín-Benito, J. ∙ Zürcher, T. ... Ultrastructural and functional analyses of recombinant influenza virus ribonucleoproteins suggest dimerization of nucleoprotein during virus amplification J. Virol. 2000; 74 :156-163 Crossref Scopus (114) PubMed Google Scholar ), although recent studies show that the coating is not uniform and RNA stem-loops may extrude between the NPs ( Le Sage et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017 19. Le Sage, V. ∙ Nanni, A.V. ∙ Bhagwat, A.R. ... Non-Uniform and Non-Random Binding of Nucleoprotein to Influenza A and B Viral RNA Viruses. 2018; 10 :E522 Crossref Scopus (23) PubMed Google Scholar 20. Lee, N. ∙ Le Sage, V. ∙ Nanni, A.V. ... Genome-wide analysis of influenza viral RNA and nucleoprotein association Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :8968-8977 Crossref Scopus (64) PubMed Google Scholar ). During transcription, as the template is progressively translocated through the polymerase active site, the NPs must successively peel off as the pre-transcription template RNA loop shrinks. We have now established that the outgoing, transcribed template gradually bulges out on the other side of the polymerase, between the exit channel and the secondary 3′ end binding site, forming a correspondingly growing loop as transcription proceeds. It is therefore plausible that each successive RNA-stripped NP is transferred the short distance from the incoming to outgoing template strands where it can rebind to the growing loop of post-transcribed RNA ( Figures 7 J and 7K). This ensures that the transcribed RNA remains protected by bound NP, and no naked RNA is exposed to the nuclear environment. Interestingly, the amount of template RNA that is sequestered within the polymerase active site cavity, exit channel, and 3′ end binding site, before the outgoing template begins to bulge out and is able to be rebound by NP, is around 25 nt, the same amount of RNA that can bind to one NP. This suggests that there is a docking site for at least one RNA-free NP before it can rebind the outgoing template strand ( Figures 7 J and 7K). This NP would be held in place by transient interactions with the polymerase as well as daisy-chain like NP-NP interactions with its neighbors ( Ye et al., 2006 49. Ye, Q. ∙ Krug, R.M. ∙ Tao, Y.J. The mechanism by which influenza A virus nucleoprotein forms oligomers and binds RNA Nature. 2006; 444 :1078-1082 Crossref Scopus (369) PubMed Google Scholar ). The growing loop of NP-coated, post-transcribed vRNA will presumably acquire a similar structural topology as the original super-helical genome segment. Therefore, images of a transcribing vRNP will likely show only a perturbation at the position of the polymerase as it appears to move from one end to the other, as very recently reported ( Coloma et al., 2020 4. Coloma, R. ∙ Arranz, R. ∙ de la Rosa-Trevín, J.M. ... Structural insights into influenza A virus ribonucleoproteins reveal a processive helical track as transcription mechanism Nat. Microbiol. 2020; Crossref Scopus (35) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Finally, the conservation of the secondary 3′ end binding site in both influenza and La Crosse virus suggests that its role to sequester the template extremity during transcription is maintained in all segmented negative strand polymerases. Moreover, given that the cRNA and vRNA can both bind in the secondary 3′ site and the template exit pathway is likely independent of RNA synthesis mode, it is plausible that the model proposed here for the trajectory of the template is the same for replication and transcription.

Trichoplusia ni HighFive cells (Invitrogen) cultured in GIBCO Express Five TM SFM media supplemented with GIBCO L-glutamine were used for recombinant protein expression.
Mutations were introduced in influenza A/little yellow-shouldered bat/2010/H17N10 polymerase (bat FluA), including single mutants (PA/K134A, PA/K483E, PB1/K553E, PB1/Y557A, PB1/R560E and PB2/K54E), a double (PA/K483E + PB1/Y553E) and a triple mutant (PA/K483E + PB1/K553E + PB1/Y557A), by site-directed mutagenesis. Introduction of desired mutations was confirmed by sequencing of the entire polymerase gene.
The bat FluA polymerase self-cleaving polyprotein construct was expressed and purified as previously described ( Nie et al., 2014; Pflug et al., 2014 30. Nie, Y. ∙ Bellon-Echeverria, I. ∙ Trowitzsch, S. ... Multiprotein complex production in insect cells by using polyproteins Methods Mol.

Structure of influenza A polymerase bound to the viral RNA promoter Nature. 2014; 516 :355-360 Crossref Scopus (382) PubMed Google Scholar ) unless stated otherwise. Briefly, wild-type and mutant polymerase were expressed in HighFive insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Cells were collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche, complete mini, EDTA-free) and disrupted by sonication followed by centrifugation (35 000 rpm, 35 min, 4°C) to yield cleared supernatant. The latter was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (final concentration 0.5 g/mL) and the pellet was recovered by centrifugation (30 000 rpm, 30 min, 4°C, rotor 45Ti, Beckman Coulter). The pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer and subjected to a final centrifugation step (35 000 rpm, 35 min, 4°C). Cleared supernatant was incubated with nickel resin (His60 NiNTA, Clontech) and protein was eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 400 mM imidazole. The sample was diluted to decrease imidazole concentration to 250 mM and subjected to affinity chromatography on Strep-Tactin resin (Superflow, IBA). Protein was eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 2.5 mM d-desthiobiotin, diluted to 250 mM salt concentration and loaded on heparin column (HiTrap Heparin HP, 5 mL, GE Healthcare). Elution was performed with a 25% to 100% gradient of buffers A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP) and B (buffer A supplemented with 1 M NaCl). At this stage, monomeric and RNA-free wild-type polymerase fractions were pooled, concentrated (50 kDa cut-off, Amicon), flash-frozen and stored at −80°C ( Figure S2 D). In the case of mutant polymerases an additional step was introduced. Pooled fractions were concentrated and injected onto size exclusion column (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM TCEP). Monomeric and RNA-free polymerase fractions were pooled, concentrated (50 kDa cut-off, Amicon), flash-frozen and stored at −80°C.
PA, PB1 and PB2 of influenza A/Zhejiang/DTID-ZJU01/2013(H7N9) were expressed from synthetic codon-optimized reading frames (DNA2.0) corresponding to GenBank (Uniprot) entries AGJ51952.1 (M9TI86), AGJ51960.1 (M9TLW3) and KJ633805.1 (X5F427), respectively. A co-expression construct for the A/H7N9 core, was generated using the baculovirus expression vector pFastBacDual (Thermo Fisher) as follows. The complete PB1 protein coding sequence was inserted into the PolH-MCS using the restriction sites BamHI and RsrII. The sequence encoding residues 1-127 of PB2, supplemented with a C-terminal TEV-cleavable poly-histidine tag (GSGSENLYFQGSHHHHHHHH) was inserted into the P10-MCS using the restriction sites BbsI and XhoI. The sequence encoding for residues 201-716 of PA was cloned first into the vector pACEBac via the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI, then amplified from this construct including the PolH promoter and SV40 polyA signal and subcloned into the pFastBacDual_PB1_PB2 construct using a unique AvrII restriction site and SLIC cloning technology.
The core of A/H7N9 polymerase (PA 201-716, PB1 full-length, PB2 1-127) was produced in HighFive insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol), cell debris was spun off (30 min, 4°C, 35000 g) and ammonium sulfate added to the supernatant (final concentration 0.5 g/ml) to precipitate the protein. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (30 min, 4°C, 35000 g), re-suspended in buffer A and a cleared by centrifugation (30 min, 4°C, 35000 g) before subjecting it to immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). Elution fractions containing polymerase protein were pooled und subjected to a digestion with TEV protease (in buffer A supplemented with 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol). After dialyzing the digested protein sample back into buffer A it was passed through an IMAC column a second time. The sample was diluted to a salt concentration of 250 mM NaCl prior to loading it on a heparin column (HiPrep Heparin HP, GE Healthcare) pre-washed with buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 150 mM NaCl). The protein was eluted via a salt gradient plateauing at 1 M NaCl. Monodisperse and RNA-free polymerase was concentrated to about 9 mg/ml, flash-frozen and stored at −80°C.
A/H7N9 polymerase core crystallized within 4-5 days at 4°C in sitting drops in conditions of 0.1 M Tris pH 7.0, 8%–13% PEG 8K, 0.2 M MgCl 2 , 0.1 M guanidine hydrochloride with drop mixing ratios of 1:2 - 1:3 (protein:well) ( Table S2 ). Diffraction data were collected at 100° K on beamline ID30A3 (MASSIF 3) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and integrated and scaled with AUTOPROC with STARANISO ( Tickle et al., 2018 46. Tickle, I.J. ∙ Flensburg, C. ∙ Keller, P. ... STARANISO. Global Phasing Ltd. http://staraniso.globalphasing.org/cgi-bin/staraniso.cgi Date: 2018 Google Scholar ). Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using PHASER ( McCoy et al., 2007 25. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl. Cryst. 2007; 40 :658-674 Crossref Scopus (16083) PubMed Google Scholar ) with the bat FluA polymerase structure (PDB: 4WSB ). Structural adjustments were performed with COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 7. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ) and refinement done with Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al., 1997 28. Murshudov, G.N. ∙ Vagin, A.A. ∙ Dodson, E.J.

A potent endonuclease inhibitor, denoted ENDO483, was used as indicated below. ENDO483 is 5-Hydroxy-4-oxo-1-{[1-(1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-1-yl)cyclopentyl]methyl}-1,4-dihydro-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid ( Miyagawa et al., 2016 27. Miyagawa, M. ∙ Akiyama, T. ∙ Mikamiyama-Iwata, M. ... Discovery of novel 5-hydroxy-4-pyridone-3-carboxy acids as potent inhibitors of influenza Cap-dependent endonuclease Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2016; 26 :4739-4742 Crossref Scopus (14) PubMed Google Scholar ). The sample used was a gift from Savira pharmaceuticals.
To test the transcriptional activity of polymerase toward synthetic vRNA templates used in this study, an in vitro transcription assay based on incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides (α 32 P-ATP, Perkin Elmer) was performed. 0.8 μM bat FluA polymerase pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483, 0.8 μM template RNA v44, v44-6U or v45-6U, 2 μM capped RNA primer, 100 μM NTPs and 12 nM α 32 P-ATP were incubated in cryoEM buffer (see below) at 28°C for 10, 30 min and 2 h. Samples were separated by 7 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea-PAGE) in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer, exposed to a phosphor storage screen and imaged with a Typhoon scanner. Decade marker system (Ambion) was used as RNA ladder.
To test elongation stalling reaction conditions, 0.9 μM bat FluA polymerase pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483, 0.81 μM template 18+3-mer 3′ vRNA, 0.81 μM 14-mer 5′ vRNA, 1.8 μM capped RNA primer and 100 μM ATP, GTP (and CTP or CTP and UpNHpp) and 12 nM α-32P-ATP were incubated in cryoEM buffer at 28°C for 5 h. Additionally, CTP or CTP and UpNHpp were added for 2, 4 or 10 minutes. Samples were separated and visualized by the later procedure. Decade marker system (Ambion) and 20-mer, 23-mer and 28-mer RNAs, 2′-O-methylated at first ribose adjacent to the cap and radio-labeled at the 5′ end were used as markers.
To confirm the identity of transcription products and address the discrepancy between expected size and urea-PAGE migration, sequencing of the main product was performed. First in vitro transcription assay was performed by incubating 0.8 μM bat FluA polymerase pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483, 2 μM 13-mer capped primer, 0.8 μM template RNA v44 and 100 μM ATP, GTP, CTP and without or with UTP in cryoEM buffer for 3h at 28°C. Analogous reaction was set up with 0.8 μM bat FluA polymerase pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483, 2 μM 15-mer capped primer, 0.8 μM template 18+3-mer 3′ vRNA and 14-mer 5′ vRNA and 100 μM ATP, GTP and CTP for 3h at 28°C. After completion of the reaction, proteins were removed by Monarch® RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) and RNAs were then decapped using RNA 5′ pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH, NEB) and subjected again to the Monarch® RNA Cleanup Kit (NEB). Purified RNA were subjected to the urea-PAGE, stained with SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher) and RNA was extracted from the bands of interest (shown on Figures 1 D and 1E).
RNA integrity was checked using the RNA Pico 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and concentration was measured with Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in Qubit® 2.0 Fluorimeter (Life Technologies). Small RNA-Seq libraries were prepared manually from 2 ng of RNA as input using the SMARTer® smRNA-Seq kit for Illumina® Platforms (Takara Bio). Library preparation was done following the manufacturer’s instructions. The size distribution of the libraries was assessed on Bioanalyzer with a DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies), and concentration was measured with Qubit® DNA High Sensitivity kit in Qubit® 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies). Libraries that passed the QC step were pooled in equimolar amounts and final pool was purified with SPRI select beads (Beckman Coulter) in a 1.3x ratio. 8 pM solution of the pool of libraries was loaded on the Illumina sequencer MiSeq and sequenced uni-directionally, generating ∼18 million reads, each 150 bases long.
Base-calling files were processed using Illumina bcl2fastq version 2.20.422 (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Resulting fastq reads were trimmed using Cutadapt v 2.3 ( Martin, 2011 24. Martin, M. Cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads EMBnetjournal. 2011; 17 :10-12 Crossref Google Scholar ) with settings recommended by the library preparation kit (-u 3 -a ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAA’) omitting the filter for only reads longer than 25 bases. Trimmed reads were subsequently used as an input for pattern lookup performed by combination of NR-grep ( Navarro, 2001 29. Navarro, G. NR‐grep: a fast and flexible pattern-matching tool Softw. Pract. Exper. 2001; 31 :1265-1312 Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar ) and GNU grep ( https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html ). NR-grep allows for fuzzy search including substitutions, deletions and insertions. The list of search regular expression patterns and allowed substitutions are in Table S3 . After the filtering, reads were sorted and unique occurrences were counted.
To investigate migration and level of denaturation of dsRNA, 2 μM 38-mer RNA (RNA38) and equimolar amount of its reverse complementary sequence (RNA38-RC) were incubated separately and together in cryoEM buffer for 15 min at room temperature. 2xRNA loading buffer was added to all samples (95% formamide, 0.025% SDS, 0.025% bromophenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol FF, 0.5 mM EDTA) and samples were boiled at 95°C and analyzed by 7 M urea 20% polyacrylamide electrophoresis at three different temperatures. Three gels were loaded and run in parallel either on ice (∼4°C), at room temperature (∼25°C) or with hot buffer (∼95°C) to compare migration of RNA samples. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold stain (Thermo Fisher) and imaged after 15 minutes. Decade marker system (Thermo Fisher) and low range ssRNA ladder (NEB) were used as markers.
In order to test activity of newly produced polymerase mutants, an in vitro transcription assay based on fluorescence polarization (FP) and using short fluorescently labeled template vRNA was performed as previously described ( Reich et al., 2017 41. Reich, S. ∙ Guilligay, D. ∙ Cusack, S. An in vitro fluorescence based study of initiation of RNA synthesis by influenza B polymerase Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 :3353-3368 PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, 0.25 μM wild-type or mutant polymerase was prebound to 1.2x excess of 5′-vRNA (5′-pAGUAGUAACAAGAG-3′) and mixed with 1.5 μM capped RNA primer (5′-m 7 GpppAAUCUAUAAUAGC-3′), 0.3 μM FAM-labeled vRNA template (18-mer, 5′-FAM-Ex-5-UAUACCUCUGCUUCUGCU-3′) and 150 μM NTPs in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 0.05% Tween20) supplemented with 5 mM MgCl 2 . Samples were incubated at 25°C and reaction was quenched by 4.5 M NaCl after 1, 1.5, 4, 7, 16, 20, 31, 45 min, 1h 30, 2h 15, 3h 30, 5h 30, 19h 30, 21h 30. After reaching equilibrium, fluorescence polarization was measured with a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech) at 25°C using excitation and emission filters of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Progress curves were fitted into double exponential equation with bi-phasic reaction kinetics: 𝑓 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) = − 𝐴 · 𝑒 − 𝑘 1 ⁢ 𝑡 − 𝐵 · 𝑒 − 𝑘 2 ⁢ 𝑡 + 𝐶 where t is reaction time, A and B are observed signal amplitudes, k 1 and k 2 are observed rate constants for corresponding phases and C is final FP signal. Data were analyzed and fitted using GraphPad Prism.
Binding assays were performed with short fluorescently labeled wild-type (5′-UCUGCU-3′), mutant (5′-UCACGA-3′) and negative control (5′-AAAAAA-3′) RNA (IBA Lifesciences). Binding reactions were carried with 0.02 μM FAM-labeled RNA and increasing concentration of wild-type or mutant polymerase in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 0.05% Tween20). The binding reactions were set-up in 20 μL volume and incubated at room temperature for about 30 min. After reaching equilibrium, fluorescence polarization was measured with a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech) at 25°C using excitation and emission filters of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Recorded fluorescence polarization signal was corrected for changes in fluorescence intensity according to the equation: 𝑓 𝑏 = ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑃 − 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑒 ) ( 𝐼 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 𝐼 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑒 ) · ( 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑏 ⁢ 𝑜 ⁢ 𝑢 ⁢ 𝑛 ⁢ 𝑑 − 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑃 ) + 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑃 − 𝐹 ⁢ 𝑃 𝑓 ⁢ 𝑟 ⁢ 𝑒 ⁢ 𝑒 where f b represents the fractional concentration of bound RNA, FP the observed fluorescence polarization, FP free and FP bound the fluorescence polarization of free and bound RNA, and I free and I bound the fluorescence intensity of free and bound RNA, respectively. Dissociation constants (K D ) were obtained using GraphPad Prism software by fitting fluorescence polarization data as a function of total concentration of protein (P) using the following equation: 𝑓 𝑏 = ( 𝐿 + 𝑃 + 𝐾 𝐷 − √ ( 𝐿 + 𝑃 + 𝐾 𝐷 ) 2 − 4 ⁢ 𝐿 ⁢ 𝑃 ) 2 ⁢ 𝐿 where f b represents the fractional concentration of bound RNA, L the total concentration of labeled RNA, P the concentration of protein and K D the dissociation constant. For the competition assay, 0.04 μM wild-type polymerase was pre-bound with an equimolar quantity of FAM-labeled short RNA (5′-UCUGCU-3′) and increasing amounts of unlabeled RNA competitor were added. Data were recorded and fitted in the same manner as for direct binding experiments.
To capture distinct states of transcription cycle, state specific vRNA templates and sample preparation protocols (see below) were applied. Either wild-type polymerase with endonuclease inhibitor or an endonuclease-inactive polymerase (PA/K134A) were used to prevent possible endonuclease mediated vRNA template or product degradation. All complexes were assembled in cryoEM buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM TCEP). Sample 1: For the pre-initiation complex, equimolar amounts of bat FluA polymerase at 0.9 μM (prebound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor (ENDO-483)), 3′ vRNA (16-mer) and 5′ vRNA (14-mer) in cryoEM buffer were incubated on ice for 15 min. Sample 2: For the elongation complex, 0.9 μM bat FluA polymerase (pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483), 0.81 μM 3′ vRNA (18+3-mer) and 5′ vRNA (14-mer) and 1.8 μM 15-mer capped were mixed in cryoEM buffer and incubated for 5 hours at 28°C with 100 μM ATP and GTP. Additionally, 100 μM CTP and 300 μM UpNHpp were added for 2 minutes at 28°C and immediately cooled to 4°C. Sample 3 and 4: For the pre-termination and termination complexes, equimolar amounts of bat FluA polymerase at 0.85 μM (pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483) and the v44 template were mixed with 2.5 molar excess of 13-mer capped RNA primer, 100 μM ATP, CTP, GTP and 300 μM UpNHpp in cryoEM buffer and incubated at 28°C for 4 h. For the termination complex, 100 μM UTP instead of UpNHpp was used. Sample 5: For the stuttering complex, equimolar amounts of bat FluA PA/K134A polymerase at 0.7 μM and the template v44-6U (44-mer template RNA with 6xU polyadenylation signal) were mixed with 2.5 molar excess of 13-mer capped RNA primer, 170 μM ATP and 17 μM CTP, GTP and UTP in cryoEM buffer and incubated at 30°C for 1.5 h. Sample 6: For the recycling complex, equimolar amounts of bat FluA polymerase at 0.9 μM (pre-bound to 35 μM endonuclease inhibitor ENDO483) and template vRNA7L (34-mer) in cryoEM buffer were incubated on ice for 20 min. Sample 7: For the FluB recycling complex, wild-type human FluB polymerase at 1.2 μM was incubated with 1.25 molar excess of template vRNA7L (34-mer) and 12-mer capped RNA primer in cryoEM buffer.
Aliquots of 3 μl were applied to glow discharged grids (R1.2/1.3, Au 300, Quantifoil), blotted for 2 s and immediately plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using an FEI Vitrobot IV at 4°C and 100 % humidity. Grids were loaded onto 300 kV FEI Titan Krios or 200 kV FEI Talos Glacios electron microscopes and data were acquired in electron counting mode. Further details regarding each data collection are presented in Table S1 .
CryoEM data processing was performed according to previously published strategy ( Kouba et al., 2019 16. Kouba, T. ∙ Drncová, P. ∙ Cusack, S. Structural snapshots of actively transcribing influenza polymerase Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 :460-470 Crossref Scopus (67) PubMed Google Scholar ) and additional details regarding each dataset can be found in Table S1 and Methods S1 . Briefly, in order to limit radiation damage, only selected initial frames from the collected movies were aligned using MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al., 2017 51. Zheng, S.Q. ∙ Palovcak, E. ∙ Armache, J.P. ... MotionCor2: anisotropic correction of beam-induced motion for improved cryo-electron microscopy Nat. Methods. 2017; 14 :331-332 Crossref Scopus (4513) PubMed Google Scholar ) and then used for contrast transfer function parameter calculation by Gctf ( Zhang, 2016 50. Zhang, K. Gctf: Real-time CTF determination and correction J. Struct. Biol. 2016; 193 :1-12 Crossref Scopus (2386) PubMed Google Scholar ). Particle were picked using either WARP ( Tegunov and Cramer, 2019 45. Tegunov, D. ∙ Cramer, P. Real-time cryo-electron microscopy data preprocessing with Warp Nat. Methods. 2019; 16 :1146-1152 Crossref Scopus (576) PubMed Google Scholar ) or Gautomatch (by K. Zhang) and were next subjected to reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification using RELION 3.0 ( Scheres, 2012 43. Scheres, S.H. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 :519-530 Crossref Scopus (3642) PubMed Google Scholar ). After several rounds of 2D classifications on binned images, particles in classes with poor structural features were discarded. Classes containing good quality particles were subjected to 3D classification with alignment. Next, the classes representing similar conformational states were pooled together for global 3D auto-refinement and were subjected to another round of 3D classification with fine angular searches. This procedure was repeated until conformationally homogeneous classes were obtained. The resulting maps were improved by CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing procedures in RELION and further 3D auto-refined. The final cryoEM density maps were sharpened using post-processing procedure in RELION and the resolution was estimated using 0.143 gold standard Fourier Schell Correlation (FSC) cutoff. Local resolution maps were generated using RELION’s own implementation. Final maps were sharpened and blurred into MTZ format using CCP-EM ( Burnley et al., 2017 3. Burnley, T. ∙ Palmer, C.M. ∙ Winn, M. Recent developments in the CCP-EM software suite Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73 :469-477 Crossref Scopus (215) PubMed Google Scholar ) and local amplitude scaling was performed using LocScale ( Jakobi et al., 2017 13. Jakobi, A.J. ∙ Wilmanns, M. ∙ Sachse, C. Model-based local density sharpening of cryo-EM maps eLife. 2017; 6 :e27131 Crossref Scopus (143) PubMed Google Scholar ). The previously solved structures of bat influenza A polymerases (4WSB, but also models generated in this study) were rigid-body fitted into the EM densities using Molrep in CCP-EM and further model building of RNA and flexible domains was performed manually in COOT ( Emsley et al., 2010 7. Emsley, P. ∙ Lohkamp, B. ∙ Scott, W.G. ... Features and development of Coot Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :486-501 Crossref Scopus (20200) PubMed Google Scholar ). Real-space refinement was done in PHENIX ( Afonine et al., 2018 1. Afonine, P.V. ∙ Poon, B.K. ∙ Read, R.J. ... Real-space refinement in PHENIX for cryo-EM and crystallography Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2018; 74 :531-544 Crossref Scopus (1516) PubMed Google Scholar ). For the highest resolution structures, Ramachandran and side-chain restraints were not used. Structures were analyzed and figures were prepared using following software packages: PyMOL ( Schrödinger , Inc.) with APBS plugin ( Jurrus et al., 2018 15. Jurrus, E. ∙ Engel, D. ∙ Star, K. ... Improvements to the APBS biomolecular solvation software suite Protein Sci. 2018; 27 :112-128 Crossref Scopus (1239) PubMed Google Scholar ), USCF Chimera ( Pettersen et al., 2004 33. Pettersen, E.F. ∙ Goddard, T.D. ∙ Huang, C.C. ... UCSF Chimera--a visualization system for exploratory research and analysis J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25 :1605-1612 Crossref Scopus (33444) PubMed Google Scholar ), CCP4MG ( McNicholas et al., 2011 26. McNicholas, S. ∙ Potterton, E. ∙ Wilson, K.S. ...
