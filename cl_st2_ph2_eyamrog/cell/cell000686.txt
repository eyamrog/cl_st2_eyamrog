Title: Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 subvariants, including BA.4 and BA.5


Abstract: Summary

After the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2, some BA.2 subvariants, including BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5, emerged in multiple countries. Our statistical analysis showed that the effective reproduction numbers of these BA.2 subvariants are greater than that of the original BA.2. Neutralization experiments revealed that the immunity induced by BA.1/2 infections is less effective against BA.4/5. Cell culture experiments showed that BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 replicate more efficiently in human alveolar epithelial cells than BA.2, and particularly, BA.4/5 is more fusogenic than BA.2. We further provided the structure of the BA.4/5 spike receptor-binding domain that binds to human ACE2 and considered how the substitutions in the BA.4/5 spike play roles in ACE2 binding and immune evasion. Moreover, experiments using hamsters suggested that BA.4/5 is more pathogenic than BA.2. Our multiscale investigations suggest that the risk of BA.2 subvariants, particularly BA.4/5, to global health is greater than that of original BA.2.

Section: Introduction

Since the end of November 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 and BA lineages) has spread worldwide and has outcompeted prior SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), such as Delta. After the surge of the Omicron BA.1 variant, another Omicron variant, BA.2, outcompeted BA.1 and has become the most dominant variant in the world ( Ito et al., 2022 26. Ito, K. ∙ Piantham, C. ∙ Nishiura, H.

Thereafter, as of May 2022, the BA.2 subvariants that harbor the substitution at the L452 residue of the spike (S) protein, such as BA.4 and BA.5, were frequently detected ( Tegally et al., 2022 69. Tegally, H. ∙ Moir, M. ∙ Everatt, J. ... Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineages BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa Nat.

WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (May 18, 2022) https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants Date: 2022 Google Scholar ). These observations suggest that novel BA.2 subvariants bearing substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein are more transmissible than the original BA.2. These recent developments led the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider these BA.2 subvariants bearing substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein, BA.4, BA.5, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.9.1, and BA.2.11, as VOC lineages under monitoring (VOC-LUM) on May 18, 2022 ( WHO, 2022 81. WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (May 18, 2022) https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants Date: 2022 Google Scholar ).
Resistance to antiviral humoral immunity can be mainly determined by substitutions in the S protein. For instance, Omicron BA.1 ( Cao et al., 2021 9. Cao, Y. ∙ Wang, J. ∙ Jian, F. ...

In addition to immune evasion, substitutions in the S protein potentially modulate viral pathogenicity. In particular, the fusogenicity of the S protein in in vitro cell cultures is closely associated with viral pathogenicity in an experimental hamster model. For example, the Delta S protein is highly fusogenic in cell cultures and highly pathogenic in hamsters when compared with ancestral D614G-bearing B.1.1 S proteins ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ). In contrast, the Omicron BA.1 S protein is less fusogenic and pathogenic than the B.1.1 S protein ( Meng et al., 2022 47. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that the Omicron BA.2 S protein is more fusogenic and potentially confers the virus with higher pathogenicity than the Omicron BA.1 S protein ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ).
Newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants need to be carefully and rapidly assessed for a potential increase in their growth efficacy in the human population, their pathogenicity, and/or their evasion from antiviral immunity. The substitution at the L452 residue of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was detected in the Delta (L452R) and Lambda (L452Q) variants, which were previously classified as a VOC and a variant of interest (VOI), respectively ( WHO, 2022 81. WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (May 18, 2022) https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants Date: 2022 Google Scholar ). Importantly, we previously demonstrated that the L452R ( Motozono et al., 2021 49. Motozono, C. ∙ Toyoda, M. ∙ Zahradnik, J. ... SARS-CoV-2 spike L452R variant evades cellular immunity and increases infectivity Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29 1124.e11–1136.e11 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (322) PubMed Google Scholar ) and L452Q ( Kimura et al., 2022a 32. Kimura, I. ∙ Kosugi, Y. ∙ Wu, J. ... The SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant exhibits enhanced infectivity and immune resistance Cell Rep. 2022; 38 :110218 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (82) PubMed Google Scholar ) increase viral infectivity by promoting the binding of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We have recently characterized the virological features of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 ( Meng et al., 2022 47. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ) and BA.2 ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, the impact of the substitution of the L452 residue of the S protein on the virological characteristics of Omicron BA.2 remains unclear. Altogether, these observations suggest that novel BA.2 subvariants bearing substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein, particularly those classified as VOC-LUM, could pose a potential risk for global health, and we herein elucidate the virological characteristics of these novel BA.2 subvariants.

Section: Results

Omicron substantially diversified during the epidemic. In South Africa, where Omicron was first reported at the end of November 2021 ( NICD, 2021a, 2021b 50. NICD Latest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa (November 25, 2021) https://www.nicd.ac.za/latest-confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-in-south-africa-25-november-2021/ Date: 2021 Google Scholar 51. NICD New COVID-19 variant detected in South Africa (November 25, 2021) https://www.nicd.ac.za/new-covid-19-variant-detected-in-south-africa/ Date: 2021 Google Scholar ), a variety of Omicron sublineages (BA.1–BA.5) have emerged ( Figures 1 A and S1 A) ( Tegally et al., 2022 69. Tegally, H. ∙ Moir, M. ∙ Everatt, J. ... Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron lineages BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa Nat. Med. 2022; Published online June 27, 2022 Crossref Scopus (391) PubMed Google Scholar ). The Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants are closely related to each other and bear identical S proteins ( Figure 1 A). Because BA.4 and BA.5 form a monophyletic clade with BA.2 ( Figure 1 A), we herein refer to BA.4 and BA.5 as BA.2 subvariants. Compared with the BA.2 S protein, BA.4 and BA.5 S proteins harbor the L452R, HV69-70del, and F486V, as well as a revertant R493Q. Notably, in addition to the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages, several BA.2 subvariants that bear the substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein have also emerged ( Figures 1 B and S1 B; Table S1 ). In-depth tracing of the emergence of BA.2 subvariants bearing substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein detected seven common ancestry groups of the BA.2 variants bearing L452R, L452Q, or L452M in the S protein ( Figures 1 B, S1 C, and S1D; Table S2 ). As of May 15, 2022, the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) lineage ( https://cov-lineages.org ) annotates four out of the seven BA.2 subvariants bearing substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein: BA.2.9.1 (BA.2 S:L452M) in Denmark, BA.2.11 (BA.2 S:L452R) in France, BA.2.12.1 (BA.2 S:L452Q/S704L) in the USA, and BA.2.13 (BA.2 S:L452M) in Belgium ( Figures 1 B, 1C, and S1 C). However, the other three lineages were not annotated as of May 15, 2022 ( Figure 1 B). On May 18, 2022, the WHO classified these six L452R/M/Q-bearing BA.2 subvariants, BA.4, BA.5, BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, and BA.2.13, as VOC-LUM ( WHO, 2022 81. WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants (May 18, 2022) https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants Date: 2022 Google Scholar ). Most importantly, these BA.2 subvariants had higher effective reproduction numbers (R e ) than the original BA.2 subvariant ( Figure 1 D; Table S3 ). In particular, the R e values of BA.4 and BA.5 (in South Africa) and BA.2.12.1 (in the USA) are 1.19-, 1.21-, and 1.13-fold higher than that of BA.2, respectively ( Figure 1 D), and these three subvariants have begun outcompeting the original BA.2 in several countries ( Figures 1 E and S1 E). As of May 15, 2022, BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.12.1 have been detected in 20, 19, and 36 countries, respectively. Altogether, our data indicate that multiple subvariants bearing substitutions at the L452 residue of the S protein have independently emerged in several countries. From these data, at the time of writing the initial manuscript of this study in May 2022, we predicted that these BA.2 subvariants, particularly BA.4 and BA.5, would spread worldwide and become the next predominant variants in the near future. As of July 7, 2022, since BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.12.1 began circulating in the same countries (e.g., the USA), we directly compared the R e values in certain countries among these variants. The estimated R e values of BA.4, BA.5, and BA.2.12.1 in the USA were 1.28-, 1.36-, and 1.10-fold higher than that of BA.2, respectively, suggesting that BA.5 shows the highest R e value among the variants tested ( Figure S1 F; Table S3 ). As of July 2022, BA.5 has begun outcompeting the original BA.2 in multiple countries and will be the next predominant variant in the world in the near future.
We have recently demonstrated that BA.4/5 is more resistant to a therapeutic monoclonal antibody, cilgavimab, which is a component of Evusheld, than BA.2 ( Yamasoba et al., 2022c 87. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kosugi, Y. ∙ Kimura, I. ..., Genotype to Phenotype Japan (G2P-Japan) Consortium Neutralisation sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariants to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies Lancet Infect Dis. 2022; 22 :942-943 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (118) PubMed Google Scholar ). Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that BA.4 and BA.5 are relatively resistant to the antiviral humoral immunity induced by BA.1 infection ( Khan et al., 2022 30. Khan, K. ∙ Karim, F. ∙ Ganga, Y. ... Omicron sub-lineages BA.4/BA.5 escape BA.1 infection elicited neutralizing immunity 2022 Crossref Google Scholar ; Tuekprakhon et al., 2022 71.

To investigate the sensitivity of BA.2 subvariants to antiviral humoral immunity, we prepared pseudoviruses bearing the S proteins of these BA.2 subvariants, including BA.2.9.1/BA.2.13 (BA.2 S:L452M; we herein refer to it as BA.2.9.1), BA.2.11 (BA.2 S:L452R), BA.2.12.1 (BA.2 S:L452Q/S704L), and BA.4/5 (BA.2 S:L452R/HV69-70del/F486V/R493Q), as well as their derivatives and the original BA.2.

The sera from 16 individuals infected with BA.1 who were 2-dose vaccinated convalescents (i.e., BA.1 breakthrough infection; 10–27 days after testing) were obtained ( Table S4 ), and the sensitivity of BA.2.9.1 and BA.2.11 to these antisera was comparable to that of BA.2 ( Figure 2 C). On the other hand, consistent with recent studies ( Khan et al., 2022 30. Khan, K. ∙ Karim, F. ∙ Ganga, Y. ... Omicron sub-lineages BA.4/BA.5 escape BA.1 infection elicited neutralizing immunity 2022 Crossref Google Scholar ; Tuekprakhon et al., 2022 71.

In the case of the sera from 14 individuals infected with BA.2 who were 2-dose (9 individuals) or 3-dose (5 individuals) vaccinated convalescents (i.e., BA.2 breakthrough infection; 11–61 days after testing), BA.4/5 exhibited a significant (1.8-fold) resistance compared with BA.2 ( Figure 2 D; p = 0.0059 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In contrast to BA.1 breakthrough infection sera ( Figure 2 C), the S704L but not the F486V contributed to the resistance to BA.2 breakthrough infection sera ( Figure 2 D). Interestingly, the insertion of HV69-70del and R493Q made the pseudovirus more sensitive to both BA.1 ( Figure 2 C) and BA.2 ( Figure 2 D) breakthrough infection sera.
To assess the sensitivity of BA.2-related subvariants to vaccine-induced humoral immunity, we used vaccine sera collected from 15 individuals 1 month after the 2nd-dose vaccination ( Figure 2 E), 1 month after the 3rd-dose vaccination ( Figure 2 F), and 4 months after the 3rd-dose vaccination ( Figure 2 G). As recently reported ( Gruell et al., 2022 22. Gruell, H. ∙ Vanshylla, K. ∙ Korenkov, M. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sublineages exhibit distinct antibody escape patterns Cell Host Microbe. 2022; 30 1231.e6–1241.e6 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (46) Google Scholar ; Qu et al., 2022 57. Qu, P. ∙ Faraone, J. ∙ Evans, J.P. ... Neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.4/5 and BA.2.12.1 subvariants N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; 386 :2526-2528 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ), 2nd-dose vaccine sera did not work against all BA.2-related subvariants tested ( Figure 2 E). Although the sera after the 3rd-dose vaccinations were effective against BA.2-related subvariants, BA.4/5 exhibited 1.8- and 1.6-fold more resistance to vaccine sera 1 month after the 3rd-dose vaccination ( Figure 2 F; p = 0.0039 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and 4 months after the 3rd-dose vaccination ( Figure 2 G; p = 0.0039 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test), respectively. Similar to BA.2 breakthrough infection sera ( Figure 2 D), the S704L contributed to the resistance to 3rd-dose vaccine sera ( Figures 2 F and 2G). Moreover, similar to both BA.1 ( Figure 2 C) and BA.2 ( Figure 2 D) breakthrough infection sera, the HV69-70del and R493Q increased the sensitivity to 3rd-dose vaccine-induced antiviral sera ( Figures 2 F and 2G).
To further address the possibility of evasion of BA.2-related subvariants from the immunity induced by the infection of the original BA.2, we used the sera obtained from both BALB/c mice immunized with recombinant BA.2 S RBD ( Figure 2 H) and hamsters infected with BA.2 ( Figure 2 I) ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). BA.4/5 was 2.3-fold more resistant to BA.2 S RBD-immunized murine sera ( Figure 2 H; p < 0.0001 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and 3.8-fold more resistant to the BA.2-infected hamster sera collected at 16 days post infection (d.p.i.) ( Figure 2 I; p = 0.0009 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). In contrast to the results using human sera, the L452Q and R493Q contributed to the resistance to BA.2-induced rodent antisera ( Figures 2 H and 2I). Moreover, we used the sera collected from BA.2.12.1-infected ( Figure 2 J) and BA.4/5-infected ( Figure 2 K) hamsters at 16 d.p.i. Although the antiviral activity of BA.2.12.1-infected hamster sera against BA.2 was comparable to that against 2.12.1, BA.4/5 exhibited 3.6-fold higher resistance than BA.2.12.1 ( Figure 2 J; p = 0.031 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Moreover, BA.2 was 10.9-fold more resistant to the BA.4/5-infected hamster sera than BA.4/5 ( Figure 2 K; p = 0.031 by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Altogether, these results suggest that BA.4/5 is resistant to the immunity induced by BA.1 and BA.2, and that the antigenicity of BA.4/5 is different from that of BA.2 and BA.2.12.1.
To investigate the virological characteristics of the L452R/Q/M-bearing BA.2 subvariants, we measured pseudovirus infectivity using HOS cells expressing ACE2 and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) ( Kimura et al., 2022a 32.

As shown in Figure 3 A, all BA.2 subvariants tested exhibited significantly higher infectivity than BA.2. The pseudovirus infectivity of BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, and BA.2.12.1 was comparable to that of ancestral D614G-bearing B.1.1 and, notably, the infectivity of the BA.4/5 pseudovirus was 18.3-fold higher than that of the BA.2 pseudovirus ( Figure 3 A). The BA.2 derivatives bearing L452Q, HV69-70del, and F486V exhibited increased infectivity ( Figure 3 A). These results suggest that multiple mutations in the BA.4/5 S proteins, including HV69-70del, L452R, and F486V, increase pseudovirus infectivity. However, when we used both HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells and HEK293-ACE2 cells, on which endogenous surface TMPRSS2 is undetectable ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ...

Biol. 2021; 10 :3445-3460 Crossref Scopus (19) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that the K D value of the BA.4/5 S RBD is comparable to that of BA.2 S RBD ( Figure 3 B), suggesting that the binding affinity of the S RBDs of BA.2 and BA.4/5 is similar. The L452R and L452M substitutions decreased K D values, while the F486V substitution increased K D value ( Figure 3 B). Because the K D value of the L452R/F486V BA.2 was significantly lower than that of the F486V BA.2 ( Figure 3 B), our results suggest that the L452R compensates for the decreased binding affinity to human ACE2 caused by the F486V and, therefore, the binding affinity of BA.2 and BA.4/5 to human ACE2 are similar.
To gain structural insight into the interaction of the BA.4/5 S RBD with human ACE2 protein, we performed X-ray crystallographic analysis of the BA.4/5 S RBD-human ACE2 complex and determined its structure at a resolution of 3.36 Å ( Figures 3 C and S2 B; Table S5 ). Three amino acid substitutions (L452R, F486V, and R493Q) in the BA.4/5 S RBD focused on the interaction with human ACE2 were compared with the BA.2 S RBD ( Figure 3 C). First, the residue R452 of the BA.4/5 S RBD did not form interactions with any residues of ACE2 ( Figure 3 C). This observation is reminiscent of the findings on the complex structure of the Delta S RBD, which bears the L452R, and human ACE2 ( Han et al., 2022 24. Han, P. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Liu, S. ... Receptor binding and complex structures of human ACE2 to spike RBD from omicron and delta SARS-CoV-2 Cell. 2022; 185 630.e10–640.e10 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (295) Google Scholar ). Second, residue V486 of the BA.4/5 S RBD is located in a hydrophobic patch that is formed by residues F28, L79, M82, and Y83 of human ACE2 ( Figure 3 C). Compared with phenylalanine (F), valine (V) reduces bulkiness. Therefore, the reduced bulkiness induced by the F486V in the BA.4/5 S RBD may decrease the hydrophobic interaction with human ACE2, as observed in in vitro binding experiments ( Figure 3 B). Third, residue Q493 of the BA.4/5 S RBD formed a hydrogen bond with residue H34 of human ACE2 ( Figure 3 C). Related to this interaction, a previous study showed that residue R493 of the Omicron BA.1 S RBD forms a hydrogen bond with residue E35 of human ACE2 ( Han et al., 2022 24. Han, P. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Liu, S. ...

Altogether, the overall binding mode of the BA.4/5 S RBD to human ACE2 is similar to those of the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain ( Lan et al., 2020 37. Lan, J. ∙ Ge, J. ∙ Yu, J. ... Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor Nature. 2020; 581 :215-220 Crossref Scopus (4081) PubMed Google Scholar ) and the BA.1 S RBD ( Han et al., 2022 24. Han, P. ∙ Li, L. ∙ Liu, S. ...

We next analyzed the fusogenicity of the BA.2-related Omicron variants by a cell-based fusion assay ( Kimura et al., 2022b 33. Kimura, I. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Nasser, H. ...

As shown in Figures 3 D and S2 C, the cell surface expression of BA.2.11 S was significantly higher than that of BA.2 S. However, the surface expressions of BA.2.12.1 S and BA.4/5 S were significantly lower than those of the BA.2 S ( Figure 3 D). The decreased surface expression of the BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 S proteins was attributed to the S704L (BA.2.12.1) and the HV69-70del, F486V, and R493Q (BA.4/5), respectively ( Figure 3 D). The cell-based fusion assay using Calu-3 cells as target cells showed that the fusogenicity of the BA.2.11 S and the BA.4/5 S was significantly greater than that of BA.2 S, while the other substitutions did not critically affect S protein-mediated fusogenicity ( Figure 3 E). When we used VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells as target cells, all BA.2 derivatives bearing substitutions at the L452 residue that were tested (i.e., L452R/M/Q; BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, and BA.2 L452Q), as well as BA.4/5, significantly increased fusogenicity compared with that of the original BA.2, while the fusogenicity of the other mutants, including BA.2.12.1, was comparable to that of BA.2 ( Figure S2 D). Moreover, a coculture experiment using HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells as the target cells ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86.

Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) showed that the S proteins of BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, and BA.4/5, but not BA.2.12.1, showed significantly increased fusogenicity compared with that of the original BA.2 ( Figure S2 E). Altogether, these findings suggest that the S proteins of BA.2 subvariants that bear the L452R, including BA.2.11 and BA.4/5, exhibited higher fusogenicity than the BA.2 S in three independent experimental models ( Figures 3 E, S2 D, and S2E).
We next prepared the chimeric recombinant BA.2 subvariants, rBA.2, rBA.2.9.1, rBA.2.11, rBA.2.12.1, and rBA.4/5, based on a clinical isolate of BA.2 (strain TY40-385, GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_9595859) by reverse genetics ( Kimura et al., 2022b 33.

The S genes of recombinant viruses were swapped with those of BA.2 subvariants: BA.2.11 (BA.2 S:L452R), BA.2.9.1 (BA.2 S:L452M), BA.2.12.1 (BA.2 S:L452Q/S704L), or BA.4/5 (BA.2 S:HV69-70del/L452R/F486V/R493Q) ( Figure 4 A). The plaques formed by the infections of rBA.2.11 and rBA.4/5, which bear the L452R, were larger than those formed by rBA.2 infection, while rBA.2.9.1 infection showed significantly smaller plaques than rBA.2 infection ( Figure 4 B). Combined with the results of the experiments using S expression plasmids ( Figures 3 E, S2 D, and S2E), these data suggest that the S proteins of BA.2 subvariants bearing the L452R substitution (BA.2.11 and BA.4/5) are more fusogenic than the BA.2 S.
To measure the growth kinetics of BA.2 subvariants, recombinant viruses were inoculated into cells. The replication kinetics of the recombinant BA.2 subvariants tested were comparable to those of rBA.2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells ( Figure 4 C). In Vero cells, the growth of rBA.4/5 was similar to that of rBA.2, but that of the other BA.2 subvariants was significantly lower than that of rBA.2 ( Figure 4 D). In the culture of human airway epithelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the growth of recombinant BA.2 subvariants tested was relatively comparable to that of rBA.2 ( Figure 4 E). Notably, rBA.2.9.1, rBA.2.12.1, and rBA.4/5 were significantly more efficiently replicated than rBA.2 in human iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cells ( Figure 4 F). In particular, at 24 h post infection (h.p.i.), the levels of viral RNA in the supernatant of rBA.2.12.1- and rBA.4/5-infected cultures were 61- and 34-fold higher, respectively, than those of the rBA.2-infected culture ( Figure 4 F). These results suggest that rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5 replicate more efficiently in human alveolar epithelial cells than BA.2.
To investigate the dynamics of viral replication of BA.2 subvariants in vivo , we conducted hamster infection experiments using rBA.2 and the two recombinant BA.2 subvariants, rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5, that exhibited robust growth capacity in human lung cell culture ( Figure 4 F). Consistent with a recent report ( Uraki et al., 2022 75. Uraki, R. ∙ Kiso, M. ∙ Iida, S. ... Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2/BA.2 Nature. 2022; 607 :119-127 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ), the rBA.2-infected hamsters did not exhibit apparent alterations in body weight or two surrogate markers of bronchoconstriction and airway obstruction (enhanced pause [Penh] and the ratio of time to peak expiratory follow-up relative to the total expiratory time [Rpef]). Furthermore, there was no decrease in subcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) observed ( Figure 5 A). Notably, the body weights of the rBA.2.12.1-infected and rBA.4/5-infected hamsters were significantly lower than those of the rBA.2-infected hamsters ( Figure 5 A). Additionally, the Rpef value of the rBA.4/5-infected hamsters was significantly lower than that of the rBA.2-infected hamsters ( Figure 5 A). These data suggest that rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5 exhibit higher pathogenicity than rBA.2.
To analyze viral spread in the respiratory organs of infected hamsters, the viral RNA load and nucleocapsid (N) expression were assessed by reverse-transcption qPCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of viral RNA and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. As shown in Figure 5 B, the viral RNA loads in the lung hilum of rBA.2.12.1- and rBA.4/5-infected hamsters were significantly higher than those of rBA.2-infected hamsters. Intriguingly, the viral RNA loads in the oral swab ( Figure 5 B, top) and lung periphery ( Figure 5 B, bottom) of hamsters infected with rBA.4/5 were significantly higher than those of hamsters with rBA.2, while those of hamsters with rBA.2.12.1 were not significantly different from those of hamsters with rBA.2. In particular, the levels of viral RNA in the lung periphery of rBA.4/5-infected hamsters at 3 and 5 d.p.i. were 5.7- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, than those of rBA.2-infected hamsters ( Figure 5 B, bottom). The higher level of viral load in the lung periphery of rBA.4/5-infected hamsters than that of rBA.2-infected hamsters was also supported by the level of infectious viruses in these regions ( Figure 5 C). These results suggest that rBA.4/5 spreads more efficiently in the lungs of infected hamsters than rBA.2.
To address the possibility that rBA.4/5 spreads more efficiently than BA.2, we investigated N protein positivity in the trachea and the lung area close to the hilum. At 1 d.p.i., there was no apparent difference in the N protein positivity in the tracheal epithelium among hamsters infected with rBA.2, rBA.2.12.1, and rBA.4/5 ( Figure S3 A). In the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia, rBA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 infections exhibited more N-positive cells than rBA.2 infection ( Figure 5 D). At 3 d.p.i., alveolar positivity was observed in lungs infected with rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5 but not in those infected with rBA.2 ( Figure 5 D). Morphometry showed that the percentage of N-positive cells in lungs infected with rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5 was significantly higher than that in lungs infected with rBA.2 at 3 d.p.i. ( Figures 5 E and S3 B). At 5 d.p.i., N protein expression had almost disappeared in all infected lungs ( Figure 5 D). These data suggest that rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5 more efficiently spread in lung tissues than rBA.2.
To investigate the pathogenicity of rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.4/5, the right lungs of the infected hamsters were collected at 1, 3, and 5 d.p.i. and subjected to histopathological analysis ( Figure 5 F) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining ( Figure 5 G) ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Three histological parameters, bronchitis/bronchiolitis, hemorrhage/congestion and alveolar damage, and the total histological score of rBA.2.12-infected hamsters, were significantly higher than those of rBA.2-infected hamsters ( Figures 5 F and 5G). More importantly, all histopathological parameters were significantly higher in rBA.4/5-infected hamsters ( Figure 5 F). Furthermore, in the lungs of infected hamsters at 5 d.p.i., the level of inflammation with type II alveolar pneumocyte hyperplasia by rBA.4/5 infection was significantly higher than that by rBA.2 infection, while there was no statistically significant difference between the rBA.2.12.1 and rBA.2 infections ( Figures 5 H and S3 C). The relatively more severe disorders in the lungs of rBA.4/5-infected hamsters than those of the rBA.2-infected hamsters ( Figures 5 F–5H) were supported by the more efficient spreading of rBA.4/5 than rBA.2 in the infected lungs ( Figures 5 B, bottom and 5 C). Altogether, these observations suggest that rBA.4/5 is more pathogenic than rBA.2 in a hamster model.

Section: Discussion

Viral transmissibility, immune resistance, and pathogenicity characterize the potential risk of new SARS-CoV-2 variants to global health. In this study, we investigated the virological characteristics of the five novel BA.2 subvariants that were classified as VOC-LUM as of May 18, 2022: BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. Recent studies evaluated a series of virological characteristics of novel BA.2 subvariants, particularly BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 in terms of their transmissibility ( Altarawneh et al., 2022 4.

We demonstrated that the L452R increases binding affinity to human ACE2 and pseudovirus infectivity, even on the BA.2 S protein backbone.

Additionally, the S proteins of BA.4 and BA.5 harbor the HV69-70del, and this deletion was also detected in the Alpha variant, which is a prior VOC. Consistent with a previous study ( Meng et al., 2021 48. Meng, B. ∙ Kemp, S.A. ∙ Papa, G. ...

Altogether, multiple mutations in the S protein of BA.4/5 contribute to enhanced growth capacity in human lung cell cultures and the lung of an experimental animal model. However, the bona fide contribution of these substitutions, particularly the L452R in BA.4/5, should be carefully studied in the future. Given that Delta and Lambda, which contained the L452R and L452Q, respectively, were outcompeted by original Omicron BA.1, which does not bear the L452R/Q, it is possible that the L452R that appeared in the BA.4/5 S may also revert to its original sequence. In fact, as of July 2022, it is assumed that a new BA.2 subvariant, BA.2.75, may outcompete other BA.2 subvariants, including BA.4/5 ( GitHub, 2022 20.

In our previous studies that focused on Delta ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ), Omicron BA.1 ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), and Omicron BA.2 ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ), we suggested a close association between viral fusogenicity in in vitro cell cultures and pathogenicity in an in vivo hamster model. For instance, compared with the B.1.1 ancestral variant, the Omicron BA.1 variant, which bore a less fusogenic S, was less pathogenic, while the Delta variant, bearing a more fusogenic S, was more pathogenic ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). Here, we demonstrated that the Omicron BA.4/5 variant bears a more fusogenic S than the Omicron BA.2 variant and exhibits greater pathogenicity. The comparisons of fusogenicity and pathogenicity across these four studies as well as this present study suggest that the Delta variant has the greatest fusogenicity and pathogenicity of the five SARS-CoV-2 variants tested. Importantly, our data support the possibility that viruses with higher fusogenicity exhibit potentially higher pathogenicity, at least in our experimental animal models. Therefore, measuring the fusogenicity of viral S proteins using a system such as the cell-based membrane fusion assay described here can be a rapid surrogate marker for predicting the potential pathogenicity of viruses. Further investigation of the correlation between viral fusogenicity and clinical severity will be needed to understand the significance of the S protein on pathogenicity.
Considering the complex evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, the virus has likely evolved to optimize its transmissibility. From the point of view of pathology, the Delta variant exhibited higher pathogenicity than ancestral variants ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ). Conversely, we observed the attenuated pathogenicity of the Omicron BA.1 variant compared with the Delta variant ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). After disseminating worldwide, BA.1 was replaced with BA.2, which possesses pathogenicity comparable to that of BA.1 ( Uraki et al., 2022 75. Uraki, R. ∙ Kiso, M. ∙ Iida, S. ... Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2/BA.2 Nature. 2022; 607 :119-127 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). On the other hand, our investigation using B.1.1-based chimeric viruses revealed that a virus harboring BA.2 S showed higher pathogenicity than that harboring the BA.1 S ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). These observations suggest that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 would not necessarily attenuate its pathogenicity. One possibility is that the pathogenicity observed at the bedside is a consequence of viral evolution aiming to maximize transmissibility. Given that Omicron BA.1 replicates more efficiently in human cells derived from the upper respiratory tract variant but less efficiently in the lower respiratory tract compared with prior variants ( Hui et al., 2022 25. Hui, K.P.Y. ∙ Ho, J.C.W. ∙ Cheung, M.C. ... SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant replication in human bronchus and lung ex vivo Nature. 2022; 603 :715-720 Crossref Scopus (490) PubMed Google Scholar ), BA.1 was likely to be selected to achieve higher transmissibility than to exhibit higher pathogenicity in the lung. Another scenario of the evolution of the Omicron BA.1 variant stems from adaptation to human host factors. This includes a more efficient utilization of the factors that can positively function for virus infection and replication, such as TMPRSS2, cathepsin, ADAM10, and ADAM17 proteases ( Jocher et al., 2022 27. Jocher, G. ∙ Grass, V. ∙ Tschirner, S.K. ... ADAM10 and ADAM17 promote SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and spike protein-mediated lung cell fusion EMBO Rep. 2022; 23 :e54305 Crossref Scopus (57) PubMed Google Scholar ). Although the BA.1 S is less dependent on TMPRSS2 than ancestral strains ( Meng et al., 2022 47. Meng, B. ∙ Abdullahi, A. ∙ Ferreira, I.A.T.M. ... Altered TMPRSS2 usage by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron impacts infectivity and fusogenicity Nature. 2022; 603 :706-714 Crossref Scopus (611) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), a recent study has shown that the BA.5 S regained dependency on TMPRSS2 ( Aggarwal et al., 2022 3. Aggarwal, A. ∙ Akerman, A. ∙ Milogiannakis, V. ... SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.5: evolving tropism and evasion of potent humoral responses and resistance to clinical immunotherapeutics relative to viral variants of concern eBioMedicine. 2022; 84 :104270 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (56) PubMed Google Scholar ). The switch of the viral entry pathway may alter tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Moreover, it is speculated that SARS-CoV-2 would have evolved to evade factors that can negatively impact virus replication in human cells. In fact, a recent study demonstrated that the replication of BA.4 and BA.5 is associated with reduced activation of innate immune responses ( Reuschl et al., 2022 60. Reuschl, A.-K. ∙ Thorne, L.G. ∙ Whelan, M.V.X. ... Enhanced innate immune suppression by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 2022 Crossref Google Scholar ). Furthermore, while most studies focus on the roles of the S protein and its impact on neutralization sensitivity and the cell entry pathway, a recent study proposed the importance of the investigations of non-S viral components such as envelope and membrane proteins ( Abbas et al., 2022 1. Abbas, Q. ∙ Kusakin, A. ∙ Sharrouf, K. ... Follow-up investigation and detailed mutational characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant lineages (BA.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.1.1) 2022 Crossref Google Scholar ). Collectively, the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and host factors remains to be elucidated.
We showed that BA.4/5 is significantly resistant to the humoral immunity induced by vaccination and breakthrough infections of BA.1 and BA.2 ( Figures 2 C and 2D). The F486V in the BA.4/5 S protein is responsible for its higher resistance to the breakthrough infection antisera ( Figure 2 C). On the other hand, our binding assay suggests that the F486V and L452R exhibited opposing effects on the affinity to the human ACE2 receptor: the F486V reduces the affinity to human ACE2, while the L452R increases the affinity ( Figure 3 B). These results suggest that the L452R is likely to compensate for the ACE2 binding affinity reduced by the F486V. Interestingly, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic dynamics showed that BA.2.11, which bears the L452R but not the other mutations present in the S protein of BA.4/5, did not spread as much as BA.4/5 did in the human population ( Figures 1 D, 1E, and S1 F). This observation suggests that the L452R does not increase BA.2 fitness by itself. Altogether, our results suggest that BA.4/5 acquired a higher resistance to humoral immunity while maintaining the ACE2 binding affinity by acquiring the F486V and L452R substitutions together.
Omicron variants other than BA.4/5 bear the Q493R substitution in the S protein ( Figure 1 C). The R493Q reversion in BA.2 S protein increased susceptibility to the 3rd-dose vaccine-induced antiviral sera, suggesting that the Q493R substitution contributes to the resistance to vaccine-induced humoral immunity ( Figures 2 F and 2G). On the other hand, BA.4/5 lost the Q493R substitution after divergence from BA.2. Interestingly, in experimental animal models without vaccination, the R493Q reversion in the BA.2 S protein increased the resistance to humoral immunity induced by BA.2 infection or BA.2 RBD inoculation ( Figures 2 H and 2I). These results suggest that the R493Q reversion mutation in the BA.4/5 S protein potentially contributes to evading immunity induced by the Q493R-bearing variants, such as BA.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, despite the R493Q reversion in the BA.4/5 S protein, BA.4/5 is still highly resistant to the 3rd-dose vaccine-induced antiviral sera ( Figures 2 F and 2G). This result suggests that the effect of the R493Q reversion on attenuating the resistance to vaccine-induced humoral immunity would be canceled by other substitutions, such as the F486V substitution in the BA.4/5 S protein. Recent studies have demonstrated that BA.4/5 is also resistant to convalescent sera from individuals who were infected with previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta ( Qu et al., 2022 57. Qu, P. ∙ Faraone, J. ∙ Evans, J.P. ... Neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.4/5 and BA.2.12.1 subvariants N. Engl. J. Med. 2022; 386 :2526-2528 Crossref Scopus (119) PubMed Google Scholar ; Wang et al., 2022b 80. Wang, W. ∙ Lusvarghi, S. ∙ Subramanian, R. ... Post-vaccination Omicron infections induce broader immunity across antigenic space than prototype mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccination or primary infection 2022 Crossref Google Scholar ). Altogether, our results and previous reports suggest that BA.4/5 escapes from the humoral immunity induced by vaccination and/or the natural infection of prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.
A simplistic assumption without conclusive evidence implies that SARS-CoV-2 will evolve to attenuate its pathogenicity. However, we argue against this notion with at least three observations. First, the Delta variant exhibited relatively higher pathogenicity than the ancestral B.1 virus in an experimental animal model ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ). Clinical studies also provide evidence suggesting the higher virulence of the Delta variant than other prior variants, including the Alpha variant ( Ong et al., 2021 53. Ong, S.W.X. ∙ Chiew, C.J. ∙ Ang, L.W. ...

Dis. 2022; 22 :35-42 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (493) PubMed Google Scholar ). Second, although the Omicron BA.1 variant was less pathogenic than Delta and the ancestral B.1.1 virus ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ), the S protein of a subsequently spread variant, Omicron BA.2, acquired the potential to exhibit higher pathogenicity than that of Omicron BA.1 ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Third, we demonstrated that Omicron BA.4/5 is potentially more pathogenic than Omicron BA.2. Therefore, our observations strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 does not necessarily acquire mutations to attenuate its pathogenicity.
In our previous study, we used a chimeric virus bearing the BA.2 S gene in a non-BA.2 (PANGO lineage A) genomic backbone and showed the BA.2 S -bearing chimeric virus is more pathogenic in infected hamsters than the BA.1 S -bearing chimeric virus ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). However, another study using a clinical isolate of BA.2 showed a comparable pathogenicity to a BA.1 clinical isolate ( Uraki et al., 2022 75. Uraki, R. ∙ Kiso, M. ∙ Iida, S. ... Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2/BA.2 Nature. 2022; 607 :119-127 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ). This inconsistency of BA.2 pathogenicity found between our recent study ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) and another study ( Uraki et al., 2022 75. Uraki, R. ∙ Kiso, M. ∙ Iida, S. ... Characterization and antiviral susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2/BA.2 Nature. 2022; 607 :119-127 Crossref Scopus (145) PubMed Google Scholar ) could be due to the difference in the viral sequence in the non- S region. In fact, there are 26 mutations in the non- S region between BA.2 and the non-BA.2 backbone (PANGO lineage A) that was used in our previous study ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86. Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ∙ Nasser, H. ... Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ) ( Table S1 ). To avoid such inconsistency, we generated the recombinant viruses based on BA.2 ( Figure 4 A). Compared with BA.2, the majority of BA.2.12.1 does not possess any mutations in the non- S region ( Table S1 ), indicating that the BA.2-based recombinant virus encoding BA.2.12.1 S used for hamster experiments (rBA.2.12.1) is an authentic BA.2.12.1. Moreover, only six and two mutations were detected in the non- S regions of the BA.4 and BA.5 genomes, respectively, compared with the BA.2 genome ( Table S1 ). Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that our findings in the use of recombinant viruses reflect the potential of authentic BA.4/5, compared with BA.2, to exhibit lung tropism ( Figure 4 F) and higher pathogenicity in a hamster model ( Figure 5 ). However, Kawaoka et al. recently showed that the pathogenicity of clinical isolates of BA.4/5 viruses is comparable to that of a BA.2 isolate in animal models ( Kawaoka et al., 2022 29. Kawaoka, Y. ∙ Uraki, R. ∙ Halfmann, P. ... Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.4 and BA.5 clinical isolates https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1820048/v1820041 Date: 2022 Google Scholar ). Moreover, Reuschl et al. showed that the non-S viral proteins encoded by BA.4/5 more efficiently modulate innate immune signaling ( Reuschl et al., 2022 60. Reuschl, A.-K. ∙ Thorne, L.G. ∙ Whelan, M.V.X. ... Enhanced innate immune suppression by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 2022 Crossref Google Scholar ). Further investigations are warranted to clarify the bona fide characteristics of the BA.2 subvariants tested in this study.

Convalescent sera were collected from the following donors: not fully vaccinated individuals who had been infected with the Omicron BA.1 variant (14 non-vaccinated. 8–21 days after testing. n = 14 in total; average age: 44, range: 16–73, 57% male), fully vaccinated individuals who had been infected with the Omicron BA.1 variant (16 2-dose vaccinated. 10-27 days after testing. n = 16 in total; average age: 48, range: 20–76, 44% male), not fully vaccinated individuals who had been infected with the Omicron BA.2 variant (9 non-vaccinated and 1 1-dose vaccinated. 8-27 days after testing. n = 10 in total; average age: 31, range: 7–54, 40% male), and fully vaccinated individuals who had been infected with the Omicron BA.2 variant (9 2-dose vaccinated and 5 3-dose vaccinated. 11-61 days after testing. n = 14 in total; average age: 47, range: 24–84, 64% male). To identify the SARS-CoV-2 variants infecting patients, saliva was collected from COVID-19 patients during infection onset, and RNA was extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52906) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To detect the S E484A substitution (common in all Omicron variants including BA.1, BA.2 and the L452R/Q/M-bearing BA.2-related variants), a primer/probe E484A (SARS-CoV-2) (Takara, Cat# RC322A) was used. To detect the S R214EPE insertion (specific to BA.1, while undetectable in BA.2 and the L452R/Q/M-bearing BA.2-related variants), an in-house-developed protocol was used with the following primers and probe: Omi_ins214s-F1, 5’-TTC TAA GCA CAC GCC TAT AGT GC-3’; Omi_ins214s-R1, 5’-TAA AGC CGA AAA ACC CTG AGG-3’; and Omi_ins214s, FAM-TGA GCC AGA TC-MGB ( Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86.

To verify the absence of S L452R/Q/M substitution (specific to the L452R/Q/M-bearing BA.2-related variants, while undetectable in original BA.2), a L452R (SARS-CoV-2) primer/probe set v2 (Takara, Cat# RC346A) was used. Sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and stored at –80°C until use. The details of the convalescent sera are summarized in Table S4 .
Vaccine sera of fifteen individuals who had BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) (average age: 38, range: 24–48; 53% male) were obtained at one month after the second dose, one month after the third dose, and four months after the third dose. The details of the vaccine sera are summarized in Table S4 .

Briefly, the virus sequences were verified by viral RNA-sequencing analysis. Viral RNA was extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52906). The sequencing library employed for total RNA sequencing was prepared using the NEB next ultra RNA library prep kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Cat# E7530). Paired-end 76-bp sequencing was performed using a MiSeq system (Illumina) with MiSeq reagent kit v3 (Illumina, Cat# MS-102-3001). Sequencing reads were trimmed using fastp v0.21.0 ( Chen et al., 2018 13.

Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1754-1760 Crossref Scopus (31661) PubMed Google Scholar ). Variant calling, filtering, and annotation were performed using SAMtools v1.9 ( Li et al., 2009 40. Li, H. ∙ Handsaker, B. ∙ Wysoker, A. ..., 1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup The sequence alignment/map format and SAMtools Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :2078-2079 Crossref Scopus (37574) PubMed Google Scholar ) and snpEff v5.0e ( Cingolani et al., 2012 14.

To construct an ML tree of Omicron lineages (BA.1–BA.5) sampled from South Africa (shown in Figure 1 A), the genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 and its metadata were downloaded from the GISAID database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ) ( Khare et al., 2021 31. Khare, S. ∙ Gurry, C. ∙ Freitas, L. ... GISAID’s role in pandemic response China CDC Wkly. 2021; 3 :1049-1051 Crossref Scopus (437) PubMed Google Scholar ) on April 23, 2022. We excluded the data of viral strains with the following features from the analysis: i) a lack collection date information; ii) sampling from animals other than humans, iii) >2% undetermined nucleotide characters, or iv) sampling by quarantine. From each viral lineage, 30 sequences were randomly sampled and used for tree construction, in addition to an outgroup sequence, EPI_ISL_466615, representing the oldest isolate of B.1.1 obtained in the UK. The viral genome sequences were mapped to the reference sequence of Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number: NC_045512.2) using Minimap2 v2.17 ( Li, 2018 38. Li, H. Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :3094-3100 Crossref Scopus (5152) PubMed Google Scholar ) and subsequently converted to a multiple sequence alignment according to the GISAID phylogenetic analysis pipeline ( https://github.com/roblanf/sarscov2phylo ). The alignment sites corresponding to the 1–265 and 29674–29903 positions in the reference genome were masked (i.e., converted to NNN). Alignment sites at which >50% of sequences contained a gap or undetermined/ambiguous nucleotide were trimmed using trimAl v1.2 ( Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009 11. Capella-Gutiérrez, S. ∙ Silla-Martínez, J.M. ∙ Gabaldón, T. trimAl: a tool for automated alignment trimming in large-scale phylogenetic analyses Bioinformatics. 2009; 25 :1972-1973 Crossref Scopus (6225) PubMed Google Scholar ). Phylogenetic tree construction was performed via a three-step protocol: i) the first tree was constructed; ii) tips with longer external branches (Z score > 4) were removed from the dataset; iii) and the final tree was constructed. Tree reconstruction was performed by RAxML v8.2.12 ( Stamatakis, 2014 65. Stamatakis, A. RAxML version 8: a tool for phylogenetic analysis and post-analysis of large phylogenies Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 :1312-1313 Crossref Scopus (22845) PubMed Google Scholar ) under the GTRCAT substitution model. The node support value was calculated by 100 times bootstrap analysis.
To classify the BA.2 variants bearing substitutions at the S L452 residue, we constructed an ML tree of BA.2 variants including those bearing substitutions at the S L452 residue (shown in Figure 1 B). For quality control, the BA.2 sequences without the S:N501Y and S:E484A substitutions, characteristic substitutions of Omicron, were removed from the dataset. Also, the BA.2 sequences with the S:HV69-70del, a deletion mutation that is not present in BA.2 but in other Omicron lineages, were removed. To make a subset of BA.2 sequences representing the diversity of BA.2 for tree construction, we defined the “common amino acid haplotype” of BA.2 as described below. We first extracted the BA.2 sequences bearing substitutions at position 452 in S. In these BA.2 variants, amino acid mutations (including substitutions, insertions, and deletions) present > 1% sequences were detected and referred to as the "common amino acid substitutions”. According to the profile of the common amino acid substitutions, a common amino acid haplotype, a set of common amino acid substitutions present in each sequence, was determined for all BA.2 sequences. Finally, up to 20 sequences were randomly sampled from each unique common amino acid haplotype. As outgroup sequences, the oldest isolate of B.1.1 obtained in the UK (EPI_ISL_466615) and the oldest five BA.1 and BA.3 sequences sampled from South Africa after December 1, 2022, were used. The ML tree was constructed by the procedure described above. In the final set, 8,029 BA.2 sequences were included. Outgroup sequences are not displayed in Figure 1 B.
According to the phylogenetic tree of BA.2 shown in Figure 1 B, we defined common ancestry groups of the BA.2 variants bearing substitutions at position 452 in S as the follow procedures. First, the ancestral state of the amino acid at position 452 in S at each node was estimated using a fixed-rates continuous-time Markov model (Mk model) implemented in the R package “castor” ( Figure S1 C) ( Louca and Doebeli, 2018 43. Louca, S. ∙ Doebeli, M. Efficient comparative phylogenetics on large trees Bioinformatics. 2018; 34 :1053-1055 Crossref Scopus (276) PubMed Google Scholar ). As a type of transition matrix in the Mk model, all rate different (ARD) matrix was selected. Second, we identified the branches connecting the parental-state (L) nodes and the mutated-sate (R, Q, or M) nodes (red branches in Figure S1 C). In these branches, it is expected that the substitution acquisitions in the S L452 residue occurred. Finally, we counted the descendant sequences of respective branches where the substitutions in the S L452 were likely acquired. If the number of descendants is ≥10, we defined these descendant sequences as a common ancestry group of the BA.2 variants, which bears a substitutions at position 452 in S. Information of the common ancestry group is summarized in Table S2 .
To quantify the spread rate of each SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the human population, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number of each viral lineage according to the epidemic dynamics, calculated on the basis of viral genomic surveillance data. The data were downloaded from the GISAID database ( https://www.gisaid.org/ ) on May 15, 2022. We excluded the data of viral strains with the following features from the analysis: i) a lack of collection date information; ii) sampling in animals other than humans; or iii) sampling by quarantine. We analyzed the datasets of the five countries (South Africa, the USA, France, Denmark and Belgium) where BA.4/5, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.9.1, and BA.2.13 were most detected, respectively. The BA.2 sublineages without amino acid substitutions at position 452 in S were summarized as BA.2. In addition, the Delta sublineages were also summarized as Delta. The dynamics of up to five most predominant viral lineages in each country from February 5, 2022, to May 15, 2022, were analyzed. The number of viral sequences of each viral lineage collected on each day in each country was counted, and the count matrix was constructed as an input for the statistical model below.
We constructed a Bayesian statistical model to represent relative lineage growth dynamics with multinomial logistic regression, as described in our previous study ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ). In the present study, the epidemic dynamics in respective countries were independently estimated. Arrays in the model index over one or more indices: viral lineages 𝑙 and days 𝑡 . The model is: μ 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑡 = α 𝑙 + β 𝑙 ⁢ t θ . 𝑡 = s o f t m a x ⁡ ( μ . 𝑡 ) 𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑡 ∼ M u l t i n o m i a l ⁡ ( ∑ 𝑙 𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑡 , ⁢ θ . 𝑡 )
The explanatory variable was time, 𝑡 , and the outcome variable was 𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑡 , which represented the count of viral lineage 𝑙 at time 𝑡 . In the model, the linear estimator μ . 𝑡 , consisting of the intercept α . and the slope β . , was converted to the simplex θ . 𝑡 , which represented the probability of occurrence of each viral lineage at time 𝑡 , based on the softmax link function defined as: s o f t m a x ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) = e x p ⁡ ( 𝑥 ) 𝛴 𝑖 ⁢ e x p ⁡ ( 𝑥 𝑖 )
𝑦 𝑙 ⁢ 𝑡 is generated from θ . 𝑡 and the total count of all lineages at time 𝑡 according to a multinomial distribution.
The relative R e of each viral lineage ( 𝑟 𝑙 ) was calculated according to the slope parameter β 𝑙 as: r 𝑙 = e x p ⁡ ( γ ⁢ β 𝑡 )
where γ is the average viral generation time (2.1 days) ( http://sonorouschocolate.com/covid19/index.php?title=Estimating_Generation_Time_Of_Omicron ).
For parameter estimation, the intercept and slope parameters of the BA.2 variant were fixed at 0. Consequently, the relative R e of BA.2 was fixed at 1, and those of the other lineages were estimated relative to that of BA.2.
Parameter estimation was performed via the MCMC approach implemented in CmdStan v2.28.1 ( https://mc-stan.org ) with CmdStanr v0.4.0 ( https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/ ). Noninformative priors were set for all parameters. Four independent MCMC chains were run with 500 and 2,000 steps in the warmup and sampling iterations, respectively. We confirmed that all estimated parameters showed < 1.01 R-hat convergence diagnostic values and > 200 effective sampling size values, indicating that the MCMC runs were successfully convergent. The fitted model closely recapitulated the observed viral lineage dynamics ( Figures 1 E and S1 D). The above analyses were performed in R v4.1.3 ( https://www.r-project.org/ ). Information on the relative effective reproduction number of BA.2 estimated in the present study is summarized in Table S3 . In addition, using the SRAS-CoV-2 genome surveillance data downloaded on July 7, 2022, we estimated the relative R e of BA.4/5, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.9.1, and BA.2.13 in South Africa, the USA, France, Denmark, and Belgium.

Plasmids expressing the codon-optimized S proteins of L452R/Q/M-bearing variants and their derivatives were generated by site-directed overlap extension PCR using the primers listed in Table S6 . The resulting PCR fragment was digested with KpnI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding site of the pCAGGS vector ( Niwa et al., 1991 52. Niwa, H. ∙ Yamamura, K. ∙ Miyazaki, J.

Nucleotide sequences were determined by DNA sequencing services (Eurofins), and the sequence data were analyzed by Sequencher v5.1 software (Gene Codes Corporation).
The BA.2 S RBD and hACE2 were prepared as previously described ( Kubota et al., 2016 36. Kubota, M. ∙ Takeuchi, K. ∙ Watanabe, S. ... Trisaccharide containing α2,3-linked sialic acid is a receptor for mumps virus Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113 :11579-11584 Crossref Scopus (63) PubMed Google Scholar ). Briefly, the expression plasmids encoding the BA.2 S RBD, its mutants, or human ACE2 were transfected into 293S GnTI (-) cells. The proteins in the culture supernatant were purified with cOmplete His-Tag Purification Resin (Roche) affinity column, followed by Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 size-exclusion chromatography (Cytiva) with calcium- and magnesium-free PBS buffer.
BALB/c mice (female, 7 weeks old) were immunized with 1 μg SARS-CoV-2 BA.2 RBD protein in 50% AddaVax (InvivoGen, Cat# vac-adx-10) at day 0 and 14. Ten days after second immunization, blood was collected in BD microtainer blood collection tubes (BD Biosciences, Cat# 365967) and sera were collected by centrifugation.

The sitting-drop method was used to obtain the BA.4/5 S RBD-human ACE2 complex crystals. In detail, purified complex proteins were concentrated to 5.69 mg/ml. Then, 0.9 ul protein was mixed with 0.9 ul reservoir solution. The resulting solution was sealed and equilibrated against 50 ul reservoir solution at 293 K. Crystals of the BA.4/5 S RBD-human ACE2 complex were grown in 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 11% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Then, crystals were soaked briefly in 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5), 13% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 20% glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected from beamline BL17A at Photon Factory (Ibaraki, Japan). All diffraction data were indexed, integrated, scaled, and merged using XDS ( Kabsch, 2010 28. Kabsch, W. XDS Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66 :125-132 Crossref Scopus (12648) PubMed Google Scholar ).
The crystal structure of the BA.4/5 S RBD-human ACE2 complex ( Figure 3 C) was determined by the molecular replacement method with Phaser ( McCoy et al., 2007 46. McCoy, A.J. ∙ Grosse-Kunstleve, R.W. ∙ Adams, P.D. ... Phaser crystallographic software J. Appl.

Briefly, on day 1, effector cells (i.e., S-expressing cells) and target cells (see below) were prepared at a density of 0.6–0.8 × 10 6 cells in a 6-well plate. To prepare effector cells, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the S expression plasmids (400 ng) and pDSP 8-11 ( Kondo et al., 2011 34. Kondo, N. ∙ Miyauchi, K. ∙ Matsuda, Z. Monitoring viral-mediated membrane fusion using fluorescent reporter methods Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2011; Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) (400 ng) using TransIT-LT1 (Takara, Cat# MIR2300). On day 2, to prepare target cells, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were transfected with pDSP 1-7 ( Kondo et al., 2011 34. Kondo, N. ∙ Miyauchi, K. ∙ Matsuda, Z. Monitoring viral-mediated membrane fusion using fluorescent reporter methods Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2011; Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ) (400 ng). On day 3 (24 hours posttransfection), 16,000 effector cells were detached and reseeded into 96-well black plates (PerkinElmer, Cat# 6005225), and target cells (VeroE6/TMPRSS2 or Calu-3/DSP 1-7 cells) were reseeded at a density of 1,000,000 cells/2 ml/well in 6-well plates. On day 4 (48 hours posttransfection), target cells were incubated with EnduRen live cell substrate (Promega, Cat# E6481) for 3 hours and then detached, and 32,000 target cells were added to a 96-well plate with effector cells. Renilla luciferase activity was measured at the indicated time points using Centro XS3 LB960 (Berthhold Technologies). To measure the surface expression level of S protein, effector cells were stained with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 S S1/S2 polyclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# PA5-112048, 1:100). Normal rabbit IgG (SouthernBiotech, Cat# 0111-01, 1:100) was used as negative controls, and APC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cat# 111-136-144, 1:50) was used as a secondary antibody. Surface expression level of S proteins ( Figures 3 D and S2 C) was measured using FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software v10.7.1 (BD Biosciences). To calculate fusion activity, Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to the MFI of surface S proteins. The normalized value (i.e., Renilla luciferase activity per the surface S MFI) is shown as fusion activity.
Coculture experiment ( Figure S2 E) was performed as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ...

This assay utilizes a dual split protein (DSP) encoding Renilla luciferase and GFP genes; the respective split proteins, DSP 8-11 and DSP 1-7 , are expressed in effector and target cells by transfection. Briefly, one day before transfection, effector cells (i.e., S-expressing cells) were seeded on the poly-L-lysine (Sigma, Cat# P4832) coated coverslips put in a 12-well plate, and target cells were prepared at a density of 100,000 cells in a 12-well plate. To prepare effector cells, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the S-expression plasmids (500 ng) and pDSP 8-11 (500 ng) using PEI Max (Polysciences, Cat# 24765-1). To prepare target cells, HEK293 and HEK293-ACE2/TMPRSS2 cells were transfected with pDSP 1-7 (500 ng) ( Kondo et al., 2011 34. Kondo, N. ∙ Miyauchi, K. ∙ Matsuda, Z. Monitoring viral-mediated membrane fusion using fluorescent reporter methods Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2011; Crossref Scopus (38) PubMed Google Scholar ). At 24 hours posttransfection, target cells were detached and cocultured with effector cells in a 1:2 ratio. At 9 h post-coculture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 09154-85) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# H3570). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Cat# 0100-01) with Hoechst 33342 and observed using an A1Rsi Confocal Microscope (Nikon). The size of syncytium (GFP-positive area) was measured using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ) as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ...

To generate the BA.2-based chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rBA.2, rBA.2.9.1, rBA.2.11 and rBA.4/5) ( Figure 4 A), RNA was extracted from the cells infected with a clinical isolate of BA.2 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_9595859) and cDNA was synthesized as described above (see “ viral genome sequencing ” section). The two DNA fragments correspond to the fragments 1-7 and 9 were prepared by RT-PCR using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara, Cat# R050A) using the primers listed in Table S6 . The fragments 8 bearing the S genes of BA.2, BA.2.9.1, BA.2.11, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 were prepared as described above. Finally, the 3 DNA fragments were mixed and used for CPER ( Torii et al., 2021 70. Torii, S. ∙ Ono, C. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

To produce recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (seed viruses), the CPER products were transfected into HEK293-C34 cells using TransIT-LT1 (Takara, Cat# MIR2300) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At one day posttransfection, the culture medium was replaced with DMEM (high glucose) (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# 6429-500ML) containing 2% FBS, 1% PS and doxycycline (1 μg/ml; Takara, Cat# 1311N). At six days posttransfection, the culture medium was harvested and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected as the seed virus. To remove the CPER products (i.e., SARS-CoV-2-related DNA), 1 ml of the seed virus was treated with 2 μl TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# AM2238) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Complete removal of the CPER products from the seed virus was verified by PCR. The working virus stock was prepared using the seed virus as described below (see “SARS-CoV-2 preparation and titration” section).
The working virus stocks of chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 were prepared and titrated as previously described ( Kimura et al., 2022b 33. Kimura, I. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Nasser, H. ...

In brief, 20 μl of the seed virus was inoculated into VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (5,000,000 cells in a T-75 flask). One h.p.i., the culture medium was replaced with DMEM (low glucose) (Wako, Cat# 041-29775) containing 2% FBS and 1% PS. At 3 d.p.i., the culture medium was harvested and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected as the working virus stock.
The titer of the prepared working virus was measured as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ). Briefly, one day before infection, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) were seeded into a 96-well plate. Serially diluted virus stocks were inoculated into the cells and incubated at 37°C for 4 days. The cells were observed under microscopy to judge the CPE appearance. The value of TCID 50 /ml was calculated with the Reed–Muench method ( Reed and Muench, 1938 58. Reed, L.J. ∙ Muench, H. A simple method of estimating fifty percent endpoints Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27 :493-497 Google Scholar ).
To verify the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 working viruses, viral RNA was extracted from the working viruses using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Cat# 52906) and viral genome sequences were analyzed as described above (see " viral genome sequencing " section). Information on the unexpected substitutions detected is summarized in Table S7 , and the raw data are deposited in the GitHub repository ( https://github.com/TheSatoLab/BA.2_related_Omicrons ).

Briefly, one day before infection, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (100,000 cells) were seeded into a 24-well plate and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (1, 10, 100 and 1,000 TCID 50 ) at 37°C for 1 hour. Mounting solution containing 3% FBS and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (Wako, Cat# 039-01335) was overlaid, followed by incubation at 37°C. At 3 d.p.i., the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 09154-85). The fixed cells were washed with tap water, dried, and stained with staining solution [0.1% methylene blue (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 22412-14) in water] for 30 minutes. The stained cells were washed with tap water and dried, and the size of plaques was measured using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ).
One day before infection, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (10,000 cells) and Vero cells (10,000 cells) and were seeded into a 96-well plate. SARS-CoV-2 [100 TCID 50 for VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells ( Figure 4 C); 1,000 TCID 50 for Vero cells ( Figure 4 D)] was inoculated and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The infected cells were washed, and 180 μl culture medium was added. The culture supernatant (10 μl) was harvested at the indicated timepoints and used for RT–qPCR to quantify the viral RNA copy number (see “ rt–qPCR ” section below) In the infection experiment using human iPSC-derived airway and alveolar epithelial cells ( Figures 4 E and 4F), working viruses were diluted with Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11058021). The diluted viruses (1,000 TCID 50 in 100 μl) were inoculated onto the apical side of the culture and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. The inoculated viruses were removed and washed twice with Opti-MEM. To collect the viruses, 100 μl Opti-MEM was applied onto the apical side of the culture and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. The Opti-MEM was collected and used for RT–qPCR to quantify the viral RNA copy number (see “ rt–qPCR ” section below).

Briefly, 5 μl culture supernatant was mixed with 5 μl 2 × RNA lysis buffer [2% Triton X-100 (Nacalai Tesque, Cat# 35501-15), 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40% glycerol, 0.8 U/μl recombinant RNase inhibitor (Takara, Cat# 2313B)] and incubated at room temperature for 10 m. RNase-free water (90 μl) was added, and the diluted sample (2.5 μl) was used as the template for real-time RT-PCR performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using One Step TB Green PrimeScript PLUS RT-PCR kit (Takara, Cat# RR096A) and the following primers: Forward N , 5'-AGC CTC TTC TCG TTC CTC ATC AC-3'; and Reverse N , 5'-CCG CCA TTG CCA GCC ATT C-3'. The viral RNA copy number was standardized with a SARS-CoV-2 direct detection RT-qPCR kit (Takara, Cat# RC300A). Fluorescent signals were acquired using QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad), Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina), qTOWER3 G Real-Time System (Analytik Jena) or 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Animal experiments ( Figure 5 ) were performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

Syrian hamsters (male, 4 weeks old) were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). Baseline body weights were measured before infection. For the virus infection experiments, hamsters were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of a mixture of either 0.15 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor®, Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo), 2.0 mg/kg midazolam (FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals, Cat# 135-13791) and 2.5 mg/kg butorphanol (Vetorphale®, Meiji Seika Pharma), or 0.15 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride, 2.0 mg/kg alphaxaone (Alfaxan®, Jurox) and 2.5 mg/kg butorphanol. The chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (rBA.2, rBA.2.12.1, and rBA.4/5) (10,000 TCID 50 in 100 μl), or saline (100 μl) were intranasally inoculated under anesthesia. Oral swabs were collected at 1, 3, and 5 d.p.i. Body weight, enhanced pause (Penh), the ratio of time to peak expiratory follow relative to the total expiratory time (Rpef) and subcutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) were routinely monitored at indicated timepoints (see “ lung function test ” section below). Respiratory organs were anatomically collected at 1, 3 and 5 d.p.i (for lung) or 1 d.p.i. (for trachea). Viral RNA load in the respiratory tissues and oral swab were determined by RT–qPCR. The respiratory tissues were also used for histopathological and IHC analyses (see “ h&E staining ” and “ ihc ” sections below). Sera of infected hamsters were collected at 16 d.p.i. using cardiac puncture under anesthesia with isoflurane and used for neutralization assay (see “Neutralization assay” above).
Lung function test ( Figure 5 A) was performed at 1, 3, 5, and 7 d.p.i. as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ...

Respiratory parameters (Penh and Rpef) were measured by using a whole-body plethysmography system (DSI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, a hamster was placed in an unrestrained plethysmography chamber and allowed to acclimatize for 30 seconds, then, data were acquired over a 2.5-minute period by using FinePointe Station and Review softwares v2.9.2.12849 (STARR). The state of oxygenation was examined by measuring SpO 2 using pulse oximeter, MouseOx PLUS (STARR). SpO 2 was measured by attaching a measuring chip to the neck of hamsters sedated by 0.25 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride.
IHC ( Figures 5 D, S3 A, and S3B) was performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

The deparaffinized sections were exposed to EnVision FLEX target retrieval solution high pH (Agilent, Cat# K8004) for 20 minutes at 97°C to activate, and mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 N monoclonal antibody (clone 1035111, R&D systems, Cat# MAB10474-SP, 1:400) was used as a primary antibody. The sections were sensitized using EnVision FLEX (Agilent) for 15 minutes and visualized by peroxidase-based enzymatic reaction with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dako, Cat# DM827) as substrate for 5 minutes. The N protein positivity ( Figures 5 D, S3 A, and S3B) was evaluated by certificated pathologists as previously described ( Suzuki et al., 2022 66. Suzuki, R. ∙ Yamasoba, D. ∙ Kimura, I. ... Attenuated fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant Nature. 2022; 603 :700-705 Crossref Scopus (364) PubMed Google Scholar ; Yamasoba et al., 2022b 86.

Images were incorporated as virtual slide by NDP.scan software v3.2.4 (Hamamatsu Photonics). The N-protein positivity was measured as the area using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ).
H&E staining ( Figure 5 G) was performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

Briefly, excised animal tissues were fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, and processed for paraffin embedding. The paraffin blocks were sectioned with 3 μm-thickness and then mounted on MAS-GP-coated glass slides (Matsunami Glass, Cat# S9901). H&E staining was performed according to a standard protocol.
Histopathological scoring ( Figure 5 F) was performed as previously described ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ... Enhanced fusogenicity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 Delta P681R mutation Nature. 2022; 602 :300-306 Crossref Scopus (323) PubMed Google Scholar ; Suzuki et al., 2022 66.

Virological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 spike Cell. 2022; 185 2103.e19–2115.e19 Full Text Full Text (PDF) Scopus (172) PubMed Google Scholar ). Pathological features including bronchitis or bronchiolitis, hemorrhage with congestive edema, alveolar damage with epithelial apoptosis and macrophage infiltration, hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and the area of the hyperplasia of large type II pneumocytes were evaluated by certified pathologists and the degree of these pathological findings were arbitrarily scored using four-tiered system as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The "large type II pneumocytes" are the hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes exhibiting more than 10-μm-diameter nucleus. We described "large type II pneumocytes" as one of the remarkable histopathological features reacting SARS-CoV-2 infection in our previous studies ( Saito et al., 2022 63. Saito, A. ∙ Irie, T. ∙ Suzuki, R. ...

Total histology score is the sum of these five indices.
To measure the inflammation area in the infected lungs ( Figures 5 H and S3 C), four hamsters infected with each virus were sacrificed at 5 d.p.i., and all four right lung lobes, including upper (anterior/cranial), middle, lower (posterior/caudal), and accessory lobes, were sectioned along with their bronchi. The tissue sections were stained by H&E, and the digital microscopic images were incorporated into virtual slides using NDP.scan software v3.2.4 (Hamamatsu Photonics). The inflammatory area including type II pneumocyte hyperplasia in the infected whole lungs was morphometrically analyzed using Fiji software v2.2.0 (ImageJ).
Statistical significance was tested using a two-sided Mann–Whitney U -test, a two-sided Student's t -test or a two-sided paired t -test unless otherwise noted. The tests above were performed using Prism 9 software v9.1.1 (GraphPad Software).
In the time-course experiments ( Figures 3 E, 4 C-4F, 5 A–5C, 5F, and S2 D), a multiple regression analysis including experimental conditions (i.e., the types of infected viruses) as explanatory variables and timepoints as qualitative control variables was performed to evaluate the difference between experimental conditions thorough all timepoints. The initial time point was removed from the analysis. P value was calculated by a two-sided Wald test. Subsequently, familywise error rates (FWERs) were calculated by the Holm method. These analyses were performed in R v4.1.2 ( https://www.r-project.org/ ).
In Figures 5 D, 5G, and S3 , photographs shown are the representative areas of at least two independent experiments by using four hamsters at each timepoint. In Figure S3 A, photographs shown are the representatives of >20 fields of view taken for each sample.
